1
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:15,647
And that's how it went.

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,149
Everything done
by the book.

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,284
I see.

4
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,886
Well, you're my last witness

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,357
which means that we are reaching
the end of this trial.

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,359
And this is when I usually
present my summation

7
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:32,831
with a smart turn-of-phrase
or a memorable quote,

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,368
but all I can say is...

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,270
I have no case.

10
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,306
The defense has been air tight,

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,376
but let's review the facts.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,177
Not it!

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,278
It's not fair!

14
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,147
If you want to be it, you have
to catch me first.

15
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,548
The treehouse, it's mine!

16
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,582
You'll never catch me!

17
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,650
No girls allowed!

18
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,118
You never go up here anyway.

19
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,386
That's because it's too high.

20
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,888
It's dangerous.

21
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,256
You children!

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,825
You stop this nonsense
or I'm calling your mother!

23
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,560
It's Quinn's fault,
Nanny Doris.

24
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,162
He's a maniac.

25
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,167
East Line Cooling testified
that they were blameless

26
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,836
when their system failed
last summer,

27
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,606
turning my client's $2 million
wine collection

28
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,709
into vinegar.

29
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,713
And, as the vice president
testified,

30
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:27,286
you personally inspected the
wiring the day of the incident.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,157
Finding

32
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,327
the wiring properly installed,

33
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:41,200
the system running perfectly,
and East Line without fault.

34
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,702
An audible yes or no.

35
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,839
Yes.

36
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,775
One last question.

37
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,743
What colour are my shoes?

38
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,116
I'm claiming the treehouse.

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,817
A victory for girls everywhere.

40
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,986
Emma, the treehouse is mine.

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,022
Sorry, possession is nine
tenths of the law.

42
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,092
NOOOOO!

43
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,528
Emma, are you ok?!

44
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,729
Of course.

45
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,064
Why wouldn't I be?

46
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:19,438
You... you...
you children are impossible!

47
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,576
Again, sir.

48
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,578
My shoes?

49
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,447
The colour.

50
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,757
You didn't check the wiring
as you claimed, you couldn't,

51
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,326
because you're colourblind.

52
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,929
I... I...

53
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,231
I rest my case,
your honour.

54
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,969
And for the record
my shoes are red.

55
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,273
How's everybody doing today?

56
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,742
Hello! And goodbye!

57
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,377
Wha-wh-wait!

58
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,012
What'll I tell their mother?

59
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,947
Not my problem!

60
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,054
What have I told you kids
about karma?

61
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,322
Huh?

62
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,231
The jury has returned their
verdict ruling that...

63
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,904
Is there a problem, counsellor?

64
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,772
No, your honour.

65
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,240
Sorry.

66
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,046
What is going on
in this house?

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,614
Well, let's look
on the bright side.

68
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,683
The children are getting
so creative.

69
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,052
I live by the law.

70
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,287
How do I have such
rule-breaking kids?

71
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,757
I suppose they take after
their grandma, don't they?

72
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,759
You said it, not me.

73
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,996
Kids, kitchen. Now.

74
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,301
So what do you have
to say for yourselves?

75
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,237
We were just having fun.

76
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,772
Pretending your sister is
seriously injured is fun?

77
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,573
I object, mom.

78
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,608
You're leading the witness.

79
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,243
Emma, legalese is best
left in the hands-

80
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,978
In the hands of
the professionals.

81
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,146
I know.

82
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:13,452
This is, um... our fifth nanny
in six months.

83
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,720
What was wrong
with nanny Doris?

84
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,255
Wasn't a good fit. Too nervous.

85
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,089
Nanny Amy?

86
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:17,823
Too serious.

87
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:18,890
Nanny Margaret?

88
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,260
Driving with her, you took
your life in your hands.

89
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,529
And we know how important
road safety is to you, mom.

90
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,539
Tell me that that...

91
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,708
that isn't a trophy wall?

92
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,047
You mean our art project?

93
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,550
Upstairs, now!

94
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,552
Go on, pajamas.

95
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,856
Early dinner, early to bed.

96
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,324
Why are they doing this?

97
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,227
Well, they got you home early,
didn't they?

98
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,529
They're too smart
for their own good.

99
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,432
Well, now that they get
from you.

100
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,968
I'm just saying,
ok look at this wall.

101
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:07,506
Alright, school, rock climbing,
soccer, violin...

102
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,208
that's just a Monday!

103
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,778
I am trying to raise
well-rounded children

104
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,248
that will make good decisions
when they are of age.

105
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,216
And I fully support that.

106
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,319
Are you volunteering
your services?

107
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,256
Ok, you know I would
love nothing more,

108
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,459
but honestly if I'm not at
the store, nothing gets done.

109
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,228
I know, I know,
it's not your job.

110
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,397
We're gonna find a nanny,
I promise.

111
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,665
But please.

112
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,935
Please, tomorrow you have
to go to the nanny agency

113
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,837
and try to line someone up
for us, ok?

114
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,839
Ok, I will try.

115
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,873
There has to be somebody

116
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,177
who does not know the legend
of Emma and Quinn.

117
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,704
Grandma, they've got Galaxo.

118
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,806
Can we play, please?

119
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,041
Oh, honey, we're just
about to eat lunch.

120
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,676
But playing Galaxo
will make us hungry.

121
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,410
Really?

122
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,978
Alright.

123
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,246
Ok, there you go.

124
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,315
Share nicely and stay
on that machine

125
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,350
so I can see you, ok?

126
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,589
Hi, Cass.

127
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,158
Mom, please tell me
the search is going well.

128
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,293
Oh, alright now don't panic
but I've already talked to

129
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,029
three agencies
and so far no takers.

130
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,231
<i>You have to find someone.</i>

131
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,633
This couldn't be happening
at a busier time!

132
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,368
I know, I'm doing my best.

133
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,703
Mom, I'm desperate.

134
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,537
Don't worry, honey.

135
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,973
I'll get creative if I have to,
ok?

136
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:48,740
<i>Thanks.</i>

137
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,776
Ok, bye.

138
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,511
Vivian?

139
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,645
Charles!

140
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,046
Oh!

141
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,048
What a surprise to see you!

142
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,417
Oh, it's been so long.

143
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,452
It has been too long.

144
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,686
You look great.

145
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,788
Ageless and timeless.

146
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,856
Oh, you always were
such a good liar.

147
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,391
Nothing but the truth.

148
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,292
Oh, you.

149
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:08,827
May I?

150
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:09,928
Oh, please, sit down.

151
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,062
Yeah.

152
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,298
Although I must warn you
I'm watching my grandchildren

153
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,001
but I promise they will be
on their best behaviour.

154
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:19,838
Yeah, who am I kidding?

155
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,139
I don't have that kind of power.

156
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,010
It's alright, I'm expecting
my son, Matthew.

157
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,077
Oh.

158
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,145
I don't have that kind of power
with him, either,

159
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,580
and he's an adult.

160
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,581
So they tell me.

161
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,683
So Matthew Walker's
back in town?

162
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,351
Hard to believe, I know.

163
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,253
After nine months
of sailing around the Gulf

164
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,755
of who knows where.

165
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,291
Boy, that guy's been living
the dream, hasn't he?

166
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,158
Uh huh.

167
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,259
He made his internet fortune

168
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,595
so I guess he can do
what he wants.

169
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,131
Still, I'd like to see him
settle down.

170
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,899
How are you guys
getting along?

171
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,267
Same as ever.

172
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,836
He's been back two weeks
and we're already at odds

173
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,703
with each other.

174
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:55,040
Yeah, this time
it's about this marina.

175
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,309
Honestly, I don't know
what to do.

176
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,211
I just wish he could commit
to something.

177
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,913
I mean, I'm not getting any
younger and neither is he.

178
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,216
It'd be nice to know that my
business would be in good hands,

179
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,084
you know, someday.

180
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,489
You did it, Cass.

181
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,990
This is the big time.

182
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:16,061
I'm giving you lead chair
on the Haskey case.

183
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,964
Oh, thats... fantastic.

184
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,199
The next few weeks
will be intense,

185
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,535
but it's your shot.

186
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,972
You nail this,
we're talking partner.

187
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,206
Great.

188
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:32,744
Oh... what a mess.

189
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,778
You seem a little frazzled.

190
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,546
No, no.

191
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,349
I'm fine.

192
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,817
A lot is on the line here,
Cass.

193
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,252
It's not just the case.

194
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,853
Adam Haskey is a big payer
in this town.

195
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,923
He could be a huge client
for us.

196
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,925
Everything is under control.

197
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,560
Thank you.

198
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,900
Children, you never stop
worrying about them, do you?

199
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,635
You certainly don't.

200
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,338
You know, Cass has
the opposite problem.

201
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,908
She never takes a moment
to stop and smell the roses.

202
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,709
She's always scheduled,

203
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,678
always something new
on her plate.

204
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,713
So she never found anyone
since Elliott passed away?

205
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,081
Uh-uh.

206
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,017
She has no time for romance.

207
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,919
She barely even has time for
her kids and you know what,

208
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,954
those kids really need her.

209
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,223
And right now they don't
even have a nanny.

210
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,295
Matthew!

211
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,497
Hey, Woody.

212
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,432
Maybe you can talk
to your dad.

213
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,466
Oh, I will.

214
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,068
Don't you worry.

215
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,837
A lot of good people are gonna
lose work if that goes through.

216
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,541
I'll chain myself to a bulldozer
if I have to.

217
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,175
Take care, bud.

218
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,010
You too.

219
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,447
Yep, I guess one needs
to grow up

220
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:46,618
and the other one needs
to live a little, huh?

221
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,587
Oh, there he is.

222
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,521
Emma, it's not fair.

223
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,589
You just went.

224
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,124
Well, I got the high score
and that's how it works.

225
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,426
Woah, woah, woah.

226
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,328
Easy now, I'm sure
we can settle this.

227
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,063
Find some peace with honour.

228
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,897
How can I help?

229
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,131
Do you have a quarter?

230
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,032
I'm short.

231
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,000
You certainly are.

232
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,969
You don't just ask strangers
for money.

233
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:04,936
It's alright.

234
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,172
I'm pretty sure I can spare
a quarter.

235
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,407
Ah, but... what's your
highest score?

236
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,442
600,000.

237
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,276
On Galaxo.

238
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,544
872,000.

239
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,345
Pff. Amateurs.

240
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,546
You know what?

241
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,614
I can crack a million
with one eye shut.

242
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,183
Step aside, watch and learn.

243
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,017
Look at him.

244
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,852
He's a natural with those kids.

245
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,020
It takes one to know one,
I guess.

246
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,124
Charles?

247
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,058
Hmm?

248
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,528
I think you just gave me
the best idea.

249
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,596
Yeah!

250
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,932
Right?

251
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,510
Yes!

252
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,681
You can't move forward
with your condos.

253
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,950
It will ruin the marina.

254
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,718
I'm not sure why you care.

255
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,286
You're never around long
enough to enjoy it.

256
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:55,854
Oh, great.

257
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:56,855
Here we go.

258
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,457
Maybe there could be a reason
to stick around.

259
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,993
<i>You could be Cass's nanny.</i>

260
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,896
Me? As Cass's nanny?

261
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,930
You gotta be joking.

262
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,032
Actually, I'm not.

263
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,466
She never even liked me.

264
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,402
Yes, she did.

265
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,703
But she really does need
the help.

266
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,871
She's desperate.

267
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,373
I'm sorry Cass is in
a rough spot, but me?

268
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,641
I really don't think
I'm the right guy.

269
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,243
I don't even know these kids.

270
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,544
Well, actually you do.

271
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,646
They already like you.

272
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,948
And you'd just be helping out
a friend.

273
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,051
You help Cass

274
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,954
and show me that you can commit
to something here in town

275
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,892
and I'll reconsider the marina
development project.

276
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,662
Are you serious?

277
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,864
Do I ever joke
about business?

278
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,533
You do not.

279
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,635
You do this for Cass

280
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,904
and I'll make sure

281
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,007
that whatever your friends
hold dear about this marina

282
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,577
will be under your control.

283
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:56,548
It's up to you, son.

284
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,360
Alright.

285
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,028
Wee!

286
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,695
Oooh.

287
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,630
Mom, it's ok.

288
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,265
We can just have cereal.

289
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,968
I don't mind floor pancakes.

290
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,069
Goody-goody.

291
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,406
Oh, that must be our nanny
candidate.

292
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,908
My prayers have
been answered.

293
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,310
Mom, get down here.

294
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,512
Nanny candidate's
at the door.

295
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,380
You two behave.

296
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,595
Hey, Cass.

297
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,197
Matthew?

298
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,599
Matthew Walker.

299
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,433
Yeah.

300
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,734
It's been a while.

301
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,103
You look... great.

302
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,239
Oh, thank you.

303
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,376
Um, so do you.

304
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,011
Come in.

305
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,349
Wow, nice place.

306
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,118
Yeah, it's not too shabby.

307
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,321
Gosh, I haven't seen you
for ages.

308
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,726
Hey, guys.

309
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,995
I'm sorry, you've caught me
in the middle of a mad morning.

310
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,131
Um, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

311
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,599
Your mother didn't tell you?

312
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,467
My mother?

313
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,101
Yeah.

314
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,502
Oh, hey!

315
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,739
Oh, how great to see you two
in the same room again.

316
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:28,907
Hi.

317
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,910
So, did Matthew tell you
about his app?

318
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,545
It's been going so well
this guy's been sailing

319
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,779
all over the world.

320
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,416
Oh, how wonderful for you.

321
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,185
You know-I think

322
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,886
He's really remarkable.

323
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,390
Stanford Law grad,
fluent in three languages,

324
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,526
and the kids are crazy
about him.

325
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,196
Oy!

326
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,964
Are you kidding?!

327
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,334
Please behave!

328
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,635
What's going on here?

329
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,604
Your mom said you need
someone to watch the kids

330
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,872
and help out a little.

331
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,010
You're the nanny candidate.

332
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,445
Oh, mom.

333
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,380
In the kitchen, now.

334
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,349
Be right back.

335
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,250
Ok.

336
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,819
Just-don't go away.

337
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,525
What in heaven's name?!

338
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,026
Well, honey, I am sorry.

339
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,895
I looked everywhere.

340
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:28,766
Trust me, there is literally no
one else who will do this job.

341
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,302
<i>You don't have a lot of options,</i>
<i>sweetie.</i>

342
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,904
<i>Mom, this is ridiculous!</i>

343
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,341
Is this your dad?

344
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,942
Yeah.

345
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,143
He died.

346
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,746
Didn't know him,
but we hear stories.

347
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,617
Nice catch.

348
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,220
Sweetie, you've got no choice.

349
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,122
And Matthew's game!

350
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,257
You know him!

351
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,958
You know his family.

352
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,059
And besides,

353
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,161
it's way better than having
a stranger in the house.

354
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,162
Just sayin'.

355
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,865
I'm not having a man take care
of my children.

356
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,600
Especially one who could drop
everything on a whim

357
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,002
and just shove off to sea!

358
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,004
The answer is no,
absolutely not.

359
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:06,971
No.

360
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,579
I am so sorry.

361
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,415
This whole thing has been
a big misunderstanding.

362
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,317
No problem.

363
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,185
I'll just shove off then.

364
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,422
Oh, I-I didn't-
mean that the way it sounded.

365
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,691
It was good to see you again,
Cass.

366
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,998
Bye.

367
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,268
There. You happy now?

368
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,404
No. Are you?

369
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,244
Well, it's a classic backstab

370
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,513
from my "buddy"
from high school-

371
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,783
Who created his new company
using old code

372
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,553
that you wrote together,
12 years ago.

373
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,723
Ah, our superstar.

374
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,458
I'm just the wallpaper
around here.

375
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,728
No one plays high-stakes poker
better than Cass.

376
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,663
Good. Great.

377
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,198
I will warn you, though.

378
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,099
Benji's slippery.

379
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,567
Everything that we
invented together

380
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,768
he later claimed as his idea.

381
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,605
He's a world class... liar.

382
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,241
I specialize in exposing
the truth.

383
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,876
When Cass is done with this guy

384
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,380
he will fold like a deck chair
on the Titanic.

385
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,381
Benji deserves it.

386
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:27,185
I will warn you too that
I am intense, alright?

387
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:27,986
I have to win this.

388
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,587
Nay, I will win this.

389
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,289
You have our entire focus,
Adam.

390
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,591
Feel free to call Cass 24/7.

391
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,492
Oh yeah?

392
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,760
24... 7.

393
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,628
That's right.

394
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,064
Let's walk him through
our plan in detail.

395
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:40,798
Now?

396
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,066
No time like the present.

397
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,034
We caught a break
from the judge

398
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,402
and he moved up our date.

399
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,971
We head to court in four weeks.

400
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,674
That's um... so soon.

401
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,512
Do we have a problem
with that?

402
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,446
No, no, no.

403
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,314
Not at all.

404
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,582
Ok.

405
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,986
Cass, don't worry, I'm there
for you every step of the way.

406
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,621
So that's 250?

407
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,355
Yeah.

408
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,125
I just met Adam Haskey.

409
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,193
Who knew tech billionaires
could be so cute?

410
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,329
Not my type.

411
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,966
What is your type?

412
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,803
Times New Roman.

413
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,937
Is there something else?

414
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,106
Yes, you told me to remind
you when it's 4:00.

415
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,674
Time to pick the kids up
from school.

416
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,842
It's 4:00 already?

417
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,110
Woah, woah, woah.

418
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:30,448
You-you have to go now?

419
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,283
Just give me two minutes.

420
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,718
Hello?

421
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,453
Mom, I need you to go and
pick up the kids right now,

422
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,355
I cannot make it to school.

423
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,089
<i>Just breathe, honey.</i>

424
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,058
<i>I'll get someone to cover me.</i>

425
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,459
Of course I'll pick up the kids.

426
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,994
<i>But we can't keep doing this.</i>

427
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>And we do have a solution,</i>
<i>Matthew, is the answer.</i>

428
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,947
Matthew?

429
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,484
Matthew, are you... home?

430
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,086
<i>Hello.</i>

431
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,220
Hi.

432
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,489
Cass, hey.

433
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,524
Uh, I wasn't expecting you.

434
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,226
Hi.

435
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,462
I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

436
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,197
You know, my mother really
caught me off-guard.

437
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,133
She likes to throw
those curve balls.

438
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,535
And um... I know that you heard
some things

439
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,672
that probably didn't come out
quite right.

440
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,440
Is that right?

441
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,408
Yes.

442
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,245
Um... I-I didn't mean
to offend you.

443
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,746
What are you doing?

444
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,917
Oh, I just had to document
that moment.

445
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,820
I mean, in high school we would
have killed for evidence

446
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,124
of adult you admitting
you were wrong.

447
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,859
That is so grown up of you.

448
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,694
I'm just kidding.

449
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,629
Is this a joke to you?

450
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,164
Because it's not to me.

451
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,632
I have two children,
I have a career,

452
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,600
I have responsibilities

453
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,435
and I am barely keeping
my head above water.

454
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,104
So what you're saying is...

455
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,873
you need my help.

456
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,008
Just for a short time.

457
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,676
Until I find a proper nanny.

458
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,146
Fair enough.

459
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,881
Why do you want this job?

460
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,782
Your mom said you needed
a hand

461
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,219
and I'd just like to help
you out.

462
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,888
Ok, it was either your kids

463
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,724
or my father lecture me
every day.

464
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,858
They never stop, do they?

465
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,961
No, they don't.

466
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,163
Great.

467
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,132
I'll um... see you first thing
tomorrow morning.

468
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,767
First thing.

469
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,652
honks )

470
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,827
Why am I not surprised?

471
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,568
Great car.

472
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,303
She is a classic, right?

473
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,804
She sure is.

474
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,575
And no child of mine will be
riding in that death trap.

475
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,710
Your new hot rod.

476
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:17,682
Seven seats, extra room
for groceries and air bags.

477
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,150
What else does a man need?

478
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,118
You mean manny?

479
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,221
Uh, no. I don't.

480
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,490
Come in.

481
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,026
The weekly agenda,
broken down by day.

482
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,962
Love it, learn it,
stick to it.

483
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,029
Wow.

484
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,298
It's like you're running
the UN General Assembly.

485
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,601
Thank you.

486
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,303
And also, does Tuesday
always come before Monday

487
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,605
in this house?

488
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,141
Ooh, heads are going to roll.

489
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,676
Oh, no. I'll get that.

490
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,716
Yellow are activities,

491
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,352
lime are meals and
white is downtime.

492
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,120
I don't see too many whites.

493
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,689
Ooh, the telephone.

494
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,925
Uh, this is synced
to an online calendar

495
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,560
so you're gonna get alerts.

496
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,731
It plays a chime, buzzer,
and taps if you're late.

497
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,767
Any questions?

498
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,636
Uh, just one.

499
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,237
Does it come in black?

500
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,905
No.

501
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,441
Ok, sergeant.

502
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,309
What's next?

503
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,910
Follow me.

504
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,350
And these are your
accommodations.

505
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,119
Make yourself at home.

506
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,023
Oh, I love it.

507
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,624
Yeah.

508
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,227
But um, where's Snow White
gonna stay?

509
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,462
I'll let you get settled.

510
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,070
Nice try, guys!

511
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,238
But you missed.

512
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,811
Well played.

513
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,646
Well played!

514
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,089
Hey there.

515
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,924
Hey. You all moved in?

516
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,161
Uh, yep. I travel light.

517
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:13,431
What's that?

518
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,401
That's Emma practicing
her violin.

519
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,470
She's relentless.

520
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,438
Wonder where she gets that.

521
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,405
Excuse me?

522
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,740
Hmm? Nothing.

523
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:23,941
I'll just uh...

524
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,343
Oh, you know,
while you're here,

525
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,246
would you mind getting the kids'
lunches started for tomorrow?

526
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,016
It's best to do it
the night before.

527
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,950
Lunches, check.

528
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,385
Not that simple.

529
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,287
Let me show you.

530
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:42,093
We keep a clean, organic,
farm-to-table house.

531
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,595
Proteins are free-range
and grass-fed.

532
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,896
Only natural sugars.

533
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,335
Mostly fruits.

534
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,203
Mmm.

535
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,237
Nutrition's a given.

536
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,606
But it can't come at the expense

537
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,542
of their basic relationship
to food.

538
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:03,781
You mean eating?

539
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,882
I'll get you started.

540
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,384
No, it's ok.

541
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,920
I've kept myself alive on a boat
for months at a time.

542
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,656
I think I can handle
a bag lunch.

543
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,960
Ok. I guess we'll see.

544
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,495
Guess we will.

545
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,248
Good morning.

546
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,549
Morning.

547
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,583
The coffee's brewing,

548
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,685
breakfast is on and lunches
are in the pantry.

549
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,822
Everyone is going to be
a happy camper.

550
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,392
What lunches?

551
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,227
What?

552
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,696
Where did they go?

553
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,765
Because they were waiting
right here on the shelf.

554
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,001
Anybody care to explain?

555
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:04,141
Here's $10. Buy lunch.

556
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,743
They won round one.

557
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,711
<i>Don't you two do that again.</i>

558
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:08,345
Ok, I gotta go.

559
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,847
<i>I love you guys.</i>

560
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,285
Are you gonna be alright?

561
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,653
Go. Defend the good guys.

562
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,122
Please do not let them
be late to school.

563
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,557
Je t'aime plus que le monde.

564
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,758
Je t'aime brasse.

565
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,662
<i>My little cherubs.</i>

566
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,085
Alright.

567
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,520
We need to go over a few
ground rules.

568
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,754
I am not your normal nanny

569
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,957
and your usual tricks aren't
gonna work on me.

570
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,624
What tricks?

571
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,225
We weren't-

572
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,025
Da-da-da.

573
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,660
Just remember:
if you annoy me,

574
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,895
I'm gonna leave and
then you'll be stuck

575
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,630
with someone
boring again, ok?

576
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,566
So if you want this arrangement
to continue,

577
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,001
get with the program.

578
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,436
Are we clear?

579
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,770
We're clear.

580
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,874
Great.

581
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,976
Where's your school again?

582
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,945
I just programmed it
into the GPS.

583
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,780
Ok.

584
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,516
I'm liking this truce already,
guys.

585
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,950
Teamwork.

586
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:24,522
<i>So, you guys think we should</i>
<i>sing, or listen to the radio?</i>

587
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,557
<i> Take the next right.</i>

588
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,325
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

589
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,528
<i>gently down the stream...</i>

590
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,495
<i>How old do you</i>
<i>think we are?</i>

591
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,696
<i>This is so lame.</i>

592
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,031
<i>It's painful.</i>

593
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,336
<i> You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

594
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,874
Hilarious.

595
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,495
Oh, and uh... I'll be watching
you both walk inside

596
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,964
so no funny business.

597
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,099
I don't need school, I'm going
to be a famous violinist

598
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,802
and study in Paris
when I grow up.

599
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,203
Oh, that's cool.

600
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,806
But we live in the here
and now so get out.

601
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,446
Go!

602
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,716
I was gonna say you're nice,
but forget it!

603
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,361
iles,

604
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,362
maybe we could order in.

605
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,697
I can't tonight.

606
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,298
The kids have a new nanny
and I have to make sure

607
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,933
the house hasn't burned
to the ground.

608
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,035
Ok, well there's a lot to do.

609
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,670
What about-do you have
a home office?

610
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,773
We could do it there.

611
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,042
You're right.

612
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,244
Two birds with one stone.

613
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,646
Done.

614
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,123
See, now this is my idea of fun.

615
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,758
Or torture.

616
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,293
What, you don't like climbing?

617
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,464
You guys are really late.

618
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,799
Red team, hustle on the
line for a warm-up climb.

619
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:16,967
Blue team, you're on
the little boulder.

620
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:18,869
Let's go!

621
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:19,536
Be cool.

622
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,472
Don't embarrass us.

623
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,906
Yeah.

624
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,545
Hey, so uh... you know I
free climbed Denali once.

625
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,680
If you need any help...

626
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:30,881
Sir, if you could please wait
in the viewing section

627
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,050
with the other parents...

628
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,652
Oh, no, I'm not their parent.

629
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:40,658
I'm their male...
supervision expert...

630
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,792
Ok...

631
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:49,366
Just over... there?

632
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,934
Yeah, good job Emma!

633
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:51,435
Whoo!

634
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,504
Monkey it up!

635
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:54,538
You are a natural!

636
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,140
Hey kid, go for gold!

637
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,408
That's right!

638
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,108
Whew!

639
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,610
Spiderman got nothing on you!

640
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,544
You know?

641
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,545
Emma McKay,
ladies and gentlemen.

642
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,980
Whoo!

643
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,517
Yeah!

644
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,388
Come on, Quinn.

645
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,322
You can do it.

646
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,124
I'm trying.

647
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,292
Let's go down.

648
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,130
There you go.

649
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,699
Take a minute?

650
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,074
Hey, bud.

651
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,208
What's the problem?

652
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,910
Nothing.

653
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,611
Doesn't look like nothing.

654
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,780
You know, even pros have
off days.

655
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,515
I'm not having an off day.

656
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,084
It's just...

657
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,385
I'm not good.

658
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,953
That's why you're
taking lessons.

659
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,188
Forget it.

660
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,890
I just want to go home.

661
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,725
Quinn, buddy.

662
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,727
Come on.

663
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,528
Great job, rookie.

664
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,567
Woah, that was fast.

665
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,070
All in a day's work.

666
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,906
I don't think my mom's gonna
consider this an improvement.

667
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,074
It's blocking the view.

668
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,976
She likes everything
in it's proper place.

669
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,277
Oh, I know.

670
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,412
I've seen the board.

671
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,380
Wanna give it a go?

672
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,015
No thanks.

673
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,785
"Home made climbing wall"
is not on the schedule.

674
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,952
I have to go practice.

675
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,155
Hey, I heard you playing
the other night.

676
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,123
You are quite the musician.

677
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,958
Do you play in a band
or an orchestra?

678
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,194
I prefer being a soloist.

679
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,162
Oh yeah? Why is that?

680
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,464
Because other people
make mistakes.

681
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,999
Wow.

682
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,967
You really are a chip
off the old mom.

683
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,102
Huh.

684
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,770
Look, you guys need to be open
to new possibilities.

685
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,704
Have a little fun!

686
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,940
Torturing you is fun.

687
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,478
What are you doing?!

688
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,245
Good luck.

689
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,480
Nice knowing you.

690
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,384
What is this eyesore?

691
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,586
I just built a little climbing
run for Quinn.

692
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,389
And you're welcome.

693
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,292
You built a ten-foot...
fourteen-foot wall

694
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,327
in the middle of my lawn.

695
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,296
This is a harmonized
landscape.

696
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,764
Get that thing down immediately.

697
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,934
Look, your son needs help.

698
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,969
What are you talking about?

699
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,037
He hates climbing,

700
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,072
and it's obvious
that he's afraid of it.

701
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:45,909
This "eyesore" is gonna help
build his confidence.

702
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,247
Fine.

703
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,082
Can you just make sure
it can come down as easily

704
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,718
as it's gone up?

705
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,155
Will do.

706
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:11,869
Hey.

707
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,237
Come on in.

708
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,939
Sorry, I um...

709
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,741
I thought this was uh...

710
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:18,542
Oh, no, no.

711
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,476
You're here for Cass?

712
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,677
I'm Matthew.

713
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,779
Our manny.

714
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,716
I prefer "professional
helper man".

715
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,153
Hey, Henry, I have everything
set up here in the office.

716
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,121
How's dinner coming along?

717
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,824
I just started,
so... great.

718
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,359
Ok.

719
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,295
Yeah.

720
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,198
Come on.

721
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:44,868
Who wants to play a game?

722
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,502
Huh?

723
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,170
Eye Spy?

724
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,505
Or Once Upon a Time?

725
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,240
We're not six years old.

726
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,375
Those are baby games.

727
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,876
What?

728
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,612
Once Upon a Time is a contest
of lyrical prowess.

729
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,648
I mean, how do you think Jay-Z
got his start?

730
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:58,849
No. No.

731
00:31:58,883 --> 00:31:59,850
No.

732
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,652
Listen, I have swapped verse
with wise men

733
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,254
from Singapore to San Francisco.

734
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,889
Once upon a time there
was a manny

735
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,026
who dropped pizza crumbs
into every nook and cranny.

736
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,527
He knew he would
be fine though,

737
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,195
because he had a broom,

738
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,600
and two kids to help him or
they'd get sent to their room.

739
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,101
You better move fast though,

740
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,138
because mom's coming soon.

741
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,506
I'll allow it.

742
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,342
Now, the first one who messes up
the rhyme is out, ok?

743
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,209
Once up-

744
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,046
Did a bomb go off in here?

745
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,981
What happened to my
Asian chicken tostadas?

746
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,616
Uh, yeah.

747
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,518
They didn't happen.

748
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,955
But there's plenty of pizza
if you're staying, Henry.

749
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,792
No, um, thank you, Matthew.

750
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,126
Look, why don't
we just finish up the review

751
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,328
at the office
in the morning?

752
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,697
That's a good idea.
Thank you.

753
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,265
You're welcome.

754
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,269
Pizza? Seriously?

755
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,838
That is not on my
approved list of foods.

756
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,908
The crust is gluten free
if you wanna try.

757
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,776
Hey mom, we're playing
Once Upon a Time.

758
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,677
Join us.

759
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,012
I don't think I know that one.

760
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,448
You do rhymes
until someone messes up.

761
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,350
I'll show you.

762
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,785
Once upon a time there
was a dog,

763
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,687
who never just walked
when he could jog.

764
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,425
Now it's your turn.

765
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,832
Ok.

766
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:27,604
He was a cute dog,
but he needed a trim.

767
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,808
A sensible schedule
was hard for him.

768
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,143
Hmm.

769
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,013
Well, the dog was just trying
to please his master,

770
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,815
who always said "do it cleaner,
and faster!"

771
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,628
Oh, lord. This client
never stops.

772
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,295
Huh.

773
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,363
Sounds like someone I know.

774
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,766
Send already.

775
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,300
Send!

776
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,936
Hey, was it always like this?

777
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:04,408
You know,
before their dad uh...

778
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,443
You can say "died".

779
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,579
And his name was Elliott.

780
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:13,316
No, it wasn't always like this.

781
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,553
I actually had someone
I could lean on.

782
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,422
Was it hard on the kids?

783
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,957
You know, they were so young

784
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,659
they really don't remember,

785
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:25,195
but as Emma gets older
she uh...

786
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,865
she asks more and more.

787
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,203
All they really need is you.

788
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,539
I'm trying to fill the void.

789
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,009
I want them to have everything.

790
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,544
And what about you?

791
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,013
What do you get to have?

792
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:48,318
I don't follow.

793
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,520
Can I get you a glass of wine?

794
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,594
I am exhausted.

795
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,062
I have to go to bed.

796
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,164
I understand.

797
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,633
But you help yourself.

798
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,801
Goodnight.

799
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,437
Goodnight.

800
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,372
Oh, do you know the schedule
for tomorrow?

801
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,508
Uh, no.

802
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,310
But I'll stick to it.

803
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:35,832
Good job.

804
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,612
So let me get this straight.

805
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,881
You play in a padded cell
for an hour?

806
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,883
It's not a cell,
it's a practice room.

807
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,050
Tomato, tomato.

808
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,418
But check this out.

809
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,786
Talent show.

810
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,289
You might make some friends.

811
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,891
Friends are human beings

812
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,792
who you share a common bond with
and-

813
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,793
Ha ha.

814
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,428
There's no way I'm entering
a talent show.

815
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,832
Because you might make
a mistake on stage?

816
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,634
It's good to put yourself
out there.

817
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,434
Ok, listen.

818
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,702
When I was a kid-

819
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,005
What is it gonna take to get to
the end of this conversation?

820
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,106
A simple "yes".

821
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,609
How about a definite "maybe"?

822
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,344
Ok, fine. I'll do it.

823
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:21,912
Better.

824
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,313
Alright, let's go.

825
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,287
Well Benji, I see that your
manners haven't improved

826
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,055
over the last ten years,

827
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,225
along with your views
on intellectual property.

828
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,595
Mr. Shepherd, did you use
my client's old code

829
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,130
for your new start-up?

830
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,565
Programming is an art.

831
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,700
You borrow from the masters.

832
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,202
Like how Adam's
last two products,

833
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,570
they borrow from me.

834
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,538
That's rich. That's really rich.

835
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,407
Gentlemen, let's just stay
on point.

836
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,877
Great ideas are all around us,
just floating in the air.

837
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,679
You own the air, Adam?

838
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,415
Just the air that you breathed
when we worked together, buddy.

839
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,983
You want half of everything?

840
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,821
Here.

841
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,323
I have nothing to hide.

842
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,625
If you have nothing to hide
then why have you and your team

843
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,695
not responded to our request
for discovery?

844
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,532
You want documents?

845
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,299
Mmmhmm.

846
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,901
You got 'em.

847
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,736
Oh, hey guys.

848
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,004
Mom's building a fort.

849
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,973
Oh, Henry.

850
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:23,540
Ah, ah, ah.

851
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,808
Guys, don't touch.

852
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,376
And hello, did you have
a great day?

853
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:26,977
Yeah.

854
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:27,777
It was ok.

855
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:28,912
Great!

856
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,880
Love you both.

857
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,916
Outside and play.

858
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,185
So, what is all this?

859
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,321
Uh, the plaintiff's trying
to bury us in paperwork.

860
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,057
Photos, bank statements...

861
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,392
you name it, it's in here.

862
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,161
The only thing missing
are his baby teeth.

863
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,029
Well, I could help.

864
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,464
I know a thing or two
about the law.

865
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,867
You know, sometimes a little
knowledge can be dangerous.

866
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,136
I finished Stanford Law.

867
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,438
I was smart enough not
to become a lawyer.

868
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,375
Well, aren't you the most
decorated manny on the block?

869
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,576
Ha!

870
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,249
Please don't touch that.

871
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,219
I hope you're ok with
taking orders all day.

872
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:14,024
Actually, um... you know,
Cass and I make a great team.

873
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,359
Don't we, Cass?

874
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,827
Can we focus?

875
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,596
We have ten days before trial
and we have to sift through

876
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,599
all of this with a fine-toothed
comb.

877
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,167
I'm all yours.

878
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,470
Don't the uh...

879
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,873
the kids need
a little snack or something?

880
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:30,573
Sure.

881
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,808
Can I get you anything?

882
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,344
Coffee? Tea?

883
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,745
In a sippy cup?

884
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,686
I want to stop.

885
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,387
Come on, one more time.

886
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,789
I'm right here, I will not
let you fall.

887
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,224
No.

888
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,426
Ok.

889
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,535
You know what?

890
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,669
I'm gonna give you something

891
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,706
that's kept me safe
over the years.

892
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,708
I've had this on a dozen summits

893
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,278
and across an ocean and back.

894
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,879
Does it really work?

895
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,815
Well, I'm still here.

896
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,317
But you uh, you
better tuck it in.

897
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,685
Otherwise you'll look like
a geek.

898
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,920
Hi guys!

899
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,021
Hey, grandma.

900
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,222
Look at this!

901
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,190
Hi.

902
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:20,924
Wow.

903
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,026
Why don't we take five?

904
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,260
Awesome wall.

905
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,096
Give me a hug!

906
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,963
I love ya.

907
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,298
You too.

908
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,203
Do you want this back?

909
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,637
No, buddy.

910
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,139
You keep it.

911
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,774
Thanks.

912
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,812
So, how's it going here?

913
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,180
I'm doing my best.

914
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,615
Cass is pretty intense,

915
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,150
but she's under
a lot of pressure.

916
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,419
Yeah, but so are you.

917
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,888
There's a marina at stake.

918
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:55,525
Well, where is my
high-maintenance Scorpio?

919
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,627
She's inside with um...

920
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,863
Henry from the office.

921
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,774
Seems like a nice guy.

922
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,076
Oh, I... I don't know
about that.

923
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,677
He's...

924
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,860
Oh no.

925
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,363
Didn't anyone tell you?

926
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,998
Tell me what?

927
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,834
It's Sunday.

928
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,302
Try telling my client that.

929
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,904
Come on, it's nice out.

930
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,373
It's a perfect day
for a family outing.

931
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,709
Yeah, grab some sunshine for me
and tell the trees I say hello.

932
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,278
Uh, I said "family outing".

933
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,681
It's right there
on the big board.

934
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,783
Are you using the board
against me?

935
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,419
Well, the law applies
equally to all.

936
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,288
And I planned a little adventure
for us, alright?

937
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,824
It's time for everyone to come
to my house for a change.

938
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,892
Dude, you live on a boat.

939
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,461
Exactly.

940
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,161
Alright?

941
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,563
It'll be fun.

942
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,632
Unless you're too afraid to step
outside your comfort zone.

943
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:14,604
I'm just sayin'.

944
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,242
Are you excited, bud?

945
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,243
Yeah.

946
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,444
Yeah.

947
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,712
I'm kinda scared.

948
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,515
You don't have to worry,
you're going to love sailing.

949
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,350
All aboard!

950
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,084
Here we go.

951
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,786
Ok, careful.

952
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,120
Atta boy.

953
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:33,556
Alright.

954
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,457
Young lady.

955
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,326
Watch your step.

956
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,727
Madam.

957
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,862
Thank you.

958
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,730
Improvement.

959
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:41,631
Huh?

960
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,765
Improvement.

961
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,234
Oh, yeah.

962
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,736
The proper shoes.

963
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,973
So, let me show you
around my living room.

964
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,442
Those are my curtains.

965
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,143
That one we call the main sail.

966
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,513
It's the one that helps us catch
the wind and go fast.

967
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,281
It's attached to the boat
by the boom,

968
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,517
and up front we have the jib.

969
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:04,621
But the main sail is the most
important thing on this lady.

970
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,422
The boat is a lady?

971
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,558
All boats are ladies,
Quinn,

972
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,028
and like ladies they require
gentle handling and respect.

973
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,830
Ooh, you're good.

974
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,431
Thought you'd like that.

975
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,733
Where do you eat on this thing?

976
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:17,634
Or go to the bathroom?

977
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,402
Or sleep?

978
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,170
Down there, in the cabin.

979
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,171
Can we go see?

980
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,941
Sure. As long as your mom
thinks it's cool.

981
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,776
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

982
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,745
Don't break anything.

983
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:34,417
I think we got a couple of
sailors on our hands.

984
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,119
Yeah?

985
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,155
Probably not.

986
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,491
You seem pretty comfortable
on the water though.

987
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,826
Pirate in a previous life,
maybe?

988
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:48,164
I always thought your father
and you were the pirates.

989
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,734
Uh, yeah, he racked up a lot
of treasure.

990
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,469
Is he the uh...

991
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,706
the reason that you chose
to leave?

992
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,408
He cast a pretty big shadow.

993
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,143
I needed to find my own way.

994
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,911
Did you?

995
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,348
I'm still looking.

996
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,650
Uh oh, smells like rain.

997
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,953
Maybe we shouldn't
sail today.

998
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,120
Here.

999
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:11,888
Oh, no, no.

1000
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:12,855
I'm fine.

1001
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,157
Thanks, Mr. Weathervane.

1002
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,730
Ugh.

1003
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,333
Hey, uh, can I-

1004
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:27,236
Just take care of the kids so
I can write this brief, please?

1005
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,138
You're never gonna get better
if you don't get some rest.

1006
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,408
I know, thank you,
but I don't have time.

1007
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,813
Ok.

1008
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,639
No.

1009
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:10,673
Oh no!

1010
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,042
Good morning.

1011
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,911
You let me sleep!

1012
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:18,114
My brief is due this morning.

1013
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:22,285
Here's some freshly squeezed
vitamin C,

1014
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,187
and some reading material.

1015
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,092
Wh... what's this?

1016
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,960
I remembered a few things
from law school.

1017
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,904
What...

1018
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,641
I wanna come down.

1019
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,009
Ok.

1020
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,349
Good job.

1021
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:58,554
Ok, so next time we'll
just go a little higher.

1022
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,556
Matthew!

1023
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,624
I- you know what?

1024
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,960
I'm... sorry I stuck my nose
in your business...

1025
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,529
No, it's good!

1026
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,397
Thank you.

1027
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,699
You're welcome.

1028
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,300
I just don't really understand

1029
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,703
why you didn't become
a lawyer because...

1030
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,605
you've really got
a knack for this.

1031
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,140
Nah, law's too black
and white for me.

1032
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,775
I'm more of a win-win
kinda guy.

1033
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,179
Ah!

1034
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,814
I gotta run.

1035
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,582
I love you guys!

1036
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,585
Not you, you.

1037
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,821
Anyway, um... bye.

1038
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,689
<i>Love you.</i>

1039
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,860
So, school it is.

1040
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:38,795
Let's go.

1041
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,436
Au revoir, mon chére nounou.

1042
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,971
A tout a l'heure.

1043
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:49,839
You know French?

1044
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,574
Mais, oui.

1045
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,509
And don't call me "nanny".

1046
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,880
She's obsessed with Paris.

1047
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,685
Run!

1048
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,372
Hey, gang.

1049
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,440
How'd it go?

1050
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:25,908
It was school.

1051
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,511
Right.

1052
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,146
So I've checked
the schedule.

1053
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,515
Next up: ballroom dancing!

1054
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,450
It's so boring.

1055
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:35,918
We don't wanna go.

1056
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:36,786
What?

1057
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,021
You don't wanna go to-

1058
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,156
why are we going?

1059
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,390
Because it's on
the schedule.

1060
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,391
You know what?

1061
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,827
I've had just about enough
of that schedule.

1062
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,330
Let's throw the cards
in the air for a change.

1063
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,232
Where are we going?

1064
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,334
Supplies.

1065
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:54,237
Hey!

1066
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,738
You got me!

1067
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,047
Ooh, you turned on each other!

1068
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,749
Yes!

1069
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,286
Oh!

1070
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,722
I'm out!

1071
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,425
You're mine!

1072
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,961
What on earth are
you doing?!

1073
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,796
You're supposed to be
at ballroom dancing!

1074
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,565
You're supposed to be
at work.

1075
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,100
I'm still wearing my bow-tie.

1076
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,568
Does that count?

1077
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,169
Don't you get sassy with me!

1078
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,438
Sometimes you just gotta tear up
the schedule!

1079
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:31,307
Matthew!

1080
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,909
Oops!

1081
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,912
You are so busted.

1082
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,485
I think you made her brain snap.

1083
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,821
I'll show you "oops".

1084
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:46,956
Uh oh.

1085
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,363
Oh.

1086
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,665
Oh.

1087
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,835
Girls against the boys!

1088
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,883
Protect the little one!

1089
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,962
Cass?

1090
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:26,696
What are you-

1091
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,430
Watch out!

1092
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,264
It's a war zone!

1093
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:29,198
Mom, duck!

1094
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,137
Sorry.

1095
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,407
I'm uh... I'm fine.

1096
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,645
That was nuts!

1097
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,648
I have not done something
like that in ages.

1098
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,683
And my kids have good aim.

1099
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,585
That was your manny
that got me.

1100
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,021
Oh, you were a casualty
of war.

1101
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,656
It was friendly fire.

1102
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,092
I don't think that was
so friendly.

1103
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,194
Henry, it was just
a game.

1104
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,428
You know what?

1105
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,229
It's... it's fine.

1106
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,697
Don't-don't worry about.

1107
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,066
I- I can do the work
myself tonight

1108
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,836
while you hang out
and play.

1109
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:07,536
No, no.

1110
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,738
I'm good to go.

1111
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:09,605
Are you sure?

1112
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:10,706
Yes.

1113
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,409
Hey, uh, are you coming
back out?

1114
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:18,347
No, we have a deadline.

1115
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,349
Want me to get you a shirt?

1116
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,817
No.

1117
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,419
Thank you.

1118
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,755
Cass has it handled.

1119
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:41,971
Hey there.

1120
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,472
Hey.

1121
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,210
What have you done?

1122
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,580
Don't kill me.

1123
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,049
Manslaughter is
a long sentence.

1124
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:56,085
No, this would be
first degree murder.

1125
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,089
I just removed some specifics
we don't really need anymore.

1126
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,490
Do you have any idea
how long it took me

1127
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,858
to put this thing together?

1128
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:07,696
Think how much more time
you'll have now.

1129
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,731
What is your problem?

1130
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,166
I've been doing this
a couple of weeks

1131
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,835
and I think it could be good.

1132
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,303
Let's try and fly
without a net.

1133
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:14,970
And do what?

1134
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,772
Just not go to things?

1135
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,274
We'll go to things.

1136
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,976
But just in between those
things will be some wiggle room.

1137
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,878
Come on, give it a chance.

1138
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,418
I'll try.

1139
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,620
As an experiment.

1140
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:32,688
But I reserve the right

1141
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,723
to reinstate our
previous understanding

1142
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,959
at any given moment.

1143
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,127
Yes, counsellor.

1144
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,796
So you got me an
electric violin?

1145
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,031
What do you think?

1146
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,432
Try it.

1147
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,476
That was oddly cool.

1148
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,744
But it's a way
different beat.

1149
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,113
It's much faster.

1150
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,314
I'm one step ahead of you.

1151
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,815
Do you remember how I told you
I lived amongst the Maori

1152
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,549
for nine months?

1153
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,852
Please, not this again.

1154
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,720
Anyway, I learned
a thing or two.

1155
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,489
Scooch.

1156
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:09,825
Alright, I'm gonna be
the beat.

1157
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,261
You just do whatever
you want.

1158
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,796
Alright?

1159
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,584
Hey.

1160
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,453
Oh, I've gotta tell you.

1161
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,421
Your brief was so good

1162
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:43,092
the judge merged the
counter-suit into the case.

1163
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,195
Which is double the work,
but it's great news!

1164
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,129
That's great.

1165
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:52,234
So I was wondering
if you might consider

1166
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,704
helping me out again?

1167
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:59,842
But wouldn't you prefer
Henry help you out?

1168
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,877
He's a colleague.

1169
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,580
I think that he wants
to be more.

1170
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:08,684
Is that your manny intuition?

1171
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,920
I don't have time for dating.

1172
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,422
Well, I think there's room
in the schedule for it now.

1173
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,727
How do you get them to play
video games

1174
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,997
without arguing?

1175
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,134
I told them if their combined
score tops two million

1176
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,902
I'll play them
with my left hand.

1177
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,537
What they don't
know is that I'm ambidextrous,

1178
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,172
so it's kind of a win-win.

1179
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:35,477
Yeah, I don't know if I agree
with that win-win philosophy.

1180
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,079
I don't like to lose.

1181
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,581
Well, me neither,
but one person's gain

1182
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:40,382
doesn't have to be another
person's loss.

1183
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,483
Yeah, I'm a lawyer.

1184
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,151
Right.

1185
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,586
What's in that box?

1186
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,653
Uh, just some old stuff.

1187
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,122
Some letters, a napkin
with some scribbles on it,

1188
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:47,990
some old photos...

1189
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,826
Let me see the photos.

1190
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,494
Thanks.

1191
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,701
Check this out.

1192
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,406
Ooh.

1193
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,409
Good find.

1194
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,345
I could work with this.

1195
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,614
You're welcome.

1196
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,858
What do you see when
you look at this picture?

1197
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:27,296
Two billionaires fighting over
a million and bragging rights?

1198
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,430
I don't know.

1199
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,399
Yep, that's what I see, too.

1200
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,869
But what if it's really
two competitive friends

1201
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:37,006
who won't back down?

1202
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,974
A little hunch.

1203
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,417
So what do you think
if the alligator

1204
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:52,755
is eating this giant flower?

1205
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,023
Hey guys.

1206
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,557
Check it out.

1207
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,427
It's a fortress for elves
and stormtroopers.

1208
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,628
You're such a nerd.

1209
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:03,232
Hey.

1210
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,733
Can I play?

1211
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:05,501
Come on.

1212
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,069
Of course you can.

1213
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,813
What's that look?

1214
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,315
Nothing.

1215
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,685
It's just nice to see you
hanging out.

1216
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,320
And I know what this is.

1217
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,392
Down time.

1218
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,460
Saturday.

1219
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,401
Hello?

1220
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,305
Oh no.

1221
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,207
I forgot about that.

1222
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,909
Ok.

1223
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,311
Yep, on my way.

1224
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,413
Wait.

1225
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,749
It was great while it lasted.

1226
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,721
Henry needs me at the office.

1227
00:55:58,755 --> 00:55:59,855
Henry.

1228
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,223
Ok.

1229
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,159
It was fun.

1230
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,260
Love you.

1231
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,496
Love you.

1232
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,497
Bye, mom.

1233
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,998
<i>I'll miss you guys.</i>

1234
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,410
Whatcha doin'?

1235
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,645
Oh, sweet.

1236
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,854
She looks happy.

1237
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,656
Paris was mom's favourite place
when she was younger.

1238
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:38,160
She always used to go there
with my dad.

1239
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,129
Have you been to Paris?

1240
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,096
I have, yeah.

1241
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,532
It's beautiful.

1242
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,900
My mom says every
cobblestone street

1243
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,869
has a tale to tell.

1244
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,771
And love is everywhere.

1245
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,406
Whatever that means.

1246
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,143
You really want to go there,
huh?

1247
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,378
More than anything.

1248
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,913
If I were to go there
with my mom,

1249
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:01,350
it would be the greatest.

1250
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,085
I have an idea.

1251
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,387
You can't go to Paris
right now,

1252
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,056
but what if Paris
came to you?

1253
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,540
This is extraordinary!

Alright, here we go, buddy.

1269
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,790
Here we go.

1270
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,295
Are you looking?

1271
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,663
Yes!

1272
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,365
I'm climbing the Eiffel Tower.

Oh, be careful, baby.

1274
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,702
I'm almost there.

1275
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,303
We've been practicing.

1276
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:30,806
Atta boy.

1277
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,242
Woo hoo!

1278
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:33,976
Alright, you ready?

1279
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:34,977
Yep.

1280
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,678
Alright, come on down.

1281
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,250
Look at you go!

1282
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,752
I am so proud of you.

1283
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,921
Thank you.

1284
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,964
May I have this dance?

1285
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:29,865
What's the matter?

1286
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,667
I just need a minute.

1287
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,675
She'll be right back.

1288
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:57,693
Hey, you ok?

1289
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,094
Paris is getting cold out there.

1290
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,596
I'm fine.

1291
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:08,170
I just got a little overwhelmed.

1292
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,939
All the music and Paris
and...

1293
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,641
I'm sorry.

1294
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:13,842
I didn't think this through.

1295
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,812
The kids were so excited and
I wanted to make you happy.

1296
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,048
I am.

1297
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,651
I just have a really funny way
of showing it.

1298
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,130
Mom?

1299
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,470
Come here, my angels.

1300
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,038
Oooh.

1301
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,708
Thank you.

1302
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,686
Everything ok?

1303
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,490
I just heard a rumour you
reached out to opposing council

1304
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,793
offering an olive branch
asking to settle?

1305
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,128
No, not exactly.

1306
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,530
I was uh... exploring
something that-

1307
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,065
You can't be serious.

1308
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,134
We landed this case
because we promised

1309
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,802
to take no prisoners.

1310
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,070
Vincent, I-

1311
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,506
Adam is going to fire us if we
don't give him what he wants.

1312
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,307
We go to trial in three days.

1313
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,942
He hired a tiger.

1314
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,979
I need to know, is she going
to deliver?

1315
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,714
She will.

1316
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,282
She better.

1317
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,086
Forget what I said, Howard.

1318
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
Bring a stretcher to court

1319
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,790
because you're not getting
out of there alive!

1320
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:35,724
Matthew called.

1321
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:37,526
Something about a barbecue
of some kind.

1322
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,460
Should I call to cancel?

1323
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,028
No, no, I'll make it.

1324
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,164
Ok, go and get Henry.

1325
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,265
I need all the depositions.

1326
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,567
Hold my calls, we're going
to Defcon three.

1327
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:46,835
Got it.

1328
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,309
What a treat.

1329
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,111
A home cooked meal
cooked on land.

1330
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:56,912
Yeah.

1331
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,513
Thank you for inviting us,
Matthew.

1332
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,448
Oh, my pleasure.

1333
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,516
Now, where are
my sous chefs at?

1334
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,521
Let's assembly line the heck
out of this thing, alright?

1335
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,192
Shouldn't we wait for mom?

1336
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,727
She'll be home soon.

1337
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:12,627
Let's eat!

1338
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,163
Oh, those smell so good.

1339
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:15,964
Ok, pass off.

1340
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:16,631
Go.

1341
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:17,432
Here.

1342
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,168
Oh, you guys make
a great team.

1343
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,303
It looks like our plan worked.

1344
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,438
The kids are crazy about him.

1345
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,240
Matthew might win
this bet after all.

1346
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,075
I wouldn't count on it
just yet.

1347
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,543
I know my son.

1348
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,178
He might sail off
before it's over.

1349
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,813
What bet?

1350
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,082
Bet?

1351
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,651
Oh, I didn't say "bet",
I said "get".

1352
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,121
Get Charles a burger, ok?

1353
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,189
Your wish is my command.

1354
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,060
There you go.

1355
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,430
Hey, Quinn.

1356
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,865
You ok?

1357
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,768
Yeah, I just wish mom
was here.

1358
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,439
Oh.

1359
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:59,207
Alright, let's eat.

1360
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,279
What time is it?

1361
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:07,783
Uh, I don't know... 9:00?

1362
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:08,717
No!

1363
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,051
Oh...

1364
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,052
What?

1365
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:14,256
The barbecue.

1366
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,158
9:00? The kids are in bed.

1367
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:19,594
Oh, isn't anything going
to go right today?

1368
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,595
It's late, ok?

1369
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,264
Um, you're tired.

1370
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,865
Why don't I drive you home?

1371
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,234
We'll go over the rest
of the case in the car.

1372
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,446
Oh, thank you
for dropping me off.

1373
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,849
Cass, don't think
twice about it.

1374
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:45,120
Come on, you know
I'm always here for you.

1375
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,955
Which reminds me,

1376
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,658
the marina gala
is coming up.

1377
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,826
Do you wanna go?

1378
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,594
Oh, we have to.

1379
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:56,898
Vincent says it's mandatory,
and Haskey bought a table.

1380
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:00,802
Actually, I meant with me.

1381
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,304
Oh.

1382
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,540
Yeah, we could do that.

1383
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,375
Great.

1384
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:14,583
G'night!

1385
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,482
Hi sweetie.

1386
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:52,487
I'm so sorry I missed
the barbecue.

1387
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:55,190
You know, I really wanted
to be there.

1388
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,993
It's ok.

1389
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:01,663
Matthew was there.

1390
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:08,837
Is Matthew gonna leave
if he wins his bet?

1391
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,639
What are you talking about?

1392
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,382
Oh, she returns.

1393
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,284
Slammed at work,
were we?

1394
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,385
Yes, I was.

1395
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,920
Henry and I had a
ton of work to do.

1396
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,154
Yeah. Henry.

1397
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:28,056
Yeah. Henry.

1398
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,725
This is a very important case
to us.

1399
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,293
To me.

1400
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:32,527
I could make partner.

1401
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,095
Great.

1402
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,097
I don't need to explain myself.

1403
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:39,501
What is this that I'm hearing
about a bet?

1404
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,036
Bet?

1405
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,103
It's nothing, ok?

1406
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,606
Oh, it's something if it
involves me and my family.

1407
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,875
It's not how it sounds.

1408
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,944
My dad was gonna build condos
at the marina,

1409
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,078
and I had to stop him,

1410
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,747
and the only way I could do it
was by taking the job.

1411
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,549
To prove what?

1412
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,885
That you could take care
of my kids?

1413
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,521
That's not how it went,
Cass.

1414
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:01,222
So my children were pawns

1415
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,458
in your power struggle
with your father?

1416
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,026
Please!

1417
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:06,161
You know how I feel about
Emma and Quinn.

1418
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:06,962
Don't even bring them-

1419
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:07,595
You know what?

1420
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,964
You are still the same

1421
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:12,334
immature, irresponsible guy
that I knew in high school.

1422
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,035
And you are still the
head strong, self-righteous

1423
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:14,970
individual who just-

1424
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,738
You don't get to lecture me!

1425
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,606
You're not letting me explain!

1426
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,642
Explain what?

1427
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:23,745
How you waltzed in here and
pulled one over on my family?

1428
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:25,347
At the start, the-

1429
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,781
everything has changed, ok?

1430
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,416
Oh, it's changed alright.

1431
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:29,751
You're fired.

1432
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:32,354
Cass, will you just-

1433
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:35,023
<i>Just pack your stuff</i>
<i>and leave!</i>

1434
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,597
She looks pretty, huh?

1435
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:49,738
Hey, what's going
on with you?

1436
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:52,807
I don't want to go to
the stupid talent show.

1437
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,842
Why not?

1438
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,643
You've been practicing
so hard.

1439
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,479
You're so good.

1440
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,081
Without Matthew
I'll screw up.

1441
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,984
I wish he was gonna come.

1442
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,853
He's not.

1443
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:08,323
Matthew's gone.

1444
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,826
Gone, but not forgotten.

1445
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:35,316
Mr. Sheperd, do you agree
that the code in question

1446
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:40,989
is the same code that you
developed with my client?

1447
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,124
I've written a million lines
of code over the years.

1448
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,326
I borrow from myself
all the time.

1449
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:46,694
Just answer the question.

1450
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,531
No, I don't agree.

1451
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,068
Uh, exhibit A please?

1452
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,474
A cocktail napkin?

1453
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:01,910
Yes, a cocktail napkin.

1454
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,711
It's also a signed contract

1455
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:08,483
which we received in discovery
from you.

1456
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:15,090
It says "All new inventions
will be owned by the company."

1457
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:17,058
Does that signature
look familiar?

1458
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,494
It should. It's yours.

1459
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:20,995
Yeah, it's mine.

1460
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,131
That proves that you were
under contract.

1461
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:23,832
No it doesn't.

1462
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,600
It's not dated.

1463
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,403
For all I know,
that was signed years

1464
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,905
after I started working
with Adam.

1465
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,241
That would mean
that everything

1466
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,910
I created before that
was mine.

1467
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,412
I thought that you
said she was a tiger.

1468
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,447
Just give her a minute.

1469
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:42,183
Uh, please could
you present exhibit B?

1470
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,088
Is this a photo of you
and the Plaintiff

1471
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:51,559
celebrating your first day,
in your first office?

1472
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,561
Yeah.

1473
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,131
Can we go in a little
closer please?

1474
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:04,339
Ah, the contract in question.

1475
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,508
Apparently it is dated.

1476
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,449
This proves that
Mr. Benjamin Sheperd

1477
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,585
was under contract
from the very first day

1478
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,188
that company was created.

1479
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,360
No further questions,
your honour.

1480
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,394
Yes.

1481
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:29,731
I told you she'd nail him,
right?

1482
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,332
We'll take a short recess.

1483
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,202
Look, I-it's too bad
that you're gonna have

1484
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:36,471
to lose millions over this.

1485
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:37,572
Yeah.

1486
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,274
All I wanted was for you
to just say that I was right

1487
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:43,011
and you were wrong for once,
you know?

1488
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:46,314
Well, congratulations.

1489
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,584
You're going to get
what you want.

1490
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,686
You were right.

1491
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:56,791
Ms. McKay.

1492
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:58,560
Your summation?

1493
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,234
You know,
during this case

1494
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:10,471
we have presented
rock solid evidence,

1495
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:14,842
stubborn facts,
stubborn people.

1496
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:20,448
These two people were friends
that have worked together,

1497
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,017
dreamed together,

1498
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,520
and have huge
success together.

1499
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,956
They have built
something much, much bigger

1500
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,791
than a company.

1501
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:32,293
They have shared history.

1502
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,262
A true friendship.

1503
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:37,398
Now, I like to win

1504
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:44,372
but sometimes the real victory
is when everybody wins.

1505
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,273
I have no idea
what she's trying to-

1506
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:46,708
I think I do.

1507
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,578
I uh...

1508
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:01,256
Your honour, may we approach?

1509
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:11,566
Hi, Cass, um... I just wanna
say thank you.

1510
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,002
Benji and I, we uh...

1511
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,637
we couldn't have gotten
to this point without you,

1512
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:16,938
so thank you.

1513
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,439
I'm happy for you.

1514
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,074
See you later.

1515
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,144
Cass.

1516
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:26,114
That was a pretty dangerous
move back there.

1517
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:28,549
But you pulled it off.

1518
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:31,152
Looks like we'll be
Adam's go-to firm.

1519
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,888
That took a lot of guts,
Cass.

1520
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,090
Sometimes you have
to trust me.

1521
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,026
We can talk about that tonight
at the marina gala.

1522
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,594
There's a new client
I want you to meet.

1523
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,262
Could be bigger than Adam.

1524
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,264
I'll be there.

1525
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:54,142
Honey, I am so sorry about how
things ended up with Matthew.

1526
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:55,677
I honestly thought I was doing
a good thing

1527
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,246
putting you two together.

1528
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,881
I know, mom.

1529
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:01,716
You had good intentions.

1530
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,517
Yeah, but you know what?

1531
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:05,086
I shouldn't have meddled.

1532
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,922
I shouldn't have done
a lot of things.

1533
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,557
Listen to me.

1534
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:15,129
You are a really good mom,
ok?

1535
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,532
You're pretty wonderful
yourself.

1536
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,873
Dad.

1537
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:30,011
Son.

1538
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,513
You didn't return my calls.

1539
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:35,917
I was beginning to think
you'd pulled up anchor again.

1540
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,319
It crossed my mind.

1541
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,421
You coming to
the gala tonight?

1542
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,589
Why?

1543
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,791
So you can rub it in my face
that I lost the bet?

1544
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:46,861
To be honest, I was hoping
you wouldn't lose.

1545
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:50,131
Yeah, well...

1546
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:53,634
so was I.

1547
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,203
But this was never about
you or me.

1548
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,771
A lot of people's lives are
gonna be turned upside down

1549
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,339
when you tear this place down.

1550
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,441
Just come to the gala.

1551
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,176
Why would I do that, dad?

1552
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:08,082
I saw Cass's name
on the guest list.

1553
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,752
Just tell her that your old
man's a dope and forced

1554
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:14,021
you to make a bet that should
never have been wagered.

1555
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,491
It doesn't matter.

1556
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,393
She's seeing someone.

1557
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,228
A guy from work.

1558
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:22,964
You sure about that?

1559
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,336
Only one way to find out.

1560
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:37,211
Sweetie, stage fright
is perfectly normal.

1561
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,213
As a matter of fact, it could be
a good thing.

1562
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,582
Just use it to electrify
your performance.

1563
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:42,483
I feel sick.

1564
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,185
Oh, use that, too.

1565
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,358
Whoo.

1566
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,226
Woah, mom.

1567
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,429
You look like a movie star.

1568
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,164
Aw, thank you, baby.

1569
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,765
Mom, which one?

1570
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,434
You're asking me?

1571
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:00,668
Mom.

1572
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:01,502
Uh, pink.

1573
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,037
Definitely the pink.

1574
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,605
Ok.

1575
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,441
Listen up troops.

1576
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,009
I've gotta go to this work thing
and then I'm gonna meet you

1577
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:10,645
at school before
the talent show.

1578
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:11,446
Don't be late.

1579
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,648
Or we could be really late.

1580
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,216
So late that we could miss
the whole thing.

1581
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,384
Would you stop worrying?

1582
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,519
You're gonna be amazing.

1583
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,428
Are you really that scared?

1584
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,064
Maybe.

1585
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,732
I'll be there.

1586
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,836
Not if you get caught up
in your work thing.

1587
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,971
It wouldn't be the first time.

1588
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:49,917
I see.

1589
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,320
Then I am not going
to this party.

1590
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:53,421
Really?

1591
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:54,755
Yep.

1592
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,229
There's nothing more
important than the two of you.

1593
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:19,247
Where is she?

1594
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,448
She's supposed to be here.

1595
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:21,749
Maybe she's stuck in traffic.

1596
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,217
She better be.

1597
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,556
I understand.

1598
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,760
Mom, it's ok.

1599
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,595
You can answer it.

1600
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:37,999
Hello?

1601
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,100
What the heck, Cass?

1602
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,768
Adam's been asking
about you,

1603
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,670
<i>and you're not here</i>
<i>to meet the new client.</i>

1604
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,805
Something extremely
important came up.

1605
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,274
<i>What could possibly compare</i>
<i>to the-</i>

1606
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:49,076
Please give my apologies
to Adam and the team.

1607
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,811
<i>You're risking your partnership</i>
<i>here.</i>

1608
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,614
Nothing is more important
than my family.

1609
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,316
I'll see you tomorrow.

1610
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:04,926
So, what do you think?

1611
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,728
It's up to you.

1612
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:10,865
Do you want to give the show
a shot?

1613
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,500
Or not?

1614
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:15,636
We can still make it
if we hurry.

1615
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:16,804
Ok.

1616
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:17,338
Let's do this.

1617
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,707
Yes, it's showtime!

1618
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,175
Let's go!

1619
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,044
Alright, kids.

1620
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:42,463
Can I have your
attention please?

1621
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,568
As you all know,

1622
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,938
I've had plans for the marina
for a long time.

1623
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,841
Big plans.

1624
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:58,579
Tonight I want to announce
that those plans have changed.

1625
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,014
Charles Walker Industries

1626
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:04,185
will not be breaking ground
for a new condo project.

1627
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:10,858
Instead, I'm authorizing the
complete marina restoration.

1628
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:15,196
And thanks to the persistent
and compassionate efforts

1629
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,898
of our own Matthew Walker,

1630
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,568
I've come to see
that the marina,

1631
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:25,206
this dirty old marina,
has value.

1632
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,241
That is, if Matthew
will agree to work with

1633
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:29,744
his old man on this.

1634
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,545
You got it, pops.

1635
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,258
Sorry pops,

1636
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:44,692
I...

1637
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,594
Go.

1638
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:15,089
Emma McKay?

1639
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,724
You're up in five, kid.

1640
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,976
She's next.

1641
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:41,315
Up next we have Emma McKay
on violin.

1642
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,197
Emma McKay.

1643
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,132
Please come out.

1644
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,101
Please.

1645
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,728
Excuse me, sorry.

1646
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:28,662
Coming through.

1647
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:31,632
Can I borrow those
for a second, thanks?

1648
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,539
Oh, hi.

1649
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:42,276
Matthew, you made it.

1650
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,744
What on earth?

1651
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,680
Wouldn't miss it
for the world, kiddo!

1652
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:49,016
Does he ever clean up nice.

1653
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,448
Emma McKay, everyone!

1654
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:57,518
And her special
bongo buddy!

1655
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:04,358
Oh my god.

1656
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,359
Unbelievable.

1657
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:06,760
I know!

1658
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:08,929
I knew she could do it.

1659
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:13,701
Thank you so much.

1660
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:14,635
No, thank you.

1661
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:15,603
That was a blast!

1662
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:18,572
And you did a great job,
kiddo!

1663
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:20,574
You were fantastic!

1664
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:24,712
Didn't that feel good?

1665
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:25,646
Mmmhmm.

1666
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,981
Oh, and hey, could
you take these bongos

1667
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,415
back to that kid out there?

1668
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,049
Please?

1669
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,184
Thanks.

1670
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,490
And you are something else.

1671
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:39,126
Back atcha.

1672
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,562
And Cass, I'm sorry.

1673
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:45,299
I should have told you about
that bet and that was wrong.

1674
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:49,169
Hey, but I swear that the time
with you and the kids,

1675
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,639
compared to that it was...

1676
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:54,975
it was nothing.

1677
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,311
I understand.

1678
01:21:57,345 --> 01:22:02,483
What you did
helped so many people.

1679
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:04,652
If it's any consolation,

1680
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,688
those weeks with you
and the kids were the...

1681
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:10,157
best I've had in years.

1682
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:20,601
Are you uh... trying to get
your manny job back?

1683
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:23,170
Definitely... not.
