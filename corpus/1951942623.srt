1
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,186
New York City! If you're ready for the
star of the show make some noise!

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,991
I said, if you're ready for the star
of the show make some noise!

3
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:21,526
Give it up for the one and only...

4
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:25,171
Russell Peters!

5
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,937
Give it up for DJ Spinbad!

6
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:04,801
And Starting From Scratch!

7
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:09,882
Toronto and New York,
the two best in the world.

8
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:12,444
What's up!

9
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:16,113
How you doing?
What's going on?

10
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,621
Look at everybody all mixed up,
I like that.

11
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:22,493
White girls with non-white guys,
that's what I'm talking about, huh?

12
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,795
Black guy with an Asian girl,
God damn!

13
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,465
You're like, we've got to capitalize
on this Tiger Woods shit.

14
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:38,109
Somebody brought a kid,
good job, huh? Good job.

15
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:42,641
That kid's going to learn some
new shit tonight, my friend. He's...

16
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,187
Asians, good to see you.

17
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:58,156
You look upset, what's wrong?

18
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,855
You look like your looking
for a Dance Dance Revolution

19
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,193
machine or something.

20
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:07,366
Asians love that Dance Dance
Revolution, don't you? God damn!

21
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,769
They love Dance Dance
Revolution.

22
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:14,004
DDR. That's the Short...
that's what they call it. DDR.

23
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,341
See, I said it, that guy just smiled.
"Oh, DDR!"

24
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:19,510
So good.

25
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:21,944
Do you know what it is, sir?

26
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:23,248
Do you know what the
Dance Dance Revolution is?

27
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,254
It's not an actual revolution.

28
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:26,858
So you don't have to worry about that.

29
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,086
It's not like a bunch of Asians
are going to knock on your door,

30
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:30,923
"Hey! Start dancing!"
It's not like that.

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,533
"It's a revolution!"

32
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:39,932
It's a video game, it's a videogame,
you can relax again.

33
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,473
What it is,
it's a TV screen in front of you,

34
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:46,840
and it's got these arrows that go
in different directions,

35
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,878
they just keep moving,
and they go in different directions

36
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,917
and they're different colours,
and it plays this shitty Euro trash music

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,280
in the background, right?

38
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,615
It sounds like you're in the back seat
of a Persian guy's car,

39
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:58,018
you know what I mean? Just...

40
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:03,592
Hey bro, this is the
best music bro, this is...

41
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:10,726
hey bro, this is best bro, this is best bro,
is the biggest thing in Europe bro,

42
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:13,065
is best in Europe bro.

43
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,709
So it's got the TV, the arrows,

44
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,242
and the shitty music and then
on the ground in front of you

45
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:22,574
are these things that light up according
to what you see on the screen

46
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:27,652
and you're supposed to step on that
and that will teach you how to dance.

47
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:30,221
And the Asians love it!

48
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:39,321
I remember last year, I was in Singapore
and the Chinese people in Singapore

49
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,398
were lined up outside the arcade.

50
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:44,162
Lined up to play
Dance Dance Revolution.

51
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:47,067
And I was like,
how hard can this shit be?

52
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:48,468
So I stood in line.

53
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,303
I get to the machine,
I put my money in...

54
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:55,209
the hardest fucking thing
I've ever tried in my life!

55
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,974
I didn't hit one single
thing on the ground,

56
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,311
I was one step behind
every moment.

57
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,317
I was doing so badly, at one point,
the machine even said,

58
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:04,958
"Do you even have legs?" It just said
that, right across the front of the screen.

59
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,389
At one point this came up,
in front of the screen, one of these...

60
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:14,901
And I was doing so badly that the
Chinese dude that was next was getting

61
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:18,435
mad at me because he thought
I was bullshitting on the machine!

62
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,731
He starts yelling at me,

63
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,206
"Hey Asshole! If you're not going
to play the game proper..."

64
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:34,487
"Then go play something else!"

65
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:37,418
"Go play something your
people are good at!"

66
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:40,451
"Go play the taxi game!"

67
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:51,567
So I got mad, right?
I'm like, alright fuck-face!

68
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:54,866
That's what I like to call people when
I'm mad and I don't know their name.

69
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:58,943
"Fuck-face" I find is a good
way of going about it.

70
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:01,376
Because you can't really get offended if
someone calls you fuck-face, can you?

71
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:02,674
If I went, "Hey fuck-face,"
and you were like,

72
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,510
"What, you want to go? What, what?"

73
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,084
Like you would actually be a fuck-face.
If you wanted to fight if some guy

74
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,551
called you fuck-face because really,
there's worse things you could be

75
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,053
called than fuck-face.

76
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:13,123
What is a fuck-face?

77
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:15,420
It's the face you make when you fuck.
That's all it is. It's...

78
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:19,664
This, this is a fuck-face, look.

79
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:25,136
Is that really so bad?
Is it?

80
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,533
You don't even have
to say it to somebody.

81
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,174
Next time some body cuts you off in
traffic, pull up beside them and go,

82
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:30,900
"Hey!"

83
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:38,107
"You just called me fuck-face?"

84
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:42,485
But don't roll your eyes,
don't roll your eyes.

85
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:43,678
When you do it, don't be like...

86
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:45,984
Because then,
then you're cum-face.

87
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:48,855
You don't want to be cum-face.
You just want to be fuck-face.

88
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:58,134
I don't know what it is about cumming,
that makes your whole body

89
00:05:58,338 --> 00:05:59,669
freeze for like, 10 seconds.

90
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,340
Okay! Ahh!

91
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,908
You get frozen in time, right?
Oh my God, I'm going to...

92
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:10,911
It's like the end of a sitcom...

93
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:13,375
And then the credits come up...

94
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,193
Explain that to him.

95
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:36,106
So I'm like, "Alright, fuck-face!
If you think you're so good,

96
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,301
let me see you play this!"

97
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:41,948
This son of a bitch...
starts limbering up.

98
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:54,860
Gets to the machine,
sets it to "advanced", starts playing.

99
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:57,587
He doesn't miss one single step,
he's just...

100
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,604
It was the only time
in my life I've seen

101
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:12,608
an Asian dude open
his eyes really wide.

102
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:13,802
Just...

103
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:19,678
Do it, do it, open your eyes really wide,
try it, try it.

104
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:23,955
Nothing happens, nothing happens!

105
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:25,988
I love it. Just...
Just the eyebrows move.

106
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:27,182
That's it, it's just...

107
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,259
I'm an asshole.

108
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,435
Any Arabs in the house tonight?
Arabs in the house?

109
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:42,397
Alright, thank you,
goodnight! Alright.

110
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,038
What kind of Arab are you?

111
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,439
Oh good, yeah,
you're united, good.

112
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:55,719
"blah-blah!" Is all I heard.

113
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,082
I don't know if you
answered me in Arabic,

114
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,553
or if you said the country just now.

115
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,128
One at a time there fellas.
What are you, what, what?

116
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,322
Libya!

117
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:08,523
Libya.

118
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:09,724
Lebanon!

119
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:12,097
Libya, Lebanon, any other L-countries?

120
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:16,438
Oh good, yeah.

121
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:18,076
Well, just for the record...

122
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,075
you're a stone's throw away
from each other. Listen, I...

123
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:33,453
Just for the record, my Arab friends,
I don't do any Arab jokes in my act.

124
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,719
It's not that I don't think you're funny,
I just, you know, I don't know,

125
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,159
I don't want to... I don't know,
I don't want to die.

126
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,038
See, because I'll do a joke
about an Arab,

127
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:46,899
and they'll look like they're laughing.

128
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:49,969
But it's not the same
laugh you're doing.

129
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:55,075
Like, I'll do a joke about an Arab
and you guys will be like, "Ha, ha, ha!"

130
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,512
and you look at the Arab guy
and he's like, "Ha, ha... ha."

131
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:06,485
"Oh no, I get it, it's funny joke.
Ha, ha, ha."

132
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,923
"No, it's funny, I get it."

133
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,597
"Don't worry...

134
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:20,466
I will talk to him after."

135
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:27,442
Doesn't it feel like every time
you turn on the news nowadays,

136
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:30,343
some new country is fucking
with an Arab country?

137
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,983
Every time you turn on the news.

138
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:35,746
I kind of blame the media for what's
going wrong in the world right now,

139
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:38,618
because they kind of just perpetuate
stereotypes about people.

140
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:39,951
They don't tell you that's
what they're doing,

141
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,627
they don't go, "hey, this is what
you need to think,"

142
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:43,625
but they know how
people's brains work.

143
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,094
What they do, they enforce
all this shit, you know?

144
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,063
What they do, is they'll show you an
image of somebody...

145
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,999
of a different racial background
and then they'll show you

146
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:55,174
an alternate image like right away,
of something completely different.

147
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,105
They don't say the two images are
together, they kind of present it like,

148
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,369
"what do you think?"

149
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,840
Like, what they'll do is
they'll show you like, an Asian guy...

150
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:04,482
And then a car accident.

151
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,646
They'll show you an Indian guy...

152
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,348
And a 7/11.

153
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:16,962
"What do you think?"

154
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:19,997
They'll show you an Arab guy
and an explosion.

155
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,491
I knew it! You know...

156
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:25,166
That's how they get in your head.
They put it in there.

157
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:28,135
Obviously when Arabic is
being spoken on TV,

158
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:31,838
it's always like, these crazy people.
And these protests in the Arab world.

159
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,177
And they're all speaking
this really harsh Arabic.

160
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:35,375
And so it's like...

161
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,490
"Fuck America!"

162
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:42,057
Because that's what they want us
to think is going on over there!

163
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,625
So I wanted to get to the
bottom of this shit.

164
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:45,990
So I went to the
Middle East last year.

165
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:48,894
Because I needed to get some
rectifying for my...

166
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,329
Is it rectifying?
whatever...

167
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,594
I needed to sort this shit out for myself.

168
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,968
Because I had this whole impression
in my head that Arabic

169
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:00,701
was such an ugly language,
because it's always like...

170
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
And people are like oh my God,
no wonder they're angry,

171
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:05,343
they're vomiting on each other
when they talk!

172
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,681
Then you go to the Middle East,
and you hear real Arabs speaking

173
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,585
Arabic, and it sounds nice.

174
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,487
I was actually turned on by it.

175
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:20,592
Because I was at this café in Dubai
and I'm chilling right,

176
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,926
and there are these two Arab girls
having this conversation behind me

177
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:26,263
and I'm eavesdropping, I have no clue
what the fuck they're saying.

178
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:28,769
But it sounded nice to me.
Because all he hear behind me is...

179
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,055
And I was like,
"Oh god, this is good."

180
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:50,620
But they never show you those Arabs on
TV because they're boring!

181
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:52,091
They only show you the crazy...

182
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:57,168
Basically, all they're showing
you of the Arab world

183
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,064
are the rednecks of the Arab world.

184
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:03,870
That's why their Arabic is so bad!

185
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:11,782
If you were to translate their Arabic
accent into an American accent,

186
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:15,578
they'd sound like this, "We're gonna kill
the whole fucking world! Yee-haw!"

187
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:17,482
That's what they would sound like!

188
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:26,122
That's how the media does it!
They show you all the fucked up people!

189
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:29,562
That's all they show us is the messed
up Arabs. I bet you in the Arab world,

190
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:32,703
all they show them of
America is Jerry Springer.

191
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:36,968
"Look at Americans,
they're fucking stupid!"

192
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,938
"He's fucking his cousin!"

193
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:41,869
"Not like you and me, it's different,
they're doing it dirty."

194
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,911
"It's different,
they do it some other way."

195
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:53,451
Look at all these Indian faces,
Jesus Christ.

196
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:58,822
Look at you brown bastards, goddamn.

197
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,123
Indians just look upset that they
had to spend money to be here tonight,

198
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,322
don't you?

199
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:05,828
Just the look on their face, just...

200
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:10,900
"This is bullshit."

201
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,411
"I don't know why I'm spending money
to see someone that looks just like me."

202
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:28,091
"I can stay home
and look in the mirror..."

203
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,090
"For free!"

204
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:33,958
We are an endless
supply of cheap jokes!

205
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:35,598
And you know what the
best thing about it is?

206
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,360
Indian people,
we're proud of our cheapness.

207
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,562
You're never going to insult us
by calling us cheap, that's the best part!

208
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:47,203
You walk up to am Indian,
"You guys are cheap."

209
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:48,674
"Thank you for noticing, thank you."

210
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:53,612
"Thank you very much, thank you."

211
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:55,115
"That guy just called you cheap!"

212
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,584
"No, no, no,
he pronounced it 'cheap'.

213
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:59,757
But what he was saying was 'smart'."

214
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,357
"Very smart, he was saying."

215
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,525
We're cheap.
You know, here's the thing too.

216
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:10,428
It's not like I'm up here going
"You Indian people are cheap,

217
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:11,727
and I'm the one that's not."

218
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,233
No, no, no, no, no.

219
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:16,134
No, no, no, no, no...

220
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:19,003
I am just as fucking cheap as you.

221
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,145
The difference is now I have money.

222
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:24,178
I'm just cheap in better stores!

223
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:29,048
I'll be looking at like an Armani shirt...
I hate when this happens...

224
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:31,188
I'm looking at a shirt from
like a high-end designer

225
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,823
and I flip the tag over
and I see "Made in India".

226
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,287
I'm stuck with a real dilemma.

227
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:37,427
I'm like, "shit...

228
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,790
do I buy this?"

229
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:41,488
"Or do I call my uncle?"

230
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:51,139
I wonder if he knows
where this factory is?

231
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:00,647
We are cheap.
Everybody's cheap, aren't they?

232
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:01,876
Never call white people cheap.

233
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:03,850
White people get really upset
when you call them cheap.

234
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:06,888
Have you ever called a white person
cheap? They get very angry.

235
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,026
Because white people actually
are probably the only people

236
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:10,660
that aren't cheap.

237
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:11,851
Ever call a white guy cheap?
"You're cheap."

238
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:14,657
"Fuck you, I'm cheap.
I'll buy you a beer, you want a beer?"

239
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,461
That's how white guys
get around being cheap.

240
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,365
"You want a beer? You want a beer?
You want a beer? You want a beer?"

241
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:21,732
"You want a beer, huh?
You want a beer?"

242
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,965
"Fuck you, I'm not cheap,
I bought everybody beer!"

243
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:31,639
Everybody's cheap.
It's all about levels, you know?

244
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:35,095
Where are the Jews at?
Jews in the house?

245
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:37,457
Alright Arabs, The Jews are in here.
Go talk to them.

246
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:46,171
You've got some hugging to do.

247
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:53,906
Jews, I don't know how you
got the title of being cheap,

248
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:56,082
it's very offensive to Indian people.

249
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:58,841
People are like,
"Jews are cheap!"

250
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,715
We're like,
"No, that is very incorrect."

251
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,651
"I am cheap."

252
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:06,053
"Jews are thrifty."

253
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,626
"Big difference."

254
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,320
There must have been like one Jewish
guy back in the day, who was cheap,

255
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:14,160
and he fucked it up for the rest of you
for the rest of your lives.

256
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:15,858
Because Jews aren't actually cheap.

257
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,561
You know who's cheap? Asians.
Asians are cheap as shit.

258
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:21,002
Chinese people specifically.

259
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,073
Where the Chinese people at?
Where are you?

260
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:26,674
Always the Woo family, nice.

261
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:31,417
Chinese people, you are cheap,
like, it's crazy.

262
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,383
But it's about levels.
Like, if you were to rate the top three

263
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:35,782
cheap people in the world,

264
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,084
Indians for sure would be
number one on that list.

265
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:41,557
See? See the pride in it?
Oh yeah, fantastic.

266
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:44,123
Fantastic.

267
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,821
We are it, egdum number one!

268
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,837
Indians for sure,
number one on that list.

269
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:58,978
Very, very close second, Chinese,
and Jews we'll give you third place,

270
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,409
just to keep you in the game,
how about that, you know?

271
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:04,345
So you don't feel like you're losing
everything. Alright? So...

272
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:13,993
But it's all about levels.

273
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:17,322
Like let's just say there's
a Louis Vuitton boutique, right?

274
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:21,831
An Indian guy will walk past this Louis
Vuitton store every day of his life

275
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:23,628
and never once step foot in there.

276
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:27,796
Like, "Not even on their best sale will
I be going in there. No thank you."

277
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,810
Now if Louis Vuitton's
having a sale,

278
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,275
Jewish guy's going in
and he's buying shit.

279
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,846
It was on sale, what you want?

280
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,483
Nachus!

281
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:42,322
Chinese people, sale or no sale,
you're going into Louis Vuitton...

282
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:43,922
Every day.

283
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:45,955
You never buy shit!

284
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:49,362
But you'll go in everyday.

285
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:53,055
Sales guy, "Can I help you, sir?"
"Uh, no, just looking."

286
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,600
The minute the sales guy turns his
back, Chinese guy whips out a camera...

287
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:00,069
ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching...

288
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,374
Goes home, e-mails the
pictures to Hong Kong,

289
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,778
"Make this bag, quickly!"

290
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:13,817
"We'll sell it to the Indians!"

291
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,193
That's a sale you never
want to see happening!

292
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,266
A Chinese guy trying to sell an Indian
guy a Louis Vuitton bag?

293
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:30,767
Neither one of them can say
Louis Vuitton properly!

294
00:18:32,873 --> 00:18:35,501
Hey Mr. Indian guy!

295
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:39,702
You want a designer bag?

296
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,642
Who is this? Who is he?

297
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:47,086
This is the Indian hand motion for
"I don't know."

298
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,050
"I don't know, who is he? I don't know."

299
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:56,092
"Who is he? Who is this?
Who is this guy?"

300
00:18:56,296 --> 00:19:01,461
"It's a designer bag, it's uh...
initials, LV."

301
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,569
"Who is this?
Who is this LV? Who is he?"

302
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:06,862
Remember growing up,
"Dad, who finished the milk?"

303
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:08,439
"I don't know, I don't know."

304
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:12,407
"I wasn't there, I don't know."

305
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:16,481
"Son! I can't hear! Nothing!"

306
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:17,708
Nothing is coming!"

307
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:23,720
I don't know what the fuck that's
supposed to mean!

308
00:19:23,924 --> 00:19:25,949
"Nothing is coming! Nothing!"

309
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:32,860
"Who is this? Who is this LV?"

310
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,763
"That's, uh, designer initial."

311
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:37,800
"It has a name underneath."

312
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,135
"Who's wooon?"

313
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:47,103
"Who's loooseweetin?"

314
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:49,942
"Loosevutiiin?"

315
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,176
"Looseveen!"

316
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:55,617
What the fuck are you saying?

317
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:59,122
"I'm reading designer's name,
Loosevootin."

318
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:01,556
Why don't you spell what you see?

319
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:03,320
"Okay."

320
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,724
"Okay."

321
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:07,332
"Okay, Looz..."

322
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,934
"Looz, is Looz, huh?"

323
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:14,437
"Absolutely, Looz is Looz."

324
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:17,439
"150 thousand percent sure!"

325
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:19,805
"Looz is Looz."

326
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,447
That's an Indian person
convincing you of shit.

327
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,913
You ever try and buy something,
like, give me the best price.

328
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,555
OK, Sir, I'm telling you, sir, final price.

329
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:30,280
Best price.

330
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,686
Take it and go.

331
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:34,588
Take it...

332
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:35,853
And go.

333
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:38,288
Take it and go.

334
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:44,333
"Okay. So Looz..."

335
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:46,335
"Looz is Looz."

336
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,236
Alright fine, Looz is Louis.

337
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:50,808
What's his last name?

338
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,205
"Weed-on."

339
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:56,941
I didn't say, "say it all fucked Up".
I said, "Spell it out."

340
00:20:57,151 --> 00:21:00,052
"Okay. Wee...

341
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:02,354
U-I...

342
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:04,649
T-T-O-N."

343
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,018
Because that's how we spell shit.

344
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:08,558
We'll go slow for the
first three letters...

345
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:10,923
and then we jog through
the other half of the name, don't we?

346
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:12,189
We do the same thing
with phone numbers.

347
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:13,388
Alright, give me your phone number.

348
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,591
Okay, 212...

349
00:21:15,803 --> 00:21:16,792
Triple five.

350
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:21,069
8246.

351
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:36,883
And the messed up part is,
we know the rhythm.

352
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,188
Here's the thing with
Indian people being cheap.

353
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:49,301
Our cheapness actually
changed the world.

354
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,527
You see, you may be
sitting there going,

355
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:52,033
"Well, how did your
cheapness change the world?"

356
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,968
Well, let me tell you how.

357
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:58,133
Because our cheapness actually
benefited everybody.

358
00:21:58,345 --> 00:22:01,473
We're so dedicated to
being cheap for so long...

359
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:05,311
that Indian people actually
created the number zero.

360
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:10,254
Do you know how much
dedication that took?

361
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:13,654
That means, back in the day some
Indian guy was looking

362
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:15,158
at the numeric system.

363
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:19,355
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

364
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,835
None of those are amounts
I want to pay.

365
00:22:34,915 --> 00:22:37,315
Then his friend came along
and drew a circle.

366
00:22:37,517 --> 00:22:39,212
"What's that?"

367
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,512
"Nothing."

368
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:44,054
"What's inside of it?"

369
00:22:44,258 --> 00:22:45,850
"Nothing."

370
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:48,254
"What's its value?"

371
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:49,451
"Nothing."

372
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:52,125
"It's beautiful!"

373
00:22:58,071 --> 00:22:59,129
"We shall call it...

374
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:00,328
zero."

375
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:04,139
"Take it and go."

376
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:14,181
Any Italian people
in the house tonight? Italians?

377
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:18,949
Are you real Italian or are you like
a New York Italian?

378
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,525
New York, that's not
fucking real Italian, you know.

379
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:24,253
You what? Your parents are from Italy,
so do you speak Italian?

380
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:26,796
Oh well, then you're real Italian.

381
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,093
As long as you speak Italian,
to me you're real Italian.

382
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:31,635
Because I meet a lot of people in
New York that are Italian,

383
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:33,772
but don't speak a fucking word of Italian.

384
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:37,034
But act more Italian than
the actual Italians do.

385
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:38,233
I was standing in Manhatt...

386
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:39,503
I was standing right in
Times Square the other day,

387
00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:43,274
and this Italian dude walked past me.

388
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:48,546
He had uh, what I thought was an
Indian girl; looked like an Indian girl,

389
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:50,245
and they walked past me.
I was just standing there chilling.

390
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:53,426
You know, in Times Square,
you can just stand there and look at shit.

391
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:56,721
So they walked past
and I didn't check out his girl.

392
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,296
All I did was this...

393
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:01,827
They walked past, it was like.

394
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:03,024
It's an Indian thing,

395
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,726
the minute Indian people see
another Indian person we're like...

396
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:13,942
"I thought I was the only one!"

397
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:19,247
That's the bubble we live in.

398
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:25,786
But I didn't gawk. She walked by
and I just did this...

399
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:29,224
and I just continued looking at whatever,
nothing, it was Times Square,

400
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:31,363
just looking at shit.

401
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:37,003
And I don't know how this dude saw me,
but all of a sudden out behind me I hear,

402
00:24:37,204 --> 00:24:39,195
"Hey!"

403
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:43,001
And it's Times Square, so you don't pay
attention to every "Hey," that you hear,

404
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,734
so I'm just like, you know.

405
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:47,038
"Hey!"

406
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:49,215
"Hey, dick-face!"

407
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:52,380
And I was like, "dick-face"?

408
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,053
I want to see who this dick-face is.

409
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:01,817
I'm like, it's very close to my fuck-face.

410
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,591
If this is a fuck-face,
what's a dick-face?

411
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:08,996
You know, I don't know.
I don't know what a dick-face is?

412
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,900
I don't know what a dick-face is!
So I want to see!

413
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:18,976
Where is this dick-face?

414
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,613
He goes, "Hey, dick-face!" And I go.

415
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:25,945
And he goes, "Yeah you!"
I'm like, "I'm dick-face?"

416
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:28,553
"Where the fuck did you get
the balls to look at my girl?"

417
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:30,382
Because what they do,
is when they get angry,

418
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,822
they'll ask you a question
and it's a really fucked up question.

419
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,690
And it's a rhetorical question,
to be honest with you.

420
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:39,593
But they ask you like
you're supposed to answer.

421
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,894
They wait for you to answer. "Where the
fuck... let me ask you a question..."

422
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:45,833
"Where the fuck? Where?"

423
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,908
"Where the fuck do you get the balls to
look at my girl? Where?"

424
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:53,607
And I'm like, "What?"

425
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:59,482
"Where! Show me! Why don't you
fucking show me! Take me!"

426
00:25:59,686 --> 00:26:04,282
"Take me to the fucking store where you
got the balls to look at my girl!"

427
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:08,621
"Where? Where the fuck
did you get the fucking balls!"

428
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:10,854
"Where?"

429
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:14,693
And I panicked, right?
I'm like, "Costco."

430
00:26:23,076 --> 00:26:24,441
I got a jar.

431
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,545
There's a big difference between that
Italian and real Italians aren't there?

432
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:36,551
Because it's a race,
it's a race-culture issue.

433
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:39,987
Everybody's got this race-culture
issue in this country, you know?

434
00:26:40,193 --> 00:26:41,592
Anywhere, you know...

435
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:43,956
There's a big difference
between race and culture.

436
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:46,724
Because racially I'm an Indian man,

437
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:50,027
culturally, not at all.

438
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:52,637
Many of you may think you're Indian,
or, you know, some people

439
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,273
think they're Italian even though they've
never been to Italy in their lives,

440
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:56,806
they don't speak Italian.

441
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,605
It always bugs me how they call black
people in America African-Americans.

442
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:02,611
You're not fucking African!

443
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:03,805
You're black!

444
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:05,746
If a black guy showed up in
Africa tomorrow,

445
00:27:05,952 --> 00:27:07,214
"What's happenin'?"
he'd be like...

446
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:11,180
"That mother fucker's crazy!
Get him away from me!"

447
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:19,525
They'd be looking for a white guy,
"Oh my god, thank God you're here!"

448
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:24,866
"Those brothas over there
are out of their minds!"

449
00:27:33,046 --> 00:27:36,675
Same thing for me! You know, there's a
big difference between race and culture.

450
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:40,216
Because all my life I've been identifying
myself as an Indian man.

451
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,615
I'm always like, I'm Indian.
What are you? I'm Indian.

452
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:43,948
Where you from?
I'm Indian.

453
00:27:44,157 --> 00:27:45,920
What do you mean,
where am I from? I'm Indian.

454
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:49,357
And then I realised something.
I was born and raised in Canada.

455
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:51,724
There's nothing Indian about me!

456
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:54,867
The only thing Indian about me are
my parents and my skin tone.

457
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:58,529
That's it! Culturally, I'm not Indian at all.

458
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:00,535
And the only reason I know this is
because last year

459
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,174
I went to India to do some shows.

460
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:04,843
And I thought I was Indian.

461
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:10,108
And when we were flying over to India,
I got this overwhelming Indian feeling.

462
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:13,184
Inside of me I was like,
"I'm the most Indian man ever!"

463
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:17,850
I just thought I was so Indian,
you know?

464
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:20,390
We arrived in Bombay,
I was like yelling at the flight attendant,

465
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:24,325
"Open the doors to this plane!
Let me at my Indian people!"

466
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:27,830
"Let me show those Indians
what it's like to be Indian!"

467
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:30,798
She opened up the doors to that plane,
I turned Canadian so fast!

468
00:28:32,772 --> 00:28:34,239
I was like, I am so...

469
00:28:58,098 --> 00:28:59,656
Did I step in shit just now?

470
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:03,934
When you arrive in India, the minute
they open the doors to that plane,

471
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:07,834
you get an overwhelming blast of
shit smell right up your nose!

472
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,407
It's almost like they hire someone to shit
in front of every plane that lands!

473
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:17,082
Quick, quick, here comes one.
Shit, shit and go! Shit and go!

474
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:20,316
Go! go! go!

475
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,355
And if you're an Indian person out there,
you're thinking to yourself,

476
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,357
"That's not true, that's not true."

477
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:32,053
Then fuck you, you probably had a cold
or landed in the wrong country!

478
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,394
Because racially I'm an Indian man.

479
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:43,406
Culturally, there are things that happen
culturally, if you are not raised

480
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,738
in that part of the world,
you will find it unacceptable.

481
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:50,643
Like in India, grown-ass-men,
grown-ass-men...

482
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,010
hold hands with other men.

483
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:57,488
And walk down the street.
Like everything's okay!

484
00:29:57,691 --> 00:30:01,024
And they don't just hold hands,
they're holding fucking pinkies!

485
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:02,888
And swinging that shit!

486
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:16,472
And to them, there's nothing
gay about it.

487
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,837
Here's the thing.
There's nothing gay to them,

488
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:21,707
"I'm holding my friend's hand,
what's gay about that?"

489
00:30:21,915 --> 00:30:25,612
See, you grow up over here, there is no
acceptable time for two straight men

490
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:27,650
to ever touch hands. Ever!

491
00:30:27,854 --> 00:30:29,014
You ever walk through the mall
with one of your guy friends

492
00:30:29,222 --> 00:30:30,712
and your hand accidentally
bumps into him...

493
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:31,982
Hey, what the fuck
is wrong with you?!

494
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:36,695
Get off me!

495
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:43,264
But in India, grown-ass-men hold...
And the guys holding pinkies,

496
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,496
the best shit about it is,
they'll still try to mack on chicks.

497
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,100
Hello, hello...

498
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:53,138
Hello.

499
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:56,876
You're looking very lovely today.

500
00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:04,283
Some guys act like
thugs holding hands!

501
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:07,051
They'll be holding pinkies
and eyeballing you.

502
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,592
Like they're trying to start some shit!

503
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:16,262
I was at the beach in Bombay, right?
I am hanging out, this gang of like,

504
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:19,404
seventeen... sorry, sixteen...

505
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:21,403
Well, seventeen's an odd number.
That would mean that one guy was like,

506
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:23,041
"Somebody hold my hand,
somebody hold my hand!"

507
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:34,753
This gang of like, sixteen dudes is
walking across the beach,

508
00:31:34,954 --> 00:31:38,321
holding pinkies
and giving everybody dirty looks.

509
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:48,924
With their dress pants and flip-flops.

510
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:54,772
How are you going to start a fight
holding another man's hand?

511
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:57,704
How? how?
"Let go, let go, let go!"

512
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:13,686
It's a different world over there, man.
And I was there doing shows.

513
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:16,760
I remember before I went to India
I was all nervous, right?

514
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:18,328
Because my friends were like,
my friends were like,

515
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:19,520
"Hey Russell, man,
when you go to India,

516
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:20,721
are they going to
understand your jokes?"

517
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:23,425
and I was like,
"I don't know, are they?"

518
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:24,898
and they were like,
"Are you going to offend them?"

519
00:32:25,104 --> 00:32:28,596
And I was like, "Fuck, I don't know!"
Am I going to offend them?

520
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:30,036
Because I realized something
before I went,

521
00:32:30,243 --> 00:32:31,870
a lot of my jokes...

522
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:35,241
the punch line is the Indian accent!

523
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,646
But it was funny because when I
performed in India,

524
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:45,086
every body understood every single
thing that came out of my mouth.

525
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:49,557
Every joke, every line, every like,
suggestion, they were with me,

526
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:52,253
they were with it,
they were completely there.

527
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:55,923
And it was funny because
every time I did the Indian accent,

528
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:58,365
they laughed harder.

529
00:32:58,571 --> 00:33:03,508
Because I think that they don't think
that they have that accent.

530
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:12,148
I think they think that there is like one
guy in India with this accent.

531
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:13,876
Probably the same guy that's shitting
in front of every plane,

532
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,076
you know what I mean?

533
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:19,881
Because they would come
up to me on the streets,

534
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:21,924
people in India would walk up
to me on the streets.

535
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:24,494
First of all, I don't know how the hell
they recognised me on the streets.

536
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:27,131
I'm like, it's India.

537
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,824
There's over a billion
and a half people there.

538
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:33,005
I look at least like
fucking fifteen million people.

539
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:38,542
But they'd come up to me on the street
and go, "Russell! Russell!"

540
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:42,414
They were so emphatic with their
complements too. It was the best thing.

541
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:45,743
"Russell! Your show last night,
your show, Russell!

542
00:33:45,952 --> 00:33:49,388
Your show last night!
Too good! Too good!"

543
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:55,684
"Too good!
Son, first class! A1!"

544
00:33:56,696 --> 00:34:00,029
"Fantastic! The show is fantastic!"

545
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:05,193
"Russell, your show is mind-blasting!
Mind-blasting!"

546
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:06,394
Do you mean mind-blowing?

547
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:08,471
"No, no, no,
anything can blow your mind."

548
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:10,700
"It blasted my mind! It was..."

549
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,253
It's an incredible place to go,
I mean, for anybody,

550
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,856
whether you're Indian or not,
just to go and see like,

551
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,755
history and shit that
you've never seen before.

552
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,361
After my shows were done
I went to Calcutta,

553
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,828
because that's where my mom is from
and I went to go see my mom's

554
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,662
two brothers, my uncles,
and I did something very rude

555
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,328
in the Indian culture;
I didn't stay at my uncle's house.

556
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,771
And... Ooh... Right, so...
Whatever, you know.

557
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,410
Because this is what I mean.

558
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,637
I'm too North American
for my own good.

559
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,281
I'm too used to certain luxuries now.

560
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,508
You know, like running water.

561
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,419
A toilet.

562
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,822
Toilet paper!

563
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,585
There is only so much ass washing
with a cup that I want to do in my life,

564
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:57,784
you know what I mean?

565
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:15,058
"Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me,
excuse me, excuse me, pardon me,

566
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:16,556
pardon..."

567
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:19,360
"Sorry."

568
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:25,793
That one sounded runny.

569
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:32,709
She's never coming back.

570
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,971
"Are you kidding? Fuck that!"

571
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,159
It's warm in here, isn't it?
It's nice.

572
00:35:40,194 --> 00:35:41,885
I don't generally sweat.

573
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:44,621
I'm dabbing.

574
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:47,392
Maybe because I'm hairy,
that's probably why I'm sweating.

575
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:49,262
I'm a hairy man,
I don't care.

576
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:53,704
Men are supposed to be hairy,
it's the way God built us.

577
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:55,341
Amen!

578
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:56,567
Thank you.

579
00:35:58,112 --> 00:35:59,773
But that's the media,
the media did that shit to us.

580
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,574
The media made it un-sexy to be hairy,
have you noticed that?

581
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:04,216
That's what they did.

582
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:08,013
Because they show you images
of dudes nowadays with no hair.

583
00:36:08,222 --> 00:36:09,689
That's what they did,
and it gets in your head,

584
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,948
you don't know it's getting in your head.

585
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:13,752
Remember the 70s?
All the men had big hairy chests.

586
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:16,657
And all the women were like,
"Ooh, he's such a man."

587
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:19,924
Now, you see a guy running across
the beach with no shirt on,

588
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:22,659
and no body hair or leg...
anywhere, there's no hair.

589
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,633
And women are like,
"That's what a man should look like!"

590
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:26,066
No, that's what a fucking
woman should look like.

591
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:33,343
They do it to target the younger women.

592
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:35,378
Younger women generally
fall for this shit.

593
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,175
I know, because I sleep around.

594
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:41,281
I don't discriminate. Young, old...

595
00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:43,115
Sexy's sexy.

596
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:47,016
I was with this one girl,
she was in her early 20s,

597
00:36:47,228 --> 00:36:53,531
I took of my shirt and she got physically
mad that I had hair on my chest.

598
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:57,329
She started pointing, she was like,
"Ew! You're fucking gross!"

599
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:01,799
Have you ever felt your penis invert?
Have you ever had that feeling?

600
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:15,922
I had to sit down and pee for a month.

601
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:18,455
Speaking of sit down and pee,
look who's back!

602
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:29,101
You were gone long, damn.

603
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:30,600
You were like, "Hey, we're going
to go see the Indian guy,

604
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:32,465
maybe we should have Indian food."

605
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,748
She's like, "Honey I don't think Indian
food with such a good idea tonight."

606
00:37:47,354 --> 00:37:49,515
You're Italian, are you a hairy dude?

607
00:37:49,723 --> 00:37:51,247
Yeah? And you like it, right?

608
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,925
It's good, it's more masculine
when they're hairy, isn't it?

609
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:56,189
You don't like hair? Look, you paused,
you did an inhale, you did this, I went,

610
00:37:56,397 --> 00:37:59,230
"You like hairy,"
she went, "Um..."

611
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,225
He doesn't have what?

612
00:38:02,436 --> 00:38:03,767
He doesn't have back hair,
that's the problem.

613
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:07,304
Oh, back hair is the problem.
He doesn't have back hair, so he's ok.

614
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,605
Ooh...

615
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:16,645
Fuck that.

616
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,911
Men are hairy, that's how we're built.
And I'm not saying that if you were born

617
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:23,351
without body hair that you're less of a
man, that's just the way God built you.

618
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:25,184
Maybe he doesn't love you as much.

619
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:32,932
But, I'm saying I don't trust guys that
have hair and get rid of it.

620
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,158
I don't trust you,
you're a fucking douche bag.

621
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:42,538
There's certain grooming that's okay,
that is acceptable in my eyes, you know,

622
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:46,679
like if you have a unibrow...

623
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,711
and you get rid of the middle.

624
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:52,408
That's fine.
I had a unibrow. I got rid of it.

625
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,348
I've got two eyebrows now.

626
00:38:55,856 --> 00:38:58,950
That to me made good sense
mathematically.

627
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:02,151
If I have one, chop it in half,
I have two!

628
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,826
But I don't trust dudes,
you did your eyebrows,

629
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:12,369
I see you did brother,
I know you did. Italian guy...

630
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:14,200
No, you did the middle,
and then You got carried away

631
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:16,899
because your shit is...

632
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:19,079
Get a shot of that guy!
His shit is way too neat!

633
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:24,276
Look at how neat that is!

634
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:28,353
That's not natural!

635
00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:31,422
Men shouldn't pluck their eyebrows!

636
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:35,527
Because we don't know what
the end result is supposed to look like!

637
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:38,027
I said to one of my friends,
I go, "Yo man, you've got a unibrow."

638
00:39:38,232 --> 00:39:40,632
"Yo man, what should I do?"

639
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,529
"Here are some tweezers."

640
00:39:42,736 --> 00:39:46,797
"Okay. What do I do now?"
"Just pluck them out dude,

641
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:49,635
pluck them out!
I'll leave you to it."

642
00:39:49,843 --> 00:39:54,212
I left him to it. I left him at his house,
he shows up at my house the next day...

643
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:56,440
He kept plucking his eyebrows.

644
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,481
He shows up at my house
the next day like this...

645
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:04,117
I'm like, "Did you do something
to your eyebrows?"

646
00:40:04,324 --> 00:40:06,918
"No, why?"

647
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:09,186
"Oh, I don't know, because you look
fucking surprised!"

648
00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:13,960
For two weeks, I couldn't
take the guy seriously.

649
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:15,965
"I've got some bad news."

650
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:25,206
How do you sleep with that shit?

651
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:38,748
I'll admit to doing one extra thing,
and I'll admit it to you.

652
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,722
I trim the hair on my chest.

653
00:40:40,928 --> 00:40:43,954
I trim it. I don't shave it off,
I just trim it down.

654
00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:45,188
Let's see!

655
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:46,423
We'll talk after, sweetheart.

656
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:53,236
I have clippers that I travel with,
you know, for your hair,

657
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,204
and I trim the hair on my chest.

658
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,605
You know, I give myself like, a fade.

659
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,578
You know why I trim? I'll tell you,
I have a reason for trimming it.

660
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:05,251
Just because I don't want this shit,
hanging out the front of my shirt

661
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:06,783
like this.

662
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:11,253
I hate... Now see, yours is low,
you're okay.

663
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,323
I don't like when I'm talking to somebody
and they have this shit hanging out

664
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:16,087
the front of their shirts because it
distracts the hell out of me.

665
00:41:16,296 --> 00:41:19,356
"Hey, what's up?"
"Oh nothing, got a new job...

666
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:22,091
Thinking about buying some real estate.

667
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:26,796
Met a new girl, she's really great."

668
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,907
And then a breeze comes along and...

669
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:40,914
So, I trim it, I trim it down.
I start here.

670
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,023
You know, I start with a zero.

671
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:49,559
Then one, two, three, it's nice.
You know, very gradual.

672
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:51,754
It's a really good fade.

673
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:54,160
It looks like the back of
Arsenio Hall's head in '91.

674
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:57,030
Just a really good fade.

675
00:41:58,138 --> 00:42:00,572
Why are you acting like I'm the only guy
in this room who shaves his balls?

676
00:42:00,774 --> 00:42:02,765
Why?
Why is this happening right now?

677
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:06,672
You're a ball shaver, aren't you?

678
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,212
I mean, I don't mean of everybody,
I mean of your own. I mean...

679
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:17,589
I don't mean like you've got
a shop in the street, you know,

680
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:19,452
"Welcome to
Barney's Ball Shaving Hut."

681
00:42:21,995 --> 00:42:24,225
You don't shave your balls, dude?

682
00:42:24,431 --> 00:42:28,197
Why wouldn't you? It's just better!

683
00:42:28,402 --> 00:42:29,994
It's free!

684
00:42:30,203 --> 00:42:31,864
I could stand here right now
and do this, look...

685
00:42:34,408 --> 00:42:36,569
And I know my balls are going...

686
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:40,506
You have a big bush, they're not moving,
they're just moving with you.

687
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,442
Women appreciate the effort.
When you pull it out

688
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:47,642
and there's nothing there, look.

689
00:42:49,056 --> 00:42:50,819
See, those are the sluts that
see a lot of dick. Those are them.

690
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:56,458
Hello whores!

691
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:04,169
It's better! It's just better presentation,
that's why.

692
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:08,307
And the real reason, honestly,
the real reason I shave it down?

693
00:43:08,508 --> 00:43:09,634
To make my dick look bigger.
That's why.

694
00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:12,909
It's true, that's why,
I'm not afraid to admit it.

695
00:43:13,113 --> 00:43:14,774
You know, if you mow the lawn,
the yard looks bigger.

696
00:43:14,982 --> 00:43:15,971
That's what you do, that's...

697
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:22,817
Because let's be honest, as a brown
man to another brown man.

698
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:25,491
God wasn't kind to us in the dick
department, alright.

699
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:30,625
I'm not saying he
short-changed us, okay?

700
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:34,198
I'm just saying that he didn't
give us any extra shit.

701
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:38,394
God gave Indian people a lot of things,
big dicks, not one of them.

702
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:40,903
He was like, "Alright, here's what's
going to happen, Indians...

703
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:43,906
You're going to be great
with computers."

704
00:43:44,111 --> 00:43:47,740
"Okay..."

705
00:43:47,948 --> 00:43:51,714
"You're going to be able to survive
in the worst conditions imaginable."

706
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:54,546
"Okay..."

707
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:57,315
"You're going to be able to leave those
conditions, go anywhere in the world

708
00:43:57,524 --> 00:43:58,957
and become successful."

709
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,421
"Fantastic..."

710
00:44:01,862 --> 00:44:03,591
"Hey God?"
"Yeah?"

711
00:44:03,797 --> 00:44:05,628
"What about penises?"

712
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:06,890
"Sorry, buddy."

713
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:09,960
"Average."

714
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,194
Then he called the black people over,

715
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:12,429
"Come here for a minute,
I want to talk to you."

716
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,337
"Listen, um, people are going to be
fucking with you for centuries."

717
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:23,714
"Here's a little extra dick."

718
00:44:25,285 --> 00:44:27,082
"Nah, don't worry about it,
I took it from the Indians, it's okay."

719
00:44:32,492 --> 00:44:34,926
It colour matches perfectly.

720
00:44:43,336 --> 00:44:47,033
But I do, I do, and see,
the media put that in our heads too.

721
00:44:48,075 --> 00:44:50,737
They made us insecure
about the size of our penises.

722
00:44:50,944 --> 00:44:53,105
You watch a porno nowadays,
you see these guys with

723
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:55,838
these giant hogs on 'em,

724
00:44:56,049 --> 00:45:00,884
these fucking Chernobyl waste,
nuclear reactor dicks on them.

725
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:04,822
You watch that, and you see this guy,
and you're like all my God I'm never

726
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:06,083
going to have a dick like that.

727
00:45:06,293 --> 00:45:07,954
You're not supposed
to have a dick like that!

728
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:13,321
Animals shouldn't have dicks like that!

729
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:16,058
Then you watch TV late at night,
they've got all these products,

730
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:19,932
male enhancement pills and...
"Honey, what's that?"

731
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,108
"It's a natural male enhancement."

732
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:23,469
"Oh really? For energy?"

733
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:27,909
"No. Natural male enhancement."

734
00:45:28,115 --> 00:45:29,548
"Ooh!"

735
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,775
They make you insecure
about the size of your penis

736
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:35,011
and then women see this
and they get caught up in the hype!

737
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:38,350
I've heard chicks, "Oh my God,
I just want a guy with a big dick.

738
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:41,584
I just like guys with big dicks.
I don't know, they're something

739
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:43,763
about a big dick that I just love.

740
00:45:43,964 --> 00:45:47,195
I don't even care what he looks like,
if he's got a big dick, that's cool."

741
00:45:48,602 --> 00:45:50,365
I'm like, that's because you're
a fucking whore, that's why.

742
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:55,335
Your vagina's huge!

743
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,806
You know, instead of giving me
a pill to make my dick bigger,

744
00:45:58,011 --> 00:45:59,569
here's a cream to tighten you up!

745
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:17,061
So, what I'm saying is, as a brown man,
with my balls shaved and everything,

746
00:46:17,264 --> 00:46:20,131
I can confidently whip out my wiener.

747
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,028
I can go like this, "ta-da!"

748
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,773
But if you have a big bush down there...

749
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:30,602
You're going to pull it out and she's
going be like, "Is that it?"

750
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:33,211
and you go,
"No, no, but wait, there's more!"

751
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,058
Ladies, what I'm saying is...

752
00:46:47,694 --> 00:46:51,130
you shouldn't get caught up
in all that penis size hype.

753
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:53,492
Just don't get caught up in it.
Because let me tell you something.

754
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,727
You need to start sleeping with us guys
with smaller, to regular sized penises.

755
00:46:59,105 --> 00:47:01,835
Because we put in way more effort.

756
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:04,237
Let me tell you something, guys with big
dicks are never going to make love to

757
00:47:04,444 --> 00:47:05,706
you properly. You know why?

758
00:47:05,912 --> 00:47:08,779
They don't have to.
They've got a big dick!

759
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,313
They just show up!

760
00:47:11,718 --> 00:47:12,946
"Was'sup?"

761
00:47:24,364 --> 00:47:26,525
I can't believe I did that
with my mom in the audience!

762
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:34,195
Sorry Mom!

763
00:47:34,407 --> 00:47:36,671
I have a theory, alright?

764
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:43,177
I have a theory.
I believe that the size of your penis

765
00:47:43,383 --> 00:47:48,218
is indirect correlation with how
much sex you will have in your life.

766
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:51,683
The smaller your dick,
the more you will fuck.

767
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:56,087
Because we got our pride
is riding on it, you know?

768
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:57,456
Our ego is at stake.

769
00:47:57,664 --> 00:47:58,688
"You got a small dick."
"Oh yeah? You think I have

770
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:01,595
a small dick? I'm going to fuck you,
I'm going to fuck your friends...

771
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:04,361
I'm going to fuck this stool, I don't care!
I'll fuck, a water bottle!

772
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:07,039
I'll fuck everything! We don't care,
we're just fucking everything!"

773
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:12,278
The smaller your dick,
the more you will fuck.

774
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:16,210
You don't believe me? Look at the two
largest populations in the world.

775
00:48:26,326 --> 00:48:29,352
Chinese guys started clapping like,
"Yeah! Oh, wait a minute..."

776
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:34,189
"Diu lai lo-mo!"

777
00:48:45,111 --> 00:48:47,409
It's funny, I look over at the kid,
he's just like...

778
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:52,041
"I don't know what's
happening anymore."

779
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:53,810
"I don't even have balls yet."

780
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:03,925
I hope it wasn't a shot of the kid's nuts;
that would be awkward, wouldn't it?

781
00:49:08,668 --> 00:49:12,229
I don't like a lot of sports, I'll be honest
with ya. I hate soccer, I hate soccer.

782
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:17,740
No, what are you...
You boo because I have an opinion?

783
00:49:17,944 --> 00:49:19,377
"Boo your opinion!"

784
00:49:21,047 --> 00:49:25,416
"Get out of America!
We don't like your thoughts!"

785
00:49:25,618 --> 00:49:27,950
I hate soccer! Fuck soccer!

786
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:31,947
And fuck you for liking it!

787
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,691
Let me tell you why I don't like soccer.
Because they have this World Cup.

788
00:49:36,896 --> 00:49:38,591
World Cup.

789
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:40,095
Let me tell you something
about the World Cup.

790
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,791
It's not the fucking World Cup.
You know why?

791
00:49:43,036 --> 00:49:44,901
Because the two countries that
represent me are never in

792
00:49:45,105 --> 00:49:46,094
the World Cup.

793
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:49,839
Canada and India are never
in the World Cup.

794
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:52,807
Canada, for obvious reasons.

795
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:54,139
It's a world event.

796
00:49:59,786 --> 00:50:01,344
We don't get involved in world events.

797
00:50:01,554 --> 00:50:03,852
We look at the U.S.,
are you guys going?

798
00:50:04,324 --> 00:50:08,226
Yeah? Oh, no, go ahead,
that's great, yeah, that's perfect, yeah.

799
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:10,726
No, no, we'll stay back; we'll tidy up.
Don't worry about it, it's cool.

800
00:50:12,132 --> 00:50:14,566
It always bothers me that India
is never in the World Cup!

801
00:50:14,768 --> 00:50:16,633
We're the second largest
population in the world!

802
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:19,703
There's 1.2 billion people over there!

803
00:50:19,906 --> 00:50:21,840
We can't come up with
11 fucking guys to make a team?

804
00:50:25,178 --> 00:50:26,236
You know what the problem is?

805
00:50:26,446 --> 00:50:30,246
You have no idea how hard it is to kick a
ball straight with curly toed shoes on.

806
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:34,442
We're standing in the middle of the field,

807
00:50:34,654 --> 00:50:38,055
"I'm open, I'm open!"

808
00:50:38,258 --> 00:50:39,816
"Where the hell is the ball going?"

809
00:50:42,962 --> 00:50:45,089
It always freaks me out that the Chinese
are never in the World Cup.

810
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:48,734
You're the largest population in the
world and you're known for kicking.

811
00:50:50,503 --> 00:50:52,164
Waa! But it's kicking!

812
00:50:55,442 --> 00:50:57,410
You know why I want to see the
Chinese team in the World Cup?

813
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,441
I want to see the Chinese team
when they get into their huddle.

814
00:50:59,646 --> 00:51:01,341
That's what I really want to see.

815
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:02,674
You see all the other countries when
they get into their huddle,

816
00:51:02,882 --> 00:51:04,110
"Alright guys,
we're going to get out there,

817
00:51:04,317 --> 00:51:05,545
we're going to pass that ball around,

818
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:08,687
we're going to have a good time.
Alright? Go team!"

819
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:10,480
Then you see the Chinese team,

820
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,853
"Okay..."

821
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:19,864
"Hey asshole, listen up!"

822
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:22,967
"When you see the ball coming...

823
00:51:23,169 --> 00:51:26,070
Then you go down the field!"

824
00:51:26,272 --> 00:51:28,934
"Chase the gwai-lo with the ball!"

825
00:51:29,142 --> 00:51:31,610
"Something's going down!"

826
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:33,244
"Be a man!"

827
00:51:44,491 --> 00:51:47,255
I love Latin people.
They're fun to me, man.

828
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,725
You're Latino, bro, are you?
What are you?

829
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,764
Colombian. Your girl, Latina? She...

830
00:51:54,968 --> 00:51:56,367
What are you, Colombian as well?

831
00:51:56,569 --> 00:51:57,934
Oh, you found each other.

832
00:51:59,706 --> 00:52:01,230
"Mira, Colombiana?"

833
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:02,430
"Si."

834
00:52:05,678 --> 00:52:06,975
"Colombiano?"

835
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,579
"Si."

836
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:09,770
"Ay-yay-yay..."

837
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:19,425
I love Latin people.
Any Portuguese people here tonight?

838
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:21,184
Portuguese? Really?

839
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:23,794
Brazilian too? Any Brazilians?
You're Brazilian?

840
00:52:23,997 --> 00:52:25,430
Brazilians speak Portuguese,
though, right?

841
00:52:25,632 --> 00:52:27,463
You speak Portuguese,
though right? Yeah.

842
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:28,929
So if you speak Portuguese...

843
00:52:29,135 --> 00:52:30,796
Obviously, you can understand
Spanish then, right?

844
00:52:31,004 --> 00:52:33,598
Because they're very similar to each
other, aren't they?

845
00:52:33,806 --> 00:52:35,171
You ever hear somebody
speaking Portuguese?

846
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:38,242
Doesn't it sound like Spanish being
spoken by a deaf person?

847
00:52:39,779 --> 00:52:43,112
Portuguese just sounds like really badly
pronounced Spanish, doesn't it?

848
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:46,342
Here's a Spanish guy counting to three:
"Unos, dos, tres."

849
00:52:46,553 --> 00:52:48,851
Here's a Portuguese guy:
"Unos, dos, tres."

850
00:52:51,824 --> 00:52:54,816
"Quattro, cinqo!"

851
00:52:55,028 --> 00:52:56,427
"Fa-ga-ga!"

852
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:02,668
Here's a Spanish guy:
"Como estas?"

853
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,303
Here's a Portuguese guy:
"Como estas?"

854
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,107
"Gnaa!"

855
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:12,471
You know, somebody got
mad at me one night.

856
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:14,203
They go, "You know, Russell...

857
00:53:14,414 --> 00:53:16,541
it's cool when you make
fun of different races."

858
00:53:16,749 --> 00:53:18,740
"But you shouldn't talk
about deaf people."

859
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:20,214
I was like, "What?"

860
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,285
"Yeah, you shouldn't
talk about deaf people."

861
00:53:22,488 --> 00:53:24,479
No seriously, what?

862
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:27,926
You know what?
Fuck deaf people!

863
00:53:29,462 --> 00:53:30,622
Are they here?

864
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:35,231
Even if they were, it's up to you
to tell them what I'm saying.

865
00:53:37,337 --> 00:53:39,567
Fuck 'em in their ears!

866
00:53:39,772 --> 00:53:41,637
Let me tell you something
about deaf people.

867
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:43,506
Does anybody here
know sign language?

868
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:46,612
And I mean actual
sign language. Not this.

869
00:53:46,814 --> 00:53:50,477
And not gang signs. You can't do
gang signs to a deaf person.

870
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:52,311
They'd be like,
"That guy stutters."

871
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:54,510
You know.

872
00:53:57,992 --> 00:54:01,587
If you know sign language, you'll know
that I'm not making this shit up.

873
00:54:01,795 --> 00:54:06,323
Whoever invented sign language had
their own little racist agenda happening.

874
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:08,831
Because sign language is a very
offensive way of communicating.

875
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:13,439
They're trying to change it now
to make it more politically correct.

876
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,108
I'm serious, do you know what
the sign for Chinese person is?

877
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,835
Let me tell you something.
It's exactly what you think it is.

878
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:28,220
Do you still feel bad for these
deaf sons-of-bitches?

879
00:54:28,422 --> 00:54:31,016
You know, what the sign
for Indian person is?

880
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:38,291
Because I live in LA,
I had to learn the sign for Mexican.

881
00:54:38,499 --> 00:54:39,864
I learned two signs for Mexican.

882
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,729
The first one doesn't even seem
offensive 'till you find out what it is.

883
00:54:42,936 --> 00:54:46,235
Here's the first sign for Mexican, look.

884
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,374
You know what that is? A poncho.

885
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:55,077
Here's the second sign for Mexican,
this is fucked up too! Look.

886
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:58,908
A long-ass moustache!

887
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,952
What the fuck does that have
to do with being Mexican?

888
00:55:02,156 --> 00:55:07,184
My gardener's never shown
up at my house, "Ola senor!"

889
00:55:07,394 --> 00:55:09,385
"I'm here to shave the grass!"

890
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:16,869
You're Colombian, I don't know what
the sign for Colombian is. Probably...

891
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:18,470
You know, I don't know, I'm just saying.

892
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:26,040
Cubans, probably...

893
00:55:27,881 --> 00:55:31,248
I don't know, I'm just saying.
I'm speculating on these ones.

894
00:55:32,753 --> 00:55:35,221
Black people, I don't know what
the sign for black people is.

895
00:55:35,422 --> 00:55:37,583
It's probably fucked up,
you know what I mean?

896
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:40,624
I don't know,
I think he was a knee-grow.

897
00:55:40,828 --> 00:55:44,559
I'm just saying, I don't know.
I cannot confirm these ones.

898
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,691
But anything is possible.

899
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:52,470
Do you know what the sign for retard is?

900
00:55:52,673 --> 00:55:55,540
This is foul. I'm not making this up.
This is the sign for retard...

901
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:56,902
That's the sign for retard!

902
00:56:00,447 --> 00:56:02,711
You could have two deaf guys
standing there like, "Hey, look."

903
00:56:04,785 --> 00:56:07,777
You have handicapped people mocking
other handicapped people!

904
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:15,722
Jews, I don't know what you've
done to the deaf community,

905
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:19,626
I don't know if they had land
and you wanted it, but I learned...

906
00:56:27,808 --> 00:56:32,507
I learned three signs for Jewish people.
And I'm not making this shit up.

907
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:35,841
Each sign is progressively more
offensive than the next.

908
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:39,352
The first, here is the first
sign for Jewish person.

909
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:42,954
Now the first sign isn't so bad.
It kind of makes sense when you see it.

910
00:56:43,157 --> 00:56:45,387
Here's the first sign
for Jewish person, look.

911
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:48,383
Right? It's a long beard.

912
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:49,789
You go oh, that makes sense,
a Hasidic guy.

913
00:56:49,997 --> 00:56:51,089
Yeah it makes sense, right?

914
00:56:51,298 --> 00:56:52,993
Then they start to get fucked up.
And I'm not making this shit up.

915
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,464
Here's the second sign
for Jewish person.

916
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:00,670
That's fucked up,
isn't it?

917
00:57:00,874 --> 00:57:02,569
And here's the third sign for Jew.

918
00:57:02,776 --> 00:57:05,370
And I'm not making
any of this shit up, look!

919
00:57:07,814 --> 00:57:09,748
That is some foul shit!

920
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:14,109
Arabs, I don't know what
the sign for Arab is,

921
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:16,881
but I can only imagine,
you know...

922
00:57:20,761 --> 00:57:22,752
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

923
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:25,022
You know what, it can't be
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

924
00:57:25,232 --> 00:57:27,291
Because deaf people can't hit that note!

925
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:29,526
Nga-nga-nga-nga-nga-nga!

926
00:57:29,736 --> 00:57:31,670
Thank you very much, New York,
you guys were awesome!

927
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:33,007
Good
night.

928
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:59,041
