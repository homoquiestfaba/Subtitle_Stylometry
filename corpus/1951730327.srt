00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:09,033
[Boy]
It's been a classic pitchers'
duel with Cole McKay,

2
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:10,834
the team's closer,

3
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:12,667
digging himself
out of a hole.

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,133
Working the edges
of the plate.

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,467
It's the bottom of the ninth,
two out,

6
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:21,067
the winning run
threatening on third.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,300
And the pitch.

8
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,367
Swing and a miss.

9
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:33,033
The count now 3-2.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,400
Grady pounds his bat
on the plate in frustration.

11
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,367
[horn honks]

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,267
[bell tolling]

13
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:08,701
Let's have a look.

14
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,968
All right.
You look fine.

15
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,901
[door opens]

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,901
[bell tolling]

17
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:20,400
[chattering]

18
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:34,868
Get rid of the gum.

19
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:36,634
Swallow it.

20
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:39,434
[swallows hard]

21
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:41,534
Don't get
your mother upset.

22
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,100
[sniffling]

23
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,501
What's with Kathleen?
We barely even knew her.

24
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,434
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with her.

25
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,334
She loved to sing.

26
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:59,000
Go keep an eye
on your brother.

27
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:08,033
I'm sorry for your loss.

28
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,968
Me and Anthony
are going to a party
later on.

29
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:15,167
You wanna come?
Save it, Terry. Not now.

30
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,934
Yeah, whatever.
Like she's gonna hear us.

31
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,067
She looks really good,
considering--

32
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,567
This old bat looks better now
than when she was alive.

33
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,901
[scoffs]

34
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,334
How much would you pay me
if I give her a kiss?

35
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,033
T-Terry, not now.

36
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:34,100
She's got a piece of snot
hanging out of her
right nostril.

37
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,300
You think that's real,
or you think they
stuck that in there?

38
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,334
Cut it out.
This is Dad's sister.

39
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:41,400
So what? She never
said two words to me

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,901
or to the old man.

41
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:44,334
All right.
Well, forget that now.

42
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,400
She's dead,
so just say a prayer
or something.

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,968
I don't know any.

44
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:52,934
Eight years of Catholic school,
and you don't know one prayer?

45
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:56,501
Bless us, our Father,
for these, thy gifts
we are about to receive--

46
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:59,367
Not that. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

47
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,634
I'll be out
in the car.

48
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:05,834
[Cole] Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done--
[door opens]

49
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,300
on earth--
[muttering]
[door closes]

50
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,868
Lead us not
into temptation--

51
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:13,033
Lead us <i>snot</i>
into temptation.

52
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,601
Thank you.
[chuckling]

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What are you doing, bro?

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,968
What's it look like?

55
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,100
Coming with us
or what?

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,467
Where to?

57
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,667
I already told you.
To a party, remember?

58
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,968
Someone invited
the two of you to a party?

59
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,801
[chuckling]
[scoffs]
Forget about it.

60
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:37,601
We don't need
no pure alter boy
hanging with us.

61
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:39,467
Pure as your mother.

62
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:41,300
Have you even seen
a girl yet, huh?

63
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,801
Look, forget it.

64
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,367
I just thought
since you never get out--

65
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:55,000
He coming or what?
We got him.

66
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:57,968
[rabbit cage opens]

67
00:04:57,968 --> 00:05:00,400
Guys, wait up.

68
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,868
It's the O'Leary family.
They went to the Cape.

69
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:19,200
Big deal, right?
[chuckling]

70
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,701
I thought we were
going to a party.

71
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:23,501
[whispering]
Shut up!
What are you guys doing?

72
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,067
[dog barking]

73
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,267
I'll hold your coat.

74
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,267
You're out of your minds.
Don't puss out on us.

75
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,167
You're the only one
who can squeeze through.

76
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,667
No, forget it.
I'm not doing this.

77
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,767
Quit dicking around
and do as I say.

78
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,701
Get off of me!
Trying to say something, huh?

79
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,567
I can't hear you.

80
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:50,133
The only thing I hear is,
"Okay, Terry, I'll do it."

81
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,434
You're both assholes.

82
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,968
We lower you in,
you go upstairs

83
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:00,167
and you open the door,
okay?

84
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,200
Okay?

85
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,601
Bingo!

86
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:16,567
[clock chiming]

87
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:20,267
Come on.

88
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,067
Come on!

89
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,667
Come on, buttercup.
Wake up.

90
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,968
[clock chiming]

91
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,467
[Boy]
What you got, man?
Anything good?

92
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,467
[Terry]
Watches.

93
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:02,701
[Boy mutters, chuckles]

94
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,367
Oh, Terry!

95
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,334
Come here.
Check this out.

96
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,267
Nice.
I'm keeping this, all right?

97
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:17,534
Yeah.

98
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,200
[car approaches]

99
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,801
[Terry]
Shit!

100
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,334
Let's go.

101
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,901
[Boy]
Pop.

102
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,200
Where's my brother?
Forget about him.

103
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,167
O'Leary's in
the driveway, man!

104
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,133
Cole! Cole!

105
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,767
Get up!
Come on, get up!

106
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,100
Cole, pick your feet up!
Come on.

107
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,534
Get up!

108
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:09,234
[door unlocking]

109
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:13,000
[Man]
Hey! Who the hell is that?

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,834
Open the goddamn door!
Come on!

111
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,501
Come on, get up!
Open the door!

112
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,200
[knocking]

113
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,000
Kathleen,
I've brought you something.

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,200
Can I come in?

115
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,834
Yeah.

116
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:39,400
Should call this
"morning, afternoon
and evening" sickness.

117
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,234
I know you can't eat it now,
but I made you a sandwich.

118
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,434
It's important you eat.
Oh, God, Ma, get it out.

119
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:48,067
Peanut butter.
I can smell it.

120
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,567
You need the protein.

121
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,067
I need to feel normal again.

122
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,934
I know. I know.

123
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:03,934
Does this mean
you're not mad at me?

124
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:06,901
Don't get
the wrong idea, Katie.

125
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:11,667
I'm still mad at you
and that boyfriend of yours,

126
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,868
but we'll get everything
taken care of.

127
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,467
You know what
we discussed, Ma?

128
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:23,100
It's not such
a terrible thing.

129
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,200
No child of mine
is having an abortion.

130
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,834
Oh, no.
[dog whines]

131
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,334
[Dad]
No running
in the house!

132
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:07,767
Kid listens good.

133
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:34,067
What's with you?
My rabbit.

134
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,801
I forgot to give her
her medicine.

135
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:39,868
Didn't make it, huh?

136
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,200
Looks like it's gonna be
rabbit fricassee tonight.

137
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,400
[chuckles]

138
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Why don't you fellas
go on ahead?
I'll meet you later.

139
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,734
If I'm late, I want
a 20 on Early Warning.
You got that?

140
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,968
No problemo, Des.
Yeah, I'd hustle if I was you.

141
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,667
There's some good picks
out there today.
Oh, I know it.

142
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,367
You think you can get one
past your old man, huh?

143
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,000
[door opens]

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,567
What do you mean?
[door closes]

145
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:08,834
When you were crying
like a girl, I smelled
booze on your breath.

146
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,067
You can't have it
both ways.

147
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,434
Either you cry like a girl

148
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,567
or you drink like a man.

149
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,100
What's it gonna be?

150
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,801
You think you can drink
like a man at your age,

151
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,534
then follow through
and do it.

152
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,767
As my father used to say,

153
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,701
"Save the tears
for the cemetery

154
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,834
'cause they're wasted
on me."

155
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,467
Go ahead.

156
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,667
Maybe you
shouldn't drink, either.

157
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,300
What did you say?

158
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,567
Nothing.

159
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,501
You know, maybe when I ask you
what I should or shouldn't do,

160
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,968
you'll know you're
old enough to tell me.

161
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,400
Drink.

162
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:07,667
[spits]

163
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,634
[retching]

164
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,167
Clean up the mess.

165
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,767
Any of your friends
want a drink,
you know where to send 'em.

166
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:24,234
[growling]

167
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,234
Not again.

168
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:28,534
That's my goddamn shoe.

169
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:29,801
[growling continues]

170
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,334
Fine.

171
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:37,234
Didn't fit right, anyway,
you woolly-headed
son of a bitch.

172
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:40,767
[Priest]
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

173
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,701
[Cole]
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

174
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,968
How long has it been
since your last confession?

175
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,334
My last confession
was about a week a--

176
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,000
a m-month ago.

177
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,934
Go on, young man.

178
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,601
I've had impure thoughts.

179
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:01,734
I, uh, lied to my mother
a while back,

180
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:03,067
and my father.

181
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,901
I swore during
the Red Sox game when

182
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:07,834
Varitek booted the bunt
and they lost.

183
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:15,434
I got drunk
and robbed a house.

184
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,901
Could you repeat that?

185
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,734
I--

186
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,501
I've had impure thoughts.
No.

187
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,234
The last part.

188
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:31,300
You mean getting drunk
and robbing-- robbing a house.

189
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,100
This is very disturbing, Cole.

190
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,734
You know--

191
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:37,100
All those Sundays
with you beside me,

192
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,567
I should hope
I recognize your voice.

193
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,234
Father, I feel terrible.

194
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,067
My brother
suckered me in.

195
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:47,834
Terry is not the issue here.

196
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,634
You've gotta be
stronger than that.

197
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:54,067
There's a lot of bad
in the world,

198
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,767
and it's easy to gravitate
toward the bad.

199
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:00,100
Be left by the wayside.

200
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,200
Do you understand?

201
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:07,267
Yes, Father.
[sighs]

202
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:11,300
I want you
to think about

203
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,767
the clearest, purest thing
that God has given you.

204
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:21,067
Do you have any idea
what that could be?

205
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,501
Keep you focused.

206
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,067
It's baseball.

207
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,000
Baseball?

208
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:34,634
[sighs]

209
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:37,400
What about your plans
to go into the priesthood?

210
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:41,901
Father, you asked a question.
That's what came out.

211
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:50,033
All you got
is that one pitch.

212
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:52,367
Sooner or later,
I'm gonna catch up to it.

213
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,567
Come on.

214
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:07,000
Let me see it.
Let me see it.

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,133
[clatter, cat yowls]
That was our only ball.

216
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,067
[Woman] Hey!
What are you looking at?

217
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,534
You old hagged-up bitch!
Watch your mouth!

218
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:21,534
[window closes]
I guess the game's over, then.

219
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:23,501
Cole, don't think you're
anything special, okay?

220
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,367
When it's a money pitch,
I can throw like that, too.

221
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,267
All right, Terry.

222
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,767
Don't be late tonight.

223
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,567
It's Kathleen's
going-away dinner.

224
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,667
Good hitting.
Yeah, you, too.

225
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,667
Mmm. Smells good.

226
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,334
Fancy dishes.

227
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:53,701
It's the good china.
From your mother, remember?

228
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:56,968
[chuckles]
Haven't seen these
in a lifetime.

229
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,701
You kids were in diapers
when I saw these last.

230
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,901
You kids were all
beautiful children.

231
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:03,434
Weren't they?
[Father chuckles]

232
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:04,968
They were.

233
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,901
Even Terry.
[laughs]

234
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:08,767
Terry? No way.
Yeah.

235
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,501
Where is he?

236
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:16,801
I think I saw him outside
with Anthony.

237
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,901
Ah, the brain trust.
Go get him, will ya?

238
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:22,200
It's your sister's
going-away dinner.

239
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,901
It's okay.
I'll go get him.

240
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,734
[clears throat]

241
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,467
It ain't fair.

242
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:34,100
The whole ball of wax
ain't fair.

243
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,467
There's going to be
another adjustment as well.

244
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,100
Concerns you.

245
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:41,834
Adjustment?

246
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,033
In order to pay
for your sister,
we're taking you

247
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,467
out of St. Mark's,
putting you in public.

248
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,801
[Cole sighs]

249
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,167
That's Terry's school.

250
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,400
I don't want an argument
out of you.

251
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,901
I'll make do.

252
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,868
Raiders are the best team
in the city.

253
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:00,868
I won't even
make that lineup.

254
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,868
And Father Magruder said
I have a good shot at being

255
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,534
on the varsity starting
rotation this year.

256
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:07,133
Why you worry about
something as trivial
as baseball

257
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,467
when you know your future
lies in the priesthood.

258
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,701
There you are, Terry.

259
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,534
Perhaps you can show
your brother around
when he gets to your school.

260
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:19,367
Gets to my school?
Yes, Terry.

261
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:23,534
You and your brother
are going to be attending
the same institution.

262
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:26,067
You want me to give him a tour?
That's a beauty.

263
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,901
I-I don't know if that's
such a good idea, Margaret.

264
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:33,300
He's two years behind me.
What am I gonna show him?

265
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,601
Oh, I'm catching up, though.

266
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:38,501
Have a seat, please,
so your sister can say grace.

267
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm not hungry.

268
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,501
Yes, you are. It's your
sister's goddamn dinner.

269
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,801
You want me to eat
all my vegetables?

270
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,634
That's enough!

271
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,734
Ah, this is just great.

272
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:54,467
The Brady Bunch
got nothing on us.

273
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:58,033
What a sham all this is.

274
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,167
Is anyone here
really happy?

275
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,667
Terry, calm down now, mmm?

276
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:09,868
You all think I'm dumb.

277
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:11,968
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.

278
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14,367
Smart enough to know
that if I study,
I get a "C,"

279
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,734
if not, I get a "C" minus,
so why bother, huh, Ma?

280
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,934
You and I both know
you could do much better
than a "C"

281
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:20,934
if you just applied yourself.

282
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,934
It's easier bein' a loser.

283
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:26,467
Nobody expects anything
out of Terry McKay.

284
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:28,834
Nobody here gives
a good goddamn about me

285
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,934
or what I want,
and none of you care.

286
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,801
Terry, that's not true.
Oh, it's not?

287
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,701
Then what's
my favorite color?

288
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,567
What's my favorite
baseball team?

289
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:39,100
Hey, Dad,
how come I didn't wanna
go to camp when I was eight?

290
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,834
Terry, I don't wanna hear it!
It's not about you tonight.

291
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:47,634
The money pitch.

292
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:53,400
Come here!
Think you're smart?

293
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,334
That's enough.

294
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,934
Stop it!
[blows landing]

295
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,200
[dog barking]

296
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,167
[Dad]
Damn it!

297
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
[engine starts]

298
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,901
[door closes]

299
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,167
[footsteps approaching]

300
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,501
Add one more
to the collection.

301
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,334
You'll have to take on
this wonderful chore
while I'm gone.

302
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:23,400
I'm so sorry they had
to pull you out of St. Mark's.

303
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:27,167
It's all right.

304
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,367
I'm actually--

305
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm kind of
looking forward to it.

306
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Change is good, right?

307
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Yeah, and you'll do fine.
You'll be so far ahead

308
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,667
you won't have to do
any homework for two years.

309
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:41,267
There'll be girls.

310
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:43,601
I heard rumors they exist.

311
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,834
[sighs]
Yeah.

312
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:52,400
By tomorrow this should be dry.
Then you hang the hook.

313
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,701
Three inches above the hole?

314
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,133
Mm-hmm.

315
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:01,834
Are you gonna be okay?

316
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,801
Yeah.

317
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,334
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

318
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,167
You should go to bed.

319
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,100
Pulling you out
is probably
a temporary thing.

320
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
I'll land another job.

321
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,234
I got part-time work
lined up already.

322
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,234
As soon as your sister's
taken care of,

323
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:52,734
I get back on my feet,
you're back on track
for the seminary.

324
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:57,901
It is what you want,
isn't it?

325
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:04,567
I'm not exactly sure
I'm cut out for it.

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,701
Since when?

327
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:10,767
You know, since--

328
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:13,767
since I've been
doing some thinking
on some of the vows.

329
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:17,467
Vows? Which ones?

330
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:21,200
Well, chastity,
for one.

331
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,367
You know, I'm not
exactly comfortable

332
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:26,434
with the idea
of being...chaste.

333
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:31,367
That's a doozy.

334
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,400
Are you getting laid?

335
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:37,601
Are ya?
Stop. No.

336
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:41,634
But besides playing ball,
it's all I can think about.

337
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,734
Perfectly natural.

338
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:49,000
Listen, from age 13
through my late 20s,

339
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
all I could think about
was pus--

340
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,701
w-was sex.

341
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:55,634
Really?
Really.

342
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:57,400
Then I met your mother.

343
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:06,968
Wait a minute.
You know about the birds
and the bees, right?

344
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,901
You know how the whole
thing works, don't you?

345
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:11,167
Yeah, Dad, I know.
Yeah, well, I know you know.

346
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:14,667
Attending that institution
doesn't exactly expose you
to the world.

347
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,234
Yeah, well,
I got it figured out.

348
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:21,534
Well, you know, it's not
like you see in <i>Playboy.</i>

349
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,100
You know,
it gets all wet--

350
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:28,167
I--

351
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,901
You know, this--
That's okay, you know?

352
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:32,834
But not too much.

353
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:34,834
And, uh,
[clears throat]

354
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:37,834
always, always gift wrap
your package.

355
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,634
You know, protection.
We're gonna--
We're gonna be late.

356
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:42,434
Uh--
[clears throat]
Yeah.

357
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:47,033
[car approaching,
radio blaring]

358
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,067
 <i>* Everything that we</i>
 <i>believed in, it all</i>
 <i>turned out to be a lie *</i>

359
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,734
[car, radio off]

360
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,067
[car door opens, closes]

361
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,467
Taking matters
into your own hands?

362
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:13,567
Is your boyfriend David
gonna drive the bus?

363
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,200
The faggot.

364
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,000
Go away, Terry.
I don't wanna deal with you
right now.

365
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:27,501
Come on. Get in.

366
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:33,167
I'll drive you...
wherever you wanna go.

367
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:49,334
You know you have a fine,
young ballplayer here.

368
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:53,334
Why, next season I'd wager
he'll make it into
the starting rotation.

369
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:55,334
There isn't gonna be
a next season, Father.

370
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:57,767
We're taking our son
out of St. Mark's.

371
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,167
Out?

372
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,834
I've always thought
that Cole was here

373
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:07,467
because his faith
was central to him.

374
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:10,567
Have you found something
more important in your life?

375
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,834
No. No, Father.
Not-- Not at all.

376
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,501
It's, um--

377
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:16,501
It's the most important work
a man can do.

378
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:17,934
It's just--

379
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:21,868
It's-- It's just that--
Yeah.

380
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:24,300
Right now--
No one becomes
a priest nowadays.

381
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,534
I don't want my son
to become some sort of freak.

382
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,667
He's going
in a different direction.
Isn't that right?

383
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:32,167
Mr. McKay, I'd hardly
label our calling freakish.

384
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,367
Well, you might wanna consider
getting the Church
a good publicist then,

385
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,300
because, uh, you know,
your calling's been taking
a serious hit lately.

386
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,133
Here's the bottom line:

387
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,567
The kid's hormones
have finally kicked in.

388
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:45,334
He's no longer
interested.
Isn't that right?

389
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,067
Not exactly.

390
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:53,000
Have you made any short
or long-term plans?

391
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,667
I'm gonna
go to public school,

392
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,234
and, uh, I thought
I'd work as a waiter.

393
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,801
For now.
[sighs]

394
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,968
You've been such
a promising student.

395
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:06,334
Exemplary in all ways.

396
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:11,701
And now you'd prefer to serve
hamburgers instead of God?

397
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:15,567
It's a lot more practical.
McDonald's has served a few
more than Catholicism has.

398
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:18,667
How many billions
they up to now?
[chuckling]

399
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:22,000
This is not to be
made light of, Mr. McKay.

400
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
By choosing this path,
your son may very well

401
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,834
be stepping into the abyss.

402
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:30,467
Here he has a home and--
and a future.

403
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:33,267
Out there--

404
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:37,400
Every man has these urges
that you're feeling.

405
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,133
By denying them,
we make ourselves stronger,

406
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,567
holier.

407
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,234
Am I not right, Cole?

408
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:47,734
Yes, Father.

409
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:50,067
Yeah, that's a crock
if ever I heard it.

410
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,601
No wonder you guys
are so out of touch.

411
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:54,868
What you feel right here--

412
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:58,367
that tingle in your nuts--
is the most natural thing
in the universe.

413
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,901
It says you're alive,
and no amount of praying
is gonna make it go away.

414
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,834
It's what makes
the world go around.

415
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:05,868
You deny that,
you deny who you are.

416
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:08,767
I had no idea
that such a fine young man

417
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:11,367
could come from someone
who has such disdain

418
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,133
for God and his deeds.

419
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,901
Come on, Cole.
It's time to go.

420
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:21,467
Cole, come on!

421
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,300
We told him!

422
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,934
Huh? What's the matter?

423
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,934
You're a free man.

424
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,801
What do you say
we go celebrate,

425
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:39,901
get ourselves
a couple of beers
at O'Reilly's?

426
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:41,901
What the hell.
You're almost old enough.

427
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:44,267
No hard stuff, I promise.
Dad, I was thinking,

428
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:46,200
now that I'm at public,

429
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
maybe I could get a job,

430
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,167
bring in some money.

431
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:07,501
How about-- How about
dropping me at Marcellino's?

432
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,267
You're aiming high.

433
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:26,934
Want me to come in?

434
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:30,200
No, it's all right.
I'll come and tell you
when to pick me up.

435
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
Can you
spare some change?

436
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,734
Fuck off.
God bless.

437
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,567
[footsteps approaching]

438
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:33,300
Damn her.

439
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,534
Who?

440
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,701
Mom.

441
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:39,634
I can't do it.

442
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:59,367
[chattering]

443
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,601
[Man]
Is that coffee done?

444
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,267
Can I help you
with something?

445
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:08,767
Yeah, I'm looking
for the owner.

446
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,200
You're looking at him.
Start yakking.

447
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Oh, well, um,
I'm from the neighborhood,

448
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,968
and I was just hoping that
you could use me.

449
00:30:15,968 --> 00:30:18,400
For what?

450
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,434
Restaurant work.

451
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:24,033
Yeah? You ever
waited tables?
Uh, no.

452
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:27,033
Bussed?
No, sir.

453
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,133
Washed dishes?

454
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:31,133
Actually, yeah,
all the time.

455
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,367
Whereabouts?
Don't tell me.

456
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,033
At home.
Yeah.

457
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,868
Tell me this is
a recent career decision.

458
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:40,567
Well, I just decided
the other night,

459
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,868
but I really
wanna work here.

460
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,834
Yeah? I got a bunch
of Dominicans in the kitchen.

461
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:47,968
You know why?
No.

462
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,033
'Cause illegals work
cheap and hard

463
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:54,133
and they don't know
enough English
to give you any lip.

464
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:55,934
It's tough
to compete with that.

465
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,434
Okay, well, I could--

466
00:30:57,434 --> 00:31:00,033
You could pay me as much
as you pay them. Less, even.

467
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:02,968
I'll work even harder,
and as many hours as you want.
Come on. Let's go.

468
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:05,901
Come on. Let's go.
Listen, I need
to help out my family.

469
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,234
Chip in.

470
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,834
What's your name, kid?

471
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:15,334
Cole.

472
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:17,534
I'm Cole McKay.
Nice to meet you.

473
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:20,400
Joey Colasanto.

474
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,767
All right.
Here's what we do, Cole McKay.

475
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:25,734
You're gonna be
my utility man.

476
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:27,767
That means you do
whatever I need.

477
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:29,767
It could be washing dishes,
delivering meals,

478
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,901
parking cars, whatever.

479
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:34,934
You old enough to drive?
Yeah.

480
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:38,200
I could ask you your birthday,
or I could trust you.

481
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,501
Feel blessed
I hate math.

482
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:44,334
There's a delivery van
out back.

483
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,334
Make sure your feet
hit the pedals,

484
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:49,234
adjust the mirrors,
drive around a bit.

485
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:51,167
Then you start tonight.

486
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,400
You bang it up,
you not only get canned,

487
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,567
you wind up paying me back
for the rest of your life.

488
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,834
Got it?
Yeah, I got it.

489
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,467
Thank you so much. You--
You're not gonna be sorry.

490
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,467
You better hope not.

491
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:10,033
[Woman]
Kathleen McKay, right?
Yes, that's right.

492
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:12,634
I'm Sister Mary Elise,
your intake counselor.

493
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:14,634
Do you prefer
Kathleen or Katie?

494
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:17,834
I call her Katie.
Kathleen.

495
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,767
Let her help you.

496
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:27,567
I'll see you inside.

497
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:31,334
Do you have
everything you need?

498
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,767
Absolutely everything
a girl could want.

499
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,968
This is
the best thing, Katie.

500
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:42,734
You'll understand
someday and--
Thank you for it?

501
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:44,067
Yes, that's right.

502
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,701
It's just hard for you
to see that now.

503
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,934
I'll call you later.

504
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,467
Good-bye, Ma.

505
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,934
Well, look who decided
to join us to pursue
an education, huh?

506
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:29,667
All bright and shiny
for his first day.

507
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,601
You bring
your multivitamins?

508
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:33,501
Where were you
last night, Terry?

509
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,434
Don't sweat it.

510
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:37,367
I was around.

511
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:40,801
[sighs]

512
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:44,334
Those my pants?
Yeah. So?

513
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,434
So they're my pants.

514
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:50,534
Did you steal 'em?

515
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:52,901
No, I didn't steal them.
They were in the dryer.

516
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:56,601
I ran out of mine.
I didn't say
you could borrow those.

517
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,033
Hey, it's not a big deal.
Take off my pants.

518
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,667
I'll get 'em back to you.
[stammering]
No way.

519
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,133
Take off my pants now.

520
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,334
Terry, I'm not taking
off the pants.
Just forget it.

keep 'em on you.

Yes, sir. Cole McKay.

695
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,467
Sorry.

696
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,334
Look, don't worry,

697
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,100
You're just
getting started.

698
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:01,200
C'mon, you're young.

699
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,534
 You can still
 tolerate 'em.

700
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,801
Y-you're not a
bad-looking kid.

701
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,534
Look, all you
gotta do

702
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,701
is figure out what
they wanna hear.

703
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:11,567
You're in
like Flynn.

704
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:14,234
[sighs]

705
00:48:14,234 --> 00:48:16,100
I guarantee you
one thing, though:

706
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:19,267
each and every one of them

707
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:23,000
has some new and nutty
perspective on the world.

708
00:48:29,734 --> 00:48:32,567
Gee, thanks, Dad.

709
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:41,501
Don't mention it.

710
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:56,300
[dog barking]

711
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:02,801
[door opening]

712
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:04,934
King! King, come on boy!

713
00:49:04,934 --> 00:49:06,868
Yeah, baby, come here!

714
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:09,901
King! Come on baby,
come on.

715
00:49:09,901 --> 00:49:13,801
Come on, King, oh what's
up, buddy? Ohhhh....

716
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:16,133
King, I missed you!
You're all dirty.

717
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:19,834
[dog whining]
Where'd you go?

718
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:20,968
Where'd ya go, King?

719
00:49:20,968 --> 00:49:24,701
I missed you so
much. Come here.
Come on.

720
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,000
[Joey]
Where's my
utility man?

721
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,167
Cole? Where the
hell are you?

722
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,167
Right here, Joey.

723
00:49:33,934 --> 00:49:36,067
I want you to
drop everything
and deliver this.

724
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:38,267
It's going to Tommy Orsini,
he's at Skip's.

725
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:41,734
He's a very important man to
this restaurant and to my
family, you understand?

726
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:42,734
Yeah, I
got ya.

727
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:43,968
All right.

728
00:49:51,234 --> 00:49:54,000
Hey, there's my chow.
All right, bring it over 
here, kid, come on.

729
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,200
All right,
shine's over. Here.

730
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,667
Come on, kid,
bring it over.

731
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,834
You got me waiting here
a half hour, come on.

732
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,901
Here, come here.

733
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:10,300
Here, you keep
the change, all right?

734
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,634
Give my best to Joey.

735
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,534
What the hell is
going in here?
[sobbing]

736
00:50:57,934 --> 00:51:01,467
[sniffles]
Did Orsini mess with you?
Did he?

737
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,601
Well, what then?

738
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,367
Orsini just threw money
at him like he was some
$200 a week stiff.

739
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:16,701
Threw money
at who?

740
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,734
My father, and he
just stood there.

741
00:51:22,734 --> 00:51:25,167
What was your old
man doing at the 
barber shop?

742
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,234
He was
sh-shining shoes.

743
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:36,167
You didn't know
he worked there?

744
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,968
What a loser.

745
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:43,934
Hey. He's trying to
put food on the table,
no shame in that.

746
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Then how come he couldn't
look me in the eye?

747
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,434
Just 'cause he don't
like it don't mean
it's not honorable.

748
00:51:54,434 --> 00:51:57,100
[panting]

749
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:03,968
Go home. 

750
00:52:03,968 --> 00:52:05,901
He's family.

751
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:07,400
His luck will turn.

752
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:10,367
Things always
get better.

753
00:52:11,934 --> 00:52:13,367
Come on.

754
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:19,667
Sorry about the mess.
Don't worry about it.

755
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:35,534
What's the matter, doc?
Seen a ghost?

756
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:41,400
I'm afraid the
news isn't good,
Mr. McKay.

757
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,334
The latest MRI
shows it's spreading.

758
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,300
How long we talking?

759
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,501
Well, it's hard
to say.

760
00:52:53,968 --> 00:52:55,501
Have you put your
affairs in order?

761
00:52:57,501 --> 00:53:01,200
My affairs?
Oh sure, doc, sure.

762
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,567
Taxes are all paid up,
college funds set up
for all the kids,

763
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:06,234
Margaret, she's the
beneficiary in a huge

764
00:53:06,234 --> 00:53:08,601
insurance policy I've
been contributing to

765
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:10,534
since day one.
Everything's
squared away.

766
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:16,300
You given any
consideration to
quitting drinking?

767
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:21,367
Why? So when I'm putting my
affairs in order I can see
how fucked up they are?

768
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:30,033
Look, I'm sorry, you're
just doing your job.

769
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:32,133
I kinda knew what
the news was gonna be.

770
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:35,067
Half my family is underground
by the time they're 40.

771
00:53:37,868 --> 00:53:41,334
I'm trying to think
what I should do.

772
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:46,701
As a last hurrah. There's a
lot of stuff I haven't done.

773
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:49,968
Never caught a foul
ball at Fenway.

774
00:53:49,968 --> 00:53:52,968
Never swam in the ocean,
y'know. It's right there,
for Christ's sake.

775
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,400
I can't figure out what
to do. How the hell do
you wrap things up?

776
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:03,300
You haven't told anyone?

777
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:09,901
You need to share
this with your family.

778
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,767
Right.

779
00:54:20,234 --> 00:54:22,033
Same stuff as
last time.

780
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,834
Gimme a call.

781
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:27,100
Here.

782
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,501
[sports chatter]

783
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:43,033
[sports chatter]

784
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:59,634
Safe!

785
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:01,501
[Umpire]
Time out! Time out!
[groaning]

786
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:05,133
Okay, okay.

787
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:06,801
Come on. Can you
get up?

788
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:16,434
Smitty!
That was
intentional, blue!

789
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:19,701
[sports chatter]

790
00:55:19,701 --> 00:55:21,868
[Umpire]
All right, batter up!

791
00:55:21,868 --> 00:55:23,534
Hold up!

792
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:32,434
Play ball!

793
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:42,000
Ball.

794
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,167
[Man]
Hey! Watch your
pitcher over there!

795
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:04,100
[crowd noise]

796
00:56:32,334 --> 00:56:35,000
Told ya I'd get in
the game one day!

797
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:43,434
[chatter]

798
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:51,133
[dishes clatter]

799
00:56:59,868 --> 00:57:02,467
You look great, Katie.

800
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:05,334
Really, you do.

801
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:08,200
Do you have any idea
how long I've been
looking for you?

802
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,300
For about as long
as I've been hiding.

803
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:18,734
Can we talk?

804
00:57:24,434 --> 00:57:25,601
Manny, I
need a break.

805
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:26,534
Take five.

806
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:39,300
Have you and David
gotten married?

807
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,467
This? No.

808
00:57:41,467 --> 00:57:45,000
He would never stand
up to his parents
in a million years.

809
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,200
This is so respectable
people such as yourself

810
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,300
don't get the idea that
an unmarried pregnant girl
is serving their eggs.

811
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,601
Slinging eggs and
ham is not the answer.

812
00:57:55,234 --> 00:57:57,100
It just doesn't
make any sense.

813
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,901
Did it make sense to
marry dad when you were
pregnant with Terry?

814
00:58:00,901 --> 00:58:04,300
Thank you, but I'd
rather go it alone
and take my chances.

815
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,868
You think that's why
your father and I
got married?

816
00:58:07,868 --> 00:58:10,067
Don't sit there and tell me
that's not the reason, Ma.

817
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:11,167
I know that's the reason.

818
00:58:13,734 --> 00:58:15,701
Let me tell
you a story.

819
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:18,434
I was 22 when
I came to Boston.

820
00:58:18,434 --> 00:58:23,000
I was a beautiful young
woman then and I don't
mind saying so.

821
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,567
One night, I met
the most handsome man.

822
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:30,501
Wonderful dancer, beautiful
singing voice, kind.

823
00:58:30,501 --> 00:58:33,601
He was like no one I'd
ever known before. 

824
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:38,267
On our first date, we went
to this little Mom n' Pop
Italian place in the North End.

825
00:58:38,267 --> 00:58:43,534
Wherever we went,
someone knew him and
was glad to see him.

826
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:47,901
He was everything I
was I was looking for.

827
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:50,100
I gotta get
back inside.
I'm not finished.

828
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,100
Somewhere along
the way your father
stopped being my....

829
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,200
...he just
stopped being.

830
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:01,734
So I took a job

831
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:05,100
and raised the family.
Yes, I failed in parts.

832
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,567
But make no mistake,

833
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:10,968
I gave you
a good start.

834
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:14,200
Well-spoken and
courteous, you know
how to present yourself

835
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,767
and you didn't get
that from your father.

836
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:20,133
Everything your father
had to give your
brother Terry took.

837
00:59:20,133 --> 00:59:23,868
He'll pay a price for
it someday, but...

838
00:59:23,868 --> 00:59:27,734
before you decide
on raising this child,

839
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:31,400
be damned sure you've
got the nerve, not just
the love to raise it,

840
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,300
to go the distance
with that child,

841
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,501
even when nothing else
in your life works.

842
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:40,734
It takes more than
you know, Kathleen,

843
00:59:40,734 --> 00:59:43,534
and more than
you've got.

844
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:53,601
What about you?

845
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:56,567
You stayed in a dead
marriage for years, 
and for what, Ma?

846
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:59,234
So people would think we
were a normal family?

847
00:59:59,234 --> 01:00:00,701
We're not.
Terry was right.

848
01:00:00,701 --> 01:00:02,300
Terry was not right.

849
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,367
I'll raise this child
to be proud, not ashamed.

850
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,767
He won't be thrown into
some Catholic school
or some seminary

851
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:10,367
to wipe away the guilt
of his mother.

852
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,834
I won't give up on this baby
like you gave up on Terry.

853
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:14,734
You take that back!

854
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:19,801
Does this mean you
won't be coming over
for Christmas or Easter?

855
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:31,367
McKay!

856
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,300
Coach?

857
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,501
How's the arm feel?

858
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:39,000
Like it's been
run over.

859
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,200
Graves separated
his shoulder.

860
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,901
That means if we make it
past the semis I'm gonna
need you for the finals, too.

861
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:46,701
Can you be ready?

862
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:48,200
I'm ready now.

863
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,534
You sure?

864
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:51,634
Why wouldn't I be?

865
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:58,934
Genealogy...you know
what that is?

866
01:01:01,267 --> 01:01:02,834
Yeah.

867
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:05,767
It's about your
family tree.

868
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:08,534
Good or bad, you come from
the family you come from.

869
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,601
I knew your father,
growing up.

870
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:17,801
Hell, back then anybody
who knew anything about
baseball heard of him.

871
01:01:17,801 --> 01:01:21,200
He had a gift,

872
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,834
and he just
threw it away.

873
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:26,767
So let's just say I'm
keeping my eye on you.

874
01:01:38,934 --> 01:01:39,901
Hey.

875
01:01:41,234 --> 01:01:43,000
How did you do today?

876
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,868
You should've been there.
I pitched a good game.

877
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,234
So we win or what?

878
01:01:47,234 --> 01:01:49,133
Yeah, we won.

879
01:01:49,133 --> 01:01:51,634
Good for you.

880
01:01:51,634 --> 01:01:55,701
Maybe if you showed up to
a game once in a while and
actually took an interest

881
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:57,400
you wouldn't have to ask.

882
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,968
Hey, just because
I wasn't there doesn't
mean I don't care.

883
01:01:59,968 --> 01:02:02,400
I got tied up today,
that's all. How's
the elbow?

884
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,634
That's good.
Keep it iced.

885
01:02:05,634 --> 01:02:08,901
If you're going to pitch 
soon, lay off the breaking
stuff in practice.

886
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:11,701
Put some ointment on it.
Look dad, honestly,
can we just stop this?

887
01:02:11,701 --> 01:02:13,167
There's no point.

888
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:15,868
I'm trying to tell
you something--
something important here.

889
01:02:15,868 --> 01:02:18,400
What makes you
advice so good, huh?

890
01:02:20,133 --> 01:02:21,367
Look how far
it got you.

891
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:33,767
[train whistle blows]
[door slams]

892
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:43,667
That's right.
Reach out and grab
for your own demise.

893
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:46,834
Trust me, one more
beer is not going to
make a bit of difference.

894
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:51,133
Looks like you'll be
joining me, eh, Maggie?

895
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:54,334
Desmond, we haven't done
anything jointly in years,
this is no time to start.

896
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,033
Yeah, for good reason.

897
01:03:00,033 --> 01:03:03,367
Always gotta keep
knocking me
down, Maggie.

898
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:06,534
Hold me in contempt
every step of the way.

899
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:09,801
How did you become the
Queen of Pessimism?

900
01:03:09,801 --> 01:03:11,434
I married the king.

901
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:14,901
Now we've got a dynasty.

902
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:19,000
A whole lineage we've passed
on these champion traits to.

903
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,667
Don't start with me,
please. Not tonight.

904
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:24,567
Big man Desmond McKay.
Big Vietman war hero.

905
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:27,901
You fight all your battles
in your head.

906
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:30,000
Leave nothing left
for anyone else.

907
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,200
What do you bring to
this house? Name one thing.

908
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,400
You're stewed,
Maggie.

909
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,300
I deserve to
be stewed.

910
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,100
I'm the only one
who tries to keep
this family together.

911
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,334
Shut up! Shut your trap!

912
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,667
Stop it.

913
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:45,000
Scram, kid, it's between
your mother and me.

914
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,033
We had all the
promise in the world.
For Chrissake.

915
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,334
That's enough. 
Both of you.

916
01:03:49,334 --> 01:03:51,434
This doesn't concern you!
And now look at you.

917
01:03:51,434 --> 01:03:53,367
How in the world could
I have been so wrong?

918
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:55,534
Not in front of the boy,
Maggie. I'm warning you.

919
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:58,400
Or else what? As if
anything you've ever
done has ever mattered.

[dog barking]
Look what you made me do!

921

Get out.

924
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,267
[Terry]
I heard Mr. Baseball got his
team in the state finals!

925
01:04:40,968 --> 01:04:43,367
That curve ball is moving
pretty good on you.

926
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:47,901
Where did you get
the new wheels?

927
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:49,267
I earned 'em.

928
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:54,567
Come on.

929
01:04:57,167 --> 01:04:59,267
Would you
lighten up?

930
01:04:59,267 --> 01:05:00,434
Have some of this.

931
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:07,400
Did you hear about
good old Desmond?

932
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,601
Do I have to?

933
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:13,534
You're gonna want
to hear this.

934
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:16,033
He's a dead man.
He's got the big C.

935
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:23,467
That's bullshit.
He told you?

936
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:26,834
Everything I needed to know
was in his coat pocket.

937
01:05:26,834 --> 01:05:30,467
He had a pocket
full of these.

938
01:05:30,467 --> 01:05:33,801
I asked Anthony's
uncle, the pharmacist,
what they were.

939
01:05:33,801 --> 01:05:37,033
They give 'em to cancer
patients in the late
stages for the pain.

940
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:44,634
What's your problem, Terry?

941
01:05:44,634 --> 01:05:47,133
Don't you feel anything?

942
01:05:47,133 --> 01:05:49,868
Yeah.

943
01:05:51,067 --> 01:05:53,334
Relief.

944
01:05:53,334 --> 01:05:54,801
Relief.

945
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:58,467
Where you going?

946
01:05:59,934 --> 01:06:01,868
I'm through being
out here with you.

947
01:06:01,868 --> 01:06:04,067
Then let's go.

948
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:06,901
Take the new car
out for a spin.

949
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:08,100
You don't want me
driving that.

950
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:11,601
You pitched a good
game today.

951
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:14,834
You deserve to drive
a real car.

952
01:06:14,834 --> 01:06:17,300
Not like them old fart cars
you park at Marcellino's. 

953
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,133
Oh, I get it. You're
scared to get in
the car with me.

954
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:29,767
Can you believe I
spent $400 on this?

955
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:33,000
$400 on a Goddamned
rocket ship.

956
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,968
The guy I bought it from,
he cracked it up about
a month ago,

957
01:06:35,968 --> 01:06:39,100
the frame was all bent,
so I took it to this guy
I know, big meathead.

958
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,100
We did this barter deal.
He fixed it right up. 

959
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,467
Runs pretty good, don't it?
It's got a 350 V-8
engine under the hood.

960
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,667
Said he did some shit to
the engine and the exhaust.

961
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:49,300
That gearhead shit
goes in one ear and
right out the other.

We couldn't let this
one leave on his own.

you can charge him with?

let me call you back.

1036
01:11:17,234 --> 01:11:19,434
Someone just came in.

1037
01:11:19,434 --> 01:11:20,434
Can I help you?

1038
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:22,334
Yes, sir.

1039
01:11:22,334 --> 01:11:24,634
I've thought about this.

1040
01:11:24,634 --> 01:11:26,567
I want to sign up.

1041
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:27,467
Serve my country.

1042
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:29,367
Please, have a seat.

1043
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:39,167
I know you.
You're a local kid, right?

1044
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:40,400
McKay?

1045
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,267
Terry McKay.

1046
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,601

the Marine Corps motto?

1047
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:49,200
Yes, sir.

There's also the few,
the proud, the Marines.

1051
01:11:56,033 --> 01:11:57,100
Right.

1052
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,501
With an emphasis
on the few,

1053
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:02,901
which means we're
very selective.

1054
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,434
You're not even out
of high school yet

1055
01:12:04,434 --> 01:12:06,567
and you've already
got a criminal record.

1056
01:12:06,567 --> 01:12:09,501
Son, I don't think you're
Marine Corps material.

1057
01:12:10,734 --> 01:12:14,334
It's got to be the Marines.

1058
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,834
I'm sorry, son.
I can't help you.

1059

was marrying your mother.

I had no choice.

Of course
you didn't.

would make fun of your ears.

but he'll make it.

Fine.

by and help out in any way.

01:29:11,834 --> 01:29:15,300
I know you can
do it yourself,

1287
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,701
but it's not just
about you, Katie.

this before, Ma,

I didn't come
here for this, okay?

I'm asking you
to come home.

I can help take
care of the baby

I don't want to lose another.

I don't care how
it looks anymore.

I'll think
about it, okay?
