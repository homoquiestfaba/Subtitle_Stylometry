Weather, Here's Edwin Hadley.

22
00:00:56,987 --> 00:00:59,991
Goood Morning,
Los Angeles.

23
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:04,462
(Clears Throat)

24
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:07,898
There's Only 3 More Days
Until Christmas,

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,234
So Be Sure To Ask Santa
For Plenty Of Sunscreen,

26
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:14,171
Because We'll Be Having
Hot And Sunny Weather...

27
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:20,043
F-For The Next Several Days.

28
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:23,646
This Is Primarily Due
To A 3% Drop In
The Atmospheric Pressure

29
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,615
From The Jet Stream Winds In
The Northwestern Troposphere

30
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:30,120
Combined With A Steady 24 3/4%
Precipitation Factor, So...

31
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:34,525
If Some Of You
Young Meteorologists Have
An Isobar Chart At Home--

32
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:35,692
Boring.

33
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:38,795
(Beep Beep Beep)

34
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:42,732
Oh, No, It...That's Ok.
We Can Change The Menu Again,
Mrs. Dombrowski.

35
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:46,637
Mom! I Can't Find
My Smash Crash Load Game.

36
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,272
I Left It In The Computer.

37
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:52,575
Ok, Honey,
I'm Really Busy.

38
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,777
No, The Airport
Is Going To Be A Zoo,
So Get There Early.

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,646
Hey, Which Tie,
The Red Or Blue?

40
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,082
Uh, Red.
It's More Christmassy.

41
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:01,185
No, No, No, I Was
Talking To My Wife.

42
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:02,286
I Was Talking
To My Husband, Sorry.

43
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,988
(Telephone Rings)

44
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,090
Allie, Will You Get That?
Get The Phone.
Get The Phone!

45
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:08,259
Joey, Eat!
Enough With
The Syrup!

46
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,294
Thompsons.

47
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:12,863
Sam, Get Over Here
Right Away.

48
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:14,998
Walk!

49
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:14,998
Walk!

50
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:18,302
Blake Lynch Called Me,
And We're Invited To
His Christmas Party.

51
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:20,104
Sam: I'll Be Right Over.

52
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:32,248
Ok, Tell Me Everything.

53
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:35,753
Ok. Blake's Party's
At 4:00 On Christmas,

54
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:38,021
And I Told Him We'd Be There
A Couple Of Hours Early So
We Can Help Decorate.

55
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:39,188
That Way, We Can Spend
A Couple Of Hours With Him

56
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:40,623
Before Anyone Else
Gets There.

57
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:41,859
You're A Genius!

58
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:44,161
Thanks. I Know.

59
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:46,030
Samantha, Do You Realize
That We're About To
Leave Behind Our Lives

60
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:50,167
As Geeky Semioutsiders
And Evolve Into Cool,
Popular Insiders?

61
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,036
At Last!

62
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:56,573
Samantha, What Do You
Think Of When You Hear
BONESFORBOWSER.COM?

63
00:02:56,606 --> 00:03:00,610
Um...A Website That
Sells Dog Bones?

64
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,146
Exactly!

65
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:04,814
See, I Told You
It Was Catchy.

66
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:07,618
Dad, Do You Really Think
People Will Want To Buy
Dog Bones Over The Internet?

67
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:10,788
Oh, They Will, When They
Learn We Have Over 100
Varieties To Choose From.

68
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,324
Our Investors In
San Francisco Will Love It.

69
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:14,792
How Long Are You Going
To Be Gone This Time?

70
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:16,125
Just A Day.

71
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:17,927
I'll Be Back
Tomorrow Morning.

72
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:19,263
So, Tomorrow Night We Should
Definitely Get Together

73
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:21,331
And Discuss Our Schedules
For Christmas Day.

74
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:24,635
I Was, Uh, I Was Thinking
We'd Open Presents
From 8:00 To 10:00

75
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:28,639
And, Uh, Church At 11:00...

76
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:32,075
And Have Lunch At, Uh...
Oh, At 12:30. What Do You
Think Of That?

77
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,278
We'll Be Done By 2:00,
Right?

78
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:37,681
We've Gotta Be.
That's When My Basketball
Tournament Starts.

79
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:38,914
And Sam And I Have
A Party.

80
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,352
Don't Forget Uncle Don And
Aunt Gwen Are Coming Around 6:0

81
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,120
With The Grandparents.

82
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:44,721
Ok, Well, Just
Bring Your Schedules,
And I'll Make A Chart.

83
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:47,191
(Telephone Rings)

84
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:47,191
Mom Loves Making Charts.

85
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:49,393
(Telephone Rings)

86
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:49,393
I Heard That.

87
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,961
Creative Catering.

88
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:53,730
Well, Hello,
Mr. Fortuna.

89
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:57,200
Sure, We Can Add 4
People, No Problem.

90
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,403
See Ya, Mom.

91
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,403
Bye, Sweetie.

92
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,639
Uh, No, I Was
Talking To My
Daughter. Sorry.

93
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:03,407
Bye, Dad.
Have A Good Flight.

94
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,175
And If You Get Some Time
For Christmas Shopping,

95
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:08,778
I Really, Really Want
Pro-Line Deluxe
Rollerblades.

96
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,048
Well, Don't You Already
Have Rollerblades?

97
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,884
They're So Last-Year.
The New Ones Have
Carbon-Fiber Tips

98
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:17,187
With Wheels That
Are Road-Tested
Up To 80 Miles Per Hour.

99
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,123
Oh, Well, That's Reassuring.

100
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:23,427
I've Got To Get
The New Renegade
Starship Video Game.

101
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,195
Don't Forget.

102
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,165
Hey! Aren't You Kids
Forgetting What Christmas
Is All About?

103
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,968
No. It's About Presents.

104
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:34,003
Kidding!

105
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,138
Bye!

106
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:36,273
Walk!

107
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,841
(Telephone Rings)

108
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:44,915
Remember That A Paragraph
Concentrates On One Idea.

109
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:49,019
If You're Moving On
To Another Idea,
Conclude The Paragraph

110
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:50,821
And Start A New One.

111
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:54,158
Allie! Allie!

112
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,726
Oh, Um, Yes, Mrs. Lopez.

113
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,063
Allie, How's Your
Creative-Writing Paper
Coming Along?

114
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:01,231
Which One?

115
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,836
The One I Assigned
Last Week.

116
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,408
5 Pages,
Single-Spaced,
Due Tomorrow.

117
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,378
Oh...Yeah, That One.
It's, Uh, Genius.
Best Thing I've Ever Written.

118
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,081
Congratulations.
What's It About?

119
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:23,120
Oh, Uh...
It's About, Uh...

120
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,890
It's About...
It's About William Shakespeare.

121
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:33,763
Who...Wakes Up One Morning
And Finds Himself Living
Here, Today.

122
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:37,201
But The Problem Is No One
Believes Who He Really Is,

123
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:40,971
And He Has To Make Money,
So He Gets A Job Flipping
Burgers At A Fast-Food Place.

124
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:42,773
And During His Breaks,
He Writes Plays,

125
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:46,175
And Pretty Soon, He Comes
Up With A New One Called
<I> A Tale Of 2 Pickles Which--

126
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,411
(Bell Rings)

127
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,848
You Want Me To Finish?

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,917
Let's Keep It A Surprise.
I Look Forward
To Reading It.

129
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:58,188
I Have To Admit, That
Was A Pretty Good Story,

130
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:01,158
For Just Making It Up
On The Spot.

131
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,796
Yeah, But Now I've Got
To Write It, And I Forgot
Almost Everything I Said.

132
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:10,834
It's Not Fair.
Tomorrow's The Very Last Day
Before Christmas Vacation.

133
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,971
I Hate To Bring This Up,
But We Did Have A Week
To Do It.

134
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:15,806
That's Not The Point, Sam.

135
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:17,774
Ok. So, What Is
The Point?

136
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:20,510
The Point Is I Have
Got To Come Up With A Plan,

137
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:23,479
Some Way To Get Out Of
Doing This Paper
At All Costs.

138
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:25,815
Hey, Allie, Sam.

139
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,151
Hi, Blake!
Hi, Blake!

140
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:29,153
Can You Guys
Still Come To My
Christmas Party?

141
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:31,387
Uh, Yeah.

142
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:31,387
Yeah.

143
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,990
And Like I Said,
We'll Come Over Early
So We Can Help Decorate.

144
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:37,194
Cool. By The Way,
Allie, Your Story In
Class Was Awesome.

145
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:38,528
Oh, Thanks.

146
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:40,030
Well, Bye.

147
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:40,930
Bye!

148
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,068
(Screaming)

149
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:46,836
Uh-Oh, What Time Is It?

150
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,137
4:00.

151
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,474
Ahh. We've Got 72 Hours
Until Blake's Party,

152
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,342
And We Have To Get
To The Library,

153
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,478
And We Still Haven't
Even Gotten Joey's
Christmas Present Yet.

154
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:57,848
Forget It, Al.
We'll Never Make It.

155
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,216
Sure We Will.
Joey And His Friends
Take A Shortcut

156
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,185
Through The Woods
All The Time.
It'll Be Perfect.

157
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,519
Allie, Are You Sure
About This?

158
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,488
Positive.

159
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,858
We'll Be Home
Before You Know It.

160
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:13,396
Didn't We Pass That Same
Tree, Like, An Hour Ago?

161
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,867
We'll Be There
In 5 Minutes.
Trust Me.

162
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:19,870
Every Time You Say,
"Trust Me," I Either
End Up In Detention

163
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:21,838
Or On A Missing-Persons
List.

164
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:27,311
Whoa. Check It Out.

165
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:30,279
What?

166
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:30,279
That.

167
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:31,949
What A Weird
Little House.

168
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:34,116
I Know.

169
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,318
Have You Ever Seen
It Before?

170
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,387
No.

171
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,424
But I've Never Been
Lost In These Woods
Before, Either.

172
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:44,093
What Are You Doing?

173
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,562
I'm Gonna Find Out
Who Lives There.

174
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:46,897
Come On.

175
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,098
Allie, Whoever It Is,

176
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:52,435
There's A Reason
They Built Their House
Way Out Here.

177
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:53,937
Like Privacy.

178
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:06,617
There's Some Old Guy Inside.
He's Building Something.

179
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:09,252
That's Nice. Let's Go.

180
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:11,588
What'll You Give Me
If I Ding-Dong-Ditch?

181
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,423
Nothing.

182
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,423
Oh, Come On.

183
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:16,994
If I Ring The Doorbell,
Then You Do My English Paper,

184
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:20,329
But If I Get Scared
And Chicken Out,
I Do Yours.

185
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:23,466
Mine's Almost Finished.
Besides He Could
Catch Us.

186
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,302
No, He Won't.
Anyway, We Can Outrun
An Old Man.

187
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:32,910
Grrr...

188
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,082
Durn It All!

189
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:43,686
I Am So Out Of Here.

190
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,490
Cranberries.
It's Just A Machine.
It's Just Wires And Gears.

191
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:54,964
Wait A Second.

192
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,100
W-W-Wait....

193
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:02,572
Oh.

194
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,948
What Do You Think
It Is?

195
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,015
I Don't Know.
Put It Back.

196
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:13,215
Why? He Threw It Out.

197
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:15,017
But It's Still
Not Yours.

198
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,253
It's Garbage.
It's Anybody's. Come On!

199
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,995
Contraption...
Never Works Right...
More Trouble Than It's Worth.

200
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:36,506
Oh, No!

201
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:38,042
(Telephone Rings)

202
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:40,276
(Ring)

203
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,546
Creative Catering.
Ruben Speaking.

204
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,182
Excuse Me, Did You
Just Say Christmas Eve?

205
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,353
Ok, No Offense,
But You're Crazy.

206
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:54,056
Christmas Eve Has
Been Booked Solid For,
Like, 8 Months Now. Hello!

207
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:57,194
Hello?
He Hung Up On Me.

208
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,496
Well, That's Because
You Insulted Him.

209
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,299
I Did Not Insult Him.
I Told Him The Truth.

210
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:05,635
He's Crazy.
Christmas Eve Bookings.
Plan Ahead, People.

211
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,037
Mom, When Are We
Going To Get
Our Christmas Tree?

212
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,440
We're Going To Get The Tree
As Soon As Dad Comes Back
From San Francisco.

213
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:14,143
But All The Good Ones
Will Be Gone By Then.

214
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:16,045
Well, Then We're Just
Gonna Have To Stand

215
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,649
Uncle Don And Aunt Gwen
Up In A Corner And
Decorate Them, I Guess.

216
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:21,384
Are They Really Coming?

217
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:22,618
Joey...

218
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:29,159
But Uncle Don Always
Smokes Those Smelly Cigars,

219
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:33,396
And Aunt Gwen Never
Gets My Name Right.
She Always Calls Me Josie.

220
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,632
That's The Name
Of Her Own Poodle.

221
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:39,569
Hey, Everybody!

222
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:41,405
Sure Smells Good
In Here.

223
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,774
Yeah, We Never Get
To Eat The Good Stuff.
We Get Frozen Dinners.

224
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:46,375
Hah, You Do Not.

225
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:49,246
You Get Takeout.
How Was School?

226
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,082
Uh...Fine. We're
Going To Go Upstairs
And Do Some Homework.

227
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:53,016
Walk!

228
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:00,390
You Know That Tv Show
Where People Take Their
Junk To Some Expert,

229
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:02,725
And He Tells Them It's
Worth A Million Dollars?

230
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:05,161
Well, Maybe This Is
Worth Something.

231
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:07,064
Or Maybe It's
Just Junk.

232
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:10,100
Nah, It's Too New
To Be Junk.

233
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:11,734
It's Kind Of
Cool-Looking.

234
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,538
I Wonder What It Does.

235
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,808
Oh, What Did You Do?

236
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,508
I Just Touched
That Button.

237
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,146
Well, Try Another One.
Maybe It'll Turn It Off.

238
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:24,680
(Whistle Blows)

239
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:30,120
Wow!

240
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:30,120
Awesome!

241
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:39,830
Oh, This Is So Cool.

242
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:42,132
Hey, I Think
You Figured Out
How It Works.

243
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:44,434
Yeah.
Now Help Me Stop It.

244
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,103
(Thunder Rumbles)

245
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,104
Aah!

246
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:49,138
You'll Flood
The Place!

247
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:50,641
I'm Trying Not To!

248
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:53,610
Let's Try This.

249
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:58,247
(Thunder Rumbles)

250
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:07,189
That Is So Cool!

251
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:08,458
Wow! Let Me Try!

252
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:10,293
No, No, No, No, No.

253
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:11,560
(Thunder)

254
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:12,628
Aah!

255
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:12,628
Aah!

256
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:17,666
Oh! Whoa,
How Fierce Is That!

257
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:19,268
What's Fierce?!

258
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,372
Hey, Joey, Stay Out!

259
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,708
Why?

260
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,708
'Cause I Said So.

261
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:26,675
You're Not
The Boss Of Me!

262
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:29,246
Mom! Allie's
Bossing Me!

263
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,481
No, I'm Not!

264
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:34,751
Joey: Are You Wrapping
My Christmas Present?

265
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:37,319
What Did You Get Me?
Don't Tell Me!

266
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:41,157
Let Me Guess.
You Got Me A Football.
No, No, No.

267
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,295
I Know.
You Got Me A Poster
Of The Laker Girls!

268
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,699
Joey! Stay Out, Or I'm
Not Getting You Anything!

269
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,702
I Mean It!

270
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:56,205
You'd Better Hide It Good,
Or Else I'll Find It.
I Always Do.

271
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:04,580
My Turn!

272
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,386
Check Out These Symbols.

273
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,390
This Must Be Some Sort
Of Weather-Making Machine.

274
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:15,558
I Wonder What
This Swirly Line Means.

275
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,961
Whoa!

276
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,961
Whoa, Whoa!

277
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:20,829
Turn It! Turn It!
Turn It!

278
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:22,799
Here, Let's Try
This One.

279
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:25,635
Aah! Earthquake!

280
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:25,635
Aah! Earthquake!

281
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,403
Do You Feel That?

282
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:30,873
Oh, Don't Panic!
Get Under A Table
Or An Open Doorway!

283
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,877
Get A Transistor Radio!
Get Some Bottled Water!
Get Some Canned Goods!

284
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,945
Just Try And Stay
Calm, Ok?

285
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:40,650
It's Ok. It's Ok.
It's Over. It Was Just
A Truck Passing By.

286
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:45,455
Yeah, Right. That's What
They Said Just Before
The Big One In '94, Remember?

287
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:46,957
Ooh, Sorry!

288
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:49,892
It's Ok.
At Least We Know What
That Jiggly Line Means.

289
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:52,862
We'll Just Leave That One
Alone From Now On.

290
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:54,798
Let's Try The Snow One.

291
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:03,873
Wow!

292
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:09,312
Oh, This Is So Rad!

293
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:10,814
Why Would That Man
Throw It Out?

294
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,549
Maybe He Didn't Mean
To Throw It Out.

295
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:15,285
Yes, He Did.
We Saw Him.

296
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:18,855
Well, We Should Bring It
Back. I Mean, This Thing
Could Flood A City

297
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:20,656
Or Cause A Blizzard
Or...

298
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:26,863
Do I Even Want To Know
What's Going Through
Your Mind?

299
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:30,934
Sam, How Would You Like
To Start Christmas Vacation
A Day Early?

300
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:32,035
How?

301
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:33,336
With A Snow Day.

302
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:34,704
A What?

303
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:37,473
A Snow Day. You Know,
My Cousin Stan Lives In Boston,

304
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:39,976
And He Said
Every Once In A While,
They Get So Much Snow

305
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,644
That They Have To Close
Down The Schools

306
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:43,546
'Cause They Can't Clear
The Roads Fast Enough.

307
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:46,915
We Do It With This.
We'll Just Put It Outside,
Crank Up The Volume,

308
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:49,019
And Make It Snow Real Hard.

309
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:52,521
Are You Nuts? Do You
Know How Much Trouble
We Could Get In?

310
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:56,726
Sam...How Happy Would
Everybody Be If We Actually
Had A White Christmas In L.A.

311
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:58,861
For Like The First Time Ever?

312
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:01,930
We'd Be Doing
This Incredible Service
For Our Community.

313
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:02,964
Well...

314
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:05,567
And Guess What Else?
If Tomorrow Is A Snow Day,

315
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:09,539
Then We Have
2 Extra Weeks To Do That Dumb
Creative-Writing Assignment.

316
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:11,707
And Even More Important,

317
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:15,578
We Have A Whole Extra Day
To Plan What We're Going
To Wear For Blake's Party.

318
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:17,514
Am I Brilliant Or What?

319
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,648
In A Mad Scientist
Sort Of Way.

320
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:20,849
Mrs Thompson: Allie!

321
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:22,853
Oh, Hurry, Hurry, Hurry!

322
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,521
I Need Your Help, Honey.

323
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:26,689
Yeah, Mom.

324
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,526
What Have You Guys
Been Doing In Here?

325
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,061
Uh...

326
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,061
The Floor's Soaked!

327
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:33,963
Oh, Sorry, Mom.
We'll Clean It Up.

328
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:37,800
Allie I Have 5
Parties In 2 Days.
I Need Some Help.

329
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,736
Ok.

330
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:44,007
Now! Get Some Towels,
Mop Up The Water So It
Doesn't Ruin The Floor.

331
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:03,660
And How Many Times Have
I Told You To Put Your
Dirty Clothes In The Hamper?

332
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:05,696
I'll Do It.
I'll Do It, Mom.
Don't. Don't. I Got It.

333
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,598
Ugh!

334
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:17,139
W-W-What Are You Doing?

335
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:18,040
Shh!

336
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,519
It Isn't Working.

337
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:34,090
Mmm, Maybe It Just
Takes Some Time.

338
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:36,126
Well, It Was
A Great Idea Anyway.

339
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,495
Better Get Started
On That Paper.

340
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:51,840
P.A.: All Dollies
To Loading Dock B.

341

342
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:56,979
Shirley, Has Santa Called In
From The Summer Cabin Yet?

343
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:59,415
Shirley: No, Mrs. Claus.

344
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:02,786
All Right. Well, Then,
Send In The Elves.

345
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:04,120
Shirley: Right Away.

346
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:09,992
Hey, Mrs. Claus!

347
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:12,094
Get Ready
To Be Impressed!

348
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:14,731
Say Good-Bye
To The Old North Pole

349
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,199
And Hello
To The New.

350
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:19,802
Santa's 21ST-Century
Toy Factory And Warehouse.

351
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:23,472
Every Square Inch
Of The 10-Mile Radius
Completely Automated.

352
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:26,209
Absolutely Nothing
Is Touched By Elfin Hands.

353
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,911
And Since Elves Are
Going To Be Obsolete,

354
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,045
We're Going To
Retrain Them To Be...

355
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,682
Telemarketers!

356
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,185
Taking Phone, Catalogue,
And Internet Orders

357
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:38,188
24 Hours A Day,
365 Days A Year.

358
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,756
I Know What You're
Thinking, Mrs. C.

359
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,190
"Crumpet,
What About Tradition?

360
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,092
"Won't The Public
Be Disappointed

361
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:45,194
With The Fact
That Santa Has Entered
The Digital Age?"

362
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,563
"No," We Say.

363
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:48,163
Phooey!

364
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:49,766
Because Half
The Stuff They Print
About Us Anyway,

365
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:50,933
Is Totally Wrong.

366
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:53,002
Heck, People Still
Think We're 3 Feet Tall

367
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:54,536
And Have Squeaky
Little Voices.

368
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,672
Ha Ha Ha.

369
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:56,906
So, What Do You Think,
Mrs. C?

370
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,842
Hey, Don't Beat
Around The Bush, Mrs. C.

371
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:00,075
All Right.

372
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:06,650
I Think It's The Worst
Idea I've Ever Heard.

373
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:08,951
Both: Ohh.

374
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:13,523
Well, Is That
A "No" Or A "Maybe"?

375
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:14,123
(Telephone Rings)

376
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,726
Excuse Me.

377
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:18,694
Hello?

378
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:18,694
(Ring)

379
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:19,930
Hello?

380
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:19,930
(Ring)

381
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:21,797
Hello!

382
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,199
Mama, The Weather
Machine Is Missing!

383
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:26,869
Oh! The Weather
Machine Is Missing?

384
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:28,004
Huh?

385
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:28,004
Santa: It's Gone.

386
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,105
Santa: It's Vanished.
It's Disappeared!

387
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:32,141
Oh, I Never Should've
Tossed It Out.

388
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:33,809
Mrs. Claus:
You Tossed It Out?

389
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:35,512
It Wasn't Working Properly,

390
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:36,946
And So I Was Frustrated,

391
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,747
And I...
I Threw It In The Trash.

392
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,749
And When I Went
To Get It Back,

393
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,252
It Wasn't There Anymore.

394
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:43,952
All Right, Darling.

395
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:45,988
It Must've Been
Just Misplaced.

396
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:47,857
Did You Search
The Cabin?

397
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,292
Yes.

398
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,292
Mrs. Claus:
Retraced Your Steps?

399
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:50,826
Yes!

400
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,228
Tell Him
To Check His Pockets.

401
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,263
Did You Check
Your Pockets, Dear?

402
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,901
It Can't Fit In My Pockets!

403
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:00,969
Oh.

404
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:02,105
Santa: What If It Gets
Into The Wrong Hands?

405
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:03,606
There's No Telling
What Could Happen.

406
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:06,042
The Consequences
Could Be Disastrous!

407
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:08,111
Mrs. Claus:
All Right, Darling.
Calm Down.

408
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,579
There's No Time To Calm Down.

409
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:11,948
I Have To Find That Machine!

410
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,782
You Will.
I'll Send Help.

411
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:15,651
Fiona And Twinkle
Will Be There

412
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:17,152
Before You Can
Name The Reindeer.

413
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:19,756
Santa: Christmas
Is 3 Days Away.

414
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:22,257
You Can't Spare
My Best Elves Now.

415
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,594
Mrs. Claus: Don't Worry.
We'll Manage.

416
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:25,294

420
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,169
Mmm.

421
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,976
Bye, Dear.

422
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:42,111
Santa: Bye.

423
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,947
Uh, We'll Go.

424
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,947
Yeah, We'll Go!

425
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:45,914
We Can Help Santa
Better Than Anyone.

426
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:48,084
Yeah, 'Cause, Uh,
When You Need To Find
A Lost Weather Machine,

427
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:49,117

Oh Ho Ho!

432
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,160
It's A Light Load,

433
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,261
So You Shouldn't Need
More Than 2 Reindeer.

434
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:01,863
Let Me See.
Why Don't You Take
Prancer And Vixen.

Ok.

Except...

Except There's
One Small Problem.

What?

439
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:09,605
Tell Her.

440
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:12,241
Well, See,
I'm Kind Of Afraid
Of Reindeer.

441
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:14,611
I Got Bit Once
By Dasher.

442
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,112
Well, You Shouldn't
Have Poked Him.

443
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:17,279
I Didn't Poke Him.
I Petted Him.

444
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:18,814
No, You Poked Him
Like This.

445
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:20,048
Hey!

446
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:20,048

Are We Almost There?

525
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:55,904
Yeah, In About 3 Hours.

526
00:22:55,938 --> 00:22:59,175
Ugh. Can We
Make A Pit Stop?

527
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,142
Why?

528
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,411
You Know Why.

529
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:04,913
Hmm. Didn't I
Tell You To Go
To The Bathroom

530
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,215
Before We Left?

531
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:08,016
Well, I Did,
But I Got To Go Again!

532
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,117
Well, We're
Not Stopping.

533
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:11,086
Cross Your Legs
Or Something.

534
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,927
Whew!

535
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,027
Ugh!

536
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:25,168
Are We Supposed
To Be Heading East?

537
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:27,536
What?

538
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,040
The Compass.
It's Pointing East.

539
00:23:31,073 --> 00:23:33,575
You Nitwit!
That's Not A Compass.

540
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:34,510
That's A Fuel Gauge.

541
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:35,978
Oh!

542
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,279
(Engine Dies)

543
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:42,517
Sparky, Didn't I
Tell You To Put Gas
In The Gas Tank?

544
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,920
Yeah!

545
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:45,120
Did You?

546
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:47,457
Oh.
I Think I Forgot.

547
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:51,993
Well, We're Taking
A Pit Stop Now.

548
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:53,062
Ok, Everybody,
Here We Go!

549
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:56,399
In 5, 4, 3, 2...

550
00:23:56,431 --> 00:23:57,967
You're On!

551
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:04,406
Good Evening.
This Is Edwin Hadley,

552
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:09,411
Here With Your Channel 3
Evening Action Weather.

553
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:12,381
The Weather Continues
As Predicted. Sunny Days,

554
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:16,251
Continuing...Into Only
Slightly Cooler Evenings.

555
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:19,922
We Interrupt This Program
For A Special Weather
Bulletin. Ah...

556
00:24:21,257 --> 00:24:23,325
Ah...

557
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,295
I'm--I'm Sorry.
There Seems To Be
Some Kind Of Mistake.

558
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:29,297
You See, I've Just Been
Handed A Report That Says
There's...

559
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:32,200
Well, There's Snow Outside.

560
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:34,203
As We All Know,
That's Impossible,

561
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:36,238
So I'll Simply
Disregard This.

562
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:39,075
And Now, Back To
Our Real Report.
As I Said,

563
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:41,943
Sunny Days Ahead.
For The Next 5 Days,
We--

564
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:44,546
What Is It Now?
I Told You That This
Is Impossible!

565
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,882
Can You Not See
That I'm Up Here?

566
00:24:45,914 --> 00:24:47,249
(Crumples Paper)

567
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:48,484
Ladies And Gentlemen,

568
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:51,187
I Can Assure You

569
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:53,421
That There Is Not Now,
Nor Has There Ever Been,

570
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:57,393
At This Elevation And
Temperature, Even The Most
Remote Possibility Of--

571
00:24:57,426 --> 00:24:58,494
Ohh.

572
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:08,503
Snow.

573
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:09,605
Ahem.

574
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,911
It Does Seem That
The Los Angeles Area
Is Experiencing

575
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:18,446
An Unexpected Cold Front...

576
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:22,384
Combined With Increased
Levels Of Precipitation,
Which In Turn,

577
00:25:22,418 --> 00:25:23,953
Has Resulted...

578
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:25,988
In Snow.

579
00:25:28,023 --> 00:25:29,259
Oh, My.

580
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:35,430
Come On.

581
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:38,034
Come On,
Keep Going.
Keep Going.

582
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:44,974
Snow, Indeed.

583
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:56,018
The Storm
Started Somewhere.

584
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:00,055
Before This Night
Is Through,

585
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,124
I'm Gonna Figure Out Where.

586
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:05,527
Edwin!

587
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:05,527
Don't Bother Me Now.

588
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:06,963
I'm In The Middle
Of An Important,

589
00:26:06,996 --> 00:26:08,965
Groundbreaking
Research Project.

590
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:12,234
Ok. Sure. No Problem.

591
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:17,006
But Mr. Martino
Wants To See You.
Right Away.

592
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:19,342
Though I Suppose
It's Never Too Late
To Take A Break.

593
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,920
What Do You Want
For Christmas,
Edwin?

594
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:39,228
Well, Sir, I Hadn't
Really Given It Much Thought.

595
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,062
But, Uh, As Long As
You Brought It Up,

596
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:44,032
I Was Hoping To Be Able
To Talk To You
About The Possibility

597
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:45,601
Of A Pay Raise--
A Small One, Of Course.

598
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:47,135
Hmm. You Know What I Want?

599
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:48,536
I Want To Wake Up
One Morning,

600
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,306
Turn On The Tv,

601
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,709
And See You With A Nice,
Bright Smile On Your Face

602
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:57,579
Instead Of That
Lemon-Sucking Grin
You Got On Right Now.

603
00:26:57,613 --> 00:26:59,280
Well, Uh,
Sir, I Wasn't Aware--

604
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:00,515
I Want To See You
Wearing Something Else

605
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:03,318
Instead Of That Idiotic
Scrap Of Cloth You Call
A Bow Tie.

606
00:27:03,352 --> 00:27:05,254
This Is From
The Signature Collection--

607
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:06,055
And You Want To
Know What I Want
Most Of All?

608
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:07,389
I Want You To Once,

609
00:27:07,422 --> 00:27:09,491
Just Once
In My Lifetime,

610
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:11,427
To Keep Me Awake
When I Watch You.

611
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:13,429
What Are You Insinuating?

612
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:14,563
Oh!

613
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:17,032
Do I Have To Spell It
Out For You? Ok.

614
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:18,767
You Are Dull,

615
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:20,736
Boring,
Tedious,

616
00:27:20,768 --> 00:27:24,073
Tiresome,
A Yawnfest,
A Snooze-A-Thon.

617
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:26,275
I'd Rather Watch Paint
Dry Then To Watch You.

618
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:27,675
And Then
To Top It All Off...

619
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:32,247
Hello! There's
A Snowstorm Outside!
In Los Angeles!

620
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,281
And You Didn't
Even See It Coming!

621
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:35,183
Well, No One Did, Sir.
It Was Quite Unexpected.

622
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:38,254
Oh. Did
The Weather Fairy Just
Wave Her Magic Wand,

623
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:39,688
And Poof! It Snowed?

624
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,189
Yes, Sir.
Well, It's...

625
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:42,357
I Mean...

626
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:44,427
I Mean, No, Sir.

627
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:46,161
But The Pattern
Of This Storm

628
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:48,230
Is Unlike
Any Other In History.

629
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:50,599
Instead Of Moving
Across Its Target,

630
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:53,302
It Seems To Have
Just Appeared And
Spread Out In All Directions.

631
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:56,072
So, In Measuring
The Amount Of Snowfall,

632
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:58,574
I'm Going To Be Able
To Determine From Where
It's Been The Longest,

633
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:00,575
Thus Where It Began.

634
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:00,575
Ok, Wait, Wait.

635
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:02,078
Imagine
I'm The Audience.

636
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,113
And, Hey,
Guess What?
I'm Asleep!

637
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:06,147
Well, Mr. Martino,
As To--

638
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,682
Oh, Come On, Hadley!
Let's Face It.
You Are A Joke,

639
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:11,786
An Embarrassment,
The Worst Weatherman
In The World!

640
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,789
You Know, The Only
Reason I Kept You
Around This Long

641
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:18,127
Is Because I'm Married
To Your Sister.

642
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,363
But Even She Says
I Should Let You Go.

643
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:23,298
Belinda Said That?

644
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:24,699
Uh-Huh.

645
00:28:24,732 --> 00:28:26,835
But Since It's
The Holidays

646
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:29,438
And I'm Feeling
Very Charitable,

647
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,474
I'm Going To Give
You One More Chance.

648
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:34,209
Now You Are Gonna
Go Out There,

649
00:28:34,243 --> 00:28:36,345
And Dig Up
Some Real News
About This Storm.

650
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:38,247
Like Are
The Backstreet Boys

651
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,447
Going To Cancel
Their Concert
In The Park?

652
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,550
Or How's Brad Pitt
Getting To The Set
Of His New Movie?

653
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:43,552
That's What I Want
To Know!

654
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,888
Yes, Sir!

655
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,888
Good. Oh, Oh, Oh!

656
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,657
And Be Sure To Get A Lot
Of Hard-Luck Stories
About Cars Not Starting

657
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:50,325
And People
Slipping On Ice--

658
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,328
You Know, Christmas
Being Ruined.

659
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:53,329
It'll Help Boost
Our Ratings.

660
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:54,596
Yes, Sir!

661
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:54,596
Good.

662
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,698
Oh, And, Hadley.

663
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,766
About
That Pay Raise?

664
00:28:57,798 --> 00:28:59,134
Yes, Sir.

665
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,636
Forget It!

666
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,636
Yes, Sir.

667
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,241
Please Understand
That This Snowfall

668
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:10,278
Was Completely Unexpected,
A Meteorological Fluke,

669
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:14,917
If You Will.
It--It--It Did Not Show Up
On, Uh, On Our Radar.

670
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:17,920
Ok, Ok! What About
The Schools?

671
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,189
Rest Assured That As Of
This Moment, I'm Doing
Everything In My Power

672
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:24,359
To Trace Its Origin.

673
00:29:24,392 --> 00:29:26,895
Now, If I Were To Hasten
A Hypothetical Guess,

674
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:31,133
I Would Be Looking
For A Mass Of Polar Air
From The North,

675
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:35,237
Quite Possibly, Alaska.

676
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:39,674
Now Imagine As The Air Wends
Its Way Down From Alaska
And Through Canada,

677
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:43,245
The Smell Of Sockeye Salmon
Wending Through Bakersfield

678
00:29:43,277 --> 00:29:45,647
And Coming Down
Through Arizona Into
The San Fernando Valley,

679
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,316
Where It Would Meet Up
With A Subtropical Air Front,

680
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,952
Carrying With It
The Smells Of Mexico

681
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:52,420
And The Sounds
Of The Mariachi Band.

682
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:54,522
We Would Get
A Sort Of Mixture

683
00:29:54,555 --> 00:29:58,960
And An Interplay Between
These 2 Different Isobar,
Isothermic Fronts,

684
00:29:58,994 --> 00:30:01,830
Creating A Sort Of
Meteorological Lambada.

685
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,298
If You Will--

686
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,298
Ok.

687
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:05,200
That's Right, Folks.
All This Glorious Snow

688
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:08,938
Isn't A Special Effect
Dreamed Up By Tinseltown,
But The Real Thing.

689
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,272
And Good News
For All You Kids.

690
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:13,675
Put Down Your Books
And Grab Your Snowboards,

691
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:16,245
Because The Following
Schools Are Closed.

692
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:18,514

Sorry We're Late.

720
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:19,501
I Bet You're Glad
To See Us.

721
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:21,704
Where's Twinkle And Fiona?

722
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:23,439
Oh, They Were Gonna Come,

723
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:25,740
But A Crisis Like This
Required The Best.

00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:27,343
So We Volunteered!

725
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:29,711

In Christmas
Industry.

730
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:37,753
That Is, Since
Your Patented
Chimney Expander.

731
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:40,589
Christmas Is Not
An Industry, Crumpet.
It's A Holiday.

732
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:42,824
We've Been Meaning To
Talk To You About That.
Ok, Mr. C,

733
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:44,659
Connect With Me. Ok,
Stay Right There.

734
00:32:44,692 --> 00:32:45,794
Think About This.

This Is The Kicker.

No More Nasty Reindeer
To Contend With.

741
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:57,672
I--I Can't Think
About This Right Now.

742
00:32:57,707 --> 00:33:00,641
We've Got To Find
That Machine Before
The Snow Gets Any Worse.

743
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,478
You Got It, Chief.

744
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,080
Although, Uh, You Know,
Sparky And I Have
A Few New Gift Ideas

745
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:07,615
We Want To Run By You.

Ok, Ok, Ok!

748
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:11,853
Uh, Where Would I Be
If I Was A Weather Machine?

749
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,555
Did You Check
The Cabin?

750
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:15,924
Yes.

751
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:16,891
Did You
Retrace Your Steps?

752
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:18,393
Yes!

753
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:20,562
Did You Check Your Pockets?

754
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:22,131
I've Been
Through This Before!

755
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:23,732
I've Checked
Every Square Inch Of--

756
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,067
What's This?

757
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:27,736
I Know This One!

758
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:29,670
Uh, It's
A Trash Can Lid.

759
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:30,872
Underneath!

760
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:36,911
Both: A Shoeprint.

761
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:40,015
Santa: This Is Terrible.
It's My Worst Fear Come True.

762
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:43,017
The Weather Machine
Has Been Stolen.

763
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:44,954
The 14 Inches...

764
00:33:46,787 --> 00:33:48,990
Of Snow...

765
00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:51,693
That Has Fallen
Since Last Night

766
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:54,729
Easily Eclipses
The Previous Record
For Los Angeles County

767
00:33:54,763 --> 00:33:57,766
Of 0.3 Inches

768
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:02,904
On January 19, 1949.

769
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:07,475
Nothing Suspicious
About That Snowfall,
On That Day.

770
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:11,146
Yes. Mrs.Dombrowski,
I Promise Even
With The Snow,

771
00:34:11,178 --> 00:34:13,214
We Will Have
Everything
For Your Party.

772
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:16,685
In Fact,
It's Almost Ready
As We Speak.

773
00:34:16,718 --> 00:34:18,453
Yes.
Ok, You Know What?

774
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:20,021
I Have To Go,
Though. My Other
Line Is Ringing.

775
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:22,690
Ok, I'll See You
Soon. Bye-Bye.

776
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,526

777
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:26,562
Mr. Thompson: Hello, Darling.
How's It Going?

778
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:28,797
Oh, Hi, Honey.
I Am So Crazed.

779
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,730
Are You On
Your Way Home?

780
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:30,998
Not Quite.

781
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:33,602
You Know That
Snowstorm Of Yours...

782
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,837
Well, It Started Here
About An Hour Ago.

783
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,706
That's Why I Called.
My Flight's Delayed.

784
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,875
How Long?

785
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:40,942
Oh, They Don't Know Yet,

786
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:43,678
But At Least
A Couple Of Hours.

787
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:45,247
Oh, Honey,
I Am So Sorry.

788
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:47,216
Yeah. Me, Too.

789
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:49,984
Oh, Well.
Give Me A Chance To Eat
Some Delicious Airport Food.

790
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:51,553
How Are The Kids?

791
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:52,721
Well,
They're Great

792
00:34:52,754 --> 00:34:53,622
'Cause The Schools
Are Closed.

793
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:55,022
Oh. Lucky Them.

794
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:56,692
Lucky You.

795
00:34:56,725 --> 00:34:58,627
Well, You Know What?
Actually, It's Been Fun.

796
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,263
I Mean,
You Should See Allie.
She Is Out Of Her Mind.

797
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:03,564
It's Almost Like
She Personally
Ordered Up This

798
00:35:03,598 --> 00:35:04,833
From The Weather
Service Herself.

799
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:07,268
Well, What Do
You Think?

800
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:10,004
(Squawking)
Definitely Needs
More Sugar.

801
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:12,774
You're Right!

802
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:13,841
Bawk!
Too Much!

803
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,844
Shh, Quiet.
She's On The Phone.

804
00:35:15,877 --> 00:35:17,746
Don't Forget
To Tell Steve About

805
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:18,914
The Rollerblades.

806
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:20,748
Oh, Honey,
Before I Forget.

807
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:22,250
I Am Having
The Hardest Time

808
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:23,785
Finding
Those Rollerblades
For Allie.

809
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,120
Nobody Has Her Size.

810
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:26,921
What Size Is She?

811
00:35:26,955 --> 00:35:28,590
Crumpet:
Length, 7 Inches.

812
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:29,658

817
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:36,230
You Know, This Program

Fantastic!

820
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,669
In Just A Couple
Of Seconds,

00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:42,303
It's Gonna Tell Us
We're Looking For--

822
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:44,974
An Eagle's Flight
Running Shoe, Size 7.

823
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:52,180
Ok.

824
00:35:52,212 --> 00:35:54,248
How Did You
Know That?

825
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:57,752
I Delivered 40,000
Of Them Last Year,

826
00:35:57,785 --> 00:36:02,857
And There Are 1,937 Girls
In Los Angeles
With Size-7 Feet.

827
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,059
Hmm.
That's A Lot.

828
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:06,661
Yeah. That's A Lot.

829
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:06,661
Yeah.

830
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:09,030
I Suggest We Dispense

00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:02,877
To Be Tiny And Little,

870
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,745
With High, Squeaky Voices.

871
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,748
Don't Believe
Everything
You Hear, Ok?

872
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:08,949
I Believe You.

873
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,685
Have A Merry Christmas.

874
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,421
And Remember...

875
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:14,022
Be Good.

876
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:15,390
Woman: Mary Jo.

877
00:38:17,926 --> 00:38:19,428
Who Were You
Talking To?

878
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,096
Santa--
Santa Claus.

879
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,467
What Did I Tell You
About Fibbing?

880
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,035
But, Mom,
He Was Just Here!

881
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:28,169
Go To Your Room.

882
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:29,271
Mom!

883
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:30,404
Ahh. Now.

884
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,039
Argh!

885
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:35,911
♪ Agent Maaaaaan ♪

886
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:38,412
Check It Out.

887
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,315
I've Got
The Perfect Outfit
For Blake's Party.

888
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:42,784
My New Black Skirt
And My New
Red Blouse.

889
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:44,319
How Do You Like 'Em?

890
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:47,254
Great. Especially
Since I Loaned Them
To You Last Week.

891
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:49,157
Oh, Yeah.

892
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,793
Well, Maybe You Can
Give Them To Me
As An Early Christmas Present.

893
00:38:51,826 --> 00:38:53,195
I Might As Well.

894
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:54,495
Every Time I Give
You Something,

895
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:56,064
I Never
Get It Back Anyway.

896
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:58,432
Hey, I Gave You Back
Your <I> Lion King Video.

897
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:01,803
Yeah, And You
Borrowed It When
I Was 6 Years Old.

898
00:39:01,835 --> 00:39:03,104
Oh, Yeah.

899
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:05,239
(Knocking At Door)

900
00:39:05,272 --> 00:39:07,007
Samantha,
Your Mom's Here.

901
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,144
Thanks, Mrs. Thompson.

902
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:12,047
Mrs. Thompson:
Here They Are.

903
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:12,047
Oh, Great.

904
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,815
Hi, Mom.

905
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,815
Hi, Sweetie.

906
00:39:13,848 --> 00:39:15,449
Hold On A Second.

907
00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:17,084
(Telephone Rings)

908
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:18,018
Tell Your Mom
Thanks For--

909
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:19,353
Hello.

910
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:20,855
Hey, Honey.

911
00:39:20,888 --> 00:39:24,792
I, Uh, I Got Some Bad News.

912
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:26,161
The Roads Are A Mess.

913
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:27,996
Here's The One Day
I Can Finally Use

914
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:29,397
My 4-Wheel Drive,
And I Don't Know

915
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,899
How It Works.

916
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:32,834
Mrs. Thompson: Ok, Bye-Bye.

917
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:34,736
(Telephone Bleeps Off)

918
00:39:35,435 --> 00:39:36,771
Uh, Allie,

919
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:38,406
Honey, Joey.

920
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:40,174
That Was Your Dad,

921
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:42,143
And He Is Stuck
In San Francisco.

922
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:44,779
What?

923
00:39:44,812 --> 00:39:46,413
Mrs. Thompson:
All The Flights
Are Cancelled.

924
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:49,049
Joey: Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.
What If He Can't Get Out?

925
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:50,851
He Won't Be Here
For Christmas.

926
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:52,319
He Will.
Trust Me.

927
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:53,488
How Do You Know?

928
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:56,490
I Just Know.

929
00:39:56,524 --> 00:40:00,495
I, Uh, Think
I Left My Hat
Up In Your Room.

930
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:02,531
Oh, Yeah.
We'll Be Right Back.

931
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,439
Allie: It's Off.

932
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:13,274
Then Why Is It
Still Snowing?

933
00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:15,544
Because It Takes
A While, Remember?

934
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:17,011
That Machine's Powerful.

935
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:18,345
Ya Think?!

936
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:20,081
Hey, I Didn't Know
The Signal Would Reach

937
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:21,183
All The Way
To San Francisco.

938
00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:22,584
Well Guess What.
It Does.

939
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:24,585
That's Why
I Turned It Off, Ok?

940
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:26,254
Think I Don't
Want My Father
Home For Christmas?

941
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:29,491
I Mean, How Awful
Would That Be?

942
00:40:29,524 --> 00:40:31,226
Can You Imagine
How Much We'd
All Miss Him?

943
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:32,995
Yeah,
I Think I Can.

944
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:37,232
Oh, Sam, I'm Sorry.

945
00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:38,299
It's Ok.

946
00:40:40,868 --> 00:40:42,403
Do You Want
To Talk About It?

947
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:44,506
It's Ok If You Don't,
But--

948
00:40:44,538 --> 00:40:48,109
Look, My Dad Died
When I Was Only 3,

949
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,944
And I Barely
Remember Him.

950
00:40:49,977 --> 00:40:51,378
So, How Can
You Miss Someone

951
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:53,480
You Don't Even
Remember? Right?

952
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:55,049
But Still,
I Shouldn't--

953
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:57,117
It's Just Weird
Around Christmas.

954
00:40:57,151 --> 00:41:01,122
Mom Says This Was
His Favorite Time
Of The Year.

955
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:02,990
He'd Start Playing
Christmas Music

956
00:41:03,024 --> 00:41:04,391
The Day After
Thanksgiving.

957
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:06,361
She Says
He Would Have

958
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:07,596
Kept Our Christmas
Decorations

959
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:09,431
Up All Year
If She Would
Have Let Him.

960
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:12,399
Parents Are So Corny.

961
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:14,236
My Mom Has
This Charm Bracelet,

962
00:41:14,268 --> 00:41:16,872
That My Dad Gave Her
Their Very First
Christmas Together.

963
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:19,274
And Every Year,
He Gives Her
A New Charm For It.

964
00:41:19,306 --> 00:41:21,141
And She Always Knows
She's Gonna Get It,

965
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:24,979
But She Still Acts
All Surprised And Gets
All Weepy And Emotional.

966
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,553
(Sighs)
I Have Got
To Fix This, Sam.

967
00:41:31,585 --> 00:41:34,288
I Have To Do Something.

968
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:36,624
If My Family Misses
Christmas Because Of Me--

969
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:38,960
Sam's Mother:
Samantha, Have You
Found Your Hat?

970
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:40,429
Yeah, Mom.
Coming.

971
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:44,065
Look.
It Stopped.

972
00:41:48,669 --> 00:41:50,204
Thank Goodness.

973
00:41:57,611 --> 00:42:01,415
Hadley: Here
In The Los Angeles Area,
A Mysterious Snowstorm

974
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:05,052
Finally Stopped
At Approximately
6 P.M. This Evening.

975
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:08,456
But That's
Small Consolation

976
00:42:10,357 --> 00:42:13,961
To Jennifer Love Hewitt,
Who Slipped On A Patch Of Ice

977
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:16,464
In Burbank.

978
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:20,134
Aw...

979
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:22,170
Oh, Too Bad.

980
00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:28,410
Ahem. Well, You Ever
Slip On A Patch Of Ice?

981
00:42:28,442 --> 00:42:32,580
Ok. That's Everybody's
Schedule For Christmas Eve.

982
00:42:32,613 --> 00:42:36,984
Now, If I Can Just
Shuffle Them Around
A Little Bit,

983
00:42:37,018 --> 00:42:39,654
And We Can Spend
A Few More Hours
Together.

984
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:41,189
Allie: Mom.

985
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:42,690
Can You Come Here?

986
00:42:50,297 --> 00:42:52,266
Joey: Ta-Da!

987
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:55,437
It's Our Substitute
Christmas Tree.

988
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:57,238
Just In Case Dad
Gets Home

989
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,274
Late Tomorrow Night
And We Don't Have Time
To Get A Real One.

990
00:42:59,306 --> 00:43:00,641
Do You Like It?

991
00:43:00,674 --> 00:43:02,410
I Love It.

992
00:43:03,377 --> 00:43:06,280
You Guys.

993
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:08,649
Oh, And I Got
Something That's Gonna
Make It Even Better.

994
00:43:10,118 --> 00:43:12,687
So, That's What
This Thing's For.

995
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:14,989
That's Why
They Call It
A Fireplace, Joey.

996
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:16,490
We Should Do This
More Often.

997
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,226
Are You Sure You've
Got Time For This?

998
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:20,027
You Make It Sound Like
I'm Always Working.

999
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,763
You Are.

1000
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,763
You Are.

1001
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:22,730
Especially
This Time
Of The Year.

1002
00:43:22,763 --> 00:43:26,000
Well,
It's My Busy Season.
You Know That.

1003
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:28,569
But It'll Quiet Down
After New Year's.

1004
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:32,373
Joey: Mom, I Miss Dad.

1005
00:43:32,406 --> 00:43:34,742
Oh, I Do, Too,
But You Know
What?

1006
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:36,978
He's Gonna
Be Home
Really Soon.

1007
00:43:39,446 --> 00:43:41,449
'Cause
The Storm's Over.
It's Over.

1008
00:43:47,355 --> 00:43:49,024
(Whirring And Buzzing)

1009
00:44:04,806 --> 00:44:06,141
(Yawns)

1010
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:36,071
Ok, Bye.

1011
00:44:37,138 --> 00:44:39,340
Samantha?
Be Good Today.

1012
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:40,842
And Be Sure
To Help Out
Mrs. Thompson

1013
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,477
I Will.

1014
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,477
Ok.

1015
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:43,710
What's Going On?

1016
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:46,113
I Don't Know.
It Turned Itself
Back On.

1017
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:47,282
So, Turn It Off.

1018
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:49,150
I Tried.
It Won't Do It.

1019
00:44:49,183 --> 00:44:50,552
Why Wouldn't It?

1020
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,520
I Don't Know.
None Of The Buttons
Work Anymore.

1021
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:54,122
Mrs. Thompson:
But, Linda, Listen.

1022
00:44:54,154 --> 00:44:56,658
Is There Any Way
You Can Stay Home Today?

1023
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,859
No, We're Already
Understaffed,

1024
00:44:58,893 --> 00:45:01,396
And With The Storm,
The Whole Hospital's
On Emergency Alert.

1025
00:45:01,428 --> 00:45:03,564
The Road's Are Just
Gonna Be Awful.

1026
00:45:03,598 --> 00:45:04,866
I Know.
I'll Be Ok.

1027
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:05,866
Thanks A Lot,
Michelle.

1028
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:07,634
You Be Careful.

1029
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:07,634
Ok. Good-Bye.

1030
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:09,070
Ok.

1031
00:45:10,904 --> 00:45:12,173
Bye.

1032
00:45:16,643 --> 00:45:18,545
Tv Announcer: Right, Bob,
The Surprise Blizzard

1033
00:45:18,578 --> 00:45:21,248
Continues To Wreak Havoc
Throughout The West Coast.

1034
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:23,218
The National Guard
Has Been Called Out

1035
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,819
To Ensure
That No Motorists Attempt

1036
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:27,622
To Use The Closed Freeways.

1037
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:29,890
A Record Number Of Airports,
Bus Lines, And Rail Services
Have Been Completely--

1038
00:45:29,924 --> 00:45:32,192
Hadley! Hadley!

1039
00:45:32,225 --> 00:45:33,460
This Story Just Came In.

1040
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:35,662
The Cast Of <I> Friends
Are Trapped Inside
Their Studio.

1041
00:45:35,696 --> 00:45:37,132
I Want You On It
Right Away!

1042
00:45:37,165 --> 00:45:37,799
Yes, Sir. I'll
Get Right On

1043
00:45:37,832 --> 00:45:39,733
That Riveting
Bit Of News.

1044
00:45:39,766 --> 00:45:42,770
You Better,
Or You'll Get Right On
The Unemployment Line.

1045
00:45:51,846 --> 00:45:53,348
Here It Comes.

1046
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:59,553
Storm Originated
At...

1047
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,325
318 Central
Avenue.

1048
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,161
Yes.

1049
00:46:17,404 --> 00:46:18,839
Allie: Hey, Mom.

1050
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:20,275
We Shoveled The Driveway.

1051
00:46:20,308 --> 00:46:22,911
It Just Keeps
Coming Down.

1052
00:46:26,913 --> 00:46:28,482
What's Wrong?

1053
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:31,485
Well, I've Had
A Lot Of Calls,

1054
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:36,424
And Your Uncle Don
And Aunt Gwen
Are Snowed In

1055
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:39,259
And Won't Be Here Tomorrow.

1056
00:46:39,292 --> 00:46:41,495
And Neither Will
Your Grandparents.

1057
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:44,199
Well,
What About Dad?

1058
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:45,366
Have You Heard
From Him?

1059
00:46:45,399 --> 00:46:47,435
Dad Is Stuck
In San Francisco,

1060
00:46:47,468 --> 00:46:49,370
And Everything
Is Shut Down.

1061
00:46:51,672 --> 00:46:53,241
Can't He
Rent A Car?

1062
00:46:53,274 --> 00:46:56,611
Oh, Sweetie,
The Roads Are Closed.

1063
00:46:56,643 --> 00:46:59,613
So, He Won't Be
Coming Home For
Christmas, Will He?

1064
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:02,549
No, Honey.

1065
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:04,751
No Fair!
I Hate The Snow.

1066
00:47:04,785 --> 00:47:06,520
I Wish
It Never Happened.

1067
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:07,955
I Know. Me, Too.

1068
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:15,797
(Sniffling)

1069
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:28,343
Man: If You
Can't Move It,
Push It Off To The Side.

1070
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:31,245
Woman: I'm Doing
The Best I Can Here.

1071
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:33,848
(Horn Honking)
Man: Reverse,
Then Forward!

1072
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:35,683
Hadley:
Oh, For The Love Of--

1073
00:47:35,716 --> 00:47:38,587
Hasn't Anyone In This Town
Ever Seen A Blizzard Before?

1074
00:47:42,056 --> 00:47:44,492
What Is The Matter
With You People?

1075
00:47:46,393 --> 00:47:47,694
Man: Come On.
Get Back In Your Car.

1076
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:50,664
Stop!
Stop! Stop!

1077
00:47:50,698 --> 00:47:52,699
Whoa! Something Wrong?

1078
00:47:52,732 --> 00:47:53,801
I'm Edwin Hadley.

1079
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:55,703
Who?
I'm Edwin Hadley!

1080
00:47:55,736 --> 00:47:57,438
Channel 3
Action Now News.

1081
00:47:57,471 --> 00:47:59,407
Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
You're That Real Boring
News Guy.

1082
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,842
Yes, Exactly.

1083
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:02,744
I Need To Commandeer
Your Vehicle.

1084
00:48:02,777 --> 00:48:04,412
It's For Official
Meteorological
Business.

1085
00:48:04,444 --> 00:48:06,480
Now Give Me
The Helmet.

1086
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:08,849
I'll Be Sure
To Mention You
In My Emmy Speech.

1087
00:48:11,886 --> 00:48:12,954
Hey, Hey!

1088
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:15,523
Man!

1089
00:48:16,924 --> 00:48:19,027
You Are Done Like Dinner,
Literally.

1090
00:48:20,895 --> 00:48:24,299
No. No, Mrs. Dombrowski,
Don't Cancel.

1091
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:27,835
No, You Know What?
Your Party Is Gonna
Go Off Without A Hitch.

1092
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:29,070
Despite The Storm.

1093
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:31,471
I Give You My Word
As A Caterer.

1094
00:48:31,504 --> 00:48:34,776
I Give You My Word
As A Mother.
Absolutely.

1095
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:36,977
Uh-Huh, No Problem.

1096
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:38,946
Allie: Yeah.
I Understand.

1097
00:48:38,978 --> 00:48:42,350
Mm-Hmm. Ok.
Thanks. Bye.

1098
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:46,954
That Was Blake.

1099
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:49,323
He Cancelled
The Party Because
Of The Storm.

1100
00:48:49,357 --> 00:48:51,692
This Is So
Out Of Control,
Allie.

1101
00:48:51,725 --> 00:48:52,794
This Thing Is
Single-Handedly

1102
00:48:52,826 --> 00:48:54,594
Destroying
Our Lives.

1103
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:57,097
Thanks, 'Cause
I Didn't Feel
Bad Enough Already.

1104
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:58,498
(Huffs)

1105
00:48:58,531 --> 00:49:01,102
Sam, Where You Going?

1106
00:49:01,134 --> 00:49:04,339
Sam!
Sam, I Tried Everything.

1107
00:49:04,372 --> 00:49:06,540
Well, We'll Just
Have To Try Again.

1108
00:49:08,808 --> 00:49:11,812
I'm Telling You,
It Won't Work.

1109
00:49:11,846 --> 00:49:13,648
(Gasps)

1110
00:49:11,846 --> 00:49:13,648
(Gasps)

1111
00:49:13,681 --> 00:49:15,817
Hey, Joey?
What Are You Doing?

1112
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,984
I Saw It.

1113
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:17,984
Saw What?

1114
00:49:18,018 --> 00:49:21,389
My Present.
Don't Pretend
It's Not Out There.

1115
00:49:21,422 --> 00:49:23,124
Joey, That's Not
Your Present.

1116
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:24,459
Yeah, It Is.

1117
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:26,526
I Told You
I'd Find It.

1118
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,996
I Can't Believe
You Hid It In
The Flower Box Again.

1119
00:49:29,029 --> 00:49:32,065
Uh, Duh.
That's Where You Hid
My Birthday Present.

1120
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:33,767
Joey,
I'm Telling You

1121
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:34,669
That's Not
Your Present.

1122
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:36,636
Then What Is It?

1123
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:36,636
None Of Your Business.

1124
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:38,572
I Saw An Antenna.
Is It A Boom Box?

1125
00:49:38,605 --> 00:49:39,940
No. Joey, Look,

1126
00:49:39,973 --> 00:49:40,741
It Maybe Yours,
Or It May Not Be,

1127
00:49:40,774 --> 00:49:42,642
But You've Got
To Leave It Alone.

1128
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:43,745
I Don't Want You
Near That Window
Again,

1129
00:49:43,777 --> 00:49:45,113
Do You Hear Me?

1130
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,749
Mom!

1131
00:49:48,783 --> 00:49:52,687
Uh, Mrs. Dombrowski,
Can You Hold On Just
A Second? Thank You.

1132
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:53,754
What?!

1133
00:49:53,788 --> 00:49:54,989
Joey's Bothering Us!

1134
00:49:55,022 --> 00:49:56,657
No, I'm Not!

1135
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,526
Joey, Come Down Here
Right This Instant.

1136
00:49:58,558 --> 00:49:59,660
But, Mom!

1137
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:01,395
I Said, Come Here!

1138
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:02,930
Mrs. Dombrowski:
Come There?!
I Can't Even--

1139
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:06,933
Not You.
Mrs. Dombrowski,
I'm--You--You Can

1140
00:50:06,966 --> 00:50:08,702
Stay Where You Are.

1141
00:50:09,969 --> 00:50:12,873
I Knew I'd Find It.
Heh Heh Heh.

1142
00:50:15,475 --> 00:50:17,844
Look, Why Don't We
Just Go And Give That Man
Back His Machine?

1143
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:19,946
No.

1144
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:19,946
Why Not?

1145
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,417
Because Mom Doesn't Want Us
Going Outside.

1146
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:24,185
Besides, I'm Kind Of Scared
To Go Back There,

1147
00:50:24,218 --> 00:50:25,953
Not That We Did
Anything Wrong Or Anything.

1148
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:28,489
You Mean, Besides Burying
The City Of Los Angeles

1149
00:50:28,522 --> 00:50:30,824
Under 10 Feet Of Snow?

1150
00:50:30,857 --> 00:50:33,861
Anyways, I Don't Think
We Can Find That Place
Again, Even If We Tried.

1151
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:37,497
Well, We've Got To Do Somethin.
Let's Smash It
With The Hammer.

1152
00:50:37,531 --> 00:50:39,667
No Way! That Can
Make Things Worse.

1153
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:41,002
How Do You Know?

1154
00:50:41,035 --> 00:50:43,036
I Don't,
But What If It Does?

1155
00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:46,140
Ok, Then What Do We Do?
'Cause We Can't Just Sit Here--

1156
00:50:46,172 --> 00:50:47,808
I've Got An Idea.

1157
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:51,813
The Machine's Antennas
Are Pretty Small,

1158
00:50:51,846 --> 00:50:53,481
And They're Sending Snow
To San Francisco, Right?

1159
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:55,582
Yeah.

1160
00:50:55,616 --> 00:50:57,585
Well, If We Make
The Antennas Longer With
Coat Hangers Or Something,

1161
00:50:57,618 --> 00:50:59,453
Then We Can Send The Signal
All The Way To Outer Space.

1162
00:50:59,486 --> 00:51:02,489
And Cause A Blizzard
All Over The World?

1163
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:05,625
Great Idea.
We'll Be Responsible
For The Next Ice Age.

1164
00:51:05,658 --> 00:51:07,794
Stop Being Such A Pessimist.

1165
00:51:07,828 --> 00:51:09,897
I'm Not.
I'm Being Realistic.

1166
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,665
If You Hadn't
Stolen The Machine,

1167
00:51:11,698 --> 00:51:13,099
None Of This
Would've Happened.

1168
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:15,636
I Didn't Steal It.
I Took It Out Of The Garbage.

1169
00:51:15,669 --> 00:51:17,672
If You Were So Worried About I,
Then Why Didn't You Stop Me?

1170
00:51:17,705 --> 00:51:19,172
I Tried To.

1171
00:51:17,705 --> 00:51:19,172
No, You Didn't.

1172
00:51:19,205 --> 00:51:20,607
You Were Too Chicken,
Like Always.

1173
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,008
Chicken?

1174
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,008
Yeah, Chicken.

1175
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,178
(Loud Pop)

1176
00:51:26,013 --> 00:51:28,583
Great,
The Electricity.

1177
00:51:28,616 --> 00:51:31,118
What Are You Gonna
Do Now, Einstein?

1178
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:33,553
I'd Help You Out,
But I'm Too Chicken.

1179
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:36,157
Uh, Yeah, That Was
The Electricity.

1180
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,826
(Woman Complaining And Sobbing
On The Other Line)

1181
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:42,529
Are--Mrs. Dombrowski?

1182
00:51:42,562 --> 00:51:43,897
Are You Crying?

1183
00:51:45,866 --> 00:51:49,536
Look, I'm Really Sorry, Ok?
I Didn't Mean It.

1184
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:52,205
It's Just...I'm Getting
Really Scared Right Now,

1185
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:54,742
And I Don't Know
What To Do Anymore.

1186
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:58,812
D-Do You Have
A Lead Box?

1187
00:51:59,779 --> 00:52:01,716
What?

1188
00:52:01,748 --> 00:52:05,018
I Don't Know.
It Worked For Superman.

1189
00:52:05,051 --> 00:52:07,187
If You Put That Thing
In A Lead Box,

1190
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:09,824
Maybe It'll
Stop The Rays
From Getting Out.

1191
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:15,129
Well, My Dad's Got
A Big Toolbox In The Garage.

1192
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:17,598
We Can Put The Machine In It
And Then Bury It
In The Backyard.

1193
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:18,966
Let's Go Get It.

1194
00:52:18,998 --> 00:52:20,734
Ok, But We've Gotta
Be Quiet.

1195
00:52:20,768 --> 00:52:22,904
Mom Doesn't Want Us
Going Outside.

1196
00:52:22,937 --> 00:52:26,806
Yeah. No. I Understand,
Mrs. Dombrowski.

1197
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:29,042
No--Yeah. Ok. Bye Bye.

1198
00:52:29,944 --> 00:52:31,078
Ugh!

1199
00:52:31,111 --> 00:52:32,212
Let Me Guess...

1200
00:52:32,245 --> 00:52:33,547
She Canceled.

1201
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,781
Yeah.

1202
00:52:34,815 --> 00:52:37,785
Good! I'm Glad.

1203
00:52:37,817 --> 00:52:40,754
They Don't Call Her
"Cheapo Dombrowski"
For Nothing, You Know.

1204
00:52:40,788 --> 00:52:42,590
We Would Have Been
There Till
3:00 In The Morning

1205
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,659
And Not Even
Have Gotten A Tip.

1206
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:47,862
Well, I Better
Get Home.

1207
00:52:47,895 --> 00:52:50,631
I Don't Want
To Miss The Excitement
When The Pipes Burst!

1208
00:52:50,663 --> 00:52:52,265
Ruben, You Really
Ought To Think About
Staying Around

1209
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:54,134
Until At Least
The Storm Calms Down.

1210
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,670
What? At This Rate,
That Will Be, Like,
The Fourth Of July.

1211
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,906
Well...

1212
00:53:00,073 --> 00:53:00,941
Shh!

1213
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,247
Mom! The Girls
Are Sneaking Out!

1214
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:11,285
What Are You Doing?

1215
00:53:11,317 --> 00:53:13,353
We're Just
Going Outside.

1216
00:53:13,386 --> 00:53:16,856
No! I Told You
To Stay Inside,
And I Meant It!

1217
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,859
Um, But We're Just
Going To The Garage.

1218
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:20,627
It's Going To
Get Dark Soon,

1219
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,828
And Dad's Got
A Big Flashlight
Out There,

1220
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:23,163
The One
For Emergencies.

1221
00:53:23,196 --> 00:53:24,731
Ok, Go.

1222
00:53:24,765 --> 00:53:27,602
Can I Go Outside, Too?

1223
00:53:24,765 --> 00:53:27,602
No!

1224
00:53:27,634 --> 00:53:28,736
Why Not?

1225
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:30,037
Joey! Please!

1226
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:35,910
Come On!

1227
00:53:51,658 --> 00:53:53,160
There's Some Boxes
Over There,

1228
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:54,962
And I Think
There's Some Shovels
On The Workbench.

1229
00:53:57,163 --> 00:53:59,299
Uh, Samantha,
Can You Open That?

1230
00:53:59,332 --> 00:54:01,835
Open It? I Can't
Even See It.

1231
00:54:01,868 --> 00:54:02,836
Ouch!

1232
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,105
Man: Ouch!

1233
00:54:04,138 --> 00:54:05,306
Second Man: Ow!

1234
00:54:04,138 --> 00:54:05,306
Third Man: Ow!

1235
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,208
Samantha?
Is That You?

1236
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:08,977
Just The First One.

1237
00:54:10,777 --> 00:54:12,145
(Gasps)

1238
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:13,747
Aah!

1239
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:13,747
Aah!

1240
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:14,882
Aah!

1241
00:54:14,915 --> 00:54:16,683
Aah!

1242
00:54:14,915 --> 00:54:16,683
Aah!

1243
00:54:14,915 --> 00:54:16,683
Aah!

1244
00:54:16,716 --> 00:54:18,818
Not So Fast!

1245
00:54:18,852 --> 00:54:22,123
You've Got Some
Explaining To Do, Allie.

1246
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:24,659
You, Too, Samantha.

1247
00:54:25,391 --> 00:54:26,993
Who...

1248
00:54:25,391 --> 00:54:26,993
Allie...

1249
00:54:27,027 --> 00:54:29,196
You Are Number 263

1250
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:31,031
On My Los Angeles
Naughty Girl List.

1251
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:33,233
Um...

1252
00:54:33,266 --> 00:54:34,701
You Mean You're...

1253
00:54:34,734 --> 00:54:36,169
You're...

1254
00:54:36,203 --> 00:54:38,005
But You Couldn't Be.

1255
00:54:38,038 --> 00:54:39,740
Oh, No, No, No.
Of Course Not.

1256
00:54:39,772 --> 00:54:41,675
It's Utterly Impossible,
Isn't It, <I> Allie?

1257
00:54:41,709 --> 00:54:43,210
Oof!

1258
00:54:43,243 --> 00:54:44,779
Or Should I Use
Your Full Name, Hmm?

1259
00:54:44,812 --> 00:54:48,683
Allison Rachel
Thompson.

1260
00:54:48,716 --> 00:54:51,451
Your Favorite Food
Is Thick-Crust Pizza

1261
00:54:51,484 --> 00:54:54,220
With Sausage
And Extra Cheese.

1262
00:54:54,254 --> 00:54:57,123
You Have A Big Crush
On Blake Lynch,

1263
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:59,026
Who Sits Near You
In English Class,

1264
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:03,096
And Your Best
Friend Is Samantha
Elizabeth Kwan.

1265
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:04,464
I Love It
When He Does This.

1266
00:55:04,498 --> 00:55:05,766
Yeah. He's Good.

1267
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:07,134
You Are President

1268
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:09,469
Of Grant Junior High's
Spanish Club.

1269
00:55:09,502 --> 00:55:11,337
You Brush Your Teeth
3 Times A Day,

1270
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:14,474
Which Is Very Good,
But You Seldom Floss.

1271
00:55:14,507 --> 00:55:17,143
Now Do You Believe
I'm Santa?

1272
00:55:17,176 --> 00:55:19,979
No. Anyone Could Have
Figured That Out.

1273
00:55:20,013 --> 00:55:21,781
If You're Really Him,
Then Tell Me

1274
00:55:21,815 --> 00:55:23,117
What I'm Thinking
Right Now.

1275
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:25,919
He's Santa, Kid,
Not The Amazing Kreskin.

1276
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:28,089
You Want Something
A Little More
Personal, Is That It?

1277
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:29,257
All Right.

1278
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,160
Samantha,
When You're Alone,

1279
00:55:33,192 --> 00:55:35,228
You Like To Dance
To Ricky Martin Music

1280
00:55:35,261 --> 00:55:36,830
And Pretend You're
Married To Him.

1281
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,499
You Do?

1282
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,499
No!

1283
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:41,402
Heh Heh Heh Heh.
Shall I Go On?

1284
00:55:41,435 --> 00:55:42,469
No!

1285
00:55:43,437 --> 00:55:44,872
Allie...

1286
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,442
Even Though...

1287
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:51,377
Your Friends
May Think You Have
The Perfect Family,

1288
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,379
We Both Know That
Things Aren't Always

1289
00:55:53,413 --> 00:55:54,748
The Way You'd
Like Them To Be.

1290
00:55:55,415 --> 00:55:57,451
The Fact Is

1291
00:55:57,484 --> 00:56:00,121
That You, Your
Mother And Father
And Even Little Joey

1292
00:56:00,154 --> 00:56:03,324
Are So Busy Going
In A Million
Different Directions

1293
00:56:03,357 --> 00:56:05,391
That No One
Ever Has Time
For One Another.

1294
00:56:05,424 --> 00:56:07,928
And Even Though You
Put On A Brave Face

1295
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,498
And Act Like It
Doesn't Bother You,
It Does.

1296
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:14,901
Sometimes
It Makes You
Very, Very Sad.

1297
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:16,938
Allie, You Never
Told Me That.

1298
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:21,408
Ok, So...

1299
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,977
If You're
Santa, Then...

1300
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:26,814
Who Are <I> They?

1301
00:56:26,846 --> 00:56:29,449
Oh, Pardon Me.

1302
00:56:29,482 --> 00:56:32,952
This Is Crumpet
And Sparky,
2 Of My Elves.

1303
00:56:32,986 --> 00:56:34,788
Elves?

1304
00:56:34,821 --> 00:56:36,289
Yes.

1305
00:56:36,323 --> 00:56:38,192
But They're
So...

1306
00:56:38,225 --> 00:56:39,426
Don't Say It!

1307
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:40,493
Tall!

1308
00:56:40,527 --> 00:56:43,397
She Said It.

1309
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,332
Do You Have
A Problem With That?

1310
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:47,902
(Doorbell)

1311
00:56:53,006 --> 00:56:54,341
Good Afternoon.

1312
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:55,975
Hi.

1313
00:56:56,009 --> 00:56:57,445
I'm Edwin Hadley.

1314
00:56:59,513 --> 00:57:02,248
Channel 3
Action Now News.

1315
00:57:02,281 --> 00:57:05,118
Oh, Hello!
I Didn't Recognize You.

1316
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:11,991
M-May I Come In?

1317
00:57:12,024 --> 00:57:14,527
Yeah, Um...
Excuse Me.

1318
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,029
I'm So Sorry.

1319
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:32,980
Is There Something
I Can Help You With?

1320
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:36,449
Congratulations!
You've...

1321
00:57:37,484 --> 00:57:40,286
Won Our Special
Contest,

1322
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,022
An Afternoon
With Edwin.

1323
00:57:43,022 --> 00:57:45,391
Really?
Oh! Well...

1324
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:46,893
Well, That's Great.

1325
00:57:46,926 --> 00:57:49,395
I--I Don't Remember
Entering Any Contest.

1326
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:50,997
What A Lovely Place!

1327
00:57:52,065 --> 00:57:53,201
So Bright.

1328
00:57:54,401 --> 00:57:55,569
So Festive!

1329
00:57:57,303 --> 00:57:58,405
So...

1330
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:06,647
What's That?

1331
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,882
The Kids Did That.

1332
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:11,352
It's Our Substitute
Christmas Tree.

1333
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:13,553
We Couldn't Get A Real One
Because The Storm--

1334
00:58:13,587 --> 00:58:15,422
Yes! The Storm.

1335
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:17,991
What Do You Make
Of Our Little Storm?

1336
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:20,960
Um...

1337
00:58:20,993 --> 00:58:23,564
It's A <I> Bad Storm...

1338
00:58:23,596 --> 00:58:26,065
Uh...When Do You Think
It's Going To End?

1339
00:58:26,098 --> 00:58:29,102
I Was Hoping You
Could Tell Me That.

1340
00:58:29,136 --> 00:58:30,438
Me? Excuse Me?

1341
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:33,107
Who's This?

1342
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,408
That's My Husband.

1343
00:58:39,312 --> 00:58:41,015
Is He In Some Kind
Of Government Work?

1344
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,116
Some Sort Of,
"Can't Tell Ya, Gotta
Kill Ya" Operation?

1345
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:46,053
No! He's In Software.

1346
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:46,953
Hmm.

1347
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:57,031
Uh...Would You
Like Some Coffee?

1348
00:59:06,605 --> 00:59:08,207
Everything
All Right?

1349
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:09,377
Yes, Fine.

1350
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:13,113
Just Admiring
Your Handiwork.

1351
00:59:13,145 --> 00:59:15,082
What Did You Say?

1352
00:59:15,114 --> 00:59:18,319
I Asked You If
You Would Like
Some Coffee.

1353
00:59:18,352 --> 00:59:19,520
No. Never
Touch The Stuff.

1354
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:21,020
Wait. Yes.

1355
00:59:21,053 --> 00:59:23,423
Ok, Uh...
How Do You Take It?

1356
00:59:23,457 --> 00:59:24,991
Cream? Sugar?

1357
00:59:25,024 --> 00:59:26,126
Both.

1358
00:59:27,627 --> 00:59:29,497
But I'll
Mix Them Myself
Out Here.

1359
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:30,998
Ok.

1360
00:59:33,766 --> 00:59:35,669
Both!

1361
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:37,203
And If It Isn't
Too Much Trouble,

1362
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:39,072
I'd Like
Some Cookies,
And Candy,

1363
00:59:39,105 --> 00:59:41,040
Maybe Some Nuts,
A Bowl Of Fruit,

1364
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:43,176
Popcorn,
Toast With Butter,

1365
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,279
Maybe A Pot Roast.

1366
00:59:45,312 --> 00:59:46,980
I'll See
What I Can Do.

1367
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:50,618
Yams, If You
Have Them.

1368
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:54,555
A Snow Day, Huh?

1369
00:59:54,587 --> 00:59:56,723
We Kinda Had
A Paper Due.

1370
00:59:56,756 --> 00:59:59,392
And I Tried To
Shut Off The Machine
A Bunch Of Times.

1371
00:59:59,426 --> 01:00:01,228
Honest.

1372
01:00:01,261 --> 01:00:03,364
It's Very
Temperamental.

1373
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:05,498
It Took Me
Over 2 Months
To Build It.

1374
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:08,602
But, Santa,
I Thought You Worked
At The North Pole.

1375
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:10,270
Well, Normally I Do,

1376
01:00:10,303 --> 01:00:13,073
But There Are
So Many Distractions
At The North Pole,

1377
01:00:13,105 --> 01:00:14,640
Especially At This Time
Of The Year.

1378
01:00:14,674 --> 01:00:18,478
I Thought I Finally
Had The Machine
Finished On Thursday,

1379
01:00:18,511 --> 01:00:20,314
And I Was Going
To Go Back, But Then

1380
01:00:20,346 --> 01:00:22,248
When It Started
To Do All Sorts
Of Odd Things,

1381
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:24,484
Like Raining When
It Should Be Snowing

1382
01:00:24,518 --> 01:00:26,387
And Snowing
When It Should Be
Sunny And--

1383
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:28,254
And That's Why
You Got Frustrated

1384
01:00:28,288 --> 01:00:29,323
And Threw It Away.

1385
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:31,424
Exactly.

1386
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:34,060
But It's Such
An Important
Machine.

1387
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,662
Very Important.

1388
01:00:36,696 --> 01:00:39,033
Extremely
Important.

1389
01:00:39,065 --> 01:00:40,567
Why?

1390
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,036
"Why?"

1391
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,036
"Why?"

1392
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:43,437
This Kid
Is Funny.

1393
01:00:43,469 --> 01:00:45,105
Yeah, Why?

1394
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:47,473
We Never
Understood That, Either.

1395
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:51,411
It's Important Because
I Wanted To Give People

1396
01:00:51,444 --> 01:00:53,480
The Ultimate
Christmas Present.

1397
01:00:56,582 --> 01:01:00,420
A Gentle,
White Snowfall

1398
01:01:00,453 --> 01:01:02,689
So Simple
And So Pure

1399
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:06,093
That We Would All Just
Stop Rushing Around

1400
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:09,763
And Take A Few Moments
To Be Reminded

1401
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:11,698
Of The Magic
Of The Season.

1402
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:14,100
Ah.

1403
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:14,100
Mmm.

1404
01:01:16,335 --> 01:01:18,171
It's All
My Fault, Santa.

1405
01:01:18,205 --> 01:01:20,574
If I Hadn't Been
Such A Total Lame-O

1406
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:22,309
And Just Written
My Paper Like
I Was Supposed To,

1407
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:24,077
None Of This
Would Have Happened.

1408
01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:27,381
I'm So Sorry, Santa.

1409
01:01:27,413 --> 01:01:29,549
(Sniffs)

1410
01:01:29,582 --> 01:01:32,318
There'll Be Plenty
Of Time To Talk
About That Later.

1411
01:01:32,352 --> 01:01:35,522
The Important Thing
Right Now Is To Stop
This Storm!

1412
01:01:35,555 --> 01:01:37,357
Now, Where
Is The Machine?

1413
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:50,737
Mom! Mom!

1414
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:53,674
Oh! Oh! Mom!

1415
01:01:53,707 --> 01:01:55,342
Whoa!

1416
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,478
Where'd You Get
That, Little Boy?

1417
01:01:57,511 --> 01:01:59,179
I Found It!

1418
01:01:59,212 --> 01:02:00,581
Found It?
You Mean Stole It,
Don't You?

1419
01:02:00,614 --> 01:02:02,182
You Know What
Happens To Little
Boys Who Steal!

1420
01:02:02,214 --> 01:02:04,151
I Didn't Steal It!
I Found It!

1421
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:04,984
They Go To Jail!

1422
01:02:05,018 --> 01:02:07,221
For A Long Time!
Sometimes Forever!

1423
01:02:07,254 --> 01:02:09,589
I Don't Want
To Go To Jail!

1424
01:02:09,623 --> 01:02:10,824
Why Don't You Hand
It Over To Me,

1425
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:12,493
And I'll See
What I Can Do.

1426
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:13,759
There You Go.
Go On Now!

1427
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:15,829
Aaahh!

1428
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:19,567
A Weather-Making
Machine!

1429
01:02:22,669 --> 01:02:25,672
From Now On,I Will Be
The Greatest Weatherman
In The World,

1430
01:02:25,705 --> 01:02:28,842
Because I...Will
Control...The Weather!

1431
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,377
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

1432
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,645
(Coughs)

1433
01:02:31,678 --> 01:02:33,413
Hi, Honey. It's Me.

1434
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:35,281
Um, I Hope You Check
Your Voice Mail.

1435
01:02:35,315 --> 01:02:37,885
Um, Did You Enter
A Contest?

1436
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:39,218
Mom, I Didn't
Steal It!

1437
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:40,821
I Found It,
And It's Making Snow,

1438
01:02:40,853 --> 01:02:42,522
And The Man Says
I Could Go To Jail,

1439
01:02:42,556 --> 01:02:43,824
Maybe Forever!

1440
01:02:43,857 --> 01:02:45,526
Ok, Wait.
Slow Down.

1441
01:02:45,558 --> 01:02:47,393
What Did You Say?
I'm Sorry. I'm Not
Understanding You.

1442
01:02:47,426 --> 01:02:48,695
You're Going
Too Fast.

1443
01:02:50,397 --> 01:02:52,600
We Have To Find
A Way To Distract Her.

1444
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:56,904
Have You Ever Played
Ding-Dong-Ditch?

1445
01:02:56,937 --> 01:02:58,772
Uh-Uh.
Uh-Uh.

1446
01:02:58,805 --> 01:03:00,806
Wh-What Did You Steal?
What's Making Snow?

1447
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:01,908
Upstairs!

1448
01:03:01,942 --> 01:03:03,177
(Doorbell Rings)

1449
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,512
Just A Second.

1450
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:07,180
But, Mom!

1451
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:17,257
Hello?!

1452
01:03:18,558 --> 01:03:19,560
Hello?!

1453
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:23,796
Ah! Hello?!

1454
01:03:24,531 --> 01:03:25,666
(Giggling)

1455
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:31,271
It's Snowing
In Allie's Room!

1456
01:03:31,303 --> 01:03:33,906
Joey, Please.
I've Got Enough Problems
Right Now, Ok?

1457
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,909
Alrighty!
Where'd The Tv Guy Go?

1458
01:03:35,942 --> 01:03:36,810
Mom!

1459
01:03:44,683 --> 01:03:46,352
Hey! Who Are You?

1460
01:03:46,386 --> 01:03:47,888
It's That Boring
Weatherman From Tv.

1461
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,957
Edwin, Give Me
The Machine.

1462
01:04:02,602 --> 01:04:04,837
Give Me The Weather
Machine, Edwin.

1463
01:04:05,739 --> 01:04:06,707
Never!

1464
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:07,908
Edwin...

1465
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,310
Edwin...

1466
01:04:10,343 --> 01:04:11,511
Whoa...Ahh!

1467
01:04:12,011 --> 01:04:13,214
(Gasps)

1468
01:04:19,285 --> 01:04:20,687
Let's Take The Stairs.

1469
01:04:21,855 --> 01:04:22,923
Whoa! Ah!

1470
01:04:27,393 --> 01:04:28,694
Arr!

1471
01:04:28,727 --> 01:04:31,797
No One <I> Ever
Believes Me!

1472
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,966
Hey Joey!
This Is Santa
And His Elf.

1473
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,469
Pleased To Meet
You, Joey.

1474
01:04:35,502 --> 01:04:36,837
Don't Tell Mom, Ok?

1475
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:38,872
Coochie-Coochie!

1476
01:04:43,977 --> 01:04:45,779
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

1477
01:04:48,647 --> 01:04:49,682
Stop!

1478
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:50,851
Stop!

1479
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:50,851
Stop!

1480
01:04:52,819 --> 01:04:54,587
I Know A Shortcut!

1481
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,556
Please, Not
Another Shortcut!

1482
01:04:58,924 --> 01:05:00,260
(Panting)

1483
01:05:02,995 --> 01:05:03,963
Sparky, Come On!

1484
01:05:04,663 --> 01:05:05,966
Ok!

1485
01:05:10,437 --> 01:05:12,339
Nothing Can
Stop Me Now!

1486
01:05:12,372 --> 01:05:13,406
Stop!

1487
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,508
Aah!

1488
01:05:17,676 --> 01:05:18,745
Aah!

1489
01:05:20,946 --> 01:05:21,848
Waah!

1490
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,995
Come On!
He Passed Through
This Candy Factory!

1491
01:05:42,736 --> 01:05:44,471
My...My Snowmobile!

1492
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,939
It's Ok, Horace.

1493
01:05:46,973 --> 01:05:48,475
Perhaps Santa
Will Bring You

1494
01:05:48,507 --> 01:05:49,743
A New One
For Christmas, Hmm?

1495
01:05:49,776 --> 01:05:50,877
(Santa Chuckles)

1496
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:51,978
Let's Go.

1497
01:05:57,484 --> 01:05:59,018
(Footsteps Echoing)

1498
01:06:05,725 --> 01:06:07,861
Crumpet: Now, Where
Could He Have Gone?

1499
01:06:07,893 --> 01:06:09,962
It's Like
He Vanished.

1500
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,902
Santa:
He Disappeared.

1501
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:19,005
Over Here!

1502
01:06:21,908 --> 01:06:23,477
Chocolate
Footprints.

1503
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:24,977
Come On!

1504
01:06:49,803 --> 01:06:50,938
They Stop!

1505
01:07:01,915 --> 01:07:02,983
Huh!

1506
01:07:08,788 --> 01:07:09,923
Sparky, What
Are You Doing?

1507
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:12,859
It's Raining
Chocolate!

1508
01:07:21,201 --> 01:07:22,536
Stay Back.

1509
01:07:23,535 --> 01:07:24,703
Edwin...

1510
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,038
Give Us The Machine.
Please!

1511
01:07:26,071 --> 01:07:27,440
No, You Can't
Have It!

1512
01:07:27,473 --> 01:07:29,742
I Want It.
I Found It,
And It's Mine!

1513
01:07:31,977 --> 01:07:33,045
Sparky...

1514
01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:36,116
Grr!

1515
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:39,885
Rrr, Grr!

1516
01:07:39,919 --> 01:07:41,955
Stay Back,
I Tell You. Back!

1517
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:44,089
Stay Down,
Sparky, Don't!

1518
01:07:44,123 --> 01:07:45,626
No! Stay Back!

1519
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:48,060
Aah!

1520
01:07:49,529 --> 01:07:50,764
Get Him!

1521
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:54,435
Aah!

1522
01:07:55,902 --> 01:07:57,738
Santa: Allie, The Machine!

1523
01:07:59,906 --> 01:08:00,974
Aah!

1524
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:05,812
Whew!

1525
01:08:06,846 --> 01:08:07,981
Oh!

1526
01:08:08,013 --> 01:08:09,216
Well Done,
Allie!

1527
01:08:09,248 --> 01:08:10,984
Good Job, Al. Whoo!

1528
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:13,053
(Gasps)

1529
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:15,622
I Hate Cotton Candy!

1530
01:08:15,655 --> 01:08:16,857
(Gasps)

1531
01:08:24,963 --> 01:08:26,198
Can't I Have It?

1532
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm Sorry,
Edwin. No!

1533
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:35,909
Guess I'll Be
On My Way.

1534
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:40,513
Or Not.

1535
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:42,281
Mmm. Mmm.

1536
01:08:42,315 --> 01:08:43,683
(Hammering)

1537
01:08:45,717 --> 01:08:46,919
Screwdriver!

1538
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:54,628
Wrench!

1539
01:08:57,864 --> 01:08:59,866
You Realize You Just
Can't Keep Me Here
Against My Will.

1540
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:02,002
I Have A Report
To File, After All!

1541
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:03,770
Not Now.

1542
01:09:05,738 --> 01:09:07,074
(Clears Throat)

1543
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:10,709
Chewing Gum!

1544
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:11,911
Sure, Boss!

1545
01:09:17,283 --> 01:09:18,218
Ew!

1546
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:20,954
Thank You.

1547
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:42,776
(Grunts)

1548
01:09:47,245 --> 01:09:48,882
I'm Stumped.

1549
01:09:48,914 --> 01:09:50,216
The "Q" Wire Is Attached.

1550
01:09:50,249 --> 01:09:52,052
The Rhombus Wheel Is Turning.

1551
01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:54,587
I've Triple-Checked Everything
From The Alpha Coil

1552
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,155
To The Zip Volume.

1553
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:59,258
In Theory, This Machine
Should Be Working Perfectly.

1554
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:01,361
Did You Check
The Batteries?

1555
01:10:01,393 --> 01:10:02,995
Batteries.

1556
01:10:03,029 --> 01:10:04,330
(Chuckling)

1557
01:10:04,364 --> 01:10:07,601
Oh, I Always Use My Own
Special Brand Of Batteries.

1558
01:10:07,633 --> 01:10:09,034
Evermerry.

1559
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:11,070
Each Battery
Lasts 100 Years,

1560
01:10:11,103 --> 01:10:13,106
So It Couldn't Possibly...

1561
01:10:13,138 --> 01:10:14,306
Oh, Dear.

1562
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:15,408
What's Wrong?

1563
01:10:15,441 --> 01:10:17,978
I Just Remembered That
When I Put The Batteries In,

1564
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,914
I Was Out Of Evermerrys,
So I Used Generic Ones.

1565
01:10:21,748 --> 01:10:23,350
Quick. Open These Up.

1566
01:10:49,808 --> 01:10:51,777
(Click, Whirring)

1567
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:53,213
I Think It's Working.

1568
01:10:54,312 --> 01:10:55,914
All Right!

1569
01:10:55,948 --> 01:10:58,351
Let's Raise
The Temperature
To 58 Degrees

1570
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:00,020
And Bring Up
The Sun!

1571
01:11:08,427 --> 01:11:09,962
(Cheering)

1572
01:11:17,003 --> 01:11:18,071
Oh, Dear.

1573
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:19,905
It's 4:05 Already.

1574
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:20,940
Do We Still
Have Time?

1575
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:22,074
Can We Make
Christmas?

1576
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:23,308
It'll Be Awfully,
Awfully Tight,

1577
01:11:23,342 --> 01:11:24,978
But Yes,
I Think We Can.

1578
01:11:25,011 --> 01:11:26,379
Boys, Let's Pack Up
Everything We Need
From Here

1579
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:27,814
And Quickly!

1580
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:32,451
Oh.

1581
01:11:32,485 --> 01:11:34,154
Santa, I'm...

1582
01:11:34,186 --> 01:11:35,387
Really On The "Naughty"
List, Aren't I?

1583
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,824
Yes,

1584
01:11:37,856 --> 01:11:41,694
But It Isn't
A Permanent Situation.

1585
01:11:41,727 --> 01:11:44,698
It Will Change If You've
Learned Something Today.

1586
01:11:47,232 --> 01:11:51,471
I Have High Hopes For You,
Allie Thompson.

1587
01:11:51,503 --> 01:11:54,674
You're A Trailblazer With
A Great Sense Of Adventure.

1588
01:11:56,042 --> 01:11:57,377
That Sounds
Pretty Good.

1589
01:11:57,409 --> 01:11:59,078
It Is.

1590
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:02,716
But It Also Comes
With A Great Deal
Of Responsibility.

1591
01:12:02,749 --> 01:12:04,350
It Does?

1592
01:12:02,749 --> 01:12:04,350
Yes.

1593
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:07,253
You Can't Waste All That
Energy And Brainpower

1594
01:12:07,285 --> 01:12:10,056
On Just Skipping
Homework Assignments

1595
01:12:10,088 --> 01:12:12,191
And Taking
What Doesn't Belong To You.

1596
01:12:12,225 --> 01:12:14,928
You Have To Use Them For Things
That Are Responsible

1597
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,329
And Unselfish.

1598
01:12:17,363 --> 01:12:22,201
Imagine If I Just Decided
To Skip Christmas.

1599
01:12:22,235 --> 01:12:26,039
Think Of All The Billions
Of Children Who Would
Wake Up On Christmas Morning

1600
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:27,339
To Find
Their Stockings Empty

1601
01:12:27,373 --> 01:12:29,276
And Nothing Under The Tree.

1602
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:36,149
You Did A Wonderful Job
Helping Me Today, Allie,

1603
01:12:36,182 --> 01:12:38,085
And I'll Never Forget That.

1604
01:12:46,392 --> 01:12:49,129
Oh, Please.
I May Lose My Lunch.

1605
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:50,797
Can We Just
Get On With This?

1606
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:51,797
I Have A Pulitzer Prize
To Win.

1607
01:12:52,932 --> 01:12:54,200
(Sighs)

1608
01:12:54,232 --> 01:12:55,201
Edwin.

1609
01:12:56,902 --> 01:13:01,074
Edwin, Edwin, Edwin.

1610
01:13:03,109 --> 01:13:04,945
I Couldn't Be
More Ashamed.

1611
01:13:06,812 --> 01:13:09,082
I Remember You
As A Child, Edwin.

1612
01:13:09,115 --> 01:13:12,552
You Were Bright, Inquisitive.
You Weren't A Crook.

1613
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:14,386
What Happened, Edwin?

1614
01:13:14,419 --> 01:13:16,055
Hmm?

1615
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:18,558
What Made You
Such A Selfish Snob?

1616
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,194
What Made You So Mean?

1617
01:13:21,226 --> 01:13:22,995
It's--It's Not Fair.

1618
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:24,998
Hmm.

1619
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:29,935
What's Not Fair?

1620
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:33,006
Everything!

1621
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:34,574
Ever Since
I Was A Little Boy,

1622
01:13:34,606 --> 01:13:36,810
All I Wanted To Be
Was A Meteorologist.

1623
01:13:36,842 --> 01:13:38,410
While Other Kids
Were Playing With Toys,

1624
01:13:38,444 --> 01:13:41,414
I...I Was Busy Playing
With Thermometers.

1625
01:13:41,446 --> 01:13:44,583
They'd Look
At The Clouds
And See Ponies

1626
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:47,186
And Ice-Cream Cones.

1627
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:49,990
All I Could See
Were Condensed Forms
Of Atmospheric Moisture!

1628
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:52,725
(Sobbing)

1629
01:13:56,596 --> 01:13:58,330
Oh, Mr. Martino
Was Right.

1630
01:13:59,899 --> 01:14:01,500
I'm A Failure.

1631
01:14:01,534 --> 01:14:04,170
Oh, Edwin.

1632
01:14:04,203 --> 01:14:06,106
Edwin,
You're Not A Failure.

1633
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,544
What You Need
Is A New Challenge,

1634
01:14:11,576 --> 01:14:15,280
A Place Where The Weather
Is Exciting,

1635
01:14:15,314 --> 01:14:18,084
A Place Where You Can
Share Your Knowledge

1636
01:14:18,116 --> 01:14:22,254
With People Who Have
The Same Passions
That You Do, Hmm?

1637
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:24,591
But Where?
If I Could Go
To Such A Place--

1638
01:14:24,624 --> 01:14:26,159
I'll See
What I Can Do.

1639
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,327
Really?

1640
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,595
Yes.

1641
01:14:29,628 --> 01:14:32,531
But If And Only If

1642
01:14:32,565 --> 01:14:36,236
You Promise To Be Good
From Now On.

1643
01:14:36,268 --> 01:14:38,570
No More Lying, Cheating,
Or Stealing.

1644
01:14:38,603 --> 01:14:40,240
Oh, And, Um...

1645
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:42,609
Nothing About
Our Little Adventure.

1646
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:44,411
Do I Have Your Word?

1647
01:14:45,343 --> 01:14:47,079
As A Gentleman.

1648
01:14:47,113 --> 01:14:48,548
And More Importantly,
As A Meteorologist.

1649
01:14:49,414 --> 01:14:51,250
But How?

1650
01:14:51,284 --> 01:14:52,552
You'll See, Edwin.

1651
01:14:52,584 --> 01:14:54,953
You'll See.

1652
01:14:54,986 --> 01:14:57,022
Sparky: We're Ready, Santa!

1653
01:14:57,056 --> 01:15:00,259
Good! Good!
Well, Let's Get Moving, Hmm?

1654
01:15:00,293 --> 01:15:02,061
Christmas Is Upon Us!

1655
01:15:02,093 --> 01:15:03,128
(Laughs)

1656
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:05,932
But First Things First.

1657
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:07,167
We Have To Get You Two Home.

1658
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:10,235
Um...

1659
01:15:10,268 --> 01:15:12,372
Santa, I Kind Of
Have A Little
Favor To Ask.

1660
01:15:12,405 --> 01:15:13,940
(Whispers)

1661
01:15:37,228 --> 01:15:39,031
Merry Christmas.

1662
01:15:39,065 --> 01:15:40,165
Merry Christmas,
Mom.

1663
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:41,301
Merry Christmas.

1664
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,601
Thanks, Joey.

1665
01:15:45,271 --> 01:15:47,941
Now, Allie, I Want
To Tell You Straight Up.

1666
01:15:47,973 --> 01:15:51,209
I'm So Sorry.
I Know It's Been
A Yucky Christmas,

1667
01:15:51,243 --> 01:15:53,946
But There Is No Big Present
For You Under That Tree,

1668
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,115
And I Know You
Wanted The Rollerblades,

1669
01:15:56,147 --> 01:15:58,016
And I Tried.
I Really Did.

1670
01:15:58,049 --> 01:16:00,485
But With The Storm,
There Was Just No Way.

1671
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:02,088
It's Ok, Mom.

1672
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,289
I'm Really Sorry, Honey.

1673
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:07,192
To Tell You The Truth,
I Forgot All About Them.

1674
01:16:09,561 --> 01:16:11,229
Well, There
Is Good News.

1675
01:16:11,262 --> 01:16:13,598
With All My
Cancelled Parties,

1676
01:16:13,632 --> 01:16:17,036
We Are Gonna
Be Having
Turkey Sandwiches

1677
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:18,437
For The Next
5 Years.

1678
01:16:18,471 --> 01:16:19,506
(Laughs)

1679
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,743
Mom?

1680
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:26,545
Let's Not Open Anything
Until Dad Gets Home.

1681
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:28,414
Yeah. We Should Wait.

1682
01:16:28,446 --> 01:16:30,182
Are You Sure?

1683
01:16:30,216 --> 01:16:32,384
'Cause It Might
Be A While.

1684
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:34,687
I Mean, The Airport's
Just Reopened.

1685
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,089
The Roads, Some Of Them
Are Still Closed,

1686
01:16:37,123 --> 01:16:38,391
So, I Mean,
There's A Good Chance

1687
01:16:38,423 --> 01:16:41,293
That He Might Not Even
Make It Back Today.

1688
01:16:41,326 --> 01:16:43,762
Well, We'll Just Wait
Until He Does.

1689
01:16:43,795 --> 01:16:45,164
Joey: Yeah.

1690
01:16:46,332 --> 01:16:47,499
Ok.

1691
01:16:58,043 --> 01:17:02,114
Santa: Your Gift Should
Arrive Right About...

1692
01:17:02,147 --> 01:17:03,615
(Car Horn Honking)

1693
01:17:08,454 --> 01:17:11,324
Hey, Everybody!
Allie! Joey!

1694
01:17:11,356 --> 01:17:13,091
It's Dad!

1695
01:17:13,124 --> 01:17:15,427
Hey! Kids, I'm Home!

1696
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:17,295
Dad!

1697
01:17:17,329 --> 01:17:19,532
Dad, You're Home!

1698
01:17:19,565 --> 01:17:21,101
Hey! Whoa!

1699
01:17:23,235 --> 01:17:25,204
Merry Christmas,
Buddy!

1700
01:17:25,236 --> 01:17:27,339
How Did You Manage
To Get A Ride In That?

1701
01:17:27,373 --> 01:17:30,109
Oh, Well, The Flights
Were All Booked Up,

1702
01:17:30,142 --> 01:17:32,078
And I Was In
This Never-Ending Line
For A Rental Car,

1703
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:35,547
When I Met
These Two Guys Who Said
They Were Going My Way.

1704
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,115
Hey, Thanks, Guys.

1705
01:17:37,149 --> 01:17:38,551
Merry Christmas!

1706
01:17:42,353 --> 01:17:44,323
They Have
The Strangest Names.

1707
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:46,092
Sparket And Crumpy.

1708
01:17:47,392 --> 01:17:49,561
Sparky And Crumpet.

1709
01:17:49,594 --> 01:17:51,297
How Did You Know That?

1710
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:53,365
It's Kind Of A Long Story.

1711
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:54,433
Oh!

1712
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:57,404
This Has Your Name
On It.

1713
01:18:02,842 --> 01:18:04,444
Oh, Honey!

1714
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:06,278
Oh, I Don't Believe It!
How Did You--

1715
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:08,113
I Thought It Was
Pretty Appropriate,

1716
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:10,415
Considering.
You Know, Even
With The Blizzard

1717
01:18:10,449 --> 01:18:11,784
I Would Have Found
A Way To Get Here,

1718
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:13,418
One Way Or Another.

1719
01:18:13,451 --> 01:18:14,587
I Love You So Much.

1720
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:16,855
I Love You, Too.

1721
01:18:16,888 --> 01:18:19,357
In Fact, I Love
All Of You So Much,

1722
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:22,527
And Being Here Is...

1723
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:24,831
I Don't Know,
It's...

1724
01:18:24,864 --> 01:18:27,799
The Ultimate
Christmas Present?

1725
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,136
That's Exactly Right,
Allie.

1726
01:18:30,168 --> 01:18:32,271
It's The Ultimate
Christmas Present.

1727
01:18:37,842 --> 01:18:39,478
Thank You, Santa.

1728
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,116
(Santa Chuckles)

1729
01:18:43,149 --> 01:18:44,817
You're Welcome, Allie.

1730
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:49,221
Samantha: Allie!

1731
01:18:49,254 --> 01:18:51,091
Mrs. Kwan:
Merry Christmas!

1732
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:12,512
(Shrieks)

1733
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:18,718
Good Morning, Class,

1734
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,418
And Welcome
To The South Pole!

1735
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:22,187
Campus To
The Edwin Hadley

1736
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:23,489
Meteorological
Institute.

1737
01:19:23,521 --> 01:19:24,890
In The Next 6 Months,

1738
01:19:24,923 --> 01:19:27,426
You'll Be Learning
Everything

1739
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,394
From Tracking
Storm Clouds

1740
01:19:29,427 --> 01:19:31,663
To Measuring
Levels Of Precipitation

1741
01:19:31,696 --> 01:19:33,900
To Assessing
Ozone Layers.

1742
01:19:33,932 --> 01:19:37,203
This Class
Will Be Technical.

1743
01:19:37,235 --> 01:19:39,372
This Class
