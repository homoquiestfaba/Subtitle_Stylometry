00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:27,125
(Applause)

2
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:28,282
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Governor,

3
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:29,442
are you
prepared to take

4
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:30,443
the Constitutional
Oath?

5
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:31,556
RONALD REAGAN:
I am.

6
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:33,040
Place your left hand
on the Bible

7
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,078
and raise your right hand
and repeat after me:

8
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:37,323
I, Ronald Reagan,
do solemnly swear...

9
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:40,120
I, Ronald Reagan,
do solemnly swear...

10
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:42,522
That I will faithfully
execute the office

11
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:44,444
of President of the United States...

12
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,364
That I will faithfully execute the office

13
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:48,239
of President of the United States...

14
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,323
And will, to the best of my ability...

15
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:52,517
And will, to the best of my ability...

16
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:55,115
Preserve, protect, and defend...

17
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:58,125
Preserve, protect, and defend...

18
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:00,078
The Constitution of the United States...

19
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:01,925
The Constitution of the United States...

20
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:03,162
So help you God.

21
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:04,879
So help me God.

22
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:06,725
NARRATOR: January 20, 1981...

23
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:08,326
Ronald Reagan is sworn in

24
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:11,996
as the 40th President of the United States.

25
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:13,526
February, 1981.

26
00:01:13,647 --> 00:01:16,002
Living up to his reputation
as a cold warrior,

27
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,960
the new President shows little interest

28
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,521
in continuing the policy of detente.

29
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,239
He cites the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan

30
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,085
and Moscow's sponsorship
of communist rebels

31
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:28,438
in Central America
as deterrents to any talks

32
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,797
with Soviet leader Brezhnev.

33
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:32,963
Instead, Reagan calls for
a dramatic and costly build-up

34
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:36,443
of U.S. Military power.

35
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,165
March, 1981.

36
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,881
Soviet leader Brezhnev
begins to amass Russian troops

37
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:43,726
along the Polish border
in preparation for an invasion

38
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:46,281
to suppress the labour movement,
Solidarity.

39
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:49,756
Many now fear a showdown

40
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,366
between the superpowers.

41
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:05,845
JAMES BAKER: If intervention occurs,

42
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:06,843
we anticipate it happening

43
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,844
within the next
24 hours.

44
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,002
ALEXANDER HAIG:
The Soviets

45
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:11,116
intend to invade.

46
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:12,316
Let's call it
what it is, Jim.

47
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:13,675
Well, if it's a matter
of semantics...

48
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,479
When the President
faces the press

49
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:18,075
and they want to know
how we're going to react,

50
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:20,323
it has to be stated
unequivocally

51
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,041
as an invasion.

52
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:26,364
In order to heighten
or decrease tensions, Al?

53
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:29,960
You are trying

54
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:34,160
to qualify an aggressive
military action.

55
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,245
I've had experience with
these things, gentlemen.

56
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,278
I know what they're like.

57
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:43,286
CarefuI, guys.

58
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:46,046
Last time Poland was invaded,
a world war erupted.

59
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,276
HAIG: Moscow's been warned,
Mr President.

60
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:53,125
We have to know
how to respond.

61
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:01,805
I'm all ears.

62
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,645
WEINBERGER: Dobrynin
is anxious for us

63
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,961
to lift the grain embargo.

64
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:06,236
We've already agreed
in principle, but we could...

65
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,278
Have you been talking
to Dobrynin?

66
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:11,763
I met him at a party, Al.

67
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:16,081
What does our
CIA Director say?

68
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,124
Well...

69
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:21,203
Russian bear
is a tricky beast.

70
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,399
PlayfuI like a cub,
but deceptively ursine.

71
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:27,963
Therefore, it's imperative
that we proceed

72
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,156
with aggressive caution...

73
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:30,720
less like a bear
than an eagle,

74
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:33,759
but with an eagle's eye
towards retreat...

75
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:35,843
if called for...
under the circumstances.

76
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,195
I didn't catch that.

77
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:39,602
Did anyone catch that?

78
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,126
He's unintelligible, sir.

79
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,718
Eh?

80
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,956
Can't hear, either.

81
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:50,963
HAIG:
Can't hear, can't talk...

82
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,156
(Chuckles)

83
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:54,960
The perfect CIA Director.

84
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:56,281
REAGAN:
The Soviets consider Poland

85
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,001
within their sphere
of influence...

86
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:03,047
And they'll go to war
to keep it that way.

87
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,964
What they're
wondering is,

88
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,725
will we go to war
to stop them?

89
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,565
Well...

90
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:11,838
I say let's keep them
wondering.

91
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,923
(Sniffing)

92
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,964
Any new employees
on this list?

93
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:21,076
No.

94
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:22,845
They all have to have
badges.

95
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:25,083
Without badges,
they don't work the room.

96
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:27,323
OK.

97
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:28,562
Yeah, it's OK.

98
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,121
AGENT, OVER RADIO:
Got it.

99
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:40,563
(lndistinct radio chatter)

100
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:42,723
(Sniffing)

101
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,957
Dear Jodie...

102
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,162
There's a definite possibility
that I will be killed

103
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:07,845
in my attempt to get Reagan.

104
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,958
It is for this very reason

105
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:11,998
that I'm writing you
this letter now.

106
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:13,606
As you well know,

107
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:16,560
I love you very much.

108
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:17,836
The past 7 months

109
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:20,527
I have left you dozens
of poems, letters, and...

110
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,797
messages... in the faint hope

111
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:25,646
that you might develop
an interest in me.

112
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:30,795
Jodie, I am asking you to
please look into your heart

113
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:32,599
and at least give me
the chance

114
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:34,001
with this historical deed

115
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,641
to gain your respect...

116
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:39,156
and love.

117
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:42,040
I love you forever.

118
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,476
John Hinckley.

119
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,799
Everyone here
except Rawhide?

120
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,556
Dusty to Daylight,
the package is ready.

121
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:06,962
Nearing 1400.
Let's pull out.

122
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,725
AGENT, OVER RADIO:
Copy that.

123
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,519
They're still meeting.

124
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,046
HAIG:
Mr President...

125
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,875
I have prepared
a foreign policy white paper

126
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,965
taking into account
the new budgetary constraints.

127
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,806
Well, that's, uh...
a lot of white paper.

128
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,201
2,000 pages, sir.

129
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:24,716
I've tried to meet
Mr Stockman's

130
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,202
$2.6 billion worth
of proposed cuts

131
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,999
without cutting any aid

132
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:31,038
to our friends
in Central America.

133
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,964
I have also
included a chapter

134
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:34,406
on why El Salvador

135
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,916
is a guerrilla war
that we can win.

136
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:40,005
Aah. Have you got
anything shorter?

137
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,756
Yes, I have a 20-page outline
that we've been working from.

138
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:46,196
Let me tell you something,
fellas...

139
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,397
Most of you are new here...

140
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,279
Heck, I'm new here.

141
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:53,080
We're just getting to know
each other's work habits.

142
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:54,162
For instance,

143
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:55,800
my predecessor's
habits included

144
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,883
keeping track of who used
the tennis court out there.

145
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,156
(All chuckling)

146
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:00,959
But me, I'm
a big-picture guy.

147
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,440
You're my detail men.

148
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:06,003
I don't need details.
Just give me the essence of it.

149
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:09,961
Can you summarize this
in one or two pages?

150
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,043
One or two?

151
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:16,116
One.

152
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:24,960
REAGAN: We've got to avoid
these moves and countermoves.

153
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:25,997
Think long-term.

154
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,719
They can't keep up
with us.

155
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,838
The Soviet Union's
a house of cards.

156
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,639
HAIG:
Mr President...

157
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,758
Could we speak a moment

158
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,957
about this
crisis control issue?

159
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:36,963
Sure, Al...

160
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,281
Al, really,
we've got to go.

161
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:40,125
Are you going to stand by
your appointment

162
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,282
of the Vice President?

163
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:43,284
This directly affects
my position

164
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:44,681
as Secretary of State,

165
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:46,877
and I really need
a clarification, sir.

166
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,326
It's been very difficult

167
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,403
getting an appointment
to see you.

168
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,325
Was it?
Why is that?

169
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,597
I think that
the State Department

170
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,685
is best able to deal
with crisis situations.

171
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:01,116
Well, Vice President Bush
is going to handle it.

172
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:05,160
I think that's a departure
from precedent, sir.

173
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:07,323
I believe,
with all due respect,

174
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:10,598
that the Vice President's
staff is too small

175
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:12,319
to handle
the complex tasks...

176
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:14,244
Al, this has nothing
to do with you.

177
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:17,047
I have complete confidence
in your ability.

178
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,123
But George Bush
is a very able man.

179
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:21,761
I promised him he'd be
an active Vice President.

180
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:24,003
Now, the man has got to
have something to do.

181
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:25,401
(Chuckles)

182
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,199
You're my foreign
policy guy.

183
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:35,676
Mr Deaver,
the card?

184
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,081
Oh, right.

185
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:39,721
The key card, sir, with
the authorization code.

186
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:40,836
Mm. Mm.

187
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,725
You need to select
a number group

188
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:53,723
for today, sir.

189
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:54,916
Oh, right.

190
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:00,278
How's that?
Very good.

191
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:04,165
You keep the card,
sir, as usual.

192
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:05,322
Without it,

193
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:06,800
the launch codes
can't be activated.

194
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,360
We've got to go, sir.

195
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,324
Jodie...

196
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:29,085
this letter is being written

197
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:32,040
an hour before I leave
for the Hilton Hotel.

198
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:35,125
I would abandon this idea
of getting Reagan in a second

199
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,726
if I could only win your heart

200
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,917
and live out
the rest of my life with you,

201
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:41,607
whether it be
in total obscurity or whatever.

202
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,126
I will admit to you

203
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:45,044
that the reason I'm going ahead
with this attempt now

204
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,159
is because I just cannot wait
any longer to impress you.

205
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,766
I've got to do something now

206
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,765
to make you understand,
in no uncertain terms,

207
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:55,765
that I am doing all this
for your sake.

208
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,323
By sacrificing my freedom,
and possibly my life,

209
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,120
I hope to change your mind
about me.

210
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,078
Didn't go well?

211
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,923
The magazines
arrived.

212
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,845
"Taking command."

213
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,036
Bullshit!

214
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,919
I can't get a meeting
with the President.

215
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,844
I can't get him on the phone.

216
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:50,880
Only time I ever see him is with
that goddamn Troika present.

217
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,326
These guys were with him
in California...

218
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:53,721
(Angry growl)

219
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,766
I'm being undermined
by wienies.

220
00:10:57,887 --> 00:11:00,720
Second-rate hambones.

221
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:02,599
(Sighs)

222
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,840
I want you to redraft
that resignation letter.

223
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,036
You can't resign

224
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:11,078
on the eve of
a Soviet invasion.

225
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:17,318
Pat says I've become more
irritable and short-tempered

226
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,122
since the triple bypass.

227
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,839
What do you think?

228
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:25,926
Well, before the surgery,

229
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:28,436
you weren't exactly
a pussycat, either.

230
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,482
(Laughs)

231
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:40,797
You keep me in line, Buddy.

232
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,323
You keep me on
the straight and narrow.

233
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:45,482
I will.

234
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,045
(lndistinct radio chatter)

235
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,435
AGENT, ON RADIO:
Do we have an I.D.

236
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,886
On that green jacket?

237
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,156
Drawbridge, this is Stagecoach.

238
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,243
We are about to turn
onto T street. Over.

239
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,039
Got that, Stagecoach. Over.

240
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,044
How we doing in the sky?

241
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,006
COUNTER-SNIPER:
"One clear.

242
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:13,879
SNIPER 2:
2 clear.

243
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,200
Rawhide's coming.

244
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:36,235
Mr President!

245
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,482
(People talking at once)

246
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,563
How are you?

247
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,323
(Heart pounding)

248
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:50,404
(Voices distorted)

249
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,318
(Faint click)

250
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:24,437
MAN: You're doing
a great job.

251
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:25,886
Break it up.

252
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:26,883
I voted for you, sir.

253
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,884
Back off.

254
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,042
Nice to meet you.

255
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,395
What are you going
to do about Poland?

256
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:32,926
Good luck
in there.

257
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:35,766
MAN: Mr President, what about
the Polish situation?

258
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:37,684
Yes!

259
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:39,684
REAGAN:
You lay out the baby's diaper

260
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:41,160
like a baseball diamond.

261
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,482
You put the baby's bottom
on the pitcher's mound.

262
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,325
You hook up first and third

263
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,722
and then you slide home
underneath.

264
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:49,246
(Soft laughter)

265
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,835
And if it starts to rain,
the game ain't called.

266
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,195
You just start
all over again.

267
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:54,316
(Laughter)

268
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,280
That dumb joke
works every time.

269
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:00,435
So, uh, I'm going to try

270
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,286
to communicate
a little bit today.

271
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:06,444
I hope you'll forgive me
if I point with some pride

272
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:09,035
to the fact that
I'm the first President

273
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,203
of the United States...

274
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:12,760
to hold a lifetime
membership

275
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,640
in an AFL-CIO union.

276
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,166
Sir, no one's allowed
inside without a pass.

277
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:18,402
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:19,846
Excuse me.

279
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:32,160
(Door creaks)

280
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,964
You're not supposed
to be in here, kid.

281
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,315
This floor's off-limits.

282
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,043
I am not a kid.

283
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:54,037
The Polish workers
stand as sentinels

284
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,635
on behalf of
universal human principles

285
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,043
and they remind us
that on this good earth,

286
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,203
the people

287
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:04,795
will always prevail.

288
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,206
He's almost done
with his speech.

289
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,885
Is Stagecoach
turned around?

290
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,235
AGENT, ON RADIO:
Roger that.

291
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,843
Now, I know
that we can't

292
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,117
make things
right overnight.

293
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,602
So I'm asking you,
as I ask all Americans

294
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:23,719
during these
months of decision,

295
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:27,078
please, follow me
on this new path.

296
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,276
You and your forebears
built this nation...

297
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:29,635
Stagecoach is ready.

298
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,041
Please help
us rebuild it,

299
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,806
and together we'll make
America great again.

300
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:35,360
Stagecoach
is ready, sir.

301
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:37,239
Thank you very,
very much.

302
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:38,243
Thank you.

303
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:48,322
Mr President.

304
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,085
Not now, Jim.

305
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:51,606
The moment's
got to be right.

306
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:53,843
Exits are important.

307
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,160
OK.

308
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,280
Rawhide's coming out.

309
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,038
(Reporters shouting questions)

310
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,964
(Heart pounding)

311
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,242
(Gunshots)

312
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,243
Don't shoot him!

313
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,961
(Screaming and yelling)

314
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:25,563
Get down!

315
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,643
Get down!

316
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:28,916
Take off, take off!

317
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:32,246
Don't move!

318
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:36,877
Ooh...

319
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:40,238
Son of a bitch,
you broke my ribs.

320
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

321
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,567
(Tyres screeching)

322
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:10,681
You haven't
been hit, have you?

323
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,923
(Grunts)

324
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,844
(Coughing)

325
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,606
Jesus, what the hell?

326
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:30,001
The way you
shoved me down...

327
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,243
felt like a hammer
hit me in the ribs.

328
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:35,405
It's blood.
It's bubbly.

329
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:37,040
Halfback, halfback...

330
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,282
Rawhide is spitting blood.

331
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,477
He cracked a rib
when I threw him in the car.

332
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,722
He may have a punctured lung.

333
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:43,041
EMERY:
We're nearing Crown.

334
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,316
I'll call ahead to get them
ready check him out.

335
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,675
We should go
to the hospital.

336
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:46,876
We're almost home.

337
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,076
I can't breathe.

338
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:49,925
We're going to
George Washington.

339
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:50,877
Change course fast.

340
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:51,883
We're going to G.W.

341
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,326
Yes, sir.

342
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,960
(Tyres screeching)

343
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,282
(Horn honking)

344
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,720
Somebody get
a stretcher!

345
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:26,280
No.

346
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:27,806
No.

347
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:31,084
Back up a little bit.

348
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,196
Here we go.

349
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,079
Right through here.

350
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:51,882
Don't move!

351
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,122
Back off!

352
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:54,839
Move, back off, get back!

353
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,083
U.S. Secret Service.

354
00:18:57,207 --> 00:18:58,083
This way.

355
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:01,085
Everyone stay back.
Stay back.

356
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:07,205
Everybody stay calm.

357
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,124
(Clears throat)

358
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,078
I'm fine.

359
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:18,765
Is that who
I think it is?

360
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,081
Take him into
the code room!

361
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,885
What's that, sir?

362
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,679
Did you get him?

363
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:26,206
The shooter?
Yeah, yeah, we got him.

364
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:29,876
Find out what his beef is.

365
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,326
(Coughing)

366
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:32,926
NURSE: 5-A

367
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,116
5-A, this way!

368
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:35,760
This way.

369
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:38,765
I can't breathe.

370
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,081
This way.

371
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:43,199
(Gasping for air)

372
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:45,158
Get him in here,
get him in here.

373
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,198
Up here.

374
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,999
OK, all right.

375
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:50,037
Get his coat.

376
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,080
OK. Lie him down.

377
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,002
(Choking)

378
00:19:58,127 --> 00:19:59,242
I can't breathe.

379
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,243
OK, get some oxygen on him,

380
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,686
and get a call out

381
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,035
to Ben Allard, fast!

382
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:07,080
OK, what's the deal?
Did he have a heart attack?

383
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,879
He's in acute distress.

384
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,237
How's the
blood pressure?

385
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,281
Damn, if it ain't
Ronald McDonald.

386
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:17,317
Get him out.

387
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:20,875
Let me see
your Uzi, man.

388
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:22,156
That's right,
wheel the nigger out.

389
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,686
There's some violent
streets out there...

390
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,162
What y'all motherfuckers
gonna do about that?

391
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,997
Kirkus, FBI. I need
to know who's in here.

392
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:31,116
Treasury's in control.

393
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:32,157
You guys haven't
done enough today?

394
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:33,163
Fuck off.

395
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:34,242
I can't hear.

396
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,243
There's too many people
in here.

397
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,516
Can we have some quiet?

398
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:37,636
I can't get
any systolic pressure.

399
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:38,677
OK, give me some blood.

400
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:40,684
CBC, chem-7,
portable chest, stat.

401
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:41,683
Ben!

402
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,001
Any idea what's up?

403
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,118
I heard there were people
with guns down here.

404
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:47,886
P. A:
Dr Allard to emergency, stat.

405
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:49,884
Rawhide's fine.
He just hurt his ribs.

406
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,721
EMERY: Reagan.
R-e-a-g-a-n.

407
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,758
First name Ronald.

408
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,764
Address?

409
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,639
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

410
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:00,597
Hey.

411
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:01,603
Who are these guys?

412
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,603
Let them through.

413
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:03,762
Drs Allard
and Gregorio.

414
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,842
Go ahead. Insured?

415
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,002
Yes.

416
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:08,163
If you have
any further questions,

417
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:10,596
you can direct them
to Mr Deaver.

418
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,638
GREGORIO:
Doesn't anybody call ahead

419
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,644
when it's the President?

420
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,120
Mr Reagan,
where do you hurt?

421
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,123
I can't breathe.

422
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,279
What happened?

423
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:20,522
There was a shooting.

424
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:21,875
The President wasn't hit,

425
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:24,202
but I had to throw him
in the limousine,

426
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:26,124
and I think he cracked a rib.

427
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,283
He started to cough up blood.

428
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,557
He wanted me to bring him
to the White House,

429
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:31,915
but I figured it was better
to bring him here.

430
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:32,957
He'd be dead by now
if you hadn't.

431
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:34,236
I knew he was hurt bad,

432
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,766
but he wouldn't let
anybody help him.

433
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,161
I've never seen
anything like it.

434
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,483
STEIN:
Turn on the television.

435
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:52,359
An unidentified
would-be assassin

436
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:53,806
has taken shots
at President Reagan

437
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:57,044
as he left the
Washington Hilton Hotel

438
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,759
just minutes ago.

439
00:21:58,887 --> 00:21:59,876
The White House says

440
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:01,918
the President
has not been hit.

441
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:04,163
I repeat,
he has not been hit.

442
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,403
3 shots, possibly
more, were fired.

443
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:08,961
3 persons were wounded.
Among them...

444
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:10,440
Get Baker on the phone.

445
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:11,841
He's on his way
to the hospital.

446
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:12,956
Where's the Vice President?

447
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:14,281
I'm trying
to find that out.

448
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:15,965
What do we know
about the assailant?

449
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:16,997
I don't know.

450
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,276
Well, get on with it.

451
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:19,840
(Sighs)

452
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,798
...when the shots
were fired.

453
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,360
Again, we repeat...

454
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,478
shots were fired
at the President.

455
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:28,440
However,
he has escaped injury.

456
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,125
I'm not getting
any pulse.

457
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:31,362
Acute coronary thrombosis?

458
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:33,478
There are way too many
people in here, folks.

459
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:35,757
Clear the room.

460
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:36,922
FBI investigation...

461
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:38,719
Whoa, whoa!
Knock it off!

462
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:39,802
Blood pressure
double zero.

463
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,679
No pulse.
He's going into shock.

464
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:43,798
All right,
roll him over.

465
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:44,803
You see anything?

466
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,805
Nothing, nothing.

467
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:48,803
Other side.

468
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:56,836
Bring him back.

469
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,878
Wait, wait, wait.

470
00:22:59,007 --> 00:23:00,963
All right,
I found a bullet hole.

471
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:01,963
He's been shot.

472
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:03,202
Went in under his arm.

473
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:04,760
I don't see an exit wound.

474
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:05,956
The x-rays, Doctor.

475
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:12,962
There it is.

476
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,361
Is that a fragment
or the whole thing?

477
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:15,363
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

478
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:16,636
Give us a report, Doctor.

479
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:17,961
He's got
a collapsed lung.

480
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:19,759
We got a hem thorax.
We gotta get a chest tube.

481
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,161
We need a chest tube
in here!

482
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:22,606
Pulse strengthening at 78.

483
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:24,126
Anybody know the calibre
of the bullets?

484
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:25,396
Yeah, I'll check. Hold on.

485
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:26,926
I need to know the calibre.

486
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:29,763
We can't give that out.

487
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:30,876
The doctors
have to know.

488
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:32,281
It's part of
the investigation.

489
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:33,806
This is the President!

490
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:36,077
We got to know now!

491
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,356
Right now!
Come on.

492
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:40,400
It's a.38.

493
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:42,165
That's bullshit.
I was there.

494
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,845
It was a.22
short barrel.

495
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,195
"A.38's a lot bigger
than this slug.

496
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:46,680
Unless it broke up inside him,

497
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:48,206
in which case
we got much bigger problems.

498
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,646
Chest tube ready?

499
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:50,643
Xylocaine?

500
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,643
All set.

501
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,638
Who are you, sir?

502
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:57,756
I'm Mike Deaver,

503
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:58,763
White House Deputy
Chief of Staff.

504
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:00,684
And I need to know
the truth.

505
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,843
There's a bullet
right next to

506
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:04,685
or possibly in
the President's heart.

507
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:05,876
We stand a good chance
of losing him

508
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:06,996
if we don't
stop the bleeding.

509
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:08,355
Now, do I have your
authorization

510
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:09,840
to do whatever
is necessary?

511
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:11,923
Measures could be drastic
to save his life.

512
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:16,120
Uh, yes, yeah,
do what you have to.

513
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:37,126
My God, he's going to die.

514
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:44,726
Where's Ronnie?

515
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:46,565
He was hit, Nancy.

516
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:47,642
But you said
he was OK.

517
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,156
The doctors
just confirmed it.

518
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:52,721
He has a bullet
in his chest.

519
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,200
Where is he?

520
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,557
I have to see him.

521
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,642
Is that Jim Brady?

522
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:12,565
Oh, my God.

523
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:17,876
Look at him.

524
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:20,567
Look what they've
done to him.

525
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,803
I'm sorry.

526
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:24,758
(Sobbing)

527
00:25:24,887 --> 00:25:26,764
They're working
on him.

528
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:28,605
I want to see him.

529
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,762
No, not yet, Nancy.
Please.

530
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:31,286
The doctors
are in there.

531
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:33,557
Mike, they don't know
how it is with us.

532
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:34,836
He has to know I'm here.

533
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,161
I'll make sure
he does.

534
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:37,959
And as soon as they
have him cleaned up

535
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,884
and stabilized,
you can see him.

536
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:41,759
Jim, we have to
soft-pedal this.

537
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:43,639
The children need
to hear it from me.

538
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:44,882
I know, I know.

539
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:46,565
And tell Don Regan

540
00:25:46,687 --> 00:25:49,076
this is the first President
shot since Kennedy,

541
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:51,004
and it's on his watch.

542
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:54,282
Mrs Reagan?

543
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:55,965
We've got a room
you can wait in.

544
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,202
It's this way.

545
00:26:01,087 --> 00:26:03,760
I understand that there
were some agents hurt also.

546
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:04,763
Yes, ma'am.

547
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:06,639
Agent McCarthy
took a bullet,

548
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,120
and a police officer
as well.

549
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,522
Would you let me know
how they're doing?

550
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:13,161
And make sure their
families can see them.

551
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:14,720
Yes, ma'am.

552
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:19,006
This way,
Mrs Reagan.

553
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,441
Mike...

554
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,159
the press is breathing
down our neck.

555
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:24,720
We've got to get
a statement out.

556
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:26,758
Well, there's nobody
at the White House.

557
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,605
George Bush left
for Texas this morning.

558
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:30,604
Tell 'em we're running
things from here.

559
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:32,683
I'll call Al Haig
and have him inform the Cabinet.

560
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:33,637
Is Speakes over there?

561
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:34,643
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

562
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:35,756
Larry can handle press.

563
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,240
Dave Gergen's
over there, too.

564
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:39,562
Well, fine, but everything
is through me.

565
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:40,756
I'm nearest
to the President.

566
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:43,447
You go out and handle
the press out there.

567
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,523
And, uh, keep it brief
but positive.

568
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:46,762
Absolutely.

569
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,923
The President
was wounded slightly

570
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:52,878
during the attack, but he's all right.

571
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:54,565
The President is doing just fine.

572
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:55,756
REPORTER: Earlier we were told

573
00:26:55,887 --> 00:26:57,479
that he had emerged unscathed and unhurt.

574
00:26:57,607 --> 00:26:58,801
Now we hear that
he's been struck.

575
00:26:58,927 --> 00:26:59,916
What is the real
story here?

576
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:00,957
They both are, Sam.

577
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:02,282
Now, come on.

578
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:03,442
It's what we thought
at the time.

579
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,000
You're just gonna
have to wait

580
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:06,355
until further
reports come up.

581
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:08,045
The President
is doing fine.

582
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,805
It's Baker from the hospital.

583
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:11,406
You don't know if he's
conscious? What's going on?

584
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:13,404
I can only say so much. I'm sorry.

585
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:15,040
REPORTER: Is the President
in surgery now?

586
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,043
The President is stable.

587
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,043
I don't know
at this point...

588
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,043
Jim...

589
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,077
Al, it's serious.

590
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:20,686
The bullet is next
to the aorta,

591
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,001
and the doctors
are concerned

592
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,355
he may bleed to death.

593
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:25,955
HAIG: I'm watching
Nofziger on television.

594
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:28,282
We've got to be carefuI
about these reports.

595
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:30,363
We need an accurate
information base.

596
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:33,001
There are worldwide
repercussions here.

597
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:34,037
I understand.

598
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,043
This is how
conspiracy theories

599
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,077
take hold.

600
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:37,925
I don't want
another Dallas.

601
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,719
Has the Vice President
been informed?

602
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,121
Yeah, Peter Teeley
got a hold of him.

603
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:42,362
He was about to fly
to Austin from Fort Worth.

604
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:43,886
HAIG: Is he coming back?

605
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:44,917
No.

606
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,162
Why not?

607
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:47,640
Because when they spoke,
the reports were

608
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:48,756
the President was OK,

609
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:50,206
so Bush decided to proceed

610
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:51,601
with his schedule.

611
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:53,365
He's probably airborne
by now.

612
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:55,125
We've got to get him back
here as soon as possible.

613
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:56,600
In the meantime,

614
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:58,683
somebody's got to handle
Crisis Control.

615
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:04,275
Jim...

616
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:06,045
You worked real hard

617
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,885
to have this taken out
of my hands

618
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:10,601
and turned over
to the Vice President.

619
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:12,957
Now you can't get him
back to Washington.

620
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:14,315
I'll handle this.

621
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:17,405
Can you hold on
a second, General?

622
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:18,926
He wants to know

623
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,878
who's going to run
Crisis Control.

624
00:28:21,007 --> 00:28:22,281
Can't we run it from here?

625
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:23,362
It has to be

626
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:24,806
a senior Cabinet Officer.

627
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:26,724
It has to be
from the White House.

628
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:27,916
Our information's limited here.

629
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:30,800
You want that lunatic
running this thing?

630
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:32,042
HAIG: Jim!

631
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,876
I'm senior Cabinet Officer.

632
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,156
I'll handle this.

633
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:38,197
Very well.

634
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:39,680
Give me the phone.

635
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:41,001
I'll get over
to the White House.

636
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:42,196
I'll set up a command centre
in the Situation Room.

637
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,282
I'll coordinate the Cabinet.

638
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:44,635
You be my point man
at the hospital.

639
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,564
I don't want have to
talk to anybody else.

640
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:49,201
When you get set up there,
you let me know.

641
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,124
Mr President, there's a bullet
right next to your heart.

642
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:52,521
We're going to open
your chest,

643
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,922
get that bullet out,
and fix you up.

644
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:56,799
Sounds good to me.

645
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:58,280
Let's get on with it.

646
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:03,917
Does Nancy know about us?

647
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,236
Honey, what did they do?

648
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,835
What did they do?

649
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:12,039
Honey, I forgot to duck.

650
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,919
I brought you jelly beans,
darling.

651
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:15,526
I need to speak
with you.

652
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:16,841
CarefuI, Mrs Reagan.

653
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,559
Are your people
going up?

654
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:21,281
We have to be at his side
at all times.

655
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:23,284
Your husband has lost
an incredible amount of blood.

656
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:24,601
There's a bullet
in his chest.

657
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:26,046
We have to stop
the bleeding.

658
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,680
Now, surgery could be anywhere
between 2 and 5 hours

659
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,637
depending on complications.

660
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,643
Now, I must tell you,

661
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:31,161
it's very serious.

662
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:32,925
He may die.

663
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:36,925
Do your best, Doctor.

664
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:38,116
Save him.

665
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:39,282
Please, Doctor.

666
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,123
You know, Ben,
I was thinking

667
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,238
maybe we should get
Keller up here.

668
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:53,277
What?

669
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:54,760
I shouldn't be
in there.

670
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:55,922
I'm a liberal.

671
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:57,878
I never even voted
for the man.

672
00:29:58,007 --> 00:29:59,122
What are you
talking about?

673
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:00,646
It's just another
operation, Joe.

674
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:01,995
You can't think of him
as the President.

675
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:03,196
Oh, sure, I mean,

676
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:04,760
the fact that
the entire world

677
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,320
is waiting with
bated breath.

678
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:07,766
Do you know your history?

679
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:10,242
History? You think
this is a good time?

680
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,686
Listen to me.

681
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:14,685
Garfield and McKinley
were shot by assassins,

682
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:18,243
but they were killed
by their Doctors.

683
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:21,086
Shock, panic,
V.I.P. Medicine...

684
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:22,322
Call it what you want.

685
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,915
Both presidents
should have survived.

686
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:27,003
OK. OK,
Mr History buff

687
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,561
here's the first
tough decision:

688
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,040
We got a 70-year-old
patient in there

689
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:32,202
that we need
to put to sleep,

690
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:34,238
and he's eaten lunch
in the last 2 hours.

691
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:35,516
What do we do?

692
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:37,126
What we'd do
with any other patient.

693
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:40,159
Sellick manoeuvre.
Calculated risk.

694
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:42,323
All right.

695
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:43,766
Thanks.

696
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,002
OK.

697
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,724
(Heavy sigh)

698
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:59,796
Dear Lord, please guide me
and help me through this.

699
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,725
Find it within your power
and your mercy

700
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:04,917
to help me heal this man.

701
00:31:13,927 --> 00:31:15,519
Let's go.
Let's go.

702
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:17,239
I need a scalpel.

703
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:22,280
Mr Reagan?

704
00:31:22,407 --> 00:31:24,318
Dr Knopf here is
our anaesthesiologist.

705
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:26,119
He'll give you a shot
to put you to sleep,

706
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:27,316
and then we'll begin.

707
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:45,242
I hope you guys
are Republicans.

708
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,279
Mr President,
today we're all Republicans.

709
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:54,607
(Groaning)

710
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:56,797
Ed. Jim.

711
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:02,797
Who's minding the store?

712
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:04,918
(Tyres squealing)

713
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:10,078
We're in!
Close the gate!

714
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,239
They call this
the Monroe door.

715
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,522
As in Marilyn,
not the doctrine.

716
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:00,521
This way, sir.

717
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,683
Like this place, Buddy?

718
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:04,718
Used to be a bowling alley.

719
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:21,440
We have secure
ground-to-air?

720
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,636
Yes, sir.

721
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,918
Need to get in contact
with Air Force Two.

722
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,526
The NSA operator
will connect you.

723
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:28,716
Oh, uh, Mr Secretary,

724
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,519
There are Cabinet
members upstairs.

725
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:32,524
Send them down.

726
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,558
Scalpel.

727
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,439
HAIG:
All right, gentlemen...

728
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,125
I don't have
to emphasize to you

729
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,681
the depth of the crisis
that we face here today.

730
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:03,037
The President's condition
is critical.

731
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:07,558
We have to conduct ourselves
in a manner and capacity

732
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,917
that will make him proud.

733
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:13,517
We also have to convince
the nation and the world

734
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:16,480
that the government
is running smoothly.

735
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,518
Want to take some notes,
David?

736
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:21,400
Now, I want to go
around the table

737
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:22,721
and ascertain the facts.

738
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:25,520
We have to... prepare
a statement for the press.

739
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,445
We have to cable
our ambassadors abroad.

740
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:32,082
And we have to make
a full report to the Congress.

741
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:34,323
Where's Weinberger?

742
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:38,078
(Chuckles)

743
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,243
You want to get
the Defence Secretary in here,

744
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,005
for Christ's sake,

745
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:43,606
and call the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs...

746
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:46,525
We gotta get a full report
on the Polish situation.

747
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:47,557
Mr Treasury Secretary...

748
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:48,915
Yes, Al.

749
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,526
What do we know about
the assailant, if anything?

750
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:52,000
His name is
John W. Hinckley.

751
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:54,721
Dropped out of Texas
Tech this past fall.

752
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:57,077
He was arrested at
the Nashville airport

753
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:59,926
for carrying 3 guns
in his carry-on bag

754
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:01,765
plus 30 rounds
of ammunition.

755
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:03,479
Now, the President
was campaigning

756
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:04,926
in Nashville
that day,

757
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:07,925
and we've confirmed
that Hinckley was at that rally.

758
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:11,756
This incident was reported
to the FBI, but not...

759
00:35:11,887 --> 00:35:13,240
I repeat, not...

760
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:16,564
conveyed to the Secret Service
by the Bureau.

761
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:18,757
It's standard procedure
to pass that on, Don.

762
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:19,842
Have you confirmed that?

763
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,286
Bill Webster
told me that,

764
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:23,284
just before I left
to come here.

765
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:26,126
I suppose that the Director
of the FBI should know.

766
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:29,956
My agents scoped in
on Hinckley right away,

767
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,566
but had no probable cause.

768
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:33,882
Now, if he had been on file,
as he should have been,

769
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,963
we would've arrested
him on sight.

770
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:39,682
Now I've got the First Lady
screaming for my head.

771
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:41,126
OK, so what do I got here?

772
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,078
A grade-A psycho.

773
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,721
He apparently did this
to impress, uh...

774
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:49,760
the actress from, uh...
from the movie Taxi Driver.

775
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:52,447
Another interesting titbit...

776
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,717
He's a member
of the American Nazi Party.

777
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:56,917
Only the Nazis
expelled him

778
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,083
because they considered him
to be too dangerous.

779
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:00,879
What are you
doing?

780
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:01,996
Can't get through
to anybody.

781
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:03,116
I had the hospital
on the line,

782
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:04,680
but then it's gone.

783
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:07,356
Sir, we have Air Force Two
for you on the beige phone.

784
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:09,682
"Mr Vice President,
this is Secretary Haig.

785
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:10,683
BUSH: Hello?

786
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:11,683
HAIG: Hello.

787
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:12,683
Hello.

788
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:13,956
Are you there,
Mr Secretary?

789
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:15,725
L... I can't hear you.

790
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:17,917
We must have
a bad connection.

791
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:19,275
Hello? Is anybody there?

792
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:20,681
What was that?

793
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:22,365
I can't understand you, Al!

794
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:24,842
Hello?
Hello?

795
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,366
Can you hear me?

796
00:36:26,487 --> 00:36:27,806
George...

797
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,201
I was informed
of the shooting.

798
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:31,716
Thank God the President
wasn't injured.

799
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:33,075
Is anybody there?

800
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:34,845
Hello? Hello?

801
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,117
Jesus.

802
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:38,919
George, this is Al...

803
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,924
You want to get some phones
in here that work?

804
00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:43,880
The connection was fine
a moment ago, sir.

805
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:45,599
What are you saying,

806
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:47,877
I don't know how
to use a phone?

807
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:49,326
This is
the Operations Centre

808
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:51,722
of the entire government.

809
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:52,882
We need to be able
to communicate

810
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:54,281
with the outside world.
Now get some

811
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,760
goddamn phones
in here!

812
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:58,003
I don't care
what colour they are!

813
00:36:58,127 --> 00:36:59,003
Yes, sir.

814
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:00,879
Good of you
to join us, Cap.

815
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:03,567
Any teletypes
on Air Force Two?

816
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:05,598
Yes.

817
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:07,524
Buddy, draft a telex
to the Vice President.

818
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:09,285
Tell him to get back here
as soon as possible.

819
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:15,117
My driver disappeared,
so Bobby Inman drove me.

820
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:16,680
We ran into some traffic.

821
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:18,035
You been briefed?

822
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:19,566
Yes, I've, uh...
approved a statement

823
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:20,961
to be cabled to
our foreign posts,

824
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:22,486
and I've raised
the alert status

825
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,676
of our forces.

826
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:24,842
You did what?

827
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,117
I raised the alert status
of our forces.

828
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,078
Did you know about this,
General?

829
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:32,756
No. This is the first
I've heard of it.

830
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:34,206
It's proper under
the circumstances.

831
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:35,203
Wait a second.

832
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:36,965
Let's go back.

833
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:41,002
Have the Soviets
invaded Poland?

834
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:42,799
No.

835
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,043
Any moves across the border?
Anything unusual?

836
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:46,885
No, Mr Secretary,
They haven't.

837
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:50,602
So what is it that you've done,
Cap, and why?

838
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,195
First of all...

839
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:56,797
Who appointed you to be
in charge of these proceedings?

840
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:58,042
I mean...

841
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,600
Why are you
running the show?

842
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:01,046
The Chiefs of Staff concur

843
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,680
that as senior
Cabinet Officer,

844
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:04,479
I'm in charge
of Crisis Control

845
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:05,881
in the VP's absence.

846
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:08,680
They're at the hospital
if you'd like it confirmed.

847
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:09,956
Very well.

848
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,884
You handle Crisis Control.

849
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:13,122
I'll handle Defence.

850
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,477
I can't do anything
until I know

851
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:16,835
whether you've raised
the Defcon.

852
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:18,161
I've done nothing of the kind.

853
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:20,084
Procedure is important
here, gentlemen.

854
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:21,845
See if we can find
a policy book

855
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:22,877
regarding
the 25th Amendment...

856
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:23,883
all right, Cap...

857
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:25,645
This is real important.

858
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,086
Where would I find
something like that?

859
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:28,959
Somebody's got to have one...
make some calls.

860
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:31,442
Would you please tell us
exactly what you've done?

861
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,841
I spoke to S.A.C. And Norad.

862
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:33,956
And you said...

863
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,805
That in light
of the Soviet situation,

864
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:37,679
We should, so they
don't get any ideas,

865
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:39,035
heighten our readiness.

866
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,476
Great. You've
raised the Defcon.

867
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:42,881
You do know what
a Defcon is?

868
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,998
I mean, I know
you're new at this job.

869
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:46,685
I know what Defcon is, Al.

870
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:48,206
Defcon 5... our forces

871
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,079
in normal peacetime
conditions.

872
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:51,083
Defcon 4.

873
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:52,196
Air force crews alerted

874
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:54,477
to take off
in 10 or 15 minutes.

875
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:55,960
Defcon 3...

876
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:59,045
Ouch! I'm trying
to work here.

877
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,442
Who the hell are you?

878
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:03,398
He's the phone
repairman, sir.

879
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:04,960
Alejandro. Who are you?

880
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:07,396
You got a security clearance
to be in here?

881
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:08,403
Is this guy cleared?

882
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:09,403
You can't work
in the building

883
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:10,403
without a clearance, sir.

884
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:11,482
Double-check that.

885
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:12,926
We're in crisis mode here.

886
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:15,083
You just shut up
and do your job,

887
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:16,196
and then get the hell out.

888
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:20,081
Draft of the telex
to the VP.

889
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:21,526
All right, David,

890
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,205
When you prepare
the statement for the press,

891
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:26,125
make sure you tell them that
he's returning to Washington.

892
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,363
Don't tell them where
he's coming from

893
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:29,476
or when he's expected.

894
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:31,518
CASEY:
Beware the wolf...

895
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:33,399
out there howling.

896
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:36,087
Wolf packs off our shore.

897
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,163
Watch the shore.

898
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:39,606
The shore.

899
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:41,638
I think he's saying
we need to monitor

900
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:44,486
Soviet moves off our coast.

901
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:45,483
General, um...

902
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:48,075
Get to a phone that works

903
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:50,721
and find out
what the Soviets are up to.

904
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,566
You see, Cap,
when the Russians realize

905
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:55,359
that we've
ratcheted up the Defcon,

906
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,920
they're going to do
the same,

907
00:39:57,047 --> 00:40:00,084
and then we're going to be in
a situation beyond our control.

908
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:01,481
STEIN: Right.

909
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,040
When Kennedy was shot,
the Soviets thought

910
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,522
we'd accuse them of complicity
due to Oswald's Soviet...

911
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:06,636
OK, OK.

912
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,917
That's enough.

913
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:12,119
The Soviets are prone
to lose their cool

914
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:13,839
in situations like this.

915
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:15,320
Their leaders

916
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,961
may conclude that we think
they're responsible

917
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:20,078
for the attack
on the President.

918
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,004
The consequences
of what you've done

919
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:23,765
Mr Secretary,
could be incalculable.

920
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:32,679
I did not intend to raise
our Defcon status,

921
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,877
and I don't believe
that I have.

922
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:38,044
You don't know
what you've done,

923
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,477
and until you figure it out,
we have to assume the worst.

924
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:46,803
I can't get through
to the Situation Room.

925
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:47,962
Me, neither.

926
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:49,839
I got Larry Speakes
on the other line.

927
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,320
He's in the White House
press room.

928
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:52,675
Is the President
in surgery?

929
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:54,001
We have word
the President's...

930
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:55,560
Listen to me, please.
Listen to me.

931
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,439
We're going to have
a press conference,

932
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:58,682
probably
at the White House.

933
00:40:58,807 --> 00:40:59,842
We'll let you know.

934
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:00,922
We'll shuttle you
back and forth, OK?

935
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:02,605
Relax. Take it easy,
take it easy.

936
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:05,287
(Reporters shouting)

937
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:08,604
(Saw whirring)

938
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:14,923
You all right?

939
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:16,560
Sure.

940
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:20,682
Take it easy.

941
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,362
The Secret Service guys
want an update.

942
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:33,284
Tell them we're busy.

943
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:36,036
(Clattering)

944
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:39,480
OK, give me
a hand here.

945
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:40,835
Let's get him
out of here.

946
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,277
CarefuI, Ben.

947
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:49,284
I'm worried
about an embolism.

948
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:50,999
Yeah. I understand.

949
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:02,480
We don't know where
this thing is, Joe.

950
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,677
We're going to
need more x-rays.

951
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:06,684
Right away, Doctor.

952
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:09,765
What's an embolism?

953
00:42:10,847 --> 00:42:11,962
Are you guys in there

954
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:13,805
to protect the President
or to spy on us?

955
00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:14,962
Just trying
to do our job.

956
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:16,486
You know,
this may come

957
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:18,598
as a surprise to you,
but so are we.

958
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:19,955
And you should
be helping us

959
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:21,964
instead of interrupting
with stupid questions

960
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:24,237
and moment-by-moment
updates.

961
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:26,278
This isn't a fucking
baseball game in there.

962
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:27,442
That's the President.

963
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:28,636
Look, the bullet
is lodged

964
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:29,882
between his lung,

965
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:31,679
which has collapsed,
and his heart.

966
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,206
It's difficult
to get to.

967
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:34,680
If while
searching for it,

968
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:36,206
I nudge it accidentally,

969
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:37,362
it could embolize.

970
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,284
That is, be sucked
right into the heart

971
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:40,806
causing instant
heart failure.

972
00:42:40,927 --> 00:42:42,440
Or, it could be pumped

973
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:43,682
right on through
the heart

974
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:45,877
and into the brain,
causing instant death.

975
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:48,680
So you want
my guys out of there?

976
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:50,479
Yes.

977
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:56,281
Look, you've got the entire
floor sectioned off, right?

978
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,284
Just put a couple of
guys outside each door

979
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:00,284
and maybe we'll get
through this thing.

980
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:15,885
Satellite photos
for General Yates.

981
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:18,443
Proceed.

982
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:30,157
YATES: And these icons indicate
their present position

983
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:31,800
off our coast,

984
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:33,121
out of the box.

985
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,999
All of them
are nuclear?

986
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:36,162
I'm afraid so.

987
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:37,879
What does that mean,
"out of the box"?

988
00:43:38,007 --> 00:43:40,202
Well, I'm sure our
Secretary of Defence knows.

989
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,726
Why don't you
tell them, Cap?

990
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:43,678
I don't have to
take that from you.

991
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:44,876
Take what?

992
00:43:45,007 --> 00:43:47,396
I'm just asking
a simple question.

993
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:48,801
You take everything
so personally.

994
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:50,360
To answer the question,
"out of the box"

995
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:51,920
means the Soviets
are placing

996
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,641
their nuclear submarines
in attack formation.

997
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:56,041
Jesus. Why?

998
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,646
Also, we've got
extraordinary activity

999
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,725
out of their sub bases
at Polyarni,

1000
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:01,996
with at least 20 subs

1001
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:04,163
heading at high speed
into the Atlantic.

1002
00:44:04,287 --> 00:44:05,720
Great. Red ones.

1003
00:44:05,847 --> 00:44:07,280
It's not unprecedented

1004
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:10,205
for Soviet subs
to be "out of the box."

1005
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:11,806
Well, not in concert

1006
00:44:11,927 --> 00:44:14,202
with the release
of that many subs

1007
00:44:14,327 --> 00:44:15,282
from their home bases.

1008
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:16,760
I mean, let's
face it, gentlemen...

1009
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,764
what's happening here

1010
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:20,843
is in direct response
to our increased Defcon.

1011
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:23,037
It could be an exercise.

1012
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,316
It happens.

1013
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,960
HAIG: Whenever you call
for an alert?

1014
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:27,076
(Chuckling)

1015
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,356
How often is that, anyway?

1016
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,717
Answer one thing, General.

1017
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,678
Can they strike first?

1018
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:34,001
Yes, sir.

1019
00:44:34,127 --> 00:44:35,116
How do we stop them?

1020
00:44:35,247 --> 00:44:37,841
By striking first.

1021
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:42,595
This isn't your call, Al.

1022
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:46,402
According to the National
Security Act of 1947,

1023
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:48,802
National Command Authority
devolves upon me.

1024
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:50,758
And if we had
working phones here,

1025
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:52,639
I'd call Ed Meese
and confirm it.

1026
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:55,281
Any issue involving Defence

1027
00:44:55,407 --> 00:44:57,602
is handled by me
and by me alone.

1028
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,321
Al, isn't there a precedent
for this situation?

1029
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,596
Well, not really.

1030
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:03,319
I mean,
how often do we have

1031
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:04,880
an escalating crisis

1032
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:06,235
that's instigated
by a Defence Secretary

1033
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:08,961
who's inadvertently
put us on a war footing

1034
00:45:09,087 --> 00:45:11,647
with the most powerfuI
nation on earth,

1035
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,678
and who then
has the gall to demand

1036
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:15,604
that we let him
handle everything?

1037
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:16,603
Is that Larry Speakes?

1038
00:45:17,807 --> 00:45:19,160
REGAN:
That's upstairs...

1039
00:45:19,287 --> 00:45:20,720
in the White House
press room.

1040
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:21,802
Turn it up.

1041
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:25,639
SPEAKES:
We'll be down here hourly

1042
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,076
to update the situation
while Lyn is at the hospital.

1043
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:29,196
All I can say at this time

1044
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,045
is that the President

1045
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:33,158
has a gunshot wound
to the left side of his chest.

1046
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:35,278
He's reported
in stable condition.

1047
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:36,840
Larry, is the President
in surgery?

1048
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,083
L... I can't really say.

1049
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:40,640
Neil Reagan,
the President's brother,

1050
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:41,802
was called
by the First Lady

1051
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:43,326
and has been told
that the President

1052
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:44,766
is in emergency
surgery right now.

1053
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:46,002
Is your information
going to be

1054
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:47,606
that far behind
what we're getting

1055
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:48,603
from other sources?

1056
00:45:48,727 --> 00:45:49,682
That's the extent

1057
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:50,796
of what I can say
at this time.

1058
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:51,962
We'll do our best
to keep up.

1059
00:45:52,087 --> 00:45:53,236
Has the U.S. Military
been placed

1060
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,005
on any higher
alert readiness?

1061
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,116
Not that I'm aware of.

1062
00:45:56,247 --> 00:45:58,681
What is he saying?

1063
00:45:58,807 --> 00:45:59,683
This is bad.

1064
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:00,796
Who authorized this?

1065
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:01,837
SPEAKES: I don't have
that information

1066
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,843
at this time.

1067
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:03,843
We're getting
rumours out of

1068
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:04,877
the Soviet
embassy...

1069
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:05,837
Would the
Vice President

1070
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:06,843
assume emergency
powers?

1071
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:08,195
Not that I'm aware of.

1072
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:09,840
I don't think anyone knows
where he is right now.

1073
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,195
If the President
goes under anaesthesia,

1074
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:13,477
would Bush become Acting
President at that moment?

1075
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:15,006
Or under what
circumstances does he?

1076
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:17,561
I cannot answer
that question at this time.

1077
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:18,756
Now, that's a hell
of an answer!

1078
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:20,002
...determines whether
the Vice President

1079
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:22,482
should, in fact,
become the Acting President?

1080
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:23,676
I don't know the details.

1081
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:25,126
We got to get him off.

1082
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:26,805
Anybody else want
to open their yap,

1083
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:27,996
clear it through me.

1084
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:30,482
That's all the information
I have right now.

1085
00:46:30,607 --> 00:46:32,006
We will keep you updated.

1086
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:33,879
You're not authorized
to make reports or statements

1087
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:35,156
on first strikes
or anything

1088
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:36,276
without first
going through me.

1089
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:37,476
General Haig said...

1090
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:38,642
He's not
a General anymore.

1091
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:39,916
He's Secretary of State.

1092
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,162
I'm your boss, not him!

1093
00:46:42,327 --> 00:46:44,716
STEIN:
What are you going to do?

1094
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,883
Somebody's got to calm
these people down.

1095
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:49,441
Everything is falling apart.

1096
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:54,763
Al's not going to address
the press, is he?

1097
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:57,606
He's the last guy
we want up there.

1098
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,845
SPEAKES: Mr Brady
has a serious head wound.

1099
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:14,197
That is all the information
I have right now.

1100
00:47:14,327 --> 00:47:15,203
We will keep you updated.

1101
00:47:15,327 --> 00:47:16,203
Get him off.

1102
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:18,079
Give me a pen.

1103
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:19,435
We are attempting to get you

1104
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:21,205
the most accurate
information we can

1105
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:23,602
as fast as we can,
but these things happen

1106
00:47:23,727 --> 00:47:26,036
when don't have time
to research the facts.

1107
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:27,077
Is there any truth

1108
00:47:27,207 --> 00:47:28,606
to speculation
that the gunman

1109
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:30,718
may not have been
working alone?

1110
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,599
The Secret Service
is investigating.

1111
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:33,921
Who'll be determining
the status of the President?

1112
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:36,038
That's all I have to say
right now. Thank you.

1113
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,486
Larry!

1114
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:39,199
Larry!
Larry!

1115
00:47:39,327 --> 00:47:43,081
(Reporters clamouring)

1116
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:44,083
They ask you

1117
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:45,686
who's running this government

1118
00:47:45,807 --> 00:47:48,799
at a time of national crisis
and you say, "I don't know"?

1119
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:50,804
They ask you who's
defending this country

1120
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:53,760
at a time of national crisis
and you say, "I don't know"?

1121
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:55,400
What kind of a moron are you?

1122
00:47:55,527 --> 00:47:56,596
I'm Deputy Press Secretary.

1123
00:47:56,727 --> 00:47:57,603
Who authorized you?

1124
00:47:57,727 --> 00:47:58,876
Jim Baker did.

1125
00:47:59,007 --> 00:47:59,883
This comes through
the Situation Room.

1126
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:01,406
This comes through me.

1127
00:48:01,527 --> 00:48:02,596
Tell Baker. He's running
things from the hospital.

1128
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:03,876
We have to make a statement.

1129
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:04,962
Let's get David Gergen
up here.

1130
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:07,203
Fuck that! I'll do it.

1131
00:48:07,327 --> 00:48:08,203
Al...

1132
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:09,396
REPORTER:
There he is.

1133
00:48:09,527 --> 00:48:10,596
Mr Secretary!

1134
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:12,206
(Reporters clamouring)

1135
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,925
(Heartbeat thumping)

1136
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,603
I want to touch
on a few matters...

1137
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:35,001
(Clears throat)

1138
00:48:35,127 --> 00:48:37,641
...directly associated
with today's tragedy.

1139
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:39,598
Um...

1140
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:41,604
Um...

1141
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,001
First, as you know...

1142
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:45,925
we are in close touch
with the Vice President

1143
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:48,117
who is returning to Washington.

1144
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:49,600
Um...

1145
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,558
Sounds like he's
having a heart attack.

1146
00:48:51,687 --> 00:48:54,804
We have
in the Situation Room

1147
00:48:54,927 --> 00:48:56,485
all of the officials
of the Cabinet

1148
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:59,075
who should be here
and ready at this time.

1149
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:03,519
We have cabled
our friends abroad.

1150
00:49:03,647 --> 00:49:05,877
(Clearing throat)

1151
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:10,922
The... President's condition
is stable,

1152
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:14,596
and he is now in surgery,

1153
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:16,399
and there are absolutely

1154
00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:19,599
no alert measures
that are necessary at this time

1155
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:22,036
that are being contemplated.

1156
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,681
Why is he saying that?

1157
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:26,877
Now, if you have
any questions,

1158
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,076
I'd be happy to take them.

1159
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:29,435
(All clamouring)

1160
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,319
Crisis management...
is that going to go

1161
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:32,766
into effect
when Bush arrives?

1162
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,036
Crisis management is in effect.

1163
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,441
Who's making
the decisions

1164
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:36,966
for the
government right now?

1165
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:38,042
Who's making
the decisions?

1166
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,600
Constitutionally,
gentlemen,

1167
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,604
it's the President,
the Vice President,

1168
00:49:41,727 --> 00:49:43,604
the Secretary of State,
in that order.

1169
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:45,399
If the President decides

1170
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,643
to transfer the helm,

1171
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:48,643
he will do so.

1172
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:50,519
He has not done that.

1173
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:54,720
As of now,
I am in control...

1174
00:49:54,847 --> 00:49:56,997
I am in control here...

1175
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,765
here... here...

1176
00:49:58,887 --> 00:50:00,479
at the White House...
at White House...

1177
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:01,483
at the White House...

1178
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:03,563
at the White House.

1179
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:04,597
What the hell
is he saying?

1180
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:08,405
What's the reaction...
what is the reaction

1181
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:10,245
of the Soviets on this?
Any reaction?

1182
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:12,244
We don't anticipate
any reaction.

1183
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:14,164
You'll remain in charge
here for how long?

1184
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:17,518
I intend to remain here
until the situation clarifies,

1185
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,126
however long it takes.

1186
00:50:19,247 --> 00:50:21,841
You may have misspoken
earlier on when you stated

1187
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:23,559
that you were
third in line.

1188
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,564
I don't think the Secretary
of State is third in line.

1189
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:27,518
Read your constitution, pal.

1190
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:28,966
I have to go.

1191
00:50:29,087 --> 00:50:31,806
Mr Haig!
Mr Haig!

1192
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:33,883
(Reporters clamouring)

1193
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:39,006
Oh...

1194
00:50:39,127 --> 00:50:41,197
Not bad for a lower
Merion grad.

1195
00:50:41,327 --> 00:50:42,840
No stopping me now, Buddy.

1196
00:50:48,887 --> 00:50:51,162
We're witnessing
a coup, gentlemen.

1197
00:50:51,287 --> 00:50:52,276
He's gone mad.

1198
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:54,363
(Telephone rings)

1199
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:57,243
Ed Meese, for you.

1200
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:05,566
I know, Ed.

1201
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,042
Yes, we've got a problem.

1202
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,203
(TV playing softly)

1203
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:13,399
You said, "absolutely
no alert measures

1204
00:51:13,527 --> 00:51:15,245
at this time."

1205
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,164
Why'd you say that?

1206
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:19,084
That's in direct
contradiction

1207
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:21,243
to what I told you.

1208
00:51:21,367 --> 00:51:23,756
Just fixing
your screw-up, Caspar.

1209
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:25,161
Oh, use a little tact, Al.

1210
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:26,845
I hang pictures on those.

1211
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:29,527
I sent out a message
of calm just now.

1212
00:51:29,647 --> 00:51:31,319
You lied.

1213
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:32,482
You lied!

1214
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:34,040
You stood up there
and told the world

1215
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:35,316
we're not on alert
when we are.

1216
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:36,402
The Russians
know that.

1217
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:37,960
God knows how
they'll react.

1218
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:39,759
You've put us in harm's way.

1219
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:41,036
You know, I love the fact

1220
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:43,044
that you've twisted
this whole thing around.

1221
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:46,045
Another thing, Al, you
misstated the succession.

1222
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:48,283
Now, I trust it was
an honest mistake.

1223
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:49,317
I misstated nothing.

1224
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:50,436
What are you talking about?

1225
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,285
I'm afraid you did.

1226
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:54,204
You guys just can't
handle the fact

1227
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:56,716
that I've got the press
eating out of my hands.

1228
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,166
Now, we've got
to set aside

1229
00:51:58,287 --> 00:52:00,357
these petty differences.

1230
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:02,318
We can't have
dissension right now.

1231
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:04,483
Don's right, Al.
Succession devolves

1232
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:06,962
to the Speaker of the House
after the VP.

1233
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:08,998
Secretary of State's
way down the totem pole.

1234
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:10,526
Here's a copy
of the Constitution

1235
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:11,875
as well as
the 25th Amendment

1236
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:13,326
which deals with
the transfer of authority

1237
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:15,199
whenever the President
is disabled.

1238
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:16,760
I know the Constitution
by heart.

1239
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:17,842
I'm third in line.

1240
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:19,366
That's the way it was

1241
00:52:19,487 --> 00:52:21,079
when we were in school,
Al.

1242
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:23,960
It was amended
in '67.

1243
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:30,158
Since you know it
by heart, Mr Secretary,

1244
00:52:30,287 --> 00:52:32,437
perhaps you could just
state it aloud

1245
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,398
while the rest of us
follow along, hmm?

1246
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,882
MAN ON TV: Well, there's just
no question about it.

1247
00:52:37,007 --> 00:52:38,804
Secretary of State Haig
was just plain wrong.

1248
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:41,361
Now, I have the Constitution
here, and it clearly states

1249
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:44,206
that if there is neither
a President nor a Vice President

1250
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,124
to discharge the duties
and the powers

1251
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:47,839
of the office
of the President,

1252
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:50,356
then the Speaker
of the House of Representatives

1253
00:52:50,487 --> 00:52:51,966
shall act as the President.

1254
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:53,156
Now, after that, comes

1255
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,403
the President pro tempore
of the Senate

1256
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:57,119
and only...
and only after that

1257
00:52:57,247 --> 00:52:59,636
comes the Secretary
of State.

1258
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:01,325
It's very clear.

1259
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:04,359
Now, Secretary Haig seemed
confused, out of sorts up there.

1260
00:53:04,487 --> 00:53:06,159
Now, this is cause
for concern, too.

1261
00:53:06,287 --> 00:53:08,801
The Reagan White House
has raised questions

1262
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:09,996
in the people's minds as to

1263
00:53:10,127 --> 00:53:11,162
just who is
in control here.

1264
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:12,720
According to Mr Haig,

1265
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,439
he is in control
at the White House.

1266
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,080
Well, there you have it.

1267
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:18,357
We've clarified
Mr Haig's position

1268
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,364
at the White House for him.

1269
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:22,955
Uh, he may be going
back to school

1270
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:25,601
and reviewing
his Constitution.

1271
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:27,843
Turn it off.

1272
00:53:27,967 --> 00:53:29,605
Turn that off!

1273
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,955
We need the TV
on, Al.

1274
00:53:31,087 --> 00:53:32,361
There are too many
people in here.

1275
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:33,920
Who are you people, anyway?

1276
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:35,765
You got a security
clearance?

1277
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:37,639
Get these people
the fuck out of here!

1278
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:41,885
Do I have to do
everything by myself?

1279
00:53:46,287 --> 00:53:48,676
I'm sorry, Buddy.

1280
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:51,196
I'm sorry.

1281
00:53:51,327 --> 00:53:52,885
I'm feeling
like shit.

1282
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:54,122
Call the office.

1283
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:56,886
Tell Muriel to send
my medication.

1284
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:11,326
The Deputy Press Secretary's
statements gave the impression

1285
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:14,564
that the government was
in a state of paralysis.

1286
00:54:14,687 --> 00:54:16,917
With the Chief Executive
inactive,

1287
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:18,924
certain steps are necessary.

1288
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,720
And in the absence

1289
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:22,996
of the Vice President,

1290
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:27,245
the orb of authority
must be wielded by someone.

1291
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:34,118
The alternative, gentlemen,
is anarchy.

1292
00:54:40,287 --> 00:54:41,720
It's a matter
of balancing the risks.

1293
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:42,802
He's lost
a lot of blood,

1294
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:44,280
and he's continuing
to lose blood.

1295
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:45,965
If we keep fishing
around for that thing,

1296
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:47,156
he's going to lose
more blood,

1297
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:48,959
and we may not be able
to stop the flow.

1298
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,555
You're saying if you leave the
bullet in there, he'll be fine.

1299
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:52,961
He's a long way
from fine.

1300
00:54:53,087 --> 00:54:54,315
But right now,
gentlemen,

1301
00:54:54,447 --> 00:54:55,926
it's the safest
way to go.

1302
00:54:57,447 --> 00:54:59,165
OK.

1303
00:54:59,287 --> 00:55:01,084
Great.
Thank you.

1304
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:03,596
Did you guys notice
any fragments in there?

1305
00:55:03,727 --> 00:55:04,955
No, just
a.22 slug.

1306
00:55:05,087 --> 00:55:06,679
That's what you
confirmed, right?

1307
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:07,683
It's a.22.

1308
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:09,001
Yeah, but it's a devastator.

1309
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:10,003
What are you
talking about?

1310
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:11,003
It's designed

1311
00:55:11,127 --> 00:55:12,560
to explode on impact.

1312
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:14,325
So if it hasn't
exploded yet,

1313
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:15,960
it could at any time.

1314
00:55:16,087 --> 00:55:17,236
You've got to be
kidding me.

1315
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:18,766
So you simply forgot
to tell us this?

1316
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:19,797
We're searching
for a bullet

1317
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:21,042
that might burst
on contact?

1318
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:23,727
We just found out.

1319
00:55:23,847 --> 00:55:26,042
Well, that settles it...
we got to get it out.

1320
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:27,964
Yeah, great.

1321
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:29,964
Well, you guys just send
the flak jackets

1322
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:31,236
when you're ready.

1323
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:38,802
We're, uh, reaching

1324
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:40,645
crisis point here,
Buddy,

1325
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:42,564
and we need
your assistance.

1326
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:44,678
We've got to get
Al out of here.

1327
00:55:44,807 --> 00:55:46,001
Out of here?

1328
00:55:46,127 --> 00:55:48,004
What do you mean?

1329
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:49,196
The press
is scrutinizing

1330
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:51,158
this "I'm in control"
statement he made.

1331
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:53,164
If that's all they talk about,
we'll be fortunate.

1332
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:54,720
It's not working, Buddy.

1333
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:56,485
The man needs
a cold shower.

1334
00:55:58,087 --> 00:55:59,759
I understand.

1335
00:55:59,887 --> 00:56:01,161
So, Buddy...

1336
00:56:01,287 --> 00:56:04,882
Look, I served under Al
in the first battalion.

1337
00:56:05,007 --> 00:56:07,441
Once near the Cambodian border,
my patrol was cut off.

1338
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:09,558
We were surrounded,
taking heavy enemy fire.

1339
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,759
We... we know that he's a hero,
Buddy, absolutely.

1340
00:56:12,887 --> 00:56:14,161
Just let me finish.

1341
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,802
Back at base, Al, against
the advice of his superiors,

1342
00:56:17,927 --> 00:56:20,566
boarded a chopper
and crash-landed it

1343
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:23,247
in the centre
of all the fighting.

1344
00:56:23,367 --> 00:56:25,881
He led us in
hand-to-hand action

1345
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,838
that cut through
enemy lines.

1346
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,561
Those men love Al Haig

1347
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,121
'cause he never took
them for granted.

1348
00:56:33,247 --> 00:56:36,956
He never wanted to lose
a single soldier.

1349
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:40,636
Now, you can make fun
of his mistakes,

1350
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:43,486
and you can backstab him
all you want,

1351
00:56:43,607 --> 00:56:45,837
but I won't be party to it.

1352
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:48,561
I love that man.

1353
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:51,121
I owe him my life.

1354
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:03,563
REGAN: Yes?

1355
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:05,040
Yes, thank you.

1356
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:08,523
They've reported calls
to the White House switchboard

1357
00:57:08,647 --> 00:57:11,400
saying that there's going
to be another attempt

1358
00:57:11,527 --> 00:57:12,880
on the President's life.

1359
00:57:13,007 --> 00:57:16,158
How many psychos have
we got out there?

1360
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,640
Too damn many.

1361
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,678
We notified the hospital?

1362
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:21,035
My people have
been informed.

1363
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,646
The FBI is
tracing the calls.

1364
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:25,520
Stay on it.

1365
00:57:25,647 --> 00:57:26,875
You can count on it, Al.

1366
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:29,077
There's going to be nobody
get into that hospital.

1367
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:12,161
Hey.

1368
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:13,720
Think this could work?

1369
00:58:16,647 --> 00:58:17,841
Are you serious?

1370
00:58:17,967 --> 00:58:19,798
Let the tubing track me
to the bullet.

1371
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:21,360
Why not?

1372
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:28,325
Nice and easy.

1373
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:43,002
I think I've got something.

1374
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:45,038
Scalpel.

1375
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:53,759
There it is.

1376
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:56,878
Forceps.

1377
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:01,479
Slowly, Ben.

1378
00:59:13,087 --> 00:59:14,440
I got it.

1379
00:59:15,607 --> 00:59:16,642
Thank God.

1380
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:32,761
Damn it.

1381
00:59:32,887 --> 00:59:34,286
What?

1382
00:59:34,727 --> 00:59:37,116
Damn it, we've got a bleeder
in the pleural cavity.

1383
00:59:37,247 --> 00:59:39,283
NURSE: Suction.
BP's dropping.

1384
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:41,921
They've got the bullet out?

1385
00:59:42,047 --> 00:59:42,923
Yeah.

1386
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:44,082
Can I see
him now?

1387
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:45,083
Not yet, Nancy.
He's still in surgery.

1388
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,686
They have to finish
their work.

1389
00:59:46,807 --> 00:59:47,876
We have just in
to the studio.

1390
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:49,725
I'm afraid
some very sad news

1391
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:51,121
from George Washington Hospital.

1392
00:59:51,247 --> 00:59:55,286
James Brady,
the very popular

1393
00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:58,080
Press Secretary
to the President, has died.

1394
00:59:58,207 --> 00:59:59,640
No, no, Nancy...

1395
00:59:59,767 --> 01:00:02,998
He's... he's all right.

1396
01:00:03,127 --> 01:00:07,757
Oh, my God. My God.

1397
01:00:09,927 --> 01:00:11,883
Where is...

1398
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:18,242
What happened,
Mrs Reagan?

1399
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:23,081
Oh, haven't they told you?

1400
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:26,121
I'm so sorry.

1401
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,805
Jim is dead.

1402
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:30,760
They've just
announced it.

1403
01:00:32,407 --> 01:00:34,875
(Screaming)

1404
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:37,157
Doctor.

1405
01:00:37,287 --> 01:00:39,005
(Whispering)

1406
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:41,004
Hmm?

1407
01:00:44,247 --> 01:00:46,602
I'll be right back.

1408
01:00:53,927 --> 01:00:55,565
Let me say it like this.

1409
01:00:55,687 --> 01:00:58,076
No one has told
Mr Brady or myself.

1410
01:00:58,207 --> 01:00:59,606
Now, may I get back

1411
01:00:59,727 --> 01:01:01,240
to work?

1412
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:07,082
We'd like to amend a report
from a few moments ago.

1413
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:09,084
James Brady is alive.

1414
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:12,517
Repeat,
James Brady is alive.

1415
01:01:12,647 --> 01:01:15,878
In serious condition
and presently in surgery,

1416
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:17,042
but he is alive.

1417
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:20,239
Our earlier report
that he had died

1418
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:22,119
obviously a mistake.

1419
01:01:22,247 --> 01:01:26,559
Our apologies, our sincere
apologies to his family.

1420
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,279
I guess the President's men
at the White House...

1421
01:01:28,407 --> 01:01:30,716
(Beeping)

1422
01:01:30,847 --> 01:01:33,077
Aren't the only ones
in error today.

1423
01:01:33,207 --> 01:01:35,960
James Baker
for you, sir.

1424
01:01:36,087 --> 01:01:37,156
Jim.

1425
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:38,845
Yeah, yeah, good news.

1426
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:40,446
Yeah, it is good news.

1427
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:45,163
Uh... AI, you know, we are
very concerned about

1428
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:46,800
this press conference
you gave.

1429
01:01:46,927 --> 01:01:47,916
What about it?

1430
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:49,765
Well, there's
a lot of misinformation

1431
01:01:49,887 --> 01:01:51,161
going around.

1432
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:54,006
Cap Weinberger's informed us
of the Soviet situation.

1433
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,961
We have got
a ticking time bomb here.

1434
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:00,647
It's the Secretary
of Defence

1435
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:02,883
who placed us
in a Defcon 3 alert.

1436
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,884
I'm just doing
damage control.

1437
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:06,440
There are some people
in that room

1438
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:08,080
who are concerned
about your handling of this.

1439
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:10,596
Really? Well, if you'll
just give me their names...

1440
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,001
That's not the point.

1441
01:02:12,127 --> 01:02:15,403
You know, we have to spread out
the authority here,

1442
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:16,516
delegate a little.

1443
01:02:16,647 --> 01:02:17,602
Ed and I, we want

1444
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:19,797
to handle the press, you know,

1445
01:02:19,927 --> 01:02:22,077
and run interference here
from the hospital.

1446
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,959
The Situation Room
is the crisis centre.

1447
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:26,885
You guys want to come down here
and be heard, that's fine.

1448
01:02:27,007 --> 01:02:27,883
I welcome you.

1449
01:02:28,007 --> 01:02:29,599
We will inform the media

1450
01:02:29,727 --> 01:02:32,446
that all decisions will be made
from here from now on

1451
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:35,206
so that myself and Ed and Mike
can handle things calmly.

1452
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:38,683
Can't have emotional tantrums
in the Op Centre.

1453
01:02:38,807 --> 01:02:41,162
The last time I checked,
Jim...

1454
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:44,199
and on this point
I know I'm right...

1455
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:47,125
neither yourself
as Chief of Staff

1456
01:02:47,247 --> 01:02:49,807
nor Ed Meese
as Chief Counsellor

1457
01:02:49,927 --> 01:02:52,885
have any constitutional
authority.

1458
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:56,795
Nor do you have
any responsibility

1459
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:58,838
for foreign affairs.

1460
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:01,527
I refuse to abrogate
my authority

1461
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:02,875
because I misspoke

1462
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:04,565
in a press conference.

1463
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:07,361
What do we do?

1464
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:09,842
It's a power move,
plain and simple.

1465
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,126
Listen, Al...

1466
01:03:14,247 --> 01:03:16,681
They, uh, they got
the bullet out of the old man,

1467
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:17,796
and we think,

1468
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,406
we hope, we pray

1469
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:20,676
that he's going to be
all right.

1470
01:03:20,807 --> 01:03:23,082
I wouldn't want to have
to tell him that

1471
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:24,765
you haven't been helpfuI here.

1472
01:03:24,887 --> 01:03:28,721
You guys have refused
to support me since day one.

1473
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,315
And as for what
the President would want,

1474
01:03:31,447 --> 01:03:34,803
I believe I've acted
completely in accordance

1475
01:03:34,927 --> 01:03:38,044
with his policy
just as he would have acted.

1476
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:39,441
Now, it is regrettable

1477
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,842
that I misstated
the succession...

1478
01:03:41,967 --> 01:03:43,082
(Telephone rings)

1479
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:45,482
But that is nothing compared
to the mistakes

1480
01:03:45,607 --> 01:03:47,438
that are going on
around here now.

1481
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:49,797
Mistakes that,
if we're lucky,

1482
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,963
the press won't ever
find out about.

1483
01:03:52,087 --> 01:03:54,078
General, we got
a red alert at Norad.

1484
01:03:54,207 --> 01:03:55,322
Say again.

1485
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:58,007
Norad, sir.
All sensors read red.

1486
01:03:58,127 --> 01:04:00,925
Get the Soviet Ambassador
on the line.

1487
01:04:01,047 --> 01:04:02,878
Ed, we have a red alert.

1488
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,360
This is what I mean, Al.

1489
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:06,284
I can't talk to you now.
I got a situation here.

1490
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:07,965
Keep us on the line,
damn it!

1491
01:04:08,087 --> 01:04:09,566
I'll put you on hold.

1492
01:04:15,367 --> 01:04:16,720
Uh, let me see
the satellite reads

1493
01:04:16,847 --> 01:04:18,326
and let's see if we can
get this confirmed

1494
01:04:18,447 --> 01:04:19,323
with our allies.

1495
01:04:19,447 --> 01:04:21,199
Yeah, I'm doing that.

1496
01:04:21,327 --> 01:04:22,999
It could be computer glitch,
a simulator.

1497
01:04:23,127 --> 01:04:24,924
Cap, you threaten
to raise navet

1498
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:26,082
to an art form.

1499
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:27,083
It's possible.

1500
01:04:27,207 --> 01:04:28,686
Strategically, gentlemen.

1501
01:04:28,807 --> 01:04:29,922
When you consider everything

1502
01:04:30,047 --> 01:04:32,322
that the Soviets
have been up to lately...

1503
01:04:32,447 --> 01:04:35,359
a launch like this
makes perfect sense.

1504
01:04:35,487 --> 01:04:37,125
All right, I need some
hard information here.

1505
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:38,839
I need to know whether
these missiles are

1506
01:04:38,967 --> 01:04:41,800
submarine-launched
or land-based.

1507
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:43,076
We're working
on that, too.

1508
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:44,196
If it's from their subs,

1509
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:45,476
we'll be toast
in 5 minutes.

1510
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:48,075
Get me Admiral Thomas.

1511
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:51,119
He has to give me the positions
of all of the subs

1512
01:04:51,247 --> 01:04:52,919
near the Soviet Union.

1513
01:04:53,047 --> 01:04:54,480
Before or after
I get Dobrynin?

1514
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:55,960
Have you got Dobrynin?

1515
01:04:56,087 --> 01:04:56,963
I'm on hold.

1516
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,759
He's away
from his desk.

1517
01:04:58,887 --> 01:05:00,286
How far away? 5 feet?
10 feet?

1518
01:05:00,407 --> 01:05:01,726
Is he taking a crap?

1519
01:05:03,927 --> 01:05:05,042
Where's the briefcase?

1520
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,441
I didn't bring one
today.

1521
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:07,886
The brief...

1522
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:10,722
The football.

1523
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:11,723
The button!

1524
01:05:11,847 --> 01:05:13,075
Where is it?!

1525
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:14,083
Oh, uh...

1526
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:15,686
That would be at the hospital

1527
01:05:15,807 --> 01:05:16,876
near the President.

1528
01:05:18,487 --> 01:05:19,397
Ed, are you there?

1529
01:05:19,527 --> 01:05:20,880
What the hell's going on?

1530
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:22,884
Norad's reading a launch
coming our way.

1531
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:24,918
A launch? Now?

1532
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:26,639
We're trying to get
more details,

1533
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:28,041
but we have to know
who's got the briefcase.

1534
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:29,839
Is he there with you?

1535
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,082
Where's the Bag Man?

1536
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:32,640
Bag Man?

1537
01:05:32,767 --> 01:05:34,359
The officer with
the briefcase.

1538
01:05:34,487 --> 01:05:35,886
The football.

1539
01:05:36,007 --> 01:05:37,360
He's around here
somewhere. Why?

1540
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:38,840
Find him immediately.

1541
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:40,798
We're working
on it, Al.

1542
01:05:40,927 --> 01:05:42,280
Now, don't do
anything hasty.

1543
01:05:42,407 --> 01:05:43,886
Jesus!

1544
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:45,156
Is he back at
his desk yet?

1545
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:46,322
No.

1546
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:47,880
Do we have a hotline
to the Kremlin?

1547
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:51,920
Uh, well, we've been having
a problem with that, sir,

1548
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:54,356
and we've been trying to...

1549
01:05:54,487 --> 01:05:55,681
But you're working
on it.

1550
01:05:55,807 --> 01:05:57,684
Yep, just
a moment.

1551
01:05:57,807 --> 01:05:58,717
Tip O'Neill,
Speaker of the House.

1552
01:05:58,847 --> 01:05:59,916
Not now!

1553
01:06:00,047 --> 01:06:01,321
He sounds angry.

1554
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:04,724
Tip.

1555
01:06:04,847 --> 01:06:05,836
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1556
01:06:05,967 --> 01:06:07,605
You're third in line,
I know.

1557
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:09,001
It was a slip of the tongue.

1558
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:11,721
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

1559
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:12,802
The press is freaking out.

1560
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,121
It's their
favourite pastime.

1561
01:06:14,247 --> 01:06:15,646
Look, I can't
talk right now.

1562
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:17,120
I'm in the middle
of something

1563
01:06:17,247 --> 01:06:18,123
a little more important.

1564
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:19,123
Thank you.

1565
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:20,680
Dobrynin will call right back.

1566
01:06:20,807 --> 01:06:21,876
He was having dinner
across the street

1567
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:23,076
at a Persian place.

1568
01:06:23,207 --> 01:06:24,196
She had to run
across to get him.

1569
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:25,203
The Caspian.

1570
01:06:25,327 --> 01:06:27,318
I go there all the time.

1571
01:06:27,447 --> 01:06:30,598
They have
great chicken kabobs...

1572
01:06:34,487 --> 01:06:36,000
Ed!

1573
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:38,322
Where's the Bag Man?!

1574
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:41,600
MAN, ON RADIO:
All clear.

1575
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:44,287
No one's seen Bag Man.

1576
01:06:44,407 --> 01:06:46,762
He's supposed to be
within 50 feet of the President

1577
01:06:46,887 --> 01:06:48,206
at all times.

1578
01:06:48,327 --> 01:06:50,158
He's not down here.
No one's seen him.

1579
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:51,515
We've got to find him.

1580
01:06:51,647 --> 01:06:53,638
OK. I'll check around.

1581
01:07:02,287 --> 01:07:05,199
(Whistling)

1582
01:07:09,087 --> 01:07:11,681
I found Mr Football.

1583
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:13,286
We've located Bag Man.

1584
01:07:13,407 --> 01:07:15,841
(Whistling)

1585
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:21,880
Who's got time
to read this shit?

1586
01:07:22,007 --> 01:07:23,281
Here. "SIOP."

1587
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:26,046
Single Integrated Operating
Plan for nuclear strike.

1588
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,842
E.M.D.B. L... Electromagnetic
Database Launching System

1589
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:32,879
or Button.

1590
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,885
M.A. O... Major Attack Option.

1591
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:37,235
Is Norad
still on the line?

1592
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:38,277
Is this Norad?

1593
01:07:38,407 --> 01:07:40,284
This is Meese.

1594
01:07:40,407 --> 01:07:42,523
What is happening
in there?

1595
01:07:42,647 --> 01:07:44,603
Al, what are you going
to do? We need more intel.

1596
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,716
Then get it!

1597
01:07:45,847 --> 01:07:46,882
Don't yell
at me, Al.

1598
01:07:47,007 --> 01:07:48,042
I'm doing
the best I can.

1599
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:49,964
I know.

1600
01:07:50,087 --> 01:07:50,963
What's happening?

1601
01:07:51,087 --> 01:07:52,236
Put me on speaker.

1602
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:53,959
Al, hit the button.

1603
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:55,805
The speaker button.

1604
01:07:55,927 --> 01:07:57,758
Ed Meese wants to talk to us.

1605
01:07:57,887 --> 01:07:59,718
Hello, Ed.

1606
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:02,122
The Vice President
is on approach

1607
01:08:02,247 --> 01:08:04,477
to Andrews Air Force base.

1608
01:08:04,607 --> 01:08:05,722
From there he's going

1609
01:08:05,847 --> 01:08:07,121
to helicopter
to the White House.

1610
01:08:07,247 --> 01:08:09,602
Don't do anything
until he gets there.

1611
01:08:09,727 --> 01:08:11,797
Please, don't do

1612
01:08:11,927 --> 01:08:13,246
anything hasty.

1613
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:16,006
The number group.
I need the card.

1614
01:08:16,127 --> 01:08:18,687
That stays with the President.

1615
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:19,842
In his wallet.

1616
01:08:19,967 --> 01:08:21,878
Didn't you guys get it?

1617
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,604
Nothing works without it.

1618
01:08:27,727 --> 01:08:30,924
Holy shit!

1619
01:08:31,047 --> 01:08:32,924
Hey, the President's clothes,

1620
01:08:33,047 --> 01:08:35,117
His wallet, where are they?

1621
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:36,600
Get out of here.
We're operating.

1622
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:38,001
We need his wallet, sir.

1623
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:39,082
What'd you do with it?

1624
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:40,606
We didn't do
anything with it.

1625
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:41,921
Now, get the hell out!

1626
01:08:42,047 --> 01:08:44,481
His clothes were removed
in the code room.

1627
01:08:44,607 --> 01:08:46,006
Emergency.

1628
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:49,759
We had to get him
ready for surgery.

1629
01:08:49,887 --> 01:08:52,117
They were tossed in a pile.

1630
01:08:52,247 --> 01:08:53,805
Soaked in blood.

1631
01:08:53,927 --> 01:08:56,122
I know.

1632
01:08:56,247 --> 01:08:57,885
The FBI guys took it.

1633
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:01,078
We need the wallet, Kirkus.

1634
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:02,686
Presidential property.

1635
01:09:02,807 --> 01:09:04,399
You guys didn't seem
too worried

1636
01:09:04,527 --> 01:09:05,482
about it earlier today.

1637
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:06,562
We need the key card.

1638
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,757
There's a national emergency.

1639
01:09:08,887 --> 01:09:10,081
National emergency,
my ass.

1640
01:09:10,207 --> 01:09:11,879
Give me the wallet!
Hey!

1641
01:09:12,007 --> 01:09:13,440
Hand it over, now, now!

1642
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,159
Hey! Back up! Back up!

1643
01:09:15,287 --> 01:09:18,085
What's going on here?
Put those guns down!

1644
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,402
All we need is somebody
getting killed around here.

1645
01:09:20,527 --> 01:09:21,755
Now, what's this all about?

1646
01:09:21,887 --> 01:09:24,401
The President's nuclear
authorization card, sir.

1647
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:25,596
They won't give it to us.

1648
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:26,876
The SOS needs it
immediately.

1649
01:09:27,007 --> 01:09:27,883
Do you have it?

1650
01:09:28,007 --> 01:09:28,883
Yes, sir.

1651
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:30,042
Well, then hand it over.

1652
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:31,077
It's going to have
to go through

1653
01:09:31,207 --> 01:09:32,686
the proper chain
of command, sir.

1654
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,684
When the Attorney General
gives the order,

1655
01:09:34,807 --> 01:09:36,081
then you can have it.

1656
01:09:36,207 --> 01:09:38,084
I will not give that order.

1657
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,401
Without that card,

1658
01:09:39,527 --> 01:09:41,597
we can't respond
to any threat.

1659
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:42,842
The chain of command

1660
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:44,764
has been completely
disregarded.

1661
01:09:44,887 --> 01:09:46,115
The National
Command Authority

1662
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:47,680
has been violated.

1663
01:09:47,807 --> 01:09:50,367
There's been no invocation
of the 25th Amendment,

1664
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:51,556
which is required

1665
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,757
when the President's
been disabled.

1666
01:09:53,887 --> 01:09:55,081
Constitutionally,

1667
01:09:55,207 --> 01:09:57,767
there's been
a complete meltdown.

1668
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,525
The system has failed.

1669
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:03,435
I will not continue
the insanity.

1670
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:06,081
I've ordered my agents to
proceed here ASAP.

1671
01:10:06,207 --> 01:10:08,562
But no key card will be
turned over

1672
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:10,086
until the Vice President
arrives.

1673
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:11,765
T-minus 15 minutes.

1674
01:10:11,887 --> 01:10:15,436
If this launch is total,
Mr Attorney General,

1675
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:18,604
we'll have exactly 3 minutes
to respond.

1676
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:20,001
3 minutes.

1677
01:10:20,127 --> 01:10:22,960
This is a matter
of national security

1678
01:10:23,087 --> 01:10:25,476
and foreign policy,
neither of which falls

1679
01:10:25,607 --> 01:10:27,359
under the purview
of your authority.

1680
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:29,682
I accept that responsibility.

1681
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:34,676
Tell it to the dead
when the bombs start dropping.

1682
01:10:34,807 --> 01:10:36,559
What have we
learned from Norad?

1683
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:38,439
Satellite intelligence,
what are they reading?

1684
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,797
BUSH: I'm not going
in that chopper.

1685
01:10:40,927 --> 01:10:42,280
Mr Vice President,

1686
01:10:42,407 --> 01:10:44,796
I have specific orders
from General Yates.

1687
01:10:44,927 --> 01:10:47,885
Only the President flies
onto the White House lawn.

1688
01:10:48,007 --> 01:10:49,406
We have a crisis here!

1689
01:10:49,527 --> 01:10:53,042
Not while Rawhide's fighting
for his life. No way!

1690
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:55,840
Sir, we don't have
a police escort,

1691
01:10:55,967 --> 01:10:58,401
and traffic's a bitch
right now.

1692
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:00,006
Well, we better get going.

1693
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:06,636
Go!

1694
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:07,961
Go!

1695
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:18,402
It's the Soviet Ambassador.

1696
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,006
Mr Ambassador.

1697
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:21,355
Mr Secretary.

1698
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,478
The Soviet Socialist
People's Republic

1699
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:26,075
convey deep condolences
toward the American people

1700
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,721
and your President in the hope
that he will fully recover

1701
01:11:28,847 --> 01:11:29,916
from the dastardly deed.

1702
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,686
Yes, thank you,
Mr Ambassador.

1703
01:11:32,807 --> 01:11:34,684
That, by the way,
we had nothing to do with.

1704
01:11:34,807 --> 01:11:36,638
Mr Ambassador...

1705
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:37,882
Call me Anatoly.

1706
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:38,837
Yes, Anatoly.

1707
01:11:38,967 --> 01:11:40,685
And may I call you Al?

1708
01:11:40,807 --> 01:11:42,684
There have been
some unusual moves

1709
01:11:42,807 --> 01:11:45,605
across your borders today

1710
01:11:45,727 --> 01:11:47,399
by your military forces.

1711
01:11:47,527 --> 01:11:49,438
Dick, put him
on speakerphone.

1712
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:52,639
Put him on speaker, Al.

1713
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:56,680
Have your people been having
phone trouble, Al?

1714
01:11:56,807 --> 01:11:57,876
No. Why?

1715
01:11:58,007 --> 01:12:00,316
Just wondering.

1716
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,200
(Recording)
If you'd like to make a call,

1717
01:12:02,327 --> 01:12:05,000
please hang up and try again.

1718
01:12:05,127 --> 01:12:08,199
Christ, he's put Dobrynin
on speaker and cut us off.

1719
01:12:08,327 --> 01:12:09,646
Yeah.

1720
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:12,042
(Tyres screeching)

1721
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:33,525
There are a number of items
that we need to discuss.

1722
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:35,000
This doesn't make
any sense.

1723
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:36,162
Get me the Pentagon.

1724
01:12:36,287 --> 01:12:37,925
What doesn't make
any sense?

1725
01:12:38,047 --> 01:12:39,526
If they were going
for a first strike,

1726
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,285
it'd be from their
submarines off our coast.

1727
01:12:41,407 --> 01:12:42,726
Why launch land-based
missiles

1728
01:12:42,847 --> 01:12:44,041
that allow us time
to retaliate?

1729
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:46,078
And why is Norad
reading a launch

1730
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:48,163
and our satellite intel
sees nothing?

1731
01:12:48,287 --> 01:12:49,163
Hello. Who's this?

1732
01:12:49,287 --> 01:12:50,276
General Cobbs.

1733
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:52,682
General, this is
Secretary Weinberger.

1734
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:54,206
I need you to check
something for me.

1735
01:12:54,327 --> 01:12:56,238
...take advantage
of the present crisis.

1736
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:57,561
Why would we
think that?

1737
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:58,756
When Kennedy was shot,

1738
01:12:58,887 --> 01:13:00,878
your government
was in such chaos,

1739
01:13:01,007 --> 01:13:03,202
we could have launched
multiple strikes,

1740
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:05,966
but we did not
because we are peace-loving.

1741
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:07,884
Haig, ask him
about the missiles.

1742
01:13:08,007 --> 01:13:10,726
Another thing we've noticed
regards your ICBMs, sir.

1743
01:13:10,847 --> 01:13:12,599
ICBMs?

1744
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:16,197
You're not testing a new
missile today, are you?

1745
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:17,999
You are the ones expanding
your nuclear arsenal

1746
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:21,199
with weapons like
MX first-strike missiles

1747
01:13:21,327 --> 01:13:24,000
so cynically called
"peacekeeper."

1748
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:25,606
And your Trident D-5 and...

1749
01:13:25,727 --> 01:13:27,604
Answer the question, please.

1750
01:13:27,727 --> 01:13:31,003
Are you asking if we have
launched an ICBM?

1751
01:13:31,127 --> 01:13:33,925
That's exactly
what I'm asking.

1752
01:13:34,047 --> 01:13:36,925
(Chuckles)

1753
01:13:37,047 --> 01:13:39,003
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1754
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:41,482
You are joking, yes?!

1755
01:13:41,607 --> 01:13:44,883
We are not joking.

1756
01:13:45,007 --> 01:13:46,122
Mr Vice President,

1757
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:47,566
I've been ordered by
the Attorney General

1758
01:13:47,687 --> 01:13:48,676
to turn this
over to you, sir.

1759
01:13:48,807 --> 01:13:49,796
Where's the football?

1760
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:51,076
In the Sit
room, Sir.

1761
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:52,481
I take it you know
all that's going on?

1762
01:13:52,607 --> 01:13:53,483
The Russians,
and...

1763
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:54,437
Yeah, I've been briefed.

1764
01:13:54,567 --> 01:13:55,397
Haig's press
conference...

1765
01:13:55,527 --> 01:13:56,403
I know all about it.

1766
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:57,516
No, it's only been

1767
01:13:57,647 --> 01:13:59,797
a little over 5 minutes.
Thanks.

1768
01:13:59,927 --> 01:14:02,202
Al, cut it off.

1769
01:14:02,327 --> 01:14:04,602
There was a scheduled
simulation today.

1770
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:05,955
Norad should have known.

1771
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:07,076
I just cancelled it.

1772
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:08,925
A simulated
incoming missile attack?

1773
01:14:09,047 --> 01:14:10,480
Are you positive?

1774
01:14:10,607 --> 01:14:11,517
Yes.

1775
01:14:14,087 --> 01:14:15,805
Mr Ambassador?

1776
01:14:15,927 --> 01:14:18,043
We are not conducting
any ICBM test today...

1777
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,600
Thank God
you made it, George.

1778
01:14:19,727 --> 01:14:21,957
I am very concerned
this shooting

1779
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:24,396
has made you all
very paranoid.

1780
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:25,403
We're OK?

1781
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:26,755
Yes, damn it.

1782
01:14:26,887 --> 01:14:28,161
The only thing he denied

1783
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:29,800
was them not having a test.

1784
01:14:29,927 --> 01:14:31,679
He didn't deny
a missile launch.

1785
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,718
Shh!

1786
01:14:33,847 --> 01:14:36,919
Uh, I have to get off
now, Mr Ambassador.

1787
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:38,162
Wait, Al. As for our

1788
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:41,085
activities in Poland,
they are in concert

1789
01:14:41,207 --> 01:14:42,481
with Polish national forces.

1790
01:14:42,607 --> 01:14:44,802
Thank you, Mr Ambassador.

1791
01:14:46,007 --> 01:14:47,122
What did he mean by that?

1792
01:14:47,247 --> 01:14:48,805
REGAN: Something's on
the television, guys.

1793
01:14:48,927 --> 01:14:52,044
You better be right
about this one, Cap.

1794
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:53,520
BUSH: Right about what?
What's going on here?

1795
01:14:53,647 --> 01:14:54,875
You don't
want to know, George.

1796
01:14:56,967 --> 01:14:59,561
This is a special report.

1797
01:14:59,687 --> 01:15:01,006
New York's toast.

1798
01:15:01,127 --> 01:15:03,766
They're broadcasting
from New York.

1799
01:15:03,887 --> 01:15:06,003
ANCHORMAN:
Just into our New York studios,

1800
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:07,401
word from the west coast

1801
01:15:07,527 --> 01:15:08,755
of a very surprising
development.

1802
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:10,036
L.A. Got it?

1803
01:15:10,167 --> 01:15:11,759
Why hit L.A. First?

1804
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:12,922
There is no launch,
General.

1805
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:14,878
The Hollywood community
this evening

1806
01:15:15,007 --> 01:15:16,122
has decided
at the last minute

1807
01:15:16,247 --> 01:15:19,796
to cancel tonight's
Academy Awards ceremony

1808
01:15:19,927 --> 01:15:21,360
out of respect
to President Reagan.

1809
01:15:21,487 --> 01:15:22,761
Jack Valenti, President

1810
01:15:22,887 --> 01:15:24,525
of the Motion Picture
Association of America,

1811
01:15:24,647 --> 01:15:25,762
just announced it.

1812
01:15:25,887 --> 01:15:28,845
Who gives a shit
about the Academy Awards?!

1813
01:15:34,687 --> 01:15:35,836
So he's all right?

1814
01:15:35,967 --> 01:15:37,639
Well, his temperature is
higher than we'd like...

1815
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:38,722
But he's all right?

1816
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:40,439
We have to keep
an eye on it.

1817
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:41,443
If it remains high,

1818
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:42,522
he might have an infection.

1819
01:15:42,647 --> 01:15:43,682
Now, if that occurs,

1820
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:45,001
I might have to perform
a bronchoscopy,

1821
01:15:45,127 --> 01:15:47,402
which is a serious
and involved procedure

1822
01:15:47,527 --> 01:15:48,801
which would require him
to be under heavy sedation.

1823
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:50,406
MEESE:
When can we see him?

1824
01:15:50,527 --> 01:15:52,404
ALLARD: We're willing to allow
Mrs Reagan to see him.

1825
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:53,721
But we don't think
it's a good idea

1826
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:54,882
for too many people
to go in there.

1827
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,804
He's weak, gentlemen...
his condition

1828
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,519
remains critical.

1829
01:15:58,647 --> 01:16:01,366
Yeah, can we
clean up now?

1830
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,758
Good work.
Thanks very much.

1831
01:16:04,887 --> 01:16:06,286
Uh, one other thing,
Doctor...

1832
01:16:06,407 --> 01:16:07,601
The media's been, uh,

1833
01:16:07,727 --> 01:16:08,796
clamouring
for information.

1834
01:16:08,927 --> 01:16:10,758
There are lots of
rumours floating around.

1835
01:16:10,887 --> 01:16:12,605
We'd like to end it all
right now,

1836
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:15,366
issue a progress report,
that kind of thing.

1837
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,476
Um, would either of you

1838
01:16:16,607 --> 01:16:18,404
be available to
make a statement?

1839
01:16:18,527 --> 01:16:19,801
Oh, sure, yeah.
That's no problem.

1840
01:16:19,927 --> 01:16:21,076
We just need
a simple statement.

1841
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:22,435
How well he's doing,

1842
01:16:22,567 --> 01:16:23,443
how it could have been
a lot more serious,

1843
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:24,636
when he'll be
back to work...

1844
01:16:24,767 --> 01:16:25,995
you know,
that kind of thing.

1845
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:27,560
You a doctor, Mr Deaver?

1846
01:16:27,687 --> 01:16:28,915
Of course not.

1847
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:30,321
Then why are you
telling us

1848
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:31,675
the condition
of the patient?

1849
01:16:31,807 --> 01:16:32,922
Now, look,
the country needs

1850
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,321
to have its fears
put to rest.

1851
01:16:34,447 --> 01:16:35,516
A simple statement
is all.

1852
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:36,875
GREGORIO: Let me tell
you guys something.

1853
01:16:37,007 --> 01:16:37,996
If this
Secret Service agent

1854
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:39,276
hadn't brought him
here right away,

1855
01:16:39,407 --> 01:16:40,522
the President would be
dead right now,

1856
01:16:40,647 --> 01:16:41,682
and there's no question
about it.

1857
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:43,399
And he's not
out of the woods yet.

1858
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:44,880
So you won't make
a statement?

1859
01:16:45,007 --> 01:16:46,235
Oh, these guys...

1860
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:48,562
I won't lie,
and neither will Dr Allard.

1861
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,484
(Respirator pumping)

1862
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:52,723
(Monitor beeping)

1863
01:17:21,607 --> 01:17:22,596
Who is that?

1864
01:17:22,727 --> 01:17:24,001
Hey!

1865
01:17:27,847 --> 01:17:28,757
Hey...

1866
01:17:28,887 --> 01:17:30,002
Who are you?

1867
01:17:30,127 --> 01:17:31,321
Shh.

1868
01:17:40,647 --> 01:17:41,523
He's dead!

1869
01:17:41,647 --> 01:17:42,796
Can you hear me?

1870
01:17:42,927 --> 01:17:44,599
Reagan's dead!

1871
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:46,642
Reagan's dead!

1872
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:49,362
He's dead!

1873
01:17:52,407 --> 01:17:53,362
It's not
true, Nancy.

1874
01:17:53,487 --> 01:17:55,000
He's in recovery,
he's stabilized.

1875
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:56,355
The doctors
are on top of it.

1876
01:17:56,487 --> 01:17:57,602
Yeah, I've been told

1877
01:17:57,727 --> 01:17:59,206
you'll be able to see
him real soon, ma'am.

1878
01:17:59,327 --> 01:18:00,760
How soon?

1879
01:18:00,887 --> 01:18:02,002
REPORTER:
Is it true?

1880
01:18:02,127 --> 01:18:03,401
You're not going
to report this, are you?

1881
01:18:03,527 --> 01:18:04,596
Is it true?

1882
01:18:04,727 --> 01:18:05,842
Certainly not.

1883
01:18:05,967 --> 01:18:07,320
They removed the bullet.

1884
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:08,482
He's doing fine.

1885
01:18:08,607 --> 01:18:09,676
The First Lady
will go up and see him.

1886
01:18:09,807 --> 01:18:10,637
When do we see him?

1887
01:18:10,767 --> 01:18:11,643
Not yet, OK?

1888
01:18:11,767 --> 01:18:13,519
Then we go
with the story.

1889
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,842
What story?
There is no story.

1890
01:18:15,967 --> 01:18:17,400
We need... I think
the country needs...

1891
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,358
some kind of proof that
the President is still alive.

1892
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:20,966
Let me just go up there
with a minicam crew...

1893
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:22,520
we'll put all
these rumours to rest.

1894
01:18:22,647 --> 01:18:26,640
You already screwed up
once, real bad.

1895
01:18:26,767 --> 01:18:28,405
Just ask
Sarah Brady.

1896
01:18:28,527 --> 01:18:29,721
Now, how bad do you think
it's going to look

1897
01:18:29,847 --> 01:18:31,166
if you misreport
the death of a President,

1898
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:32,163
much less my husband?

1899
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:33,879
Shut up!
With all...

1900
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:41,880
Mike...

1901
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:46,966
The Bushes arrived
at the White House.

1902
01:18:47,087 --> 01:18:49,601
We got Russian moves
into Poland.

1903
01:18:50,207 --> 01:18:52,880
YATES: Now, we've also
noted an increase

1904
01:18:53,007 --> 01:18:54,884
in coded radio transmissions

1905
01:18:55,007 --> 01:18:58,238
and military transport flights
into Soviet occupied

1906
01:18:58,367 --> 01:18:59,880
airfields inside Poland.

1907
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:00,883
So they're in.

1908
01:19:01,007 --> 01:19:02,042
Yes, sir,
they're in.

1909
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:03,600
This is what Dobrynin
was getting at.

1910
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:05,080
He thought we were calling
about their troop moves,

1911
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,606
not some phantom
nuclear strike.

1912
01:19:06,727 --> 01:19:08,683
BAKER, OVER SPEAKERPHONE:
The President's condition

1913
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:10,798
will necessitate another
involved medical procedure

1914
01:19:10,927 --> 01:19:12,201
requiring heavy sedation.

1915
01:19:12,327 --> 01:19:15,205
If this is, indeed, the invasion
we've been expecting,

1916
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:17,887
we've got to make
some hard decisions.

1917
01:19:18,007 --> 01:19:19,918
Uh...
this is no invasion.

1918
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,765
What would you call it, Cap?

1919
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:24,276
Dropping in for
a neighbourly cup of coffee?

1920
01:19:24,407 --> 01:19:27,001
BAKER: Could we try
sticking to the point?

1921
01:19:27,127 --> 01:19:29,561
They've still got
200,000 troops, tanks,

1922
01:19:29,687 --> 01:19:31,006
and armoured
personnel carriers

1923
01:19:31,127 --> 01:19:33,357
sitting along the border
with no indication of movement.

1924
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:35,842
There's no other
hostilities either.

1925
01:19:35,967 --> 01:19:37,195
It's a preparatory phase.

1926
01:19:37,327 --> 01:19:39,363
And no matter what you call it,
an invasion's begun.

1927
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:40,681
Fact is, the Russians
already have,

1928
01:19:40,807 --> 01:19:41,683
and have had
for some time

1929
01:19:41,807 --> 01:19:43,320
thousands of
military advisers

1930
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:45,722
working closely with
Jaruzelski's national troops.

1931
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:49,681
You're talking
to a soldier, OK?

1932
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:53,286
Jim, Jim...

1933
01:19:53,407 --> 01:19:55,284
Get Bush over here
so we can deal with him

1934
01:19:55,407 --> 01:19:56,283
one on one.

1935
01:19:56,407 --> 01:19:57,601
Keep Haig out of it.

1936
01:19:57,727 --> 01:19:59,319
Yeah. George?
George, you there?

1937
01:19:59,447 --> 01:20:02,280
Uh, yeah, I'm here, Jim.

1938
01:20:02,407 --> 01:20:04,841
Well, I think it might be better
to come to the hospital.

1939
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,719
I mean, we got
the succession to deal with

1940
01:20:06,847 --> 01:20:08,280
and how we're going to
handle the press.

1941
01:20:08,407 --> 01:20:09,681
Any issue of succession

1942
01:20:09,807 --> 01:20:11,206
should be dealt with
with all of

1943
01:20:11,327 --> 01:20:13,045
the Cabinet members
present.

1944
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:14,077
Al's right, Jim.

1945
01:20:14,207 --> 01:20:15,196
We're all here.

1946
01:20:15,327 --> 01:20:16,999
Might as well
discuss it now.

1947
01:20:17,127 --> 01:20:18,606
He's not coming.

1948
01:20:18,727 --> 01:20:20,160
The fact is,
Mr Vice President,

1949
01:20:20,287 --> 01:20:22,755
you're going to have to talk
to the media yourself.

1950
01:20:22,887 --> 01:20:24,240
Not tonight,
tomorrow morning.

1951
01:20:24,367 --> 01:20:26,517
The media's going to want
to know who's in charge.

1952
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:28,922
And we can't give out any more
incorrect statements.

1953
01:20:29,047 --> 01:20:30,719
Exactly.

1954
01:20:30,847 --> 01:20:32,883
And if I say the President
is running things,

1955
01:20:33,007 --> 01:20:34,520
they're going to want proof.

1956
01:20:34,647 --> 01:20:37,081
Two networks have already asked
for a video crew to go up.

1957
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:40,199
This is the exactly what
the 25th Amendment is all about.

1958
01:20:40,327 --> 01:20:42,158
The President transfers
power until he recovers.

1959
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:46,246
The Vice President
becomes the Acting President.

1960
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:48,676
Invoking the amendment
is dangerous.

1961
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:50,604
Dangerous?

1962
01:20:50,727 --> 01:20:52,763
It's Constitutional.

1963
01:20:52,887 --> 01:20:54,286
It'll raise doubts and fears

1964
01:20:54,407 --> 01:20:57,205
about the true nature of
the President's condition.

1965
01:20:57,327 --> 01:20:59,283
Our allies will become
worried about the future,

1966
01:20:59,407 --> 01:21:00,635
and our enemies,

1967
01:21:00,767 --> 01:21:02,837
especially given
what happened here today,

1968
01:21:02,967 --> 01:21:04,082
may become
more adventurous.

1969
01:21:04,207 --> 01:21:06,038
The media
will twist it around.

1970
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:07,759
When the President recovers,

1971
01:21:07,887 --> 01:21:11,243
I'll be accused
of usurping the government.

1972
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:12,800
I don't like it.

1973
01:21:12,927 --> 01:21:15,805
That amendment is
a legalized coup d'etat.

1974
01:21:17,887 --> 01:21:19,081
If enacted, the powers

1975
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,596
of the Office could be
forever diminished.

1976
01:21:21,727 --> 01:21:23,718
Now...

1977
01:21:23,847 --> 01:21:26,281
I say that we just sit tight
for a couple of days

1978
01:21:26,407 --> 01:21:29,126
until the President's able
to make a statement.

1979
01:21:29,247 --> 01:21:31,158
MEESE: What's the itinerary
for tomorrow?

1980
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:32,481
Uh, here.

1981
01:21:32,607 --> 01:21:34,245
Well, the Dairy Bill's
up for signing,

1982
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:36,881
and the Prime Minister of
the Netherlands is in town.

1983
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:38,679
I mean, based on what
the doctors

1984
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:40,445
have just told me,
the President's going to be

1985
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:43,001
under anaesthesia
and painkillers for days.

1986
01:21:46,647 --> 01:21:49,957
I have the answer.

1987
01:21:50,087 --> 01:21:52,601
It's simple, really.

1988
01:21:52,727 --> 01:21:53,876
Who's that?

1989
01:21:54,007 --> 01:21:55,440
I'm the Security
agent, sir.

1990
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:56,966
I'm in charge
of the room.

1991
01:21:57,087 --> 01:22:00,124
I think I have
a solution to our problem.

1992
01:22:00,247 --> 01:22:03,478
Edith Wilson.

1993
01:22:03,607 --> 01:22:05,086
What are you
talking about?

1994
01:22:05,207 --> 01:22:06,845
Well, you see,
Mrs Reagan,

1995
01:22:06,967 --> 01:22:08,844
she was Woodrow Wilson's
First Lady,

1996
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:10,241
and when he had a stroke,

1997
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:12,164
she got his signature
on things...

1998
01:22:12,287 --> 01:22:13,197
kind of filled in
for him.

1999
01:22:13,327 --> 01:22:14,203
Ronnie's
had a stroke?

2000
01:22:14,327 --> 01:22:15,396
No, no.
God, no, Nancy.

2001
01:22:15,527 --> 01:22:16,562
He's doing much better.

2002
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:17,722
And you're going
to get to see him.

2003
01:22:17,847 --> 01:22:19,121
But we just need you
to help us out here

2004
01:22:19,247 --> 01:22:20,475
because we...

2005
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:21,801
Why are you giving me
a history lesson?

2006
01:22:21,927 --> 01:22:23,201
If you'd let me
see my husband,

2007
01:22:23,327 --> 01:22:24,760
I'll do anything
you want.

2008
01:22:34,567 --> 01:22:36,797
May I speak
to you privately?

2009
01:22:38,247 --> 01:22:39,123
Sure.

2010
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:41,078
How about
we step outside?

2011
01:22:51,727 --> 01:22:52,682
All right, George.

2012
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:53,683
I know I'm

2013
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:54,876
No Constitutional
authority,

2014
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:56,963
but everything that's
being said in there

2015
01:22:57,087 --> 01:22:58,884
is in direct violation
of the 25th Amendment.

2016
01:22:59,007 --> 01:22:59,883
Now, hold on...

2017
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:01,076
Let me finish.

2018
01:23:01,207 --> 01:23:03,084
That amendment was
designed specifically

2019
01:23:03,207 --> 01:23:04,640
for situations like this.

2020
01:23:04,767 --> 01:23:07,042
You should be making all
the executive decisions.

2021
01:23:07,167 --> 01:23:08,839
I realize what you're saying,

2022
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:12,437
but the Vice President has
a certain stand-in authority.

2023
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:14,398
Then what is the point
of the 25th Amendment?

2024
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:16,802
We are talking
about official

2025
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:17,882
executive power.

2026
01:23:18,007 --> 01:23:19,998
The amendment should
be invoked now.

2027
01:23:20,487 --> 01:23:21,886
I understand all that.

2028
01:23:22,007 --> 01:23:24,840
But like I said,
there are other considerations.

2029
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:26,446
You're goddamn
right there are.

2030
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:28,046
The Troika's going
to resist

2031
01:23:28,167 --> 01:23:29,202
any transfer of power

2032
01:23:29,327 --> 01:23:30,760
because as long
as the President

2033
01:23:30,887 --> 01:23:31,842
is incapable,

2034
01:23:31,967 --> 01:23:33,446
they are running
this government.

2035
01:23:33,567 --> 01:23:35,080
And that's
what they want.

2036
01:23:35,207 --> 01:23:36,196
And guess what, Al.

2037
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:37,999
They're the ones
that brought it up.

2038
01:23:38,127 --> 01:23:40,721
Goddamn it, George!
They are staff!

2039
01:23:40,847 --> 01:23:44,123
They have no Constitutional
authority!

2040
01:23:44,247 --> 01:23:45,885
I got to get back
in there.

2041
01:23:46,007 --> 01:23:47,725
You know...
I have been accused

2042
01:23:47,847 --> 01:23:49,121
of making a power play.

2043
01:23:49,247 --> 01:23:51,078
They're the ones
who are making it,

2044
01:23:51,207 --> 01:23:54,165
and you know I'm right.

2045
01:24:01,087 --> 01:24:04,045
Oh, I'm here, Ronnie.

2046
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:06,681
I'm here for you.

2047
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:09,924
The doctors say
you're going to make it.

2048
01:24:10,047 --> 01:24:11,366
(Groans)

2049
01:24:11,487 --> 01:24:13,045
God.

2050
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,840
I've been praying so.

2051
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,401
Nancy...

2052
01:24:18,527 --> 01:24:19,676
What?

2053
01:24:19,807 --> 01:24:21,923
What, Mike?

2054
01:24:22,047 --> 01:24:23,844
Remember what
we talked about.

2055
01:24:25,887 --> 01:24:27,718
Darling...

2056
01:24:27,847 --> 01:24:32,125
I'm sorry to trouble
you with this,

2057
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:34,397
but the country
has to know

2058
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:36,279
that you're doing well,

2059
01:24:36,407 --> 01:24:40,241
and so, can you sign...

2060
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,642
here, I'm putting a pen...

2061
01:24:42,767 --> 01:24:44,962
here's a pen. Hold that.

2062
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:47,840
This is the Dairy Bill.

2063
01:24:47,967 --> 01:24:49,844
You have to sign it.

2064
01:24:49,967 --> 01:24:51,036
The Dairy Bill?

2065
01:24:51,167 --> 01:24:52,156
Here.

2066
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:53,640
Farm support, sir.

2067
01:24:53,767 --> 01:24:55,325
It's due to be signed today.

2068
01:24:55,447 --> 01:24:58,325
We want to show
that you're up to it.

2069
01:24:58,447 --> 01:25:00,244
You think you can...

2070
01:25:00,367 --> 01:25:04,076
Here, I'll hold...
I'll hold right from here.

2071
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:12,037
Thank you.

2072
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:21,806
Nancy...

2073
01:25:21,927 --> 01:25:22,837
What?

2074
01:25:22,967 --> 01:25:24,161
Try again.

2075
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:26,164
That's enough.
He's too weak.

2076
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,686
Just try it once more.

2077
01:25:27,807 --> 01:25:29,286
He's too...
that's enough.

2078
01:25:29,407 --> 01:25:30,601
Enough.

2079
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,079
Darling, it's OK.

2080
01:25:34,207 --> 01:25:36,004
Nurse, could you...

2081
01:25:36,127 --> 01:25:39,756
They're going to move him
up to recovery soon.

2082
01:25:39,887 --> 01:25:42,276
We need to get
some lights up there.

2083
01:25:42,407 --> 01:25:44,363
I want to get
a picture.

2084
01:25:57,087 --> 01:25:58,122
Ohh...

2085
01:25:58,247 --> 01:26:00,044
Mike, I want this
photograph cropped,

2086
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:01,316
do you understand?

2087
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:03,597
My husband is President
of the United States.

2088
01:26:03,727 --> 01:26:05,922
I will not have him
looking like an invalid.

2089
01:26:06,047 --> 01:26:08,038
He's not going to look
like an invalid, Nancy.

2090
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:10,283
Sweetheart? Ronnie?

2091
01:26:10,407 --> 01:26:12,045
You've got to just smile.

2092
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,043
All right,
there you go.

2093
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:14,043
Big smile, honey.

2094
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:15,043
Look there,
look there.

2095
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:16,202
Smile, honey.

2096
01:26:16,327 --> 01:26:18,204
Wait till I'm out.
Smile. That's it.

2097
01:26:18,327 --> 01:26:20,716
Thank you, Ronnie.
Smile, smile.

2098
01:26:20,847 --> 01:26:22,200
Smile...

2099
01:26:22,327 --> 01:26:24,522
Wait, wait, please.
Not while I'm in it.

2100
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,638
Smile. Iook there.
Look here, Ronnie.

2101
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:28,120
Would you wait
till I'm out of it?

2102
01:26:28,247 --> 01:26:29,600
Yes, ma'am.

2103
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:33,083
OK, now... OK,
smile, smile, darling.

2104
01:26:33,207 --> 01:26:34,083
Smile, smile.

2105
01:26:34,207 --> 01:26:36,641
Honey, here I am.

2106
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:37,836
Here I am. Smile.

2107
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:38,877
Hello, darling.

2108
01:26:39,007 --> 01:26:39,996
Stop. Stop it.
That's it.

2109
01:26:40,127 --> 01:26:41,242
Mike, this is not
going to work.

2110
01:26:41,367 --> 01:26:42,959
We're going to take
a lot of pictures.

2111
01:26:43,087 --> 01:26:44,486
What about the machines
and the crap...

2112
01:26:44,607 --> 01:26:45,642
All the tubes...

2113
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:46,643
It'll be fine.

2114
01:26:46,767 --> 01:26:47,836
Mike, I can't...
It's just...

2115
01:26:47,967 --> 01:26:49,002
Nancy, why do you think
I'm doing this?

2116
01:26:49,127 --> 01:26:50,242
I don't like this
any more than you do,

2117
01:26:50,367 --> 01:26:51,243
but we don't
have a choice.

2118
01:26:51,367 --> 01:26:52,641
I know that.

2119
01:26:52,767 --> 01:26:54,280
If the press gets wind
of all the fuck-ups

2120
01:26:54,407 --> 01:26:55,681
that went on
around here today,

2121
01:26:55,807 --> 01:26:56,717
they'll be all over us.

2122
01:26:56,847 --> 01:26:57,836
You're right.

2123
01:26:57,967 --> 01:26:59,036
They didn't
vote for the man.

2124
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:00,600
You're right.
You're right. Sorry.

2125
01:27:00,727 --> 01:27:02,160
Then help me
protect him, please.

2126
01:27:04,287 --> 01:27:06,562
I'm so sorry, darling.

2127
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:07,756
I'm so sorry.

2128
01:27:07,887 --> 01:27:10,640
Could you just try
to smile one more time?

2129
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:11,722
That's it, smile.

2130
01:27:11,847 --> 01:27:13,997
Thank you, sweetheart,
thank you.

2131
01:27:15,887 --> 01:27:17,240
That's perfect.

2132
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:18,686
But it's enough.

2133
01:27:18,807 --> 01:27:21,446
Now, can you please
leave my husband alone?

2134
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:22,477
(Sighs)

2135
01:27:22,607 --> 01:27:25,519
Mr Meese,
if you were...

2136
01:27:25,647 --> 01:27:27,239
distressed...

2137
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,516
why so?

2138
01:27:28,647 --> 01:27:29,875
(Chuckles)

2139
01:27:30,007 --> 01:27:31,679
I want to make it clear

2140
01:27:31,807 --> 01:27:35,243
that none of us were distressed
with Al Haig in any way.

2141
01:27:35,367 --> 01:27:37,437
There wasn't one second
when there was a lack

2142
01:27:37,567 --> 01:27:38,682
of anybody in charge.

2143
01:27:38,807 --> 01:27:40,240
Al thought it was important

2144
01:27:40,367 --> 01:27:41,880
that we reassure our allies

2145
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,202
and other people that there
was a continuity of government.

2146
01:27:44,327 --> 01:27:46,045
I personally had
discussions with Haig

2147
01:27:46,167 --> 01:27:47,839
in which we agreed
that he would be

2148
01:27:47,967 --> 01:27:49,525
our point of contact

2149
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:51,239
in the Situation Room
of the White House.

2150
01:27:51,367 --> 01:27:52,959
Which he quite
properly should be

2151
01:27:53,087 --> 01:27:54,645
as senior
Cabinet Officer.

2152
01:27:54,767 --> 01:27:55,995
Now, what about these rumours

2153
01:27:56,127 --> 01:27:57,765
that he's now
persona non grata?

2154
01:27:57,887 --> 01:28:00,481
Well, it's Washington, Ted.

2155
01:28:00,607 --> 01:28:01,960
What do you expect?

2156
01:28:02,087 --> 01:28:04,203
Al Haig is
Secretary of State...

2157
01:28:04,327 --> 01:28:07,080
until Ronald Reagan
decides different.

2158
01:28:18,367 --> 01:28:19,800
Mr Vice President,

2159
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:22,487
I will be in my office
if you need me.

2160
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:23,801
We're going
to the hospital.

2161
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:25,042
You're welcome
to come with us

2162
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:26,156
if you like.

2163
01:28:26,287 --> 01:28:27,515
No, that's all right.

2164
01:28:27,647 --> 01:28:29,205
I'll visit the President
when he's better.

2165
01:28:29,327 --> 01:28:30,396
In the morning,

2166
01:28:30,527 --> 01:28:31,846
I think it would be
a good idea

2167
01:28:31,967 --> 01:28:33,195
if we had
a Cabinet meeting.

2168
01:28:33,327 --> 01:28:34,396
Let the world know

2169
01:28:34,527 --> 01:28:35,403
we're going about
our business.

2170
01:28:35,527 --> 01:28:36,403
I'll be there.

2171
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:37,562
Before you leave, Al,

2172
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:38,642
there's some things
we need to clarify.

2173
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:41,759
The press is going
to ask questions.

2174
01:28:41,887 --> 01:28:45,038
Yes, well,
that's their job, Cap.

2175
01:28:45,167 --> 01:28:48,842
Uh, yeah, I guess
they're going to ask me

2176
01:28:48,967 --> 01:28:51,083
to explain my... my crime...

2177
01:28:51,207 --> 01:28:53,118
my... gaffe...

2178
01:28:53,247 --> 01:28:55,920
my poor choice of words.

2179
01:28:56,047 --> 01:28:58,038
What are you
going to say?

2180
01:28:58,167 --> 01:28:59,885
We need to know.

2181
01:29:00,007 --> 01:29:01,804
Yeah.

2182
01:29:01,927 --> 01:29:04,680
Yeah, well, I guess
you're worried

2183
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:06,035
that I'll attribute
my mistakes

2184
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:07,395
to the mistakes

2185
01:29:07,527 --> 01:29:09,961
of another responsible
party in this room

2186
01:29:10,087 --> 01:29:11,486
who unnecessarily
placed us

2187
01:29:11,607 --> 01:29:14,075
in a war condition.

2188
01:29:14,207 --> 01:29:17,916
Or that I'll reveal that
we couldn't communicate

2189
01:29:18,047 --> 01:29:19,844
from the Op Centre.

2190
01:29:19,967 --> 01:29:22,401
Or that we couldn't
find the man

2191
01:29:22,527 --> 01:29:24,563
with the football,

2192
01:29:24,687 --> 01:29:27,121
and that we lost
the nuclear code card.

2193
01:29:27,247 --> 01:29:28,919
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2194
01:29:29,047 --> 01:29:32,517
Or that we are presently
engaged in a deception

2195
01:29:32,647 --> 01:29:35,366
regarding
the President's health

2196
01:29:35,487 --> 01:29:37,443
in order to cover up
who is

2197
01:29:37,567 --> 01:29:40,320
or who is not running
the country.

2198
01:29:40,447 --> 01:29:44,520
You're not going to...
say all that, are you, Al?

2199
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:49,446
No.

2200
01:29:49,567 --> 01:29:51,842
No.

2201
01:29:51,967 --> 01:29:54,083
Like the good soldier
that I am,

2202
01:29:54,207 --> 01:29:57,643
I'll be happy to...
fall on my sword.

2203
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,842
Good night,
gentlemen.

2204
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,481
REPORTER: Who's been making
executive decisions?

2205
01:30:32,607 --> 01:30:34,040
President Reagan
has maintained

2206
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:35,885
formal Presidential
power throughout.

2207
01:30:36,007 --> 01:30:37,725
You've seen the copy
of the Dairy Bill

2208
01:30:37,847 --> 01:30:38,916
he signed this morning.

2209
01:30:39,047 --> 01:30:40,446
Handwriting's pretty
shaky on that, Larry.

2210
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:42,842
I didn't know you were
a handwriting expert, Leslie.

2211
01:30:42,967 --> 01:30:44,241
I want to make it clear

2212
01:30:44,367 --> 01:30:45,641
that there was
not one second

2213
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:47,598
when there was a lack
of anybody being in charge.

2214
01:30:47,727 --> 01:30:49,240
The government
did not skip a beat.

2215
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:52,598
Mr Bush, what is your
status right now, technically?

2216
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:54,319
I'm the Vice President.

2217
01:30:54,447 --> 01:30:55,960
Are you standing in
for the President?

2218
01:30:56,087 --> 01:30:57,281
No, I'm not.

2219
01:30:57,407 --> 01:30:59,921
The President
is the President, Sam.

2220
01:31:00,047 --> 01:31:02,959
So when do we get
to see the President?

2221
01:31:03,087 --> 01:31:04,520
There you are.

2222
01:31:04,647 --> 01:31:06,285
Pass those around,
would you?

2223
01:31:06,407 --> 01:31:08,238
As you can see
from the photo, folks,

2224
01:31:08,367 --> 01:31:09,561
all is clearly well.

2225
01:31:10,087 --> 01:31:12,362
REPORTER: So if a decision
of national security

2226
01:31:12,487 --> 01:31:15,047
needed to be made
at this moment, he could do it?

2227
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:17,362
BUSH: The President is
completely with it,

2228
01:31:17,487 --> 01:31:18,363
completely capable

2229
01:31:18,487 --> 01:31:20,443
of taking actions.

2230
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,444
NARRATOR:
2 weeks after the shooting,

2231
01:31:31,567 --> 01:31:33,046
President Reagan
was discharged

2232
01:31:33,167 --> 01:31:34,998
from
George Washington Hospital.

2233
01:31:35,127 --> 01:31:37,846
Although it was reported
that he was completely healthy

2234
01:31:37,967 --> 01:31:39,605
and returning
to a full schedule,

2235
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:41,240
the President continued
to experience

2236
01:31:41,367 --> 01:31:42,356
pain and discomfort

2237
01:31:42,487 --> 01:31:44,398
and was not fully recovered

2238
01:31:44,527 --> 01:31:46,245
until mid-summer of 1981...

2239
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:48,961
nearly 4 months
after the attack.

2240
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:51,078
John Hinckley was found
not guilty

2241
01:31:51,207 --> 01:31:53,596
in the shooting
of President Reagan

2242
01:31:53,727 --> 01:31:55,080
by reason of insanity

2243
01:31:55,207 --> 01:31:56,606
and has been confined
to a mental hospital.

2244
01:31:56,727 --> 01:31:58,126
The stranger who entered

2245
01:31:58,247 --> 01:31:59,965
George Washington
University Hospital

2246
01:32:00,087 --> 01:32:02,237
was a failed medical student
hoping to be reinstated

2247
01:32:02,367 --> 01:32:04,358
by saving
the President's life.

2248
01:32:04,487 --> 01:32:06,682
Deemed harmless
by the Secret Service,

2249
01:32:06,807 --> 01:32:08,843
he was later released.

2250
01:32:08,967 --> 01:32:11,765
James Brady never fully
recovered from the shooting.

2251
01:32:11,887 --> 01:32:15,357
He has become a leading
advocate for gun control.

2252
01:32:15,487 --> 01:32:17,876
The following year,
after persistent questions

2253
01:32:18,007 --> 01:32:19,838
pertaining to his handling
of the crisis,

2254
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:22,242
Alexander Haig
formally resigned

2255
01:32:22,367 --> 01:32:24,198
as Secretary of State.

2256
01:32:24,327 --> 01:32:27,842
He has never returned
to public service.
