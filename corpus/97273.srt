1
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,019
Containment breach!
We've had a major containment breach!

2
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:08,782
Oh, my God.

3
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,933
The security system
appears to be malfunctioning!

4
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:14,095
Seal the base, Campion!
lf the main gate's still open, shut it!

5
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:15,218
Yes, sir.

6
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,339
People are dying like flies down here!

7
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:19,414
Use the manual gate override, Campion!

8
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:21,175
Do it now, do it now!

9
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:22,662
Sally. Baby Lavon.

10
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,813
Campion! This is a Code Red!

11
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,575
We've lost one of the bugs!

12
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:29,018
Repeat, we have lost one of the bugs!

13
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,900
You have to close the gate!

14
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:34,813
Sally!

15
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,182
Charlie?

16
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:39,180
-We gotta get out of here.
-What's going on?

17
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:41,060
You know what.
Get the baby stuff, let's go!

18
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:42,496
-Oh, my God!
-Come on! Let's go!

19
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,301
-l'm coming!
-Let's go! Come on!

20
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,301
Give me the baby!

21
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,461
All right, let's go.

22
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:14,897
Slow down, Charlie.

23
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:20,375
Charlie, slow down!

24
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:26,499
Charlie, you'll get us all killed!

25
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:36,338
Sorry, baby.

26
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:14,814
Blackout!

27
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:22,214
And now, here is the host ofBlackout,
Bob Goen.

28
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:06,054
Coming up next,
we got Kathi Kamen Goldmark...

29
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:08,452
America 's new country sweetheart.

30
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,056
Sure wish she was my sweetheart.

31
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,099
Why don't you listen to me, old man?

32
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:15,061
Been listening to you
more than 20 years now, ain't l?

33
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,611
All that wisdom and l ain't rich yet.

34
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:21,496
Yeah, well, if you learned
some simple economics.

35
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:25,701
Old man Vic thinks simple economics...

36
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:29,018
is some new breed of lrishman.

37
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,616
Ain't you ignorant!

38
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:33,012
Licking the glue off the back
of them food stamps...

39
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:34,980
has finally done something to your brain.

40
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,657
Well, l got to feed your daughter, don't l?

41
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,416
Shut off the pumps.

42
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,342
Look at him, Stu.

43
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:21,653
You don't think he did that to his face
falling out of the car, do you?

44
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:23,017
l doubt it.

45
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:31,098
Just take it easy now. Calm down.

46
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:36,018
Hap! Phone rescue services
in Braintree now.

47
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:37,297
Hurry up! Go on!

48
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:42,380
Just take it easy, friend.
lt's gonna be all right.

49
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:44,931
Just lie still now. lt's all right.

50
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:51,734
lt's gonna be all right.

51
00:08:58,143 --> 00:09:00,099
Ambulance will be here in 10 minutes.

52
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,981
My wife and my baby are sick.
They need help.

53
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:06,342
Help my wife and my baby.
They're sick, they need help!

54
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,779
Okay, mister, they're fine.
You just want to sit right there.

55
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,020
The ambulance is on its way.

56
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:15,057
We didn't get out in time after all.

57
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,738
You just try to rest yourself, okay?
Just take it easy now.

58
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:23,895
Gate malfunctioned, otherwise
we would've died in the compound.

59
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:25,536
Project Blue.

60
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:31,581
Get his head over to the side, Stu.
He's gonna choke.

61
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:34,302
Get your head down.

62
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:37,977
Come on.

63
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:42,212
Like l told you!

64
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:44,692
l ain't got time to throw a line
over that dog's head!

65
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,296
You mind me now!

66
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:48,615
What's he got? You got any idea?

67
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:51,376
Maybe it's food poisoning.
He's got California plates here.

68
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:55,138
Maybe he got some bad chow
at a roadside stand or something.

69
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,255
l hope you're right.

70
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:00,062
l seen cholera back in '58
down near Nogales.

71
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:01,735
This is what it looks like.

72
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:05,133
Sally and the baby,
they were sick since Salt Lake City...

73
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:07,657
but l felt fine until this morning.

74
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,742
Are you sure Sally and my baby are okay?

75
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:15,174
There was a man with us
some of the time.

76
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:17,538
He was a dark man.

77
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,693
l was looking through
the rear-view mirror...

78
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:24,138
and l'd see him just sitting there
grinning at me.

79
00:10:25,383 --> 00:10:27,294
l thought l could outrun him...

80
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,418
but you can't outrun the dark man.

81
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,500
Not now. Hilly, put this on the wall.

82
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:30,852
Come.

83
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:33,692
General Starkey, sir!

84
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:36,377
Close the door and drop the bull, Len.

85
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,657
Yes, sir.

86
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:42,133
lt killed them in a hurry down there.

87
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:45,101
Telemetry suggests even the ones
who got their respirators on...

88
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:47,014
died within 12 minutes.

89
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:50,300
The rest of them were gone in five.
You believe that?

90
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,294
-Do l have a choice?
-No.

91
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:54,574
Apparently none of us do.

92
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:58,695
lt's nothing but a souped-up version
of the flu.

93
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,937
Herbert Denninger
of the National Disease Control Center...

94
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:05,299
the Pentagon's bright boy of the week,
says once we find Campion...

95
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:07,851
we'll know if it's actually
going to jump to the outside.

96
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:11,094
He says it might mutate, but that won't
help the people that catch it.

97
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:15,574
-Listen, l have what might be something--
-lt'll just take them longer to die, that's all.

98
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:19,338
Most people are gonna think
they've got the plain old non-lethal flu...

99
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:21,334
right up to the very end.

100
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:24,541
And that's the biggest break
we've had so far.

101
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:28,252
All because a gate malfunctioned,
and some glorified TV repairman...

102
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:30,299
got his family and ran for the hills.

103
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,180
l'd like to get him and string him up by--

104
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:34,094
We found him. We located Campion.

105
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:36,378
He crash-landed at a gas station
on the outskirts...

106
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:39,023
of a one-stoplight town in east Texas.

107
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:41,663
He made it halfway across the country?

108
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:43,096
-How'd he do that?
-l don't know.

109
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:46,539
The important thing is, right now,
we've got a shot at containing this.

110
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:48,693
-ls he dead or alive?
-He's dead.

111
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:51,297
Denninger says this stuff
has a communicability level...

112
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:53,851
of over 99%.
Do you understand what that means?

113
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,332
Any chance we had of containing it
went by the boards...

114
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:58,732
when Campion bought
his first takeout hamburger.

115
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,298
We can't think that way, Billy.

116
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:08,097
Yeah, you're right. Of course you are.

117
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:11,700
-What about the rest of his family?
-They're dead, sir.

118
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,380
-Contact with townspeople was minimal.
-That doesn't matter.

119
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,897
We gotta shut that town down,
lock it up...

120
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,177
dig a moat around it.

121
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:23,175
That operation's already
on the launching pad, sir.

122
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,500
-What kind of coverage you come up with?
-Anthrax.

123
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,777
New strain.

124
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:33,454
Yeah, it's a new one, all right.
lt's real new.

125
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:37,738
lt's very good at its job, too. Too good.

126
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:45,733
-lt's bad, General, but it could be worse.
-How's that?

127
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:49,293
What's the name of this town?

128
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:51,577
Arnette.

129
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:53,622
Arnette, Texas.

130
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:05,252
Cold got you down?

131
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:08,460
Chills, fever?
Sounds like you need a buddy!

132
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:09,817
Flu Buddy!

133
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:13,499
Fast-acting Flu Buddy,
available at pharmacies everywhere.

134
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,377
Flu Buddy!

135
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:18,933
And now let's get back
to the Lone Star matinee movie.

136
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:27,782
State Patrol, Hap.
Looks like your cousin Joe-Bob.

137
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:32,581
Hey, Joe-Bob.
Want me to fill her up for you?

138
00:14:33,543 --> 00:14:35,977
No, sir, l come by on other business.

139
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:39,614
Was that old geezer here last night
when that guy took out your pumps?

140
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:41,819
Vic? He's here just about every night.

141
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:44,781
-Maybe he ought to hear this, too.
-Hear what?

142
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:48,011
There's strangers
crawling all over Braintree.

143
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:50,139
Supposed to be U.S. Health Service guys...

144
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,182
but they came in a C-5A transport plane,
and they look like regular Army to me.

145
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:56,493
Then there's been
three more big transport planes...

146
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,256
land over Starland in Arkansas since noon.

147
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:01,659
lt was cholera. l knew it was.

148
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:03,900
l don't know nothing about that.

149
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,416
l'll tell you one thing, though.

150
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,619
lf the Feds are thinking about
a quarantine...

151
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:11,616
then you might have a little bit more
to worry about than cholera.

152
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:14,900
l just thought you ought to know
what's stirring in the weeds, Hap.

153
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:17,372
lf any of them other boys
from last night come by...

154
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:21,012
you ought to pass the word along to them.
Just don't mention my name.

155
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:24,778
You ought take care of that, old-timer.
Them summer colds are the worst.

156
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:36,021
What if it ain't a cold?

157
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:39,095
What if l got whatever he had?
That guy last night?

158
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:42,175
lt's probably just the sniffles, that's all.

159
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:51,455
Maybe l ought to close up the station
for the rest of the day.

160
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,420
Call the others
and see how they're feeling.

161
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,300
Might not be a bad idea.

162
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,498
Dang!

163
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:17,138
This is Unit 16 to base.

164
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:20,898
l'm seeing a lot of Army traffic
on State 17...

165
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,099
westbound in the direction of Arnette.

166
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,499
You heard anything about that? Bye.

167
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,302
Please advise if you've been
anywhere near Arnette today. Bye.

168
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:34,492
Negative, base.

169
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,575
l've been over
by the Arkansas state line all day.

170
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,132
Well, that's fine then.

171
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,293
Suggest you let the Army
mind their business...

172
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,613
and you mind yours, Unit 16. Bye.

173
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,776
You don't have to be so grouchy
about it, Cynthia !

174
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:49,374
Unit 16, over and out.

175
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,741
All right, let's move it out.

176
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:15,774
Come on, toss it!

177
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,735
Shoot it!

178
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,421
Hold it right there, now!

179
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:03,341
l can't leave my store.

180
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:05,618
Hey, what right have you got
to push me around?

181
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:12,454
Stuart Richard Redman, sir.

182
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:14,780
He was at the station.

183
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:27,415
Sounds like you're having a busy day.

184
00:18:27,503 --> 00:18:30,700
Dr. Herbert Denninger, Mr. Redman.
Will you come with us?

185
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:35,022
You want to get your hand
off my arm, hoss?

186
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:37,579
He was in direct contact with Campion.

187
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,814
-Put him in the truck. lf he resists....
-l ain't gonna resist.

188
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:44,660
Country don't mean dumb.

189
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,213
l ain't going! l ain't!

190
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:56,774
Get your hands off her!

191
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:01,498
Stay where you are, Mr. Redman.
That's none of your affair.

192
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,657
Stu, what's happening?

193
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:10,138
They want to take us to Vermont!

194
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,098
Mr. Redman, l insist you get into the truck
right now, or....

195
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,139
Or what? You'll shoot me?

196
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,933
That don't scare me much, hoss.

197
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:24,180
lf we got what that guy Campion had,
we're dead already.

198
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,337
Right?

199
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:56,653
Well, our flying time today will be
three hours and forty minutes...

200
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:59,257
and Uncle Sam is buying all the drinks.

201
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:01,499
What the hell's wrong with us?

202
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:03,694
-ls it cholera?
-Absolutely not.

203
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:05,421
You'll be getting all the details....

204
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,572
When?

205
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:08,933
Shortly after you land.

206
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:21,053
l ain't been this scared
since the Mekong Delta in '69.

207
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:26,381
No, that ain't true.
l never been this scared.

208
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:31,415
lt's just the ones that was there
when Campion croaked, ain't it?

209
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:34,495
Us, our families,
the people we been around since.

210
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:36,375
Right now, yeah.

211
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:38,415
What do you mean, right now?

212
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,380
Okay, people, saddle up.

213
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:45,022
Let's go!
You're on Uncle Sam's time now. Move it.

214
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:47,382
Move them out!

215
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,659
Arnette's been cancelled.

216
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:57,059
-Serious?
-What do you think?

217
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:58,542
l don't know.

218
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:02,980
l think we're in big trouble.

219
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:08,338
And now, by request from Bay Ridge...

220
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:11,256
Larry Underwood
and Baby Can You Dig Your Man.

221
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:12,935
Well, baby, can you?

222
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:17,818
Ma !

223
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:35,661
You look beautiful.

224
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:39,294
Aren't you glad to see me?

225
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,341
Should l be, Larry?

226
00:22:42,503 --> 00:22:46,416
Well, l can be happy for the both of us
if l have to be.

227
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:58,613
Come on inside, Larry,
before the neighbors get an eyeful.

228
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:05,056
So you know the record cracked
the top 50?

229
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:09,699
-You heard it, right?
-Of course l have. You sound black.

230
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:13,377
That brown sound sure do get around!

231
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:21,732
Right.

232
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:23,856
So l'm in L.A...

233
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:27,013
and all of a sudden, everyone's my friend.

234
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:29,219
And everyone's got a ''can't miss'' deal.

235
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:31,658
So l had to get out of there
for a little while.

236
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,574
Take a little time off.

237
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:38,495
How's your back, Ma?

238
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:41,178
Pains me some, but l got my pills.

239
00:23:44,863 --> 00:23:47,457
What kind of trouble are you in, Larry?

240
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:57,377
Maybe l overspent my advance a little.

241
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:01,493
l didn't know the record company
was gonna be so cheap.

242
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:04,655
lt's no big deal...

243
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:09,652
except l borrowed a little money.

244
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:12,621
And not from any bank,
or you wouldn't be here, right?

245
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:22,937
Are the leg-breakers any different
on the West Coast than they are here?

246
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:26,652
Do they give you a Perrier and Valium
before they start hurting you?

247
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:28,301
You're just like your father.

248
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,738
-l'm not just like Pop!
-You sound pissed off.

249
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:33,383
-l am pissed off, Ma !
-Good.

250
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:38,941
lt's good to know that there's still
a real person in there someplace.

251
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:45,695
How deep a hole are you in? And don't lie.

252
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:48,101
l've seen your car.

253
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:50,696
About $40,000.

254
00:24:51,943 --> 00:24:53,217
Jesus wept.

255
00:25:02,783 --> 00:25:06,492
But the record's number 21 this week, Ma,
with a bullet.

256
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:11,181
The album hasn't hit the Hot 100 yet,
but it will.

257
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:13,015
$40,000 is nothing.

258
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:15,142
Nothing.

259
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:18,091
l'm not gonna let them make me
a one-hit wonder, either.

260
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,142
Your son's here to stick around.
l'm going to be famous, Ma.

261
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:25,256
Even better, l'm going to be rich.

262
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:35,012
The bed's still in your old room.

263
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,652
l'll make it up,
but then l have to go to work.

264
00:25:37,743 --> 00:25:40,701
-l'm gonna be late as it is.
-All right. Thanks.

265
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,142
Thanks, Ma.

266
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:54,495
Welcome home, Larry.

267
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:41,058
This is interesting. Now watch this.

268
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:08,015
lt's so damn quick.

269
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:13,179
The only two left from the gas station
are Bruett and Redman, correct?

270
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:15,857
Yes. Bruett's critical and sinking fast...

271
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:18,821
which leaves only Redman,
who's not even sick.

272
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:24,371
Now how in God's name is that possible?

273
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:27,580
l don't know, but we're going to find out.

274
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,776
We have to find out. And soon.

275
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:32,501
We will.

276
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:01,418
ln other news...

277
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:04,381
U.S. Government health officials
claim there's nothing strange...

278
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:07,500
in their decision to quarantine
a small east Texas town...

279
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,097
where a new strain
of what's believed to be swine flu...

280
00:28:10,183 --> 00:28:12,413
has got half the population in bed...

281
00:28:12,503 --> 00:28:15,813
and the other half down with the sniffles.
At the Vermont Center....

282
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,336
Hello, Mr. Goldsmith!

283
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:19,653
-Hello, Harold!
-ls Fran around?

284
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:25,418
She's in the kitchen, l think.

285
00:28:32,423 --> 00:28:34,220
-Hi, Fran.
-Hi, Harold.

286
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:37,895
-Thanks, Daddy.
-Don't mention it, sweetheart.

287
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:42,412
-l brought you something.
-You did?

288
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:46,136
ls that you?

289
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:50,021
Of course, Everleafis just
a small literary magazine.

290
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,334
Small but prestigious.
And they only pay in contributors' copies.

291
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:55,983
Look, Daddy, we know a published writer.

292
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:58,174
How about that!

293
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:04,493
My poem is called ''The Crushed Rose.''
l marked it for you.

294
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:09,781
l actually sent in three,
but, of course, their space is very limited.

295
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,893
Harold, l'm going to read this
just as soon as l get a chance. Thanks.

296
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:16,292
ln the meantime, congratulations.

297
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:18,857
Thank you.

298
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,901
l had another reason for stopping by,
as well.

299
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:28,373
l was wondering
if you would care to accompany me...

300
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:30,818
to the Redwood Cinema this Friday
in Boothbay.

301
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,575
They're having a Bergman festival.

302
00:29:32,663 --> 00:29:36,292
l've always found Cries and Whispers
to be especially moving.

303
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:40,735
You see, Amy and l already decided to go
to an R.E.M. concert in Portland.

304
00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:43,452
Sorry.

305
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,813
Well, maybe some other time.

306
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:53,893
l'm sure you'll find somebody to go with.

307
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:56,451
You know, maybe somebody
even your own age.

308
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,739
l mean.... l didn't mean that.

309
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:03,539
Hey, no, don't worry about it.
lt's okay. l understand, really.

310
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:05,495
-l hope you enjoy the poem...
-l will--

311
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:06,902
...and the rest of the magazine.

312
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:09,497
Why don't you stay
and have some iced tea or something?

313
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,336
No, thanks. l'm actually in sort of a hurry.

314
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:24,103
l really handled that great, didn't l?

315
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:28,977
Considering that Harold Lauder's had
a crush on you since he was 9 years old...

316
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:31,054
yeah, l think you did okay.

317
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:33,702
Let me see that.

318
00:30:37,743 --> 00:30:42,259
''l have stridden the fuming way
Of sun-hammered tracks

319
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:44,811
''And savage hobo jungles''

320
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:46,575
Stop!

321
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:53,571
Frannie?

322
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:56,498
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

323
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:59,971
l'm the object
of a young poet's unrequited love.

324
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:01,655
What else could a girl want?

325
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:05,934
You and Jess haven't had a fight?

326
00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:08,618
l haven't seen much of him this summer.

327
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:14,299
Actually, Jess and l have decided
to spend some time apart.

328
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,256
lt's like that, is it?

329
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:22,061
Yeah, just like that.

330
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:26,535
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

331
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:35,334
-What about you? How are you doing?
-l'm fine.

332
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:41,095
l woke up this morning
missing your mother, so l came out here.

333
00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:44,576
After seven years...

334
00:31:45,263 --> 00:31:48,141
there's a lot of places in the house
where she ain't...

335
00:31:48,223 --> 00:31:50,134
but this ain't one of them.

336
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:55,501
Sometimes when l'm out here
yanking weeds, l can almost see her.

337
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,262
l love you, Daddy.

338
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:01,622
l love you, too.

339
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:06,659
Although l've resigned myself
to losing you to Harold Lauder someday.

340
00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:07,778
No!

341
00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:14,211
You okay?

342
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:34,498
And how are you today, Mr. Redman?

343
00:32:35,943 --> 00:32:37,934
We're just going to do a few routine tests.

344
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,333
-lf l could have your arm....
-No, l won't be doing any more tests.

345
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:43,379
lt's just your blood pressure.
Doctor's orders.

346
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:47,012
No, l want to talk to a doctor.
l want to talk to a doctor in person.

347
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:49,492
l'm sure that you'll be talking to a doctor
very soon.

348
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,938
Yeah, l'm sure l will, too. No more tests!

349
00:32:52,463 --> 00:32:53,896
-l'm sick of it!
-Mr. Redman, if--

350
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,862
l think you'd better get in there, don't you?

351
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:35,415
Say, if it isn't the man with
the little clipboard and the armed escort.

352
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:41,621
No, we don't shake hands here.
Just a precaution.

353
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:43,851
A precaution.

354
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:48,251
Patty Greer says you've given her
quite a bit of trouble.

355
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:50,618
-She's quite upset.
-That makes two of us.

356
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:54,735
Being hijacked by some government
sons of bitches in space suits...

357
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:56,654
does that to me every time.

358
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,052
lf you don't want to see me
rip a hole in that...

359
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:02,579
before you can get out of here,
you better give me a little information.

360
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:06,417
-You tell me why l'm not sick.
-Mr. Redman, l hardly think....

361
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,892
-Talk to me, damn it!
-l'm sorry, but you....

362
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:14,093
Mr. Redman, be reasonable.

363
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:16,658
Just get out of here, you little weasel.

364
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:20,892
You send me someone
who'll give me some answers.

365
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:23,577
l don't think
you quite appreciate your position.

366
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:25,381
You're wrong about that.

367
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:27,532
l do.

368
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:29,777
Go on. Get out.

369
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:05,578
Here he comes.

370
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:09,254
-We won't really hurt him, will we, Ray?
-Quiet down.

371
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:12,378
Get him !

372
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:15,853
What the hell are you waiting for?

373
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:21,252
Next time l yell, friend,
you're gonna pay attention.

374
00:35:21,343 --> 00:35:22,662
l guarantee it.

375
00:35:23,263 --> 00:35:24,901
Hold him ! Hold the sucker!

376
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:35,373
Hold him. l'm gonna mess him up.

377
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:41,141
How come he don't say nothing?

378
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:44,659
By the time l finish with him,
he'll be singing...

379
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,222
The Battle Hymn of the Republic.

380
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:49,534
Sucker almost ruined my favorite shirt.
l'm gonna mess him up.

381
00:35:50,303 --> 00:35:52,897
-Stop it, Ray! You're killing him !
-Ray, car!

382
00:35:54,423 --> 00:35:57,221
-No!
-Heads up, sucker!

383
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:00,582
l can hear!

384
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:03,576
l can talk!

385
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:22,731
l can hear.

386
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:25,452
l can talk.

387
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:30,332
l know, Nick. Praise God.

388
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:33,934
How did you know my name?

389
00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:36,373
Come to me in a dream, l reckon.

390
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:38,536
ls this a dream?

391
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:42,612
Mayhap it is, and mayhap it ain't.

392
00:37:46,503 --> 00:37:48,141
Who are you, ma'am?

393
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:51,698
Abagail Freemantle.

394
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:55,773
But folks around these parts
just call me Mother Abagail.

395
00:37:57,703 --> 00:38:02,174
l'm 106 years old
and l still make my own bread.

396
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:07,416
l been living right here
in Hemingford Home, Nebraska, all my life.

397
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:11,534
You come see me, Nick.

398
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:14,543
You and all your friends.

399
00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:17,094
You got to hurry, though.

400
00:38:22,943 --> 00:38:24,740
There's a storm coming.

401
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:28,022
His storm.

402
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:11,259
Some people have even taken
to wearing protection on the streets.

403
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:14,255
-Why are you wearing this mask, sir?
-l don't know. Just feel safer.

404
00:39:14,423 --> 00:39:15,492
Okay. Thank you.

405
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:18,222
The folks at the
Atlanta Disease Control Center told me...

406
00:39:18,303 --> 00:39:21,500
that these masks wouldn't stop
'"a flu germ with a hangover. '"

407
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,097
-Gin.
-So l guess we can thank our lucky stars...

408
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,743
that this outbreak of superflu
is just another urban....

409
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,053
l don't know about all those people
down in Texas...

410
00:39:29,143 --> 00:39:32,772
but you sure sound
like you got a dose of the flu, Johnny.

411
00:39:33,063 --> 00:39:35,623
-You better let me take a listen.
-Forget that.

412
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:37,736
Come on.

413
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:41,060
You know how hot it makes me
when you take your shirt off.

414
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:56,014
When l was a boy, we caught ourselves
a mountain lion back up in the hills.

415
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,703
We shot it and dragged it back to town.

416
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,858
What was left of that critter
when we got home...

417
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:04,298
was the sorriest-looking sight
l've ever seen.

418
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:06,975
You're the second sorriest, boy.

419
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:12,739
l'm gonna get somebody to take
his shirt off before l go home tonight.

420
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:17,213
lt's okay, son. l'm a doctor.

421
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:22,780
l'm also the guy
who damn near ran you over.

422
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,419
You got a name, babalugah?

423
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:33,776
What the hell?

424
00:40:40,543 --> 00:40:42,693
lt means that he's deaf and dumb.

425
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:46,777
That hurt?

426
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:50,612
lf you're deaf and dumb...

427
00:40:50,703 --> 00:40:54,537
how the hell am l gonna to find out
what happened to you tonight?

428
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:16,979
Can you read lips, babalugah?

429
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:20,374
Thank God for small favors.

430
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:22,262
Tell me this...

431
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:26,336
would you know the three boys
that jobbed you if you seen them again?

432
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:29,218
What?

433
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:34,333
One of them had a ring like that?

434
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:36,372
Man!

435
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:39,023
That's a fraternity ring, my silent friend.

436
00:41:39,103 --> 00:41:42,300
And the only two people around here
who have them...

437
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:46,092
are our esteemed sheriff and Ray Booth,
our town bad boy.

438
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:50,261
The Sheriff here married Ray's baby sister.

439
00:41:51,623 --> 00:41:53,614
Janey's gonna just love this.

440
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:00,142
Welcome to Shoyo, Mr. Andros.

441
00:42:00,423 --> 00:42:03,574
lt's a veritable hotbed
of Southern hospitality.

442
00:42:03,663 --> 00:42:05,096
Get away from me.

443
00:42:20,823 --> 00:42:23,257
l don't know how many different ways
l can say this.

444
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:26,813
This so-called superflu does not exist.

445
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,302
Then what is it?
Why is everybody talking about it?

446
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,419
l don't know
why everybody's talking about it...

447
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:34,936
or where the rumors are coming from.

448
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:37,253
lt must be a figment
of the press's imagination.

449
00:42:37,343 --> 00:42:39,254
l don't know why l'm here
answering questions.

450
00:42:39,343 --> 00:42:42,699
l don't have the answers
because there's no such thing....

451
00:42:44,823 --> 00:42:47,496
Good afternoon, Mr. Redman.
My name is Deitz.

452
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:50,213
l'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

453
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:56,932
Meet Geraldo.

454
00:42:58,063 --> 00:42:59,018
Geraldo?

455
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,056
Now, the virus
your fellow townspeople contracted...

456
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:07,341
passes easily from human to guinea pig
and vice versa, presumably.

457
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:12,418
But Geraldo has been breathing your air
via convector for the last three days...

458
00:43:13,463 --> 00:43:17,581
and Geraldo is fine and frisky, as you see.

459
00:43:19,503 --> 00:43:22,381
l'd call that rather comforting,
wouldn't you?

460
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:27,135
-l see you're not taking any chances.
-That's not in my contract.

461
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:28,982
However, it does appear...

462
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:32,373
that there's absolutely nothing
wrong with you, Mr. Redman...

463
00:43:32,503 --> 00:43:34,573
or may l call you Stu?

464
00:43:35,703 --> 00:43:37,534
Just don't call me Geraldo.

465
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,897
l like that.

466
00:43:41,303 --> 00:43:42,975
Now look here, Stu...

467
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:47,775
let's try to get through this as painlessly
as possible, what do you say?

468
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:53,181
Okay, here's number one:

469
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:58,615
The testing schedule we began
earlier this week is going to resume...

470
00:43:58,863 --> 00:44:02,094
with your cooperation or without it.

471
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:06,258
We got a hell of a mess on our hands here,
thanks to that imbecile Campion.

472
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:09,062
So l don't want you to get the idea
you're a volunteer.

473
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:10,815
You've been drafted.

474
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:19,335
-What about the folks l came in with?
-From Arnette?

475
00:44:19,943 --> 00:44:22,377
All dead. Which is why we can't afford to--

476
00:44:23,863 --> 00:44:27,139
What did you do? What did you people do?

477
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:29,373
Stu, please.

478
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,419
No! Stand clear!

479
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,779
All right, now you listen up...

480
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:59,260
l'm not responsible for you being here...

481
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,302
or for the dead people in your hometown.

482
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:06,621
Neither is Denninger, or the nurses
who come in to take your blood pressure.

483
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:10,742
-Then who is?
-No one. Everyone. God.

484
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:12,418
Who knows.

485
00:45:12,503 --> 00:45:16,337
All you have to do is resign yourself
to a few more pokes and pricks.

486
00:45:18,703 --> 00:45:20,022
What if l....

487
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:26,663
-Evacuate!
-Deitz, calm down.

488
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:31,697
l was just faking.

489
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:36,412
Why?

490
00:45:37,783 --> 00:45:40,138
Why would you do a thing like that?

491
00:45:41,383 --> 00:45:45,422
You talk about this thing in here
like you were outside of it.

492
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:49,973
l just wanted you to get a little taste
of what it's like on the inside.

493
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:51,655
How do you like it?

494
00:45:53,863 --> 00:45:56,980
You stupid son of a bitch.

495
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:02,334
Get the hell out of here.

496
00:46:07,023 --> 00:46:09,139
Don't forget your damn guinea pig.

497
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,692
Reports of the supposedly lethal
flu epidemic continue to spread.

498
00:46:37,783 --> 00:46:40,013
Many downtown shopping areas
in southern Florida...

499
00:46:40,103 --> 00:46:41,536
are virtually empty this morning...

500
00:46:41,623 --> 00:46:44,137
and the flu rumor
actually seems to be gaining credence...

501
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,420
despite statements from health officials
in Atlanta and Vermont.

502
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:51,655
ln Vermont, Dr. Herbert Denninger said,
'"Let me put it in five simple words.

503
00:46:52,023 --> 00:46:54,298
'"Captain Trips does not exist. '"

504
00:46:54,703 --> 00:46:56,978
How's the sexiest bartender in L.A.?

505
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:57,863
Larry? ls that you?

506
00:46:57,863 --> 00:46:58,136
Larry? ls that you?

507
00:46:58,223 --> 00:46:58,463
Yeah, Arlene, listen.

508
00:46:58,463 --> 00:46:59,063
Yeah, Arlene, listen.

509
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:00,291
Yeah, Arlene, listen.

510
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:02,613
You better get this first.
Wayne Stukey called.

511
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:05,263
He said your album's going up
nine spots this week...

512
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:08,938
your single's third on the Billboards
and you're number one on VH1 .

513
00:47:09,383 --> 00:47:11,772
Sounds to me
like you might just be king of the world.

514
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:13,899
What's it sound like to you?

515
00:47:13,983 --> 00:47:15,211
Victory!

516
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:18,695
Arlene, l love you!

517
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,656
Don't l wish.

518
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:22,342
Listen, l'm gonna try and get...

519
00:47:22,743 --> 00:47:24,096
the afternoon flight back.

520
00:47:24,183 --> 00:47:28,096
So you put on your sexiest number.
l'm gonna take you out to dinner.

521
00:47:28,663 --> 00:47:32,019
Then l'll take you out dancing,
then maybe l'll just take you.

522
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:36,015
You might want to consider delaying
your trip back a few days.

523
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,138
Why? What's the problem?

524
00:47:37,223 --> 00:47:38,178
Things are weird.

525
00:47:38,463 --> 00:47:41,182
People are really scared about this
Captain Trips thing.

526
00:47:41,263 --> 00:47:43,538
Yeah, radio here says it's just bull.

527
00:47:43,623 --> 00:47:46,660
The radio here says the hospitals
are filling up with sick people...

528
00:47:46,743 --> 00:47:48,017
and some of them are dying.

529
00:47:48,103 --> 00:47:49,741
What, people are dying of the flu?

530
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:51,222
There's a lot of soldiers around.

531
00:47:51,543 --> 00:47:54,137
Suddenly L.A. is a really creepy place
to be, Larry.

532
00:47:55,183 --> 00:47:57,777
Maybe l'll stick around New York
a couple of days then.

533
00:47:57,863 --> 00:48:00,218
Just don't forget
what you promised when you get back.

534
00:48:00,423 --> 00:48:03,733
Dinner, dancing,
and all the paparazzi l can smile at.

535
00:48:03,823 --> 00:48:05,381
Yeah, you got it.

536
00:48:06,023 --> 00:48:07,695
-Bye.
-Bye.

537
00:48:15,703 --> 00:48:20,458
-Sorry. l'm sorry, man.
-The Rat Man forgive you this time.

538
00:48:31,343 --> 00:48:35,052
Bring out your dead!

539
00:48:42,863 --> 00:48:44,694
He's coming for you, Larry!

540
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:47,535
The man with no face.

541
00:48:49,983 --> 00:48:51,575
Bring out your dead!

542
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,776
Turn that up.

543
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:18,017
Give me that.

544
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:19,782
lt's a dead soldier.

545
00:49:21,303 --> 00:49:22,782
Dead company.

546
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:28,777
-All-star bowling.
-Come on, Poke!

547
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:31,860
-You know what time it is?
-What time is it?

548
00:49:31,943 --> 00:49:33,934
-Time to make a cash withdrawal!
-l heard that.

549
00:49:34,023 --> 00:49:36,901
And if anybody,
l mean anybody, says anything...

550
00:49:36,983 --> 00:49:38,655
or does anything to stop us....

551
00:49:39,783 --> 00:49:42,934
-We're gonna Pokerize them.
-That's right. Damn straight.

552
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:59,418
-lf we're gonna do this, do it fast.
-l know what you mean, jellybean.

553
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:05,532
All right!

554
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,220
Hold still and won't nobody get hurt.

555
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:12,101
That's all, folks!

556
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:13,332
Look out, Poke!

557
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:25,094
You see it, Lloyd?
That old bugger tried to shoot me!

558
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,377
Hold it!

559
00:50:42,863 --> 00:50:43,818
Hands up!

560
00:50:43,903 --> 00:50:46,497
Deputy Sheriff Owen Kinsolving, officers.
Coming out.

561
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:52,418
Who's he? What's he doing there?

562
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,653
You got this coming out the door.

563
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,335
That's enough! That's enough, Owen!

564
00:51:02,423 --> 00:51:03,697
Bull crap!

565
00:51:05,823 --> 00:51:07,097
Pop Jones...

566
00:51:07,823 --> 00:51:10,212
Betty Diamond, both dead.

567
00:51:11,663 --> 00:51:13,619
lt ain't never gonna be enough.

568
00:51:32,783 --> 00:51:35,536
We have a rather large problem
in Wyoming, sir.

569
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:37,818
What large problem is that, Len?

570
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:42,302
A news team got out of Pine Bluff with
some potentially damaging videotape, sir.

571
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:44,739
Flu victims? Body dumps?

572
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:48,900
A little of both. And our ops, l'm told.

573
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:51,178
-We can't have that.
-No, sir, l know.

574
00:51:51,263 --> 00:51:54,221
Showing footage like that
would not be in the national interest.

575
00:51:54,623 --> 00:51:56,261
Absolutely not, sir.

576
00:51:56,983 --> 00:52:00,658
Do we know where these newspeople,
these rabble-rousers are now?

577
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:03,901
Yes, sir, we do.

578
00:52:04,263 --> 00:52:07,460
Get that videotape, Len.
Any means necessary.

579
00:52:08,383 --> 00:52:09,736
Make it a priority.

580
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:11,731
Yes, sir.

581
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:16,262
Any means necessary.

582
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:37,218
-Everybody out of the van!
-Mike, you getting all this?

583
00:52:37,343 --> 00:52:41,097
-l don't like the way this looks. Be careful.
-Come on! Out right now! Let's go!

584
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:44,301
You'll have to surrender the camera
that gentleman's holding...

585
00:52:44,383 --> 00:52:46,021
and any tape you may have already shot.

586
00:52:46,103 --> 00:52:47,456
Can you tell us why, Major?

587
00:52:47,823 --> 00:52:50,212
You don't seem to understand
the situation here.

588
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,861
Martial law has been declared.

589
00:52:51,943 --> 00:52:54,980
We don't have to put up
with you and your pinko friends anymore!

590
00:52:55,063 --> 00:52:56,291
Are you getting all this?

591
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:59,057
-Can we have a comment--
-Get him !

592
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,735
-Get the driver!
-Stop!

593
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:04,496
-ln the car!
-No!

594
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:06,818
Cut the power!

595
00:53:15,783 --> 00:53:16,738
Come.

596
00:53:21,183 --> 00:53:22,252
Thank you.

597
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:30,340
lt looks like our problem in Wyoming
has been solved.

598
00:53:31,903 --> 00:53:35,976
lt doesn't change the basic fact
that our goose is pretty well cooked.

599
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:41,376
''Things fall apart
The center does not hold''

600
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,653
A man named Yeats said that.

601
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:51,702
l didn't understand that poem
in college, Len.

602
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,819
But l must be getting smarter
in my old age...

603
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:58,894
because l understand it now.

604
00:54:00,223 --> 00:54:02,612
And one other line from that poem:

605
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:06,261
''What rough beast

606
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:09,813
''lts hour come round at last

607
00:54:11,463 --> 00:54:14,978
''Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?''

608
00:54:17,983 --> 00:54:20,099
l think that beast
might be on its way, Len.

609
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:24,582
What do you think?

610
00:54:28,503 --> 00:54:30,698
ls that Hungarian goulash?

611
00:54:33,343 --> 00:54:34,981
l don't know. lt might be, sir.

612
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:39,899
Yeats was right. Things fall apart.

613
00:54:58,743 --> 00:55:00,415
Who died and made you God?

614
00:55:01,943 --> 00:55:04,218
You don't think we're gonna eat that,
do you, dummy?

615
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:07,261
You could have poisoned it,
you blue-eyed pretty boy.

616
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:11,416
l'm gonna mess up your hair, pretty boy!
l'm gonna ride you like a lame bronc.

617
00:55:11,503 --> 00:55:13,255
You're mine, sucker!

618
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:18,019
Sorry, guy. l can't. Sick.

619
00:55:20,623 --> 00:55:25,060
We're not gonna eat it, dummy.
None of us! We're on a hunger strike.

620
00:55:26,983 --> 00:55:28,701
l'm awful hungry, Ray.

621
00:55:29,783 --> 00:55:31,011
You son of a....

622
00:56:10,263 --> 00:56:12,333
Hey, dummy, you want a drink?

623
00:56:12,863 --> 00:56:14,535
l'm on a hunger strike.

624
00:56:14,623 --> 00:56:17,456
l'm on a hunger strike
until you let me out of here!

625
00:56:18,183 --> 00:56:21,698
Now you come on over here
'cause l'm not done with you yet.

626
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:30,857
Has there been much of that foolishness?

627
00:56:51,023 --> 00:56:52,058
Sorry.

628
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:56,341
John and his wife are dead.
A lot of people in Shoyo are dead...

629
00:56:57,023 --> 00:56:59,093
and a lot more are going to die.

630
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:03,938
ln fact, you and l may be the last two
healthy people in western Arkansas.

631
00:57:04,063 --> 00:57:05,576
-What's he talking about?
-Shut up!

632
00:57:05,663 --> 00:57:08,223
Our government
is still denying everything...

633
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,778
but the radio says
the hospitals are filling up...

634
00:57:10,863 --> 00:57:15,414
and the Army's burning bodies
in waste treatment facilities.

635
00:57:18,343 --> 00:57:21,016
The ultimate recycling program.

636
00:57:31,623 --> 00:57:35,377
Doc, you gotta let me out of here.
They're both sick.

637
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,418
Keeping me in here with them
is cruel and unusual punishment.

638
00:57:40,143 --> 00:57:43,977
l've got a little cabin up in the hills.
l'm gonna try to wait this out.

639
00:57:44,063 --> 00:57:45,257
And so l was thinking....

640
00:57:49,223 --> 00:57:52,533
My responsibility as a doctor?
Don't make me laugh.

641
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:56,492
l took an oath to treat my patients,
not die with them.

642
00:58:00,983 --> 00:58:03,417
You could come with me if you want.

643
00:58:10,783 --> 00:58:14,412
John got sick
and made you responsible for them?

644
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:15,698
Yeah.

645
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:18,775
But that doesn't mean you can't
let them out now that he's gone.

646
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:22,822
Ray, if he lets you out,
are you gonna mess with him?

647
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:25,219
No, l swear.

648
00:58:26,223 --> 00:58:27,542
Me neither.

649
00:58:29,623 --> 00:58:31,500
They'll leave you alone.

650
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:38,742
l got something for you, mutie.
Been saving it up, you might say.

651
00:59:53,263 --> 00:59:56,892
Things have changed, Ray.
You might do well to remember that.

652
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:08,053
You might see me again, mutie.

653
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:27,092
So, what do you say?
Wanna come upcountry with me?

654
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:35,140
God, you're nuts. He's as good as dead.

655
01:00:57,703 --> 01:01:00,422
Water, please. Thirsty....

656
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:41,816
Although city and government
spokespersons vehemently deny it...

657
01:01:41,903 --> 01:01:44,098
reliable sources report to News Radio...

658
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:45,980
that troops opened fire earlier today...

659
01:01:46,063 --> 01:01:48,372
on unarmed pedestrians
attempting to flee New York...

660
01:01:48,463 --> 01:01:49,578
by way of the Lincoln Tunnel.

661
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:52,621
As many as 60 persons may have been
killed, with hundreds wounded.

662
01:01:52,703 --> 01:01:55,661
Although travel to some
of the outer boroughs is still possible...

663
01:01:55,743 --> 01:01:58,621
News Radio advises you
to stay off the streets.

664
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:16,938
Mom?

665
01:02:17,303 --> 01:02:18,702
l'm so hot.

666
01:02:19,343 --> 01:02:21,732
You're gonna be fine.
Let's just put you to bed.

667
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:24,860
Larry, go find your father. He's in the bar.

668
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:28,893
-He's in the bar with that photographer.
-Okay, Ma.

669
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,975
Take a little sip of this. Okay, Mom.

670
01:03:05,383 --> 01:03:07,658
Just take a little baby swallow.

671
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:10,496
Okay, there you go.

672
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,177
Larry, watch out for him.

673
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:36,695
The dark man.

674
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:38,935
Coming for you.

675
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:42,941
What did you say, Ma?

676
01:04:20,663 --> 01:04:23,097
How can a hospital phone be busy?

677
01:04:28,383 --> 01:04:31,773
Get back, sit back. Okay.

678
01:04:35,983 --> 01:04:39,692
You're gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

679
01:04:40,383 --> 01:04:42,135
You're gonna be okay.

680
01:05:05,663 --> 01:05:09,019
Bring out your dead!

681
01:05:09,463 --> 01:05:10,657
He's coming!

682
01:06:11,543 --> 01:06:13,977
Oh, God. No!

683
01:06:21,423 --> 01:06:23,220
You were right, Billy.

684
01:06:26,103 --> 01:06:28,014
The center doesn't hold.

685
01:06:30,463 --> 01:06:31,976
lt sure doesn't.

686
01:07:19,343 --> 01:07:22,653
How's it going, mutie? What's shaking?

687
01:07:30,063 --> 01:07:34,215
You're gonna be in hell for 30 seconds
before you even know you're dead.

688
01:07:40,943 --> 01:07:45,061
None of this happened till you came along.
l'm gonna kill you, mutie!

689
01:08:05,023 --> 01:08:08,777
Bring out your dead!
The monster's coming.

690
01:08:08,863 --> 01:08:12,253
He's coming. Bring out your dead!

691
01:08:32,663 --> 01:08:34,301
Here you go, Dad.

692
01:08:34,863 --> 01:08:38,378
Here's some toast
and some Jewish penicillin for you.

693
01:08:38,463 --> 01:08:42,217
-Chicken soup to the great unwashed.
-That looks good, darling.

694
01:08:42,783 --> 01:08:46,776
-How are you feeling?
-Better, quite a bit.

695
01:08:47,383 --> 01:08:49,533
l think l might be beating it.

696
01:08:49,623 --> 01:08:52,183
That's good, because l still can't reach
Dr. Albertson...

697
01:08:52,263 --> 01:08:54,777
and the Rent-a-Doc in Wells
is not picking up the phone.

698
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:56,501
l just keep getting a recording.

699
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:59,461
You know, this flu is everywhere.
lt's really scary.

700
01:08:59,543 --> 01:09:03,741
-You look okay.
-l feel okay. Great, in fact.

701
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:10,493
Turn on the radio, will you?
lt's time for Rae Flowers.

702
01:09:10,983 --> 01:09:14,055
-Not that sarcastic little woman.
-l like her.

703
01:09:21,143 --> 01:09:24,101
Hello there. This is Rae Flowers
on Speak Your Piece.

704
01:09:24,183 --> 01:09:27,175
l guess this morning
there's only one topic of conversation.

705
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:31,211
You can call it the superflu
or by its West Coast name, Captain Trips...

706
01:09:31,303 --> 01:09:33,339
but it means the same thing either way.

707
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:37,018
There have been horror stories about
the Army clamping down on everything....

708
01:09:37,103 --> 01:09:38,252
The Army?

709
01:09:38,343 --> 01:09:41,653
Just be patient with me, and remember
l'm running the show all by myself.

710
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:43,620
Everyone else called in sick.

711
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:47,616
The numbers are the same as always,
though: 555-TALK and 555-CHAT.

712
01:09:47,703 --> 01:09:48,931
So let's go.

713
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:52,174
Hello there, this is Rae Flowers
and it's time to speak your piece.

714
01:09:52,263 --> 01:09:54,493
l'm calling from Portsmouth, Rae.

715
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:58,053
-What's your name, Portsmouth?
-Leonora. Listen, Rae...

716
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:01,055
l want everyone to know
that there are soldiers burning bodies...

717
01:10:01,143 --> 01:10:05,694
across the state line in Kittery.
Also, my little girl died this morning.

718
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:08,773
l guess she's with Jesus now.

719
01:10:10,263 --> 01:10:14,017
-l'm sorry as hell, Leonora.
-l think the soldiers did it.

720
01:10:14,103 --> 01:10:17,015
l think they made a bug
that's killing people.

721
01:10:17,103 --> 01:10:19,537
That wouldn't be very American, would it?

722
01:10:19,623 --> 01:10:20,612
No, l guess not.

723
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:23,695
Of course, that's never stopped
the real patriots among us, has it?

724
01:10:23,783 --> 01:10:26,422
-You try to hang in there.
-l'm trying, Rae...

725
01:10:26,503 --> 01:10:29,176
but have you ever smelled bodies on fire?

726
01:10:30,903 --> 01:10:34,293
-l can't say that l have.
-lt's awful, Rae. lt's just....

727
01:10:35,223 --> 01:10:37,100
You just try to hang in there, hon.

728
01:10:37,183 --> 01:10:40,493
This is Rae Flowers. You're on the air
and it's time to speak your piece.

729
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,973
First of all, l just want to tell you
that l love your show.

730
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:55,819
You say you saw these Gls
gunning down unarmed civilians?

731
01:10:59,663 --> 01:11:02,302
Open in the name
of the United States government.

732
01:11:02,823 --> 01:11:04,939
Portland, it looks like
the Marines have landed...

733
01:11:05,023 --> 01:11:07,776
-and they don't look too happy.
-This is a joke, right?

734
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:11,412
-This has got to be a joke.
-l really don't think so, Frannie.

735
01:11:11,823 --> 01:11:14,178
-Hi there, you're on the air.
-Rae, you all right?

736
01:11:14,263 --> 01:11:16,902
To tell you the truth,
it doesn't look good right now.

737
01:11:17,223 --> 01:11:20,659
Several soldiers have just broken in
to the studio. They're fully armed...

738
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:23,303
and they're dressed
in some kind of protective clothing.

739
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:25,578
They're wearing respirators
on their faces....

740
01:11:27,143 --> 01:11:28,292
Shut it down!

741
01:11:28,383 --> 01:11:31,420
Bluto, you ever heard of a little number
called freedom of speech?

742
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:34,142
Bill of Rights? Any of that ring a bell?

743
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:38,102
Folks, l've been ordered by my uninvited
fascist guests to shut down...

744
01:11:38,183 --> 01:11:40,617
-and l've refused.
-All right, that's enough!

745
01:11:43,183 --> 01:11:47,142
Oh, my God! Daddy, what's happening?

746
01:11:48,823 --> 01:11:50,495
l don't know, honey.

747
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:59,413
He's closer now! The hard case!

748
01:12:00,623 --> 01:12:03,137
The dark man! He's coming!

749
01:12:37,503 --> 01:12:39,221
Rub-a-dub-dub.

750
01:12:45,543 --> 01:12:47,295
Thanks for the grub.

751
01:12:59,063 --> 01:13:00,382
He's here!

752
01:13:02,343 --> 01:13:05,141
The monster's here! The dark man's here!

753
01:13:54,423 --> 01:13:58,575
Hello there, East Texas. What kept you?

754
01:13:58,823 --> 01:14:00,779
l was lost in the corn.

755
01:14:02,903 --> 01:14:04,780
Then l heard the guitar.

756
01:14:06,063 --> 01:14:07,860
lt sounds so sweet.

757
01:14:09,303 --> 01:14:13,455
l ain't been able to make
a decent F-chord in 20 years...

758
01:14:13,543 --> 01:14:15,261
but thank you kindly.

759
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:22,057
Who are you? Where is this?

760
01:14:22,743 --> 01:14:27,214
l'm Abagail Freemantle,
and this is Hemingford Home.

761
01:14:30,063 --> 01:14:33,897
Those folks who've got you
won't leave you to live much longer.

762
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:36,254
You know that, don't you?

763
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:38,215
l reckon maybe l do.

764
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:43,021
The beast is loose
in the streets of Bethlehem.

765
01:14:43,823 --> 01:14:47,418
-The rats are in the corn.
-l don't follow you, ma'am.

766
01:14:53,343 --> 01:14:54,617
Ma'am?

767
01:14:58,863 --> 01:15:00,421
Where are you?

768
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:05,853
Folks round these parts just call me
Mother Abagail, East Texas.

769
01:16:12,783 --> 01:16:15,616
Well, how are we feeling?

770
01:16:17,783 --> 01:16:18,852
Fine.

771
01:16:21,903 --> 01:16:23,336
Always fine.

772
01:16:25,743 --> 01:16:29,258
Just think, all the tests we ran on you...

773
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:33,293
and we never found
a single immunity vector. Not one.

774
01:16:36,183 --> 01:16:39,175
l'm curious. How would you explain it?

775
01:16:40,423 --> 01:16:42,698
Have you been touched by God?

776
01:16:54,303 --> 01:16:56,737
What have you got behind your back?

777
01:17:05,783 --> 01:17:07,694
-l see.
-Do you?

778
01:17:07,783 --> 01:17:10,138
-l think l do, yeah.
-l wonder.

779
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:15,938
Where's your buddy Denninger?

780
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:18,782
He's dead.

781
01:17:20,543 --> 01:17:22,215
They're all dead.

782
01:17:23,943 --> 01:17:27,538
Everyone except for me and thee.

783
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,903
And you're here to take care of me?
ls that it?

784
01:17:30,983 --> 01:17:32,336
Hole in one.

785
01:17:34,943 --> 01:17:35,978
Why?

786
01:17:39,903 --> 01:17:43,293
Because l've decided
a piece of chicken-fried crap like you...

787
01:17:43,383 --> 01:17:47,376
doesn't deserve to live.
Not with so many good men dying.

788
01:17:49,863 --> 01:17:53,060
Those good men caused this mess.

789
01:23:15,463 --> 01:23:19,138
Come down and eat chicken with me,
beautiful. lt's so dark.

790
01:24:01,223 --> 01:24:05,102
You come and see me, Stu.
You and all your friends.

791
01:24:05,183 --> 01:24:08,141
We got to get started. Time's short.

792
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:21,414
Abagail Freemantle.

793
01:24:23,143 --> 01:24:24,895
Hemingford Home.

794
01:24:46,783 --> 01:24:51,334
You come see me.
You and all your friends.

795
01:25:34,143 --> 01:25:35,178
English

796
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:49,941
l love you, Daddy.

797
01:26:53,223 --> 01:26:54,815
Frannie loves you.

798
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:33,652
Fran?

799
01:27:34,103 --> 01:27:36,776
Mr. Goldsmith? Hello?

800
01:27:38,103 --> 01:27:40,776
l'm here, Harold. Come in.

801
01:27:45,743 --> 01:27:47,062
Here.

802
01:27:53,823 --> 01:27:55,302
lt's my father.

803
01:27:56,423 --> 01:27:58,812
l'm going to bury him in his garden.

804
01:27:59,303 --> 01:28:02,375
That's his favorite place.
l think he'll be able to rest there.

805
01:28:02,463 --> 01:28:03,816
l really do.

806
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:07,734
But l'm so hot and tired.
Could you please help me?

807
01:28:09,503 --> 01:28:10,731
Of course.

808
01:28:47,783 --> 01:28:51,014
Here you go.
lt's a little warm, but it's not too bad.

809
01:28:52,423 --> 01:28:54,732
That's okay. l like warm lemonade.

810
01:28:58,303 --> 01:29:00,214
Harold, it's so strange.

811
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:03,176
lt doesn't even seem
like the place l grew up in.

812
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:05,772
lt seems like a different planet.

813
01:29:06,023 --> 01:29:07,854
Yeah, l know what you mean.

814
01:29:09,663 --> 01:29:11,619
l've always hated it here.

815
01:29:11,983 --> 01:29:14,178
All l ever wanted was to escape.

816
01:29:16,223 --> 01:29:19,738
All those guys who used to give me
wedgies in gym class...

817
01:29:19,903 --> 01:29:22,861
all the girls who used to laugh
at the way l walked...

818
01:29:22,943 --> 01:29:24,501
they're all gone.

819
01:29:26,343 --> 01:29:28,095
And l want them back.

820
01:29:30,103 --> 01:29:31,138
Nuts.

821
01:29:38,543 --> 01:29:41,774
For two people from the same town...

822
01:29:42,223 --> 01:29:44,498
two people who know each other...

823
01:29:44,983 --> 01:29:47,656
to both be immune to something this big:

824
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:51,102
lt's like winning the Megabucks lottery.

825
01:29:52,943 --> 01:29:56,572
-lt has to mean something.
-Well, there's gotta be other people.

826
01:29:56,663 --> 01:30:00,133
We just gotta figure out how to find them,
don't you think?

827
01:30:01,823 --> 01:30:04,212
-We have to go to Stovington.
-Where?

828
01:30:05,383 --> 01:30:07,101
Stovington, Vermont.

829
01:30:07,503 --> 01:30:10,017
There's a government
communicable disease center there.

830
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:14,415
lf anyone's still alive and trying to find
a cure for the flu, that's where they'd be.

831
01:30:14,503 --> 01:30:17,540
-lmmune cases as well.
-Harold, you're a genius.

832
01:30:18,703 --> 01:30:20,375
That's a great idea.

833
01:30:21,223 --> 01:30:23,942
Of course,
Stovington might be deserted, too.

834
01:30:26,823 --> 01:30:28,415
Roads are jammed.

835
01:30:29,743 --> 01:30:33,372
-Can you ride a motorcycle?
-Yeah. Jess taught me.

836
01:30:34,903 --> 01:30:36,973
Yeah, that's your boyfriend.

837
01:30:37,583 --> 01:30:39,255
Well, not anymore.

838
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:44,259
Do you think that maybe...

839
01:30:45,423 --> 01:30:49,496
-you know, maybe l could be....
-Harold, we're always gonna be friends.

840
01:30:51,223 --> 01:30:53,259
-Oh, l forgot.
-What?

841
01:30:53,903 --> 01:30:56,133
lt's a surprise. Wait right here.

842
01:30:59,903 --> 01:31:04,579
l found it in the garage
when l was looking for canvas.

843
01:31:06,023 --> 01:31:08,856
lt runs on batteries.
l thought maybe it would cheer me up.

844
01:31:08,943 --> 01:31:10,501
Cheer us both up.

845
01:31:11,183 --> 01:31:13,333
Okay, what do you want to hear?

846
01:33:14,503 --> 01:33:15,731
Hello?

847
01:33:21,823 --> 01:33:23,336
ls anybody here?

848
01:33:44,463 --> 01:33:45,816
Giddyup, boy.

849
01:33:56,663 --> 01:33:57,732
Hello?

850
01:34:01,503 --> 01:34:03,061
ls anybody there?

851
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,895
ls anybody anywhere?

852
01:34:08,063 --> 01:34:09,337
Over here!

853
01:34:10,383 --> 01:34:11,498
Where?

854
01:34:12,903 --> 01:34:14,336
Keep shouting.

855
01:34:14,943 --> 01:34:16,899
l don't believe l need to.

856
01:34:21,623 --> 01:34:25,013
-You're not gonna shoot me, are you?
-Are you dangerous?

857
01:34:25,103 --> 01:34:28,698
l don't know. No, l'm not dangerous.

858
01:34:44,463 --> 01:34:46,374
l can smell your perfume.

859
01:34:51,223 --> 01:34:53,293
l'm glad to see you, too.

860
01:34:54,463 --> 01:34:58,979
Except for the birds, we may be
the only living creatures in this entire city.

861
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:01,614
Don't you believe it...

862
01:35:02,823 --> 01:35:06,020
'cause there are a lot
of dangerous people out there.

863
01:35:06,103 --> 01:35:09,095
Some of them
are every bit as healthy as we are.

864
01:35:09,183 --> 01:35:11,743
So my gun might not be such a bad idea?

865
01:35:12,783 --> 01:35:13,772
No.

866
01:35:21,703 --> 01:35:23,375
You know something?

867
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:30,414
l've seen this guy before...

868
01:35:33,143 --> 01:35:36,294
in Times Square,
just before everything went to hell.

869
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:38,934
Screaming about monsters.

870
01:35:40,023 --> 01:35:42,139
Now he said they were coming.

871
01:35:42,983 --> 01:35:44,382
He was right.

872
01:36:07,463 --> 01:36:12,093
-How rare did you want it?
-Just run it through a warm room.

873
01:36:14,583 --> 01:36:17,655
You know, l was hoping you'd say that.

874
01:36:19,303 --> 01:36:21,817
-Ta-da.
-Thank you.

875
01:36:24,623 --> 01:36:25,903
This one's barely breathing.

876
01:36:25,903 --> 01:36:26,380
This one's barely breathing.

877
01:36:29,943 --> 01:36:31,934
l think l lost my appetite.

878
01:36:32,943 --> 01:36:35,821
-We gotta get out of here.
-l beg your pardon?

879
01:36:35,903 --> 01:36:38,337
l mean, we gotta get out of the city.

880
01:36:38,743 --> 01:36:40,893
l mean, it's not just the odds
of getting shot.

881
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:44,658
Do you have any idea
what it's going to smell like in two weeks?

882
01:36:44,743 --> 01:36:47,496
Five million people rotting in the July sun.

883
01:36:50,823 --> 01:36:52,142
What is that?

884
01:36:53,903 --> 01:36:55,177
Vitamin C.

885
01:36:58,943 --> 01:37:01,616
Yeah, l'm sorry. lt's none of my business.

886
01:37:02,143 --> 01:37:03,735
Apology accepted.

887
01:37:05,303 --> 01:37:08,898
Mostly because l think you're right.
The Big Apple is baked.

888
01:37:12,143 --> 01:37:14,896
Do you really want me
to go with you, Larry?

889
01:37:15,383 --> 01:37:18,102
Yeah. You betcha.

890
01:37:20,463 --> 01:37:21,532
Good.

891
01:37:22,623 --> 01:37:23,612
When?

892
01:37:30,023 --> 01:37:32,173
l'd say the sooner the better.

893
01:37:33,783 --> 01:37:34,852
Where?

894
01:37:36,663 --> 01:37:39,700
We go west. Towards Nebraska.

895
01:37:40,823 --> 01:37:43,701
There's a town called Hemingford Home.

896
01:37:44,103 --> 01:37:45,934
Nebraska? Why Nebraska?

897
01:37:46,023 --> 01:37:48,583
l've been having these dreams about it.

898
01:37:48,943 --> 01:37:51,935
An old black woman
who calls herself Mother Abagail.

899
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:55,416
The town's real enough.
l checked the road atlas.

900
01:37:57,063 --> 01:38:00,260
You mean, you're having visions
of an old black woman?

901
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:07,693
You haven't had dreams like that?

902
01:38:23,423 --> 01:38:26,176
No, l don't dream. l never dream.

903
01:38:28,143 --> 01:38:30,293
Wait. Nadine.

904
01:38:45,543 --> 01:38:47,932
We should get out of this graveyard.

905
01:38:51,943 --> 01:38:54,411
How l love to love Nadine.

906
01:39:08,503 --> 01:39:10,414
Hey, can anybody hear me?

907
01:39:16,943 --> 01:39:18,661
Let me out!

908
01:39:21,303 --> 01:39:22,941
Let me out of here!

909
01:39:37,623 --> 01:39:38,942
You have to.

910
01:39:40,983 --> 01:39:43,099
l'm gonna starve if you don't.

911
01:39:47,183 --> 01:39:49,413
l don't want to starve to death.

912
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:52,092
Starve.

913
01:40:03,423 --> 01:40:04,776
Just in case.

914
01:40:09,623 --> 01:40:11,261
Emergency supplies.

915
01:40:20,943 --> 01:40:22,615
Anybody!

916
01:41:26,983 --> 01:41:29,178
Bombs away!

917
01:41:41,783 --> 01:41:45,822
Hey, Trash! What'd old lady Semple say
when you torched her pension check?

918
01:41:45,903 --> 01:41:49,134
-Who's there?
-People who play with fire wet the bed.

919
01:41:49,463 --> 01:41:52,660
Gonna stick you in the nuthatch
up in Terre Haute, Trash.

920
01:41:52,743 --> 01:41:56,372
Stick you in the nuthatch and give you
a few thousand shock treatments.

921
01:41:56,463 --> 01:41:57,578
Shut up!

922
01:41:57,663 --> 01:41:59,415
Keep him away from me!

923
01:42:01,743 --> 01:42:04,211
Hey, Trash, why didn't you
burn up the school?

924
01:42:09,223 --> 01:42:10,975
No one's there, Trash.

925
01:42:11,943 --> 01:42:14,662
They're all dead.
They can't hurt you anymore.

926
01:42:14,743 --> 01:42:15,732
Can't hurt me?

927
01:42:15,823 --> 01:42:18,496
-Can't tease you anymore.
-Can't tease me.

928
01:42:18,623 --> 01:42:20,022
Not anymore.

929
01:42:26,303 --> 01:42:27,816
My life for you.

930
01:42:35,703 --> 01:42:36,818
There.

931
01:42:38,583 --> 01:42:40,460
Go, Trashy. Run. Now!

932
01:42:40,743 --> 01:42:42,256
My life for you!

933
01:43:22,623 --> 01:43:24,022
Trashcan Man.

934
01:43:31,743 --> 01:43:32,812
What?

935
01:43:33,143 --> 01:43:34,542
Where are you?

936
01:43:34,903 --> 01:43:36,336
Everywhere.

937
01:43:36,703 --> 01:43:39,661
l will place you high
in my councils, Trash...

938
01:43:40,583 --> 01:43:43,939
and l will set you to burn.

939
01:43:47,103 --> 01:43:49,173
My life for you.

940
01:44:11,183 --> 01:44:12,855
You were right, Lord.

941
01:44:14,103 --> 01:44:16,094
Those prunes did the trick.

942
01:44:16,343 --> 01:44:18,811
But my, don't they taste nasty.

943
01:44:26,583 --> 01:44:29,734
''Once in every generation...

944
01:44:31,103 --> 01:44:34,015
''the plague shall fall among them.''

945
01:44:35,383 --> 01:44:37,613
That's what it says in the Book.

946
01:44:39,503 --> 01:44:43,337
Seems like you maybe
went a little too far this time....

947
01:44:47,103 --> 01:44:48,934
Rats in the corn, Lord.

948
01:44:49,983 --> 01:44:52,258
And the rats are his, ain't they?

949
01:44:53,943 --> 01:44:55,501
Welladay.

950
01:45:08,783 --> 01:45:11,536
l feel them coming in my direction.

951
01:45:13,023 --> 01:45:16,493
Some of them will be going on to him...

952
01:45:17,183 --> 01:45:18,502
won't they?

953
01:45:33,703 --> 01:45:37,059
l hear you, Lord,
and l'm in the way of doing your will.

954
01:45:38,183 --> 01:45:40,219
But l don't much like it.

955
01:45:42,863 --> 01:45:46,458
Hundred and six years old.
Seems a mite long in the tooth...

956
01:45:46,543 --> 01:45:50,855
to be leading the children of lsrael
out of Egypt.

957
01:45:52,223 --> 01:45:54,896
Or the children of America into Colorado.

958
01:46:08,463 --> 01:46:10,931
Doctor said cut out the coffee.

959
01:46:13,423 --> 01:46:15,857
But l just have only one cup a day.

960
01:46:16,543 --> 01:46:18,022
Two cups a day.

961
01:46:20,783 --> 01:46:23,172
Besides, he's dead and l'm alive.

962
01:46:28,543 --> 01:46:31,103
l do what you say, Lord. Don't l always?

963
01:46:31,103 --> 01:46:31,819
l do what you say, Lord. Don't l always?

964
01:46:33,903 --> 01:46:36,019
But even your own son prayed...

965
01:46:36,103 --> 01:46:40,893
that the cup be taken from his lips,
and l'm praying the same thing.

966
01:46:43,223 --> 01:46:45,862
Probably get about the same answer, too.

967
01:47:09,743 --> 01:47:11,859
l got the Lord to protect me!

968
01:47:12,823 --> 01:47:15,178
l ain't scared of the likes of you!

969
01:47:15,543 --> 01:47:17,534
l think you lie, old woman.

970
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:21,174
Get thee hence, low spirit!

971
01:47:21,583 --> 01:47:23,938
Turn them away if they come, Mother.

972
01:47:24,983 --> 01:47:27,975
Take my advice. Turn them away.

973
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:39,938
Your blood is in my fists, Mother.

974
01:48:03,983 --> 01:48:08,454
Dear Lord, take this evil vision
from my sight.

975
01:48:27,183 --> 01:48:30,892
lf it's your will to bring them on, God...

976
01:48:32,143 --> 01:48:35,579
better do it before l lose my guts.

977
01:48:36,623 --> 01:48:37,692
Amen.

978
01:49:08,063 --> 01:49:10,623
-Anybody home?
-Help me!

979
01:49:11,783 --> 01:49:13,216
l'm down here!

980
01:49:14,303 --> 01:49:15,861
Please help me!

981
01:49:23,743 --> 01:49:25,973
You sound pretty hungry, rabbit.

982
01:49:47,543 --> 01:49:50,501
Could you let me out of here, mister?
l'll do anything you want.

983
01:49:54,943 --> 01:49:56,296
You poor guy.

984
01:49:57,663 --> 01:49:59,301
You look like kaka.

985
01:50:01,663 --> 01:50:04,700
-Tell me something, Lloyd.
-How do you know my name?

986
01:50:04,783 --> 01:50:06,136
Lucky guess.

987
01:50:07,303 --> 01:50:09,259
How'd you stay alive so long?

988
01:50:09,343 --> 01:50:12,494
l saw it coming down
and l saved up some food. That's how.

989
01:50:17,383 --> 01:50:19,294
Brer Rat. How'd he taste?

990
01:50:27,183 --> 01:50:29,981
Poke should be here, not me.
Everything was Poke's idea.

991
01:50:30,063 --> 01:50:33,658
And you got stuck with nothing
to eat but rat tartare. Bad luck.

992
01:50:33,743 --> 01:50:35,973
Worst damn luck l ever heard of.

993
01:50:36,503 --> 01:50:39,813
But it could just be
that your luck's on the change, Lloyd.

994
01:50:39,903 --> 01:50:41,131
Look here.

995
01:50:50,303 --> 01:50:51,418
My God.

996
01:50:51,703 --> 01:50:54,820
Wait a minute, son.
You ain't seen nothing yet.

997
01:51:01,943 --> 01:51:03,342
Not bad, huh?

998
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:08,938
l never even introduced myself, did l?

999
01:51:09,023 --> 01:51:12,140
Pleased to meet you, Lloyd.
Hope you guessed my name.

1000
01:51:12,783 --> 01:51:15,661
Nothing. Just a little classical reference.

1001
01:51:16,023 --> 01:51:19,493
Actually, my name's Flagg. Randall Flagg.

1002
01:51:19,943 --> 01:51:21,456
Before l open up this cell door...

1003
01:51:21,543 --> 01:51:24,694
and take you out
for a couple of cheeseburgers and fries...

1004
01:51:25,863 --> 01:51:28,741
l think we ought to have ourselves
a little understanding.

1005
01:51:28,823 --> 01:51:31,462
l'm going to make you my foreman, Lloyd.

1006
01:51:31,783 --> 01:51:34,743
l'm gonna slip the keys
to the kingdom into your hand. l pick you.

1007
01:51:34,743 --> 01:51:35,414
l'm gonna slip the keys
to the kingdom into your hand. l pick you.

1008
01:51:36,623 --> 01:51:39,012
Do you understand that? l pick you.

1009
01:51:41,343 --> 01:51:44,335
Anyone ever done that for you
in your whole miserable life?

1010
01:51:47,943 --> 01:51:49,342
Not even Poke.

1011
01:51:50,703 --> 01:51:53,297
We just, you know, sort of fell together.

1012
01:51:56,463 --> 01:51:58,977
After that, l just kind of got left here.

1013
01:51:59,383 --> 01:52:01,135
''Kind of got left here.''

1014
01:52:02,463 --> 01:52:05,182
That's one way of putting it, l suppose.

1015
01:52:07,703 --> 01:52:12,333
Would you like to get back at those people
who'd leave a man to die in a jail like....

1016
01:52:12,423 --> 01:52:13,856
Well, like him?

1017
01:52:16,343 --> 01:52:19,574
-You bet l would.
-Of course you would.

1018
01:52:19,743 --> 01:52:23,656
But l've got a feeling
you're somebody special. A real find.

1019
01:52:24,063 --> 01:52:25,974
Not exactly a quiz kid...

1020
01:52:27,383 --> 01:52:28,975
but you are the first.

1021
01:52:29,063 --> 01:52:31,452
l'm even going to put you ahead
of Trashcan Man.

1022
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:34,103
-Who?
-Never mind.

1023
01:52:34,823 --> 01:52:37,018
l need your word
that we're gonna stick together.

1024
01:52:37,103 --> 01:52:39,333
No backstabbing,
no falling asleep on the watch.

1025
01:52:39,423 --> 01:52:42,574
Just you and me, Lloyd.
Win or lose, stand or fall.

1026
01:52:44,103 --> 01:52:46,776
You give me your promise,
l give you the key.

1027
01:52:48,423 --> 01:52:49,697
l promise.

1028
01:53:00,103 --> 01:53:01,980
You're free, Lloyd. Come on out.

1029
01:53:23,583 --> 01:53:24,936
ls that mine?

1030
01:53:40,223 --> 01:53:43,613
-Shall we bite some chow, man?
-Bite some chow, yes, you bet.

1031
01:53:44,463 --> 01:53:47,102
There's a lot to do. We have to work fast.

1032
01:53:47,183 --> 01:53:49,492
-But we can do it, can't we, Lloyd?
-Yes. You bet.

1033
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:50,982
You and me, soldier. You and me!

1034
01:54:06,303 --> 01:54:08,658
Larry, l can't do it.

1035
01:54:15,423 --> 01:54:16,822
Sure you can.

1036
01:54:17,063 --> 01:54:19,941
-l'll be with you.
-No. You don't understand.

1037
01:54:20,023 --> 01:54:24,574
l can't do it. Dark, confined places.
l can't do it. l'll go crazy.

1038
01:54:26,903 --> 01:54:29,212
-That's great.
-l'm sorry.

1039
01:54:33,423 --> 01:54:35,175
That's just great, Nadine.

1040
01:54:36,023 --> 01:54:38,935
Why you didn't tell me this
before we got 60 or so blocks...

1041
01:54:39,023 --> 01:54:41,253
from the George Washington Bridge
is beyond me.

1042
01:54:41,343 --> 01:54:43,379
Because l thought l could do it.

1043
01:54:46,543 --> 01:54:47,737
Why me?

1044
01:54:50,103 --> 01:54:52,333
And you've had plenty of those,
thank you very much.

1045
01:54:52,423 --> 01:54:54,175
-Give that back.
-No, ma'am.

1046
01:54:54,503 --> 01:54:57,813
l'm not going to stand here
in the middle of five million dead people...

1047
01:54:57,903 --> 01:55:00,019
and watch you commit suicide.

1048
01:55:00,103 --> 01:55:01,058
No!

1049
01:55:04,543 --> 01:55:05,532
Damn you.

1050
01:55:09,863 --> 01:55:12,661
-Where are you going?
-Going to the George Washington Bridge.

1051
01:55:12,743 --> 01:55:14,017
By myself.

1052
01:55:17,143 --> 01:55:21,580
l don't need this prima donna act, missy.
l really don't.

1053
01:55:22,423 --> 01:55:26,621
You have fun getting raped and murdered
back on Seventh Avenue, sweetheart.

1054
01:55:44,863 --> 01:55:47,093
Come on back. This is crazy.

1055
01:55:48,863 --> 01:55:50,455
l'm sorry, okay?

1056
01:55:50,583 --> 01:55:54,417
lf it has to be the bridge, that's fine.
Just don't do it alone.

1057
01:56:02,903 --> 01:56:04,382
The hell with you.

1058
01:56:11,383 --> 01:56:13,055
l'm going in now!

1059
01:57:08,543 --> 01:57:10,374
Don't look at them, stupid.

1060
01:57:34,423 --> 01:57:35,572
Larry.

1061
01:58:47,623 --> 01:58:48,817
Who's there?

1062
01:58:50,823 --> 01:58:52,495
ldentify yourself!

1063
01:58:58,303 --> 01:59:01,295
You better start talking
before l start shooting here!

1064
01:59:10,263 --> 01:59:13,141
Larry, please stop shooting!

1065
01:59:17,863 --> 01:59:20,377
Nadine, you stay where you are,
do you hear me?

1066
01:59:32,503 --> 01:59:34,733
Are you hurt? Did l shoot you?

1067
01:59:34,823 --> 01:59:36,302
No, but l felt the wind....

1068
01:59:36,383 --> 01:59:38,738
One came by so close l felt the wind of it...

1069
01:59:38,823 --> 01:59:43,260
and the tile chips on my face.
l think l cut my face--

1070
01:59:43,623 --> 01:59:45,102
God, l'm so sorry.

1071
01:59:45,183 --> 01:59:46,901
-lt's okay.
-l'm sorry.

1072
01:59:51,343 --> 01:59:54,221
Are you still mad about the pills?

1073
01:59:54,303 --> 01:59:56,976
-No.
-'Cause l won't take the pills, Larry.

1074
01:59:57,343 --> 01:59:59,379
lt's okay.

1075
02:00:25,183 --> 02:00:26,582
Oh, dear God.

1076
02:00:47,023 --> 02:00:48,297
l tell you...

1077
02:00:49,823 --> 02:00:51,939
Jersey never smelled so good.

1078
02:01:25,783 --> 02:01:28,251
l don't think you're singing that just right.

1079
02:01:29,423 --> 02:01:30,572
Take it easy.

1080
02:01:31,743 --> 02:01:33,620
lt's okay, l'm a friend.

1081
02:01:33,943 --> 02:01:35,899
Well, l certainly hope so.

1082
02:01:39,783 --> 02:01:43,332
Just think of it as home defense
while on the road.

1083
02:01:44,023 --> 02:01:46,457
All right, l certainly will.

1084
02:01:47,103 --> 02:01:51,335
-Glen Bateman at your service.
-Stu Redman. Originally from east Texas.

1085
02:01:52,703 --> 02:01:54,898
Kojak, say hello to Stu Redman.

1086
02:01:55,423 --> 02:01:57,414
He's such a miserable dog.

1087
02:01:58,623 --> 02:02:00,500
Don't be too hard on him.

1088
02:02:02,343 --> 02:02:04,652
He's the first dog l've seen in...

1089
02:02:07,863 --> 02:02:09,819
well, since the third week of June.

1090
02:02:09,903 --> 02:02:14,419
Yeah. The superflu took most of the dogs
right along with their idiot masters.

1091
02:02:14,703 --> 02:02:16,056
Most unfair.

1092
02:02:20,103 --> 02:02:23,573
lt might not be a bad idea
to paint with your glasses on.

1093
02:02:23,903 --> 02:02:25,973
Not when you paint like l do.

1094
02:03:01,623 --> 02:03:04,854
l can't do this, Larry. l just.... Not now.

1095
02:03:05,263 --> 02:03:08,539
You can. Sure you can.
You can do anything.

1096
02:03:14,903 --> 02:03:16,700
No, l can't.

1097
02:03:30,543 --> 02:03:31,862
l want you.

1098
02:03:38,743 --> 02:03:40,779
-l know, but--
-Do you want me?

1099
02:03:43,223 --> 02:03:44,497
l know you do.

1100
02:03:46,383 --> 02:03:47,862
So what's the problem?

1101
02:03:49,303 --> 02:03:51,100
l just...

1102
02:03:53,663 --> 02:03:55,096
need more time.

1103
02:03:58,423 --> 02:04:00,015
lt's the dreams?

1104
02:04:02,183 --> 02:04:04,651
-l told you, l don't dream.
-Come on, Nadine.

1105
02:04:09,503 --> 02:04:11,221
l had the same dreams.

1106
02:04:16,023 --> 02:04:19,060
l don't know anything about that. l just....

1107
02:04:23,263 --> 02:04:25,094
l just need more time.

1108
02:04:28,263 --> 02:04:29,537
Yeah, sure.

1109
02:04:31,943 --> 02:04:33,262
Time l got.

1110
02:04:34,943 --> 02:04:36,217
Thank you.

1111
02:05:09,663 --> 02:05:12,894
Folks round these parts
just call me Mother Abagail.

1112
02:05:14,303 --> 02:05:17,898
You'll be coming along to see me,
won't you, Larry?

1113
02:05:19,703 --> 02:05:20,658
Yeah.

1114
02:05:21,983 --> 02:05:23,655
Hemingford Home...

1115
02:05:24,943 --> 02:05:26,342
or Boulder.

1116
02:05:27,343 --> 02:05:29,174
One place or the other.

1117
02:05:36,383 --> 02:05:38,658
So cold.

1118
02:05:39,503 --> 02:05:41,971
No, he's warm. Not you.

1119
02:05:43,743 --> 02:05:45,938
But l'm the one you belong to, Nadine.

1120
02:05:46,503 --> 02:05:48,858
-You are the promised one.
-Why me?

1121
02:05:49,423 --> 02:05:50,776
Who promised?

1122
02:05:53,823 --> 02:05:55,256
That doesn't matter.

1123
02:06:00,943 --> 02:06:03,298
Nadine. My love.

1124
02:06:05,943 --> 02:06:09,413
As long as you hide your mind
from the old woman, you'll be fine.

1125
02:06:11,223 --> 02:06:15,057
-When you come to me, we'll be married.
-Married.

1126
02:06:16,983 --> 02:06:21,374
But l want you to leave
the one you're traveling with. Tonight.

1127
02:06:21,903 --> 02:06:25,054
l can handle Larry. He's just a boy.

1128
02:06:26,823 --> 02:06:28,097
Leave him.

1129
02:07:04,583 --> 02:07:07,495
Larry, by the time you read this,
l'll be gone.

1130
02:07:07,583 --> 02:07:10,859
lf l stay, we'll end up sleeping together,
and l can't have that.

1131
02:07:10,943 --> 02:07:13,855
l have my reasons. Thanks for being there.

1132
02:07:13,943 --> 02:07:16,503
l'll see you again. Much love, Nadine.

1133
02:07:18,543 --> 02:07:20,738
You were right about the dreams.

1134
02:08:20,383 --> 02:08:21,975
Hey, mister, watch out!

1135
02:08:32,783 --> 02:08:36,014
Holy G, mister, but you took a tumble.

1136
02:08:36,103 --> 02:08:38,458
Didn't you just? My laws.

1137
02:08:40,263 --> 02:08:43,858
l'm sorry if l scared you, mister,
but you scared me, too.

1138
02:08:44,463 --> 02:08:47,455
You're the first person l've seen
in just about forever.

1139
02:08:52,303 --> 02:08:54,294
l made that, mister. You like it?

1140
02:08:57,543 --> 02:08:58,737
You bet.

1141
02:08:58,823 --> 02:09:02,736
l got them dummies from the window
of Landon's on the highway to Okie City.

1142
02:09:03,423 --> 02:09:06,972
l thought a few decorations
would cheer up Main Street.

1143
02:09:07,583 --> 02:09:10,097
lt's been awful sad with everyone gone.

1144
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:12,296
Do you like them?

1145
02:09:15,183 --> 02:09:17,981
Thanks. Decoration is my hobby.

1146
02:09:19,143 --> 02:09:21,782
M-O-O-N. That spells ''hobby.''

1147
02:09:23,943 --> 02:09:27,697
Do you want to go on up the street
to the drugstore and get a Band-Aid?

1148
02:09:28,143 --> 02:09:32,375
We can just take it if we want.
Everyone's gone, so it's not like stealing.

1149
02:09:38,743 --> 02:09:40,859
Sure don't talk much, do you?

1150
02:09:50,823 --> 02:09:53,018
l'm sorry, mister, l can't read.

1151
02:09:56,543 --> 02:09:58,738
Just a few little words is all.

1152
02:09:58,823 --> 02:10:03,180
l went to school. l made it to the
third grade, but then l kind of pooped out.

1153
02:10:03,383 --> 02:10:07,899
l could read some Curious George
when l left, but since then l kind of forgot.

1154
02:10:34,303 --> 02:10:36,612
l'm sorry, mister, l don't get you.

1155
02:10:44,223 --> 02:10:47,579
My daddy always said
l was a little slow on the upchuck.

1156
02:10:48,663 --> 02:10:50,096
That's a joke.

1157
02:10:50,423 --> 02:10:52,891
My daddy was always joking around and....

1158
02:11:00,023 --> 02:11:01,422
l got it, mister!

1159
02:11:03,063 --> 02:11:06,135
You're just like
old Albion Packalotte's hired man.

1160
02:11:06,223 --> 02:11:08,339
Tom Cullen knows what that is.

1161
02:11:08,423 --> 02:11:11,972
M-O-O-N. That spells ''deaf and dumb''!

1162
02:11:25,743 --> 02:11:28,098
When they all coming back, mister?

1163
02:11:29,823 --> 02:11:32,337
l know where they went, laws, yes.

1164
02:11:33,263 --> 02:11:35,493
They up and went to Kansas City.

1165
02:11:37,783 --> 02:11:40,581
They're always talking
about what a dull town this is...

1166
02:11:40,663 --> 02:11:43,257
since the roller rink went bust.

1167
02:11:43,783 --> 02:11:47,139
There's just the drive-in theater
out on Route 61 .

1168
02:11:47,303 --> 02:11:51,660
All they show is them diddly-daddly
pictures and they're all rated ''X.''

1169
02:11:52,183 --> 02:11:54,902
M-O-O-N. That spells ''X.''

1170
02:11:56,383 --> 02:11:58,578
So they all went to Kansas City.

1171
02:12:02,023 --> 02:12:05,140
Except my mama.
She caught a cold and died.

1172
02:12:06,103 --> 02:12:08,663
l put her in the cemetery my own self.

1173
02:12:10,543 --> 02:12:13,819
So she didn't go to Kansas City
with the rest of them.

1174
02:12:14,103 --> 02:12:17,778
She's up in heaven.
She's eating the bread of life with Jesus.

1175
02:12:35,583 --> 02:12:38,620
Mister, if you're going to Kansas City,
can l go with you?

1176
02:12:38,743 --> 02:12:40,301
l ain't never been...

1177
02:12:40,623 --> 02:12:42,773
and l don't want to stay here anymore.

1178
02:12:42,943 --> 02:12:46,299
lt's lonely and it's scary at night.

1179
02:13:09,743 --> 02:13:12,416
Drive a car? Tom Cullen?

1180
02:13:12,823 --> 02:13:14,017
Laws, no.

1181
02:13:16,983 --> 02:13:19,451
l guess you can't drive a car, either.

1182
02:13:31,063 --> 02:13:33,418
l got just the thing for you, ma'am.

1183
02:13:38,583 --> 02:13:41,495
Hey, mister, nice bike. Who's it for?

1184
02:13:48,023 --> 02:13:51,095
You want me to go with you?
To Kansas City?

1185
02:13:54,583 --> 02:13:56,460
To see the old black lady?

1186
02:14:03,983 --> 02:14:07,896
That's right.
She lives in a little house in the corn.

1187
02:14:08,303 --> 02:14:10,612
She plays her guitar on the porch.

1188
02:14:11,423 --> 02:14:15,780
l don't mind going to see her, but
we won't go see the other one, will we?

1189
02:14:16,423 --> 02:14:19,256
The one that turns into a crow
and flies away?

1190
02:14:21,143 --> 02:14:23,782
He wears boots and jeans...

1191
02:14:23,863 --> 02:14:26,696
and a jacket with special buttons on it.

1192
02:14:27,543 --> 02:14:28,942
Face buttons.

1193
02:14:29,663 --> 02:14:33,099
He looks like a man,
but l don't think he's really a man.

1194
02:14:33,343 --> 02:14:35,857
We won't go near him, will we, mister?

1195
02:14:37,063 --> 02:14:39,816
Okay, then. All right, l'm ready.

1196
02:14:40,503 --> 02:14:44,815
Laws, yes. M-O-O-N. That spells ''ready.''

1197
02:14:58,383 --> 02:15:01,500
M-O-O-N. That spells ''Nebraska''!

1198
02:15:27,543 --> 02:15:29,738
Time to get going, Stuart.

1199
02:15:30,503 --> 02:15:32,095
You come see me.

1200
02:15:33,303 --> 02:15:34,656
Who are you?

1201
02:15:36,063 --> 02:15:38,657
-Who are you really?
-Your last hope.

1202
02:15:39,983 --> 02:15:42,451
lf you miss me in Hemingford Home...

1203
02:15:42,863 --> 02:15:46,378
we'll be moving on to Colorado.
l think you know where.

1204
02:15:46,903 --> 02:15:48,734
Boulder. But....

1205
02:15:51,223 --> 02:15:52,861
The rats are his.

1206
02:16:37,303 --> 02:16:41,421
Stay away from her, East Texas.
Stay away or you'll all die.

1207
02:16:50,983 --> 02:16:52,052
The plague!

1208
02:16:56,783 --> 02:17:01,459
You come on along and see me.
You and all your friends.

1209
02:17:06,703 --> 02:17:10,491
Damn dreams are going to drive me crazy
if l don't do something.

1210
02:17:11,943 --> 02:17:15,618
So l'm gonna go to Nebraska.
l gotta find out what this means.

1211
02:17:16,823 --> 02:17:19,178
-You want to come with me?
-Why not?

1212
02:17:19,743 --> 02:17:22,735
Always assuming we can find
a motorcycle with a sidecar.

1213
02:17:22,823 --> 02:17:24,575
l'm not leaving Kojak.

1214
02:17:25,743 --> 02:17:28,018
Well, you don't sound very enthusiastic.

1215
02:17:29,783 --> 02:17:32,058
When l lose sleep, l get cranky.

1216
02:17:34,543 --> 02:17:35,862
Bad dreams?

1217
02:17:38,103 --> 02:17:40,856
The name of the guy in the desert is Flagg.

1218
02:17:41,383 --> 02:17:44,739
And l think he's crucifying anyone
who gets in his way.

1219
02:17:49,623 --> 02:17:51,703
Let's say we go out there to Nebraska
and the old woman's there.

1220
02:17:51,703 --> 02:17:54,012
Let's say we go out there to Nebraska
and the old woman's there.

1221
02:17:54,783 --> 02:17:57,775
''Folks round these parts
call me Mother Abagail.

1222
02:17:58,183 --> 02:18:02,301
''l'm 106 years old
and still make my own bread.''

1223
02:18:03,303 --> 02:18:04,861
Yeah, that's her.

1224
02:18:05,223 --> 02:18:08,181
Let's say she's real. Then what?

1225
02:18:08,263 --> 02:18:10,857
Well, it's obvious
she's some sort of magnet.

1226
02:18:10,943 --> 02:18:14,219
So l suppose we start building
the whole sorry mess up again...

1227
02:18:14,303 --> 02:18:16,373
using her as magnetic north.

1228
02:18:17,623 --> 02:18:19,136
You hear that?

1229
02:18:52,423 --> 02:18:53,981
How you doing?

1230
02:18:55,263 --> 02:18:58,573
l'm Stu Redman.
This here's Glen Bateman.

1231
02:18:59,303 --> 02:19:02,215
And that furry one over there, that's Kojak.

1232
02:19:02,303 --> 02:19:03,452
Fran Goldsmith.

1233
02:19:04,903 --> 02:19:08,418
-We're glad to meet you.
-And we're glad to see you.

1234
02:19:08,863 --> 02:19:11,013
-Aren't we, Harold?
-l don't know.

1235
02:19:11,383 --> 02:19:13,021
Do we assume they're all right...

1236
02:19:13,103 --> 02:19:15,936
just because they remember
how to shake hands?

1237
02:19:16,743 --> 02:19:18,938
No harm intended here, Mr....

1238
02:19:20,743 --> 02:19:22,654
Lauder. Harold Lauder.

1239
02:19:24,383 --> 02:19:28,092
Harold, l don't think l'm ever going to get
these calluses off my fanny.

1240
02:19:30,303 --> 02:19:31,622
Where are you folks headed?

1241
02:19:31,703 --> 02:19:34,661
-Nebraska.
-Stovington, Vermont.

1242
02:19:41,223 --> 02:19:42,656
What? What's wrong?

1243
02:19:43,463 --> 02:19:46,500
Going to Stovington
would be a waste of your time.

1244
02:19:47,183 --> 02:19:49,572
l hardly think you're the best judge of that.

1245
02:19:49,663 --> 02:19:52,814
He was there. And he knows.
They tried to kill him.

1246
02:19:53,303 --> 02:19:55,294
-Really?
-Yeah.

1247
02:19:57,063 --> 02:19:58,212
Look...

1248
02:20:00,383 --> 02:20:03,341
Glen and l were about ready
to head to Nebraska.

1249
02:20:05,823 --> 02:20:10,260
We've been having the same dream--

1250
02:20:10,343 --> 02:20:12,140
The dreams are an aberration.

1251
02:20:14,783 --> 02:20:18,856
Maybe, but we're all headed
in the same direction.

1252
02:20:18,943 --> 02:20:20,501
-Why don't we go together?
-Okay.

1253
02:20:20,583 --> 02:20:22,062
-No.
-Harold.

1254
02:20:24,303 --> 02:20:26,180
l don't like the looks of them.

1255
02:20:27,343 --> 02:20:29,174
This one in particular.

1256
02:20:34,983 --> 02:20:38,259
Can l talk to you for a second? Come on.

1257
02:20:45,383 --> 02:20:49,058
l'm gonna talk straight to you now, okay?
Between you and me.

1258
02:20:50,623 --> 02:20:53,012
l do not want to cut in on you here.

1259
02:20:53,343 --> 02:20:56,255
That's the last thing in the world
that l want.

1260
02:20:58,383 --> 02:21:00,738
Relax. The last thing in the world.

1261
02:21:18,863 --> 02:21:20,182
Here you go.

1262
02:21:23,103 --> 02:21:24,172
-Okay.
-No, thanks.

1263
02:21:24,543 --> 02:21:25,771
You sure?

1264
02:21:33,903 --> 02:21:35,621
Not bad. Cold.

1265
02:21:35,983 --> 02:21:37,462
Enjoy it.

1266
02:21:37,543 --> 02:21:41,616
l have a feeling there's gonna be
a shortage of cold beer this summer.

1267
02:21:43,143 --> 02:21:46,340
-l still want to check Stovington.
-Harold, why?

1268
02:21:47,703 --> 02:21:49,375
Let's just say l'm from Missouri.

1269
02:21:49,463 --> 02:21:52,899
And l don't always take the word
of people l just met as gospel.

1270
02:21:55,063 --> 02:21:56,337
All right.

1271
02:21:57,943 --> 02:22:01,219
But there isn't anything there
you're gonna wanna see.

1272
02:22:42,303 --> 02:22:43,975
Still from Missouri?

1273
02:23:10,783 --> 02:23:15,334
You was right. l never should have
eaten all them apples. Laws, no.

1274
02:23:21,943 --> 02:23:23,501
Where you going?

1275
02:23:27,823 --> 02:23:32,374
Don't worry, l ain't going nowhere.
My legs feel all funny.

1276
02:24:28,183 --> 02:24:31,220
My God. Are you real?

1277
02:24:42,863 --> 02:24:44,979
lf you're real, say something.

1278
02:24:57,183 --> 02:24:58,855
Are you a deaf-mute?

1279
02:25:04,063 --> 02:25:07,260
Somebody finally shows up
in this crappy town...

1280
02:25:07,343 --> 02:25:09,698
and it turns out to be a deaf-mute.

1281
02:25:13,863 --> 02:25:17,492
Well, hi. My name's Julie Lawry.

1282
02:25:19,263 --> 02:25:21,254
You can't tell me yours, can you?

1283
02:25:23,223 --> 02:25:24,417
Poor you.

1284
02:25:29,383 --> 02:25:31,374
Does baby have a sad tummy?

1285
02:25:42,303 --> 02:25:43,895
Ain't he a moose?

1286
02:25:50,623 --> 02:25:55,333
''l'm Nick Andros. My friend is Tom Cullen.
He's mildly retarded.''

1287
02:26:00,583 --> 02:26:03,143
A retard and a deaf-mute. Just my luck.

1288
02:26:03,903 --> 02:26:04,972
What?

1289
02:26:15,143 --> 02:26:17,941
Do all deaf-mutes have such big guns?

1290
02:26:21,303 --> 02:26:22,782
They do?

1291
02:26:47,583 --> 02:26:48,777
Peekaboo.

1292
02:26:50,703 --> 02:26:52,182
What?

1293
02:26:53,703 --> 02:26:56,263
No. Hold me.

1294
02:26:56,903 --> 02:26:58,495
You gotta hold me.

1295
02:26:59,863 --> 02:27:01,455
l've been lonely.

1296
02:27:25,503 --> 02:27:27,334
No, no. What's that?

1297
02:27:28,823 --> 02:27:30,461
He's just a retard.

1298
02:27:30,543 --> 02:27:33,455
He doesn't feel things
the way that you and l do.

1299
02:27:33,543 --> 02:27:34,862
He can wait.

1300
02:27:47,263 --> 02:27:48,332
What?

1301
02:27:51,383 --> 02:27:52,577
Get out.

1302
02:27:53,383 --> 02:27:54,782
Stupid dummy.

1303
02:28:01,943 --> 02:28:04,503
lt was those apples. Laws, yes.

1304
02:28:05,103 --> 02:28:09,142
l don't want it. No, sir. Say, who's that?

1305
02:28:10,983 --> 02:28:12,860
How you doing, cutie-pie?

1306
02:28:13,943 --> 02:28:16,457
l heard you weren't feeling too good.

1307
02:28:17,143 --> 02:28:18,974
Your name's Tom, right?

1308
02:28:20,343 --> 02:28:21,617
Tom Cullen.

1309
02:28:22,103 --> 02:28:26,016
-M-O-O-N. That spells ''Tom Cullen.''
-Yes.

1310
02:28:27,063 --> 02:28:29,213
l don't want medicine, mister.

1311
02:28:29,303 --> 02:28:32,534
That's right. You know what l know
about that stuff? That stuff's poison.

1312
02:28:32,623 --> 02:28:37,333
No, sir. Tom Cullen doesn't drink poison.
Daddy said, ''Don't you ever.''

1313
02:28:37,423 --> 02:28:40,779
Daddy said if it killed the rats
in the barn, it'd kill me, too.

1314
02:28:40,863 --> 02:28:44,094
Please don't make me
drink it, mister. Please.

1315
02:28:46,463 --> 02:28:49,614
His daddy said, ''Don't do it.''
Don't make him do it.

1316
02:28:57,023 --> 02:28:59,856
l got Mighty Mouse here with pink lips...

1317
02:28:59,943 --> 02:29:03,060
and a big old moose over there
crying just like a baby.

1318
02:29:07,583 --> 02:29:09,255
Dummy freak bastard!

1319
02:29:19,663 --> 02:29:22,177
Yeah, that's right. You wouldn't dare.

1320
02:29:25,823 --> 02:29:28,383
Please. Don't fight.

1321
02:29:28,543 --> 02:29:31,615
l feel better now. l can go on, see?

1322
02:29:48,943 --> 02:29:51,218
Fine, l'll read your crappy note.

1323
02:29:57,943 --> 02:30:01,413
lt was just a joke, dummy. lt was a joke.

1324
02:30:02,943 --> 02:30:06,094
Joke, stupid. lt was a joke!

1325
02:30:10,023 --> 02:30:12,583
l'm gonna get you.
You and your stupid freak friend.

1326
02:30:12,663 --> 02:30:14,813
l'm gonna get both of you guys!

1327
02:30:40,383 --> 02:30:43,295
Sorry, mister. l cry like a baby.

1328
02:30:43,823 --> 02:30:46,462
But she scared me. Laws, yes.

1329
02:30:52,303 --> 02:30:53,531
You, too?

1330
02:31:09,103 --> 02:31:10,377
Laws, yes!

1331
02:31:10,663 --> 02:31:13,575
Let's get out of here
before she comes back.

1332
02:31:19,263 --> 02:31:23,097
She's shooting at us!
Come on, mister, we gotta get out of here!

1333
02:31:26,663 --> 02:31:29,223
Come on! l want to see you run!

1334
02:31:37,463 --> 02:31:41,251
lf l ever see any of you two
in my face again, l'll kill you!

1335
02:32:38,783 --> 02:32:41,013
Hot. Laws, yes.

1336
02:32:50,423 --> 02:32:51,742
What is it?

1337
02:32:57,063 --> 02:33:01,853
Mister, we gotta go. We gotta hide!
What if.... That could be her!

1338
02:33:07,063 --> 02:33:09,816
She's back there.
Laws, yes, Tom knows that...

1339
02:33:11,343 --> 02:33:13,538
but what if that one's like her?

1340
02:33:23,183 --> 02:33:26,459
He might be like us? Nice, like us?

1341
02:33:59,503 --> 02:34:02,734
Holy crow! Am l glad to see you fellows.

1342
02:34:05,263 --> 02:34:07,333
You boys headed to Nebraska?

1343
02:34:09,423 --> 02:34:13,336
My friend can't talk.
He's deaf and dumb. But he's smart.

1344
02:34:16,503 --> 02:34:19,336
l bet he is. He got that look, don't he?

1345
02:34:20,223 --> 02:34:21,975
Name's Ralph Brentner.

1346
02:34:23,543 --> 02:34:24,976
l'm Tom Cullen.

1347
02:34:25,183 --> 02:34:27,981
M-O-O-N. That spells ''Tom Cullen.''

1348
02:34:28,943 --> 02:34:33,698
l don't know his name 'cause l can't
read it. Sure wish l did, though. Laws, yes.

1349
02:34:44,303 --> 02:34:47,056
Your friend's name here is Nick Andros.

1350
02:34:47,983 --> 02:34:50,099
M-O-O-N. l guess that spells ''Nick.''

1351
02:34:50,983 --> 02:34:53,178
Nick Andros. How you doing?

1352
02:34:56,903 --> 02:34:58,780
Why don't you boys climb on in?

1353
02:34:59,263 --> 02:35:01,731
We got some miles to turn before dark.

1354
02:36:21,183 --> 02:36:22,502
Thank God!

1355
02:36:22,863 --> 02:36:26,572
l'm so happy.
We're so happy to see someone else.

1356
02:36:26,903 --> 02:36:27,972
Right, Joe?

1357
02:36:28,823 --> 02:36:31,895
-l'm so pleased to meet you.
-Same here, believe me.

1358
02:36:33,463 --> 02:36:35,055
How you doing, son?

1359
02:36:35,863 --> 02:36:36,898
Joe!

1360
02:36:37,623 --> 02:36:39,022
Put that away.

1361
02:36:39,103 --> 02:36:42,140
Nice kid. Has he had his rabies shots yet?

1362
02:36:42,423 --> 02:36:46,336
l'm sorry. He's been traumatized.

1363
02:36:47,063 --> 02:36:48,337
Haven't we all?

1364
02:36:49,423 --> 02:36:50,776
l suppose so.

1365
02:36:54,623 --> 02:36:56,102
l'm Lucy Swann.

1366
02:37:00,463 --> 02:37:01,737
The boy...

1367
02:37:02,583 --> 02:37:05,302
l found him in a supermarket in lowa City.

1368
02:37:05,503 --> 02:37:08,654
He was just wandering around
and eating sweet stuff.

1369
02:37:09,543 --> 02:37:11,693
Back then, he was almost feral.

1370
02:37:12,103 --> 02:37:14,219
You took him with you anyway.

1371
02:37:15,023 --> 02:37:16,854
He would have died on his own.

1372
02:37:22,183 --> 02:37:26,256
So what do you think happened here?
l mean, you think it was lightning, or....

1373
02:37:26,783 --> 02:37:28,614
lt started around dusk.

1374
02:37:28,783 --> 02:37:32,219
lt was a whole series of explosions
on the west side of town...

1375
02:37:32,303 --> 02:37:33,895
where the tank farms are.

1376
02:37:34,263 --> 02:37:36,982
Then, later that night, there was a wind...

1377
02:37:37,343 --> 02:37:39,982
and by morning,
the rest of the city was gone.

1378
02:37:40,063 --> 02:37:41,382
l'd say it was set.

1379
02:37:43,543 --> 02:37:46,899
You think somebody deliberately burned
Des Moines to the ground?

1380
02:37:47,583 --> 02:37:48,618
Yes.

1381
02:37:53,263 --> 02:37:56,892
Who'd want to burn a whole city
to the ground, for God's sakes?

1382
02:38:05,383 --> 02:38:07,294
Cibola.

1383
02:38:11,463 --> 02:38:13,658
My life for you.

1384
02:38:16,903 --> 02:38:21,613
l will set you high in my councils,
and l will set you to burn.

1385
02:38:25,383 --> 02:38:26,611
Cibola.

1386
02:38:27,383 --> 02:38:31,058
The city, as promised.

1387
02:38:48,863 --> 02:38:52,538
Thank you, Lord.
l didn't drop it on the floor.

1388
02:38:55,983 --> 02:38:58,577
Now, Lord, l ain't picked the corn yet.

1389
02:38:59,343 --> 02:39:03,302
Maybe some of those men you're sending
will help me out.

1390
02:39:25,143 --> 02:39:28,021
Thank you, my Lord,
for bringing them to me.

1391
02:39:30,743 --> 02:39:32,176
Hello, Mother.

1392
02:39:33,663 --> 02:39:36,735
Ralph Brentner.
l'm so pleased to meet you.

1393
02:39:40,143 --> 02:39:43,613
We never made a single wrong turn.
Nick here knew just how to come.

1394
02:39:47,703 --> 02:39:49,022
Hello, Nick.

1395
02:39:51,143 --> 02:39:53,054
Glad to see you.

1396
02:39:54,183 --> 02:39:55,411
God bless.

1397
02:39:58,383 --> 02:40:00,817
You've done it, Nick.
You've brought them through.

1398
02:40:01,423 --> 02:40:03,539
You're the first of many.

1399
02:40:04,783 --> 02:40:06,375
You're all welcome here.

1400
02:40:06,863 --> 02:40:10,697
Our time is very short,
but we'll break bread together...

1401
02:40:10,783 --> 02:40:13,251
and have some fellowship,
one with the other.

1402
02:40:13,343 --> 02:40:15,811
-Granny lady?
-What, honey?

1403
02:40:16,223 --> 02:40:18,612
Are you the oldest lady in the world?

1404
02:40:18,983 --> 02:40:21,019
Gina. That's not polite.

1405
02:40:21,943 --> 02:40:25,538
Mayhap so, sweetheart. Mayhap so.

1406
02:40:39,863 --> 02:40:41,854
That was a dilly of a meal, ma'am.

1407
02:40:42,423 --> 02:40:43,856
lt wasn't bad.

1408
02:40:44,223 --> 02:40:45,895
Birds was a little tough.

1409
02:40:46,383 --> 02:40:48,977
''But it's a hell of a lot tougher
where there's none''...

1410
02:40:49,063 --> 02:40:50,815
my own mama used to say.

1411
02:40:51,703 --> 02:40:55,821
Now l've made up a cot for the little one
in the back room.

1412
02:40:56,823 --> 02:40:59,940
-The woman, what's her name, Ralph?
-Susan. Susan Stern.

1413
02:41:01,183 --> 02:41:05,176
A goodish name.
She can bunk with the tot.

1414
02:41:08,263 --> 02:41:12,461
How did you know to come to me
in the first place?

1415
02:41:15,943 --> 02:41:17,899
We dreamed of you, Mother.

1416
02:41:18,543 --> 02:41:20,499
Of you and the other fellow.

1417
02:41:23,183 --> 02:41:24,696
The other fellow.

1418
02:41:27,943 --> 02:41:30,138
Come on, you. Time for bed.

1419
02:41:33,423 --> 02:41:35,300
God bless the child.

1420
02:41:37,023 --> 02:41:40,299
God bless the child that's got her own.

1421
02:41:43,463 --> 02:41:44,862
l was told...

1422
02:41:45,303 --> 02:41:48,534
that we're gonna be
like a snowball rolling downhill...

1423
02:41:48,743 --> 02:41:51,382
picking up other people as we head west.

1424
02:41:52,103 --> 02:41:54,412
Told? Told by who, Mother?

1425
02:41:54,823 --> 02:41:56,142
Told by God.

1426
02:41:56,623 --> 02:42:01,333
l tried not to hear what God had to tell me
but you can see all the good it done.

1427
02:42:04,983 --> 02:42:07,099
You been drafted, too, Nick.

1428
02:42:07,463 --> 02:42:09,897
God has his finger on your heart.

1429
02:42:10,583 --> 02:42:13,620
And He's got more fingers than one.

1430
02:42:14,503 --> 02:42:18,018
There's dark work ahead
for his chosen ones.

1431
02:42:19,503 --> 02:42:21,061
Dark and bloody.

1432
02:42:34,463 --> 02:42:35,691
Ma'am...

1433
02:42:36,623 --> 02:42:39,740
what if this dark man
we've been dreaming about isn't real?

1434
02:42:40,183 --> 02:42:43,937
What if he's, what do you call it,
a bogeyman?

1435
02:42:44,983 --> 02:42:47,497
You dreamed of me. Am l the bogeyman?

1436
02:42:49,463 --> 02:42:50,612
No, ma'am.

1437
02:42:50,703 --> 02:42:52,421
He's real all right...

1438
02:42:53,903 --> 02:42:57,134
and it's our lot to deal with him.

1439
02:42:57,223 --> 02:42:59,532
God don't explain his will...

1440
02:42:59,783 --> 02:43:02,058
to the likes of Abby Freemantle.

1441
02:43:11,863 --> 02:43:12,898
Well?

1442
02:43:15,503 --> 02:43:16,822
Nick says....

1443
02:43:20,743 --> 02:43:22,973
He says he don't believe in God.

1444
02:43:28,903 --> 02:43:32,179
God bless you, Nick, but it don't matter.

1445
02:43:33,143 --> 02:43:35,532
He believes in you.

1446
02:44:07,103 --> 02:44:08,331
l'm fine.

1447
02:44:10,023 --> 02:44:12,332
Just thinking some long thoughts.

1448
02:44:16,503 --> 02:44:19,415
My daddy owned all this once.

1449
02:44:20,543 --> 02:44:22,340
As far as your eye can see.

1450
02:44:29,823 --> 02:44:31,814
And my brothers lost it...

1451
02:44:32,143 --> 02:44:34,657
a piece at a time, after he was gone.

1452
02:44:35,743 --> 02:44:37,062
Finally...

1453
02:44:38,143 --> 02:44:40,782
the only thing left was the home place.

1454
02:44:42,743 --> 02:44:44,973
What l said to myself was:

1455
02:44:45,983 --> 02:44:49,293
''Don't worry, Ab. They can have the rest.

1456
02:44:49,383 --> 02:44:51,897
''l'll hang on to the home place...

1457
02:44:54,023 --> 02:44:55,581
''come what may.''

1458
02:44:58,743 --> 02:45:00,176
And now look at this.

1459
02:45:01,743 --> 02:45:05,452
Look at my things,
sitting in the back of that damn truck.

1460
02:45:07,303 --> 02:45:10,454
And look at me, getting moved on...

1461
02:45:11,423 --> 02:45:14,620
like a vagrant turned out of a boxcar
by railroad dick.

1462
02:45:18,223 --> 02:45:19,895
ls that what God is?

1463
02:45:21,423 --> 02:45:24,813
A big old railroad dick,
who'd like to whop you upside your head...

1464
02:45:24,903 --> 02:45:28,452
if you don't step as lively
as he wants you to step?

1465
02:45:30,783 --> 02:45:32,216
Oh, Jesus!

1466
02:45:42,463 --> 02:45:43,976
You guys coming?

1467
02:45:44,343 --> 02:45:45,981
Daylight's wasting.

1468
02:45:54,663 --> 02:45:56,062
Come on, Nick...

1469
02:45:58,823 --> 02:46:00,415
Ralph's waiting.

1470
02:46:19,823 --> 02:46:21,097
All right.

1471
02:46:22,423 --> 02:46:23,697
Let's go.

1472
02:46:33,063 --> 02:46:34,815
Boulder, here we come!

1473
02:47:58,343 --> 02:47:59,537
Cibola !

1474
02:48:06,503 --> 02:48:09,256
My life for you.

1475
02:48:19,863 --> 02:48:22,252
Wonderful city of gold!

1476
02:48:22,823 --> 02:48:25,895
Seven in one. My life for you.

1477
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:42,102
Anybody here?

1478
02:49:11,463 --> 02:49:14,614
-What are we gonna do with him?
-Let him sleep. Flagg wants him.

1479
02:49:14,703 --> 02:49:16,534
Where is Flagg, anyway?

1480
02:49:17,863 --> 02:49:20,058
You that anxious to see him, Barry?

1481
02:49:21,023 --> 02:49:23,378
l just thought....

1482
02:49:24,383 --> 02:49:27,216
Flagg will be around.
He's been waiting for this guy.

1483
02:49:27,463 --> 02:49:29,533
This guy's something special.

1484
02:49:30,223 --> 02:49:31,781
My life for you.

1485
02:49:41,783 --> 02:49:45,981
Thank You, Lord,
for bringing us across the prairie...

1486
02:49:46,183 --> 02:49:49,334
and to this place
where the mountains begin.

1487
02:49:50,343 --> 02:49:54,097
Please take care of us
in the days and weeks to come...

1488
02:49:55,623 --> 02:49:59,411
and help us to love one another
and do your will...

1489
02:49:59,943 --> 02:50:03,219
however hard it may
sometimes seem to us.

1490
02:50:08,983 --> 02:50:11,338
Tom ! Tommy, come look!

1491
02:50:13,463 --> 02:50:16,819
-What is it, Gina?
-A parade. Come on up and look.

1492
02:50:20,943 --> 02:50:22,217
Gosh, it is!

1493
02:50:31,143 --> 02:50:33,577
M-O-O-N. That spells ''parade.''

1494
02:50:48,023 --> 02:50:50,173
Help us to be true, dear Lord.

1495
02:50:51,503 --> 02:50:53,812
Help us to stand.

1496
02:52:25,303 --> 02:52:26,292
English
