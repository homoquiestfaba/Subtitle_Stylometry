1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,093
(soft orchestral music)

2
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:23,524
(uptempo orchestral music)

3
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:31,468
(tense orchestral music)

4
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,573
- It's this way.

5
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,643
- Whoa.

6
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,323
It's down there, isn't it?

7
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,045
- Yep.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:58,045 --> 00:00:59,240
- [Pursuer] Here we go, over here.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,073
- We have to hurry.

10
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:01,173
- Let's get the ropes.

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,023
(tense music)

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,830
- Ready?

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,940
- You first.

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,938
- Scared?

15
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:14,938
- Huh.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,513
- Show off.

17
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:23,235
(tense orchestral music)

18
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,130
- They're close.

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,990
- This will slow 'em down.

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,403
Let's go.

21
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:39,809
(tense orchestral music)

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,430
Well, this is it.

23
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,900
But where?

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,633
- Should be somewhere on the cave wall.

25
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:52,220
(mysterious music)

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,395
I'll start over here.

27
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:58,252
- Okay, I'll take this side.

28
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,085
- Shane.

29
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:01,918
- Is that?

30
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:02,751
- I think.

31
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:06,638
- That's it.

32
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:08,359
That's it, you found it.

33
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,359
- We found it, together.

34
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:15,295
- Yeah!

35
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:17,705
Yeah.

36
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,170
- A fist bump? Really Ethan?

37
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,060
- Will they have the map now.

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,470
- That's the end of the story, though.

39
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,090
- Yeah.

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,877
- Well, I imagine some
sort of happy ending.

41
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,830
- But this is a happy ending.

42
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,510
They found the map.

43
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,010
And now onto the next book of my series

44
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,200
where they'll use it to find the artifact.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,050
- What about Shane and
Sabrina's relationship though?

46
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,550
The romance?

47
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,620
- Romance doesn't really fit in my books.

48
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,780
- I know Mister Action Adventure,

49
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,990
but that doesn't mean you
can't have some romance in it.

50
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,510
They should at least hug
and share a long look,

51
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,770
or maybe even a kiss.

52
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,020
- Seriously, Mackenzie, I
need your help on this, okay?

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,700
What did you think overall?

54
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,533
- I like it.

55
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,330
The villain seems a little over the top,

56
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,820
and I don't always get his motivation.

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,780
- Good.

58
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,770
What else?

59
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,840
- I like the chemistry
between Shane and Sabrina,

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,540
but I really do think
they have a relationship

61
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,883
that could be developed
into something more.

62
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,973
- Duly noted.

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,980
- You're not gonna do
anything about that, are you?

64
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,050
- No, but thank you for reading my latest.

65
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,890
You're the best.

66
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,723
- Happy to.

67
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,912
And my compensation?

68
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,440
(oven beeping)

69
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,343
- Just in time.

70
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,160
It's a good bake, I think.

71
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,883
- Heavenly.

72
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,550
- I've offered to teach
you how to make this

73
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,500
like 20 times by now, right?

74
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,300
- I say, why bother learning when?

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,500
- When you could be
dependent on me, I know.

76
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,120
- You're dependent on my
opinion of your books.

77
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,740
So it's more like job security.

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,000
- But you really like the book though?

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
- Yes.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,890
You doubt me every time.

81
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,120
- Well, rule number one of feedback

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,470
is you don't ask your friends.

83
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,960
- But you do because I'm
always honest with you,

84
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,760
even brutal at times.

85
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,400
- Well, now I just have to
brace myself for my editor.

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,130
- It'll be fine, it always is.

87
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,353
- So, anything cool going on at work?

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,900
- Nothing like adventures
through the jungle

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,520
to a hidden map, no.

90
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,840
- Come on, you have the ultimate dream job

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,700
working at a candy company.

92
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,570
- Chocolate.

93
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,403
- Even better.

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,560
- It doesn't necessarily
mean it's exciting.

95
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,634
- Well, whatever happened to
that new guy you talked about,

96
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,073
the floor manager.

97
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,040
- Nothing, he's just a new face.

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,570
- Well, maybe you should talk to him.

99
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,353
- I'm really not interested
in him, or an office romance.

100
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,480
- Why not?

101
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,773
You deserve to be happy.

102
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,363
- Pass me the jam.

103
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:41,048
- Yeah.

104
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,902
(bright orchestral music)

105
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,202
- Morning.

106
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:57,035
- Morning.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,470
- Just in time.

108
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,537
- Oh right, is she?

109
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:04,200
- I haven't seen her yet.

110
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,000
- Hurry up ladies or you'll be late.

111
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,470
Last quarter, sales were up in a big way.

112
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,523
Good job, everyone.

113
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,223
It is about time.

114
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,540
And now with that, I have good news.

115
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,000
A new customer wants our chocolates,

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,850
and not just any customer,
but Golden Gifts.

117
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,170
- Golden?

118
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,300
They have like 300 stores
across the country.

119
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,770
- Try 437 and expanding globally.

120
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,520
This is just what we need
to help with our expansion,

121
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,574
but we need to up production.

122
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,630
- We're already at capacity,

123
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,560
and hiring has been-

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,240
- Okay, well come up with a plan Marvin,

125
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,830
and we'll discuss it.

126
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,160
We need this deal, all of us.

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,770
Besides I'm more concerned
about our sourcing.

128
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,220
Mackenzie, we need more cacao,
and with increased volume,

129
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,560
we have to get better prices, too.

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,300
- Okay, how much more?

131
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,730
- Projections are at 40% more,

132
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,310
so go down and see our vendor in Colombia.

133
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,900
- Costa Rica.

134
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,723
- Yeah, there, go negotiate it.

135
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,653
- Great work.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,230
Scheduling the Golden
Gifts is gonna be fun.

137
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,298
I don't know where I'll fit it in.

138
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:20,040
- Ah, you'll find a way.

139
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,960
- Any way you can convince Evelyn

140
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,910
that I need to tag along to Costa Rica?

141
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,063
- I can try,

142
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,350
but since I've already been
several times without you,

143
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,910
I think she'll see through it.

144
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,287
- I need to get a better job here.

145
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:33,180
- It's not so bad.

146
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,090
- Says the one going
to exotic destinations.

147
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,430
- Yeah, it's hardly exotic when it's work.

148
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,450
- You just need to mix business

149
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,970
with a little bit of pleasure, right?

150
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,380
- Like that'll happen.

151
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,060
- It could, if you would just

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,130
give up on Ethan the clueless.

153
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,720
- He's not clueless.

154
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,943
I'm just very discreet about how I feel.

155
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,640
- I don't know what
you see in him, anyway.

156
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,320
- You hardly know him.

157
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,850
He's smart and creative,

158
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,190
and it's fun when we're together.

159
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,503
- Because sitting around
reading books is fun.

160
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,230
- To a lot of people, yes.

161
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,130
That's not all we do.

162
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,040
And besides he's always
there for me when it counts.

163
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,020
- Well, you need to
make it obvious to him.

164
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,580
Nothing will happen if you don't.

165
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,100
- No, no, he's too
valuable to me as a friend.

166
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,150
I don't wanna.

167
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,330
- Risk losing his
friendship, blah, blah, blah.

168
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,280
Do something then.

169
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,810
You two are in such a
routine he can't see you

170
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,520
as anything but a friend.

171
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,230
If you want anything to change,

172
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,090
you need to find a way to shake things up.

173
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,610
- Okay, fine, message received.

174
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,443
- Thank you.

175
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,100
- Ethan.

176
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,970
- Hey Larry.

177
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,990
- It's good to see you, man.

178
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,823
- You too.

179
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,418
- Thanks for meeting me here.

180
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,251
Starvin'.

181
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,084
- Ah no problem.

182
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:41,917
- You want a coffee?

183
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:43,620
- No, I'm good, thank you.

184
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,620
So, got the draft already, huh?

185
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,164
- Yeah.

186
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:49,530
- And?

187
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,363
- Look,

188
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,130
it's not my idea,

189
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,950
but the higher ups feel like your work

190
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,810
could use a new dimension.

191
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,040
- What, why?

192
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,750
- You know, to vary things up a bit,

193
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,050
bring in some new readers.

194
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,150
- I thought I had a steady
following, a growing following.

195
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,350
- You do.

196
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,170
It's just not growing
as fast as it needs to.

197
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,573
Your fans, they love the
Blake Coffield series.

198
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,090
But with this one being a new series,

199
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,100
it's a chance for you
to expand your reach.

200
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,753
You know, add something more.

201
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,693
- Okay.

202
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,493
Like what?

203
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,110
- A love interest.

204
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,050
Just a little bit of romance
between Shane and Sabrina?

205
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,803
Yeah, Sabrina.

206
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,253
- Are you messing with me?

207
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:35,760
- No man.

208
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,580
And look, it's totally not
my call, but corporate.

209
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,500
- There's no way they've
even read the draft yet.

210
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm surprised you got
through it this quick.

211
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,090
- Yeah, but they know your formula.

212
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,750
Sorry, not your formula, but
your style, your signature.

213
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,280
And they love it.

214
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,950
But some romance could
boost your potential.

215
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,400
- Well, isn't corporate
worried that romance

216
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,920
is going to chase away
my faithful readers?

217
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,450
- Not if it's done right.

218
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,090
Guys, they don't mind if
the hero gets the girl,

219
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,400
and the sales stats show
that a lot of female readers

220
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,260
are buying this in ebook format.

221
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,370
This will play to them more

222
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,470
while you solidify that readership.

223
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,903
- How am I supposed to
suddenly shift to this?

224
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,800
I mean, that's practically
a whole new genre for me.

225
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,150
- Look, don't stress.

226
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,240
Just weave it in with all
the action and adventure.

227
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,083
It'll be fine.

228
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:26,070
- Yeah.

229
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,510
I'm not a romance writer.

230
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,490
How can they expect this of me?

231
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,710
- Come on, you can do it.

232
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,910
You're a talented writer.

233
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,170
They obviously think so too,

234
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,810
or they wouldn't have
asked you to do this.

235
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,270
And they just want you to weave
in some relationship stuff.

236
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,100
You won't become the next Jane Austin.

237
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,240
- Yeah, but if I was so talented,

238
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,430
they would've just gone with what I wrote.

239
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,080
Thank you.

240
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,150
- Just maybe think of it like a challenge.

241
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,920
You might even like it.

242
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,160
- But romance is the polar
opposite of adventure.

243
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,180
I mean, even trying to get in

244
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,434
that head space right now, how?

245
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:56,267
- It should be easy.

246
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,570
I mean, you don't even have to make it up

247
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,310
like the action stuff.

248
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,283
You can draw inspiration
from your relationships.

249
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,370
- Nothing inspiring there.

250
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,403
- What about what's her name? Kara.

251
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,440
- No.

252
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,273
- Lillian?

253
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:12,750
- Definitely not Lillian.

254
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,490
- Okay, what about the
one with the purple hair?

255
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,323
I always forget her name.

256
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,156
- Cassidy? No.

257
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,880
Here's the thing, those
are all simple dates

258
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,130
and they didn't work out.

259
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,510
So they're hardly romantic examples

260
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,893
for me to follow in a book.

261
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:24,986
- I see your point.

262
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,423
Well, maybe you just need to
find the right woman for you.

263
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,990
- No, what I need is to find

264
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,840
the right romantic
inspiration for this book.

265
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,160
- Right.

266
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,870
That's what I meant.

267
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,427
- But where to find that?

268
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,603
- Well, maybe you need to go
somewhere for inspiration.

269
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,240
Let an exotic destination
spark that imagination.

270
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,190
I'm going to Costa Rica again for work.

271
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,330
You could tag along.

272
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,290
It'll shake things up creatively.

273
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,940
- Yeah?

274
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,310
I mean, that's not a bad idea, actually.

275
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,023
My book is set in a jungle
type place and Costa Rica.

276
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,620
Okay.

277
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,583
When do we leave?

278
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:20,405
(upbeat orchestral music)

279
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,863
Wow.

280
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,570
- Okay, so you should be up here.

281
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,160
Yeah, you're right there.

282
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,154
- Okay.
- And then I'm right here.

283
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:36,987
- Great.

284
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,123
(light orchestral music)

285
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,780
- Oh, hello.

286
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,380
Do you always come to this hotel?

287
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,791
- Not every time, but
it's one of my favorites.

288
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,550
There are a couple
others too, if it's full.

289
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,020
- I gotcha.

290
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,580
How's the food here?

291
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,600
- Pretty good.

292
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,160
- Do you wanna go grab a bite to eat?

293
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,993
- Sure.

294
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,990
- So I've been looking up some things

295
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,580
we can do here in Costa Rica.

296
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,720
- Okay, like what?

297
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,953
- So there's zip lining.

298
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
There's this cool volcano too.

299
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,090
- There's five, actually.

300
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,923
- What?

301
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:33,040
- Yeah, five active volcanoes, I think.

302
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
- Okay, well we gotta do all those,

303
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,410
and then there are these
cool hanging bridges.

304
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,660
There's a jungle four by four tour.

305
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,493
A cave excursion.

306
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,310
- Okay okay, wait, did you
forget why you're here?

307
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,330
- No.

308
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,190
- Romance, not adventure,

309
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,180
which is kind of the point
of everything just listed.

310
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,770
- Yeah, but these sound really fun.

311
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,360
- Okay, well then enjoy them.

312
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,610
But I don't think
they're really gonna help

313
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,100
with the romantic angles for your book.

314
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,933
And don't forget,

315
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,860
I do have to actually
work while we're here.

316
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,860
- Okay, well what do you recommend then?

317
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,183
- For romance?

318
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:09,210
I don't know.

319
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,010
Some people find chocolate romantic.

320
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,120
So maybe check out the,
cacao vendor I have to visit.

321
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,963
- Yeah, maybe.

322
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,420
But what do you normally
do when you come here?

323
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,730
- Work, eat, sleep.

324
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,563
Repeat.

325
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:25,960
- Come on, that can't be all.

326
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,860
- I did do this animal tour at night.

327
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,363
- That sounds like an adventure.

328
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:33,270
- It was, but I kept
nodding off the entire time.

329
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,020
It was focused on finding
nocturnal animals, like jaguars.

330
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,623
I woke up and saw these glowing
eyes just staring at me.

331
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,450
- Are you serious?

332
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,220
- Yeah, it was 20 yards away in a tree,

333
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,933
but it woke me up quick.

334
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,610
You could maybe try asking the concierge

335
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,953
about some romantic type activities.

336
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,200
- I could do that.

337
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,550
I might have to be a little
careful how I phrase it.

338
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,800
- Okay, all right.

339
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,660
Here's another idea.

340
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,930
Do some of the exciting
stuff in your book,

341
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,420
but just stop and kind of think through

342
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,330
how to weave in some
romance along the way.

343
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,303
- See now that, that sounds way more fun.

344
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,863
I don't have to do all of these
things alone though, right?

345
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,617
You can come with me on these?

346
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,090
- Oh yeah, no, I'll try,

347
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,070
but I do have to get up early for work.

348
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,350
- Okay, could I go with you tomorrow?

349
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,340
- Sure.

350
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,110
I'll leave the hotel at 8:15.

351
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,910
- Yeah, that sounds good, thanks.

352
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,743
- Of course, yeah.

353
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:31,830
- No seriously.

354
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,500
Thank you for letting me come along

355
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,750
and for even suggesting this.

356
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,060
And even if the romance is
a complete waste of time,

357
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,660
at least we got to go to
Costa Rica together, right?

358
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,240
- Yep.

359
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,013
We'll always have Costa Rica.

360
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,737
(bright orchestral music)

361
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,330
- This is different than I expected.

362
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,163
- How's that?

363
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,083
- I don't know.

364
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:15,540
- Were you expecting big
tractors and harvesters,

365
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,790
like for fields of wheat?

366
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:19,396
- Well, yeah.

367
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,353
- Hang on a sec.

368
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,337
- Hey, buenos dias.

369
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:24,170
- Buenos dias.

370
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,003
- Hey, you're early.

371
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:25,870
Can you gimme a few minutes though?

372
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,703
- Sure, yeah.

373
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:28,320
I'll show my friend
around, if that's okay?

374
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,153
- Si, si.

375
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,023
- Okay, hold on.

376
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:38,580
So all of these beans are cacao beans?

377
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,560
- No, that's actually
more like the whole fruit.

378
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,401
Beans are really the seeds inside.

379
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:47,401
Come here, I'll show you.

380
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,970
Here, hold that for a second.

381
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,890
So, you basically just score it,

382
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,680
cut it a little bit, and
then you can just break it.

383
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,820
- What?

384
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,410
Okay, that is definitely not chocolate.

385
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,697
- Well, not yet.

386
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:03,840
- Can I eat this?

387
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,949
- Yeah.

388
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:06,366
Go ahead, try it.

389
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:13,740
What do you think?

390
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,300
- Definitely not chocolate.

391
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,410
Have you tried this?

392
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,400
- Yeah, I've had it once.

393
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,960
- Once? Okay, hold on, hold on.

394
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,070
Come here. Come here.

395
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,940
- Nope, no.

396
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,773
- Come on.

397
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,606
- I'm good, I'm good.

398
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,470
- All right, so what do
you do with all these?

399
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,000
- Well, after the seeds are harvested,

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,410
they're fermented and dried

401
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,720
and then eventually
they're roasted in grounds.

402
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,770
- Okay, and that's when you can start

403
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,450
making it into chocolate?

404
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,550
- Something like that.

405
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,400
Well, I better go check
and see if Tomas is ready.

406
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,360
Wish me luck.

407
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,340
- Good luck, but you'll be great.

408
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,750
You're already in business mode.

409
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,710
You're in your element.

410
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,603
So, you know, go get him.

411
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,400
- Gee, thanks.

412
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,900
- Miss Mackenzie, are you ready?

413
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,733
- Yeah, coming.

414
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,010
There's a tour group
starting if you wanna join.

415
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,270
- Yeah, maybe I will.

416
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,860
- Just stay outta trouble.

417
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,153
- Trouble, me? Come on.

418
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,330
- Of course, I am excited to
provide more cacao for you,

419
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,340
but more product means more work.

420
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,960
I cannot help with the price.

421
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,540
- But we can commit to two
years at this quantity.

422
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,860
- I cannot get any lower.

423
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,470
In fact, the price and the cost may go up.

424
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,580
- Higher?

425
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,413
- I'm not sure yet,

426
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,730
but the pricing will
be definitely an issue.

427
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,080
- All right.

428
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,500
Let we talk to my team, but
please just think it over.

429
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,030
Maybe you can come up with a solution

430
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,271
so we're both satisfied.

431
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,650
- Okay.

432
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,420
- Perfect. (speaking in foreign language)

433
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,840
- And I get a chocolate
bar when I'm done, right?

434
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

435
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,283
Okay.

436
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,116
- Slacker.

437
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,690
- Okay. I will admit this is pretty fun,

438
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,775
but you kind of ruined the
magic for me just a little.

439
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,492
- You'll just appreciate it more now.

440
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:47,659
(car trying to start)

441
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,090
Everything okay?

442
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,063
- Yeah.

443
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,773
Maybe.

444
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,390
Okay, not really.

445
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,920
- Battery trouble?

446
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,753
- I don't know.

447
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,520
Rental cars, you know.

448
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,353
- Pop the hood.

449
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,370
- What do you think?

450
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,393
- Try the key again.

451
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:17,103
- Yeah, battery.

452
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,550
Well, the rental car companies are all

453
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,140
kind of a ways back in town.

454
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,353
It's probably gonna take a
while for them to get here.

455
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,850
- Just my luck.

456
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,130
- Well, let me see if Tomas

457
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,300
has something to jump the battery.

458
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,133
Just a sec.

459
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,390
- She seems to know what she's doing.

460
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,620
- Her dad's a mechanic.

461
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,720
- Oh, well it's nice of you both to help.

462
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,910
- I'm just standing here, that's all her.

463
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,980
- Well, either way, thanks.

464
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,410
Sorry to delay your vacation.

465
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,113
- No, it's not a vacation.

466
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:49,617
It's more of a work thing.

467
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:52,293
- Oh, I just assumed honeymoon.

468
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,810
- No, man.

469
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,690
We're not together, we're
just friends is all.

470
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,773
- Huh? Cool.

471
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,800
- Anything you could do.

472
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,633
- Okay.

473
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,340
- Well, I'd go straight
to the rental car company,

474
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,730
and see if you can swap
out the battery or the car.

475
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,770
- I will. Thank you.

476
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,750
- It's no trouble, Tomas had the cables.

477
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,733
- Still, you've been very kind.

478
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,460
Both of you.

479
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,140
- Let me take those back to Tomas.

480
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,973
- Oh, thank you.

481
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:23,920
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

482
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,950
- I'm Lucas.

483
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,000
- Mackenzie.

484
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,840
- Nice to meet you.

485
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,980
- Same.

486
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,378
Oh, sorry.

487
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,211
Ugh.

488
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,613
- Oh, you're fine, here one sec.

489
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:38,821
Here you go.

490
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:43,260
So can I take you to lunch as a thank you?

491
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,790
- Oh no, you don't have to do that.

492
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,560
Just drive safely.

493
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,160
The roads can be a little rough.

494
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,520
- Okay then.

495
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,080
Well, thanks again.

496
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,913
- Sure.

497
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,117
(light instrumental music)

498
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,790
Good?

499
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,442
- Uh huh.

500
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,390
It's a little bitter.

501
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,770
- You and you're sweet tooth.

502
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,780
- Oh, says the girl who
works at a candy company.

503
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,923
- Chocolate.

504
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,880
- I did find some inspiration
for my book, though.

505
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,530
- Yeah?

506
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,060
What, are you gonna
change one of the stops

507
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,580
in their adventure to be at a cacao farm?

508
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,840
- No, no.

509
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,450
I'm talking about the romantic angle.

510
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,230
Yeah, Lucas, definitely into you.

511
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,340
- No he wasn't.

512
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,170
- Yeah, he was.

513
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,540
- You're blind to romance.

514
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,910
- I can totally tell when
a guy's making a move.

515
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,170
- What, because you're a guy too,

516
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,150
and therefore it's like the same lingo?

517
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,593
- Yeah, pretty much.

518
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,490
And the fact that he seemed really happy

519
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,287
when I said we weren't dating.

520
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,170
- He asked?

521
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,003
- Kind of.

522
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,154
- That's forward of him.

523
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:51,987
- Okay, so you're gonna tell me

524
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:53,673
that you're not interested in him at all?

525
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,150
- A relationship should be
built on something other

526
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,013
than a moment of attraction.

527
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,760
- So you found him attractive?

528
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,840
- That's not what I said.

529
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,010
- Uh huh.

530
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,160
- Okay, new subject, please.

531
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,010
- Okay, fine, fine fine.

532
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,480
How'd your work meeting go.

533
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,010
- Hmm, not great.

534
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,260
They can provide me with an
increase in product we need,

535
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,200
but he's not budging on price.

536
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,033
I'm just gonna have to come up

537
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:18,810
with some better incentives for him.

538
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:22,560
- Could find another supplier.

539
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,460
- Yeah. Yeah.

540
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,060
I'll meet with a few other
options while we're here.

541
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,610
You hungry?

542
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,990
- I'm actually not.

543
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,670
Chocolate kind of filled me up
in a totally unbalanced way.

544
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,503
- Well, I'm starving,

545
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,400
so let's get something
to eat really quick.

546
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,700
And then I have to make a few
calls, but other than that,

547
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,550
you wanna pick something to do today?

548
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:46,260
- Yeah.

549
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,193
Yeah, definitely.

550
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,823
Oh, I actually have just the thing.

551
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,150
Remember when Shane and Sabrina go diving

552
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,980
to that underwater cave in the lake?

553
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,243
- [Mackenzie] Yeah.

554
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:58,740
- Well, I thought of a cool way

555
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,483
for them to travel to that spot.

556
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,760
Okay.

557
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,750
So maybe cool was a little
bit of an overstatement.

558
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,090
- It's interesting.

559
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,610
- It definitely wouldn't
work for my book though.

560
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,523
- Yeah, not for an action scene.

561
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:14,564
- Can you imagine?

562
00:22:14,564 --> 00:22:15,700
- Yeah, with the bad guys chasing them?

563
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,733
These are hardly getaway vehicles.

564
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,873
- Okay, well maybe it's
better for a romantic scene.

565
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,111
- I don't know.

566
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,127
I don't know if there's really
anything romantic about this,

567
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,912
and you can barely hold hands.

568
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,395
- We can try it.

569
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:31,443
Okay.

570
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,253
Well, we're getting our cardio in.

571
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,363
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

572
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,960
All right, seriously though.

573
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,610
Help me brainstorm.

574
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,943
If not the water bikes then what?

575
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,753
- I still like the diving scene.

576
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,917
How to add romance to it though?

577
00:22:56,212 --> 00:22:58,170
- You just can't exactly kiss underwater

578
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,651
with diving or snorkel gear.

579
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:04,530
- Well, but I mean romance
isn't just about the kiss.

580
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,103
It's about the spark between
them and the trust they build.

581
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,083
- Spark, trust.

582
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,620
- Oh, what if Shane's gear is sabotaged,

583
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,757
so Sabrina shares hers with him,

584
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:19,653
and that way he doesn't drown.

585
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,870
- And that's romantic?

586
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,060
- Once they reach the shore, yeah.

587
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,690
It can be.

588
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,010
What if it went like this?

589
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:31,885
(dramatic orchestral music)

590
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,180
Are you okay?

591
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,080
Your gear.

592
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,913
- Sabotaged.

593
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,890
I should never have
trusted the shopkeeper.

594
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,607
- I told you there was
something off about him.

595
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:45,544
- You should have left me.

596
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:46,961
- No, I couldn't.

597
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:49,933
I need you.

598
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:52,380
- No, you're strong enough alone.

599
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,480
- But I don't want to.

600
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:56,384
I don't wanna do anything without you.

601
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,940
- No, too much.

602
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,580
- Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

603
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,420
You write what you want.

604
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,420
But my point is romance can
come from less obvious moments,

605
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,473
even life and death adventure.

606
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,710
- All right.

607
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,790
- Can we go back now?

608
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,590
My legs are really burning.

609
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,050
- Yeah, fine.

610
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,550
(light orchestral music)

611
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,130
- Hey.

612
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,030
- Oh, good morning.

613
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,863
- How's the water.

614
00:24:30,863 --> 00:24:31,950
- It's good.

615
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,480
You should try it.

616
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,880
But I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say you have work.

617
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,920
- Yeah, I gotta check out
a couple more cacao farms.

618
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,701
- How long will that take?

619
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:42,194
- A few hours, you
wanna meet up for lunch?

620
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:44,220
- Yeah, that sounds good.

621
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,140
- All right, I'll send you the address.

622
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,820
Meet there around one o'clock?

623
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,870
- Perfect.

624
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,703
Good luck.

625
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,140
- Good?

626
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,460
- Amazing.

627
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,380
- High quality, the best of Costa Rica.

628
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,580
- Of course.

629
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,600
Mister Romano,

630
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,480
you have one of the largest
farms in the country.

631
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,950
Are you able to help us with our needs?

632
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,380
- Yes, but not yet.

633
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,270
- Well, when then?

634
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,310
- We are harvesting all weekend.

635
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,900
Maybe in time.

636
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,043
- How much time?

637
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,130
- Couple of years?

638
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,380
Or if one of our clients
change their needs,

639
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,630
I'll call you right away.

640
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,030
- But a plantation of this size,

641
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,683
surely you have enough supply?

642
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,199
- I am doing the best I can.

643
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,683
- Well, thank you for taking
the time to meet with me.

644
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,440
- I'm sorry I cannot help you.

645
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,430
- Okay, well thank you anyway.

646
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,280
- You're welcome.

647
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:49,550
(somber orchestral music)

648
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,373
- Ah, gracias.

649
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,970
Oh, Mackenzie.

650
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,993
- Lucas, hi.

651
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,210
I didn't expect to see you.

652
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,280
- Yeah, me either, but hey,
I'm really glad you're here.

653
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,327
Let me buy you that lunch I owe you.

654
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,160
- Oh, no.

655
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,203
- Excuse me?

656
00:26:21,203 --> 00:26:22,170
Can I get one more please?

657
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,580
Thank you.

658
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,720
No, I really am happy you're here.

659
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,291
I wanted to see you again.

660
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,476
- You did?

661
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:28,968
(worker speaking in foreign language)

662
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:30,568
- Gracias.

663
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:31,401
There you go.

664
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,167
Do you wanna sit with me?

665
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:38,167
- Yeah.

666
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:49,269
(muffled speaking)

667
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,890
- You know, sales and service
really isn't that exciting.

668
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,410
And I used to dread going
to those conventions,

669
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,080
like Las Vegas and
Florida, New York and LA,

670
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,380
but this year with Costa Rica, jackpot.

671
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,580
- Sounds exciting.

672
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,370
- Oh, you know how often do you come here?

673
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,720
- A few times a year.

674
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,869
- [Ethan] Hey, Hey.

675
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:08,702
- Ethan.

676
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:09,535
- There you are.

677
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,010
Luke, good to see you again.

678
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,000
- It's Lucas.

679
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,990
- What'd I say?

680
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,860
- Luke.

681
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,693
- Lucas, I'm sorry.

682
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:15,780
How's the car?

683
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,980
- All fixed.

684
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,420
- So just a minor headache then?

685
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,253
- Yeah.

686
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:20,820
Or a fortunate mistake that led me

687
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,293
to meet a beautiful stranger.

688
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:24,151
- Oh you?

689
00:27:25,388 --> 00:27:29,100
- Oh, Mackenzie tells me you're an author.

690
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,350
- Just a couple little
novels here and there.

691
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,720
- He's being modest, for once.

692
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,310
- Well, I'll have to
buy one of your books.

693
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,240
- Please do.

694
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,390
So, where are you from?

695
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,850
- California, bay area,
it's kind of ideal for work.

696
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,080
- So are we, Orange County.

697
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,263
- Yeah, Mackenzie was just
telling me that, it's so close.

698
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,423
- It's a seven hour drive.

699
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,063
- Hardly an inconvenience.

700
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,560
- Well, I have a lot
of work to do actually.

701
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,369
So I should probably
get back to the hotel.

702
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,980
- Oh, all work, huh?

703
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,020
I hope you find time to enjoy it here.

704
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,920
- I do.

705
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,810
- Well, hey, maybe we can
run into each other again.

706
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,793
Say, for dinner?

707
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,670
- Sure, I guess.

708
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,852
Yeah.

709
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:13,230
- Actually we were thinking
of going zip lining.

710
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,430
I hear it's fantastic.

711
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,693
A real thrill.

712
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,077
- Oh, I've I've never been before.

713
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,760
- You should come along.

714
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,110
I was thinking of tomorrow.

715
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,900
- Sure.

716
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,520
- Till tomorrow then.

717
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,353
- Okay.

718
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,743
- Later.

719
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,360
- Is it just me or did you just

720
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,400
set us up on a date back there?

721
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,590
- What? No, he asked you out already.

722
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,480
- Yeah, I guess, but.

723
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,500
- You just seemed a little
unsure of the whole dinner thing.

724
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,780
So I thought that something
with all three of us together

725
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,940
might make you more comfortable.

726
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,940
Was that that wrong?

727
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,530
- No thanks.
- Okay.

728
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,480
I just figured you're not seeing anyone,

729
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,180
so maybe you were interested,
but if you don't like him,

730
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,950
seriously, just tell him.

731
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,960
- Well, that's little
easier said than done,

732
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,140
but he does seem nice.

733
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,640
I just didn't come on this trip

734
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,350
to date someone I barely know.

735
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,780
- Well, the first rule of writing

736
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,467
is let the unexpected happen.

737
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,470
- Yeah, but my life?
- Yeah.

738
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,338
- Isn't your book.

739
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,874
(both chuckling)

740
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,010
- Okay, all right.

741
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,330
However,

742
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,330
if you do see me taking notes
over your budding romance,

743
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,890
it's just creative research.

744
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,300
- Great.

745
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,790
- I'll try not to be a third wheel.

746
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,460
- You know, romance wouldn't
be so difficult to write

747
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,360
if you weren't so.

748
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:38,640
- So what?

749
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,110
- Emotionally stunted.

750
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,370
- Ooh.

751
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,330
Yeah, that's fair.

752
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,900
- On the one hand
Ethan's being thoughtful,

753
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,733
but on the other.

754
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,840
- He's making things harder.

755
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,190
- Too bad you won't say,

756
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,230
I can't let myself show
interest in this other guy,

757
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,270
because I'm in love with you.

758
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,120
- Yeah, definitely not something I'd say.

759
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,180
- However, maybe give
this Lucas guy a chance.

760
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,013
Is he cute?

761
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,270
- He's handsome, yeah.

762
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,920
- Huh, perfect.

763
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,140
- But it would involve
me moving on from Ethan.

764
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,890
- And you know, I fully support
that, or make him jealous.

765
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,600
- Of Lucas?
- Yeah.

766
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,540
- He can't be jealous when
he feels nothing for me.

767
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,427
- [Crystal] Good point.

768
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:21,000
- And I wouldn't wanna use
Lucas or anyone like that.

769
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
- Stop being a saint.

770
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,930
- I'll deal with it all later.

771
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,690
Anyway, I really need some
leeway with the vendor here.

772
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,970
Is there any way you could
work some magic with Evelyn,

773
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,050
so I have more to offer.

774
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,140
- I can put a message in
front of her, how's that?

775
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,280
- Crystal?

776
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,130
- [Crystal] I hate to say
not my department, but.

777
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,690
- Fine.

778
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,100
- He's not budging?

779
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,030
- No, not yet.

780
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,560
And I've checked with
some of his competition.

781
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,720
They don't seem to be any help either.

782
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,298
- There are other countries
we can import from.

783
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:49,140
- Yeah, yeah.

784
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,550
But that's the last resort.

785
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,110
I mean for the timeline that Evelyn wants,

786
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,030
starting over with a new
vendor in a new country

787
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,430
is like a whole bunch of work, delays,

788
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,843
and governmental red tape.

789
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,600
Yeah, I'll just send her an email

790
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,723
and hope she's in a good
mood when she reads it.

791
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,589
(dramatic orchestral music)

792
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,980
- You first?

793
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,057
- Lucas, why don't you go first?

794
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:13,130
- No, no.
- Come on man.

795
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,330
- No, no, no, you go ahead.

796
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,650
- All right, I'll go first.

797
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,853
Okay, here we go.

798
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,643
How great is this?

799
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,763
Kenzie, how do I look?

800
00:31:25,498 --> 00:31:27,112
- You look like the guy from your book,

801
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:28,050
the one with the rock climbing.

802
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,890
- Caleb Highmoor?

803
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,600
Ooh, awesome.

804
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,783
All right, here we go. (hooting)

805
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:40,709
(uptempo orchestral music)

806
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,710
- He's quite confident.

807
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,633
- Oh, he loves this type of stuff.

808
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,780
- [Ethan] You guys are gonna love it.

809
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,310
- Okay, who's next?

810
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,830
- You go, I'll be go last.

811
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,991
- You sure?

812
00:31:56,991 --> 00:32:01,483
- Yeah, mm-hm.

813
00:32:01,483 --> 00:32:03,783
- Lucas, you kind of look a little pale.

814
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,583
- No, do I?

815
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:08,490
Huh?

816
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,990
- You want some water, maybe?

817
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,983
- No, no.

818
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:15,060
I think it might come back up.

819
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,730
We are really high up here, aren't we?

820
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,508
- Do heights bother you?

821
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:21,647
- Not that much.

822
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:23,673
- You don't have to do this.

823
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,020
- I'm right behind you.

824
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,933
- Okay, for sure.

825
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,280
- [Ethan] Hey, what's the hold up?

826
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,570
- Lucas, you know what?

827
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,670
Why don't you go next?

828
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,370
Okay.

829
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,280
Look, how about we both
just climb back down then?

830
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,113
- Just

831
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,423
one minute.

832
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,910
- Hey, it'll be okay.

833
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,740
Look, see Ethan's already over there.

834
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,213
- Come on.

835
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,980
- Don't worry about
rushing, we'll go slow.

836
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,000
I think you should do one of two things.

837
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,460
There's no pressure,
it's totally up to you.

838
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,350
One, is we climb back down,

839
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,243
go have a soda and laugh this off,

840
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,940
or two, I can hang on here
while our very experienced guide

841
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,760
makes sure you're all set up on that line.

842
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,220
Ethan will wave and holler something

843
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,980
idiotic and encouraging,

844
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,720
and I'll cheer you on while you go across.

845
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,767
And then 15 seconds later,

846
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:26,167
you land, you can cheer
me on while I go across.

847
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,650
What do you think?

848
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,598
- Second one.

849
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:35,431
- Okay.

850
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:39,785
- Ready?

851
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,905
- Maybe, I look ridiculous.

852
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,155
- You got this.

853
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:47,938
- One,

854
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:49,907
two,

855
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,311
three.

856
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:54,793
- [Mackenzie] Go Lucas!

857
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:57,626
(Lucas screaming)

858
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:08,878
- You did it.

859
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:10,680
It's your first time, yeah?

860
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,513
All right.

861
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,710
- Ready?

862
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,310
- For Kenzie.

863
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,393
- Okay, then.

864
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,272
(Mackenzie hooting)

865
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:24,939
(uptempo orchestral music)

866
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:29,784
- Yeah.

867
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:31,531
Great job.

868
00:34:33,013 --> 00:34:33,846
- You did it.

869
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:34,955
- Oh, thank you.

870
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:35,917
Thank you.

871
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:38,100
- [Mackenzie] It's all you.

872
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,083
- Actually one sounded really good.

873
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,170
- All right.

874
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,520
You ready for the next one?

875
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:46,851
- What? What?

876
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,130
- I'm proud of you.

877
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,963
- Really?

878
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:56,551
I made a complete fool of myself.

879
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:57,838
- You were nervous.

880
00:34:57,838 --> 00:34:59,070
There's nothing wrong with that.

881
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,140
- Look I'm sorry you had to have your fun

882
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,940
weighed down by some scaredy-

883
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,260
- Nah, listen, I had a great time.

884
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,155
We both did, right Ethan?

885
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:06,990
- Huh?

886
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,823
Yeah.

887
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:08,675
- See?

888
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:10,200
- You know, I am glad I tried that,

889
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,793
but maybe next time we can
do something on solid ground.

890
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,760
Assuming there is the next time.

891
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,290
- Fair enough.

892
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,750
- All right, well I will see you later.

893
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,670
Mackenzie. Nathan.

894
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,503
- Bye.

895
00:35:24,503 --> 00:35:25,336
- Later.

896
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,600
That was cruel.

897
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,340
- I didn't know he was afraid of heights,

898
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,840
he didn't say anything.

899
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,950
Besides, he can't complain.

900
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,200
He got a nice big ole hug
up there on the platform.

901
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,033
- Oh, no, no, no.

902
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:40,368
That was me comforting a terrified soul.

903
00:35:40,368 --> 00:35:42,393
- Maybe, maybe a little bit more.

904
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:44,151
- You think what you want.

905
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:45,210
- I always do.

906
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,370
- Now, for my book,

907
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,680
I think I'm gonna make
Sabrina scared of heights.

908
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,513
- Why?

909
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:51,900
- So that Shane can rescue her.

910
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,733
- That's so silly.

911
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,850
I mean why does she have to be rescued

912
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,650
when he's the one that has the problem?

913
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,960
- Because my character
isn't afraid of heights.

914
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,670
Besides, I wrote it so
that she rescues him

915
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,780
during the whole diving bit.

916
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,033
So, it's her turn.

917
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:05,943
- All right, fine.

918
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,920
(phone ringing)

919
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,300
Hi, Evelyn.

920
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,500
- I got your email.

921
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,830
- Yeah, not the best news yet.

922
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,570
Seems like everyone here
is kind of maxed out

923
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,010
with their current commitments,

924
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,080
and I've been looking at numbers
for other countries, but-

925
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,910
- No, that's gonna kill our timeline.

926
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,110
- Exactly.

927
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,690
- This deal is important,
and if we can't deliver,

928
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,740
we lose Golden.

929
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,340
Golden Gifts is keeping us,
ensuring we stay in business.

930
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,020
And I would hate for us to lose this deal

931
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,690
over a little supply and demand blip.

932
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,250
- I'm still working on it.

933
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,420
I'll find a solution.

934
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,663
- Good, because jobs are
on the line with this deal.

935
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,770
- Are you saying my job is at stake?

936
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,850
- Don't be silly.

937
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,760
25% of the company's
jobs would be at stake,

938
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,380
so keep me up to date.

939
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,883
- Oh, okay okay, bye.

940
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,375
- Hey, how was your run?

941
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,410
- I'm still worked up about Evelyn's call.

942
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,879
- Think that's how they work?

943
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:09,930
- I mean, I didn't think so,

944
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,820
but I'm in the spending money division,

945
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,070
not balancing the company checkbook.

946
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,440
- Well, maybe she's just bluffing.

947
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,580
- I doubt it.

948
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,980
- Do you want a distraction?

949
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:20,907
- Like what?

950
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,840
- Like sharing your female
perspective on something.

951
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,890
- Your book?
- Yeah.

952
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,183
- Shoot.

953
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,070
- What do you like in a guy?

954
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,750
Like take Lucas for example.

955
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,390
- Well, you realize I
barely know him, right?

956
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,440
- Yeah.

957
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,270
I mean you're not in love
with him and that's fine.

958
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,173
But just imagine,

959
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,320
based on the time you
spent with him so far,

960
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,550
what stands out?

961
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,753
The good stuff please.

962
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,633
- His vulnerability?

963
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,200
- Women really are different than men.

964
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,490
- You want my answer or not?

965
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,480
- Yeah yeah, no no, I'm sorry.

966
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,733
Yes, please you can continue.

967
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,020
- He was trying to hide
his fear, you know,

968
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,960
because he was embarrassed,
but when it came to it,

969
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,780
he didn't shy away from letting me help.

970
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,613
- Huh.

971
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:09,441
Okay.

972
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:12,150
- I mean, instead of being
all like, oh, it was nothing.

973
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,923
I'm all tough, so strong.

974
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,680
He was honest.

975
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,560
He wasn't afraid to admit he was scared

976
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,803
and not too proud to accept some comfort.

977
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,010
- All right.

978
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,030
Next question.

979
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,620
- Yes?

980
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,080
- What would make you
fall in love with the guy?

981
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,913
- Oh, come on.

982
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,090
How can I answer that?

983
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,100
- Come on, you've been
in love before, right?

984
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,420
I just need this whole process

985
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,170
from a perspective that isn't mine.

986
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,563
- I don't know.

987
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,063
What would make me fall in love?

988
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,703
Making me laugh.

989
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,003
Thinking that he values
me, like what I think,

990
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,530
knowing that he cares for me,

991
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,180
like he wants what's best for me.

992
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,570
And seeing that he wants to protect me.

993
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,896
- Protect, like a fight
to defend your honor?

994
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:04,860
- No, no,

995
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,500
I'm pretty sure that doesn't
actually happen in real life.

996
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,400
I mean, at least not as much

997
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,170
as books and movies make it seem.

998
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,240
- Okay, well then what did you mean?

999
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,300
- Just wanting me to be safe.

1000
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,563
- Okay, yeah.

1001
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,370
All right, this has
actually been super helpful.

1002
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,070
Thank you Kenzie, I appreciate it.

1003
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,930
- You off to your writing cave?

1004
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,133
- Yeah, I think so,

1005
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,740
at least for a little bit.

1006
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,833
Probably just order in
tonight, to be honest.

1007
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,500
You gonna be okay on your own?

1008
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,210
- I'm pretty sure I can handle it.

1009
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,340
- Okay, well thank you.

1010
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,283
Again, I appreciate it,
I'll see you around.

1011
00:39:41,497 --> 00:39:45,164
(light instrumental music)

1012
00:39:56,749 --> 00:39:57,832
Good morning.

1013
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,180
- I thought you'd sleep in.

1014
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,460
- Maybe to work without my wit? Come on.

1015
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,710
- Have something healthy.

1016
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,960
- So, what is on the agenda for today?

1017
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,450
- Checking out another cacao farm.

1018
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,410
- How long will that take?

1019
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,000
- Hopefully not too long,

1020
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,670
but Tomas is supposed to
send over a proposal later,

1021
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,440
so I'll need to review that too.

1022
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,761
- All right, I'll probably
just chill here today.

1023
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:28,230
(phone ringing)

1024
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,063
- Lucas.

1025
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,340
Hello?

1026
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,570
- [Lucas] Hey, good morning, Mackenzie.

1027
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,130
I hope I'm not calling too early.

1028
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,920
- Hey, no, I'm already up and working.

1029
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,600
- [Lucas] Oh yeah, me too.

1030
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,930
Have a pretty full schedule
this morning at the convention.

1031
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,270
I have to be on the floor mingle,

1032
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,970
but I can break away this afternoon,

1033
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,190
assuming you're not sick of a scaredy cat.

1034
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,140
I thought I should see if
I can get a better view

1035
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,153
of the volcanoes while I'm here.

1036
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,793
Would you like to come?

1037
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,870
- Well, I actually have
a lot of work to do,

1038
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,724
and I also have to check in
with the office back home.

1039
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:06,912
- [Lucas] Oh.

1040
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:10,533
- But I think Ethan and
I can make that work.

1041
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,320
- [Lucas] Ethan?

1042
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,370
- Yeah, is that okay?

1043
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,250
He'll just be bored otherwise, so.

1044
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,810
- [Lucas] Oh yeah, okay.

1045
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,880
How about two o'clock?

1046
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,113
- Let's do three?

1047
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,993
- [Lucas] Yeah, great.

1048
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:25,290
I'll see you then.

1049
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,520
- Okay, thanks.

1050
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,353
Bye.

1051
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,540
- Can you see this? Some
guy off to the side.

1052
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,540
I am pretty sure that that
is what you just made me

1053
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,103
on this excursion with Lucas.

1054
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,450
- Okay, but I didn't wanna
make him feel bad by saying no,

1055
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,640
especially after how
embarrassed hair he was.

1056
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,473
- It's fine, I will come with.

1057
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,360
- Thanks.

1058
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,920
- You're welcome.

1059
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,160
But if any of this makes it into my book.

1060
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,243
- I've been warned.

1061
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,138
(soft music)

1062
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,487
- Hey, how much farther is it?

1063
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:05,070
- About 15 minutes till
we get to the bridge.

1064
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,540
- Okay, cool.

1065
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,760
- You should see him on road trips.

1066
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,710
- Are we there yet?

1067
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,571
- The worst.

1068
00:42:12,843 --> 00:42:14,880
- Hey, thanks again for coming with me.

1069
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,360
- Oh yeah, it's good for
me to see something new.

1070
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,860
I've never been here before,

1071
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,450
even with all my trips to Costa Rica.

1072
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,918
- Wow.

1073
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:24,353
- Well, I'm glad we're doing this then.

1074
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,100
Hey, I know Ethan said that
you two are just friends,

1075
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,233
but I wanted to check.

1076
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:33,873
So are you?

1077
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,990
- Yeah. Yeah.

1078
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,520
We are just friends.

1079
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,859
It's all we've ever been, yeah.

1080
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:40,692
- Cool.

1081
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,570
Sorry, that's just me being in my head.

1082
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,760
- That's okay, I know what that's like.

1083
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:49,051
- [Lucas] Oh yeah.

1084
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:53,442
Neat, huh?

1085
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:55,110
- [Mackenzie] Yeah.

1086
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,387
- Wait, so this height doesn't bother you?

1087
00:42:57,387 --> 00:43:00,360
- No, the bridge is strong
and I get to stay on my feet.

1088
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,120
Even if we are a couple
hundred feet in the air.

1089
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,250
- It's a pretty amazing view, too.

1090
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,393
- Sure is.

1091
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,023
- Hey, let me get one of you.

1092
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,830
- Yeah.

1093
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:17,700
Big cheesy smile?

1094
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,930
- [Mackenzie] Normal one please.

1095
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,763
- You're no fun.

1096
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,640
- Great.

1097
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,826
Hey, let's get one together, too.

1098
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:26,659
- Okay.

1099
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,160
- Ethan, you mind?

1100
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,720
- Yeah, no problem.

1101
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,717
- Wait one sec.

1102
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,859
All right, yeah.

1103
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:39,692
- You all good?

1104
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:40,525
- Yeah.

1105
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,693
Oh, one sec.

1106
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:48,211
Yeah, great.

1107
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:49,044
- Okay.

1108
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:53,040
- Got it?

1109
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,570
- Yeah.

1110
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,130
- Awesome.

1111
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,590
This is so much better
than working all day.

1112
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,463
- Absolutely.

1113
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,310
Do you like your work?

1114
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,690
- Yeah, sure.

1115
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,740
It's getting kind of bland,

1116
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,390
but thank goodness for these trips

1117
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,640
or I would've changed careers by now.

1118
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,730
- Are you the buyer or the
seller at the conventions?

1119
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,880
- Mostly the buyer, look for
products that can help us.

1120
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,840
Some might be worth partnering
with, some worth acquiring.

1121
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,880
- Can I sneak past you real quick?

1122
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,200
- It's pretty boring, right?

1123
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,030
- I'm here to talk to a supplier.

1124
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,630
That's not very exciting either.

1125
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:29,310
- Yeah, well we make it
exciting then, don't we?

1126
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,720
- We try.

1127
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,403
Zip lines, volcanoes.

1128
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,313
- Dinner?

1129
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,340
How about it? Just the two of us.

1130
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,393
- I can't tonight.

1131
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,600
- Well, tomorrow then.

1132
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,783
- Sure, yeah, that works.

1133
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
- Lucas, when do we get to see the lava?

1134
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,360
- Lava?

1135
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,970
- Yeah man, orange liquid fire, lava?

1136
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,260
- Oh Ethan, I don't think

1137
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,160
there's any lava flow to be seen here.

1138
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,200
- You said these were active volcanoes.

1139
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,701
- Well, active and erupting
are two different things.

1140
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:06,534
- What?

1141
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:09,938
(soft music)

1142
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:14,785
Romance.

1143
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:18,177
Romance.

1144
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:25,310
Okay.

1145
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,770
This is it, the volcano.

1146
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,240
- Well, how can you be sure?

1147
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,770
There are more than one here.

1148
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,590
- The river, but we don't have much time.

1149
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,910
- No one knows we're here, do they?

1150
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,474
- No, it's not that.

1151
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:42,783
(rumbling)

1152
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,640
It's the volcano.

1153
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,383
- Shane, we can't outrun lava.

1154
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,697
- No, that doesn't work.

1155
00:45:53,891 --> 00:45:56,443
No, not that either.

1156
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,600
We'll be fine,

1157
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,900
as long as we're together.

1158
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,833
- Shane?

1159
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,483
- Kenzie?

1160
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:17,783
- Whoa.

1161
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:23,444
(pensive instrumental music)

1162
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,423
Whoa.

1163
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:37,838
(knocking on door)

1164
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,540
- Hi.
- Hey.

1165
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,693
Look, I'm pretty tired
between the hike and work.

1166
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,740
- Do you have a spoon?

1167
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,450
Hey Kenzie?
- Mm-hm.

1168
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,850
- I'm still really annoyed
about the lava thing.

1169
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,670
I'm serious.

1170
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,263
- You had unrealistic expectations.

1171
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:07,710
- I did not, I had high expectations.

1172
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,063
There's such a difference.

1173
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:13,364
Could I ask you something?

1174
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:14,197
- Uh oh.

1175
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,880
- Do you wanna stop seeing Lucas?

1176
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:19,240
- Why do you ask?

1177
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,050
- Just because, I mean,
you invited me along today.

1178
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,520
So if you don't feel comfortable,
then that says something.

1179
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,270
I mean, I can tell him if you want.

1180
00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:33,390
- No, it's okay.

1181
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,143
- No, as in you'll tell him?

1182
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,790
- He asked me to dinner again.

1183
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,783
Just the two of us.

1184
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,290
I said, yes.

1185
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,123
- Okay.

1186
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:49,650
Whatever you want.

1187
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,980
- Well, I don't, I
mean, he's nice and all,

1188
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,830
but I don't know.

1189
00:47:56,061 --> 00:47:57,330
- Yeah.

1190
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,913
Maybe something will come of it.

1191
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,593
- Maybe.

1192
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:04,983
- I mean, you want that right, with him?

1193
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,533
- We'll see.

1194
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,500
- Our quality of cacao is better

1195
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,330
than what you'll find somewhere else.

1196
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,250
I mean, you do gourmet chocolate.

1197
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,086
You can't do that with just any cacao.

1198
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:23,919
- No, I know.

1199
00:48:23,919 --> 00:48:25,260
But the proposal you sent,

1200
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,530
it's more than what I can
bring back to my boss.

1201
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,600
I looked up the numbers and
they don't even make sense.

1202
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,850
I mean, you're actually
charging more per kilo.

1203
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:36,840
- Yeah, like I said, to produce
more it just costs more.

1204
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,850
- Can you actually do it?

1205
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,040
Right now, if we agreed to this,

1206
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,240
could you make more?

1207
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,893
- Not for several months.

1208
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,520
- Tomas, do you have the plans to produce

1209
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,070
the quantity I'm talking about?

1210
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,113
- Like I said, several months.

1211
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,740
- Okay. Okay.

1212
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,090
I think I understand now.

1213
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,940
- Miss Mackenzie, I do want
to keep working with you,

1214
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,030
I just don't know how to give
you what you're asking for.

1215
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,863
- Yeah.

1216
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,980
Look, how else can I
get the quantity I need?

1217
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,750
Could you maybe recommend someone?

1218
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,370
- You mean like a competitor?

1219
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,290
- I don't have much choice.

1220
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,200
Mister Amano's farm seemed
to have pretty good quality.

1221
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,260
- No, that's the worst-run
farm in the country.

1222
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,700
Just stick with me.

1223
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,220
- I'm trying, but it's just not enough.

1224
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,990
- Well then it's not enough.

1225
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,240
It's better than nothing.

1226
00:49:28,214 --> 00:49:30,964
(phone ringing)

1227
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,180
- Hello?

1228
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,590
- I figured it out.

1229
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:35,610
- [Crystal] What, Ethan?

1230
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,440
- No, with Tomas.

1231
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,030
He doesn't know how we'll
get the yield we need

1232
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,200
out of his land.

1233
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,070
- How can he not?

1234
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,980
- Well, I've been talking
a pretty serious increase,

1235
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,540
and he is not the only one.

1236
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,580
All of his competitors
are saying the same thing.

1237
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,020
They're already at their max.

1238
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,726
- You sound like Marvin.

1239
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:53,700
- Well, at least now I know
what the real issue is.

1240
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,680
Just need to figure out a solution.

1241
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,150
- Any ideas so far?

1242
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:57,983
- Nope.

1243
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,260
- Back to Ethan, then.

1244
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,220
- No change.

1245
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,060
- Lucas, then.

1246
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,190
- Lucas is fine.

1247
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,423
- Fine or fine.

1248
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,690
- He's pleasant, how's that?

1249
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,840
- He could be more if you
weren't hung up on Ethan.

1250
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,840
- Lucas is handsome and
charming, but he knows it, and-

1251
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:19,918
- [Crystal] And?

1252
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,710
- I'm pretty sure he spends more time

1253
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,380
thinking about how he looks
than anyone else I know.

1254
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,120
- It pays off, right?

1255
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,620
- It doesn't matter anyway.

1256
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,293
It's all just confusing me, everything.

1257
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,200
I'm even regretting bringing Ethan along.

1258
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,520
- You shouldn't.

1259
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,500
This could be the trip
where you can finally

1260
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,390
wash your hands of your pining.

1261
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,710
Lucas sounds like the perfect guy

1262
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,690
to help you get over Ethan.

1263
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,400
Then again, the marketing response

1264
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,710
on those strawberry
chocolates is really good.

1265
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,450
It's seasonal, but it's worth a shot.

1266
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,100
- You're not fooling anyone.

1267
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,273
- It's work related.

1268
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,183
Kind of.

1269
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,653
- Tell Mackenzie to get
a move on, for your sake.

1270
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:58,953
- Will do.

1271
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,730
- [Mackenzie] What was that?

1272
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,900
- Evelyn.

1273
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,500
She said you should get
a move on for my sake.

1274
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,000
What is that supposed to mean?

1275
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,420
- Don't worry about it, she's just grumpy.

1276
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,690
Productive day?

1277
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,090
- No, actually.

1278
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,200
I need a break.

1279
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,060
Let's go do something together.

1280
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:24,960
- I don't know.

1281
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,430
My brain's kind of fried,

1282
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,280
and I have to be back in time for dinner.

1283
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,500
- Well, let's do something close by then.

1284
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,953
There's that cave thing, I
don't think that's too far away.

1285
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,590
- How about I pick something?

1286
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:39,360
- Okay.
- Really?

1287
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,660
- Yeah. whatever you want.

1288
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,229
I cannot believe that this
is what you wanted to do.

1289
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:55,170
- What's so bad about a sloth trail?

1290
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,963
Somewhere up in the trees, maybe.

1291
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:01,440
There, look aren't they cute?

1292
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,333
- Oh yeah.

1293
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:07,620
Yeah, do they have trails
with more energetic animals?

1294
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,380
- No, I purposely picked
the most boring animal

1295
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,213
just to annoy you.

1296
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:12,210
- Okay, great, great.

1297
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,210
- Yeah, we're gonna see
sleeping turtles next.

1298
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,370
- All right, so what's the
deal with these guys then?

1299
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:22,370
They just sleep long,
walk slow, happy lives.

1300
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,813
- I don't know that much about them,

1301
00:52:23,813 --> 00:52:26,310
other than there's a lot
of 'em in Costa Rica.

1302
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,840
- Why's that?

1303
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,673
- Probably the jungle,

1304
00:52:28,673 --> 00:52:30,650
'cause they live in tropical rainforest.

1305
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:32,843
Oh,

1306
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:36,333
guess how far they travel for a day?

1307
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:40,727
- Oh, 10 feet.

1308
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:42,990
- About 40 yards.

1309
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,530
- Wow, so much farther.

1310
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,363
- Give them some credit though.

1311
00:52:47,363 --> 00:52:49,980
They just sleep 15 to 20 hours a day.

1312
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,420
- Like me in college.

1313
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,920
- The first time I was in Costa Rica,

1314
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,510
actually I was driving,

1315
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:57,360
I came across this backup in
traffic, no one was moving.

1316
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,160
It was a really like rural area,

1317
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,260
so I didn't know what was going on.

1318
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,970
Got out of my car to take a look.

1319
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,713
It was a sloth, just crossing the road.

1320
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:06,810
- At 0.03 miles per hour?

1321
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:09,450
- Honestly, he looked frozen in time.

1322
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:13,323
Just stretched out like mid motion.

1323
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,560
And then a police officer
came, just picked him up,

1324
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,880
set him down on the other side.

1325
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,840
- So awesome.

1326
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,633
Could you do that pose one more time?

1327
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,273
What?

1328
00:53:27,565 --> 00:53:28,482
- Oh, look.

1329
00:53:30,245 --> 00:53:31,395
How's that for romance?

1330
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,321
- They're taking a nap.

1331
00:53:33,321 --> 00:53:34,443
That could be,

1332
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:36,690
that could be anything, that
could be mother and son.

1333
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,360
- That'd be a cute sloth couple, too.

1334
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,980
- Sloths aren't monogamous,

1335
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,230
and aren't much for true love.

1336
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,063
- Really?

1337
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,473
- Yeah, so says the
wisdom of the internet.

1338
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,890
See, that's just it for me.

1339
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,923
I keep getting hung up on
writing the romance and it just,

1340
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:56,615
I don't know, it feels fake.

1341
00:53:56,615 --> 00:53:58,530
- It's fiction, it's all fake.

1342
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,530
- Well don't misunderstand
me, I'm all for romance.

1343
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,363
- You are?

1344
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,640
- Yeah.

1345
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,110
Writing it.

1346
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,340
I'm coming around.

1347
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,173
It just,

1348
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,140
it's a little tricky and I'm
still trying to figure it out.

1349
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,503
- You just have to make
it relatable, to you.

1350
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:22,440
- How?

1351
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,450
I mean I've never done the grand gestures

1352
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,553
or the big romantic speeches.

1353
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:30,183
- Romance isn't about
the big flashy things.

1354
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,730
It's the every day that's important.

1355
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,580
- Okay, but the every
day is boring in a book.

1356
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,610
- You have a helicopter chase, diving,

1357
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,740
repelling off the waterfall.

1358
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,093
A little boring won't hurt.

1359
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,083
Besides, romance isn't boring.

1360
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,740
- Okay, but you just said nothing flashy.

1361
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,983
So what's going to feel romantic?

1362
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,970
- Little things, you know
that they do for each other,

1363
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,683
that show they care.

1364
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,370
- Somehow I get the
feeling you're gonna say

1365
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,623
that saving each other's
lives doesn't count.

1366
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,663
- Think smaller.

1367
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,830
- Being able to count on each other?

1368
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,150
- Yes, yes.

1369
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,603
Or the sacrifices they make, you know,

1370
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,143
because they love each other.

1371
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,880
- Love?

1372
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,410
- Why not?

1373
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:26,010
Real love, true love, comes first.

1374
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,743
In love catches up on its own timeline.

1375
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,003
- Yeah, no,

1376
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:34,763
that makes sense.

1377
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:35,596
Yeah.

1378
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:42,977
(soft instrumental music)

1379
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,440
- Take out, really?

1380
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,360
- Whoa, you look great.

1381
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,193
- Thanks.

1382
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:05,820
- Where'd you get that dress?

1383
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,020
- Gift shop.

1384
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,320
- Well, you're, it's very pretty.

1385
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,730
- Thank you.

1386
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,070
Actually, I have a ton of work
to do, but I'm kind of stuck,

1387
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,700
so I figured dinner and a
break might do me some good.

1388
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,470
- Okay, well, if you decide
you don't wanna go out.

1389
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,766
I mean, I've got plenty to.

1390
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:23,400
- I guess he's here.

1391
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,690
- Where are you guys going?

1392
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,235
- I don't know.

1393
00:56:26,235 --> 00:56:28,290
- Well, are you sure that's safe?

1394
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,910
I mean you barely know the guy.

1395
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,860
He could be like a criminal or something.

1396
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,878
- Now you bring that up?

1397
00:56:32,878 --> 00:56:34,378
- I'm just saying.

1398
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,920
Okay, have fun.

1399
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:42,043
(pensive music)

1400
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,460
- [Mackenzie] Hey.

1401
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,570
- Oh, hey, wow.

1402
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:51,030
You look beautiful.

1403
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,400
Perfect.

1404
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,734
- Thanks, you too.

1405
00:56:53,734 --> 00:56:54,630
- Oh, thank you.

1406
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:55,620
You ready?

1407
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,880
There's this restaurant
I keep hearing about

1408
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,170
from people at the convention.

1409
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,214
- Oh, sounds great.

1410
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:00,660
- Okay.

1411
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,915
Watch your step.

1412
00:57:01,915 --> 00:57:02,748
- Thanks.

1413
00:57:12,757 --> 00:57:14,523
So when's the convention over?

1414
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,630
- Yesterday, actually.

1415
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:19,800
- Really?

1416
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,950
- Yeah, I wanted to
stick around for a bit.

1417
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,807
- Well, when do you leave?

1418
00:57:26,474 --> 00:57:27,674
- I haven't decided yet.

1419
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,380
How about you?

1420
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,820
- Friday, for now.

1421
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,100
But the whole thing's really fluid

1422
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,870
with this deal I'm trying to make.

1423
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,770
- How so?

1424
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,470
- Well it's, it's delicate, but basically,

1425
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,020
I'm trying to figure out
if it's more cost efficient

1426
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,170
to start over buying from another country,

1427
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,050
or help the farm here figure
out how to produce more.

1428
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:52,020
- Well, here is at least
the problem you know.

1429
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,670
- Sure.

1430
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,320
- I got pressure from my bosses

1431
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,860
to find a better software for
predicting buying behaviors.

1432
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,930
It's complicated, I'll spare you,

1433
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,040
but we had one in-house.

1434
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:06,423
It had all these issues
and no one believed in it.

1435
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:10,560
So I spent two years on and
off vetting outside options.

1436
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,230
We narrowed in on, one acquired it,

1437
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,590
spent all this time forcing it to work,

1438
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,840
but in the end.

1439
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,490
- No better than what
you had the whole time?

1440
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:21,603
- Oh, worse.

1441
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,460
Sometimes the best solution
is the one you already have.

1442
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,600
- Yeah, except in my case, it's
not really the solution yet.

1443
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,063
- Well, try working
with them so it can be.

1444
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:37,140
And that's when I learned my lesson,

1445
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,270
me and cats, not friends.

1446
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,730
- You have the claw marks to remind you.

1447
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:42,563
- Yep.

1448
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,600
Hey, how about we dance?

1449
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,280
- No, no, I'm not a good dancer.

1450
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,113
- Oh, come on.

1451
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,663
I'll lead.

1452
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:07,293
So, what else do I need to know about you?

1453
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:13,320
- Well, we covered families, education,

1454
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,150
jobs, pets.

1455
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:15,983
- Okay then.

1456
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,883
Oh, most embarrassing moments.

1457
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:22,680
- Oh, no, no.

1458
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,090
- Come on.

1459
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:24,923
Okay, I'll go first.

1460
00:59:24,923 --> 00:59:25,770
- Yeah, feel free.

1461
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,750
- I was supposed to
receive this award at work,

1462
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,213
so I invited my family to the ceremony,

1463
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,390
and the head of the company calls my name.

1464
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:37,830
I go up on stage.

1465
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:42,830
They hand me the award and I
smile this big old open grin,

1466
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,230
and my face is projected
on these giant TV screens

1467
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,000
for everyone to see.

1468
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,800
And I literally singled out
and hear my parents gasp.

1469
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,450
- Why?

1470
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:57,033
- Broccoli, stuck in my teeth.

1471
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:01,560
I made the mistake of
eating an hors d'oeuvre

1472
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,153
before I went onstage.

1473
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,825
- I'm sure not that many
people even noticed.

1474
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:09,573
- Oh enough did, I didn't
hear the end of it.

1475
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,920
- That's your most embarrassing moment?

1476
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,820
- Yeah.

1477
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,413
Come on, it's horrifying.

1478
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,270
You wouldn't understand,

1479
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:21,250
but we have this thing in my family where

1480
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:26,193
we're so proud of who
we are and how we look.

1481
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,593
It was awful.

1482
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,133
Anyways, your turn.

1483
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,630
- Okay.

1484
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,820
Well, before my job now,

1485
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,260
I was interviewing around.

1486
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,720
There's this job I really wanted

1487
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,853
at this really reputable marketing firm.

1488
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,440
So I go in for an interview
with three of their team,

1489
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,543
and I totally think I'm doing really well.

1490
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:56,090
And then as I leave, I hear laughter.

1491
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,960
- Oh why, what happened?

1492
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,610
- I'd gone to the restroom before,

1493
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:04,503
and I guess I missed that the
end of my skirt got caught.

1494
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,603
- Oh no.

1495
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,600
- Yeah, so when I went to
leave, that's what they saw.

1496
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,433
- Wow.

1497
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,570
Okay, yeah.

1498
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,160
You know what, that's embarrassing.

1499
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,993
- Yeah.

1500
01:01:17,993 --> 01:01:18,826
Yeah, it was.

1501
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,690
Ethan came over later that day

1502
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,940
and brought over food and some comedies,

1503
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,070
and we just watched and laughed

1504
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:30,903
until the sting of it all passed.

1505
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,350
- You've been friends for long?

1506
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,183
- Yeah.

1507
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,110
- How'd you two meet?

1508
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:39,930
- Well, we started out as neighbors

1509
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,883
in this really crummy apartment.

1510
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,240
I just finished college and he was a cook

1511
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,360
at this really
hole-in-the-wall restaurant,

1512
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,210
not really believing
he could be an author.

1513
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,160
- Well, he obviously overcame that.

1514
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:53,993
- Yeah.

1515
01:01:53,993 --> 01:01:56,520
Yeah, and we stayed friends

1516
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,430
even with all the little
fan groups of his,

1517
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,953
and moving to different
places across town.

1518
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,770
- That's nice.

1519
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:08,340
It's so easy to fall out of touch.

1520
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,420
- Yeah.

1521
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,910
I always kind of figured it
was just a matter of time

1522
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,530
before we both got too busy

1523
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,200
and just kind of forgot about each other,

1524
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,973
but he proved me wrong.

1525
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,057
Tomas then Ramano.

1526
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,823
How can I make that work?

1527
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:37,710
- You mentioned Ramano's
farm, but it's run poorly.

1528
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,703
- Yeah, guy's not focused,
getting old, to ill.

1529
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,310
- Well, I spoke with him this morning.

1530
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:47,280
He said he needs the money from the farm.

1531
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,470
Can't really do the work anymore.

1532
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:50,850
- So?

1533
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,010
- Well how's the cacao there?

1534
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:55,680
- It's good, not as good as mine.

1535
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,513
- Could it be?

1536
01:02:57,842 --> 01:02:59,250
- I don't understand.

1537
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,620
- Ramano wants out of the
business, don't you think?

1538
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,000
- Yeah.

1539
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,890
- What if he was bought out.

1540
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,450
- By who?

1541
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,283
- You.

1542
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:10,470
- I don't have that kind of money.

1543
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,600
- Well, what if we helped?

1544
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,623
- How exactly?

1545
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,583
- We make the sale possible
in exchange for better terms.

1546
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,220
Consider it an advance.

1547
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,530
You could run the farm
the way it should be.

1548
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,710
And with that you have much
more cacao to sell to us.

1549
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,510
- And you could do that?

1550
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,710
- I think so.

1551
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:29,543
Could you?

1552
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:36,090
So, I already sent the terms to my boss,

1553
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,370
and there was no screaming.

1554
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,440
- That's great, progress.

1555
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,750
- Yeah, so Tomas is approaching Ramano,

1556
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,870
and then assuming Ramano
doesn't get greedy,

1557
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:49,110
we could have everything in
place in the next few weeks.

1558
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,670
- That's great, I'm so proud of you.

1559
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:51,503
- Thank you.

1560
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:54,990
Honestly, I'm just relieved
not to have Crystal

1561
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,760
and everyone's jobs on the line.

1562
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,440
- Well, you shouldn't
have in the first place.

1563
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,120
That was all Evelyn.

1564
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,523
- Well, it's nearly all
finished now, anyway.

1565
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,463
All in all, not a bad trip.

1566
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,890
- We should celebrate.

1567
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:08,740
- That's an idea.

1568
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,490
- Hey Mackenzie.

1569
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:12,480
- Oh Lucas.

1570
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,950
- Hey, what do you two doing here?

1571
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,280
- We were just getting lunch
and talking about celebrating.

1572
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,800
- Mackenzie figured out a solution.

1573
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,540
- Yeah, actually what
you were saying before,

1574
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,190
about the solution you already have

1575
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,590
and investing more into that.

1576
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:30,310
It got me thinking and yeah,
it's nearly all settled.

1577
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:32,490
- Oh my gosh, I'm so happy for you.

1578
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,780
That's amazing.

1579
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,180
So how are we celebrating?

1580
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,340
- We haven't figured out yet.

1581
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,540
- Oh.

1582
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,860
Well, you know what?

1583
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,840
I have a great idea,

1584
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,090
but we would have to
get our swimsuits first.

1585
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:51,150
(bright orchestral music)

1586
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,973
Come on, you guys are gonna love this.

1587
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:56,366
- You all right?

1588
01:04:56,366 --> 01:04:57,199
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1589
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:02,220
- Did you not wanna come,
'cause I just figured you would.

1590
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,810
- Yeah, we're celebrating.

1591
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:04,933
All three of us.

1592
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:07,823
- You'll be fine.

1593
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:09,690
You sure you're okay.

1594
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:10,523
- Peachy.

1595
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,630
- So, what do you think?

1596
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,950
- How's the water so?

1597
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,300
- Beautiful?

1598
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,370
Legend has it that after
God painted the sky,

1599
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:22,800
this is where he cleaned his paintbrush.

1600
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,450
- Come on.

1601
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,160
- Well, I mean, in all reality,

1602
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,110
it's probably minerals or whatever,

1603
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,130
but isn't it awesome?

1604
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:30,123
- It's amazing.

1605
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,380
- If you like this, you're
gonna love the next spot.

1606
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,924
Come on.

1607
01:05:35,924 --> 01:05:39,424
(light orchestral music)

1608
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,600
- [Mackenzie] Wow.

1609
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,680
- [Ethan] Okay, I admit,
that is impressive.

1610
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,863
- Okay, come on, let's
head all the way down.

1611
01:06:00,866 --> 01:06:02,396
(camera snapping)

1612
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:04,440
You should write this
into one of your books.

1613
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,490
- Yeah, maybe I will.

1614
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:08,910
- How is your book coming by the way?

1615
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:10,860
Mackenzie said it's a work in progress.

1616
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:15,450
- I'm revising a few things,
but it's nearly done.

1617
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:16,283
- Nice.

1618
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,566
You okay?

1619
01:06:18,566 --> 01:06:20,649
- I think I saw a monkey.

1620
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,200
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

1621
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,033
- Yeah, sure.

1622
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,800
- Do you think I have
a shot with Mackenzie

1623
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,973
after Costa Rica?

1624
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,940
I'm supposed to go home this weekend.

1625
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,250
I've already extended my trip as it is.

1626
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,743
The boss wants me in office on Monday but,

1627
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:41,060
I don't wanna let her go.

1628
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:42,840
- Oh.

1629
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,120
- I know the long distance thing.

1630
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,623
It's not ideal but,

1631
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:50,010
nothing a quick flight can't solve, right?

1632
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,860
- Well, I mean, are you sure
she's interested enough?

1633
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:53,910
- Well, that's why I'm asking you.

1634
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:56,973
Did she say anything about me?

1635
01:06:58,530 --> 01:06:59,363
- No.

1636
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,543
- Oh, she's gotta feel something right?

1637
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:06,605
- I don't.

1638
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:09,262
So are we gonna go swimming in that?

1639
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:11,850
'Cause I have to admit
that water looks amazing.

1640
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,620
- Oh no, no, no.

1641
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:16,440
We're not allowed to swim here.

1642
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,060
- Then why did we bring our swimsuits?

1643
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,803
- Oh, that's for the next spot.

1644
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,630
What do you think?

1645
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,663
- It's already totally worth it.

1646
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,300
Ethan, how great, right?

1647
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,154
You wanted to come to the hot springs?

1648
01:07:35,154 --> 01:07:36,180
- Yeah.

1649
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,623
Yeah, this is really great.

1650
01:07:37,623 --> 01:07:39,073
- Well hey, let's try it out.

1651
01:07:41,216 --> 01:07:43,883
(playful music)

1652
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,999
- Just right.

1653
01:07:52,999 --> 01:07:54,990
Ethan, come on.

1654
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:57,273
- Yeah, careful, don't slip.

1655
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,450
- I swear, I can't even
so much as look it a worm

1656
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,340
without my heart like
going into overdrive.

1657
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,960
- Oh, I'm pretty sure I'd
be scarred for life too.

1658
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,793
- Yeah.

1659
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:17,700
- [Mackenzie] Crazy to think
this is all heated by nature.

1660
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:21,240
- Yeah, all the magma, but no lava.

1661
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,073
Sorry Ethan.

1662
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,093
- Hey, is that a worm
by your shoulder, there?

1663
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:29,123
- Just a stick.

1664
01:08:29,123 --> 01:08:29,956
- Oh, sorry.

1665
01:08:29,956 --> 01:08:30,993
I thought it moved.

1666
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,990
- Ethan loves to tease.

1667
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:36,096
- I'm the same way with my sister.

1668
01:08:36,096 --> 01:08:37,380
- I didn't know you have one.

1669
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,372
- I thought I brought it up
on our date the other night.

1670
01:08:40,372 --> 01:08:41,823
- I guess too busy dancing.

1671
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:45,030
- Well, I think there's
another hot spring.

1672
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:47,730
I'm just gonna go take a quick look.

1673
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:48,563
Can I go?

1674
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:49,396
- Yeah, sure.

1675
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:51,683
- Why not?

1676
01:08:51,683 --> 01:08:55,170
- No, you stay here until
I find a better one,

1677
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,843
because it's not like
I need your help, so.

1678
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,294
- Maybe they have a couple's
massage service here.

1679
01:09:01,294 --> 01:09:02,127
- Really?

1680
01:09:02,127 --> 01:09:04,500
- A lot of hot springs
have the method spas.

1681
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,104
- Okay.

1682
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,793
- I'll see if I can book
this one, Mackenzie.

1683
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,438
- Lucas?

1684
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:11,349
- My ankle.

1685
01:09:11,349 --> 01:09:12,182
- Ethan.

1686
01:09:13,297 --> 01:09:14,186
- Are you okay?

1687
01:09:14,186 --> 01:09:15,112
- I just hit it when I fell.

1688
01:09:15,112 --> 01:09:16,837
- Let me help you, come here.

1689
01:09:16,837 --> 01:09:17,670
- I'll help.

1690
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:19,220
- You've already helped enough.

1691
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,643
What was that?

1692
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,980
Lucas has been nothing but
nice, and you were mean.

1693
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:32,913
- I was not.

1694
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,460
He just gets on my nerves
after a while, okay?

1695
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,140
I'm sorry I don't have your patience.

1696
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,432
- So you thought it was fine
to just push him in the wall.

1697
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:43,582
- I didn't push him in.

1698
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:46,180
I barely touched him.

1699
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:49,020
- First the zip line, now this.

1700
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,490
- Hey, he invited himself along.

1701
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,323
- He was just being nice.

1702
01:09:51,323 --> 01:09:53,250
- Are you sure that's all?

1703
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,090
I'll tell you right now, Kenzie,

1704
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:55,560
if you wanted to come on this trip alone

1705
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,660
so you could fall in love
with some random guy,

1706
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,980
you didn't have to bring me along.

1707
01:09:58,980 --> 01:09:59,880
- That's not fair.

1708
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,500
I was trying to help you with your book.

1709
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,373
- Well don't.

1710
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,550
Okay, I'll throw in some

1711
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:07,770
stupid little sappy love struck line,

1712
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,020
and Larry and the publisher will be happy,

1713
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,610
and that'll be that.

1714
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:13,440
Romance is overrated anyway.

1715
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,820
- Well, you obviously don't need it

1716
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,890
in your book or your life, so fine.

1717
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:18,090
Whatever you say, Ethan.

1718
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:31,383
- Kenzie, you there?

1719
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:34,343
- Yeah?

1720
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,223
- I'm sorry.

1721
01:10:40,223 --> 01:10:42,013
(soft music)

1722
01:10:42,013 --> 01:10:43,293
I was being stupid,

1723
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,703
and it wasn't fair to you or to Lucas.

1724
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,010
- Why were you acting like that?

1725
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:52,863
- I don't know.

1726
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:56,820
I think I was frustrated with the book,

1727
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,433
and I should have been more patient.

1728
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:04,050
- Well, it's a good thing
we're going home soon.

1729
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:06,390
Maybe this trip wasn't such a good idea.

1730
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:07,223
- No, it was.

1731
01:11:10,006 --> 01:11:12,056
It was, you've always been encouraging me

1732
01:11:13,796 --> 01:11:16,096
and this trip was you
being really thoughtful,

1733
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,083
and I made a mess of it.

1734
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,473
- Well, thanks for saying that.

1735
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,250
You really should
apologize to Lucas, though.

1736
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,083
- Yeah.

1737
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:28,943
- Just saying.

1738
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:30,923
- I know.

1739
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:33,983
We'll see.

1740
01:11:37,718 --> 01:11:38,728
- Hey Ethan.

1741
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,250
- Hey, thank you.

1742
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,210
Do you need help?

1743
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,373
- I'm good, thanks.

1744
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,357
Well, your ankle, it's not?

1745
01:11:51,357 --> 01:11:52,380
- No, it's fine.

1746
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,213
Just a bit sore today.

1747
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,863
- Okay.

1748
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,300
Thank you for meeting me.

1749
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,243
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

1750
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,750
I was totally outta line and I really,

1751
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,670
I didn't mean for you to get hurt.

1752
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,440
- I know, it's okay.

1753
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,273
- It is?

1754
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,853
- You were just having fun, right?

1755
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,920
Some celebration though.

1756
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,140
I'm pretty sure Mackenzie
was more upset than I was.

1757
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,793
- You're telling me.

1758
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:27,240
- I'm glad we have this
chance to talk though.

1759
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,470
- Why is that?

1760
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:31,623
- I've been thinking about
what to do about Mackenzie.

1761
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:35,100
I don't wanna squander
under my chance with her,

1762
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,990
so I was thinking about

1763
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:39,600
doing something special before I leave.

1764
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,770
- Why?

1765
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:43,080
I mean to what end?

1766
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,750
- Oh, to show her how serious I am,

1767
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,730
to set the stage,

1768
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,340
to make her just as happy to see me,

1769
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,393
when we all go home.

1770
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,100
The whole long distance
relationship scares me,

1771
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,720
and I don't want her
to forget about me, but

1772
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,793
I'm committed.

1773
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:06,390
- Sorry, I don't really know what to say.

1774
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:09,033
- Well, what do you think, good idea?

1775
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,223
- I don't know.

1776
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,080
- Of course, you don't
know what I'm planning.

1777
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,730
Sorry, so what I was thinking was

1778
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,340
I was gonna take her down
to the lake by the volcano,

1779
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,320
and they have this boat
there that I can charter,

1780
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,270
and we would just go along the lake,

1781
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,590
see all this wildlife,

1782
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:31,620
but wait till the sunset
and then have this

1783
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,383
nice romantic dinner
just out on the water.

1784
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,906
Cool, huh?

1785
01:13:36,906 --> 01:13:37,740
- Yeah, man.

1786
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,613
Yeah, sure.

1787
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,633
- Well, do you think she would go for it?

1788
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,383
- I can't speak for her,

1789
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:50,063
but,

1790
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,793
but it sounds like something
that any woman would love.

1791
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:09,120
Aren't you a little
overdressed for the pool?

1792
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,930
- Getting some sun sorta, too much to do.

1793
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:14,340
- Is everything okay?

1794
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,173
- Yeah, yeah.

1795
01:14:15,173 --> 01:14:18,210
Just going over all the agreements,

1796
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,610
making sure the deal points work.

1797
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:21,443
How's Lucas?

1798
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:23,243
- He's fine.

1799
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,210
Yeah, it's all good.

1800
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,313
- Thanks for doing that.

1801
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:30,989
- It's the right thing to do.

1802
01:14:32,243 --> 01:14:34,022
- You wanna sit down?

1803
01:14:34,022 --> 01:14:35,192
- Yeah, sure.

1804
01:14:35,192 --> 01:14:36,025
Sure.

1805
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,653
- [Mackenzie] So how's the book coming?

1806
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:41,453
- It's good.

1807
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:45,450
It's good, I was rethinking
some of the romance.

1808
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:46,283
- Do tell.

1809
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:49,860
- Well, I'm not exactly sure when yet,

1810
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,380
but at one of the near death moments.

1811
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,880
- That doesn't narrow it down.

1812
01:14:59,451 --> 01:15:02,070
- I thought that he would say,

1813
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:04,620
there's no one he'd rather be with,

1814
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,420
because he thinks that it's the end.

1815
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,343
And then he would say sorry,

1816
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,043
for getting her into this.

1817
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,283
And then he would take her hand,

1818
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:24,030
and they would just hang on to each other.

1819
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:31,773
And even though they were in
danger, it wouldn't matter,

1820
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,173
because they had each other,
and he'd always have her.

1821
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:39,563
But he just

1822
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:43,053
never told her how.

1823
01:15:49,284 --> 01:15:52,350
He

1824
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,790
had never told her how

1825
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:58,890
critical she was

1826
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:03,280
in their adventures, with her research and

1827
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,613
yeah.

1828
01:16:11,146 --> 01:16:12,210
- Yeah.

1829
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:13,410
Well,

1830
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:17,030
I guess it depends on what
else you've written to

1831
01:16:18,627 --> 01:16:22,533
get to this point and their feelings.

1832
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,740
- That's a good point.

1833
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:30,000
So I think I'm gonna go write that down,

1834
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,640
and see if I can make it work,

1835
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,090
and I will, well, I'll see you soon.

1836
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,351
I'll see you later, I'll see you in a bit.

1837
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:39,507
- Yeah.

1838
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:40,970
- Yeah, okay.

1839
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:44,137
(introspective music)

1840
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:01,411
- Why can't I tell her?

1841
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,080
- I can't keep doing this.

1842
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,270
Every time I think maybe
he feels something more,

1843
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:11,190
he proves me wrong.

1844
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:14,460
I'm just, I'm tired of kidding myself.

1845
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,103
- You have waited and been
his friend for so long.

1846
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:19,923
I'd say time's up.

1847
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,040
- See, I could live with
just being friends, but

1848
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,790
sometimes I think there's hope.

1849
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,990
That's what makes it so hard,

1850
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:32,490
like these little signs that
just fizzle into nothing.

1851
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:36,060
- Well, the way I see it,
you have three options.

1852
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,673
One, cut him off completely.

1853
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,540
Two, find out how he feels,

1854
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:45,030
even if it changes your friendship.

1855
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:47,130
Or three, stay in limbo.

1856
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:49,260
- Yeah, I don't like any of those.

1857
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,090
- Well, there's always option four.

1858
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:52,380
- Four?

1859
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,463
- Move on with Lucas.

1860
01:17:57,043 --> 01:17:59,460
(soft music)

1861
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,510
- All finished.
- Great.

1862
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:07,860
I'm glad we got this to work.

1863
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:09,420
- I'll take good care of Ramano's farm.

1864
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,470
- Your farm.

1865
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:11,313
- Si, que.

1866
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,170
- It was a pleasure.

1867
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:14,849
- You too, (foreign phrase) gracias.

1868
01:18:14,849 --> 01:18:16,266
- Gracias, ciao.

1869
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,270
Hey, I was gonna call you,

1870
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:28,980
but then I thought I heard you come back.

1871
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,810
- Yeah, but I'm on my way out again.

1872
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:31,643
- Where are you going?

1873
01:18:31,643 --> 01:18:34,710
- Lucas texted and wanted
I do something at the lake.

1874
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,360
I'll see you later then?

1875
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,193
- Yep.

1876
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:38,963
Yeah.

1877
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:53,673
Don't go.

1878
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:57,833
You and Lucas don't belong together.

1879
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:58,883
Anything, you literally could have said

1880
01:18:58,883 --> 01:19:01,267
anything to stop her.

1881
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:05,883
I gotta stop her.

1882
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:13,378
(medium tempo instrumental music)

1883
01:19:16,989 --> 01:19:18,502
Mackenzie!

1884
01:19:18,502 --> 01:19:21,085
(bright music)

1885
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:26,726
Mackenzie?

1886
01:19:31,139 --> 01:19:33,889
My phone, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1887
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:37,923
Hey wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1888
01:19:37,923 --> 01:19:39,930
wait please, I gotta get to the lake.

1889
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:41,460
Are you going to lake,
are you going that way?

1890
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,186
Can I come with, it's very important,

1891
01:19:43,186 --> 01:19:44,507
(foreign phrase) please?

1892
01:19:44,507 --> 01:19:45,340
- Si, si.

1893
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:46,460
- Thank you, thank you.

1894
01:19:47,736 --> 01:19:49,319
Gracias, thank you.

1895
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,453
Whoa, whoa.

1896
01:19:57,453 --> 01:19:58,286
What, what?

1897
01:19:58,286 --> 01:20:00,584
Why are we stopping? Why are we stopping?

1898
01:20:00,584 --> 01:20:03,030
(speaking in foreign language)

1899
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,100
The lake, I have to get to the lake.

1900
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,372
(speaking in foreign language)

1901
01:20:07,372 --> 01:20:09,312
This way? This way?

1902
01:20:09,312 --> 01:20:11,552
Okay, okay, bien, thank you.

1903
01:20:11,552 --> 01:20:15,302
(dramatic orchestral music)

1904
01:20:24,943 --> 01:20:25,776
Whoa.

1905
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:49,125
Mackenzie!

1906
01:21:05,351 --> 01:21:09,101
(dramatic orchestral music)

1907
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:13,403
Mackenzie?

1908
01:21:19,255 --> 01:21:21,840
(indistinct)

1909
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,673
Mackenzie?

1910
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:27,528
(dramatic orchestral music)

1911
01:21:30,269 --> 01:21:31,769
Wait, wait, Lucas.

1912
01:21:33,551 --> 01:21:34,823
Mackenzie.

1913
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:35,656
Come on!

1914
01:21:42,407 --> 01:21:43,240
- Ethan?

1915
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:48,143
- What is he doing?

1916
01:21:48,143 --> 01:21:49,143
- Mackenzie,

1917
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:53,370
I finished the story.

1918
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,920
- Can you turn around the boat?

1919
01:22:01,396 --> 01:22:02,229
Ethan?

1920
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:09,093
Whoa, whoa, whoa, steady.

1921
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:12,473
- [Mackenzie] What's wrong?

1922
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:15,517
What are you doing here?

1923
01:22:15,517 --> 01:22:16,858
- I made it.

1924
01:22:16,858 --> 01:22:17,691
I made it.

1925
01:22:17,691 --> 01:22:19,218
- Are you okay?

1926
01:22:19,218 --> 01:22:20,223
- I'm sorry.

1927
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,920
Do have any like water?

1928
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,753
- Yeah.

1929
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:34,870
- Oh,

1930
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:35,849
thank you man.

1931
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:36,682
- Ethan?

1932
01:22:39,957 --> 01:22:41,473
- I'm sorry, Lucas.

1933
01:22:41,473 --> 01:22:43,003
I can't let her go with you.

1934
01:22:43,003 --> 01:22:43,836
- [Mackenzie] Ethan?

1935
01:22:43,836 --> 01:22:45,930
- Not until she knows how I feel.

1936
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:46,763
- What?

1937
01:22:48,102 --> 01:22:49,680
- I've been so scared
about how to tell you

1938
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,010
that I've been trying to figure
out how to say it properly,

1939
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:56,160
and I just, I can't wait another minute.

1940
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,503
Mackenzie, I love you.

1941
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:01,163
- Ethan.

1942
01:23:01,163 --> 01:23:01,996
- Nope, no, no, no, no.

1943
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:04,653
Don't Ethan me, just please, just listen.

1944
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:07,560
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean for this to happen.

1945
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,390
And especially for being such a jerk

1946
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:10,863
where you're concerned Lucas,

1947
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,520
but this woman is my best friend,

1948
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,320
and I cannot let her go thinking

1949
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,120
that that's all there is between us,

1950
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,373
because I want more.

1951
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,500
Please don't go off into
the sunset with Lucas.

1952
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,333
No offense.

1953
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,183
- She's not.

1954
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,033
- What?

1955
01:23:32,033 --> 01:23:33,540
- Mackenzie was very kindly telling me

1956
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:37,140
that she doesn't think things
between us will go anywhere.

1957
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,730
- Really?

1958
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:40,117
Why?

1959
01:23:40,117 --> 01:23:41,190
- Because.

1960
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:42,640
- Because she loves you, too.

1961
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:45,360
- I do.

1962
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,330
I have for a long time.

1963
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:50,190
- Why didn't you say anything?

1964
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:52,773
- I didn't know if you'd
ever feel the same way.

1965
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,020
- Hey, do you mind taking us back?

1966
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:58,853
Thanks.

1967
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:03,845
- I finished my book.

1968
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:04,797
- You did? (chuckling)

1969
01:24:04,797 --> 01:24:06,147
- Yeah.

1970
01:24:06,147 --> 01:24:07,597
Can I read the ending to you?

1971
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:13,723
Well, this is it.

1972
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:16,110
But where?

1973
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:17,693
- Should be somewhere on the cave wall.

1974
01:24:21,664 --> 01:24:22,568
We'll start over here.

1975
01:24:22,568 --> 01:24:23,968
- Okay, I'll take this side.

1976
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:29,090
Miss Sabrina, I want
you to know something.

1977
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:31,410
- What?

1978
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:32,730
- Even if we don't find the map,

1979
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,980
I wouldn't change one
moment of this journey.

1980
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,133
- Me neither.

1981
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:41,247
- Hey,

1982
01:24:41,247 --> 01:24:42,303
I'm serious.

1983
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,730
There's no one else that I
would rather be with right now.

1984
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:48,953
- Me neither.

1985
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:51,720
- I never told you.

1986
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,020
All these years I never told
you what you mean to me,

1987
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,310
but if we're gonna get out of this thing,

1988
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:59,460
with or without the map
or wherever it leads to,

1989
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,750
dead or alive,

1990
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:01,773
you have to know,

1991
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,493
you are everything to me.

1992
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,940
And I know I didn't always see that,

1993
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:11,283
but somehow deep down, I always knew,

1994
01:25:12,976 --> 01:25:14,884
that you've been the one

1995
01:25:14,884 --> 01:25:17,280
that never doubted that
I could do something.

1996
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,100
Now, I don't know what I did
to deserve you in my life,

1997
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,930
but I will spend the rest of it,

1998
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:23,670
doing everything that I can to make sure

1999
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:25,623
that you and I are always together.

2000
01:25:30,662 --> 01:25:33,133
- You really mean that, don't you?

2001
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:33,966
- I love you.

2002
01:25:37,484 --> 01:25:41,234
(romantic orchestral music)

2003
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,450
- They haven't even found
the treasure map yet.

2004
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:48,300
- Oh no, they do, that's on the next page,

2005
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,273
but it doesn't even matter because,

2006
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,570
because he found what he really needed.

2007
01:25:58,172 --> 01:25:59,432
Come here.

2008
01:25:59,432 --> 01:26:03,182
(romantic orchestral music)

2009
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:19,800
- It's good.

2010
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,733
- Just good, huh?

2011
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,250
- Corporate is gonna love it.

2012
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,440
It feels so alive, now.

2013
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,400
- I'm glad.

2014
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,100
- Your fan base is about to explode.

2015
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,200
I told you adding romance
would work, you did it.

2016
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,240
- Thank you, thank you.

2017
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,010
- So we can get a series
out of this, right?

2018
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:37,650
I'm thinking six, seven books?

2019
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:38,820
- Whoa.

2020
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:42,123
Actually, I've already
started writing a sequel.

2021
01:26:45,412 --> 01:26:47,995
(tense music)

2022
01:26:52,001 --> 01:26:57,001
Come on.

2023
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,140
- Just another adventure, you said.

2024
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:02,370
- Well.
- Simple.

2025
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:04,410
- [Ethan] I may have
underestimated the situation.

2026
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:05,490
- [Mackenzie] Once again.

2027
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:08,220
- Come on, you wouldn't
miss this for the world.

2028
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:10,043
- You're lucky I love you.

2029
01:27:10,043 --> 01:27:11,043
- I sure am.

2030
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:16,859
Let's go.

2031
01:27:16,859 --> 01:27:20,526
(romantic orchestral music)

2032
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:34,730
(light orchestral music)
