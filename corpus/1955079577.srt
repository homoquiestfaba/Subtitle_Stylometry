00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,096
<i>[Man Narrating]
We're looking into a classroom.</i>

2
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,888
<i>You know it's a classroom
because your eyes tell you.</i>

3
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,181
<i>Think for a moment
how many things you know...</i>

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,646
<i>just because your eyes tell you.</i>

5
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,063
<i>You know what the weather is like
when you look outside.</i>

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,439
<i>You know that Tommy Walker
wore his plaid shirt today.</i>

7
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,108
<i>You can read your lessons
and learn things...</i>

8
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,406
<i>because you can see.</i>

9
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:12,282
<i>You know your teacher better
because you can see her.</i>

10
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,411
<i>Watch, now.
Use your eyes...</i>

11
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,039
<i>and you'll learn how you can take
good care of your eyes.</i>

12
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,383
About five years ago,
I was running a lathe...

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,003
and had safety glasses on,
and as I was running the lathe...

14
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,927
a piece of hot steel chipped off...

15
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,802
bounced off of my cheek,
off the glass, and went into my eye.

16
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,645
So, um, in about a day or two,
I couldn't really see.

17
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,232
My eye was really hurting bad.
I couldn't even do paperwork in my office.

18
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,647
The fluorescent light in my office
would hurt my eye.

19
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,146
I had to wear sunglasses
while I was doing paperwork.

20
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,990
So eventually I went to the doctor.

21
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,403
When I got there, I told him,
"My eye's killing me. I can't really see out of it."

22
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,497
So he put some liquid cocaine
eyedrops in...

23
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,584
which immediately just - relief.

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,294
I could see everything/ I thought it was
over with. I was ready to leave.

25
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,210
And the doctor said, "No, no, no,"
so he brought me into the office...

26
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,754
and when I went into the office,
he took a swab...

27
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,344
put a chemical on it,
and rubbed it into my eye.

28
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,386
After he did that, he turned out the lights
and put on an ultraviolet light.

29
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,726
He looked in, and everything
was glowing in my eye.

30
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,187
He said he could see
a big ole' sliver of steel...

31
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,478
that was right on the edge
of the blue part right next to the pupil...

32
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,679
and he said if it'd been over
just a fraction more...

33
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,854
it would've put my eye out.

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,116
So I asked him what to do, and he said,
"Put your head in this harness."

35
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,360
So I put my head
in the harness like this...

36
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,362
and he pulled out
a hypodermic needle.

37
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,910
I thought I was getting a shot in the eye,
and he said, "No, don't worry."

38
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,205
He took the needle off the end of it,
and he came at my eye...

39
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:43,251
and pulled out a piece of steel
about an inch long out of my eye.

40
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,541
And that's about it.

41
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,671
Well, I sleep with my eyes open...

42
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,516
and they dry out,
and then when I blink...

43
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,262
my eyelids tear
pieces of my eye off.

44
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,309
Very painful.

45
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,729
And I've tried a number of things...

46
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,394
to try to keep this
from happening.

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,484
I wrapped an ACE bandage
around my eyes one night...

48
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,028
to try to keep them shut,
but that didn't work...

49
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,904
and tried loading my eyes up
with all kinds of goop...

50
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,281
to keep them wet during the night -
that didn't work.

51
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,408
So what I've been doing is...

52
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,417
taping them shut at night...

53
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,795
which seems to work okay.

54
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,416
But it's pretty uncomfortable.
It looks pretty funny too.

55
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,761
Well, what happened -
I went to dinner with the wife...

56
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,756
and, um, I started getting
a headache...

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,303
a real bad headache,
and I never was sick before...

58
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,928
so I said,
"Well, let's go to a hospital."

59
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,688
She said, "You just got a headache.
Let's go home and get some aspirin."

60
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,103
I said, "No, let's go to the hospital."

61
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,023
So we went to Baptist Hospital...

62
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,364
and we got there,
and my eye started closing.

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,029
My, uh - It just started -

64
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,824
One eye just started closing,
on the right.

65
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,949
And it started hurting real bad,
and I was talking to the nurse...

66
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,958
and the doctor was coming
through the hall...

67
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,620
while I was explaining to her
what was going on.

68
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,794
And he looked at me and grabbed me
and took me upstairs...

69
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,926
and they took me right into X-ray,
and they checked it out.

70
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:15,297
And what it was, it was
an aneurysm behind my optic nerve...

71
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,513
and it was pressing against the nerve,
and it started ballooning out...

72
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,931
and it started getting
ready to bust.

73
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,521
And they took me
right into surgery.

74
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,016
They cut my deal open...

75
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,644
and did microscopic surgery...

76
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,529
right behind the optic nerve.

77
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,492
They sealed off the blood vessel
that was ballooning out.

78
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,075
And later the doctor told me
if I would've waited...

79
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,871
like an hour more, I wouldn't
be living today, you know.

80
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,834
And the wife told me to go home.

81
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,626
If I'd have went home,
I wouldn't have made it to the hospital.

82
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,547
Well, it's really difficult
to tell anybody this story...

83
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,012
because it was
such a dumb thing to do, but...

84
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,469
I accidentally...

85
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,184
put Super Glue in my eye...

86
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,850
thinking I was putting eyedrops.

87
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,185
It was very late at night.

88
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,684
I guess things like this
always happen late at night...

89
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,194
but my husband drags me off
to the emergency room.

90
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,152
I'm screaming.
I think I've been disfigured...

91
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,321
or blinded, at the least.

92
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:22,243
We're there for several hours,
and I'm told that...

93
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,743
I can either have surgery
to open the eye...

94
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,541
or I can just wait...

95
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,172
for the Super Glue to dissolve.

96
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,135
I understand it does not
adhere to human tissue...

97
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,256
and I was told that that would
probably be the best option.

98
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,475
So that's what I did.
I waited...

99
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,845
three or four days,
and finally it just loosened on its own.

100
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,972
And it all flaked out...

101
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,395
and I'm not blind.

102
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:54,238
I have funny eyelashes,
but otherwise I'm okay.

103
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,200
It was about ten years ago.
I was doing a brake job on my pickup truck...

104
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,490
and, uh, I was cleaning
the backing plate.

105
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,706
I had it up on blocks.
I had the wheels and everything torn apart...

106
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,372
and I was cleaning the backing plate
with a wire brush...

107
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,665
on an air tool...

108
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,630
and there was one spot left,
about the size of a quarter...

109
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,375
and the only way I could see it
was to look around to the side.

110
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,380
And it was throwing dirt back on me,
so I thought about getting safety glasses...

111
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,132
but then I thought,
"Nah, it's only the size of a quarter.

112
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,601
I'll finish it right away."
So I stuck the tool back in...

113
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,595
and sure enough,
a little dirt in the eye.

114
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,684
So I went into my trailer...

115
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,807
and I went into the bathroom.

116
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,106
I looked in the mirror
and opened my eye up like this...

117
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,777
and sure enough, bull's-eye -
a piece of wire sticking straight in the eye.

118
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,863
And I tried to grab it
with my finger...

119
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,703
and it was too short,
so I went outside and got my pliers...

120
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,948
wiped the grease off, came in,
grabbed hold of 'em...

121
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,825
and I started pulling,
and the eye was stretching out.

122
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,123
And I thought,
"I don't know what I should do...

123
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,789
but if I go see a doctor,
they'll have to take it out."

124
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,959
So I grabbed it again with the pliers
and pulled it out...

125
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,632
and when I did,
it tore a hole in the eye...

126
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,172
and the front sac of the eye
drained all the fluid out...

127
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,425
and I was blinded in one eye.

128
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,099
And the worst part was, I had
to finish the brake job with one eye -

129
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,769
two and a half hours -
so I could drive into town and see a doctor.

130
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,860
Well, this incident took place
right after a karate event.

131
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,944
I had placed well in a tournament...

132
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,987
was leaving the exhibit hall,
and was carrying a trophy.

133
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,781
I sensed something
was wrong, though.

134
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,621
I did a 360-degree turnaround.

135
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,992
I really felt something was wrong.
Maybe somebody was there.

136
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,278
But I was excited
I had done well at the tournament...

137
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,500
so I proceeded on
to the parking lot...

138
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,759
took a couple of steps, and someone
or something hit me from behind.

139
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,004
I later found out to be the trophy,
the karate trophy I was carrying...

140
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,177
with the foot figure
and the hand figure...

141
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,593
it raked right across my eye...

142
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,594
and I fell to the ground...

143
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,142
and immediately
put my hand upon my eye...

144
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,358
and felt a golf-ball-size object...

145
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,694
which I later found out
to be my eye.

146
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,939
My instinct was to push up.

147
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,067
I pushed and held pressure
and looked up...

148
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,569
and there was someone
taunting me...

149
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,696
and I later found out
it was to be someone...

150
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,411
who I'd fought earlier in the day
at the karate event.

151
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,081
I went on a fishing trip
with some kids.

152
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,296
We were on the bank of
Camp Singing Waters River...

153
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,415
and while we were standing there,
I was baiting my hook...

154
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,214
and somebody in front of me
must have flipped back their pole.

155
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,095
And I can still see this image,
and their arm's about to move forward...

156
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,715
and a tug on my eyelid,
and the hook had come...

157
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,468
right through my eyelid
and was pulling my eyelid out.

158
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,720
A lady grabbed the kid,
knocked him to the ground...

159
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,472
and grabbed the string.

160
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,224
Somehow they cut the string,
and I had to walk back to the camp.

161
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,486
After they took the worm off,
all I had was a hook sticking in my eye...

162
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,445
and they were able to get it out.

163
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,908
Well, I was cleaning my mother's oven
with a heavy-duty oven cleaner...

164
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,694
and the thought had crossed my mind
to put some glasses on.

165
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,289
And right at that moment, I hit the back
corner of the oven with the sponge...

166
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,205
and it sprayed right into my left eye.

167
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,748
And the pain was just excruciating...

168
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,046
and I immediately ran to the sink
and started flushing my eye with water.

169
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,716
And once I regained
some of my thoughts and composure...

170
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,180
I ran into the shower and shaved -

171
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,425
not "shaved," excuse me -

172
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,473
washed my eye out,
oh, for about 20 minutes.

173
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,847
And then I realized that I had no money...

174
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,271
and no way to get to a hospital,
because I'm in Washington, D.C...

175
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,610
and my mother was out with the car.

176
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,981
So at that point,
I decided to make some phone calls...

177
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,982
and call my dad, and he's a doctor...

178
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,235
and he said that I did the right thing.

179
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,236
And at that point, Mom came home...

180
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,989
took me to the emergency room,
where they signed me in...

181
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,617
and I had to wait about two hours
until the doctor told me...

182
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,627
that I saved my own eye.

183
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,585
And that's pretty much
what happened to my eye.

00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,714

<i>[ Spalding Gray]
I think - I think it all began...</i>

187
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,965
<i>the summer that I turned 50.</i>

188
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,511
I was leading a storytelling workshop
in upstate New York, about 15 people in it.

189
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,797
I asked them before they began
telling their stories...

190
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,020
to sit in a circle
as a kind of centering exercise...

191
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,269
and just look into one another's eyes.

192
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,895
Just eyes.

193
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,988
"When you get tired of looking
into one person's eyes...

194
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,905
move on to the next,
and so on around the circle."

195
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,869
And I was participating
in this exercise...

196
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,331
and I got locked into the eyes...

197
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,078
of this one particular woman
and could not get out.

198
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,001
Her name: Azaria Thornbird.

199
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,420
She was tall, blond, blue eyes...

200
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,091
about 33 years old, dressed in white -
the Immaculate Conception.

201
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,464
And I got locked into her eyes
and mesmerized.

202
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,967
And as I was staring at her face,
I saw that it was slowly decomposing...

203
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,312
and drooling down off of her skull
like a horror movie.

204
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,476
- Like a bad LSD trip.
<i>- ♫ [ Intensifies ]</i>

205
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,942
And all of a sudden, her face turned
into this pulsing oval ball of white light.

206
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,529
I'd never seen anything like it except
on the cover of a Carlos Castaneda book.

207
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,817
And it was dilating my pupils, this light.
Then all of a sudden - boom!

208
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,035
It came together in a point,
shot out the window...

209
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,200
like a white tornado,
and her face recomposed...

210
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,197
and was smiling back at me.

211
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,085
- And immediately my rational,
logical voice kicked in and said...

212
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,626
"That was just a case
of backlighting, wasn't it?

213
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,841
Dilating my pupils like that -
it was extreme backlighting.

214
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,972
Backlighting."

215
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,467
So I got back home...

216
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,890
where I was trying
to work on and finish my novel...

217
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,309
<i>Impossible Vacation.</i>

218
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,024
And I was reading over and over
a particularly painful section...

219
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,189
about my mother's suicide...

220
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,187
trying to get it right...

221
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,907
and I noticed that the print
on the page was breaking down.

222
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,989
I assumed it couldn't be the print.
I thought it must be eye fatigue.

223
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,363
So I remember
playing around with my eyes.

224
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,660
I started by covering my left eye...

225
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,658
and everything on the right
was in focus...

226
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,081
no matter
where I put the manuscript.

227
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,672
Then I covered my right...

228
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,132
and everything was out of focus...

229
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,219
no matter where
I held the manuscript.

230
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,304
And this was pretty frightening.

231
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,391
It was so frightening,
I thought I'd better forget about it.

232
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,228
Finish the novel first,
then worry about my eyes.

233
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,067
So it was about four months before I got up
the courage to get an eye examination.

234
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,652
I didn't have an ophthalmologist,
so I had one recommended to me...

235
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,942
a Dr. Schecter
on the Upper East Side.

236
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,408
And I went up for the standard exam,
not telling him anything about my eyes...

237
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,243
and he began with a little penlight,
shining it into my right eye...

238
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,455
then over to my left,
then to my right again.

239
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,120
Things were going smoothly.
Over to my left.

240
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,456
Then just as he's pulling to my right,
he goes left, left.

241
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,667
He brings down all these
other instruments. Left, left, left.

242
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,213
It's like a scene from <i>General Hospital,</i>
only the dramatic music is missing.

243
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,711
He pulls all the instruments away,
and he says...

244
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,556
"I think you have something wrong
with the retina of your left eye...

245
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,017
but I can't tell you what it is
because I'm not a retina specialist.

246
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,010
But I can recommend one to you,
and I think...

247
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,105
you should go to him
<i>this afternoon. "</i>

248
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,226
So he recommends a Dr. Mendel
on the Upper West Side.

249
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,820
I don't even bother to take a cab. I charge
from the Upper East to the Upper West...

250
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,377
running through Central Park
with my hand over my right eye...

251
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,742
noticing, "Oh, my God!
This is really serious.

252
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,031
The trees are all wavy.
There's no right angles.

253
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,120
The Rollerbladers are fuzz balls."

254
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,638
I get to Dr. Mendel's office.
The first thing that happens...

255
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,827
is the nurse comes out,
and she puts drops in my eyes.

256
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,353
I don't know what they're for. I'm just doing
what I do in any doctor's waiting room.

257
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:12,092
I'm catching up on my reading, you know?
<i>People, Time,</i> and <i>Newsweek.</i>

258
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,210
What else do you do
in a doctor's waiting room?

259
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,679
You don't look at the <i>art!</i>

260
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,549
So pretty soon I realize
my pupils are dilating.

261
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,928
She's put drops in my eyes to dilate
my pupils, and I can't read anymore.

262
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,680
I have to put down the books.
I'm going blind in the waiting room.

263
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,682
I'm reduced to waiting.

264
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,310
I'm <i>waiting</i> in the <i>waiting room!</i>

265
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,109
At last the nurse comes in
and leads me in to Dr. Mendel.

266
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,448
Introduces me.
He's a bit of a fuzz ball to me...

267
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,865
but what I do notice is, he's got
this rather large syringe in his hand.

268
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,704
He tells me he's got to shoot me up
with some colored dye.

269
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,075
I think, "Why not?
He's the doctor."

270
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,702
I mean, he's one of these guys
you gotta ask, "Why? What for?

271
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,169
What's going on?" with everything.
So he tells me what he has to do...

272
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,634
is put colored dye in me to highlight
the veins and capillaries in my eye...

273
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,970
and take color photos
of my eye. Fine.

274
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,590
So the nurse puts my chin up on this brace,
and I'm looking into two holes.

275
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,764
Happens to be the camera.
Happens to be a <i>ﬂash</i> camera.

276
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,559
Whoa! I'm pulling back.
The nurse is not holding my hand.

277
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,144
She's pushing my head forward.
It's like a torture.

278
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,064
It's like a <i>Clockwork Orange</i> situation.
All I can see is spots.

279
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,854
I pull away. I see Dr. Mendel
racing across his floor...

280
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,822
gown blowing
in the nonexistent breeze.

281
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,907
He's going off, scribbling madly
in shorthand on a pad...

282
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,029
to develop the photographs,
and I'm sitting there...

283
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,655
waiting.

284
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,373
Dilated and waiting.

285
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,367
Now the nurse is holding my hand,
telling me about...

286
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,711
some package deal she has
to the Bahamas.

287
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,047
At last, Dr. Mendel breezes back
into the room, scribbling on his pad.

288
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,917
He goes past me to the telephone.
Instead of speaking to me...

289
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,212
he calls my ophthalmologist,
Dr. Schecter.

290
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,556
Dr. Schecter isn't in,
so Dr. Mendel leaves a message.

291
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,095
"Hello? Dr. Schecter?

292
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,807
Dr. Mendel here.
First of all, I want to thank you...

293
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,307
for sending over your patient,
Gary Spalding.

294
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,310
Close inspection of the left macula
shows that there is a distortion...

295
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,902
of the interior limiting membrane...

296
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,738
secondary to the posterior
hyaloid-face contraction.

297
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,779
But the posterior hyaloid, which is
attached to the optic nerve macula...

298
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,154
and major vessels of the retina,
have remained attached and intact."

299
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,578
"Uh, Dr. Mandel. Over here, please.
It's me, the patient."

300
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,326
He turns his back to me
and goes on dictating.

301
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,795
"With dissolution
of the central vitreous gel...

302
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,880
the envelope that the vitreous gel
is in begins to shrink...

303
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,544
and distort the surface
of the retina.

304
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,136
A fluorescein angiogram was done to
determine the amount of vascular distortion.

305
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,467
I was surprised to see...

306
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,934
that he has some minimal
cystoid macula edema on that left eye...

307
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,146
on the basis of that capillary
incompetence from that distortion.

308
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,311
Thank you very much."

309
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,402
"Uh, Dr.-Dr. Mendel, please.

310
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:39,068
What is wrong with my left eye?
Tell me."

311
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,065
"Basically, Gary...

312
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,659
you have a macula pucker."

313
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,496
"A wh-wh-what - A ma-ma-mac-

314
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,329
A macula pucker?
Wh-What is that, Dr. Mendel?"

315
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,835
"Basically what's happened
is that your vitreal gel...

316
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,125
has broken down
and decomposed in your left eye...

317
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,374
and pulled away from the macula...

318
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,458
which is the center of the retina
and responsible for all detail in vision.

319
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,009
Now, the breakdown of the vitreal gel
is not that uncommon.

320
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,846
We find in most autopsies
that the cadaver no longer has a vitreal gel.

321
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
In your case
you were less fortunate...

322
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,437
because in pulling away from the macula,
it left a little piece of tissue...

323
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,477
and it's caused
your macula to pucker up.

324
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,192
Think of your retina
as a piece of Saran Wrap bunching.

325
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,483
You have a pucker, Gary.
A pucker."

326
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,608
"But what would cause that?
I can't possibly -

327
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,609
I don't have it happen
in my right eye.

328
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,157
I mean, wh-what would cause
a thing like that?"

329
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,202
"I don't know. Did you have
any trauma to that left eye?"

330
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,542
"Um, I can't think of any.

331
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,125
I mean, the last thing I remember happening
to my left eye was so long ago.

332
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,215
It was 1976, I remember.
It was New Year's Eve.

333
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,380
I was dancing with this woman.

334
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,783
She didn't have a good sense of her own
personal space, if you know what I mean...

335
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,969
and her pinkie shot into my left eye,
and she scratched my cornea.

336
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,468
It was tearing. It was painful.
They put a patch over it."

337
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,391
He just turns to me and says...

338
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,514
"You have a good memory,
don't you, Gary?"

339
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,983
"But is there anything
that could be -

340
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,727
you know, be done for the left eye?
Any corrective measures?"

341
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,737
"Yes, I think so.

342
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,400
I recommend
a little macular scraping."

343
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,244
As soon as I heard
that word "scraping"...

344
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,989
I knew I wanted
a second, third, and fourth opinion.

345
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,458
He tells me, don't bother.
He's the best macular scraper in town.

346
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,499
Up until then, I really didn't like this man.
Now I hated him.

347
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,590
I had no problem walking
right out of that office without any guilt.

348
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,583
I go back and tell Renée
what he said.

349
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,585
She's very upset,
but she's also excited...

350
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,587
because it means she can do research.

351
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,589
It's gonna give her some focus.
She's very good at research.

352
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,593
She wants to find
the best macular scraper in town.

353
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,436
I'm no good at research.
What am I good at? I don't know.

354
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,683
Sitting at my desk and speculating.
Speculating on causes.

355
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,606
Sitting down with my notebook.
"What could have caused this thing?"

356
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,276
Because under no circumstances
do I want it to happen to my right eye.

357
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,775
So I'm sitting there thinking,
"It's my book.

358
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,027
That's it. <i>Impossible Vacation.</i>

359
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,826
Reading over and over that painful section
about my mother's suicide.

360
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,577
I mean, without probably
mourning her or grieving her loss...

361
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,454
it probably made me cry
in one major way.

362
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,877
My eye just exploded.
One big tear."

363
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,998
Then I thought, "No, it's because
I wrote it in the first person - the book.

364
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:09,131
It was simply too much
'I, I, I, I, I.'"

365
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,426
Then I thought, "No, it's my left brain
rebelling against my right."

366
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,769
Or vice versa,
because I am dyslexic.

367
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,887
Now, whenever I'd ask
any of my New Age friends...

368
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,436
what they thought was going on,
they would say...

369
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,607
"Well, what is it
you don't want to see?"

370
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,106
And I had lists.

371
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,232
Then I thought it was
my Oedipus complex...

372
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,031
because the book <i>Impossible Vacation</i>
was somewhat about that.

373
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,497
Not that I was consciously aware
of ever wanting to sleep with my mother...

374
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,705
but at the time I was writing the book,
I was reading Freud's essay on negation.

375
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,672
And in that essay, Freud says
the denial of some state of affairs...

376
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,132
is the implicit
acknowledgement of it.

377
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,378
So that if a guy says he never
wanted to sleep with his mother...

378
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,676
the chances are he gave it
some solid consideration.

379
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,347
So I'm thinking now the unconscious part
that gave it the solid consideration...

380
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,098
is now reaching up and scratching out
my eyes one at a time...

381
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,100
beginning with my left
and feminine eye.

382
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,478
So that's what I'm doing
with <i>my</i> time!

383
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,480
Meanwhile, while I was
speculating on causes...

384
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,655
Renée was out looking for - and finding -
one of the best macular men around.

385
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,619
A Chinese doctor.
I liked him immediately.

386
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,579
He had a really good
bedside manner.

387
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,573
You know, a smile like Buddha.

388
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,121
Most of these eye doctors
are like automatons.

389
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,210
Also, I liked his language.

390
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,547
Instead of "macular scraping"...

391
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:29,381
he referred to what had to be done
to my eye as "macular peeling." Right?

392
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,345
Also, he says, "Mr. Gray...

393
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,466
please stop worrying about causes...

394
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,264
because this condition is idiopathic...

395
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,059
meaning 'no known cause.'"

396
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,523
Idiopathic.

397
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,190
He wants me to know all about the operation.
It's a relatively new operation.

398
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,187
It costs $10,000.

399
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,407
It's not guaranteed
to correct my vision, but it could help.

400
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,902
What he has to do
is take a very sharp knife...

401
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,038
and cut my left eye in two places,
two incisions.

402
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,454
Into the first he sticks
a little miniature vacuum cleaner...

403
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,748
a little pump, to suck out
what's left of the vitreal gel.

404
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,039
Then, in he sticks
a teeny little peeler.

405
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,257
Microscopic.
It's microsurgery.

406
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,718
And he peels the retina.

407
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,964
Now, he wants me to know
what risks are involved in the operation...

408
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,683
so I can make an educated choice
and he won't be responsible.

409
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,679
The first risk is
slight chance of infection...

410
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,056
which would mean prosthesis.

411
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,559
Also, he could slip
and tear the retina while peeling...

412
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,779
which would mean
instant blindness in the left eye.

413
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,318
Also, there's a 35 percent chance
of cataract...

414
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,659
due to the trauma from the operation...

415
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,279
and there's a one percent chance
that the whole condition...

416
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,327
will simply clear up on its own...

417
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,123
which I'm banking on.

418
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,458
"But, Mr. Gray," he says, "no rush.

419
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,339
We don't have to operate right away.
I have to check on it every so often.

420
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,425
See how it's progressing.
We can take our time."

421
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,136
"You can?
Well, that's great. You mean -

422
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,096
'Cause I'm not gonna
sit around and wait.

423
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,965
I could try alternatives, right,
while I'm waiting?

424
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,434
Like diet, acupuncture,
prayer, all three?

425
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,269
I could do that, couldn't I?"

426
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,856
"Oh, yes," he says,
with his great Buddha smile.

427
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,568
"Try all the alternatives you want.

428
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,404
Then we'll have to operate."

429
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,149
So I got back home
and told Renée what the doctor said...

430
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,159
and she said, "Spald...

431
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,787
do you know
what 'prosthesis' means?"

432
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,952
And I said, "Um, I think so.

433
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,372
I mean, I thought I knew when I walked
in here, but now I'm a little fuzzy.

434
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,872
Wait a minute. It hasn't got anything
to do with the prostate gland, does it?

435
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,341
No, wait. Doesn't it mean
'false arm' or 'false leg?'"

436
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,759
And Renée says,
"Try 'eye.' Try 'glass eye.'"

437
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,257
Oh, God. I didn't want to go
into a hospital if I could help it.

438
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,421
I didn't want to go in. A friend of mine
around the time this was going on...

439
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,475
went in for a simple gall bladder operation,
into a New York hospital.

440
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,156
The nurse gave him a shot
in the wrong quadrant of his buttock...

441
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,443
and hit his sciatic nerve
and paralyzed his right leg.

442
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,519
Now he's suing the hospital
for a million dollars.

443
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,234
I didn't want to go in!

444
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,904
I had a girlfriend
that was dating her ob-gyn...

445
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,225
and she'd go on these dates to the hospital,
because he had a cubicle with a bed.

446
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,409
He was always waiting
to be called to deliver babies.

447
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,204
And also, she'd go there
because he had access...

448
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,497
to liquid cocaine...

449
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:11,122
and they would wipe this liquid cocaine
on their genitals and then light a doobie...

450
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,215
and go to town.

451
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,344
And in the middle of this date,
the doctor's beeper would go off...

452
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,260
and he'd jump up stoned with an erection
and go off and deliver a baby.

453
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,386
I didn't want to go in!
I didn't want to!

454
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,644
I didn't want to go into a hospital
if I could help it, please!

455
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,933
Also, what did I know
about hospitals or doctors?

456
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:31,134
- I grew up as a Christian Scientist.
I had no experience with hospitals or doctors.
<i>- [Birds Chirping ]</i>

457
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,403
Growing up as a Christian Scientist
in Barrington, Rhode Island, was lonely.

458
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,439
There were about six of us:

459
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,765
my three brothers,
a couple of brothers down the street.

460
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,820
There was no church in Barrington.
We had to go to church in Providence.

461
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,163
Basically, my friends treated me
like anyone else...

462
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,248
except in the summertime
they'd get bored...

463
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,288
and kind of back me up
against an elm tree...

464
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,583
and start their own little
Protestant Inquisition by saying...

465
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,669
"You're a Christian Scientist, right?"
"That's right."

466
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,090
"That means you don't believe in doctors?"
"Uh, that's right."

467
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,971
- "Uh, say lightning hit this tree now...
<i>- [ Thunder]</i>

468
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,932
And a branch cracked, came down,
hit your head, and your brains were
drooling all over the grass.

469
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,719
Would you go to a doctor then?"
"No."

470
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,472
"Uh, say you're walking across the street,
and a cement mixer...

471
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,942
- squished and pulverized the whole
lower part of your body into the pavement.
<i>- [ Splattering Sounds ]</i>

472
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,278
Would you go to a doctor then?"
"No."

473
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,023
"Uh...

474
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,776
say the North Koreans invaded
Barrington, Rhode Island...

475
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,620
- and they took a cage of starving rats
and put them up to your ass...
<i>- [ Rats Squeaking ]</i>

476
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,857
and the rats started eating
up through into your body.

477
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,663
Would you go to a doctor then?"
"No!'"

478
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,502
So I began to feel my friends
had a death wish for me.

479
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,499
I mean, it kind of put me
on the outside of the community.

480
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,876
I did have some healings, though.
I remember-

481
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,094
I'm trying to think of one
I can tell you - share with you.

482
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,804
Oh, I know.
When I was in seventh grade...

483
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,887
one morning I woke up
with this little, like, piece of flesh...

484
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,262
growing off the end of my nose,
like a little flesh stalactite...

485
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,266
and it kept growing, and my friends
kept looking at me and saying...

486
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,313
"Ya got some snot on your nose."

487
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:59,189
And I'd say, "It's not snot.

488
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,361
It's not."

489
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,484
So I wanted to have it
burned off, cauterized.

490
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,325
I wanted to go to a doctor.
Have a quickie. Bypass prayer.

491
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,698
So I went to my mother and asked her
if she would take me, and she said...

492
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,574
"Spuddy, dear, no. Please.

493
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,203
Let's let the Christian Science
practitioner pray for it first."

494
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,798
So I had to do it.
What can I say? She had the car.

495
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,634
So we all began praying.
I was praying for the little thing to drop off.

496
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,628
She was praying
it would drop off.

497
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,222
The Christian Science practitioner
was praying for it to drop off.

498
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,012
But it didn't drop off.

499
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,774
At the end of the week, I said,
"Can I go to the doctor now, Mom?"

500
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,438
And she said, "Give it one more day.
Please, dear, one more day."

501
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,058
Well, I had to give it one more day,
because on that particular day -

502
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,543
it was a Monday -
I was being tutored in seventh-grade math.

503
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,479
I was failing seventh-grade math.

504
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,484
I remember my tutor was
this nice older woman...

505
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,483
and she kept looking at my nose.

506
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:48,329
And she finally said, [Granny Voice ]
"Looks like you could use a hankie."

507
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,743
So I tried to humor her.
I took her lace handkerchief...

508
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,787
wiped my nose, and...

509
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,915
off it came!

510
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,913
[Chuckles]
So...

511
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:02,088
keeping this healing in mind,
I decided for my first alternative...

512
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,337
I would try calling
a Christian Science practitioner.

513
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,761
I'd never called one before.
My mom always had.

514
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,430
So I remember
I was touring in London.

515
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:14,146
I was in London, and I got the name
of a practitioner in San Francisco.

516
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,607
Now, I thought, "The power of prayer
can go around the world, they say.

517
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,726
Maybe it'll go halfway."
So I call up.

518
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,292
Now, when you call a Christian Science
practitioner, you're not supposed to mention...

519
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,527
any disease names.

520
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,742
It gives it power.
Don't name the condition.

521
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,403
Just refer to it as an "error."

522
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,496
So needless to say,
there's a lot of innuendo...

523
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,661
that goes around that word "error."

524
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,911
Is it a <i>b-i-i-i-g</i> error, as in cancer?

525
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,375
A little error? Cold.
Medium error? Flu.

526
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,816
But I jumped right in and started
describing the condition.

527
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,759
"Hello? This is Spalding Gray
calling from London...

528
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,920
and I have an eye condition.

529
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,344
My left eye is totally blurry.
They're calling it -"

530
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,139
"I think we've heard
just about enough, Mr. Gray.

531
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,604
Now, first of all, I would like you to go
to a Christian Science reading room...

532
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,225
and look up Mary Baker Eddy's book
<i>Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.</i>

533
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,525
Look up "The Perfection of Eyes,"
page 624 and 625.

534
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,898
I will also send you some information.

535
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,025
Now, I want to ask you:

536
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,699
Are you faithful?"

537
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,699
"Oh- uh- you mean,
am I filled with faith?"

538
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,453
"No. Are you seeing
anyone else?

539
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,963
Any doctors?"

540
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,128
"Oh, I see what you mean.

541
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,920
Well, uh, there's this Chinese guy,
but it's nothing serious.

542
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,513
I mean, once a month
I check in with him -"

543
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,430
"I'm afraid we can't work that way.
We can't be duplicitous in our faith.

544
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,303
You have to choose me or the doctor.
So you think it over.

545
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,643
You can get back to me anytime.
I'll be here.

546
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,766
God bless."

547
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,768
And he hangs up...

548
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,316
and I realized at that moment...

549
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,281
why it was I had left
Christian Science.

550
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,278
So I went to my therapist
to talk to him about my eye condition.

551
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,656
My therapist
was a graduate of Auschwitz...

552
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,955
so he was an existential realist.

553
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:02,797
And I told him the story,
and he listened and then said...

554
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:07,134
[ Deep, Accented Voice ]
"Spalding - Spalding, please, please.

555
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,046
All things are contingent...

556
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,721
and there is also chaos.

557
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,640
In other words...

558
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,603
shit happens.

559
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,975
Please, give up
this magical-thinking business, huh?

560
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,024
Airy-fairy, Disneyland, Tinker Bell...

561
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,235
<i>Angels in America</i> nonsense, please.

562
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,779
Do the right thing.

563
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,198
Get the operation."

564
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,539
So he was no help.

565
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,124
<i>So I walk out of my therapist's office
doing my New York walking blues.</i>

566
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,246
I've got a ratty old overcoat...

567
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,749
and I haven't shaved in four days,
and I'm hunched over.

568
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,468
I don't care where I'm walking.
I'm just walking...

569
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,553
and I'm thinking, "How?

570
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,095
How could I allow someone
to cut into my eye with a knife?

571
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,559
Cut into the window to my soul?"

572
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,553
And why - why this affliction?

573
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,932
Of all the things -
losing the detail in my vision.

574
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,936
I mean, I totally depend on seeing
the detail in order to tell stories.

575
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,781
I'm not making any of this up. I mean,
don't you think I'd rather sit at home...

576
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,775
<i>and be able to make things up?</i>

577
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,902
<i>It'd be so much less
wear and tear on my body.</i>

578
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,945
<i>But I'm thinking,
"I need my right eye."</i>

579
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,414
What would happen
if I went blind in my right eye?

580
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,751
I mean, what would I become?
A blind poet in New York City?

581
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,663
I hate poetry,"
I'm thinking as I'm walking.

582
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,131
And I find I'm walking now
in the Bowery...

583
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,296
which is fine,
because I feel like...

584
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,921
I belong there at this point,
and a bunch of prostitutes are on the street.

585
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,219
You know,
the kind that just trick out of cars?

586
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,968
And they're paying no attention to me.
I'm walking on by.

587
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,971
In fact, they're rushing over
to an old black Pontiac...

588
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,941
I see pulling up to the curb there
out of the corner of my good eye.

589
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,060
They're rushing over like-like -

590
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,233
like a bunch of prostitutes, really.

591
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,153
And they get over to the car,
and one of them turns and yells...

592
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,776
"Hey, yo, boy! Over here!

593
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,074
They want you!"

594
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,907
And I turned...

595
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,784
because I'm curious...

596
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,295
and I love to be wanted.

597
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,503
And I walk over,
and the prostitutes part like the Red Sea...

598
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,752
and I walk up
to this old black Pontiac...

599
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,878
and it's got three Hasidic Jews in it -

600
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,880
two in the front, one in the back.

601
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,224
And they say, "Get in."

602
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,344
And I do...

603
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,471
because I'm curious...

604
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,982
and I love to be wanted.

605
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,190
So I get in the back with the youngest,
and they drive off down the Bowery.

606
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:35,361
The prostitutes are yelling,
"Bye! Have a good trick!"

607
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,701
So I don't know -
Where are they taking me, I ask.

608
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,492
They tell me they're taking me
over to Williamsburg.

609
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,658
I think, "Well, why not?
I've never been to Williamsburg.

610
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,830
Why not take a tour?
Williamsburg.

611
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,045
Go with the chosen people."

612
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,414
So by now, anyway,
I'm telling them my name is Peter.

613
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,507
I say I'm a drifter from Schenectady.

614
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,666
I'm kind of just making myself up.
Tired of the old Spalding Gray, you know?

615
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,513
"Peter with perfect eyes"
kind of concept.

616
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,766
And they're saying,
do I want anything to eat?

617
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,182
They want to buy pizza and beer for me.
I say, "No, no, thank you.

618
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,143
I've just eaten,
and I don't drink before 5:00."

619
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,938
So over the bridge we go.
Pull up in front of a synagogue.

620
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,481
I go with the ﬂow.
I follow the three of them in.

621
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,479
We go into this old synagogue.

622
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,481
Other Hasidic Jews are in there...

623
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,859
mending the bindings
of old books and looking up...

624
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,903
and winking at me
like little Santa Clauses.

625
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,702
I follow the driver of the car
into the kitchen.

626
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,041
He gets out a couple
of plastic garbage bags...

627
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,122
a rake, a shovel, a broom...

628
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,042
opens the back door,
referring me out to the backyard...

629
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,047
says, "Please.

630
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,800
Go. Clean."

631
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,386
So, hey, I knew I could just say
I was Spalding Gray...

632
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,718
and drop everything and walk away,
but I didn't.

633
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,804
I continued to be Peter.

634
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,097
And I walked down
into that backyard...

635
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,937
and I took the rake,
and I began to rake.

636
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:51,935
I'm raking up all these broken
plastic knives and forks and paper plates...

637
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,653
and things left over from parties
and wet leaves.

638
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,774
I'm doing a good job.
In fact, I feel this energy. Mm!

639
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:01,744
This raking energy I haven't felt
since I was a kid in my father's yard.

640
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:05,406
I'm doing such a good job, I could feel
these muscles in here getting strong again.

641
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,451
I'm doing such a good job, a woman
that lives behind the synagogue...

642
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,919
throws up her window and says,
"Yo, boy! Hey!

643
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,501
You work good. You come here next?
How much you charge?"

644
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,171
I said, "No, no, no.
I'm all booked up. Sorry."

645
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,545
About an hour's time
I got all the leaves in the bag, tied up.

646
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,592
The driver of the car
walks out on the porch...

647
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,349
looks over,
peruses the backyard, says...

648
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:28,016
"Very good.
You work very good.

649
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,559
You are the hardest-working
Bowery bum...

650
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,978
we've ever picked up.

651
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,944
Usually they come here,
they work for drinks.

652
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,938
You don't seem to drink...

653
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,236
so I suppose we must
pay you something."

654
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:43,657
"Yes. I suppose so."

655
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,075
"Mm, eight dollars."

656
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,291
"No, no. Ten. Even up in Schenectady,
it's ten dollars an hour.

657
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,292
I've been out here an hour."

658
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:55,456
"Mm, eight plus carfare."

659
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,842
"Uh, no. Ten, and I'll walk."

660
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,961
Here it is - a Scot and a Jew
haggling it out...

661
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,339
in the backyard of a synagogue.

662
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,761
I get the ten dollars, and I walk.

663
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,806
Triumphantly across the Brooklyn Bridge
I'm walking, thinking...

664
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,804
"Hey, look at that.

665
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,433
There is something I can do
if I go blind in my right eye."

666
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,649
So shortly after this,
there was a reunion call...

667
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,239
for the storytelling workshop
that I did in upstate...

668
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,358
and it was to be held
in New York City.

669
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,656
I wasn't sure if I was going to go...

670
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,745
and then I thought,
I'd better go...

671
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,867
because maybe Azaria Thornbird
would show up...

672
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,335
and I really wanted to see
Azaria again.

673
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,546
I- I want to try to describe her.

674
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,541
It's hard to get words
around this woman.

675
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,169
All right. She lives outside Minneapolis.
She's a single mother.

676
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,576
Has two sons she raised.
I think she did a very good job.

677
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,345
I've met them.
They're nine and 11 years old.

678
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,015
And the only kind of odd thing
for Azaria is that...

679
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,646
she happened to be
a sorcerer's apprentice.

680
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,517
She trained with this sorcerer,
Everet K. Whiteowl...

681
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,269
who's part Welsh and part
Native American Indian...

682
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,898
and he trains out in the desert
outside Los Angeles...

683
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,526
in what I refer to as
"Manson country."

684
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,153
And she was going out to do
these very esoteric trainings...

685
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,623
in astral projection,
lucid dream state...

686
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,870
the Breath of Fire, which she's teaching
to women in the Minneapolis area now...

687
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:20,841
and then - oh, the American Indian
tantric sexual initiations.

688
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,255
The Quidoshka trainings, right?

689
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,755
Which she was about to be initiated to
and he was doing with women out there...

690
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,804
but she couldn't get out to do it
because she was running out of airfare.

691
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,973
She couldn't afford
to fly out anymore.

692
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,017
So what she told me she did -
Now, I believed this when she told it to me.

693
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,391
I was very convinced.
She said she would go to sleep at night...

694
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,400
in her bed in Minneapolis...

695
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,859
and out of her corporeal body
would rise this astral body.

696
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,140
She'd go into a lucid dream state
and astral-project...

697
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,112
and up would come this astral body,
and it would go and mingle and mix...

698
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,579
around various Indian grandmothers
in the living room...

699
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,495
and then go upstairs and meet
Everet K. Whiteowl's astral body...

700
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,415
and they would have
their Quidoshka workshop...

701
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,630
and - zoop! -
save money on airfare.

702
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,623
And - thoop! -
soon as they finished...

703
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,001
Everet K.'s astral body
would go "whoop!" back to the desert...

704
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,843
faster than American Airlines...

705
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,259
and Azaria's would go "whoop!"
back into her corporeal body...

706
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,257
and she'd wake up in one body.

707
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,642
So I say, "Azaria...

708
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,478
you mean to say
you have two bodies -

709
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,555
one that can stand up
and look back at the other -

710
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,607
and you've never tried
to make love to yourself?"

711
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,439
I mean, that's the first thing
that would occur to me...

712
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,603
before I'd go mixing
with Indian grandmothers.

713
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,449
Please myself. She says
it never occurred to her. Never.

714
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,570
And then she says
she tried it and it worked.

715
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,537
So she was very open.

716
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,452
Now, what she did
show me, actually...

717
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,792
that I did see happen
was this Breath of Fire.

718
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,468
Now, this is an extraordinary thing.
I mean, where I come from...

719
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,373
women 200 years ago would've been
burned at the stake for doing this.

720
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,216
She lay on the floor,
and without touching herself once...

721
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,213
she had about eight classic
Reichian orgasms.

722
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,090
She came from her toes to her nose.
It was like...

[ Orgasmic Moaning ]

724

I'm just sitting there going,
"Teach me, teach me, teach me!

725
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,814
Do you know how many lonely hotels
and motels I stay in across America?

726
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,974
If I could come like that
without touching myself...

727
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:08,482
I'd be a happy man -
or at least content."

728
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,322
So she tells me
I have to lie on the floor, right?

729
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,737
And I have to suck
the energy in the room -

730
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,412
"energy," whatever that is -
into the base of my spine.

731
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,251
Through what hole,
I don't know.

732
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,245
So I'm doing a lot of visualization.

733
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,418
I see energy as these pink balls
of cotton candy...

734
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,416
kind of floating around aimlessly...

735
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,420
and as far as the hole in my spine,
I see my coccyx...

736
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,421
as hollow, with a little cork in it.

737
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,799
[ Makes Popping Sound ]
I take out the cork, and I begin to suck.

[Slurping ]

739
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,100
I mean, really,
the closest I could get...

740
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,895
was a sense of reverse farting.

00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:47,021
[ Exhales ] All I'm trying to say is
she's an interesting woman.

742
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,490
And she did show up at the workshop.
I couldn't look her in the face, though.

743
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,687
And I couldn't stop talking
about my eye operation...

744
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,615
how I was gonna get it
or not get it...

745
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,704
and I kept deflecting,
and she said, "Spalding...

for an operation.

Listen to me.
Come out to Minneapolis...

748
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,114
and we'll have
a Native American sweat lodge for you.

00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,501
And the power of our prayer -
it's larger than one-on-one.

"All right. I'll try to."

"Well, I'll give it a try."
"No. Look me in the eyes now."

begins to drool
and peel down off of her skull...

755
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:21,142
and I say, "Stop it! Whatever
you're doing with your face, don't do it!

I will come out to Minneapolis.

I'll do it. I'll come."

759
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:32,316
I think I would try
an Indian sweat ceremony.

760
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,990
I don't think it could be much stranger
than my trip to the hypnotherapist.

761
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:40,332
And maybe it'd be more successful.
Who knows?

762
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,325
I don't think so.

763
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,374
An Indian sweat ceremony?
Never heard of it.

764
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,463
That's a pretty mystic idea.

An Indian sweat ceremony?

766
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,007
It sounds interesting,
but I don't think so.

767
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,631
I wouldn't like to participate
in an Indian sweat lodge...

768
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,803
because it's a dark place
full of smoke...

769
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,892
and it's too damn hot for me.

770
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,979
Uh, an Indian sweat ceremony
could be interesting...

Perfect time to sweat.</i>

<i>I'm glad I went out.
It was really interesting.</i>

775
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,283
She had about 15 followers,
all practicing these Native American rituals.

776
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,204
She started out by doing
the peace-pipe ritual in a barn.

777
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,247
It was very cold. Very cold.

778

She's calling the spirits
from the four directions.

779
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,711
Then she takes us outside.
The sweat lodge is all built.

780
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,255
If you've never seen one -
traditional Indian sweat lodge -

781
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,004
it's a low dome made by saplings...

782
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,131
that are all interwoven...

783
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,806
and over it, the Indians would put
animal skins, buffalo skins.

784
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,975
In this case, they had blue plastic
and canvas tarpaulin.

785
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,521
And, oh, the fire. The fire keeper had
the fire going since 6:00 in the morning...

786
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,190
so the rocks were very hot
to make the steam.

787
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,530
We go out, we're standing there
knee-deep in snow...

788
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,944
and Azaria says,
"All right, take off your clothes...

789
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,942
and throw them in the snow,"
and we do it.

790
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,820
We do whatever she says.
Now we're standing naked...

791
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,161
knee-deep, naked in the snow,
like these freezing refugees...

792
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,827
and we have to line up
to go in the sweat lodge.

793
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,745
Well, I'm in fourth place...

794
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,089
as quick as I can get over there
in the line, and I'm looking around...

795
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,334
and I notice,
all these people around me -

796
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,426
there are no Native Americans there.

00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,217
Basically, they look Swedish.

798
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,262
So we're told that before
we're to go into the sweat lodge...

799
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,353
we have to cry out to the sky the phrase
"All my ancestors."

"All my ancestors." They're in.

802
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,527
Comes my turn. I go,
"All my ancestors"...

803
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,489
and I start in the sweat lodge,
and I stop and I think, "Wait a minute.

had just finished the family tree...

806
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,539
and I remembered going over it,
and I remembered some of the names:

807
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,119
John Proctor...

808
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:50,462
the Right Reverend Curtis Fox Gray
and his wife, Thankful Atherton Gray...

809
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,378
Colonel Simeon Spalding,
Captain Edward Spalding...

810
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,260
Brigadier General John Crane...

811
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,722
the only man wounded
at the Boston Tea Party.

812
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,386
And I think, all my ancestors?
Who were they? Pilgrims.

813
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,396
What did they do shortly after
they came to America?

814
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,390
Kill the Indians.

815
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:14,357
Where was I going?
An Indian sweat lodge.

816
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,696
Good luck.

817
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,487
Ooh, and I go into the tent.
It's not warm in there.

818
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,701
It's not even hot in any way.

819
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,991
It's musty, cold, dank, dark.

820
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,366
There's about 15 of us, men and women,
naked, sitting in a circle on top of hay...

821
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,242
which is on top of the snow.

822
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,449
And Azaria starts telling us
what's going to happen.

823
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,376
She says there'll be
four rounds of prayers.

824
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,250
The first round
will be to set intention.

825
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,966
Prayer for intention or attitude -
what we want to maintain...

826
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,589
throughout the whole ceremony,
which could be anywhere from...

827
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,933
two and a half, three hours, you know -
you just never know.

828
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,893
And then the second round
of prayers will be...

829
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,309
the prayers for friends
and loved ones.

830
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,524
Then the third round -
which is very important -

831
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,234
the third round is that
we give away or renounce...

832
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,355
anything we're attached
that we no longer want to be attached to -

833
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,278
you know, like, say,
<i>an eye condition.</i>

834
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,285
Now - "But this is very important,"
she says.

835
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,618
"On the third round,
do not in any way, please,

836
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,623
take on
the other person's giveaway.

837
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,786
Don't identify with whatever the pathology is
that's being passed around.

838
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,627
Just let it go right out through the tent,
please, or you could be very sick."

839
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,046
And the fourth round
is not exactly a round of prayers...

840
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,215
but what happens is,
hot rocks are brought in...

841
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,931
and then she pours cold water over them,
and we just sit and listen to them steam.

842
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,222
And if we listen very carefully,
you see, these rocks may give...

843
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,846
valuable information, all right?

844
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,474
Now, before we begin, what we have
to say is, the procedure is this:

845
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,520
We have to say,
"O Great Spirit, my name is -"

846
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,942
Then you state your name,
you do your prayer, and then you say...

847
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,612
"I have spoken" to indicate
that the next person can go...

848
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,076
and I do hope it goes smoothly
'cause there are quite a few of us.

849
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,446
And in the fire keeper brings
the first hot rocks...

850
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,244
and pours them in the pit,
and Azaria pours the cold water...

851
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,834
and - [Imitates Steam Hissing ]
Whoa! Whoo!

852
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,745
Steam starts coming up,
and it's hot, let me tell you.

853
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,465
Across my chest I can feel it.
I think, "It could get very warm in here."

854
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,381
And the first rounds of prayers
start out slowly...

855
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,300
<i>rounds of first intention.</i>

856
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,300
"O Great Spirit,
my name is Shelly...

857
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,678
and I pray that I can maintain
a sincere and open attitude...

858
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,723
during this sacred ceremony.
I have spoken."

859
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,521
"O Great Spirit, my name is Seth...

860
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,940
and I pray that I can maintain...

861
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,439
a humble attitude
during this sacred ceremony.

862
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,156
I have spoken."

863
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,072
"O Great Spirit,
this is Spalding speaking...

864
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,572
and I pray I can maintain
a sincere and open attitude...

865
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,075
during this sacred ceremony
and not pollute it...

866
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,328
with my heady analysis
and ironic commentary...

867
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:40,047
and end up turning this sacred event
into just another story...

868
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,917
I will try to sell
to the American public.

869
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,840
I have spoken."

870
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:49,011
And everyone in the tent goes,
"Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho"...

871
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,136
which I take to be a kind of
cheerleading attitude to say...

872
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,059
"Hey, let's see if you can
pull that one off."

873
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,733
More hot rocks are brought in.
We're going into round two.

874
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,569
We're praying for friends and loved ones.
Oh, man, it's steaming up!

875
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,688
I can't even see across
the other side of the tent.

876
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,908
People are groaning, down on their sides.
I'm getting down on my side...

877
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,245
trying to breathe some fresh air in
under where the tent hits the ground.

878
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,331
And we're praying for friends
and loved ones. I pray for Renée.

879
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,048
I pray that at last she'll get
a Hollywood film script to write...

880
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,119
that she really likes,
that will be funny...

881
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,292
that will pay her well and <i>get made.</i>

882
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,916
And I pray for friends with AIDS.

883
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,210
"Ploo!" Oh, boy!
More hot rocks are brought in.

884
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:28,429
We're going into round three.
We're gonna do the giveaway...

885
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,636
and I'm down
on my side now, panting.

886
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,180
All I can think of
is my health club in New York City.

887
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,679
I see in my mind's eye
the sign for the steam room:

888
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,898
"Do not exceed ten minutes
under any circumstances."

889
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,894
And I think, "Whoo!
Who is this Azaria Thornbird?

890
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,895
So her head turned
into a ball of white light.

891
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,897
Does that mean
she's not trying to kill me?"

892
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,740
And people are down
on the ground, praying.

893
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:51,487
"O Great Spirit, my name is Shelly. I want
to give away my pride. I have spoken."

894
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,739
"O Great Spirit, my name is Seth...

895
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:56,412
and I want to give away
my macho attitude. I have spoken."

896
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,253
"O Great Spirit, this is Tyrus. I want to give
away my craving for caffeine. I have spoken."

897
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,121
"O Great Spirit, my name is Ingrid.

898
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,749
I want to give away my gluttony.
I have spoken."

899
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,468
"O Great Spirit,
this is Spalding speaking...

900
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:11,257
and I want to give away the fear that I'm
about to have a heart attack at any minute!"

901
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,179
And just as I say that, a guy next to me
about my age with a beard...

902
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,553
grabs his chest and goes,
"My hear': is popping!

903
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,475
My heart is popping!
My heart is popping!"

904
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,475
And he runs out of the sweat tent.
And I'm fine.

905
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,229
He just took all my fear
and ran right out the door with it.

906
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:29,733
Azaria says, "Someone has broken
the sacred circle here. Do you hear me?

907
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,111
No one is to leave this sweat lodge
in the middle of the ceremony.

908
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,659
Now we are about to sit here
and listen to the hot rocks steam...

909
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,407
and possibly talk.

910
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,706
If you feel you have to go, go now,
but as soon as that tent flap is closed...

911
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,670
no one leaves."

912
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,542
Now, I am both very claustrophobic
and find it difficult to take orders...

913
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,920
but I am determined
to get through this sweat ceremony.

914
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:54,265
I just hope that the hot rocks
don't talk too long.

915
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:57,226
The fire keeper brings the hot rocks in,
puts them in the pit.

916
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,391
Azaria pours the cold water over.

917
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,311
Just as she does this, one of
her members of her lodge jumps up...

918
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,230
a guy with a ponytail down to his ass,
rushes for the door.

919
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,150
Azaria hurls her naked body
in front of him and yells...

920
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,865
"Get back, Lame Deer!
Get back!"

921
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,407
He falls back on the hay, going,
"Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Shit!"

922
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,531
Everyone else is going,
"Ho, ho, ho...

923
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,246
ho, ho, ho?

924
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,246
They're "ho-ing" him.
They're "ho-ing" him down.

925
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,917
"Ho, ho."

926
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,376
And at last,
we sit there in silence...

927
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,386
and listen to the hot rocks steam.

928
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,888
And I didn't understand a word.

929
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,898
And I stepped out of that sweat lodge,
and I felt triumphant.

930
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,902
I'd made it through.
I don't know how long I'd been in there.

931
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,110
Two and a half, three hours?
The sun was going down...

932
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,861
like a - like a big... sun,
like a big red sun...

933
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,534
casting rivers of red
across a crusty white snow.

934
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,873
I could've rolled in that snow
in my new naked body.

935
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,335
I'm standing there, I'm feeling
this internal heat pouring out...

936
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,581
and Azaria comes over and says,
"Spalding, what is wrong with you?"

937
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,174
"Nothing. What are you talking about?
I feel great."

938
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:14,467
"No. When the time came for you
to talk about your eye condition...

939
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,511
you began babbling
about a heart attack!"

940
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,101
"Oh. Oh - Oh.

941
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,852
Oh, God."

942
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,098
And I realized
I was still the child...

943
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,443
who had to act
on his most immediate fears.

944
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,445
<i>So I get back to New York City.</i>

945
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,035
I'm pretty depressed.

946
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,029
More than usual.

947
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,704
I'm sitting at the kitchen table,
talking to Renée...

948
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,952
about the sweat lodge...

949
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,746
and listening
to my health-food show...

950
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:52,466
Barry Spires, every day at noon.

951
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,127
In case you don't know...

952
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,762
Barry Spires is one of the most
radical nutritionists in the universe.

953
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,802
He sleeps two hours a day...

954
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,139
and lives on air,
when he can find it.

955
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,645
Usually I listen to him -
I go up and buy health food...

956
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,148
up at the local health food store
and listen...

957
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,225
but I never can eat,
because according to Barry...

958
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:13,029
<i>everything</i> gives you cancer,
and everything else cures you of it.

959
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,490
So I'm listening, and Renée gets
this lightbulb idea after the show.

960
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:20,244
"Why don't you call Barry up?
I'll bet he knows what to do about your eye."

961
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,661
So I give it a try, and he's wide-open.
He knows all about a macula pucker...

962
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,666
and he says,
"Have you ever heard of...

963
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,419
Dr. Ron A. Axe
in Nutley, New Jersey?"

964
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,709
"No, I can't say that I have."

965
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,585
"Well, he is the top nutritional
ophthalmologist in America.

00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,586
You should give him a call."

967
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,009
So I call Dr. Ron A. Axe's number...

968
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,344
and I get this wizened old voice.

969
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,726
I mean, I have nothing against
old people, but I don't know...

970
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,963
if a doctor should have
a receptionist quite this old.

971
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,473
It's like Tiresias.
It's androgynous.

972

if it's a man or a woman. It's...

You want to see who?

975

Dr. Axe is very busy.

976
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:03,534
You'll just have to take your chances
and c-come on out.

977
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,870
And come early,
because you're gonna have to fill out...

00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:10,333
an extensive dietary questionnaire.

"I am."

"you take the Port Authority

983
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,431
Hangs up. Nothing.
No appointment, no address.

984
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,180
But I think, "Hmm.

985
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,478
Sounds like an important journey...

986
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,069
and I should do
what the old voice said."

987
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,406
<i>So I take the bus out
from Port Authority to the Nutley Mall.</i>

988
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,692
Get off.
I turn left on Fay Street.

989
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,740
I don't notice anything.
I mean, it's <i>New Jersey.</i> It's a wasteland.

00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,373
Tract houses, no landscaping,
high-tension wires.

00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,834
Then I round the corner,
and - boom! - there it is.

992
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,580
Whoo! it's like Froot Loops.
It's like Hansel and Gretel's house on acid.

00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,589
It's like a Howard Finster dream.

All the shingles are
the color of the rainbow.

Day-Glo outlines
around the windows of the house.

996
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,764
The rocks the foundation is built from
are all the primary colors.

997
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,802
A bunch of fir trees over there
with a big sign that says...

1002
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:23,576
I hope it's not Dr. Ron A. Axe.
No, it's his brother, Don B. Axe.

1003
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,115
Brother and assistant. He jumps out
as though he's been hiding in there...

1004
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,659
waiting for me all day.

1005
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,380
Hops out and says, "Hello, Mr. Gray.
You are Mr. Gray, aren't you?

1006
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,916
Follow me. We're going to the sun porch
to fill out the dietary questionnaire."

1007
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,710
I follow him around, come into the sunporch.
I am overwhelmed.

1008
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,584
Quadraphonic opera is playing.
<i>Madame Butterfly,</i> full blast.

1009
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,506
On the wall are all these ski medals.

1010
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,971
To my right, a six-foot-high cutout
of Hoagy Carmichael.

1011
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,168
Over to the left,
these little miniature dinosaurs...

1012
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,471
playing in a miniature
prehistoric landscape.

1013
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,220
On the ceiling, floating,
four-foot-wide map of the moon...

1014
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,972
famed in a pink Hula hoop.

1015
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,617
To the left, the toothless head
of a Bengal tiger roaring at me.

1016
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,773
And spewing down the wall
like a yellow papering waterfall...

1017
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,364
is this 1964 original teletype printout...

1018
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,952
of Lyndon Johnson's acceptance speech
for the Democratic National Convention.

1019
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,946
And I'm looking around,
and Don says...

1020
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,119
"All this stuff makes you want to see,
doesn't it, Mr. Gray?

1021
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,835
Really activates the eyes.
Makes you want to look."

1022
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,795
"Yeah."

1023
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,789
<i>So he gets out
the dietary questionnaire.</i>

1024
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,258
It's 754 questions...

1025
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,128
concerning all the foods
I may have eaten in the past six months.

1026
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,130
And he's got all
the categories here -

1027
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,508
soups, meat, poultry, eggs, fish...

1028
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,636
seafood, dairy products, vegetables,
desserts, sweets, beverages...

1029
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,684
grains, breads, cereals, nuts,
seeds, legumes, fruits...

1030
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,935
spices, herbs, flavoring,
condiments, miscellaneous items.

1031
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,529
And he begins with "burrito."

1032
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:46,025
"All right, how many burritos
have you had in the past six months?"

1033
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,118
"Um-" Now, I've got
a photographic memory...

1034
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,704
and I can remember the Mexican restaurants,
but I can't remember what was on the plate.

1035
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,915
Was it a burrito? Was it a taco?
"All right, please.

1036
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,579
How many? Quickly, quickly."

1037
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,668
"Um... 18."

1038
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,210
"All right. Eighteen burritos.
Were they whole wheat or flour?"

1039
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,342
"Whole wheat?
I don't travel in those circles."

1040
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:06,713
"All right. Eighteen flour.
On to borscht, please. Borscht."

1041
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,052
"Borscht? I don't eat it or drink it
or whatever you do to it.

1042
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,346
Just forget it.
Wait a minute. Don't forget it.

1043
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,721
You've got me so confused. I don't have
an average six months in my life.

1044
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,894
Five months ago, I was in Russia.
I don't ever expect to be there again...

1045
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,650
but I was eating borscht every day."

1046
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,611
"How many days were you there?"
"I think it was a 14-day trip."

1047
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,322
"We'll put 16 in case you had
some for breakfast.

1048
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,113
On to hot dogs, hot dogs?"
"No hot dogs. Skip it.

1049
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,578
No. No, wait a minute.
No, no. Two months ago...

1050
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,579
I think it was,
I was in Columbus, Ohio...

1051
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,116
and just across from my bed-and-breakfast
there was this place called Coney Island.

1052
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,118
I'd go in every day,
and I'd order two -

1053
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,746
No, wait a minute. Those were wieners.
We'll wait till we get to W."

1054
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,165
And into the middle of this
comes the old voice.

1055
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,259
It's his 87-year-old mother
with these bottle-thick glasses...

1056
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,260
and a big babushka, saying...

1057
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,468
"Time to bring Mr. Gray in
to see Dr. Axe."

1058
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,263
"Stop it, Mother. Please. We have not
finished the dietary questionnaire."

1059
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,395
"Bring him into the antechamber, then.
Finish it there.

1060
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:59,516
Bring him in to the antechamber."

1061
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,608
"Antechamber"?

1062
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,233
<i>So into the antechamber we go.</i>

1063
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,857
Quadraphonic opera's playing
full blast in there.

1064
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,235
On the wall, the box
from the Metropolitan Opera.

1065
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,953
The general manager, Don,
used to sing for the Met...

1066
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,956
and after they tore it down,
somehow he salvaged the box...

1067
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,997
and it's up there, and it's got cutouts
of Toscanini and Caruso...

1068
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,541
black and white, six foot high,
staring down.

1069
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,632
Miniature Valkyries underneath.
Crossed sabers underneath.

On the ceiling -
map of the universe.

Christmas balls hanging down
and strings at different levels.

1072
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,719
And Don is saying to me,
"Rabbit. How many rabbits do you eat?

1073
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,013
Do you eat it with the skin on? Skin off?
Dark meat? Light meat?"

1074
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,262
I said, "No, no. No rabbits.
Renée won't let them in the house."

1075
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:40,356
Meanwhile, the mother is saying,
"Bring him in now. Skip it.

1076
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,648
Finish the dietary questionnaire later.

He refers to his examination chair
as an "electric chair." I don't know why.

1087
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,675
I get into the blue examination chair,
and he begins...

1088
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,436
- what I could only call a family slideshow.
<i>- [ Slide Projector Clicking ]</i>

1089
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,976
The first slide was
of he and his brother, Don...

1090
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,691
skiing down Mount Washington,
down Tuckerman's Ravine.

1091
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,568
Tucking down Tuckerman's.

skiing in Stowe, Vermont.

and his 87-year-old mother...

"Oh, yeah. Lenin's tomb.

That's where I was five months ago.
That's where I had the 16 borscht."

1098
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,538
Then something strange happened.

1099
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,540
Somehow -
I don't know how he did this -

1100
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,209
up into the left-hand corner
of the family slide...

1101
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,053
he fades an eye chart,
a traditional doctor's eye chart...

1102
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,681
and he says,
"Can you read this?"

1103
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,892
And I found I could.
I could read it better...

1104
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,052
than I could read it
in my Chinese doctor's office.

1105
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,896
I don't know why.
Maybe the family slideshow relaxed me.

1106
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,812
But I thought, "You know,
there's method in this man's <i>meshugaas.</i>

1107
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,561
I'm gonna let him examine my pucker."

1108
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,320
And he does.

1109
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,405
Looks at both eyes, then says...

1110
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,113
"Now, Mr. Gray,
I would just like to speculate...

1111
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,236

1112
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,331
"Oh. Causes. Great.
Maybe I'm not idiopathic after all.

"I'd just like to throw it out.

that can't assimilate ascorbic acid?

1122
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,704
So why would you be doing that -
pouring acid into your eye?

1123
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,103
Now, if it isn't the vitamin C,
it's the ozone layer.

1124
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,109
It's breaking down.
Sheep are going blind in New Zealand.

1125
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:52,112
I hope you're wearing a big broad-brimmed
hat and good thick sunglasses.

1126
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,275
Now, this is all speculation. You've got to
have a blood and urine workup...

1127
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,560
and then come back to me
as soon as you have that done.

1128
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,783
As for today, it's $240.
You go and pay my mother."

1129
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,450
I go and pay the mother $240.
No health insurance in that place.

1130
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,953
She's sitting there
with her babushka on, going...

1131
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,671
"Work, work, work.

1132
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,962
That's all my son does now
is work and research.

1133
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,095
He doesn't sleep.
I don't have a life.

1134
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,260
We don't even ski anymore.
I'm 87 years old...

1135
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,349
and I don't have a life!"

1136
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,269
<i>So I hand her the $240 check...</i>

1137
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,060
and I go out searching
for blood and urine analysis clinics.

1138
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,185
I'm going from New York to San Francisco.
Every clinic I go to...

1139
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,108
looks at the paperwork
and the technicians say...

1140
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,402
"We don't test human beings
for this stuff."

1141
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,525
So I don't know what to do.
I call Dr. Axe.

1142
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,869
He recommends a place
up in upstate New York.

1143
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,863
Maybe they're in cahoots.
I go up there.

1144
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,457
One thousand dollars they charge me.
No health insurance.

1145
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:48,293
They draw more blood from me
than I've ever had taken before.

1146
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,959
And then they give me this, like,
milk carton, you know, with a handle.

1147
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,333
Like, a cardboard box
to collect my urine for 24 hours.

1148
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,818
I'm carrying it around with me everywhere.
I'm ducking behind hedges in Central Park.

1149
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,631
I'm carrying it to therapy.
I got it at the theater between my legs.

1150
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,633
I'm traveling on the subway
with it between my legs...

1151
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,307
having made the mistake of eating
asparagus the night before.

1152
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,350
At last I get all the paperwork done.

1153
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:10,357
I bring in the report to Dr. Axe,
and he's reviewing it...

1154
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,351
and he looks down, and he says...

1155
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,025
"Here's your culprit: vanadium.

1156
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,364
Goes right off the chart."

1157
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,233
"Vanadium? What's that?"

1158
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,861
"A rare element used to toughen steel

1159
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,033
and make it more shock-resistant.

1160
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,532
In short, you're filled with heavy metal."

1161
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:30,453
"But where would it come from?
I mean, none of my friends have it."

1162
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,376
"Sea cucumbers and sea anemones."

1163
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,966
"But I never eat them.
I don't know anything about them."

1164
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,804
"No, but I bet you eat big fish, don't you?
I bet you're a fan of big fish."

1165
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,799
"Yes, I love to eat big fish.
I eat it any chance I get."

1166
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:46,124
"Well, that's where it comes from.
They eat the sea cucumbers and sea anemones...

1167
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,432
and it gets into their fatty tissue,
and you eat it.

1168
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,558
So you've got to give it up.
Got to give up all your big fish.

1169
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:55,061
Your swordfish, your salmon,
your tuna, your mahimahi.

1170
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,735
You've got to give up your shellfish,
crustaceans, lobsters...

1171
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,400
scallops and chicken and turkey."

1172
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,994
"Chicken and turkey?
But why chicken and turkey?"

1173
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,240
"Because they grind up big fish
and feed them to the chicken and turkey.

1174
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,083
You understand? Give it up.
Just eat raw vegetables.

1175
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,498
That's what you should do.
The only reason people cook vegetables...

1176
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,587
is 'cause in the old days,
people had wooden false teeth.

1177
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,958
Now you don't have to.
Eat it raw. You hear me?

1178
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,382
Raw! Raw! Raw!"

1179
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,552
Uh, to improve my eyesight,
go on an all-raw-vegetable diet?

1180
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:28,303
Uh, that'd be tough.
I don't think so.

1181
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,522
A raw-vegetable diet?

1182
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,687
Yeah. If it would
improve my sight, yeah.

1183
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,776
Well, yes, I think so.

1184
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:40,148
I like anything that has to do
with nutrition if I feel like it's valid...

1185
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:42,400
and something that
I would enjoy anyway.

1186
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,401
'Cause I already like vegetables.

1187
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:48,121
Oh, yes, because I happen to be
reading that right now...

1188
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,954
and I believe in totally -

1189
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,453
The raw vegetables is the only way
to get the live enzymes...

1190
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,089
and vitamins
out of fruits and vegetables.

1191
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,082
I think I would consider...

1192
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,256
going on an all-raw-vegetable diet...

1193
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,221
if the person giving me that pitch
was convincing enough, I think...

1194
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,762
and if I wouldn't have to
do that for too long.

1195
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,683
I don't think an all-raw-vegetable
diet is for me.

1196
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:15,603
I'm omnivorous,
and I really enjoy the meat in my diet...

1197
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:17,818
so no, I don't think I would.

1198
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,571
And he put the fear into me,
and I totally believed him...

1199
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,316
and I went on
a raw-vegetable diet.

1200
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:28,408
I went to the supermarket,
a place I thought used to have food.

1201
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,622
I mean, I look down the aisle,
I think...

1202
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:33,538
"Nothing there for me.
Nothing there for me. Nothing there -"

1203
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,536
I've never seen
so much nothing in my life.

1204
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,342
In the old days, when I'd shop,
I wouldn't even take a list with me.

1205
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,293
I would just take the cart,
go down the aisle...

1206
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,167
take whatever caught my eye -
my good eye -

1207
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,169
pop it into the wagon,
go down.

1208
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,467
Now I have to go
to the vegetable area. What is it?

1209
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,013
It's a bunch of vegetables being spritzed
with a [ imitates Spritzer] sprayer.

1210
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,395
It's supposed to make them look glossy.
In my opinion, it's waterlogging them.

1211
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:56,140
The celery's soggy.
I don't know where to go find vegetables.

1212
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,187
I go the farmers' market
in Manhattan...

1213
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,227
in Union Square
every Wednesday and Saturday...

1214
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:02,525
hoping I'll find
the Pennsylvania Dutch bringing in...

1215
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,694
some exotic turnips or something...

1216
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,109
and I see this sign that says...

1217
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,953
"Farm-raised trout
from the Catskills."

1218
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,664
I think, "Oh, boy.
There's a fish I could eat.

1219
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,783
Raised on a farm in the Catskills?

1220
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,536
Couldn't run into
any sea cucumbers up there."

1221
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,263
So I go over, I'm chatting the woman up.
There are three of them.

1222
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,215
She's wrapping them in newspaper.
I say...

1223
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:24,974
"Hey, by the way, I'm just curious -
what do you feed your trout?"

1224
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,717
She says, "Chicken."

1225
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,011
Also, I'd given up drinking alcohol.

1226
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,476
Went cold-turkey.
Just stopped, you know?

1227
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,141
I mean, after my mother's death,
the only religious ritual...

1228
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,356
left in our home
was cocktail hour.

1229
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,726
What's a day without cocktail hour?
It's just one big...

1230
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,611
[Grating Sound ]

1231
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,951
Bed!

1232
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:53,322
So I was on this raw-vegetable diet.
I'd given up pretty much everything:

1233
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,326
sugar, caffeine,
nicotine, alcohol, meat -

1234
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,623
and pretty much sex too,
'cause they're all interconnected.

1235
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:01,167
I hadn't realized that
until I gave all those up.

1236
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:05,259
And I got this raw-vegetable diet,
and it's causing enormous intestinal gas...

1237
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,511
and Renée and I are practically
breaking up over it.

1238
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,667
I'm getting real thin,
and Renée's mother sees me...

1239
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,053
and she says,
"Spalding, it looks like...

1240
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:15,178
you have just entered
the Bermuda Triangle of health."

1241
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,146
Renée's mother's got this theory that
this Bermuda Triangle of health...

1242
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,856
is between 50 and 53.

1243
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,814
That's when everything
starts happening to you.

1244
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,731
If you make it through,
you live to a ripe old age.

1245
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,446
She had a heart attack at 51.
She survived. She outlived it.

1246
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:29,484
Her husband, Renée's father -
mm, he died at 52. Didn't make it.

1247
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,781
My mom killed herself at 52.

1248
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,287
Renée's mother's brother
had a heart attack at 50.

1249
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,364
He made it through
the Bermuda Triangle of health.

1250
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:39,201
And I was in it,
and I was damn lonely.

1251
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,830
I'm saying to my doctor, "Please, show me
someone else that has a macular pucker."

1252
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:46,800
He tells me hundreds of people have them,
but he's not giving me any phone numbers.

1253
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:49,545
So I'm so lonely that I go down
to <i>The Village Voice</i> newspaper...

1254
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:53,014
and I put an ad in that says,
"Macular Pucker Club -

1255
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,225
Does anyone else have one?

1256
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,640
Let's share stories."

1257
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,684
And all I get is a letter from a guy...

1258
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,479
who wants to scrape me.

1259
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,898
Then the inevitable happened.
My Chinese doctor called me in...

1260
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,399
to have my eye examination.

1261
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,026
I didn't want to go, really.

1262
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,073
I just denied that it was
ever going to happen.

1263
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,538
I drag myself in. I sit there.

1264
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,659
I don't have a book anymore.
I'm just waiting for my pupils to dilate.

1265
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,829
I- I- I'm munching
on a sweet potato, I remember.

1266
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,747
And out of the nurses' office
comes this man...

1267
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,250
with a - oh, God, a drooping eye!

1268
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,503
It's worse than a bloodhound.
Worse than Elephant Man.

1269
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,595
I can't look at it.
I say, "Nurse, what was that?"

1270
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,682
She goes,
"Oh, Mr. Gray, that's the drooping eye."

1271
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,052
"I figured as much,
but where would it come from?"

1272
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,520
"Oh, sometimes it's a result
of the operation."

1273
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,477
"What? No one told me that!"

1274
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,474
"Oh, Mr. Gray, don't be a silly-billy.

1275
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,603
It's easily fixed
with corrective or plastic surgery."

1276
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,025

and talk to Trini Boca," I think.

1433
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,454
So I go down a half hour early,
and I tell him, "Please, please, Mr. Boca...

1434
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,793
when you finish operating
on the Japanese today...

1435
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:07,175
just wash your hands
in rubbing alcohol...

1436
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:11,263
come to my hotel room,
do a private operation with me, please?"

1437
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,929
[ Filipino Accent]
"No. We do not do the private here.

1438
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:18,178
Group only. No, no.
No private operation."

1439
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,307
"But you have to respect
my fear for AIDS.

1440
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,310
How would I totally relax and lie out
on a table and give over to you...

1441
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,186
if I have that fear in the way?"

1442
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:28,359
"There's no AIDS here.

1443
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,153
One man came.
He had the virus. Did not tell me.

1444
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,447
My hands,
they would not enter, they go...

1445
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:35,662
zoom!
[Gurgling ]

1446
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,911
No AIDS."

1447
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,003
I wanted to believe him.
I wanted to get on that table.

1448
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,167
"Where would I ever get the courage?"
I thought.

1449
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,504
And I thought,
"I will just get in with the Japanese.

1450
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,419
When they start moving,
they got that kamikaze energy.

1451
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,548
Up on that table. No doubt."

1452
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:58,176
<i>So I get in line with the Japanese
that are gonna be operated on.</i>

1453
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:01,931
They strip to their underwear. I'm stripping
to my red Fruit of the Loom jockey shorts.

1454
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:04,216
And I'm just standing there,
my knees shaking, waiting.

1455
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,856
And Trini comes,
he rolls up his sleeves.

1456
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:10,192
The Japanese woman from the day before
comes up, lies out on the table.

1457
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,907
He takes his hands
and drives them into her stomach.

1458
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:16,369
The blood shoots five feet into the air.
People start going around.

1459
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,201
It's my turn. I rush up.
I lie out on the table. I'm shaking.

1460
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:23,870
I look up and say, "Trini, remember,
it's just my eye. Just my left eye.

1461
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:27,710
Don't be pulling
any meatballs out of me, please."

1462
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,549
He raises his hands.
Shows me - nothing in them.

1463
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,544
He goes over,
he washes them off...

1464
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,798
in basically what looks like
a bucket of blood.

1465
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,242
Picks up the cotton gauze.
This is where the "debunk" is...

1466
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,469
like Amazing Randi says,
that they hide the blood pellets.

1467
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,938
But as if to show me, prove it to me,
opens it - nothing in them.

1468
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,057
Comes at me. Two fingers. Oop.

1469
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:49,319
All of a sudden, I feel this pressure.
His fingers are going in my eye.

1470
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,483
Blood is coming out.
I assume it's my blood.

1471
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,572
It doesn't feel like my blood,
though neither does a nosebleed...

1472
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,233
when it comes out of my nose.

1473
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,478
But it's coming down,
dripping over my other eye. Pop!

1474
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,787
Pulls his finger out.
No. Stops.

1475
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:03,329
I run, not to the back of the line
but to the men's room to look in the mirror.

1476
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,248
I'm looking at my eye, and there's
no blood leftover. What's going on?

1477
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,381
And I don't see any better.
And now all I can hear is my friends...

1478
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,499
back in Barrington,
Rhode Island, saying...

1479
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,753
"Say you went to a guy
who started pulling meatballs...

1480
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,967
out of you the size of melons.

1481
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,841
Would you go to a doctor then?"

1482
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:21,388
"Yes!

1483
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,185
Yes!

1484
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,388
Yes!"

1485
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:29,438
At first, I really thought that
this gentleman was just an actor...

1486
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,483
and that he would try
to memorize...

1487
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,903
or let's say just be able to give
his lines in a certain way.

1488
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:39,527
But he was so very good at it,
and he was so very knowledgeable, really...

1489
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,654
when it came
to some of the medical terms...

1490
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,282
and I guess
he became so believable...

1491
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:48,249
that I really wanted to question
whether it was fiction or it was for real.

1492
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,122
Well, I just thought that...

1493
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,421
the methods he chose,
the alternative methods...

1494
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:57,216
including the sweat box...

1495
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:00,431
the psychic Philippine person...

1496
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:04,052
and the raw vegetables -
they were just so extreme.

1497
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:08,933
I didn't think anybody would go
through those extremes to, uh...

1498
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,944
you know,
to treat an eye problem.

1499
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:17,156
And he obviously is
a very intelligent person.

1500
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,988
He's very neurotic.

1501
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,406
I think he certainly
takes things to extreme...

1502
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:25,122
and I'm not sure I agree
with his thought process about everything...

1503
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,334
but I really was surprised...

1504
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,087
that it really was -
He was the patient. Mm-hmm.

1505
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:35,334
I think he was kind of humorous.
I really do. it's kind of, um...

1506
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,460
more New Yorker style, I guess.

1507
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,348
I think he would be
a very pleasant person...

1508
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,511
but I don't know if I could...

1509
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,519
relate to him quite as easily.

1510
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:50,516
I think he would be a challenge,
and I think he'd be somebody...

1511
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,315
that you would find it
challenging to consult...

1512
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,985
but I certainly would advise him...

1513
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:01,826
some of these alternative therapies
that he should not do.

1514
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,287
And I think I probably would
spend more time...

1515
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,405
just trying to reassure him...

1516
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:10,206
that this condition does have
a fairly good prognosis...

1517
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,001
and that he should've done this
earlier rather than later. Mm-hmm.

1518
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:17,250
So I get back to New York City,
sure that I'm gonna have the operation.

1519
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,252
When I get back, I'm not so sure.

1520
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,880
The nurse calls, says I should come in.
The doctor wants to see me.

1521
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,881
He's heard I've been
to the Philippines.

1522
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,555
They want to do
a kind of preoperative exam.

1523
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,304
I don't have to get the operation.
It's my choice, right?

1524
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,022
Also, they say, "Come in on Friday.
It's a half day.

1525
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,358
There won't be anyone
in the waiting room."

1526
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,570
So that's a temptation,
and I do come in.

1527
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,065
No one's there.
I'm getting my pupils dilated.

1528
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,783
I have no book.
I'm doing my dilation meditation...

1529
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,949
kind of fuzzing out there,
and I look down the corridor...

1530
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:50,075
and I see this guy backing out
of my doctor's office.

1531
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,543
And he's kind of waving
as he's backing up.

1532
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,334
And it's like an old-time movie.
It's like a Buster Keaton movie.

1533
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,207
And he turns,
and he's walking toward me...

1534
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,381
and I realize he has
one of those rubber Nixon masks on...

1535
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,925
the kind you'd buy in a joke shop
when Nixon was president.

1536
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,890
And I think,
"What's going on here? A robbery?"

1537
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,227
He turns, he's coming toward me,
and I realize...

1538
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:12,096
"Wait a minute.
It <i>is</i> Richard Nixon."

1539
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,391
And he's walking toward me
with intent...

1540
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,609
as if he's gonna say, "Hello.

1541
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:19,771
I saw <i>Swimming to Cambodia,</i>
and I loved it."

1542
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:23,400
And then I think, "Wait a minute.
Maybe his pupils are dilated...

1543
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,243
and he thinks I'm Ralph Lauren."

1544
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:30,365
He walks up. I look up. I just say,
"Oh, hi," and he walks out.

1545
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,787
But you know, the strange part is...

1546
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,349
seeing Richard Nixon come out
of my doctor's office gave me...

1547
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,415
the faith, the hope, and the courage
to have that operation.

1548
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:43,257
<i>I don't know if I could've done the operation
if Renée wasn't holding my hand.</i>

1549
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,630
<i>- [ Monitor Beeping ]
- I was terrified</i>

1550
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,266
They gave me a local anesthetic,
so I could hear everything that was going on.

1551
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,683
The doctors were talking about some party
they'd had the night before.

1552
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,976
While they were peeling me,
they were talking about a party.

1553
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,815
Very nonchalant.

1554
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,935
The radio was playing
rock and roll, I remember -

1555
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,030
Elton John, "Crocodile Rock."

1556
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,695
When I came to,
I had a patch over my left eye.

1557
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,783
And they put a gas bubble in there...

1558
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,903
in my eye,
to prevent glaucoma.

1559
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,905
I'm glad I didn't know
they were gonna do that.

1560
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,330
Turned out I couldn't raise my head at all,
'cause it would break the bubble.

1561
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:17,416
Oh, and the doctor gave me
a videotape of the operation.

1562
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:20,460
He titled it
<i>Swimming to Macula Pucker.</i>

1563
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,549
Had a sense of humor.

1564
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:25,796
I get home, I couldn't raise my head.
I had to sleep facedown.

1565
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,161
Renée put pillows on either side
so I couldn't roll over.

1566
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,512
I had to eat facedown.
I had to walk. I remember-

1567
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:33,144
Oh, I joined the Library for the Blind.
I could get books on tape.

1568
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,558
And I remember Renée
guiding me up with my head down...

1569
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,729
looking at chewing gum,
cigarette butts...

1570
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,851
graffiti, dog shit.

1571
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:44,572
I get up and rented
<i>The Miracle Worker,</i> I remember.

1572
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,330
And when I got back, Renée did
this ingenious thing with mirrors...

1573
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,819
so that I could see
the videotape of the operation.

1574
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,868
She arranged mirrors
so I could see the monitor.

1575
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,249
And... oh, whoa!

1576
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:58,870
What a video! I mean, you talk
about Philippine psychic surgeons.

1577
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:02,415
Here's a close-up of my macula.
It was magnified, so it looked like Mars.

1578
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:06,135
It was very yellow, and the veins and
capillaries looked like the rivers on Mars.

1579
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,550
And then into the frame
you see this little pincer come...

1580
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,800
just like a little crab claw,
and begin to pick at the edema.

1581
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,677
And it's coming off the retina
like gossamer threads.

1582
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:17,180
I mean, never touching
the retina once.

1583
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,227
Just off and up
until we're in whiteout.

1584
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,893
I don't know where we are.
Renée's in the bathroom by now.

1585
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:25,154
And I see stitches
the size of ropes...

1586
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,740
and I realize
they're sewing up my left eye.

1587
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:30,076
It's like - whew! -
<i>The Andalusian Dog</i>

1588
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:31,952
magnified a hundred times.

1589
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,288
I'm just thinking,
"This is just a movie.

1590
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:38,785
That's not my eye.
This is just a movie."

1591
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,788
And after 14 days, it was time
to have the patch removed.

1592
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:44,756
Renée and I went
to the doctor's office.

1593
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:48,761
He took the patch off,
and basically it was not great.

1594
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:52,098
It was like looking through the bottom
of an empty Coke bottle.

1595
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,808
Real fuzzy.
Also, it was a cockeyed feeling...

1596
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,144
like I had this white hair
between my eyes...

1597
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:00,561
that just needed to be brushed,
but I couldn't find it to brush.

1598
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:02,962
And we went out and sat
on a park bench in Central Park...

1599
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:05,858
and I looked across the park,
and in the distance I saw...

1600
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,481
leaves blowing in the wind,
a bunch of children running...

1601
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:12,782
a red ball rolling,
a flock of starlings taking off.

1602
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:16,288
I covered my right eye.
No leaves.

1603
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,121
Blur of children.
Blotch of red.

1604
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,160
No birds.

1605
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:24,289
Covered my left -
ah, ecstasy.

1606
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,666
Covered my right -

1607
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,794
despair.

1608
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,671
Ecstasy.

1609
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,178
Despair.

1610
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,472
And I realized at that moment
that I was now living...

1611
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,809
the perfect yin-and-yang existence.

1612
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,104
And Renée and I went home,
and I ate big fish...

1613
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,570
and I drank a bottle of wine,
and I smoked a cigar.

1614
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,064
And I ate and I drank
and I smoked...

1615
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,988
everything that could make me blind.

1616
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:56,370
