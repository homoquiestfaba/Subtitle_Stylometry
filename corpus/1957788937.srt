1
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,176
Oh, not today, asshole.

2
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,620
<i>...your neck areas
and all that kind of stuff...</i>

3
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:00,420
You're killing me, Karen.

4
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,522
Goddamn.

5
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,661
No, don't do it agai...

6
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,529
He's just gonna
cheat on you again.

7
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,230
Ugh.

8
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,299
You never listen.

9
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,770
She never listens.

10
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,149
Please. Come on.

11
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,786
Jordan Tyler is a hack.

12
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,222
The guy doesn't even
write his own music.

13
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:54,742
Today's the day.

14
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,645
I can feel it.

15
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,516
I can do this.

16
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,619
Today's the day.

17
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:06,854
I can feel it.

18
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:11,425
I can do this.
It's gonna be today.

19
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:13,828
Oh, yes.

20
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:16,764
I can do this, right?

21
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,735
Yeah. Yeah. I can do this.

22
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,838
I can do this. I'm gonna leave,

23
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,305
I'm gonna leave,
I'm gonna leave,

24
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,406
I'm gonna...

25
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,317
Hello?

26
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:41,823
Hello? Mr. Williams?

27
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,425
I have some deliveries for you!

28
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,797
You're supposed to
leave them at the door.

29
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,265
Oh.

30
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,434
Sorry! I'm new.

31
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,794
Left specific instructions...

32
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,701
I left specific instructions.

33
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,772
You just leave...

34
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,841
...the groceries by the door.

35
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,003
<i>Your fearless leader, Becky.</i>

36
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,971
<i>Now, for my serious face.</i>

37
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,776
<i>It's been five years
since the genius</i>

38
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,345
<i>that is Tucker Stills
was taken from us.</i>

39
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,381
<i>Five years.</i>

40
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,018
<i>Now,
this groundbreaking musician</i>

41
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,720
<i>deserves a second chance, right?</i>

42
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,657
<i>Right. So a group of us
most dedicated fans...</i>

43
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,126
<i>You know who you are...
Have made it our mission</i>

44
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:28,029
<i>to find him
and return him to his music,</i>

45
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,398
<i>for us, for him,
for the world, okay?</i>

46
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,135
<i>So if you've seen anything,
if you know anything,</i>

47
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,437
<i>if you know anyone who's seen
anything or knows anything,</i>

48
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,674
<i>DM me. And in the meantime,</i>

49
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,743
<i>don't forget to like,
comment, and subscribe.</i>

50
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,645
<i>Calm down, Benji.</i>

51
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,647
How the fuck are you
gonna tell me to calm down?

52
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,749
They're looking for me
out there.

53
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,952
<i>I can tell you
no one will find you.</i>

54
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,987
<i>You're safe.
Just take a deep breath.</i>

55
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,057
You think I'm paranoid.

56
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,159
<i>I think you had
a very traumatic experience</i>

57
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,161
<i>a few years ago,
and you're still dealing</i>

58
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,606
<i>- with the fallout from that.</i>
- Traumatic's an understatement.

59
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,898
I lost my mind.

60
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,634
<i>Well, that's a little extreme.</i>

61
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,670
The breakdown
in the Chinese restaurant?

62
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,573
<i>- Right.</i>
- Attacking that photographer?

63
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,709
- <i>Yes...</i>
- Freezing on stage?

64
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,144
<i>Okay, I get it.
Not your finest moments,</i>

65
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,614
<i>but you shouldn't
dwell on any of that.</i>

66
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,182
Easy for you to say.

67
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,017
<i>You're a very
sensitive, anxious,</i>

68
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,451
<i>and private person, Benji.</i>

69
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,087
<i>Fame was not made for you.</i>

70
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,664
<i>You need to forgive
yourself for everything</i>

71
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,757
<i>- that happened that year.</i>
- I have.

72
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,692
<i>But you still
haven't left the house.</i>

73
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,060
Hey, I can forgive myself

74
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:35,196
and still wanna stay safe
in my own home.

75
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,898
<i>It's not healthy, Benji.</i>

76
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:38,766
Who are you to tell me
what's healthy?

77
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,669
<i>A doctor. Your doctor?</i>

78
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,572
I mean, the real world sucks.

79
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,941
Why would I wanna leave
my personal bubble anyway?

80
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:50,811
<i>To live.
To grow, to socialize.</i>

81
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,514
You realize I hear sirens
outside my window every night?

82
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,150
<i>- You live next to a hospital.</i>
- It's dangerous out there.

83
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,656
<i>Go answer the door, Benji.</i>

84
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,758
Wasn't the door.
Something just fell.

85
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,962
<i>Confront the door, Benji.</i>

86
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,063
Oh, God.

87
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,981
You know I can hear you on the
other side of the door, right?

88
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:41,162
Oh-kay. Well, uh,
I'm your new neighbor, Sylvia.

89
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,197
That's my name.
Which was obvious.

90
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,699
I didn't need to say that.

91
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,168
Anyway, I'm bringing you
a welcome basket,

92
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:50,104
um, which, technically,
you should be bringing to me.

93
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,139
But I'm kind of weird!

94
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:53,473
But not in a bad way.

95
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,710
Not in a good way either.

96
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,180
People don't generally like me.
I'm a lot.

97
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,583
Okay,
I'm gonna stop talking now.

98
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:07,021
Oh, okay. Uh, enjoy the basket!

99
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,546
Aw.
Well, that was sweet of her.

100
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,281
Jesus!

101
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,051
How the hell
did you get in here?

102
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,621
Well, technically,
I'm not really here.

103
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,824
I'm more in here.

104
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,860
What the fuck does that mean?

105
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,862
Short version? Psychotic break.

106
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,097
I'm not buying that.
Try again.

107
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,733
Fine. You wanna go there?

108
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,169
I'll tell you
a little bit about yourself.

109
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:59,240
Hmm. Where to start?

110
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,543
Please don't touch that.

111
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,246
Your dad was an abusive drunk,

112
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,815
but your mom tried
to shield you from him,

113
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,317
which makes you feel so guilty.

114
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,888
You even wrote
your first song for your mom

115
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,756
after your dad beat her bloody.

116
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,658
Stop.

117
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,628
You wet the bed
until you were 14

118
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,630
because of your
massive anxiety issues.

119
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,298
I said you can stop now.

120
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,967
Your first kiss resulted in
you throwing up on her after

121
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,637
because you were so nervous.

122
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,205
I said you can fucking stop now.

123
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,673
Your middle name is Connor.

124
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,209
Your first pet was
a dog named Wiggles.

125
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:39,013
And your greatest fear is...

126
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,615
well, everything.

127
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,716
Did I leave anything out?

128
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:52,726
Oh, no. No. Oh, no.

129
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,729
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

130
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,165
How?

131
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,667
Magic.

132
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:02,970
I've really lost it now,
haven't I?

133
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:05,206
You've never had it, dude.

134
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,777
Are you supposed to be me?

135
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,746
- Do I fucking look like you?
- No, like, are you supposed to

136
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,316
be some sort of manifestation
of me or something, somehow?

137
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,819
Wow. This is why
you failed Psych 101.

138
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:23,124
Hey, you can't
smoke that in here, dude.

139
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,059
I'm in your head.

140
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,962
Fuck. This can't be real.

141
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,997
Define real.

142
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,270
- Jesus! What the fuck, dude?
- You don't have any ashtrays.

143
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,872
That's my mom, asshole.

144
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,874
Yeah, I know.

145
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,409
Hey, Debbie. How's it hangin'?

146
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,247
- Get out.
- You first.

147
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:48,048
No. Fuck this.

148
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,751
I'm just hallucinating.
Too much Red Bull.

149
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:51,852
No such thing.

150
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,156
I just need some sleep.

151
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:56,824
You'll be gone in the morning.

152
00:10:58,826 --> 00:10:59,894
See you tomorrow.

153
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,669
No.

154
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,389
Morning, Mom.

155
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,991
Sorry about last night.

156
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,110
Wow, you are a mess.

157
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:28,449
- What the fuck, dude?
- Is this all true?

158
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:32,253
Can you... can you
even be going to the bathroom?

159
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,822
Anything you can do,
I can do better.

160
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,466
Ugh. You know what,
I did not need to hear that.

161
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,758
Wait... wait a minute.

162
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,928
- Where'd you get that?
- Your closet.

163
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,164
I... Just... How can you
even be holding that?

164
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,244
Yeah, I don't get the question.

165
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,469
You're not even real.

166
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,437
Oh, I'm very fucking real.

167
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,373
You know what?
Fine. Just...

168
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,576
Can you let me
finish my shower in peace?

169
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:56,176
I'm not done yet.

170
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,182
How is... how is
that even possible?

171
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,286
Well, you see,
when you eat food,

172
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,863
- the digestive system starts...
- Oh, fine.

173
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,164
You know what,
just shut up, okay?

174
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,823
Just shut up. All right?

175
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:12,326
Just let me finish
my shower in peace, please?

176
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:17,197
Wow. So they actually
had to drag you off stage

177
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:18,399
at that awards show?

178
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,539
Oh, my God.

179
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,453
Don't sweat.

180
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,489
You think it's hot enough
out for me to ditch the shirt?

181
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:45,025
- Could I stop you?
- I mean, you could try.

182
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,361
Well,
you do love to show off, so...

183
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,096
Hey, I put in the work.

184
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,541
I might as well
get some validation from it.

185
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,266
I already give you
too much validation.

186
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,134
- There's no such thing.
- Uh-huh.

187
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:57,037
- Once around the park?
- Yeah. Loser buys dinner!

188
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,138
Hey!

189
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,239
Come back here!

190
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,110
That's not super
creepy stalker-y or anything.

191
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,278
Fuck.

192
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,391
Good to see you too, buddy.

193
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,983
Can't get rid of you, can I?

194
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,620
I'm like a bad kisser,
or herpes.

195
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,564
Okay.

196
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,966
There's one thing
that's been bothering me.

197
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,001
- One thing?
- Fuck you.

198
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:32,473
How did you know about the song
that I wrote for my mother?

199
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,644
Do we have to
go over this again?

200
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,045
I know what you know.

201
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,914
Yeah,
but I didn't even remember it

202
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,517
until you mentioned it.

203
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,260
That's because I have
access to parts of your brain

204
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,553
that even you don't know about.

205
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:49,189
- That's scary.
- You're tellin' me.

206
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:53,227
Your subconscious is
starting to look like a...

207
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,930
- never-ending warehouse.
- Fuck you.

208
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,432
It's gonna get old quick.

209
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,401
What do I have to do
to get rid of you?

210
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,069
I leave when you leave.

211
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:03,971
What the fuck does that mean?

212
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,607
It's not
a fucking coded message.

213
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,509
I'm here because
you're a lonely bastard.

214
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:10,144
Leave the house,
get a life, and then I'm gone.

215
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,112
That is not going to happen.

216
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:14,582
There has to be another way.

217
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:19,052
Hey, this is your show.
I'm just along for the ride.

218
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:24,992
You're right.

219
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,995
I'm in charge.

220
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,534
If I just ignore him,
he'll go away.

221
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,271
Don't talk about me
like I'm not here.

222
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,528
I know you know this one, buddy.

223
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,763
Jump in at any time.

224
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,084
Okay, this one's pretty simple.
Go to the right.

225
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,553
Get to the right. Right,
right, right, right, right.

226
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,187
Get on the... The guy on
the right, get the guy...

227
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,747
No, right.
That's the le... No, no, no.

228
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,492
That's the left, go to
the right. Get to the right.

229
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,216
Is this your first day playing?

230
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,628
You look like
you have a lot of stars,

231
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:59,353
so play this game right...

232
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,488
Don't be a baby.
You're not... you're not done.

233
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,123
This is fucking dumb.

234
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,026
Okay.

235
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,131
Your controller's dead.

236
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,800
That's why you suck.

237
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:20,775
Leave.

238
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:24,546
Don't smile at me. Leave.
You saw her work out.

239
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:27,180
You getting your
summer bod ready?

240
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,050
Looking fit,
looking hot to leave the house?

241
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,085
Deb want you to leave.

242
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,222
Don't get mad at me.
You're doing sit-ups.

243
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,468
Good morning, sunshine.

244
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:55,208
You realize this doesn't count
as human interaction, right?

245
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:07,655
So, how did you
get those chopsticks

246
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,624
to stick into that dude's leg?

247
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:13,795
It's an honest question.

248
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,866
Come on. I can do this.

249
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,167
Here we go.

250
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,202
Okay. If I leave, he leaves.

251
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,339
Are you talking
to yourself again?

252
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,421
Yes!

253
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,598
Did you miss me?

254
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:26,768
- Oh, no.
- No? Okay.

255
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:28,636
Aww.

256
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:30,772
You should.

257
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,343
Rude.

258
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,663
Just because there's
no room in there for me

259
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,522
doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop trying.

260
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:56,664
Hey, someone's here.

261
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:58,365
I don't care.

262
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,536
But what if it's your neighbor?

263
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:16,918
Mmm. Grumpy.

264
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:29,597
Hey, can I borrow
that screwdriver I gave you?

265
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,498
I made the mistake
of buying IKEA furniture,

266
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:34,301
and now I'm playing this big
ol' game of Tetris.

267
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:42,309
Hey! Ah... Oh, sorry.
I'll back up.

268
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,382
There you are!

269
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,294
You know, I was starting to
think this place was haunted,

270
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,654
and I don't do well
with creepy neighbors.

271
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,324
Thanks.

272
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,927
- Benji.
- Benji!

273
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,696
Nice to meet you, Benji.

274
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,766
You too.

275
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,339
You need to say more than

276
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,841
three words to her next time.

277
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,519
What makes you think
there will be a next time?

278
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,044
Oh, she'll be back.

279
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,313
There are six things
left in the basket.

280
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,317
You need to get rid of her.

281
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:02,389
Look at all of the dust
that she's spreading.

282
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:06,359
She's an ash whore.

283
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:09,730
Yeah, please don't refer to
my dead mother as a whore.

284
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:13,734
Fuckin' shit.

285
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,043
Ooh, that looks expensive.

286
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:23,678
Please don't touch that.

287
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:26,747
I said don't touch that.

288
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:28,749
When was
the last time you played?

289
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,027
- No, no, no. Wait.
- Stop. Stop, stop.

290
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:31,919
- No, no, whoa, no.
- Put it down.

291
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:33,420
I will not put this down.

292
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,457
Oh, God.

293
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:44,866
That's not right.

294
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:50,571
If you're supposed to
be me, why do you suck so much?

295
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,372
That's rude.

296
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,010
I've always wanted
to be a rock star.

297
00:22:56,677 --> 00:23:00,514
Have you ever smashed
one of these on stage?

298
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:02,917
Stop. Dude, what the fuck's
the matter with you?

299
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,752
It's good to see
a guitar in your hands again.

300
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:05,853
How does it feel?

301
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:09,924
You know, you're a manipulative
little asshole, you know that?

302
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:14,427
I said,
"How does it feel?"

303
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:22,603
Good.

304
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:24,639
I will make you a deal.

305
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,874
I'll leave you alone
for the rest of the day

306
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,076
if you play me a little bit.

307
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,012
It doesn't even have to be
one of your songs.

308
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,090
I'm trying my hardest, okay?

309
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:19,226
It's not an easy situation.
It'll happen when it happens.

310
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:22,863
You're supposed to be my friend.

311
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,845
What am I gonna do
about her, Mom?

312
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,600
It's been two weeks
since you've seen Sylvia.

313
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,159
When are you gonna
come up with a plan?

314
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:53,794
Over. Let it go.

315
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:56,197
It never even started.

316
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,934
You know,
can you not be a dick tonight?

317
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:02,970
I feel bad enough
without you psychoanalyzing me.

318
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:04,271
Then do something about it.

319
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,273
She has a boyfriend.

320
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:08,009
Doesn't mean
you can't take your shot.

321
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,278
I mean,
even if I did do something,

322
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,614
I can't even leave the house.

323
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,125
What kind of life
would that be for her?

324
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,084
Maybe she's worth
leaving the apartment for.

325
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:18,853
Please.

326
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:20,230
If I didn't leave the apartment
to get rid of you,

327
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:22,089
nothing's gonna blast me
out of this place.

328
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:25,126
Wow.
You are such a fucking coward.

329
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,727
Just leave me the fuck alone!

330
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,596
Sure, right after you grow up

331
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,607
and realize that your fear
does not come from out there.

332
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:31,899
It comes from in here.

333
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,201
You know nothing about my fear.

334
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:36,904
Seriously?
I literally live in your head.

335
00:25:37,438 --> 00:25:39,173
Feel free to leave at any time.

336
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:42,043
Why? Because I'm making you
face your shitty life?

337
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,944
Hey, I didn't have
a shitty life, okay?

338
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:45,913
My life was fine
before you showed up.

339
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:50,284
Really? Is that why you cry
yourself to sleep every night?

340
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:53,320
- Shut the fuck up.
- You don't have a life.

341
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:54,922
You have a coping mechanism.

342
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:56,357
- Shut up.
- You just can't admit

343
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,292
- to yourself that you're...
- Shut up!

344
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:00,594
- ...a fucking coward.
- Shut up! Shut up!

345
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,983
Hey, it's Sylvia. Are you okay?

346
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,986
Yeah, I'm fine.

347
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,801
Okay, great. Can you open
your door so I can make sure

348
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:32,069
someone's not
holding a gun to your head

349
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:33,294
and making you say that?

350
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,932
Benji,
I have dialed nine and one.

351
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:40,034
You cough if you want me
to hit that last one.

352
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,006
Okay.

353
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,275
All right. no visible cuts
or bruises, that's good.

354
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:55,249
Um. I'm sorry, I was just
having a bit of an argument.

355
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:56,917
With...

356
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:00,688
Oh, uh, my... my dad.

357
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,824
Ooh, yeah.
Parents are the worst, right?

358
00:27:03,858 --> 00:27:05,235
My mom is always
texting me pictures

359
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,670
of her friends' grandkids,
and I'm like,

360
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:08,929
"I get it, Mom, back off."

361
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,364
Right.

362
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:17,371
You don't talk much, do you?

363
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,408
N... No, I... I don't.

364
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:22,743
It shows.

365
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:29,984
I'm... I... I don't...

366
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:32,353
I don't really
leave the house much.

367
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,122
I think... I'm sorry, that's not
something you need to know.

368
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:36,867
No, no, that's okay.
That sounds really rough.

369
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,159
Is there a reason?

370
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:41,195
It's a tough world out there.

371
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,332
Yeah. I get that.

372
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,373
So, where's my welcome basket?

373
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:56,076
Oh. Yeah, right.
Um, sorry. Let me go get that.

374
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,344
No, no, I meant, um,

375
00:27:57,945 --> 00:27:59,747
why haven't you made me one yet?

376
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,283
Oh, right. Um, yeah.

377
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,919
Uh, I... I can do that.

378
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:06,720
Uh, it's just, um,

379
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:09,123
I... I...

380
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:12,159
What should I put in it?

381
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,761
Surprise me.

382
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:15,162
I don't really like surprises.

383
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,463
Well, lucky for you, I do.

384
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:20,467
Well, it was good
to see you again, Benji.

385
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,737
Yeah,
it was good to see you too.

386
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:30,177
It wasn't that bad.

387
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,179
You'll do better next time.

388
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:41,789
What the fuck, dude?

389
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,091
It worked, didn't it?

390
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,092
Any ideas?

391
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,039
What the fuck am I gonna
put in this thing?

392
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,122
Hey, dude?

393
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:51,292
Where'd you go?

394
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:54,395
Ah, fu...

395
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,231
Look, buddy,
I need your help, okay?

396
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:04,905
Fine. I need you, man. Lo...

397
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:07,975
You're the best ghost
or imaginary friend

398
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:10,578
or whatever
I've... I've ever had.

399
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,515
Can you please help me?

400
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:17,484
I need you, man.

401
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:21,355
Can't leave me now.

402
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,493
Fuck.
It took you long enough. Shit.

403
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:28,530
What the fuck, dude?
Where have you been?

404
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:29,930
Oh, you miss me?

405
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:33,934
You didn't hear
any of that, did you?

406
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,904
How could I?
I was chillin' in the fridge.

407
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:43,410
Thanks, man.

408
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:46,413
Any time.

409
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:52,986
Okay. Basket time.

410
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:54,455
Basket time.

411
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,424
Gonna get a Red Bull first.

412
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,394
- She deserves a big one.
- Good shit.

413
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:02,262
- Get the gummies.
- You know what else?

414
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:03,665
Gummy bears.

415
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:05,099
You have good ideas, don't you?

416
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,167
- Nope.
- Here you go.

417
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,203
Obviously no.

418
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:13,273
Good call. It's cute.

419
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:14,942
A fork!

420
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:31,258
- The <i>crème de la crme.</i>
- Ah!

421
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,037
Good.

422
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,365
You know what the last thing
you need to add is, right?

423
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:49,243
- What?
- Music.

424
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:51,044
Music is your way
of communicating.

425
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,246
You need to make her a mix.

426
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,581
Of what?

427
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:56,551
Your favorite songs, dumb-ass.

428
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,464
And there needs to be
a Tucker Still song on it.

429
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:01,088
No, I... I can't.

430
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,390
It's the best way
for her to get to know you.

431
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:07,428
- But then she'll know.
- She knows you as Benji.

432
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,063
That's not a far leap.

433
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,498
For you.

434
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,213
But for her,
she'll never even have a clue.

435
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:15,202
I mean...

436
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:20,274
- Fine.
- Great.

437
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,087
Okay.

438
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:12,292
It's been an hour.

439
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,562
You need to do this.

440
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:18,332
I don't do too well
leaving the apartment.

441
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,671
It's across the fucking hallway.

442
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:26,240
And we watched her leave
a half an hour ago,

443
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:27,742
so she's not even home.

444
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:32,379
So you don't need to try to
string any words together.

445
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:37,117
Okay.

446
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,320
Okay.
It's across the hall.

447
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:41,599
- It's across the hall.
- It's across the hall.

448
00:33:41,623 --> 00:33:42,690
Please hurry up.

449
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,605
Why the fuck
did you just hold your breath?

450
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,408
I don't know.

451
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,244
I... I don't know.

452
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:06,146
Dude, you got issues.

453
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:10,752
Okay, now that you're a little
less hostile towards me,

454
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:12,705
I was wondering if we were
gonna talk about this.

455
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,490
Nope.

456
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:21,128
Okay.

457
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:40,113
Nice!

458
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:46,554
Um, so, what do you do
for... for like, a living?

459
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:48,388
Um, I'm a bartender.

460
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:50,858
What about you?

461
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,227
Oh, um, uh,
it's kind of complicating.

462
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:55,730
Um, I mean...

463
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,833
I mean, I'm kind of a writer.

464
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,369
Oh. Uh, nice.

465
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,470
Like, books?

466
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,174
No. Um, more like
websites and stuff.

467
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:10,612
Nice.
Anything I would have seen?

468
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:12,647
No.

469
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:14,716
It's all pretty generic stuff.

470
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,454
Oh, so close.

471
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:23,825
Favorite color?

472
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:26,828
Uh, blue.

473
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,801
Iceland.

474
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:37,237
Drunken pickle ball.

475
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:39,674
A penguin in a suit.

476
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:44,411
Naked jumping jacks.

477
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:48,415
Lighting a candle underwater.

478
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,722
Um, who's that guy that's...

479
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,592
who's always over
at your apartment?

480
00:35:58,191 --> 00:35:59,894
You mean my brother Daniel?

481
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:05,667
Ohh. He's your brother.

482
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,934
Yeah, he is.

483
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:10,705
He's had a really rough
go of it, actually. He, um...

484
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,340
Well, my parents
kicked him out of the house

485
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:14,942
when he came out when he was 15,

486
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,879
and I said,
"If Daniel goes, I go."

487
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:21,549
And my parents never
really liked me that much.

488
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:22,960
You know,
I was always annoying them,

489
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:25,252
so, no argument there.

490
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:27,387
So we left.

491
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:31,826
Um, that sucks.
I'm... I'm sorry.

492
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,293
It did, for a while.

493
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:37,230
But it was kind of nice
having our freedom, you know?

494
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:40,200
And Daniel's always stood by me.

495
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:44,438
He's the only one that can
tolerate my extra-ness.

496
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:56,784
Biggest accomplishment?

497
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:59,620
- Platinum record!
- Oh, um, being able to survive

498
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:03,423
in the house for so long
without, um, going crazy.

499
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:11,899
Not quite.

500
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:17,705
Do you have any friends?

501
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:19,707
Uh...

502
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:23,578
No, not... not really.

503
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:26,681
Well, you do now.

504
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:32,653
That is, until I annoy you
into ghosting me.

505
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:41,562
So have you really not left
the apartment in five years?

506
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,966
Um... Yeah.

507
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:47,987
It doesn't feel
that long, though.

508
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,937
It never does, right?

509
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:52,372
When one day just kinda
blends into the next.

510
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:54,842
You make it sound so depressing.

511
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,544
Isn't it?

512
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:58,679
Sometimes.

513
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:01,616
Sometimes, though,
it can feel safe.

514
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,718
It can feel warm.

515
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:07,655
You know, I'm most creative
when I'm by myself.

516
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:09,456
Well, what kind of
creative stuff do you do?

517
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:15,462
Uh, usually just, um, you know,
just writing, stuff like that.

518
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:20,034
So, what do you do...

519
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:22,837
for, like, fun?

520
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:26,641
Wait here.

521
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:43,891
Um...

522
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,761
Is this supposed to be

523
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,663
some sort of magic trick
or something?

524
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:50,832
No. Better.

525
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,805
- Hmm.
- Okay.

526
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:01,843
Aces or wild?

527
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,092
That looked like fun.

528
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:21,494
It really was.

529
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,665
So, are you gonna ask her out?

530
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,635
Isn't that what we just did?

531
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:29,937
Yeah, that doesn't count.

532
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:33,406
Plus, you actually have
to leave the apartment

533
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,609
at some point.

534
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,511
You know, why do you
have to Eeyore my night?

535
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,615
I'm here for the tough love.

536
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:42,116
Come on.

537
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:43,751
I'll help you figure this out.

538
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:53,426
You know what your problem is?

539
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,500
Are you drinking rosé?

540
00:40:01,636 --> 00:40:03,403
Red Bull and white wine.

541
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:06,007
You're gross.

542
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:11,012
Go on, tell me my problem.

543
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:14,481
You're a nosy bitch and
you're always up in my shit.

544
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:16,884
I mean,
why do you even care, anyway?

545
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:18,920
- Because I'm you.
- No, no.

546
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:20,554
That's not true.

547
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:23,024
Because... because I don't care.

548
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,491
You obviously do.

549
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:26,527
You know nothing about me.

550
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,062
I know everything about you.

551
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:32,934
You know, you always have to
get the last word in, huh?

552
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:34,635
I can never win
a fight with you.

553
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,537
It's very, very frustrating.

554
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,139
You're only
fighting with yourself.

555
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:39,640
Somewhere
deep inside your brain,

556
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:41,154
you are desperate
to leave this place.

557
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,544
Why? Huh? Tell me why.

558
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:46,814
It's warm.
It's comfortable. It's safe.

559
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:48,849
Why would I ever want to leave?

560
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:50,084
You really wanna know?

561
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:51,986
Bring it on, fucker.

562
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:55,990
You are a lonely bastard who
buries that loneliness so deep

563
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:58,926
that you need to create
an imaginary friend

564
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,027
to help you deal with it.

565
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,164
Fuck you.
You know nothing about me.

566
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:05,967
You seriously want to take
a spin on that block again?

567
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:10,905
You think you're so smart,
that you know everything.

568
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,740
Huh? Well, you know nothing.

569
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,885
Hey, man, I know you're drunk
and you don't care,

570
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:27,822
but I really am
just trying to help you.

571
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:28,956
Well, you suck at it.

572
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:31,959
You know what, fine.

573
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,297
You wanna fall deeper into
your lonely hole until you get

574
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,933
so depressed that you send
a bullet through your brain?

575
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,103
- Do it.
- I'm not depressed.

576
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:44,739
You don't know what not being
depressed is like anymore.

577
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:47,074
You've wasted
the last five years

578
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:49,043
in this goddamn prison,
and for what?

579
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:50,845
To not deal with
the horrors of the world?

580
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:52,580
- Exactly.
- Well...

581
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,749
I have news for you.

582
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:57,194
That when you block out
the horrors of the world,

583
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:59,987
you block out the good shit,
the shit that makes you happy.

584
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:03,124
Look at you. Your life sucks.

585
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:12,833
Fuck you.

586
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,002
All right, fuck you too.

587
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,312
What are we gonna do about him?

588
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:36,757
You're gettin' fat, Deb.

589
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:09,056
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

590
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,392
Oh! I am so sorry.

591
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,360
It's okay, you were
obviously asleep, so...

592
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:16,163
I... um... Yes, um, we were.

593
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:18,065
Oh. "We."

594
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:20,101
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

595
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:21,669
- I mean me.
- You have someone over...

596
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:22,403
- I was asleep. No...
- No, I'm...

597
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,705
Um, please, uh, come in.

598
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:26,874
Are you sure?

599
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:30,277
Um... uh, yes...

600
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:40,387
- Uh, Sylvia, this is...
- Oh, no, don't do that.

601
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:43,257
...a surprise.

602
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,659
Yeah, well, I know how
you love surprises, so.

603
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:49,730
You, uh, got anything to eat?

604
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:51,866
Um...

605
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,368
Just talk to her.

606
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:55,803
- Shh.
- She can't hear me.

607
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:57,671
She can't hear me.
Look. Hi. Hello.

608
00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:58,939
- Wow.
- She can't hear me.

609
00:43:58,973 --> 00:44:00,841
Your fruit snack game is strong.

610
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,986
Ah, sorry, that makes me seem
a little psycho, doesn't it?

611
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,712
No! No, I love it.

612
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,747
- She loves it.
- Shut up.

613
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,416
- What?
- Oh, it... it's nothing, sorry.

614
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:11,185
Are you sure you're okay?

615
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,888
Um, yeah.

616
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:16,657
Sorry, I'm just a little...
A little hungover.

617
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:19,026
We didn't drink that much.

618
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,995
I had a little more afterwards.

619
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:23,964
Uh-oh. You know that
binge drinking alone

620
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:25,232
is a cry for help, right?

621
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:29,103
Um, yeah. Yeah.

622
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:33,440
And that banter is a team sport?

623
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:36,110
Right. Um...

624
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:41,382
Wait, no, no!

625
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:50,357
Um, sorry. Um, the social
skills are a little rusty.

626
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:52,159
Or did they ever exist?

627
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:53,260
Shh!

628
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:55,906
Are you sure that
there's no one else here?

629
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,098
Uh, positive.
Check the whole place.

630
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:02,203
No, I didn't mean... I'm sorry.
I'm being extra again, huh?

631
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:04,138
No, no, no. Um, you're fine.

632
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:05,773
Well, I just wanted
to stop by and see

633
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:07,808
if maybe you
wanted to watch a movie later.

634
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:10,110
Um, depends.

635
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:11,812
- Oof.
- Wrong answer.

636
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:13,747
Oh. I mean, yes.

637
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:16,217
Whoa, don't sound too excited.

638
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,418
I'm sorry.

639
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:20,054
Um, just me and, um...

640
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,223
surprises.

641
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:24,291
Right, well,
you don't have to do anything.

642
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:26,060
Okay, I'll plan the whole thing,

643
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:28,093
and all you have to do
is be at your door at seven.

644
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:31,031
Uh, we're not
going anywhere, are we?

645
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,867
Oh, my God.
Would I do that to you?

646
00:45:34,301 --> 00:45:35,903
I mean, yeah,
I guess I totally would.

647
00:45:35,936 --> 00:45:37,738
But that's not
what's going on, I promise.

648
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:41,008
Um, okay.

649
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:43,545
- "Great. I'm in."
- Great. I'm in.

650
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:45,846
Great. Tonight.

651
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:47,348
Seven.

652
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:49,149
Okay. Um...

653
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,253
- Sounds...
- Lovely.

654
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,354
...lovely.

655
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:54,455
Okay.

656
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:58,125
Bye.

657
00:45:58,158 --> 00:45:59,493
You are useless.

658
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:05,799
Goin' on a date tonight, Mom.

659
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:10,237
Never thought
I'd say that again.

660
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:14,408
I know we haven't
talked in a while,

661
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:16,477
but, uh...

662
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,519
I just hope I don't
mess this one up, you know?

663
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:27,855
You've been there.

664
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:31,091
Been with me by my side.

665
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,860
I haven't had
the best track record.

666
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:42,102
Wish me luck.

667
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:44,171
Love you, Mom.

668
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:50,344
I can't do this.

669
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:54,948
Look,
I don't think I can do this.

670
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:59,587
I really like you, but I really
can't leave this place.

671
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,089
I just...

672
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,391
Oh, okay.

673
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:11,932
You're great, um,
and it's not you.

674
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:13,934
It's me.

675
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:16,070
I...

676
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:18,038
Please don't make me do this.

677
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:21,141
Oh, boy.

678
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:51,566
Are you good?

679
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:56,538
You see that ship?

680
00:48:57,572 --> 00:49:00,240
- It's the best.
- It's so nice.

681
00:49:15,355 --> 00:49:18,726
You know, we sound
pretty good together, actually.

682
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,094
Maybe we should write something.

683
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:24,498
No, I'm... No, I can't.

684
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,670
I bet you have
hundreds of these songs

685
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:31,171
just floating around
in the back of your head.

686
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,409
Don't you pretend
that you don't know that I do.

687
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:38,212
Yeah, that's a good point.

688
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,724
I hate it when you do that.

689
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:27,160
I'm proud of you.

690
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:29,463
Door closed and everything.

691
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:34,067
Thanks.
That's kind of sad, isn't it?

692
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:35,402
No, it's great.

693
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,105
Uh...

694
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:42,276
Uh, do you...
Would you like to, uh,

695
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:44,378
watch a movie
out in the hall tonight?

696
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:48,415
Actually, not to push you
too hard or anything,

697
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:51,285
but since now you've
technically left your place

698
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:53,688
and I've technically
also been inside...

699
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:57,424
do you think that we could move
our hangouts into your place?

700
00:50:57,759 --> 00:51:00,595
Don't get me wrong,
I love this hallway.

701
00:51:01,128 --> 00:51:03,463
But my ass is starting
to get a little flat

702
00:51:03,497 --> 00:51:05,165
from sitting on
the concrete all the time.

703
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:07,200
- Um...
- Please, please,

704
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,704
say yes, you fucking coward.

705
00:51:10,103 --> 00:51:13,608
- Are you okay?
- Um, uh, yeah. Um.

706
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:16,611
Y... Yes.

707
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:20,180
We can hang out
at my place tonight.

708
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:22,482
Great. You won't regret this.

709
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:28,088
You regret this, don't you?

710
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:31,859
Um, no, I...
I'm just... I'm sorry.

711
00:51:31,893 --> 00:51:33,728
This is all, uh...
This is all very new to me.

712
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:36,463
I'm just, um...
I have to get used to it.

713
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:38,766
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

714
00:51:41,603 --> 00:51:43,581
Actually, could... could you
just give me one second?

715
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:44,772
It'll be quick.

716
00:51:54,616 --> 00:51:56,216
Do you take a lot of those?

717
00:51:57,685 --> 00:51:59,453
Only when I get stressed out.

718
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:01,154
Thanks.

719
00:52:01,556 --> 00:52:03,457
No, no, no, it's...
It's seriously not you,

720
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,525
I just...

721
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:07,528
I'm sorry, I'm just...

722
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,297
going through a lot right now,

723
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,734
um, but I know I can do this.

724
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:15,903
I really also like
spending time with you.

725
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:18,171
I like spending time
with you too.

726
00:52:18,673 --> 00:52:19,917
I'm gonna have to
get used to that.

727
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:21,341
Sorry.

728
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,844
Oh, God. It's okay.

729
00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:24,488
No, it's okay.
It's all right, it's all right.

730
00:52:24,512 --> 00:52:26,313
It's not a big deal, it's fine.

731
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:29,449
You know, talking to me
like I'm a child doesn't help.

732
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:31,562
I don't know
what you want me to do, Benji.

733
00:52:31,586 --> 00:52:32,887
Can you cut me some slack?

734
00:52:34,622 --> 00:52:35,690
I'm sorry.

735
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:37,759
It's just...

736
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:41,428
I'm really stressed out tonight.

737
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,498
I better go.

738
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:46,534
I gotta get up early for work.

739
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:50,538
Well, that's bullshit.

740
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:53,608
Excuse me.

741
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:56,576
What kind of a bar
opens early in the morning?

742
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:59,947
- Right. Inventory.
- Oh.

743
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:03,785
Well, I mean,
you really don't have to go.

744
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,763
No, it's okay. You know,
we'll pick something easier

745
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,454
next time, like a movie.

746
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:11,425
But I... I... Please,
I didn't mean... I...

747
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:19,332
That went well.

748
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:21,903
Shut up, it was a start.

749
00:53:22,937 --> 00:53:24,438
You like her a lot, don't you?

750
00:53:27,441 --> 00:53:30,243
Yeah, well,
she's pretty awesome.

751
00:53:30,778 --> 00:53:32,680
She's definitely an improvement.

752
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,517
You've had
a pretty crappy track record.

753
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:38,318
Yup.

754
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,789
Never really been
one with the girls, have I?

755
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:43,390
No, you have not.

756
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:45,693
You know, my first girlfriend

757
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:46,870
had to trick me
into kissing her.

758
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,663
Yeah, Amy.

759
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,365
And don't forget about
the fire starter in college.

760
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:55,036
- Chloe?
- And then there was Rachel.

761
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:57,772
Who darted after
I wasn't famous anymore.

762
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:00,474
You have not had

763
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:02,009
any luck in this department.

764
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:06,346
No, the only luck
I've ever really had

765
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:07,882
was with my music, and...

766
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,384
somehow I managed
to fuck that up too.

767
00:54:15,723 --> 00:54:17,592
Hey,
if you don't mind me asking,

768
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:18,826
what happened with that?

769
00:54:20,628 --> 00:54:22,496
You remember Chloe
but you don't remember

770
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,765
what happened with my music?

771
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:26,500
It might help to talk about it.

772
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:33,674
I... Truthfully,

773
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,510
I... I don't know. You know?

774
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:38,012
I mean, one minute
I'd written this song

775
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:40,380
that I was physically
in love with, you know,

776
00:54:40,413 --> 00:54:41,616
and then the next?

777
00:54:42,415 --> 00:54:44,317
The whole world
was in love with it.

778
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:45,887
I don't know, maybe...

779
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,622
I wasn't ready to share it.

780
00:54:47,655 --> 00:54:49,056
- I don't think that's true.
- I...

781
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,064
It all just happened so fast.

782
00:54:57,098 --> 00:55:00,433
And before I could even
wrap my head around

783
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:01,669
recording an album...

784
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,404
you know,
my face was everywhere.

785
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,406
You know,
cameras were following me.

786
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:08,118
Executives were asking me
for my next album.

787
00:55:08,142 --> 00:55:10,645
- Yeah, that sounds like a lot.
- It was! You know?

788
00:55:10,678 --> 00:55:13,714
Like, I remember
the moment I snapped.

789
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:19,887
I was leaving after a show,

790
00:55:20,888 --> 00:55:22,422
and instead of my car,

791
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,526
it was a mob of fans.

792
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:29,797
And they were just
pushing me and shoving

793
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:31,799
and trying to touch me

794
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:33,701
and reach their arms
out for selfies and...

795
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,675
Something broke in me.

796
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:44,879
I've never been so scared.

797
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:48,115
I couldn't breathe.

798
00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:49,817
I passed out, next thing I know,

799
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:51,351
I woke up in the hospital

800
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:53,721
with this...

801
00:55:55,089 --> 00:55:58,491
irrational fucking anger.

802
00:55:59,694 --> 00:56:01,095
That anger never left.

803
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,733
Any time
I'd feel like that again,

804
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:07,535
I would just lash out,
become violent.

805
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,637
And people thought
I was fame-crazed.

806
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,938
It was the exact opposite.

807
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:14,842
And I don't know.
My mind just shut down.

808
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,449
- The freezing onstage.
- Freezing on stage.

809
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:27,030
Even if I wanted
to come back from that,

810
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,455
how could I?

811
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:31,726
So... so naturally,
I just locked myself up

812
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:33,460
and threw away the fucking key.

813
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:42,670
I know, buddy.

814
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:54,709
Are we ever gonna talk
about the fact

815
00:57:54,742 --> 00:57:56,210
that I look like Jordan Tyler?

816
00:57:58,646 --> 00:57:59,714
No.

817
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,688
What do you want me
to say, okay?

818
00:58:07,722 --> 00:58:09,223
He's just some guy.

819
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:12,026
He's obviously
more than just some guy.

820
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:18,666
I mean, so he was...
He was good at life.

821
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:20,901
I sucked at it, you know?
So what?

822
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:23,938
So, jealousy.

823
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:29,877
More like inadequacy.

824
00:58:30,444 --> 00:58:32,013
No. You know what? Fuck you.

825
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:34,015
We're done talking
about this, all right?

826
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:44,792
Just so we're clear.

827
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,995
You sucked at living his life,
not yours.

828
00:58:54,902 --> 00:58:57,671
You know, all this insightful
bullshit's getting old, right?

829
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:02,643
All right. Dump in that sugar.

830
00:59:02,676 --> 00:59:04,145
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

831
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:06,313
Are you kidding me?
This is gonna be so good.

832
00:59:06,347 --> 00:59:07,815
- Like that?
- Yeah.

833
00:59:07,848 --> 00:59:09,216
I made this recipe up.

834
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,927
Dude, you're getting
better at this game now.

835
00:59:10,951 --> 00:59:12,653
- I know, right?
- Just kidding.

836
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:14,555
- Oh, fuck man.
- Fuck you, dude.

837
00:59:15,256 --> 00:59:16,724
- No.
- Dude.

838
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:17,992
Fuck you, fuck you.

839
00:59:20,895 --> 00:59:21,962
Yup.

840
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,666
- That sounds good.
- That sounds fine.

841
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:27,701
Is it straight?

842
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,237
Yup.

843
00:59:30,271 --> 00:59:31,939
Nice. Okay.

844
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:39,647
What is this?
You shouldn't have.

845
00:59:40,314 --> 00:59:42,183
You are somethin' else,
you know that?

846
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:45,686
You are so great.

847
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,288
What the hell?

848
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:49,290
That's exactly what...
What am I doing?

849
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:50,825
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

850
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:52,218
- That was a waste of money.
- I...

851
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:53,694
What the fuck?

852
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:29,830
Bathroom.

853
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:51,919
What the fuck
are you doing with my phone?

854
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:53,020
It went off. I'm...

855
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:55,189
Don't look at my shit, okay?

856
01:00:55,557 --> 01:00:57,791
Geez, okay. Um...

857
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:01,428
Who's... who's Becky,
and what... what does she mean?

858
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:03,464
You know what?
I think it's time for me to go.

859
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:05,032
No, you... you don't have to go.

860
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:06,167
No, no, no, no, it's okay,

861
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,002
I, um... um... I'm just tired.

862
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:10,004
I swear. I'll see you tomorrow.

863
01:01:10,037 --> 01:01:11,805
But...

864
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:36,797
That's a new one.

865
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,302
Let's just say I was inspired.

866
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:43,871
What's it called?

867
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:49,944
Coward.

868
01:01:54,248 --> 01:01:56,250
- No?
- Yeah.

869
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:00,354
Hey!
I was writing that too!

870
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:04,151
Yeah. Teamwork.

871
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:05,386
Dream work.

872
01:03:17,097 --> 01:03:18,365
It's time, buddy.

873
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:22,136
No fucking way.

874
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:30,144
You've been social.
You're dating Sylvia.

875
01:03:30,177 --> 01:03:31,513
You're writing
and playing again.

876
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,615
You wrote an awesome song.

877
01:03:33,648 --> 01:03:35,482
It's time
to take the bigger step.

878
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:37,351
- No.
- Why?

879
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:39,219
- Because.
- Really?

880
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:40,487
Because I don't want to.

881
01:03:40,522 --> 01:03:43,290
It was her last wish.

882
01:03:43,692 --> 01:03:46,160
Don't you fucking dare.

883
01:03:50,264 --> 01:03:52,900
You do realize the door
does not need to be open

884
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,101
for me to get in, right?

885
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:57,204
You know,
we're finally getting along.

886
01:03:57,237 --> 01:03:58,540
Why do you want to ruin that?

887
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,508
I am not here
to get along with you.

888
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:02,610
I'm here
to kick your ass out the door!

889
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:05,112
I'm making progress, aren't I?

890
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:06,648
Why can't I do it
at my own pace?

891
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:08,282
Just to remind you that I am you

892
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:10,317
so there's a part of you
that wants to do this.

893
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:12,252
Yeah, but not
the same part of me that wants

894
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:15,055
- to get rid of you right now.
- Why are you being so scared?

895
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:16,591
Fuck!

896
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:22,296
Look, get this through

897
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:25,065
your thick, stubborn head, okay?

898
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:28,502
I'm not ready,
so back the fuck off.

899
01:04:28,536 --> 01:04:32,072
Not ready because you don't
want to leave the apartment

900
01:04:32,106 --> 01:04:34,509
or not ready because
you don't want to say goodbye?

901
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:36,511
Get the fuck out of my head!

902
01:04:44,952 --> 01:04:46,253
Hi. Can I come in?

903
01:04:46,286 --> 01:04:48,690
Um, yeah. Are you sure?

904
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:50,224
Yes. Please.

905
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,338
Want another beer?

906
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:07,174
No,
I'm still working on my first.

907
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:09,910
Are you sure you're okay?
You seem really tense.

908
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,149
First time out of the apartment.

909
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,251
Yeah, but you're
just across the hall.

910
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:19,687
I mean, my apartment's
almost identical to yours.

911
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:23,157
Unfortunately, that's not
how my brain sees it.

912
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,329
Well, not to encourage
more drunkenness

913
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:32,466
but what about a game
of drowning fruit snacks?

914
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,073
What's bothering you?

915
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:43,043
It's, uh, it's my mom.

916
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,513
I thought your mom was dead.

917
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:47,247
She is, um,

918
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,082
it's just that, uh...

919
01:05:50,652 --> 01:05:53,420
I, uh... I have her ashes
on my coffee table.

920
01:05:54,021 --> 01:05:56,490
Oh, I was wondering
what that was.

921
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:59,226
Bit of a long story.

922
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:01,094
Uh, short version.

923
01:06:04,198 --> 01:06:05,633
I missed her funeral

924
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:07,367
because I wouldn't
leave the house.

925
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:13,207
My father informed me
that her final request

926
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,310
was that her ashes be scattered
at our old summer home.

927
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:18,646
But that would mean
leaving the house.

928
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,114
- Right.
- Right.

929
01:06:22,249 --> 01:06:24,251
How long have you had the ashes?

930
01:06:25,052 --> 01:06:26,086
Three years.

931
01:06:26,821 --> 01:06:28,388
So what's different now?

932
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:32,560
An annoying
little voice in my head

933
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:35,162
that's pressuring me
into doing it.

934
01:06:36,363 --> 01:06:39,132
- I could do it for you.
- I'm just not ready.

935
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:41,603
So what are you gonna do?

936
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:45,005
Feel guilty.

937
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:50,410
Hey, I thought it was my turn.

938
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:52,124
You weren't going.
You forfeited your turn.

939
01:06:53,815 --> 01:06:56,584
So are we ever going to talk
about why you're a shut in?

940
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,421
That's, um...
That's not really something

941
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:03,525
I care to talk about.

942
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:04,626
Obviously.

943
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:09,396
Well...

944
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,600
would it help if I, um,

945
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:16,069
if I told you that
I know you're Tucker Stills?

946
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:18,071
How?

947
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:20,274
Wasn't that hard.
I have the Internet.

948
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:22,610
When? When did you know?

949
01:07:22,644 --> 01:07:23,745
Not right away.

950
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:25,747
Um, I kind of got my first hint

951
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,715
when I heard
the Tucker Stills song

952
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:30,083
- that you put on that play list.
- Bastard.

953
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:31,519
And it sounded so much like you.

954
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:34,154
Not just the voice,
but the words.

955
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:36,390
So a couple of weeks in,
I guess.

956
01:07:37,725 --> 01:07:40,327
So I take it, then,
you read about the, uh...

957
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,596
The photographer.

958
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,698
Yeah.

959
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:49,637
- About the Chinese restaurant.
- Oh, yeah.

960
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,408
You think I'm psycho, don't you?

961
01:07:54,441 --> 01:07:56,744
No. I... I didn't know what to
believe at first, you know,

962
01:07:56,778 --> 01:08:00,480
'cause the... the violent,
fame-crazed man they were

963
01:08:00,515 --> 01:08:03,283
describing just did not jive
with the man that I know.

964
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:06,588
The gentle, quiet, funny man

965
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:08,488
who's afraid of his own shadow.

966
01:08:11,158 --> 01:08:13,293
But then I read about
the awards and I got it.

967
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,565
I get why you closed
yourself off from the world.

968
01:08:19,499 --> 01:08:20,635
They broke you.

969
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:25,105
- Who broke me?
- Everyone.

970
01:08:25,974 --> 01:08:28,676
The press,
the fans, the industry...

971
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:31,311
the world.

972
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,147
Wow.

973
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:38,553
No one's ever
put it like that before.

974
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:42,389
You're right.

975
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:45,793
They... they broke me.

976
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:50,632
S... so why the fuck have I been
blaming myself all this time?

977
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:53,266
'Cause the whole world
blamed you.

978
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,403
And it's kinda tough
to argue with the whole world.

979
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:02,175
Look, Benji, I'm not here to
tell you what's right or wrong

980
01:09:02,209 --> 01:09:05,647
or who to blame
or even how to heal.

981
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,783
I can't possibly imagine
what you've gone through.

982
01:09:10,618 --> 01:09:13,220
And we can take this
as slow or as fast as you want.

983
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:15,422
I just want you to know that

984
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:17,491
even if you never
leave the house again...

985
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:20,695
I'm here for you.

986
01:09:25,232 --> 01:09:26,577
You would never be
happy with somebody

987
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:28,268
who can't leave the house.

988
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:29,871
But we don't
have to be dating for...

989
01:09:29,904 --> 01:09:31,706
For me to be here
for you, you know?

990
01:09:31,739 --> 01:09:34,241
We don't have to
define anything.

991
01:09:34,642 --> 01:09:35,910
We can just take it day by day

992
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:38,345
and see if we're friends,

993
01:09:38,378 --> 01:09:41,649
or support systems,
or soul mates.

994
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,752
Whatever it is, is fine with me.

995
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:54,227
You know, I pay $200 a session.

996
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:56,698
My therapist has never
put anything that good.

997
01:09:57,598 --> 01:09:58,766
You should charge.

998
01:10:02,402 --> 01:10:03,805
Hey.
Sorry about yesterday.

999
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:07,307
- Nah, you were right.
- Excuse me?

1000
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:09,711
Hey, don't get too excited,
all right, buddy?

1001
01:10:10,578 --> 01:10:13,948
But, uh, I think
you're right, it is time.

1002
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:16,316
I don't even know...

1003
01:10:17,051 --> 01:10:18,452
how to respond to that.

1004
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:22,355
You don't have to
say anything, just help.

1005
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,692
What about Sylvia?

1006
01:10:25,793 --> 01:10:26,861
We're cool.

1007
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:29,362
She's helping too.

1008
01:10:34,035 --> 01:10:35,302
I don't...

1009
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,307
I'm gonna handle my shit.

1010
01:10:41,008 --> 01:10:43,443
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah, you should.

1011
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:49,817
It got really hot in here
all of a sudden.

1012
01:11:01,863 --> 01:11:02,930
How you doin'?

1013
01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:40,701
I can't do this.

1014
01:11:42,703 --> 01:11:44,337
It's a process.
You'll get there.

1015
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:46,306
What if I don't
want to get there?

1016
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:48,743
Hey, you don't mean that.

1017
01:11:50,711 --> 01:11:52,113
I mean, she's my mom.

1018
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:53,724
Why can't she just
stay with me, you know?

1019
01:11:53,748 --> 01:11:54,816
Be with me?

1020
01:11:55,249 --> 01:11:56,818
That's not what she wanted.

1021
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:58,351
What about what I want?

1022
01:11:58,686 --> 01:12:00,788
Yeah, that doesn't matter
in this case, man.

1023
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:13,366
I mean, you know
your mom is dead, right?

1024
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,335
Those are just ashes.

1025
01:12:19,907 --> 01:12:21,042
Holy fuck.

1026
01:12:23,778 --> 01:12:25,856
If you're supposed to be me,
why are you so good at life

1027
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,783
and I fucking suck at it?
Goddamn.

1028
01:12:28,816 --> 01:12:31,586
- No, man. Don't do that.
- Fuck.

1029
01:12:31,953 --> 01:12:34,655
- Oh, man, oh, God, oh, God.
- Don't go there.

1030
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:36,958
- You don't suck at life.
- Fuck, I can't.

1031
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:40,161
- You're good at your life.
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

1032
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:41,829
Can you say it with me?

1033
01:12:41,863 --> 01:12:43,798
- I can't... Fucking sh...
- Hey, stop.

1034
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:49,637
Say it with me,
"I am good at my life."

1035
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,905
I am good at my life.

1036
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:55,943
You don't sound convinced.
Get up. Come on.

1037
01:12:58,478 --> 01:12:59,580
Say it with me.

1038
01:13:00,748 --> 01:13:03,618
"I am good at my life."

1039
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:05,753
I am good at my life.

1040
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,655
Louder.

1041
01:13:09,023 --> 01:13:10,524
I'm good at my life.

1042
01:13:10,558 --> 01:13:12,093
Louder. Make me believe.

1043
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:14,137
- I'm fucking good at my life.
- Good. You got this.

1044
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:15,462
- I've got this.
- Good.

1045
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:16,764
Now go find Sylvia and do this.

1046
01:13:16,797 --> 01:13:18,041
Good, now go find Sylvia
and do this...

1047
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:20,701
No, fuck.
We are done repeating.

1048
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:23,804
- Oh.
- Go find Sylvia and do this.

1049
01:13:23,838 --> 01:13:26,107
Fucking moron.

1050
01:13:40,054 --> 01:13:41,622
All right, let's open the door.

1051
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:44,457
All right.

1052
01:13:47,494 --> 01:13:48,562
Relax.

1053
01:13:57,238 --> 01:13:59,240
A little forward, stop.

1054
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,065
Step down.

1055
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:02,970
One more.

1056
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:15,216
Okay.

1057
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:22,156
Taking the blindfold off now.

1058
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:25,693
Wait, wait.

1059
01:15:33,868 --> 01:15:34,935
You can do this.

1060
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:54,855
Wow.

1061
01:15:56,357 --> 01:15:57,625
How you doing?

1062
01:15:58,893 --> 01:16:00,294
It's so beautiful.

1063
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,564
It's a good place
for your mom to rest.

1064
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:14,041
I'm not sure
I'm ready to do this.

1065
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:16,644
It's not about being ready.

1066
01:16:17,978 --> 01:16:19,280
Nobody's ever ready.

1067
01:16:20,347 --> 01:16:22,016
It's about deciding
that it's time.

1068
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:32,326
- Do you need my help?
- No.

1069
01:16:34,829 --> 01:16:35,896
No.

1070
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,167
I can do this.

1071
01:16:54,215 --> 01:16:55,282
Well, this is it, Mom.

1072
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:03,858
Thank you...

1073
01:17:05,392 --> 01:17:07,895
Thank you for always
being my biggest fan.

1074
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:18,873
And for always believing in me.

1075
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,215
I promise I'll come visit you...

1076
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:32,253
all the time.

1077
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:57,378
You'll always be with me.

1078
01:18:32,913 --> 01:18:34,048
I love you.

1079
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:50,264
Can't believe
I spent so much time...

1080
01:18:52,266 --> 01:18:55,135
hiding from all of this.

1081
01:19:00,107 --> 01:19:01,242
Jordan was right.

1082
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:05,112
I wasted so much time.

1083
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:08,882
Well, now
you can make up for it.

1084
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:17,391
I was lost for so long.

1085
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,862
Well, you know,
someone smart once told me

1086
01:19:21,895 --> 01:19:24,999
that to get lost
is to find the way.

1087
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:47,821
Who's Jordan?

1088
01:20:20,555 --> 01:20:22,524
- Hey, Benji.
- Yeah?

1089
01:20:23,157 --> 01:20:24,992
I need to tell you something.

1090
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:26,594
Okay.

1091
01:20:26,628 --> 01:20:29,363
I wasn't completely honest
about the way that we met.

1092
01:20:30,497 --> 01:20:32,499
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh, Sylvia,

1093
01:20:32,534 --> 01:20:34,177
I've been waiting for you
for, like, three hours,

1094
01:20:34,201 --> 01:20:35,579
- and I definitely ran...
- Becky, no.

1095
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:38,138
Oh, my gosh.
It's Tucker Stills.

1096
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:39,416
- Oh, my God...
- Benji, I'm so sorry.

1097
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,551
You look just like
your pictures,

1098
01:20:40,575 --> 01:20:42,343
and that doesn't always happen.

1099
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:43,987
You know what, I am so excited
to meet you in person.

1100
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:45,279
- Becky...
- I'm a huge fan.

1101
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,980
- Listen... No...
- Sylvia has told me

1102
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:48,559
so much about you,
but also, most importantly,

1103
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,393
I hope you guys don't mind,
I did bring some friends.

1104
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:52,295
- They really wanna meet you.
- What? Becky, no.

1105
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:54,321
- I know.
- You guys, please.

1106
01:20:54,355 --> 01:20:56,123
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

1107
01:21:01,596 --> 01:21:02,930
That's my bad.

1108
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,672
- Benji...
- No.

1109
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:47,408
Okay. Fuck you.
You don't get to talk.

1110
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:48,710
I wanted to tell you.

1111
01:21:48,743 --> 01:21:51,078
I ju... What did I just say?

1112
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:53,013
Okay, you used me.

1113
01:21:53,046 --> 01:21:54,516
You used me
to get to Tucker Stills.

1114
01:21:54,549 --> 01:21:56,116
No, not anymore.

1115
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:59,286
Stay the fuck
away from me, okay?

1116
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:00,688
No, I did try
to find you. I did.

1117
01:22:00,722 --> 01:22:02,557
But then I met you
and you were nothing like

1118
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:04,401
I thought you would be,
and I really did fall for you...

1119
01:22:04,425 --> 01:22:05,492
No!

1120
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:08,262
Fuck you.

1121
01:22:39,594 --> 01:22:41,195
<i>Victory!</i>

1122
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:43,591
A packet of cigarettes, please.

1123
01:23:44,258 --> 01:23:45,425
$11.

1124
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:55,570
Thank you very much.

1125
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,484
Mr. Williams.

1126
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:15,557
After you.

1127
01:24:15,857 --> 01:24:17,124
Thanks.

1128
01:24:18,492 --> 01:24:19,827
So you really think he's gone?

1129
01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:23,598
It's been six months.

1130
01:24:24,566 --> 01:24:25,800
You don't sound happy.

1131
01:24:27,434 --> 01:24:30,304
I feel more alone now
than when I was shut in.

1132
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:33,841
I mean, Jordan's gone.

1133
01:24:34,609 --> 01:24:36,109
My mother's gone.

1134
01:24:36,143 --> 01:24:37,845
You know,
Jordan was always with you.

1135
01:24:37,879 --> 01:24:39,581
You can visit him
whenever you want.

1136
01:24:39,614 --> 01:24:41,734
- The same with your mom.
- It's not the same, though.

1137
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:44,752
Have you seen Sylvia?

1138
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:50,157
Why the fuck would you ask that?

1139
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:52,459
Hey, what she did was horrible.

1140
01:24:52,492 --> 01:24:54,896
But she was the one that
got you to leave the house.

1141
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:56,731
There must be
something good there.

1142
01:24:56,764 --> 01:24:58,498
Jordan got me
to leave the house.

1143
01:24:58,533 --> 01:25:00,635
Jordan forced you
to look at your life.

1144
01:25:00,668 --> 01:25:02,770
Sylvia was the catalyst
for you to leave.

1145
01:25:02,804 --> 01:25:05,105
- You should talk to her.
- Why?

1146
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,809
She may have a good reason
for what she did.

1147
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:11,546
She may feel bad.
She may actually love you.

1148
01:25:13,815 --> 01:25:16,383
Well, let's focus
on better thing.

1149
01:25:16,751 --> 01:25:18,753
You're slowly
rejoining the real world.

1150
01:25:18,786 --> 01:25:20,588
You're even doing
that songwriter showcase.

1151
01:25:20,622 --> 01:25:22,222
I am very proud of you.

1152
01:25:22,557 --> 01:25:24,424
Thanks.

1153
01:25:25,225 --> 01:25:27,595
It could be
really good for me, in a way.

1154
01:25:28,529 --> 01:25:32,265
I just want to do
what I love without the fame.

1155
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:34,669
Sounds like a good compromise,

1156
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:36,203
and I'm sure people
will be clamoring

1157
01:25:36,236 --> 01:25:37,796
- for new Tucker Stills...
- No, no, no.

1158
01:25:38,873 --> 01:25:40,307
No more Tucker Stills.

1159
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:43,611
All right?
This time I'm doing this as me.

1160
01:25:44,846 --> 01:25:46,781
I think that's very healthy.

1161
01:25:47,615 --> 01:25:50,183
Just so long
as I don't freeze on stage.

1162
01:25:50,852 --> 01:25:53,186
I'm really nervous
about this, actually.

1163
01:25:54,822 --> 01:25:56,924
Just close your eyes
when you're on stage

1164
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:59,359
and imagine you are alone
in your living room.

1165
01:25:59,393 --> 01:26:00,595
No, I mean, it's not that.

1166
01:26:00,628 --> 01:26:04,599
I mean, it is that, but also...

1167
01:26:08,703 --> 01:26:10,470
Jordan won't be there to see it.

1168
01:26:34,829 --> 01:26:36,764
I need you, buddy.
Where are you?

1169
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:52,747
You know,
I never got to say goodbye.

1170
01:27:01,388 --> 01:27:02,957
If it weren't for you, I...

1171
01:27:03,624 --> 01:27:06,493
I'd probably still be
in that damn apartment.

1172
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,263
And I probably
have would never left.

1173
01:27:15,703 --> 01:27:18,472
Of course,
you're a horrible wing man.

1174
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:25,670
I wouldn't have had the balls
to do this without you, buddy.

1175
01:27:36,624 --> 01:27:37,692
I miss you.

1176
01:27:41,495 --> 01:27:42,563
I love you, man.

1177
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:49,036
Cheers, buddy.

1178
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:52,305
Welcome
to the <i>Songwriters Showcase,</i>

1179
01:27:52,339 --> 01:27:54,374
<i>Benji Williams.</i>

1180
01:30:45,179 --> 01:30:47,581
Are you gonna knock
or should I just open it?

1181
01:30:55,923 --> 01:30:57,490
Do you want any fruit snacks?

1182
01:31:07,768 --> 01:31:08,836
How have you been?

1183
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:13,641
All right, I guess.

1184
01:31:26,721 --> 01:31:28,622
Can I please apologize to you?

1185
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:36,230
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

1186
01:31:41,569 --> 01:31:43,004
I was looking for Tucker Stills,

1187
01:31:43,037 --> 01:31:44,238
but then I met you...

1188
01:31:46,007 --> 01:31:48,009
and I just felt
so connected to you.

1189
01:31:51,145 --> 01:31:53,748
Tucker Stills or Benji Williams?

1190
01:31:57,885 --> 01:32:01,088
Well, it's true,
I was a fan of Tucker Stills...

1191
01:32:02,656 --> 01:32:04,759
but now I'm a fan
of Benji Williams.

1192
01:32:10,798 --> 01:32:13,534
Okay, yeah, I heard that as it
was coming out of my mouth.

1193
01:32:14,969 --> 01:32:17,705
But seriously,
that's... that's why I felt

1194
01:32:17,738 --> 01:32:21,108
such a connection
to the words in your music.

1195
01:32:22,309 --> 01:32:23,811
It was so personal.

1196
01:32:25,346 --> 01:32:29,116
And I really, really felt
a connection to the music,

1197
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:30,618
a connection to you.

1198
01:32:31,852 --> 01:32:33,320
It's just music.

1199
01:32:33,354 --> 01:32:35,222
It's music that you wrote.

1200
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,667
Can we start again?

1201
01:32:48,135 --> 01:32:51,238
You think you can ever
forget Tucker Stills?

1202
01:32:53,774 --> 01:32:55,910
I can try.

1203
01:33:02,183 --> 01:33:03,350
So what does that make us?

1204
01:33:03,818 --> 01:33:06,353
Friends? Soul mates?

1205
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:12,893
How about support systems?

1206
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:20,234
So, uh...

1207
01:33:24,004 --> 01:33:25,873
You're not really
a bartender, are you?

1208
01:33:26,841 --> 01:33:28,909
I book bands for the Fillmore.

1209
01:33:28,943 --> 01:33:30,211
Hmm.

1210
01:33:30,244 --> 01:33:32,079
That's actually
how we first met.

1211
01:33:32,514 --> 01:33:34,348
Um, I didn't
personally book you,

1212
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:35,916
I was doing
marketing at the time

1213
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,318
but I was at your show.

1214
01:33:38,419 --> 01:33:39,954
And I was working in the back.

1215
01:33:39,987 --> 01:33:42,990
And as soon as you
started playing,

1216
01:33:43,023 --> 01:33:46,727
I just stopped what I was doing.

1217
01:33:47,061 --> 01:33:48,762
I couldn't focus on anything.

1218
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:51,332
I just sat there listening.
