1
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,145
Don't mention anything to the guys.

2
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,551
Okay?

3
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,154
No.

4
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,596
Hello. How are you?

5
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,767
What's up Fausto?

6
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,503
Why so late?

7
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,672
We got a job early in the morning.

8
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,273
So you already did a "quickie"?

9
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,851
Something like that.

10
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,047
That's good.

11
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,685
- An early bird!
- We got 1 0 bucks each.

12
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,092
For breakfast...
At least it's something.

13
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,528
- Better than nothing.
- It was good as a starter.

14
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,157
- What did you do?
- Something simple.

15
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,567
- But what? What was it?
- Something easy.

16
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,833
Don't want to tell us?

17
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,773
- How you doing?
- They won't even pay 1 0 an hour.

18
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,174
It's time the price went up.

19
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,747
I got here at 7.:00
and you weren't here.

20
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,514
- We left at 6..30.
- Wow!

21
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,187
Here we are,
trying to get some work.

22
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,190
- Since the morning.
- Like all of us.

23
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,657
But nothing comes.

24
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,728
What time did you get here?

25
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,319
At 7.:00?

26
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,157
You have to be early.

27
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,865
- Here comes one.
- Come on.

28
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,872
Move fast!

29
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,736
How many?

30
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,173
Five!

31
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,971
Take one more?

32
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,245
There goes work!

33
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,586
He filled it up!

34
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,960
You've got to move fast.

35
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,529
But that guy always pays little.

36
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,063
They left with a leech!

37
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,567
That's why we didn't get up.

38
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,401
He pays little.

39
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,041
- Have you worked with him?
- He's a "cheesecake."

40
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,803
You mean cheapskate.

41
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,547
Poor guys, they'll regret it.

42
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,744
Let them work!

43
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,118
Tomorrow they'll tell us
about their adventure.

44
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,251
He only took old guys!

45
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,186
No, man! He took
the best and freshest!

46
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,720
Fucking heat!

47
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,790
Let me tell you a story.

48
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,895
A clean-cut guy
stopped the other day.

49
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,299
He asked for only one
and pointed at me.

50
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,766
So I went with him.

51
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,967
He took you in his car?

52
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,238
He said he was from the Minutemen.
So I panicked.

53
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,040
But he told me not to worry

54
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,581
because I had survived the desert.

55
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,310
So I deserved to be here.

56
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,283
We drove to Hoover Park.

57
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,846
He told me the job
was going to be in his truck.

58
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,516
I started to get suspicious.

59
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,094
He told me it was a special job.

60
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,392
I told him I was not a mechanic!

61
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,126
He told me it was okay.

62
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,134
What did he mean by "special"?

63
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:08,673
First, he offered me
some Bacardi Cognac.

64
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,573
Why?

65
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,271
Tell me another one!
Like when you got raped!

66
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,151
When that black guy got you
in Long Beach.

67
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,379
I'll be back.

68
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,015
He wanted to get me happy.
Then he touched my leg...

69
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,537
Good morning...

70
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,731
Can you go get my Aunt Lidia?

71
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,737
Yes, thank you.

72
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,779
Auntie, how are you?

73
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,981
Sorry. Things are getting better.

74
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,648
I'll be able to send money soon.

75
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,095
Yes, I got a job.

76
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,100
Don't be like that
when I'm so far away.

77
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,065
You don't know
how things work here.

78
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,610
How is Elvira?

79
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,958
I'll send some soon.

80
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,097
Okay. Bye.

81
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,570
Aren't you going to give me
God's blessing?

82
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,645
Thank you. Bye-bye, Auntie.

83
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,247
I haven't called them
in like three months.

84
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,184
How many guys do you need?

85
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,430
That lady always passes
but never picks anyone.

86
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,605
She only likes to look.

87
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,731
"Window Shopping."

88
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,574
To see who she likes.

89
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,884
Today, someone
is supposed to pick us up.

90
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,509
Who told you that?

91
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,421
Someone that stopped by yesterday.

92
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,586
Here comes one.

93
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,721
Ten dollars an hour is okay.
Eight is too little.

94
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,752
Ten dollars per hour.

95
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,974
Take your tools.
Let's clean up the area

96
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,511
and open a ditch

97
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,672
about half a meter deep

98
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,250
and half a meter wide.

99
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,217
Why don't you take off
that fucking back pack, man?

100
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,056
What did your aunt tell you?

101
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,737
That Elvira is almost
completely blind now.

102
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,776
I told her that things
will be better soon.

103
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,243
- With the money?
- Yes.

104
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,643
This is for you.

105
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,037
For you...

106
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,165
You promised to take us back.
Don't you remember?

107
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,241
What's this guy saying?

108
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,141
He doesn't want to take us back.

109
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,740
He has things to do.

110
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,380
He said he would take us back!

111
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,490
Look...
He has the same shoes as me.

112
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,230
Damn Gringo!

113
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:53,236
Fucking guy
didn't want to bring us back!

114
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,273
But we made it.
What's your plan?

115
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,399
See you tomorrow.

116
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,840
That's it?

117
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,912
We catch the bus over
on Montana St.

118
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,584
Bye, Jesus.

119
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,516
Wash it good, boys!

120
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,680
We'll have some beers at the park.

121
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,858
Let's forget the damn gringo,
keep the money,

122
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,764
throw away the shotgun.

123
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,706
- But we already agreed, man!
- You agreed!

124
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,168
I didn't say anything!

125
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,612
Don't be a pussy, bro.

126
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,812
Don't you worry about it.

127
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,130
Calm down, man!

128
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,536
Let it go!

129
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,097
Let's bust their faces, man!

130
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,611
Let's go!

131
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,494
Relax, bro.

132
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,002
Give me the shotgun.

133
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,886
Fucking gringos!

134
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,176
In the crop fields
we'll get us some women.

135
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,305
It's so pretty here.

136
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,116
Tomorrow is Independence Day
in Mexico.

137
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,723
If we were back home,
we'd be drunk by now.

138
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,599
Get the knives.

139
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,172
Put them in a bag.

140
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,795
Sit over there.

141
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,451
Sit down.

142
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,565
For the money.

143
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,257
Yes. John.

144
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:10,272
This lady is crazy.

145
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,329
Fausto, let's go for a swim.

146
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,561
Get in the water, please.

147
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,180
Take a hit.

148
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,604
Give it a try...

149
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,270
So you feel the effect.

150
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,176
Come on, don't be a coward!

151
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,927
Calm down!
You're acting like a brat!

152
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:56,865
No more?

153
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,965
La Venada, Guanajuato.

154
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,298
Be careful.

155
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:26,855
Yes.

156
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:30,734
Jesus.

157
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:47,020
Think of Elvira.
She's almost blind.

158
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:41,843
Jesus!

159
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,284
Let's leave, please!

160
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,121
Let's go.

161
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:02,867
It's time to go!

162
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,452
Don't touch!

163
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,760
Why did you kill her?

164
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,638
You're the one
that brought me here.

165
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,632
Let's go.

166
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,002
Hold on.

167
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,811
I can't hear well.

168
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,311
My ear is bleeding!

169
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,724
It's the woman's blood.

170
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:18,812
Good morning!

171
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,148
Who is new here?

172
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:25,990
Today we will work
about eight acres!

173
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,119
You will be paid by the hour!

174
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,027
- Okay?
- Yes.
