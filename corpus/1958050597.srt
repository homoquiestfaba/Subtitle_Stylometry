1
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,714
- Who's the best?

2
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:02,550
It's me.

3
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,588
Who is a stronger
man of the office?

4
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,524
That's me.

5
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,894
Let's go.

6
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,820
Are you happy for me?

7
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:42,623
- Why? What have
you done this time?

8
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,660
- I did girl online.

9
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,095
- Are you sure?

10
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,563
Just like last time
and the time before.

11
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,799
Now it's internet
dating, really?

12
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,636
Told you, it's is
not gonna end well.

13
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,505
You need to be like me,
stability, 20 years.

14
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:00,307
I'm a happy man.

15
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,477
That's what you need in
your life, stability.

16
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,444
- I have a good job.

17
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,683
I love my job, you know that.

18
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:13,886
But I know my boss
is an asshole.

19
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,554
I mean, a piece of shit.

20
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,322
- Definitely a
piece of shit, both,

21
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,491
but that doesn't mean
that you shouldn't

22
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,993
and don't want stability.

23
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,795
You're too high flying.

24
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:23,698
You're a playboy.

25
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,932
Everything's a joke to you.

26
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,400
What's wrong with Theresa, huh?

27
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,103
What's wrong with Mary?

28
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,439
What's wrong with Patricia?

29
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,372
What's wrong with Jennifer?

30
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,406
All these girls.

31
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,176
- Patricia, she was odd.

32
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:39,477
- She was not odd,
you made her odd.

33
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,680
It's you, it's just,
it's this lifestyle.

34
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,348
You need to calm down.

35
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,350
You need some stability.

36
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,853
Calm it down and you'll
meet the right girl.

37
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,122
Don't go looking
on the internet.

38
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:50,925
- Hmm.

39
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,792
You never cheat.

40
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:53,893
- Of course not.

41
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,029
What'd you take me for?

42
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,331
Anyway, we're talking about you.

43
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:02,101
- You know what?

44
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,569
You lie.

45
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,504
- No, this is you.

46
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,705
This is on you.

47
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,140
- You cheat my friend.

48
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,176
No way, anyway, cheers.

49
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,544
- Wow, cheers.

50
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,647
- For a better life.

51
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,597
Thursday, huh?

52
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,302
Show me more.

53
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:51,853
Come on, more.

54
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:21,582
Yes, I'm always
ready for a new date.

55
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:49,777
Why not tomorrow for lunch?

56
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:57,518
Bingo, yes.

57
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,796
- Hey, Ethan.

58
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,363
How are you doing?

59
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,199
What are you doing here?

60
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,400
- I'm doing well, thank you.

61
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:16,201
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,937
- You're waiting for
your date again, I guess.

63
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,538
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

64
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,174
- And this time it's
gonna be the right one.

65
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:22,977
- Hmm.

66
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,647
Well, you know, all these
dates on the internet,

67
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,016
I will never understand them.

68
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,651
- I know because you
are two old school.

69
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,153
- Yeah.

70
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:36,891
Well, I've been with my wife
for a couple of years and,

71
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:44,665
it's still crazy love,
Romeo and Juliet.

72
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,802
- Romeo and Juliet.
- Mm-hmm.

73
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,738
- The story ends badly, right?

74
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:55,274
- Yeah, yeah, it does, but
mine is still relevant.

75
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:57,076
- You're a lucky man.

76
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:58,510
- Hello?
- Oh.

77
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,179
- Are you Ethan?
- Yes.

78
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,849
- Nice to meet you.
- Same.

79
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,156
- Would you, well, maybe in
the other room would be better.

80
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,993
I'll show you, I'll
show you the other one.

81
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,398
- Glad you came.

82
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,966
- Yeah, well, with the net,

83
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,268
we always feel that
it is a fig, right?

84
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,603
- Yes.

85
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,205
Is that you, right?

86
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:27,041
- That's me.

87
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,677
So what are you looking for?

88
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:34,648
- Well, it's been for over
eight months I'm free.

89
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:37,385
- She dumped you?

90
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:39,553
- It's complicated.

91
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:42,021
- Complicated, yeah.

92
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:44,356
Well, I don't want
to waste my time.

93
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,727
I want something serious,
something solid, you know?

94
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,863
- Relax, step by step, okay?

95
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,931
- Yeah, well just
I'm tired of men

96
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,504
who only look for
one night stand.

97
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,538
- I didn't talk about sex.

98
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,307
- Yeah, just warning
you, that's all.

99
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,144
- All right.

100
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,646
What are you doing for a living?

101
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:11,285
- I just finishing my degree
and then looking for a job.

102
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,452
What about you?

103
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:15,320
- I work in the office.

104
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,156
- Oh yeah, you like it?

105
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:18,824
- Yeah, of course.

106
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,325
- Okay.

107
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,895
Well, I just had a really bad
week with my boss and my mom

108
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:25,332
and just people so
stupid and stuff.

109
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:29,802
- I really love your
white shirt, nice.

110
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,137
- My shirt, of course.

111
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,506
It's my boobs you're looking at.

112
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:34,706
- Are you serious?

113
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,546
- Yeah, I knew it, all the same.

114
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:43,516
- You act like my grandmother.

115
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,086
- Your
grandmother, really?

116
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:47,453
- Yeah.
- Why?

117
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:48,787
- She's so tight, you know?

118
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,322
- Tight?

119
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,558
Yeah, you know what?

120
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,393
Goodbye.

121
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,428
- Bitch!

122
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,699
- Hey, your girl
didn't look happy.

123
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,537
All right, I see.

124
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:05,806
- Thank you.

125
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:11,745
- I told you.

126
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,931
- Ethan, New York has
approved a project.

127
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,966
Good job, man.

128
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,301
I'm sorry about your holidays,

129
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:11,138
but you're gonna
have to cancel them.

130
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,508
- I didn't take any
plan for holidays.

131
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,142
- Oh really?

132
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:20,879
That's why you're the best
here, after me, of course.

133
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:21,715
- Of course.

134
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:27,419
Did you think about
my salary increase?

135
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,089
- Salary increase.

136
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,159
Funny guy.

137
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,397
Let me ask you a
question, Ethan.

138
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,899
Do you deserve it?

139
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,934
- Well.

140
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,235
- Do you?

141
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:44,573
- I guess.

142
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,576
- I'm just kidding.

143
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:50,976
I'm just kidding.

144
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,779
You know, it's a little
bit difficult right now,

145
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:57,983
but you'll get there,
for sure, okay?

146
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,017
- Yeah.

147
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,589
- Yeah, keep up the good work.

148
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,490
I'll see you later.

149
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:30,851
- Woman, Black Pearl.

150
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,226
Why you don't have any pictures?

151
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:53,807
Mm-hmm.

152
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:00,314
Okay.

153
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,384
Good night.

154
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,433

Eating a salad in his car.

166
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,798
- That's too much work
and I can't eat outside.

167
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,600
- Yeah, you should come
celebrating with us, man.

168
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:29,736
I mean, you're the
hero of the day.

169
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,438
That deal, mm.

170
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:33,974
I wish I made that deal.

171
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,677
But I must say that you
had a pretty good teacher

172
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,746
in the office, right?

173
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:40,847
- Yeah, of course.

174
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:43,281
- Right?
- Yeah, of course.

175
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,851
But I can't.

176
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:48,823
I have a meeting at the other
side of town and besides,

177
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,791
I have a date tonight.

178
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:52,993
I don't want to be late.

179
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:57,229
- A girl from the
internet, a girl?

180
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,765
Is it a girl?

181
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,833
- Yeah, what?

182
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,033
- Yeah, I don't know.

183
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,872
I don't know, I'm
just asking, come on.

184
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,875
You've gotta be
a class act, man.

185
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:10,877
I mean, get out, I
meet people at parties.

186
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,545
I meet people at the theater.

187
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:17,552
I don't know, concerts,
normal stuff, you know?

188
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:21,687
- Yeah, good for you.

189
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,054
- Yeah.

190
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,692
Just be normal for once.

191
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,965
You know, dating
online, never liked it.

192
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:34,032
What you gonna do?

193
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,668
Invite her home?

194
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,503
Prepare a salad?

195
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,004
Open a cheap bottle of wine?

196
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,743
That's a mistake, Ethan,
that's not how you score.

197
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,143
You should invite a lady
to a nice restaurant.

198
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,079
You can afford it.

199
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,046
Am I right?

200
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:48,883
- Yeah.

201
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:53,788
- Listen to me, I
mean, I had so many.

202
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:55,824
- Of course.

203
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,795
Speaking of which,
what about my raise?

204
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,298
- Yeah, I'm thinking about
it, Ethan, I didn't forget.

205
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,134
I didn't forget.

206
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,237
Here.

207
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,172
Where is it?

208
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:14,776
Take this.

209
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,375
Come on, it's on me.

210
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,614
Yeah and you have
fun, you have fun.

211
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,685
Oh, what a deal.

212
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,120
Okay, gotta go.

213
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,795
And please, yeah, wear a condom.

214
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,797
- Oh, thank you, boss.

215
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,965
Without you, I will be nothing.

216
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,535
- Later.

217
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,839
- Yeah, yeah, asshole.

218
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:10,696
- Well, hopefully it won't
turn out badly this time.

219
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:11,533
- Me too.

220
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:15,770
- And what's the
name of the new star?

221
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,105
- I just know her
nickname, Black Pearl.

222
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,707
- Black Pearl?
- Yeah.

223
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,945
- Black Pearl, mystery Woman.

224
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,580
Well, break a leg.

225
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,080
- Thank you.

226
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:29,918
Break a leg.

227
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:36,187

228
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,725

- Can I help you?

232
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:49,635
- Are you Ethan?

233
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,102
- Yes.

234
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:51,940
- Black Pearl.

235
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,041
- I didn't recognize you.

236
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:59,545
You wear sunglasses and
your hair is so different.

237
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:00,982
- I like to be discreet.

238
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:06,621
- You are part of FBI, secret
agent, something like that?

239
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:08,921
No worries.

240
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:10,825
I will not reveal
your identity, okay?

241
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,294
- Have you been dating
on this app for long?

242
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:16,428
- Not too much.

243
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,264
- Me too.

244
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,399
Thank you.

245
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,468
- Thank you, Christopher.

246
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,783
So what do you want to eat?

247
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,357
- I want to eat meat.

248
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,792
- Hmm, I'm vegetarian.

249
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:47,595
- Okay.

250
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:54,165
- Meat is a problem
with greenhouse effect,

251
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,401
you know, pollution.

252
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:57,237
- Oh, really?

253
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,139
- Yeah, but it's okay.

254
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,011
Eat whatever you want.

255
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,514
- Thank you, I guess.

256
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:14,654
So you said that you are
working at a office, right?

257
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,822
- Yeah, daily routine.

258
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,057
- I can imagine.

259
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,325
- And you?

260
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,927
- Well, I'm looking for a job,

261
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:25,230
but a night job because
my brother's sick,

262
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,734
so I have to take care of him.

263
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,104
- It's sad, sad to hear.

264
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,640
Hopefully this time
you will not throw

265
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:37,475
a cup of water on my face.

266
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,277
- What? What for?

267
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,113
I'm not wild.

268
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:42,282
- I'm just joking?

269
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,688
- I'll be back in a moment.

270
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,290
I'm going to the bathroom, okay?

271
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:52,593
- Take your time.

272
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,379
- Well, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

273
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,185
My brother just called
me and he's sick, so.

274
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,452
- I hope it's not too serious.

275
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,288
- I'll tell you.

276
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,322
We'll meet next time.

277
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,256
- Free.

278
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,527
- I have your number anyway, so.

279
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,294
- Okay.

280
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:30,629
- Goodbye.

281
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:31,431
- Goodbye.

282
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:50,415
Dammit, Natasha.

283
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,820
Can you imagine if
I'm naked with a girl?

284
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,456
- Ethan, you don't
reply to my message.

285
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,864
- I should never
give you a spare key.

286
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:06,331
- Yeah, but you forgot
that I am moving

287
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,666
and you had to do some DIY

288
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:10,136
in my new apartment first.

289
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:11,737
- When was that?

290
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:12,573
- Today.

291
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:17,408
- I forgot.

292
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,145
I have a lot of things
to do in my office.

293
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:20,313
A lot of paperwork.

294
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,716
- I can never count on you.

295
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:26,585
I should have hired
a renovation company.

296
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:27,622
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

297
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:30,925
- I will do it tomorrow,
okay, no worries.

298
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,560
- If you don't come
tomorrow, you will see.

299
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:36,063
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

300
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:41,133
- Now go away, go away.

301
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:42,201
Love you, sister.

302
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:43,671
- Love you too.
- Goodnight.

303
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,781
My man.

304
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:56,615
- You're all right.

305
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:57,448
Do you want a drink?

306
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,617
Do you want coffee?

307
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,919
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

308
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:03,656
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

309
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:04,491
Black Pearl.

310
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,292
- Black Pearl what?

311
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:07,695
- She disappeared?

312
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:14,233
- Yeah? Well, you know what?

313
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:17,402
Seems to me I've already seen
her before in this restaurant,

314
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,239
to be honest.

315
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:21,372
- No, she's unique.

316
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:24,375
- No, I assure you,
as far as I remember,

317
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,247
always around the
same time she came.

318
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,618
- Oh, wait a minute.

319
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,154
- Don't
tell me it's her.

320
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,088
- Yes.

321
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,422
10:30 tonight.

322
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,991
- There, you go, lucky man.

323
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:42,294
- Yeah, I told
you, she's unique.

324
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:44,063
I want my coffee, man.

325
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:45,430
- Oh yeah, forgot.

326
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,399
- Thank you.

327
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,289
- Hey.
- Hey.

328
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:20,101
I am happy to see
you, you disappear.

329
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:25,403
- Look, my life is complicated.

330
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,240
I need time.

331
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,342
- I understand.

332
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:31,512
- My brother is getting worse.

333
00:23:33,014 --> 00:23:33,814
He might die.

334
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,784
- I'm sorry.

335
00:23:38,152 --> 00:23:38,986
Too bad.

336
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,557
But I will wait for you, okay?

337
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,260
But not all my life.

338
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,995
- You wanna go for a walk?

339
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,997
- Yeah, sure, let's do this.

340
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:12,820
Sorry, but I'll
not eat meat, okay?

341
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:18,125
I love animals and I don't
know, for since I was young,

342
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:24,497
I never be attracted
about it, you know?

343
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,601
- I'll change your mind.

344
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,905
- Are you sure you
will change my mind?

345
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,473
- I'm
pretty sure, yeah.

346
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:39,213
- We'll see.

347
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:45,586
But I'm lucky you
are beautiful woman.

348
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:03,302
What are you doing?

349
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:51,385
What is this nightmare?

350
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,361
Shit.

351
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:16,075
What have you done to me?

352
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:16,911
Bitch!

353
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:34,762
- Are you kidding me, Ethan?

354
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:38,265
What the fuck?

355
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,067
- What do you mean?

356
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:43,268
- We had the meeting with
New York this morning

357
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,539
and you didn't show up.

358
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,476
- I forgot.

359
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:50,311
- You forgot?

360
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:54,313
I looked like a
fool because of you.

361
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:56,817
I was lucky that Rebecca
knew the file perfectly.

362
00:26:59,554 --> 00:27:00,719
- It's Vanessa, by the way.

363
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:03,655
- I don't give a shit, okay?

364
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:06,327
I pay you to do
your job, so do it!

365
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:09,663
- Yes sir.

366
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:12,865
I will do my best.

367
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,570
- Yeah, do more than your best.

368
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:18,607
Don't ever do that
to me again, Ethan.

369
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:20,741
Understood?

370
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:37,124
- Hey, Ethan.

371
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:41,594
How is it going, my friend?

372
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:42,728
Huh?

373
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,762
- Not so well.

374
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:44,597
- Not so well?

375
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,031
Why, what's the matter?

376
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,634
- I'm looking for Black pearl.

377
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,502
- Black Pearl, come
on Black Pearl.

378
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:51,105
I thought you guys just met.

379
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:54,806
Hey, what's with the glasses?

380
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:57,743
Hey, are you chased by
the police or something?

381
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,745
- No, she assault me.

382
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:00,979
- Assaulted you?

383
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:02,149
What'd you mean,
she assaulted you?

384
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:04,850
Huh?

385
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,753
- She bit me, she
drank my blood.

386
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,824
- She bit and drank your,
come on, man, show me.

387
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:19,965
Come on, man.

388
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:22,069
It's just a fucking hickey.

389
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,541
Come on, you know, it's
a love bite, you know?

390
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:28,907
Hey, what's the matter with you?

391
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,876
Hey, how much booze did
you drink yesterday, huh?

392
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,010
- Nothing, nothing.

393
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:33,414
It wasn't a dream.

394
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:37,749
- Hey man, you're just hungover.

395
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:41,420
Hey, take an aspirin,
drink lots of water.

396
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:42,921
You'll be fine tomorrow.

397
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,992
- No, it's not hangover.

398
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,128
It's something else.

399
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:51,930
If you are my friend,
you have to believe me.

400
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:52,866
- Yeah, yeah.

401
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:57,404
I believe you, but Ethan, Ethan.

402
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:00,341
Ethan, come back.

403
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,511
Ethan, you're just in love, huh?

404
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,447
That's what you are, come on.

405
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:28,035
- There is something
strange with this woman.

406
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:34,141
I met her twice and
the last, she bit me.

407
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:41,882
I don't know her
real name, actually.

408
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:46,320
- I told you before, the
internet is dangerous.

409
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:51,892
Did you go back to the bar
where you first met her?

410
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:57,898
- Yeah, apparently she
came back with another man.

411
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,432
- See, this why this
woman is dangerous.

412
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:01,835
She's looking for something.

413
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:07,341
- Oh.

414
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:11,476
Light bother me.

415
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:19,851
- She could be a bloody
serial killer for all we know.

416
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:23,388
Single men have gone missing
over the last six months.

417
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,626
Do you not watched the TV?

418
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:31,531
- I'm sorry, no, I'm
too busy at work.

419
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:32,333
Sorry, pal.

420
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:38,105
- You do look a bit pal, unwell.

421
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:43,175
What I'm gonna do, I'm
gonna leave you to rest

422
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:46,213
and I'll pop back later, see
if you're okay, all right?

423
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:50,752
- I must find out,
this Black Pearl.

424
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:04,666
- So, you met that woman
on internet, right?

425
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:08,737
- Yeah, Black Pearl.

426
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:11,673
- Is it a name?

427
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,007
More details?

428
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:17,077
- Just a nickname.

429
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:20,981
Ah, yes, she had a sick brother.

430
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,587
- No name, no address.

431
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:29,289
Do you mind taking
off your glasses?

432
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,324
- No, I'm sorry, I
can't stand the light.

433
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:33,528
It's too bright in here.

434
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:37,998
- Okay, you met that woman.

435
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:41,736
You must have a phone
number, on email.

436
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:52,747
- Phone is down and she
don't reply to any email.

437
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:55,449
- Oh, I see.

438
00:31:58,653 --> 00:31:59,987
We have a ghost woman.

439
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,124
- Look.

440
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:06,293
She bit me.

441
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,330
- Is this a joke?

442
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,202
You may have time for
joking, but I don't.

443
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,206
Maybe a few hours in
custody would help you.

444
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,709
Sporty man like you
supposed to defend himself

445
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:27,147
against a pretty woman
or she's Wonder Woman.

446
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:34,188
- She bit me, I pass out
and I wake up at home.

447
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:39,259
- Your home? Okay.

448
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:45,997
So you're complaining for a
assault committed by a woman

449
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:49,436
that you still don't
know without any
traces of aggression.

450
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:52,439
Really?

451
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:57,077
I don't like wasting
my time, sir.

452
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:00,378
If you're on drugs,
you need a rehab

453
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,249
or it's gonna be
straight to the cell.

454
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,222
- I'm not crazy, okay?

455
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:13,091
I'm not feeling good
since she assault me.

456
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:17,128
Ask the owner of the
restaurant, Christopher Kessler.

457
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,500
That's where I have
a dinner with her.

458
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:22,570
- If you don't feel
well, go see a doctor.

459
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:26,037
- I got mugged.

460
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,138
What are the police for?

461
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,010
If not, help the victims.

462
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:36,149
- Okay, I'm gonna look into
this case more closely,

463
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:41,421
but you have to understand there
is no crime and no suspect.

464
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,391
It's not gonna be easy.

465
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:49,129
- I'm not a liar.

466
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:51,265
Not feel good.

467
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:55,168
- Got your number.

468
00:33:57,404 --> 00:34:00,207
If there's something
new, we'll tell you.

469
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:02,644
Have a good day, sir.

470
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:33,639
- You know what?

471
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,175
I was sure you wouldn't show up.

472
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:38,780
- I have one word.

473
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:41,479
I'm your brother.

474
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,818
- Yeah, yeah, and I
really appreciate that.

475
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,619
Ethan.

476
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:47,653
- Hmm?

477
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:48,923
- You are hungover.

478
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,824
- No.
- Yeah?

479
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:53,795
- No.
- I'm not judging you.

480
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,868
- I think I feel a
little bit weird.

481
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,705
- Okay.

482
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,808
- And I need to see a doctor.

483
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:14,082
On top of that, at
work, it's crazy.

484
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,449
- Yeah, your boss is a real jerk

485
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,454
and I don't understand
why you don't resign.

486
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:23,923
Hey, you can trust me.

487
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:24,892
I am not mad.

488
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:28,696
And what about your date?

489
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:30,898
Where did you meet her?

490
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,133
Online?

491
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:35,036
- Yes.

492
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,506
- And?

493
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:41,909
- I'm not sure, she
hurt me, bit me.

494
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:46,413
- You are crazy.

495
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:51,149
Okay, start by helping
your sister first.

496
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,688
- I need to learn
more about women.

497
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:55,857
I'm naive.

498
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:58,960
- I have something for you.

499
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,328
I don't need it.

500
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,597
- How did you get that?

501
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,766
- In the box.

502
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:07,700
- Wow.

503
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,904
- It's old memory from grandpa.

504
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:12,774
It's quite big here.

505
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:21,914
Okay.

506
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:24,418
- Family is important.
- Yeah.

507
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:29,220
Okay, you can put,
it's right here, okay?

508
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:31,157
- Okay, gotta go, bye-bye.

509
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,426
- Bye, see you.

510
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:16,969
- You didn't find that bitch?

511
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:19,404
I know she's saw guys few times.

512
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,207
I want to know what she
knows about last night

513
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:23,142
of my brother's life.

514
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:24,677
It's not normal.

515
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,748
Go back to the bar, okay?

516
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:45,490
- Hey, what's with
the sunglasses?

517
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,563
- I'm sorry, I'm very
sensitive with the light now.

518
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:51,897
- Anyway, picked up this book.

519
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:54,001
I think you are find
it quite interesting.

520
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:59,040
It's all about female
vampires, lost for all time.

521
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:05,947
- Do you really think
this woman is a vampire?

522
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:08,950
- Of course not.

523
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,020
- Dammit.

524
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,642
I'll change everything.

525
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:38,713
I'm pretty sure, yeah.

526
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:14,682
Ethan.

527
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,935
Kill him.

528
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:23,237
Daniel, I know it's early,
but I'm losing control.

529
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,779
I don't know what's going on.

530
00:43:34,315 --> 00:43:36,585
I need your help,
please, right now.

531
00:43:48,062 --> 00:43:51,730
- Brother, you're getting worse.

532
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,132
I know how much
you hate hospitals,

533
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:54,536
but you must see a doctor.

534
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,872
- I don't have the flu.

535
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,876
Everything comes
from this woman.

536
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,110
You know how much I'm
scared of needles.

537
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:08,115
- Talking about this woman,
it was on the news last night.

538
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:11,083
Woman matching the same
description as Black Pearl

539
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:12,720
is now wanted by the police.

540
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:15,588
- Tell me more.

541
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:19,158
- 25 Year old man
found dead in his car.

542
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,662
Woman matching her description
was noticed nearby.

543
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:33,972
- I think I did terrible
things last night.

544
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:34,942
- What do you mean?

545
00:44:38,613 --> 00:44:39,947
- I'm a vampire.

546
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:44,885
- What bloody are
you talking about?

547
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:50,057
- You have to believe me.

548
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:53,127
I'm not thirsty now.

549
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:58,764
But I can't control my anger.

550
00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:00,734
- Ethan, look at me.

551
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,169
There's no such
thing as vampires.

552
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:05,839
They do not exist.

553
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:11,812
- Please, go away,
leave me alone.

554
00:45:13,515 --> 00:45:17,082
- Okay, I don't know exactly
what's going on with you.

555
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:18,817
I'm gonna find out more
about this Black Pearl.

556
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:20,886
You just stay with
me, do you hear me?

557
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,022
You stay with me.

558
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:28,262
- Go away, go away.

559
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:52,217
- Right.

560
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,053
What time?

561
00:45:57,525 --> 00:45:58,359
- Hi.

562
00:46:02,664 --> 00:46:03,797
- Thanks, bye.

563
00:46:08,502 --> 00:46:09,604
- I'm Detective Dewey.

564
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:14,308
I'm looking for a woman
reported for assault.

565
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:19,780
Early 20s, maybe
less, mixed race.

566
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,116
Does that sound familiar?

567
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:25,185
- Oh, mixed race.

568
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:32,326
Oh yeah, you mean Black Pearl.

569
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:35,127
Yeah, she's been
here a few times,

570
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:39,164
but I haven't seen
her for a few days.

571
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,301
- Black Pearl, you say?

572
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:44,136
You don't know her surname?

573
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:47,274
First name, a credit
card taken, maybe?

574
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:52,545
- She was always the the
one being invited, you see,

575
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:55,717
so, no, sorry.

576
00:46:58,218 --> 00:46:59,752
- Make an effort.

577
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:01,155
You must have checked her ID.

578
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:05,560
- I didn't.

579
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:08,628
- Do I have to remind
you that it's illegal

580
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,331
to sell alcohol to minors?

581
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:12,765
It will be a shame
to have to close down

582
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,299
this fine establishment.

583
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:16,705
It turns out you were
selling alcohol to anyone.

584
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:21,039
- Hey, come on, Detective,
this is not an nightclub,

585
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,176
this is a restaurant.

586
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:25,479
Why would I check her ID?

587
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:29,682
She never asked for
alcohol in the first place.

588
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:32,084
So, who's the suspect here?

589
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:34,488
Is it me or is it her?

590
00:47:35,824 --> 00:47:38,056
- She's the one
we're looking for,

591
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:41,495
but so far all I
have is a code name,

592
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:45,130
unless you prefer
a long existent

593
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:47,868
description matching
hundreds of women.

594
00:47:49,504 --> 00:47:52,707
- Sorry sir, I really can't
help you any more than that.

595
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,110
- If you ever see her
again, let me know,

596
00:47:58,112 --> 00:48:00,513
if of course this
Black Pearl does exist.

597
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:02,449
- Yeah, she does, I saw her.

598
00:48:03,618 --> 00:48:05,886
- Sorry to have wasted
your time and mine.

599
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:08,721
- Have a good day, sir.

600
00:48:08,723 --> 00:48:09,557
- Have a good day.

601
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:05,145
- Seriously?

602
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,949
You wear sunglasses
at the office now.

603
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:11,784
Did you get your ass kicked?

604
00:49:11,786 --> 00:49:12,620
- No.

605
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:16,288
I'm here to pick
up some documents

606
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,624
and I will work on it at home.

607
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:19,991
- What?

608
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:22,260
No, you're gonna stay here

609
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:24,329
and you're gonna work
on the New York here.

610
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:25,733
That's what you're gonna do.

611
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,433
- You misunderstand me.

612
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,638
- That's not how it
works here, okay?

613
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,406
I am your boss and I commend you

614
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:36,143
to sit at your desk right now.

615
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:38,477
Okay?

616
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:41,046
- Oh, fuck you.

617
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:42,582
- Fuck me?

618
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:47,419
No, fuck you, man.

619
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:48,422
You're fired.

620
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:54,529
- You're lucky I'm
not thirsty right.

621
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,064
- Thirsty?

622
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:00,833
What the fuck are you
even talking about?

623
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:03,168
You are completely
out of your mind.

624
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,804
You're a freak.

625
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:06,238
Can't you see that?

626
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,273
Just gather your things.

627
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:11,378
I'll see you on the
pavement, sucker.

628
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:15,950
Fuck you.

629
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:05,165
- Ethan?

630
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:08,970
I'll change.

631
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,241
- Natasha.
- Yeah.

632
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:19,547
- You can't come
to my house anymore.

633
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:38,229
- Ethan, I don't understand
anything anymore.

634
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:39,067
What is it?

635
00:51:41,368 --> 00:51:43,170
- You are not going
to believe me.

636
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:49,611
Do you remember
my date last week?

637
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:54,145
- Yeah, mysterious woman.

638
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:55,917
- Mysterious woman, yes.

639
00:51:57,785 --> 00:51:58,953
- What mysterious woman?

640
00:52:01,022 --> 00:52:04,525
- She bit and now
I'm fucked, fucked.

641
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:12,499
I'm a vampire.

642
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:16,638
- Is this a joke?

643
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:19,772
- No, it's not.

644
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:20,608
Please.

645
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:38,660
Tell mom and dad I love them.

646
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:43,029
- No, it's not possible, Ethan.

647
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:43,863
- No.

648
00:52:43,865 --> 00:52:44,930
- You will were able to-

649
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:46,732
- Stay far from me, please.

650
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:49,035
You're not safe here.

651
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:50,603
Go away.

652
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:51,737
- I am scared, call me.

653
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:52,540
- Go! Go!

654
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:58,713
- I love you.

655
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:03,117
- Fucking Black Pearl.

656
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:06,688
I swear I kill you.

657
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,102
- Yes, I got him, boss.

658
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:47,181
So, you wake up?

659
00:55:50,218 --> 00:55:51,152
- What the?

660
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:53,521
Why I'm here?

661
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:56,591
I don't know you.

662
00:55:59,627 --> 00:56:01,729
- Do you know Black Pearl?

663
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,399
- Yes, this woman is a monster.

664
00:56:07,335 --> 00:56:10,703
She made my life hell.

665
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:13,305
- Black Pearl is
surly part of a cult.

666
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:15,776
Draining blood from a
human body is a cult ritual

667
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:20,679
and you must be part of it
because you are still alive.

668
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:22,214
- Me?

669
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:24,250
Being a of a sect?

670
00:56:24,252 --> 00:56:25,851
Are you crazy?

671
00:56:25,853 --> 00:56:27,387
I'm looking for her too.

672
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:31,993
- My brother died
drained of his blood.

673
00:56:33,261 --> 00:56:34,262
It's her, for sure.

674
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:38,498
- Oh yeah, I'm sure it is.

675
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:41,969
- You were the last us her.

676
00:56:43,604 --> 00:56:46,841
So are you going to
tell me where she is?

677
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:51,579
Look, my passion has limit.

678
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:54,982
I'm giving you a chance
to tell me everything,

679
00:56:55,816 --> 00:56:56,784
then you can leave.

680
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:04,323
- You kidnapped
the wrong person.

681
00:57:04,325 --> 00:57:09,330
This woman is a vampire
and she made me a monster.

682
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:14,602
- You take me for fool.

683
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,104
You want to protect your girl.

684
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:21,073
It's up to you.

685
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:24,376
You will stay here without
food and without drink.

686
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:25,746
It will help you speak.

687
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:31,417
- I advise you to
not stay next to me.

688
00:57:31,419 --> 00:57:33,120
- You advise me nothing, okay?

689
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:35,556
What will you do?

690
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:38,991
Turn into a bat and bite me?

691
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:44,163
Tell me what I want to know.

692
00:57:44,165 --> 00:57:45,566
Make it for, yes.

693
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,772
- I will get you Black Pearl.

694
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:32,446
Fucking girl.

695
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,636
- Look at this guy.

696
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:42,883
- No, no, no, no, no!

697
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:38,973
- Now, you will believe
in vampire, my friend.

698
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,309
- Keep going.

699
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:18,979
You can stay here, keep going.

700
01:01:44,071 --> 01:01:45,139
- I told you.

701
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:50,477
do not come back.

702
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:52,647
- Help me.

703
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:16,930
Okay, this is it.

704
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:38,580
- Ethan, Ethan, is that you?

705
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:45,486
Oh my.

706
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:48,055
You're a monster.

707
01:04:49,524 --> 01:04:50,958
- Stay away from me.

708
01:04:54,763 --> 01:04:59,768
Do you have good news
for me about Black Pearl?

709
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:03,103
- No, not found anything yet.

710
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:07,609
- So,

711
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:11,078
go away.

712
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:16,618
I'm not human anymore.

713
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:28,460
- You don't wanna do this.

714
01:05:28,462 --> 01:05:30,295
You don't wanna do this.

715
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:31,666
- You're a traitor!

716
01:05:33,868 --> 01:05:36,101
- Black Pearl chose
you for a reason.

717
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:39,639
I don't know the reason, but
I will find out, I promise.

718
01:05:42,075 --> 01:05:44,309
This is for my protection only.

719
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:49,316
- Oh!

720
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:04,229
- I won't give up on you,
Ethan, I won't give up on you.

721
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:06,431
I will not give
up on you, Ethan.

722
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,868
I just pray I'm not too late.

723
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,872
I pray I'm not too late.

724
01:08:01,683 --> 01:08:05,851
- Kill him.

725
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:08,854
- Help! Help! Help!

726
01:09:07,015 --> 01:09:10,382
- What the fuck?

727
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:13,318
Cool, man.

728
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,089
Who the fuck are you?

729
01:09:23,598 --> 01:09:24,498
Stop, stop.

730
01:09:42,116 --> 01:09:43,117
Who are you?

731
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:49,624
- I told you I am a good friend.

732
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:16,416
You stink.

733
01:10:23,191 --> 01:10:25,193
You're gonna pay up now.

734
01:10:51,519 --> 01:10:56,122
You're one of us now.

735
01:10:56,124 --> 01:10:58,425
We'll meet next time.
- Stop.

736
01:11:00,595 --> 01:11:02,862
I don't want to hear.

737
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:05,030
I don't want to hear that.

738
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:26,340
At last we meet again.

739
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:33,381
You have to tell me why
you are doing this to me

740
01:13:35,482 --> 01:13:37,151
and I will kill you.

741
01:13:42,323 --> 01:13:47,128
- 200 years ago, your ancestors
tracked down the master

742
01:13:48,729 --> 01:13:50,631
relentlessly to try to kill him.

743
01:13:54,068 --> 01:13:55,937
I have chosen you, Ethan.

744
01:13:57,371 --> 01:13:59,872
The less distant have
the vampire slayers

745
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:01,742
to enter our family.

746
01:14:03,978 --> 01:14:06,013
The master will
have his revenge.

747
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:11,419
The one who's stalked
is now vampire.

748
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:22,530
- I have nothing to do with it.

749
01:14:24,031 --> 01:14:25,800
Give me my life back.

750
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:31,706
- We're not gonna
be the last ones.

751
01:14:32,707 --> 01:14:33,975
You're one of us now.

752
01:14:44,352 --> 01:14:46,087
- I don't deserve it.

753
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:51,659
- Enjoy mortality.

754
01:14:55,429 --> 01:14:57,164
It's a precious gift.

755
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:04,572
