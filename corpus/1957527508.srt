00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:42,733
I can see that.

186
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,102
You just calmed
down, all right.

187
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,304
Now what we need
is you to collect

188
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,206
some flat pieces of wood.

189
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,207
Can you do that?

190
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,342
Emily.

191
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,477
Emily, make yourself useful,

192
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,912
go and help your mom.

193
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,470
Is that gonna hold it?

194
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:20,437
No, obviously not.

195
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:22,339
This is a wrong jack.

196
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,274
God damn it.

197
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:29,446
Just put those under the tire.

198
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,181
Why don't we just call AAA.

199
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,151
I'm kidding.

200
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:35,953
Okay, where are those
plaid pieces of wood

201
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:36,453
I told you to get?

202
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:37,321
I got them.

203
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:45,162
Yeah, in the front.

204
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:46,997
Yeah, that's great.

205
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,031
That's great.

206
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,467
Okay, now go.

207
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,002
Go get behind the wheel.

208
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:54,104
Am I in your way?

209
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:58,409
Okay, when I tell
you start the engine.

210
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:02,045
Okay.

211
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,550
Put it in drive.

212
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,518
Now?

213
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:08,552
Put it in drive.

214
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,454
Alright, okay, alright.

215
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:12,356
Fuck.

216
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:15,459
Ready.

217
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,060
And then when I say go...

218
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,029
When you say go, I got it.

219
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:20,030
I go, right?

220
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:21,198
I'm gonna tell you,

221
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:24,301
you just ease into
the gas pedal, okay?

222
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:27,738
Almost there.

223
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,039
Okay, that's good.

224
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:33,076
Now just slowly easy.

225
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,580
Keep going.

226
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,549
Halt it.

227
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:42,754
Okay.

228
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,021
I just wanna get out of here.

229
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:44,988
I just wanna go home.

230
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,023
I wanna get home,

231
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:46,523
I wanna get home.

232
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,258
Make us be home.

233
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,328
The other side is worse.

234
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,262
Okay, ready.

235
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:55,966
Dad.

236
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,435
Easy on the gas.

237
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:11,381
Mom!

238
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:13,283
What?

239
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,251
[Emily] Grandpa's hurt.

240
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:15,152
Shit.

241
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:17,521
How bad?

242
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:19,056
Mom, help him.

243
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:20,524
Oh dad, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

244
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:21,558
It's not your fault.

245
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:23,627
Emily, go get
the first aid kit.

246
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,128
Oh geez.

247
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,263
Oh, don't look at
it, don't look at it.

248
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:27,431
Just keep pressure on it.

249
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:28,499
Hurry up, Emily.

250
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,570
There's nothing here.

251
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:37,040
Well then just grab a
towel or T-shirt, anything.

252
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:42,513
Oh my God, here.

253
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,281
Emily, help me get him up.

254
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:45,549
We're gonna help you up dad.

255
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,321
Okay, dad, we're
gonna sit you down.

256
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:54,558
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

257
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,360
You can handle this.

258
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:57,528
No, I can't.

259
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:02,099
Oh God.

260
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:07,504
I don't know what to do.

261
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,072
What about the guy?

262
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:11,041
Maybe he has a phone
out here that works.

263
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:15,245
Okay, we'll wait
until he comes back.

264
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,513
If you're not gonna
do anything about it,

265
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:17,548
then I'm gonna go.

266
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:18,248
You're not going
anywhere, Emily I'm mean it.

267
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:20,651
Can you two stop bickering?

268
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,321
Emily, hand me some water.

269
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:25,222
Here.

270
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:28,091
Take a sip.

271
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:28,625
There you go.

272
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,597
How are you feeling?

273
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,165
I've had better days.

274
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,700
Emily, you are not going.

275
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,435
Why?

276
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:41,371
Because you're
not, that's why.

277
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,606
We need to be here for him.

278
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:45,142
Give me your phone.

279
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,612
When was the last
time you had a signal?

280
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:49,179
I don't know.

281
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:50,213
Give me your phone.

282
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,186
What are you doing?

283
00:13:56,219 --> 00:14:01,091
I am going to go up here
and see what I can see.

284
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,427
Okay.

285
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,438
Shit.

286
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:15,439
What do you see mom?

287
00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:18,609
Three people stranded in
a stupid forest, maybe?

288
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:28,251
[car horn honking]

289
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,521
That's your idea?

290
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:33,724
This will get his attention.

291
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:35,492
We're gonna die.

292
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,593
Why can't you just
take control...

293
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,495
[car horn honking]

294
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,163
Mom, this is really
the dumbest thing...

295
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:41,933
[car horn honking]

296
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,533
Did you find this in
the survival guide,

297
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:44,735
because this is not surviving.

298
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,503
- [car horn honking]
- I can't hear you.

299
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:47,571
- [car horn honking]
- What is this gonna do?

300
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:48,438
[car horn honking]

301
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,374
Who are you trying
to let hear this?

302
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:53,343
[car horn honking]

303
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:08,392
I guess we're camping now, huh?

304
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:09,292
Yep.

305
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,397
I mean, if that landowner
was anywhere nearby,

306
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,531
he would've heard the horn.

307
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:18,635
I don't think he would
hear a horn from a mile away.

308
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,540
I'm gonna go fix
us some dinner.

309
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,710
I'm not really hungry.

310
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,545
Okay.

311
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:37,587
I'll go look for
him in the morning.

312
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,360
You know, I
think you should do

313
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:45,462
what your mother thinks is best.

314
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:48,598
She's scared.

315
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:49,767
She can't handle this.

316
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,771
You know, she's a lot
tougher than you think.

317
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:58,208
I don't know about that.

318
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:05,649
You'd be surprised.

319
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:06,683
Here, sweetie.

320
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:16,493
Tomorrow morning,

321
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:20,731
you two should start walking
back to the main road.

322
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:24,434
It's about seven, eight miles.

323
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,338
Why don't we get
a good night's sleep

324
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,307
and we'll figure it
out in the morning.

325
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:34,244
Sounds good to me.

326
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,762
What are you doing?

327
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:53,630
Well, maybe that
man will see the smoke

328
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:54,832
and come back.

329
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,770
How'd you sleep?

330
00:16:58,803 --> 00:16:59,669
What sleep?

331
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,906
It was freezing.

332
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:02,807
I know.

333
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:06,844
What are we gonna do?

334
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:11,381
I'm not sure, but we
can't leave him alone.

335
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:16,553
Well, I think one of us
should go look for help.

336
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:19,556
What we should do is wait
and see if he comes back

337
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,525
or try and fix the RV.

338
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,929
Let's just wait a
little while longer.

339
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,630
I don't think so, mom.

340
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,801
You disagree with
everything I say so.

341
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:30,835
No I don't.

342
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:33,938
You just did it.

343
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:34,872
What are you afraid of?

344
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:36,540
We already tried all of that.

345
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:38,408
I just don't think
we should separate.

346
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,510
It could make things worse.

347
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:41,779
That wound is serious.

348
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,782
Do you think I
don't know that?

349
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:47,317
I just think doing
nothing is not a plan.

350
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:50,487
Okay, things just
don't fix themselves.

351
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,458
We're never gonna get out
of here with you in charge.

352
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:12,576
Oh my God.

353
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:13,443
Daddy, breathe.

354
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:14,444
Just breathe.

355
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:14,979
Dad, breathe.

356
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,546
Emily, get my bag.

357
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,414
Get my bag.

358
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:18,615
It's in the back.

359
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,618
Daddy, breathe.

360
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:23,788
Quick, quick, quick.

361
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:25,957
Give me some water.

362
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,758
Here daddy, take these.

363
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:28,658
Take these.

364
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:30,427
Hurry up, hurry up.

365
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,595
Water.

366
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:32,462
Here, here.

367
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:33,496
Okay.

368
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,703
[moans]

369
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:48,545

Emily's gonna stay here with you

376

and I am gonna go walk
up the road a mile

377

and see if I can
find that landowner.

378
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:17,842
And you better
be really careful.

is the best idea?

384

Do you want me to go?

385
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:33,523
No, I do not want you to go.

Enough with the

00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,510
I'm not checking his pocket.

559
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:02,013
Please, I just walked a thousand
miles through the woods.

560
00:36:02,046 --> 00:36:03,881
Would you just
check his pockets?

561
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:06,583
Come on, the longer you
take the longer we're here.

562
00:36:08,618 --> 00:36:10,054
Hurry up.

563
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,588
Which pocket?

564
00:36:11,621 --> 00:36:12,489
All of them?

565
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:14,825
Oh, God.

566
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,598
Oh, for Christ's
sake take this.

567
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:38,515
Oh, God who keeps her
keys in the back pocket?

568
00:36:38,548 --> 00:36:39,549
Go

569
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:40,450
Okay.

570
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:43,586
[Emily] Hurry, mom.

571
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,881
No, no, no.

572
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:14,584
Stupid ass truck.

574
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:57,762
What are you doing?

575
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:59,764
My mom will be back
soon with the police.

576
00:37:59,797 --> 00:38:01,631
Did she go back to the house?

577
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:02,565
Did she?

578
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,600
Maybe.

579
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:05,936
If she did she's in danger.

580
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,737
She shouldn't be there.

581
00:38:07,772 --> 00:38:08,839
What kind of danger?

582
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:11,741
Stop moving.

583
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:14,879
I've done nothing to hurt you?

584
00:38:14,912 --> 00:38:15,880
He's dangerous.

585
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:18,581
You don't know
what you're doing.

586
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:21,751
I don't care
what you say, sir.

587
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:25,823
You move again,
and I'll shoot you.

588
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:45,109
Oh my God.

589
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,112
Did you find my sister?

590
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:50,147
No, I didn't find her yet.

591
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:53,184
Does he keep a gas can

592
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:54,852
in the house somewhere?

593
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:56,586
The truck is on empty.

594
00:38:57,788 --> 00:38:58,721
In the basement.

595
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:01,892
I was afraid you'd say that.

596
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:05,728
Let me see this thing.

597
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:08,799
This is welded.

598
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:14,671
Listen, I'm gonna
go get a knife.

599
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:15,873
I'm gonna cut you
out of this thing.

600
00:39:15,906 --> 00:39:18,608
I promise I'll be right back.

601
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:47,838
Hello?

602
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:49,206

[eerie music]

606
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:27,871
I got it.

607
00:41:29,073 --> 00:41:30,774
Where's my sister?

608
00:41:30,808 --> 00:41:31,375
I didn't see her down there.

609
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:32,943
I'm so sorry.

610
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:37,314
No, no, you're a liar.

611
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:38,916
I'm not lying,
she wasn't there.

612
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:39,984
You're a liar.

613
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:40,985
I'm not lying.

614
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:41,885
[Andrew] You're a liar.

615
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:42,553
Andrew.

Andrew, come back.

619
00:42:03,307 --> 00:42:05,876
Come back, it's
not safe out there.

620
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:07,144
Andrew.

621
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:09,947
[dramatic music]

622
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:25,896
Came into my house.

623
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:34,838
Came into my house.

624
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:41,312
Now, he's gone.

625
00:42:49,353 --> 00:42:51,322
They came into my house.

626
00:42:55,392 --> 00:42:56,994
What the hell are
you doing here, lady?

627
00:42:57,027 --> 00:42:58,062
Who are you?

628
00:42:59,163 --> 00:43:01,165
You know, he's gone
because of you.

629
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:03,267
He's gone because of you.

630
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:36,367
Who are you?

631
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:38,435
I'm his mother.

632
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:41,138
What are you doing here?

633
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:42,673
I just came for help.

634
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:44,041
I'm camping nearby

635
00:43:44,074 --> 00:43:45,476
and there was an accident.

636
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,913
Oh, but you had to
break into my house?

637
00:43:49,947 --> 00:43:50,681
I didn't break in.

638
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,116
I swear the door was open.

639
00:43:52,149 --> 00:43:53,384
So you just walked right in?

640
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:54,418
Who else is with you?

641
00:43:56,153 --> 00:43:57,221
It's just me and my father

642
00:43:57,254 --> 00:43:58,222
and he needs an ambulance.

643
00:43:58,255 --> 00:43:59,089
Please, that's all,

644
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:00,157
we just need some help.

645
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,496
Well, we'll get to that.

646
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:08,132
No, you don't understand,

647
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:09,933
he's gonna die if
he doesn't get help.

648
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:11,402
Please just let me go.

649
00:44:11,435 --> 00:44:13,170
Let me go.

650
00:44:13,203 --> 00:44:15,072
Oh, calm yourself.

651
00:44:17,174 --> 00:44:21,111
You know, I really
would like to trust you.

652
00:44:21,145 --> 00:44:22,279
I really would.

653
00:44:22,312 --> 00:44:23,547
It would make things
so much easier,

654
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,283
but you've seen Andrew.

655
00:44:26,316 --> 00:44:28,085
What did he say to you?

656
00:44:28,118 --> 00:44:29,219
Why does that matter?

657
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:33,924
It matters to you.

658
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:40,330
He wants to see his sister.

659
00:44:41,565 --> 00:44:44,435
His sister died years ago.

660
00:44:44,468 --> 00:44:48,272
My only son is out
there because of you.

00:44:48,305 --> 00:44:50,140
He's my only son.

662

I don't know what I will
do if he doesn't come back.

663
00:44:54,144 --> 00:44:55,045
And I blame you.

I blame you.

May I have some water, please?

666
00:45:05,355 --> 00:45:06,990
Okay, I'm gonna need
you to move over here

667
00:45:07,024 --> 00:45:08,992
so I can see you
when I go get it.

668
00:45:09,026 --> 00:45:11,763
I can't.

669
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:15,299
Untie me, I can help
you get out of here.

00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,369
I'm not as naive as I look.

Please, let me
have some water.

00:45:32,516 --> 00:45:34,251
Don't kick me.

00:45:35,385 --> 00:45:37,120
I'll let you bake out here.

Where's your mom?

She'll be back.

Okay.

Andrew, stop.

Who are you?

685
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:36,680
Don't shoot, he's my nephew.

686
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:37,548
He's sick.

687
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:39,316
No, you poison me.

688
00:46:42,252 --> 00:46:44,421
Don't just stand
there, help me.

689
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:45,322
Help me.

Go away.

[Andrew] I just
need to talk to you.

What do you want from us?

695
00:48:02,399 --> 00:48:03,266
I'm hungry.

00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:06,403
There's nothing here for you.

It's really cold
out here, please.

I'm not opening the door.

699
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:14,144
So just leave, okay?

700
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,547
Go.

701
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:12,269

I didn't mean to scare you.

I know where she is.

Your mother, I mean.

She's at my house
with my sister.

I'm sorry that I
broke your window.

I didn't mean to scare you.

You killed somebody.

00:51:16,459 --> 00:51:17,327
I had to.

They poison me.

I wouldn't hurt you.

00:51:25,837 --> 00:51:26,736
Can you please come out?

Yeah, I don't think so.

It's getting cold in here.

thrown a rock through the window

with the lights on.

You hungry?

00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:06,978
You want some food?

728
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:13,985
Okay, well I'll just put
it over here for later.

00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:20,992
You know, I just feel awful

730
00:52:21,025 --> 00:52:22,960
about the way this
whole thing started.

I mean, I can imagine
what you must be thinking,

we need to get him some help.

Well, tell me where
the campsite is.

I can send my husband.

I mean, the hospital
is 30 miles away.

737

Why can't you
just call for help?

738
00:52:43,848 --> 00:52:46,951
Well, I could, but where
would they look for them?

I mean, look, it's
pitch black outside.

better than we do.

We'll find him first.

00:52:54,557 --> 00:52:56,794
How would I know
you wouldn't hurt him?

743
00:52:56,827 --> 00:52:58,595
If we would've heard anybody,

744
00:52:58,628 --> 00:52:59,729
we would've hurt you.

745
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,068
You're the one who entered
this house illegally.

746
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:05,803
You broke the law.

747
00:53:05,836 --> 00:53:07,004
No.

748
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:10,007
You know people can get shot
for breaking and entering.

749
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,508
But I didn't break...

750
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,677
You have an
opportunity to here,

751
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,846
right here, right
now to fix this.

752
00:53:16,646 --> 00:53:19,917
I don't know where my
brother is and I don't know

753
00:53:19,951 --> 00:53:20,952
where my son is.

754
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:23,988
I need your help.

755
00:53:28,692 --> 00:53:29,961
Look, it seems to me

756
00:53:29,994 --> 00:53:33,030
you're running out of options.

757
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:35,498
Where is the campsite?

758
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:45,876
Okay, well, we'll find
it in the morning.

759
00:53:50,547 --> 00:53:55,485
But you better hope that when
we do find my son, he's okay.

760
00:53:56,586 --> 00:53:59,023
Or you will have
no options left.

761
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:00,958
Got it?

762
00:54:10,935 --> 00:54:11,869
They're down by the river.

763
00:54:11,902 --> 00:54:13,737
Go see if you can find him.

764
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:15,705
What are you gonna
do about the father?

765
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:17,908
How the hell do I know?

766
00:54:19,143 --> 00:54:21,846
We're getting in
deeper and deeper here.

767
00:54:21,879 --> 00:54:23,948
Maybe we find Andrew
and we disappear...

768
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:25,749
No, no.

769
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:27,051
I'm not running anymore.

770
00:54:28,786 --> 00:54:30,755
What do you want
me to do then?

771
00:54:30,788 --> 00:54:32,757
Those people trespassed.

772
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,059
Those people have
disrupted our lives.

773
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:38,661
Are you willing to
let them separate us?

774
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:41,766
Why don't you let her go?

775
00:54:43,968 --> 00:54:46,536
I don't need you
to be weak right now.

776
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:48,738
Just go find him.

We have to hide.

00:55:08,893 --> 00:55:09,760
Listen to me.

00:55:11,028 --> 00:55:12,063
I just wanna go home.

784
00:55:12,096 --> 00:55:13,798
Stay quiet.

785
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:17,034
If you don't and he finds
you, he'll poison you

786
00:55:17,068 --> 00:55:18,635
and lock you away forever.

787
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:20,971

worried about you.

We're not angry with you.

789
00:55:26,077 --> 00:55:27,644
Please.

staying right here.

doing too good.

Andrew, come on out.

Let's not play any games here.

Come on out.

He should have been back by now.

explain myself to you.

Please just let me go.

I'll leave and never come back.

You'll never see me again.

00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:53,958
I swear, I won't tell
anyone I was here.

816
00:57:53,991 --> 00:57:56,093
You'll run and tell
everyone about this place

817
00:57:56,126 --> 00:57:58,128
and they will take
him away from me.

818
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:00,931
They won't understand.

819
00:58:02,933 --> 00:58:03,834
I understand.

Oh, you don't.

It's not true.

How do I know you
didn't kill him?

much time left.

Why did you say that?

I didn't think
he was breathing.

He's outside on the ground.

yelling is in your head.

[door closes]

927
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:11,588
We have to be quiet.

928
01:11:11,621 --> 01:11:13,090
She doesn't like a lot of noise.

929
01:11:31,641 --> 01:11:34,544
Your mother, she's
up those stairs.

930
01:11:38,382 --> 01:11:40,550
I'm not going up
there by myself.

931
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:54,098
Mom?

Where is she?

937
01:12:26,797 --> 01:12:28,899
I think she is down there.

938
01:12:28,933 --> 01:12:31,668
If you think I'm gonna go
down there, you're crazy.

939
01:12:33,703 --> 01:12:34,872
I can't help you anymore.

I know you are here.

943
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:57,027
They told me you were gone.

944
01:12:57,061 --> 01:12:58,796
But you are here.

945
01:12:58,829 --> 01:13:00,030

Help me please.

952
01:13:22,286 --> 01:13:23,154
Don't be afraid.

953
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:25,655
She's my friend.

954
01:13:26,924 --> 01:13:28,691
She's gonna help you get out.

955
01:13:31,829 --> 01:13:33,264

Don't be afraid.

960
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:47,144
I'm going to go
look for my mom.

961
01:13:48,745 --> 01:13:50,281

If you hurt my
daughter, I swear to God

Emily, it's me

974
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:50,740
What did they do to you?

975
01:14:54,011 --> 01:14:55,813
Let me get you out.

976
01:14:57,381 --> 01:14:58,748
You're safe now

Andrew

978
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,389
Who are you talking to?

979
01:15:05,422 --> 01:15:07,925

We can't leave her

999

You don't understand
your mother is up there

1000
01:16:11,355 --> 01:16:12,323
waiting for us, this
is our only chance.

1001
01:16:12,356 --> 01:16:13,624
If you want Natalie to live,

1002
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:15,225
you have to come with us now,

1003
01:16:15,259 --> 01:16:16,427
- We can't leave her.

Go up the stairs and
hide by the campsite.

1005
01:16:18,128 --> 01:16:19,330
Go, go, go

1006

Say goodbye to your mother.

1014
01:16:55,432 --> 01:17:00,404
What makes you think you family
is more important than mine.

1015
01:17:05,976 --> 01:17:07,010
Get off me.

Hellen, what do you
do when you see a bear?

1018
01:17:17,488 --> 01:17:18,922
You play dead.

1019

Mom, mom

1020
01:17:33,404 --> 01:17:34,271
No.

1021
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:39,543
They would put
you in a hospital.

1022
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:41,011
I can't let that happen.

1023
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:49,119
I had no choice, you know that.

1024
01:17:57,227 --> 01:17:59,396
We'll bury them
next to each other.

1025
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:01,098
That'd be the right thing to do.

1026
01:18:15,145 --> 01:18:16,313
Please let me keep her

1027
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:24,354

get us out of here.

Sweetie, I'm so
sorry this happened.

1034
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:11,568
It is okay, go.
