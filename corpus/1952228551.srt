Recording:
You're all that's left of us.

3
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,879
Good luck.
God bless.

4
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,510
And Godspeed.

Bower.

Bower.

Lieutenant Payton!

(gasping)

33
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,965
- Who are you?
- I'm Bower.

34
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,443
Corporal Bower, sir.

35
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,038
Bower?
Bower?

36
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,572
You're waking
from extended hypersleep.

37
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,415
- Bower?
- This is disorientation.

38
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,512
Could you get that
fucking light out of my eyes?

39
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,852
Sorry, sir.

40
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,317
(groans)
Where are we?

41
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,351
Aboard the Elysium.

42
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,365
The Elysium?

43
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,300
Where are we?

44
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,599
I don't know.

45
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,970
Where's the rest of the crew?

46
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,267
Is it our shift?

47
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,074
- Our rotation?
- I believe so.

48
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,240
Aren't they supposed
to be here to wake us up?

49
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,113
I don't know.

50
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,685
Hit the lights, will you?

51
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,086
There's a problem
with the power, sir.

52
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,097
(groaning)

53
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,723
Who woke you up?

54
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,064
It had to have been
the flight computer.

55
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,695
There's no one here
except us.

56
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,228
It's cold.

57
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,299
I've been awake for over an hour
and I still can't remember anything.

58
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,913
The last time I crawled out
of a hyperbunk

59
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,610
it took me quite a while
to get it all back.

60
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,118
What was your...

61
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,087
what was your last flight, sir?

62
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,089
I don't know.

63
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,091
Sir, do you even know
where we're going?

64
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,992
I remember the training,

65
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,361
but not the destination,
the mission.

66
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,593
I figured you'd tell me.

67
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,124
Payton:
If this really is our ship,

68
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,262
then this room should
be locked into position

69
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,398
and behind that door
should be the bridge.

70
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,602
Jesus.

71
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,702
Somebody was trying to get out.

72
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,951
- Lieutenant.
- (blows)

73
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,421
None of the activators are working.

74
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,753
Yeah, it figures.

75
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,319
Without unified threading
we can't connect.

76
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,124
Hold on here.

77
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,562
We can at least
get this station to work.

78
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,600
(humming)

79
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,340
(laughs)

80
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,843
I didn't even think of that.

81
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,141
(chuckles)

82
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,613
All right. Jesus.

83
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,678
Lieutenant Payton on the com.
Anybody copy?

84
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,989
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team...

85
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,823
Shit.

86
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,889
- 5.
- How do you know that?

87
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,365
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

88
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,637
Anybody copy?

89
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,611
Anyone respond.

90
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,147
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

91
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,275
Anybody awake up there?

92
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,911
Team 4 is supposed
to be here for flight rotation.

93
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,648
Where could they be?

94
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,188
Maybe they couldn't get to us.

95
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,563
Where did he go?

96
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,831
(rumbling)

97
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,036
Power systems must be free floating
between uncoupled circuits,

98
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,739
or something the override grid
won't even lock in.

99
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,269
What do you think?

100
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,542
(rumbling stops)

101
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,050
(clanking)

102
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,746
Somebody's up there.

103
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,086
Uh, it's ventilation.

104
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,616
The system keeps rebooting
after each surge.

105
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,958
That could be anything.

106
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,931
Listen, I think we should
get out of here.

107
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,129
I'd rather be up and out
than stuck in the trunk, wouldn't you?

108
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,431
Test test.

109
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,872
Payton: Copy.

110
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,605
Lift me up.

111
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,483
Our 2nd lieutenant must
have come through here.

112
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,716
It's the only way.

113
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,459
It's fucking dark in here.

114
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,463
Payton: Don't worry.
Just take the first way out.

115
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,694
I'll guide you back here to open
the doors from the outside.

116
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,636
How are we doing?

117
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,469
See anything?

118
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,135
Nothing yet.

119
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,111
Not a single vent opening
or anything.

120
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,876
What about on your end?

121
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,348
(rumbling)

122
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,750
Power surges keep happening
in longer increments just like you said.

123
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,187
Reactor timing is offset in the core.

124
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:14,056
It's trying to reconnect.

125
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,993
But it won't until it's reset.

126
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,121
Payton:
How do you know that?

127
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,126
I don't know.
I can't even remember my... Jesus Christ!

128
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,370
But I know everything there is
to know about that damn reactor.

129
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,206
Payton:
That's the training talking.

130
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,836
You must be our technical engineer.

131
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,507
(rumbling)

132
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,146
Found an intersection.

133
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,623
Copy that.
Anything look promising?

134
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,354
A whole lot of the same...
nothing.

135
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,232
- Taking a left. Make a note.
- Payton: Left it is.

136
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,384
(clanging)

137
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,992
Payton.

138
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,568
Payton!
Payton, do you copy?

139
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,334
I don't know if I'm going in circles.

140
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,840
And, um, I can't breathe.

141
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,109
Payton, do you copy?

142
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,047
Payton:
I'm here. I'm here.

143
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,610
Easy now, easy. Breathe.
Just listen to me.

144
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,179
- I just want to stand up.
- Calm down.

145
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,919
- I can't breathe.
- Stop it and listen to me.

146
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,086
- Now let's just get you back here.
- Back?

147
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,564
Are you fucking kidding me?
I can't even turn around.

148
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,089
Do you know
how far I've gone, Payton?

149
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,898
- Listen to me.
- I just want out of this fucking thing!

150
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,134
Payton:
Put your mind somewhere else.

151
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,869
Like where?

152
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,003
This may not be
the best time to tell you,

153
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,706
but I got the door open.

154
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,348
You fucking kidding me?

155
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,320
Yeah, I'm kidding you.

156
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,653
(laughs)

157
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,285
You see?
Now that's not so bad.

158
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,319
We're gonna get you through this.
We're gonna figure this out together.

159
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,388
- You hear me?
- Uh-huh.

160
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,195
You spent eight years
in the hyperbunk.

161
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,498
A couple of more minutes
in a shaft won't kill you.

162
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,730
Eight years?

163
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,899
I do remember two years
being our duty rotation.

164
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,536
If we're team 5, that means
we've been out for eight years.

165
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,102
I don't think
you're here by default.

166
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,173
You were a select pick.
We all were.

167
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,684
This was something special.

168
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,951
Someone's been through here.

169
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,355
- Wait a second.
- What's wrong?

170
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,297
I'm at an angle.
Oh shit, I'm at an angle.

171
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,629
I'm at an angle!

172
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,163
(groans)

173
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,172
Bower, what happened?

174
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,006
What is it?

175
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,981
Bower, are you hurt?

176
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,541
(groaning)

177
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,551
Bower, what happened?

178
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,122
I can hear you breathing.
Are you all right?

179
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,216
(groaning)

180
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,757
- Can you hear me?
- (breathing heavily)

181
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,007
(groans)

182
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,603
Bower, are you all right?

183
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,977
I've... I've found Cooper.

184
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,985
He's dead.
I'm in a boot locker.

185
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,384
(rumbling)

186
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,821
(groans)

187
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,086
Bower?

188
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,120
You all right?

189
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,097
Make that an overhead compartment.

190
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,661
Payton, I got out.

191
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:59,235
- (static)
- Payton?

192
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,212
Bower, do you hear me?

193
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,181
Do you read?

194
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,116
(creaking)

195
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,090
(panting)

196
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,420
Payton, are you there?

197
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,762
Payton, can you hear me?

198
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,345
Payton, do you copy?

199
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,447
(lights crackling)

200
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,823
Payton?

201
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,294
Corporal, can you hear me?

202
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,564
Corporal, can you hear me?

203
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,459
(clanging)

204
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,222
(grunting)

205
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,020
Hey.

206
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,583
Hey, I need to talk to you!

207
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,721
Wait! Stop!

208
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,230
Don't run again, okay?

209
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,264
I don't care if you were
stealing or anything.

210
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,209
I just want to ask you
a couple questions.

211
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,481
How are you awake?

212
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,347
Hello?

213
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,852
Hello!

214
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,455
What, are you fucking deaf?

215
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,997
Hello?

216
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,406
Jesus!

217
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,366
- (speaking German)
- What?

218
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,869
Don't move.

219
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,914
Wait. Wait a second.
I'm with the flight crew.

220
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,180
Don't you move.

221
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,519
Really, I'm part of the flight crew.

222
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,184
- Take them off.
- What?

223
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,492
Shoes.

224
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,930
I'll gut your ass.

225
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,735
- (gasps)
- (roaring)

226
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,321
(growling)

227
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,294
(roaring)

228
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,437
(crunching)

229
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,310
(roaring)

230
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,887
(panting)

231
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,551
What the?

232
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,113
(growling)

233
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,289
(roaring)

234
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,436
(roaring)

235
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,347
(sniffing)

236
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,416
(growls)

237
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,260
Payton:
Bower, do you read?

238
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,087
- (roaring)
- (gasps)

239
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,364
God damn it, answer me.

240
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,801
(growling)

241
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,711
Payton:
Bower, do you hear me?

242
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,110
Do you read?

243
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,212
(Bower whispering)
You are not hearing me.

244
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,315
There's no procedure for this.
They can't write a book for this.

245
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,826
After what I just saw, procedure
just went out the fucking window.

246
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,829
Payton:
Listen, I need you to calm down.

247
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,423
You're all we've got out there
if we're gonna figure this out.

248
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,696
Let's get back to these...
these other guys.

249
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,965
Guys?
Those weren't guys.

250
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,472
They were hunting.

251
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,874
They... they took Cooper's body.

252
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,640
Just like a fucking pack of...

253
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,910
They didn't seem human.

254
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,409
We have to try
and contact the bridge.

255
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,912
You're assuming that there
is someone on the bridge.

256
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,256
There has to be.

257
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,885
We can't be alone in this.

258
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,987
Well, alone or not,

259
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,521
we can't assume help will be coming.

260
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,160
Out here there is no rescue
and there is no turning around.

261
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,402
I don't think this thing
was even built to return.

262
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,875
What are you talking about?

263
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,879
I'm saying that this
is no ordinary transport.

264
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,313
We're not out on the belt
collecting data.

265
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,943
We're not hauling cargo.

266
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,045
We are the cargo.

267
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,717
60,000 people
on a single launch trajectory.

268
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,193
Tanis.

269
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,856
Man on TV:
25 billion people watched in awe.

270
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,765
These breathtaking images
of Tanis arrived

271
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,530
from the Popolous probe and were
broadcast yesterday.

272
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,970
These were taken as the probe
was entering the orbit

273
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,634
of the only Earth like planet
known to exist.

274
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:47,167
People of the whole world are watching
as the probe sent into space

275
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:51,740
is transferring data exceeding
even the most optimistic expectations.

276
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,217
We knew to expect water on Tanis.

277
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,516
We knew to expect
reasonable temperatures.

278
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,284
But the questioned remained...

279
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,986
will this planet meet the extremely
complex and unlikely combination

280
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,394
of parameters to support life
as we know it?

281
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,194
The probe has touched down
on the planet six days ago.

282
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,292
It's sending off its first transmission

283
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,304
that is expected
to arrive any second now.

284
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,397
(man speaking over radio)

285
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,346
Ladies and gentlemen,

286
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,843
this is an unprecedented
moment for all mankind.

287
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,357
Are we seeing this?

288
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,586
First detection as we had hoped.

289
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,857
This needs to be verified,
but it appears

290
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,660
some form of plant life is present.

291
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,362
My God, life on Tanis.
There is life detection.

292
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,495
We have habitat detection.

293
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,598
Verified, this is a monumental
day for all of us.

294
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,735
Only a matter of time before
we send people out there.

295
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,938
Processing and population.

296
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,777
We're a settlers vessel.

297
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,908
Elysium was a one-way ticket.

298
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,853
How could I have...

299
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,286
left her?

300
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,788
How could I have done that?

301
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,119
I loved her.

302
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,935
Payton:
We've got to get to the bridge.

303
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,564
We've got to get control of the ship
before these guys rip it apart.

304
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,130
This is too fucking important.

305
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,870
- Payton, where is your wife?
- What?

306
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,435
Do you remember the recruitment?
The breeding tests,

307
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,141
the husbands, the wives?

308
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,947
We didn't leave them behind.
They're here somewhere onboard.

309
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,942
I've got to find her before
these fucking animals do.

310
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,208
Try to think.
Where would they be?

311
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,374
A sleeping compartment
for non-service personnel?

312
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,213
Wait, hold on.
Think for a second.

313
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,219
I remember there were thousands
of passengers that weren't part

314
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,778
- of the development team. Families.
- You listen to me.

315
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:14,189
You know how big this ship is?
And you have no idea where your wife...

316
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,251
where our wives might be.

317
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,786
If you go off on some
wild goose chase

318
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:23,927
we're gonna be no closer to getting
ourselves out of this situation

319
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,903
and with even less time
to regain control of the ship.

320
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:31,102
Once we've taken control of the systems,
finding them will be easy.

321
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,042
Are you hearing me?

322
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,406
We save the ship,
we save them.

323
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,153
- Security locker.
- What?

324
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,998
Non-lethal antiriot guns.

325
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,695
Payton:
Close up they'll do some damage.

326
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,487
(humming)

327
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,729
All right, I'm gonna lay out
a path for you

328
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,498
and try to bypass
the main security grids.

329
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,064
Without main power
we'll never get these doors open.

330
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,133
Listen, if you can get me
to the reactor bay

331
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,771
I can reset the cycle manually.

332
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,804
Payton:
You know how to do that?

333
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,681
- Yeah.
- It's a long way.

334
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,619
Gonna have to get you past
a few security bulkheads.

335
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,986
With a little sidestepping,
we're gonna get you there.

336
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,521
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Delta 81643 Lima.

337
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,997
Okay okay, hold on.

338
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,227
I don't want you going too far.
Just catch your breath.

339
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,236
I don't need a rest.
Just tell me which way.

340
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,465
I don't know yet.
Hold on.

341
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,746
Payton.

342
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:27,123
Pandorum, you ever
felt the symptoms?

343
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,926
Of all the things to remember,
why would you pick that?

344
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,593
Were you thinking
of the Eden mission?

345
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,568
What about the Eden?

346
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,771
You just had to remind me of the biggest
fucking catastrophe in space travel.

347
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,702
The flight cautionary tale from hell.

348
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,214
I remember.
Didn't they have some kind of

349
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,685
hypersleep malfunction?

350
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,779
Payton: Two years into their shift
one of their officers

351
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,188
had a psychological breakdown.

352
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,524
The doctors refer
to it as ODS syndrome.

353
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:07,429
But the pilots,
we call it pandorum.

354
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:12,330
It drove him insane. He became
convinced the flight was cursed.

355
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,764
- Evil.
- Bower: What did he do?

356
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,434
(alarm blaring)

357
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,636
Payton:
He evacuated the ship.

358
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:26,048
He launched them all
into oblivion.

359
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,212
5,000 people sent to their death

360
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,119
with one push of a button.

361
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,123
Bower: At least we didn't wake up
floating away in a coffin.

362
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,725
Payton:
Who says we didn't?

363
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,344
- Which way?
- Left at the third marker.

364
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,371
Just two more levels up
and we're on the main walkway.

365
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,882
Should be easy from there.

366
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,087
This can't be right.

367
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,393
What's not right?

368
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,491
I don't know if I'm hallucinating.

369
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,229
What?
What's going on?

370
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,035
I've seen this before.
This is a...

371
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,344
this...

372
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,874
this is a different one.

373
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,724
It's booby-trapped.

374
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,854
Rigged the ceiling.

375
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,330
Payton: Be careful.

376
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,767
No! No!

377
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,829
No!

378
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,237
Quiet!

379
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,137
- Quiet! Shh.
- (panting)

380
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,511
We have to shut the hell up.
Do you understand?

381
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,039
I'm gonna get you out of this,
but you have to be quiet.

382
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,143
You understand?

383
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,149
Payton:
Bower, you sure this is a good idea?

384
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,862
Watch yourself.

385
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,726
He's team 6.

386
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,398
That's the shift unit
that's supposed to follow us.

387
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,703
Payton: He could be...

388
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,369
Quiet. Quiet!

389
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,538
Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you
but you have to be quiet.

390
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,980
Do you hear me?

391
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,812
Shepard, team 6, sir.

392
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,387
I believe I'm the only one.

393
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,087
I knew it.
I knew you'd come back.

394
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,323
- What?
- Where's your squad?

395
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,127
Squad?
This is my lieutenant.

396
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,760
- Where's your shuttle?
- Shuttle? What are you talking about?

397
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,599
You're the retraction crew, right?

398
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,765
No. No.
I'm team 5.

399
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,833
- You just woke up?
- Six or eight hours ago.

400
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,139
So you don't know
what the fuck is going on?

401
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,577
That's what I'm saying.

402
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,582
- You know as much as me, man.
- I don't know anything.

403
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,676
You, you're gonna fit right in.

404
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,520
What are you doing?

405
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,887
- Get the scent off.
- Scent?

406
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,824
They're fast and they're fucking
stronger than you know.

407
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,124
They come after you, you run.
You run and you don't fucking look back.

408
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,790
I can't wait for you.

409
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,857
Who... who are they?

410
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,528
- I can't help you.
- Help me.

411
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,538
Payton: Bower, you tell that asshole
the chain of command

412
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,972
- and a direct order is being made.
- You're still an officer on this ship,

413
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,169
and at the current time
your CO is ordering you...

414
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,371
- Ordering me? That's funny.
...now is ordering you...

415
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,312
You're late.
There's no fucking CO on this ship.

416
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,644
Fuck you.

417
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,946
(roaring)

418
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,350
(whimpering)

419
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,490
That's not gonna save you.

420
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,061
(snarling, growling)

421
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,698
Payton:
Get the hell out of there.

422
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,307
Get out of there!

423
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,724
Ah!

424
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,461
(roaring)

425
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,671
(whispering)
Go.

426
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,210
(screaming)

427
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,722
(thuds)

428
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,567
(groans)

429
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,936
(roars)

430
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,941
Just run.
Go!

431
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,355
(screaming)

432
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,548
(winces)

433
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,379
- (roaring)
- (screams)

434
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,933
(speaking Vietnamese)

435
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,830
(speaking Vietnamese)

436
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,919
I don't understand.

437
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,065
Thanks.

438
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,551
I... I don't understand.

439
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,758
I don't know what you're saying.

440
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,319
I... I don't understand.

441
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,698
Agriculture.

442
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,328
You're with agriculture.

443
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,973
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm with the flight crew.

444
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,376
But I don't know...
I don't know what happened.

445
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,850
Yeah, I know that,
but I'm not in charge here.

446
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,375
I'm trying to find out
what happened to the ship.

447
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,718
S-ship.

448
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,518
Ship.

449
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,151
I'm on my way to the reactor.

450
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,888
Reactor.

451
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,953
Reactor, that's right.
Exactly right.

452
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,795
But that doesn't concern you.
You stay here.

453
00:38:55,833 --> 00:39:00,270
You stay put and wait for the...

454
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,908
security to reengage.

455
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,708
And I'm gonna handle this problem.

456
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,270
Okay?

457
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,045
(electricity crackling)

458
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,788
(grunting)

459
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,166
(groans)

460
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,072
(panting)
God damn it.

461
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,039
(clanking)

462
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,885
Who's there?

463
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,149
(roars)

464
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,592
(clanking)

465
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,495
Identify yourself.

466
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,658
Bower?

467
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,294
Is that you, Bower?

468
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,796
That can't be you.

469
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,967
- (shouts)
- (grunts)

470
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,615
(groans)

471
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,952
You again.

472
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,171
(pulsates)

473
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,987
I understand that it's felt

474
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,424
like every man for himself.

475
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,328
If we're going to get out of this...

476
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,528
a little fucking solidarity

477
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,036
goes a long way.

478
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,976
We all want to survive,

479
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,376
right?

480
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,846
I lost contact with my CO.

481
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,714
So I need someone to tell me
how to get to the reactor.

482
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,487
You know?
That's great.

483
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,390
All right, we can work together

484
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,690
as a team.

485
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,993
(roaring)

486
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,966
(speaking Vietnamese)

487
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,901
Go.

488
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,279
(speaking Vietnamese)

489
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,415
Yeah.

490
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,718
Yeah well, no sympathy here, pal.

491
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,989
She left me with
a few sore spots too.

492
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,356
Why the hell should I trust you?

493
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:26,165
- Listen, lady, we don't want any...
- Are you really part of the flight crew?

494
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,967
Corporal Bower,
ship's mechanical engineer.

495
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,476
I didn't think
there was any flight crew left.

496
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,908
What's happened to us?

497
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,284
A malfunction of some sort.

498
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,722
You think?
What's your plan?

499
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,318
Fire up the reactor.
Go from there.

500
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,488
- You just wake up?
- Yeah.

501
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,362
- Just joined the party.
- You'll never make it.

502
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,993
- Why is that?
- You're going the wrong direction.

503
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,634
- Wait a second.
- Keep it down.

504
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,606
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

505
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,109
- I need you to show me the way.
- To the reactor?

506
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,304
I don't like going that far down.

507
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,809
No one ever comes back.

508
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,081
We don't have much time.

509
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,953
We could lose everything onboard.
Do you know what I'm saying to you?

510
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,116
Can you fly it?

511
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,025
Can you fly the ship?

512
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,551
Land it if you have to?

513
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,895
Yeah.

514
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,536
How long have you been awake?

515
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,599
Don't know.
There's no way to tell time in here.

516
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,611
- Five, maybe six months.
- Months?

517
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,273
Quiet.
You want to get us killed?

518
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,077
(roaring in distance)

519
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,150
What are we doing?

520
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,247
- We are waiting.
- Waiting for what?

521
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:59,395
You want to get to the reactor?
Then trust me.

522
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,762
(speaking Vietnamese)

523
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,368
(roaring in distance)

524
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,031
Oh shit.
Hey, we have to go.

525
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,631
Trust me.

526
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,801
We've got to go now.

527
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,676
- We've got to go now.
- Wait.

528
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,510
- (roaring louder)
- We've got to go now.

529
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,151
(rumbling)

530
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,538
What the hell are they?

531
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,975
Never quite felt like sticking
around to find out.

532
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,604
Running is always the best option.

533
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,546
They can't be from this ship.

534
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,781
What is all this?

535
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,883
Ecological development.

536
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,293
Embryonic charter, livestock
and wildlife repopulation.

537
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,766
You live here?
You protect all this?

538
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,333
To us it seemed worth protecting.

539
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,031
Us?

540
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,839
When I woke up,
there were five if us.

541
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,170
I was part of the Brandenburg Institute's
genetic sampling team.

542
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,376
Seven years collecting
and readying earth's biosphere...

543
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,442
just didn't feel right handing it off.

544
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,518
I volunteered to go along with it.

545
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,427
This...

546
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,626
truly is Noah's Ark.

547
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:47,865
This archive holds the world
we are going to live in.

548
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:51,671
We've already lost about
30% of the specimens.

549
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:56,075
The lab has its own generator,
but without the reactor working,

550
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,775
I don't know if they
will ever make it to Tanis.

551
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,716
Tanis.

552
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,242
You couldn't remember?

553
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,346
I couldn't remember how...

554
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,823
how far away it was.

555
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,588
This was a 123-year flight.

556
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,754
Consider yourself lucky.

557
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:15,390
It took me months to recall.

558
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,026
It took even longer to get
that goddamn door open.

559
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,969
It comes on in pieces.

560
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:25,073
I know everything about this vault
and its systems.

561
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,810
But I still can't remember
where I grew up...

562
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,774
or my brother's name.

563
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,910
Are you hungry?

564
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,944
Yeah, I'm starving.

565
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,050
Here.

566
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,494
Good for protein.

567
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,004
How could we become like this
in only eight years?

568
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,709
This ship was built to outlast
our children's children.

569
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:11,685
I think we've been asleep
longer than you think.

570
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,658
(clanging)

571
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,041
You want in?

572
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,382
Come and get it, you fuck!

573
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,759
Help!
Help me!

574
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,532
Help!

575
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,144
Who the hell are you?

576
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,155
I'm part of the flight crew.

577
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,555
Please help me.

578
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,525
You're all right.
You're all right. Easy.

579
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,495
- (whimpering)
- Hey, hang on.

580
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,555
Hang on.
Who are you?

581
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:32,090
What's your name?
Can you hear me?

582
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,334
Gallo.

583
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:39,501
Gallo? Is that it?

584
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,512
Corporal Gallo?

585
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:45,777
Yes.

586
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,443
Where'd you come from, Gallo?

587
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,384
From the...

588
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,444
from the bridge.

589
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,855
Bridge?
What happened?

590
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,519
Where are we?
Can you tell me?

591
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,462
- (whimpering)
- Corporal.

592
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:05,025
Tell me.
What happened?

593
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,707
Bowen:
Where are we?

594
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,378
Hypersleep chamber,
personnel.

595
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,917
Careful.

596
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,253
And don't slow me down.

597
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,940
Bower:
Most of these are empty.

598
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,465
Where the hell is everyone?

599
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,478
This is their main
hunting ground.

600
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,341
Keep moving.

601
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:01,683
Hey, my wife could be in here.

602
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,853
She's a development settler?
Engineer?

603
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:09,764
No, she's not part of the crew.
But spouses were brought with.

604
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,199
She's not here then.

605
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,759
Do you know where
the family members are?

606
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,499
Quiet.

607
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,381
We have to keep moving.

608
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,649
We don't want to stay
in the open for too long.

609
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,156
Especially in here.

610
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,989
We have to get going.

611
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,571
We can't just leave him.

612
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,665
Fuck that.
He's hunting.

613
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,972
You wait for him?
Good luck.

614
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,376
Wait.

615
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,248
(metal creaking)

616
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,774
(gasps)

617
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,224
(metal creaks)

618
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,433
(sputtering)

619
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,700
You all right?

620
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,398
I'm all right.

621
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,072
(gagging)
Oh God.

622
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,980
There must be hundreds
of them in here.

623
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,091
(roaring)

624
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,596
(rumbling)

625
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,022
Where did they go?

626
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,322
We have to get out of here.

627
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,039
- (roaring)
- (gasps)

628
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,118
(roaring)

629
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,353
- (roaring)
- (groans)

630
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,980
(shouting)

631
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,550
(shouts)

632
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,825
(groans)

633
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,005
- (shouts)
- (roars)

634
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,584
(roaring)

635
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,583
(growling)

636
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,525
(bangs)

637
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,557
We should run.

638
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,170
- (roars)
- Go!

639
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,221
- What are you doing?
- We can't leave him.

640
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,683
(screaming)

641
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,892
(roars)

642
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,037
Bower, do you copy?

643
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,311
You out there?

644
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,941
Flight team 4.

645
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,813
What are you doing?

646
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,318
Just checking you.

647
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,081
For what?

648
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,680
Make sure you're okay.
You passed out.

649
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,554
You were hysterical.

650
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:18,891
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Payton.

651
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:21,988
- Lieutenant Payton.
- You're a lieutenant?

652
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,192
You're team 4.

653
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,065
You're supposed
to be my predecessor.

654
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,601
You said you came from the bridge.

655
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,041
- Yeah, so?
- So where the hell are we?

656
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,739
- I can't get any navigation in here.
- I don't know.

657
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,373
Well, what did you see?
How did this whole thing get screwed up?

658
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:42,942
Listen, I am not a navigator.

659
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,784
- The stars all look alike.
- Take it easy, all right?

660
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,552
Just want to make sure you're okay.

661
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,957
- I'm fine.
- Is that your blood, Corporal?

662
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:57,191
Some of it is, sir.

663
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,963
Who else's blood is it?

664
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,233
There was something
wrong with them.

665
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,866
Something wrong with who?

666
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,433
Your crew?

667
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,071
It was pandorum.

668
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,946
I had to defend myself.

669
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,950
I did.

670
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,249
Pandorum?
Both of 'em?

671
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,984
You don't believe me, do you?

672
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,019
If you would have seen them...

673
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:32,001
you would have done
the same thing, sir.

674
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:36,236
(water splashing)

675
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:43,544
I thought you knew
where we were going.

676
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,572
I was trying to save our asses.

677
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,447
(speaking Vietnamese)

678
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,700
(roaring in distance)

679
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:30,651
(speaks Vietnamese)

680
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,287
Whoa whoa, easy, okay?

681
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,297
No weapons.
No weapons.

682
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,567
Excuse me.
Just please, come.

683
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:43,470
Come in.
Okay.

684
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:47,033
Please, make yourselves at home.

685
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,241
You live here?

686
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,577
- Who said that? What?
- You live here?

687
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,982
I know it's not much to look at.

688
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,453
But...

689
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,319
they can't get in here

690
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,017
unless I want them to.

691
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,423
Why would you want them to?

692
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,859
I had no idea
there was any crew left.

693
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,921
Have you met any other flyers?

694
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,694
No.

695
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:15,500
Not in a long long time.

696
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:18,939
Why don't you come on
down so we can meet properly?

697
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,944
You think I survived this long
trusting strangers?

698
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,411
Wait.

699
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:28,109
I have a question for you.
Where you got to be?

700
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:31,382
Reactor bay.
Know how to get there?

701
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,480
Yeah, I do.

702
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,824
Why would you want
to go to the reactor?

703
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,658
Oh, I get it.
I get it.

704
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,155
You just woke up, huh?
You hungry?

705
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,498
'Cause I can cook.

706
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,300
I really got a treat for you guys.

707
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,671
but I must admit it's really
difficult to season

708
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,700
when you're only using
a motor oil base.

709
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,804
But if we use our imagination,

710
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,247
we got something here.

711
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,251
It kinda tastes like...

712
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:04,185
(sniffs)

713
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,279
herb and butter dogshit.

714
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,517
How long have you been awake?

715
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,856
Let me see... what's today?

716
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,123
Tuesday, so I have no idea.

717
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,327
Ah, well, let's eat, shall we?

718
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,032
(speaks Vietnamese)
It's kosher.

719
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:27,304
I'm a cook, you know.
Says so right here on my tattoo.

720
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,173
Is that safe?

721
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:33,182
Compared to what?

722
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,582
Those things out there,

723
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,246
could it have been something

724
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:41,848
that crawled out of your tank or lab
or something?

725
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,882
No, that's not possible.

726
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,519
Then it's some kind of life form
that got onboard.

727
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,225
Or something.

728
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,325
Or something
that was already onboard

729
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:54,563
with us in the hyperbunks.

730
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,504
What do you mean?

731
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,531
I believe it's the accelerator.

732
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:02,635
The synthetic enzyme
in our feeding tubes

733
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,771
that would help our bodies
adjust and adapt

734
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,714
to the environmental
conditions on Tanis.

735
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,547
From what I've seen,

736
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:13,021
these things have adapted
to the ship instead.

737
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,182
So you're saying that they're passengers
who have mutated?

738
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:21,025
That stuff in our blood is supposed
to jump-start evolution.

739
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:24,191
Well, why would they
be affected and we're not?

740
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:27,259
Maybe they've been awake
much longer than we think.

741
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,272
- Longer than him.
- Huh.

742
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,274
- You don't know what happened to us?
- You do?

743
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,766
Oh, I've been around
for a while.

744
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,915
I know what I've seen.

745
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,548
What do you think you're doing?

746
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,253
What is that?

747
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,058
It's just a sedative
to help you relax.

748
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,724
Then you take it
and relax.

749
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:00,429
Take it down a notch.
We're on the same team here.

750
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,132
Do you know
the symptoms of pandorum?

751
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,368
- What?
- Orbital dysfunctional syndrome.

752
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,104
- Pandorum.
- I've seen it before.

753
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,738
Ever witness
the symptoms firsthand?

754
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,839
It's not something
you can easily detect.

755
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:15,350
It starts with a shiver, an itch,

756
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,215
a slow boil...

757
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:20,313
the biological side effects
of flying deep space

758
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,914
feeding into paranoia.

759
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,483
And the paranoid
brain feeding the side effects.

760
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,189
A downward spiral.
A descent into madness.

761
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,563
There is no shutting off the heat
no matter what you do.

762
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,194
It'll boil over.

763
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,363
You don't believe me.

764
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,770
I didn't say that.

765
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,537
How could they both have had it?
The odds are insurmountable.

766
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,441
I wasn't about
to question your actions.

767
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,946
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

768
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,211
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

769
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,083
- It has an emotional trigger effect.
- That's what they say.

770
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,850
How do you think you would react
if you knew the truth?

771
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:00,286
The truth about what?

772
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:03,196
Leland: Boom.
Oh, how the whole world cheered

773
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,258
to the thunder of earth's
mightiest creation...

774
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,860
Elysium.

775
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,168
One small spark

776
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,107
to ignite the heavens
for the heroes

777
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,406
to venture farther and farther

778
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,140
than any of mankind's machines.

779
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,149
And we slept.
We slept a slumber so deep

780
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,946
that no one had dared before

781
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:26,921
as three little Indians
were left to mind the store.

782
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,480
Gallo:
We were only into our second term.

783
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:29,752
All flight systems nominal.

784
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:32,522
I picked up symptoms
with my CO and 2nd lieutenant.

785
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:36,395
Mild symptoms. Nothing I thought
would become a problem.

786
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,799
- Until we got the transmission.
- What transmission?

787
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:42,326
Leland:
Mother Earth's final call.

788
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:46,535
All God's creation ending
with mere words of encouragement.

789
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:49,942
(garbled talking)

790
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,475
What does it say?

791
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,824
You're all that's left of us.

792
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:16,226
Good luck.
God bless.

793
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,866
And Godspeed.

794
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,274
Earth...

795
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,874
is gone?

796
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,042
Poof.
Wiped away.

797
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,951
We ran a full sweep of the grid
and they were gone.

798
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,785
One day there,
the next nothing.

799
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,984
In one day?

800
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,653
It had to be nuclear
or an asteroid.

801
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,184
Does it matter?

802
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,663
My fellow crew members
didn't take the news too well.

803
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,724
I wanted to wake the primary crew,

804
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:48,293
but my 2nd lieutenant
was already over the edge.

805
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,738
Leland: Three little Indians
with the burden to bear.

806
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:54,140
No more law.
Nothing left to care.

807
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,771
Just three little souls whose
destiny had become undone

808
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:01,840
because there was
chop chop chop chop...

809
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,215
then there was only one.

810
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,779
One little Indian left.

811
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,757
They were my commanding officers,

812
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,090
men who had guided me
through FT.

813
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:15,256
But it wasn't them anymore.
They were gone.

814
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:18,164
- I had no choice!
- Corporal Gallo!

815
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,931
Leland: One little Indian left,
alone with all his doom.

816
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,769
He refuses to go to bed,
so what does he do?

817
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:28,743
He decides to stay up
and play in his room.

818
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:31,372
What nasty little games
he would play

819
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:33,348
with his slumbering prey.

820
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,748
He was slayer, he was master.

821
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,652
He was both God and the devil.

822
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,622
See, that's what some would say.
He would grow to manhood,

823
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,682
- a self-proclaimed king.
- (coughing)

824
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:47,389
Master of his own vessel.
Home to his own sin.

825
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,331
He just cast out
all who had behaved.

826
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:53,802
Just exiled to the cargo hold

827
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,633
- to fend amongst themselves...
- (coughing)

828
01:07:55,671 --> 01:08:00,005
...and scavenge,
feeding off their own.

829
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,306
Evil grew.

830
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:05,802
The king no longer wanted to play.

831
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:09,340
So he returned
to his bed of slumber.

832
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,945
And while the king slept,

833
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,979
a whole new world of evil grew

834
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,753
as we wept.

835
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,488
Gallo's voice:
It starts with a shiver, an itch.

836
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,656
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

837
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,962
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

838
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,161
It has an emotional trigger effect.

839
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,572
(rumbling)

840
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,553
(chains rattling)

841
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,767
- (machinery humming)
- (grunting)

842
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,170
What are you doing?

843
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,184
He's gonna fucking eat us.

844
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:18,482
It's not personal, guys.

845
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:22,252
It's just survival of the fittest.

846
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:26,091
Or maybe it's the brightest.

847
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:28,289
You understand what I'm saying?

848
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,390
- You gassed us.
- Oh, yes.

849
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,196
And I'm sorry,
but I'm a little too old

850
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,760
and too tired for the honorable way
of hunting game.

851
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:39,399
You better make sure I'm dead...

852
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:42,569
(shouting in Vietnamese)

853
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:45,808
You don't have to do this.
We have to save the ship.

854
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:49,579
Don't sweat it
and save me the speeches.

855
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,416
I wouldn't have survived this long
if I had a heart.

856
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:57,553
You know, a strange thing,
the survival instinct.

857
01:09:57,593 --> 01:10:01,393
I mean, there's nothing really left
to live for.

858
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,991
Don't be fucking stupid.
I can save the fucking ship.

859
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:12,639
Question is,
what would be more stupid?

860
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,166
Trusting the ship will hold
to see another day

861
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,510
when it's kept me alive
for all these years?

862
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,674
Or trusting somebody

863
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,843
who's desperate enough
to say anything

864
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:26,116
just when I'm about to carve
a steak out of his girlfriend?

865
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:29,747
Listen to the ship.

866
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,589
What about the ship?

867
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,460
The power surges...

868
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:38,591
the reactor is in its final stage.

869
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,762
We have less time than I thought.

870
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:45,740
The final phase before shutdown,

871
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,140
before we lose everything

872
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,611
and everyone onboard.

873
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:54,548
If we don't reset it now,

874
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,814
everything is lost.

875
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:02,119
She has been all moody lately.

876
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,682
Very moody.

877
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,423
Hey, listen.

878
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,954
Hey, I get it.

879
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:13,560
What? You get what?

880
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,799
You did what you had to do.

881
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:20,502
You made it.
No one's gonna judge you.

882
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:23,067
No one's gonna judge you.

883
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,580
You are a survivor.

884
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:30,416
And right now we...

885
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,319
have to reset the reactor.

886
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,230
How long before the ship dies?

887
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,959
The truth.

888
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,661
I don't know.

889
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,466
Take a fucking guess.

890
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,906
An hour. Less.

891
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,289
- Well?
- We're in this together.

892
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,622
I need your radio.
We don't have much time.

893
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,891
Bower:
Payton, do you copy?

894
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:20,526
Do you copy?
Can you hear me?

895
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,697
Payton, do you copy?
Can you hear me?

896
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,934
I'm here.
Where are you?

897
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,738
Storage tank
somewhere below B level.

898
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:31,302
Midship sector 12, I think.

899
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,941
How the hell did you get all the way
to the other side of the ship?

900
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,973
The reactor is shutting down fast.

901
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,010
I need you to access the memory banks
from the last power surge

902
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:42,285
- and run a Kolzer complex test.
- Accessing memory banks now.

903
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,383
Running Kolzer complex.

904
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,598
You're not gonna like this.

905
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,898
Test says you have
less than 47 minutes

906
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,064
before complete system failure.

907
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,734
- That's not much time.
- How do we get you in there?

908
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:02,175
- I need you to give us a path.
- Copy.

909
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,407
Move it.

910
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,098
(screeches)

911
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,343
No. It's a child.

912
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,868
Child?
That's no fucking child.

913
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,938
(screeching)

914
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,014
They are breeding.

915
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,319
Little bastard.
He went and got daddy.

916
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,292
(roars)

917
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,302
This is not gonna work.
There's too many of them.

918
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,864
We must be close
to where they live.

919
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:09,639
Great.
Now we're fucking stuck here.

920
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,575
Gallo: What's so important
on the other side of that door?

921
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,107
The bridge.
We can take control of guidance

922
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,551
as soon as we get on the bridge.

923
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:21,147
How's that going to help?
This ship is dying.

924
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,715
We should be focusing
on how to save ourselves.

925
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:26,853
Oh, that's right.
The Boy Scout is going to save us.

926
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:28,795
He can do it.

927
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,663
24 hours ago
he didn't know his own name.

928
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:36,569
Now you think he's ready
to reconfigure

929
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,937
a nuclear reactor?

930
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,135
Leland:
If they don't leave soon,

931
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:43,235
there's no point in even going.

932
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,311
What are you doing?

933
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:48,942
These are our families

934
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,452
from flight personnel.

935
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,684
They're all dead.

936
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,951
You think she's here?

937
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,461
No, she's...

938
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,293
she's not here.

939
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,890
How do you know for sure?

940
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:08,198
'Cause she wouldn't come with me.

941
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:20,472
She's not on this flight.

942
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,541
She left me.

943
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,643
(wind howling)

944
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,127
There was nothing left for me,

945
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,103
so I enlisted.

946
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:46,073
She's the reason why I left.

947
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:51,012
Well, then she saved your life.

948
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,537
That's very tragic.

949
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:56,517
But we've got to move on.
I'm sick of this shit.

950
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,849
- For what?
- What?

951
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:59,683
- For what?
- Shh.

952
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,746
- They're all gone.
- Shh.

953
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,226
- There's nothing left.
- Shh! Shut your fucking mouth.

954
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,524
There's nothing left to go back to.

955
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,963
You're wrong.

956
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,933
Hey, we were meant to go on.

957
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:17,700
And we were meant to survive.

958
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,764
And now it's more
important than ever.

959
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,799
Leland:
We're wasting time.

960
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,368
- I remember.
- What?

961
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,645
Clock's ticking.

962
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:35,690
Payton's wife Marianne.

963
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:44,359
I remember.

964
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:49,636
Bower was right about one thing:

965
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:52,003
Once this thing shuts down
we are as good as dead.

966
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,201
What are you muttering about?

967
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:57,678
I'm saying once it's done
we're done.

968
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:00,045
But we still have a way out of this.

969
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:03,245
You're suggesting what, Corporal?

970
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,446
We can launch ourselves in the pods

971
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:08,888
before the ignition systems
are completely dead, sir.

972
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:11,017
That's suicide.

973
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,458
We can buy a few days,

974
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:14,485
which is better
than what we have left here.

975
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,765
Leland:
The reactor is close.

976
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,269
You can hear it breathe.

977
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:38,579
Yeah, this is it...

978
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,915
a descent into hell itself.

979
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:58,802
How long do you think that reactor
has been sitting there, huh?

980
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,365
That thing could melt down

981
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,071
when he tries to fire the core.

982
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,143
This ship could be ripped in half.

983
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,549
Stand down, Corporal.
We are not abandoning anything

984
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:12,780
and we are not leaving them behind.

985
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:15,688
We can't stay on this ship!
You know that!

986
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,591
I said stand down, Corporal!

987
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,723
That's an order.

988
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,100
(electricity crackling)

989
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:45,577
- Whoa!
- (metal creaks)

990
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,291
(growling)

991
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:52,554
Christ Almighty.

992
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:11,646
(grunts)

993
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,416
Don't let go.

994
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:59,593
(beeping)

995
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:04,554
He's in.

996
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,432
We're gonna get ourselves
out of this.

997
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,096
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

998
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:12,163
How can I trust someone who
isn't even honest with himself?

999
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:14,767
We still have time.

1000
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,711
- You have to listen to me.
- Don't do that.

1001
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,441
Don't do what?

1002
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,814
Don't talk to me like I'm some child
that needs reassurance.

1003
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,443
Then calm the fuck down.

1004
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:27,512
I know this ship and I know what
she's capable of better than anyone.

1005
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:31,117
I know what she can and can't do.
Why are we even arguing?

1006
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,389
If you want to stay here
to die that is your choice.

1007
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:36,727
- I gave you an order.
- Not mine. Not mine!

1008
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,232
Corporal.

1009
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:40,234
Who's the one being
irrational here, Lieutenant?

1010
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,361
Who's the one being delusional?

1011
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:45,202
I'm getting off this ship.
The flight is over.

1012
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,571
Over!

1013
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,579
(speaking Vietnamese)

1014
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,155
(growling)

1015
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,997
- Don't shoot yourself into space.
- Shut up.

1016
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:52,768
- I'm getting off this ship.
- Bower's going to reboot the reactor.

1017
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,502
Shut up.

1018
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:58,402
It wasn't the crew
that was sick, was it?

1019
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:00,471
- Finish the code.
- Look at yourself.

1020
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:03,382
- You're the one with the symptoms.
- Finish it!

1021
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,984
(pod humming)

1022
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,090
What are you doing?

1023
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,069
It's for your own good.

1024
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,367
What the fuck are you doing?

1025
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:26,340
You're not well.

1026
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:28,899
You just need the proper treatment.

1027
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,146
Let me out, God damn it!

1028
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:37,674
Open it!
That is an order, motherfucker!

1029
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:40,711
It's not your fault.

1030
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:44,247
I will cut you to fucking bits.
Open it!

1031
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,123
Open it!
I will carve you up!

1032
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:48,561
Your mind has turned
against itself.

1033
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:51,030
You're killing us!

1034
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:53,364
We are all going to die, Corporal.

1035
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,371
Holy fuck.

1036
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,462
(straining)

1037
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:53,860
- Oh, shit.
- (clanking)

1038
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:55,920
(roars)

1039
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:03,930
(roaring)

1040
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,014
(shouts in Vietnamese)

1041
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,323
(roars)

1042
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:53,213
They're coming.

1043
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:03,290
Hurry up!

1044
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,559
Shit.

1045
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:06,829
(howls)

1046
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:11,298
Come on, come on, come on.

1047
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:13,773
(humming loudly)

1048
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:31,282
(computers powering up)

1049
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:43,164
He did it.
Boy Scout did it.

1050
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:46,139
You were right.
Now let me out.

1051
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:48,540
I can help.

1052
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,567
I'll help you.

1053
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,009
What are you doing?

1054
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,177
Are you still trying
to get on the bridge?

1055
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:01,514
You do not want
to go in there, Corporal.

1056
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:06,125
What are you gonna tell them, huh?

1057
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:09,130
- Bower will be coming back here.
- Shut up.

1058
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,029
They'll know what you did.

1059
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:13,363
(laughs)

1060
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:17,027
(creatures roaring)

1061
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,399
(growling)

1062
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:52,071
(roars)

1063
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:53,698
(shouts)

1064
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:00,611
(screams)

1065
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:13,225
Where do you think you're going?

1066
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:14,888
Quiet.

1067
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:17,261
Think about what you're doing, sir.

1068
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:21,266
Shut the fuck up.

1069
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:25,029
They will never let you
get away with this.

1070
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,335
Shut up!

1071
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:45,156
They're everywhere.

1072
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:09,878
Asshole!

1073
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,689
(screaming)

1074
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:42,141
(groans)

1075
01:28:49,257 --> 01:28:51,987
(cooing)

1076
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:56,354
(grunts)

1077
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,093
- (screeches)
- (gurgles)

1078
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:08,199
(door bangs)

1079
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:13,446
We both know who needs this shot.

1080
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:16,746
- Stay back.
- Who's the one suffering here, sir?

1081
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:18,217
I mean it!

1082
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,612
What do you want from me?

1083
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:27,257
Your mind has turned against itself.

1084
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:32,898
I'm gonna fucking carve you up.

1085
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:41,969
(both grunting)

1086
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:48,472
Who are you?

1087
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:02,290
Leland:
Ahem. Made it.

1088
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:05,595
Whoo.

1089
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:07,464
I was with your boy.

1090
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:10,994
I helped him get all this started.

1091
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:12,733
I see you're a flyer too.

1092
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:14,674
(groans)

1093
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:21,978
(pounding at door)

1094
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,758
Ah.

1095
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:01,418
Where's your lieutenant?

1096
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,515
He's not my lieutenant.

1097
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:19,404
Where are we?

1098
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,032
What's happened to us?

1099
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:23,635
The flight log

1100
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:26,772
will tell us how long we've been out
and how far we've gone.

1101
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:37,985
(gasps)

1102
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:43,957
It seems

1103
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:47,126
my mild memory lapse

1104
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:49,261
has finally worn off, Lieutenant.

1105
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:51,328
Who the hell are you?

1106
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:54,671
Gallo, Corporal.

1107
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:57,200
I was younger than you
when I first came onboard.

1108
01:31:57,245 --> 01:32:01,181
Funny, I can't even remember what life
was like before this flight began.

1109
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:03,080
It's all I have.

1110
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:06,780
You're the one who received
the final transmission.

1111
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:08,516
You stayed awake.
You broke the rotation.

1112
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:10,717
You killed your crew.

1113
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:13,886
How the hell would you know that?

1114
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:15,896
Where are we?

1115
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,993
Go ahead, take a peek.

1116
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:23,299
(metal grinding)

1117
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:30,940
You tell me.

1118
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:38,477
What have you done with us?

1119
01:32:38,519 --> 01:32:40,316
You don't get it, kid.

1120
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:42,584
There's no one left to judge.

1121
01:32:42,623 --> 01:32:46,184
Where are the stars?
Oh my God.

1122
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,627
God?
You think God survived?

1123
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:51,154
He's dead along with
the rest of humanity.

1124
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:53,063
There's no law or order,

1125
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:54,795
no good or evil.
Just us.

1126
01:32:54,835 --> 01:32:58,327
And you think you're going
to be the one to judge me?

1127
01:32:58,372 --> 01:32:59,634
You want to take a shot at me?

1128
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:01,335
You know what?
I just might.

1129
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:02,808
You are suffering, son.

1130
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:06,404
I can see it in your face.
I've been there.

1131
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:09,007
Just imagine just for a minute,

1132
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:12,110
imagine yourself without the chains
of your morality.

1133
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,087
You'd even surprise yourself.

1134
01:33:14,121 --> 01:33:15,952
It's the ultimate freedom.

1135
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:17,924
No.

1136
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:20,086
This isn't freedom.

1137
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:22,118
This is pandorum.

1138
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:25,963
Oh, pandorum. Pandorum isn't
what they warned us about.

1139
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,025
I know it's frightening at first,
terrifying in fact.

1140
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:30,867
Isn't that what you're feeling right now,
terrible fear?

1141
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:34,500
Let go and on the other side
of it is divine clarity.

1142
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,203
Purity.
Enlightenment.

1143
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:38,211
Shut up!
What's out there?

1144
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,873
You are resisting what is.

1145
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:43,816
You have to let go of
your petty concept of reality.

1146
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:46,012
That's just baggage
from the old world.

1147
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:48,749
And we both know that didn't work
out very well now, did it?

1148
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:52,691
They fucked up our planet.
Life eats life.

1149
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:55,958
And all that's left is what is.

1150
01:33:55,997 --> 01:33:58,056
This ship is a seed

1151
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:00,659
from which we can create a new world.

1152
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:01,861
Shut up!
What's out there?!

1153
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:03,665
A new world.
A natural state.

1154
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:05,899
- Raw, beautiful...
- What do you see?

1155
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:09,137
...perfect.
I am offering you the kingdom.

1156
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:11,804
- (banging)
- And all that's holding you back

1157
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:13,507
is your own fear.

1158
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,684
Still the Boy Scout,
hey, kid?

1159
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:20,278
There will always be law

1160
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,915
and you will pay
for what you've done.

1161
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:26,688
Even if that means I have
to pull the sick out of you.

1162
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:29,560
(gagging, groaning)

1163
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:31,428
- Bower!
- What is it?

1164
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:35,062
(groans)

1165
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:45,576
(high-pitched whining)

1166
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:49,847
(both gasp)

1167
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:55,579
We've already crashed.

1168
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:59,286
We've been on Tanis
all this time.

1169
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:02,786
All this time.

1170
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:09,497
I guess this thing
does land itself.

1171
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,505
Doesn't float too well though,
does it?

1172
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,139
Let go of your fear.

1173
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,974
This is where I'll push through.

1174
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:27,977
Shh shh.

1175
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,922
They're coming in.

1176
01:35:29,957 --> 01:35:32,016
(pounding)

1177
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:36,290
Attaboy.

1178
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,325
(gasping)

1179
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:20,169
They're coming in.

1180
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:22,937
What are you doing?

1181
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:33,344
Why don't you shoot?

1182
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:43,020
(cracking)

1183
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:50,728
(metal groaning)

1184
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:17,621
(alarm sounding)

1185
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:32,405
Are you crazy?

1186
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:41,782
- Do you see that?
- Fuck him.

1187
01:37:41,822 --> 01:37:43,847
- We need to get out of here.
- Hold on.

1188
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:46,951
Not like this.
We can't die like this.

1189
01:37:46,994 --> 01:37:48,427
Hold on.

1190
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:55,064
(growls)

1191
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,679
(gasping)

1192
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:20,259
(gasping)

1193
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:26,962
What?
No, I can't...

1194
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:28,730
Just breathe.

1195
01:39:16,817 --> 01:39:18,751
(coughing)

1196
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:31,389
(coughs)

1197
01:39:33,767 --> 01:39:36,099
Hey. Hey.

1198
01:39:42,676 --> 01:39:44,166
Just breathe.

1199
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:49,108
It's safe to wake up now.

1200
01:41:26,346 --> 01:41:29,281
(instrumental music playing)
