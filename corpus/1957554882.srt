I have to get back.

346
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,030
I have a little daughter,
Heather. She's 4.

347
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,100
So you're a mother?
Mmm-hmm.

348
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,200
I miss her when I'm away.

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,070
Oh, kids are great.
I love 'em.

350
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,040
I envy blokes
who have 'em.

351
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,140
I plan to have a family
of my own some day.

352
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,180
[Motorcycle engine rumbling]

353
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,100
Heather!

354
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,060
[Laughing] Where are
your clothes, monkey?

355
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,110
I took 'em off.

356
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,220
Can I take your picture?
Come here.

357
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,110
Oh, you look perfect.

358
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,200
Put your arms right here.

359
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,080
(Man) Hi, how are you?

[Clicks]

361
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,090
That's good.

362
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,200
Danny, I'm in love.

363
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,090
Yeah, so what's he like?

364
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,070
Did you sleep with him?
None of your business.

365
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,230
Well, did you?

366
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,120
Why does it matter?

367
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,120
Linda.
Danny.

368
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,090
No, I didn't.

369
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,180
We are talking
about Paul McCartney
of the Beatles?

370
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,040
Heartthrob of millions?

371
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,050
Ok, so you didn't have
sex with him.

372
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,210
You've spent no time alone.
You don't know when
you'll see him again.

373
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,090
And you were together
for what, like, an hour?

374
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,200
Mmm.

375
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,190
Do you want
something to drink?
Yeah.

376
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,070
Danny, when have
I ever said that
I was in love?

377
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,190
Honey, what about
this actress,

378
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,200
uh, what's her name?
Jane something.

379
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,220
He's been living with her
for 5 years.
He'll never marry her.

380
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Has he asked you?

381
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,200
He doesn't know
my number.

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,210
(Linda) I didn't see Paul
for a whole year,

383
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,150
but from the moment
we met, I somehow knew
we'd meet again.

[Male announcer chattering
on TV.]

385
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,130
In 1968, he and John
came to New York

386
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,040
to announce
their new company,
apple records.

(Male reporter #2)
Are you planning to leave
your old label, boys?

389
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,110
Was there a falling out?

390
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,120
It's all about
the music, lads.

391
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,080
Teamwork, integrity,
working together as a band.

392

(Paul) Artistic freedom.

393

It's the, uh,
it's the Beatles answer
to men in suits.

You know,
controlled weirdness,

395
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,100
'cause the, uh,
the bosses aren't in it
for the profits.

396
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,100
Yeah. A kind
of western communism.

Hi, it's Linda eastman.
Are there any messages?

(Woman) Yeah.
Paul McCartney
from London.

406

He did-- did-- he did?

407
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,210
Did--did he leave a number?

408
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,140
No. He's on his way
to Los Angeles

409
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,030
and would like you
to meet him there
at the Beverly Hills hotel.

What are you doing?

Is that a real place?

Mmm-hmm. In Arizona.

430
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,180
I always dream
of a little house there,
an adobe,

431

and a-- and a horse.

432
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,200
Is that where you grew up?

it was salamanders.

she used to say,
"hey, just let it be, son."

or something,
just let it be.

Mary McCartney.

458
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,220
Oh, she never said
a word to the doctors

459
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,080
or any of the nurses
about the lump
in her breast

460
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,200
or the pain.

461
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,130
Typical nurse perhaps.

but not herself, you know?

463
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,000

the mastectomy,
it was too late.

And one terrible night,
US boys went down
the hospital.

Oh, they must have known
she was dying,

but we didn't really know
what was happening.

our last visit.

forgotten that story

Paul told me 27 years ago.

473
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,120
I felt his pain,
and I never wanted him
to feel that way again.

A lump?
What kind of lump?

481
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,140
It's nothing. It's like
this little swollen gland
or something.

482
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,140
The doctor said
it was a virus
or a flu or something,

483
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,000
and he's having me
take antibiotics
and rest and...

Does Paul know?

00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,230
Do you want
to try my chili?

you had a mammogram?

if ever.

493
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,060

this checked out.

And tell your husband,
for god's sakes.

It's all right, baby.
It's all right.

I'm so sorry.

your fault, ok?

There are so many
things I can do,
and I can beat this.

I know I can.

early, didn't you?
You caught it early.

517

You didn't even know
it was there.

518
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,010
I think, maybe--

Oh.

[Sighing]

1375
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,060
It's the nights
that are worse, eh?

1376
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,220
That's when all the fears
come creeping in.

1377
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,060
I just wish
I could see
more progress.

1379
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,150
Come here, you.

1380
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:23,080
They warned US it'd be
a slow process.

1381
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,100
At least they haven't
used the word "aggressive."

1382
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,020
You know it's bad
when they say that.

1383
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,080
I haven't heard
that word.

1384
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:38,090
If I die, it'll be a family
without a mother.

1385

Lin, please don't.

1386
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,060
Sometimes it's so hard.

1387
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,100
Sometimes I just
wanna give up.

1388
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:52,150
Please.

1389
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,150
Don't.

1390
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:06,110
Your tests look fine.

1391
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,070
No sign of cancer
in either breast.
Yeah?

1392
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:11,070
It's gone.
So that trip in la
was worth it.

1393
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:14,070
Well, I wish I could say
that but it's
too soon to tell.

1394
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,060
The cancer's in remission,
not gone.

1395
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,030
So far we can only
hope to contain it,

1396
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:20,140
not cure it.
But it's good news.

1397
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,100
Contain it?
For how long?

1398
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:24,160
That's impossible to tell.

1399
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,090
You'll need to be monitored
in London every
two weeks to make sure.

1400
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:29,150
So I can do
whatever I want?

That could be a great
album cover, babe.

1408
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:56,020
Mum, it says parsley.
Are you sure
you don't mean basil?

1409
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,200
Hmm.

Oh. Oh, no.
You're right.

1411

It-- it is basil.

Call the editor.

1413
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,140
(Linda) I want to include
the flowers that I took

1414
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:14,010
in the photo show,
and let's include
these ferns.

ready Friday,

on my dress.

Oh, I hope she has
something for me.

coming up.

as always.

Of course, we can.

1425

Yeah, but we'll have
to pick it up a bit
'cause the tide's coming in.

1426

I want shells.
What?

It's shells,
it's shells you like.
Oh, Paul.

do you think that
it might be possible
to move up the date?

Why, mum?

going well.

happen to me,

01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:37,190
She lives on
in all of them.

1546
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,230
I'm privileged to have been
her lover for 30 years,

1547
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:42,160
and in all that time,
except for one absence,

1548
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,010
we never spent
a single night apart.

1549
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:49,040
She was the kindest woman
I ever met.

1550
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:52,070
She was unique.

1551
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:55,180
And the world
is a better place
for having known her.

1552
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:59,030
Her message of love
will live in
our hearts forever.

1553
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:03,000
I love you, Linda.
