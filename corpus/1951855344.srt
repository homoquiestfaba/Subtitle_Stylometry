VOYAGES AND GRAVELS

5
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:03,815
Where is the rat?

6
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:07,287
She's behind the curtaim. where she always hides.

7
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:31,756
Mama! Jane has knocked me down! 

8
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:36,699
Take her up to the redroom immediately.

9
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:40,746
The child has the devil in her. I've always said.

10
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:44,543
No! No! Not the redroom! No!No!Not the redroom!

11
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:46,788
No!

12
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:58,692
Don't come back, Uncle Reed. Please don't come back.

13
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:03,678
Uncle Reed, please don't come back. Please.

14
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:20,272
Let me out! Please help me. Just let me out! let me out!

15
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,648
Come along, John          Yes, come on, John, we haven't got all day.

16
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:32,563
Don't worry. I won't shoot you.

17
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,998
Unless we don't like the painting, that is .

18
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:43,582
Hello.

19
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:47,572
Shouldn't you be in the portrait? There's still plenty of room.

20
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,853
Jane Eyre?          She's not part of the family.

21
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:02,852
It's no use looking at me like that, Jane.

22
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:08,043
I have tried my hardest, but you made it impossible.

23
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:12,724
I tried to carry out my dear husband's wishes.

24
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:16,640
But you have made it impossible. You know you have.

25
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:22,097
You have deliberately made it impossible for me to love you.

26
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:33,072
Say something, unnatural child!

27
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:38,470
You have not tried very hard.

28
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:44,058
My uncle's dying wish was that you treat me as one of your children.

29
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:46,829
You have not tried to.

30
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,453
You dare to tell me...

31
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:53,773
That is why he haunts the redroom.

32
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:55,545
Because you've disobeyed him.

33
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:59,815
And on the day you die, God will know who is telling the truth.

34
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,347
Whatever you or I say now.

35
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:08,139
Come on, Miss Jane. You have a visitor. You must look your best.

36
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,576
I have tried so very hard.

37
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:16,883
You cannot believe how hard I have tried but...

38
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:23,091
There is the devil in the child.

39
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,405
What is your name, child?

40
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,070
Jane Eyre, sir.

41
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:36,087
Do you know, Jane Eyre, what happens to little children when they die?

42
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:37,509
They go to heaven.

43
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,958
And what happens to disobedient deceitful girls when they die?

44
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,956
They go to hell...

45
00:05:44,957 --> 00:05:49,527
So what must you do to avoid this terrible fate?

46
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:54,964
I must take care to keep in good health 

47
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,121
and not to fall ill, sir.

48
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,843
Your aunt tells me that you are a deceitful child.

49
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:06,620
Is that true, Jane Eyre?

50
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,588
I am not a liar.

51
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,053
So do you say your aunt is a liar?

52
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:32,897
Ah, Jane Eyre...

53
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:37,398
How could I forget? Step out here, Jane.

54
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:03,836
Jane Eyre, I'm sorry to have to tell you, 

55
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,870
is a liar.

56
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:10,207
The lesson of the day will be that lying is a sin.

57
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:15,103
That all liars deserve to be shunned by their fellows.

58
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,843
 LIAR

59
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:28,612
Stand on that stool, Jane.

60
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:41,098
You will stay there until midnight, 

61
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:44,902
and you will not eat or drink 

62
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:50,428
but bow to beg God's forgiveness for your sin.

63
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,560
I wish I could escape to one of these places.

64
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,371
Somewhere where it's warm.

65
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:32,404
I believe you will.

66
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:34,930
But you'll have to work hard.

67
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:37,456
You have to accept that we've been left here by 

68
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,111
our families to fend for ourselves.

69
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,091
If you take advantage of the education here, .

70
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:47,189
if you are not too rebellious, and if you are patient, then you will find your way out.

71
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:49,237
We will both work our hardest 

72
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:52,055
and pray that God spares us until we are grown up.

73
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,784
And then what do we do?

74
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:57,544
I think when we grow up, we have to be teachers.

75
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:00,226
How do we ever get out of here, Helen?

76
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,596
We advertise.

77
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:16,361
There you are.

78
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,226
You're very cold, Jane.

79
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,744
Come on under my covers.

80
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:35,682
No, no!

81
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,897
God can't have her! He can't take her!

82
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:41,450
God has already taken her, Jane.  

83
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,415
You must be brave.

84
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:57,415
Helen, Helen. Helen, Helen.

85
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,834
Girls

86
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:14,105
 look how the sun casts shadows on the flowers.

87
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:30,005
Helen Burns 1817 - 1829

88
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,934
Come on, girls, hurry up now.

89
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,812
Miss Eyre. 

90
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:07,862
There appears to be a letter for you, Miss Eyre.

91
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:36,000
If Miss J.E. is in a position to give satisfactory references

91
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,994
as to character and competency, 

92
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:40,099
"then we will be happy to engage her 

92
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,099
as a governess to Miss Adele Varens, 

93
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:45,759
"ward of Mr. Rochester of Thornfield Hall."

94
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:07,848
Ah, there's Thornfield Hall now, miss.

95
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,198
There's always a light burning in the tower.

96
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:17,092
Are you taking me to Mrs Fairfax?

97
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:29,250
In there.

98
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,177
Why, it's Miss Eyre!

99
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,413
At last!

100
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:54,820
Oh, we've been waiting for you for so long!

101
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:59,253
Oh, I'm Mrs. Fairfax. Welcome to Thornfield.

102
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:05,788
My goodness, Miss Eyre. How hungry you are.

103
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:07,651
You must have been travelling all day.

104
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:12,979
How long is it since you have sat beside the fire and eaten a hearty meal?

105
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:17,291
Oh, approximately eight years.

106
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:20,164
Oh, my goodness.

107
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:23,709
Eight years?

108
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,318
Hasn't sat by the fire for eight years?

109
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,564
Eight years. 

110
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,467
I'll tell the master that when he gets back from abroad.

111
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,080
That will amuse even him. 

112
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:40,988
Oh, not that he's without humour, of course.

113
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,932
Certainly not.

114
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,790
I remember he used to tell jokes as a child.

115
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:50,901
He keeps himself to himself, but you needn't worry.  

116
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:54,517
He's hardly ever at home. Always travelling.

117
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:27,322
Miss Eyre.

118
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,471
You are up early. I hope you slept well.

119
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:34,092
Yes, thank you. I was anxious to meet Adele.

120
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,079
Ah, yes. Well, you won't have to wait long.

121
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,194
Does she play up there?

122
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,241
Oh, goodness me, no. 

123
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:41,756
 no one lives up there.

124
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:44,128
Oh, I thought I saw someone at the window.

125
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:47,180
There's only Grace Poole there.She does the laundry.  

126
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:47,969
 Ah!          Mrs. Fairfax...

127
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:50,565
I don't think Miss Adele can wait any longer.

128
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:06,654
My lover gets jealous...I'm such a flirt!

129
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:11,205
I love pretty dresses... He loves his money

130
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:17,349
I'm always losing my temper! He's so impossible

131
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,363
Bonjour Mademoiselle Jane, encantada de conocerla.

132
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,063
(French)

133
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:35,731
Oh, thank goodness you will be able to understand her.

134
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,394
Now you can tell me what she is singing.

135
00:22:40,974 --> 00:22:42,192
Well,

136
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:45,662
I believe it is a romance.

137
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:50,883
The woman is declaring her love for her sweetheart.

138
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,513
Merci,merci,merci. I will dance another one.

139
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,313
Later, maybe..

140
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,627
But first you will show me to our school room.

141
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,652
Damn it! Christ!

142
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:47,867
Quiet, Pilot!

143
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:51,482
Damn it.          Are you injured, sir?

144
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,756
Get away from me.

145
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:54,723
Witch,

146
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:56,533
you've done enough damage.

147
00:25:56,716 --> 00:25:59,429
I cannot think of leaving you, until I see you are fit to mount your horse.

148
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:05,448
You should be at home yourself, where do you live?

149
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:09,060
At Thornfield Hall. I can fetch help, I'll ve a little while.

150
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:19,466
Do you think you can bring him over to me?

151
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:37,832
Come over here,

152
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:39,919
 come.

153
00:26:58,197 --> 00:26:59,746
Come here, come here.

154
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:03,123
Hold this.

155
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:21,980
Thank you, Miss...           Jane Eyre, sir.

156
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:26,769
Well, that's what happens when you bewitch a man's horse, Miss Eyre.

157
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:28,387
A lot of pain and cursing.

158
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:30,123
I did not bewitch your horse, sir. 

159
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:31,895
I was waiting for you to go past.

160
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:35,261
You were hovering. Casting spells.

161
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:39,383
Now get off back to Thornfield hall, if that is indeed where you live.

162
00:27:39,384 --> 00:27:40,759
I do.

163
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,858
But I will post my letter first. Before I return.

164
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:47,857
Don't be late back...

165
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:52,373
Miss Jane Eyre

166
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:28,706
Ah, Miss Eyre, there you are.

167
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,514
What do you think? The master is back.

168
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:32,558
Mr. Rochester.?

169
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,363
Not a word about his return, as usual,

170
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:38,086
and he had an accident on the road.

171
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:40,267
The doctor is with him in the drawing room now.

172
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:41,642
Adele, come away!

173
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:43,234
Time for bed.

174
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:46,462
Mr. Rochester will see you tomorrow.

175
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:01,401
Miss Eyre,

176
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,058
Make yourself ready.

177
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:08,416
Master has finished his business for the day and wishes to see you.

178
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,197
Me?

179
00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:10,602
Yes.

180
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:14,072
Oh, no, no, no. you must change.

181
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:24,894
This will have to do.

182
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,284
This will have to do.

183
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:07,620
Ah, Miss Eyre.

184
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:13,420
(French)

185
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,837
Does Miss Eyre require a present?

186
00:30:15,838 --> 00:30:17,137
Excuse me, sir?


187
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:19,500
Does the governess expect me to have brought her 

187
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,313
a present back from my travels overseas?

188
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:22,549
No, sir.

189
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,431
What are you doing standing over there where I can't see you?

190
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:28,815
Where would you like me to stand, sir?          Here, sit.

191
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:41,418
Are you fond of presents, Miss Eyre?

192
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:44,357
I haredly know, sir. 

193
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:46,270
 I have little experience of them.

194
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,124
Never had a present?

195
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:51,270
I believe they are generally thought pleasant things, sir.

196
00:30:53,614 --> 00:30:58,039
But to this frivolous little doll, this true daughter of Paris,

197
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,352
they are the stuff of life, aren't they, my little...

198
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,063
the thought of presents makes her live and breathe.

199
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:05,744
Monsieur Rochester?

199
00:31:12,864 --> 00:31:15,244
(French)

200
00:31:16,064 --> 00:31:18,244
Quiet! While I talk to Miss Eyre.

201
00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:27,231
Where are you from?

202
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,789
Lowood Institution, sir.          How long were you there?

203
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,096
Eight years.

204
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:34,704
I'm amazed you survived. You're so small.

205
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:37,773
Didn't they feed you?          No, sir.

206
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:42,580
And how do you find yourself here and not still there?

207
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:44,300
I advertised, sir.

208
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:48,618
Of course you did.

209
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:51,469
What of your family?

210
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,755
I have none, sir.

211
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:54,804
None whatsoever?

212
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,652
Friends?

213
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:00,515
None, sir.          None at all?

214
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,199
I had a friend once. But she died a long time ago, sir.

215
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:09,006
You're lucky, Miss Eyre.

216
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,863
If you do not love another living soul,

217
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,875
then you'll never be disappointed.

218
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:19,539
Yes, sir.

219
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:29,610
Adele tells me you play the piano brilliantly.

220
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:33,973
I play a little, sir.          Of course, a little, that's what they all say.

221
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:36,046
Go over there and play.

222
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,722
Enough!

223
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:12,662
Yes. You're right. You do play a little.

224
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:15,852
These yours?

225
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,301
Yes, sir.

226
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:22,761
These are...

227
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:27,752
These are interesting.

228
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,755
The ideas all yours?

229
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:31,469
Yes, sir.

230
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,868
Were you happy when you painted these?

231
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,745
I was fully occupied.  

232
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:41,623
I was not unhappy.

233
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:46,882
What do you think of me, Monsieur? Do you think I look beautiful?

234
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:49,502
Shall I dance for you?          Miss Eyre, what are you thinking of?

235
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:51,722
It's very late. Adele should be in bed.

236
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,578
And my foot hurts like the blazes.

237
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:02,453
Good night, sir.

238
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,497
So,

239
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:13,579
What did you think of Master?

240
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,996
He is very changeable.          Yes.

241
00:34:18,996 --> 00:34:23,995
But he has... He has had disappointments in his life.

242
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:28,073
I hope you will forgive his rough and ready ways. You will not leave.

243
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,000
I've grown used to you.

244
00:34:34,314 --> 00:34:36,476
I hope he won't scare you away.

245
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:40,064
I am not scared of rough manners.

246
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:42,531
He will be gone soon.

247
00:34:42,532 --> 00:34:45,574
He never stays for more than a few days at a time.

248
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:57,103
Afternoon,miss.

249
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,713
Miss Eyre, come here.

250
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:30,502
Sit.

251
00:35:31,815 --> 00:35:33,215
Not you, Pilot.

252
00:35:33,568 --> 00:35:36,433
Miss Eyre, excuse me.

253
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,688
I am used to giving orders and having them obeyed.

254
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:41,474
Sit, if you please.

255
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:53,079
I beg your pardon, sir, I did not ask your permission to read the books.

256
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,584
Permission? To read the books?

257
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:58,558
You are a thinking, intelligent woman, aren't you??

258
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,595
Why ever would you need to ask permission?

259
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:06,648
Who else is to read them? Adele? The venerable Fairfax?

260
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:10,456
I'd more likely find Pilot poring over the flora and fauna  

262
00:36:10,457 --> 00:36:13,353
of the South American flatlands.

263
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:18,524
So, anyway, talk.

264
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,411
Talk, sir?          Yes, talk, if you please.

265
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,479
See how I'm learning to be polite.

266
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:33,000
I had a tedious day of mortgages and share prices

267
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,704
and I would like to be entertained.

268
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:38,590
Entertained, sir?          Miss Eyre, can we proceed?

269
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:46,462
When I am tired, I tend to dwell on my darker thoughts.

270
00:36:46,463 --> 00:36:48,304
I would like to entertain you, sir.

271
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,229
I am not sure what would interest you, though.

272
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:56,888
A smile.

273
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:59,134
A very small one. 

274
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:02,695
The mere glimpse of a smile. At last! Tell me your thoughts. I command you.

275
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:04,362
I was just thinking, sir, it's...

276
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:09,220
Not many employers would ask the opinion of someone they pay &30 a year to.

277
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,030
I pay you a salary, do I?

278
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:14,345
Well, of course I do. Well, I should have my money's worth, then.

279
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:19,304
I can see there is another problem. Out with it.

280
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:22,765
You haven't actually paid me anything yet, sir.

281
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:24,201
 mercenary girl!

282
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:28,481
Fetch me my keys now! You want my money in your hand before you will amuse me?

283
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:30,169
No, sir. That will not be necessary, sir.

284
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,577
Maybe you could ask questions, sir?

285
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,762
Have you travelled, Miss Eyre?

286
00:37:41,278 --> 00:37:42,419
No,sir.

287
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:45,488
All young people wish to travel.

288
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:51,949
Even if they find kindness and food and a fire, they wish to be gone.

289
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,074
I have travelled all over the world,Miss Eyre.

290
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:58,646
And it's very overrated.

291
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:01,985
Yes,sir.

292
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:06,831
When I was a young man, I was your equal.

293
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,865
I had a clear conscience,

294
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:13,025
unpolluted by sin.

295
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,780
I took the wrong path.

296
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:22,470
It wasn't my fault that I took it, but...

297
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:27,460
I must bear the blame for continuing on it.

298
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:37,345
I think you may have a little of the witch about you.

299
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,611
You bewitched my horse.

300
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:43,045
You sit there, patiently,

301
00:38:43,046 --> 00:38:45,848
and would draw out secrets of my past.

302
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:47,635
I do not wish to pry,sir.

303
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,894
I know,Jane.

304
00:38:57,473 --> 00:39:00,312
Do you think me handsome, Jane?          No,sir.

305
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,246
Look carefully.

306
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:14,076
If I were to tell you that I'm worth &20,000 ,

307
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:18,776
Surely the light from the fire would soften my features.

308
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:24,814
Do I not now seem to you now the very model of a fashionable man?

309
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:28,238
I do not think there is anything in science that will allow that, sir.

310
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:35,274
I spoke hastily,sir, I did not mean that I find you repellent...

311
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,693
What I meant is that 

312
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:45,250
it is the character inside that determines a person

313
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:47,424
not the outer shell.

314
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:49,249
Take care,Jane.

315
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,648
Don't look too closely inside of me.

316
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:58,350
You might not find anything within at all beautiful.

317
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,526
And then where would we be?

318
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:07,014
Not important, no.

319
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,453
Is that Grace Poole?

320
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:15,974
Does she live alone in the North Tower?

321
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:19,578
North Tower catches the wind. I don't know why,

322
00:40:19,578 --> 00:40:22,197
 it makes me shiver just to think of it.

323
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,716
Miss Eyre, 

324
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:37,444
you're required!

325
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,794
This way,hurry up.

326
00:40:42,795 --> 00:40:44,509
Oh,goodness, Miss Eyre.

327
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,639
The master has taken it into his head to give Adele a biology lesson,

328
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:49,910
and we all have to hunt beetles.

329
00:40:56,644 --> 00:41:00,759
Monsieur Rochester,we are bored with looking at the English water beetles.

330
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:03,888
They are not beautiful like the ones in your study.

331
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:09,264
Can I go with you, Monsieur Rochester,when you set off on your travels once more?

332
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:12,852
I will always wear my best dress and everyone will think I am pretty.

333
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,122
yes

334
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:17,092
but if they see you for the shallow little creature that you are,

335
00:41:17,093 --> 00:41:21,013
no more substance than one of those meringues over there, well, 

336
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:24,248
then they will find you disgusting,my little Parisienne.

337
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,393
They would find me disgusting!

338
00:41:38,316 --> 00:41:42,677
You are mistaken, Adele, if you do not think to find interesting creatures here in England.

339
00:41:44,848 --> 00:41:46,336
There's a bird. it's a...

340
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:51,647
It's a quite nondescript grey colour 

341
00:41:51,648 --> 00:41:54,284
and it's accustomed not to moving too quickly, 

342
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:57,905
not to draw attention to itself for fear of being beaten.

343
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,862
It wishes it could be in a cage.

344
00:42:01,713 --> 00:42:02,796
But, sooner or later, 

345
00:42:02,797 --> 00:42:03,936
slowly,

346
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:06,573
day by day, its wings grow very strong 

347
00:42:06,573 --> 00:42:08,657
nd if you were to look very closely, 

348
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:13,952
you would see brilliant scarlet feathers hidden under its drab wings.

349
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:17,794
Until one day, it has grown so confident 

350
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:21,426
that it flaps its red wings and flies straight upwards into the sky 

351
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:24,059
and those lucky enough to catch it in flight 

352
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,323
think that they have caught a glimpse

353
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:28,415
of a firebird.

354
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:29,718
And then?

355
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:35,314
Well, then it flies away somewhere warm and never comes back.

356
00:42:35,315 --> 00:42:37,313
I don't think I believe in this bird.

357
00:42:37,314 --> 00:42:38,570
It's true.

358
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:42,534
There is one here at Thornfield in the gardens if you look very hard.

359
00:42:45,548 --> 00:42:46,446
Madame Fairfax, 

360
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:49,927
Monsieur Rochester said the ladies will say I'm disgusting.

361
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:51,827
Oh, that's nice, dear.

362
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:04,930
Come, Miss Eyre, you have something to say?

363
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,940
You should not tease, sir. She is just a child.

364
00:43:09,718 --> 00:43:13,543
She is. But she's also selfobsessed,   

365
00:43:14,107 --> 00:43:15,636
thoughtless, vain.

366
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,763
You've made great headway with her even in the past few months,

367
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:20,261
but look at her.

368
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:22,789
Just like her mother.

369
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,749
I saw what the mother became.

370
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,861
That is no reason to despise the child.

371
00:43:31,802 --> 00:43:33,024
Do you really think?

372
00:43:35,998 --> 00:43:39,841
If the blood is tainted, won't I be failing in my duty to her to let her remain like this 

373
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:42,562
and not to try my best to correct her ways?

374
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:48,059
She does not deserve to be ridiculed or despised.

375
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,888
She's a child,

376
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:53,318
She deserves that you should trust her.

377
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:55,847
That she'll grow and learn and...           Miss Eyre?

378
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,807
No, thank you, Adele.

379
00:43:59,454 --> 00:44:01,118
We shall see, Miss Eyre.

380
00:44:03,545 --> 00:44:04,275
Come on.

381
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,475
Adele, don't run! 

382
00:44:08,475 --> 00:44:10,154
 What's the matter with Sophie?

383
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:14,371
She doesn't like les malades, the mad people.

384
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:43,896
No, Pilot. No, you don't belong here.

385
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:48,272
Go back to your master.          Pilot, come here!

386
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:05,626
Jane,

387
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:08,417
come and look at this fellow.

388
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:21,836
Look at his wings.

389
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,668
I have seen one like this in the West Indies, but never here.

390
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:29,754
That will teach me to tease Adele.

391
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:36,422
Come, sit down with me for a while.

392
00:46:41,629 --> 00:46:42,589
Sit 

393
00:46:56,288 --> 00:47:00,391
As it is now your job as well as mine to bring Adele up correctly, 

394
00:47:01,547 --> 00:47:02,936
I am going to tell you about her.

395
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:06,958
About where she came from and who she belongs to.

396
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:11,141
Maybe you'll understand.          You do not need to tell me anything.

397
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:12,535
I know.

398
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,149
You understand too much without me saying anything.

399
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:18,959
It is the witch in you.

400
00:47:23,065 --> 00:47:27,537
You have to imagine a young man. Well, one who is still youngish 

401
00:47:27,538 --> 00:47:32,601
and who has made a mistake, not his fault, but ...

402
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:38,137
this mistake and the darkness that follows it  

403
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:45,755
have set him helterskelter around the world in search of beauty to help ease his soul.

404
00:47:45,755 --> 00:47:48,516
And he does find beauty, 

405
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:51,907
or rather, beauty finds him because,

406
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:56,847
as you will guess, this is a very rich youngish man.

407
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,572
That look.

408
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:07,950
No judgement, no pity.

409
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:13,890
That look could prise secrets from the blackest souls.

410
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,695
Where were we?

411
00:48:21,643 --> 00:48:24,930
Beauty finding a youngish man.          Ah, yes.

412
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:30,092
So, on our whirlwind tour, we alight in Paris.

413
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:34,713
Now, Jane, imagine, I know it's difficult.

414
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:39,772
Imagine a suite of rooms in a particularly gorgeous Parisian hotel.

415
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,611
It is upholstered with velvets and furs. Everything is sensuous to the touch,  

416
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:48,834
the best that this youngish man's money can buy.

417
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,762
It is a summer evening 

418
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,555
and there is perfume in the air.

419
00:48:55,785 --> 00:48:58,798
The young man breathes in the scent of his lover,

420
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,196
musk and amber.

421
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:08,114
Her name is Celine Varens. She is very beautiful.

422
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:10,234
She is a dancer.

423
00:49:11,154 --> 00:49:13,684
An exotic bird.

424
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:16,833
She dotes on him 

425
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:19,978
and he is passionately in love with her.

426
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:23,066
He's had a fortunate night gambling, 

427
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:27,101
and he waits for her now in anticipation of the dark,

428
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:31,204
intoxicating hours ahead. Are you still with me, Jane?

429
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,246
I am here, sir.

430
00:49:36,626 --> 00:49:39,115
At last, he hears the sound of her return.

431
00:49:39,116 --> 00:49:41,759
Only a few more seconds' wait until he sees her.

432
00:49:43,546 --> 00:49:45,340
An eternity passes.

433
00:49:51,228 --> 00:49:55,782
At that very moment...as I stood in the shadows, 

434
00:49:57,436 --> 00:50:00,038
the green snake of jealousy bit into my heart.

435
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,227
Where is your beast of an Englishman tonight?

436
00:50:02,228 --> 00:50:03,684
Gambling.

437
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:06,651
Someone else can look at his unpleasant face.

438
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:12,355
He is very presentable, really, 

439
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:14,122
for an Englishman.

440
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:17,879
&20,000 pounds make him very presentable.

441
00:50:26,225 --> 00:50:28,460
She wasn't as clearsighted as you are, Jane.

442
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,655
You find me unattractive despite my wealth.

443
00:50:36,964 --> 00:50:40,422
You do not know what it is to feel jealousy, do you, Jane?

444
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:44,512
Because you have no idea what it is to love.

445
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:51,653
You have no idea what it is to feel the very beat of someone's heart within one's breast.

446
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,607
No, sir.

447
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,932
Do you still love her, sir?

448
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:06,186
Who?

449
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:08,313
Celine? I mean, Miss Varens?

450
00:51:08,313 --> 00:51:09,820
Good God, no.

451
00:51:10,457 --> 00:51:13,463
No, I threw her out of the hotel room and I shot him...

452
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:17,896
...in the shoulder or some insignificant place.

453
00:51:17,897 --> 00:51:20,785
No, when I saw what a wretched fool she had meddled with, 

454
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:22,716
I knew that she could never love me. 

455
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,296
That's obvious, surely.

456
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,575
And Adeld?

457
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:38,251
She left her in the hotel when she ran off.

458
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:42,299
Celine claimed that I was the father, but ...

459
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:46,242
 a fairly elementary study of biology would prove that impossible.

460
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:49,683
Tell me, Jane.

461
00:51:51,549 --> 00:51:55,173
Is there anything about me that remotely resembles Adele?

462
00:51:55,174 --> 00:51:56,925
Look at me carefully.

463
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:05,617
No, sir.

464
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:09,130
She left her in the hotel.l...

465
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:13,588
A parcel, a label on with my name.

466
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:16,616
What was I to do? Leave her there to starve?

467
00:52:17,415 --> 00:52:19,543
I provided for her in France.

468
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:23,181
Then, a few months ago, it was necessary to bring her here.

469
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:27,223
She was not my responsibility, 

470
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:30,279
but I took her on just the same.

471
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,559
So, ...

472
00:52:34,299 --> 00:52:38,738
as her guardian and your master, what do you think of my behaviour, Miss Eyre? 

473
00:52:40,716 --> 00:52:42,479
Did I do the right thing??

474
00:52:43,132 --> 00:52:46,746
It was the right thing to do, wasn't it£¬Jane?

475
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,001
Yes, sir.

476
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:27,947
Go away, Pilot.

477
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,207
Pilot, go back to your master.

478
00:55:01,608 --> 00:55:02,729
Who is there?

479
00:56:02,454 --> 00:56:03,357
Hello?

480
00:56:05,482 --> 00:56:06,243
Hello?

481
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,800
