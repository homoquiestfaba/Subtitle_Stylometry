173
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,021
when you guys are unemployed and not working,

174
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,023
the best dick ever.

00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,524
Oh, my God.

176
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,128
You borderline abusive East Coast men, I missed you.

I missed you so much.

00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,834
Okay? The next day, if I'm like, should I call the cops or call him for another date?

00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,237
That was a good night. That was a good night. I missed you guys.

That's the way you're supposed to do it.

All these feelings in Los Angeles...

184
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,381
I went to see a guy in LA that I used to date,

185
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,816
and when I got to his house,

186
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,785
he made me watch a podcast,

187
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,588
be on his podcast, watch a movie he was in,

188
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,523
he wrote me a song. When is your dick coming out?

189
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,258
I'm not an agent, sir.

00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,759
I can't help you with your career.

I came over here to fuck. What is going on?

00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,165
All his goddamn feelings. I'm trying to fuck.

193
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,667
I'm sorry. My mom's gonna see this.

194
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,336
She's gonna be so sad.

195
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,005
[LAUGHS] She's gonna be like, "You were raised in the church."

196
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,608
Up until 18, Mom, then I left that bitch immediately.

198
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,313
[LAUGHS] Now here's the thing. Being in LA for so long,

199
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,416
I did meet one woman who used to live in New York,

200
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,852
and she left because she told me

201
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,088
that one man started masturbating

202
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,824
on the subway in front of her in New York.

203
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,261
So she packed her stuff immediately and moved back to LA.

204
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,497
I said, "Bitch, one?"

"Do you know how many dicks I have seen before I knew they were for fun?"

208
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,509
I've seen local dicks,

209
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,780
express dicks, Amtrak dicks, Metro North dicks,

210

00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,420
I'm desensitized to this stuff now.

213
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,689
In LA, there was a little Latino dude

214
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,792
in the deodorant aisle, jerking off, going to town

215
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,028
instead of yelling out "security" and "police",

216
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,497
I just looked at him, turned around and walked out,

217
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,132
told the lady walking in behind me,

218
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,668
"Hey, there's a dude jerking off in aisle seven.

219
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,536
"Let him finish," and I walked out.

You committing a felony, you might as well finish.

You're going to jail. You know what I'm saying?

223
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,782
But New York, you guys stayed with me

224
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,151
when it really mattered. Like in LA,

225
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,121
everyone is really, uh, caring about everything.

226
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,192
A lot of causes and charities and walks and shit.

227
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,661
Petitions, always wanting you to sign shit.

228
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,930
I was leaving a grocery store,

229
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,366
a handful of bags, struggling to keep them in my hands, right?

230
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,269
This lady, out of nowhere, is like, "Will you please sign

"our petition for gay rights?"

232
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,573
I said, "Gays? You have enough."

233
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,675
And I walked off. Isn't that fucked up?

234
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,012
No, no, no. If you're gay, you're doing a pretty good job at getting your rights heard.

00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,815
I don't have time to fight for gay rights.

I'm a Black woman. I'm busy.

I have my own things to worry about. Okay?

681
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,509
I was like, "Bitch, he ain't coming.

682
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,145
"No wonder you're so angry. You need to get some dick."

683
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,147
But she's like, "You know what? I met a guy. He might be the one."

684
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,416
I said, "Okay, let me ask about this guy.

685
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,285
"Tell me about him." She said, "Well, his name is Darryl.

686
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,756
"He used to play for the NBA, wears a size 16 shoe."

687
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,325
I said, "Bitch, do you have a suicide wish?"

688
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,194
You don't know how to drive. That's like passing a driver's test

689
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,330
and going to buy a Hummer. Go buy a Prius

690
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,199
and learn how to drive before you die.

691
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,968
And she was like, "You know what, Jackie?

692
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,703
"I'm going to go slow. I'm going to get to know Darryl."

693
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,005
I said, "Exactly. Get to know Darryl. While you get to know him,

694
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,508
"give him my card. Okay?" [LAUGHS]

695
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,209
[APPLAUSE]

696
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,645
I've been driving truck for 20 years is all I'm saying.

697
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,013
I know what I'm doing.

698
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,983
Here's the thing about my job, though.

699
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,086
I'm always fighting three different girls.

700
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,687
I'm Jackie. As you guys know me.

701
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,824
My mother still calls me Jacqueline, but I'm also Jaquisha,

702
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:58,129
the Black girl from the Bronx that comes out at the wrong time at every corporate job.

703
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,098
Secret Santa. What's the normal amount?

704
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,801
Ten bucks, maybe. Every now and then, 20.

705
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,837
I had a job where they raised it to $50.

706
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,039
Fifty! Jaquisha jumped the fuck out.

707
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,911
I said, "$50? She's still got to buy steak, bro, fuck Denise, fuck this company.

708
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,113
"My bad. Was that Jaquisha?

709
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,015
"How'd she get here? I'm sorry. She's been to jail.

710
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,450
"My bad. I don't know how she got in here."

711
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,520
Oh, my God.

712
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,156
I'm not wearing any kind of Spanx. It's just--

713
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,725
It's just a thong, a bra and the truth.

714
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,027
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

715
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,962
No, what are you clapping for? [CHUCKLES]

716
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,865
I try to put on Spanx when the whole COVID ended.

717
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,433
Then you go back out on the streets,

718
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,703
almost fell out the window. Oh, my God, they're very tight.

719
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,039
You get out of practice.

720
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,108
'Cause I'm an actor, you know, most comedians are.

721
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,977
What they don't tell you is that, I'm--

722
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:49,280
What I'm really called is a fat actor. That's really the category I'm in.

723
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,749
When I get emails from my agents, they always say,

724
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,853
"Jackie, we're looking for somebody older,

725
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:58,523
"average-looking and experienced".

726
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,592
I email them back every time,

727
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,993
"Who's this for?

728
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,096
"I'm not older, I'm experienced.

729
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,999
"Average looking? Clearly, I'm adorable.

730
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,269
"Overweight? This is called voluptuous mochaccino."

731
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,304
They email back every time, "Are you going?"

732
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,740
Well, yeah, I'mma be there. I'll be the first girl there.

733
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,008
[LAUGHING]

734
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,977
You know, I have a mirror. I'm not crazy.

735
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,013
That's when you're like, you're being kind of rude in emails, is all I'm saying.

736
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,681
[LAUGHS]

737
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,952
Oh, my God, I gained so much weight during the pandemic.

738
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,288
It was funny, though. Women are the biggest liars.

739
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,258
They're like, "Oh, my God, I've gained so much pandy weight."

740
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:37,262
Bitch, you were a chunky monkey pre-pandemic. [LAUGHS]

741
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,231
As was I. I just got chunkier now.

742
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,799
I hate people, during a pandemic,

743
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,002
those people who are like, "You know what? During all this,

744
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,273
"I pick up CrossFit and I'm learning Mandarin.

745
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,108
"And now I'm knitting my car cover."

746
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,611
Bitch, I tried to give myself my own tattoos, okay?

747
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,047
I tried to pierce shit that shouldn't be pierced.

748
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:59,017
Fuck you and your activities during COVID.

749
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,354
No one should be fatter when this is done than white women.

750
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:07,358
You women started baking like slaves when this shit started.

751
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,428
Okay? Between the zucchini bread, and the banana bread

752
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,764
and the fucking sourdough the size of my head,

753
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:17,068
and I'm looking at your recipes on TikTok, Stacy, and she ain't gaining a goddamn pound.

754
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,304
Fuck you, Stacy.

755
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,073
I grew a third titty during this pandemic.

756
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,076
And it's made of sourdough, okay?

757
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,279
It's not fair.

758
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,516
All of my shirts now fit like jackets.

759
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,785
You know what that means? I love denim shirts, and I had this--

760
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,688
I put on the same tight ass, small one from last year,

761
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,258
I had a line of buttons on this side, a line of buttons on this side,

762
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,094
looking at me like, bitch, you know, we can't close.

763
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:46,130
You need Aero-- You need uh... Tsk, what do you need?

764
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,665
Aerobics? Is that the word?

765
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,535
Cardio! You need cardio. [LAUGHS]

766
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,938
I don't even know the word for exercise.

767
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,709
That's how much I don't do it. What's the word for moving around quickly?

768
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,544
[JACKIE LAUGHS]

769
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,079
[APPLAUDING]

770
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,650
Oh, my fat ass! I don't even know the terminology for working out.

771
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,121
I have a lot of personal trainer friends who stalk me online.

772
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,091
They're like, "Jackie, I will work you out for free.

773
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,292
"What do you want to look like?"

774
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,227
I'm like, "I want to look chubby."

775
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,031
Poof! Oh, my God. You're so good. You should charge.

776
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,101
'Cause I'm still in that middle--

777
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,303
I'm in between the big girl and the normal sizes.

778
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,538
But when I walk around the big girl stores,

779
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,476
the big girl mannequins look at me like, "Psst.

780
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,979
"Bitch, one more Snickers, you're in here with us. One more Snickers..."

781
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,548
[LAUGHS] "...you're in here with us."

782
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,817
Now, I've got to join all these programs.

783
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,819
I've done them all before, but I'm going to keep doing it

784
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,388
until I get-- You know what I want.

785
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,624
Weight Watchers, great company. But it's a lot of rules.

786
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,028
The one rule I can't take is the weekly weigh-in.

787
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:54,132
It's always in the front lobby, but in front of the glass storefront

788
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,034
and the car pulls up and you get on the scale,

789
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,604
and then, they get mad at me if I want to get butt naked at the weigh-in.

790
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,106
When you're at home, are you wearing a full fucking outfit? No.

791
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,776
If you don't want to see a big, naked brown girl in the front window,

792
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,279
put the scales in the back. Otherwise, areolas, coming out, okay?

793
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,082
I got to be down 0.2 by tomorrow. Let's go!

794
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,319
Jenny Craig is good, but it's expensive.

795
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,321
You gotta go there every week to get your bag of food,

796
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,158
and it's like, always $100, $200.

797
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,126
Then, they're like, "Now you got your food from us.

798
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:26,097
"Now go to the grocery store, and buy some fruit and some salad."

799
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,833
Bitch, I give you $100. Go in the employee fridge

800
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,437
and steal somebody's salad and bring it out here and give it to me.

801
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,073
Remember how they had body types?

802
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,142
You know, they said you were apple or pear and...

803
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,779
I'm-- I consider myself a Tempur-Pedic mattress.

804
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,414
Tempur-Pedic mattress.

805
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,951
I'm safe. You won't fall off when you're on me.

806
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:50,822
Can you balance a glass of wine on my belly? Yes, 'cause I have tried.

807
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,123
[LAUGHS]

808
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,692
Nice and safe.

809
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:58,896
I had gall bladder surgery, too, because I was just enjoying life too much.

810
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,732
And the doctor's like, "You don't have to have surgery.

811
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,301
"You can change your lifestyle.

812
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,870
"No more red meat. No more fried food.

813
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,573
"No more alcohol, no more sugar."

814
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:12,777
I said, "Do you have a scalpel on you right now? Go get it, right now!

815
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,480
"Fucking demon inside of my body. Remove it, remove it.

816
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,715
"How did it get in here?" You know what I'm saying?

817
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,585
All those things, I like. Are you crazy?

818
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,254
But here's the thing about me and all this weight stuff.

819
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,023
I have an unrealistic amount of confidence

820
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,461
when it comes to approaching a really, really, really hot guy.

821
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,097
Okay? I'm like, "We're all going to die. Fuck it. He might like this.

822
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,166
"You have no idea." Example...

823
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,435
I had a project that did not come out.

824
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:40,638
It was me and Will Smith. Not alone. Other comics, too,

825
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,674
but Will Smith is the primary focus right here, right?

826
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,544
I'm like, Jackie, you are a professional person.

827
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,380
When you meet him, don't act the fool.

828
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,282
You're at work.

829
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,684
He's just a man.

830
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,054
At work, he walked in the room to meet me.

831
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,356
Both my nipples fell off.

832
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,158
Oh, my-- [CHUCKLES] I'm like, "Oh, my God!

833
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:04,495
"Will, I didn't know they could fall off. My bad. I'm so sorry."

834
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,498
I was star struck, and he's a nice guy.

835
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,468
I mean, a normal, respectful, not a superstar.

836
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,538
A really nice guy. And I got pictures with him, of course.

837
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,008
A thousand pictures with him. I took one, put it on IG.

838
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:21,579
Women came for me, okay? They were like, "Jackie, he is happily married."

839
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,616
And first of all, I have heard for years he has an open marriage.

840
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,886
This is not new. I know he had some drama, but years ago,

841
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,557
and when I met him, and I got over the starstruckness,

842
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,393
I approached him with, "I hear you have open marriage energy."

843
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,763
Okay? [LAUGHS] I shouldn't have, but I did.

844
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,765
[LAUGHS]

845
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,901
Women were like, "Jackie, he is with Jada. They are happily married.

846
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:47,171
"And what if you had to go through Jada to get to Will?"

847
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,107
I said, "Bitch, I will fuck his whole family. Are you crazy?

848
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,277
"They're all gorgeous. Jada could get it, her mama could get it.

849
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,347
"His older son could get it, both those kids--" And they're not kids.

850
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,050
I Googled it. They are grown up. I'm not a pedophile.

851
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,118
I'll fuck his whole family.

852
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,688
[LAUGHS] I did the research.

853
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,792
Like, all of the Wayans comedians, I know them all.

854
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,194
Well, most of them, and they're in my age group.

855
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,196
But they don't have wives. Why not?

856
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,966
I'll marry a Wayans. I'll fuck a Wayans.

857
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,801
I recently met Chris Rock.

858
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,736
He's been out there on, you know, Late Night, saying,

859
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,339
"I'm ready to date. I'm ready for a girlfriend."

860
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,341
I met him. I'm like, "Hey."

861
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,314
And he's like, "No, we can't. We can't."

862
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:36,287
If 56-year-old Chris Rock dated a fat, Black, 50-year-old comic,

863
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,155
he'd be a fucking legend, okay?

864
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,057
There'd be a statue made of him. [CHUCKLES]

865
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,127
-He'd get a Mark Twain Prize now. -[APPLAUDING]

866
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,030
But I know what these guys look for. That's all I'm saying.

867
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,265
I understand that.

868
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,599
I know where the confidence comes from.

869
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,900
So when you join Weight Watchers,

870
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,736
you get an app on your phone like Facebook.

871
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,738
I'm not gonna lie, though. It's a depressing place.

872
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,140
Ladies are on there, with their pictures.

873
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,908
Self-deprecation, but in a sad way.

874
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,911
They're like, "I hate my body. I want to die. I don't love myself."

875
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,582
I'm like, "Hey, you are beautiful and worthy in the body you have, right.

876
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,317
"You don't lose weight and then get confidence.

877
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,154
"You are hot and worthy and bangable in the body you have right now."

878
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,689
That's the way it works.

879
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,157
[APPLAUDING]

880
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,692
That's why...

881
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,396
That is why I tell men all the time,

882
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,965
"If you want to hit this, come hit this now.

883
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,967
"Okay? Because when I hit my goal weight,

884
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,003
"ya'll not gonna be good enough for me anymore. So, come get it now.

885
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,939
"While my standards are a little bit lower." You know what I'm saying?

886
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,511
Because back in the day, if you'd got me in my 20s and 30s and said,

887
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:37,515
"Jackie, would you give so-and-so a blowjob

888
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,918
"for a job, for work, for a role in a movie?"

889
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,854
20 to 30s, I'd have been like, "Of course not.

890
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,990
"I'm a woman of character. I would never."

891
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,528
Now, at 50, I'd be like...

892
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,630
"Whose dick is it?"

893
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,432
[LAUGHS]

894
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,900
I'm just saying, I want background.

895
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,968
Just give me some background. That's all I'm saying.

896
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,505
[LAUGHS]

897
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,742
Oh, God. I, um... I want to--

898
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,111
I want to rant, like gossip for a second.

899
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,046
The whole J-Lo and Ben Affleck.

900
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,448
Oh, have you been watching this?

901
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,550
[SCREAMS] Who loves it on the low?

902
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,385
Who lowkey-- Like, I'm loving all--

903
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,187
Thank you!

904
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,857
You saw the video today on IG? They're kissing in Miami. Oh, my God.

905
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,792
I watched it 300 times.

906
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:25,329
Okay, first of all, I'm a huge J-Lo fan. I fucking love her.

907
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,734
Bronx, Bronx. I just adore her, and I like the fact that she left A-Rod.

908
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,837
I like-- Fuck A-Rod. I mean, you're a nice guy, I'm sure.

909
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,107
But he's gone. I'm glad he's gone. A-Rod is just corny to me.

910
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,745
He was very close to being the first Latino My Pillow guy, I swear to God.

911
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,047
Was he not?

912
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:47,385
He's very close to selling frying pans at QVC.

913
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,787
He's not the one, J-Lo, is all I'm saying.

914
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,258
And that video, the video of her and Ben kissing,

915
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,726
people lost their mind, right?

916
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,862
They're like, "How?" And her son was in the video.

917
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,730
He popped in and popped out. And they were like,

918
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,733
"How can you make out with a new boyfriend, new-ish,

919
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,635
"in front of your boyfriend?"

920
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,071
You can make out with your boyfriend in front of your kids

921
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,839
if he's fucking Batman.

922
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,308
He's Batman.

923
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,944
Yes, you can make out with your boyfriend if he's Batman.

924
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:18,182
And you guys-- I see your faces like, "Jackie, Batman is not real."

925
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,918
Neither are J-Lo's relationship,

926
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,321
and we're having a good time. We're having fun.

927
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,392
Just enjoy it. Sidenote, sorry. I just love J-Lo. I wanna talk about it.

928
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,094
'Cause I don't really date. I really--

929
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,797
I don't like the whole awkwardness and the fakeness.

930
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,866
I'd rather just play around until I fall in love.

931
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,369
I'm a happy single girl. I'm an oxymoron.

932
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,871
I'm actually happy and single, not married.

933
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,174
We'll get to that later. But I'm happy and I'm not married.

934
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,609
A lot of girls are like, they're not happy they're not with someone.

935
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,746
I'm like-- My girlfriends are like, "You like going around?

936
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,815
"Just banging dudes you don't know?"

937
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,551
Yeah.

938
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,819
I thought it was called being single.

939
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,954
Why are you judging? I don't understand.

940
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,559
I've online date. Who here's done online dating?

941
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,328
Online dating is awesome. I used to do it.

942
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,231
I met a guy online, we saw, like, three movies in a week.

943
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,733
I said, "When are you and I gonna stop watching movies

944
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,802
"and start making some? I'm kind of bored."

945
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,572
He was like, "You're a nice lady, I want to be a gentleman."

946
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,541
I said, "Who the hell told you to do that?"

947
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,009
He said, "You're the kind of girl I could marry."

948
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,746
I said, "I met you on hotchocolatelust.com.

949
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,982
"You are not my soul mate. FYI."

950
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,320
But here's how I got through the pandemic.

951
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,656
I accidentally got in a really serious relationship...

952
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,025
when it started.

953
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,395
Um, because COVID cut down, for a single girl, it cut down hoeing.

954
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,631
Cut down hoeing, cut down booty calls,

955
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,800
cut down, you know, handling your stuff discreetly.

956
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,468
So, they're like, you can't date. Don't talk--

957
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,104
I'm like, "I'm not gonna be alone for a year. Somebody love me!"

958
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,874
So, I found someone who I've known for a long time.

959
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:56,280
But I told him so many lies to make him think that I am the quarantine wife he'd want.

960
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,316
I said, "Look, I am a domestic goddess.

961
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,720
"I cook every meal from scratch.

962
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,689
"And I grow my own vegetables."

963
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:10,694
All the lies. None of that true.

964
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:14,765
Because somehow I found a unicorn Black man who actually does cook and garden.

965
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,301
So, we're having dinner. He made me a veggie salad,

966
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,702
and then he pulled out a cucumber.

967
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,504
Not his dick, a real cucumber.

968
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,040
I'm like, "What's this?" He's like, "You and I should garden together."

969
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,010
I'm like, "Why?" He goes, "I'm prepared."

970
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,379
He made these stacks of greens that had the roots.

971
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,749
Gave me one stack. He said, "Yo, bring this home and plant it.

972
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,584
"I'll plant mine at the same time.

973
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,120
"And we can watch them grow together as a couple."

974
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,956
I'm like, "Aww, my God, I lied to you.

975
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,192
"I'd rather catch COVID. Look at these nails. Are you crazy?

976
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,694
"I do not garden.

977
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,831
"I barely have the strength to shower every Friday.

978
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:51,902
"We're in a pandemic. I'm not gonna plant asparagus.

979
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,371
"You want me and you to be Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg?

980
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,741
"Guess what? You're Martha. I'm Snoop. I don't do any of that shit.

981
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:00,210
"I lied to you. My God, my bad.

982
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,080
"Ain't none that true."

983
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,149
I barely know him. That's why it worked.

984
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,418
I met him in our 20s, but I was away,

985
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,321
I was married, all this kind of crap. That's how it works.

986
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:14,191
Because when you snoop, and try to figure out a guy's background,

987
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,359
what do you find, ladies?

988
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,961
A family in Virginia. Exactly.

989
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,229
So, I do not research anything. [CHUCKLES]

990
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,532
If God wants to remove him, remove him.

991
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:25,269
Because here's the problems we're kind of having now. Um...

992
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,805
He's uh-- He's jealous. He's a very jealous guy.

993
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,373
I thought-- I thought that would be hot.

994
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,941
It's not. Here's the thing.

995
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,677
During the quarantine, what did he and I do for a year?

996
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,546
Sex, drinking, smoking.

997
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,781
It was amazing/horrible. Of course, COVID.

998
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,984
And I said, "Look, when I go back to work,

999
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:43,220
"you should know it's usually me around nothing but dudes.

1000
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,557
"And these dudes are my friends and they're 40, 45 years old and up."

1001
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:51,362
Boyfriend's also 50. I said, "When I go back to work, this is my environment."

1002
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,831
He's like, "Jackie. I'm afraid I'm not enough for you,

1003
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:57,601
"and when you go back to work, you would cheat on me with one of these guys.

1004
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,870
I said, "You think if I get side dick,

1005
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,406
"he's going to also be a 50-year-old man?"

1006
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:08,145
I said, "If I get side dick, he's gonna be half your age, you fool."

1007
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,482
Having two boyfriends that are both 50?

1008
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,753
That's like having two part-time jobs and they're both at Subway. What the fuck?

1009
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:20,357
You ain't got no goals, bitch? You don't want to dream bigger than that?

1010
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:25,095
I'mma have two boyfriends with a fucking bad back, sleep apnea and prostate problem.

1011
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:29,166
I want a younger, faster, bigger, stronger, harder man, okay?

1012
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,701
I'm not an idiot.

1013
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,303
She said, "Right." [LAUGHS]

1014
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,305
The hell, yeah. You understand.

1015
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,709
He just bought DJ equipment.

1016
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,645
Yeah, at 50-years-old.

1017
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,048
I got to walk around the ghost of DJs past,

1018
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,685
to go lay down 'cause he has all the equipment in the bedroom.

1019
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:51,422
I gotta walk around Grandmaster Flash's gravesite to go get laid.

1020
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,126
But the reason why I'm so into him,

1021
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,296
if I can be honest with you guys, let's keep it real.

1022
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,397
He's hot.

1023
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,801
That's almost-- That's almost it.

1024
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,036
You know why? My whole life, I would always date

1025
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,772
the really great guy with the great job and...

1026
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,474
He loved God, took care of his kids

1027
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,277
and I would cheat on every good guy. They are boring.

1028
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,747
This guy is the bad guy and I'm having a great time.

1029
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,016
We're having a great time because

1030
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,919
his dick is the size of a universal remote.

1031
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,889
Not the one you get it for free from cable.

1032
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,624
The one you gotta go to Best Buy,

1033
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,626
and get a bigger one with the buttons. Ya'll know how they work?

1034
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,495
That one. That's the one. Won't he do it?

1035
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,298
God is good, all the time. All the time, God is good.

1036
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,500
[LAUGHS]

1037
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,136
I barely know him and I'm having fun. He has a daughter.

1038
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,873
She's either 4 or 14. I have no fucking idea. I have no idea.

1039
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,441
I'm not gonna ask her.

1040
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,277
[LAUGHS] I'm not.

1041
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,913
He's like, "Jackie, you'd be a great role model for my daughter."

1042
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,449
I'm like," I have been drinking since ten o'clock yesterday.

1043
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,919
"I can't be nobody's mentor in a fucking pandemic."

1044
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:02,760
All the time together that I realized that it was too much time.

1045
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,864
I was on his couch, like, the 19th day in a row.

1046
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,866
The first-- When the pandemic first started,

1047
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,768
he'd look at me and say things like,

1048
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:15,172
"Do you have any idea how beautiful you are, how beautiful your smile is?"

1049
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,308
Now, he's like, "Are those all your real teeth?"

1050
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:20,978
So...

1051
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:24,348
I went back home after that, that was too much time.

1052
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:29,553
Now here are my new philosophies and rules at being 50 or almost.

1053
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,321
Um...

1054
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:34,358
The term cougar, I don't like. I don't like the term cougar.

1055
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,060
I think it's offensive. When a man calls me that,

1056
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,630
I'm hearing you telling me you can't please me.

1057
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,133
Because when you date men who are 40 and up, they have adult children.

1058
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,435
I had one guy, kept calling me a cougar.

1059
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:48,972
He had a son who was 25 and hot. He was 45.

1060
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,074
Hey, you call me a cougar one more time,

1061
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,943
I'm gonna fuck your son.

1062
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,512
-[APPLAUDING] -Okay?

1063
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:59,316
I can be your girlfriend or your daughter-in-law. You decide. It's up to you.

1064
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,319
Just don't call me names, is all I'm saying. Don't call me names.

1065
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:08,091
I realized that I don't like adult toy shops in LA, compared to here.

1066
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,726
They are very different, okay?

1067
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,728
In New York, a sex shop is a secret.

1068
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,197
You don't tell anybody you're going.

1069
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,065
You go at midnight, it's in the village.

1070
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,100
It's underground. You gotta wear a ski mask.

1071
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,303
You gotta have a password. You got to give a hand stamp,

1072
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,905
urine sample. It's fucking private.

1073
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,875
In LA, these sex shops are glass storefronts.

1074
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,045
Like a shoe store. Merchandise in the window.

1075
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,614
I went in one time, they had a DJ.

1076
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,983
They had a basket. Are we in Target?

1077
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,518
What the hell is going on in here?

1078
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,720
When you walk in, customer service attacks you.

1079
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,821
Like, "Can I help you?"

1080
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:40,057
"Oh, my God. You can see me?"

1081
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,928
'Cause I already had a vibrator in my hand the size of a toaster

1082
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,330
that was diesel powered.

1083
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,732
You know, I don't want you in my business, ma'am.

1084
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:52,135
And you get to the cashier, they want your emails so they can send you sales.

1085
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:56,206
I don't want no email for this nasty ass merchandise.

1086
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,910
How about this? Email dianaross@gmail.com. Email her.

1087
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,378
Do not email me.

1088
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,716
I have a lot of Caucasian girlfriends.

1089
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,918
The difference between my white girlfriends and my Black girlfriends

1090
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:11,188
are huge because my Black girlfriends, I feel like they're repressed.

1091
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:15,425
They don't talk about sex, we're kind of shy about it. We keep kind of private.

1092
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,095
White girls, the ultimate oversharers.

1093
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,530
Oh, my God. My white girlfriend,

1094
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:25,702
I was like, "Look, my boyfriend wants to watch porn together as a couple."

1095
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,804
And she was like, "Porn?"

1096
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,107
"That's how I bought this house. Want to see some of mine?"

1097
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,009
"No, no, no, no, no."

1098
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,978
No, I just want advice. What the fuck?

1099
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:41,051
[CHUCKLES] You know what's different now with men and dating?

1100
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:44,321
It's hard to-- It's hard to get choked during sex.

1101
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:49,793
Is that too much? Was that-- I didn't have any segue or transition.

1102
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:53,230
'Cause you know why. Most men are afraid of, you know, jail.

1103
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,633
[LAUGHS]

1104
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,869
Back in the day, they can rough you up and everything will be okay.

1105
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:02,673
But now, like, I asked my boyfriend for a little bit of choking during sex recently.

1106
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,576
And he's behind me. I'm like, okay. Position. He's behind me. Perfect.

1107
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,312
His hand came around,

1108
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:12,182
but then he ended up in, like, a nice little, gentle cuddle like this.

1109
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,117
I'm like, "You don't know, the difference between--

1110
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,654
"There's a difference between cuddle and choke. You're not doing it right."

1111
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,591
I was, uh...

1112
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,461
I'm not ashamed to admit that with the dating problems and wondering about men,

1113
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,097
if somebody were to ask me, "Jackie, you know, are you gay?"

1114
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,765
My answer is usually,

1115
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:31,468
"Not yet. Not yet." [LAUGHS]

1116
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,337
"Not yet. I'm still working on it.

1117
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,173
"I'm still trying to find something in this area."

1118
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,208
I tried to be gay for a semester in college.

1119
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,910
Anybody else try a woman when you were in college?

1120
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,045
-[SCATTERED CHEERING] -Way in the back.

1121
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:46,016
I had to leave because, first of all, women's bodies, very hard to figure out.

1122
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,852
There are a lot of hills, valleys, dark holes,

1123
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:52,522
put my hand in the wrong hole, lost my class ring, a good watch.

1124
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:53,657
You gotta be careful.

1125
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,526
[LAUGHS]

1126
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,029
Women, we talk a lot. We're very emotional.

1127
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,665
I'd try another time and she wouldn't shut up.

1128
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:06,570
The whole time, she was like, "Oh, my God, What are you thinking?

1129
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,373
"How do you feel? What do you think?"

1130
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,641
I think I'm going to go back to dick. Oh, my God.

1131
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,411
This is what it's like, gentlemen? Jesus Christ.

1132
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,948
[LAUGHS]

1133
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:22,085
I got a text today from a guy that I had a one-nighter with.

1134
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,655
And uh, isn't it funny how you text men back faster,

1135
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,357
if you know they had a big dick?

1136
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:32,195
Let's keep it real. This is the church side. Let's talk to this side.

1137
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,998
This side is like, "Lord, have mercy. Jesus."

1138
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,601
And this side is, like, "Dicks! Yes!"

1139
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,636
[LAUGHS]

1140
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:41,905
You know, I'm not going to cheat on my boyfriend. I love him.

1141
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:45,509
But, you know, whenever you get a text from a dick that size,

1142
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,944
you have to hit him back quickly 'cause, you know,

1143
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,480
you have to be kind. You don't know.

1144
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,650
in the future, you got to keep your bases covered.

1145
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,219
I'm not going to be alone again. I can't do it anymore.

1146
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,522
In LA, I did not get laid all.

1147
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:03,126
I had the most underutilized pussy in the state of California.

1148
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,395
I'm ashamed. They would not have sex.

1149
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,398
These men out there are so consumed with the business.

1150
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,768
But here in New York, I love the way, guy, that kind of gangster.

1151
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,638
Like, weed being legal here is great for my boyfriend.

1152
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,506
Because when he was going to get weed,

1153
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,008
I'm like, "Go get us some weed."

1154
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,210
He'd put on a black track-suit, a ski mask.

1155
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,179
What the fuck? I don't want meth. I want marijuana.

1156
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,814
Where are you going?

1157
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,316
Weed free, Kurtis Blow. You don't gotta do this no more.

1158
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,885
What's wrong with you?

1159
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:33,957
When a guy asks me, "How many men have you made love to before me?"

1160
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:37,360
I'll tell them the number, but I'm going to use creative accounting.

1161
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,297
Okay? This is how I do it.

1162
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:43,500
If you and I have only had sex in a car,

1163
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,635
you don't count. It's dangerous.

1164
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,737
We all could die, okay?

1165
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,275
If you and I have only done it in your mom's house,

1166
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,279
you're a loser and need privacy because I'm a screamer.

1167
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,081
You understand, okay?

1168
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:02,486
If you and I have only had sex in my house,

1169
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:03,620
you homeless.

1170
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:08,592
I'm not going to bone somebody homeless knowingly.

1171
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,261
[CHUCKLES] Okay? Most importantly,

1172
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,930
if you've never given me an orgasm,

1173
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,432
you don't count.

1174
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,033
-'Cause my motto is... -[APPLAUDING]

1175
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,502
Yeah, go ahead and clap that.

1176
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,170
[APPLAUDING]

1177
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,638
It's getting so deep.

1178
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,442
Because my motto is, If I don't come, you don't count.

1179
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,177
That's on the back of my car. That's my Biden sticker.

1180
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,645
"If I don't come, you don't count."

1181
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,648
That's nasty. I wouldn't do that. That's gross.

1182
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:36,119
The walk of shame, never subscribed to that. I don't understand.

1183
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,822
What's the-- I call it a walk of pride.

1184
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,825
When I get laid, I will have my purse like a baton

1185
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,326
walking out of the house like,

1186
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:47,297
"Yay! Guess who got some? mister mailman. What's up?"

1187
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:50,767
I don't know why we're ashamed to get laid.

1188
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:55,405
What's funny is that, I recently asked my boyfriend to watch porn.

1189
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,507
And you know what's funny, I'm like, "You pick the category."

1190
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:00,510
I'm like, "You have lead. Pick whatever you're into."

1191
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,379
That could have been anything.

1192
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,548
He picked Black BBW.

1193
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:08,685
I said, "You want to watch us fuck?

1194
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:11,788
"Turn the mirror around. Why are we going online?" [LAUGHS]

1195
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,524
Every movie he picked out, it looked like me, it looked like me.

1196
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,594
I'm like, "Do you have a fat girl fetish? You're into this?"

1197
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,398
Oh, God, it's just a...

1198
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,934
[CHUCKLES]

1199
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,204
I'm a feminist. Clearly, I'm trying to do what men do, what he does at this age.

1200
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:28,672
I'm like, "I can do whatever men do."

1201
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,841
'Cause he's been a weed smoker since he was like, four.

1202
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,643
And I'm like, "I can smoke what you smoke."

1203
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:37,347
So he made me smoke when he smoked to show me that I can't.

1204
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,716
He rolled it, I had a puff at his dinner table.

1205
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,485
I got up to go to the bathroom, I stopped in the hallway

1206
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,821
to lay down and take a nap. Do you understand

1207
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:47,757
how high you gotta be to need rest immediately?

1208
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,194
But one of the real reasons why I left LA,

1209
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,529
if I were to be real with you guys,

1210
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,564
I was getting high too often.

1211
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,200
The weed was everywhere. I was enjoying the release,

1212
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,069
and not being all in my head all the time.

1213
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:03,540
First time, so that's probably why I moved because LA, they have pre-rolls.

1214
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,042
Mystery pre-roll. You don't know what the hell is in them.

1215
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:09,713
It could be PCP, acid, crack. You don't know what's in them.

1216
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,616
I had two pre-rolls and me and this guy I was dating at the time

1217
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,186
were in my apartment smoking these mystery pre-rolls.

1218
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,688
A level of high I can't even explain.

1219
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:21,958
All the lights were off. The room is dark, he's on the couch.

1220
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,961
I'm sitting on his lap straddling him, we're about to you know...

1221
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,229
[POPS MOUTH] Right?

1222
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,597
And... [LAUGHS]

1223
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,466
And we're in the middle of it, we're so high.

1224
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,301
But when I tell you I got so high,

1225
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,603
I was straddling him, he was inside of me.

1226
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,940
I got so high in the middle of the whole thing. I was like,

1227
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,542
"Who is this?"

1228
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,118
I'm looking around in the dark for clues.

1229
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,453
I'm like, "Where are his sneakers?

1230
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,423
"Is he wearing a hat? Where are his keys?

1231
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,426
You know how high you got to be to be like,

1232
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:58,028
"Whose dick is this?"

1233
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,231
And then you're like,

1234
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,300
"Did I consent? God damn! I don't even have time for court.

1235
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,170
"I hope this is okay." And then the lights come on, we're done. I'm like,

1236
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,272
"Whoo! Thank God. There's you.

1237
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,107
"It could've gone really badly for you.

1238
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,477
"Thank God I knew who you were. Jesus Christ. That was scary."

1239
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,948
[CHUCKLES] So, with all the lights off with him and I,

1240
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,951
I didn't have to make my normal announcement, like I normally do.

1241
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:25,155
When you're my age, 50, your body changes, all right?

1242
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:26,890
So I have to let men know that,

1243
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,728
you know, I now have a salt and pepper fun box.

1244
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,064
She said in Jamaican, "Uh-uh". I heard that.

1245
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,165
I heard a "Uh-uh".

1246
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,900
[LAUGHS]

1247
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,371
So, now, I have to let new boyfriends know before the unveiling,

1248
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,574
to get them ready, so they know, from the belly button down,

1249
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,942
I'm Morgan Freeman.

1250
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,714
Anybody want to watch a movie? Shawshank? Seven?

1251
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,385
I want to make a request.

1252
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,355
For the gentleman. Some advice. Um...

1253
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:03,326
If you know that a blow job is not your thing,

1254
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,562
that it's not the way you climax.

1255
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,064
Can you please tell a bitch?

1256
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:13,837
Your lady is down there bobbing for apples for fucking hours.

1257
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,673
The sun has gone down, I want to check my email,

1258
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,242
see my family again. I want to eat.

1259
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:22,912
I had a full, flat iron when we started. It's full, curly Afro now.

1260
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,548
You'll see that vein on my forehead about to pop out.

1261
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,817
If you don't come this way, tell me!

1262
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,156
Finally, I'm going to ask guys,

1263
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:36,393
stop asking questions during sex.

1264
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,963
You're very inquisitive at a very weird times.

1265
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,667
And this guy, we're making love, and he was like,

1266
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,570
"Jackie, who fucks you like I do?"

1267
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,073
I was like,

1268
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,942
"Derrick, James, Jeff...

1269
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,077
"You're all the same."

1270
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,246
I'm Jackie Fabulous, guys. Thank you so much.
