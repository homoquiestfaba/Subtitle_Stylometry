1
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,403
<i>Will that be all for you?</i>

2
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:41,144
<i>There you go.
Have a good night.</i>

3
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,486
<i>You want this one?</i>

4
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:06,274
Where are you going?
Come on. Party time, huh?

5
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:08,337
Hey!

6
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,674
Hey, wait up!

7
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,360
Looking for company?

8
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:39,602
It's pretty shitty
out there, huh?

9
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,349
Hoo.

10
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:47,080
<i>I like the rain.
Keeps everybody inside...</i>

11
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,714
and washes everything clean.

12
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,724
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

13
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:56,891
<i>So, anyway,
it's 75 for a straight fuck...</i>

14
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:59,932
50 for a B.J.
And 25 for a pump and run.

15
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:08,907
Show me what you got.

16
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,413
Where you haulin'?

17
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,847
Heading home.

18
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:20,353
- Lucky you.
- The wig too.

19
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:29,760
So we gonna get started
here or what?

20
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,709
<i>Get it wet for me.</i>

21
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:49,137
<i>- Are you kiddin'?
- Do it.</i>

22
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,150
Now!

23
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:55,180
You know what?
Screw this.

24
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:00,317
What the fuck!

25
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,995
You want out?

26
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,532
There's your exit.

27
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:15,138
You're a fucking freak.

28
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,385
Somebody help me!

29
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:48,236
<i>Oh, my God, Kaylal
Oh, my God, look outl</i>

30
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:52,039
Oh, my God!

31
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:58,340
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! Why? Why?

32
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,909
- Are you kidding? Not funny.
- I don't wanna die.

33
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:03,717
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

34
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,623
I'm sorry, baby.
She made me.

35
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:09,457
Mel, I did not make you.
That was totally your idea.

36
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:13,465
That's the quality time you guys want to
spend together? To kill me in my sleep?

37
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:22,100
You should wait and see
what we have in store for Vegas.

38
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,469
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- What?

39
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:33,076
<i>I'm gonna go into a dark corner,
and I'm gonna gamble by myself...</i>

40
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:36,520
while you guys go do the
whole bachelor/bachelorette thing.

41
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,650
<i>Don't be such a baby.
We agreed to do the parties together...</i>

42
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:44,186
so everyone would have
an equal opportunity to torture us.

43
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,333
Hey, chill. Chill!

44
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,335
I don't want you staining
the fine Corinthian leather.

45
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,667
What a waste
of fine Corinthian.

46
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,934
You dare mock the '83 Chevy
Caprice wagon?

47
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:59,775
Yes, I do. Question:
Why did we not fly to Vegas?

48
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:04,283
<i>Because Kay and I haven't seen
each other since Christmas...</i>

49
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:06,546
and I miss my little sister.

50
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,884
I miss you too, Sis.

51
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,370
Congratulations, Kay.

52
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:36,540
<i>You've found a genuine ghost town.</i>

53
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:38,777
Okay, is this place even open?

54
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:48,058
- Fill her up, ma'am?
- Sure.

55
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:55,190
He's kind of cute. No?

56
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:58,032
No. No.

57
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:06,240
You know, ma'am, here
at Inbred Jed's, we require
that you pay in advance.

58
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:08,644
- Really?
- Really.

59
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,546
<i>- Uh-
- Okay.</i>

60
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:12,983
What the-

61
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:14,645
<i>Uh-</i>

62
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,814
- Psych.
Okay.

63
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,882
Hey, whoa. Hey, whoa!

64
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,859
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is going on?</i>

65
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:27,161
Nik, this is my sister, Mel,
and her fiance, Bobby.

66
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:28,996
You are way hotter
in person.

67
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,594
Wait a minute. Is this
the guy you've been talking
to on MySpace?

68
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,196
<i>33,628 friends and counting...</i>

69
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:36,367
and Kayla is number one.

70
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:39,708
- You're my number one.
- Okay. All right. What's happening?
What's going on?

71
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,713
Nik's gonna be my date
in Vegas.

72
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,875
- He took a bus all the way
from Salt Lake City to meet me.
- Okay.

73
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:47,283
C- Could you please
join me in the bathroom?

74
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,418
Okay.

75
00:06:57,263 --> 00:07:01,199
- Are you kidding me?
- Look, I know Brad's gonna be there tomorrow.

76
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:05,260
<i>And I haven't seen him since we broke up.
I just wanted to show up with somebody.</i>

77
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,033
But you barely know this guy.

78
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:09,940
I barely know you since
you moved away to be with Bobby.

79
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,068
Which one's yours again?

80
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:15,981
I jest.

81
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:19,416
I don't understand anything you said.
You have two things right here.

82
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,818
Nik and I have been talking on the phone
every day for the past five months.

83
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:26,120
- Yeah, online.
- Online, on the phone, over webcam.

84
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:30,322
<i>He's not a serial killer. Trust me,
I googled his name and everything.</i>

85
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,762
Do you need the change?

86
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:35,426
- Come on. Come on.
- There you go.

87
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:38,801
Check this out.

88
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:41,864
This road would be a lot faster.
No traffic, no cops.

89
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,136
Free at last.
No hassle from the man.

90
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:51,407
Look, I didn't tell you because I knew
you'd try to talk me out of it.

91
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:55,477
Yeah, exactly. Why do I always have to
be the voice of reason with you?

92
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,580
Come on, Sis.

93
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:01,457
Please? Pretty please?

94
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,496
I just want
to have some fun.

95
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:10,431
<i>Fine, but you have to promise
to feed him, water him...</i>

96
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:13,995
- and clean up after him.
- I will, I promise.

97
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:18,009
Uh, I'm not really a back roads
type of guy, buddy.

98
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:21,171
Uh, they built the highways
for a reason. Stick to 'em.

99
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,239
Yeah, to slow shit down, man.

100
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:27,514
<i>Think about it. The faster we get to Vegas,
the faster we start cashing in...</i>

101
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:31,489
- the faster we start having fun.
- Come on, Bobby.

102
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:37,127
- Come on.
- Let's go.

103
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:39,529
We're going to Vegas!

104
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:47,137
We've been driving over an hour and
we haven't even seen the main highway yet.

105
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:50,802
That's because we're running exactly
parallel to it, sweetheart.

106
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:54,643
<i>It's simple physics. Relax.</i>

107
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:57,239
We're fine as long
as we keep heading west.

108
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:03,583
<i>Oh, would you look at this.
A dirt road.</i>

109
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:06,250
<i>Yeah, this has to mean
civilization is close, right?</i>

110
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:09,591
<i>Or is this the main entrance to Vegas, Nik?
'Cause I don't know. I've never been.</i>

111
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:12,927
Quit busting my balls, man.
It was your map.

112
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:21,674
What the fuck is that smell?

113
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,872
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit!

114
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,435
- Pull the car over.
- What's wrong with it?

115
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,845
- Anywhere, pull over. Pull it over.
- I am.

116
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,850
Okay.

117
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:35,410
Geez, just stop the car. Stop the car.

118
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,622
<i>- Thank you.
- What are we gonna do?</i>

119
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:56,605
What is it?

120
00:09:56,676 --> 00:10:00,442
The engine seized.

121
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:04,244
Did you ever think- Did you ever think
maybe you should put some oil in there?

122
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:07,218
I don't know about that stuff.

123
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:13,253
<i>She had a good run. Isn't this Grammy's car?</i>

124
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:16,124
- Yeah.
- Well, I'll miss her.

125
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:19,255
Aw, that's sad. I feel like
we should bury it or something.

126
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,630
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?

127
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,573
Can you hear me now?
No shit.

128
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,906
Which way do you think?

129
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:36,347
<i>Well, we know nothing's down
there for a hundred miles, so-</i>

130
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,115
<i>I say we keep going down
this way.</i>

131
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:44,179
<i>- Straight to Vegas, right, Nik?
- Right, Nik.</i>

132
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,486
- Right, Bobby.
- Asshole.

133
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,619
Okay, guys.

134
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,448
- We're in hell.
- At least that means
we're not completely lost.

135
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:21,516
You may want to surrender your Goth pride,
Nik, and lose the black jacket.

136
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:26,031
<i>I'm not Goth, jock. Third-wave emo punk,
if you insist on using labels.</i>

137
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:29,626
Well, it's first-wave jackass
to wear black in the desert.

138
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,431
<i>- Tell that to the bedouins.
- I will.</i>

139
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,200
Wait a minute. What's that?

140
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,008
<i>Sweet.</i>

141
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,241
What are we gonna do?
Bust right in, or what?

142
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,980
Looks like our luck's changing.

143
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:51,148
See you're good for something, jock.

144
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:58,993
Holy shit!

145
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,229
This mail's over a month old.

146
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,744
Anyone home?

147
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,780
- Hello!
- Hello!

148
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:19,045
Hello! Anyone home?

149
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,111
Hello.

150
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:32,058
Still got nothing.

151
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,568
Nik?

152
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,540
Nik!

153
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:48,136
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God!</i>

154
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,114
What is it?

155
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:58,480
What?

156
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:02,255
Oh, I'm sorry.
These are a bitch to open sometimes.

157
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:05,923
<i>- You think they'd fix that.
- We just busted down a door and broke a window.</i>

158
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:08,728
What do you want to do next?
Set this place on fire?

159
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:12,295
Where are you going?
This place is empty.

160
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:17,308
<i>Whoever lived here before hasn't lived here
for a long time. Bobby? Bobby?</i>

161
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:19,606
- You scared the shit out of us.
- I'm sorry, baby.

162
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,920
Oh, gross.

163
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:33,620
These expired, like, a year ago.

164
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:37,295
Scooby snack?

165
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,763
Like Scooby Doo?

166
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,536
I thought you said therapy
helped your sister's control issues.

167
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:47,505
I told you that because I thought
you'd never meet her.

168
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:50,838
<i>I don't see what the big deal
is. I think it's kind of sexy.</i>

169
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,777
<i>I'll show you sexy... later.</i>

170
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:58,039
Later, later, later.

171
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,151
- Later, later, later.
- Creepy.

172
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,625
- All the phones are dead.
- Everything's dead here.

173
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,160
<i>You know, this place has got to be one of those
weekend retreat slash meth-lab combo deals...</i>

174
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:22,173
<i>or something,
because this is pathetic.</i>

175
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:25,210
<i>- We should get out ofhere before sunset.
- I think we should go.</i>

176
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:29,642
<i>Check this out.</i>

177
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:37,150
Wow, talk about valley of death.

178
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,592
Nice piece of real estate.

179
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:44,323
You know what they say.
Location, location, location.

180
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,661
Bobby, don't go any closer.

181
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:49,166
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.

182
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:52,636
- Let's get out of here.
- You wanna check out the barn?

183
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,639
Just what do you have in mind,
mister?

184
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,541
Oh, simply a wholesome appreciation
of early Western rustic architecture.

185
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:19,928
This place keeps getting
more and more charming.

186
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,077
Come on!

187
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,145
- You're suck a jerk!
- Asshole.

188
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:54,656
You scared me.

189
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,969
I'm down with the freaky, but-

190
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:10,072
This is just pushing it.

191
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:15,147
What is that?

192
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:36,105
- Wow.
- Our motherfucking salvation!

193
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,838
A 1971 Chevy Chevelle hardtop.

194
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:42,312
- It's an American classic.
- Dibs!

195
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,046
<i>Oh, no wayl</i>

196
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,886
Breaker, breaker, this is Captain Winky
looking for Pink Taco.

197
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,323
<i>- You out there, R.T.
- Nobody uses C. BIs anymore.</i>

198
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,384
Truckers do.

199
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:04,992
God is quite literally handing us this
fine automobile. Who are we to deny him?

200
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:09,303
You are not thinking about taking this car?
What if the owners come back?

201
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,811
We don't really know how long these people
are gonna be gone. They could be on vacation.

202
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:16,245
<i>Or they could have died in
a freak combine/thresher accident. Who knows?</i>

203
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:18,249
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

204
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:21,309
Oh, listen to that purr.

205
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:24,049
And it's full of gas. Hop in.
Let's take this bitch for a ride.

206
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:26,057
Nobody's stealing anybody's car.

207
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,822
At most we're borrowing it.

208
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:33,228
Exactly. We're gonna borrow it for
a little joyride, which is guaranteed fun.

209
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,707
I mean, "joy" is built right
into that sentence.

210
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,261
Well, that's grand theft auto.

211
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:42,040
<i>- And what's the alternative?
- We can't really hang out in that creepy house.</i>

212
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:45,043
She's right, Mel. We can't be out
in the desert at night.

213
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:48,478
<i>How about this? We take this car
to the nearest town.</i>

214
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:54,110
In the morning we'll rent a car, return this one
with cash inside for how much the damage is.

215
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,746
<i>- Right, Nik?
- Yeah, uh-huh. Right.</i>

216
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,723
- Fine.
- Yes!

217
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:05,958
<i>- I'm riding shotgun.
- You can ride whatever you want.</i>

218
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:11,801
<i>You got the keys?</i>

219
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:19,941
Don't worry. We'll stop by Kayla's car and
get the bags. Everything's gonna be okay.

220
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:23,209
Okay, but I'm leaving my number
in case the owner comes back.

221
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:27,446
Smart and sensible.
Just like my baby.

222
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:34,357
<i>- Come on, Mell
- Come on. Let's gol</i>

223
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:37,893
<i>Let's gol</i>

224
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:40,488
Come on. Get in.

225
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:46,722
<i>All right. A II right. Thank you.
Okay, so good news.</i>

226
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,202
There's a car rental place in Cedar City about
an hour away. They're holding a car for us.

227
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,465
Oh, good. I called Michelle
to tell her we'd be late.

228
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:56,167
But I told her we'd meet
her in Vegas tonight.

229
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:59,040
See, everybody?
That wasn't such a bad little detour, was it?

230
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,399
- Watch your head, Sis.
- Oh. Thanks.

231
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:30,032
<i>See, this is a ride.</i>

232
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:34,512
<i>'92 Harley Heritage Softail Classic.</i>

233
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,209
Fishtail carbs,
Corbin seat, and a bitch pad.

234
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:43,017
<i>Wow, that's extremely
butch of you, Melissa. No offense.</i>

235
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:48,219
All right, let me see if I know my fiancee.
You dated a gearhead in high school.

236
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:51,024
Gary Braddock.

237
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:55,430
<i>- I thought he was so hot.
- He taught us both how to ride.</i>

238
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:57,264
I just think he
wanted to hook up a threesome.

239
00:20:57,336 --> 00:21:00,305
<i>And who could blame poor
Gary Braddock for that?</i>

240
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:03,500
<i>Don't worry.
It never went anywhere.</i>

241
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,771
I just liked to ride his bike.

242
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:08,278
<i>What the-</i>

243
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:11,043
Fuck you, asshole!

244
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:13,482
- Yeah, rage against the machine, motherfucker!
- Son of a bitch!

245
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,543
Fuck.

246
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:29,325
I got me a bodacious case
of beaver fever, that's for sure.

247
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:32,461
Your old lady finds out,
you'll be off the super slab for good.

248
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:34,597
About my 18th hour straight.

249
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:37,471
Oh, my God, is that
Shakespeare we're hearing?

250
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:41,274
<i>Take it you kids are from out of town,
on your way to Vegas?</i>

251
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:44,373
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

252
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,716
Five bucks says she's got two names,
like Amy Sue, or PeggyJo, or-

253
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:52,621
- Twenty and you're on, harelip.
- Here you go. Best seats in the house.

254
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,421
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

255
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,421
I'm Nik.

256
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:02,024
I'm Jolene. That's one name,
not two. Guess you lost, pumpkin.

257
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:08,105
<i>Well, Jolene,
a round of specials, please...</i>

258
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:13,543
and my third-wave emo punk here
is gonna get the check.

259
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,546
Oh, that's just fantastic.

260
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:18,310
I'm already paying the bill for the window,
might as well pay for breakfast.

261
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:21,478
Thank you.

262
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:26,422
Uh-oh. Looks like we brought
chum to the shark tank.

263
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:29,859
Oh, that's romantic.
You're referring to us as piecemeal fish guts.

264
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:35,593
<i>Look around. We're surrounded by trucker trash.</i>

265
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:37,829
Just ignore 'em.
They're not bothering us.

266
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:40,736
<i>- Okay?
- Of course they're not. They know their place.</i>

267
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:44,298
<i>After all, truckers are just gacked-out speed
freaks whose only hope for companionship...</i>

268
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,970
<i>is a disease-ridden hooker.</i>

269
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:49,071
<i>Jesus, would you lower your voicel</i>

270
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:53,744
I bet you I can get one of these convoy wack
jobs to flip their lid and storm out of here.

271
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:56,219
Come on, gambler to gambler,
give me a chance to win my money back.

272
00:22:56,288 --> 00:23:00,224
You want a bet?
Here. Here's your bet.

273
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:03,728
- I bet you you won't shut
the hell up for five minutes.
- Five minutes? Six.

274
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:06,594
How about seven? Ten bucks?
Twenty?

275
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:12,569
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

276
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:16,074
You're not gonna cry, are you?

277
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:19,008
Courtesy flush.

278
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:22,070
We don't want this place
smelling like a truck stop.

279
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:33,852
Um, ten bucks
if you guys make out.

280
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:44,197
<i>And another special.</i>

281
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,897
Oh, that's Bobby's.
Right here. Thank you.

282
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:59,610
<i>So, you and Bobby can't
stay apart long enough...</i>

283
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:01,744
to have separate
bachelor/bachelorette parties?

284
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,288
<i>- That's pretty sad.
- Combo parties are in right now...</i>

285
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:06,308
especially when the couple has the same friends.

286
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:07,809
No, I'm not complaining.

287
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:09,817
<i>Trust me. I think
it's pretty interesting.</i>

288
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:12,728
I've always wanted to know what
goes on at a bachelorette bash.

289
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,925
- Can I be the stripper?
- You okay, Mel?

290
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,839
Why is Bobby taking so long?

291
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:29,847
<i>Cupcake, when we're
together four years...</i>

292
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:32,475
will you worry about me
when I'm out of your sight for 15 minutes?

293
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:35,748
<i>Oh, I'll worry about you...
cheating on me.</i>

294
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:38,415
<i>No, no, no. Give me a little
more credit than that.</i>

295
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,015
<i>I plan on keeping my affairs
completely discreet.</i>

296
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,323
- LikeJames Bond.
- How nice of you.

297
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:54,235
- Hello?
- I believe you have something of mine.

298
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:56,774
Shit. I think it's him.

299
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:58,207
- Him who?
- The car.

300
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,677
The car guy?

301
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:04,182
- Goldilocks? You there?
- Uh-

302
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:07,377
Goldilocks?

303
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:10,683
<i>Didn't you come into my place
when I wasn't home...</i>

304
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:14,055
just like Goldilocks
and the three bears.

305
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:17,721
Uh, yes. We're really very sorry.

306
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:22,324
We ran into an emergency, but we're bringing
the car back and money for any damages.

307
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,700
<i>- That's why I left my number.
- No rush.</i>

308
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:28,638
<i>No rush.</i>

309
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:31,733
<i>Wouldn't want you
to worry one hair on that...</i>

310
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,904
pretty blonde head of yours.

311
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,540
How did you know
I was blonde?

312
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:41,518
Lucky guess, Goldilocks.

313
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:46,552
Yeah, a-a-anyway.

314
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,355
<i>Um, okay.</i>

315
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:53,592
Thank you for not going to the police.

316
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:57,999
<i>Oh, I'd never do that.
I expect the same.</i>

317
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:03,840
I don't understand.
Why would I go to the police?

318
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:09,771
'Cause now I got
something of yours.

319
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:13,944
Your boyfriend.

320
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:25,759
Are they gonna have sex
in the bathroom?

321
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:28,459
Bobby!

322
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,633
Bobby! Bobby!

323
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:42,709
Bobby!

324
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:46,478
Bobby, where are you?

325
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:54,886
Bobby, are you okay?

326
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,485
<i>He can't come to the phone right now.</i>

327
00:26:57,562 --> 00:27:00,087
<i>He's a little... busy.</i>

328
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,798
Why are you doing this?

329
00:27:05,871 --> 00:27:07,805
Only seems fair.

330
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:11,832
I told you we were sorry about the car.
We didn't think anybody was home!

331
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:17,775
<i>It's about more than just the car.</i>

332
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:20,317
Please don't hurt him.

333
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:24,081
Aw, too late for that now.

334
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:27,848
I'm begging you.

335
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:35,189
<i>You want to see him again?
Alive?</i>

336
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,428
Of course!

337
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:41,336
Then we got a long road ahead of us.

338
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:46,275
There's just a couple of things
I'm gonna need you to do for me.

339
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,445
He wants to talk
on some private station or something.

340
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,579
- This is so fucked!
- Totally fucked!

341
00:27:57,656 --> 00:28:01,057
- I mean, who is this freak?
- Why would you leave your number?
Are you a complete idiot?

342
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:02,889
I didn't want anyone going to the police!

343
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:05,555
Just leave her alone, all right?
She was just being Mel.

344
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,431
How do we know this guy's for real? How do we
know he's not punking us like some sick joke?

345
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:13,903
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody out there?

346
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,532
<i>Hello? Is anybody there?</i>

347
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,643
<i>Goldilocks?</i>

348
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:24,682
Yes. Yes, I'm here.

349
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,886
Who are you?

350
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:33,915
<i>You can call me... Rusty Nail.</i>

351
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:38,626
Can I speak to Bobby?

352
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:43,501
Please? L-

353
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:46,162
I need to know that he's okay.

354
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,509
Oh, my God. Bobby! Bobby!

355
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,515
Okay. It's okay.

356
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:03,377
<i>You do what I asked?</i>

357
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:10,455
Yes.

358
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:14,195
<i>I got the cell phones.</i>

359
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:16,598
Line 'em up in front of the car.

360
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:20,104
No way! I waited two days
in line for this phone.

361
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,470
<i>Do it. Nowl</i>

362
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:28,540
- No.
- Move!

363
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:30,740
<i>- How's he gonna know if you do it or not?
- He's probably watching us.</i>

364
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:34,946
How do you know he's watching us?
How do you know that?

365
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,059
Okay.

366
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:44,755
<i>Start the car and drive forward.</i>

367
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:48,462
<i>Don't do it, Melissal
Don't do it, Melissa.</i>

368
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:52,492
- I have to.
- If you do it now, he'll know
he can do anything he wants.

369
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:55,472
This is fucking insane!

370
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:59,607
Don't do it!

371
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,778
Fuck!

372
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,013
Okay, it's done.

373
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:15,185
You follow everything I say
to the letter.

374
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,924
You do that, I promise
you'll all be reunited soon.

375
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:23,991
Don't get no ideas of
separatin' or goin' for help.

376
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,799
<i>Okay.</i>

377
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:30,171
We'll do whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

378
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:33,939
- Jesus. Make sure you tickle
his balls while you're at it.
- Shut up, Nik!

379
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:36,810
What do you want?

380
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:42,218
Remember when your girlfriend
there threw her drink at my rig?

381
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:46,690
That was him? He's one of them.
He's a fucking trucker!

382
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:49,727
She gave me something,
right after that.

383
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:53,457
<i>Ring any bells?</i>

384
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,201
I don't understand.

385
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,999
<i>She gave me the finger.</i>

386
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:05,374
<i>Now I want it.</i>

387
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:08,003
<i>She gave it to me,
I figure it's mine to keep.</i>

388
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,105
What? My finger?

389
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:14,311
<i>I'll let you know
the place and the time.</i>

390
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:17,184
You just make sure
it's freshly cut.

391
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:20,924
<i>And if you don't show up, well...</i>

392
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:23,722
<i>things will not go well
for your boy here.</i>

393
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:29,097
And, Goldilocks?

394
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:33,437
Yes?

395
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:35,837
I want you to bring it to me.

396
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:38,603
<i>It's time we met...</i>

397
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,570
in the flesh.

398
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:58,458
I can't believe this is happening.

399
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,226
I swear to God,
we're gonna find him.

400
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,291
- We can figure this out.
How smart can this guy be?
- He said he had eyes everywhere.

401
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:06,860
That's impossible.

402
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:10,465
<i>I mean, he can use his C.B. to ask his fellow
road zombies if they've seen this car.</i>

403
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:13,773
I mean, it's pretty unique. It's probably
how they found us in the first place.

404
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,780
And he almost definitely has a police scanner,
so it means we can't go to the cops.

405
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:20,113
- How do you know all this stuff?
- Dad used to be a trucker.

406
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:22,710
Let's just say, not a fan.

407
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:29,216
<i>- He could be in any one of them.
- It doesn't make sense for him to follow us...</i>

408
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:32,161
<i>until we meet him in...</i>

409
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,824
three hours, with
Kayla's severed finger.

410
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:38,767
We are not cutting off
my sister's finger.

411
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:42,432
My point is, is he's got to have something
to do between now and then.

412
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:44,441
Otherwise, he would've asked us
for it right then and there, right?

413
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:47,478
<i>- Okay.
- So, if he's not following us now...</i>

414
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:52,107
and we stay away from trucks and police, maybe
we can find ourselves some time to maneuver.

415
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:54,515
- He may be right.
- Thank you.

416
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:57,919
- What if he's wrong?
- Hell, it's not my funeral.

417
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:00,753
Hey, you know what? Why would
you say something like that?

418
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:02,986
- Sorry.
- Just shut up!

419
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,266
You know what? Maybe we
should just get him what he wants.

420
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:34,623
- I'm not going in there.
- Nobody's asking you to.

421
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:36,786
<i>I'll go. You know
I can handle blood.</i>

422
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:39,295
No. You know what?
This is my fault.

423
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:42,231
I gotta do this.

424
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,463
- I need you to come with me.
- For what?

425
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:05,312
Wait.

426
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:12,729
Go wait with Mel.

427
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,148
Fuck.

428
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:59,862
What's with the whole
"okay with blood" thing?

429
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:01,872
Forget about it, all right?

430
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,636
No, seriously, you go to, like, med school,
or just a lot of P.M.S.

431
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:08,042
What part of"forget about it"
is confusing you?

432
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:10,137
Shit. Shit.

433
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:29,793
- My God. Kayla. Kayla!
- Oh, shit.

434
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,163
Shit.

435
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:39,540
Oh, God.

436
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:43,479
<i>Fuck, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.</i>

437
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:45,675
Thank God.

438
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,026
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

439
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:00,656
I got a scalpel, too, just in case.

440
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,700
- Great.
- Let's go.

441
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:05,497
I'm in a fucking car
with a fucking finger.

442
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,971
- Come on! Get in!
- It's fantastic, really.

443
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,840
Oh, fuck! That's him!

444
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:17,677
That's the guy.
He wants his finger back! That's the guy.

445
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:20,274
<i>- He's coming for the fucking finger.
- I don't have the keys.</i>

446
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:22,945
- I left them right here! I
don't know where the keys are.
- Let's go!

447
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:26,286
Come on, man!

448
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:28,987
You can't park here!
Police escort vehicles only!

449
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:29,988
How many times do I have tell you?

450
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:31,792
Sorry.
We're really sorry.

451
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:34,093
We did-
It'll never happen again.

452
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:37,191
<i>- Sir.
- Yeah, sorry. Sorry, Mr. Lurch.</i>

453
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:05,356
<i>I'm not-I'm not so sure about this.</i>

454
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,796
<i>Relax. Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

455
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:12,234
Oh, great. Yeah, as long as we have the power
of positive thinking on our side.

456
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:15,761
I think this is it.

457
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:24,781
Stall him as long as you can.
Okay?

458
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,417
You be careful, okay?

459
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:36,892
Yeah.

460
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,187
<i>Okay, I'm here.</i>

461
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:08,553
Park about 50 feet away
from me, nose to nose.

462
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,031
What now?

463
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,401
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

464
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:31,211
<i>Then come around the front...</i>

465
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:34,374
and strip for me.

466
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,450
<i>Down to your underwear.</i>

467
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:42,459
<i>Gotta make sure you're not wearing
a weapon and a wire, now don't I?</i>

468
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:46,588
Please don't make me do this.

469
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:48,859
I'm not wearing anything.

470
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:53,495
- I'm losing my patience.
- Okay! Okay, okay.

471
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:55,562
I'll- I'll do whatever you say.

472
00:39:57,308 --> 00:40:00,766
<i>At my signal,
come up to the cab...</i>

473
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:03,336
<i>and give me what's mine.</i>

474
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:07,575
And then you'll let Bobby go?

475
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:11,088
<i>You do what I say...</i>

476
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:13,589
<i>and I promise
you'll see him again.</i>

477
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,657
Do it now.

478
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,392
<i>And, Goldilocks?</i>

479
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:23,661
Make it slow.

480
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:27,661
<i>I want to enjoy this.</i>

481
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:46,449
<i>Now why don't you show me that
pretty little ring of yours?</i>

482
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:50,537
- Oh, this is so messed up.
- Just keep moving.

483
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:53,140
I don't remember reading
any of this shit on your user profile.

484
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:57,779
- Are you serious? Just shut up!
- I'm sorry.

485
00:42:57,855 --> 00:43:00,756
L- I get nervous,
I tend to talk a lot.

486
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:17,471
Whoo-wee! That is the finest
striptease I ever did see!

487
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:20,374
I'm gonna throw this up
on YouTube, get me a million hits.

488
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:24,710
- Who are you?
- Whoever you want, sexy mama.

489
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:28,479
Close them pretty eyes and pretend
I'm Kenny Chesney for all I care.

490
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:32,748
Oh, my God.
You're not him?

491
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:39,458
- Where's Bobby?
- Bobby? What the high heck you talking about?

492
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,988
<i>All's I know is some road dawg came over the
squawk, told me that I'd get quite a show...</i>

493
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:45,729
if I pulled over
at this here chicken coop.

494
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:48,670
And, missy, let me tell you,
that did not disappoint one bit.

495
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:52,072
- Bobby!
- Bobby! Bobby!

496
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:55,943
- Why are you doing this?
- Goddamn it! Didn't warn me
you was no psycho she-bitch.

497
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:57,844
I'm out of here!

498
00:43:57,915 --> 00:44:00,679
<i>Your titties
are too small anywaysl</i>

499
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:03,948
I like them super mongo jugs.

500
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:06,512
Yeah, you heard me.
Circus boobs!

501
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:12,324
What was that?

502
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:15,092
Roll!

503
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,776
I don't understand.
I did everything you asked!

504
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,343
<i>No, you didn't.</i>

505
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:38,286
- I saw you down at the funeral parlor.
- Mel, what is going on?

506
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:42,884
<i>There's a big difference between
a freshly cut, live finger...</i>

507
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,327
<i>and one snipped from a corpse.</i>

508
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:48,331
Less blood in that one
you got there.

509
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:52,297
Stiffer, paler.

510
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,361
<i>The nail's yellowed...</i>

511
00:44:54,438 --> 00:44:58,568
<i>no nutrients, deterioratin'.</i>

512
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:02,840
Want to see what
a fresh one looks like?

513
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:05,040
Check the glove compartment.

514
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:43,286
Told you you'd see him again.

515
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:46,718
<i>I just didn't say
which part ofhim.</i>

516
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:51,854
<i>Your boy's losing a lot ofblood here.</i>

517
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,557
<i>Maybe I should take
care of that for him.</i>

518
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:56,759
No. No, no.

519
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,534
No!

520
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,618
What the fuck do you want?

521
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:26,086
We're not finished, Goldilocks.

522
00:46:26,163 --> 00:46:28,961
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

523
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:33,599
Heck of a joyride, isn't it?

524
00:46:39,877 --> 00:46:43,074
<i>Okay. So, uh, maybe- maybe now
we should go to the cops.</i>

525
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:45,775
What are they gonna do?
Put out an all-points bulletin?

526
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,785
<i>Set up roadblocks?
Rull over every big rig in Utah?</i>

527
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:51,447
- That's a damn good start.
- He's monitoring the police bands.

528
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:55,515
- He'll know the second we try to get help.
- No. No police. Absolutely not.

529
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:58,255
- What the fuck do you want to do then?
- Whatever he asks!

530
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:05,491
Next time, for sure we do exactly
what he asks, no matter what it is.

531
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:09,664
This is so fucked up.

532
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:28,182
You alive, boy?

533
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:30,887
Don't do anything stupid.

534
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:41,371
<i>Just goin'out for a minute.</i>

535
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:11,624
Sorry, hoss, but you got to be a member
to enter a bar in Utah.

536
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:18,306
<i>#Singin'my song to you #</i>

537
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:22,038
All right. But be quick.

538
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:25,406
Dick.

539
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:42,192

00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:44,200

00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:48,728

543
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:57,213
Help!

544
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:12,195
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.

545
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:18,627
Help!

546
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:20,863
What the fuck?

547
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,843
<i>Helpl</i>

548
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:31,745
What's going on in there?

549
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:33,840
- Help me!
- Holy fuck!

550
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:35,851
Open the door!

551
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:38,649
Hey, you hold on in there, buddy.
I'll get you out of here.

552
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:40,587
<i>Damn thing, it won't openl</i>

553
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:43,354
- No!
- I can't open the damn door!

554
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:55,261
Oh, my God.

555
00:50:06,617 --> 00:50:10,018
Did you see
the way his jaw dropped?

556
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:18,618
You like taking chances, huh?

557
00:50:18,696 --> 00:50:22,325
Well, then I got a game for you.

558
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:36,470
Rusty, can you hear me?

559
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:43,814
<i>Rusty, please talk to me.</i>

560
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:46,879
<i>Rusty, please talk to me.</i>

561
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:49,983
<i>It's been over an hour. Maybe he's, um-</i>

562
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,223
Well, maybe it's over.
Maybe he's, you know, already dead.

563
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:56,755
Shut up, Nik.
So much cooler over the Internet.

564
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:59,268
Yeah, so were you.

565
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:00,826
<i>Goldilocks?</i>

566
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:03,566
Y- Yes, Rusty.
Rusty, I'm here.

567
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,076
<i>Look, I'm-I'm sorry...</i>

568
00:51:07,144 --> 00:51:11,740
about what we did to you,
deceiving you like that.

569
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:14,750
<i>It won't happen again.
Just please-</i>

570
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:16,752
<i>please let me talk to Bobby.</i>

571
00:51:18,355 --> 00:51:22,223
I'm tired. Real tired.

572
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:25,591
Been gone a long time.

573
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:30,362
<i>I was heading home, you know.</i>

574
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:34,063
Planning on staying
off the road for a while.

575
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:36,299
Hibernatin'.

576
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:39,740
<i>Like a bear, huh, Goldilocks?</i>

577
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,176
Rusty, please-

578
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:44,874
please let me talk to Bobby.

579
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:47,940
<i>I love him more than...</i>

580
00:51:48,018 --> 00:51:51,112
<i>anything in the world.</i>

581
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:55,090
<i>And we're getting married.</i>

582
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:57,787
<i>Bobby, if you can hear me,
I love you.</i>

583
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:00,386
<i>I love you so much.</i>

584
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:04,156
<i>I need you to get something for me.</i>

585
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:08,137
Anything you want.

586
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:14,075
Some high-speed chicken feed.

587
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:18,648
- I don't know what that is.
- It's crank.

588
00:52:20,317 --> 00:52:23,013
It's trucker speak
for crystal meth.

589
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:25,850
What, now we're drug mules?
Fuck!

590
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:28,585
We're just gonna do
whatever he says.

591
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:31,628
Yeah. You know what? I'm just glad
it doesn't involve a fucking body part!

592
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:35,995
<i>I think it's about time for y'all
to take a walk on the wild side.</i>

593
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,841
Get in.

594
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:03,215
<i>#It's 2:00 in the morning
My baby's in bed #</i>

595
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:10,896
<i>Not exactly my scene, but I respect
their right to peaceful assembly.</i>

596
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:13,300
Go, go, go, go, go!

597
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,305
Or not so peaceful.

598
00:53:16,373 --> 00:53:19,035
All right, Rusty, we're here.

599
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:21,703
What now?

600
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:24,474
<i>Check the trunk.</i>

601
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:31,649
Fuck if I'm doing it.

602
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:06,679
What the hell?

603
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,027
<i>Did you get it, Goldilocks?</i>

604
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,897
What is this?

605
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,133
<i>Well, that's what the tattooed
boy's gonna wear.</i>

606
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:24,935
Oh, no fucking way.

607
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:29,371
<i>I want him to walk through this party...</i>

608
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:33,473
<i>Iookin'like
a disease-ridden lot lizard.</i>

609
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,543
<i>That's all us gacked-out,
speed-freak truckers can get...</i>

610
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:41,284
<i>so that's exactly what
he's gonna do for me.</i>

611
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:43,588
<i>Oh, my God. He was there.</i>

612
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,255
He heard everything. He was in the diner.
He heard everything you said!

613
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:49,595
- Way to go, Tattooboy2000!
- Shut up!

614
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:52,829
Take it easy, Finger Queen. You didn't exactly
ingratiate yourself to him either!

615
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:54,427
Shut up!

616
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,940
<i>You're a gambler, aren't you, boy?</i>

617
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:03,537
What's the odds you can stay out there
long enough to bring me what I want?

618
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:06,845
Zero! 'Cause it's not
fucking happening!

619
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:10,318
Want me to go out there
dressed like a fucking tranny?

620
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:14,149
They'll kill me.
Not doing it.

621
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:16,158
Oh, you're doing it.

622
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:24,466
- I'm not doin' it.
- Yes. You are.

623
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:27,367
<i>- Excuse me?
- You're gonna go out there...</i>

624
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:30,270
<i>and you're gonna do everything
he asks to the letter...</i>

625
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,174
'cause Bobby's life
depends on it.

626
00:55:34,244 --> 00:55:36,769
- Fuck you.
- Hey, know what, Nik?

627
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:39,145
<i>Fuck you too.
Most of all, fuck himl</i>

628
00:55:41,018 --> 00:55:44,215
<i>Fuckl What the fuck are you doing, bitch?</i>

629
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:47,916
You are not going anywhere.

630
00:55:52,195 --> 00:55:56,723
I don't even know why I stayed around this long.
I barely know you or your boyfriend.

631
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:02,067
And, you,
I'm sorry, but you're just not worth it.

632
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:05,074
<i>From now on, this is between
you guys and Rusty Dickhole.</i>

633
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:08,840
Good night and good luck.

634
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:14,383
<i>You're not gonna have to
worry about Rusty anymore, Nik...</i>

635
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:16,419
'cause right now
I'm your fucking problem.

00:56:16,486 --> 00:56:18,920
<i>Mel? Mel.</i>

637
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:22,152
I am not gonna let you
jeopardize Bobby's life.

638
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:25,160
Mel, I think you have to calm down.

639
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:27,162
<i>Mel, give me the scalpel.</i>

640
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,164
I'm sorry.

641
00:56:29,232 --> 00:56:33,430
I will do whatever
it takes to save him.

642
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:35,664
'Cause Bobby is worth it.

643
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:42,703
I can't go out there
dressed like a fucking tranny.

644
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:45,077
<i>I can't do that.
They'll kill me.</i>

645
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:48,276
Please don't make me do this.
I just want to go home. I just-

646
00:56:48,351 --> 00:56:50,285
Please.

647
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:53,618
<i>- You're not much of a tough guy now, huh?
- Please.</i>

648
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,885
All tattooed and pierced.

649
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:57,586
They're fake. Lookit.

650
00:56:57,661 --> 00:57:01,392
<i>They're fucking fakel
They're fakel</i>

651
00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:03,763
You're a little
fucking douche bag!

<i>Rlease. Rlease.</i>

653
00:57:09,973 --> 00:57:13,670
<i>Listen to me, Nik.
We're going to make sure...</i>

654
00:57:13,744 --> 00:57:15,678
that you pass as a girl.

655
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:18,271
<i>- Oh, that won't be a problem.
- You're gonna go out there...</i>

656
00:57:18,348 --> 00:57:23,251
<i>you're gonna get some speed from some dirt ball
too wasted to even know the difference...</i>

657
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,915
and everything's
gonna run smoothly, okay?

658
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:40,331
Okay.

659
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:45,067
Goldilocks, you out there?

660
00:57:45,142 --> 00:57:49,078
<i>You better not bail on us.
'Cause I'll call you out on it so damn fast.</i>

661
00:57:49,146 --> 00:57:52,445
I said I'd fucking do it!
Okay?

662
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:56,748
<i>How's my little hussy?</i>

663
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,988
We're just finishing
some final touches.

00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:42,398
<i># Well, I'm a monkey-doin'man #</i>

667
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:54,835
We should follow him.

668
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:59,838
No. We can't leave this car.

669
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:03,352
He didn't say anything to us
about staying put this time, right?

670
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,321
I mean,
this could be a trap.

671
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:17,229
Hey! Come on over, sexy lady!

672
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,894
Hey, you want some of this, huh?

673
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,530
<i>- Does any-
- You want a real man behind you?</i>

674
00:59:22,606 --> 00:59:26,269
<i>- Does anybody have any meth?
- You like it like that?</i>

675
00:59:44,995 --> 00:59:46,963
<i>Rusty's here, Mel.</i>

676
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:50,830
<i>He is. A nd we have to
try to find out who he is...</i>

677
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:53,802
what his truck looks like, where he might be
keeping Bobby, something.

678
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:57,237
He said that if we followed
everything that he told us-

679
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:59,468
<i>He would reunite us.
Which really only means...</i>

680
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:03,603
if we keep following his demands,
we're all gonna end up dead.

681
01:00:08,652 --> 01:00:11,621
Does anybody have any crystal?

682
01:00:11,688 --> 01:00:15,886
Hey, sweet tits!
I got what you're lookin' for.

683
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:20,828
Maybe we can work somethin' out
in trade, huh?

684
01:00:20,897 --> 01:00:23,127
I'm sorry. No- No, thanks.

685
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:27,427
Why are you
running away from me?

686
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:33,171
Fuck.

687
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:50,485
- Oh, shit!
- You can't-

688
01:00:54,764 --> 01:00:56,527
Oh, my God! Shit!

689
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:01,967
Oh, my God!

690
01:01:02,038 --> 01:01:04,006
Hey, little girl.

691
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:08,977
Nik! Nik!

692
01:01:09,045 --> 01:01:11,013
No! Get back in the car!

693
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:20,453
<i>Back to the carl
We gotta chase himl</i>

694
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:35,894
- That fuck head!
- We can't follow him!

695
01:01:35,972 --> 01:01:38,406
He's gonna kill Bobby,
and then he's gonna kill us!

696
01:01:38,475 --> 01:01:40,807
This is our one chance.

697
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:44,745
<i>- He's taunting us.
- Kayla, please.</i>

698
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,027
Where did he go?

699
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:08,036
I don't see him.

700
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:19,073
Oh, my God! Go!

701
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:31,620
Oh, my God!

702
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:38,361
Fuck!

703
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:47,603
What?

704
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:52,879
I can't- Okay.

705
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:56,580
I can't go any faster!

706
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,291
Oh, my God!

707
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:11,458
No!

708
01:04:41,257 --> 01:04:43,191
Mel.

709
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:47,554
Mel, can you hear me?

710
01:04:49,265 --> 01:04:51,199
<i>Mel?</i>

711
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:53,758
Oh, thank God.

712
01:04:53,836 --> 01:04:57,294
I'm gonna-
I'm gonna get you out of here.

713
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:09,678
I'll get you out of here.

714
01:05:27,804 --> 01:05:31,103
You have to wait until the last moment
to jump, okay?

715
01:05:32,175 --> 01:05:34,200
What are you talking about?

716
01:05:34,277 --> 01:05:38,646
If you time it right, he won't be able
to see you from this angle.

717
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:40,580
You have to go.

718
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:42,140
Oh, my God.

719
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:46,985
Go. Go. Come on. Get up.

720
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:51,393
Come on.

721
01:05:54,497 --> 01:05:56,465
That's good.

722
01:05:57,567 --> 01:06:00,434
Okay. I gotta
get you out of here.

723
01:06:00,503 --> 01:06:04,337
Sis. Sis.

724
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:07,968
My leg's pinned.

725
01:06:08,044 --> 01:06:10,512
I'm not going anywhere.

726
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:17,413
- You have to go.
- I'm not.

727
01:06:17,487 --> 01:06:19,853
- You have to go.
- I'm not going.

728
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:25,194
Promise me you'll finish this.

729
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,195
I promise.

730
01:08:34,824 --> 01:08:38,260
What the fuck's going on?
Where are we?

731
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:41,057
<i>Where it all started.</i>

732
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,461
<i>Where I can
take my time with you.</i>

733
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:57,304
<i>Couple ofbig-time risk takers, huh?</i>

734
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,405
Pl-Pl-Please let us go.

735
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:04,144
You like to gamble?

736
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:07,553
Like to take chances?

737
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:11,252
- You like to steal cars?
- It wasn't my idea!

738
01:09:11,327 --> 01:09:13,852
Come on, please.
I'll do anything you want.

739
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:17,491
- Nik, stop talking.
- Anything, I mean it. Sky's the limit, man.

740
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:20,263
Shut up!

741
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:23,931
Stop talking.

742
01:09:25,241 --> 01:09:27,937
What's your favorite game?

743
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:35,106
- Or you prefer I complete your transformation?
- No, no, no!

744
01:09:35,184 --> 01:09:38,881
Stop, stop!

745
01:09:38,955 --> 01:09:42,447
<i>I said,
what's your favorite game?</i>

746
01:09:44,427 --> 01:09:47,453
Craps! Craps!

747
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:51,990
Good one. Nice odds.

748
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:54,400
I got my own favorite game.

749
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:57,539
You want to play?

750
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:01,733
You're up first.

751
01:10:05,715 --> 01:10:07,649
- What do you want me to do?
- Roll!

752
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:22,428
<i>Five.</i>

753
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:29,403
<i>- Kneecap.
- Fuck.</i>

754
01:10:33,276 --> 01:10:35,904
No!

755
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,616
Your turn.

756
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,861
How do you want me
to do the other leg?

757
01:11:17,353 --> 01:11:19,446
<i>Seven.</i>

758
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:24,550
Safe. Lucky you.

759
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:27,596
Again.

760
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:30,655
I don't want to play anymore.

761
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:34,134
I don't like repeating myself!

762
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:36,228
Ow!

763
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:40,139
They're-They're-
They're-They're fake. Sorry.

764
01:11:40,209 --> 01:11:42,109
Roll.

765
01:11:57,927 --> 01:12:00,293
<i>Four. Chest.</i>

766
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,734
What is he doing?

767
01:12:13,009 --> 01:12:15,637
<i>- Oh, shit.
- What is he doing?</i>

768
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:18,271
I'm so sorry.

769
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:26,818
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

770
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:34,359
Help! Help!

771
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:02,149
Help!

772
01:13:16,706 --> 01:13:20,437
<i>Come on, lover boy.
It's just a game.</i>

773
01:13:20,509 --> 01:13:22,067
Stay with me now.

774
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:28,884
I can't do this.

775
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:31,317
Roll.

776
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:38,516
I said roll!

777
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:45,599
<i>Rlease, don't.</i>

778
01:13:45,668 --> 01:13:47,602
Don't. Bobby, don't.

779
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:55,502
<i>Rlease, don't.</i>

780
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:03,416
Uh-oh. Double ones.

781
01:14:03,486 --> 01:14:05,420
Somebody just crapped out.

782
01:14:06,522 --> 01:14:08,786
What does that mean?

783
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:12,658
What does that mean?

784
01:14:12,728 --> 01:14:16,289
- Look familiar?
- Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

785
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:20,268
You wanted to use this
on me, didn't ya?

786
01:14:20,336 --> 01:14:22,327
You were trying to kill us.

787
01:14:22,404 --> 01:14:24,770
<i>Now, didn't you ever hear...</i>

788
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,331
two wrongs just
don't make a right?

789
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:36,676
Where are you?

790
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:45,858
Nik, look at me.

791
01:14:47,029 --> 01:14:49,122
Help me.

792
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:55,196
Where the fuck are you?

793
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:58,138
- Where is he?
- Look at me.

794
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:00,072
Where is he? Please?

795
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:03,634
<i>I'm here. Don't you worry.</i>

796
01:15:04,847 --> 01:15:07,816
Right behind you.

797
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:12,706
Well, there you go.

798
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:16,643
Just you and me now.
You're the only one left.

799
01:17:16,712 --> 01:17:18,646
Oh, God, Melissa.

800
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:21,114
Yeah. She's dead too.

801
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:25,485
It's a damn shame.

802
01:17:25,554 --> 01:17:28,250
I was having fun.

803
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:15,800
Why are you doing this?

804
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:19,830
I want you to feel what it's like to have
something taken away from you.

805
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:22,138
You took everything from me!

806
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:25,271
Not everything.

807
01:18:25,347 --> 01:18:27,281
Not yet.

808
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:31,047
It was only a car.

809
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,351
It may get a little bouncy back here.

810
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,823
You be sure to hang on tight.

811
01:18:56,512 --> 01:18:58,742
Don't go doing anything clever.

812
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:36,646
Son of a bitch!

813
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:39,243
- Melissa!
- Bobby?

814
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:42,085
<i>Melissal</i>

815
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:45,490
Bobby! Bobby, are you there?

816
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:47,552
<i>Melissa!</i>

817
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:51,497
- Are you all right?
- Shut the power to the trailer.

818
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:54,627
<i>- What?
- Shut the power to the trailerl</i>

819
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:58,332
It's in the cab. Get the truck
and take us out of here.

820
01:20:52,694 --> 01:20:54,286
<i>Bobbyl</i>

821
01:20:54,363 --> 01:20:56,957
<i>Melissa, gol</i>

822
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:43,100
We need help. Is anyone there?
Send the police. Exit 57 West.

823
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:44,631
Where are you,
you son of bitch?

824
01:23:14,202 --> 01:23:16,033
Goldilocks.

825
01:25:31,173 --> 01:25:33,141
<i>Is it over?</i>

826
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:43,117
It is now.

827
01:26:03,438 --> 01:26:05,633
<i>Shitl</i>

828
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:07,937
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

829
01:26:11,646 --> 01:26:14,945
Shit!

830
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:20,515
Of course.

831
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:31,524
Hey! Help!

832
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,160
Help!

833
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:36,227
Asshole.

834
01:26:56,858 --> 01:26:59,292
My car won't start.

835
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:01,989
<i>Get in.</i>

836
01:27:13,441 --> 01:27:15,375
<i>You'll catch your death out there.</i>
