1
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:05,765
Automatic doors
by Magi-Door Company...

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:08,682
- Thank you.
...the automatic door manufactured...

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,283
...that can be opened
as far as a mile away.

4
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:15,567
And as you approach your garage, you
merely press the button in your car...

5
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:18,119
...like so...

6
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,399
...and presto,
the garage door is open.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,522
Presto, the garage door is closed.

8
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:29,477
- How do you like that for magic?
- Not bad.

9
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,249
I have some brochures here
that explain everything.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,888
Would you like to take one home?

11
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:43,641
Abner, Samantha Stephens.

12
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,004
I'll see you at the car, Abner.

13
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,162
- You all right?
- I think so.

14
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,285
Didn't you read?
This door is out of order.

15
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,441
Not for Samantha Stephens, it isn't.
How is that, Abner?

16
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:11,002
- Tell me. Please explain it to me.
- I'll explain it you. You're out of order.

17
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,767
Abner, did you see that?

18
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:17,759
Now, that's what I call magic.

19
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,522
She opened the garage door.

20
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,441
So, what do you want me to do,
applaud?

21
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:27,964
No, no, she opened it,
no hands, nothing.

22
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,199
- She just sat there.
- Why don't you stop.

23
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:34,078
They probably got an electric door like
they demonstrated down at the market.

24
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:37,764
I don't believe it.
She opens doors without electricity.

25
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:41,126
Somebody ought to tell the electric
company. They're losing a bundle.

26
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm losing a bundle on you.
I have to pay for a glass door.

27
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:47,083
Eye glasses, lessons on how to read
would be cheaper.

28
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:51,399
All right, go ahead and joke.
I'm telling you, she's strange.

29
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,964
- She's strange? You're strange.
- So prove it.

30
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,439
- Prove you're strange?
- Prove they've got an electric door.

31
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,520
- How?
- Go over and ask them.

32
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,606
I will. Tonight I'll go.

33
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,487
Why do you have to wait
until tonight?

34
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,045
Because if I have to look like an idiot,
I'd rather do it in the dark.

35
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:20,278
I don't know, Sam, this is expensive.
I can make do with my old rod and reel.

36
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,679
You cannot make do
with your old rod and reel.

37
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,761
This is your vacation.
You've earned it and deserve the best.

38
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:28,159
- I have spoken.
- Like a true and loving wife.

39
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,127
Which, by an odd coincidence,
I just happen to be.

40
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,168
Best odd coincidence I ever heard of.

41
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,564
Somebody's timing leaves
much to be desired.

42
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,640
Much.

43
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,324
- Well, hi, Mr. Kravitz.
- Hello, Mr. Stephens.

44
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,447
- Come in.
- No. No, thank you.

45
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,204
I just stopped by for a second.
I wanted to ask you about your door.

46
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,882
- Our door?
- Pretty nice.

47
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,688
I've been thinking of getting one too.
You recommend it?

48
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,407
- Why, no house should be without one.
- Wait a minute.

49
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,800
I'm not talking about this door.
I was talking about your garage door.

50
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:13,081
- Our garage door?
- I'm thinking of getting one.

51
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,683
And today when my wife and I
saw yours work...

52
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,961
- Ours work?
- Your electric door.

53
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:20,798
Samantha.

54
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,998
Was our electric garage door
working today, sweetheart?

55
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:33,084
- Only once.
- Only once. That's what I'm afraid of.

56
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:36,527
Some of these new gimmicks,
they haven't got the kinks out yet.

57
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,759
Did you get yours from the guy
at the market?

58
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,448
I forget.

59
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,642
Which market did we
get ours from, sweetheart?

60
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:47,601
- Do you mind if I have a look at it?
- Look at it?

61
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,803
Well, there's no point in looking
at it tonight...

62
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,403
...it's so dark out,
especially with it not working.

63
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,366
Why don't you come back
tomorrow night.

64
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,247
We'll give you a full demonstration.

65
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,606
Yes. Thank you.

66
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:07,000
Darling...

67
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,002
...what are you going to do?
- Do?

68
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,528
It's simple.

69
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,408
I'll have to buy one new
electric garage door...

70
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:17,845
...and make do
with one old rod and reel.

71
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,608
You ready, Max?

72
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:30,605
Okay, now. Three, two, one, zero.

73
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,483
A-okay, Noel.

74
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,322
Be my guest.

75
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:50,447
Well, that wraps it up, lady.

76
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:53,567
- Wear it in good health.
- Just what I've always wanted.

77
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,363
Only not really.

78
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,407
You know you can be as far
as a block away and open that door?

79
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,924
Is that so? That's hard to believe.

80
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,804
Well, your husband should be
very pleased with it.

81
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:07,928
I don't think so.
He didn't wanna buy it for himself.

82
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,001
- He didn't?
- No.

83
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,961
That's why you had it put in, huh?

84
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:17,759
- We had it put in for the neighbours.
- That makes sense.

85
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:20,489
Not to me, it doesn't.

86
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:37,408
Bye.

87
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:42,880
Ain't it a shame?
Always the good-Iooking ones.

88
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:46,041
Here, they come up empty.

89
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:49,248
I was just thinking
of that installation on Maple.

90
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,084
I put in one of these doors and tuned in
the receiver just a little bit wrong.

91
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,888
- What happened?
- I got tuned in on the aircraft bands.

92
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,563
- An aircraft band?
- Every time a plane went overhead...

93
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,961
...and the pilot turned on the radio,
it opened the Brians' garage door.

94
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,882
It was a real fluke.

95
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:09,803
I probably couldn't do it again
if I tried.

96
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:31,723
I closed that.

97
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,767
At least I thought I did.

98
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,877
I know I did.

99
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:01,682
All right, have it your own way.
Stay open.

100
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,167
- Hello, dear.
- Oh, hi, Moth...

101
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,367
- I should have known.
- What are you talking about?

102
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,680
You're the one that's been opening
and closing my garage door.

103
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,487
I've been doing nothing of the kind.

104
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,200
Oh, really, Samantha,
if I was starved for entertainment...

105
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:46,442
...I certainly could conjure up
something more amusing than that.

106
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,927
Then who has been doing it?

107
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:07,806
I haven't the faintest idea.

108
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:11,882
Now, what's all this nonsense
about garage doors, anyway?

109
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,005
Well, it's a long, dull story, Mother.

110
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,366
I made the mistake of flipping ours
open, and Gladys Kravitz saw me.

111
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,327
- Is that the story?
- Just about.

112
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:24,960
Well, it's not long,
but it certainly is dull.

113
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,519
Darrin was afraid that Mrs. Kravitz's
curiosity might lead to trouble.

114
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,886
He gave up his fishing equipment
and bought this gadget for the door.

115
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,007
That is sad.

116
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:37,605
That's the longest, dullest,
saddest story I've ever heard.

117
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:39,680
But if that's
all that's troubling you...

118
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:43,205
...I'll fix it.

119
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,279
Oh, my stars.

120
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,764
All right, Mother, your little joke
is over, now take all this stuff away.

121
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,848
I thought you said Dobbin needed
new fishing equipment.

122
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:03,407
- Dobbin is a horse.
- Yes.

123
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:08,844
Darrin is my husband, and he wants
fishing equipment he pays for himself.

124
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,320
Abner!

125
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:23,360
All right. All right, Samantha.
No lectures, please.

126
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:32,487
Good.

127
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:37,319
Look for yourself.
I never saw anything like it.

128
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:40,083
Stop pushing. I know that
when I turn my head to look...

129
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,728
...there will be nothing there.

130
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,006
Stop talking.
Get up on that thing and look.

131
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:53,925
- Like I said, there's nothing there.
- What?

132
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,043
But I saw it.

133
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,882
It was a room full of poles
and reels and fish.

134
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:08,201
With a sailfish this big,
and rubber boots. Hey!

135
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:19,928
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.

136
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:22,284
- You're late.
- I know. I missed the bus.

137
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,565
That's another thing
we can blame on that door.

138
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:26,003
- Another thing?
- Yes.

139
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:29,639
If you hadn't had to leave the car
to have that thing installed... Oh, well.

140
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,527
Hurry up.

141
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,963
I tried to call you,
but you were in a meeting.

142
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,563
- Why, what's the matter?
- That door.

143
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:43,118
I wondered why you left it open.

144
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:45,200
You mean it's open again?

145
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,803
That's the fifth time today.
That's what I mean.

146
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:51,046
- What's what you mean?
- Well, it keeps opening and closing...

147
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,040
...opening and closing all by itself.

148
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:55,245
At first, I thought
Mother was responsible...

149
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:56,967
...but she swears she isn't.

150
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:00,519
Then I thought it might be the kids
in the neighbourhood fooling around...

151
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,964
...so I watched, but no kids.

152
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,367
No kids, huh?

153
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:08,605
No. They were all in school.

154
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,329
Really, Darrin, it's strange.
There was nobody around...

155
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,002
...nobody around for miles.

156
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,287
And the door kept opening and closing
all by itself, huh?

157
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:19,922
Exactly.

158
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,960
It's eerie. It gives me the creeps.

159
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:27,482
- What do you suggest we do about it?
- Well, that's the best part.

160
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,719
The solution to all our problems.

161
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:34,486
Well, there's obviously something
the matter with that darn door...

162
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:37,482
...defective or something, so...
- So?

163
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:41,443
So we call the company
after we've shown it to the Kravitzs...

164
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,167
...to prove we really had one.

165
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,765
We show them that it doesn't work,
which we established last night.

166
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:49,483
We make the company
take back the door...

167
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:52,761
...they return the money, and you get
your rod and reel as planned.

168
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,921
- Marvellous?
- Marvellous.

169
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,483
That was a nice touch
about your mother.

170
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:06,484
And I like the bit about the kids too.
It gave it a note of reality.

171
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:09,482
Darrin, don't you believe me?

172
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,806
Even if it were true, the company
wouldn't give us our money back.

173
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:15,688
They'd just fix the door, that's all.

174
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:19,125
What do you mean "if it were true"?

175
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:22,087
Come on, honey,
we've gotta get going.

176
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,727
Darrin.

177
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,244
Sweetheart, will you come on?

178
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:28,888
Darrin.

179
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,283
Darrin.

180
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,963
Darling, I appreciate
why you wanna do this.

181
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,723
I know you feel guilty about
our having to buy that door.

182
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,005
It's generous of you
to wanna make it up to me.

183
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:42,603
But you can't do it with this.
That would be cheating.

184
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:46,648
If you put a... on that door and threw
the mechanism out of whack...

185
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,606
...the company will have to pay for it.

186
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,361
You don't believe me.

187
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,884
I want you to put your nose
out to pasture.

188
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,927
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- I am not being ridiculous.

189
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:00,128
As a matter of fact, I'm not suggesting,
requesting, not even putting in a plea.

190
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:05,687
I am commanding. Calmly,
but commanding. No more witchcraft.

191
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,403
No matter how tempted
or provoked you may be.

192
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,799
- You mean like now.
- That's right. Even like now.

193
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,801
- Sam.
- Darrin.

194
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:18,483
If you don't listen to me,
we're going to have a fight.

195
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,038
If you don't do as I ask,
we're going to have a war.

196
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,286
All right.

197
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:27,566
All right. Believe me...

198
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:31,961
...nothing in this world could ever
make me resort to witchcraft again.

199
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:33,687
Not after this.

200
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:41,601
- Shall we go?
- Thank you.

201
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:17,884
Abner, they just came out of the house.
They're getting into the car.

202
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,920
- Who?
- The Stephens.

203
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:24,486
You interrupted Johann Sebastian Bach
to deliver that startling bulletin?

204
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:29,042
- I think they're going out together.
- Well, that's nice. They're married.

205
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,563
- Where is it?
- What?

206
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:42,560
The button.

207
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:47,641
Thank you.

208
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,920
What's the matter?

209
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,886
It's... Nothing the matter.

210
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,880
It's out of kilter or something.

211
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:19,643
- I'll let it rest for a minute.
- Oh, by all means.

212
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,562
We wouldn't want to tire it out.

213
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:25,558
Now.

214
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:35,241
- It's dead.
- In this marvellous door?

215
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:39,322
If you hadn't played around with it
this afternoon...

216
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,162
It either operates electronically
or manually.

217
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,366
I suggest that if we're going to get
to the Tates' this evening...

218
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,999
...you open it manually.
- That's what I'm doing.

219
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:02,768
- They'll hear you.
- Well, I've got nothing to hide.

220
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:04,960
I do. I don't want them
peeking over here...

221
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:07,689
...while I'm spying on them,
so don't play.

222
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:10,282
Well, let me know when they go.

223
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,885
They're just sitting in the car
in the garage.

224
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,637
Good.

225
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:19,926
Should I go back to Bach, or would
you rather hear "Cheek to Cheek"?

226
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,888
What would you like, Gladys?
Make a request.

227
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:25,523
Don't play.

228
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:30,967
Wait a minute.

229
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:34,568
- Where's the switch?
- What switch?

230
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:38,039
To put it on manual. Can't operate it
manually unless you turn off...

231
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:40,809
- They never talked about a switch.
- You didn't ask?

232
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,159
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.
- Outside, maybe.

233
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:51,717
They don't put them outside,
they put them inside...

234
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,608
...in case somebody gets trapped
in the garage.

235
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,727
How could anyone get trapped
in a garage?

236
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,046
Well, they could have a short,
like we have...

237
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:05,724
...and they might not be able
to find the switch, like we can't...

238
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:09,444
...and they might get trapped
in the garage, like we are.

239
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,718
Sam, we gotta get out of here.

240
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,006
- How?
- I don't know how.

241
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,646
Sure I do.

242
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:25,924
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead what?

243
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,317
You know.

244
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,128
- Open the door.
- You're kidding.

245
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:34,446
- Do I look like I'm kidding?
- You made me swear.

246
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,486
My solemn oath. My vow.

247
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,568
But this is an emergency.

248
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,684
You said "under no conditions,"
and I quote.

249
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm glad you remember,
sweetheart, but...

250
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,484
Under no circumstances.

251
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:50,647
Well, that's right.
And that's what I meant.

252
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:53,482
But under no ordinary
circumstances...

253
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:57,278
...and these are certainly not
ordinary circumstances.

254
00:18:57,449 --> 00:19:00,964
- So I uncommand you.
- You can't do that.

255
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:03,927
It can't be "no" one minute
and "yes" the next.

256
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,523
If I give my word,
and I gave my word...

257
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,122
...it's a matter of principle.

258
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,806
It is indeed a matter of principle.

259
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:19,083
And I, your husband, am asking you,
my wife, to open that door.

260
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:31,640
Thank you. Thank you very much.

261
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,447
Darrin.

262
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,884
I didn't touch that door, honestly.

263
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:38,200
Of course you didn't,
but thank you anyway.

264
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,160
You don't believe me.

265
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:44,483
Well, that does it.

266
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:55,081
- Sam, what you are doing?
- That is one crazy, nutty, rotten door.

267
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,046
If you're gonna believe it and not me,
there's no point in going on.

268
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:00,688
So take your pick, it or me.

269
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:03,403
For crying out loud,
do you know what you're saying?

270
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:07,359
I know that I'm perfectly willing
to take the blame for anything I do.

271
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:10,601
But I am not going to take the blame
for whoever or whatever...

272
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,125
...is turning that door
into an electronic yo-yo.

273
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,405
So there.

274
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:21,126
- Gladys, get away from the window.
- Could you explain something to me?

275
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,041
If it's about why we got married, no.

276
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:25,643
Why would two grown-up people
get all dressed up...

277
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,085
...walk out their front door
into the garage and just sit there?

278
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:31,638
Why, Abner? Explain it to me.
What are they doing?

279
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,606
Maybe they're necking.

280
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,964
I want you to come over there
with me right now.

281
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,562
- Gladys, please.
- No, I mean it.

282
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:41,324
There's something fishy going on,
and I wanna find out what it is.

283
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:43,923
Sam.

284
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,079
Don't be angry.
What's there to be angry about?

285
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:55,001
You don't believe me.
That's plenty to get angry about.

286
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:58,201
I believe you. If you're gonna get
this angry, I believe you.

287
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:03,085
- You promise?
- I promise.

288
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,763
I know they're in there.
I saw them with my own eyes.

289
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,920
- Didn't you see them, Abner?
- Yes, Gladys.

290
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:12,807
What are they doing in there?

291
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,437
Inhaling carbon monoxide, maybe.
How do I know?

292
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,521
You may be right.

293
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:20,281
Open the door, Abner.

294
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:23,247
It's not my place
to open their door, Gladys.

295
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:30,924
There. You see?

296
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,478
I couldn't have opened it.
You were kissing me.

297
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:36,117
You were in front of my nose.
You saw my nose.

298
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,884
Now, take it easy, sweetheart.
I believe you. I believe you.

299
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:41,681
- Did you hear that, Abner?
- What?

300
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,204
- Something about her nose.
- Keep your voice down.

301
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:47,846
Good evening.

302
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:53,003
We saw you going into the garage, and
we thought maybe you were in trouble.

303
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:56,527
We couldn't get the door open.
I was asking my wife to open it.

304
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,998
You asked her
to open the garage door?

305
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:02,326
Well, it wouldn't open.
That seemed like the only solution.

306
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:06,885
That isn't what I mean at all.
What I mean is...

307
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,688
Sometimes you hear about women
doing things with hairpins.

308
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,888
- You understand what I mean?
- Well, I do.

309
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,598
You see, he means that sometimes
women can work magic...

310
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,646
...with things that don't work.

311
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,325
And when that happens,
a man should definitely let her do so.

312
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:27,559
- Right, darling?
- Right, darling.

313
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,766
Well, we've got to get going.
Good night.

314
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:33,244
- Good night.
- Night.

315
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,449
Notice I didn't say one word
about her being strange.

316
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,486
I'm glad you didn't. She isn't. He is.

317
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,889
Well, it's all fixed.
You won't have that problem again.

318
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:59,768
- What about the Kravitzs' door?
- Oh, theirs is working fine.

319
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,727
But while we're here,
we'll check it again just to make sure.

320
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,880
Why don't you turn off
the Kravitzs' door...

321
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,324
...until we check it for shorts.
- I already did.

322
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:09,878
- That's what I was doing. It's off now.
- Swell.

323
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:12,483
Well, Mr. Stephens,
would you like to give it a try?

324
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:14,321
Okay.

325
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,603
There, now, see?

326
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,765
- How about that?
- That's real nice.

327
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,566
We got ours too.

328
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,600
