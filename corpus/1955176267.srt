00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,768
[man] fiber optics.

6
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,704
Now, it's a little bit
more expensive,

7
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,273
but in terms of home security,
it's top of the line.

8
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,142
1080p, backup batteries,

9
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,643
and they're
practically invisible.

10
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,679
There is nothing
more off-putting

11
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,547
than inviting some folks over to your place,

12
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,883
they see one of these ancient,
convenient store cameras,

13
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,486
pointing directly at them as they're
waiting out on your front porch.

14
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,287
You know what i mean?
Who wants that?

15
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,489
No one.

16
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,190
These little
guys right here,

17
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,192
they can be hidden
almost anywhere.

18
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,195
"Discretion"
is the name of the game.

19
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,364
They can be indoor,
they can be outdoor,

20
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,900
underwater, anywhere.
Okay, now,

21
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,803
i wouldn't put 'em in the bottom of
your toilet bowl, or anything-- [laughs]

22
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,739
unless you're into
that sort of thing.

23
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,680
You seem like
a reasonable guy.

24
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,682
Why don't
we hook you up?

25
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,395

27
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,554
this is ridiculous.
Call him again.

28
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,856
He's on his way,
calm down.

29
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,425
I'm starving.
I'm tired.

30
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,461
I'm carrying
a bowling ball with me.

[Vehicle approaching]

32
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,433
- yikes.
- No fucking way.

33

Jesus. Claire, stop.

34
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,637
Come on. Come on.

35
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,239
[Lowered voice]
you're kidding me.

36
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,313
- Hi, how you doing?
- [Man] uh-huh.

37
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,983
[Whispering] there are bodies
buried in the backyard.

38
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:41,253
- [Whispering] stop.
- [Mumbling]

39
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,759
- [man #2] oh, wow.
- [Woman] oh.

40
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,231
[Woman] this fireplace
is actually nice.

41
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,533

44
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,939
[Whispering]
do you smell that?

45
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,441
It smells like a dirty diaper.

46
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,909
Jesus claire, shut up.

47
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,545
- All these appliances new?
- [Man #1] yep.

48
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,414
- [Man #2] you did all the remodeling
yourself? - [Man #1] mm-hmm.

49
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,617
[Man #2] i'm not much of a handyman myself,
i can hardly change a tire.

50
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,253
[Woman] wow.

51
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,888

53
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,994
and the master bedroom.

54
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:25,631
Is there an attic,
or a basement, or anything?

55
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,965
No.

56
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,501
And you're okay with dogs?

57
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,470
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,905
You mind if we look around
on our own?

59
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,574
No, that's all right.

60
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,014
- So, what do you think?
- I can't breathe in there.

61
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:44,916
Well, it's not like we have to live with
the guy, just hold your breath whenever

62
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,685
he comes to fix
the garbage disposal.

63
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,920
It's like
spoiled mayonnaise.

64
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,522
Ugh!
I feel like it's on me.

65
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,757
It's not that bad.

66
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,425
We're gonna have to hire
an exorcist.

67
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,760
Just relax.

68
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,596
It's a cool house.

69
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,464
Ugh!

70
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,033
[Indistinct chatter]

71
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,567
- oh, my god.
- You got it?

72
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,869
Yeah.

73
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,404
- You guys okay?
- Don't turn it.

74
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,339
[Indistinct chatter]

75
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,847
[birds squeaking]

76
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,616
[woman] you don't buy a pregnant
lady a bottle of champagne

77
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,650
for her house-warming gift.

78
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,985
- It's stupid.
- It's not stupid.

79
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,420
They're gonna be
totally cool with it.

80
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,621
It's not
a house-warming party,

81
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,790
it's just a big
get-together thing.

82
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,391
You gotta go to crate and
barrel every time somebody

83
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,726
moves into a house?
Give me a fucking break.

84
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,894
- [Woman] hey!
- Hey!

85
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:29,961
Hey.

86
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,864
[Woman]
good, really good.

87
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,434
Yeah. I'm not vomiting
every morning

88
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,836
like i was
in the first trimester.

89
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,373
But i've just been nesting,
and i don't know,

90
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,874
i'm-- i'm really excited

91
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,877
- to meet this little person.
- That's great.

92
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,380
That's not to say i don't miss
having a drink sometimes.

93
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,715
[Cork pops]

94
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,683
- shit, i am so sorry.
- Oh, no.

95
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,852
Oh, no.
No. I'm-- i'm sorry.

96
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,988
I-- i didn't think
it would take him this long.

97
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,998
[Man] jesus,
the fucking traffic in this town.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,867
- You need a hand?
- Yeah, you mind?

99
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,869
- The trunk's open.
- No problem.

100
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,704
Thanks, man.

101
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,407
Hey, sorry.
Nightmare of today.

102
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,410
- Three hours?
- I know, it's the traffic.

103
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,078
Getting out of the city
is brutal.

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Paul and audry
got here fine.

105
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,450
Well, i'm the new guy,
i can't be cutting out early like paul.

106
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,821
- Is this swordfish?
- Yeah, it was on sale.

107
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,957
Ryan, i--
i can't eat this.

108
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,058
Why not?

109
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,493
There's mercury
in swordfish.

110
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,927
Claire, it's fine.

111
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,662
My mom smoked a pack a day
when she had me.

112
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,598
A little fish
isn't gonna kill you.

113
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,901
Right.

114
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,003
[Claire] he's just creepy.

115
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,839
Every time i'd look up,
he'd be staring at me.

116
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,409
He wasn't looking in here.
He's just an old man.

117
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,977
He's a creepy old man.

118
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,979
You should have seen him.

119
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:57,416
The way he smelled.
Oh, my god, you could taste it.

120
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,151
You know he's got a key
to your place, right?

121
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,719
Paul.

122
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,821
Jesus, i didn't
even think of that.

123
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,823
What if i'm alone here
and he lets himself in?

124
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,893
He can't come in unless he gives
us a days notice. Calm down.

125
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,562
- We have to change the locks.
- Yep.

126
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,598
We're not changing the locks,
all right? Thanks, pal.

127
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,100
[Paul chuckles]
i don't know, man.

128
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,768
It's definitely not as bad
as the first trimester.

129
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,070
- Yeah?
- Like, i'm not as worried

130
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,173
she's gonna murder me in my sleep.
You know what i mean?

131
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,708
Jesus christ,

132
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,444
i guess that's progress.

133
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,746
Honestly, i'm just trying
to stay focused on work.

134
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,615
You guys
seem good tonight.

135
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,083
We're not fighting.

136
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,586
We're not really
doing anything.

137
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,855
She's got a bunch of shit she wants
to do before the baby comes,

138
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,724
so, i come home,
and i paint rooms,

139
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,860
or look at furniture,

140
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,195
i watch those
house renovation shows

141
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,729
and she tells me
what she likes,

142
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,899
and i smile and nod,
and we don't fight.

143
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,634
It doesn't sound that bad.

144
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,971
She's a great roommate
and that's pretty much it.

145
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,506
Are you guys still
not having sex?

146
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,642
[Chuckles]
take a wild guess.

147
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,478
Maybe she's just scared
you'll poke the baby.

148
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,147
[Chuckles] maybe.

149
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,516
It'll get better.

150
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,152
Why is it always so much better
in the beginning?

151
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,591
Because she hasn't heard
all your shitty jokes yet.

152
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,093
I mean, eventually she's bound to
find out you're not that funny.

153
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,028
- [Chuckles]
- you're not that cool.

154
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,730
If you stop trying so hard,

155
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,565
and she doesn't
have to keep pretending

156
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,133
that she likes
the taste of your dick.

157
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,836
[Chuckling]

158
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,271
you got a good thing, man.

159
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,773
It's just...

160
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,242
different.

161
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,177
[Sighs]

162
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,713
honestly, the thought of it
makes me want to kill myself.

163
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,215
I don't want him to see me naked
for another three months,

164
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,050
- at least.
- [Laughs]

165
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,053
forget getting on all fours,
like i'm a piece of cattle.

166
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,289
You look great.

167
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,024
Ugh. Just a few more months,

168
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,193
and we get to meet
this little guy.

169
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,029
It's all worth it.
Right?

170
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,898
- My ass will never be the same
- mm-mm.

171
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,267
But, uh,
it'll all be worth it.

172
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,036
Your ass wasn't
the same after 28...

173
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,573
let's be honest.

I mean,
it's not new york,

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,656
Ry?

256
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,028

Now?

I don't have a hammer
and nails.

- [Claire] yes, we do.
- Buried in a box somewhere.

has to happen now?

let's just do it now.

Ryan,
you're gonna break it.

What?

00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,174
This is not a closet,
it's stairs.

What?

280
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,679
It says this was
an owner's closet, right?

How about tomorrow?

297
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,530
Well, she's gonna
be gone all day,

298
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,432

Two hours north?

307
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,745
It's not that bad.

308
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,180
- That's pretty bad.
- [Laughs]

309
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,515
it's just like
the one my mom had.

310
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:33,051
It'll be fun,
we can drive up the coast.

311
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,719
It better be the best damn
rocking chair i've ever seen.

Don't be a baby.

313

We can grab lunch
on the way.

I just don't want to leave
baron for too long.

315

after you're done using it?

We were at a club and my

and one of my friends
invited a bunch of girls up,

just hit it off.

to get right to it,

380

- What's wrong?
- Lots of work stuff.

532
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,820
I almost singed my eyebrows off
with this fucking thing.

533
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,488
Huh?

534
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:09,259
What's going on?

539
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,440
[Sighs] my assistant.

540
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,612
What are you fucking kidding me?
Since when?

541
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:32,482
Since i moved out here.

542
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,817
What are you thinking?

543
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,318
I don't know.

544
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,420
It just kind of happened.

545
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,923
I was out here on my own,
and things were bad with claire,

546
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,992
- and it just happened.
- And kept happening?

547
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,394
It's getting out of control.

548
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,829
You've got to tell her.

549
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,330

00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:51,268
I'm trying to fix this,
not throw it away.

551

She came to the house
yesterday.

552
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:54,804
She called
claire's phone.

553
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,640
What?

554
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,576
She's trying
to fuck up my marriage.

555
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,514
You got to break it off.
