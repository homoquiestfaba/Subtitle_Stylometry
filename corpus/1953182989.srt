1
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:48,482
Would it kill you
to call me Mom?

2
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:49,954
Just once?

3
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,906
Would it?

4
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,280
Everyone calls you Patricia.

5
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,071
But you're not everyone,
you're my son.

6
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:56,449
And you're my Patricia.

7
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:20,867
Everyone thinks that I have
a photographic memory.

8
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,637
But that's not really accurate.

9
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,902
I'm more like
a video camera.

10
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,499
I record what I see,

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,605
and, for reasons beyond me,
I always remember.

12
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:40,962
Frankly, I've always found
photographs depressing,

13
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,338
especially the old ones.

14
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,370
That's my mother, Patricia.

15
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:48,575
The product of
an unplanned pregnancy.

16
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:51,514
Patricia was the only girl in
a family of four boys.

17
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:54,654
Five, counting
my Grandpa Stan.

18
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:57,659
My grandmother was pregnant
for 72 months.

19
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:59,740
<i>- Ow!
- Or six years.</i>

20
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:03,359
Just about 1/6th
of her entire life.

21
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:06,910
Uncle Billy was the first born
of six sons.

22
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:09,949
<i>Tim and Tom
came next, then Jimmy,</i>

23
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,089
followed by two baby boys
who died in the uterus.

24
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:15,461
And finally, Patricia...

25
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:17,729
who, by all accounts,
had a very happy childhood.

26
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:18,364
Cheese!

27
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:19,550
<i>- Cheese!
- Cheese!</i>

28
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:23,004
Until her tenth birthday.

29
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:25,314
J' For she's
a jolly good fellow J'

30
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,935
J' For she's a jolly
good fellow J'

31
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:31,651
J' For she's
a jolly good fellow J'

32
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:34,369
J' Which nobody can deny M

33
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:37,471
Happy birthday,
Patricia.

34
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,780
<i>- The candles aren't lit.
- Oh.</i>

35
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,124
Stan.

36
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,335
Stan!

37
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,675
Hand me your lighter.

38
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,677
What lighter?

39
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:48,994
Oh...

40
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:53,922
You mean... this lighter.

41
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:58,822
Boys, if it wasn't
for this lighter...

42
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:01,756
I'd have been shot straight
through the heart

43
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,035
by one of them pinko, Commie,

44
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:09,056
socialist, Karl Marx-loving,
liberal wack jobs,

45
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:12,422
subversive moon bat,
hippie freaks.

46
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:13,796
Uh-huh.

47
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:15,423
But if he
thought he could kill

48
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,179
Stan "The Man" Herman...

49
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:20,801
Kapow, kapow, kapow!

50
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,712
Both: Faggot.

51
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:28,193
Now, one of you boys
gets this when I die,

52
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:29,442
so be careful with it.

53
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:35,906
You got something to
say, Billy?

54
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:39,489
I'm too high to bother with
the likes of you, Stanley.

55
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,674
You son of a--

56
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,395
Give me the goddamn
lighter, now.

57
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,643
<i>Uh, Mommy?</i>

58
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:09,695
Oh.

59
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:12,356
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

60
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:13,538
Oh...

61
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,537
It's almost out.

62
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:16,227
I'll save ya!

63
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,164
<i>- Stop, drop and roll!
- Jesus H. Christ!</i>

64
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:23,464
Stop, drop and roll,
stop, drop and roll,

65
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,977
stop, drop and roll,
stop, drop and roll!

66
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,475
My grandmother's death
was only the beginning.

67
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,500
Woo!

68
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:43,881
I said I'm Starsky,
you're Hutch.

69
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,052
Fine, have it your way.

70
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:49,320
Starsky's
a total homo anyway.

71
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,558
You calling me queer?

72
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:54,626
What if I am...
Starsky?

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,044
Take it back, take it back!

74
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:01,023
<i>- I ain't homo!
- Okay, okay, I take it back!</i>

75
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:02,179
You ain't homo!

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,331
Put down the gun, Tim.

77
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:05,127
Jesus H. Christ!

78
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:08,163
You didn't really think I'd
shoot my own brother, did you?

79
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,566
Ahh!

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,470
Uncle Jimmy died of AIDS.

81
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,548
How he got it,
no one talks about,

82
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,530
which, to me,
makes it even sadder.

83
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:40,133
Since no one ever
talks about him,

84
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:42,506
it's like
Uncle Jimmy was never born.

85
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,926
Happy birthday, Billy.

86
00:05:58,146 --> 00:05:59,139
( Horn honking )

87
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:02,375
Going somewhere?

88
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,388
I'm going up
Canada way.

89
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:05,510
Canada?

90
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:07,304
What for?

91
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:08,485
I'm 18 now.

92
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:09,506
I don't got a choice.

93
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,436
Yes, you do, stay here.

94
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,390
If I stay here
they'll ship me off to 'Nam

95
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:14,696
or they'll lock me up in jail.

96
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,292
Either way you look at it,
I gotta go.

97
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:20,359
But I can't take care
of Stan, not all by myself.

98
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,740
I'm only ten years old.

99
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:26,563
( Horn honking )

100
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,405
You're gonna do
great, Patty.

101
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:31,688
I know you are.

102
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:34,795
Are you stoned?

103
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,473
Stay here with me.

104
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,516
Please, Billy, please!

105
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:42,216
I... I can't.

106
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:56,715
My name's not Patty,
it's Patricia.

107
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:58,505
And you're a coward,
William Herman.

108
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:21,325
You must be the change you
wish to see in this world.

109
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:24,174
E-R-A!

110
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:26,607
I proudly accept

111
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,739
your nomination
for vice president

112
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,880
of the United States.

113
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,064
Anita Hill!

114
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,879
Keep your rosaries
off my ovaries!

115
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,976
Keep your rosaries
off my ovaries!

116
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:41,063
<i>Mommy!</i>

117
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,347
<i>Mommy!</i>

118
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:43,311
<i>Mommy!</i>

119
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:44,784
<i>Mom, Mom, Mom!</i>

120
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:45,776
( screaming )

121
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:46,986
<i>Mommy?</i>

122
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:52,432
Happy birthday, Patricia.

123
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,374
Why is that
woman crying, Mommy?

124
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:02,127
Because God is punishing her for
being Satan's helper, honey.

125
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,463
Baby killers!

126
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,188
Baby killer!

127
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,670
Jesus H. Christ!

128
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:18,733
( Baby crying )

129
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:22,217
Congratulations.

130
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,264
It's a boy.

131
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,640
It's a what?

132
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:30,732
A beautiful,
healthy baby... boy.

133
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,618
But-- but--
but that's impossible!

134
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,625
All the sonograms
said it was a girl!

135
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:37,226
I wallpapered her room pink

136
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:39,272
because it's supposed to be
a girl!

137
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:42,346
A beautiful,
healthy baby-

138
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,967
Henrietta.

139
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:47,180
So beautiful.

140
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,497
- Hello.
- Hello.

141
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,787
So, guys, um...

142
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,226
I'm feeding my grandson
the other day, you know?

143
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,273
Henry.

144
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:14,729
He's like nine months old.

145
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:17,171
These carrots are...

146
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,986
mmm...

147
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,678
delicious!

148
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,429
Tastes like shit!

149
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:29,069
The kid says...

150
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,343
That was funny,
do it again.

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,841
I'm not shitting ya.

152
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:35,283
The kid at nine months old
is speaking.

153
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:38,893
Wait 'til I tell the boys.

154
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,169
My grandson's
a freak genius!

155
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:42,317
No, no, no, no, no, Stan.

156
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,626
You do not say a word
about this to anyone.

157
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:47,725
<i>- Stan... Stan...
- I swear, I swear, I swear.</i>

158
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:50,481
You know, the kid's not
just smart.

159
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:52,076
You can tell,
he's got a good heart.

160
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:53,709
What's a freak, Patricia?

161
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:00,851
A freak is...

162
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:03,219
someone who's
very special.

163
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:05,422
Henry, honey.

164
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:07,152
It makes me feel lucky.

165
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,748
Stop pointing at him.

166
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,812
Aw...

167
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:18,384
I didn't say
nothing to no one.

168
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:22,064
Then what is this?

169
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,784
Now that there is
one photogenic kid.

170
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:28,693
I don't want Henry
to see any of this.

171
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:30,798
This... this... trash.

172
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:32,397
I don't want him to know
anything about it.

173
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,292
You got it.

174
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,009
Now let's go home.

175
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,729
I can't...

176
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:41,654
take care of you
anymore.

177
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,996
I won't.

178
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:48,273
Patricia.

179
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:51,310
I'm a grown man who can
take care of himself!

180
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:53,171
You're a grown man who's never
cooked a meal for himself

181
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:54,766
in his entire life!

182
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,398
Or washed any of his own
underwear

183
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,933
or raised any of his four sons

184
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,414
or made the necessary
arrangements to

185
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:00,821
bury three of them!

186
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:02,098
( Crying )

187
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,378
Oh...

188
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:08,082
Now don't you cry,
Henry, my boy.

189
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,810
Uh...

190
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,768
Your mother's right.

191
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,740
Your Grandpa Stan
being here...

192
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:21,967
Me being here
is best for all of us.

193
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,175
YUP-

194
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:26,800
Best for...

195
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,470
Gotta go, Geronimo!

196
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,007
What?

197
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:45,655
Ahh!

198
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:48,592
I'm okay.

199
00:11:58,894 --> 00:11:59,953
"Y- ".

200
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:01,455
"Y- ".

201
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,872
"Y- ".

202
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:04,213
"Y- ".

203
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:05,874
"Y- ".

204
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,440
"Y- ".

205
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:09,401
"Y- ".

206
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:10,960
"Y- ".

207
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,066
Now, who can tell me

208
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:15,764
one word

209
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,682
that begins
with the letter "Y"?

210
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,126
Henry.

211
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,151
Why?

212
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:25,715
No, no, "Y" is a letter,
not a word.

213
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:28,056
<i>- You're stupid.
- Freak.</i>

214
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:32,279
I mean, "why" as in W-H-Y
are we here learning this crap?

215
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,353
Why?

216
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,564
They suspended you
from kindergarten?

217
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,706
When can I go back to school?

218
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,185
You are not going back
to that institution.

219
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,680
You're gonna
go to a real school.

220
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:45,104
One that nurtures, rather than
punishes the precocious!

221
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:47,218
One that encourages its
students to pursue the truth!

222
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:57,238
( Bell tolling )

223
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,881
Now...

224
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:04,630
whose father hasn't
had an opportunity

225
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:07,547
<i>to address the class, hmm?</i>

226
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,499
How about you, Henry?

227
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:14,289
My father sends his sincere
apologies, Sister Hathaway,

228
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,502
but he's currently
away saving the world.

229
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,515
So, in his absence,
I present to you--

230
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:20,343
Oh, my God.

231
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,971
Who is it?

232
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:24,149
Wonder Woman?

233
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,497
Must be the Invisible Man

234
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:28,248
'cause we all know you ain't
got no daddy.

235
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:29,843
All: Ooh...

236
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,884
Well...

237
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,812
at least I'm not adopted,
Malcolm.

238
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:36,885
Who says I was adopted?!

239
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:41,114
Unless your father suffers
from vitiligo universalis...

240
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,075
I do.

241
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:45,624
Vitig...

242
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,635
What?

243
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:50,709
The Michael Jackson disease.

244
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,953
I am not adopted.

245
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,101
Am I, Daddy?

246
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,279
Look in the mirror, kid.

247
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,205
You're black.

248
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,927
Who made Black History Month
the month of February?

249
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,208
The shortest
month of the year?

250
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:06,358
The white devil.

251
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:07,924
That's right, son.

252
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:11,510
The lying white devil!

253
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,370
You got a problem
with that?

254
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:15,739
I'm not saying all you
people look alike--

255
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,628
Who-- who all?
Me all?

256
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:18,937
Oh, you're talking
about my people?

257
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,689
You got something you
wanna say about my people?

258
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:23,416
Don't I know you?

259
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:26,803
I do not associate with
the filthy flesh of swine, pig!

260
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:31,350
Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight,

261
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:34,555
fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight,

262
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:36,444
fight, fight, fight, fight...

263
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:38,485
It's about Rodney--
Rodney King!

264
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,046
Rodney King, Rodney King!

265
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:42,908
Rodney King!

266
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,558
"Open your eyes, people,

267
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,761
"for you have been blinded from
the truth long enough.

268
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:01,947
"There is no Easter Bunny,

269
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:05,211
"no Tooth Fairy...

270
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:06,709
"no Santa Claus.

271
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,384
There is no devil."

272
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:16,536
And there is no God?

273
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,332
No!

274
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,538
They're lies!

275
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:22,746
Lies that exist because
man has fooled himself

276
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:24,988
into believing
that he can see the truth!

277
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,813
"When in reality,
man cannot see

278
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,749
that the hand
before his face is his own."

279
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,373
You don't believe in God?

280
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:37,725
I have my doubts.

281
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:39,035
Then why are you here?

282
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:40,566
Why are any of
us here?

283
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,884
What is
the purpose of our being?

284
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:46,492
I'm talking about here,
at this Catholic school.

285
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,856
Ms. Herman, surely you don't
condone your son's beliefs?

286
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,597
I believe my son is capable
of drawing his own conclusions.

287
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,421
You work in a cafeteria,
do you not?

288
00:15:55,477 --> 00:15:57,496
I manage
a dormitory dining hall,

289
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:58,682
at the university,

290
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,891
not that I can see
how that's at all relevant.

291
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,520
Then tell me, Ms. Herman,

292
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:06,816
how would you feel if your
son's misplaced, misguided

293
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,394
heretic beliefs caused a riot
in your dining hall?

294
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:14,849
There is too a God,
you freak!

295
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,209
"A" pluses across the board.

296
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:27,006
And that man wants either
a public apology

297
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:28,416
or an expulsion?

298
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,376
Is that even a choice?

299
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,719
We choose expulsion.

300
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,412
We choose to
fight against the tyranny.

301
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:33,464
We choose to fight
against it.

302
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,230
Who's my father, Patricia?

303
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,649
Who's my father?

304
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:47,778
Who your father is
isn't important.

305
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,217
You have me,

306
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:51,650
a mother who loves you
more than life itself.

307
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:54,169
But everyone else has a father.

308
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,032
Why do you want to
be like everyone else?

309
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:57,473
You're not like
everyone else.

310
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,361
<i>- You're very special.
- You mean I'm a freak.</i>

311
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,110
<i>- You're not a freak.
- You said so yourself.</i>

312
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:05,147
A freak is someone who's
very special.

313
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,497
I don't remember saying that.

314
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:09,792
I do, I remember.

315
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:11,037
I remember everything.

316
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:15,608
And that is an amazing gift.

317
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:19,033
You are an amazing young man
blessed with an amazing gift.

318
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:20,766
Or cursed.

319
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,878
Happy birthday,
Henry, honey.

320
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,606
This is from Grandpa Stan.

321
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:02,237
Ahh!

322
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,078
Damn it!

323
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:18,619
Where you going,
Henry, honey?

324
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:20,101
Stan's.

325
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:23,266
That's a great idea, let's all
go celebrate together.

326
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:24,928
Shall we?

327
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:40,513
Buenas tardes, Enfermera Bruna.

328
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:43,811
In Brazil. we speak Portuguese,
not Spanish, idiot.

329
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:52,764
In the US of
we speak English,

330
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:56,581
mi gatita atractiva.

331
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:11,654
I gave her an eight.

332
00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:15,653
I never knew you
spoke Spanish.

333
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:19,134
Well, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

334
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:23,070
Then again, there's a lot you
don't know about you.

335
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:26,559
Since when did you
start speaking Spanish?

336
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,691
Everyone that works here is
from south of the border.

337
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,287
Being here as long as I have,

338
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,590
you get used to
the lingo.

339
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:38,820
Besides, they like it
when you talk Mexican to them.

340
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:25,322
I get my money back if this
don't work, right?

341
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:30,729
Stan.

342
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,026
Stan.

343
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:37,994
Thank you, Stan.

344
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:35,205
I appreciate you not
pressing charges, Stewart.

345
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:40,266
Didn't mean to make you look bad
in front of your kid.

346
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,051
But I knew
I knew you.

347
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:45,420
You know that...

348
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:48,554
would barely be noticeable
if you were really black.

349
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,437
I am really black.

350
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:52,877
This ain't
gonna bounce, is it?

351
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:56,107
You have my word, it's good.

352
00:22:56,164 --> 00:22:58,597
White devil's forked tongue
is a lying tongue.

353
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,719
Gotta go, Geronimo.

354
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,253
What, what,
where you going?

355
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:03,270
We're "negoci-tating."

356
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:05,766
I'm gonna see what
I can find out for you.

357
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:07,181
If the check clears.

358
00:23:08,612 --> 00:23:11,755
But if I do happen to
found somehow,

359
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:14,245
I didn't
find it out... you dig?

360
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:18,253
I do dig.

361
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:14,540
Lesbo, lesbo, lesbo, lesbo,

362
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,255
<i>- lesbo, lesbo, lesbo, lesbo...
- Hey, lesbo.</i>

363
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:24,519
lesbo, lesbo, lesbo, lesbo,
lesbo, lesbo, lesbo...

364
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:47,311
I hate you.

365
00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:49,385
I hate you.

366
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,662
I hate you!

367
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:54,317
I... hate... you!

368
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:11,246
<i>There are many people
who believe</i>

369
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:12,746
<i>that what you
did to your daughter</i>

370
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:14,477
<i>constitutes child abuse.</i>

371
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,449
<i>I've tried to raise
my daughter</i>

372
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:23,628
<i>free from gender bias,</i>

373
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,943
<i>free from the...</i>

374
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,590
...stereotypes

375
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:32,435
that dehumanize people.

376
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:40,594
<i>Would you like a tissue,
Dr. O'Hara?</i>

377
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:42,286
<i>No, no.</i>

378
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:43,633
No-- yes.

379
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,224
Is that it,
is that all of them?

380
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,811
Encontraste.

381
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:11,633
Encontraste.

382
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,261
Encontrar.

383
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,788
Aste, aste.

384
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,810
Tu.

385
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,446
You.

386
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:19,565
You found.

387
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,568
May I have that book?

388
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:27,414
You found my...

389
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,158
Jesus H. Christ.

390
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,172
May I have that book?

391
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,466
I'm done.

392
00:26:40,523 --> 00:26:43,884
You've really read
this whole thing?

393
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:47,189
I can record what I see
or read.

394
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:48,335
And I always remember.

395
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:50,316
Always?

396
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,522
The parental-manipulation
theory.

397
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,534
Posits that by selecting either
heterosexual

398
00:26:55,596 --> 00:26:58,738
or homosexual practices
as the acceptable norm,

399
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:00,214
parents can promote to their
offspring

400
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:01,905
a specific
passage of sexuality.

401
00:27:05,004 --> 00:27:06,903
Page two, second paragraph.

402
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:20,440
"Among other disorders,

403
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:22,446
the test subject
suffers from..."

404
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,625
"An acute sense of unexplained
dinophobia.

405
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,242
A fear of dizziness that often
results in nausea and vomiting."

406
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:29,589
<i>Page 142--</i>

407
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:32,624
<i>- Paragraph four.
- Third paragraph.</i>

408
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,387
The paragraph
at the top of page 142

409
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,694
is carried over from
the previous page.

410
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,332
Slavkin O'Hara.

411
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:49,047
Henry James Herman.

412
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:54,772
What are you doing?

413
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,714
Can you help me take out
the trash, Henry?

414
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:22,034
Here we are.

415
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:23,601
Home sweet home.

416
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:34,966
Henry?

417
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:37,272
Is your daughter home?

418
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:38,485
Uh...

419
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:42,165
Audrey's... in school.

420
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:43,128
Speaking of which,

421
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:45,300
shouldn't you be
in school as well?

422
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,542
I got expelled.

423
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,073
Expelled?
For what?

424
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:52,273
Heresy.

425
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,048
If a bullet is fired straight up
into the sky,

426
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:03,124
it will slow down, stop,

427
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:04,689
then fall to
earth again--

428
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:06,705
accelerating until it reaches
a point

429
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,561
where its weight equals
the resistance of the air.

430
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,530
Brian.

431
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:21,585
I didn't do nothing.

432
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:23,995
Get your butt to
the principal's office.

433
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:25,075
Immediately!

434
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:26,294
What's the problem
with you people?

435
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:27,510
Oh, really?

436
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,652
And what might be that problem
be with my people?

437
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:31,578
Unlike where
you come from, Ms. Abda.

438
00:29:31,632 --> 00:29:32,854
I was born here, Brian.

439
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,827
Real Americans believe in
innocence until proven guilty

440
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:38,322
and you have no proof that
I did anything wrong.

441
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:45,080
<i>- Audrey?
- Yes, Ms. Abda?</i>

442
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:45,913
( coughing )

443
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:47,323
Lesbo.

444
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:48,796
I am not a lesbo!

445
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:01,173
Are you okay?

446
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:04,093
Today's no worse than the living
hell that is my daily existence.

447
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:32,188
Fire.

448
00:30:32,243 --> 00:30:33,531
Fire, I need fire.

449
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:48,181
Feel better now,
Dr. O'Hara?

450
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:52,215
No.

451
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:53,497
Not really.

452
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:02,165
Why were you
a sperm donor?

453
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:06,649
Excuse me?

454
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:08,793
You wrote in your book
that you donated sperm.

455
00:31:08,853 --> 00:31:10,206
Why?

456
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:16,885
I didn't know
what else to do with it?

457
00:31:16,948 --> 00:31:20,309
So I checked off the box.

458
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:23,231
It was a precautionary
measure.

459
00:31:23,285 --> 00:31:25,631
A precaution against what?

460
00:31:25,685 --> 00:31:28,283
I have testicular cancer?

461
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:29,978
Yes.

462
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:34,140
Cancer of the...
testicles.

463
00:31:34,198 --> 00:31:36,446
Tell me, Dr. O'Hara.

464
00:31:36,502 --> 00:31:39,894
Do you and...

465
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:43,264
Alice plan on having
any more children?

466
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:49,341
Yes, Mrs. O'Hara
and I certainly do.

467
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:53,982
Then may I suggest you seriously
consider sperm banking.

468
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,642
Sperm banking?

469
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:58,681
I myself am
a sperm donor.

470
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,543
Did you have testicular cancer?

471
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:03,899
Thank God, no.

472
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,693
No, no, no.

473
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:11,457
Some people donate blood,
I donate semen’s.

474
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,627
Why?

475
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:15,291
Not?

476
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,376
These are release form.

477
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,003
Pretty standard stuff
really, no biggie.

478
00:32:23,062 --> 00:32:25,790
Now should your
fertility be unaffected

479
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:27,714
by the chemotherapy,

480
00:32:27,768 --> 00:32:32,383
then all of your sperms shall be
properly disposed of.

481
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:36,510
Unless...

482
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,236
Unless?

483
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:42,715
You consent to have it donated
by checking off that box.

484
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:44,696
Little box at the bottom.

485
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,586
Little teeny box.

486
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,554
The process is
completely anonymous

487
00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:54,685
and you will be monetarily
compensated.

488
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:58,400
Money's not the issue.

489
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:00,507
Then consider it a means of
fulfilling

490
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:03,361
your biological imperative.

491
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,664
I can only imagine
the profound love

492
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,226
pouring out of a mother's heart

493
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:11,325
when she first embraces
her newborn child.

494
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:14,243
A JOY that you...

495
00:33:14,297 --> 00:33:18,171
you have made possible.

496
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:19,585
Alice.

497
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,263
I know, I know, Gunter,
I know, I'm late.

498
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,813
It's been almost an hour.

499
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:28,226
Honey?

500
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:29,885
You look positively
radiant.

501
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:33,503
You are too kind, Gunter.

502
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:34,499
Now then.

503
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,842
What's all this about?

504
00:33:40,122 --> 00:33:41,541
You...

505
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:44,060
you didn't start
without me, did you?

506
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,907
God, Slavkin, I left work
early to be here.

507
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:51,519
That is so like you
to be totally selfish.

508
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:53,694
I took your last name.

509
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,805
<i>- Remember?
- Alice Stravinowsky?</i>

510
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:01,091
What would people think?

511
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:02,564
That we're married.

512
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:03,840
Well.

513
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,941
I may have lost my wife
to my oncologist,

514
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:13,315
but my fish can still swim.

515
00:34:15,194 --> 00:34:19,875
At least I still
have my health.

516
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,572
Which is a lot more than I can
say for Dr. Flowers.

517
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:25,989
What happened to Dr. Flowers?

518
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:31,616
The Bulls won a championship.

519
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:34,338
<i>And the Bulls win
the championship.</i>

520
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:37,253
<i>Chicago is going crazy tonight.</i>

521
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:38,944
<i>Hundreds have been arrested
as fireworks</i>

522
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:42,844
<i>and random gunfire
explode throughout the city.</i>

523
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:44,861
Gunter!

524
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:47,488
Gunter!

525
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:49,981
Don't pretend like you don't
hear me, Gunter!

526
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,812
Yes, honey.

527
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:53,406
Yes, Henry?

528
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,625
Huh?

529
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:56,157
You look like you have
something you want to say.

530
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,272
Oh, it's-- it's nothing.

531
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:07,268
So, now that you find yourself

532
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:10,467
to be a man without
a school...

533
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:11,997
what are your plans?

534
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,501
My plans?

535
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:15,649
To continue your education.

536
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,510
Patricia and I haven't
really talked about that.

537
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:21,568
Who's Patricia?

538
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:23,135
My mother.

539
00:35:23,197 --> 00:35:24,997
You call your mother
by her first name?

540
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:27,846
What does Audrey call you?

541
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:30,596
My daughter
calls me names.

542
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:32,159
Bad ones mostly.

543
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:37,154
Always actually.

544
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:39,810
Local news covering
the greater Chicago-land area.

545
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,303
<i>The Windy City is about to get
a whole lot windier</i>

546
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:43,620
<i>as the city braces itself-</i>

547
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:45,925
I want to go to college.

548
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:49,540
<i>Stay tuned for "Storm Watch,"
every hour, with our mega...</i>

549
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:57,153
Children your age
don't go to college.

550
00:35:57,213 --> 00:36:00,225
When you were ten, you took
care of the entire family.

551
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:01,540
I didn't have a choice.

552
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:03,070
But I do, Patricia.

553
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,117
Okay, listen to me,
Henry, honey.

554
00:36:06,174 --> 00:36:08,041
I see what happens to
boys and girls twice your age

555
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:09,862
who leave home and go off
to college.

556
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:10,945
Credit card debt.

557
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:12,905
Credit card debt
is the root of all evil.

558
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,913
But I don't want to
go away to college.

559
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:17,703
I want to stay right here at
home and go to the university.

560
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,363
Do you have a better plan
for my future?

561
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:20,644
Patricia.

562
00:36:20,702 --> 00:36:21,826
Patricia.

563
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:23,622
You're smothering me,
Patricia.

564
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,862
I know I am, I know.

565
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,718
It's what mothers do.

566
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:32,070
Just promise me you won't
grow up too fast, okay?

567
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:33,928
You'll only break
your mother's heart.

568
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,042
I promise.

569
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:39,362
So...

570
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:41,159
anything else
you want to tell me?

571
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:42,122
Anything at all?

572
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:49,001
As a rule, Patricia, the Spanish
"H" is always silent.

573
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:51,882
Fill all
corresponding bubbles...

574
00:36:51,936 --> 00:36:54,435
completely.

575
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:56,363
Erase all stray marks...

576
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,665
completely.

577
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,009
You have 30 minutes...

578
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:03,906
to answer 30 questions
completely.

579
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:05,354
Are there any questions?

580
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:08,551
You may begin.

581
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,042
May I help you?

582
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:46,635
Not with...

583
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,781
28 minutes left.

584
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:48,715
Impossible.

585
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,571
Come back
when you really are done.

586
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,647
I'm done.

587
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:58,790
The university usually
frowns upon

588
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:01,828
admitting students
so young in age.

589
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,178
However, given Henry's
unprecedented test scores,

590
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,360
we're willing to offer a full
academic scholarship

591
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,989
with an annual
stipend of 12,000,

592
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,363
all terms nonnegotiable.

593
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:14,951
Let me be perfectly clear,
President Sullivan.

594
00:38:15,011 --> 00:38:19,211
Without my consent,
Henry doesn't go to college.

595
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:20,588
20,000.

596
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:21,833
My son is not
for sale.

597
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:23,430
30,000.

598
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:26,507
100,000.

599
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:27,523
<i>- 50.
- 80.</i>

600
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:28,874
<i>- 60.
- 75,000 a year</i>

601
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,372
for the length of
Henry's matriculation.

602
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,559
Nonnegotiable.

603
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,020
It's a deal, Ms. Herman.

604
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,942
Henry's stipend must be invested
in the following manner.

605
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:40,138
I suggest you
write this down.

606
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:42,095
Proceed.

607
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:43,980
With Henry
as sole beneficiary,

608
00:38:44,036 --> 00:38:45,869
50% of his stipend will be
invested

609
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,495
in blue chip mutual funds.

610
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:49,640
The remaining 50%
in US Treasury notes.

611
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:52,165
On his 18th birthday,
Henry alone will be entitled

612
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:54,955
to the entirety of
both accounts.

613
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:56,201
Do we have a deal?

614
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,413
Uncle.

615
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,542
We can leave now,
Henry, honey.

616
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:19,557
Henry?

617
00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:22,696
Honey?

618
00:39:26,404 --> 00:39:27,823
Henry?

619
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:30,022
Henry!

620
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:32,427
Henry!

621
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:33,479
Henry!

622
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,112
Henry!

623
00:39:35,174 --> 00:39:38,000
Don't walk away from me while
I'm talking to you.

624
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:39,113
Henry.

625
00:39:39,174 --> 00:39:41,194
Henry James Herman,
you stop right there!

626
00:39:45,734 --> 00:39:47,600
Did you beat him?

627
00:39:47,654 --> 00:39:50,284
Did you out-negotiate
President Sullivan?

628
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:51,401
Yes, I did.

629
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:53,644
Well, congratulations,
Patricia.

630
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:55,437
I don't
appreciate your sarcasm.

631
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,448
I don't appreciate being used.

632
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:59,856
I don't want a stipend,
I don't need the money.

633
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,231
Not right now you don't,

634
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:03,535
but you'll thank me
when you turn 18.

635
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,839
I did this for you,
Henry, honey.

636
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:08,524
You did it
for yourself, Patricia!

637
00:40:08,582 --> 00:40:12,172
How dare you raise your voice
at me-- I am your mother.

638
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,413
Without me, your genius butt
wouldn't be alive.

639
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:16,140
Well, if I am a genius,

640
00:40:16,198 --> 00:40:18,283
I can assure you I didn't
inherit my genius gene

641
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:21,420
from you, now, did I?

642
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:23,378
Well, if not me,
then who?

643
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:26,631
Him.

644
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:30,858
<i>- Him?
- Me?</i>

645
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,208
Egg, meet Sperm.

646
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,452
Sperm, my mother.

647
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,016
Patricia Herman.

648
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,807
Dr. O'Hara just happens to be
my biological father.

649
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:45,265
- You?
- Me?

650
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,240
Oh, my God.

651
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,428
I think I'm gonna...

652
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:56,528
I'm sorry, Henry, could you
repeat what you just said?

653
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:02,441
The part where I said that
you're my biological father?

654
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:03,726
Yeah, that's it.

655
00:41:03,784 --> 00:41:06,993
That's what
I thought you said.

656
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,710
I'm your father.

657
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,820
How so exactly?

658
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:13,103
I'm a test-tube baby.

659
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,561
Oh.

660
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:17,295
Oh...

661
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:23,345
<i>- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?</i>

662
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:25,834
Just imagining Audrey's reaction
to the news.

663
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:28,177
Well, you're
taking it rather well.

664
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:32,521
Oh, I'd probably faint too if
I wasn't so heavily medicated.

665
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:34,539
After our book-burning incident,

666
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:37,002
my psychiatrist
upped my dosage.

667
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:38,768
Now I don't
feel much of anything.

668
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:45,266
( Bell ringing )

669
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,632
Lesbo, lesbO, lesbO, lesbo,
lesbo, lesbo, lesbo...

670
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:02,958
( horn honking )

671
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:08,974
( screaming )

672
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:21,622
I'll be right back.

673
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:24,107
I'd like to Audrey myself,
if you don't mind.

674
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,670
Oh, I don't
think that's such a...

675
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,542
Audrey?

676
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:52,852
Yeah, that's me.

677
00:42:52,908 --> 00:42:54,807
Who are you?

678
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:56,050
You're not alone, Audrey.

679
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:57,331
Not anymore.

680
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:59,058
Lesbo.

681
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:04,656
I'm your half...

682
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:11,244
Brother.

683
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:12,563
Ew!

684
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,381
Who is that kissing my Henry?

685
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:18,099
That would be my
Audrey.

686
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:19,412
I tried telling you.

687
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:20,757
But then you kissed me!

688
00:43:20,813 --> 00:43:24,239
I can't hear you, I can't
hear you, I can't hear you.

689
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:27,313
I've never been kissed before by
a woman who wasn't Patricia.

690
00:43:27,373 --> 00:43:29,556
She doesn't use
her tongue like you do.

691
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:31,666
Oh, I'm so gonna puke.

692
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,295
Hey, Who's hungry'?

693
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,791
Anyone?

694
00:43:57,422 --> 00:43:58,710
Anyone?

695
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,416
I'm starving.

696
00:44:05,231 --> 00:44:07,096
I've never been
here before.

697
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,104
That's because
the faculty club's off-limits

698
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,640
to people like us.

699
00:44:10,703 --> 00:44:12,340
You mean poor people.

700
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,581
I mean proletariat.

701
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:16,854
President Sullivan did

702
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:19,858
rename it the Libertarian Club

703
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:23,377
in an attempt to make it
more inclusive.

704
00:44:23,438 --> 00:44:25,338
Now anyone can come here?

705
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,744
- No.
- No.

706
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:28,785
Well, then, why did he bother
changing the name?

707
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,880
Why did Kentucky Fried Chicken
change its name to KFC?

708
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:35,344
Did they suddenly
stop frying their chicken?

709
00:44:35,408 --> 00:44:36,564
No.

710
00:44:36,624 --> 00:44:38,774
They most certainly did not.

711
00:44:38,832 --> 00:44:42,225
In their defense, they did add
baked chicken to their menu.

712
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:43,827
It was grilled.

713
00:44:46,577 --> 00:44:48,343
If it wasn't for
this university,

714
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:52,688
then this entire area would be
an economic wasteland.

715
00:44:52,752 --> 00:44:54,291
Would it not?

716
00:44:54,352 --> 00:44:55,771
And that justifies this
university's

717
00:44:55,825 --> 00:45:00,025
refusal to pay its
workers a decent living wage?

718
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,881
Well, I'm just playing
devil's advocate, Ms. Herman.

719
00:45:04,945 --> 00:45:06,810
How can you play
the devil's advocate

720
00:45:06,864 --> 00:45:08,981
when you are the devil,
Dr. O'Hara?

721
00:45:16,368 --> 00:45:17,361
What?

722
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,378
My daughter
hates you, Henry.

723
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,307
But don't be offended.

724
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:22,931
Audrey hates everyone.

725
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:24,498
What a terrible thing to say
about your daughter.

726
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:26,645
You did just say that
I was the devil, did you not?

727
00:45:26,706 --> 00:45:27,797
It's true.

728
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,658
I do hate everyone.

729
00:45:29,714 --> 00:45:31,034
Everyone but babbling babies

730
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:33,719
and retards
soaked in their own drool.

731
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:36,408
I believe the clinical term

732
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:38,899
is intellectually disabled.

733
00:45:38,962 --> 00:45:41,940
So it's better to be disabled
than retarded.

734
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:44,729
To the intellectually
disabled, yes, it is better.

735
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:46,324
I'm so out of here.

736
00:45:46,386 --> 00:45:47,641
Sit down, Audrey.

737
00:45:47,698 --> 00:45:51,833
Am I the only one here who's not
in, like, total denial?

738
00:45:54,226 --> 00:45:56,375
Totally messed up?

739
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:58,420
Open your eyes, people!

740
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:00,764
For you've been blinded by
the truth long enough.

741
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,281
What did you say?

742
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,099
<i>- Nothing.
- Whatever.</i>

743
00:46:07,154 --> 00:46:08,408
Audrey's right.

744
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,812
<i>- This is an awkward situation.
- You think?</i>

745
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:12,056
When my Grandpa Stan told me--

746
00:46:12,115 --> 00:46:14,330
Don't you dare mention that
man's name ever again.

747
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:15,958
He is dead to me now.

748
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:17,938
Dead.

749
00:46:18,003 --> 00:46:20,982
When my grandfather told me that
he'd found my half-sister,

750
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:23,323
we both assumed
that she was just like me.

751
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:24,700
A test-tube baby.

752
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:26,261
It was a petri dish.

753
00:46:26,324 --> 00:46:27,961
But then when Dr. O'Hara told me
that Audrey

754
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,615
was already conceived before
he was diagnosed with cancer-

755
00:46:30,674 --> 00:46:32,409
You had cancer?

756
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:33,907
It was a long time ago.

757
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:35,771
You never told me
you had cancer.

758
00:46:35,828 --> 00:46:37,945
I've been
cancer-free for over a decade.

759
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,542
But it could still
come back, right?

760
00:46:39,603 --> 00:46:41,338
I'm sorry to disappoint you yet
again, Audrey,

761
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:44,669
but I hope not.

762
00:46:44,724 --> 00:46:48,564
<i>- You're not a test-tube baby.
- It was a petri dish!</i>

763
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:50,428
You are my half-sister.

764
00:46:50,484 --> 00:46:52,284
One-half of our genes are
identical,

765
00:46:52,341 --> 00:46:54,207
and since we have
different mothers,

766
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:56,540
our common genes could have only
come from one source.

767
00:47:02,772 --> 00:47:04,790
Unless...

768
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:07,351
Unless what?

769
00:47:07,413 --> 00:47:08,886
No matter what happens,
Audrey,

770
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:10,553
you will always be my daughter,

771
00:47:10,613 --> 00:47:13,177
just as I will
always be your father.

772
00:47:13,236 --> 00:47:15,037
No matter what.

773
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:17,407
If you've got something to say,
then just say it, Dad.

774
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:21,852
There's a chance,

775
00:47:21,908 --> 00:47:25,499
a very slim chance,

776
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:30,107
infinitesimal really, when you
come to think of it,

777
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:32,795
that you may...

778
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:39,611
Well, that you
may not be my daughter,

779
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:41,950
biologically speaking.

780
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:44,156
You look positively
radiant.

781
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:45,720
You are too kind, Gunter.

782
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:49,850
Since when?

783
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,514
Since you were born.

784
00:47:51,574 --> 00:47:53,113
I mean since when did you
realize

785
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:54,713
that you may not be my father?

786
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,904
Uh...

787
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:01,182
Since before
you were born.

788
00:48:01,238 --> 00:48:02,843
You were never
gonna tell me.

789
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:03,993
Were you?

790
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,456
Infinitesimal, remember?

791
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:09,247
If I'm not your daughter,
then who's my father?

792
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,558
I'm your father.

793
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:11,707
I am.

794
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,196
Maybe.

795
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:27,577
Audrey.

796
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,018
Audrey, honey.

797
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:32,385
Look at the bright side.

798
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,070
I am looking
at the bright side.

799
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,441
The chance that you
may not be my father.

800
00:48:37,496 --> 00:48:39,294
However infinitesimal
that may be.

801
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,118
Sorry.

802
00:48:53,176 --> 00:48:55,074
I'm not the one you should be
apologizing to.

803
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:02,271
I know who you are.

804
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:04,990
I read your book.

805
00:49:05,047 --> 00:49:07,645
I tried to
raise my daughter

806
00:49:07,704 --> 00:49:11,394
free from gender bias,
free from stereotypes

807
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,249
that dehumanize people.

808
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,083
How do you sleep at night?

809
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:20,451
Ambien.

810
00:49:20,505 --> 00:49:22,720
You got no idea how much
trouble you caused me, do you?

811
00:49:22,777 --> 00:49:25,090
You know, you're the reason my
son thinks he's adopted.

812
00:49:25,146 --> 00:49:26,849
What is it
with you, home wrecker?

813
00:49:26,906 --> 00:49:28,412
His son is adopted.

814
00:49:28,474 --> 00:49:29,564
So what if he is?

815
00:49:29,624 --> 00:49:31,327
Does that somehow make me
any less of a father?

816
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,502
<i>- Yes.
- No.</i>

817
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:34,554
Come here.

818
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:36,188
Come here, white devil,
you come here.

819
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:40,606
I know I wasn't
born black, okay?

820
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:42,171
I know that.

821
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:45,028
But I know
that I am black.

822
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,435
Here.

823
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:48,094
I'm black right here.

824
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:52,476
And that's the same way that
I know that Malcolm is my son.

825
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:55,134
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

826
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:57,955
I know that it must totally
suck to be a black man nurse

827
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,930
trapped in a white man's body,

828
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:02,428
but the white devil and I have
our own paternity problems

829
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,159
to deal with.

830
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:06,783
I need my
stepfather's sperm.

831
00:50:06,842 --> 00:50:08,675
The what, with the...

832
00:50:08,731 --> 00:50:10,630
No, look, whatever weirdness
y'all got going on,

833
00:50:10,683 --> 00:50:12,482
I don't know
and I don't want to know.

834
00:50:12,538 --> 00:50:13,793
I need to find out
if Gunter Flowers

835
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:15,489
is my biological father.

836
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:16,966
Me too.

837
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:18,689
No one cares about you,
home wrecker.

838
00:50:18,748 --> 00:50:19,741
I got an idea.

839
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:21,701
Why don't you two
just go and ask him?

840
00:50:21,754 --> 00:50:24,417
<i>- Because he's dead.
- Because he's dead.</i>

841
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:25,795
He's dead?

842
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:27,619
<i>- Dead.
- Dead.</i>

843
00:50:27,996 --> 00:50:29,501
<i>And the Bulls win
the championship.</i>

844
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,191
Gunter!

845
00:50:32,251 --> 00:50:34,751
Don't pretend like
you don't hear me, Gunter.

846
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:36,165
Yes, honey.

847
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,620
The trash isn't
going to take out itself.

848
00:50:38,683 --> 00:50:40,550
<i>As fireworks
and rare gunfire</i>

849
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:42,590
<i>explode throughout the city.</i>

850
00:50:42,653 --> 00:50:44,323
Yes, I am completely aware

851
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,627
that trash
is an inanimate object.

852
00:50:55,003 --> 00:50:56,575
Gunter!

853
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,830
Gunter!

854
00:51:03,036 --> 00:51:04,455
Gunter!

855
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:07,296
Gunter!

856
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:10,085
Gentle Jesus,
please make it stop.

857
00:51:10,142 --> 00:51:12,323
Gunter!

858
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,366
For the love of God,
Alice!

859
00:51:14,429 --> 00:51:16,862
Will you just shut it up?!

860
00:51:16,924 --> 00:51:19,457
If a bullet is fired straight up
into the sky,

861
00:51:19,517 --> 00:51:20,673
it will slow down,

862
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:38,310
Well, if y'all wanna find out
who your daddy is,

863
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:39,686
I suggest you get tested,

864
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:41,127
'cause as decreed by
the Supreme Court,

865
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,168
ain't nothing I can do for you
without your dead

866
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,951
step daddy’s permission.

867
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:48,544
I see my work here
is done.

868
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,828
Y'all have a good night.

869
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,561
If this hurts, I will--

870
00:51:54,622 --> 00:51:55,527
Faint.

871
00:51:55,582 --> 00:51:57,219
I think it's
a blood-sugar thing.

872
00:51:57,279 --> 00:51:58,272
So...

873
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,589
Prick me
and get it over with.

874
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:07,367
This totally sucks.

875
00:52:07,422 --> 00:52:09,703
As if my life isn't
miserable enough.

876
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,934
It turns out that my real dad
may be my dead step-dad.

877
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:14,759
I'm your real dad.

878
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:16,735
Maybe.

879
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:18,948
If my step-dad is my real dad,

880
00:52:19,008 --> 00:52:21,440
that makes him
your real dad as well.

881
00:52:21,503 --> 00:52:24,264
Which makes you my half-brother.

882
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,761
But the problem is,

883
00:52:25,824 --> 00:52:28,616
we don't know
who our real dad is, do we?

884
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:31,530
It's called process of
elimination.

885
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:34,279
It's called
a rhetorical question.

886
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:37,128
We just have to wait for
the test results.

887
00:52:37,183 --> 00:52:40,392
What are we
supposed to do until then?

888
00:52:40,447 --> 00:52:44,735
We could exhume Dr. Flower's
body and perform an autopsy.

889
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:46,916
Well, what are we waiting for?

890
00:52:46,976 --> 00:52:48,842
Let's get some
shovels and start digging.

891
00:53:37,218 --> 00:53:38,440
I didn't do nothing.

892
00:53:38,498 --> 00:53:40,517
"I didn't do nothing"
is a double negative.

893
00:53:40,578 --> 00:53:43,622
Which means you did
do something, idiot.

894
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:45,798
Prove it, lesbo.

895
00:53:45,857 --> 00:53:48,258
Hey, hey, hey. hey!

896
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:52,131
Ms. Abda, Ms. Abda,
Ms. Abda!

897
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:57,385
Do you have
a question, Brian?

898
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,435
No?

899
00:53:58,499 --> 00:53:59,787
Then let's move on, shall we?

900
00:54:11,298 --> 00:54:12,902
Ms. Abda?

901
00:54:12,962 --> 00:54:14,315
Yes, Audrey?

902
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:16,074
May I go to the restroom?

903
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:17,124
It's an emergency.

904
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,376
The period's almost over.

905
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:19,788
Not for me, it isn't.

906
00:54:19,842 --> 00:54:21,316
Oh?

907
00:54:22,307 --> 00:54:23,463
Go.

908
00:54:35,077 --> 00:54:37,061
I should
so kick your ass.

909
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:38,563
You have every right to be
mad at me.

910
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:39,881
Oh, yeah?

911
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,577
I'm sorry for
the trouble I've caused you.

912
00:54:41,636 --> 00:54:43,916
<i>- You're weak.
- I'm ten.</i>

913
00:54:43,971 --> 00:54:45,772
Aren't you supposed to be in
college or something?

914
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:47,847
Aren't you
supposed to be in school?

915
00:54:47,908 --> 00:54:49,447
I can't stand it when people
answer a question

916
00:54:49,508 --> 00:54:50,763
with a question.

917
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,068
Then, yes,
I'm supposed to be in college.

918
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,023
Then what are you doing here?

919
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:57,576
I wanted to know
if you're okay.

920
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,079
Let's get one thing straight.

921
00:55:04,132 --> 00:55:07,657
I will never,
ever be okay.

922
00:55:07,717 --> 00:55:08,972
Okay?

923
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:11,593
I'm permanently damaged.

924
00:55:11,653 --> 00:55:14,031
A freak,
just like you.

925
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,425
Don't sweat it.

926
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,733
I think being a freak's
kinda cool.

927
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,980
Yeah?

928
00:55:24,038 --> 00:55:26,286
Better than being a sheep
like all the rest of them.

929
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,523
Why would anyone want to be
just like everyone?

930
00:55:30,149 --> 00:55:32,583
What's in your hair?

931
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:33,900
It's nothing.

932
00:55:43,078 --> 00:55:44,496
Every ditch school before?

933
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,641
No.

934
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:50,127
Where are you going?

935
00:55:50,182 --> 00:55:51,503
Anger-obics.

936
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,709
Holy "Beautiful Mind."

937
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:25,357
Unlike Henry,
my memory is, uh...

938
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,728
very average.

939
00:56:27,783 --> 00:56:31,505
I have to write down my thoughts
in order to remember them.

940
00:56:33,288 --> 00:56:35,241
On Post-it notes.

941
00:56:35,303 --> 00:56:37,387
Well, you can stick them
just about everywhere

942
00:56:37,448 --> 00:56:40,656
and they
stay stuck until you...

943
00:56:40,712 --> 00:56:41,672
move them.

944
00:56:41,737 --> 00:56:43,273
Have you heard about that
Post-it note

945
00:56:43,335 --> 00:56:45,484
that survived
Hurricane Hugo?

946
00:56:45,543 --> 00:56:48,075
140-mile-an-hour winds.

947
00:56:48,135 --> 00:56:50,831
Knocked out eight oak trees
in a man's front yard,

948
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:53,682
but the Post-it note

949
00:56:53,735 --> 00:56:57,358
stuck on his front door
withstood the storm.

950
00:56:57,417 --> 00:57:00,275
What did
the Post-it note note?

951
00:57:00,328 --> 00:57:03,275
I don't know that it
noted anything.

952
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:08,465
The point is
that it stayed stuck.

953
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,689
Well, what's the point of
posting a blank Post-it note?

954
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:14,250
I never said it was blank.

955
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:21,036
Did it say "please knock"
or "no solicitations" or...

956
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,628
Manifesto on
the nature of truth?

957
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,825
Results indicate
test subject's IQ 310.

958
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:37,427
Test subject?

959
00:57:37,481 --> 00:57:39,053
Well, I... Henry has

960
00:57:39,113 --> 00:57:41,613
the second-highest
IQ ever recorded.

961
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:44,369
My Henry is not a test subject!

962
00:57:46,441 --> 00:57:48,908
Please,
sit down, Ms. Herman.

963
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,053
<i>- Please.
- Jesus H. Christ.</i>

964
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:54,225
I brought you here to
prove to you

965
00:57:54,282 --> 00:57:55,406
that I have nothing,

966
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:56,591
<i>- nothing to hide.
- How?</i>

967
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,604
By shoving your
notes in my face?

968
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:01,230
Notes you intend to use to write
a book about my son?

969
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,512
The test subject!

970
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,523
Yes!

971
00:58:04,586 --> 00:58:06,453
No, no, no.

972
00:58:06,506 --> 00:58:08,557
No-- yes!

973
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,670
My original intention was to
write a book about Henry,

974
00:58:10,731 --> 00:58:12,237
but that was
before yesterday.

975
00:58:12,299 --> 00:58:14,034
<i>- Before I found out the truth.
- The truth?</i>

976
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,307
The truth that
Henry may be my son.

977
00:58:18,379 --> 00:58:20,016
Henry is my son.

978
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:21,265
I'm his mother!

979
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:23,310
And as for you,
you're nothing but a test tube

980
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:24,911
filled with sperm!

981
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:29,104
If someone other than you had
written that book about Audrey,

982
00:58:29,163 --> 00:58:30,517
what would you do?

983
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:35,764
I know exactly
what I'd do.

984
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,048
If you ever change your mind

985
00:58:40,108 --> 00:58:44,527
and write
a book about my Henry...

986
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:47,251
I will hunt you down

987
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:49,426
and I will kill you.

988
00:58:58,637 --> 00:58:59,924
It was a petri dish.

989
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,228
You were the test tube,
I was the petri dish!

990
00:59:12,493 --> 00:59:13,814
Stop calling me, Stan!

991
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:15,190
Now is not
a good time-

992
00:59:20,845 --> 00:59:23,345
I've never been to
an amusement park before.

993
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:24,693
Let's go on a ride.

994
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:26,354
I don't do rides.

995
00:59:26,413 --> 00:59:27,952
Exposure therapy
is the best way to get over

996
00:59:28,013 --> 00:59:30,196
an acute sense of dinophobia.

997
00:59:30,254 --> 00:59:31,989
I'm not scared of
being dizzy.

998
00:59:32,046 --> 00:59:33,551
That's not what
I read in your dad's book.

999
00:59:36,398 --> 00:59:37,390
Whoa.

1000
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,248
There's nobody here.

1001
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:47,346
We ditched school,
remember, genius?

1002
00:59:47,406 --> 00:59:48,629
Let's go on a ride!

1003
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,096
Jesus H. Christ.

1004
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,504
What does the "H"
in "Jesus H. Christ"

1005
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:01,780
stand for anyway?

1006
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,377
I don't know, "holy," maybe?

1007
01:00:03,439 --> 01:00:05,359
<i>Your guess is
as good as mine.</i>

1008
01:00:05,423 --> 01:00:08,303
<i>- I thought you knew everything.
- I remember everything.</i>

1009
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:09,490
Everything?

1010
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,383
Everything I've ever seen.

1011
01:00:11,439 --> 01:00:14,517
<i>- Since when?
- Since I was born.</i>

1012
01:00:14,575 --> 01:00:16,407
Ew.

1013
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,000
( Screaming )

1014
01:00:39,728 --> 01:00:41,080
<i>That was awesome.</i>

1015
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,673
(bell dinging)

1016
01:00:53,937 --> 01:00:55,475
( screaming )

1017
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:16,692
Sit down.

1018
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,349
( Screaming )

1019
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,676
Woo-hoo!

1020
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,788
Yes!

1021
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:58,332
That's me.

1022
01:01:58,386 --> 01:01:59,859
I own this game.

1023
01:01:59,922 --> 01:02:01,843
This is anger-obics?

1024
01:02:01,907 --> 01:02:04,123
What did you expect,
Tae Bo?

1025
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,132
Amusement parks, I get,
but I can't believe you've never

1026
01:02:06,195 --> 01:02:07,962
played an arcade game before.

1027
01:02:08,019 --> 01:02:09,274
Patricia
believes in video games

1028
01:02:09,331 --> 01:02:11,732
are the reason over 4 million
children take Ritalin.

1029
01:02:15,474 --> 01:02:18,421
Hello, I said
shoulder width apart.

1030
01:02:18,482 --> 01:02:20,861
Right foot slightly in front of
your left hand.

1031
01:02:20,915 --> 01:02:22,617
Your other left.

1032
01:02:22,675 --> 01:02:25,075
More, more.

1033
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:26,710
Stop.

1034
01:02:26,771 --> 01:02:28,277
Now keep your left elbow
straight.

1035
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,316
You ready?

1036
01:02:36,372 --> 01:02:37,431
See it.

1037
01:02:37,492 --> 01:02:38,332
Shoot it.

1038
01:02:47,284 --> 01:02:48,701
You suck.

1039
01:02:50,452 --> 01:02:53,595
Watch and learn
from a master marks-woman.

1040
01:02:53,652 --> 01:02:54,776
See it.

1041
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:55,863
Shoot it.

1042
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:16,181
How many did I kill?

1043
01:03:18,645 --> 01:03:21,046
Everyone.

1044
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,509
You killed everyone.

1045
01:03:23,573 --> 01:03:25,472
Well, I noticed the bad guys
are programmed according

1046
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:27,773
to a pretty simple
recursive equation

1047
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:30,209
that determines their
appearance on the screen.

1048
01:03:30,262 --> 01:03:32,509
Do you want to know the equation
so you can finish the game too?

1049
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,998
What can we get
for 10,000 tickets?

1050
01:04:04,438 --> 01:04:06,970
10,000 tickets doesn't
buy much.

1051
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:08,897
That's funny.

1052
01:04:11,063 --> 01:04:12,667
Go on, take it.

1053
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:14,680
It's yours.

1054
01:04:14,742 --> 01:04:15,997
What do you say?

1055
01:04:16,055 --> 01:04:17,180
Thank you.

1056
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:18,560
You're welcome.

1057
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,195
That was nice of you.

1058
01:04:23,254 --> 01:04:25,404
Tell anybody
and I will kill you.

1059
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:26,521
Got it.

1060
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:32,033
You have to look at things
in the long-term.

1061
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:34,303
In the short-term,
my life totally sucks.

1062
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:36,192
But it'll all blow over.

1063
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:37,405
Oprah or no Oprah,

1064
01:04:37,464 --> 01:04:40,225
they'll all forget that
stupid book ever existed.

1065
01:04:40,279 --> 01:04:41,884
Just look at Jonathan Franzen.

1066
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,265
Who?

1067
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,241
My point exactly.

1068
01:04:45,305 --> 01:04:47,586
Besides, all the cash my dad's
making from the book

1069
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:49,659
is going into a trust fund.

1070
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,284
When I turn 18,
I'm gonna be rich.

1071
01:04:52,345 --> 01:04:53,883
Me.

1072
01:04:53,944 --> 01:04:55,483
Not you.

1073
01:04:55,544 --> 01:04:57,497
Not we.

1074
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,165
Me.

1075
01:04:59,224 --> 01:05:02,651
But I don't
want any of your money.

1076
01:05:02,713 --> 01:05:04,415
Yeah, right.

1077
01:05:04,473 --> 01:05:05,563
I don't.

1078
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:07,611
When I turn 18,
I'll have my own money.

1079
01:05:07,673 --> 01:05:10,368
<i>- You wanna bet?
- On what?</i>

1080
01:05:10,425 --> 01:05:12,444
I'll bet you that you that my
dad's not our dad.

1081
01:05:12,505 --> 01:05:15,515
So I'm betting
that your dad is my dad?

1082
01:05:15,577 --> 01:05:16,668
You're a genius?

1083
01:05:16,729 --> 01:05:17,788
Really?

1084
01:05:17,849 --> 01:05:19,682
I never said
I was a genius.

1085
01:05:19,737 --> 01:05:22,715
And I never said
I'm a lesbo.

1086
01:05:22,777 --> 01:05:24,643
Bet.

1087
01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:28,539
I can't wait for you to meet my
Grandpa Stan.

1088
01:05:28,602 --> 01:05:31,329
You know, if it wasn't for him,
we would have never met.

1089
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,608
I can wait to thank him.

1090
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:39,169
Places like this depress me.

1091
01:05:39,225 --> 01:05:40,644
Why?

1092
01:05:40,697 --> 01:05:42,530
Is this it?

1093
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:44,702
Is this where we end up?

1094
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:49,792
Surrounded by old people who
reek of mothballs and menthol?

1095
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:51,487
All of us just waiting to die?

1096
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:52,987
Not my Grandpa Stan.

1097
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:55,070
He reeks of
cigarettes and whiskey.

1098
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:56,669
Cool.

1099
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,563
Hey, everyone.

1100
01:05:58,619 --> 01:05:59,808
Where's Stan?

1101
01:06:02,683 --> 01:06:04,548
Nurse Bruna?

1102
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:05,726
Where's my grandfather?

1103
01:06:11,323 --> 01:06:12,828
Stan?

1104
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:15,422
Stan?

1105
01:06:15,483 --> 01:06:18,048
Stan!

1106
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,297
Stan!

1107
01:06:22,587 --> 01:06:23,613
Henry, honey.

1108
01:06:26,012 --> 01:06:28,642
Patricia... where's Stan?

1109
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:31,781
Come here, honey.

1110
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,739
Please, Henry.

1111
01:06:36,796 --> 01:06:37,887
Please.

1112
01:06:42,492 --> 01:06:44,130
Where's Grandpa Stan?

1113
01:06:45,532 --> 01:06:48,064
I'm sorry, Henry, honey.

1114
01:06:48,124 --> 01:06:51,333
I'm so sorry.

1115
01:06:51,388 --> 01:06:53,189
Where is he, Mom?

1116
01:06:53,245 --> 01:06:54,435
Where is he?

1117
01:06:57,116 --> 01:06:58,370
Why aren't you in school?

1118
01:07:33,693 --> 01:07:35,232
( Thundering )

1119
01:07:57,086 --> 01:08:00,295
74 Nobel Laureates over
the course of this university's

1120
01:08:00,351 --> 01:08:02,086
illustrious history.

1121
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:04,259
But never once has a tenured
faculty member

1122
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:06,665
appeared on Oprah.

1123
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:09,546
Oh, any publicity
is good publicity.

1124
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,498
I'm sure things will go much
better next time

1125
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:12,739
you're on Oprah.

1126
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:15,112
Peddling your new book.

1127
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:19,073
There isn't going to be
another book, Charles.

1128
01:08:19,135 --> 01:08:21,961
With all the funding
being poured into your work?

1129
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:25,573
Henry... isn't my work.

1130
01:08:25,631 --> 01:08:27,170
No?

1131
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:29,764
Then what is he?

1132
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,242
<i>- He's--
- He's here</i>

1133
01:08:31,295 --> 01:08:33,129
because you
wanted him to be here.

1134
01:08:33,184 --> 01:08:36,971
He's here because we're paying
him a lot of money to be here.

1135
01:08:37,025 --> 01:08:38,693
He's here because of you.

1136
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,354
You're right, Charles.

1137
01:08:45,408 --> 01:08:48,005
Henry is here...

1138
01:08:48,064 --> 01:08:49,056
because of me.

1139
01:08:51,808 --> 01:08:53,063
I understand that now.

1140
01:08:55,712 --> 01:08:56,869
Thank you, Charles.

1141
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:58,217
Oh, please, Slavkin.

1142
01:08:58,272 --> 01:08:59,626
There's no need to
thank me.

1143
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:01,187
My job is to manage.

1144
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:03,167
Your job is to
publish.

1145
01:09:03,232 --> 01:09:04,552
Or perish.

1146
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:06,660
Well, then you're just gonna
have to fire me, Charles.

1147
01:09:09,889 --> 01:09:11,078
Oh, wait a minute.

1148
01:09:11,138 --> 01:09:14,465
That's right,
you can't fire me.

1149
01:09:14,528 --> 01:09:16,002
I have tenure.

1150
01:09:52,515 --> 01:09:54,500
Am I going to
beat the odds?

1151
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:56,940
Henry?

1152
01:09:56,994 --> 01:09:58,565
The transition from
prodigy to adult

1153
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:00,743
is an extremely difficult one.

1154
01:10:00,803 --> 01:10:03,465
Only one in a 100 prodigies
succeed in becoming happy,

1155
01:10:03,522 --> 01:10:05,901
well-adjusted adults.

1156
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,035
10,004 Post-it notes
of research.

1157
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:16,747
Surely, you must have
arrived to some conclusion.

1158
01:10:16,804 --> 01:10:19,183
Am I gonna be that
one in a hundred?

1159
01:10:19,236 --> 01:10:23,523
You are a very...
special person.

1160
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:25,126
I know what that means.

1161
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:28,133
Someone of your...

1162
01:10:28,195 --> 01:10:32,550
extraordinary intellect
comes along...

1163
01:10:32,612 --> 01:10:35,623
maybe once in
a century, if at all.

1164
01:10:35,684 --> 01:10:37,483
I don't want to be
extraordinary.

1165
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,651
But extraordinary
is exactly what you are.

1166
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:42,695
I don't want to be the test
subject of your next book!

1167
01:10:42,757 --> 01:10:45,189
You're not, Henry,
you know?

1168
01:10:45,251 --> 01:10:47,532
I promise you,
despite what you see,

1169
01:10:47,588 --> 01:10:48,810
you're not.

1170
01:10:48,868 --> 01:10:50,309
All my eyes can see
is all I know.

1171
01:10:52,645 --> 01:10:54,696
I'm not writing
a book about you.

1172
01:10:56,676 --> 01:10:58,597
I thought I was,
but I'm not,

1173
01:10:58,661 --> 01:11:03,527
so you can
forget about all of this.

1174
01:11:03,588 --> 01:11:05,673
All of what you see.

1175
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:07,119
I can't forget.

1176
01:11:15,877 --> 01:11:17,132
This arrived in the mail.

1177
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,786
It's addressed to me,
but made out to you.

1178
01:11:19,845 --> 01:11:21,515
Thought you might be
interested in the results.

1179
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:33,840
Where you going?

1180
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:37,419
To help my mom
plan a funeral.

1181
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:49,739
Ahh!

1182
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:57,741
Ahh!

1183
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:07,564
( Crying )

1184
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:34,859
Billy?

1185
01:15:04,429 --> 01:15:06,578
Who is he?

1186
01:15:06,637 --> 01:15:07,958
I think he's my uncle.

1187
01:15:13,197 --> 01:15:14,670
Are you my Uncle Billy?

1188
01:15:18,093 --> 01:15:19,566
If you're my nephew.

1189
01:15:23,758 --> 01:15:25,712
This used to be my room.

1190
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:28,272
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1191
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:31,193
Four walls
and some left-over beads.

1192
01:15:32,398 --> 01:15:35,027
It's been 35 years.

1193
01:15:35,085 --> 01:15:36,504
Why didn't you come back

1194
01:15:36,558 --> 01:15:38,741
when President Carter granted
amnesty to the draft dodgers?

1195
01:15:38,798 --> 01:15:41,297
Back in '77?

1196
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:42,581
Well, I guess I thought
I'd have time

1197
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:46,031
to make amends.

1198
01:15:46,094 --> 01:15:47,218
<i>Guess that was wrong.</i>

1199
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:48,632
You think?

1200
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:00,718
Stan wanted you
to have this.

1201
01:16:00,782 --> 01:16:02,103
Is that a fact?

1202
01:16:03,343 --> 01:16:04,784
He told me so himself.

1203
01:16:06,223 --> 01:16:08,090
He wanted to pass it down to
one of his sons.

1204
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:22,743
You're his grandson.

1205
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,241
So you keep that.

1206
01:16:32,464 --> 01:16:35,377
The Vietnam War was one that
I, William Herman, opposed.

1207
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,787
Due to my moral principles.

1208
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,957
I do, however, sincerely
regret that in my absence

1209
01:16:40,017 --> 01:16:41,206
that I've missed a great
many things.

1210
01:16:41,265 --> 01:16:43,096
I have missed being a brother to
my brothers,

1211
01:16:43,151 --> 01:16:44,373
who have all since perished.

1212
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:46,352
I have missed
being a friend

1213
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:48,981
to the strongest person
I've ever known...

1214
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,189
my sister.

1215
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:54,292
I've missed
being Uncle Billy to...

1216
01:16:57,649 --> 01:16:59,831
He's a remarkable young man.

1217
01:16:59,889 --> 01:17:02,322
But I missed most of all...

1218
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:03,673
being a son.

1219
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:10,325
Of all my regrets,
my single greatest is knowing

1220
01:17:10,385 --> 01:17:13,463
that I'll never have the
opportunity to tell my father

1221
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:14,875
how much I miss him.

1222
01:17:17,617 --> 01:17:19,156
How much I loved him.

1223
01:17:23,858 --> 01:17:26,290
I hate you, Billy Herman.

1224
01:17:26,354 --> 01:17:27,991
I hate you so much.

1225
01:17:42,226 --> 01:17:43,994
Mothballs and menthol.

1226
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:46,812
You don't have to pretend like
you want to be here.

1227
01:17:46,866 --> 01:17:50,675
I could pretend to be polite,
courteous and communicative.

1228
01:17:50,738 --> 01:17:52,375
But I'm not.

1229
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:53,624
I'm a teenager.

1230
01:17:53,683 --> 01:17:55,385
You're 12.

1231
01:17:55,443 --> 01:17:56,796
I'll be 13 in a week.

1232
01:17:56,851 --> 01:17:59,349
$0'?

1233
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:01,462
So I could
pretend to be happy,

1234
01:18:01,522 --> 01:18:04,534
pretending that
you don't exist.

1235
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:06,133
But I wouldn't be happy

1236
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,748
After all,
you are my brother.

1237
01:18:15,412 --> 01:18:18,205
It's such a relief knowing
that Gunter's not our dad.

1238
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,246
He was such a tool.

1239
01:18:20,308 --> 01:18:21,781
You saw
the lab report?

1240
01:18:23,188 --> 01:18:24,757
That means
you lost the bet.

1241
01:18:24,819 --> 01:18:25,976
That means I won.

1242
01:18:34,772 --> 01:18:37,118
Dad loved you
most of all.

1243
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:38,678
Yeah, right.

1244
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,279
I was an accident.

1245
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:42,075
It was an accident
I was ever born.

1246
01:18:42,132 --> 01:18:44,762
Dad always wanted a girl.

1247
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,774
After four boys in a row,
he finally got one.

1248
01:18:48,917 --> 01:18:50,236
You.

1249
01:18:56,309 --> 01:19:00,281
After he...

1250
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:01,814
told Henry the truth,

1251
01:19:01,877 --> 01:19:03,416
I...

1252
01:19:05,558 --> 01:19:07,128
I wished he was dead.

1253
01:19:12,854 --> 01:19:14,621
Well, at least now you know.

1254
01:19:14,678 --> 01:19:15,931
That I wasn't an accident?

1255
01:19:15,988 --> 01:19:17,527
No, you'd better be
careful what you wish for.

1256
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,951
Cool.

1257
01:19:48,662 --> 01:19:49,720
<i>Mom?</i>

1258
01:19:51,478 --> 01:19:52,832
<i>Mom?</i>

1259
01:19:52,886 --> 01:19:54,327
Yes, Henry, honey?

1260
01:19:54,391 --> 01:19:55,864
Who's this?

1261
01:20:03,191 --> 01:20:05,091
That's your Uncle Jimmy.

1262
01:20:05,143 --> 01:20:06,615
No, I mean that.

1263
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:10,907
That's you, Henry, honey.

1264
01:20:13,495 --> 01:20:16,474
But I don't remember ever
meeting Uncle Jimmy.

1265
01:20:16,535 --> 01:20:18,587
How could you?

1266
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,863
You were less than
a week old.

1267
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,753
And you were sound asleep.

1268
01:20:25,463 --> 01:20:27,897
That was the day I told Jimmy
I named you after him.

1269
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:35,137
Henry James Herman.

1270
01:20:37,592 --> 01:20:39,425
<i>I was named after
my Uncle Jimmy.</i>

1271
01:20:43,352 --> 01:20:46,179
A week later,
you were at his funeral.

1272
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:47,618
Do you remember that?

1273
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,036
Yeah.

1274
01:20:53,561 --> 01:20:54,947
Me too.

1275
01:20:59,512 --> 01:21:01,312
Why don't we put this...

1276
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,281
back where it belongs.

1277
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:38,208
Every book
should have a title.

1278
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:42,757
Well, it could,
couldn't it?

1279
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,447
I don't think so.

1280
01:21:44,507 --> 01:21:46,209
You said it yourself.

1281
01:21:46,267 --> 01:21:48,666
<i>My guess is
as good as yours.</i>

1282
01:21:48,729 --> 01:21:51,873
It's highly improbably that
the "H" stands for Henry.

1283
01:21:53,755 --> 01:21:57,825
Let's say that
you could go back in time.

1284
01:21:57,882 --> 01:22:00,163
Would you still publish
that book?

1285
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:02,980
So many unintentional

1286
01:22:03,035 --> 01:22:04,868
great things

1287
01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:06,843
came to be
because of that book.

1288
01:22:06,906 --> 01:22:08,161
Just answer
the question, Dad.

1289
01:22:12,252 --> 01:22:13,758
Yes.

1290
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:15,804
I most certainly...

1291
01:22:15,866 --> 01:22:18,180
would not.

1292
01:22:20,988 --> 01:22:22,558
No.

1293
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:24,768
I would not publish
that book.

1294
01:22:29,532 --> 01:22:31,234
You can't change the past.

1295
01:22:31,292 --> 01:22:32,710
But you can
change the future.

1296
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:35,137
Henry's right.

1297
01:22:36,476 --> 01:22:38,593
Today is my birthday.

1298
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:40,670
And now that
I'm an adult...

1299
01:22:40,731 --> 01:22:42,685
I feel that a I have
a moral obligation

1300
01:22:42,748 --> 01:22:45,247
to help make
the world a better place.

1301
01:22:45,309 --> 01:22:46,400
You do?

1302
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:48,548
You'?

1303
01:22:48,604 --> 01:22:50,917
You, me.

1304
01:22:50,972 --> 01:22:53,635
We should all be the change
we wish to see in this world.

1305
01:22:53,693 --> 01:22:55,112
Shouldn't we, Henry?

1306
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:56,769
We should try.

1307
01:22:59,133 --> 01:23:01,828
That is why after much
thought and deliberation,

1308
01:23:01,885 --> 01:23:03,522
I, Audrey O'Hara,

1309
01:23:03,582 --> 01:23:05,697
on my 18th birthday,

1310
01:23:05,756 --> 01:23:09,762
will donate 20% of my trust fund
to the following organizations.

1311
01:23:12,573 --> 01:23:13,381
Okay, fine.

1312
01:23:13,438 --> 01:23:15,718
Make that 25%.

1313
01:23:15,773 --> 01:23:18,469
33 1/3%
and that's final.

1314
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:21,699
I suggest you write
this down, Dad.

1315
01:23:21,758 --> 01:23:23,110
Uh...

1316
01:23:25,246 --> 01:23:26,206
Right.

1317
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:31,108
Don't seem to have a pen.

1318
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,231
Thank you, Henry.

1319
01:23:41,341 --> 01:23:42,727
Proceed.

1320
01:23:42,782 --> 01:23:44,223
The National Organization
for Women.

1321
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:48,518
The Environmental Defense Fund.

1322
01:23:52,223 --> 01:23:54,755
The National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force.

1323
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:07,142
My name is
Audrey Stravinowsky

1324
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,585
and I am a lesbian.

1325
01:24:14,111 --> 01:24:16,938
Patricia was right.

1326
01:24:16,992 --> 01:24:19,043
When I turned 18,

1327
01:24:19,104 --> 01:24:21,634
I did thank
her for the money.

1328
01:24:21,695 --> 01:24:23,812
The annual stipend that she
negotiated for me

1329
01:24:23,871 --> 01:24:25,770
when I was ten
was more than enough.

1330
01:24:28,991 --> 01:24:30,758
A donation in
Stan's name was made

1331
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,217
to the National Law Enforcement
Memorial Fund.

1332
01:24:41,761 --> 01:24:44,675
The rest was donated to
the AIDS Research Alliance

1333
01:24:44,737 --> 01:24:47,083
to ensure that the memory
of my Uncle Jimmy

1334
01:24:47,137 --> 01:24:48,805
would never again fade away.

1335
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,540
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

1336
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,074
We have a birthday
to celebrate.

1337
01:24:55,137 --> 01:24:56,227
J' For she's
a jolly good fellow J'

1338
01:24:56,288 --> 01:24:58,088
J' For she's a jolly
good fellow J'

1339
01:24:58,144 --> 01:25:01,189
J' For she's
a jolly good fellow J'

1340
01:25:01,249 --> 01:25:03,715
<i>- J' That nobody can deny M
- J' And so say I M</i>

1341
01:25:07,521 --> 01:25:08,613
The candles aren't lit.

1342
01:25:08,673 --> 01:25:10,441
Oh, right.

1343
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:14,725
Henry, honey,
hand me your lighter.

1344
01:25:14,784 --> 01:25:15,811
I can light
the candles, Mom.

1345
01:25:15,873 --> 01:25:17,543
I can do this.

1346
01:25:17,601 --> 01:25:19,401
I will do this.

1347
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:42,086
Thank you, Dr. O'Hara.

1348
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:46,285
You're welcome...
Ms. Herman.

1349
01:25:46,339 --> 01:25:48,205
And please
call me Slavkin.

1350
01:25:50,946 --> 01:25:52,551
Slavkin Stravinowsky.
