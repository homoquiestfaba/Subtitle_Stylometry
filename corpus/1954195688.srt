1
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:16,097
- Go.
- Beverly Hills.

2
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:19,463
This place sucks.

3
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:22,504
You think it sucks now?
You should have seen it before the quake.

4
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:32,164
Is that your contact?

5
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:36,551
- Damn it. Copy.
- This is Hammond.

6
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,104
What the hell are you doing in the Zone?
No, don't answer that.

7
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,728
You got some action coming your way.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,473
Yeah, what kind of action?

9
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:43,970
It's Dext Muldoon.

10
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,224
You want to take me now or later.

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,457
He's in around the dispensary.

12
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:52,181
We manage to track his vehicle.
We'll be there in 2 minutes.

13
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:53,643
Be where?

14
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,549
Aye, this guy is just right
where you're standing.

15
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:05,552
Go!

16
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:34,915
- Go after Dext!
- Copy.

17
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:02,835
Central is a quarantine boundary.

18
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:05,369
Gimme the melard.
Give the overwrite code.

19
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,895
Shut it down.

20
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:13,975
Got it.

21
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:25,651
Huh, huh, huh, huh.

22
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:26,816
What's so funny asshole?

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,876
You're dead.

24
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:53,075
How many of you officers
have been in this zone before?

25
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:59,469
That's what I thought.
Rookies.

26
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:02,646
Yeah, it's about time the rookies
busted good cherries in this zone.

27
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:05,502
Except for you Hammond,
you don't have a cherry.

28
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:10,259
We're heading into Level 3.
So I have Level 3 protection.

29
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,090
We have counters and breathers on standby.
I don't think we'll be needing em.

30
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:15,401
Why are they radioactive?

31
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,855
Well the quake took out 3 local
power stations. Fusion reactors.

32
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,166
Fortunately there wasn't a full meltdown.
But they did release some of the bad stuff.

33
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:23,639
Who the hell would want to live there?

34
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:27,080
Do the math.
It's like Club Med for criminals.

35
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:29,428
Some of the people there
don't have a choice.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,287
Entering the dead zone, Sir.

37
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:35,484
When we hit the ground,
the target is Dexts Muldoon.

38
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:38,412
The locals consider him to
be some kind of Che Guevara.

39
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:41,388
Do not be fooled.
Take him out.

40
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,117
You take out a one-fifth
of the drug trading zone.

41
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,219
Two minutes landing, Sir.

42
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,423
Let's buck it up.

43
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:14,505
Check the cameras.
Jones, you're good.

44
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:16,329
Poschek, good.

45
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,871
Jackson, good.

46
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,300
Hammond!  Hammond,
you're not transmitting.

47
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,778
Need another, Sarge.

48
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,463
Little easier to transmit
and I've got a camera, Sarge.

49
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:33,682
Right.
Hammond you're good.

50
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:38,106
- Looks like we got company.
- Really small fry though.

51
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,295
We'll take care of them.

52
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:44,140
Gentlemen, start your countdown.

53
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,428
- Yes sir. This is it.
- Let's go.

54
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:13,122
Too exposed.
We're going through.

55
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:44,555
What's wrong with her?

56
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,276
She's got ..ginmars..
Radiation poisoning.

57
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,007
Stay too long in the zone,
it can get pretty nasty.

58
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,405
You already had all your kids, right?

59
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,490
<i>Jones</i>

60
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:00,526
- That ain't him.
- Keep moving.

61
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:02,850
That is not our objective.

62
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:06,276
Woh, woh, woh, woh.
Back up.

63
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:10,169
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

64
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:15,852
Uh, uh, go on sit down, big fella.
We ain't here for you.

65
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:19,470
You wouldn't have set up your command
centre a few blocks away if you were.

66
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,878
Think we didn't see you.

67
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:26,910
Look, we don't care about your business,
alright.  We just want safe passage.

68
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:29,674
You have no authority here.

69
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,105
- What do you want?
- Come again.

70
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:37,846
You need anything?
Medical supplies?

71
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,102
If there's something from the outside world
that you need, I can get it delivered to you.

72
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,393
- Mills?
- You copy me sir.

73
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:47,556
Good.

74
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:50,117
So if you need anything,
have one of your man

75
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,081
contact Sergeant Mills down
at the Command Centre.

76
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:56,250
And if it's something we
can get, he'll get it for you.

77
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,923
You have my word.

78
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,903
All we ask, is to
pass through quietly.

79
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:03,226
And what if I don't agree?

80
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,220
- Dammit Hammond! Nicoles call for backup.
- Yes sir.

81
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:11,073
What if what I want
isn't actually legal?

82
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:12,970
Go on.

83
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:16,182
Something from your
evidence room, perhaps.

84
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,588
Come on man.
Do we look like crooked cops to you?

85
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:22,010
Don't answer that.

86
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:28,080
Iodine tablets, liquid form too. Cypro,
scotch two cases, hypodermic needles,

87
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,582
entry cases of Mexican, Coca Cola.

88
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:35,158
- The kind with the real sugar?
- Huh, huh, huh.

89
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:37,409
I can't get my hands on that ...
I mean we can't ...

90
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:39,481
That was my joke.

91
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,104
- Mills you got that?
- Got it!

92
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,275
Sir, you still need that backup?

93
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:49,913
Yeah, they're not
even in the building yet.

94
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:52,411
- We got a deal.
- Good.

95
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,461
Freeze!

96
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:46,030
Alright, let's papparazi that bitch.

97
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,196
Muldoon, this is the police.

98
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,389
We know you're in there and
we have the place surrounded.

99
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:25,682
- Mills, see anything?
- Yeah, an ........ woman.

100
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:28,282
Searching.

101
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,245
Over there!

102
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,004
Damn it Jones.
Report!

103
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,637
Police.
See your hands.

104
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,356
I want you to come out.

105
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,053
Come on. Let's go.
Move, move, move, move.

106
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:54,333
Out.
Move.

107
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,638
I'd like to do it all, baby.
Remember that.

108
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,677
Oh shit!.

109
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:31,909
Hammond's gone lone wolf again.

110
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,878
Damn it.
You gotta wait for back up.

111
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:07,710
You called for back up.

112
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:20,263
Thank you.

113
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:43,345
You're dead.

114
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:51,498
How the hell did you ...?
Doesn't matter.

115
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:54,539
You have 2 dead cops on your hands.
Do you really want that?

116
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,603
You're in no position to negotiate.

117
00:13:58,486 --> 00:14:00,338
Who said this is a negotiation.

118
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,707
Put down your weapon.

119
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:09,874
What you gonna do?
You gonna blow both of us up?

120
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,256
Dexts Muldoon, you are under arrest.

121
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:16,224
You come any closer
and I'll blow his brains out.

122
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,692
Sir, your handheld has been
approved for destruction.

123
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,939
This is not negotiable.
Put down your weapon.

124
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:25,019
- Who the hell is this guy?
- I have no idea.

125
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:28,337
You have 3 choices.
Surrender and live.

126
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,330
Shoot Sergeant Hammond and die.

127
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:33,033
Shoot me and die.
Make a choice.

128
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:35,756
Fuck you!

129
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,034
Marks, Jackson on me!

130
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:56,420
Now, what the hell was that?

131
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:59,257
Did you not see me
pointing the gun at him?

132
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:01,485
What were you doing?
You almost killed me.

133
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,397
Negative. 

134
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:06,814
There is a 73% probability that this
individual would had terminated you

135
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,104
if I had not interceded.

136
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:10,479
Interceding.
You call that interceding.

137
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:13,119
If I had not interjected you would
have been destroyed, Sergeant Hammond.

138
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:18,153
Oh, would I.  Ok.  Let's see how you like
a grenade blowing up over your head.

139
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:25,381
He had this on him.
He had a concealed weapon.

140
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:34,210
Did anybody frisk him?
God damn it.

141
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:47,419
- You scanned him, right?
- I followed all operational procedures.

142
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:49,460
Yeah, but you followed them loosely.

143
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:52,036
Would you like to file
a complaint, Sergeant?

144
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,796
Well, if it is in the form of
punch you in the face, then, yeah.

145
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:56,788
I would advise against it.

146
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:59,480
Yeah, I bet you would Mr. Roboto.

147
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,378
One more thing.
Who sent you?

148
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:05,439
I received a request for back up.
I provided back up.

149
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,867
- What the hell was that?
- Our future.

150
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:20,068
Well, the professionals finally
showed up. How about that?

151
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,857
- Oh, you're in this. Over here.
- Thank you.

152
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,608
- Hey, that's not for you.
- The hell it ain't.

153
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:30,748
- I made a deal.
- Well, sometimes life ain't always fair.

154
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,435
Tell me we're not in
the wrong run of business.

155
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:35,487
It's not just wrong.

156
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:47,313
Chief! Chief!
I'd like to report an incident.

157
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:49,542
Hammond.
I heard all about it.

158
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,814
No, I'm not talking about the suspect.
I'm talking about that supercop.

159
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:55,471
- Supercop?
- Yeah, you know the guy I'm talking about.

160
00:16:55,558 --> 00:17:00,650
That skin job. That psychopatic soda
machine. That things of men ...

161
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:05,741
Hammond, before you go too far,
I want you to meet your new partner.

162
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,337
Will you give us a minute?

163
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:18,116
That means, move out of the way.

164
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:28,301
I know you don't like it, Hammond,
but you're the best man for it.

165
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:32,174
Well, assuming I've forgotten
about today's nifty events,

166
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:33,895
after what happened out
there with that autogun

167
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:37,657
do you think I'd be happy to take
a position anywhere near a machine.

168
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,048
It's an android.

169
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,085
Well, I don't care what you call it.
It's still a machine.

170
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:44,165
You know how you sound when
you say you don't like machines?

171
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:46,890
Look.
Somebody programmed that thing.

172
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,690
Just like somebody programmed
that autogun to stop intruders,

173
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:54,451
yet it missed our call sign, a secure
call sign. And they call it a malfunction.

174
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:56,862
A god damn hiccup.
That was a human life.

175
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,174
I know.

176
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,447
That's why I want you near it.

177
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,914
There's a lot more at stake here
than just your personal feelings.

178
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:07,743
That android, skin job,
whatever you want to call it

179
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,696
it represents just the first wave
of many, many more to come.

180
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:15,901
And unlike what we're used to,
they don't require human operators.

181
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:23,334
The brass says that we have to
give this thing a field test ... a dry run.

182
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:27,299
- You gonna be reporting on that dry run.
- What?

183
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:29,030
Listen, listen.
Listen to me.

184
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:35,705
This thing could signify the end of
human involvement in law enforcement.

185
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:36,780
Is that what you want?

186
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:44,137
Or on the other hand if it should
just happen to wash out, so be it.

187
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:48,938
Frankly, I think people would be a lot
happier with officers such as yourself,

188
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:52,187
rather than those things.

189
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,651
Hammond!

190
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,609
I'd like to formally introduce you to

191
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:05,223
Advance Autonomous Artificial Intelligence
Neuralnet Law Enforcement Droid

192
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:07,297
I One.

193
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:11,573
Advance autonomous ... look,
that's too long. I'll call you Andy.

194
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:14,811
- You could call me Officer One.
- Sure.

195
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,520
- How do you do?
- Do what?

196
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,365
This thing's gonna be
interacting with the public?

197
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:30,243
You can take that one right there.
Do you even need to sit?

198
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,055
I can sit or stand.

199
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:36,065
You might as well sit down, unless
you want me to hang my jacket on you.

200
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,109
I'm not here for your
amusement, Sergent Hammond.

201
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:41,297
If you would like me to ask for another
partner, I would be very happy to.

202
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:44,294
Wait a minute.
Did you ask for me as a partner?

203
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:45,477
Affirmative.

204
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:46,987
And why would you do that?

205
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:50,899
It was suggested to me that our
compatibility index would be high.

206
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:53,723
<i>You might as well try
that coffee maker over there.</i>

207
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,243
Do you think internal affairs sent him?

208
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,357
No, we got them some bitches locked up
tightly in a froze ass in a tsunami.

209
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:07,489
- No, he's not working for IA.
- Who's he working for then?

210
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:11,439
He's working for us.
Just don't know it yet.

211
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,237
We're getting our first assignment.

212
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:17,294
<i>Hammond, you're up.</i>

213
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,398
<i>We got a report of
a jumper over at 7th Street.</i>

214
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:22,326
<i>All the boys are tied up downtown.
Can you handle that?</i>

215
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,434
I'm on it.

216
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:28,976
Do me a favour. Next time you get wind
of a call, let me know what it is first.

217
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,531
This guy, ruining my day.

218
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:38,894
I have to show this building today.

219
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,736
Do you know him?

220
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,689
Yeah. His name is Jake Wescott.
Lives on the 5th floor.

221
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,106
You know. Comes and goes.
Kind of quiet.

222
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,930
So he's never excited
to jump off the roof before.

223
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:51,164
No.

224
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:53,238
With your permission
I would like to go alone.

225
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:54,571
Hell, no.

226
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,646
My programming
addresses these scenarios.

227
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,561
Oh, yeah. He's going to feel real
worthwhile when we send a robot

228
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:03,522
or android out to talk to him.
That says we really care.

229
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:05,691
I'm not following you.

230
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:10,005
I've gone through several instances
like this in multiple simulations.

231
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:12,668
See, those were simulations.
This is real life.

232
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:15,373
There is a greater probability
for success if I were to go

233
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,912
against someone such as yourself.

234
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:19,344
"Such as myself", what
is that suppose to mean?

235
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:22,030
Sorry guys.
Sorry to interrupt the guys big moment.

236
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,724
Hey!
You want me to cite you?

237
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:30,315
Andy, you stay right here.

238
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:36,880
- Mr Wescott.
- That's far enough.

239
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:39,605
- I'm not here to stop you Mr Wescott.
- Right.

240
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,918
I only want to ask you
a couple of questions.

241
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:44,101
Not really in the mood for questions.

242
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:46,067
Oh, yeah.
I can see that.

243
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:49,980
But Mr Wescott, are you by
any chance an organ donor?

244
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:55,186
As you may know, organ donation
has saved countless lives and

245
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:59,146
don't you think it's a good thing to
consider from a man in your situation.

246
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:02,899
Most people your age who donate
their organs are in terrible accidents

247
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,980
and not all of their
organs are even useful.

248
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:07,469
But you're clearly in
good physical condition.

249
00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:09,631
Would be shame,
don't you think.

250
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:13,179
I'm not going to donate my organs.

251
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:15,590
Mr Wescott, if you just
allow me to make the call,

252
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,352
I can get organ harvesters
over here in 5 minutes.

253
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:20,762
They can euthanize you
in a humane manner.

254
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:24,510
They can be painless. Then we can get your
organs out to somebody who really use them.

255
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,863
You're insane!

256
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:38,840
Wow.  Can you imagine the sensation
of impact from a fall from this height?

257
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:44,682
Give me a moment.

258
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:48,499
I told you to stay back.

259
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:51,861
- We can go now.
- What are you talking about?

260
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:54,511
The situation no longer
requires our presence.

261
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,136
What?

262
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:03,346
I've performed a micro-expression analysis
on the subject.  He will not hurt himself.

263
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:04,299
Try telling that to the ...

264
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,002
In addition I've initiated plan
to defuse the situation.

265
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,610
Okay. What is it?

266
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:37,606
I accessed his phone records.

267
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:40,827
The majority were to an
individual who was not responding.

268
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:44,400
Okay, so the woman ...
you, go on.

269
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:47,445
I sent text from each other
with the data required to bring

270
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:49,371
equilibrium to their social interaction.

271
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,249
Ok. So you text at him pretending to
be her and her pretending to be him.

272
00:23:53,254 --> 00:23:54,569
So you lied.

273
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,544
Each of them received the information
needed to restore their pair bonding.

274
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:01,731
Pair bonding?

275
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,883
I have access to her files.

276
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,627
Your postrate and moral
superiority in questioning

277
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:13,347
the legality of my method is suspect,

278
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:16,188
when you proposed
to euthanize our subject.

279
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,530
Hey, its been legal
in the state since 2024.

280
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,335
Did you consider
the consequences that

281
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,565
the subject were to take
you up on your proposal.

282
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:27,568
Yes, his organs.
Let me ask you a question.

283
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,919
What happens when they realize
that they didn't text each other.

284
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:34,037
The outcome depends
on the amount of time

285
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,381
that has transpired
before this interaction.

286
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:39,353
The further the time
the greater the probabilty

287
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,401
that they will
maintain the equilibrium.

288
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:44,212
Would like to hear
the probability matrix?

289
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:45,313
No.

290
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:48,753
Just remind me to keep you from
interacting with anyone I know.

291
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:52,304
- We're getting another call.
- Could you please stop that?

292
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:55,794
Hammond you got a
missing persons case for you.

293
00:24:57,033 --> 00:25:00,021
See, that's why I told you to
tell me what it is before we  ...

294
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:04,326
Ah, yeah.
Why put us on?

295
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:07,820
You've gotta keep it low profile
for now, it's complicated.

296
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,038
Yes, um.  I'm walking around with a
400 pound black robot with a white head.

297
00:25:13,142 --> 00:25:15,308
How low profile do you think we are?

298
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,208
Look, you've been personally requested
by the mayor's office.  Just do it!

299
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,994
- Sergeant Hammond.
- Stones.

300
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:32,279
And this is?

301
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:37,371
Advanced Autonomous Artificial Intelligence
Neuralnet Law Enforcement Droid I One.

302
00:25:37,474 --> 00:25:38,531
Andy.

303
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:39,879
I get it.

304
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:42,058
The mayor's very busy but he is
concerned about his daughter.

305
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,565
So, the mayor has a daughter?

306
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:47,190
Yes, now this wasn't public
knowledge until recently but

307
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:48,791
when the quake devastated LA,

308
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:52,059
the mayor sent his then infant daughter
to Brazil to live with her mother.

309
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:53,872
He and his wife were estranged.

310
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:56,278
When she passed away, his
daughter returned to Los Angeles.

311
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,900
So is she the one who is missing?

312
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,272
Not exactly.

313
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:09,990
Your domestics?

314
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:12,714
All androids like him.
It's a full tissue for us.

315
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,805
Not as autonomous or as advanced,
they work off a program scripts.

316
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:19,653
Robos.

317
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:35,602
The mayor's daughter,
Helen Jacobs.

318
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:43,470
Well, if she's not missing, who is?

319
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,961
Her body.  She's connected
to a telepresence port.

320
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:47,810
You're familiar with the concept.

321
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:51,401
Oh yes. Robots are androids remotely
controlled to human brain waves.

322
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:55,294
Pioneered by ACI Corporation
for dangerous military operations.

323
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,167
Working in environments
that are not suitable for humans.

324
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,366
Yes, as you are aware,
Detective Hammond,

325
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:04,339
the success on the battlefields
led to many applications.

326
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:08,035
They can give the wounded
a new lease on life, a new mobility,

327
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:09,884
and freedom from their mortal bodies.

328
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:14,336
So she is connected via
telepresence robot right now.

329
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:17,744
An android.  One so sophisticated
it can pass through your eye.

330
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:20,848
So why don't we just wake
her up and ask her where it is?

331
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:22,739
It's not so simple.

332
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:27,691
She suffered catasprophic injuries in
her accident, and she went into a coma.

333
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:33,131
Now we were able to connect her to
an android body, but here's the kicker.

334
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:35,811
She's not aware it is in her own body.

335
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,852
She is not aware of her telepresence.

336
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,320
Is that illegal?

337
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:44,275
I'm told that the shock of waking up
and making such a discovery could be

338
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:47,335
devastating to her.
Could lead to a psychotic break.

339
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:52,066
As far as she is concerned, she had an
accident and she made it out just fine.

340
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,094
How could she not know?

341
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:57,169
The conscious mind believes what
it wants to believe, Detective.

342
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,616
And you cannot track
her telepresence droid.

343
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:02,146
She's gone outside the Grid.

344
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:04,786
We believe she's gone into one
of the deconstructed zones,

345
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,107
that's where you come in.

346
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,090
You can go in there
with no problems.

347
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,821
Well so, if I go in there
and I find her, what then?

348
00:28:11,822 --> 00:28:14,165
I mean she hasn't
committed any crimes.

349
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:16,463
Secure her and bring her back here.

350
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:20,088
Now under no circumstances
is she to be told what she is.

351
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:22,214
Now if Helen wakes up here,
we'll handle that.

352
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:26,103
But otherwise, she is just
a normal 24 year old woman.

353
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:28,230
Who happens to be an android.

354
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:32,791
Not 'be' one, 'existing' one.
You know the difference?

355
00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:38,004
<i>This zone is off limits.</i>

356
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:40,469
So what happened to her?

357
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,610
That's not relevant to this case and

358
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:44,480
the mayor doesn't want
that information out there.

359
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:46,291
Well, it might help us find her.

360
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:47,738
Trust me, it won't.

361
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:49,584
Is there something
in her personality

362
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:51,849
that will make you think she
will be drawn to the Zones?

363
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:56,188
Listen. The mayor and his daughter
don't always see eye to eye.

364
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,781
She's a bit of an activist.

365
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,030
When she got injured, we think she was in
the zones under the guise of some crusade.

366
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,689
People being exploited
are her pet causes.

367
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:10,289
Her father has enemies
on all sides of the law.

368
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:14,520
If she went there under the
guise of some idealogical crusade,

369
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:17,957
she could have run into somebody that
would hurt her just to get to her father.

370
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:20,660
Well, even if they did run into
her, what could they do to her?

371
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:24,859
I mean, her real body is right here
and the other one is an android.

372
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:28,385
No offence Andy, but you know
what people do with androids.

373
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:32,723
Manual labour, soldiers,
domestics, sex slaves.

374
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:35,783
The mayor's daughter,
turned into a sex slave?

375
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:37,975
Look even if it's
for your telepresence,

376
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:40,798
that's something that we don't
even want to imagine, Detective.

377
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,717
Find her, before they do.

378
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,004
We could check the
underground markets.

379
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,758
That won't be necessary.

380
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:13,107
If she has been abducted, someone
with her attributes could end up there.

381
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:17,136
And did you notice her
attributes, oh it's not that,

382
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:19,463
I know somebody that
could help us find her.

383
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,324
Porter, Porter, Porter.

384
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,170
What is this?
Official business?

385
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,960
Yes.
Have you seen this woman?

386
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:30,750
What makes you think
I can help you with that?

387
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:35,614
Don't bullshit me, Porter.
I can make it worth your while.

388
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:40,104
I would not be in business if I turn
people over to anyone offering me a buck.

389
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,626
You see, I'm not offering you a buck,
partner. I'm offering you your freedom.

390
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:47,831
How can you offer me
something I already got?

391
00:30:48,004 --> 00:30:49,255
See my partner, here?

392
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:51,161
He's not like you and me.

393
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:53,147
See, he's an android.

394
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:56,985
That means, you take the
empathy of a regular person,

395
00:30:57,076 --> 00:31:02,716
a normal person.  And you
divide that by that, say, 20,000.

396
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:07,271
And you still won't be able to touch
his level of not giving a ground.

397
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,115
And you're telling me this, why?

398
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,850
Here's where I'm gonna help you,

399
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:13,274
See, he doesn't give a damn about you.

400
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:18,070
See, he can look deep into your
shit, if you know what I mean.

401
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:21,838
No, I don't.

402
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,388
Your business, Porter.
He could look deep into it.

403
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:32,785
Andy, show him what
I'm talking about.

404
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:37,186
I'm assessing his records.

405
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:43,155
I can find nothing that
substantiates filing charges.

406
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,262
Woh, what about his bank records?

407
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:55,257
I'm sure embezzlement might offer up some
numerical residue that we can sniff into.

408
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:02,220
This individual is clean.
He pays his bills.

409
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:05,006
His deposits matches
employer records.

410
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:08,093
I do show that he is
expecting a tax refund.

411
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:11,993
- Give us a minute.
- Absolutely.

412
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:17,807
Look.  You need to go
along with me on this, okay?

413
00:32:17,815 --> 00:32:21,722
You know those text
messages that you falsified?

414
00:32:21,951 --> 00:32:24,849
I do not see how threatening
this individual help our case.

415
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:28,220
Preferable tactic would
be to get in his trust.

416
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:31,140
Well, you need to do a
little in getting my trust.

417
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,750
Are you looking for results

418
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:37,393
or are using this interaction as an
outlet for suppressed aggression?

419
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:40,865
Results.
Watch me.

420
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,484
Listen, asshole.

421
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,132
I know people like you
provide guide services

422
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:53,926
for people going in
and out of the zone.

423
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:55,120
Oh yeah, that's ...

424
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:59,929
Damn!  That is illegal.
That violates the quarantine.

425
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:04,327
This woman has been in and
out of this zone quite often.

426
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:06,836
Clearly, someone has helped her.

427
00:33:07,661 --> 00:33:09,053
Not by me.

428
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:10,628
Is that right?

429
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:13,647
Okay.

430
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:19,360
Then tell me, some other
operators. Give me their names.

431
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:21,887
That's beyond my scope.

432
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:26,089
What are you doing?

433
00:33:27,303 --> 00:33:28,843
This is not working.

434
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:33,514
Oh, okay. You're trying to
play good cop, bad cop.

435
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:35,709
Good cop, bad cop.

436
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:39,416
- Yeah, it's where one of us ...
- I'm familiar with the technique.

437
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,127
Oh, are you?  Well, you're doing
a good job at playing mediocre cop.

438
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:48,133
I tell you what.
You need me, I'll be at the bar.

439
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:02,005
Please accept the apology of the
Police Department for Officer Hammond.

440
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:03,772
He's experiencing difficulties.

441
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:07,511
Oh yeah.  Well, that's no excuse
for roughing somebody up.

442
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,395
Of course it isn't.
Would you like to file charges?

443
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,109
That, ah, isn't necessary.

444
00:34:15,563 --> 00:34:19,027
I'm equipped to accept verbal
statements for filing charges.

445
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:22,326
Look, I .. 
I don't want to file charges.

446
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:24,130
Are you afraid he may retaliate?

447
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:28,589
No. No, no, no, no.
See, it's not my way. Okay.

448
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:32,986
I don't file charges against cops.
Uh, uh.

449
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:34,867
Are you at all afraid of the police? 

450
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:36,756
Would you like to add
that to your statement?

451
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:40,464
No.  God damn it, man!
What's ...

452
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:44,063
If you are threatened by the police
at any time, we can offer protection.

453
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:46,795
I don't need protection.

454
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:49,800
Hey look, I'm sorry.
He's malfunctioning.

455
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:50,772
What?

456
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,944
All system scans are
at acceptable levels.

457
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,130
No, there's something wrong.  We
need to get back to HQ.  Let's go.

458
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,798
You're interfering with
an ongoing investigation.

459
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:01,624
It is against departmental code.

460
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:04,497
We need to go.

461
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,176
You are pursuing unlawful behaviour.

462
00:35:07,912 --> 00:35:11,715
Well then, write me up.
File charges.  Let's go.

463
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:14,237
You can leave.
I'm continuing this investigation.

464
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,004
Well, I see how this
is gonna go down.

465
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:26,098
You are in risk of bodily
injury or destruction.

466
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:28,553
Jesus, you guys are nuts!

467
00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:37,694
It's okay everybody.
I got this all under control.

468
00:35:49,384 --> 00:35:53,029
- You accomplished a lot.
- Yes I did.

469
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:56,195
The adrenalin is affecting your
reasoning and decision making.

470
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,653
Track his calls.

471
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,589
- Who?
- Porter.

472
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,746
He's about to call her right now.
Can you track it?

473
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:05,086
- Affirmative.
- Go ahead.

474
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:08,787
You're not concerned about her
being aware of our interest?

475
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,075
No.

476
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:14,345
Safer this way we don't
want to sneak up on her.

477
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,355
He's making a call.
I've obtained the address.

478
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:27,507
Zone 12 is home to 7 major gangs,

479
00:36:28,508 --> 00:36:30,646
innumerous subgroups
all fighting for control.

480
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:32,900
Is it wise we go it alone?

481
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:38,063
Don't worry. We going in the back way.
No sirens, no lights. No ones expecting us.

482
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,828
We'll be out before
they know we're there.

483
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:50,325
Sir, they're on the move.

484
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,850
Good. Good. Notify me
when they reach the target.

485
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:54,811
Yes, sir.

486
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,686
Yeah.  Put out the word.  The ones who
killed Dext will be in the Zone tonight.

487
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:06,842
Wait for my signal.
Yeah.

488
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:14,408
- Still have a lock on the location?
- It's an unregistered Paygo phone.

489
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:16,561
No guarantee it's hers.

490
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,614
Maybe it's Porter's dry cleaner.

491
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:22,407
There are no registered
dry cleaners in this area.

492
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:38,520
They've entered the Zone.

493
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:41,843
Good.  Soon as they make
contact I need to know.

494
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:44,725
- Are we still getting transmission?
- Yes, sir.

495
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:47,614
What about the manual override option?

496
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,861
You think you could switch
them into manual override?

497
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:53,329
Of course.
You want me to do it now?

498
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,657
No, no, no.
Just wait for my signal.

499
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:58,278
Yes, sir.

500
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:04,850
I hear that Helen Jacobs is more
than just a mere visitor to the Zone,

501
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:06,137
she is a vigilante.

502
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:10,643
The thing about the Zone is, you can
pretty much get anything you want.

503
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:13,964
It's outside the law,
but it's a price you have to pay.

504
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:17,589
Stay there too long and
you're affected by the radiation.

505
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:23,771
Criminals can come and go but the ...
people, regular folks, get stuck there.

506
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:26,368
Knows the people she's fighting for.

507
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:34,559
Relax. Relax.

508
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,127
How's the operation going?

509
00:38:37,296 --> 00:38:40,500
Like clockwork, sir.
The officers are nearly at their target.

510
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,870
Tell me again, about this.

511
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:47,271
Well, it's always been our goal
to rid this zone of gang lords.

512
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:51,232
Last week's raid was
step 1, this is step 2.

513
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,900
Once Officer Hammond and his
partner acquire their targets,

514
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,337
they'll be 14 miles into the zone.

515
00:38:57,983 --> 00:39:01,580
Due to the contamination,
there's only one safe way out.

516
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:05,822
Fortunately for us, that safe way
leads them pass each gang territory

517
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,182
one by one, by one.

518
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,459
It'll be kill or be killed.

519
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:12,476
Now, the beauty of this, sir, is 

520
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:15,636
they'll be taking the
gangs out for us, one by one.

521
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:17,041
And if they should be taken out, 

522
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:20,022
then we'll be justified
in going in for retaliation.

523
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:22,349
It's a win-win, sir.

524
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:28,369
But what if they make it back?

525
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:32,577
There's no chance
of that happening, sir.

526
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,880
That woman ... 

527
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:43,200
that they're after,
that's not my daughter.

528
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:50,030
She is trying to destroy me.

529
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,624
Sir, no one is going
to let that happen.

530
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:55,767
We have a manual
override on the droid,

531
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,201
so if it comes to that,
he'll take 'em out.

532
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:03,526
But, why not we just let
them do our dirty work for us.

533
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,313
Clean up the zones.

534
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:12,463
The city needs more
men like you, Officer.

535
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:13,860
Thank you, sir.

536
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:21,759
Who are you guys?

537
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:25,009
You can just call us the
future of law enforcement.

538
00:40:30,684 --> 00:40:36,184
Then I think the
city is in good hands.

539
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:46,139
- We are within 500 m of the signal.
- Okay.

540
00:40:47,435 --> 00:40:49,043
We go on foot from here.

541
00:41:09,421 --> 00:41:12,963
<i>We're on official police business.
There is nothing to see here.</i>

542
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:15,007
<i>Return to your dwellings.</i>

543
00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:17,673
Why don't you just call
the rest of them out?

544
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:22,189
It is better we make our presence
known, than to surreptitiously advance.

545
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:23,830
We'll see about that.

546
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,708
Are we close to the signal?

547
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:28,121
Within 50 yards.

548
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:31,459
- Call it.
- I'm sorry.

549
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:35,965
- Call the phone.
- Calling.

550
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,664
Over there.

551
00:41:57,712 --> 00:41:58,781
Great.

552
00:42:08,123 --> 00:42:11,524
We need to get back to the vehicle.
Plan B.

553
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,657
What is Plan B?

554
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:18,721
Can you call HQ?

555
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,420
And now you're
considering calling for backup?

556
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:22,849
Look, just call it.

557
00:42:25,385 --> 00:42:29,361
- Something's interfering.
- Great.

558
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:33,075
A throw-away cellphone works, but a
trillion dollar robot can't get through.

559
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:36,207
- I am not a robot.
- Figure of speech.

560
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:38,083
Sorry for calling you the R word.

561
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,525
It appears that I'm having
a block from the other side.

562
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,998
So why don't you just call 911?

563
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:48,287
Police services had been
discontinued in this zone.

564
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:51,540
It was a joke. You should've asked
the wizard for a sense of humour.

565
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:54,605
Look, let's just get to
the car and call for backup.

566
00:42:55,912 --> 00:42:57,442
Who is the wizard?

567
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:06,951
Stop! Stop!
Get down.

568
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:16,162
- Helen Jacobs.
- Yeah.

569
00:43:16,531 --> 00:43:18,336
We're here to escort you in.

570
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:21,671
Thanks.  But I think you're going
to be the ones needing an escort.

571
00:43:25,715 --> 00:43:27,199
How did you know about the bomb?

572
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,180
I've been down here
long enough to know

573
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:31,901
that when someone
crawls under a parked car

574
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:33,495
they're not a
welcoming committee.

575
00:43:33,497 --> 00:43:35,375
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

576
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,889
We were told you maybe
coerced into a sex ring.

577
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:39,949
That's tactful.

578
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,342
Yeah, and if I was,

579
00:43:41,343 --> 00:43:45,329
it probably would be more
of a public relations issue

580
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,478
than any concern to
my personal welfare.

581
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:48,740
It was mentioned.

582
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,630
Damn it Andy,
would you back off.

583
00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:52,230
Listen, you need to come with us.

584
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:54,440
- Am I under arrest?
- Well, no.

585
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:56,087
Have you committed any crime
that may warrant an arrest?

586
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:57,464
Would you, would you shut..

587
00:43:58,025 --> 00:43:59,825
Look, you need to
come with us right now.

588
00:43:59,826 --> 00:44:01,994
No, you need to come with me.
Now.

589
00:44:01,995 --> 00:44:04,772
That explosion is going to draw
everything out of the woodwork.

590
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:07,549
I can't be responsible for
what happens to you guys.

591
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:12,328
Is that the best video you got?

592
00:44:12,394 --> 00:44:14,089
Yes, sir.  That's the
best we can do right now.

593
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:16,407
- And we can't get audio?
- I'm working on it.

594
00:44:17,384 --> 00:44:21,835
Halt!  That's her.
I'll take that as a positive ID.

595
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,532
- Did we take out the vehicle?
- Negative, Sir. That wasn't us.

596
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,265
Oh, they're gonna have a fun night.

597
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,065
Hey, it's a go.
Put out the word.

598
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:45,300
Dext's killer would be in Zone 12,
Grid 16.  Headed east on foot.

599
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:48,305
Now you do whatever
you want with the girl.

600
00:44:48,308 --> 00:44:50,945
But you make sure
neither of them get out alive.

601
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:07,352
Okay. Okay, look.
Nothing to see here.

602
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:09,211
That's not what I see.

603
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:13,399
Look, you're not our concern.
Kindly step aside.

604
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:17,047
Oh, we will. As soon as
we're finished with you.

605
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:19,214
I'm going to pretend
I didn't even hear that.

606
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:21,326
Cause, I'm trying to
be a nice guy, okay.

607
00:45:21,524 --> 00:45:23,555
Now there are a couple of
ways this is gonna go down,

608
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:25,791
and none of them
turn out so good for you.

609
00:45:25,908 --> 00:45:27,978
<i>You're interfering with police business.</i>

610
00:45:28,473 --> 00:45:30,508
<i>Stand aside, or you
will be subject to force.</i>

611
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:32,595
Andy. Andy.
I got this.

612
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:37,464
Look. We're not after you but we can
be if you wanted to go down like that.

613
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:40,165
I could charge you all
with obstructing justice.

614
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,535
Stand down or you
will be subject to force.

615
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:49,117
Stop!

616
00:45:50,374 --> 00:45:53,384
You have a hammer.
I have a hammer too.

617
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,010
Mine is better.

618
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,765
Oh yeah, oh yeah. You are one
hell of a negotiator, aren't you?

619
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:05,389
That was a lethal weapon.

620
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:07,058
That was an axe.
This is LA.

621
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:10,643
If I shot everybody that came at me with an
axe, I'd never get through the paperwork.

622
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:14,655
Besides, the plan was to
go in and out, under the radar,

623
00:46:14,656 --> 00:46:15,900
and not ring the damn dinner bell.

624
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,340
Your negotiations would have
been with the same results.

625
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,500
Oh, you're so damn
confident aren't you?

626
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:22,039
Confidence is outside of my parameters.

627
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:24,323
So this is outside your parameter.

628
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:31,351
And you.  You're trying to
kill all of us.  You included.

629
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:34,405
If this isn't your territory,
why are you here?

630
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:36,286
Okay. Come on.

631
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,807
- Woh.
- That's okay. They're with me.

632
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:49,698
Come on.

633
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:07,536
Ready?

634
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:14,731
That's okay, just ... show them,
show them your baby.

635
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,467
My scan show that the
child is completely normal.

636
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:41,546
Yeah, we can see that,
but what does it mean?

637
00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:45,030
If this environment were radioactive,

638
00:47:45,038 --> 00:47:47,536
you wouldn't be able to
have babies without mutations.

639
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:48,721
You are correct.

640
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:53,489
Mutations resulting from
radioactive fallout occur prior to birth.

641
00:47:54,324 --> 00:47:55,416
So you're saying...

642
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,850
People are not getting
sick because of radiation.

643
00:47:57,853 --> 00:48:01,108
It's something else. It's something
introduced into the environment.

644
00:48:01,116 --> 00:48:04,360
Why, like poison?
Why would anyone want to do that?

645
00:48:04,684 --> 00:48:05,908
Land value.

646
00:48:06,993 --> 00:48:11,915
Look at Los Angeles. We have, what, 30
million people, and no room to house them.

647
00:48:12,378 --> 00:48:15,820
If someone reviewed the Zone,
it would have more than enough room.

648
00:48:15,822 --> 00:48:20,616
So, keeping this area
off limits to development

649
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:23,510
increases the value of
whatever available land there is.

650
00:48:23,877 --> 00:48:25,609
So who would benefit from that?

651
00:48:26,052 --> 00:48:27,796
Whoever who owns their land.

652
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:31,625
And with the quarantine, I guess, 

653
00:48:31,626 --> 00:48:34,361
nobody could come in
here and see what's going on.

654
00:48:34,856 --> 00:48:36,523
You need to leave.

655
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:39,812
All right buddy, I'm
right here with you.

656
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:44,843
This place is a sanctuary. You can't
stay here. They can't get caught here.

657
00:48:44,956 --> 00:48:47,054
Pick on me. Psst.

658
00:48:49,296 --> 00:48:52,715
The major shareholder of the properties
would benefit most from a scheme like this.

659
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,961
Yeah, I know.
My father.

660
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:04,639
We have to go.

661
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:08,180
Why would you help us?

662
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:11,396
I know you don't remember me, but...

663
00:49:12,691 --> 00:49:15,545
I think you saved my life.
At the boundary.

664
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:19,289
At Deorogan, you don't remember it?

665
00:49:22,378 --> 00:49:23,914
You have to leave now.

666
00:49:24,535 --> 00:49:25,928
Give me a minute.

667
00:49:38,093 --> 00:49:39,917
Why would they want us to get her out?

668
00:49:41,013 --> 00:49:42,989
Maybe they're afraid of
what she might discover.

669
00:49:43,191 --> 00:49:44,904
Couldn't they just disconnect her?

670
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:47,286
Cos her body back home
know what she knows here?

671
00:49:47,922 --> 00:49:50,164
You know that.
They're connected.

672
00:49:50,435 --> 00:49:53,060
That Helen is the same as this body.

673
00:49:53,068 --> 00:49:54,849
We need to get her
into protective custody.

674
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:58,646
I'll call Mills. He's solid.
We'll get backup.

675
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:02,386
Just the two of us.  I don't
think we'll make it out alive.

676
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,246
Alive!

677
00:50:05,027 --> 00:50:06,816
Well, in your case, functional.

678
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,536
We need to call for an extraction.

679
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:16,620
We have to get on top of high ground,
preferably a building would be ideal

680
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:19,160
then he could contact the
cell towers to line of sight.

681
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:20,897
Do you know any place like that?

682
00:50:21,224 --> 00:50:22,492
I have an idea.

683
00:50:38,551 --> 00:50:40,847
You're a long way from home.

684
00:50:41,944 --> 00:50:45,060
You kill Dext, and we all forget.

685
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:52,218
Sergeant!  The iron sky is
picking up gunfire in Zone 12.

686
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:55,192
Oh. Oh. Well it's about time.
Let's move out.

687
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:06,722
- Williams.
- Yes, Sir.

688
00:51:06,748 --> 00:51:10,016
I want you to notify me of any
changes of their status or position.

689
00:51:10,017 --> 00:51:10,723
Yes, Sir.

690
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:15,743
And I want officers at that medport
standing by in case we need to go to Plan B.

691
00:51:15,815 --> 00:51:17,275
Already in route, Sir.

692
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:22,560
Excellent.  Well you sit back
and enjoy the show, son.

693
00:51:22,563 --> 00:51:23,609
Copy that.

694
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:38,013
That was the weak gang?

695
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:50,254
There. Pueblo Mueta.

696
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,607
Pueblo Mueta.
Has a nice ring to it.

697
00:52:56,021 --> 00:52:58,353
One thing's for sure.
They heard us coming.

698
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:02,133
- Are you sure we need to go up there?
- Affirmative.

699
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:05,029
You two may stay here.
I will go alone.

700
00:53:05,365 --> 00:53:10,154
Well, I don't get to go to Pueblo Mueta.
What would I tell my kids?

701
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:14,626
- You have kids?
- Well, not yet.

702
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,738
Okay.  Let's ... let's do it.

703
00:53:49,132 --> 00:53:50,687
Go.  Go. Move.

704
00:54:23,065 --> 00:54:24,392
Go. Go. Go.

705
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,191
- Williams.  Come in.
- This is Williams.  Go ahead.

706
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:30,642
I need a status update.

707
00:55:33,195 --> 00:55:37,377
We got more ground fire.
Looks like the PM tower.

708
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,166
Sir, what do we do if they contact us?

709
00:55:44,014 --> 00:55:47,316
You tell them to sit tight.
Calvary's coming.

710
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,109
Yeah.  Sit tight.

711
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:11,024
Well hello, Pueblo Mueta.
We need to find a staircase.

712
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:12,612
Accessing blueprints.

713
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,934
This way.

714
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,008
Oooh!

715
00:56:27,201 --> 00:56:28,778
You know what?
We have to go through.

716
00:56:31,603 --> 00:56:32,389
Ooooh!

717
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:36,402
I guess not everybody exist on rats.

718
00:56:38,872 --> 00:56:40,641
Uh, cannibals?

719
00:56:41,706 --> 00:56:43,737
Dang, cannibals.

720
00:56:49,174 --> 00:56:50,914
Bring me their guts.

721
00:56:51,296 --> 00:56:52,898
You can get through us.

722
00:56:57,776 --> 00:57:01,791
Hey policeman.
Where are you going?

723
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,035
Andy, come on.

724
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:07,365
Andy, what are you doing?

725
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,520
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on.

726
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:20,785
- I'll handle this. Keep moving.
- What?

727
00:57:39,618 --> 00:57:40,695
Hammond.

728
00:57:48,096 --> 00:57:49,095
Hammond!

729
00:58:05,721 --> 00:58:06,513
Hey, you!

730
00:58:18,483 --> 00:58:19,628
Come on.

731
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:32,340
Let's go.

732
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,490
- Can you connect to the cell tower?
- Working on it.

733
00:58:51,879 --> 00:58:53,416
Connecting.

734
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:24,192
This is Officer One of Special Unit,
requesting extraction.

735
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,969
Sending coordinates now.

736
00:59:37,271 --> 00:59:38,486
Officer One.

737
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:41,971
We're discharge to the nearest
secured unit to your location.

738
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,641
Please standby for estimated arrival.

739
00:59:45,642 --> 00:59:48,124
The Commander will
be here in 5 minutes.

740
01:00:22,425 --> 01:00:24,116
I'm like him.

741
01:00:28,713 --> 01:00:31,690
Williams.
Stand by for my command.

742
01:00:31,693 --> 01:00:35,595
If we need to go into manual
override, I want to know my signal.

743
01:00:35,772 --> 01:00:38,645
Copy that.
I'll wait for your signal.

744
01:00:44,827 --> 01:00:48,210
I mean like, not like him.
Like ...

745
01:00:54,271 --> 01:01:00,135
Yeah I, I suspected ... I mean
... the fragments, the memories.

746
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:12,525
Have you seen it?  Me.
The body have. Have you seen it?

747
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:17,468
Oh yes, we've seen you.

748
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:22,303
That. That's not me.
This is me.

749
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:28,071
Yeah, we know. And we won't
let anything happen to you.

750
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:34,492
Okay.

751
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:10,363
Yeah.
That's one of ours.

752
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,785
Hammond.

753
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,413
Jones.

754
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:29,401
Out on a mission?

755
01:02:29,967 --> 01:02:33,270
A lot of guys for
just a simple extraction.

756
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,981
Ay, we were out on an exercise.

757
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:38,275
<i>Helen, Hammond back away.</i>

758
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:42,645
<i>Your micro-expression reveal
a hidden agenda, Sergeant.</i>

759
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:44,569
My micro-expressions.

760
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:48,694
Hot damn, you think that is
pretty friggin' awesome, aren't you?

761
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:53,342
Well I always get a kick out of
spending some time with your kind.

762
01:02:54,038 --> 01:02:57,034
Now was that a lie or not?

763
01:02:57,475 --> 01:02:59,857
<i>Hammond, take the girl and go.</i>

764
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:07,981
Hammond, partner's gone batty.  We
might have to take him in for a overhaul.

765
01:03:10,694 --> 01:03:14,450
Hey, you gonna end up
on the scrap heap for that.

766
01:03:15,006 --> 01:03:19,842
You won't shoot me.  You were
designed to protect and serve.

767
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:25,875
<i>But you said, I may be malfunctioning.</i>

768
01:03:26,817 --> 01:03:29,249
Williams, we need
that manual override.

769
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:34,608
Initiating manual override control.
In 3, 2, 1.

770
01:03:42,505 --> 01:03:43,442
Hammond!

771
01:03:49,818 --> 01:03:51,097
What .. what are you doing?

772
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,526
I don't know.
I'm not doing this.

773
01:03:57,184 --> 01:03:59,758
Stop where you are
or I will shoot you.

774
01:04:00,997 --> 01:04:03,649
<i>Helen, someone has
overwritten his control.</i>

775
01:04:05,032 --> 01:04:06,497
What the hell are you talking about?

776
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:08,268
<i>Helen.
Shoot him.</i>

777
01:04:10,939 --> 01:04:13,887
What the hell is happening to me?
Drop your weapon.

778
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:17,195
<i>You're one of us, man.
You're an android cop.</i>

779
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:18,296
Shut up!

780
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:20,500
Williams, what's going on?

781
01:04:20,506 --> 01:04:22,419
His protocols are
deeper than I thought.

782
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:24,386
But the droid
Hammond still ain't go.

783
01:04:24,389 --> 01:04:27,601
Well, I don't care. You'd
better fix it.  Fix it, man.

784
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:30,612
<i>Shoot him in the temporal
lobe, on the side of the head.</i>

785
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,830
I can't!

786
01:04:33,649 --> 01:04:35,298
I am not an android!

787
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:39,209
<i>You must do it.  It is the only
way to remove their control.</i>

788
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:49,029
An android we can
pass through your eye.

789
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:53,234
A little easier to defence, man
and I've got a camera, Sarge.

790
01:04:54,406 --> 01:04:55,279
Right.

791
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,737
You know what you sound like
when you say you don't like machines.

792
01:04:58,784 --> 01:04:59,933
You're dead!

793
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:04,862
The central nervous system is fine,
but the spine has been severed.

794
01:05:05,342 --> 01:05:07,416
He is paralyzed from the waist down.

795
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:10,179
When will he wake up?

796
01:05:10,924 --> 01:05:13,082
Well, I wouldn't call
it waking up exactly.

797
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:16,797
But if this works, he'll go right
back to work in his old position.

798
01:05:26,668 --> 01:05:28,236
I can't do it.

799
01:05:33,873 --> 01:05:36,020
<i>Hammond!
Eliminate her.</i>

800
01:05:42,725 --> 01:05:43,980
I'm unarmed.

801
01:05:47,224 --> 01:05:48,540
You gonna shoot me?

802
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,950
<i>This is a direct order.
That woman is a terrorist and</i>

803
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:54,176
<i>an enemy of the state.
I have Directive 109 to terminate her.</i>

804
01:05:57,308 --> 01:05:59,269
Hang on.
We gonna take you out of here.

805
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:00,844
<i>This zone is off limits.</i>

806
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:27,457
Go!

807
01:06:29,805 --> 01:06:31,883
Run!  I ...
Run now!

808
01:06:49,346 --> 01:06:51,061
I said, leave now.

809
01:07:03,617 --> 01:07:06,571
I'm gonna finish this.
Get your back. Come on.

810
01:07:14,945 --> 01:07:16,041
Back to land.

811
01:07:46,221 --> 01:07:48,620
You need proof that the
people here are being poisoned.

812
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:51,545
I've been taking blood samples
of people all over the zones.

813
01:07:51,555 --> 01:07:53,936
Whatever is poisoning
them, it's in their blood.

814
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:56,508
I just don't know how they
are administering the poison.

815
01:07:56,509 --> 01:07:58,275
- It's in the food.
- What?

816
01:07:58,488 --> 01:07:59,991
It's in the food drops.

817
01:08:00,347 --> 01:08:04,030
When I was at your house, I saw
a picture of your father, the Mayor,

818
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:06,430
receiving commendations
for the food drops.

819
01:08:06,437 --> 01:08:08,914
Whatever is poisoning
all the people, is in the food.

820
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:11,270
We need to get the story out there.

821
01:08:11,272 --> 01:08:13,230
I have a contact that
will get this story out.

822
01:08:13,233 --> 01:08:15,500
Believe me, he is
no friend of your father's.

823
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,580
<i>Take the floor!</i>

824
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:21,090
Williams, come in.
We need to go to Stage 2.

825
01:08:21,092 --> 01:08:22,980
Plan B is now in effect.

826
01:08:22,983 --> 01:08:24,097
<i>Are you sure?</i>

827
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:27,290
No, you're right.
Maybe I should reconsider.

828
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:31,107
Yes, I'm sure.
Don't ever question me again!

829
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:08,859
Something's wrong.

830
01:09:09,341 --> 01:09:10,550
<i>Hello Hammond.</i>

831
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:15,775
<i>Right now, I imagine you feeling kind
a squeasy, well put us all in a start.</i>

832
01:09:15,853 --> 01:09:16,939
What have they done?

833
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,360
<i>Your life support has
been disconnected.</i>

834
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:23,555
<i>I'm afraid it was some kind of accident,
at least that's the official report.</i>

835
01:09:24,015 --> 01:09:25,600
<i>I don't know
how long you have,</i>

836
01:09:25,601 --> 01:09:28,028
<i>your body can't function
long without the machines.</i>

837
01:09:28,078 --> 01:09:29,380
<i>It's ironic, isn't it.</i>

838
01:09:29,383 --> 01:09:33,516
<i>But I'm ravelling, how long do
you have, maybe 20 minutes.</i>

839
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:34,799
Bastard.

840
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,763
<i>Maam, I'm sorry to say that you will
soon be experiencing the same thing,</i>

841
01:09:38,764 --> 01:09:42,136
<i>and I'd like to say it was tough convincing
your father it was necessary, but</i>

842
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:44,949
<i>let's say the Mayor was pragmatic.
Now where were we?</i>

843
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,418
<i>Oh Hammond!
Yes.</i>

844
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,511
<i>There is a solution.</i>

845
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:51,335
<i>Give up and we'll plug you and
your father and your friends back in.</i>

846
01:09:51,337 --> 01:09:54,231
<i>Whatever you think you know,
whatever information you have,</i>

847
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,816
<i>is not going to make a difference.</i>

848
01:09:56,036 --> 01:09:57,565
<i>And you're both going to die.</i>

849
01:09:58,349 --> 01:10:00,640
<i>Tick tock.
We'll be waiting on you.</i>

850
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:03,620
Andy.  What is the
fastest way to Media Centre?

851
01:10:03,627 --> 01:10:06,688
No, we have to go to your house,
where your body is being kept.

852
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:09,204
<i>Helen Jacobs body is not at her house.</i>

853
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:10,540
How do you know that?

854
01:10:10,547 --> 01:10:13,280
<i>They would have expected that.
They have moved the body.</i>

855
01:10:13,281 --> 01:10:14,300
Do you know where?

856
01:10:14,303 --> 01:10:17,211
<i>I may be able to link it
to the nurse's tracking device.</i>

857
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:19,899
<i>I logged on to it
when I was at the hospital.</i>

858
01:10:20,032 --> 01:10:21,442
Yeah, I know you have a thing for it.

859
01:10:21,629 --> 01:10:22,932
<i>I have the location.</i>

860
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:25,802
Good. We can have the
media to meet us there.

861
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:27,423
What about you?

862
01:10:27,425 --> 01:10:28,427
Forget about me.

863
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:29,930
I'm not going to let you die.

864
01:10:29,937 --> 01:10:30,719
<i>Calculating.</i>

865
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,314
Look. You think those assholes are going
to let me or any of us live after this?

866
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:38,919
Even if they do, they're probably put
me back in a coma, or erase my memory.

867
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:43,288
No, we have to see this through.
It's the only way for any of us.

868
01:10:44,959 --> 01:10:45,901
<i>Turn here.</i>

869
01:10:45,905 --> 01:10:47,307
- Here.
- Affirmative.

870
01:10:55,036 --> 01:10:55,994
There.

871
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:06,158
Shit.

872
01:11:08,688 --> 01:11:09,767
Two hundred yards.

873
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,620
Hit them with everything.

874
01:12:06,591 --> 01:12:09,099
Andy, they are doing something to her.
Give me ... give her something.

875
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,243
<i>I might be able to help
her human body.  But not her.</i>

876
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:13,960
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

877
01:12:15,368 --> 01:12:20,606
Andy. Contact Arnie Miller. At the union.
Tell him to meet us at Metal Services.

878
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:25,118
Tell him to get every media hound
in town, to meet us there.

879
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:27,491
<i>Copy that.</i>

880
01:12:36,263 --> 01:12:38,560
She is to scare us out.
They know we're ignoring.

881
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:41,037
Yeah.  But they don't
know how we're getting in.

882
01:12:54,747 --> 01:12:59,828
I told you it's nasty, officers.
But, sadly, this is where it ends.

883
01:13:00,162 --> 01:13:04,907
By my calculations, you've got under
2 minutes of life, Officer Hammond.

884
01:13:06,223 --> 01:13:11,975
Ms Jacobs, I'm not at liberty to
comment on your status but your father

885
01:13:11,976 --> 01:13:16,106
has prepared a glowing press release

886
01:13:16,107 --> 01:13:20,462
honoring your services to
the unfortunate in the zone.

887
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:25,901
Hammond, I never liked you,

888
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:29,829
but I hate to see
a fellow officer go down,

889
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:36,465
even one as misguided as you.

890
01:13:36,804 --> 01:13:40,883
So give up now.
We can work this out.

891
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:44,296
You both don't have to die.

892
01:13:50,165 --> 01:13:51,650
Last chance.

893
01:13:55,206 --> 01:13:56,773
Hit them with everything!

894
01:13:58,199 --> 01:13:59,324
Everything!

895
01:15:00,323 --> 01:15:01,240
Go.

896
01:15:06,772 --> 01:15:08,357
I have a story for you.

897
01:17:03,031 --> 01:17:04,351
Officer.

898
01:17:06,766 --> 01:17:10,327
I want to thank you
for saving my daughter.

899
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:17,769
And my deepest
condolences for your partner.

900
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:29,990
It is a shame though, as you
may not have been aware

901
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:32,325
of Helen's wishes.

902
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:39,074
Apparently and unbeknown to us,

903
01:17:41,638 --> 01:17:47,386
she signed a
"Do Not Resuscitate" order.

904
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:54,474
We have been fighting the Courts
to keep her going, but to no avail.

905
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:59,762
We received the verdict today.

906
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:04,666
We lost.

907
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:10,745
Helen is going to get her wishes.

908
01:18:12,066 --> 01:18:15,512
She would have never
wanted to exist like this.

909
01:18:15,513 --> 01:18:20,347
We thought her android body
could give her another live.

910
01:18:22,024 --> 01:18:25,060
But now that's over,
and thanks to you...

911
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:32,298
The Court order requires
that we pull the plug.

912
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:41,272
Turn the machine off.
Now.

913
01:19:26,459 --> 01:19:30,332
You told me she wouldn't wake up.
What did you do to her?

914
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:33,722
Your nurse has been
keeping her sedated.

915
01:19:35,019 --> 01:19:36,623
I don't know what's happening, Sir.

916
01:19:37,138 --> 01:19:41,714
That's why ...
Why did you do it, right?

917
01:19:42,164 --> 01:19:44,132
Did you poison them?

918
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,176
Do something!

919
01:19:58,676 --> 01:20:02,616
<i>You told me she wouldn't wake up.
What did you do to her?</i>

920
01:20:03,968 --> 01:20:06,531
<i>Your nurse has been
keeping her sedated.</i>

921
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,288
<i>I don't know what's happening, sir.</i>

922
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:10,593
<i>Do something.</i>

923
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:16,024
Officer, go get 3 men. Get back
here on the double.  Go, go, go.

924
01:20:16,563 --> 01:20:17,461
Shut that off.

925
01:20:17,715 --> 01:20:18,718
<i>Shut that off.</i>

926
01:20:19,986 --> 01:20:21,171
Shut if off.

927
01:20:21,552 --> 01:20:22,732
<i>Shut it off.</i>

928
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:26,632
What is this?

929
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:40,402
Nobody move. Nobody moves.
Nobody.

930
01:21:06,656 --> 01:21:10,449
Mr Mayor,
hand me the weapon.

931
01:21:25,049 --> 01:21:26,877
No, no, no, no.
Don't!

932
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:03,850
Now that your BIOS has been
upgraded, Officer Hammond,

933
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:06,678
I believe our partnership can
operate on more equal terms.

934
01:22:08,099 --> 01:22:09,724
What do you mean, equal terms?

935
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:13,475
You are now free to
operate in machine mode,

936
01:22:13,476 --> 01:22:16,416
without human interference,
or logic deficits.

937
01:22:17,213 --> 01:22:18,909
Human interference.

938
01:22:20,498 --> 01:22:23,263
Human interference?

939
01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:27,767
Is that what you just said?
I can't believe you even said that.

940
01:22:29,397 --> 01:22:31,413
Something is amiss
with your programming.

941
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:34,259
No, something is amiss
with your programming.

942
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,816
Do you really think
we're the same, huh?

943
01:22:37,573 --> 01:22:38,696
Let me explain it to you.

944
01:22:38,697 --> 01:22:45,365
My CPU's neural network was imprinted by
my controller's, a human's neural framework.

945
01:22:45,366 --> 01:22:50,689
That framework constitutes
70.236 of who I am.

946
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:55,103
And as you know, if you're one-eighth
of a human then you are what?

947
01:22:55,019 --> 01:22:57,416
In fact, a human.

948
01:22:58,118 --> 01:23:02,862
What I am is a Humadroidican
American.  Get it straight.

949
01:23:04,734 --> 01:23:08,446
I am sorry that your function will
be hampered by that framework.

950
01:23:09,035 --> 01:23:11,843
Hampered? See see. No.
You're the one that is hampered.

951
01:23:11,928 --> 01:23:14,834
Look at you. See you're
basically a soda machine.

952
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:16,002
No, no.
Strike that.

953
01:23:16,136 --> 01:23:19,393
A soda machine is better
because it dispenses soda.

954
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:22,695
Something useful.

955
01:23:22,983 --> 01:23:28,161
But you, what do you dispense?
Hot air.  Logic.

956
01:23:28,349 --> 01:23:30,784
You can't even think on your feet,
you have no sense of humour,

957
01:23:30,883 --> 01:23:31,885
you're just...

958
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:37,488
We're getting a call.

959
01:23:38,511 --> 01:23:39,966
Already got that.
See.

960
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:42,675
Uh, responding.

961
01:23:42,822 --> 01:23:43,933
Hammond, I need you to ...

962
01:23:43,934 --> 01:23:46,306
Don't even have to say anything.
Thank you.
