1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:00,000
enjoy the film... :)
2
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
I didn't do it!

3
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,000
I swear to God,
I didn't do it!

4
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Those women were
always good to me.

5
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm innocent!

6
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!

7
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,100
John, you know me.

8
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,500
I have nothing to do
with any murder.

9
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,800
I'll kill you!

10
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,000
Please.
You must believe me.

11
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,700
Is this the man you saw commit
these terrible murders?

12
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,000
It's all right.
You're safe here.

13
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,600
- Jesus loves me.
- The devil loves you.

14
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,300
Jesus loves me...

15
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Jesus loves me.
Jesus loves me...

16
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,100
The State of New Hampshire

17
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,300
versus Louis Wagner.

18
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Call your first witness.

19
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,100
The people call
Evan Christenson.

20
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And what did you do
when you got to Smuttynose?

21
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,200
When I got to Smuttynose,
I went up to the house

22
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,400
- And went right in.
- And what did you see?

23
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,100
I saw my wife
lying on the floor.

24
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Dead or alive?

25
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Evan! Evan!

26
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Evan.

27
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,300
Your mother looked
a little tired.

28
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,000
She can handle it.

29
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,700
If you're not used to having
a five-year-old around...

30
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,000
I thought the whole point
was to get away.

31
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
If you're gonna worry
about Billie all weekend...

32
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,800
All right, Thomas.

33
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,500
What?

34
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,000
Nothing.

35
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,500
I'm looking forward
to seeing Rich.

36
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,900
It's been quite a while.

37
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,900
A weekend with my brother...
that's a rare treat.

38
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm a photographer
for a magazine.

39
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,200
They're doing an article
about the murders.

40
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,900
My brother-in-law
has a boat,

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,900
and I thought he could
take us to Smuttynose Island,

42
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,400
- Where the murders happened.
- Hey, there...

43
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,000
We left our daughter
with her grandmother.

44
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,600
I thought it would be
sort of a vacation.

45
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,100
Jean, this is Adaline.

46
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,100
Adaline, this is my favorite
sister-in- law.

47
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,300
- Favorite and only.
- Caught on a technicality.

48
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
Rich introduced us
to his new girlfriend.

49
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

50
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,800
I didn't know
he was bringing anyone.

51
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,500
This is my husband, Thomas.
Adaline, wasn't it?

52
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
We've met, actually.

53
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,500
Hi. At the writers'
dinner, right?

54
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

55
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
- Hey.
- Hey. It's been too long.

56
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Where's all this go?

57
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,500
Old man lays down.

58
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,000
Come on,
I'll teach you how to dive.

59
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,400
It was impossible to know
that we had 17 hours left.

60
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,200
Or 12... or three.

61
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,700
This is it?

62
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,600
"...the two women
were discovered in the kitchen,

63
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,600
strangled and bludgeoned
with an axe."

64
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Isn't "bludgeon"
a wonderful word?

65
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,900
One of the best.

66
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,800
Oh, this one's good.
"The nude body of Anethe..."

67
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,900
"An-nette."

68
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
"The nude body
of Anethe Christenson

69
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,800
was draped with a cloth
as if the killer could not bear

70
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,800
to look at his handiwork
while he sipped his tea."

71
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,400
Imagine the psychology
of a guy who could sit

72
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,800
and drink tea with two women
he's just bludgeoned.

73
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,400
This must be
the kitchen, right?

74
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,300
Where they found
the bodies.

75
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,300
Yeah, about...

76
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
over there and...

77
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,400
here.

78
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Help!

79
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,800
Hello!

80
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,700
Help!

81
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,700
"Although Louis Wagner
was convicted of the murders,

82
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,500
the matter has been debated
for over a century."

83
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm working on the "Oswald
'single axe' theory" myself.

84
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,100
Adaline is hoping you might
read something

85
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
for us later tonight,
Thomas.

86
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,400
Whatever you're working on,
you know...

87
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
we're not critics.

88
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
Many poets can turn a phrase,

89
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
but most of them
don't have the balls

90
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,700
to tackle
the really great themes.

91
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm not sure I even know what
the "really great themes" are.

92
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,400
Abandonment...

93
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Ioss, castration...

94
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,800
That's never gonna be
one of my problems, thankfully.

95
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,000
Chauvinism?

96
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,400
That's tired,
don't you think?

97
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,400
What about Yeats?

98
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,000
The celebration
of the human imagination.

99
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,000
- The magician.
- Melancholy.

100
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,600
It's all melancholy.

101
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,900
"The room swinging
with emptiness

102
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,900
like an unswung bell."
Valentin Iremonger.

103
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think
the really great ones

104
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,900
use words in such a way
you can never take them back.

105
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,700
Yeah, they do.

106
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,900
"To separate from life...

107
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,900
from tantalizing mysteries
and salt spray...

108
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,000
from the grave
gypsy eyes...

109
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,100
and the sacred, poignant flesh
of long-limbed dancers,

110
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,400
unsullied,
but not for long."

111
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,600
She's memorized you,
Thomas.

112
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,500
I stole "poignant flesh"

113
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,400
from Rich.

114
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,400
- I don't remember saying that.
- You were drunk.

115
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,400
I don't think I'd ever
use that word.

116
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,100
That's so like you.

117
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,000
You probably read more
than anybody I've ever met.

118
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But you always pretend
you'd rather be drinking beer

119
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,900
- At a Red Sox game.
- Depends on who's pitching.

120
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
How did Wagner know
the men would be gone?

121
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,600
Sorry. Still thinking
about the murders.

122
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,600
But Louis Wagner...
the man they hanged...

123
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,700
how did he know
the women would be alone?

124
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,800
He's got a 12-mile row
back to shore,

125
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,700
why take time
to drink tea?

126
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,100
And why cover one woman's face
and not the other's?

127
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,400
Axe murderers don't tend to have
the most razor- sharp intellects.

128
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,800
Maybe her eyes were open.
It was the sight of them,

129
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,400
the accusation.

130
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,800
He couldn't stand to have her
looking at him.

131
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,800
So it was an act
of passion.

132
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,200
But using an axe
requires intimacy.

133
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Think about...

134
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,300
how close you have to be
to your victim...

135
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,600
the vibration in your hand,

136
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,100
and the handle as the blade
strikes bone.

137
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,400
The spray of blood
warm on your face,

138
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,900
and standing over her,
her last choking gasps.

139
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,600
If he had gone there
with the intent to murder,

140
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,000
he would've taken a gun.

141
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,400
I think the killer was in love
with one of the women.

142
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
And murder was the only way
he could possess her.

143
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,200
I like that.

144
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Wagner... Wagner.

145
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
He came into the house.

146
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,400
Wagner?

147
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,600
He took an axe

148
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
- And he swung it.
- Oh God.

149
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,500
God help us.

150
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
Anethe...

151
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,800
Is she hurt?

152
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Evan. Evan.

153
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,300
Is she all right?

154
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,800
- Maren... Maren?
- Evan...!

155
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Is she all right?

156
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,700
Evan! Evan!

157
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,200
It was funny
the way I found out.

158
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Our daughter
was in the hospital.

159
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Jean had...

160
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,800
I guess neither of us
had paid enough attention

161
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
to an infection
that she had.

162
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Next thing we knew,
she was barely breathing.

163
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,200
We rushed her
to the hospital.

164
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,000
It was pneumonia.

165
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,500
She was tiny...
she was six weeks old...

166
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,800
and had tubes going in
one end and out the other.

167
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,400
And she was fighting
for every breath.

168
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,700
And I think
in a moment like that,

169
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
you feel hope
crossing over into grief.

170
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Nicely put, Thomas.

171
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,400
And they had her in this
fucking box...

172
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,800
an incubator...
and it looked like a coffin.

173
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,300
What's wrong?

174
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,400
Nothing.

175
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Then someone from the committee
found me in the hospital.

176
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,400
I got on the phone,
they told me I'd won.

177
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,800
Oh, I didn't have any idea.
I'm sorry.

178
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Of course, Billie's fine now...
tons of trouble.

179
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,600
But it was just so unimportant
to me at the time.

180
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,200
I don't think I know what
it's like to win a Pulitzer.

181
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,600
Love is never as ferocious

182
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,100
as when you think
it's gonna leave you.

183
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Thomas!

184
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,700
What?

185
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,000
Have you done something
with the wine

186
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,400
- We're having for dinner?
- The wine?

187
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,700
- It's almost time to eat.
- I've got it right here.

188
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,000
Open it for me, Thomas.
You're the expert.

189
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,800
There was a flesh wound
upon the right forehead,

190
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
separating the upper part.

191
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,500
The left ear
was nearly cut through,

192
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
separating it
from the head.

193
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
In my opinion,
a very heavy instrument

194
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
had to make those blows.

195
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
An axe,
in all probability.

196
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,200
The only people who knew

197
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,400
the women would be alone
that night

198
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
were Emil Ingerbretson...
'cause I asked him

199
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,400
to tell Maren we couldn't
make it back...

200
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,000
and Louis Wagner.

201
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,000
When did you arrive
in America, Mrs. Hontvedt?

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,500
I arrived five years ago
with my husband John.

203
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,700
He is a fisherman.

204
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,500
We left our home
because we were told

205
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,800
this is a land
of opportunity.

206
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,000
This is not it, John.

207
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Surely this is not it?

208
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,400
Hello!

209
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,800
Sit...

210
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,200
and have a rest.

211
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,400
We don't have
any money to go back.

212
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,800
We'll make it.

213
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,000
The best cure
for melancholy is industry.

214
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,300
And though the winds
blew for days, neverending,

215
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,100
and the gulls
never ceased their cries,

216
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,500
we drew strength
from the rhythm of our labors.

217
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,200
And from God.

218
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,200
My husband and I grew
accustomed to the solitude.

219
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,900
I didn't mind the work.

220
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,200
I never complained.

221
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,400
I was brought up for this.

222
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,100
The wind carried off
our speech

223
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
so we spoke less.

224
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,900
And with work, I suppose,
we had less to say.

225
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,500
It is better
not to take the chance

226
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,100
of asking
an uncomfortable question,

227
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,500
or revealing an affection
for another person

228
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,500
that may bring
unintentioned pain.

229
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,000
It is wiser,
I think,

230
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
to keep silent
and preserve the bond.

231
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I knew that I would not
be able to leave the island.

232
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,700
I had to bite my cheek to keep
from breaking into tears,

233
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,400
that once started,
might continue forever.

234
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,100
Can you get me
a drink, please?

235
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,500
Sure.

236
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,900
Adaline...
- Shit! Quick.

237
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,300
Shit!

238
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,500
Jesus Christ.
Help!

239
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,100
Can you help?!

240
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,900
Jesus.

241
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
- Something blew this way.
- Here.

242
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
- Thanks.
- And here.

243
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,000
Thanks.

244
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,800
Jesus.

245
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,300
Thanks.

246
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
What's all the excitement?

247
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,800
Nothing.

248
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,800
Nicely done.

249
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,200
Hah!

250
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,500
Never get it.

251
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,200
There's a certain poetry
in photography, don't you think?

252
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,900
You know, putting a frame
around the world?

253
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,800
I imagine that's maybe
part of the attraction

254
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,900
between the two of you.

255
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,200
You think so, Thomas?

256
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,000
Makes sense.

257
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,500
I always felt it was more
of an animal attraction myself.

258
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,700
Two strays sniffing
each other in an alley.

259
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,900
You overreached.

260
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,100
I was thinking about
what keeps people together

261
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
over the long term.

262
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,500
So how did you two meet?

263
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,900
Thomas introduced us
at the dinner.

264
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,800
I think actually he was
trying to get rid of me,

265
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,700
because I was acting
like a groupie

266
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,100
and asking
too many questions.

267
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,500
Two seconds after I met him,
I was asking him

268
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,400
how he got his scar.

269
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,500
I couldn't help noticing it
in his photograph...

270
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,700
you know, the one in the back
of "The Magdalene Poems"?

271
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Seemed like it would've been
so easy for him to just...

272
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,000
turn away a little
so it didn't show.

273
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,400
But he didn't.

274
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,200
What did he say?

275
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
I said...

276
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
that I had a car accident
when I was a kid.

277
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,500
The driver was drunk.

278
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,000
I probably read
too much into things,

279
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,700
but I thought it was maybe
something we had in common.

280
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,100
'Cause I put my arm
through a window once.

281
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,100
- We need more wine.
Sure.

282
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,400
I'll be right back.

283
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
I'll get a towel.

284
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,300
Oh, help!

285
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,900
Anethe!

286
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,800
Anethe!

287
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,200
Please...

288
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,600
Thomas?

289
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,200
- Thomas?
- Hm-mm?

290
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,100
I don't think he did it.

291
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,600
What?

292
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,200
The murders.
I don't think Wagner did it.

293
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,900
It was the woman,
the survivor... she killed them.

294
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Jean, I just need
a few minutes' sleep.

295
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,400
I can't sleep at all
on this fucking thing.

296
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,700
Maren.

297
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,700
Yes?

298
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,800
John?
What's this?

299
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,200
It's for you.
A little company, I thought.

300
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,700
- Do you like him?
- Yes.

301
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,100
- I like him very much.
- Good.

302
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,000
Thank you.

303
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,200
I'm going
to call him "Ringe."

304
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,400
Oh... you have a letter
from home.

305
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,300
- Do I?
- Yeah.

306
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,800
I thought Evan
would never write.

307
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,500
It's from my sister,
Karen.

308
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,400
Our father has died.

309
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
She's coming to America.

310
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,400
She can't.

311
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,300
We have no other bed
and no money for it.

312
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,900
That's all right.

313
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,500
I've been saving some money
for the new schooner.

314
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,200
It's fine.

315
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,500
You're seasick.
Yes, I am a little.

316
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Welcome.

317
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,600
Be careful
with that trunk.

318
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
I'm sick from the boat.

319
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,600
I need tea and bread.

320
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,400
Karen...
how is our brother?

321
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,100
He's well.

322
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,500
Is that all?

323
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,800
Hasn't he written you?

324
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
We had one letter.

325
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,200
One letter
in all this time?

326
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,300
I'm surprised.

327
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,200
I thought our brother
bore you a special affection.

328
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,500
He's probably busy.

329
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,300
He was not too busy
to be a comfort to me.

330
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,000
He took me on a holiday
over Easter.

331
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,600
And to the theater.
And to supper.

332
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,200
And we stayed in a hotel.

333
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,700
He's prospered
wonderfully.

334
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,200
And put money by.

335
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
No doubt he will soon
meet a young woman

336
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,000
to turn his head.

337
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,100
Perhaps he'll come
to America.

338
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,900
Don't be absurd.

339
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,200
A man who prospers
in his own country

340
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,200
has no need to flee.

341
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,400
He's well, though?

342
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,000
And happy?

343
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,200
Oh yes, Maren.

344
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,500
Never better.

345
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,400
We found Karen
a domestic position

346
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,400
early that spring
at the Appledore Island Hotel.

347
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,800
I hoped the work
might occupy her.

348
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

349
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,600
- You sleep well?
- Yeah.

350
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,300
Guess I'm the last one up.

351
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

352
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I thought we could
call Billie later.

353
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,100
I just did.

354
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,000
Oh.

355
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,300
Oh, you could have
told me.

356
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,100
They were going to the park.
I said you'd call later.

357
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,500
- Is she all right?
- She misses us.

358
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,700
She said that?

359
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,400
I could tell.

360
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,300
But it doesn't matter.
We're gonna be back tomorrow.

361
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,900
"Hi. We're unable
to take your call right now,

362
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
so please leave a message,
and we'll call you back."

363
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,600
Hello, John.

364
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,400
I brought a mate
from Portsmouth

365
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,300
to board with us.

366
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,200
He has some rheumatism,
and it needs nursing sometimes,

367
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,300
- But he's a good hand.
- It's so cramped as it is.

368
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,000
Come in, Louis.

369
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,600
Louis Wagner, madam.

370
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,400
From Germany?

371
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,200
I hope I won't be
a burden to you.

372
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,000
It's no burden.
What's one more?

373
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Louis, let me show you
your room.

374
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,200
Come.

375
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,200
Sorry to be so stiff.

376
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,200
I'm afraid you will soon
be looking after me

377
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,400
and my rheumatism.

378
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,300
Do you mind
the extra work?

379
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,600
I never mind work.

380
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,100
May I see your hands?

381
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,800
They're strong.
That's good.

382
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,900
Sometimes it helps
to have my joints massaged.

383
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,400
Would you do that
for me?

384
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,300
If my husband
has no objection.

385
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,900
If he doesn't know,
he can have no objection.

386
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,000
They're waiting for you
on the boat.

387
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,200
It's coming on again.
I can feel it.

388
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,900
Would you help me
to the bed?

389
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
Please?

390
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
Thank you.

391
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,600
All right.
Ease me down, Thomas.

392
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,300
"Dear Mr. Plaisted,

393
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,300
I will be in Portsmouth
on April 15th,

394
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,300
and would very much
appreciate it

395
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,600
if I could meet in your
chambers that afternoon.

396
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,200
Please respond
by return post.

397
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,900
Sincerely,
Mrs. John Hontvedt."

398
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,200
Aren't you hot?

399
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Do you want to swim
or something?

400
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,800
Take a look at this.
Tell me what you think.

401
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
What is it?

402
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,000
A letter Maren Hontvedt
wrote to the prosecutor.

403
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,800
- What do you think?
- Not much to it, is there?

404
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,500
- Look at the date.
- April 7th, 1875."

405
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
That's two years
after the trial.

406
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
What reason could Maren have
for meeting the prosecutor then?

407
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,000
Okay, I give.

408
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,000
Louis Wagner
was hanged three weeks

409
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,700
after she wrote
this letter.

410
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Maybe Maren couldn't live
with the guilt

411
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,300
and she wanted to confess
before an innocent man died.

412
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,800
Confess?

413
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,800
I thought you were
snapping a few photographs,

414
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,200
- Not re-opening the case.
- Aren't you curious?

415
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,400
Yeah.

416
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,600
I want to go back
to the mainland for a few hours,

417
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,100
Iook around
the courthouse in Portsmouth.

418
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Maybe there's a record
of this meeting.

419
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,700
We are running
a little low on wine.

420
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,100
Thomas
is outdoing himself, hmm?

421
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Hey...

422
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,700
you all right?

423
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,100
So I thought...

424
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Never better.

425
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,500
"And in that day they shall
roar against them

426
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,800
like the roaring
of the sea,

427
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,300
and if one look
unto the land,

428
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,200
behold darkness
and sorrow,

429
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,600
and the light is darkened
in the heavens thereof."

430
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,800
You're a good cook.

431
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,500
I'm not.

432
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,900
You're right.
It's dreadful.

433
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I must be a fool
to keep eating it.

434
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,300
I think you are
feeling better.

435
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,000
A miraculous recovery,
I think.

436
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,900
You are
a "sister of mercy."

437
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Are you lonely here?

438
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,700
No.
Of course not.

439
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,600
I have my dog Ringe.

440
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,100
Yes, your dog.

441
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,300
Is he enough?

442
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,200
I have my husband too.

443
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,800
Dog first, husband second...

444
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,800
that is the usual
order of things.

445
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,600
Should keep such observations
to yourself, Mr. Wagner.

446
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,600
I'm lonely too, Mrs. Hontvedt.
That's why I asked.

447
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,000
You're too young to be
a married woman.

448
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
John doesn't deserve
such a beautiful wife.

449
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,000
I have made
some konfetkake.

450
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,300
- Would you like some?
- Konfetkake? I don't think so.

451
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,000
You are the only confection
that interests me.

452
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,200
Perhaps I could have
just a little "taste"?

453
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,200
Mrs. Hontvedt,
don't be offended.

454
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,100
I only tease you.
You've not been teased much.

455
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,200
Am I correct?

456
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,100
You should go.

457
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,000
As you wish.

458
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,000
I would do anything
to have you.

459
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,200
And did the defendant cease
his unwelcome overtures?

460
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,600
He did not.

461
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,900
Women's motives are always
more concealed than men's.

462
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
So you think Jean's right
about it being the woman?

463
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,300
It's always the woman.

464
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,900
I can't see a woman
using an axe.

465
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,400
- Lizzie Borden?
- She was acquitted.

466
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Because 12 men on the jury
couldn't see a woman

467
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,400
using an axe.

468
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,200
Maren must have used an axe
every day chopping wood.

469
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,900
But why would she
kill them?

470
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,800
When a woman kills,
it's generally a spouse.

471
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,600
For obvious reasons.

472
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,400
But her sister
and sister-in-law?

473
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,900
It doesn't make
much sense.

474
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,600
It is remotely possible
they hanged the right guy.

475
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,500
Come on, Rich.
What's the fun in that?

476
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,700
Excuse me,
but aren't you that writer?

477
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,700
Yeah... William S. Burroughs.
A pleasure.

478
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,100
I read "The Magdalene Poems"
for my class.

479
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,000
What'd you make of them?

480
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:11,300
Good. Really good.
Thomas Janes, right?

481
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,000
What are you
working on now?

482
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,100
An infomercial,
but don't tell anybody.

483
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,200
That's my brother, Rich,
the handsome one.

484
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,600
Can I go to the courthouse
with you?

485
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,300
It's not necessary.

486
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,600
I want to go.

487
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,800
All right.
