1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,472
[upbeat music playing]

2
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,531
[Travis] Have you ever been in the middle
of everything in your life

3
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,698
falling completely apart,

4
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,452
and you stop and ask yourself,
"Where the hell did it all go wrong?"

5
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,541
This is the moment that ruined it all.

6
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,708
Just look at me,

7
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,919
standin' there looking like
a complete dummy,

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,462
just waitin' to get caught.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,882
[stuttering] Hey, girl!

10
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,134
What's goin' on? What are you doing?

11
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,887
[stuttering] What up?
What you mean what...

12
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,930
I just got out the shower.

13
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,223
You the one sneakin' up on...

14
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,933
Babe, what you doin'?

15
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,687
You're such a bad liar, Travis.

16
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,939
You're right, I can't lie to you.

17
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,483
That's why I love you,
'cause you be knowing me.

18
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,235
Babe, you acting a lil' weird.

19
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,320
Got a court case today.

20
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,613
And it's big...

21
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,992
Okay, big day, butterflies, generally...

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,327
-Exactly, just a little...
-Okay.

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,964
Okay, anyway, so which shoe
shall I wear today?

24
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,133
That's a good one. I like...

25
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,176
-the brown!
-Brown!

26
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,720
Good choice.

27
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,055
You know I make good choices, I chose you.

28
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,892
Okay, I am running super late.

29
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,603
You have a good day at work.

30
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,564
[Courtney] I love you. Love you.

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,190
-I love you too.
-Bye, have a good day.

32
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,233
All right, you too.

33
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,985
-[Travis] Love you, girl.
-[Courtney] Love you too.

34
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,823
[music continues]

35
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,629
[gasps]

36
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,423
[laughs]

37
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:30,400
Mr. Jenkins here
has repeatedly demonstrated

38
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,779
an immense lack of self control...

39
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:38,450
[aggressively] What? Those are lies!
Lies, lies, lies!

40
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:43,205
Counselor, control your client, or I will
have him removed from this courtroom.

41
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,957
...as demonstrated in front
of you all today.

42
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,543
[Mr. Jenkins] Object, object. I'm not
going to win, I'm not going to win!

43
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,003
Objection, Your Honor,

44
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,173
my client has done nothing more
than express his religious freedoms.

45
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,926
In fact, the last time I checked,
the practice of voodoo

46
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,595
is legal in this country, and it is absurd

47
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,098
that the counselor and Mrs. Jenkins

48
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,601
have attacked my client's personal
and religious freedoms

49
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,896
in these court proceedings,
all for the sole purpose of monetary gain,

50
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,231
might I add?

51
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,691
-We got this one in the bag.
-I hope so.

52
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,984
I'm paying you guys enough.

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,491
Your Honor, it is his religious beliefs
that are in question here.

54
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,534
Overruled.

55
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,121
-You may proceed, Mr. Stanley.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

56
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,331
As we will prove,

57
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,376
it was only after his many infidelities

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,880
that he decided to choose
this new "religious" path,

59
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:38,969
which includes the many perks
of male polyamory and polygamy.

60
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,931
Neither of which did my client,
Miss Jenkins, agree to

61
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,558
on the onset of their marriage,

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,186
proving that Mr. Solomon Jenkins here

63
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:55,444
was just a squirrel
that tried to get his nut and keep it.

64
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,161
You killed 'em!

65
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,163
Squirrel that tried to keep his nut?

66
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,539
Man, really!

67
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,666
Did you see Mr. Clancy in the back?

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,793
-I did see him.
-He was even laughing.

69
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,879
That's 14 in a row, baby, we're on a roll.

70
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,715
Clancy and Lynch and Associates.
Here we go, boy!

71
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,675
[both exclaiming indistinctly]

72
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,804
You boys were amazing!

73
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,183
Thank you so much. I feel like I have
a new lease on life.

74
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,978
Don't mention it, Miss Jenkins.
It's our job.

75
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,938
Call me Wanda.

76
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,614
Thank you, Wanda.

77
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,324
You boys be good.

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,451
Or bad...

79
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,207
-I think it was the cologne.
-Got to be the cologne.

80
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,459
-Got to get you some.
-I can give...

81
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,422
[Rosie] Yeah, boss,
I had a real good weekend.

82
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,424
Got myself a new lil' thang.

83
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,092
Girl, he was working it out with...

84
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,054
What's goin' on with you, boss?
You're not acting like yourself.

85
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,848
I'm okay. Just thinking.

86
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,767
So, whose ass do I need to kick?

87
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,020
Rosie, everything is fine.

88
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,481
Just got a lot on my mind.

89
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,982
Can my teeth be on your mind?

90
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,734
I just wanna get outta here.

91
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,820
-Jesus!
-[Rosie] Now, wait a minute.

92
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,197
We don't take the Lord's name
in vain here.

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,199
Okay, you gotta get your energy together.

94
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,035
-Sorry.
-Tell Jesus that you're sorry.

95
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,578
Sorry, Jesus.

96
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,997
[Rosie] Thank you, that's good.

97
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,124
Your mother raised you well.
At least you got a lil' bit of manners.

98
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,128
I'll make you feel real good,
right about now.

99
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,591
Talking smart to me,
calling Jesus' name in vain,

100
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,552
I'm so sick of these people,
I don't know what to do,

101
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,055
Look at his hair. What's...

102
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,641
Now, he'll be out for ten minutes,
so you need to spill it.

103
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,979
Travis is gonna propose.

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,606
How do you know?

105
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,024
I found the ring.

106
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,027
You nosy-ass heifer.

107
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,238
Girl, congratulations!

108
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,115
Court, this is exciting.

109
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,159
Oh, my God! I'm just gonna be an amazing
maid of honor, I know I'm gonna be it.

110
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,578
'Cause we gonna be turnin' it up.

111
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,955
Girl, I got this solo move,
I wanna turn it up.

112
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,624
[in a sing-song voice] Turn it up. What!

113
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,377
I'm doin' it, I'm turnin' it up,
but you ain't turnin' it up.

114
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,628
Ain't you excited?

115
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,921
Of course, I am.

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,507
Travis is amazing.

117
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,677
I couldn't see myself
being with anybody else.

118
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,846
Okay, so then, what's the problem?

119
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,056
Travis hasn't met my family yet.

120
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,855
My family is very strict,
very traditional, and very Korean.

121
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,065
Okay, so then why hasn't he met them?

122
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,610
I think Travis is a little insecure
about my father.

123
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,196
So, I assume that you met his family.

124
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,573
That's another thing.

125
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,533
-Court...
-I haven't met them yet either.

126
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,701
Unbelievable.

127
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,623
I've talked to his mom on the phone,
but I've never met them face to face.

128
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,958
What if they don't like me in person?

129
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,835
What if they don't think I fit in?

130
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,920
Now, come on,
you know that's an impossibility.

131
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,339
You know that.

132
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,008
I just want us to be
one big, happy family,

133
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,301
-You know?
-I do.

134
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,639
And I know how important it is to Travis
for my dad to like him.

135
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,183
Okay, so then, what are you gonna do?

136
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,977
Pray?

137
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,437
Now, prayer's very good.

138
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,397
Yeah, I'll be praying with you,

139
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,108
but I'll be praying for us to turn it up!

140
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,611
Girl, 'cause I got these new moves...

141
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,363
-Girl...
-All right.

142
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,073
-[Rosie] Wake up.
-[Courtney] Wake his ass up.

143
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,699
All right, Steve, you ready?

144
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,659
[Steve] Yeah.

145
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,870
[Courtney] All right. Okay, all right.

146
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,330
Thank you, girl.

147
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:36,998
Open up.

148
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,627
Ah...

149
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,420
[Courtney] Ew!

150
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,678
[Travis] So what you think?

151
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:54,683
Are we the two new hotshot attorneys
at Clancy Lynch and associates?

152
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,102
I felt pretty good about myself today.

153
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,728
[both talking excitedly]

154
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,940
[John] That's what I like to see.

155
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,858
You guys are always working.

156
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,113
Great work today, fellas.
You guys really pulled it off.

157
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,115
Thank you, Mr. Clancy.

158
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,158
You guys should be
really proud of yourselves.

159
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,161
I don't remember seeing
a rookie win record like that

160
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,622
since... Hell, myself.

161
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,751
-That's a good thing, right?
-Yes, of course, it is.

162
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,253
We got our eye on you two.

163
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,630
I specially got my eye on you, young man.

164
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,800
Travis, you got a bright future
ahead of you.

165
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,884
Thank you, Mr. Clancy.

166
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,555
Yeah, well, you know what, call me John.
You're part of the family now.

167
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,936
This is the pen!

168
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,731
The board voted, and they will make
their official announcement

169
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,815
on Monday morning.

170
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,319
I don't know what to say!

171
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,946
-John...
-Don't say anything.

172
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,950
Look, just show up at work
on Monday morning,

173
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,244
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
ready to work.

174
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,706
I expect you to arrive early
and leave late, just like me.

175
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,875
-Just like you.
-Just like me. Good.

176
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,004
Let me get outta here before my wife
sends out the FBI for me.

177
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,382
But anyway, you guys
enjoy yourselves tonight, you deserve it.

178
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,301
-Have a drink on me.
-Thank you...

179
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,261
John!

180
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,431
[both whisper in amazement]

181
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,892
[both start shouting excitedly]

182
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,831
-I take it you won your case today?
-Yeah.

183
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,208
Fourteen in a row.

184
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,339
Ugh! Smells like Joey drowned you
in shots.

185
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,924
Yeah.

186
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,384
Joey went for the big one tonight.

187
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,930
I swear, that boy will never change.

188
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,849
Get some rest, babe. I'm proud of you.

189
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,313
[sleepily] After this weekend
our whole lives are just gonna change.

190
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,941
"You're part of the family now."

191
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,110
[mouthing] What?

192
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,546
[phone rings]

193
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,591
Boy, didn't I tell you
I just don't feel like it?

194
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,468
if your thirsty ass call me
one more damn time...

195
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,636
Rosie, it's me.

196
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,264
He's gonna ask to marry him this weekend.

197
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,308
He's gonna ask you to marry him
this weekend!

198
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,352
Girl, yes. What do I do?

199
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,395
Calm down.

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,647
I mean, girl, I was in my deep REM sleep.

201
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,859
I still got my damn mask on.
Okay, how do you know for sure?

202
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:55,113
'Cause he just came in here drunk,
and he said, and I quote,

203
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,283
"After this weekend our whole lives
are gonna change."

204
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,450
Then, he passed out.

205
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,414
Oh, my gosh, girl, he's gonna ask you
to marry him!

206
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,249
Okay, so what you gonna do?

207
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,168
Girl, I don't know,
that's why I called you.

208
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,502
Okay, right.

209
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,298
I want him to ask me really bad,

210
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,967
but I know if he does it
before he meets my family,

211
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,219
my dad will not respect him.

212
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,470
Travis will be crushed.

213
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,891
-Is it really that serious, Court?
-You have not met John Clancy.

214
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,268
My dad was a judge for 20 years.

215
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,062
He sentenced men to death
without even batting an eye.

216
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,063
Damn!

217
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,985
Okay, so why don't you invite your parents
over or something?

218
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,403
Girl, I can't do that.

219
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,280
They are at our vacation home
for the weekend.

220
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,573
It's Korean new year.

221
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,451
-I'm totally screwed.
-No, you are not.

222
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,579
It just seems like you have
a lot of arrangements to make, boss lady.

223
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,623
I mean, either you get them together,

224
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,917
or my man shoot himself in the foot.

225
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,502
I think it will be better this way.

226
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,255
Ultimately, if you're lucky,

227
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,925
he might propose
right in front of everyone.

228
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,176
[Rosie laughs]

229
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,220
Okay, I'll figure it out,
I'm gonna invite his parents.

230
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,306
-I love you.
-Love you too, bye.

231
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,353
[mutters in annoyance]

232
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,314
I gotta get myself ready for this wedding.

233
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,441
...break my concentration.

234
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,109
Shut up.

235
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,415
[Courtney] Good morning, sleepyhead,
rise and shine.

236
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,668
I've made you some breakfast.
Come on, get up.

237
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,628
We've got a lot goin' on today.

238
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,214
[Travis] Why you hittin' me?

239
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,591
What do we have to do today?

240
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,304
Well, I was thinking,
this is the first full weekend off

241
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,433
that you've had in like, forever,
and I wanted to make the best of it,

242
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,102
so I planned us a getaway trip.

243
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,730
Baby, that was so sweet. You just wanna
spend a lil' time with your man.

244
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,232
-Man, I see.
-Of course!

245
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,608
You little kitty. Oh, wait!

246
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,194
[screams]

247
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,948
-Baby, why are... why're you doing...
-[stammers] What are you doing?

248
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,866
Your shoe is unzipped.

249
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,661
My shoe... Yeah, my shoe!

250
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,581
-Yeah. Okay.
-What's going on with you this morning?

251
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,375
Thank you!

252
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,170
Okay, I just need you to get ready,
and our flight leaves in two hours.

253
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,506
Okay, let me just go pack
my bag real quick.

254
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,591
No, babe, I've already packed
our bags. Look.

255
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,511
And I packed your favorite pajamas.

256
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,848
Girl, you so sweet. You just own it.

257
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,641
-Let me go get in the shower.
-Okay.

258
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,393
Oh, girl!

259
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,062
All right, that was nothing,
you said you were gonna spank me.

260
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,027
[slow music playing]

261
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,287
Baby, what do you have in this bag?

262
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,705
I packed everything.

263
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,873
I see.

264
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,834
So, you sure you have everything?
You ready to go?

265
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,836
Yeah, I think... Oh!

266
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,213
Whoa! [sheepishly] What are you doing?

267
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,508
-It was my shoelace...
-Just leave it.

268
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,718
You'll be sitting
more than standing anyway.

269
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,178
-Come on you, you ready? Let's go.
-Yeah, I got it.

270
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,637
-You sure?
-Yeah.

271
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,475
[pop song playing]

272
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,121
Babe, this don't look like a hotel.

273
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,791
Yeah, not exactly.

274
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,377
Babe, I haven't been
completely honest with you

275
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,753
about this weekend.

276
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,881
We're not going to some fancy,
little exotic getaway,

277
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,842
-or anything like that.
-Well, clearly. I can see that.

278
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,761
But where'd you take me?

279
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,054
I, um...

280
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:53,101
I... I brought you
to meet my parents. Surprise!

281
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,103
-Yeah, so your parents?
-Yeah!

282
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,479
-It's their house?
-Yeah!

283
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,649
-Oh, okay.
-Don't... Don't be mad, okay?

284
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,859
-They're gonna love you.
-No, I'm not mad at all.

285
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,986
-Oh! That's my...
-[Sue] Is my baby here?

286
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,363
-Come on, let's get out.
-Let's get out.

287
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,698
[Courtney] Come on, let's... Gonna go...

288
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,991
[Travis] Your luggage. Yeah, I'm good.

289
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,201
[Courtney] Are you sure?

290
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,787
Okay, I'll meet you outside.

291
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,499
Mom!

292
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,173
Just like I taught you.

293
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,052
Dad, you're getting a little rusty.

294
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,595
You watch your mouth, young lady.

295
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,765
-Mommy!
-We didn't think you'd make it this year.

296
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,517
I know. Change of plans.

297
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,019
It wouldn't be a proper Seollal
without you.

298
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,564
-Aw, Daddy!
-So where is this young boul

299
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,982
that you've been raving about?

300
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,318
Yeah, he's in the car, getting the bags.

301
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,820
Babe, hurry with the bags.

302
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,029
-Come on.
-[John] Come on.

303
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,573
-[Courtney] Okay.
-[John] Yo, you look great!

304
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,991
-I wait for him.
-Okay, Ma.

305
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,325
[John] Come on, we gotta catch up.

306
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,413
[Courtney] Oh, God! I am starving.

307
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,458
[Travis talking to himself]

308
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,170
Can't believe this.

309
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,632
Thought we was goin' on a vacation.

310
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,801
No, we gonna meet the parents. [grunts]

311
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,845
[Travis laughs]

312
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,639
You must be Travis.

313
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,684
You must be Mrs. Clancy.
So nice to finally meet you.

314
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,144
Oh, okay.

315
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:20,730
Again.

316
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,108
One more time...

317
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,028
Come, come, come, come inside.

318
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,988
-[Sue] You need help?
-No, I'm fine.

319
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,156
-[Sue] Good.
-Okay.

320
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,743
[Sue] You know you look like
that LL COOL J.

321
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,286
Anybody telling you that one?

322
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,622
No. Thank you.

323
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,665
-[John] Maybe we can...
-A shower, and then, we can go.

324
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,833
[John] That would be good.

325
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,877
Travis, this is my dad, John Clancy.

326
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,422
-Daddy, this my...
-Travis Stanley.

327
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,216
You know him?

328
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,718
I no understand.

329
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,721
[stutters] Wait a minute, is this a joke?

330
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,099
No, it's... It's not a joke at all.

331
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,101
Mr. Clancy, I... I can explain myself.

332
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,895
You're damn right, you better explain.

333
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,271
Travis, what's going on?

334
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,609
[stammers nervously] Baby,
I'm just looking to... See...

335
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:11,239
This, right there, this is not how
I seen it though,

336
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,657
at all in my head.

337
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,534
I bet the hell not.

338
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,993
[speaking Korean]

339
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,916
[nervously] I'd like a latte.

340
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,917
Travis.

341
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,087
-Okay, baby...
-Explain yourself.

342
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,172
I haven't been entirely forthcoming

343
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,759
-about where I've working for the past...
-[exclaiming] Oh, no!

344
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,555
-[Courtney] Oh, God!
-Mr. Clancy, I did not lie to you,

345
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,517
-but I wasn't entirely forthcoming...
-Just spit it out.

346
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,104
Babe, I've been working at your dad's firm
for the past six months.

347
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,023
-Great.
-Mr. Clancy, I've been happily,

348
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,233
but respectfully,

349
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,695
dating your daughter
for the past eight months.

350
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,612
What?

351
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,907
-Oh, no! Oh, no!
-Mama's going down.

352
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,619
Come here, get your hands off her.

353
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,163
[angrily] You see what you did?

354
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,167
Wake up.

355
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,297
Uh... Um...

356
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,383
Baby?

357
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,220
[John] You rotten,
low-down son of a bitch.

358
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:20,016
Mr. Clancy, I know you must be very angry.

359
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,559
Billy Clapton.

360
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,519
Who... Who's Billy Clapton?

361
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,565
Billy Clapton was the last rotten,
low-down son of a bitch

362
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,860
that tried to use my daughter
to gain my favor.

363
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,031
Oh, damn!

364
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,783
-That's Billy?
-Yeah.

365
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,828
Billy broke my little girl's heart,

366
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,331
so I had to make him disappear.

367
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,750
Mr. Stanley, you understand?

368
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,376
[stammers] I do, now.

369
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,504
Is there anything else you need to tell me
about yourself?

370
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,922
No.

371
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,300
And you're not using my daughter

372
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,344
for your own, personal gain?

373
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,221
Only time will tell.

374
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,682
Now, get out of my office.

375
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,897
What the hell is wrong with you, Travis?

376
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,608
Why didn't you tell me
you're applying to my dad's firm?

377
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,902
Because I didn't want you
to help me get in.

378
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,279
Okay, so?

379
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,782
Okay, so, I wanted to get in on my own.

380
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,284
So, this was just some masculine thing?

381
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,536
No, it wasn't just some masculine thing.

382
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,498
I was trying to avoid
exactly what's going on right now.

383
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,751
Look, I didn't want you to think
I was just dating you

384
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,294
because you're the boss' daughter.

385
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,005
I knew if you saw me get it on my own,

386
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,925
then you wouldn't question
my love for you.

387
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,135
Babe, I'm sorry.

388
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,682
Fine, I believe you.

389
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,558
Thank God.

390
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,602
So, what now?

391
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,522
Uh... Google, flights,
we are packing this up.

392
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,816
-Babe, we cannot leave.
-Yes, we can.

393
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,361
Did you see how your dad looked at me?
I was...

394
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,198
As a matter of fact,
who was Billy Clapton?

395
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,491
Where did you hear that name?

396
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,119
You dad, he called me Billy Clapton.

397
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:08,124
Billy Clapton was my ex,
a few years back in college.

398
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,877
I thought he loved me, but I found out

399
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,047
he was only using me
because he knew who my father was,

400
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,133
and he wanted to be a part of his firm.

401
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,343
Exactly why I didn't want
to say anything, you see...

402
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,054
Wait, what happened to Billy Clapton?

403
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,264
I have no clue.

404
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,808
I told daddy about him,
and I never heard from Billy again.

405
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,311
Oh, no.
I'm dead, your dad is gonna kill me.

406
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,815
He gonna hide the body
somewhere with his lil' judge friends.

407
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,358
And they ain't gonna find my body.

408
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,193
-He'd never go to jail 'cause...
-This is gonna be

409
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,820
a lot harder than I thought.

410
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,907
-Google, flights, pack...
-My dad will never respect you.

411
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,993
...'cause I'm not about to die over this.

412
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,327
We cannot leave.

413
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,830
I think we done past the respect point.

414
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,790
Did you see how you daddy
was looking at...

415
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,335
Travis, just give my dad a chance
to get to know you

416
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,045
so he can see how amazing you are.

417
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,422
You're nothing like Billy.

418
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,675
All right, what are we up against?
Tell me what's going on. Why are we here?

419
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,845
Well, this is my mother's
favorite holiday.

420
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,306
So, my dad takes it very seriously.

421
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,892
-Babe, we can do this.
-Yes, we can.

422
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,686
We're gonna get through this together,
we're a team.

423
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,481
As Bonnie and Clyde. Me and you, girl.

424
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,941
-[Courtney] Hi!
-[Sue] Honey!

425
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,112
We will begin Sebae shortly,
and then, have dinner after.

426
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,490
-Travis, will you be joining us...
-[Courtney] No, no, no, no!

427
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,284
Oh, yes! Travis is all about the Sabbath.

428
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,119
Imma be all up in there with y'all.

429
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,706
Terrific, will you be needing a hanbok,
or did you bring your own?

430
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,874
No, I got my own handbook.

431
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,251
I write in it all the time.
I write my poems in there.

432
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,378
No. Hanbok.

433
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,088
That's the same.

434
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,508
[hesitantly] Yeah. No, I don't...
What's that?

435
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,427
[Sue] Don't worry, I think John have
extra one.

436
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,012
Thanks, Mom.

437
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,182
Handbook? Really?

438
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,100
Handbook, hanbok, it's all the same...

439
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,312
That's your good dress.

440
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,858
[gong rings]

441
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,568
[exotic music plays]

442
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,867
How wonderful? Very good, Travis.

443
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,297
That hanbok is a antique from Korea.

444
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,132
It is priceless.

445
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,927
Anything should happen to it,

446
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,220
you die.

447
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,556
It's very nice, Mr. Clancy.

448
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:29,932
It's just a little long, but...

449
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,684
[speaking Korean]

450
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,649
Dad, please!

451
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,070
Travis, this is a tradition
known as a Sebae.

452
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,321
Everybody move over.

453
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,200
It is done to honor one's elders.

454
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,328
Okay, yeah, I'm all about honoring
one's elders,

455
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,080
'cause I used to work at Walmart

456
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,332
and when the elders came in,
I 'd just hold the door for 'em.

457
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,918
-Some will be in a little wheelchair...
-Babe, babe, babe.

458
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,045
Okay, they get it.

459
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,339
-Sorry.
-Okay, this is very simple.

460
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,051
All you have to do is bow down
to mom and dad four times,

461
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,303
and say a little phrase.

462
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,637
Okay, what's the phrase?

463
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,848
[speaking Korean]

464
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,100
Okay, everybody kneeling down.

465
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,646
It means, "Please receive
a lot of luck in the new year."

466
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,316
Very important in Korean tradition

467
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,902
to properly begin Seollal
with good fortune.

468
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,030
Here, you may observe

469
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:30,451
as we pay respect to my mother
and the father. Okay?

470
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,910
-Ready?
-Ready.

471
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,831
[chanting Korean]

472
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,798
Now, we do the same think for mom and dad.

473
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,301
I'll give it a whirl. [laughs]

474
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,636
[John laughs sarcastically]

475
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:53,390
This custom deserves much more
than you giving it a whirl.

476
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,391
Daddy.

477
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,395
[Courtney] Ready? Babe?

478
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,564
Ready? Okay.

479
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,441
[chanting in Korean]

480
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,026
[Travis mispronouncing]
Say about the mini bad hoes.

481
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,249
-[robe rips]
-Oh!

482
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,459
Ooh!

483
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,628
Oh, no!

484
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,632
[whimpers]

485
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,050
Oh, oops!

486
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,343
[John shrieks in anger]

487
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,678
[grits teeth in anger]

488
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,429
I stepped on it.

489
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,431
[shouting in Korean]

490
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,810
Anybody got a needle and thread?

491
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,229
[doorbell rings]

492
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,399
Babe! Oh, my gosh!

493
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,820
I totally forgot, I have the biggest
surprise for you. Come, come, come!

494
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,156
[mouthing words inaudibly]

495
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,408
[Courtney giggling]

496
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,785
You guys, come, come, come, come!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

497
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,288
Okay, Travis, I have the biggest
surprise for you! [squeals]

498
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,707
Okay, you ready?

499
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,834
Yeah, babe, I'm ready. Another surprise.

500
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,919
[exclaims] I invited your family.

501
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,379
[Dingo exclaiming in amazement]

502
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,256
Lord! Lord! Lord!

503
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,217
Nip, look at this, Oh, my goodness!

504
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,928
Baby, our son done landed
in a pot of honey.

505
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,640
-He done come up like 7Up!
-Came up like a Mountain Dew!

506
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,934
-[in a sing-song voice] Won't they do it?
-[Dingo] Won't they?

507
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,644
[Nip] Yes. Where's my baby at?

508
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,063
Where PP at? PP?

509
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,982
PP, where you at, babe?

510
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,277
-PP...
-There he is, Ma. I see him.

511
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,863
PP?

512
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,240
The heck! What you got on, boy?

513
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,325
[exclaiming in shock]

514
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,161
That's my baby...

515
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,079
[Nip] Move, that's my baby!

516
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,749
Gimme the Tazin.

[gong rings]

689
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,132
[Nip] Oh, my God!
Dingo, come look at this.

690
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,177
Look at this, this is amazing!

691
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,680
[Dingo] Ooh, Lord, look at that!

692
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,767
That is real fancy dancy, ain't it, baby?

693
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,768
[Nip] Yes, it is.

694
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,811
Looks like the Last Supper. Is that Jesus?

695
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,813
[laughing loudly]

696
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,858
Reminds me of that buffet I went to
down in Boca Luce.

697
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,487
Fancy dancy!

698
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,740
PP, you've done good, boy.

699
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,993
Hold on now. Wait a minute.
Sarge, you need to help me here.

700
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,580
-[Nip] Come on, help your daddy...
-[Dingo groans loudly]

701
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,083
[Dingo] Oh, Lord Jesus!

702
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,629
Mom, Dad, why do you all
have on those robes?

703
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:11,841
Baby, come on, we saw all y'all
in your little fancy robes.

704
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,844
I didn't know if it was gonna be
a toga party or an orgy.

705
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,513
[Nip and Dingo laughs]

706
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,224
We didn't wanna mess up on the tradition.

707
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,393
-Didn't we?
-We did our research.

708
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,562
-[gong rings loudly]
-Oh, my God!

709
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,355
Man, you gonna give me a heart attack!

710
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,941
Need to give a nigga a warning first.

711
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,318
I think I squirted. Excuse me.

712
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,905
[chef] Good evening, lady and gentleman.

713
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:38,118
[greeting each other in Korean]

714
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,747
Say, that's like some voodoo shit.

715
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,251
-Who is that?
-I don't know.

716
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,128
-Why you asking me?
-My name is Ho-Jin

717
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,046
Oh, who?

718
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:54,134
He... He's a premier chef from Korea.

719
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,636
He's gonna be serving us all weekend.

720
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,974
[Dingo] Nip, he kinda looks Chinese to me.

721
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,436
All Asians ain't Chinese, okay?
And he's from Korea.

722
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,439
So that means he's Korean/Asian.

723
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,357
Look like a white guy to me.

724
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,775
No, Snow White.

725
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,444
She the dwarf.

726
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,780
John, you did outdone yourself.

727
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,159
He done flown that man
all the way from Cholerea.

728
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,454
How much did that set you back, John?

729
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,913
It's Korea,

730
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,958
and probably more than you could fathom.

731
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,212
What? You tryin' to be funny, John?
I couldn't fathom?

732
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,339
What you mean by that?

733
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:38,094
I'd get some of that teriyaki chicken
with some of them ol' sweet and sour pork.

734
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,722
Lemme get that egg-drop soup,

735
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,351
and I want the two egg rolls
with the sweet and sour sauce.

736
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,019
-What you want, baby?
-I want the orange flavored chicken...

737
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,022
[Dingo] And my wife want the orange
flavored chicken and the fried rice.

738
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,691
I'm just saying right now,
ain't got no cash on me, I give you...

739
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,943
[Courtney] Wait, wait, guys.
This is not that kind of dinner.

740
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,613
-It's already...
-[Sarge] Actually, I'll go

741
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,783
with the teriyaki chicken
with that broccoli.

742
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,201
-Don't get that...
-You know I gotta stay on my health.

743
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:05,163
You never know when a man gotta go
back to war.

744
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,583
You actually fought in the war?

745
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,420
Little lady, butchered hundred of bodies

746
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,964
with these bare hands.

747
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,174
[exclaims in amazement]

748
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,426
He lie like a rug.

749
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,179
[slaps the table in rage and shouts]

750
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,305
Please...

751
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,768
This is not a Chinese restaurant.

752
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,561
No, no, no, no.

753
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,980
Your meal is being catered.

754
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,526
This is not an all-you-can-eat buffet.

755
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,987
There's no need to place your order.

756
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,367
So, can we please get back
to this evening?

757
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,619
His ass better stop spitting on me.

758
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,246
-[Dingo] Let me say something to you.
-[chef] Thank you, kitchen...

759
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,164
You need to stop yelling at me
and my family.

760
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,708
That's some bullshit.

761
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,334
[Nip] Now, we sitting up here
in this man's house

762
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,961
at his little-bitty-ass table, okay?

763
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,171
If he wanna act that way, just let him.

764
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,549
-We're here for the children, all right?
-Children. That's right.

765
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,676
Thank you. Thank you, Napetheria.

766
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:05,056
Oh, please! It's Niphateria Lorraine
James [clicks tongue] Stankershet.

767
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,393
I don't need an echo.

768
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,812
You need to fix this shit, PP.

769
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,442
Mr. Clancy, I'm sure my parents
mean no disrespect.

770
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,694
-They're probably just a little tired...
-And hungry.

771
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,572
And they're just
not used to your wife's customs.

772
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,407
No need to apologize.

773
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:28,413
[speaking Korean]

774
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,963
I'm sorry for my actions and my outburst.

775
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,757
As you should be.

776
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,050
Apology accepted.

777
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,679
[Nip] Okay, this is him
when he was a baby.

778
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,515
-[Nip laughs]
-[Dingo] Look at that...

779
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,059
[everyone speaking together]

780
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,811
We don't wanna see photo albums...

781
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,606
He wasn't cross-eyed, he was cockeyed.

782
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,900
You never knew which way
he was looking to. He was here,

783
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,735
he was there, he was like... [cackles]

784
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,112
Oh, Lord, his hair was so nappy!

785
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,865
I couldn't even get a comb through it,
unless I put a perm in it.

786
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,577
And this is him
in his pink Power Rangers pajamas.

787
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,330
-So cute!
-You know what,

788
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,333
this boy used to wear pink so much,
he loved pink.

789
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,375
Made me nervous.

790
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,585
Yeah, made me scared.

791
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,544
[Dingo] I was worried.

792
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,131
Nigga loved pink so much
I thought he gonna be a goddamn princess.

793
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,842
I mean, not that I've got anything
against princesses.

794
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,427
-No, you know, baby.
-He would have been

795
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,762
the only goddamn princess in office.

796
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,014
Mamma, we don't need the pictures...

797
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,183
Honey, is that when you peed on yourself?

798
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,976
[Stankershets laughing]

799
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,853
How sweet!

800
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,023
Hey! Mamma, put the pictures away,

801
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:41,027
okay, and can we just focus
on something little more positive.

802
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,320
Yeah, Dad, what was your news?

803
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,532
-Now is not the time.
-Now is as good a time as any, dear.

804
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,535
-I don't know.
-Something better happen,

805
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,786
'cause I'm hungry.

806
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,413
-Daddy, come on, what is it?
-Your father has decided

807
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,873
to run for office!

808
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,917
Yeah, everybody clapping!

809
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,380
But daddy, that is amazing.

810
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,259
It's just the State Senate.
Nothing's set in stone.

811
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,513
Come on, the Governor is going to be here
in two days.

812
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,683
If your father gain his endorsement,

813
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:17,105
he going to be the... No, having the...
Shoe up...

814
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,482
-[John] In
-[Sue] Shoe in.

815
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,234
In what?

816
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,320
Anyway, he have the shoe somewhere.

817
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,074
-Daddy, that is so great.
-I bet you running as a Republican.

818
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,034
As a matter of fact, yes, I am.

819
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,578
You gt a problem with that?

820
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,497
I see you living well, John.
You done all right for yourself,

821
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,541
down here in Uncle Tom's cabin,

822
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,043
or should I say [in Korean accent]
Mister Wong's cabin.

823
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,296
[speaking Korean]

824
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,090
Speak English, nigga.

825
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:49,178
I said your ghetto ass is ignorant.

826
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,138
[Dingo] Son of a bitch!

827
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,848
I will give it to him.

828
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,182
[Nip shouting] Stop it.

829
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,184
[the Stankershets shouting]

830
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,603
[Dingo] No, you're the ignorant.

831
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,146
No, we can't do this shit, man. Come on...

832
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,106
[John shrieking in anger]

833
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:04,986
[Nip] Hey, okay, wait a minute.
Wait a damn minute.

834
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,655
[John] I have never in my entire life...

835
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,741
What a spectacle!

836
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,118
Ruined my entire dinner.

837
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,370
The unmitigated gall.

838
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,874
John, you did not have to be so abrasive.

839
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,751
Me?

840
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,130
These people come in,
and ruin my entire evening.

841
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,592
-And you're finding me at fault.
-It's no one's fault, John.

842
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,344
It's just is what it is.

843
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,347
Our daughter, she is in love
with that young man.

844
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,558
And the PP, he in love with her too.

845
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,269
And we should just accept him
and his family,

846
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,395
and leave it at that.

847
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,481
[sarcastically] Yeah, love, love.

848
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,108
Well, the jury is still out on that.

849
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:53,409
[seductively] John! John!

850
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,416
Have you noticed what I wearing to bed?

851
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,755
-Look at all this.
-Yes, I see all this.

852
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:11,010
Okay, Sue, you gotta...
I don't have time for your shenanigans.

853
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,178
I'm tired.

854
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,763
Shenanigans?

855
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,350
John Clancy, you promised me we would
take advantage

856
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:22,146
of our time together this weekend
to strengthen our relationship.

857
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,068
Yeah, but... Really, sweetheart, you don't
expect me to pounce on you

858
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,863
when our home is being invaded.

859
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,408
Sue! Invaded!

860
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:38,079

invaded around here for a change.

-No, you said you are going to hit that,

863
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,088
or tap that ass, or something like that.

864
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,965
-I was...
-Nothing happening here.

865
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,134

867
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,430
It's negligee, honey.

868
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,517

All right, go to sleep...

871
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,441
All right, ooh, I'll tap that ass.

-That doesn't count.
-All right.

873
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,779

-God damn!
-Vagina filled with cobweb now.

875
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,952

883
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,013
Definitely surprised.

884
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,975
We're glad to be here.

885
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:45,438
You tell that little lady of yours
that we apologize for everything.

886
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,731
Don't apologize for me.

887
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,277
-Dingo.
-She should be apologizing to us

888
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,404
for having Satan as her dad.

889
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,406
Dingo, I don't need
to hear all that right now.

890
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,200
I don't get it, son.

891
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,162
-What do you see in these people?
-Mr. Clancy is my boss.

892
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:04,290
Okay? And his daughter is the love
of my life.

893
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,793
Shit! What does love gotta do with this?

894
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,212
Gettin' yourself all mixed up
with these kinda people.

895
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,922
It's not worth it, son.

896
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,591
-Just try to make this work.
-We will.

897
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,011
-I ain't gonna promise.
-We will make it work.

898

Speak for yourself.

899
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,014
Thank you, Mamma.

900

-Love you, guys.
-All right, love you too, honey.

904
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,068
Close the door behind you, baby.

906
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,447
I am done with you.

907
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,575
And we ain't seen that boy, what,
in a month of Sundays?

908
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,829
The first thing you wanna do
after that girl done flew us out here,

909
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,247
first class...

910
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,748
you're gonna show your ass.

911
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,127
I got something to show you,
but it ain't gonna be my ass.

912
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,253
I ain't playing with you, Dingo.

913
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:54,006
Come on, Nip. Don't make more outta this
than it is.

914
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,217
Make more out of it?
What are you talking about?

915
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,721
We promised Travis Avante that we would
come out here and we would support him.

916
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,390
I'm sorry.

917
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,766
Travis.

918
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,019
Now, Travis needs to know that.

919
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,439
He needs to feel that from you.
He needs to feel that from the family.

920
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,941
He needs to feel it from all of us.

921
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,943
Okay, sugar cheeks.

922
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,864
All I'm saying is I don't wanna see
our son, PP,

923
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,657
turn into one of those diddy folks.

924
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,785
If that is what he chooses to do,
then, baby, let him do it.

925
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,079
Okay, he loves that girl.

926
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,875
And it ain't up to us to question that.

927
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,755
I need you to promise me you gonna be
on your best behavior this weekend,

928
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,301
or no sweet cheeks for you for a month.

-A month?
-A month. You wanna make it two?

930
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,473
Two months? I can't do without that thing
for two months.

931

Wanna get some now? Get some later?
Ooh, I can't stand your ass.

932

I don't know what you been doing to me.
Damn you, Dingo.

Came all the way out here.
I'm gonna give you something.

-I promise.
-You promise you're gonna be

938
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,034

939
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,454
I promise, mommy.

940

Dingo!

945
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,055
I'm so sorry.

946
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,724
It's completely my fault.

947
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,147
Actually, it's my fault.

948
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,193
I should have told your Dad.
I should have told you.

949
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,987
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

950
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,784
We can't lose sight of what's important.

951
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,246
That's me and you,
and our future together.

Come on, you need to get up. Gotta go.

Okay, we can go, but there's
just something that I have to tell you.

before we leave.

-[Dingo] Let me tell you something, buddy.

1026
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,212
I was the best junior varsity running-back

1027
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,880
to come out of Paschal High School.

1028
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,882
Class of 1972, baby!

1029
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,636
[John and Dingo arguing]

1030
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,473
I smell a challenge.

1031
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,267
[Stankershets] Challenge!

1032
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,605
-[Dingo] I'm ready.
-I got the pigskin right here!

1033
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:26,607
No, no challenge...

1034
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,025
[Stankershets and John arguing]

1035
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,027
[Sarge exclaims energetically]

1036
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,197
[hip hop music playing]

1037
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,992
Can I ask you something?

1038
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:40,454
You keep feeding me these margaritas,
you can ask me whatever the hell you want.

1039
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,914
How do you do it?

1040
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,332
How I do what, baby?

1041
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,169
You and Dingo. You have that spark,
you know.

1042
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,213
Always hot... On fire.

1043
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,339
Sexy time.

1044
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,883
Like he always down in you...

1045
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,093
Grill.

1046
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,679
Ooh! Girl, you turning me on right now.

1047
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,267
[hip hop music continues]

1048
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,654
Do you still love John?

1049
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,698
Of course.

1050
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,575
Without question, John is my whole world.

1051
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,746
I just don't know
if he's still attracted to me.

1052
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,748
Now, don't don't be sad
and all insecure, honey.

1053
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,126
Men can't stand that. Stop all of that.

1054
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,128
I'm gonna give you the rules, okay?

1055
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,047
First of all, you gotta trust in God.

1056
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,968
Okay, and then, when you're arguing,

1057
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,554
if becoming right becomes more important

1058
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,098
than being in love,
then you just gotta let it go. Okay?

1059
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,976
-Oh, preach!
-Hallelujah!

1060
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,854
Oh, and most importantly, girl,

1061
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:50,566
you have got to seduce your man.

1062
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,319
[Sue exclaims in happiness]

1063
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,449
[music continues]

1064
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,328
[Sue and Nip] Whoo!

1065
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,032
[music stops]

1066
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,702
You gotta make him think
that you would do anything

1067
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:46,121
that them heifers out on the streets
would do, and then some.

1068
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:49,249
So I have to do as much as them heifer?

1069
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,752
-No, you gotta be...
-Better than heifer?

1070
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,796
Girl, just be the heifer, the ho,
and all of that.

1071
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:57,966
Imma also give you the special recipe

1072
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:02,262
that I got for a very special cocktail.

1073
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,432
I call it the Stanky-leg Stankershet shot.

1074
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,559
[both exclaiming and laughing]

1075
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:11,230
Honey, I put this on Dingo
every time we go a few days without,

1076
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,775
and baby, presto, change-o!

1077
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,362
Oh, cock-tail! I make a joke.

1078
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,824
Could that make John go back
to secret garden?

1079
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,910
I've been whipping up that concoction
for ten years. Okay?

1080
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,287
And I'm telling you, I damn near needed
a hip replacement.

1081
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,373
You see why he walk with a stanky leg.

1082
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,168
He's not even pimp walking.
Hell, he limp walking.

1083
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,342
You ready? You ready for this?

1084
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,885
[Dingo] Y'all ain't ready, let's go.

1085
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,764
PP, did they hit your peanut?

1086
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,350
PP, here I come, baby! PP!

1087
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,644
[screaming] PP!

1088
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,814
[Nip] My baby is allergic to peanuts. PP!

1089
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,113
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Relax. Lay back down.

1090
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,658
You fainted earlier at the beach.
How do you feel?

1091
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,162
My throat is a little scratchy.

1092
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:13,792
My ass feels like a pincushion
but other than that I'm okay.

1093
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,378
Your face is still a little swollen.

1094
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:21,550
What? Why is my face swollen?
What happened?

1095
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,927
-Your brother put peanuts in your...
-Peanuts?

1096
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:27,347
[Courtney] Stop. Lay down. Just relax.

1097
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,892
It's a good thing your mom was there.

1098
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,852
What's that supposed to mean, Court?

1099
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,521
Why didn't you tell me
you're allergic to peanuts, Travis?

1100
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,858
As long as we've been together
you have never told me

1101
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,110
if you have a peanut,
you could possibly die.

1102
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,237
Because I had everything under control.

1103
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,115
Uh... obviously not. Look at your face.

1104
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,575
I can't look at my face.

1105
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,076
How was I supposed to know that my brother

1106
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,537
was gonna try to poison me
to win a stupid football game?

1107
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,665
This wasn't part of the plan, Travis.

1108
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,211
It also wasn't part of the plan for you
to bring my family here, Courtney.

1109
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,587
Your family wouldn't be here,

1110
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,715
if you would have just introduced
me sooner, like a normal boyfriend.

1111
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,509
You just filed them away

1112
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,220
in your little box of secrets,
Travis Deontay.

1113
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:08,096
Let's just face it.

1114
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,849
Maybe I don't know you
as well as I thought I did.

1115
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,105
-Really, Courtney?
-Really.

1116
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,857
You don't know me now?

1117
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,619
[sighs]

1118
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:35,040
So, like, is it true that you killed a man
with your bare hands?

1119
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,210
[Sarge] Woman, I kill hundreds.

1120
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,587
-Hundreds?
-Probably even thousands of 'em.

1121
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,923
Gettin' my numbers together.

1122
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,133
Shoo, I'm a Stankershet.

1123
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:48,929
Part of the mandingo tribe.
You know what I'm sayin'. [chuckles]

1124
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,307
But we gotta keep this on a hush-hush.

1125
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,685
I think Daddy Clancy might be on to us.

1126
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,353
You think my dad's on to us.

1127
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,064
Well... He's really caught up
in my brother.

1128
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,316
But he should worry about me.

1129
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,110
-[Sarge laughs]
-[Catherine] Mmm...

1130
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,570
Tell me more about war.

1131
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:08,532
[romantic song playing]

1132
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,742
[snoring]

1133
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,989
[phone beeps]

1134
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,879
[scoffs] What the hell!

1135
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,769
I'm ready to offer you
the Billy Clapton deal.

1136
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,562
Billy Clapton deal. What's that?

1137
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,023
Here's my offer. It's a one-time deal.

1138
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,652
If you leave this room,
the deal's off the table.

1139
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:27,903
I will hire you...

1140
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,948
at Clancy Lynch and Associates

1141
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,741
in our New York offices,

1142
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,411
and you'll be under contract employment
for eight years.

1143
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,956
-Mr. Clancy, I don't...
-Ten.

1144
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:44,670
For ten years you'll be at one of the top
law firms in America.

1145
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,339
You'll be able to write your own ticket
after that.

1146
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,258
All you have to do
is stay away from my daughter.

1147
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:51,885
What do you say?

1148
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,804
Before you answer...

1149
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,850
just know that if you decline my offer,

1150
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:03,897
not only will you not work
at Clancy Lynch and Associates,

1151
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:08,318
but I will ruin you.
I will blackball you so hard,

1152
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,822
you won't be able to judge
a pie eating contest. [guffaws]

1153
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,700
Your career would be over
before it begins.

1154
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,077
I'll let you think about that
for a moment.

1155
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,037
I gotta get ready for breakfast.

1156
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,043
You can use my pen.

1157
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,346
[chattering]

1158
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,514
Ho-Jin quit!

1159
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,891
Oh, no! What about the Governor dinner?

1160
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,019
Who tampered with the food?

1161
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,063
[muffled chattering]

1162
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:46,523
[John] Somebody did.

1163
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,150
Nobody tampered with the food.

1164
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:49,526
[Sue] What?

1165
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,488
-Fine, I did it.
-Oh!

1166
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,782
Okay, but I didn't mean no harm,
I'm sorry.

1167
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,284
PP, I'm sorry, baby.

1168
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,830
But I thought we could all use
a good meal.

1169
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,332
Back at home that's what we do.

1170
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:08,086
Families pray together, they eat together,
and they stay together.

1171
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,257
Hell, y'all ate all the food!
You ate yours too, didn't you?

1172
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,843
I ate some.

1173
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,804
Turn to your neighbor and say,
"It was delicious."

1174
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,556
[all] It was delicious.

1175
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,641
Whoo! Finger lickin' good!

1176
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,060
I'm... I'm sorry.

1177
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,853
[speaking Korean]

1178
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,354
[replies in Korean]

1179
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,862
[speaking Korean]

1180
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,284
All right, you... You know what?
I got enough of this.

1181
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,578
Yeah, all you hooligans out!

1182
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,538
-[Nip] Who's a hooligan?
-Now, wait a goddamn minute.

1183
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:44,956
We are not hooligans.

1184
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,500
Daddy, it's okay, it's okay.

1185
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,836
Don't ever disrespect my wife
in front of me.

1186
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,922
You done did it now!

1187
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:52,881
[Travis] Hey, hey, hey!

1188
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:56,676
[all clamor]

1189
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,936
That is enough, John Clancy.

1190
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,854
You stop that right now!

1191
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:15,278
All of you, get out of my house right now,
before I call the police.

1192
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,404
-Daddy!
-Out!

1193
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,740
-Come on, let's go.
-Out, out.

1194
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,326
Hell, I done wasted another outfit.

1195
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,830
-Come on, Courtney, let's go.
-Courtney is not goin' anywhere.

1196
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:28,416
She is a Clancy, and she always will be.

1197
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,046
It's okay, son.

1198
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,469
Let me tell you somethin',
I'm happy to leave,

1199
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,639
get back to the hood
where people are civilized.

1200
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:46,852
Well, that's a good thing, because I would
never allow my daughter to date trash.

1201
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,145
No problem.

1202
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,855
[Sue] Oh, no!

1203
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,523
[loudly] Oh, no!

1204
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:56,027
Yeah, you had that comin'.
You son of a bitch.

1205
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:02,033
[sirens wailing]

1206
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,712
[phone ringing]

1207
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,885
-Yo.
-[Travis] Joey! Joey!

1208
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,595
-Travis!
-Yeah, man.

1209
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:25,557
I'm in jail. I need you to do somethin'.
I need you to bail me out.

1210
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,100
What are you doin' in a jail cell?

1211
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:30,145
[stutters] I don't know, this has
just been the worst weekend ever.

1212
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:33,690
Can you explain to me how I lost
my girlfriend and my job

1213
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,902
all in the same day, because for the life
of me, I can't figure it out.

1214
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:37,903
You what?

1215
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:41,323
Look, man, I don't know what's goin' on,
but, look, hang tight.

1216
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,909
Imma make some calls, and Imma get you
out of there, all right?

1217
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,702
Okay, all right, all right. Hurry up.

1218
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,546
[door unbolts]

1219
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,927
I used to... I used to be an actor.

1220
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,724
Yeah, why did you quit?

1221
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,894
I just didn't...
I just didn't love it enough.

1222
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,021
You know...

1223
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,442
We only quit on the stuff
that we don't love.

1224
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,446
But what we do love... You gotta hold on.

1225
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:25,200
You got... Never let go.

1226
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,078
You have to let it go.

1227
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,247
Talkin' about... Trying to let this...
Tryin' to get...

1228
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,581
Man, you got a dollar?

1229
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,794
That's why you gotta stay in school.

1230
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,257
Mind is a terrible thing to waste,
isn't it?

1231
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,759
You're a mess, D.

1232
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,052
Amen, brother!

1233
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,346
Holla. No, no.

1234
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,765
You know, Papa,
you didn't have to hit him.

1235
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:54,312
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna let him
keep disrespecting you, son.

1236
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,566
But the reason we in here
is 'cause you cussed at the police.

1237
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,112
Well, I wasn't gonna let 'em
keep disrespecting my daddy.

1238
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:07,492
Son, I got a lot on my mind
I wanna talk to you about, man.

1239
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,620
I gotta be honest with you.

1240
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,124
You know, son, you really hurt
my feelings, man.

1241
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,421
What made you go off and change your name?

1242
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,506
I knew it, papa.

1243
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,883
This never had nothing to do
with the Clancys.

1244
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,303
Papa, you and me ain't been
the same since...

1245
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,472
Since I didn't wanna run
the family business.

1246
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:31,391
You better run that business,
you better...

1247
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,435
Help the family.

1248
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,437
Hey, hey, hey...

1249
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,318
My daddy's granddaddy passed it down
to him.

1250
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,695
My daddy passed it down to me.

1251
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:48,283
And I'm just disappointed, son,
that's what I wanted for you.

1252
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,036
And if it was good enough for them,
good enough for me,

1253
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,829
why wasn't it good enough for you?

1254
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:56,833
See, that's the thing. It's not that
it wasn't good enough for me, Papa.

1255
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,501
I just wanted something else.

1256
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,463
And if I remember correctly,

1257
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,007
you didn't want to run
the family business either.

1258
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,343
Yeah, you was trying to be
the next B. B. King

1259
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,053
on the saxophone.

1260
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,471
Lucille!

1261
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,433
-Man, please.
-[humming]

1262
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,604
I was pretty good on the saxophone.

1263
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,897
You were quite good with that.

1264
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:24,235
But the point is... I gave all that up
to run the family business.

1265
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,863
Dad, just because you gave up
your dreams...

1266
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,866
doesn't mean I have to be the same thing.

1267
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:35,705
[somber music playing]

1268
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,384
[phone beeps]

1269
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,154
[somber music continues]

1270
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,009
Look, I don't care where you get it from.
Just get it here now!

1271
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,326
As it stands, we have nothing to feed

1272
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,996
the Governor and his wife
except leftovers.

1273
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,624
You knew?

1274
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,170
-What?
-You knew that it wasn't about the job.

1275
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,797
You knew, and you still let him
get arrested.

1276
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:11,259
You let me let him walk out this house
in handcuffs!

1277
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:15,138
[stutters] What do we really know
about Travis and his family anyway?

1278
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,764
I know that he loves me.

1279
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,266
-So?
-Dad!

1280
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:21,769
All right, yes, I offered him a job,
but he turned it down.

1281
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:26,483
So you knew that he wanted to spend
the rest of his life with me,

1282
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,652
and you let him and his father
get arrested anyway?

1283
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,237
I didn't press charges.

1284
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,822
The man assaulted me.

1285
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:39,037
Listen, sweetheart,
they are not Clancy material.

1286
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:40,872
Now, they ruined our weekend,

1287
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,583
and possibly,
my chances with the Governor.

1288
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,085
What am I even still doing here?

1289
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,504
I'm gonna go get them out of jail.

1290
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,547
-See here, young lady...
-No, you see here,

1291
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:52,008
I don't care what Travis' real name is.

1292
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,052
I don't care about his peanut allergies,

1293
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,762
and I don't care if you don't like
his family.

1294
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,097
That's the man that I love,

1295
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:01,601
and hopefully, I'm gonna marry one day,
if I didn't screw that up already.

1296
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,521
Look, sweetheart, I just want

1297
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,272
-what's best for you...
-No, you only want

1298
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,982
what's best for yourself.

1299
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:10,443
You're gonna make
a fine politician one day.

1300
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,196
You're only good at stepping on others
for what you want.

1301
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,834
Mom, I just...

1302
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,844
What if I lost him forever, Mom?

1303
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,346
[softly] No...

1304
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,351
I should have been there for him.

1305
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:47,188
Why did I listen to dad, Mom?
Why did I listen?

1306
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:57,282
[Sue singing in Korean]

1307
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:12,088
[Korean song playing]

1308
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,239
We'll get him out in one second.
Just wait right here.

1309
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,618
Travis Ayontay and Henry Stankershet.

1310
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,494
[guy in cell laughs]

1311
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,204
Travis...[mutters]

1312
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,832
That's Travis Ayontay...

1313
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:55,340
Emmanuel Mount Zion
On-The-Rock [clicks tongue] Stankershet.

1314
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,977
Hi, I'd like to set bail
for Travis Ayontay Stankershet.

1315
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,812
-And Henry...
-I'd like to apologize, ma'am,

1316
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,522
but they've already made bail.

1317
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:12,857
They've already made bail?

1318
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,067
Yes, ma'am.

1319
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,319
Okay, thank you.

1320
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,203
-[dial tone ringing]
-[sighs]

1321
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,748
-Come on, Travis, pick up.
-Hey, you've reached Travis Stanley.

1322
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:29,999
Leave a message at the beep.

1323
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,251
[beep]

1324
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,463
Hey, it's me again,

1325
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,132
calling you for the millionth time.

1326
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,721
Travis, I'm so sorry
about what happened today.

1327
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,767
I really should have
been there for you. [sighs]

1328
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:53,356
I don't care
about anything else right now.

1329
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,734
Please, please, please,
just give me a call.

1330
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,987
I love you.

1331
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,909
[John shouting] Courtney.

1332
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,995
[Courtney] Yes, I'm coming,
I'm getting dressed.

1333
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,835
Okay, come on.

1334
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,129
You can set the hors d'oeuvre over there.

1335
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:17,964
Smells delicious!

1336
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,758
And I have all your change of clothes
in the other room.

1337
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,219
Thank you so much, Mrs. Clancy.
This really means a lot.

1338
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,804
Ooh, don't mention it!

1339
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,849
Okay, this better work, PP.

1340
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,809
[all whispering softly]

1341
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,192
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1342
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,653
Yeah, that's a good one.
That's what I'm tryin'...

1343
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,989
Oh, April, Richard,

1344
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,742
this is my younger daughter, Courtney.

1345
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,578
-Oh, yes, Courtney!
-Good evening, Governor.

1346
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,496
-[John] Honey?
-[Sue] Yes, what?

1347
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,208
-Well...
-Well, what?

1348
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,211
-Oh, the food!
-[John] Yes!

1349
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,213
[Sue] Oh, the food... They're here.

1350
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,675
It... It's here. There...

1351
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:08,556
There, over there, the food is... Oh, boy!
Almost ready.

1352
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,099
Any moment now.

1353
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,684
Oh, good!

1354
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,060
[Governor] It smells amazing.

1355
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:14,145
-Yes, yes.
-[Sue] Thank you.

1356
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:16,189
-Slightly familiar.
-[John] Yes...

1357
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,484
Richard, I feel that with your backing

1358
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,195
-and your constituent support...
-Oh, John, John.

1359
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,656
Please, if there's one thing
you're gonna learn about politics,

1360
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:28,159
it's not to discuss them
on an empty stomach.

1361
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,912
Sit down. Stay, shh...

1362
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,875
-Just a bunch of stress.
-[John] Yes indeed. Absolutely.

1363
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,920
-It does smell delicious...
-[John] Yes.

1364
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,506
I would like to propose a toast.
[rings glass with spoon]

1365
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:46,969
Glasses. Here is to dear friends,
and the love of family.

1366
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,679
What more could a man ask?

1367
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:49,764
Hear, hear.

1368
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:51,766
Cheers.

1369
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,353
Mmm

1370
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:56,938
Ha-ha!

1371
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,898
-[John] God! Here we go.
-[Governor] Now, let's eat.

1372
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,024
[John] All right.

1373
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:08,074
-That's not salmon!
-No, something even better.

1374
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:10,743
[angrily] You!

1375
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:14,705
This smell, I know this smell.

1376
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,207
What are you doing here?

1377
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,376
-What's going on here?
-Nothing that won't be

1378
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,419
rectified real quickly. Yeah.

1379
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,257
Sue, call the police.

1380
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:25,550
Daddy, stop!

1381
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,595
-You better get over here.
-[dish clatters]

1382
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:30,888
This is breaking and entering.

1383
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,598
-Daddy!
-I'll can call the police on you.

1384
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,225
Do you know what I'm saying?

1385
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,226
-[Dingo] Let me tell you something.
-[John] What?

1386
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,394
It's not what you think it is.

1387
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,603
What the hell is it then?

1388
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:39,272
Are you completely

1389
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:43,025
trying to ruin me, you, you,
you ghetto fossil?

1390
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,527
-A what?
-You heard me.

1391
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,736
Just like home.

1392
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,363
-It's delicious.
-Absolutely.

1393
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:50,408
-You know I have every legal right...
-[banging]

1394
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:54,871
[angrily] John Clancy,
you look ridiculous.

1395
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:58,791
-I... I just...
-No, you stop that right now.

1396
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:02,086
Why you have to always think
only about yourself?

1397
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,882
I ask you fix this, you no fix this.

1398
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:08,676
We all trying to get you stopping.

1399
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:15,349
Don't you remember...
you and I first meeting?

1400
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,936
We so in love.

1401
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,401
Our parent, they no support us.

1402
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:27,904
That was very painful.

1403
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,699
Only thing important is your daughter.

1404
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,620
Look at your daughter, she is so happy.

1405
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,207
You see how she look at this fool,

1406
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,418
and he look at her same way?

1407
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,212
John, they both happy.

1408
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,841
Remember, we used to be happy.

1409
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:04,857
Mr. Clancy,

1410
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,153
this is probably all my fault.

1411
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,992
But I've been trying to get this out
this entire weekend.

1412
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,745
I really love your daughter,

1413
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:21,123
and I'm willing to do anything
to make her happy

1414
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,085
for the rest of our lives.

1415
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,544
Just like my parents,

1416
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,758
and just like you and Mrs. Clancy.

1417
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,637
Guess what I'm trying to ask you is...

1418
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,225
Can I he your daughter's hand
in marriage, sir?

1419
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:09,672
Courtney Clancy, would you make me
the happiest man alive?

1420
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:14,719
Will you be my wife?

1421
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,102
[whispers]

1422
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,065
Yes, yes.

1423
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,818
Congratulations.

1424
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,780
Oh, everybody clapping!

1425
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:37,616
[everyone applauding]

1426
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,578
That's my PP!

1427
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:41,954
Congratulations, son.

1428
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:50,171
[everyone cheering]

1429
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,299
[Dingo] Get your ass in here.

1430
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:57,970
[everyone chattering excitedly]

1431
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:01,849
Welcome to the family.

1432
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,104
-[Governor] This was amazing, John.
-[John] Yes.

1433
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:08,647
But I still don't know how you knew.

1434
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:09,857
How he knew what?

1435
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,069
Very few people know that my mother
was born and raised in Louisiana.

1436
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,739
Louisiana! Surprise!

1437
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:19,116
Every summer, we used to go there,
visit her family.

1438
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,661
And before we left the state,
she'd take me out for barbeque.

1439
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:23,871
Yes, yes!

1440
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,081
To a little, old rib shack.

1441
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,084
That old shack that was...
You had no idea. I do.

1442
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,587
And then I show up here
and it's on your dinner table.

1443
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:34,298
Aww, that is amazing story.

1444
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,093
I hear they used to serve their ribs
on the underground railroad as well.

1445
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:41,722
Yes, yeah, yeah, I think, Harriet Tubman
had the number three...

1446
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,599
John Clancy...

1447
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,895
any man with that attention to detail

1448
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,815
deserved my endorsement for senator.

1449
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:52,858
[grunts excitedly]

1450
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:56,946
Well, thank you, thank you, Richard,
you won't be disappointed.

1451
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,531
You keep those ribs comin',

1452
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,534
-then I don't suppose I will.
-Oh, absolutely, absolutely!

1453
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,036
Well, thank you, guys, so much for coming.

1454
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:09,208
Oh, and hey, if they're interested
in franchising,

1455
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:10,835
I think we can all do some business.

1456
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,295
Absolutely, I can make a little money
on the side.

1457
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,965
You two have a wonderful evening.

1458
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,675
-Right.
-And please congratulate

1459
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:18,676
your daughter again for me.

1460
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,220
[John] Oh, yes, yes, yes! Absolutely.

1461
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,265
Nice to see you. Thank you.

1462
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,474
[speaking Korean]

1463
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:27,560
Thank you for coming.

1464
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,356
Yes!

1465
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,113
-[Dingo] You gotta go ahead...
-Oh, no. All right!

1466
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,782
Okay, but don't pay us no never-mind.

1467
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:45,202
Not a problem, Niphateria,
what can I do for you?

1468
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:48,038
I think the question
is what I can do for you.

1469
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:52,877
I made a little Stanky-leg Stankershet
shot for you, Mr. John.

1470
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,545
Just want you to go on
and give it a little swirl.

1471
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:57,756
-Get your life, baby.
-It's gonna change your life.

1472
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,008
Don't mind if it does.

1473
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,593
You know what you need to do.

1474
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,219
Get your life.

1475
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:07,808
In five, four, three, two...

1476
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,268
[Dingo and John] Oh, shit!

1477
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:10,561
Watch your step.

1478
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:13,522
-Show me what you're working with.
-Show me what you're working with.

1479
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,983
Ooh, baby.

1480
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,319
-[Dingo] You know what I'm saying?
-[John] Let me holler at you

1481
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,446
for a second in the room there.

1482
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,114
Oh, John!

1483
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:23,866
Have fun, John.

1484
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,286
Pop that thing, pop that thing, pop it!

1485
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:30,748
-[John] Come on!
-You know my... My safe word is kimchi.

1486
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:34,293
[both shouting and screaming
in excitement]

1487
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:38,088
Pop that thing, John. Pop that thing, boy.

1488
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,382
You welcome.

1489
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,301
No, no, no, no!

1490
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,554
-[romantic song starts playing]
-Oh, my God! Baby, you hear that? Listen.

1491
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,348
Oh, my God!

1492
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:52,937
Oh, that's our song, baby.
Now, you get this going.

1493
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,522
-Oh, baby.
-I love that song.

1494
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:58,108
-We met on that song.
-No, we did it on that song,

1495
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,443
What you talking about?

1496
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:08,244
Thank you, Mr. Stankershet.

1497
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:09,703
For what, baby?

1498
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,456
Being the man that I always loved.

1499
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,375
I love makin' you happy.

1500
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,920
And you know exactly how to make me happy.

1501
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,129
I love you, baby.

1502
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,547
I love you.

1503
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:32,893
Got some movement.

1504
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:34,812
-What's that?
-That's the mandingo.

1505
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,190
Houston, we ain't got no problems.

1506
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,986
Ooh, Lord, told you
not to give me that cocktail.

1507
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,114
Damn, that worked fast this time.

1508
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,908
Hey, when that thing wake up,
it gotta go to work.

1509
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:51,704
[both starts singing]

1510
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,626
Hey, man, we forgot you was there.

1511
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,088
I wanted to say that...

1512
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,590
I'm really happy you guys came.

1513
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:07,511
I mean, I couldn't have done all this
without you guys.

1514
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:10,931
-I love you, Mamma.
-I love you, PP.

1515
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:15,811
-And I love you, Pop.
-Thank you, son, love you too.

1516
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:21,025
And you, girl, if you ain't my damn twin!

1517
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:23,193
I swear we are identical! Come here, girl.

1518
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:25,696
I love you, baby. [squeals]

1519
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,072
Welcome to the family.

1520
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:29,533
-Thank you, Mr. Stankershet.
-Always a pleasure.

1521
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,201
Such a nice, young lady.

1522
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,411
Listen...

1523
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:37,416
Me and your mamma, we got Bible study
on Wednesday, we gonna go upstairs.

1524
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,834
Praise His light.

1525
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,211
Got some scriptures to study.

1526
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,838
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

1527
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:43,839
Let's go, baby.

01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,632
-Start taking your top off.
-Okay, all right.

1529
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,301
[Dingo] Start taking your top off now.

1530
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:48,385
Oh, Lord Jesus!

1531
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,304
We gonna see y'all.

1532
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,305
-Come on.

1533
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,389
Oh, I got that thing!

1534
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:55,601
[Dingo catcalls] Come on, baby.

1535
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:58,854
It's not Wednesday.

1536
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,189
[both laugh]

1537
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,609
Oh, babe, I love your parents.

1538
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,319
I think they love you too.

1539
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:09,907
-Mr. Stankershet.
-Oh, Mrs. Stankershet.

1540

That's Courtney Marie Mount Zion-
On-The-Rock [clicks tongue] Stankershet.

1541
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:18,499
-I love you.
-I love you more.

1542
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,043
[Travis] Have you ever been in the middle
of everything in your life

1543
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,045
completely falling into place?

1544
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:27,341
And you stop and ask yourself,
where did it all go right?

1545
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,729
The jury punishing me now.

1546
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,439
-[Sue] Oh, officer.
-[John] Yeah.

1547
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,274

-[John] You so bad!

1548
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:45,609

-Finally!
-All right!

1550
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:51,949
Oh, yes!

1551
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:54,576
Oh, no, that one exit-only hole!

1552
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:57,329
Kimchi! Kimchi!

1553
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:00,207
-Yes, tap that ass.
-I'm tapping that ass.

1554
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:03,877
Thank you, Jesus. I go back to church now.
