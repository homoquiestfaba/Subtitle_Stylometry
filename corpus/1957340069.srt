1
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,200
(calm and serene music)

2
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,140
- How often do you
come out here?

3
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,000
- Whenever I can't handle
my mom anymore.

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,060
- I bet that happens a lot.

5
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,210
- Thanks for coming.

6
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,120
- Sure.

7
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Seems like a cool place.

8
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,110
(calm and relaxing music)

9
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,210
So you're the kind of kid who
hangs out in places like this?

10
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,090
- Nah, I'm not like
creepy or anything.

11
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,030
- Relax dude, I was
just kidding.

12
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Simon.

13
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,180
Simon?

14
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,030
Where are you?

15
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Simon.

16
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,100
(Simon yells loudly)
(girl shrieks)

17
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,060
You are a freak!

18
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,190
- Sorry, I thought it
would be funny.

19
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,170
(girl giggles)

20
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,230
- Is this how you get
all your girlfriends?

21
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,060
- What do you mean?

22
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,090
- You know, you take him
out to a spooky house,

23
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,210
then they think you're
all dark and interesting?

24
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,120
- No, I've never taken
anyone here before.

25
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,160
- Never know with guys like you.

26
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,040
- What are guys like me?

27
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,180
- I don't know,

28
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,070
mysterious.

29
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,060
Or maybe just a normal nerd.

30
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,020
Haven't decided.

31
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,100
- (exhales forcefully)
I wish I was mysterious.

32
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,080
At least I'd be a little
more interesting.

33
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,160
What do you do?

34
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,120
- What?

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,100
- How do you get guys
to fall for you?

36
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,010
- Who do you think I am?

37
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,070
- Um.

38
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,210
(girl giggles)

39
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,220
So,

40
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,150
what if I really did bring
you here to impress you?

41
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,110
- I figured.

42
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,060
It's cool.

43
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,070
Consider me impressed.

44
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,160
We should hang out more.

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,030
- Yeah, I hope.

46
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,050
My mom doesn't like me
going out very much.

47
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,010
- Ah,

48
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,160
she's one of those.
(chuckles softly)

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,050
- No my dad died a year ago so

50
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,060
she likes to keep me close.

51
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,020
- Oh.

52
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,030
Sorry.

53
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,210
- No, you don't have
to be sorry.

54
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,130
- I kinda sorta wish
we can get out

55
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,040
of this stupid neighborhood.

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,010
- Yeah.

57
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,070
I'd just go to my uncle's.

58
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,130
He has a farm and everything.

59
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,130
- Sounds nice.

60
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,150
You should go then. I would.

61
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,200
- No, I can't just leave my mom.

62
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,100
She hates my uncle.

63
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,120
- You're sweet.

64
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,130
It's a shame.

65
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,050
(gun fires loudly)

66
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,180
- [Man] Get back here!
You're dead!

67
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,030
- I thought you said no
one came here.

68
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,210
- Yeah, we should go.

69
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,060
(girl giggles)

70
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,000
- I'll see you later.

71
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,030
(calm but somber music)

72
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,230
- Simon?

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,010
Hello Simon.

74
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,130
Where were you this morning?

75
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,220
- [Simon] Just went for a walk.

76
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,070
- Did you check the mail yet?

77
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,220
What's that?

78
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,070
- Nothing.

79
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,090
- Let me see.

80
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,150
- Mom! Stop!

81
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,090
- Oh.

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,220
- Mom, that was mine!

83
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,010
- Why would you even want this?

84
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,010
- Because he sent it to me!

85
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,160
- Your uncle doesn't
care about you.

86
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,200
- Yeah, at least we'd
have food there.

87
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,130
- I'll handle the
shop today Simon.

88
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,230
Take the rest of the day off.

89
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,180
- I'm sorry.

90
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,120
Mom!

91
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,110
(calm but foreboding music)

92
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,150
- So, how it go with Jen?

93
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,010
- Alright I guess.

94
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,000
- Bet she thinks
you're a weirdo.

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,110
- What you mean?

96
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,120
- You know,

97
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,060
taking her first thing
in the morning

98
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,090
to a creepy ass house.

99
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,160
Sounds rapey to me.

100
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,060
- I thought I had work
later, it make sense.

101
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,020
- No it doesn't.

102
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,080
She definitely thinks
you're a creep.

103
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,180
- We haven't had a
customer in two weeks.

104
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,160
- How come?

105
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,150
- I don't know.

106
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,150
Guess people don't wanna pay
us to fix their stuff anymore.

107
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,080
- Sucks man.

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,110
That's why I'm leaving.

109
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,190
This place is done.

110
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,170
- Are you sure your
brother's is gonna be better?

111
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,140
- I just assumed it would

112
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,140
but I don't know really.

113
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,210
- I remember you telling me
you didn't have much space

114
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,020
but if me and mom can
help you guys out.

115
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,070
- Dude, I told you.

116
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,070
I'd bring you if I could.

117
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,020
- You won't even know I'm there.

118
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,090
- You eat, don't you?

119
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,040
Take showers?

120
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,220
Sorry man, it's not
gonna happen.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,220
Why don't you move in
with your uncle?

122
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,140
- We should.

123
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,210
- You know I'd help if I could.

124
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,030
- Yeah, I know.

125
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,120
(thunder roars loudly)

126
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,180
(soft and gentle piano music)

127
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,090
- [Simon's Mom] Simon!

128
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,230
Get in the basement!

129
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,020
(moves into still and
foreboding music)

130
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,010
(object smashes wood)

131
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,090
(people mumble angrily)

132
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,120
(loud smashing)

133
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,220
(calm but somber music)

134
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,030
- What are you doing?

135
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,120
- I'm tired.

136
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm gonna go take a nap,

137
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,210
from there we're gonna
get back to work.

138
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,170
- Get back to what?

139
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,010
- We have a shop to run.

140
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,150
- Mom there is no shop!
You saw it!

141
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,090
- We've had this family
business for years,

142
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,000
I am not giving up yet!

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,220
- Yeah, well,

144
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,120
maybe it's time.

145
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,080
You know, we're
almost out of food.

146
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
How do you expect to
pay for anything else?

147
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,180
- We've always gotten by.

148
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,010
- Well, maybe we can't
control that anymore.

149
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,060
And Roberto has room for us.

150
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,110
- He abandoned us.

151
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,090
We're his family and he left.

152
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,210
- How are we a family?

153
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,230
It's just the two of us.

154
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,000
There's no one here

155
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,100
and no one cares.

156
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,070
- You really wanna go,
don't you?

157
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,170
- I don't wanna be here anymore.

158
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,140
- Well, maybe you
should go then.

159
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,180
- What are you talking about?

160
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,010
- This place has
nothing to offer you,

161
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,110
maybe you should just go.

162
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,170
- Mom,

163
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,030
please don't talk like that.

164
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,000
- You hate it here.

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,170
- I don't hate it here.

166
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,140
- Yes you do.

167
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,020
You haven't been the
same since your father.

168
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,220
- Yeah, but neither than you.

169
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,180
- You're right.

170
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,070
Look Simon, I can't
provide for you.

171
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,060
- Mom, don't talk like that.

172
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,070
We can go together and
find something.

173
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,120
It doesn't have to be
a Roberto's.

174
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,110
- You don't understand.
I don't want to.

175
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,120
I'm done.

176
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,140
I'm not living my life as
a burden to you.

177
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,190
- Mom, you're not a
burden to me.

178
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,000
I love you.

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
- I love you too, Simon.

180
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,100
- What are you gonna do?

181
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,220
- I'll be here.

182
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,200
I've been here my whole life.

183
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,140
I'm not going anywhere.

184
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,010
But that doesn't mean
that you should stay.

185
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,030
You could make
something of yourself.

186
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,150
(serene but foreboding music)

187
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,060
(fist knocks softly on door)

188
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,030
- Uh hey, what's up?

189
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,230
- Can I talk to you?

190
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,010
- Yeah, sure.

191
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,080
What's going on?

192
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,040
- Do you wanna leave?

193
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,000
- Now?

194
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
- My uncle needs help
at his farm,

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,230
we can go together.

196
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,050
- What are you talking about?

197
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,110
- He says it's awesome out there

198
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,230
and there's tons of food
and places to sleep.

199
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,200
- Is something going on?

200
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,160
- I know it sounds crazy,
but I think it could work.

201
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,150
- Simon, I can't just
leave with you.

202
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,120
- Why not?

203
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,080
- This is my home

204
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,010
and I've only known you
for a couple of days.

205
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,120
- So what?
We like each other, right?

206
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,030
- I've liked plenty of people,

207
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,010
but that doesn't mean I'd
abandon my life

208
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,230
and run away with them.

209
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,160
What?

210
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,020
Did you think we're
together or something?

211
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,070
- I don't know, I.

212
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,030
- Simon.

213
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,070
Honestly, you're nice.

214
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,030
You got this stuff
with your mom and

215
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,200
I just don't think you
and me are gonna work out.

216
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,020
- I see.

217
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,080
- I'm not trying to be
mean or anything but

218
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,120
you need to think
things through.

219
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,160
You aren't being rational.

220
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,110
- Okay.

221
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,100
- Wait, are you really going?

222
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,180
Do you any idea how bad
it is out there?

223
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
- I guess I'll find out.

224
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,230
(calm and serene music)

225
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,120
(soft and somber song
plays over intercom)

226
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,120
Excuse me.

227
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,230
- Can I help you?

228
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,020
- Yeah I was wondering if
you knew of any places around

229
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,060
where I could sleep?

230
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,200
- Are you gonna buy anything?

231
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,010
- No sir, I don't
have any money.

232
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,160
- Neither do most people.

233
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,020
Get the fuck out of my store.

234
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,140
- [Man] Alright, try it.

235
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,020
(engine whirls and whines)

236
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,220
- Nope.

237
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,090
- Darn it! God! (mumbles)

238
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,040
Hey! Hey you!

239
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,170
Yeah you, come here.

240
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,010
Hey, give me a hand with this.

241
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,200
Can you please hold
this for just a second?

242
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,010
- [Simon] Yeah.

243
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,210
- Alright. Here we go.

244
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,160
This is it.

245
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,230
One more time, one more time.

246
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,050
Alright, try it now.

247
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,080
(engine whirls and whines)

248
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,120
Damn it!
- Still nothing.

249
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,110
I thought you said you
knew what you were doing.

250
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,230
- Do you wanna give it a try?

251
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,170
- Well maybe we'd be
better off if I did.

252
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,150
- [Simon] Well I think you
have a loose connection.

253
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,170
- What?

254
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,000
- Here, hold this for me please?

255
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,050
I think you have a
loose connection

256
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,070
between the battery
and the starter.

257
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,150
Now one sec.

258
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,190
Here, try now?

259
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,040
(engine revs and turns)

260
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,000
(man chuckles)

261
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
- Nice!
- Awesome! (chuckles)

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,060
- We'd probably been
stuck here all week

263
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,020
if it weren't for you.

264
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,060
- Oh. (laughs sarcastically)

265
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,020
- My dad was a mechanic,

266
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,190
so he used to bring me
in all the time.

267
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,230
- Cool.

268
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,130
Well, uh,

269
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,140
well where you headed?

270
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,100
- Uh.

271
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,060
- We're going down in
the 10th village

272
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
if you need a lift maybe?

273
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,050
- Yeah.
Yeah, that would be awesome.

274
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,010
Thank you.

275
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,210
- Cool.

276
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,170
Well, I'm Andrew.

277
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,050
And that's Jessie.

278
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,080
- Simon.

279
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,040
- Nice to meet you.

280
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,000
- You too.

281
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,120
(serene and joyous music)

282
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,070
(Andrew yells excitedly)

283
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,210
(tool clicks)

284
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,200
Thank you guys for the food.

285
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,000
- Sure, it's no problem.

286
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,170
You fixed our car, it's
the least we can do.

287
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,120
Did you lock the car?

288
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,080
- Yeah.

289
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,030
So Simon,

290
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,180
you out here just all alone?

291
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,220
- Yeah, it looks that way.

292
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,190
- Well, more power to you.

293
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,000
Sometimes I wish I
could travel alone.

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,200
(Andrew chuckles)

295
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,010
- You wouldn't last one
week without me.

296
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,070
- Probably not.

297
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,130
So where you headed?

298
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,080
- Oh, well I was trying
to get to Blackstone.

299
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,200
- Whoa, uh.
- Yeah.

300
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,060
- That's a hike, son.

301
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
- Yeah.

302
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,210
Do you guys know the best
way to get there from here?

303
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,170
- Is it near Richmond?

304
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
- Um, yeah.

305
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,220
Yeah, I think it is.

306
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,090
- Okay, um,

307
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,050
head southeast,

308
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,210
probably follow 522.

309
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,000
- See? Jessie's good at maps.

310
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,010
That's basically why I
keep her around.

311
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,210
- Sure.

312
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,050
It was nice meeting you, Simon.

313
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,000
- 'Night, princess!

314
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,220
What a catch. (laughs)

315
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,070
- You guys seem happy together.

316
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,160
(Andrew chuckles)

317
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,210
- No, um, it's not like that.
(chuckles)

318
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,170
She's like
practically my sister.

319
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,180
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

320
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Sorry.

321
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,010
- It's okay.

322
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,080
- Where you guys headed?

323
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,040
- [Man] Andrew!

324
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,000
- Issac!

325
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,010
Hey man! Holy shit!

326
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,060
Hey, we didn't think we'd
see you until tomorrow!

327
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,170
- Eh, well,

328
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,070
you know I wanted to
run for a long time so,

329
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,170
you know, made the trip
a lot faster.

330
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,040
- Nice.

331
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,130
- Yeah.

332
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,190
Who's this?

333
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,170
He is cute.

334
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,020
(Andrew laughs)

335
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,040
Oh, uh, wait. Hi.

336
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,140
Stay right there.

337
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,100
- What?

338
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,190
- Right (camera shutter
clicks) there.

339
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,030
Oh wait a minute, are you two?

340
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,120
- No! No, no.

341
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,220
Look, we just picked him
up on the side of the road.

342
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,090
Simon, this is Issac.

343
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,180
He's an old friend.

344
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,120
His dad is gonna get
us work in his company

345
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,020
and we really appreciate that.

346
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,080
- Well, I'm gonna get
some sleep so.

347
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,090
- [Andrew] Yeah. Yeah.

348
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,160
- It's nice meeting you Issac.

349
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,080
- Dude, what the fuck is
wrong with you?

350
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,000
- You need any help?

351
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,180
- That's okay.

352
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,140
I'm just gonna get some sleep.

353
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,030
- Oh, okay.

354
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,050
- Good luck with everything.

355
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,230
- Thank you. You too.

356
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,210
- [Andrew] Dude, you
gotta let this go.

357
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,000
Please, it's not--

358
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,070
- [Issac] I know you, Andrew.

359
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,160
I know what you're doing.

360
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,120
- I'm not doing anything,

361
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,170
- You can't--
- I just met the kid.

362
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,190
- I don't wanna hear it, man.

363
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,200
You know what?

364
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,100
I'm done. Fuck you.

365
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,060
- Issac.
- No, I'm done.

366
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,010
- Issac!

367
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,030
(still but calm music)

368
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,100
Hey man, I'm sorry about Issac.

369
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
- It's fine.

370
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,190
- Where you sleeping tonight?

371
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,220
- I don't know, I
don't have a tent.

372
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,130
- Come on, you can
sleep in our tent.

373
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,090
- Okay.

374
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,110
- Dude, I swear to God.

375
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,050
If it wasn't for him taking
us to that coal mine,

376
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,070
I wish I would never
see him again.

377
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,090
- Coal mine?

378
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,070
- Yeah, we're supposed to
go there to work with him.

379
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,070
He's a good guy really

380
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,210
when he's not being
such a fucking asshole.

381
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,170
- Jessie. Jessie.

382
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,060
Hey, hey, Simon's gonna
sleep in the tent tonight,

383
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,120
if that's okay.

384
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,020
- Yeah, that's fine.

385
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,150
Where's Issac?

386
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,080
- I don't know.
He's off somewhere.

387
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,120
He'll be fine.

388
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,070
(men shout in the distance)

389
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,140
(low, suspenseful music)
(woman screams)

390
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,020
(group makes a ruckus)

391
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,060
- Guys!

392
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,020
Wake up!

393
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,070
There's some people
robbing the tents,

394
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,060
I think they have guns.
- What?

395
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,020
- [Andrew] Get your bag.

396
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,220
(guns fire haphazardly)

397
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,180
No!

398
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,180
- [Simon] Just run!
Grab your stuff!

399
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,180
- Where you think you're going?

400
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,230
(moves into intense and
suspenseful music)

401
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,150
(still and foreboding music)

402
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,050
- [Jessie] Does Issac
know to meet us here?

403
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,140
- How would he know to do that?

404
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,080
- Sorry, just asking.

405
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,000
- We'll meet him back
at camp in half a hour.

406
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
They should be gone by then.

407
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,210
- What are you doing.

408
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,160
- I think I'm gonna
head back with you guys.

409
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,060
I think I left some
stuff back at the camp.

410
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,040
- Sure.

411
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,200
- It doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

412
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,000
- Yes it does.

413
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,010
He wouldn't have
left without it.

414
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,050
- You okay?

415
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,200
- Were you guys close?

416
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,210
- Issac and Andrew--

417
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,170
- He was my boyfriend.

418
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,150
- Can we still get to the mine?

419
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,190
- No.

420
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,160
- What if we head back
up towards Pennsylvania?

421
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,120
- Why?

422
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,090
What's gonna be up there now

423
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,120
that wasn't there before?

424
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,220
- I have a place we can go.

425
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,090
- What?

426
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,050
- My uncle,

427
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,130
he owns a farms and
other families go there.

428
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,070
We could go together.

429
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,090
- Why would you do that?

430
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,050
- What do you mean?

431
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,150
- You barely know us.

432
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,200
- Honestly,

433
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,130
you guys know a lot
better than I do

434
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:34,090
about how to survive
out here and

435
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,150
I wouldn't mind traveling
with someone else.

436
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,130
- It's near Blackstone?

437
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,010
That's almost 200
miles from here.

438
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,200
(calm and serene music)

439
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,080
Yeah, let's do it.

440
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,090
Based on what I've heard,

441
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,200
I don't think there's
gonna be anything better

442
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
anywhere closer to here.

443
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,090
- We should scour the
area for food.

444
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,220
- Did you guys find anything?

445
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,000
- Not really.

446
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,170
- Fine. Let's go.

447
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,070
- Hey!

448
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,120
- Why isn't anybody stopping?

449
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,110
- [Andrew] Probably
because they think

450
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,110
we're going to rob them.

451
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,070
- [Jessie] Come on.

452
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,150
(calm and serene music)

453
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,000
- Come on.

454
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,190
We can get a little
further before dark.

455
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,110
- I can take watch for the
first part of the night.

456
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,060
- [Andrew] Alright.

457
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,220
- I can take one too if
you guys need it.

458
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,230
- Aww. No, that's okay Simon.

459
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,070
No, we got it.

460
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,120
Thanks though.

461
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,070
(moves into serene but
somber music)

462
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,150
- Morning, sunshine.

463
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,020
- Breakfast?

464
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
- Once we start walking.

465
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,080
- You just suck on it?

466
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,040
- Yeah.

467
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,000
Doesn't do much to stave
off hunger but

468
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,180
keeps the saliva flowing.

469
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,140
- Okay.

470
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,030
(men grunt and struggle)

471
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,180
- Just keep your eyes down.

472
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,200
Keep walking.

473
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,070
(men grunt and pant)

474
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,120
(ponytailed man catcalls)

475
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,050
- Hey baby!

476
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,040
You sure you don't
wanna come play with me?

477
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,140
Oh, no?
Think you're too good for me?

478
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,160
Yeah? Well fuck you, bitch!

479
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,210
- What's your problem, dude?

480
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,170
(still and suspenseful music)

481
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,180
- Simon, don't worry about it.

482
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,140
- No. No, no, no.

483
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,190
Let the man speak for himself.

484
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:36,010
He's got a problem with me,

485
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,080
I'd love to hear it.

486
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,110
- You shouldn't talk to
people like that.

487
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,090
(ponytailed man chuckles)

488
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,060
- Oh you're a gentleman,
ain't you?

489
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,040
- Just let him alone.

490
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,000
- Yeah, and I said let
him speak for himself.

491
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,130
(moves into low and
bassy, suspenseful music)

492
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,130
You guys look like shit.

493
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,070
You see these cans?

494
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,080
They're mine.

495
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,080
You beat me in a fight,

496
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,080
they're yours.

497
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,010
So what do you say,

498
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,210
gentlemen?

499
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,060
- Simon, you don't
have to do this.

500
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,090
(fat man chuckles)

501
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,000
- [Fat Man] Ooh! (chuckles)

502
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,180
- (coughs) Okay?

503
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Alright man!

504
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,090
What's that?

505
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,010
Oh! Woo!

506
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,060
Eyes tearing up a little bit?

507
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,040
That what it is? Come on.

508
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,170
(Simon grunts in pain)

509
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,150
Ooh, now you can't
breathe can you?

510
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,230
Why's your head down?

511
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,190
You upset?

512
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,000
What about you, sweetheart?

513
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,160
Isn't this supposed
to be your man?

514
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,190
Your knight in
shining-- (grunts)

515
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,180
Come on.

516
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,170
Come on, baby. Come on!

517
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,000
(pants) Woo!

518
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,180
Good fight, kid!

519
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,070
Let's go.

520
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,000
(Simon pants)

521
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,060
- For what it's worth,

522
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,180
you almost look like a badass.

523
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,220
- Thank you.

524
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,180
- Almost.

525
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,170
(calm and serene music)

526
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,160
You look like shit, you know?

527
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,000
(Simon chuckles softly)

528
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,120
Does that hurt?

529
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,080
- No.

530
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,040
- Oh really?

531
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,120
- Yeah, it's fine.

532
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,140
- Admitting you're in pain

533
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,170
won't make me think you're
any less of a badass.

534
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,190
- How's that?

535
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,180
- Well,

536
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,110
you already proved otherwise
by getting your ass kicked.

537
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,160
(Simon chuckles softly)

538
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,200
- Hey, I think I
lasted pretty well,

539
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,210
all things considered, so.

540
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,190
- Sure!
Keep telling yourself that.

541
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,030
- Some people would say it
was pretty cool

542
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,100
how I just volunteered and all.

543
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,080
- Then let me help you.

544
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,050
- Fine.

545
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,150
You know,

546
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,110
you can go to sleep,

547
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,170
I don't mind being lookout.

548
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,040
- That's okay.

549
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,110
(moves into calm but
distorted and worrying music)

550
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,010
- Psst, hey.

551
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,130
Can I talk to you?

552
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,080
(Andrew gags softly)

553
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,200
(Andrew grunts softly)

554
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:52,110
(serene but somber music)

555
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,140
(Andrew and Jessie mumble)

556
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,060
- We were just looking
for some more plants.

557
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,000
Nothing but poisonous mushrooms.

558
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,110
How you holding up?

559
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,170
- I'll be okay.

560
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,010
- Alright.

561
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,130
Well just let me know if
you need a break.

562
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,170
(moves into soft and
serene piano music)

563
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,200
- (sighs) I gotta sit down.

564
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,210
- Yeah, me too.

565
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,080
- How much further?

566
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,070
- I don't know.

567
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,140
I just know we're going
in the right direction.

568
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,000
(Andrew laughs)

569
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,150
- We're fucked.

570
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,130
We're gonna die out here.

571
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,190
- We're not gonna die.

572
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,220
- We barely even know
where we're going.

573
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,220
- Okay.
Listen, I know it's south.

574
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,090
Okay, so once we hit Virginia,

575
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,130
I should be able to identify it.

576
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,070
- We shouldn't even be out here.

577
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,050
We shouldn't be
following some kid.

578
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,010
- Come on.

579
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,140
- Fuck it.

580
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,230
- Yeah, let's do it.

581
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,040
(soft and still music)

582
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,140
(Andrew chuckles happily)

583
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,180
(moves into calm and
mellow music)

584
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:06,200
(group splash around)

585
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,220
(group laugh softly)

586
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,210
- [Andrew] No you don't! Oh no!

587
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:17,150
(Jessie giggles)

588
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,100
You're next, buddy!

589
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,170
(Andrew growls playfully)

590
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:46,200
(happy ragtime music)
(cartoon monkey laughs)

591
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,080
- [Cartoon Monkey]
We'll find you.

592
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,160
(cartoon monkey laughs)

593
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,080
(cartoon monkey laughs happily)

594
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,110
- How come cartoons
are so morbid?

595
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,110
- It's not that morbid.

596
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,080
- Like every scene
in this thing,

597
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,100
the character's about to
get dismembered or murdered

598
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,120
or something crazy.

599
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,030
- It'll all end happy though.

600
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,000
(Jessie laughs softly)

601
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,220
- Well yeah, but that's
not the point.

602
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,020
- You are getting way too
profound for me, sister.

603
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah but

604
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,200
when did you think we realize

605
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,120
that this is just bullshit?

606
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,000
- What do you mean?

607
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,200
- Well there's gotta
be some point

608
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,120
where we just stop believing
in this stuff, right?

609
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,050
- Just part of growing up,
I guess.

610
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,190
- Yeah, I guess so.

611
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,090
- Why did you leave?

612
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,140
- Well there was just
nothing for me, is all.

613
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,220
Why'd you leave?

614
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,120
- I screwed everything up.

615
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,020
I was raised by a foster dad,

616
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,030
he was a really good guy.

617
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,120
But I ruined it.

618
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,030
- Is he still alive?

619
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,200
- Yeah, but I can't
go back there.

620
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,220
- Well you still have
Andrew though, right?

621
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,030
(Jessie chuckles)

622
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:34,230
- I don't know,

623
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,000
I think he could probably
find himself another pet.

624
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,140
- You're not a pet,
Andrew cares about you.

625
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,040
I care about you too.

626
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,060
- Well that doesn't
count, you barely know me.

627
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,020
- I know you enough.

628
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,110
- Thank you.

629
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,210
It means a lot.

630
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,020
- (giggles) What are you doing?

631
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,220
- What? I.

632
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,100
- Simon, you're a kid.
How old are you?

633
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,030
- I'm 16! How am I a kid?

634
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,230
I've been running my family
business since I was 12.

635
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,150
- You're young, you got
a lot left to learn.

636
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,170
- Right.

637
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,180
- Simon.

638
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,070
(sliding door squeaks open)

639
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:31,160
(calm and gentle music)

640
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,130
(car doors click
open and closed)

641
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:58,070
(calm but suspenseful music)

642
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,100
- Hey!

643
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,150
The hell are you doing up there?

644
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:09,190
(door knob and keys
jingle intensely)

645
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,060
(sliding door squeaks open)

646
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,020
Jessie!

647
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,230
Jessie, wake up.

648
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,210
Jessie! Jessie!

649
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,050
The owners are back!

650
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,040
- Did they see you?

651
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,020
- I guess!
I was looking outside!

652
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,000
- You what?

653
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,180
- What's going on?

654
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,020
- [Simon] The owners are back.

655
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,120
- What?

656
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,030
Where are they?

657
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,130
Did they see you?

658
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,150
- Andrew, let's go dude!

659
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,080
(shotgun cocks loudly)

660
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,020
- Alright, let's see
those hands!

661
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:53,010
(shotgun fires)

662
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,040
- Where's Andrew?

663
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,190
- [Jessie] Andrew!

664
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,050
Talk to me.

665
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,000
(Andrew mumbles)

666
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
- You'll be fine.

667
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,100
- [Andrew] You idiot!

668
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,000
- [Jessie] Don't blame him.

669
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,210
- (pants) Why not?

670
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,060
You think they wouldn't see
you fell asleep on the porch?

671
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,040
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

672
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,030
- Relax.

673
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:20,230
Let me look at your leg.

674
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,070
(Andrew screams)

675
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,060
- I could've got us
some more food

676
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,100
if it wasn't for you!

677
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,050
- Yelling at Simon
isn't gonna help.

678
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,100
Simon, grab his arm.

679
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,020
We need to take him to
the hospital.

680
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,020
- We don't need him!

681
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,000
- Andrew, calm down.

682
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,230
We need him

683
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,180
and he needs us.
- No we don't.

684
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,050
We have the address.

685
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,010
We know where the farm is.

686
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,210
You think they're gonna
turn down free work?

687
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,050
- Andrew, please don't
talk like that.

688
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,030
- Why not, Simon?

689
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,170
Jessie, listen. Listen.

690
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,170
You know that he is a liability.

691
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,180
We don't even need him.

692
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,100
We don't even know if his
farm even fucking exist!

693
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,230
- You're not being rational.

694
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,010
- Maybe not.

695
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,140
But I rather risk
dying out there

696
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,140
than guaranteeing it with him.

697
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,070
You can come with me
if you want.

698
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,230
Your choice.

699
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:05,030
- Jessie please don't leave
me out here by myself.

700
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,180
- I'm sorry.

701
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,060
(Simon pants panicky)

702
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,160
(calm and relaxing music)

703
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,100
(wind howls and echoes)

704
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,010
(metal squeaks)

705
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,200
- Uh, hi.

706
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm sorry. I'm trying
to get to Blackstone.

707
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,110
- Blackstone?

708
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,000
- Yeah, I'm trying to get to,
uh--

709
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,010
- Oh there's no place
called Blackstone.

710
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,130
- I think it's near Dresden?

711
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,000
- Dresden, is that near
the fish market?

712
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,200
- Um, I'm really not sure.

713
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,170
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,130
Here's what you do.

715
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,180
You got down that way
about a half a mile,

716
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,000
turn right on Riverside,
and you can't miss it.

717
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,200
- Awesome.

718
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,150
Thank you very much, I
really appreciate it.

719
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,180
- Guess I can't sell
you anything,

720
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,080
you look like shit.

721
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,160
- Thank you.

722
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,200
- That's not a complement.

723
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,060
(calm and serene music)

724
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,120
(moves into calm but
somber music)

725
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,140
- Roberto?

726
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:10,110
- [Man] Hey!

727
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,190
(moves into calm but
suspenseful music)

728
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,190
Who are you?

729
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,060
- Roberto?

730
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,100
It's Simon.

731
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,030
- Simon!

732
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:24,040
It's so good to see you.

733
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,000
I had no idea you were coming.

734
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,160
- I didn't know how
to reach you.

735
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,020
- How'd you get here?

736
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:29,230
Did you come here all alone?

737
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,200
- Uh, no.
I came with two others.

738
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,170
- Well where are they?

739
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:36,190
- Uh, we split up a
little ways back.

740
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,140
- I'm sorry to hear that.

741
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,100
But they're really
gonna miss out

742
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,210
on what I'm about to show you.

743
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,170
Come on.

744
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,160
We have a number of fields

745
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,180
with a variety of crops
growing this year.

746
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,200
- Wow, that's awesome.

747
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,010
So, you did all this?

748
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,180
- With a little bit of help.

749
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,080
We actually have three families

750
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,210
and a couple of individuals
who work here everyday.

751
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,170
Matter of fact,

752
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,030
a couple of young people
just showed up this morning.

753
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,150
And if you're willing to work,

754
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,010
this can be your home, Simon.

755
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:37,170
And this is our meeting room.

756
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,030
We come together as a
community once--

757
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,050
Oh, sorry for barging in.

758
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,060
This is my nephew, Simon.

759
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,150
He'll be staying with you
guys upstairs.

760
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:52,070
- It's nice to meet you, Simon.

761
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,210
- Nice to meet you too.

762
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,180
- Well hey,

763
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,090
there's some toiletries
down the hallway

764
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,000
and some clothes you can
grab for yourself as well.

765
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And there's some
showers out back,

766
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,230
get you cleaned up.

767
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:03,210
- Yeah, I need one.

768
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,000
- Yeah you do. (chuckles softly)

769
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,100
You look hungry, look.

770
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,120
Dinner'll be ready downstairs
in just a few minutes,

771
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,050
and I'll see you guys
in a little bit, okay?

772
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,010
- Alright.

773
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,190
- This is so good.

774
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,170
- It's fresh from the farm.

775
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,050
- It's incredible.

776
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:57,010
- So you guys are ready
to work tomorrow?

777
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,030
- Andrew?

778
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:03,230
- Yeah.

779
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,080
Yeah.

780
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,050
- Good.

781
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,120
I only ask you're ready to work

782
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,060
and do your fair share.

783
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,050
Understood?

784
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,100
Good.

785
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,110
Meet me out back of the
field at six.

786
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,140
I'll give you your jobs.

787
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,160
- You're leaving?

788
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,010
- Well we start pretty early

789
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,170
and I'm getting old.

790
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:37,000
You know, life here is better
than you can possibly imagine.

791
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,000
- Where are you going?

792
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,020
- Hey, Roberto.

793
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,040
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

794
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,030
- Sure. What's going on?

795
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,150
- I did some not so
great things to get here,

796
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:59,150
some things I probably
wouldn't have done otherwise.

797
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,090
- That's okay.

798
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,150
- Well, don't you want
me to tell you about it?

799
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,110
- No.

800
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,180
What matters now is you're here.

801
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:11,080
- Well, I just don't
wanna be a bad person.

802
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,030
- Simon.

803
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,050
I've known you since
you were a little boy.

804
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,230
You're a good person.

805
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,180
- My mom told me she didn't
want me to turn out like you but

806
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,140
why would she say
something like that?

807
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,060
- Your mom, she, uh,

808
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,170
she, uh, never
really forgave me.

809
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,140
- Well how's that fair?

810
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,090
- Simon, you can't
change people's feelings.

811
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,230
I did what I did,

812
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,230
and sometimes I regret it.

813
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,220
And sometimes it keeps
me up at night.

814
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,190
But I can't change past.

815
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,030
- What happened?

816
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,070
- Years ago when things
started taking their turn,

817
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:59,100
I was seeing this young woman.

818
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,000
Turns out she gets pregnant.

819
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,050
And I tried to tell her that
I would take care of her,

820
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:07,050
but she wasn't having
any part of that.

821
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,010
She said I could never
be a provider so she left

822
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,210
and took my child.

823
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:13,070
- I'm sorry.

824
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,210
My mom didn't know?

825
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,180
- She never knew she
even existed.

826
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,040
Anyway,

827
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,100
I could stay there anymore.

828
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,110
I felt so alone.

829
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:28,100
So I left and I came here.

830
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,130
I had no idea what I was doing,

831
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,220
I thought I was gonna
die in my field.

832
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,000
But I didn't.

833
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,140
I just kept working

834
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,170
and then crops started to grow

835
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,020
and people started to come.

836
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,060
I made it my mission that

837
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,120
no one would ever go hungry.

838
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,170
Simon, I never meant to
abandon you and your mother.

839
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,010
But I can't look back.

840
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,180
What good would that do?

841
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,000
- No, I don't think
you did anything wrong.

842
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,080
- Let me show you something.

843
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,090
- What is it?

844
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,090
- It's a lotus flower.

845
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,210
I remember reading years ago

846
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:07,050
about some Chinese scholar.

847
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:10,020
He used to say that I
love the lotus flower

848
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,220
because it grows in mud

849
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,150
but it always emerges beautiful.

850
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:17,010
- What do you think he
meant by that?

851
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,020
- Not really sure,

852
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,170
but it reminds me that it
doesn't matter

853
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,080
where you come from.

854
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,170
It only matters where you
are and where you're going.

855
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:28,110
You can't change the past,
Simon.

856
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,180
Look Simon.

857
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,090
I can't let myself get
stained by the mud,

858
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,010
and neither can you.

859
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,110
- This place is gonna break you.

860
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,040
- What?

861
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,030
- Your mind, man.
You don't understand.

862
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,130
Most newbies don't make
it through the first week.

863
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,150
Roberto boots their asses.

864
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,220
- Naw, Roberto wouldn't
do that to me,

865
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,040
I'm his family.

866
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:07,020
- He'll replace anybody
in a heartbeat,

867
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,220
even family.

868
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:11,060
No one gives a shit about you.

869
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,210
That's not how it works here.

870
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:15,050
Well,

871
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:17,010
thanks for the heads up.

872
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:19,190
- Always looking out
for newbies.

873
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,120
(calm but sharp music)

874
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,220
- Hey guys!

875
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:36,060
(moves into calm and
relaxing music)

876
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,140
Good morning.

877
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,230
Ready to get started?

878
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,050
Good. Let's go.

879
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,120
Well, your job this time
of year is pretty simple.

880
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,160
Pick fruit and vegetables,

881
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,050
do the weeding, and
water the crops.

882
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,090
Any questions?

883
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:59,190
- Nope.

884
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,120
- Alright well, I'ma get going.

885
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,210
Dinner's at my house tonight,
okay?

886
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:07,000
- Thanks Roberto.

887
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,100
For everything.

888
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,180
- Anytime Simon.

889
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:26,100
- How you know Roberto?

890
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,070
- His farming.

891
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,070
- Oh. Great.

892
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,020
- I'm gonna have you work
on the outskirts here

893
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,160
digging the new fields.

894
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:37,040
Dig up the top 12
inches of soil.

895
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,000
Keep going until this
whole area's done.

896
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,140
Here's your shovel.

897
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,120
- How long is this
supposed to take me?

898
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,080
- Listen,

899
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,200
you're gonna go until
the sun starts to set.

900
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,040
And you're gonna bring
the shovel back.

901
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,000
When the sun rise tomorrow,

902
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,040
you're gonna come back
and do it again.

903
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,100
And the next day, again
and again and again.

904
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,130
And once this area is done,

905
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,020
you start another.

906
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:43,040
- I can give you some advice,
if you want.

907
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,100
- No, I'm cool.

908
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,220
- Look, if we're gonna be
here together,

909
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,100
we may as well be on
speaking terms,

910
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,060
you know?

911
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,170
I'm sorry about the way
things turned out.

912
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,030
- No, we all got here, right?

913
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,150
- I was just really freaked
out about everything, you know?

914
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:02,110
- Yeah.

915
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:08,060
- Alright, I'll leave you to it.

916
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,140
You feel alright?

917
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,180
- Yeah.

918
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,120
Yeah, just some blisters.

919
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,180
How was your day?

920
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,140
- [Jessie] Pretty good.

921
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,190
Got to pick
vegetables with Simon.

922
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:39,190
- Ah, I see.

923
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:43,210
So you guys are working
together, huh?

924
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,010
- Yeah.

925
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,150
- Who's in charge?

926
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,180
- Excuse me?

927
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,090
Who are you and what are
you doing on my land?

928
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,220
- Joseph. Hi.

929
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,150
I just need food for me
and my children.

930
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:05,040
I was wondering if you could--

931
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,100
- You expect me to
give you my food?

932
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:13,060
- I would appreciate it if
you could spare something.

933
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,040
- Can you work?

934
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,110
- Not like I used to,

935
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:18,210
but I noticed that you got
a fine garden out there,

936
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:20,070
I can help.

937
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,110
- We need people to work
in the fields.

938
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,160
- I can't stand for
long, it hurts my knees.

939
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,230
But I can help you sow
those vegetables.

940
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:30,040
- I'm sorry.
I don't need you here.

941
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,100
- Just let him help, Robert.

942
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,060
- Simon!

943
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,130
Let me handle this.

944
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,170
- He's gonna die out there!

945
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:39,140
- Please, just let me help.

946
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:42,150
- I said I don't need you here.

947
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,210
It's time for you to go.

948
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:48,210
- I'm tired.
Could we just stay the night?

949
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,230
- If I were you, I'd
leave right now.

950
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,180
- You see that guy who came in?

951
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,010
- Yeah, what about him?

952
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,050
- I don't know.

953
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,080
I think what Roberto did
was kinda wrong.

954
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,050
- You kidding?

955
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,150
I would've done the same thing.

956
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:21,210
He's just some lowlife
looking for a handout.

957
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:23,000
He can't help anyone here.

958
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,090
- Hey, he's still a
person though.

959
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,130
- Man, if that type of
shit bothers you,

960
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,180
then you really don't
belong here.

961
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,140
Pricks like that show
up all the time.

962
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,060
Want us to give them our stuff.

963
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,230
- He's not a prick!
The guy was crippled!

964
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:35,130
- I'd shoot him if they let me.

965
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:39,170
Might have to pretty soon
if that jerk comes back.

966
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,150
- Hey Simon.

967
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,150
Hey.

968
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:56,190
I gotta talk to you for
a minute, man.

969
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,210
Look, I know you're not very
happy with me right now,

970
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:02,120
but I need to ask you a favor.

971
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,180
- Yeah, what's that?

972
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:08,140
- (sighs) I need you to not
tell people about my leg.

973
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,140
It's gotten a lot worse

974
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:12,190
and if they find out,
they're gonna kick me out.

975
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,140
- I don't know what to say.

976
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,200
- Look man,

977
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,160
I did what I had to do.

978
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,180
Alright?
You would've done

979
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,170
the same thing.

980
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,130
- I wouldn't have just
left my friend

981
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,070
in the middle of nowhere.

982
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,220
- Friend?

983
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:26,130
We only knew each
other a few days.

984
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:29,010
- When we first met Issac, you
told me you were using him.

985
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,050
- That's not what I meant!

986
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:34,090
- Yeah, but that's how you've
always seen me, isn't it?

987
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:37,040
- Sure. Okay when we
first got together, maybe.

988
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,070
But then something happened,
alright?

989
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,100
Maybe we became friends,

990
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,030
maybe I'm just a fucking idiot,

991
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:46,110
but you do what you gotta
do to survive.

992
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,010
- Don't worry, I
won't tell anyone.

993
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,030
- Thanks man.

994
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,160
- Hey.

995
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,130
I just wanted to thank you.

996
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:16,030
- For what?
I didn't do anything.

997
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:18,080
- You did what you could.

998
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,180
I was wondering if I
could get some of those?

999
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,120
- I can't just give you
these, I'd get in trouble.

1000
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,230
- Oh come on kid.

1001
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:25,220
Well you know what it's
like out here.

1002
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:29,010
We all gotta work together,
right?

1003
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:32,060
(still and concerning music)

1004
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,090
Thank you.

1005
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:37,090
Yeah they sell these in town,
they're just so expensive.

1006
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,110
- What do you think
you're doing?

1007
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:42,010
- He's hungry and we
have more than enough.

1008
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,020
- You thought you could
just come back here?

1009
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,040
Just take whatever you wanted?

1010
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,100
- (pants) I'm sorry.

1011
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,060
- You didn't earn these.

1012
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,120
- I'm sorry.

1013
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,160
I said I would work for them,
please.

1014
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,030
Please, please.

1015
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,170
- I hope for your sake

1016
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,210
I never see you here again.

1017
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:58,170
Get out!

1018
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,220
- You can't do that to people!

1019
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:04,200
- Stay out of it Simon!

1020
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,090
- What happened to you?

1021
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,110
- You broke the rules.

1022
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:15,140
No dinner tonight or
breakfast in the morning.

1023
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,080
Now get back to work!

1024
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:22,050
Do you wanna make it four meals?

1025
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,010
- No sir.

1026
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:36,210
(Andrew grunts and pants)

1027
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:58,090
(Andrew grunts in pain)

1028
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:01,150
(still and calm music)

1029
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,160
- We got you something.

1030
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,220
I know it's not much but

1031
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:16,000
I thought you could use it.

1032
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,030
- Where'd you get this?

1033
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,100
- We snuck it out of
the dining hall.

1034
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,190
- Yeah.

1035
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,150
- Wasn't that hard really.

1036
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:24,220
It's not like they have armed
guards at all the exits.

1037
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,220
- Thank you.

1038
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,060
- I know we don't deserve it but

1039
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,060
I hope you can not hate us.

1040
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:35,070
- Well, I did get you shot.

1041
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:37,100
- You didn't get me shot.

1042
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,060
- We can make it work here,
I know it.

1043
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:47,070
Anyway, good night guys.

1044
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:56,020
(Andrew grunts in discomfort)

1045
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,000
- There's something wrong
with this place.

1046
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,020
You and Jessie need to get
out as soon as you can.

1047
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,010
(moves into calm but
concerning music)

1048
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:04,130
- Why wouldn't you come with us?

1049
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:07,120
- I can't get
anywhere on this leg.

1050
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,060
Simon, listen to me.

1051
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,040
I love her.

1052
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:17,010
I want her to go with
somebody that I can trust.

1053
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,090
- Thank you for the food.

1054
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,190
- You're welcome.

1055
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:26,060
Now get some rest.

1056
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:36,030
(Simon sighs)

1057
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:44,130
Where's Thomas?

1058
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:47,110
- I don't know.

1059
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:50,070
Roberto called him over
to the southern fields

1060
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:51,190
a few minutes ago.

1061
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,100
(still and calm music)

1062
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,140
Simon? What are you doing?

1063
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:11,120
- Roberto, what are you doing?

1064
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,080
- When your friend arrived,

1065
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,000
he failed to mention
his infected leg.

1066
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,060
He's neglected his
injuries to the point

1067
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,010
that soon he won't be
able to contribute.

1068
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,200
- So what, you're not
gonna help him?

1069
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,170
- We don't have the resources.

1070
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:25,050
This community is built
upon able bodies.

1071
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,190
It only works when
people contribute.

1072
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:30,120
I can't keep somebody that
doesn't have a purpose.

1073
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,080
Just can't allow it.

1074
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,160
- So you're just
gonna let him die?

1075
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,170
- Do you have any idea

1076
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,220
how many people are
dying out there?

1077
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:39,140
It's not my job to help them!

1078
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,010
It's my job to protect
the life that we built.

1079
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,030
Our survival.

1080
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,150
I'm not about to sabotage
this community

1081
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,210
with the life of some
worthless freeloader.

1082
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,090
- [Jessie] Andrew!

1083
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,020
- Simon!

1084
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,120
Get back to your field
and get to work.

1085
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,050
- No.

1086
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,030
- Don't be ridiculous.

1087
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:07,030
For the first time in months,

1088
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,040
you have a home, food,

1089
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,230
people that care about you,
purpose.

1090
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:14,210
You can't just throw
that all away!

1091
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:23,030
Simon look. I love you.

1092
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,100
Okay? We're family.

1093
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,100
We gotta stick together.

1094
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,210
I'm all you got!

1095
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,070
Simon!

1096
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,170
- Simon.

1097
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,100
- I'm sorry.

1098
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,120
- For what?

1099
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:54,160
- None of this would've
happened if it wasn't for me.

1100
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:58,110
You know, I didn't think things
would turn out like this.

1101
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:01,130
- We never should have
abandoned you.

1102
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,220
You're a good kid.

1103
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,030
You and Andrew are all I have.

1104
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,110
- What're we gonna do?

1105
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,060
- I don't know.

1106
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:26,110
(calm but foreboding
and somber music)

1107
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:32,190
(Andrew grunts weakly)

1108
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:25,130
(moves into calm and
peaceful music)

1109
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
(people mumble in the distance)

1110
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:15,030
(peaceful yet somber music)
