(moody rock music)

46
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:17,790
- We just got back from the scourging.

47
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,071
We went to the barn,

48
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:22,387
we didn't find anything useful that way.

49
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:25,595
You guys go tend to the horses.

00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:29,762

00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,034
- Let me help you.

54
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,458
- Thanks.

55
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,968
In here.

56
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:06,051
(crying)

57
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:15,051
A little more.

58
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:17,677
Okay.

59
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:18,677
Chuck it in.

60
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:27,798
(coughs)

61
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,416
Lab's lookin' better, Doc.

62
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,088
- Thank you, I'm just
trying to make the best of

63
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:33,947
the combinations that I have,

64
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,940
which are more than barbaric.

65
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,877
- We're sorry, it's the best we can do.

66
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:42,191
After the war, nothing
has ever been the same.

67
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:44,377
They were born under ground

68
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,900
in those caves, in those fallout shelters,

69
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,261
And while the scientists
were living in luxury,

70
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,008
they were reeing day and night,

71
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:54,017
50 feet under ground, why--

72
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:55,786
- That's enough.

73
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:58,862
Larry, Doc joined us to help our cause.

74
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:01,622
She believed in what we stood for.

75
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:04,515
She gave up her luxury for us.

76
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:05,886
So can it.

77
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:07,780
- He's right in a way, though.

78
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,448
We're in the wrong, you guys are right.

79
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:13,756
I mean, we made the chemicals
to destroy the enemy

80
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,811
and instead we made mutants and beasts.

81
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,186
Strange beasts like those found

82
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:22,093
in prehistoric times on this planet.

83
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:26,260
I joined you guys to find
restitution for what I've done.

84
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:30,643
And try to reverse those process.

85
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:35,207
What's happened to your leader?

86
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,992
- We don't know.

87
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:39,278
We saw her laying outside,

88
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,278
bleeding to death so
brought her in here to you.

89
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:52,471
- Syringe.

90
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:56,905
- Come on, Rachelle.

91
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,773
- [Larry] Well Doc, what is it?

92
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,750
- She's been bitten by a talnid.

93
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,374
Their bite is very deadly.

94
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,912
First it just makes them sick.

95
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:51,158
And then they go into a coma.

96
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:53,612
And then they rot from the inside out.

97
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:54,612
- Oh my god!

98
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,631
Then we can't save her?

99
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,803
You mean to tell me there's no cure!

100
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:02,263
- There's only one cure,

101
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:05,138
and it's back in my old
office in Armageddon City,

102
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:08,032
and I'm forbidden to ever
step foot there again.

103
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:10,441
See the talnid is our baby,

104
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:14,141
a genetic hybrid, a toxic nightmare.

105
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,450
It could destroy all the
people on this planet

106
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,296
if it weren't for the
fact that they only lived

107
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:21,815
for an average of 90 days.

108
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:24,058
- Why in Armageddon City?

109
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:25,946
- Because the use of toxic chemicals

110
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,615
has been outlawed everywhere else

111
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:30,615
except for in Armageddon City.

112
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,911
That ignorant major, Salacious Thatch,

113
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:36,210
has promoted the use
of genetic alterations

114
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,994
that my coworkers still do.

115
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,854
What Thatch plans to do
is buy up all the land

116
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:42,884
and build more cities

117
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:44,986
so he can make more income for himself.

118
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:46,400
- Whoever this Thatch is

119
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,593
is not going to stop us
from saving Rachelle,

120
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:49,941
or at least me.

121
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:50,917
- Me either.

122
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,867
That fat piece of shit's
not going intimidate me!

123
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,750
He slaughtered my family
that lived in Armageddon City

124
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,163
when it was New York.

125
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:00,116
My father owned his own business,

126
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:01,946
he was a formal retailer.

127
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:04,810
He rented out clothes to
people who were in need.

128
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,054
Thatch tried to buy my father,

129
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,546
but my father wouldn't sell out to him.

130
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:13,023
And he killed my father.

131
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:15,392
I'm not gonna let him do anything else.

132
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:17,718
I'm gonna barbecue his balls!

133
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:20,420
- Trianna, it's up to
you to save Rachelle.

134
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,811
We can't afford to let you
have a large group of warriors.

135
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:26,298
We need all the protection we can get.

136
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,723
What I want you to do, is go out,

137
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:31,038
find two of your most trusted warriors,

138
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,962
meet me at the assembly
hall in 30 minutes.

139
00:14:34,962 --> 00:14:39,129
(dogs barking)
(foreboding music)

140
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:50,287
(growling)

141
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:29,860
(crashing)
(dramatic music)

142
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:07,626
(dramatic music)

143
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:08,462
(growling)

144
00:16:08,462 --> 00:16:09,320
(screaming)

145
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,487
(yelling)

146
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,603
(laughing)

147
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,770
(yelling)

148
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,846
- [Julia] Trianna!

149
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:37,679
- Trianna!

150
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:41,175
Trianna!

151
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:55,246
Fucker!

152
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:56,579
God damn fucker!

153
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,492
(yelling)

154
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:06,664
Get him!

155
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:08,609
You better stab him!

156
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,776
(yelling)

157
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,993
- [Man] You can go faster than that.

158
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,727
- [Janna] Get your arm outta the way.

159
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:29,894
(yelling)

160
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,593
I don't wanna hit your arm.

161
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,760
(yelling)

162
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:47,701
- That was easy!

163
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:50,494
- Mr Thatch?

164
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:54,041
I'm afraid I got some
bad news to tell you.

165
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,874
- What!

166
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,736
Spill your guts or I will!

167
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:59,545
- Two more experiments got away.

168
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,206
And they're loose in the
city, what should I do?

169
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,994
- Calm down, no big deal.

170
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,730
We simply wait for...

171
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,848
A few mangled bodies to show up and...

172
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:09,145
If they show the right signs,

173
00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:12,362
or if there's any trace of
the saliva in their wounds,

174
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:16,219
you know cus people die here all the time.

175
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,829
There's no need to panic anyone.

176
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:21,398
We'll search the area
where the bodies are found.

177
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,859
- [Soldier] And what
if they don't turn up?

178
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:27,071
- We burn the files and
tell we know nothing.

179
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:29,064
That's it, we just, and you can go relax,

180
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,194
play a video game,
watch a good comedy like

181
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,903
I Spit on Your Grave, that cheers me up.

182
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:34,736
- Yes, sir.

183
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:36,431
(laughing)

184
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:39,181
(dramatic music)

185
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,204
(dramatic music)

186
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,169
- Let's tie em up to these poles.

187
00:19:15,473 --> 00:19:18,890
(moody electronic music)

188
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:10,103
- Are you sure you can handle this battle?

189
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,399
It's better to lose one than all of you.

190
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,232
- No!

191
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:16,495
If she dies, so does years
of priceless information.

192
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:19,607
And so does her child, our newest warrior.

193
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:20,785
We will exceed

194
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:24,217
if it destroys all but one of us.

195
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:25,250
- Okay.

196
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,401
But be on guard and utilize all the skills

197
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:31,151
that you have learned through the years.

198
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:32,818
May God be with you.

199
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:38,563
- Everybody get their weapons, okay?

200
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:41,075
Alright?

201
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:41,908
Let's go.

202
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:53,533
- Wait for, no no, wait for me Mama!

203
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,616
- No, you can't go.

204
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:56,508
- I wanna go!

205
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:58,253
- No, you can't.

206
00:20:58,253 --> 00:20:59,836
- Go back in there.

207
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:23,061
- The weather's getting worse, Mr Thatch.

208
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:24,894
I fear it's acid rain.

209
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:28,448
I don't think we're gonna have any luck.

210
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,869
- Get me General Morbius right now!

211
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:31,748
- General Morbuis?

212
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,866
Yes sir.

213
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:34,199
General Morbius!

214
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,016
- You idiot!

215
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:38,099
I'll send you down

216
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,044
to fucking sewage waste depot!

217
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:43,334
Let you wallow with all, in
all the shit with our slaves!

218
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:44,167
- But--

219
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,928
- The prisal can send you down

220
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:48,221
to the disease-infected whores

221
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:50,116
who work in our city's ghettos,

222
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:51,329
and let them wipe the puss of your

223
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:53,739
sweating, oozing sores all over you!

224
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:55,211
- Hey, I just do what you told me to do!

225
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,523
- You're gonna talk back to me!

226
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,994
- I did what you told me!

227
00:21:57,994 --> 00:22:01,064
- If I wanted you to yell out
at General Morbius like this,

228
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:02,408
General Morbius!

229
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:03,915
I can do that myself!

230
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:04,942
(door closes)

231
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,878
- You sent to the Torture Room for me sir?

232
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:10,347
- Yes, Sergeant Romero has just reported

233
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,521
that non-mutant life

234
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,381
has entered the Nightmare Zone.

235
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:15,515
I want you to take

236
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:16,753
three,

237
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,170
three men and intercept them.

238
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:21,364
Oh, and--

239
00:22:21,364 --> 00:22:22,343
- Armor!

240
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:24,027
- Armor, yes.

241
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:25,548
Pringle here has just informed me

242
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:28,216
that it looks like we're
going to have some acid rain.

243
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:31,326
And I was wondering what
kind of armor our men had,

244
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:33,861
if it could take the acid rain?

245
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:36,248
- The only kind of armor we
have available at this point

246
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:37,498
is nikad clave.

247
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:40,146
It covers the head

248
00:22:40,146 --> 00:22:42,955
and torso area, but
leaves the groin exposed.

249
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:43,788
- Good job!

250
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:44,621
- Yes!

251
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:45,848
- Very good job, that means
that they won't be having

252
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:46,989
any more rugrats to run around this city!

253
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:48,718
- No, no little impies.

254
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:50,719
- Wipe out the sexual organs,
it's gonna be a fun town.

255
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,022
Good job, good job.
- You have a good future

256
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,710
in this company.

257
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,897
- Very good job.

258
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:56,525
- You will stay in the city.

259
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,545
As long as you don't screw up.

260
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,593
- Thank you sir.

261
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:02,077
Now back to this non-mutant life,

262
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:05,588
suppose theyre wanderers or survivors?

263
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:06,719
- Terminate them.

264
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,636
(determined music)

265
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,343
- You know what?

266
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:22,982
Hey.

267
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:25,768
It really makes me made
Lotus backed out on us.

268
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:28,685
- Yeah, well that's a bimbo for ya.

269
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:48,150
- Come on.

270
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,642
- [Janna] I got it.

271
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,873
- Oh god, I think I'm gonna get sick.

272
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:24,794
- [Larry] You alright?

273
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:25,900
- Don't do that.

274
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,119
(exclaims)

275
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,536
- Nasty!
- Thanks.

276
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:35,682
- [Larry] Hey yuck, I
think it has a wallet.

277
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,599
Be careful!

278
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,513
- [Both] Who is it?

279
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,219
- Oh man.

280
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:46,262
(exclaims)

281
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:47,095
- You know what?

282
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:48,369
- [Janna] He was ugly to start out with.

283
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:49,593
- It's probably some poor bastard

284
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:52,434
who drank the chemical waste.

285
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:55,104
- [Larry] Farmer maybe?

286
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:55,937
- Oh man.

287
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:03,434
- Well, just leave it there, let's go.

288
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:04,267
- Come on.

289
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:07,017
(dramatic music)

290
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:46,508
- You ready?

291
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:48,995
Careful Trianna!

292
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,373
- Alright, come.

293
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:04,331
Check on that side.

294
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:12,341
- [Larry] Clear.

295
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,091
I hear something, what is it?

296
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:19,924
(shushing)

297
00:26:19,924 --> 00:26:21,897
- [Sapphire] Help!

298
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,109
Help me!

299
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:24,448
- What's that noise, Trianna?

300
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,281
- I don't know.

301
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:26,759
- Please!

302
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,592
Help!

303
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:29,762
Get me out of here!

304
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:30,638
- [Larry] What is it?

305
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:32,388
- Get me out of here!

306
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:34,305
Help me!

307
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,137
- Sapphire!

308
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:40,668
(exclaims)

309
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:42,799
Help me!

310
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,549
- [Larry] I'm trying!

311
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,826
- I thought you were dead!
(dramatic music)

312
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,412
- [Sapphire] This place is
a trap, you have to leave!

313
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,608
- [Larry] A trap!

314
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:56,441
- [Janna] Come on!

315
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:57,989
Don't leave her, get her up.

316
00:26:57,989 --> 00:26:59,535
Get up!

317
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,952
- It's all clear.

318
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,122
- I'll get it.

319
00:27:04,596 --> 00:27:05,457
- [Trianna] We gotta get out, come on!

320
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,207
(dramatic music)

321
00:27:12,184 --> 00:27:14,434
(groaning)

322
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:23,115
- I know they're in here.

323
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,012
Morbius may have given
up, but I'm not going to.

324
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:25,997
You men ready?

325
00:27:25,997 --> 00:27:28,594
- [Soldier] Yeah, I smell bimbos!

326
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:30,844
(shouting)

327
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:34,616
- Come on through, Doug.

328
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:35,449
This way.

329
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:40,975
(dramatic music)

330
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:41,808
- Come on, guys.

331
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:44,175
- Wait stop, let me get her.

332
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:45,508
Here, hold this.

333
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
- You're okay, Sapphire.

334
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:51,951
- [Larry] I'll pick up the weapons!

335
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:52,951
- It's okay.

336
00:27:57,785 --> 00:27:58,918
- [Pringle] Let's go soldiers.

337
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:00,168
I smell bimbos!

338
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:26,558
This way!

339
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:27,391
Bimbos!

340
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:29,558
(yelling)

341
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:31,659
- Retreat!

342
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:35,028
You bimbos go that way,
I'll distract them!

343
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:36,971
Here, take these!

344
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:37,804
- Be careful!

345
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:38,974
- [Larry] Yes.

346
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:41,224
(shouting)

347
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,250
- Bimbos!

348
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,500
(shouting)

349
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,463
- Okay.

350
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:58,124
(screaming)

351
00:28:58,124 --> 00:29:00,374
(shouting)

352
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:04,238
(screaming)

353
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:10,162
- Go over there!

354
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:13,105
- [Triann] Where?

355
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:14,184
- [Janna] Over there!

356
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:15,017
Now!

357
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:15,986
(screaming)

358
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:18,153
(yelling)

359
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:24,777
(swords clashing)

360
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:38,945
(whimpering)

361
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,113
- Sit down.

362
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,489
Right here, right here.

363
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,406
Right here.

364
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,433
Okay.

365
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:48,847
Lift your head up.

366
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,893
You're gonna die, you need food!

367
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:51,726
- Water.

368
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,823
I need water.

369
00:29:56,903 --> 00:29:57,736
- Stay here.

370
00:29:57,736 --> 00:29:59,268
Sapphire, listen to me.

371
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:00,599
Listen to me, sweetie.

372
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,218
Stay here.

373
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,515
You're gonna be okay.

374
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:04,348
Oh my god!

375
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:06,819
You listen to me!

376
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:08,987
Oh shit.

377
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:11,409
I'll be right back!

378
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,024
- [Sapphire] Water.

379
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:23,346
- Ya!

380
00:30:23,346 --> 00:30:24,846
Come on, ya bimbo!

381
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:32,978
(yelling)

382
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,326
- Come on, fight me like a man!

383
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:42,159
- You want it like a man?

384
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:42,992
- Yeah!

385
00:30:42,992 --> 00:30:43,825
- You want it like a man?

386
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:44,658
(exclaims)

387
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:47,974
You fight like a man, you piece of shit!

388
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:50,141
(yelling)

389
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:54,454
- Draw on that!

390
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,967
- Son of a bitch!

391
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:05,526
- You can't hit the broad side of a barn!

392
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:06,609
Oh, my wrist!

393
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:29,606
(swords clashing)

394
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:52,874
(groaning)

395
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:06,680
(birds singing)

396
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,140
(groaning)

397
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:26,804
(exclaiming)

398
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:35,757
- Shew.

399
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,730
- Dr West, come on.

400
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,339
Doc, you alright?
(groaning)

401
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:49,996
She get you too?

402
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:51,409
Come on man, come on.

403
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:52,816
It's alright.

404
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:53,899
It's alright.

405
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:57,476
We gotta go report this to Thatch.

406
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,309
We got to.

407
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:01,799
We'll get back at them bimbos,

408
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,808
if it's the last thing I do.

409
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,239
Come on, it'll be alright.

410
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:07,303
We'll get em back.

411
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:09,248
I just had the fight of my life, too.

412
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,842
Let's go get Thatch,

413
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:13,603
tell him what Morbius did to us.

414
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:16,853
(energetic rock music)

415
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:21,025
- Wait.

416
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:23,585
Wait.

417
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,620
- You there?

418
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:40,647
(exclaims)

419
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:44,697
You okay?

420
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:45,530
- Yeah.

421
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:48,853
I'm alright.

422
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:50,041
- Where's Julia?

423
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:50,874
- Julia?

424
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,100
Julia!

425
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,933
- Julia!

426
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:56,054
- [All] Julia!

427
00:33:57,065 --> 00:33:58,918
- There she is.
- Julia!

428
00:33:58,918 --> 00:33:59,835
- You okay?

429
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:03,576
- [Julia] I'm right here.

430
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:06,177
Look at their weapons.

431
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,927
- [Trianna] You okay?

432
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:13,145
Well now we gotta find their weapons, too.

433
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:15,395
(chatting)

434
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:28,401
(pole clanks)

435
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:33,102
- Here.

436
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:45,734
(exclaiming)

437
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:48,625
(whistling)
- That's so cool,

438
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:51,417
you can see your face shine!

439
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:52,873
- [Janna] God!

440
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:54,040
You lucky dog!

441
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,663
- Trade ya.

442
00:34:56,663 --> 00:34:57,496
- No way.

443
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:01,981
(moody electronic music)

444
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:09,926
- Professor Thatch.

445
00:35:09,926 --> 00:35:12,610
General Morbius is here to see you.

446
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,212
- Well now, let me guess.

447
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:17,443
You bring me bad news.

448
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:19,812
News that you fucked up another mission!

449
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:22,020
- You should listen to him this time.

450
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,853
- Alright.

451
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:25,950
- So there's a small band of warriors

452
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,307
heading up from the south.

453
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:31,195
They seem barbaric in nature
and extremely pissed off.

454
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,198
They killed three of my best troopers,

455
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,676
and they're women.

456
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:35,592
- Women!

457
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,838
Fucking women!

458
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:39,466
What is this the ERA revisited!

459
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:40,831
What do they want!

460
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:42,042
- I don't know!

461
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,997
They're heavily armed and very pissed off.

462
00:35:43,997 --> 00:35:46,124
Kinda like ninja commandos.

463
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:49,854
Only with a great set of
tits and a mean ass attitude.

464
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:52,021
(yelling)

465
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,213
- God, somebody in the Nightmare Zone!

466
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:59,488
That's it with you,
you're done, you're out!

467
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:00,321
(laughs)

468
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:02,287
- [Pringle] What do you
plan on doing about this?

469
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,973
- That's what they don't know, sir.

470
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:05,446
You can only enter the Nightmare Zone.

471
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:07,722
No one ever reemerges.

472
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:11,131
- They did it once
before, and they beat you!

473
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,849
- Women only get one chance with me!

474
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:14,528
Never a second!

475
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:17,771
- Never raise your voice with me, ever!

476
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:20,069
You act that way again, if
you fuck up on this mission,

477
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:22,093
that's it, your human's due and
the camel mutants out there,

478
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:23,593
do you understand?

479
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:26,485
- Yes sir.

480
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:27,765
- Good!

481
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:30,217
- Now, unless you have
something else to say

482
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:32,045
get out of my office!

483
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:33,287
- Thank you.

484
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:34,132
- I'll go with him.

485
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:35,801
- You do that!

486
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:38,758
And if he fucks up, you bring me his head!

487
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:40,731
- [Pringle] Oh he won't do that.

488
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,481
(dramatic music)

489
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:59,163
- We got five miles to the Nightmare Zone.

490
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:02,580
One hour and 37 minutes of daylight left.

491
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,004
- We better get a move on.

492
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,415
We have got to do this for us,

493
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:09,498
and Rachelle.

494
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:14,675
Let's go.

495
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:26,798
(mysterious music)

496
00:37:50,757 --> 00:37:53,507
- Let's stop and rest right here.

497
00:37:58,824 --> 00:37:59,991
Hey, Sapphire.

498
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:04,652
(swords clashing)

499
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:10,461
(grunting)

500
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,688
(Larry talking)

501
00:38:21,894 --> 00:38:24,644
(dramatic music)

502
00:38:32,427 --> 00:38:35,010
- [Man] Go ahead, kick it down.

503
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:39,705
(rumbling)

504
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:43,725
- What's going on?

505
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,041
Wait!

506
00:38:56,573 --> 00:38:57,990
Hold on, hold on!

507
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:01,566
Hold on!

508
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,096
Wait!

509
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,013
It stopped.

510
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,353
(yelling)

511
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:13,686
(screaming)

512
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:06,155
(grunting)

513
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:08,408
(Larry grumbling)

514
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,806
- Okay!

515
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:10,639
It's dead.

516
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:14,459
(celebrating)

517
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:20,965
- Great job, Janna.

518
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:22,817
- Leave it me to raise a little hell,

519
00:40:22,817 --> 00:40:23,650
literally.

520
00:40:24,788 --> 00:40:25,992
- We're not even there yet.

521
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:27,632
The sun's setting down,

522
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:29,916
so let's just turn back.

523
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:30,849
- No!

524
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:32,294
We have come too far!

525
00:40:32,294 --> 00:40:35,145
We are not turning back, we have to go.

526
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:36,812
Let's start walking.

527
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:42,186
I don't want to hear any
complaints from anyone!

528
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:26,275
- [Man] Action.

529
00:42:34,906 --> 00:42:37,239
(cocks gun)

530
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:51,109
- If you want something right,
you gotta do it yourself!

531
00:42:56,568 --> 00:42:58,735
(talking)

532
00:43:04,363 --> 00:43:05,851
- Well?

533
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:07,673
Here we are guys.

534
00:43:07,673 --> 00:43:09,006
Armageddon City.

535
00:45:08,153 --> 00:45:09,781
- I swear to god, the
bimbos were right here!

536
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:10,614
I know I saw em!

537
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:12,670
- Well where are they now?

538
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,653
- I don't know where they are!

539
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:15,722
- Where are they?

540
00:45:15,722 --> 00:45:16,577
- I don't know!

541
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:18,704
- Well where's General Morbius?

542
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:20,026
- General Morbius

543
00:45:20,026 --> 00:45:22,230
left us the minute we left the camp.

544
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,551
- Well where the fuck is he now?

545
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:24,921
- I have no clue where he went!

546
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,609
- I want him brought
to me, I want him dead!

547
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:28,313
- He's a deserter and
we gotta get the bimbos,

548
00:45:28,313 --> 00:45:29,194
so if you wanna grouch him

549
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,774
get your fat ass and get him yourself,

550
00:45:30,774 --> 00:45:33,601
I'm going after these bimbos, buddy!

551
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:36,300
(splashing)

552
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,883
- [Thatch] Come on!

553
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:41,884
(dramatic music)

554
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:47,736
(talking)

555
00:45:59,402 --> 00:46:00,235
(yelling)

556
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:01,068
(screaming)

557
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:04,318
(energetic rock music)

558
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:10,468
- Let him go, let him go now!

559
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:11,427
Let him go!

560
00:46:11,427 --> 00:46:12,655
- [Trianna] Drop your weapons!

561
00:46:12,655 --> 00:46:15,240
- Stop, the weapons, now!

562
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,267
Get in line, back up!

563
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,434
(yelling)

564
00:46:20,484 --> 00:46:21,522
- [Sapphire] Let her go!

565
00:46:21,522 --> 00:46:22,355
- Give me your weapons,

566
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:23,499
gimme your weapons, there.

567
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:25,087
- Get back!

568
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,087
Don't even reach for it!

569
00:46:27,922 --> 00:46:29,775
Stop ya little ho!

570
00:46:29,775 --> 00:46:32,025
Welcome to Armageddon City!

571
00:46:32,988 --> 00:46:36,990
We even have your rooms
ready for you here.

572
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,990
In our jail!

573
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:39,864
(laughing)

574
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,235
- Sorry, we really can't stay.

575
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:42,068
We were just--

576
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:44,872
(yelling)

577
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:46,526
- [Thatch] Why have you come to my city!

578
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:48,952
- Well it wasn't for those
warm, friendly smiles.

579
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:50,535
- [Thatch] Shut up!

580
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,712
- I think people need to line up here.

581
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:55,812
Line up!

582
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,731
Get in line!
- Let go!

583
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,564
- Shut up!

584
00:46:58,564 --> 00:46:59,671
- Line up, now!

585
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:00,642
Now!

586
00:47:00,642 --> 00:47:02,475
Now!
- Just let her go!

587
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:07,779
- Line up.

588
00:47:08,747 --> 00:47:10,914
(yelling)

589
00:47:18,678 --> 00:47:19,984
- Can you believe this!

590
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:24,539
She was trying to take
the gun outta my hands!

591
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:26,872
(screaming)

592
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,721
(yelling)

593
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,632
- [Thatch] Shut up!

594
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,102
(talking)

595
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,024
- [Trianna] You are sick!

596
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:04,627
- Move it, keep moving!

597
00:48:04,627 --> 00:48:06,248
I don't wanna see anyone stopping.

598
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:08,775
(exclaims)

599
00:48:08,775 --> 00:48:12,809
Come on, move again and I'll
take this bitch out, move!

600
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:13,642
Drop it.
- Drop it!

601
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:14,475
- Drop the weapon!

602
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:15,314
(club clatters)

603
00:48:15,314 --> 00:48:17,094
- Alright now, get in line!

604
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,094
Get in line!

605
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:22,674
Get in line, get in line.

606
00:48:23,892 --> 00:48:25,978
To the door, now!

607
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:28,348
- Just keep marching!

608
00:48:28,348 --> 00:48:29,181
Move it!

609
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,812
(yelling)

610
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:33,409
You.

611
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,797
I got a problem with you, buddy.

612
00:48:35,797 --> 00:48:38,255
If you ever attack us again
- Let go!

613
00:48:38,255 --> 00:48:39,525
I won't give you a trial
- Keep walking!

614
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:41,021
- Before I kick your ass!

615
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,536
I'll cut you to pieces.

616
00:48:42,536 --> 00:48:45,353
And I'll feed ya to Thatch.

617
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:48,155
I think you need to quit
squirming now, don't you?

618
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:49,572
Alright, move it!

619
00:48:56,782 --> 00:48:57,615
(talking)

620
00:48:57,615 --> 00:48:58,617
- Wait!

621
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:00,290
You men take

622
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,109
the rest of the bimbos

623
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:03,109
to the cell.

624
00:49:04,088 --> 00:49:06,822
This pretty little butterfly goes with me.

625
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:07,905
Come my dear.

626
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:13,945
(dramatic music)

627
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,719
(howling)

628
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:38,191
- Oh my god, what is that?

629
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:39,238
- It's a talnid.

630
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:40,226
- [Lotus] Are they dangerous?

631
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:42,239
- Very dangerous, they're deadly.

632
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:43,709
(growling)

633
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,081
Why didn't you go with the other girls?

634
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:47,308
- I didn't feel like I was
ready to go on a mission yet.

635
00:49:47,308 --> 00:49:48,422
Felt like I had

636
00:49:48,422 --> 00:49:50,018
make it my way.

637
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:51,649
- Since you haven't had a lot of training?

638
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:52,732
- [Lotus] No.

639
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:10,860
- There you are.

640
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,693
(groaning)

641
00:50:11,693 --> 00:50:13,573
Where you think you've been?

642
00:50:13,573 --> 00:50:15,751
- Sorry General Mr Thatch.

643
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:17,755
Ow!
- Get in here!

644
00:50:17,755 --> 00:50:19,838
- I in fact can slide in.

645
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:25,235
- Well, I can forgive you this time.

646
00:50:28,682 --> 00:50:32,416
But this is twice you've fucked up now!

647
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:33,849
- [Morbius] Sorry, sir.

648
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:35,564
There are mutants everywhere.

649
00:50:35,564 --> 00:50:37,981
And I saw three more talnids!

650
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:41,350
They're fighting the toxic waste.

651
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,617
- So the talnid population is growing?

652
00:50:44,617 --> 00:50:45,606
- [Morbius] Yes sir.

653
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:46,537
- Good!

654
00:50:46,537 --> 00:50:48,329
Exactly as a planned!

655
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:50,866
- It's not my fault, sir!

656
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:53,799
I can't help it if you
armed me with poor men

657
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:57,216
who can't seem to fight god damned women!

658
00:51:01,755 --> 00:51:05,088
- Just remember you're one of those men!

659
00:51:09,697 --> 00:51:11,625
Now, we have these

660
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,292
women, these bimbos,

661
00:51:15,024 --> 00:51:17,293
down in our holding cell.

662
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:20,521
I want you and Dr West to interrogate them

663
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:22,969
and find out why they are here.

664
00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:24,216
- Then let me interrogate them!

665
00:51:24,216 --> 00:51:27,383
Let me find out what you want to know!

666
00:51:29,403 --> 00:51:32,047
- If you ever raise your voice
to me again, I will kill you.

667
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,650
Do you understand?

668
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:34,483
- Yes sir.

669
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:35,983
- [Thatch] Get up!

670
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:38,388
- Fine.

671
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:41,411
- Oh, and after you interrogate them,

672
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:43,629
I want you to gather some weapons,

673
00:51:43,629 --> 00:51:46,724
and get my troops and meet
me here in half an hour.

674
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:49,118
We're going to put our plan into action.

675
00:51:49,118 --> 00:51:52,666
(suspenseful music)
- Yes sir.

676
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,916
(grunting)

677
00:52:24,013 --> 00:52:25,605
- Hello.

678
00:52:25,605 --> 00:52:26,605
I'm Dr West.

679
00:52:28,443 --> 00:52:31,843
I've been sent here to interrogate you.

680
00:52:31,843 --> 00:52:35,063
Now this can go easy, or it can go rough.

681
00:52:35,063 --> 00:52:37,614
(grunts)

682
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:39,615
(laughs)

683
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,277
Now tell me,

684
00:52:41,277 --> 00:52:44,628
what were you doing with the bimbos?

685
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,128
- Well, you idiot.

686
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,791
I'm John Apollo.

687
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,892
I work for the Armageddon Street Patrol.

688
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:52,809
And anyway,

689
00:52:54,696 --> 00:52:56,613
I was with those bimbos

690
00:52:57,457 --> 00:53:01,184
because I thought that
I might try an orgy--

691
00:53:01,184 --> 00:53:02,017
- Silence!

692
00:53:04,596 --> 00:53:07,985
Looks like we're gonna have
to do this the hard way.

693
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:11,235
Soldier get me the truth serum, please.

694
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:16,285
(coughing)

695
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:27,246
- [Man] Squirt.

696
00:53:28,928 --> 00:53:29,761
Cool.

697
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:32,627
- Hold still.

698
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:39,379
(screaming)

699
00:53:48,855 --> 00:53:50,211
(laughs)

700
00:53:50,211 --> 00:53:53,961
(dramatic music)
Feel better?

701
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,449
- I have failed.

702
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:08,795
- No you haven't.

703
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:10,795
We have failed, not you.

704
00:54:13,356 --> 00:54:15,692
- This isn't over yet!

705
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:19,068
Julia, how much time do we have left?

706
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:20,714
- Approximately 11 hours.

707
00:54:20,714 --> 00:54:23,316
- That's not enough time!

708
00:54:23,316 --> 00:54:25,550
Even if we did leave,

709
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,856
we still don't have enough time

710
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:29,773
to get the antidote for our leader.

711
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:47,519
- Dr West.

712
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:48,936
Yes, Lord Thatch.

713
00:54:50,116 --> 00:54:53,425
Yes, we have the bimbos and
they've been incarcerated.

714
00:54:53,425 --> 00:54:55,758
I'm questioning John Apollo.

715
00:54:56,976 --> 00:54:58,638
Yes.

716
00:54:58,638 --> 00:54:59,943
What would you like us to do with them

717
00:54:59,943 --> 00:55:02,693
once the questioning is finished?

718
00:55:03,657 --> 00:55:05,486
Ah the Nightmare Zone.

719
00:55:05,486 --> 00:55:07,148
Excellent.

720
00:55:07,148 --> 00:55:08,481
Okay, thank you.

721
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:15,629
Now, tell me the truth.

722
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,320
What were you doing with the bimbos?

723
00:55:21,642 --> 00:55:22,892
- A woman named

724
00:55:25,164 --> 00:55:26,864
Daria Solomon,

725
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:29,129
(dramatic music)

726
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:30,546
you call her Doc.

727
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:34,564
She used to work with you.

728
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,000
But she had the guts

729
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:40,576
to get out.

730
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:42,478
You didn't.

731
00:55:42,478 --> 00:55:43,507
- Soldier,

732
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,909
leave me with this man.

733
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,242
I'll finish him.

734
00:55:52,002 --> 00:55:53,553
- Even

735
00:55:53,553 --> 00:55:55,182
when you knew

736
00:55:55,182 --> 00:56:00,004
what that fat bastard was
doing with them chemicals.

737
00:56:00,004 --> 00:56:01,171
- Doc's alive?

738
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:04,210
I thought she was dead.

739
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,396
I thought they'd killed her.

740
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,665
If I'd known she was still alive,

741
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,665
I would have joined her.

742
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:13,583
(sighs)

743
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:15,732
Okay,

744
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,571
first we need to get you

745
00:56:19,571 --> 00:56:21,670
the antidote for the drug.

746
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,670
(suspenseful music)

747
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:52,249
Ah the bimbos!

748
00:56:54,141 --> 00:56:55,231
- [Trianna] Get away!

749
00:56:55,231 --> 00:56:57,668
- Now don't get your
panties all bunched up.

750
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,054
I'm John Apollo.

751
00:56:59,054 --> 00:57:00,340
Doc sent a radio transmission

752
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,980
that you all would be coming here.

753
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,097
So I thought I'd

754
00:57:03,097 --> 00:57:05,447
meet ya little bit halfway in.

755
00:57:05,447 --> 00:57:06,443
- Yeah?

756
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:07,398
Prove it!

757
00:57:07,398 --> 00:57:10,034
- Well what do want, sperm sample?

758
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:13,008
Look, I know some great
shortcuts in Thatch's building

759
00:57:13,008 --> 00:57:14,445
so you guys are gonna have to trust me

760
00:57:14,445 --> 00:57:15,316
or

761
00:57:15,316 --> 00:57:19,149
fight you way through
this hell hole yourself.

762
00:57:22,014 --> 00:57:24,626
- I'll give you one chance.

763
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:25,626
You mess up,

764
00:57:26,836 --> 00:57:29,413
I'll run this spear through your ass.

765
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:30,361
- Yeah,

766
00:57:30,361 --> 00:57:33,018
almost sounds like fun.

767
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:33,851
Let's go.

768
00:57:42,362 --> 00:57:45,279
- [Trianna] Alright guys, let's go.

769
00:58:32,862 --> 00:58:35,503
(footsteps)

770
00:58:35,503 --> 00:58:36,336
- Hurry.

771
00:58:36,336 --> 00:58:37,169
- Got it!

772
00:58:41,162 --> 00:58:44,412
- Come on, come on, let's go, let's go!

773
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,605
- The bimbos have escaped.

774
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:52,438
Damn!

775
00:58:53,393 --> 00:58:55,143
Thatch'll be furious!

776
00:58:57,898 --> 00:58:58,898
- Oh my god!

777
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,393
Where do we go?

778
00:59:02,393 --> 00:59:04,126
- Great, dead end.

779
00:59:04,126 --> 00:59:05,026
- No!

780
00:59:05,026 --> 00:59:07,193
(yelling)

781
00:59:08,768 --> 00:59:10,935
(yelling)

782
00:59:17,817 --> 00:59:20,067
(grunting)

783
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:41,734
(screaming)

784
01:00:30,147 --> 01:00:31,511
- Let's lock him up!

785
01:00:31,511 --> 01:00:32,837
Let's lock him up, come on!

786
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,004
(yelling)

787
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,497
Come on, let's get the rest of these guys.

788
01:00:43,497 --> 01:00:44,330
In there.

789
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,140
- Are you okay Sapphire?

790
01:01:01,865 --> 01:01:03,005
- We kicked some ass!

791
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:03,838
- Yeah!

792
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:06,272
- Good job!

793
01:01:06,272 --> 01:01:09,522
- You'll be alright, you'll be alright.

794
01:01:16,328 --> 01:01:18,657
- How'd you guys manage
to pull this one off?

795
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:19,490
- Well, I'm known as the man

796
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:22,684
of a million miracles around here.

797
01:01:22,684 --> 01:01:23,781
- Hey!

798
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:24,824
We gotta find Janna!

799
01:01:24,824 --> 01:01:26,927
Thatch took her!

800
01:01:26,927 --> 01:01:28,833
- Thatch's quarters are
on the seventh floor,

801
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,568
and heavily guarded.

802
01:01:30,568 --> 01:01:31,796
Before we go up there though,

803
01:01:31,796 --> 01:01:33,068
we need to stop at my office

804
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:34,641
and get the antidote

805
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:36,426
for the talnid bite.

806
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:37,384
- Where's your office?

807
01:01:37,384 --> 01:01:39,603
- It's right over here.

808
01:01:39,603 --> 01:01:40,436
- Go, go.

809
01:01:59,226 --> 01:02:01,059
- It's here somewhere.

810
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:18,859
Alright.

811
01:02:18,859 --> 01:02:19,692
Let's go.

812
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,936
- Tasty, just the way I like it.

813
01:02:49,936 --> 01:02:52,269
(screaming)

814
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,143
Why Janna, say hello to your friends.

815
01:02:58,015 --> 01:03:00,265
(laughing)

816
01:03:01,872 --> 01:03:06,039
- You bastard!
(energetic electronic music)

817
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:13,358
(screaming)

818
01:03:30,817 --> 01:03:32,234
Die bastard, die!

819
01:03:55,104 --> 01:03:56,601
- Where's Thatch?

820
01:03:56,601 --> 01:03:57,949
He's dead?
- They killed him.

821
01:03:57,949 --> 01:03:59,346
- [Both] Yes!

822
01:03:59,346 --> 01:04:00,416
- [Larry] You're next!

823
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:01,249
- No!

824
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:02,082
- You don't understand!

825
01:04:02,082 --> 01:04:02,915
Wait a sec!

826
01:04:02,915 --> 01:04:03,748
- We're glad!

827
01:04:03,748 --> 01:04:05,689
We're at warriors reigning with power!

828
01:04:05,689 --> 01:04:06,522
- We got families.

829
01:04:06,522 --> 01:04:07,466
- Drop your weapons!

830
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:09,546
- Here have it, have
it, give em the knife.

831
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:10,379
Come on here, take the knife.

832
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:11,981
- This isn't some kind of scam!

833
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,077
- There's no scam here, I'm
gonna tell you something.

834
01:04:14,077 --> 01:04:15,796
He and I both have families, he doesn't.

835
01:04:15,796 --> 01:04:17,035
But we have families.

836
01:04:17,035 --> 01:04:18,706
He said he would feed
our babies to the talnids

837
01:04:18,706 --> 01:04:20,932
if we didn't do what he wanted.

838
01:04:20,932 --> 01:04:21,767
- [Morbius] But now
that you've killed him,

839
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:23,767
we have no loyalty to the son of a bitch!

840
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:25,080
- We had no choice!

841
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,408
It's either that, or
lose everything we had.

842
01:04:27,408 --> 01:04:28,241
- What do we do?

843
01:04:28,241 --> 01:04:30,760
- Thatch paid him to come
up with the machines.

844
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,834
- Now that he's gone, I have no loyalty.

845
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,654
- Hey, you trust Dr West,

846
01:04:33,654 --> 01:04:35,882
he's the one who created the damn talnid!

847
01:04:35,882 --> 01:04:36,799
- Well I...

848
01:04:38,301 --> 01:04:39,134
Had help in that.

849
01:04:39,134 --> 01:04:41,793
- If you want to save your
leader, follow me now.

850
01:04:41,793 --> 01:04:43,886
If not, let her die.

851
01:04:43,886 --> 01:04:45,068
- Then why are we talking, let's go!

852
01:04:45,068 --> 01:04:45,985
- Let's go!

853
01:04:47,836 --> 01:04:48,669
- [Larry] Let's get our weapons!

854
01:04:48,669 --> 01:04:49,836
- You bastard!

855
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:50,832
- There's not much time left.

856
01:05:50,832 --> 01:05:51,665
(footsteps)

857
01:05:51,665 --> 01:05:53,209
I hope they make it.

858
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:55,455
(gasping)

859
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,802
Thank you for bringing this!

860
01:05:56,802 --> 01:06:00,252
Oh you guys have come
through, I can't believe!

861
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:01,651
We're gonna save her life!

862
01:06:01,651 --> 01:06:04,401
Oh my god you guys are wonderful!

863
01:06:05,491 --> 01:06:07,144
Thanks John!

864
01:06:07,144 --> 01:06:09,347
Thanks John for coming through for me.

865
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:11,009
- What can I say?

866
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,898
I'm the original Wonder Man.

867
01:06:12,898 --> 01:06:14,981
(laughs)

868
01:06:26,344 --> 01:06:29,344
- [Trianna] This'll make you better.

869
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:37,834
We better go.

870
01:06:39,145 --> 01:06:40,645
Let's go, come on.

871
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:00,174
- John, I'm sorry we had to hurt you man.

872
01:07:00,174 --> 01:07:02,341
(talking)

873
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:18,485
- Stop!

874
01:07:18,485 --> 01:07:19,685
- Whoa, listen.

875
01:07:19,685 --> 01:07:20,518
Who's that?

876
01:07:20,518 --> 01:07:21,351
Who's she?

877
01:07:22,354 --> 01:07:23,650
- Trianna?

878
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:26,135
- [Pringle] Who's that?

879
01:07:26,135 --> 01:07:29,337
- You've done very well on this mission.

880
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,504
You saved Rachelle's life.

881
01:07:34,123 --> 01:07:36,251
She's grown very tired

882
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:38,695
and she can't fight anymore.

883
01:07:38,695 --> 01:07:42,769
Rachelle wants me to
present you with this sword.

884
01:07:42,769 --> 01:07:45,269
She wants you to be the queen.

885
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:48,653
All those in favor of Trianna being queen,

886
01:07:48,653 --> 01:07:49,983
let it be known!

887
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:52,233
(cheering)

888
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:02,091
(talking)

889
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:03,033
- [Trianna] Do you want me to use this?

890
01:08:03,033 --> 01:08:04,905
- Nah that's alright.

891
01:08:04,905 --> 01:08:06,924
I don't need my hair cut.

892
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:10,331
- Well you guys are on our team, but!

893
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:12,581
There are some major rules.

894
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:14,656
One.

895
01:08:16,026 --> 01:08:18,276
We are not called "bimbos".

896
01:08:19,864 --> 01:08:20,944
- [Pringle] Tell him!

897
01:08:20,944 --> 01:08:22,071
- I must apologize.

898
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:22,904
- Who called em bimbos?

899
01:08:22,904 --> 01:08:24,372
Did we call em bimbos?

900
01:08:24,372 --> 01:08:25,205
We ain't called em nothing!

901
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:26,288
- Number two!

902
01:08:27,178 --> 01:08:28,523
You will not

903
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:29,404
hit women.

904
01:08:29,404 --> 01:08:30,951
- I never did, he hit women.

905
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:32,480
- That would be me again.

906
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,682
- Bonehead!

907
01:08:33,682 --> 01:08:35,532
(bickering)

908
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:36,757
- [Morbius] I can do that well.

909
01:08:36,757 --> 01:08:38,833
- [Man] Speech.

910
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:40,520
- We are one.

911
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,280
Together we have fought hard.

912
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,912
You were there for me

913
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,829
as I was there for you.

914
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,125
I will be your queen.

915
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,930
All I ask is

916
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,743
that you return for a sequel.

917
01:08:55,743 --> 01:08:56,773
(dramatic music)

918
01:08:56,773 --> 01:08:57,606
(laughing)

919
01:08:57,606 --> 01:09:00,537
- I can't believe, we finally
got John a part of something

920
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:01,499
where there's no bad assholes.

921
01:09:01,499 --> 01:09:03,835
- Sorry about that cut.

922
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:05,610
- Doc you're still an
asshole, but I love ya.

923
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:07,628
(laughing)

924
01:09:07,628 --> 01:09:11,378
