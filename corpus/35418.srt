1
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,561
I got a business to run right here.
Back.

2
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:38,528
Yo. Maurice!

3
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:40,628
Jackie! Jack!

4
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:43,427
Jackie! Jack! How you doing?

5
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:46,260
And Miss lovely Amber Waves.

6
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:49,759
I'm pissed you haven't been around.

7
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,026
We were on vacation.

8
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:54,493
Don't you ever stay away that long
from my club again.

9
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:56,725
And not for nothing, honey, but...

10
00:01:56,725 --> 00:02:00,425
You are the sexiest bitch
in the entire country!

11
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:01,924
I love you!

12
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:02,858
You're such a charmer.

13
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:06,491
I got your booth set up.
I'll send some clams over.

14
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,791
Jack. I'm ready. I'm available.

15
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:13,756
Put me in a movie, okay? We're
talking box office! Box office!

16
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:18,922
Chi-Chi. Jack and Amber's table,
take them a order of clams.

17
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:21,156
Let's go! Vamos!

18
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:23,555
How's it going here?

19
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,622
Baby, me and you...

20
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:28,588
we'll take a picture later on.
I love you, baby.

21
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,453
We were looking for you before!
Where were you?

22
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:39,420
I was here.
Seriously, man!

23
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:44,586
I love you, Beck!

24
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:47,018
Cowboy!

25
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:48,918
That's a cowboy?

26
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:51,918
You like it? It's nice, right?

27
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:56,351
If you like it.
I love it, man. I love it!

28
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:00,984
Compliments of Maurice.

29
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,450
Can I get a Margarita, please?

30
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,850
7-Up.

31
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:10,549
Hi, Rollergirl.

32
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,216
Did you call that girl today?

33
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,548
I forgot.

34
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:14,982
After tomorrow, it'll be the weekend

35
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:17,148
and you'll never
be able to see her.

36
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:21,148
What's the matter down there?

37
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,647
I got to pee.

38
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:24,614
Well, go then.

39
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:35,612
What's happening?
I got to pee!

40
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:21,173
Hey, Jack.
Little Bill.

41
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,439
Amber, how are you?

42
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,539
How's our schedule? Are we still on
for day after tomorrow?

43
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,772
The day after
the day after tomorrow.

44
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:32,739
Jack, I got to call
Rocky and Scotty, Kurt.

45
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,538
Small crew on this one,
you know what I mean?

46
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:36,537
A low-key deal?

47
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:37,704
Exactly.

48
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:40,671
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,037
Do we have a script?

50
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,766
How you doing?
Fine.

51
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,332
How old are you?

52
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:20,898
I have a work permit.

53
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:22,498
No, it's nothing like that.

54
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,132
Worked here long?

55
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:25,765
A month.

56
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:26,798
Maurice give you the job?

57
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:28,064
Yeah.

58
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:32,564
You from around here?
I mean, Canoga? Reseda?

59
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,930
No. You know where Torrance is?

60
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,264
How do you get here?

61
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:37,963
I take the bus.

62
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:40,630
What do you want to be?

63
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,929
Excuse me?

64
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:46,729
You take the bus from Torrance to
Reseda to do this job.

65
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,295
Can't you get a job in Torrance?

66
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:52,128
Yeah, but I don't want to.

67
00:05:56,227 --> 00:06:01,994
So, you want 5 or 10?

68
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,059
What?

69
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:07,626
If you just want to see me
jack-off, it's 10.

70
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:10,759
If you just want to look at it,
it's only 5.

71
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,591
Guys pay you to watch you?

72
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:15,858
You done it tonight?

73
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,491
Couple of times.

74
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:18,991
You can do it again?

75
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:22,224
If you want. If you got 10 bucks.

76
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:25,991
My name is Jack.

77
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:28,190
Eddie. Eddie Adams.

78
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,789
Eddie Adams from Torrance.

79
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,923
Jack Horner. Filmmaker.

80
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:35,755
Really?
Yeah. I make...

81
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:38,688
Adult films. Exotic pictures.

82
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:41,388
I know who you are. I read about
you in a magazine.

83
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,455
Inside Amber. Amanda's Ride. Right?

84
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,021
Right.

85
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,354
So now you know I'm not
full of doggy doo-doo.

86
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:52,154
Want t come to the table
and have a drink?

87
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:54,820
I'd love to, but I got to work.

88
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,919
You have to work, get money,
pay the rent.

89
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,719
Yeah. I mean, no.

90
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,286
I need money, but I don't pay rent.

91
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:03,119
I live at home.

92
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:06,152
How old are you, Eddie?

93
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:07,985
I'm 17.

94
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:11,551
17-year-old piece of gold.

95
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:12,917
Yeah, right.

96
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,151
Come. I got people
I'd like you to meet.

97
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,316
I do know who you are.

98
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:21,216
I'd love to come for a drink.
Obviously you're not full of...

99
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:22,816
Doggy doo-doo.

100
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:26,749
But I couldn't walk out on Maurice.
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:33,815
Under those jeans something
wonderful's waiting to get out.

102
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:58,278
Bye, Maurice.

103
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,711
Good night.

104
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,811
Listen, thank you.

105
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:03,277
Love you. Take care.

106
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:12,510
This is the man you let in anytime.
You understand?

107
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:18,909
Fix you some eggs, beauty?

108
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,108
No, I'm going to sleep. Good night.

109
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:23,975
Good night, honey-tits.

110
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:26,142
Stay beautiful.

111
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,503
Tom? Hi. Yeah, it's me.

112
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:06,136
I know that it's late, but...

113
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:09,202
Is Andy there? Is he?

114
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:16,368
I'd like to say hello to my son
and that's all.

115
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,700
Let me tell you something, Tom.

116
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,933
I know a lawyer. You understand?

117
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,667
You might think I don't, but I do
and I'll take you to court!

118
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:37,299
Tom, don't. Come on. Tom, please.
Please.

119
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:40,723
What the fuck are you doing?

120
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:44,223
What the fuck does it
look like I'm doing?

121
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,290
Close the door?

122
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,722
Will I close the door?

123
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:52,822
Will I close the door?
That's my wife, you asshole.

124
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,655
Oh, I'm sorry.

125
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,555
Get out.

126
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,888
Go sleep on the couch.

127
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:02,854
Don't stop. Big Stud.

128
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:16,036
Jesus, please! Shave if you're
going to do that.

129
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:17,503
You scratch my face.

130
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:18,969
Sorry.

131
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:26,369
Morning.

132
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,834
How's it at work?

133
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,967
You get home late?

134
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,400
You work in a nightclub.

135
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,534
If it means so much to you, you
should find one that's closer.

136
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,900
I've got to get to work.

137
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,266
At a car wash.

138
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,865
What?
You work at a car wash.

139
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:52,532
You work at a nightclub.
School never occurred to you?

140
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:04,397
Bye, Dad.

141
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:05,830
Goodbye.

142
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:11,596
Basically you're getting twice
the bass...

143
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:13,096
with the TK241, which we've...

144
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,762
got available in this system.

145
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:19,661
I don't know. I don't really know
if I need all that bass.

146
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:22,195
I think you need all that bass.

147
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,795
If you want a system to handle
what you want...

148
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:27,061
you need the bass.

149
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:31,794
This is hi-fi.

150
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:33,960
High fidelity.

151
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,793
That means this is the
highest quality fidelity.

152
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,259
Hi-fi. Two important things
to have in a stereo system.

153
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,292
It's the price.

154
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,059
I have this unit in my home.

155
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,058
Really?
Yes, I do.

156
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:50,458
But, of course, I got it modified
with the TK421.

157
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,058
Which kicks it up another...

158
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,424
3 or 4...

159
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:58,324
quads per channel, you know?

160
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:02,389
But that's technical talk.
That doesn't concern you.

161
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:05,523
You're still a little uncertain.

162
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:09,722
You know what you need?
A test drive.

163
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:11,322
You need a test drive.

164
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,422
It's one thing to hear it
from Buck's mouth.

165
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:16,088
It's another thing to hear it
from the TK421.

166
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,254
Let me pop in this 8-track.

167
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:20,421
Listen, and tell me what you think.

168
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,119
Hear that?

169
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:28,320
You hear the bass. Right?

170
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,886
You hear it? It kicks!

171
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,752
It turns! It curls up your belly.

172
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:35,952
It makes you wanna
freaky-deaky, right?

173
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,152
Now if you get the system as is...

174
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:42,218
it won't sound like this without
the TK421 modification.

175
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:45,550
And we do that in the store right
here. Very small price.

176
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,584
Move with it if you need to.
It helps me.

177
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,683
Thank you for your time.

178
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:55,050
Well, so long, partner.

179
00:15:56,516 --> 00:15:57,848
What the fuck was that?

180
00:15:57,848 --> 00:16:02,682
Have I told you? Have I?
What?

181
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:05,881
You put on a country-western shit,
no one'll buy a stereo.

182
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,647
What kind of brother listens
to that shit?

183
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:10,280
Look, Jerry...

184
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,547
No, no, no. You look.

185
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:13,380
I gave you a job because...

186
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,546
I thought your acting stuff
might bring nice pussy in.

187
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:19,912
And it has. But I can't have
anymore fuck-ups.

188
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,479
You dig?

189
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,879
You dig?

190
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,046
Yeah, I dig.

191
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:28,644
Now get in the back and
unload those new 484's.

192
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:31,278
All right. Sorry.

193
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,277
Settle down, class.

194
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,810
This is your final.

195
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,810
Keep your test papers facedown
until I tell you to turn them up.

196
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,210
Clear your tables, please.

197
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:48,043
There should be nothing on your desk
but the test and a pencil.

198
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:52,342
We're covering
chapters 17 through 28.

199
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:56,908
Your eyes should stay on
your test papers, please.

200
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:58,841
Are we ready?

201
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:01,440
Class, begin.

202
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:32,436
I love to suck cock.
I love to suck cock.

203
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:45,435
Honey? You okay?

204
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:46,968
Sweetheart?

205
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,701
Is something wrong?

206
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,700
I got to get back.

207
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,201
I need it again.

208
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,667
I have to go to work.

209
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,333
Come on, give it to me.

210
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,666
Don't make me pounce you.

211
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,899
I'll do it.

212
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:02,699
You promise?

213
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:03,966
That's it.

214
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:04,833
You want it?

215
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,466
How bad?

216
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:07,432
Bad.

217
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:09,132
You sure?

218
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:11,498
You asked for it!

219
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:16,630
God. wait.

220
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,163
Stop!

221
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:22,930
What?

222
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,096
Your cock is so beautiful.

223
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:35,095
Do you know how good you are
doing it, Eddie?

224
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:40,661
Having sex? Fucking me?
Making love to me?

225
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:43,594
Everyone has one thing.

226
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:46,227
Everyone's given one
special thing, right?

227
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,360
That's right.

228
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,493
Everyone's blessed with
one special thing.

229
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:01,591
I want you to know
I plan on being a star.

230
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:04,491
A big bring shining star.

231
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:08,623
That's what I want.
That's what I'm going to get.

232
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:10,191
I know.

233
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,156
I got to go.

234
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,856
You're lucky.

235
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:39,678
You want a ride?

236
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:40,612
You want a ride?

237
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:42,612
I'm going really far.

238
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:45,211
Do you remember me from
a couple hours ago?

239
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,111
Yeah, I remember.

240
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:50,111
Come with us, sweetie.

241
00:20:58,476 --> 00:21:00,142
This is a really cool car.

242
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:08,008
What I'm trying to tell you...

243
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:11,141
is that it takes a lot...

244
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:13,841
of the good American old green stuff

245
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,307
to make one of
these things, you know?

246
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:21,074
You've got your camera,
you've got your film...

247
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,073
You got your lights, your sound,
your lab costs...

248
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,739
you got devloping, your synching,
your editing.

249
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:29,205
Before you turn around...

250
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:34,371
you've spent maybe 20, 25, 30
thousand dollars on a movie.

251
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,005
That's a lot.

252
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,738
You bet your ass it is.

253
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:39,538
But if you make a good one...

254
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,937
there's practically no end to
how much money you can make.

255
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:45,670
Have you seen Jack's house?

256
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,070
He will.

257
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,036
He'll see it.

258
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,236
You got maybe 15, 20 guys standing
around just...

259
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:56,369
making sure that your
lighting is right.

260
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:01,602
But you can work out in the morning,
you can work out at noon, at night.

261
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:03,101
It doesn't matter.

262
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:06,234
If you don't have those juices
flowing in the Mr. Torpedo area...

263
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:10,000
in the Fun Zone.

264
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,167
But you must get people
in the theater.

265
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:15,533
You need the big dicks,
the big tits...

266
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,533
Here we go.

267
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:21,265
How do you keep them in the theater
after they've come?

268
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:23,499
With beauty...

269
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:26,765
and with acting.

270
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:31,631
I understand you've got to
get them in the theater...

271
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:33,464
keep the seats full.

272
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:35,663
But I don't want to make a film...

273
00:22:35,663 --> 00:22:38,063
where they sit down, jack-off...

274
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:41,063
and they get up and get out
before the story ends.

275
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:44,696
It is my dream, it is my goal...

276
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,662
it is my idea to make a film...

277
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:50,728
that the story just sucks them in...

278
00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:54,194
and when they spurt out
that joy-juice,

279
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:56,495
they just got to sit in it.

280
00:22:56,495 --> 00:22:58,594
They can't move...

281
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:02,026
until they find out how
the story ends.

282
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:07,693
I want to make a film like that.

283
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:11,625
I understand they have to make
films, I've made them myself...

284
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,658
that are a few laughs...

285
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:17,758
everybody fucks their brains out.
And that's fine.

286
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:19,924
But it's my dream...

287
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:21,691
to make a film...

288
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:25,090
that is true...

289
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:27,556
and right...

290
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,890
and dramatic.

291
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,889
You want a Fresca?

292
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:33,756
No thanks.

293
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:36,922
Are you sure?
You're out of limes, Jack.

294
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:39,589
Check in the kitchen, darling.

295
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,388
I'm going to bed.

296
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:46,987
Good night, Jackie.
Don't stay up too late.

297
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:48,521
Good night, beauty.

298
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,254
Good night, Eddie.

299
00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:52,987
Glad you came by.

300
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,653
You're great.

301
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:58,153
Thank you.

302
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:04,718
She's the best.

303
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:08,284
She's a wonderful mother.

304
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:11,984
She's a mother to all
those who need love.

305
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,251
She's really nice.

306
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,250
You know what I'm thinking?

307
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,983
I want to be in business with you.

308
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:22,516
Really?

309
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:23,750
What do you think?

310
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,349
I'd love it.

311
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,548
What do you think of Rollergirl?

312
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:30,049
She's great.

313
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,048
Would you like to do it?

314
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:34,382
Have sex?

315
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:35,681
Yeah.

316
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:37,981
Yeah, I'd love to.

317
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:39,247
She's really foxy.

318
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:41,514
You bet your ass it is.

319
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,414
You're officially out of limes.

320
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:45,980
I'll pick up some
for you tomorrow.

321
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,480
Come here, darling.

322
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,612
I want you to get over there and
sit on the couch with Eddie.

323
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:53,746
Here we go. Are we going to fuck?

324
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:55,145
Oh, yes.

325
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,379
Wait a minute.

326
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,910
Are you ready?
Yeah, are you?

327
00:25:18,776 --> 00:25:20,476
You taking your skates off?.

328
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:22,408
I don't take my skates off.

329
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,941
And don't fucking come in me.

330
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,674
Aim it at her tits, Eddie.

331
00:25:53,105 --> 00:25:54,204
Hi.

332
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,371
Where were you?

333
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:56,837
Nowhere.

334
00:25:56,837 --> 00:25:58,770
Where were you?

335
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,803
You see that little slut-girl?
Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

336
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:04,503
Don't say that.

337
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:07,869
Make you feel like a stud
to see trash like that?

338
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:10,935
Is she your girlfriend?

339
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:11,902
No, she's not...

340
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:15,235
She's a whore and a piece of trash.

341
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:17,601
I know you're not
the only one she sees.

342
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,535
Why would you say that?

343
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:21,734
I heard things about that girl.

344
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:24,333
I know what goes on
when I'm not here!

345
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,700
I wash your sheets.

346
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,499
Or you doing something else in there
with your music and your posters?

347
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:32,566
What is your problem?

348
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:35,499
Go to that little whore. Sheryl
Lynn. Go to your little girlfriend.

349
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:39,532
Maybe I will!

350
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:40,565
What will you do?

351
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,864
Something!

352
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:43,898
You can't do anything!

353
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:46,697
You're a loser!
You'll always be a loser!

354
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:50,364
You were too stupid to finish
high school! What'll you do?

355
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:54,830
I'll go somewhere! Maybe I'll run
away where you can never find me!

356
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,129
Fine! Fuck that girl!

357
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:00,829
What are you doing?

358
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,163
I'm getting my stuff.

359
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:06,295
That's not your stuff!.
You didn't pay for it!

360
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:09,095
That is not your stuff!.
You didn't pay for it, stupid!

361
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,494
None of this is yours!

362
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:16,794
You leave here, you leave
with what you've got!

363
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:19,527
Nothing! Nothing!

364
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:21,726
You understand me?

365
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:25,259
You want to treat me like this?
Is that fair?

366
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:26,893
I didn't do anything!

367
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:27,992
Fuck that little whore!

368
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:31,425
You think you're going to be this...

369
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,258
goddamn poster?! You won't be this!

370
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:36,558
Don't do that!

371
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:37,824
Why are you doing that?

372
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:38,791
You won't be shit!
You're too stupid!

373
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:39,791
I'm not!

374
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:44,323
Please, don't fucking do that!
Don't be mean to me!

375
00:27:44,323 --> 00:27:45,390
I am not being mean to you!

376
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,489
You're too stupid to see it!

377
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:48,823
You don't know what I can do
or what I'm going to be!

378
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:54,289
I have good things that
you don't know about!

379
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:59,255
I'm going to be something!
Don't tell me I'm not!

380
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:02,055
Don't be mean! And you don't talk
to me! No!

381
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:04,421
Fuck! Shit.

382
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,186
Eddie Adams from Torrance.

383
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:19,052
I knew you'd make it.

384
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:22,618
You take the bus here?
It wasn't bad.

385
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,951
How are you?
Great.

386
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:26,284
I got people I want you to meet.

387
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:34,817
Do you like music?
I love music.

388
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:35,717
What kind?

389
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:38,250
All kinds. Rock, jazz, classical.

390
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,783
I want you to meet
some great people.

391
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:42,716
Buck and Becky.

392
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:45,349
Hi, I'm Eddie Adams.
Buck Swope. Nice to meet you.

393
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,015
Our new fella.

394
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:48,015
Becky Barnett.

395
00:28:48,015 --> 00:28:49,114
Nice to meet you.

396
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:50,181
This is the new fella?

397
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:55,314
Is that a faccia?
That is a faccia.

398
00:28:55,314 --> 00:28:57,447
Faccia's "face"?
That's right.

399
00:28:58,747 --> 00:29:00,780
Nice to meet you. Take care.

400
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:03,213
Great people.

401
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:08,012
He's one hell of an actor.

402
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:13,478
I want you to meet the
new boy on the street.

403
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:16,145
Hi, Eddie. Reed Rothchild.

404
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:17,944
Stick around for a while, okay?

405
00:29:17,944 --> 00:29:19,311
Sure.

406
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:20,411
Make him something special.

407
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:23,610
You live on the street?

408
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,610
I thought Jack just said you did.

409
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:30,676
Want a drink?

410
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:32,709
Margarita?

411
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:39,342
Two...

412
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,675
four, whatever.

413
00:29:44,774 --> 00:29:46,441
Can I ask you something?

414
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:47,941
Do you work out?

415
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:50,240
You look like it.

416
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
What do you squat.

417
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,806
About two.

418
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:54,307
Super, super.

419
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:56,406
What about you?

420
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:58,939
What do you squat?

421
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:01,705
350.

422
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:04,204
No BS.

423
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,039
That's a lot.

424
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,204
Where do you work out?

425
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,737
In Torrance, where I live.

426
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:09,338
Cool. Cool.

427
00:30:09,338 --> 00:30:11,104
You ever go to Vince's out here?

428
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:13,737
Oh, no. I would've seen you.

429
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:14,737
I'm there everyday.

430
00:30:14,737 --> 00:30:16,870
Always wanted to work out
at Vince's.

431
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,970
Cool. Here.
Taste that.

432
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:26,202
Rock and roll!

433
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:30,901
Did you see Star Wars?

434
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:32,935
About 4 times.

435
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:35,501
People tell me I look like
Han Solo.

436
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,000
Really?

437
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,567
What do you bench?

438
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,533
You tell first.

439
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,166
I asked you first.

440
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,200
Same time.

441
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,732
Cool.

442
00:30:48,732 --> 00:30:50,666
Are you ready?

443
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:54,532
One...two...three.

444
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:55,631
You didn't say anything.

445
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:57,199
Neither did you.

446
00:30:57,199 --> 00:31:00,264
Hey guys, look at me.

447
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:17,229
Thank you, Johnny.

448
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:19,295
My dear, it's party time.

449
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:22,061
You do look lovely.

450
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:24,295
Hello, Colonel. How are you?

451
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:26,128
Oh hello, Jack.

452
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,828
This is my lady friend.

453
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:30,594
Darling, meet Jack Horner.

454
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:32,494
The finest director in the business.

455
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:35,626
Do you nave any coke at this party?

456
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:38,293
I'm sure they can
find some somewhere.

457
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:39,493
Great.

458
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:40,859
You're no bigger than a minute.

459
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,692
And shy as a butterfly.
I'll bet.

460
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:48,524
He has a right to tell me how to
sell stereos. It's his store.

461
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:52,257
But he doesn't have the right
to tell me how to dress.

462
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:53,924
Baby, it's just plain old.

463
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:55,191
Let me tell you something.

464
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:57,924
First, he was pissed
about the music.

465
00:31:57,924 --> 00:31:59,390
What's wrong with it?

466
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,323
And the cowboy look
ended 6 years ago.

467
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:04,689
It's coming back.
No, it's not. It's over. It's dead.

468
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,856
You don't know.

469
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:09,055
I do. And it sounds like
your bosses at the store

470
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:11,788
are saying the same thing.

471
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:13,189
What? What?

472
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:14,987
You have to get a new look!

473
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:17,288
What? You get a new look!

474
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:19,520
The look I have is just fine.

475
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,387
What is your look?

476
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:22,554
Chocolate love, all right?

477
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:24,287
Take a pill.
100o/0.

478
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:27,053
I'm just trying to be your friend.

479
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:28,187
Drop it.

480
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:32,718
I tried opening up a club here.

481
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:33,919
But I'm just this poor brother
from Puerto Rico.

482
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,185
I got this club, that's one thing.

483
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:40,751
But soon that goes, I die and what
do I have? I got nothing.

484
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,417
I want something I can send home.

485
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:46,484
Something I can send to my
brother and say:

486
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:48,417
"Look at me.

487
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:52,183
Look at me and all the beautiful
women I've been with."

488
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:54,616
So, what? You want me
to talk to Jack?

489
00:32:54,616 --> 00:32:58,649
Yeah. I mean, what am I
asking you here?

490
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:00,849
Honey, baby, please, talk to Jack.

491
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,382
Tell him I can do this.
I won't be bad.

492
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,215
You want to be in a movie?

493
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:06,414
Baby, please.

494
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:09,914
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.

495
00:33:09,914 --> 00:33:12,147
Thank you, mamita.

496
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,680
Maurice, can I talk to you?

497
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,379
I need to talk you now.

498
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:21,579
Excuse me.

499
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,379
Can I join in?

500
00:33:24,512 --> 00:33:26,179
Certainly.

501
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:28,079
Your cowboy...That's not dead.

502
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,812
Then what the fuck is
Becky talking about?

503
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:31,545
She's got a fucking something up
her ass. Fuck that shit.

504
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:32,645
Bitch.

505
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:53,375
Do a cannonball!

506
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:55,542
No, no. Watch this jackknife!

507
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,240
Did I look cool?

508
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,807
Pretty good.

509
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:06,640
I'll show you what you did wrong.

510
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:21,972
Full flip.

511
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:41,169
You all right?

512
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:44,002
You have to bring your legs
all the way around.

513
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:46,768
I know. I know.

514
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:50,101
This is my point.

515
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:51,968
You know what I'm saying?

516
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:54,267
Wear what you dig.

517
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,200
Just wear what you dig.

518
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,933
That's what I say.

519
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:00,299
What's the problem?

520
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,966
Should I get that?

521
00:35:04,966 --> 00:35:06,565
Hello.

522
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:10,332
Can you speak a little
louder, please?

523
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:11,599
A who?

524
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,531
A Maggie?

525
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:15,397
Do you know a Maggie?
I don't.

526
00:35:15,397 --> 00:35:17,863
There's no Maggie here.

527
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:20,530
Your mother?

528
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,797
Just give me a second.

529
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,697
Watch that for me, okay?

530
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,896
Excuse me, is there a Maggie here?

531
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:36,761
Are you Maggie? You're not?
Are you Maggie?

532
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:40,194
Do you know Maggie?

533
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,361
Oh, man, can you believe that?

534
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:48,060
Hello? I'm sorry,
there's no Maggie here.

535
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,593
No, no, it's not a problem.
Okay, ciao.

536
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:53,793
Who was it?

537
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:56,092
Some kid looking for his mom.

538
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,686
What are you doing?

539
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:47,452
What's it look like?

540
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:49,018
That's my wife.

541
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:53,052
Shut up, Bill.
You're embarrassing me.

542
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:55,284
Yeah, Little Bill, shut up.

543
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:10,583
Kurt, how's it going?

544
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,583
What's wrong with you?

545
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,648
My fucking wife, man.

546
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,782
She's down there, some idiot's dick
in her. Everybody's watching.

547
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:19,181
It's an embarrassment!

548
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:22,281
I know. Anyway, listen.

549
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,115
For the shoot, I want to see about
getting this new zoom lens.

550
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:29,314
I was wondering if we'd be able
to get more lights too.

551
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,147
Jack wants a minimal thing.

552
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:34,979
Very often, minimal means
a lot more photographically

553
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:36,645
than people understand.

554
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:37,545
I understand.

555
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:39,345
I know you understand.

556
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:40,479
I mean other people.

557
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:43,678
I think what Jack is talking about
is minimal.

558
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,444
Not natural, but minimal.

559
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:46,911
Okay, fine.

560
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:48,411
I understand.

561
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:51,177
I want to give each film
its own look.

562
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:54,177
Can we talk about this later?

563
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:56,643
You got to go somewhere or...

564
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:59,642
Yeah. No, I mean...

565
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:01,943
I was hoping, for the shoot
tomorrow,

566
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:03,943
we could send Rocky down
to pick it up.

567
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:08,575
No, got you. You got to go
somewhere. So what the fuck?

568
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:10,975
It's only the photography
of the film.

569
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:12,807
Are you giving me shit?

570
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:14,907
No. No way, Little Bill.

571
00:38:14,907 --> 00:38:18,374
My fucking wife has an ass in her
cock in the driveway! All right?

572
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:23,240
I'm sorry if my thoughts are not on
the photography of the film!

573
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,973
Okay. No big deal. Sorry.

574
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:28,006
Got you.

575
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:43,571
All right, where is it?

576
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:53,469
She's sick.

577
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:55,535
What the fuck is this?

578
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:57,268
I didn't do anything?

579
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,369
Is she breathing?

580
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,668
I don't know.

581
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,168
Maybe she did too much coke.

582
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:02,568
Do you think so, doctor?

583
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,635
The girl's definitely OD'ed.

584
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:07,267
Fuck me. I want you to handle this
for me, Johnny.

585
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:08,434
You listening?

586
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:10,266
Drive her to Saint Joe's.

587
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,200
Drop her off in the front.
Understand me?

588
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,467
Got you.

589
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:16,532
Make sure no one sees the limo.

590
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:18,532
What is this?

591
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:22,032
This is twice in 2 days that
a chick has OD'ed on me!

592
00:39:22,032 --> 00:39:25,199
Think it means you should think
about getting new shit?

593
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,231
Yes sir.

594
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:29,365
Shit, she's freaking out!

595
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:31,931
Look! With all this conversation!
Come on!

596
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:34,197
Please don't die!

597
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:41,063
Back door, Johnny.

598
00:39:41,063 --> 00:39:42,496
You got it.

599
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:45,463
Fucking shit!

600
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,362
Get out of my way.

601
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:55,761
Bart is she all right?
Shut the fuck up!

602
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:28,190
Scotty J., how are you?

603
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,457
You know, you know.

604
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:31,856
Who's this?

605
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:35,089
Eddie, this is Scotty J.
He works on some of the films.

606
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:36,922
Nice to meet you.
Me too.

607
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:38,922
Are you going to be working or...

608
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:41,355
Maybe.
Probably.

609
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:45,188
That's great. How'd you meet Jack?

610
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:48,721
Because I work on the films.
Sometimes. So, if you ever...

611
00:40:51,587 --> 00:40:54,553
Come here!
That's the boy.

612
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,553
Could you excuse me for a minute?

613
00:40:56,553 --> 00:41:00,520
Very nice to meet you.
Take care.

614
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,685
Eddie Adams, this is the Colonel.

615
00:41:06,685 --> 00:41:08,651
How do you do?

616
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:11,185
Eddie is interested in film.

617
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:15,084
I can't give you much advice that
Jack doesn't know...

618
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:17,783
but I can advise you to
think about your name.

619
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:18,917
My name?

620
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:21,783
Think about some name that
makes you happy, or...

621
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:24,549
something with a little pizazz.

622
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:30,349
The Colonel here, he puts up all
the money for our films.

623
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:32,382
It's an important part
of the process.

624
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:33,982
Great, great.

625
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:35,015
I look forward to seeing you
in action.

626
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:37,348
Jack says you have a big cock.

627
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:40,314
Well, I don't know. I guess so.

628
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:41,847
May I see it?

629
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:44,013
Really?
Please.

630
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:52,212
Thank you, Eddie.

631
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:53,979
No problem.

632
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:56,012
Thanks, Eddie.

633
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:24,442
You want to hear a poem I wrote?

634
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:29,107
"I love you

635
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:30,874
You love me

636
00:42:30,874 --> 00:42:33,774
Going down the sugar tree.

637
00:42:33,774 --> 00:42:36,440
We'll go down the sugar tree

638
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,839
And see lots of bees

639
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,407
Playing

640
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:42,273
Playing

641
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,172
But the bees won't sting

642
00:42:44,172 --> 00:42:46,039
Because you love me."

643
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:49,239
That's it.
Great. You write that?

644
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:51,371
Yeah. I write songs too.

645
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:56,004
How's it going, boys?

646
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:57,470
Good time?

647
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,203
Excellent. It was a great party.
The best.

648
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,103
That's what Jackie's house is for.

649
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:07,669
To have a good time. Right?
That's right!

650
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:15,235
How about bubbles, Reed?

651
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:20,235
Excuse me, Jack?

652
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:24,334
I was thinking about what the
Colonel said about my name.

653
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:26,200
Do you have any ideas?

654
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,933
I had some thoughts. What about
you? What do you think?

655
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:33,466
My idea was, you know,
I just want a name...

656
00:43:33,466 --> 00:43:36,399
I want it so it can cut glass.
Razor sharp.

657
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:37,565
Razor sharp, right.

658
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:40,432
When I close my eyes, I see this
thing, like this big sign.

659
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:47,097
And the name is in bright blue neon
lights with purple outline.

660
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:54,630
It just blows up because the name
is just so powerful.

661
00:44:03,496 --> 00:44:05,595
It says "Dirk Diggler."

662
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:11,094
I think heaven has sent you here,

663
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:12,460
Dirk Diggler.

664
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,794
I think the angels have blessed
us all because of you.

665
00:44:16,794 --> 00:44:18,027
You're Dirk!

666
00:44:18,027 --> 00:44:19,427
Dirk Diggler!

667
00:44:20,493 --> 00:44:22,426
Amen!

668
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:30,358
Talk to me, Kurt.

669
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:31,258
20 to 30.

670
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:32,091
Why?

671
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:34,191
I got tough shadows to deal with.

672
00:44:34,191 --> 00:44:35,991
There's shadows in life, babe.

673
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,224
You want to go over this?

674
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,590
The set-up is...

675
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,924
Here we go.

676
00:44:45,924 --> 00:44:51,223
One: Amber and Becky telephone the
agents to send over some actors.

677
00:44:51,223 --> 00:44:54,622
Two: enter Reed to audition
for Amber.

678
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:56,755
They go at it. Becky watches.

679
00:44:56,755 --> 00:44:59,821
Three: Becky goes to the
bathroom to jack-off.

680
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:02,688
She gets interrupted by Amber,
they go at it.

681
00:45:02,688 --> 00:45:03,954
Four...

682
00:45:05,754 --> 00:45:08,153
Who's Dirk Diggler?

683
00:45:08,153 --> 00:45:11,953
That's that new good-looking kid,
Eddie, at the club.

684
00:45:11,953 --> 00:45:13,153
Good name.

685
00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:16,252
Anyway, enter Dirk. He meets Becky,
they go at it.

686
00:45:16,252 --> 00:45:20,752
No. Change that, will you? I want
Eddie to be auditioning for Amber.

687
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:22,219
Got it.

688
00:45:23,218 --> 00:45:24,218
Darling?

689
00:45:24,218 --> 00:45:25,084
Where you going?

690
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:26,151
To wash my vagina.

691
00:45:26,151 --> 00:45:27,285
How long will you be?

692
00:45:27,285 --> 00:45:28,551
2 seconds.

693
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:30,617
You want it clean, don't you?

694
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:36,917
I'm back now.
I'm ready to start my...

695
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:54,915
I'm supposed to come get you now and
tell you they're all ready now.

696
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,513
Do you think you could
give me a minute?

697
00:46:02,946 --> 00:46:04,346
Thanks.

698
00:46:06,813 --> 00:46:08,445
I'm back now.

699
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:11,878
I'm ready to start my
acting career.

700
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,644
That's right.

701
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:33,276
You look really good.

702
00:46:33,276 --> 00:46:36,575
And you look really sexy.

703
00:46:41,774 --> 00:46:43,208
I like your name a lot.

704
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:45,641
You do?
It's really cool.

705
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,673
You'll be right down there.

706
00:47:04,372 --> 00:47:07,138
How's my boy?
Great!

707
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:08,538
Let's do it.

708
00:47:10,337 --> 00:47:11,904
Remember what we talked about?

709
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:15,904
You're going to come through the
door, walk right over here.

710
00:47:15,904 --> 00:47:18,670
I'll say:

711
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,736
"Action, Eddie." That'll be
your cue, right?

712
00:47:21,736 --> 00:47:26,335
You enter, you walk right over here
to the desk to Amber and...

713
00:47:26,335 --> 00:47:27,602
we shoot.

714
00:47:27,602 --> 00:47:30,835
Do we go right into the sex or...

715
00:47:30,835 --> 00:47:32,468
Is that all right?

716
00:47:32,468 --> 00:47:34,435
Is that okay with you?

717
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:38,667
Good.

718
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,133
You don't need a rehearsal?

719
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:43,833
It's okay. I can do it.

720
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,700
We'll shoot the rehearsal.

721
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,633
Could I ask you something?

722
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,632
I was wondering if you could
call me Dirk Diggler from now on?

723
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:56,632
Absolutely. I'm sorry.

724
00:47:56,632 --> 00:47:57,831
No, it's all right.

725
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:59,731
From now on.

726
00:47:59,731 --> 00:48:01,798
Let's get a good one.

727
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,698
Want to practice your lines?

728
00:48:03,698 --> 00:48:05,564
No, I know it.

729
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:07,463
You look great, honey.

730
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:10,097
Does he want me to keep going
until I come?

731
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:12,263
Yeah, come when you're ready.

732
00:48:12,263 --> 00:48:13,463
Where?

733
00:48:13,463 --> 00:48:14,862
Where do you want?

734
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:17,262
Wherever you tell me.

735
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,395
Come on my tits if you
can, okay?

736
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:22,761
Pull it out and do it on my stomach
and my tits, if you can.

737
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:25,261
No problem.

738
00:48:29,294 --> 00:48:30,827
Are you all right, honey?

739
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,760
This is great. I'm fine.
I just want to do good.

740
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:41,459
I want it to be really good.
I was wondering,

741
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:43,092
Great.

742
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:48,158
You all right?

743
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,891
Enter through this door. "Action,"
that's your cue.

744
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:52,857
You got the lines for the scene?

745
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:57,757
If you drop one, call for it.
But do not stop. Okay?

746
00:48:57,757 --> 00:48:59,390
Want some water or something?
I'm fine.

747
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:01,190
You'll do fine.

748
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,489
Roll it, Scotty.

749
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:06,089
Speed.

750
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:08,822
Sticks.

751
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:10,622
Marker.

752
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:12,722
Camera's set. We're ready, Chief.

753
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:15,521
And...

754
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,187
action, Dirk.

755
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:26,453
Hello. Are you John?

756
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,720
Yes, ma'am.

757
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,286
Your agency recommends you
very highly.

758
00:49:31,286 --> 00:49:35,252
I'm a hard worker. If you give me
a job, I won't disappoint you.

759
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:37,419
What special skills do you have?

760
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:39,885
I've been in the Marines
for three years.

761
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:42,184
I just got back
from a tour of duty.

762
00:49:42,184 --> 00:49:43,284
You're kidding.

763
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:44,884
I'm not. And it got really hard

764
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:48,117
being surrounded by all those guys
all day.

765
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:50,183
How long since you had a woman?

766
00:49:50,183 --> 00:49:51,584
A long time.

767
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:53,450
That's terrible.

768
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,716
But now I'm back, and I'm ready
to pursue my acting career.

769
00:49:57,716 --> 00:50:01,316
As you may or may not know, this is
an important film for me.

770
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:04,215
If it's not a hit, I'll get kicked
out of my apartment.

771
00:50:04,215 --> 00:50:06,048
My landlord's a jerk.

772
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:07,448
Really?

773
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:11,414
Take your pants off. It's important
I get an idea of your size.

774
00:50:11,414 --> 00:50:13,147
No problem.

775
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:50,442
I think that you have the job, but
why don't I make sure of something?

776
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:55,341
This is a giant cock.

777
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,428
Little Bill, we've rolled out.

778
00:52:37,428 --> 00:52:39,462
We got to change mags.

779
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:42,228
Do it quickly.

780
00:52:50,194 --> 00:52:51,159
Is everything cool?

781
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:53,892
We just got to change the angle.

782
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:55,992
Does it look sexy?

783
00:52:55,992 --> 00:52:57,559
It's great.

784
00:52:57,559 --> 00:52:59,292
You're doing so good.

785
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,158
Does it feel good?

786
00:53:09,757 --> 00:53:11,291
Roll sound, Scotty.

787
00:53:15,023 --> 00:53:16,156
Speed.

788
00:53:17,323 --> 00:53:19,123
Quiet. Sticks.

789
00:53:23,723 --> 00:53:26,621
We're back.

790
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:29,688
Action, kids.

791
00:53:30,588 --> 00:53:33,021
Okay, we're going to go down now.

792
00:53:33,021 --> 00:53:34,288
Down again.

793
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:47,785
John, you're a wonderful actor.

794
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:01,551
You're a wonderful actor!

795
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:17,748
You're amazing.

796
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:19,048
You feel so good.

797
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:20,182
Are you ready to come?

798
00:54:20,915 --> 00:54:22,214
Come in me.

799
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:27,047
Don't worry. I'm fixed.
I want you to come in me.

800
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:31,146
Oh, God!

801
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:46,578
Wonderful.

802
00:54:47,678 --> 00:54:49,544
Cut! Terrific!

803
00:54:49,544 --> 00:54:51,377
Nice work!

804
00:54:54,277 --> 00:54:55,010
Was it sexy?

805
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,477
Rock and roll!

806
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:57,810
Really good!

807
00:54:58,743 --> 00:55:00,710
Doesn't he fuck like a champ?

808
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,176
He rocks.

809
00:55:02,176 --> 00:55:03,709
The camera loves you.

810
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:05,176
I didn't get the come shot.

811
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,275
We missed the come shot.

812
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:08,975
He came inside her.

813
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:12,041
Maybe we could go to stock footage.

814
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:13,407
Are you crazy?

815
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,875
It won't match.

816
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:20,440
I could do it again
if you need a close-up.

817
00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:27,440
Here we go.

818
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:31,506
Everyone say, "Dirk!"

819
00:55:34,272 --> 00:55:36,404
There are real wood.

820
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:38,605
These are great.

821
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:40,571
Those are cool Are they lizard?

822
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:44,470
No, they're Italian. I'm going to
fucking buy these.

823
00:55:46,203 --> 00:55:47,437
Guys?

824
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,436
It's funny you say that because
we should be in a band.

825
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:01,602
You like my shoes?

826
00:56:01,602 --> 00:56:02,468
Pretty cool.

827
00:56:02,468 --> 00:56:05,734
I got them with Reed and Scotty.
They're cool.

828
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:12,033
They're embossed leather with this
patchwork reptilian-pattern design.

829
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,167
Can we have some hot sauce?

830
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:18,166
Want to sit down and help yourself?.

831
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:24,098
Say hello to Jaime Lynn. Scotty.

832
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:25,265
So, you're a Leo?

833
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,065
My girlfriend wants to meet you.

834
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:30,132
This is Raymond.

835
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:31,731
What's your name?

836
00:56:31,731 --> 00:56:33,763
Excuse me?

837
00:56:33,763 --> 00:56:35,697
Becky Barnett!

838
00:56:35,697 --> 00:56:37,264
Raymond's a Leo.

839
00:56:37,264 --> 00:56:38,797
I knew it.

840
00:56:38,797 --> 00:56:40,497
What's your sign?
I'm a Pisces.

841
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,763
What? I can't deal with no Pisces.

842
00:56:42,763 --> 00:56:44,296
That shirt's pretty sexy.

843
00:56:44,296 --> 00:56:47,796
This is, like, imported
Italian nylon.

844
00:56:47,796 --> 00:56:51,162
And it's, like, a special edition
limited silk print.

845
00:56:51,162 --> 00:56:53,962
And it was done by this
really famous...

846
00:56:53,962 --> 00:56:55,061
design artist from Italy.

847
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:56,894
Pick a card.

848
00:56:56,894 --> 00:57:05,393
What's up, baby? I love you!

849
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:07,359
I'm going to cut the deck
one time, all right?

850
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,593
Now I'm going to make your card
rise from the deck.

851
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,759
Damn!

852
00:57:12,759 --> 00:57:14,226
2 of diamonds, right?

853
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:15,425
That's my card!

854
00:57:15,425 --> 00:57:17,658
But doesn't it make you nervous

855
00:57:17,658 --> 00:57:20,458
when you're dealing
with those evil forces?

856
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:22,291
Horses? What?

857
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:24,691
No, the evil forces!

858
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,491
Evil? No, man, it's not evil.
It's an illusion.

859
00:57:28,491 --> 00:57:31,090
Yeah, it's confusing.

860
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,857
Thank you.

861
00:57:35,123 --> 00:57:37,189
We're going to try and do this
all in one shit!

862
00:57:37,189 --> 00:57:41,489
So, we start like this, and then
you roll her over, Dirk.

863
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:45,188
Roll with him, but try to give me
every single position.

864
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:46,188
Is that possible?

865
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:50,854
Rollergirl, if you wrap your leg
around...No, the left one.

866
00:57:50,854 --> 00:57:52,720
Around and over. Good.

867
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,787
See, we can go right into
doggy-style.

868
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:55,754
Perfect.

869
00:57:56,953 --> 00:57:59,186
Is the movement on the waterbed
a problem?

870
00:57:59,186 --> 00:58:01,819
No, not at all, Kurt, I dig it.
It's great.

871
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:03,219
Okay, can we do this?
Yeah.

872
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:04,985
All right, everybody. Here we go.

873
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:08,119
This is going to be great.

874
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:10,585
Do you want me to use
the Spanish accent?

875
00:58:17,183 --> 00:58:22,150
"Jack Horner has found something
special in newcomer Dirk Diggler."

876
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:26,316
It's another stellar sexual standout
from Horner and Company.

877
00:58:26,316 --> 00:58:30,016
Digger delivers a performance
worth a thousand hard-ons.

878
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:33,382
His presence when dressed is
powerful and demanding."

879
00:58:33,382 --> 00:58:35,382
"Stripped to the bone,

880
00:58:35,382 --> 00:58:38,447
Diggler's more eruptive
than a volcano on a bad day."

881
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:40,447
"Amber Waves' cherry lips

882
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:43,180
do a great job of
handling Diggler's wide load..."

883
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:47,380
"Rocking Reed Rothchild's stiff
biceps do a slapping good job...

884
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,779
job with Becky Barnett's
supple ass."

885
00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:53,545
"But it's Dirk Diggler that remains
the stand-out in this film.

886
00:58:53,545 --> 00:58:55,178
It's easy to predict
after only 2 films

887
00:58:55,178 --> 00:58:57,345
Diggler's suck-cess
can only grow...

888
00:58:57,345 --> 00:59:01,678
and grow and grow and grow and grow

889
00:59:01,678 --> 00:59:06,244
and grow and grow
and grow and grow."

890
01:00:11,702 --> 01:00:13,002
What else?

891
01:00:13,002 --> 01:00:17,601
That's it for now. Look at the
character Holmes came up with.

892
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:19,535
And look, I just...

893
01:00:20,234 --> 01:00:21,701
Tell me.

894
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,767
I don't like seeing women
treated that way.

895
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:25,467
The guy who plays Johnny Wadd.

896
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:26,166
It's always about
slapping a girl around.

897
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:28,367
It's not right. It's not cool.

898
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:32,966
It's just not sexy. It's not sexy
like it should be.

899
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:33,133
The guy's more like
a James Bond-type character.

900
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:37,832
You know, he's classy.

901
01:00:37,832 --> 01:00:40,365
He's a world-traveled guy.

902
01:00:40,365 --> 01:00:41,765
I like that.

903
01:00:41,765 --> 01:00:43,831
Reed could play my partner.

904
01:00:45,764 --> 01:00:47,331
I like that a lot.

905
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:48,898
We could make it really good, Jack.

906
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:52,230
Honestly, if you direct it, we make
a whole series with a whole story.

907
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,596
It's exactly what we've
always talked about.

908
01:00:55,596 --> 01:00:57,396
Please.

909
01:00:57,396 --> 01:00:59,463
When we get back...

910
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:01,629
set up the typewriter.

911
01:01:01,629 --> 01:01:03,629
We'll see what comes out of it.

912
01:01:03,629 --> 01:01:07,495
But I have to talk to the Colonel
when we get to Vegas.

913
01:01:07,495 --> 01:01:12,094
You must work on the Colonel too,
you must be committed.

914
01:01:12,094 --> 01:01:15,161
Right, right, Jack. I'll do
whatever I have to do.

915
01:01:16,494 --> 01:01:18,593
Does this character have a name?

916
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:23,059
His name is "Brock Landers."

917
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:25,893
And his partner's name is
"Chest Rockwell."

918
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,592
Those are great names!

919
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,458
And the award for "Best NewComer"
goes to...

920
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:38,158
yes, my baby boy, Dirk Diggler!

921
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:40,824
And the award for "Best Cock"
goes to...

922
01:01:40,824 --> 01:01:42,891
and here we go again, Dirk Diggler!

923
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:45,823
The award for "Best Actor"
goes to...

924
01:01:45,823 --> 01:01:48,856
I've seen all his movies and
I can't wait to work with him!

925
01:01:48,856 --> 01:01:51,723
Mr. Dirk Diggler!

926
01:02:28,885 --> 01:02:32,317
I don't know what to say.

927
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:37,849
I guess the only thing
I can say is...

928
01:02:37,849 --> 01:02:41,150
I'll promise to keep rocking and
rolling and making better films.

929
01:02:43,149 --> 01:02:45,716
You know, it seems we
makes these movies...

930
01:02:45,716 --> 01:02:50,214
and sometimes they're considered
filthy or something by some people.

931
01:02:50,214 --> 01:02:52,381
But I don't think that's true.

932
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:55,448
These movies we make,
they can be better.

933
01:02:55,448 --> 01:02:58,714
They can help, they really can.
I mean that!

934
01:02:58,714 --> 01:03:01,047
We can always do better.

935
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:03,479
I'm going to keep trying,
if you guys keep trying.

936
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,346
Let's keep rocking and rolling.

937
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:46,174
Shot of tequila, straight up.

938
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:48,141
Yes, ma'am.

939
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:53,440
I've been in this place for 20
minutes just to get a seat.

940
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,673
Are you alone?
Yeah.

941
01:03:55,673 --> 01:03:57,472
Just visiting LA.

942
01:03:57,472 --> 01:04:00,905
Some people told me the food in
here was really good.

943
01:04:00,905 --> 01:04:05,239
It's not good. It's the best place
to eat in all of LA.

944
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:07,038
It's excellent.

945
01:04:07,038 --> 01:04:12,904
I hope so. I could die of starvation
before I get something in my mouth.

946
01:04:14,337 --> 01:04:16,103
Still hungry?

947
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,836
Starving.

948
01:04:22,102 --> 01:04:24,369
Why don't you feast on that.

949
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:26,602
Oh, it's true.

950
01:04:38,234 --> 01:04:40,034
What's that?

951
01:04:40,034 --> 01:04:42,600
You are Brock Landers.

952
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,064
Freeze!

953
01:05:07,064 --> 01:05:09,463
Don't make me chase you, Raphael!

954
01:05:21,695 --> 01:05:22,595
Freeze!

955
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:41,459
We're almost there. I want you
to trim the head.

956
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:43,059
Take the shot of Reed
with the revolver.

957
01:05:43,059 --> 01:05:44,892
Just dump it and switch
the title card.

958
01:05:44,892 --> 01:05:49,624
I want it to come flying out of
the screen at the audience.

959
01:05:49,624 --> 01:05:52,691
Nice. Piece of cake.

960
01:05:51,357 --> 01:05:52,724
That's my guy.

961
01:05:55,723 --> 01:05:58,224
I told him, this is a special
party for Scotty J.

962
01:05:58,224 --> 01:06:00,723
I want your lightest,
bubbliest champagne.

963
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:04,622
This is what he gave me. Take a sip
of this and tell me what you think.

964
01:06:04,622 --> 01:06:08,789
This is supposed to be really good
stuff. Here, take a sip.

965
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:12,055
Is that pretty light?
Yeah, that is.

966
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:13,055
What do you think?

967
01:06:13,055 --> 01:06:14,521
It's beautiful!

968
01:06:14,521 --> 01:06:15,721
Look how spacious it is.

969
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,388
Yeah, look. I like these.

970
01:06:17,388 --> 01:06:20,121
That's custom made. That's real
Italian leather.

971
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:21,821
Watch this.

972
01:06:23,387 --> 01:06:24,320
What's that?

973
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,587
My initials.

974
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:27,553
That's imaginative! How'd you
think of that?

975
01:06:27,553 --> 01:06:29,920
I was thinking of my name
and dreamt it up.

976
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,019
I'm almost finished.
It looks great.

977
01:06:33,019 --> 01:06:36,385
I used a little poetic license
to capture your essence.

978
01:06:36,385 --> 01:06:38,351
It looks great.

979
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:41,051
It's a good piece for conversation.
It's really neat.

980
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:43,051
Jesse did all that oil painting
as well.

981
01:06:43,051 --> 01:06:44,818
Buck is still installing
the stereo.

982
01:06:44,818 --> 01:06:47,217
That's a bean bag!

983
01:06:47,217 --> 01:06:48,617
And that lamp...those are real
sterling silver.

984
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:50,516
It's a very interesting room.
It has a very modern feel too.

985
01:06:50,516 --> 01:06:55,183
Watch this. You ready?
Can't wait to see it.

986
01:06:56,715 --> 01:07:01,482
It's my dojo.
It's all Asian! An Asian room!

987
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:03,382
It has that whole karate feel.

988
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:05,015
It's very comfortable.

989
01:07:05,015 --> 01:07:07,015
Yeah. A lot of ancient China.

990
01:07:07,015 --> 01:07:09,081
I have my statues
for my Best Actor awards.

991
01:07:09,081 --> 01:07:11,481
A good place to keep your awards.
I'm glad.

992
01:07:11,481 --> 01:07:13,747
Look up there.

993
01:07:13,747 --> 01:07:14,947
Oh, that's handy.

994
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,480
Can you see yourself?.
Yeah.

995
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,580
It's great, huh?

996
01:07:19,213 --> 01:07:21,413
It's my whole, entire wardrobe.

997
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:25,112
It's all perfectly organized for me
by color as well as designer.

998
01:07:25,112 --> 01:07:29,511
You don't have to think about it
or anything.

999
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:32,511
You'll love it. This is my favorite
thing in the world.

1000
01:07:32,511 --> 01:07:33,678
Close your eyes.

1001
01:07:33,678 --> 01:07:35,677
Okay, you ready?
Yeah, baby.

1002
01:07:41,477 --> 01:07:42,710
Isn't it beautiful?

1003
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,010
Oh, God.

1004
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,443
This is it. This is the thing.

1005
01:07:47,242 --> 01:07:48,875
You deserve this, baby.

1006
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:50,209
Isn't it great?

1007
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:52,109
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1008
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,642
Want to go for a ride?

1009
01:07:53,642 --> 01:07:54,942
Oh, yeah!

1010
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:58,108
She rocks!

1011
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,641
Hold on!

1012
01:08:03,607 --> 01:08:05,274
You set us up, Chico.

1013
01:08:05,274 --> 01:08:07,640
Fuck with Raphael and Ringo,

1014
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,340
that's your business.
Don't fuck with Chest!

1015
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,039
You know what? You're not even worth
it! I gave you a chance!

1016
01:08:20,938 --> 01:08:22,372
I trusted him.

1017
01:08:25,538 --> 01:08:27,104
Well, we almost solved the case.

1018
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,971
At least the women are safe.

1019
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,270
Let's go get some of that
Saturday night beaver.

1020
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:38,636
No one fucks with Chest and Brock.

1021
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:42,502
This is the best work
we've ever done.

1022
01:08:42,502 --> 01:08:44,935
It's a real film, Jack.

1023
01:08:46,635 --> 01:08:48,068
It feels good.

1024
01:08:48,068 --> 01:08:50,301
You made it fly.

1025
01:08:51,801 --> 01:08:56,167
This is the film...

1026
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:58,434
I want them to remember me by.

1027
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,265
Thank you.

1028
01:09:29,196 --> 01:09:32,896
As far as I'm concerned, it's all
about love. You know what I mean?

1029
01:09:32,896 --> 01:09:36,295
If you love someone, how hard
can the world be?

1030
01:09:36,295 --> 01:09:38,895
Peole will come and they will go,

1031
01:09:38,895 --> 01:09:41,194
and so will Problems,
but ultimately...

1032
01:09:41,194 --> 01:09:43,561
if you have got love on your side,
and it is just...

1033
01:09:43,561 --> 01:09:49,926
I mean, it is just
deep down in your soul...

1034
01:09:50,793 --> 01:09:54,492
what's a problem that takes your
attention away from that?

1035
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:57,925
Do you understand?

1036
01:09:59,692 --> 01:10:01,125
I'm Becky Barnett.

1037
01:10:02,358 --> 01:10:03,892
Jerome.

1038
01:10:03,892 --> 01:10:04,958
Nice to meet you.

1039
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:06,525
Nice to meet you, too, Becky.

1040
01:10:06,525 --> 01:10:08,124
So, what do you do?

1041
01:10:08,124 --> 01:10:10,657
I'm in the auto industry.

1042
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:14,190
I'm a regional manager
over at Pep Boys.

1043
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:17,057
That's great, that's great.

1044
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:19,022
You've got a really
nice smile, Becky.

1045
01:10:20,256 --> 01:10:21,822
Thank you...

1046
01:10:21,822 --> 01:10:23,822
Jerome.

1047
01:10:36,954 --> 01:10:40,087
The Colonel.

1048
01:10:40,087 --> 01:10:42,520
Floyd Gondolli!

1049
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,487
Great you could make it.
Great, great!

1050
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:47,352
How are you? You look happy.

1051
01:10:47,352 --> 01:10:48,886
I'm fine.

1052
01:10:48,886 --> 01:10:51,352
Meet boys, Tommy, Pete.

1053
01:10:51,352 --> 01:10:53,518
Meet girls, Cyndi, Angie.

1054
01:10:54,885 --> 01:10:57,051
These are the next stars.

1055
01:10:57,051 --> 01:10:59,251
There are the real people
in the world.

1056
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:02,951
I think we ought to talk to Jack.

1057
01:11:02,951 --> 01:11:05,317
Iron this thing out
before the new year?

1058
01:11:05,317 --> 01:11:06,749
Let's do it.

1059
01:11:06,749 --> 01:11:09,083
But what were you thinking?
What were you feeling?

1060
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,250
Did you do research?

1061
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,516
What are you talking about here?

1062
01:11:12,516 --> 01:11:13,949
Oh, nothing.

1063
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:15,648
Want to come with me for a while?

1064
01:11:15,648 --> 01:11:16,682
Where?

1065
01:11:16,682 --> 01:11:18,882
It's a surprise, surprise, surprise.

1066
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:21,515
Yeah, let's go. Excuse me, Jessie.

1067
01:11:50,745 --> 01:11:52,010
Hey, Buck.

1068
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:54,077
Hey, Jessie. How you doing?

1069
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:55,610
Are you sitting alone?

1070
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:57,044
Yes.

1071
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,509
Todd Parker!

1072
01:12:02,509 --> 01:12:04,275
Rocking Reed Rothchild!

1073
01:12:04,275 --> 01:12:06,609
You made it!

1074
01:12:08,275 --> 01:12:10,608
It's an amazing party.
Fucking chicks everywhere.

1075
01:12:10,608 --> 01:12:13,308
You bet. Courtesy of
Jack Horner, thank you.

1076
01:12:13,308 --> 01:12:16,674
I wouldn't mind me having a piece
of that action over there.

1077
01:12:16,674 --> 01:12:18,340
Michelle. I'll introduce you.

1078
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,574
Sure. Introduce her to my lap.

1079
01:12:21,574 --> 01:12:22,607
Did you get off work?

1080
01:12:22,607 --> 01:12:24,506
Don't dance Sunday nights.

1081
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,539
Who's Vette is that in the driveway?

1082
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:27,639
Dirk.

1083
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:29,172
I'm jealous of him.

1084
01:12:29,172 --> 01:12:30,206
That shit's jamming.

1085
01:12:30,206 --> 01:12:32,306
Start down low with a 350 cube.
3 1/4 horsepower,

1086
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,005
4 speed, 4-10 gears...

1087
01:12:35,005 --> 01:12:39,505
10 coats of orange, hand-rubbed
lacquer with a dual-plane manifold.

1088
01:12:39,505 --> 01:12:41,271
Full fucking race cams.

1089
01:12:50,803 --> 01:12:52,737
I'm pretty happy with it, you know?

1090
01:12:52,737 --> 01:12:54,969
It's a great look for you, I think.

1091
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:57,869
It's pretty original,
you know, I think.

1092
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:03,935
Take this off.
