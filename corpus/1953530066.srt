But things got out of control,
and before they knew it,

177
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,269
Trevor was at the bottom
of a ravine half-dead

178
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,704
with his face
eaten by hungry birds.

179
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:08,965
What happened to him?

180
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,307
Well, naturally...

181
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,576
Naturally, he went to the hospital.

182
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:15,946
Medical at first, then mental.

183
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:19,316
His face was so badly disfigured
that he took to wearing a mask all the time.

184
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,817

187
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:28,592
At some point he was either released,

188
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,995
or he broke out of the mental hospital.

189
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,032
Then it's said he returned
to Camp Placid Pines

190
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,768
to forever seek out
his revenge on the place

191
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:42,273

that did this to him.

stupid enough to fall for that?

early in those movies,

said good-bye.

with your own eyes.

I can't believe that I could have
misjudged Mike that way.

765
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:49,704
I mean, did you ever think in your wildest dreams
that he was capable of that?

766
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:51,706
No. But that's the way it always is.

767
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:53,174
But why would he do it?

768
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:55,109
I didn't know psychopaths
needed motives.

Rick, for one.

772
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,451
I mean, he was also unaccounted for
during all of the murders.

773
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:06,087
Rick had an alibi.
At least he says he does.

774
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:07,622

in his cabin.

And I didn't know what to do
or think about it.

And then
all you guys came running.

795
00:57:56,738 --> 00:57:59,074
Mike probably didn't want to get caught in
a compromising position

796
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:00,641
so he hid for a while.

797

No. Mike was still unaccounted
for during Elvis' murder.

think that Mike's a killer?

to tell him that he was leaving.

So our pagers hold up to 50 incoming
and outgoing messages in the memory, right?

Yeah.

825

Right, so all we have to do  is
compare Rick's pager to Ryan's and Mike's

826
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,650
and we should be able
to narrow down the killer.

is find Ryan's pager,
