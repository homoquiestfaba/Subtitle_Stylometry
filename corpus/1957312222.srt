1
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:13,446
Hey, what's that?

2
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:17,994
Ah! That is our ticket to success.

3
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:20,310
Drink that, and any time you want,
you can throw up.

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,605
Throw up?

5
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,457
I'll get it.

6
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:32,151
Is this The Monkees' pad?

7
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:35,536
I'm the lawyer for the estate
of the late Lancelot von

8
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,900
Baresfitresily the fourth,
known to his friends as Chuck.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,890
Mr. The Fourth has left
his entire fortune to The Monkees,

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,905
provided you spend
one evening at his mansion.

11
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,073
A mansion, which some say is...

12
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,182
...haunted.

13
00:00:53,382 --> 00:00:55,812
Uh, oh, I think we did that one already.

14
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,619
Mike, uh, when did
we do the, uh, staying in

15
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:01,663
the haunted mansion for
the inheritance episode?

16
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:05,734
Oh, gosh, it was years ago, like episode
one eighty-six or something.

17
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,086
We were wearing bell bottoms!

18
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:10,261
Yeah, I'm sorry, we did that,
but thanks anyway.

19
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,829
- Would you like a drink?
- Thank you.

20
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:16,620
<i>Blagh!</i>

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,827
<i>Here we come, walkin'
down the street</i>

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,702
<i>We get the funniest looks
from every one we meet</i>

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,885
<i>Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,
and people say we monkey around</i>

24
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:37,995
<i>But we're too busy singing
to put anybody down</i>

25
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:43,518
<i>We go wherever we want to
Do what we want to do</i>

26
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:49,800
<i>We don't have time to get restless
There's always something new</i>

27
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:55,022
<i>Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,
you never know where we'll be found</i>

28
00:01:55,522 --> 00:02:00,721
<i>So you better get ready,
we may be comin' to your town</i>

29
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:07,850
Hey, remember that band last week that got
the job instead of us by trashing the place?

30
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,122
There are a lot of funny
euphemisms for "throw up".

31
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:13,512
You know, they were spinning around
and stuff? Well, they had a gimmick.

32
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:15,554
They were grungy and offensive and loud.

33
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:16,635
And rich!

34
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:17,963
Like "toss your cookies"?

35
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:20,842
Yeah, exactly, and rich!
What's the name of that other band,

36
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:23,131
the one with the blood
and the make-up, um...

37
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,139
Kiss?

38
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:27,330
No thanks. You know they have,
uh, high heels, and, uh,

39
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,411
the guy has a nine foot tongue?
What is their name?

40
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:31,915
Uh, Kiss?

41
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:35,100
No, but Davy wants one.
Anyway, they're rich too.

42
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,842
Or, uh, "driving the porcelain bus"?

43
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:40,851
So, I figured, we could become
the world's first throw-up band.

44
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:43,413
You know,
<i>Hey, hey, we're The Monkees.</i>

45
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:46,642
<i>People say we</i> bleech!?
Ha ha ha! Kids'll love it.

46
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:49,173
Two year olds, maybe.
Tonight, we are playing

47
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:51,915
the most prestigious
country club in this city.

48
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:53,530
The name of the band is Kiss.

49
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,554
Could be the world!

50
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:56,387
They're like... kabuki metal.

51
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,778
We can't just go there,
and well, I don't know-

52
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:02,355
Blow chow? Although, that's a
lot like blow lunch.

53
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:05,619
Well, it wouldn't have to be gross.
It could be more like confetti.

54
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,410
People don't wanna see us- what'd
you say- "tossing a sandwich"?

55
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,228
No, but that works. Better if it's hurl
a sandwich, but toss works.

56
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:18,203
Look, even if it does look like confetti,
the club today is only for the best people.

57
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:21,473
We have to dress up,
and we have to play it straight.

58
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:24,697
I can do Tasmanian kabuki.

59
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,843
See? That's great!

60
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:40,562
No, it is not great.
It is silly.

61
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,499
What's in this stuff?

62
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,779
Don't ask.

63
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,268
Davy's right; we don't really need a
gimmick. I mean, you know, it's like...

64
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:52,586
"Believe": I believe for every drop
of rain that falls, a flower grows.

65
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:57,099
And every time The Monkees sing,
they also blow!

66
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,371
Ah!

67
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,146
What'd I say?

68
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:05,616
On your right, the remnant of a tomato
hurled at Micky during a concert in

69
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:10,144
nineteen eighty-three by an irate
cattleman who believed he had purchased

70
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:14,291
tickets to a chili cook-off. Now if you'll
follow me upstairs to the freezer section,

71
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:19,949
we'll see what is believed to be the world's
first TV dinner, a gift from a fan who-

72
00:04:20,898 --> 00:04:22,962
Terrible! No gimmicks!

73
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,817
How can you say that?
What about all those

74
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:27,066
"Davy falling in love" stars, huh?
That's a gimmick.

75
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,176
No, I never ever did those on purpose,
and besides,

76
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,827
that was such a long time ago anyway.

77
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:34,043
Uh-huh, what about that one?

78
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:36,339
Leftovers!

79
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,091
Well, maybe not entirely.
I did run into someone the other day,

80
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,226
but I just don't do that on purpose,
you know.

81
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:42,130
- Mm-hm.
- It just happens.

82
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,763
- Mm-hm.
- But that is not a gimmick.

83
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:44,611
Mm-hm.

84
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:47,814
I can do "Donald Duck
has a temper tantrum".

85
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,555
See? That's great too!

86
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:54,176
We better start rehearsing before
another plot line shows up.

87
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,999
Are we gonna dress alike?

88
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,075
Absolutely. People still wanna
see a professional show.

89
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:03,299
Hey, how about if we dress
as professional wrestlers?

90
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,598
Come on, you guys!

91
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:08,334
Is this, is this the club
that wouldn't let in

92
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:10,547
Ethel Merman because
she was wearing pants?

93
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,732
Don't you mean Esther Merman,
the underwater swimmer?

94
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:15,539
No, Esther Williams was
the underwater swimmer.

95
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:16,760
Then who's Esther Merman?

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,354
Esther Merman's the underwater
singer. Ha ha ha ha ha!

97
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:20,384
Ha ha ha.

98
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:23,506
Come on, guys. We really do
need to rehearse before-

99
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,260
Uh oh. Too late.

100
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,277
Quick! Hide me! I'm being chased by a
bunch of guys with cell phones and...

101
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:33,909
...black gloves.

102
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,435
Sorry, darling.
We already did that one.

103
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:39,097
Hey, hey, Mike.
When did we do that one, anyway?

104
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,184
Ages ago.
But there was no cell phone.

105
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,249
We're starting to rehearse.

106
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,671
How about this? I can't remember who I am.
I woke up sitting

107
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:54,022
on a bus stop with a note
pinned to my dress that read...

108
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:56,552
..."return to sender".

109
00:05:56,752 --> 00:06:02,152
Wow. That is not bad.
What do you think, guys?

110
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:05,507
I'm really sorry, but we have a very
important gig tonight at the world's

111
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:08,600
most prestigious country club,
and we really do have to rehearse.

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,232
Oh, can I listen?

113
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:11,864
Mm... okay. Go on.

114
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:14,697
Actually, I'm with a friend.
Do you mind if they come in?

115
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:17,566
Sure. Fine.

116
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,227
What? What?

117
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:30,217
We weren't expecting an audience,
but since you're here,

118
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,315
there's drinks in the microwave. Ha!

119
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,421
<i>After all the spotlights
and the flowers</i>

120
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:54,032
<i>After all the parties and goodbyes</i>

121
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:59,220
<i>There was something in the air</i>

122
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,006
<i>Something that we realized</i>

123
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:04,122
<i>People always say</i>

124
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:09,521
<i>'Cause it was you and I</i>

125
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,675
<i>You and I</i>

126
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:20,079
<i>After all the music and the madness</i>

127
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,240
<i>After all the late night fantasies</i>

128
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,277
<i>We knew that we
would make it through</i>

129
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:35,121
<i>There was little in our way
Nothing they could do</i>

130
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:40,732
<i>'Cause it was you and I
and promises not broken</i>

131
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:46,176
<i>You and I and magic memories</i>

132
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:50,896
<i>After all was said and done,
they never understood</i>

133
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,598
<i>How we always made it</i>

134
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:55,727
<i>You know we always would</i>

135
00:07:55,927 --> 00:08:01,303
<i>'Cause it was you and I</i>

136
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:05,440
<i>You and I</i>

137
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:32,782
<i>Now it seems that we
are still together</i>

138
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:38,000
<i>When all the others
never made it through</i>

139
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,211
<i>Someday They learn
what's our way</i>

140
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:47,612
<i>It isn't such a secret
It isn't hard to do</i>

141
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:53,219
<i>'Cause it's just you and I
and promises not broken</i>

142
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:58,813
<i>You and I, magic memories</i>

143
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:03,550
<i>After all was said and done,
they never understood</i>

144
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,048
<i>How we always made it</i>

145
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:08,551
<i>You know we always would</i>

146
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:14,400
<i>'Cause it's just you and I</i>

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,736
<i>You and I</i>

148
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:23,727
<i>You and I</i>

149
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:33,464
<i>You and I</i>

150
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,226
Wow, that sounded great.
I'll tell you what, though, we should, uh,

151
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:39,608
rehearse some of the old hits, because
they're gonna be asking for them for sure.

152
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:43,504
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Okay, uh,
let's start with "Clarksville", huh?

153
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:52,778
<i>Take the last train to Clarksville</i>

154
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,458
? And- ?
- What was that?!

155
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:55,570
The laugh track.

156
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,643
Sounds broken.

157
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:57,883
What, the laugh track?

158
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,212
Not again!

159
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:03,914
Yeah, but I like it when that happens.
The house is on fire!

160
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,179
People are starving!

161
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:17,633
There is no fruit!

162
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,026
I think we better shut it off.

163
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:21,514
Good idea.

164
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,574
This'll fix it.

165
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:27,815
Uh oh.

166
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,095
This is really messed up.

167
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:35,991
Just turn 'em all off.

168
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:38,319
What, even the wild applause?

169
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,088
Yes! We have to rehearse!
Everything!

170
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:44,119
Ah, man, I was just having fun.

171
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:48,792
Whoa!

172
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:50,007
Now what?

173
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:52,048
A lizard sunning itself on a rock.

174
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:53,177
What?

175
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:56,451
Stock footage.
I think the show may be a little

176
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:58,119
short of film,
and they're having to put in this-

177
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,078
Oh!- this stock shot that they're
getting from a film library.

178
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:06,045
Well, it's really annoying!

179
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:09,397
Let's get out of here. Go to the
beach or something, huh?

180
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:13,637
Suits me. I'm starting to
get thought balloons.

181
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:24,761
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you. You like me.

182
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,396
You, you, you really like me!

183
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:56,274
You don't really think that
we need a gimmick, do you?

184
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:58,980
After all these years of being just us.

185
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,366
Oh, I guess not.

186
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:04,173
Because, you know, Mike has turned
the Monkeemobile into a low-rider.

187
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:09,413
He what? You turned our
car into a low-rider?

188
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:12,901
Well, I was in traffic the other day,
and this guy pulls up beside me,

189
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:17,342
and his car started hopping up and down like
one of those colorful South American birds.

190
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:20,405
But that's silly! The Monkeemobile
is our special thing.

191
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:24,509
Oh, I left it Monkees; it's a
dimension machine now as well.

192
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,516
Ooh!

193
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:28,214
Like a time machine, except it
goes into different dimensions.

194
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,583
We cannot go to the
most prestigious country

195
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,854
club in the whole world
in a hopping bird.

196
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:34,732
We can if we're in another dimension.

197
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:35,614
Please!

198
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,325
Now, see how it feels?

199
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:38,717
Well, I can put it back.

200
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:42,360
Well, I should think so.
I mean, you can't change our car.

201
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,158
It's the Monkeemobile,
for heaven's sakes.

202
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:48,090
These are the bones of the Elephant Man.

203
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,864
And these are the bones
of the Invisible Man.

204
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:55,238
And this is the transmission
from the Monkeemobile.

205
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:57,852
It's a classic.

206
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:04,117
Right? Right. Right? Right. Ahh, ooh!

207
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,621
Oh, he's dead!
Oh, he's dead!

208
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,566
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

209
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:13,749
Come on, guys, let's go.
You know, we've still got to rehearse,

210
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:16,110
and that gig's only a
couple of hours from now.

211
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,424
You will, you will fix
the car, right, Mike?

212
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:19,274
Yeah.

213
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:20,697
But don't change that dimension thing.

214
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:22,360
I don't wanna go back to the pad.

215
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,487
Hey, well, why don't
we do it right here?

216
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,392
This could draw a crowd.

217
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:28,025
Yeah.

218
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,989
Yeah, in your dreams. Okay, guys, strap in.

219
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:37,178
Go, uh, "Circle Sky", new version.
One, two, three, four!

220
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:55,231
<i>Circle sky</i>

221
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:59,633

<i>Oh yes, it looks like we've

252
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,338
Were we that bad?

253
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:16,670
I raised a pig from birth,
and now, my dad

254
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,002
tells me we have to sell him for... bacon!

255
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:24,394
Hey, uh, bacon!
Hey, that's not bad, huh?

256
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:28,170
We did that. It was a calf thing, but it
was essentially the same story.

257
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:33,060
Well, we can't just let a kid cry like this.
We have to entertain him somehow.

258
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,057
Hey. Wherever there's a cop beating
up on a guy, I'm gonna be there.

259
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:41,450
Wherever there's the poor and the
homeless and the hungry, I'll be there.

260
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,035
Waaaah-ha-ha!

261
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:46,049
Hey! What did you do?

262
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:47,966
I did the closing scene
from Grapes of Wrath.

263
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,521
Henry Fonda's speech, it's one of the great
scenes in movies. You said entertain him-

264
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:57,312
Yeah, but you're scaring him.
You have to entertain with a capital E!

265
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:01,297
? Gonna build a mountain
from a little rope ?

266
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,475
? Gonna need an onion and a little soap ?
? Gonna build a mountain- ?

267
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:08,207
Waaaah-ha-ha!

268
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:10,242
Those aren't the words, are they?

269
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:12,642
Well, I can never remember,
but it's not about that;

270
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,308
it's about the emotion, you know.

271
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:16,691
The rope, the soap,
the hope, you know, just-

272
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:19,922
Let me, let me. Hey, kid.
Wanna see me throw up?

273
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:22,250
- Yeah!
- Heh heh heh heh.

274
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,864
Whoa, dude, that's chill!
Can you do that again?

275
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:29,552
Yeah, sure.

276
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,159
I gotta go get my friends.

277
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,257
Wait a minute.
What about your pet pig?

278
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:38,280
Um... I never really
liked him that much.

279
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,208
Hey, guys? You don't think that we
need any kind of storyline?

280
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:46,728
I kinda liked that "pet pig into bacon"
thing- sweet and scary at the same time.

281
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,016
Well, really, not as long as
we're having a good time.

282
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:52,665
Think it's perfectly alright that we don't
have any visible means of support?

283
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,864
Well, who says our
means have to be visible?

284
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:58,417
Don't you think that we should
have some dramatic tension?

285
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:02,912
Some, some, some drama, distress,
some worry, some... some kind of goal?

286
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:05,452
Why? I mean, we been hanging
out like this for years.

287
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:09,251
Once every five years or so, a good
storyline comes along, but other than that,

288
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,915
it's better just to be hanging out,
having a good time.

289
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:15,264
We're on the beach, life is a bowl
of oysters, what could be better?

290
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:16,864
I wonder, if the pig talked...

291
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:19,065
Now, see, it doesn't make any
difference if the pig talks.

292
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:23,253
I got it. Alright. The landlord, he comes
to the door for the last rent payment,

293
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,633
and then, and then, all of a sudden,
we're on a desert island.

294
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,208
Yeah.

295
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:28,903
On the other side, there's
some buried treasure-

296
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:31,651
Rent? We probably own the house by now,
and besides,

297
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:34,849
who wants to do a story just
for the sake of doing a story?

298
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,968
Ah, now it's your turn. That's how
I felt about the Monkeemobile.

299
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,894
Yeah, and that's the way I
felt about tossing sandwiches.

300
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:42,360
What do you think, Peter?

301
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,186
Sandwich- no, no sandwiches.
If the pig talks, sandwiches wouldn't work.

302
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:49,872
Oh, whoa!

303
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,902
- Ah, lizard's back.
- It's alright.

304
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:54,215
I'm telling you, guys,
we need a storyline.

305
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:59,120
No, it's okay. No.
We just need to do... music!

306
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:01,959
Let's just come on,
and we'll do music.

307
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:18,085
? Antarctica is where I wanna be ?

308
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:26,826
Antarctica is where I wanna be?

309
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:35,881
? Antarctica is where I wanna be,

310
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:38,206
? I wanna be ?

311
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:44,998
? Antarctica is where I wanna be ?

312
00:20:45,198 --> 00:20:48,341
? I wanna be ?

313
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:54,029
? Antarctica is where I wanna be ?

314
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:03,666
? Antarctica is where I wanna be ?

315
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:09,055
? Antarctica... ?

316
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:13,031
THIS IS NOT A PIPE

317
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:16,111
THIS IS NOT A BAND

318
00:21:27,564 --> 00:21:30,509
Hey, did you see the way that
kid reacted to my throw-up idea?

319
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,829
Mick, he was eight.

320
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,581
Stop calling it that;
it's only confetti.

321
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:36,268
It's Magic Monkee Dust.

322
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:38,469
Hey, how about calling it
Magic Monkey Hurl?

323
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:40,834
I think eight year olds
deserve better than that.

324
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,884
Look, what's that
purple dinosaur thing?

325
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,381
Remember these?

326
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:50,487
Precisely my point. All that dinosaur thing
is is one of those, but way out of control.

327
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:53,501
I mean, you're talking about
mesmerizing four years olds, here.

328
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,912
I think Davy's right.
Just 'cause you can thrill a toddler

329
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:58,361
by chewing with your mouth open,
doesn't mean you should.

330
00:21:58,561 --> 00:22:00,141
It's not exactly a reference standard.

331
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:02,229
Don't you think playing for
little kids would be fun?

332
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:04,799
I think playing for little kids is fun,

333
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,330
but I don't think we have to do
any more than play our music.

334
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,235
I mean, maybe a few dance steps,
but other than that, we're The Monkees.

335
00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:14,115
That's all we need to be.

336
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:19,937
This is it.
Once, hundreds of years ago, four guys moved

337
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:24,588
into this house and went crazy,
and never moved out.

338
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:25,361
They still live there?

339
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:29,747
Oh yeah. They have chainsaws
and hockey masks,

340
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,301
and they chase little kids.

341
00:22:31,352 --> 00:22:37,682
One of them... has a hatchet.
Are you afraid? Wanna kiss?

342
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:41,442
I'm scared of kissing you.

343
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:44,968
And so he should be.
Huh huh. Come on.

344
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:47,536
You know, in today's
world of safe sex,

345
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:50,226
it seems we've forgot
about safe kissing.

346
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:53,280
Now, while not as dangerous as,
say, bringing a toaster

347
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,493
into the bathtub with you,
kissing does have its perils.

348
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,950
For instance, remember at the
beginning of the show,

349
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,576
when Davy asked me for that kiss?

350
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:04,744
Now, that was as dangerous
as it was bizarre. Huh huh.

351
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:08,180
You know, I've seen people catch
fire just by shaking hands.

352
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,178
Ah, Mike!
The Monkeemobile jumped up!

353
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:13,480
I'll fix it! I'll fix it!
I promise.

354
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,024
It ruined my routine! I was doing a
riff on the dangers of kissing.

355
00:23:21,224 --> 00:23:21,872
Why?

356
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:25,190
Oh, there was a couple parked out by
the house, and the girl was doing

357
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,463
"crazy guys live there"
in order to scare the guy into kissing her.

358
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:29,791
Well, it always worked for me.

359
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,078
It always works for everybody. I was
just interrupting before it turned into

360
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,951
"and the only good crazy
person is a crazy

361
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:37,024
person whose house is
covered in toilet paper".

362
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:39,737
Well, they were just
telling ghost stories.

363
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:41,456
MAN: Your bumper fell off!

364
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:42,696
How does it work?

365
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:46,153
I put it on the radio.
This is the first dimension.

366
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:47,447
Not a lot to do there.

367
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:50,500
And this is the second dimension.

368
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,277
Which is, you know,
Flatland sort of thing.

369
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,480
And this is the third dimension.

370
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,421
- Yeah, right.
- Which is normal.

371
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:00,797
- Mm-hm.
- Well, Monkees normal.

372
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:01,822
- Yep.
- Yeah, right.

373
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:05,223
And then this is the fourth dimension.

374
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:08,870
Whoa!

375
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,423
Yeah! Stephen Hawking, eat your heart out.

376
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:19,992
I can dig it.

377
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,471
And really, that's as far as I got.

378
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:23,000
Well, but there's more buttons.

379
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,733
Wait!

380
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:28,777
That's the sixties button.
It changes us back into the sixties.

381
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:31,545
The problem is, it changes everything else

382
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:33,453
around the car for about
a hundred yards too.

383
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:35,697
What's that last one do?

384
00:24:35,897 --> 00:24:38,716
Well, the last one is kind of,
I don't know, it's an odd button.

385
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:41,064
It just changes one object
into another object.

386
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:43,830
It's, uh, doesn't really work right yet.

387
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,136
The real problem is that none of
it stays completely in the car.

388
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:49,368
Very Monkees.

389
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:50,832
Heh heh. Yeah, thanks.

390
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,886
Ah, I still wish it was the way it was.

391
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:54,265
Me too.

392
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:55,568
Not even the hop?

393
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:57,019
Mm... neh.

394
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:59,595
Well. Here.

395
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:01,054
- Hm?
- You drive.

396
00:25:01,254 --> 00:25:03,749
- Okay.
- I'm tired.

397
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:29,072
Good evening.
Can I help you?

398
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:30,299
Hi! We're The Monkees.

399
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:36,912
The Monkees?! Huh huh huh, yeah,
right, and I'm Ethel Merman.

400
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:40,782
No! I'm Ethel Merman!

401
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:51,633
? Dance with me! ?

402
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:55,162
? I can see in your eyes
you wanna dance with me ?

403
00:25:55,479 --> 00:26:01,077
? Let's dance, dance,
dance, dance, dance! ?

404
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:03,712
? - Let's dance ?
- Outstanding!

405
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:04,861
But I still can't let you in.

406
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:07,815
Sorry, women are not
allowed to wear pants.

407
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,985
That guard wasn't gonna let us in.

408
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:34,001
Yeah, good thinking, Dave.

409
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:38,201
Huh! I never met a guard yet that
wasn't a sucker for Ethel Merman.

410
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:39,024
Sound check!

411
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:42,615
Yeah, here we go.
One, two, three, four!

412
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,321
<i>She's a regional girl</i>

413
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:56,769
<i>Come to the big city,
give it a whirl</i>

414
00:26:56,969 --> 00:27:00,902
<i>She thinks that she can make it
She thinks that she can take it</i>

415
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:05,038
<i>I think she's gonna end up
flippin' burgers in a basement</i>

416
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:09,264
<i>She's a regional girl</i>

417
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:17,313
<i>He's a regional guy</i>

418
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:20,665
<i>Come to the big city,
give it a try</i>

419
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:24,834
<i>He wants to be a mover
Yeah, he wants to shake it up</i>

420
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:28,562
<i>I think he's gonna end up
pourin' Pepsi in a cup</i>

421
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:32,784
<i>'Cause it's a regional lie</i>

422
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:37,375
<i>It's a regional lie</i>

423
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,690
<i>Mary, Mary, Mississippi,
Indiana Jones</i>

424
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,459
<i>Did you think that you could
really make it on your own?</i>

425
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:57,069
<i>A-singing whoa, oh oh oh,</i>

426
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:00,997
<i>whoa, oh oh oh</i>

427
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:04,575
<i>Eddie, Eddie, good and ready,
now you've got your chance</i>

428
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:08,481
<i>Try to keep the little buggers
playin' with your pants</i>

429
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:12,821
<i>A-singing whoa, oh oh oh,</i>

430
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:16,808
<i>whoa, oh oh oh</i>

431
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:21,256
<i>It's a regional lie</i>

432
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:24,826
<i>The grass is always greener,
and the loyals never lie</i>

433
00:28:25,026 --> 00:28:28,545
<i>You wanna hit the big one
Yeah, you wanna strike it rich</i>

434
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:32,333
<i>I think you're gonna end up
flippin' burgers for some bitch</i>

435
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:36,297
<i>'Cause it's a regional lie</i>

436
00:28:56,874 --> 00:29:00,214
<i>Mary, Mary, Mississippi,

00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:04,850

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,667

00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:12,496

445
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:40,270
<i>It's a regional lie</i>

446
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,020
Well, hello! I am so
honored to meet you!

447
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,437
Ha ha.

448
00:30:01,637 --> 00:30:04,571
I'm Chuck.

449
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:06,003
...the manager of the club?

450
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:07,140
Oh.

451
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,981
And this is my drop-dead beautiful
daughter, the princess entwined.

452
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:12,141
The princess?

453
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,588
Not a real princess. That's just
what daddy calls me to be nice,

454
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:18,932
because he seems to think I've
lost a few tiles on re-entry.

455
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:20,148
Excuse me?

456
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:24,134
He says I didn't quite come through the
rocket ride, and I'm a little bats.

457
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:27,148
I don't know, he may be right,
or he may be disturbed.

458
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:30,228
There's a lot of funny
euphemisms for "dumb".

459
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,946
A few cards short of a deck.

460
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:35,230
Well, I hope you fellas
play all your old hits,

461
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,715
because if this party isn't
successful, I may...

462
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:39,861
...lose the club.

463
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:42,124
Lose the club?
That's a good episode!

464
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:42,828
Lame-o!

465
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:46,245
Hey, how about if the princess and
I are stranded on a desert island.

466
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,666
We have one more rent payment
to pay, and there's

467
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:51,364
some buried treasure on the
other side of the island!

468
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:54,116
One oar in the water...

469
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:56,348
You know, we really, we got a
new record out, and we need-

470
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:58,392
Oh, but you are gonna play
some of those old hits?

471
00:30:58,592 --> 00:30:59,796
"Boil That Cabbage Down, Boys"?

472
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,524
One brick shy of a load.

473
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:06,726
Uh, we were mostly gonna play the new CD.
We really need the publicity...

474
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:08,732
"Boil That Cabbage Down"?

475
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:13,890
One of my favorites. I loved it!
I thought love was only true in fairy tales.

476
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,700
Meant for someone else,
but not for me.

477
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,116
That's "I'm a Believer".

478
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:19,492
Uh, love was out to get me.

479
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:20,652
Da-doo dat, da-doo.

480
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:21,628
Somewhere else it seemed.

481
00:31:21,828 --> 00:31:22,708
Da-doo dat, da-doo.

482
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:25,068
Up the river without a clue.

483
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:27,701
We really need to promote this new CD.

484
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:30,192
Thanks for joining me.
You know, ever since I invented

485
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:32,424
my new non-stick cookware
and psychic make-up,

486
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,444
I've been getting more
endorsements than I can count.

487
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:37,720
Today, my guests are Davy Jones of
The Monkees and Martha Stewart.

488
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:42,391
Davy, how long have you been using my new
psychic make-up and con-stick nookvare?

489
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,136
We have a new record out.

490
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:44,943
I beg your pardon?

491
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:47,695
Me and the guys.
We have a new CD.

492
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:51,642
And Martha, when did you notice cheese
wouldn't stick to your eyebrows when...

493
00:31:51,842 --> 00:31:53,351
are you really Martha Stewart?

494
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:55,136
Yeah!

495
00:31:55,336 --> 00:31:58,279
Well, how do you make a wedding gown
out of whipped cream frosting?

496
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:01,127
Well, uh, it depends on the flavor.

497
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:04,377
We have a new record out.

498
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:06,551
Does it have "Boil Thatâ-"

499
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:10,306
No, no, see, really, that,
that's "I'm a Believer".

500
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:13,990
The new record is, well...
well, it's new. Uh...

501
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,784
How old are you?

502
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:20,619
I don't know. Oh, but tonight, you are
gonna play the hits, aren't you?

503
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:30,320
<i>Hot dogs, get your hot dogs, peanuts,
popcorn, hot dogs, game starting, hot dog.</i>

504
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,472
Well, I suppose we could
play a couple of them, yes.

505
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:35,728
And will Mike wear... the hat?

506
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:39,229
The hat?
Um... oh, maybe.

507
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:43,096
Dear!

508
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,708
Don't worry, that's just
some old library film footage.

509
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:48,510
You see, money is a little tight.

510
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:54,697
Uh, and the show, it's about
to start, so, I better go.

511
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:59,728
I just think there's so
much more we could do.

512
00:32:59,928 --> 00:33:03,426
I mean, think about it: television!
The possibilities are endless!

513
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:05,195
What, do the news in interpretive dance?

514
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:06,587
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea!

515
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:08,875
Dateline Cairo, home of the-

516
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:11,404
Mike, Mike?
Are you wearing the hat tonight?

517
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:14,964
The hat? The woolhat?

518
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:17,627
Davy, I haven't seen that
hat in twenty-five years.

519
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:19,971
Have you got any other kind of hat?

520
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:22,521
Well, yeah, I got a baseball hat,

521
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:24,655
but if I wear it with this outfit,
I'll scare everybody.

522
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:28,331
I'll look like a cross between a
serial killer and Steven Spielberg.

523
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:29,555
Or Forrest Gump.

524
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:31,075
Uh! Even scarier!

525
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:35,435
Life is like a box of chocolates.

526
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:39,429
Please, please, just for tonight?
Look, I told the princess that you would.

527
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:44,031
And that we'd play some of our hits.
Otherwise, her father may...

528
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:48,131
...lose the club!

529
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:52,066
David, that's just another gimmick.
A trick to get us to do a storyline.

530
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:56,539
Really? But she had stars in her eyes!

531
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:59,020
Yeah, and raisins and grapefruits and the

532
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,724
international symbol
for "slippery when wet".

533
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:07,083
Oh, hey, look. Ha ha! Hey, how you doing?

534
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:12,963
What? Huh?
What? Ha ha ha.

535
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:18,139
No, no, I can't do that.
No. Oh, alright, alright.

536
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,684
Okay. Okay, okay,
here we go. Ready?

537
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:29,355
Do that again.

538
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:30,603
- What?
- You know.

539
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,417
You mean this?

540
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:37,739
That confetti's a special effect, isn't it?

541
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:38,251
Yeah.

542
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,156
It's not throw-up.

543
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:40,394
Nope.

544
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:42,468
That's why we keep running
out of production money and

545
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:44,507
having to cut to a lizard
sunning itself on a rock.

546
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,721
I keep having this trouble.
Every time I come up with a neat idea,

547
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:51,183
I keep getting this weird side effect,
I don't- here he is.

548
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,160
Ladies and gentlemen.

549
00:34:57,537 --> 00:34:59,335
Could I have your attention please?

550
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:00,484
And me. Me too!

551
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,697
Of course, you too... princess.

552
00:35:03,814 --> 00:35:08,034
If I say the name "The Monkees",
what do you think of?

553
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:13,626
Yeah, so do I. Okay,
we won't go there tonight.

554
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:15,873
How many of you remember
going to school with

555
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,166
your Monkees lunchbox
and getting beaten up?

556
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,535
All of you? It was quite a
weapon though, wasn't it?

557
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,403
I personally thought
the fingerpuppets were

558
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:28,614
just a little on the strange side,
but you know.

559
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:30,392
Forgive and forget.
Water under the bridge.

560
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:34,393
But tonight, singing from their brave
new record, some songs that you...

561
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:35,062
probably won't recognize...

562
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:39,300
along with some of their greatest hits
that you've come to know and love.

563
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,907
Arlo and Charlie,
Humphrey and Bing, also known as

564
00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:47,811
Davy, Micky, Mike,
and Peter, it's The Monkees!

565
00:35:53,883 --> 00:35:59,211
<i>Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station</i>

566
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:04,234
<i>You can be here by four thirty
'Cause I made your reservation</i>

567
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:09,115
<i>Don't be slow,
oh, no, no, no!</i>

568
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:11,655
<i>Oh, no, no, no!</i>

569
00:36:11,855 --> 00:36:16,756
<i>Just I'm leavin' in the morning
And I must see you again</i>

570
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:21,652
<i>We'll have one more night together
'Til the morning brings my train</i>

571
00:36:21,852 --> 00:36:28,458
<i>And I must go, oh, no, no, no!
Oh, no, no, no!</i>

572
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:32,921
<i>And I don't know if
I'm ever coming home</i>

573
00:36:38,511 --> 00:36:42,075
<i>Oh, I could hide
'neath the wings</i>

574
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:47,486
<i>Of the bluebird as she sings</i>

575
00:36:47,686 --> 00:36:53,972
<i>The six o'clock alarm
would never ring</i>

576
00:36:54,372 --> 00:36:58,021
<i>But six rings, and I rise</i>

577
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:02,682
<i>Wipe the sleep
out of my eyes</i>

578
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:07,680
<i>My shaving razor's cold,
and it stings</i>

579
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:14,049
<i>Cheer up, Sleepy Jean</i>

580
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:17,126
<i>Oh, what can it mean</i>

581
00:37:17,326 --> 00:37:20,422
<i>To a daydream believer</i>

582
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:27,727
<i>And a homecoming queen?</i>

583
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:31,581
<i>Cheer up, Sleepy Jean</i>

584
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:34,590
<i>Oh, what can it mean</i>

585
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,421
<i>To a daydream believer</i>

586
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:42,775
<i>And a homecoming queen?</i>

587
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:07,400
<i>I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone</i>

588
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:14,549
<i>I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone</i>

589
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:18,056
<i>You're making your
mark in society</i>

590
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:20,920
<i>Using all the tricks that
you used on me</i>

591
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,777
<i>All them high
fashion magazines</i>

592
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:29,300
<i>The clothes you're wearin',
girl, are causing public scenes</i>

593
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,624
<i>I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone</i>

594
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,137
<i>Not your steppin' stone</i>

595
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:45,756
<i>I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone</i>

596
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:48,113
<i>Not your steppin' stone</i>

597
00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:57,112
<i>I thought love was only
true in fairytales</i>

598
00:38:57,312 --> 00:39:01,442
<i>Meant for someone
else but not for me</i>

599
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:06,575
<i>Love was out to get me</i>

600
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:09,687
<i>That's the way it seemed</i>

601
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:13,722
<i>Disappointment haunted
all my dreams</i>

602
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:19,776
<i>Then I saw her face,
now I'm a believer</i>

603
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:25,837
<i>Not a trace of
doubt in my mind</i>

604
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:29,998
<i>I'm in love, I'm a believer</i>

605
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:33,241
<i>I couldn't leave her if I tried</i>

606
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:55,143
<i>The local rock group
down the street</i>

607
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:58,057
<i>Is trying hard to
learn their song</i>

608
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:02,887
<i>They serenade the
weekend squire</i>

609
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:05,696
<i>Who just came out
to mow his lawn</i>

610
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,034
<i>- Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
- Sunday</i>

611
00:40:14,234 --> 00:40:18,858
<i>Charcoal burnin' everywhere</i>

612
00:40:19,058 --> 00:40:24,125
<i>Rows of houses that
are all the same</i>

613
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:27,136
<i>And no one seems to care</i>

614
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:57,249
<i>- Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
- Sunday</i>

615
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:02,236
<i>Charcoal burnin' everywhere</i>

616
00:41:02,436 --> 00:41:07,932
<i>Another Pleasant Valley Sunday</i>

617
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,079
<i>Here in status symbol land</i>

618
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:24,581
<i>- Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
- Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday</i>

619
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:29,756
<i>- Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
- Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday</i>

620
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:36,811
<i>- Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
- Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday</i>

621
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:14,502
Well, you fellas certainly are pros.
A happy ending, and no story!

622
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:16,801
I get my lease renewed
for ninety-nine years,

623
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,052
and there's absolutely no dialog about it.

624
00:42:19,272 --> 00:42:21,555
There are no stupid chases,
there are no silly

625
00:42:21,755 --> 00:42:27,037
scenes of exposition,
just stacks of goofy jokes and-

626
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:30,146
silly special effects.
Thanks to you.

627
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:32,485
And it was a dream come
true for me as well,

628
00:42:32,685 --> 00:42:34,922
to see the four of you
all together like this.

629
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:38,834
Even though you're all grown up,
you're just as stupid as you ever were.

630
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:39,475
Hoo!

631
00:42:39,675 --> 00:42:42,114
Oh, and Davy?
I found out how old I am.

632
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:45,034
Oh, really? How old?

633
00:42:45,234 --> 00:42:46,747
...I forgot.

634
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:50,290
What a maroon.
Heh heh heh heh heh.

635
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,754
You guys mind if I play with this?

636
00:42:51,954 --> 00:42:53,474
Go ahead.

637
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:56,075
So what episode was that?
Seven hundred and eighty-one, or...?

638
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:58,377
Yeah. Seven hundred and eighty-one.

639
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:01,545
I wonder if the general public knows
that TV shows like ours never die,

640
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,714
that they just go on and on,
even though they're not being broadcast.

641
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:09,242
The princess does. She's still watching
new episodes of The Flying Nun.

642
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:18,115
And Charlie's Angels,
and M*A*S*H and Cheers and...

643
00:43:18,315 --> 00:43:19,570
..whoa.

644
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,377
Holy smokes.

645
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,739
They papered the house.

646
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:45,394
You know?
It doesn't look half bad.

647
00:43:45,594 --> 00:43:47,003
Well, might as well finish it off!

648
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:50,419
End the show? 'Cause this will finish up the
rest of the production budget, right?

649
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:51,107
Yeah.

650
00:43:51,307 --> 00:43:54,618
Well, it's as good a place as any.
Endings are always hard.

651
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:55,697
So?

652
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:56,529
Okay.

653
00:43:56,729 --> 00:43:58,735
Here goes!
