1
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,023
Now, let me run this by you
one more time real slow

2
00:01:57,024 --> 00:02:00,526
so you can understand it.
If you rent a piece of equipment,

3
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:02,493
you are liable for it
if you bust it.

4
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:06,030
I don't think I'm responsible for faulty
equipment. The thing just flew apart.

5
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,033
I didn't rent it to you
to bust up a building.

6
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,034
It's none of your business
what I rented it for.

7
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,002
I paid good money. I'm the customer,
and I'm not being treated like one.

8
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:16,039
It damn well is my business.
I own this place,

9
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:17,505
and every piece
of equipment in it.

10
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,507
And you ain't gonna cost me
any money, by God. Yes, ma'am.

11
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:24,510
Where'd you say you were
from again? Wisconsin.

12
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,547
Wisconsin? There's
your trouble, Junior.

13
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:31,015
I've never seen a damn yankee yet
could operate more than a wheelbarrow.

14
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,053
I paid the rental,
and that's all I'm paying.

15
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:38,056
Earl, it's aunt Ruby on the phone.
Tell her I'll call her back.

16
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,558
It's about granny.
She's fixing to...

17
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,526
it's almost time.

18
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:46,563
Oh. Come on, daddy.
Let's go to the house.

19
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:49,013
Lock up, Sonny.
Where you going? Let's get this settled.

20
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,198
We're closing up.
I got things to take care of

21
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,384
- besides hoohahing with you. - Well,
I'm not leaving until we get it settled.

22
00:02:56,606 --> 00:02:59,073
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

23
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:03,077
You better sign something
saying I'm not responsible.

24
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,581
You comin'? I'm locking this door. I'm
not leaving till you sign something.

25
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:13,084
Very funny.

26
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:17,089
Hey.

27
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,092
Hey!
Unlock this door!

28
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:25,094
Hear me?

29
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:26,596
Hey!

30
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:32,100
Hey! Get back here!

31
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:07,129
She's been talking
out of her head, Earl.

32
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,131
She's been calling for you.

33
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,633
All right.

34
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:21,139
Mama.

35
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,648
Why don't you make some
coffee or something?

36
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:33,650
That crying ain't helping any.

37
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,653
Carrie, how you feeling?

38
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:39,922
Tolerable, I reckon.

39
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:42,157
How you all doin'?

40
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,160
I'm kind of down in my back,

41
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,931
but I reckon I'll do.
You want me to get you

42
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,629
something or other to eat?

43
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:54,667
Naw. I don't feel much
like eatin' nothin'.

44
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:59,671
I seen your daddy today,
Sonny.

45
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:03,675
Daddy's dead, granny.
No, he ain't no such a thing.

46
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:05,677
He's out there in the back,

47
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:08,679
building me a little ol' shed

48
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:10,180
to keep things in.

49
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:14,184
Carrie, I'm gonna get
me some coffee.

50
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:16,151
You want some?

51
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:19,187
No. I don't believe I do.

52
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,190
I been kinda thinking

53
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:25,693
about going to church sunday.

54
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,194
You want to?

55
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:30,197
All right.

56
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:33,197
Good.
Well, we'll do that.

57
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:46,210
Reckon why your daddy's
playing I'm all right?

58
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,712
You are all right, mama.
Doctor says you're liable

59
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:53,215
to live to be 100.
Said you're too ornery to die yet.

60
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:56,683
You're having a spell, that's all.

61
00:05:56,718 --> 00:06:00,220
You never was too good
at storyin', Junior.

62
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:02,188
I'm 85 years old.

63
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:04,725
That's plenty of stayin' alive to do.

64
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:09,229
You take care of things, Earl.

65
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,196
You do things right.
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:16,733
I don't want you laying here
some of these days like me

67
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:20,736
wishing you'd done different.
You done real good, mama.

68
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:23,704
Real good.

69
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:26,742
You take care of
your family, Earl.

70
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:30,745
Yes, ma'am.
Use my memory to help you do that.

71
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:34,713
I always do. That's the first
thing. I always take care.

72
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:36,249
That's what you taught me.

73
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:44,722
I had a dream.

74
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:48,726
I was hanging a load of wash

75
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:51,762
on a tree limb down by the river.

76
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,766
Ain't that the silliest thing?

77
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,294
Earl.
Sheriff just called.

78
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:33,296
He said some man
called him from the store,

79
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,298
hollering you'd locked him
up inside of it.

80
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:40,267
Hey, daddy. What's going on?
I bought you a new cap today.

81
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,804
It says "Hunters do it
with both barrels. "

82
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,307
Well, she's gone.
Mama's gone.

83
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:49,810
Gone to heaven.

84
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:56,815
So you better call
whoever you're supposed to call, Ruby,

85
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,316
to take care of it.

86
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,322
When's that coffee
gonna be ready?

87
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,859
And when Jesus
came to the place

88
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:52,360
where Lazarus was buried,

89
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,328
Martha said unto him,

90
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:57,114
"Lord, if you had been here,

91
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,866
"my brother would not have died.

92
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,833
"But even now I know

93
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:05,371
God will give you whatever
you ask him. "

94
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:08,373
Jesus said unto her,

95
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:12,877
"Your brother will rise again. "

96
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:36,397
How about you, reverend?
What are you doin' over this way?

97
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:39,398
Earl, how you doing?
Fine.

98
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,366
Come on in.
What can I do for you?

99
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:46,370
Listen, I got this letter your
mama gave me before she passed.

100
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:49,407
She wanted me
to wait a few days

101
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:52,375
and then give it to you.
What is it?

102
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,913
Well, I hadn't looked at it,
and she didn't tell me.

103
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:58,915
She just told me
to give it to you

104
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,416
and not anybody else.

105
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:06,422
"It's private," she said.
Thank you.

106
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:10,422
Well, I better go.
I got rounds to make.

107
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:13,426
Roy Bailey's in the hospital
with his gall bladder,

108
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,929
and I got to see him.
I'll see you later on, then.

109
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,430
Sunday.
I'll see you sunday.

110
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:22,432
Well, we'll see.
See ya.

111
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:09,972
Daddy?

112
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:13,975
Daddy, turn that thing off.

113
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:19,981
It's gonna be a hot one, Junior.

114
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:22,733
Brother Conners just
brought me this letter

115
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:24,984
that mama wrote to me
before she passed.

116
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,987
A letter?
From your mama?

117
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:31,490
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna read it to you.

118
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,493
It says, "Dear Earl...
"when you read this letter,

119
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:38,996
"I pray I'll be in heaven
with our dear Lord

120
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,963
"if he's willing to have me there.

121
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:42,999
"I done it this way because
I could not face you

122
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:45,518
"to tell you this thing
I need to tell you.

123
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,779
"I guess I could've
not told you at all,

124
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:50,005
"but I could not take
this to my grave.

125
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,507
"Before I write this thing
to you, "I want you to know

126
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:57,477
"that I've loved and always loved
you, "and your daddy loves you, too.

127
00:11:57,512 --> 00:11:59,479
"You always heard you
was born in Alabama

128
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:02,517
"because I went there to
stay with my sick cousin.

129
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:06,518
"It hurts me to tell you this,
"but that is not the truth of things.

130
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:09,985
"We had a colored woman named
Willa Mae "that worked for us.

131
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,987
"She was a real nice woman.

132
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,523
"She used to sit and
talk with me a lot.

133
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:17,527
"I couldn't really have
a colored friend in town,

134
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:20,995
"but in the house, nobody knew
about it. "She was real smart

135
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,282
"and believed in the good Lord.

136
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:25,533
"She cried one day and told me

137
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:28,035
"that your daddy had
been with her a while back,

138
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,002
"but she didn't want to.

139
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:33,040
"She said she was scared
of him and scared not to.

140
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:37,009
"I was mad at her for a while
and mad at your daddy,

141
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,513
"but he said he didn't do it,
"and I believed him against her

142
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:42,515
"until she come up pregnant.

143
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:46,018
"He had to come up with
the truth because...

144
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,018
she had a white baby. "

145
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,022
"Now... "

146
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:56,024
Hmm... sheesh.

147
00:12:56,025 --> 00:13:00,029
"Willa Mae is your real
mama by blood, Earl.

148
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:04,031
"You come up looking white,
so nobody knew the difference. "

149
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,533
Isn't that cute?

150
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:11,037
"But I always loved you
as my own, Earl.

151
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:13,504
"Please forgive me.

152
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,507
"If you do, I have a wish
for you to do for me.

153
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,545
"Willa Mae had another boy
before you named Raymond.

154
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,513
"Raymond Lee Murdock.
"They called him point

155
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:26,516
"'cause when he was little,
he had a pointy head.

156
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:30,051
Willa Mae was my friend,
and Raymond was your brother. "

157
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:34,055
"That whole family
was good people to us,

158
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,023
"and they are your family,

159
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:39,060
"and if you don't ever have
another thought about me

160
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,527
"or look at my picture
or anything,

161
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:44,565
"I wish the one thing
you would do for me

162
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,568
"is to find your brother
and know him as your family. "

163
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:56,074
Hmm.

164
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:00,577
"Willa Mae died having you.
I was right there. "

165
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:07,049
Oh, Lord.

166
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:10,584
"She told me that after
you come into this world

167
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:13,587
"that you was beautiful
"and that she loved you...

168

"and that she loved you.
"The last I heard,

"Raymond was in Chicago

"I will always, for eternity,

00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,098
"love you as my son.
Mama. "

172
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,602
Now, daddy, mama's mind was
going at the end, wasn't it?

173
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:35,105
I mean, this is all just
a bunch of crazy stuff

174
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:38,108
she dreamed up.
I mean, did you...

175
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:41,111
Did you lie in bed
with a nigger woman?

176
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:47,582
Go ahead and cry
your damn eyes out

177
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:51,618
'cause I wanna know
who my real mama is.

178
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:55,587
Is she colored, or is she white?
It's a mess, daddy.

179
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:58,124
Now, you lied to me
for many years.

180
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,376
You're a sorry son of a bitch.

181
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:02,627
I love you, but you're sorry.

182
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:05,129
And this is a mess.
I...

183
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,133
I mean to tell you this is a mess.

184
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,154
So I hardly walk in the door,

185
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:38,657
and I find out David has
called a big meeting.

186
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:42,161
And you know how in love David
is with meetings. So, the deal is,

187
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:46,163
they put in a new computer
system without telling anybody,

188
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:49,167
and then they expect us
to learn it in five minutes.

189
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:52,170
I swear, I'm just about
fed up with that place.

190
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:56,172
Better not quit that job.
Jobs don't grow on trees around here.

191
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:59,139
Who said anything about
quitting, daddy? I was just...

192
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:02,177
complaining.
That's about all you do.

193
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,148
Where's papaw at?
He went to bed already.

194
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:13,186
Said he was feeling
all wore out, poor thing.

195
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:17,187
I wasn't complaining, daddy.
I was just talking about my day.

196
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:23,159
What's the matter with
you, anyways? Nothing.

197
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:25,695
Just trying to eat
my supper in peace.

198
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,698
That's all.
Ha.

199
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,211
You blue-eyed nigger.

200
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:56,720
Where...
Where are my blue britches?

201
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:59,220
In front of your nose.

202
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,189
Earl, what on earth
are you doing?

203
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:05,227
I told you, I'm taking
a couple days off.

204
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:08,194
I ain't had a vacation
or been anywhere

205
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:11,231
since that cousin of yours
married that chiropractor

206
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,698
over there in Shreveport.
Here.

207
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:16,235
Gimme these.
You're gonna wrinkle 'em.

208
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:18,702
Where are you going?

209
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,703
Well, I don't know exactly.

210
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:23,741
I'm gonna take my
fishing pole with me,

211
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:26,744
and maybe I'll do some
fishing somewhere.

212
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:29,497
What about the shop?

213
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,748
Sonny will take care.

214
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:33,750
Earl...

215
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:38,755
This is about your mama, isn't it?

216
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,757
Yeah, Ruby, I guess it is.

217
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,260
It's about mama, yeah.

218
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,781
Sorry.

219
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:57,318
Chicago, yeah.

220
00:19:57,818 --> 00:20:00,320
Do you have a listing for
a Raymond Murdock?

221
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:03,822
It might be listed under
Raymond Lee.

222
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:07,575
No, ma'am, I don't have a street.

223
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,969
Well, how many Raymonds
are there?

224
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:12,329
Hell, shit, give me all of them.

225
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,298
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.
Thank you, sir.

226
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:20,337
Uh, yes, sir, is this Raymond Murdock?

227
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:24,340
Well, now, are you
the Raymond Murdock

228
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,342
on the police force?
You're not.

229
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,389
How you doin' today?

230
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:32,860
Doin' all right.
Can I help you?

231
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:35,397
Where's the main police
station at around here?

232
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:38,900
There's a bunch of main police
stations. Which one you looking for?

233
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,903
I'm not real sure.

234
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,409
You the guy looking
for Raymond Murdock?

235
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,412
Yes, sir. I understand he's
a policeman or used to be.

236
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,915
He works downtown
at the mayor's office.

237
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:32,909
Pardon me. You know where I
can find the mayor's office?

238
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:36,413
Do you have an appointment?
I don't wanna see the mayor.

239
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:39,416
I'm looking for a policeman named
Raymond Lee Murdock. Ray Murdock?

240
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:41,917
He's right over there
in that snack bar.

241
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:44,452
He just went in there
with three other old men

242
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:46,454
to tell lies and drink coffee.

243
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:48,956
He's already been out here
lying to me this morning.

244
00:22:49,457 --> 00:22:51,958
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

245
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:12,976
Can we do something
for you, sir?

246
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:14,943
Are you Raymond Murdock?

247
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,981
Does he owe you money
or know your wife?

248
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,948
No, sir, he don't.

249
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,734
Well, then I'm
R- R- Ray Murdock.

250
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,486
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

251
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,990
Go ahead. I mean somewhere
else besides here?

252
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:32,742
I'm on my break now.
What's it got to do with?

253
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:34,994
Well, it's a personal thing.

254
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:36,996
It's a family thing.

255
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,502
Be right back.
Ok, now.

256
00:23:58,013 --> 00:24:00,981
I don't really know where
to start telling you this.

257
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:04,983
Just start moving your mouth and
see what comes out. Yeah, well...

258
00:24:05,018 --> 00:24:09,522
You're the Ray Murdock
from Arkansas, ain't ya?

259
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:10,524
That's right.

260
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:16,027
My name's Earl Pilcher.

261
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:24,000
I know who you are.

262
00:24:24,035 --> 00:24:26,036
What do you want from me?

263
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:29,039
How'd you know who I was?
I just know.

264
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,006
what do you want from me?

265
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,542
My mother wanted me
to look you up.

266
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:35,544
Are you trying to be funny?

267
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,547
No, no, not at all. No, sir.
See, my mother just passed on

268
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:43,576
four or five days ago,
and she left me a letter...

269
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:47,553
Crazy story about you and me
and your mama and my daddy

270
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,019
and some stuff.

271
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,057
Now, I don't know
why she wanted me

272
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:54,558
to look you up, but she did.

273
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,310
So I did.
I know the story.

274
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:59,027
I know all about it.

275
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,814
I know all about
your sorry-ass daddy.

276
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:04,567
Why'd you think
I'd want to see you?

277
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:07,069
Like I said,
I did it for my mama.

278
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:11,073
And if I was you, I wouldn't talk
about my daddy that way.

279
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:13,574
If you were me,
I think you would.

280
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:15,577
I see, I see.

281
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:20,581
I'd like some questions answered.

282
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,836
Look, I'm working now.
I get off for lunch at 1:00.

283
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:29,980
If you wanna talk for a minute,

284
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:32,303
Then meet me at the luncheonette.

285
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:34,591
It's r-r-right around the corner

286
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:37,593
to the right as you go out the door.

287
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:39,560
1:00.

288
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:42,097
Then you can go back
to Arkansas.

289
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:44,099
That's what I plan on doing.

290
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:27,135
So, what do you need to know?

291
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,636
Looks like your mama

292
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:31,638
did a pretty good job of telling it.

293
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,641
Guess I just had
to see for myself,

294
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:37,142
or needed to see for myself.

295
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:41,145
See what, your nigger brother?

296
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:50,153
Seems like your mama was a...

297
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:51,653
pretty good woman.

298
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:55,157
She was.

299
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,662
Sweetheart?

300
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,664
You know...

301
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,132
I learned to live my life

302
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,670
and pretty much put this
in the back of my mind,

303
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,673
and I lived pretty happy,
I gotta say.

304
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,640
Now you come along

305
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,177
and bring it back to
the front of my mind.

306
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,679
You feel better, Mr. Pilcher?

307
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:25,681
It's all true, every word of it.

308
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:28,184
Now you can go back
to Arkansas knowing.

309
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:31,437
Hope I've helped you out.
that gonna be it, Ray?

310
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:33,153
Yeah, Jackie, thank you.

311
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:35,689
One thing I learned
out of all this

312
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,191
is that blood don't mean shit.

313
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:42,195
I'm not your brother, Mr. Pilcher.

314
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:46,699
What happened to our
family was wrong.

315
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,968
You were born out of wrong.

316
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:51,168
You have to live with that.

317
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:54,705
At least my conscience is clear.

318
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,709
I used to hope your daddy
would burn in hell.

319
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,210
Now I don't waste
my time and energy

320
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,211
giving him a thought.

321
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:04,712
Coffee's on me.

322
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:07,215
When I look at you, I see him,

323
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,717
and I can't look at you anymore.

324
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:19,726
What's so damn funny?

325
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:24,229
How's it feel, Mr. Pilcher?

326
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:26,731
How does what feel?

327
00:28:26,732 --> 00:28:28,734
Being colored.

328
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,262
Hey, man, you look like
your truck, boy?

329
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:07,229
Yeah.

330
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:10,767
Where'd you get that redneck truck from?
Arkansas, down in God's country.

331
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:14,271
God's country, huh?
You in God's country right now, boy.

332
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:18,274
# Yodel-lay-hee-o
Yodel-lodel- layee-doo

333
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:20,776
What?
# Yodel-layee-o, yodel-layee-o

334
00:29:20,777 --> 00:29:24,243
# I laid your ol' lady, too
I laid your ol' lady, too #

335
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:28,246
Hey, homes, you know where
you're at, man? Had your mama.

336
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:31,784
That supposed to be funny?
Had your mama, you hear?

337
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:35,788
Hey, bag it!
What you wanna do, huh?

338
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:38,289
Huh? Pull over!

339
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:52,802
Whoa!

340
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,776
What's going on, fellas,
can't drive?

341
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:07,779
Need a seeing-eye dog?
Whazzup?

342
00:30:07,814 --> 00:30:09,279
You got your keys
in this truck?

343
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:12,783
None of your damn business where
I got the keys. You got insurance?

344
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:16,321
Who's gonna pay for this?
Kiss my ass. I need your wallet.

345
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,789
Give me the goddamn wallet.
You heard what he said.

346
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:23,327
Shoot him. I'll fix your ass.
I'm gonna shoot your ass.

347
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:26,294
Shoot him!
Come on!

348
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:27,830
Gimme your wallet!

349
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,297
Come on!
Get up now!

350
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:34,335
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go, man!

351
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,382
He was pretty out of it
when they brought him in.

352
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:35,384
He didn't have any I.D. on him,

353
00:31:35,885 --> 00:31:39,280
but we found this in his pocket.
That's you... Raymond Murdock?

354
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:42,891
Well, yes, ma'am, yes, it is.
Are you his responsible party?

355
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:45,358
For his bills, I mean.
Mo, ma'am. Listen...

356
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:48,895
what kind of credit card
do you have, sir?

357
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:51,864
So he's not too bad off, then?
He's ok to leave?

358
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:53,364
There's no reason to admit him,

359
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,402
but he's in no shape to
travel for a day or two,

360
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:59,370
certainly not to Arkansas.
Couldn't you keep him here

361
00:31:59,405 --> 00:32:01,906
until he's r- r-ready to travel?

362
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:05,374
U mean, for observation or whatever.
Isn't that what you do?

363
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,376
Or until his family
comes to get him?

364
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:09,912
We can't keep him here.
This place is full.

365
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:13,916
Like i said, he'll be fine. He shouldn't
go to sleep for10 or 12 hours

366
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:14,917
because of the concussion.

367
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:19,386
By the way, he refused to let his family
know where he is. Is that right?

368
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:22,924
Listen, doctor, I got to go back to work.
They'll release him in few minutes.

369
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:24,925
Just keep an eye on him for tonight,

370
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,927
and don't let him go to sleep.

371
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:41,904
This is where you live?
Yeah.

372
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:44,406
Around here.

373
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:46,942
Y'all got the same
thing in your town.

374
00:32:46,943 --> 00:32:49,444
You know... niggertown.

375
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,912
Hey, you can lend me $20

376
00:32:51,947 --> 00:32:55,915
if it ain't too much trouble.
What for?

377
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,453
For a motel room. There's
no sense in putting you out.

378
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:00,954
Shit. You can't get

379
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:04,458
a motel room in chicago for $20

380
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:07,460
unless you talking about
one of them hooker places.

381
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:09,427
That'll do.

382
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:13,465
No, someone's gotta make
sure you don't fall asleep.

383
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,985
I can take care of myself.

384
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,469
Yeah, you look like it.

385
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:46,992
You don't have to hold onto me.
I'm not crippled.

386
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:50,495
Ok, you fall down
and bust your head again.

387
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,461
Ray, who there with you?

388
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:54,998
Aunt T., I brought somebody
from work home.

389
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,466
He fell down and hurt his head.

390
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:00,001
He'll be staying here
for a little while.

391
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:06,008
What's your name, son?
It's Earl.

392
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:10,010
I won't be staying with you
just for a little bit.

393
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:12,512
Then I'm leaving,
so I won't put you out.

394
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:15,515
You ain't puttin' me out none.

395
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,017
Ray! Put him in there in my bed.

396
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:22,485
I'm sitting in here anyhow.
No, ma'am. He has got to stay awake.

397
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,022
We'll just stay out here
in the front room.

398
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,524
You go on about your business.

399
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,027
You sit on the couch over there.

400
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,532
Raymond, you not getting any
of them loud pictures again

401
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:40,034
to worry me, are you? Well,
I figure if I play something on the TV,

402
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:43,036
he'll stay up better.
Hey, everybody stay up better

403
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:46,040
with them shootin'- and-cussin'
pictures you look at.

404
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:48,507
If you going to play that mess,

405
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:52,044
I'm going in my room
and put my earphones on.

406
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:55,512
I'd rather listen to that old
crazy talk-show republican

407
00:34:55,547 --> 00:35:00,051
than that old nasty-talking,
blowing-up kind of show.

408
00:35:00,052 --> 00:35:02,553
Cook me something or other to eat.

409
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:06,522
She's a wildcat, Aunt T..
She'll be back here in a minute,

410
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:09,059
wanting to know if you
want something to eat.

411
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,561
Well, take my advice,
tell her you ain't hungry.

412
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:14,062
Ever since she went blind,

413
00:35:14,063 --> 00:35:17,531
ain't no telling what she's liable
to put in something to eat.

414
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:20,567
She'll pepper some greens
lightly with salt

415
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:24,069
till your eyeballs pop out.
One time,

416
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,073
she brushed her teeth
with preparation h.

417
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:30,576
Of course, I guess being 88,
she's lucky to have

418
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:33,043
any of her own teeth to brush.

419
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:36,080
You boys want me to fix
y'all something to eat?

420
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:39,484
Uh, no, ma'am. Thank you.
I ate not too long ago.

421
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,051
I appreciate it, though.
Don't worry about us, Aunt T.

422
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:45,588
Just go on and listen
to your r-r-radio.

423
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:50,092
Rocky!

424
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,101
Wolverines!

425
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:20,581
I'm feelin' a lot better,
so I'll call my wife

426
00:36:20,616 --> 00:36:23,118
and get her to wire
me some money

427
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,085
so I can buy a plane ticket.

428
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,588
The doctor said you wasn't fit for
traveling for another day or two.

429
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:31,626
I'll go first thing in the mornin'.

430
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:35,629
Suit yourself.
I'll leave in the morning, I said.

431
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,631
You don't have to worry about it.
I ain't worried about it.

432
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:10,623
Daddy.
Daddy!

433
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:13,160
What?
What are you doing?

434
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:15,662
Who is that white
man on the couch?

435
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:20,129
Virgil... What are you
doing waking me up?

436
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:24,668
I said, who in the hell is that
white man on the couch?

437
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:28,170
Oh. He's supposed to be there.
He came home with me.

438
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:30,673
Now, I'll tell you
about it tomorrow.

439
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:33,175
He'll be gone tomorrow.
Now let me sleep.

440
00:37:33,176 --> 00:37:36,679
Well, where am I supposed
to sleep? That's my couch.

441
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:40,180
Oh.
Get in here with me.

442
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:42,648
Uh-uh. No. no, no.

443
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:45,185
Then let me sleep, Virgil.

444
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,687
Just, he'll be gone tomorrow.

445
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:36,228
All right. Now, who's
that guy out there?

446
00:38:36,263 --> 00:38:38,194
He's an old friend of mine.

447
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:41,231
Shit. You ain't got any
old friends like that.

448
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:44,983
What do you know?
You don't know everything about me.

449
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:47,235
So, where do you know him from?

450
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:50,703
Korea. We were in the marines
together. Oh, come on.

451
00:38:50,738 --> 00:38:53,240
Don't tell me he saved your life.

452
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,743
No. As a matter of fact,
I saved his.

453
00:38:57,745 --> 00:38:59,246
So, what's he doing here?

454
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:02,248
Well, he's from down south,
and he's up here visiting,

455
00:39:02,283 --> 00:39:05,716
and he got carjacked and hit in the head.
He was carjacked?

456
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:07,252
Yeah. Some guys stole his truck.

457
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:10,256
You know how those good ol' boys
are about their trucks.

458
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:14,257
He's real tore up about it.
Oh, yeah? Well, my neck is real tore up

459
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:16,259
from sleeping in that damn bathtub.

460
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,761
He got to be out of here today.

461
00:39:18,796 --> 00:39:22,764
Virgil, this is my house,
and I'll have people stay here

462
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:24,765
if i want to.
You stay here.

463
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:28,769
Yeah, but I'm family.
Aunt T., you not eating enough.

464
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:30,270
Want some bacon?

465
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:34,274
Well, Ray, you know I don't
eat your old burnt-up bacon.

466
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:35,240
Just crispy.

467
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:39,279
Daddy, your bacon is always
a step past crispy.

468
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:41,746
Want to sit over there?
Yeah.

469
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:45,049
How you feelin' this morning?
Feel pretty good.

470
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:47,750
You up to traveling?
I'm up to it, yeah.

471
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,752
But I'm going to call my wife

472
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,755
and have her wire me up some money
so I can buy me a plane ticket.

473
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,293
Now, you won't get me in no airplane.
No, lordy.

474
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:06,300
Mornin'.

475
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:11,303
You a security guard
or something?

476
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:16,075
I'm a bus driver.
School bus?

477
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,774
For the city.

478
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:20,812
What are you doing dressed
up to go to work?

479
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:22,814
I thought you were
working nights.

480
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:25,315
They got me flip,
flopping all around

481
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,782
so I don't know night from day.

482
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:31,786
This city has no respect for
its employees. No respect.

483
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:35,789
Virgil is big on that,
r- r-respect.

484
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:39,292
You better be glad
somebody in this family is.

485
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:42,330
Well, maybe you can give me
some r-r-respect lessons

486
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:45,831
after breakfast.
Now, don't y'all start fussin' again.

487
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:48,351
Let me eat my watery eggs

488
00:40:48,386 --> 00:40:50,836
and burnt-up toast in peace.

489
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,342
So, daddy says you all were
in the marines together

490
00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:01,346
and he saved your life in Korea.

491
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:05,315
Well, I was in Korea,

492
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,350
but I wasn't in the marines.
I was in the navy.

493
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,620
Well, so how'd you save his life?

494
00:41:11,655 --> 00:41:14,856
Well, it's what you call a...

495
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:17,356
A long story.

496
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:21,861
Well, I'd like to kind of
hear it again myself.

497
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:22,862
Well...

498
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:27,365
Virgil, would you get that?

499
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,337
Hello.

500
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:37,839
Hi, Ann. how ya doin'?
Uh-huh.

501
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:41,377
Well, I thought I'd take them
to grant park,

502
00:41:41,378 --> 00:41:43,880
have a picnic or something.

503
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:46,382
Well, yeah. We can meet there.

504
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:48,348
Ok. Bye.

505
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:51,851
Is Ann bringing the girls
over tomorrow? Yeah.

506
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:55,389
Virgil has got the most
beautiful children.

507
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:56,890
Daughters, huh?

508
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,393
I got a daughter.
Oh, boy.

509
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,396
It's a real responsibility,
isn't it, having kids?

510
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:05,363
Yeah, it is.

511
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:08,898
All right, now, don't start
that shit again. I mean it.

512
00:42:08,933 --> 00:42:11,901
What shit? What are
you talking about?

513
00:42:13,403 --> 00:42:14,904
I'm going to work.

514
00:42:16,906 --> 00:42:20,408
What are you going to do?
It's like talking to a wall.

515
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:23,411
Well, I know what I'm going to do.

516
00:42:23,412 --> 00:42:25,414
I'm going to get in that kitchen

517
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:28,166
and cook me up some oatmeal.

518
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:30,416
Feed this stuff to the cat...

519
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,419
If I had me a cat.

520
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:37,422
You think the police
will find my truck?

521
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:41,426
They may find it.
May not be much left of it.

522
00:42:41,461 --> 00:42:43,428
Shoot. Damn.

523
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,932
Well...
Have a good trip.

524
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:51,433
Yeah. Thanks.
And, uh...

525
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:53,936
Thanks for saving
my life in Korea.

526
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:56,904
Well...

527
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:59,441
Virgil just wouldn't
understand about you.

528
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:01,943
I can understand that.

529
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:06,446
Were you really in Korea?

530
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:08,949
Oh, hell, yeah. I was
on the Philippine Sea.

531
00:43:08,984 --> 00:43:10,450
That's an aircraft carrier.

532
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:13,452
When were you there?

533
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:15,918
Oh, '51, '52.

534
00:43:15,953 --> 00:43:17,955
That's when I was there.

535
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,457
Ain't that some shit?
Yeah.

536
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:26,462
Good luck.

537
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:31,966
Tip your hat to Dixie for me.

538
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:34,468
Yeah. I'll do that.

539
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,956
Hello. It's Earl here.

540
00:44:01,991 --> 00:44:03,957
Oh, Earl.
I was looking for you.

541
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:06,494
I want you to go
to the store with me.

542
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:09,998
What for?
'Cause I'm blind as a bat.

543
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:13,001
That's what for.
Need somebody to help me.

544
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:17,969
Yes, ma'am.

545
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:20,506
Well, how you doin'
today, Aunt T.?

546
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:23,974
Well, I guess I'm doing all right.
How about yourself, Tommy?

547
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:26,977
Well, ain't no need complaining.
Won't do no good, anyway.

548
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:30,015
Son, grab one of them
plastic baskets there

549
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,268
by the end of the counter.
Let's get to gettin'.

550
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:36,518
Get a sack of cornmeal,
and get the yellow meal, now,

551
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:40,022
and right under it,
get gold medal flour.

552
00:44:40,523 --> 00:44:43,025
All-purpose, not self-rising.

553
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,991
Get two bags of cheetos.

554
00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:48,779
Get the red bags,
not that puffed-up kind.

555
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:52,533
Tommy, you can slice me up
a pound of bologna

556
00:44:52,534 --> 00:44:55,035
and half a pound of liverwurst.

557
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,536
Son, get two loaves of white bread

558
00:44:57,537 --> 00:44:59,539
and a jar of mayonnaise.

559
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:03,041
Two loaves.

560
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:05,043
One...

561
00:45:07,044 --> 00:45:09,546
Mayonnaise.

562
00:45:09,547 --> 00:45:12,549
Get two sticks of butter.
Make sure it's salted.

563
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,550
I don't know why anybody would want
to eat unsalted butter.

564
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:18,552
Might as well eat vaseline.
Don't have no flavor to it.

565
00:45:18,553 --> 00:45:21,521
That's about all I can think of.
You want anything, son?

566
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:25,076
No, ma'am. I don't need anything.
I'm leaving. Well, bring it on up there,

567
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:28,562
put it on the counter, now.
Tommy, you go ahead and ring this up.

568
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:33,066
Two loaves of bread...

569
00:45:33,101 --> 00:45:37,033
one mayonnaise.
Cheetos...

570
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,570
and salted butter, two sticks.

571
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,581
And, Tommy, I want you
to meet my nephew Earl.

572
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,582
He's up here visiting from Arkansas.

573
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,050
He's Ray's brother.

574
00:45:56,085 --> 00:45:59,586
Visiting from Arkansas?
Ray?

575
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,591
How ya doin', Earl?

576
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:08,094
Pretty good.

577
00:46:08,129 --> 00:46:12,062
You're...
Ray's brother?

578
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:15,601
Ma'am, how in the world did you
ever come up with something like that?

579
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:19,370
It's the craziest thing I ever heard of.
You must have been joking around

580
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:23,106
with your friend or something.
You might as well quit bullshitting me,

581
00:46:23,141 --> 00:46:26,074
Earl Pilcher. I know all
about your half-black ass.

582
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:30,077
Well, ma'am, I'm not trying to be
funny or nothin', but can't you see,

583
00:46:30,112 --> 00:46:33,614
it don't take no eyes to see.
Now, Ray ain't got

584
00:46:33,615 --> 00:46:37,083
no old white war buddy from Korea
I ever heard about before.

585
00:46:37,118 --> 00:46:39,119
Besides, I heard y'all in there

586
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:42,621
talking last night. I ain't deaf.
Talkin' about my cooking

587
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:45,266
and everything else,
hushin' up one another.

588
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:47,592
And you might as well
stop calling me ma'am

589
00:46:47,627 --> 00:46:51,595
and start calling me Aunt T.
'Cause I'm your Aunt T.

590
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,275
Son, I knew both your mamas,
and they was both good women.

591
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,635
Your mama Carrie had to be
to stay with that man

592
00:46:58,636 --> 00:47:02,102
and put up with his stuff
all them years.

593
00:47:02,137 --> 00:47:05,640
My sister was the sunrise
and the sunset for me.

594
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:08,143
Now, you can't help
how you was born,

595
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:10,645
and you can't help
how you was raised.

596
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:12,647
That's just the way it is,

597
00:47:12,682 --> 00:47:15,614
but I loved my sister,
and you her boy,

598
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:19,044
and so I love you, too,
and there ain't nothing

599
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,652
you can do about it.

600
00:47:20,653 --> 00:47:24,155
Well, I'd better get back
and call my wife

601
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,158
and get ready to get out of here.

602
00:47:27,193 --> 00:47:30,411
Appreciate y'all's hospitality.

603
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:32,127
Ooh, I could tell you stories

604
00:47:32,162 --> 00:47:34,664
about your mama that
would-hee hee...

605
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:36,667
I just wish I could see you

606
00:47:36,702 --> 00:47:40,135
so I could see her in you,
and I know I could.

607
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:42,670
Well, this has me
all messed up, miss T.

608
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:44,638
I don't know what to think of it.

609
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:47,676
I mean, you don't know what
it's like to, you know,

610
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,678
you're right about that.
I don't know what it's like for you.

611
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:53,680
Nobody ever knows what
it's like for somebody else.

612
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:57,147
That's always the problem.
Might do you some good

613
00:47:57,182 --> 00:48:00,185
to stay around here
for a while longer.

614
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,187
I'd sure like for you to.
I'd like to know Willa Mae's boy.

615
00:48:04,222 --> 00:48:08,156
See, you ain't fooling me.
I know why you come up here.

616
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,693
I know it probably better than you.

617
00:48:10,694 --> 00:48:12,696
You need to know
your history, son.

618
00:48:13,196 --> 00:48:16,198
Now, let's get on back
before the butter melts

619
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:19,702
and I get mad, and you don't
want to see me get mad.

620
00:48:20,202 --> 00:48:23,204
Second door to the right.

621
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:40,718
Bet you never figured you'd
lay eyes on me again.

622
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:43,470
No, I didn't.
You get robbed again?

623
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:46,222
No, nothing like that.
I just went down to Western Union,

624
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,725
get some money
my wife sent to me.

625
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,693
Just kind of in the neighborhood,
that's all.

626
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:55,229
What time your plane leave?
Well, that's the deal.

627
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,698
I got to thinkin' about my truck.
Yeah? What about it?

628
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:01,701
I got that truck paid off and all,
and I got a lot of

629
00:49:01,736 --> 00:49:03,702
personal stuff in there.
I mean, I got, like,

630
00:49:03,737 --> 00:49:06,704
a damn good rod and reel in there,
so I thought

631
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:08,741
I'd just stick around
another day or two,

632
00:49:08,776 --> 00:49:12,709
see what the police come up with.
See, if they want me to come in

633
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:14,746
and identify any suspects or anything.

634
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:17,713
I mean, if I'm down there in Arkansas,
I just got to turn around

635
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:20,751
and come right on back up here.
Yeah?

636
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,753
So, you don't think it's a bad idea

637
00:49:23,754 --> 00:49:27,721
for me to stick around
another day or two?

638
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:31,725
I mean, I don't intend to put y'all out
anymore. I got my own money.

639
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,763
I'll find me a motel
room somewhere.

640
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,766
Maybe you know
of a good one.

641
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:41,769
What do you say?

642
00:49:48,273 --> 00:49:50,774
I thought you were leaving
town this morning.

643
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:53,742
I thought I was, too.

644
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:55,528
Virgil, where are those motels

645
00:49:55,563 --> 00:49:57,922
over on that stripper street?

646
00:49:57,957 --> 00:50:01,783
You're gonna stay in a motel?
Yeah.

647
00:50:01,784 --> 00:50:03,751
Stoney Island Boulevard.

648
00:50:03,786 --> 00:50:07,754
They got a whole bunch of them
over there. Real cheap, too.

649
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:11,757
No. That's not a good neighborhood.
It's fine. He'll be fine.

650
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:15,260
Ray, get in here. I need to talk to you.
You, too, Virgil.

651
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:18,298
I'm going to take a shower.
Want to get out of these clothes.

652
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,798
I said, get in here.

653
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:31,308
God, what is that?

654
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:36,312
Ray Murdock, you not
letting that boy go out

655
00:50:36,813 --> 00:50:40,315
to any of them old hooker motels.
He's staying right here like he been doing.

656
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,817
And sleep where,
on the ceiling?

657
00:50:42,818 --> 00:50:45,821
The grandkids are coming over tomorrow.
They'll be here the whole weekend.

658
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:48,822
It don't matter who's coming.
He can't stay here. I'm tired of him.

659
00:50:48,857 --> 00:50:52,289
Shut up about it.
It ain't none of your business.

660
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:55,292
Well, I guess it is if he's sleeping,
he's a grown man.

661
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:58,295
He can take care of himself.
It's not my r- r-responsibility.

662
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,297
It's your responsibility to treat your
own people good. Your own people?

663
00:51:01,332 --> 00:51:04,585
That's your brother in there, Ray,
and you going to treat him like it.

664
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,302
Aunt T., what are
you talking about?

665
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:08,838
Don't bullshit me, Ray.
I know all about Earl Pilcher

666
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:11,839
sitting in there on that couch.
That's my sister's boy in there

667
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,307
and your brother and your uncle,

668
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:16,844
and you're not puttin'
him in the street

669
00:51:16,845 --> 00:51:19,847
with them whoremongers and
head-knockers. How did you know?

670
00:51:19,848 --> 00:51:22,849
That son of a bitch tell you? Hold on.
Wait a minute. Back up here a minute.

671
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,318
What the hell is going on here?
Now, daddy ain't got a brother.

672
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:30,321
And he's white, Aunt T. What's wrong
with you? Did he tell you?

673
00:51:30,356 --> 00:51:33,858
He ain't told me nothin'.
I'm not an old fool.

674
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:36,326
Now, tell what?
Now, god damn it,

675
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:38,328
somebody tell me
what's going on.

676
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:40,865
Don't you ever take the
name of the lord in vain

677
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:42,366
in this house.

678
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,369
Yeah, that's your own flesh
and blood sitting in there,

679
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:49,371
both of you. Now, don't shame this
family and my sister's sweet soul,

680
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:53,373
putting her little boy out in the street.
Ray, I think you need to get a backbone

681
00:51:53,874 --> 00:51:56,376
and set your son down
and tell him the truth.

682
00:51:56,411 --> 00:52:00,345
That's your daddy's half brother in there,
and if he looks white,

683
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,882
it's 'cause his daddy's white.
I don't know how he look.

684
00:52:03,883 --> 00:52:06,886
I can't see him like you can
and don't need to.

685
00:52:07,386 --> 00:52:09,887
I don't have the blessing of
being able to separate people

686
00:52:09,888 --> 00:52:11,354
by looking at them anymore.

687
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:13,890
Daddy, you straighten
this mess out fast.

688
00:52:13,891 --> 00:52:17,860
I'm going to take a shower, and when
I come out, I want that man gone,

689
00:52:17,895 --> 00:52:20,898
and I want you to tell me
what this is all about.

690
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:24,365
You don't tell me, boy.
You don't tell me what I'm going to do.

691
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,902
And it's true what she's
saying, like it or not.

692
00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:29,906
I don't want to hear it, ok?
Y'all are both cracking up.

693
00:52:30,406 --> 00:52:32,906
Now, just straighten it out.
I'm going to take a shower.

694
00:52:58,928 --> 00:53:02,897
I already drove over by Stoney Island,
and I didn't see you.

695
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:05,184
I know you didn't
have time to get far,

696
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:07,435
so I figured you were
going the wrong way.

697
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,937
I know I'm goin' the right way.
You hear me?

698
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,905
You're walking right into the bad part.
Keep going the way you're going,

699
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,442
going to get knocked in the head again,
maybe worse.

700
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,416
Listen, my son's talking
out of his ass.

701
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:30,454
It's my house, and I say
who stays and who goes.

702
00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:34,457
Between you and him, and I ain't deaf,
I heard how much I'm welcome.

703
00:53:34,492 --> 00:53:37,424
We want you to stay.
Now we got to talk, you and me.

704
00:53:37,459 --> 00:53:40,962
I don't really give a shit to talk to you.
I might as well be on Mars

705
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:43,857
as to be up here with y'all people.
What do you mean, "Y'all people"?

706
00:53:43,892 --> 00:53:45,431
Don't give me that "Black me" shit.

707
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:47,967
Get out of my way before
I knock you on your butt.

708
00:53:48,002 --> 00:53:51,970
Don't threaten me, you old fool.
Get in the car. Kiss my ass!

709
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:56,975
You get in your damn car.

710
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,983
You know, I'm trying
to be nice to you.

711
00:54:06,018 --> 00:54:09,985
You're not making it easy.
I don't aim to make it easy.

712
00:54:09,986 --> 00:54:12,989
I don't give a shit. And your
boy don't want me around,

713
00:54:13,024 --> 00:54:15,455
he can kiss my ass.
He can kiss mine, too.

714
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,457
I make the rules in my house.

715
00:54:17,492 --> 00:54:20,511
Yeah, well, you don't enforce 'em too good.
Aw, fuck you!

716
00:54:20,546 --> 00:54:23,497
Fuck you! You want
me to call the police?

717
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:30,502
No, ma'am.
We're just, uh,

718
00:54:30,537 --> 00:54:32,003
we're just talkin'.

719
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:42,476
You don't ever think anything's funny,
do you? No. Not anymore.

720
00:54:42,511 --> 00:54:44,763
I don't have a lot to laugh about.

721
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,015
Yeah, poor, pitiful black you, huh?

722
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:49,017
You got a smart mouth, don't you?

723
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:52,485
I ought to knock you on your
butt again. Yeah, sure.

724
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,523
You didn't do it the first time.
Where are you now? Look at you.

725
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,025
To hell with you.

726
00:54:59,526 --> 00:55:01,527
Ho on, then, if you so rough.

727
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:04,495
I was just trying to help you.
I don't know why.

728
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:07,533
'Cause you're scared of
your blind aunt, I guess.

729
00:55:07,568 --> 00:55:09,801
Yeah, well, go on.
Be a big man.

730
00:55:09,836 --> 00:55:12,035
I will.
I'm not afraid of you

731
00:55:12,036 --> 00:55:14,038
or any other nigger on the street.

732
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,508
I didn't mean it like that.

733
00:55:20,543 --> 00:55:23,044
There's only one way to mean it.

734
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:38,558
If you need help, don't call me.

735
00:55:38,593 --> 00:55:40,058
I'm through helping you.

736
00:55:49,066 --> 00:55:51,533
Fine with me.

737
00:55:51,568 --> 00:55:54,069
Yeah. Don't need his help.

738
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,573
He's somebody, somebody big.
Well, he can kiss my ass.

739
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:00,074
Shit.

740
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:03,542
Yeah, Pop is here.
Pop, say hello.

741
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:06,079
Aunt Frances,
guess who else is here.

742
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,083
Uncle Russell's here.
Yeah, here he is.

743
00:56:11,085 --> 00:56:12,086
Hello.

744
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:15,588
No, there's no gene here.

745
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:18,090
Ok. That's ok.

746
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:21,558
Hey, aunt Frances. Yeah.
Uh-huh.

747
00:56:21,593 --> 00:56:24,094
Yeah, uh-huh.
Oh, cousin Betty was...

748
00:56:24,095 --> 00:56:26,062
Aunt T., quit staring at me.

749
00:56:26,097 --> 00:56:30,600
Now, how am I gonna stare at you?

750
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:34,568
Uh... uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

751
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:35,604
Ah, yeah, uh-huh.

752
00:56:36,105 --> 00:56:39,107
Ray, why don't you leave
your pride on that couch

753
00:56:39,142 --> 00:56:43,109
and go find him?
I ain't studyin' that fool.

754
00:56:48,097 --> 00:56:50,064
Damned old bastard,

755
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:52,101
messing up my friday night.

756
00:56:52,136 --> 00:56:54,603
The son of a bitch.

757
00:57:12,617 --> 00:57:14,619
How you doing?

758
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,121
Hey! Hey!

759
00:57:31,133 --> 00:57:33,135
Are you the birthday girl?

760
00:57:36,636 --> 00:57:40,105
How old are you?
She's 50 today.

761
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,142
Oh, stop telling the world about it.

762
00:57:43,642 --> 00:57:47,144
I'm sure glad to find some people more
my age. I was starting to think

763
00:57:47,145 --> 00:57:49,146
that nobody but kids
went to bars around here.

764
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:53,115
Now, are you the husband?
Yes, I am.

765
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:56,153
I'm sure you're a proud man.
Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:58,619
Do you care if I, uh...

767
00:57:58,654 --> 00:58:01,406
take her for a spin
on the dance floor,

768
00:58:01,441 --> 00:58:04,158
you know, kind of
a birthday dance?

769
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,162
Uh... look, sir, we're just
trying to celebrate.

770
00:58:07,197 --> 00:58:09,628
James, it's ok.

771
00:58:09,663 --> 00:58:13,166
I'll dance with him.
Just once.

772
00:58:15,169 --> 00:58:16,170
It's your birthday.

773
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:42,190
Yeah, Frank, hi.
This is Ray Murdock.

774
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:43,656
How you doing?

775
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:47,193
Listen, I wonder if you
can do me a favor.

776
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:48,660
I'm looking for somebody.

777
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:52,197
Maybe you can just kind of
put the word out.

778
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:55,201
Yeah. White male.
Earl Pilcher. White male.

779
00:58:55,236 --> 00:58:58,669
Um, about 6'.
Last seen on foot

780
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:01,205
in the vicinity of 39th and Grand

781
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:03,708
wearing, uh, blue jeans, plaid shirt,

782
00:59:03,743 --> 00:59:05,208
and a baseball cap.

783
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:08,176
Oh, yeah, yeah. He walks
kind of bowlegged.

784
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,713
All I'm saying is that they
got all these quotas.

785
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:15,216
You got to hire blacks and women,
so it discriminates,

786
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:17,684
if I want a job as a white man,

787
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:20,722
I can't get it even if
I'm more qualified.

788
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,223
Supposin' I was, that is.

789
00:59:23,224 --> 00:59:25,190
But with me it's even worse,

790
00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:27,977
because I'm black as a
coal miner's drawers,

791
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:30,730
and I still can't get
on the quota wagon

792
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:34,697
'cause I look like a white man.
Anyhow, forget all that.

793
00:59:34,732 --> 00:59:37,234
I want to buy a round for the house

794
00:59:37,235 --> 00:59:39,702
to celebrate.

795
00:59:39,737 --> 00:59:43,239
miss, i want to buy
a round for the house.

796
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,241
where's she at?

797
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:49,744
Is everything all right over here?
Everything's fine, thank you.

798
00:59:50,245 --> 00:59:51,711
Now where'd that gal go?

799
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:54,247
I want to buy a round
for everybody.

800
00:59:54,248 --> 00:59:57,250
Do you have the money,
my friend?

801
00:59:57,285 --> 01:00:00,253
Yes, of course I got the money.

802
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:06,259
I had the money.
All right. It's time to leave, my friend.

803
01:00:06,294 --> 01:00:09,511
Let's go.
Get your goddamn hand off of me.

804
01:00:09,546 --> 01:00:11,763
It is time to leave, my friend.

805
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,772
Kiss my ass.

806
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,341
Move it!

807
01:01:54,346 --> 01:01:57,349
Get out of the way,
you son of a bitch!

808
01:03:39,432 --> 01:03:40,933
Hey, yo, man.
What's up?

809
01:03:43,935 --> 01:03:45,435
Well, all right.

810
01:03:45,436 --> 01:03:47,938
Hey, old man, you hear me
talking to you?

811
01:03:47,973 --> 01:03:50,440
You deaf or something?
I'm talking to you.

812
01:03:57,446 --> 01:04:00,949
All right.
Listen, what do you want?

813
01:04:00,984 --> 01:04:04,969
You want this? Yeah?
Ok, hold on.

814
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:06,919
You want this?

815
01:04:06,954 --> 01:04:09,456
Show me what you got, baby.

816
01:04:09,457 --> 01:04:12,960
Hold on. You want this?
Hey, yo, man. Fuck you.

817
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:16,962
Fuck you, too.

818
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,367
Hello.

819
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:48,501
Who is it, Virgil?
Hold on.

820
01:05:48,536 --> 01:05:52,039
It's a security guard
from the railroad.

821
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,542
I think he's found Earl.

822
01:06:06,051 --> 01:06:08,552
You look like something
the cat drug in.

823
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:10,520
Yeah, well...

824
01:06:10,555 --> 01:06:13,057
I...
I had a long night.

825
01:06:17,562 --> 01:06:20,562
Well, I want to apologize
for something for yesterday.

826
01:06:20,597 --> 01:06:24,564
I was out of line.
Damn right you were out of line.

827
01:06:24,565 --> 01:06:27,067
Well, I said I was, didn't I?

828
01:06:27,102 --> 01:06:29,068
Anyway, I apologize.

829
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,037
Well, I guess every man's entitled

830
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,574
to make a complete and
total fool of himself

831
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,578
every now and then.

832
01:06:38,613 --> 01:06:42,079
Yeah.

833
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,582
What the hell
you laughing about?

834
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:49,051
You're not going nuts, are you?
No, no.

835
01:06:49,086 --> 01:06:51,052
I'm all right now,

836
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:55,091
but last night I believe
I was going out of my gourd.

837
01:06:55,126 --> 01:06:58,594
I think I was hoping
I wouldn't wake up this morning,

838
01:06:58,595 --> 01:07:01,096
but I did.
I did,

839
01:07:01,596 --> 01:07:04,097
and that, I think,
means that the good Lord

840
01:07:04,598 --> 01:07:09,102
wants me to stay up here
and do what I been doing.

841
01:07:12,104 --> 01:07:14,106
You mean looking
for your truck.

842
01:07:15,608 --> 01:07:17,609
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever.

843
01:07:26,115 --> 01:07:28,617
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter!

844
01:07:28,618 --> 01:07:32,085
Hey. Wake up, Aunt T.
I ain't asleep.

845
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,123
Well, I see you're
working up an appetite.

846
01:07:35,158 --> 01:07:37,090
Bring any wings?
Oh, yeah.

847
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:40,628
You know, I only like wings.
I got the wings.

848
01:07:40,629 --> 01:07:44,146
I don't know how come you spending good
money on store-bought chicken anyhow.

849
01:07:44,181 --> 01:07:47,633
There they are, an hour late.
Now don't you start with her, Virgil.

850
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:51,637
You just mind your business.
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

851
01:07:51,672 --> 01:07:54,639
Hey.
Come here.

852
01:07:54,674 --> 01:07:57,607
Oh!
Damn, Danielle,

853
01:07:57,642 --> 01:08:01,162
You've gotten bigger since last week.
Me, too! Me, too!

854
01:08:01,197 --> 01:08:04,146
I'm too big, too.
You, too, you, too.

855
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:07,675
That hurts.
Hi, Ann.

856
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,651
Hello.

857
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:13,119
No, it didn't. I'm just kidding.
Hey!

858
01:08:13,154 --> 01:08:16,406
Sorry we're late, Ray.
You're going to sit here

859
01:08:16,441 --> 01:08:19,124
and eat with us, aren't you?
Oh, no.

860
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:21,126
This is Virgil's day
with the girls.

861
01:08:21,161 --> 01:08:24,162
Come on. Let's act like
a family for a change.

862
01:08:24,196 --> 01:08:25,662
What do you say, Virgil?

863
01:08:26,163 --> 01:08:28,226
Come on over here and
give me a great big hug.

864
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:32,169
- I don't mind. - That's settled.
Let's put the feedbags on.

865
01:08:41,678 --> 01:08:43,144
I'm Ann.

866
01:08:43,179 --> 01:08:47,146
Earl. Pleased to meet you.
Danielle,

867
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:49,683
I really like those pictures
you drew me.

868
01:08:49,684 --> 01:08:53,152
I put them up on the refrigerator.
Thank you.

869
01:08:53,187 --> 01:08:56,689
Yeah. Danielle Murdock-
famous painter.

870
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:58,657
Maybe you'll get the world

871
01:08:58,692 --> 01:09:02,195
to sit up and take notice
of you someday.

872
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:06,196
The main thing is being happy.
You don't have to go out

873
01:09:06,231 --> 01:09:07,663
and conquer the world.

874
01:09:07,698 --> 01:09:10,701
Conquering the world
kind of makes you happy.

875
01:09:10,736 --> 01:09:14,704
I know. I been there.
Virgil used to play football.

876
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:18,206
In high school, he was first team
on the parade all-america team.

877
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:21,209
Is that right?
What position?

878
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,176
Eide receiver.

879
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:27,178
Oh. I used to play a little ball.
I mean, I was small,

880
01:09:27,213 --> 01:09:30,216
but I made up for it
by being slow.

881
01:09:36,222 --> 01:09:38,223
You play college ball?

882
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:40,725
Ohio State.

883
01:09:41,226 --> 01:09:43,727
Buckeyes. Damn, that's big time.

884
01:09:43,728 --> 01:09:45,229
How'd you do there?

885
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:53,235
His freshman year,
he injured his knee.

886
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:57,238
No, no, no. I didn't just injure my knee.
I destroyed it.

887
01:09:57,739 --> 01:09:59,706
Doctor said, if I was lucky,

888
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:03,745
I might be able to walk
without a limp someday.

889
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,747
So... I guess I'm lucky.

890
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,258
Girl, you better get
out of that window

891
01:10:21,293 --> 01:10:23,760
in your pajamas.
People can see you.

892
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:26,227
I don't care.
Lay down.

893
01:10:26,262 --> 01:10:29,228
Well, you better start caring.
Come on. Get in.

894
01:10:29,263 --> 01:10:32,767
Where's my other pillow?
Here's your other pillow.

895
01:10:32,802 --> 01:10:36,770
Can't we watch TV?
No, you can't watch TV.

896
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:39,272
I'm turning the lights out.

897
01:10:44,277 --> 01:10:46,279
Those poor children.
Yeah.

898
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:51,247
Trouble between parents
is always tough on the kids.

899
01:10:51,282 --> 01:10:53,784
You know, I don't
want to say this,

900
01:10:54,285 --> 01:10:57,788
but I believe your boy's
got a chip on his shoulder.

901
01:10:57,789 --> 01:10:59,756
Yup.

902
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:03,257
Well, that ought to do you.
In the marines,

903
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:06,795
I spent many a night
on a cot like that.

904
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,798
Of course, that was
on good nights.

905
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:13,817
Here you go.
Thanks.

906
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,802
Yes, sir.

907
01:11:17,303 --> 01:11:18,304
Fine.

908
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:30,315
You see any action
over there in Korea?

909
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:33,281
Yeah.
I saw action.

910
01:11:33,316 --> 01:11:36,785
How about yourself?
Nah.

911
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:40,323
I was never really under fire.

912
01:11:40,824 --> 01:11:43,324
I was always kind of
sorry about that.

913
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,327
You didn't miss out on nothing.

914
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:51,332
You have to kill anybody?

915
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:55,334
Hmm?
I did.

916
01:11:55,835 --> 01:11:57,837
I'm not proud of it.

917
01:12:00,339 --> 01:12:01,840
You ever wounded?

918
01:12:04,843 --> 01:12:07,845
No. Aunt T. Gave me
a rabbit's foot

919
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,866
to take away with me.
Guess it worked.

920
01:12:11,901 --> 01:12:13,814
I never been hurt

921
01:12:13,849 --> 01:12:16,101
in 40 years as a cop either.

922
01:12:16,136 --> 01:12:18,495
Guess the good Lord has seen fit

923
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:20,855
to keep me out of harm's way.

924
01:12:24,858 --> 01:12:26,359
I've been blessed.

925
01:12:27,861 --> 01:12:28,862
Really blessed.

926
01:12:30,363 --> 01:12:32,865
You know, they say that...

927
01:12:32,866 --> 01:12:35,867
that nobody can
save another person.

928
01:12:35,902 --> 01:12:38,869
That's bullshit.
You can save another person

929
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:40,837
if they want to be saved,

930
01:12:40,872 --> 01:12:44,875
and I've been saved
by three people in my life.

931
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:46,842
When my mother died,

932
01:12:47,264 --> 01:12:52,313
Aunt T., she took
r- r-responsibility for me.

933
01:12:52,918 --> 01:12:55,884
And when we moved
up here to Chicago,

934
01:12:55,919 --> 01:12:58,887
she worked 16 hours a day-

935
01:12:58,922 --> 01:13:02,889
cleaning houses,
working in the laundry, whatever.

936
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:06,891
She made sure that I was never
hungry and I always had shoes.

937
01:13:06,892 --> 01:13:09,394
And she whupped me
when I was bad.

938
01:13:11,396 --> 01:13:13,363
Sh-sh-she saved me.

939
01:13:13,398 --> 01:13:16,399
And then when I got
to be a teenager,

940
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,868
I was too big to be whupped,

941
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:22,372
so I started getting into trouble.
I stole a car.

942
01:13:22,873 --> 01:13:26,340
I was a car thief.
The cops caught me

943
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:28,877
and took me before this judge,

944
01:13:28,878 --> 01:13:30,880
and the judge gave me a choice-

945
01:13:30,915 --> 01:13:33,900
prison or the military.

946
01:13:33,935 --> 01:13:36,849
So, I joined the marines,

947
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:40,887
and the marines
made a man out of me.

948
01:13:41,387 --> 01:13:44,890
Yeah. I was saved by the judge.

949
01:13:47,392 --> 01:13:49,894
Then when I got
out of the marines

950
01:13:49,895 --> 01:13:53,864
and came here to Chicago,
I brought the war with me.

951
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:56,400
Started drinking,
you know, heavy,

952
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:58,901
and didn't care
what happened to me.

953
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:00,903
Then I met my wife,

954
01:14:00,904 --> 01:14:04,406
and it was like opening
the curtain on a dark room.

955
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:07,426
The sunlight just poured in.

956
01:14:07,461 --> 01:14:10,411
I was saved again by her.

957
01:14:17,918 --> 01:14:19,418
Is she dead?

958
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:23,421
Yeah.
Eight years.

959
01:14:33,931 --> 01:14:36,433
Didn't mean to go on like that.

960
01:14:38,434 --> 01:14:41,436
I saw you wiping your old
chicken-greasy fingers

961
01:14:41,471 --> 01:14:43,403
on my shirt this afternoon.

962
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:45,940
Yeah, well, I ran out of napkins.

963
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,452
Ray, come over here.

964
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:02,953
I want to show you something.
Come on.

965
01:15:04,454 --> 01:15:07,957
You want to show me what?
Now come over here.

966
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:11,460
I ain't gonna bite you.
I ain't gonna bite you, either.

967
01:15:11,495 --> 01:15:13,963
What do you want?
Come on.

968
01:15:19,467 --> 01:15:20,433
Now, look a-there.

969
01:15:20,468 --> 01:15:23,470
I was never under fire,
but I got wounded.

970
01:15:23,505 --> 01:15:25,472
When I was a fireman
on that flattop,

971
01:15:25,973 --> 01:15:28,440
a fire broke out
in the engine room

972
01:15:28,475 --> 01:15:31,477
when I was fighting it down there one day,
and the engine blew up.

973
01:15:31,512 --> 01:15:35,402
I got this.
Yeah.

974
01:15:35,982 --> 01:15:39,450
Ain't that some shit?
You bet it is.

975
01:15:39,485 --> 01:15:41,984
I still got more metal in that leg

976
01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:45,453
than they make new cars with.
What happened there?

977
01:15:45,488 --> 01:15:49,259
You get that in the explosion, too?
This? Hell, no.

978
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:53,245
I... no, no. I...
I got this when I was a kid.

979
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,497
It's actually about my first...

980
01:15:55,532 --> 01:15:59,466
my first memory.
I was about 3 years old,

981
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:03,002
and this little ol' colored kid
threw something at me.

982
01:16:03,037 --> 01:16:07,006
It's coming back,
people of color and all that.

983
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,473
Yeah. This kid...

984
01:16:09,508 --> 01:16:12,010
hit me with a rock right there.

985
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:16,514
You were coming out of
Burk's grocery store

986
01:16:16,549 --> 01:16:18,516
on Apple street with your daddy.

987
01:16:20,017 --> 01:16:21,017
How'd you know that?

988
01:16:23,518 --> 01:16:26,020
Now, wait a minute now.
Hold on.

989
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:29,990
You see?
You never knew who I was,

990
01:16:30,025 --> 01:16:32,027
but I knew exactly who you were,

991
01:16:32,527 --> 01:16:34,493
and I hated your half-white guts.

992
01:16:34,528 --> 01:16:37,531
So when I saw you
coming out that store

993
01:16:37,566 --> 01:16:41,535
with that old daddy of yours,
I grabbed that rock, and I just...

994
01:16:42,535 --> 01:16:44,536
did what come natural.

995
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:51,543
Only bad thing is that
Aunt T. found out.

996
01:16:51,578 --> 01:16:54,045
She like to skin me alive.

997
01:16:57,048 --> 01:17:00,014
What do you mean,
"The only bad thing"?

998
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:03,551
You could have put my
damn eye out or killed me.

999
01:17:05,052 --> 01:17:06,053
Shit.

1000
01:17:07,554 --> 01:17:08,555
Shit.

1001
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:24,518
Good night.

1002
01:17:33,994 --> 01:17:37,462
Give me a kiss, huh?
Yes!

1003
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:40,499
I'll call you next week, ok?
Ok.

1004
01:17:40,999 --> 01:17:43,501
All right.
Give me a kiss.

1005
01:17:46,504 --> 01:17:47,504
Bye-bye.

1006
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:56,977
Bye.
Bye now.

1007
01:17:57,012 --> 01:17:59,013
Girls, get on in the car.

1008
01:17:59,048 --> 01:18:01,015
I'll open the door.

1009
01:18:04,519 --> 01:18:06,985
Bye, Ray.

1010
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,021
Nice to meet you, Mr. Pilcher.

1011
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,543
Luck. Yeah, but I've been
lucky all night long.

1012
01:18:39,547 --> 01:18:41,048
Uh-uh.

1013
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:44,051
You messed up now.

1014
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,552
You are at my mercy,

1015
01:18:46,553 --> 01:18:50,055
and I have... no mercy.

1016
01:19:03,065 --> 01:19:04,566
Watch my bottle.

1017
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,573
Hey, Virg, this dude
be starin' at you, man.

1018
01:19:13,574 --> 01:19:16,542
Virgil, I want to talk to you.

1019
01:19:16,577 --> 01:19:20,080
Well, we're gonna have to talk later.
I'm in the middle of a conversation.

1020
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:21,546
No. It's better now.

1021
01:19:21,581 --> 01:19:24,584
I might not feel in
the mood later on.

1022
01:19:24,619 --> 01:19:26,586
Come on, let's go.
Get up.

1023
01:19:30,589 --> 01:19:33,090
Whoa, nigger, look out.

1024
01:19:57,109 --> 01:19:59,577
All right.
I'm here.

1025
01:19:59,612 --> 01:20:02,114
What do you want
to talk about?

1026
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:06,117
When I was driving
up here from Arkansas,

1027
01:20:06,152 --> 01:20:08,585
I did a lot of thinking.
I thought about things

1028
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:11,621
I'd never really thought about.
I thought about some things

1029
01:20:11,622 --> 01:20:13,087
I seen in my lifetime-

1030
01:20:13,122 --> 01:20:15,624
Is this going to be some kind of...

1031
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:19,127
"Walking through the snow to school
and eating what you killed"

1032
01:20:19,628 --> 01:20:22,380
hillbilly lecture or something?
You goddamn right it is.

1033
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:24,597
You might want to listen
'cause you obviously

1034
01:20:24,632 --> 01:20:27,151
ain't been listening to anybody so far.
I don't need this.

1035
01:20:27,186 --> 01:20:30,101
Oh, I think you do.
Why don't you just sit down

1036
01:20:30,136 --> 01:20:33,139
and listen to me for one minute?
I ain't gonna bite you.

1037
01:20:41,146 --> 01:20:43,148
Sit down.
Ok.

1038
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:50,119
When I was coming up back home,
there was a guy

1039
01:20:50,154 --> 01:20:53,656
about four or five years older than me
named Bill Watley,

1040
01:20:54,156 --> 01:20:56,157
and Bill's folks both
got killed by lightning

1041
01:20:56,658 --> 01:20:59,660
at the same time, the same stroke,
while they were clearing,

1042
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,661
and he was their only kid.

1043
01:21:01,662 --> 01:21:05,164
So he started working-
he was only about 15 then-

1044
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:08,918
right after they died.
And he was pretty much on his own.

1045
01:21:08,953 --> 01:21:11,170
No other people to speak of, really,

1046
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:14,672
so he started hauling hay
and worked at a sawmill.

1047
01:21:14,673 --> 01:21:17,675
And bill-hell,
he was a big ol' boy,

1048
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:21,178
kind of ugly in the face,
not too popular around town,

1049
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:25,147
and he was real quiet,
well, he worked his ass off

1050
01:21:25,182 --> 01:21:27,183
until he finally saved up a little bit

1051
01:21:27,684 --> 01:21:30,186
and opened up a little
sort of a fix-it shop...

1052
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:32,688
appliances and small
engines and whatnot.

1053
01:21:32,723 --> 01:21:35,190
And when he got to be in his 30s,

1054
01:21:35,225 --> 01:21:38,156
he finally married this gal,
and, you know, she...

1055
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:41,694
Hell, she made him look
like Elvis Presley.

1056
01:21:42,696 --> 01:21:44,162
Butt-ugly.

1057
01:21:44,197 --> 01:21:47,699
But he loved that gal
like you wouldn't believe.

1058
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,701
I guess not having
any family and all

1059
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:53,203
just made him kind of worship her.

1060
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:54,704
And he worked all the time

1061
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:57,707
and once a month, he
took their spare money,

1062
01:21:57,742 --> 01:22:00,709
and he took her to Little Rock,
and he bought her something.

1063
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,711
One time it would be a dress,

1064
01:22:03,212 --> 01:22:07,181
and maybe next time a little doodad
or earrings or something.

1065
01:22:07,216 --> 01:22:10,218
Then me and daddy used
to go round to his shop

1066
01:22:10,253 --> 01:22:13,721
every now and then
'cause daddy always liked people

1067
01:22:13,756 --> 01:22:17,473
who didn't talk much, you know,
and Bill, he didn't say much.

1068
01:22:17,508 --> 01:22:20,225
And so... but every time
I was over there

1069
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,979
when it was getting time
to take her to Little Rock,

1070
01:22:24,014 --> 01:22:26,196
he talked a little more,

1071
01:22:26,231 --> 01:22:28,982
and he had this spark in his eyes.

1072
01:22:29,017 --> 01:22:31,735
That's what he lived for, see?

1073
01:22:33,237 --> 01:22:36,740
And I thought that was pathetic.
I thought, why,

1074
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,740
that simple-minded
son of a bitch.

1075
01:22:38,741 --> 01:22:41,243
I mean, I felt sad for him

1076
01:22:41,278 --> 01:22:43,745
'cause that's all he had.

1077
01:22:43,746 --> 01:22:46,213
And after being married
10 or so years,

1078
01:22:46,248 --> 01:22:50,215
she died from something, some kind of cancer
or leukemia or something,

1079
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,752
and he quit talking
altogether for a while

1080
01:22:53,253 --> 01:22:55,754
till he got approved
to adopt a boy.

1081
01:22:55,789 --> 01:22:59,756
And the same thing started over.
Every fourth saturday,

1082
01:22:59,757 --> 01:23:02,259
him and that boy
went to Little Rock.

1083
01:23:02,294 --> 01:23:05,762
And when he was little,
he bought him a toy or two.

1084
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:09,231
And when he got older,
it would be a suit and tie

1085
01:23:09,266 --> 01:23:12,768
or a book on baseball
or whatever else, you know.

1086
01:23:12,769 --> 01:23:14,771
But he spent every bit of himself-

1087
01:23:15,271 --> 01:23:18,222
body, mind, soul, and money,
on that boy.

1088
01:23:18,223 --> 01:23:21,725
And I was over there
a few years ago,

1089
01:23:21,726 --> 01:23:25,229
and somehow I got around
to asking the poor son of a bitch

1090
01:23:25,264 --> 01:23:28,732
about the bad luck he'd had.
And he said one thing,

1091
01:23:28,733 --> 01:23:31,234
and went back to
sharpening an ax blade.

1092
01:23:31,269 --> 01:23:33,754
He said, "Being happy
ain't nothing more

1093
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:37,738
"than having something to look forward to
and helping your people

1094
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:41,207
"have something to look forward to.
"I reckon that's what

1095
01:23:41,242 --> 01:23:42,742
gets me through till tomorrow. "

1096
01:23:46,746 --> 01:23:49,748
Now, you and me...
Let me tell you...

1097
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:55,218
have something in common
besides-you know what I mean.

1098
01:23:55,253 --> 01:23:58,755
I mean, we both find out
one day later on in life

1099
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:02,258
that life wasn't going to
be what we thought it was.

1100
01:24:02,759 --> 01:24:05,727
Now, your knee's
busted all to pieces.

1101
01:24:05,762 --> 01:24:10,266
Now, you ain't never going
to be a football star.

1102
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:12,767
And me, I'm not all Scots-Irish.

1103
01:24:12,768 --> 01:24:15,736
I'm going to have to
go face my family

1104
01:24:15,771 --> 01:24:19,773
and tell them they're going
to have to get used to it.

1105
01:24:22,275 --> 01:24:24,241
Now, two things, Virgil.

1106
01:24:24,276 --> 01:24:27,279
You better get something
to look forward to

1107
01:24:27,314 --> 01:24:28,780
instead of backwards at,

1108
01:24:28,781 --> 01:24:31,749
and you got a woman
and some children

1109
01:24:31,784 --> 01:24:34,786
that you owe them something
to look forward to.

1110
01:24:34,821 --> 01:24:37,288
And it ain't all about you.

1111
01:24:39,289 --> 01:24:41,792
Now...

1112
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:44,792
Heh. Your daddy's a good man.

1113
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:49,797
What can I say?
I mean, I'm, uh...

1114
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:50,799
Hell, I'm...

1115
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:56,802
I'm proud to call myself his brother.

1116
01:24:56,803 --> 01:24:58,805
Don't tell him I said that,

1117
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,073
or I'll kick your ass.

1118
01:25:01,108 --> 01:25:03,308
Don't think I can't do it.

1119
01:25:23,826 --> 01:25:27,328
Yes, sir, I'll tell him.
Ok.

1120
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,331
Thank you.

1121
01:25:33,334 --> 01:25:36,300
Earl, that you?
Yes, ma'am.

1122
01:25:36,335 --> 01:25:39,303
That was the police.
They found your truck.

1123
01:25:39,338 --> 01:25:42,839
It was just sitting on the street
over there in Rosedale.

1124
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,842
They found it?
Was it all right?

1125
01:25:45,843 --> 01:25:48,845
Say it was fine except
for the bullet holes.

1126
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,812
Bullet holes?

1127
01:25:50,847 --> 01:25:53,099
They say you can
pick it up tomorrow.

1128
01:25:53,134 --> 01:25:56,851
They just checking it out right now
for fingerprints and such.

1129
01:25:56,852 --> 01:25:59,854
Hold on a minute there.
What happened?

1130
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:02,356
Them fools that took it
robbed a bank,

1131
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:04,859
shot it out with
the security guard.

1132
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:08,361
Well, ain't that some shit.

1133
01:26:09,362 --> 01:26:12,865
Huh.
Collect call from Earl.

1134
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:21,121
Ruby?
Yeah. Heh...

1135
01:26:21,156 --> 01:26:22,872
I'm fine.

1136
01:26:22,873 --> 01:26:25,841
I'm still in Chicago.

1137
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:28,843
Uh, I'm coming home
tomorrow, Ruby.

1138
01:26:28,878 --> 01:26:32,381
I didn't find my wallet,
but I found my truck.

1139
01:26:32,416 --> 01:26:35,384
Yeah. I'm fixin' to tell you about it.

1140
01:26:36,385 --> 01:26:39,886
Whoa. I'm fixin' to tell you,
hold on a sec.

1141
01:26:58,903 --> 01:27:02,155
You know, just because
you found your truck,

1142
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:05,407
you shouldn't feel like
you got to r-r-rush off

1143
01:27:05,908 --> 01:27:08,410
if you want to hang
around a couple days.

1144
01:27:08,911 --> 01:27:11,878
No, I need to get back.
That nephew of mine

1145
01:27:11,913 --> 01:27:15,416
has probably run my business
into the ground by now.

1146
01:27:22,422 --> 01:27:25,924
All right, I got to get
something off my chest.

1147
01:27:25,925 --> 01:27:28,928
If i don't, it's going
to come out sometime,

1148
01:27:28,963 --> 01:27:31,930
and I'd just as soon
be done with it.

1149
01:27:31,965 --> 01:27:33,898
What do you want to tell me?

1150
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:40,402
It's your daddy,
the way I feel about him.

1151
01:27:40,403 --> 01:27:43,905
Haven't we already been through this?
Damn.

1152
01:27:50,911 --> 01:27:53,913
I just want to make
you understand.

1153
01:27:53,948 --> 01:27:57,417
I've lived my life with
a hatred of that man...

1154
01:27:57,917 --> 01:28:01,420
and no way to get it out.
Since there's not much chance

1155
01:28:01,421 --> 01:28:03,387
of me having it out with him,

1156
01:28:03,422 --> 01:28:07,425
I guess you are the
closest thing to it.

1157
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:11,394
You saying you want to
have it out with me?

1158
01:28:11,429 --> 01:28:14,430
I mean, we already wrestled
all over this neighborhood once.

1159
01:28:14,465 --> 01:28:16,949
Now, that wasn't
good enough for you?

1160
01:28:16,984 --> 01:28:19,434
I've always wanted
to kill your daddy

1161
01:28:19,435 --> 01:28:22,937
because I always felt
that he killed my mama.

1162
01:28:27,441 --> 01:28:28,407
That's it.

1163
01:28:28,442 --> 01:28:31,445
Just had to say it
to you that way.

1164
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:34,412
I know it's not right,
or so they say,

1165
01:28:34,447 --> 01:28:38,450
but I just don't think I
can ever forgive him.

1166
01:28:52,962 --> 01:28:56,481
I'm gonna get me something to eat.
Virgil?

1167
01:28:56,516 --> 01:28:59,466
Yes, ma'am?
There's a big envelope

1168
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:03,471
on top of the chest of
drawers in there in my room.

1169
01:29:03,506 --> 01:29:05,972
Get it and bring it in here to me.

1170
01:29:16,481 --> 01:29:17,982
Here you go, Aunt T.

1171
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:27,491
Come on over here. I want
to show y'all something.

1172
01:29:27,526 --> 01:29:29,492
Come on, now, both of you.

1173
01:29:31,494 --> 01:29:33,496
Pull that footstool over aside me.

1174
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:35,995
Sit down...

1175
01:29:50,508 --> 01:29:53,010
Raymond, that you
looking at the picture?

1176
01:29:53,045 --> 01:29:57,013
Yes, ma'am. Well, when you
get through looking at it,

1177
01:29:57,514 --> 01:30:00,016
I want you to hand it
to your brother.

1178
01:30:08,524 --> 01:30:11,025
You were a pretty
woman, all right.

1179
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:13,526
Fool, there ain't
nothin' wrong with

1180
01:30:13,527 --> 01:30:15,994
the way I look now.

1181
01:30:16,029 --> 01:30:18,530
That ain't me, anyhow.
That's your mama...

1182
01:30:18,531 --> 01:30:21,534
That is, if Virgil brought me
the right envelope.

1183
01:30:21,569 --> 01:30:25,037
It's the right one, Aunt T.

1184
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:29,040
Earl, put that picture
in your pocket.

1185
01:30:29,075 --> 01:30:32,041
Don't bend it and don't lose it.

1186
01:30:32,076 --> 01:30:34,008
That's your mother.

1187
01:30:34,043 --> 01:30:37,046
You don't have to give me this.

1188
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:39,012
I ain't got to do nothin'.

1189
01:30:39,047 --> 01:30:41,549
Now, you take good care
of that picture.

1190
01:30:49,557 --> 01:30:55,025
You was born may 4, 1933.

1191
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:59,064
It was somewhere around
about 10:30 at night

1192
01:30:59,099 --> 01:31:02,066
in the old house
on section line road

1193
01:31:02,101 --> 01:31:04,033
by the tracks.

1194
01:31:04,068 --> 01:31:08,072
I was always told I was
born on november 23rd.

1195
01:31:08,107 --> 01:31:11,039
You always been told
a lot of things.

1196
01:31:11,074 --> 01:31:15,042
And there wasn't any real doctors
down there in that part of town.

1197
01:31:15,077 --> 01:31:18,080
Old man collins down the road
knew some doctoring,

1198
01:31:18,115 --> 01:31:19,581
but he has a stroke,

1199
01:31:19,582 --> 01:31:23,084
so Maotis Jones come
down to the house.

1200
01:31:25,587 --> 01:31:27,053
When I come in the house,

1201
01:31:27,088 --> 01:31:31,090
Maotis was lookin' for peppers
to put in the bed.

1202
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:35,092
She told me the pepper
would ward off evil things.

1203
01:31:37,094 --> 01:31:38,595
Heh.

1204
01:31:38,596 --> 01:31:42,599
Most time, Maotis was lit up
like a christmas tree,

1205
01:31:42,634 --> 01:31:46,603
but she'd been a midwife
a long time

1206
01:31:46,638 --> 01:31:50,607
and could sober up right off
when there was a baby comin'.

1207
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:56,110
Willa Mae was breaking
out in a sweat

1208
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:59,078
and gettin' worse and worse.

1209
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:04,117
Maotis said the baby was
turned around all wrong...

1210
01:32:04,152 --> 01:32:07,120
and maybe the cord
was around its neck,

1211
01:32:07,155 --> 01:32:11,089
and if it was gonna make it,
we was gonna have to hurry,

1212
01:32:11,124 --> 01:32:14,624
and she wasn't sure
she could do it.

1213
01:32:17,628 --> 01:32:20,630
Willa Mae... your mama...

1214
01:32:20,631 --> 01:32:22,132
took my hand.

1215
01:32:23,633 --> 01:32:25,600
Told me she hurt bad

1216
01:32:25,635 --> 01:32:28,637
and she didn't want
her baby to die.

1217
01:32:28,672 --> 01:32:32,640
She asked me if I thought
the good Lord was punishing her

1218
01:32:32,641 --> 01:32:35,642
for how the baby come to be.

1219
01:32:36,142 --> 01:32:39,645
I told her to stop that talk

1220
01:32:39,646 --> 01:32:41,613
and that every little baby

1221
01:32:41,648 --> 01:32:44,649
that was supposed
to be born is born...

1222
01:32:44,684 --> 01:32:47,652
the good Lord love
all the little babies.

1223
01:32:48,153 --> 01:32:52,656
Then she say,
"Tiara, go get Raymond. "

1224
01:32:54,658 --> 01:32:56,158
She wanted to see you

1225
01:32:56,659 --> 01:33:00,162
'fore she got any worse off
and couldn't see you so good.

1226
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:08,134
So I went in the kitchen

1227
01:33:08,169 --> 01:33:11,922
and got you and took you in
to see your mama.

1228
01:33:11,957 --> 01:33:15,675
You were so scared to
see your mama like that.

1229
01:33:17,677 --> 01:33:20,930
She held onto your little hand,

1230
01:33:20,965 --> 01:33:24,148
and just for a minute or two,

1231
01:33:24,183 --> 01:33:28,685
she held up and acted like
there wasn't nothing wrong.

1232
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:31,188
Then she pulled you in closer,

1233
01:33:31,223 --> 01:33:32,688
hugged you so hard,

1234
01:33:33,189 --> 01:33:35,691
I thought your little eyes
was going to pop out.

1235
01:33:38,192 --> 01:33:40,694
I was certain of it-

1236
01:33:40,695 --> 01:33:44,949
your mama knew she wasn't
going to never see you again.

1237
01:33:44,984 --> 01:33:49,202
Maotis said we was gonna
have to get a white doctor

1238
01:33:49,237 --> 01:33:50,703
from up in town,

1239
01:33:50,704 --> 01:33:54,207
and I knew there wasn't
much chance of that.

1240
01:33:54,242 --> 01:33:58,709
That's why I sent
Junior up to town

1241
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:02,178
for your daddy, Earl.
It was his mess

1242
01:34:02,213 --> 01:34:04,965
that caused all this to start with.

1243
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,717
But your daddy said
he wouldn't come,

1244
01:34:08,218 --> 01:34:12,186
said he wasn't going down to niggertown
in the middle of the night.

1245
01:34:12,221 --> 01:34:15,725
And besides, he didn't have
nothing to do with all that.

1246
01:34:16,225 --> 01:34:18,191
That was that gal's problem.

1247
01:34:18,226 --> 01:34:23,730
Miss Carrie lit into Mr. Pilcher
like a water moccasin,

1248
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:27,233
told him to get over
and get Dr. Parks

1249
01:34:27,268 --> 01:34:28,733
and get down there

1250
01:34:28,734 --> 01:34:31,737
and save that little child of his.

1251
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,492
Well, he did go get Dr. Parks,

1252
01:34:37,527 --> 01:34:39,742
and they all showed up together-

1253
01:34:39,743 --> 01:34:43,246
Earl Pilcher, Dr. Parks,
Carrie, and Junior.

1254
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:47,250
But Earl wouldn't come in.

1255
01:34:48,752 --> 01:34:50,753
Just sat out front in that car.

1256
01:34:50,788 --> 01:34:52,754
I'd look out every now and then.

1257
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:56,757
I could see his cigarette burning.

1258
01:34:56,758 --> 01:34:59,725
But Carrie, she come in.

1259
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,262
She loved your birth mother.

1260
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:04,763
They was friends,

1261
01:35:04,764 --> 01:35:08,733
real good friends.

1262
01:35:08,768 --> 01:35:10,734
Willa Mae asked to speak

1263
01:35:10,769 --> 01:35:13,737
to Carrie alone for a minute.

1264
01:35:13,772 --> 01:35:16,775
I don't know what they
talked about in there

1265
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:20,777
at the time, but I pretty
much got it figured out

1266
01:35:20,778 --> 01:35:24,279
Over the years.
Got my own ideas, anyhow.

1267
01:35:26,782 --> 01:35:30,785
Well, old Dr. Parks
went to work,

1268
01:35:30,819 --> 01:35:34,252
and somehow or another,

1269
01:35:34,287 --> 01:35:37,290
he started getting you
straightened out a little

1270
01:35:37,325 --> 01:35:39,257
and on your way out.

1271
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:43,294
Your poor mama was
in so much pain,

1272
01:35:43,329 --> 01:35:45,796
she just wore out so bad,

1273
01:35:45,797 --> 01:35:48,299
she couldn't make a sound.

1274
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:51,751
And finally you came

1275
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:54,755
in all your glory, heh heh...

1276
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,775
face up, eyes wide open,

1277
01:35:57,810 --> 01:36:00,761
and white as bed linen.

1278
01:36:02,261 --> 01:36:04,762
I was standin' right there,

1279
01:36:04,763 --> 01:36:06,264
and I looked at you,

1280
01:36:06,765 --> 01:36:10,268
and your little eyes
was looking at me.

1281
01:36:10,768 --> 01:36:12,269
Yes, son,

1282
01:36:12,769 --> 01:36:15,772
I was the first person you ever saw.

1283
01:36:18,274 --> 01:36:21,025
Well, the doctor cut you loose

1284
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,776
and handed you to your mother.

1285
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:27,530
And she looked at you
like you was...

1286
01:36:27,565 --> 01:36:31,284
I don't even know how to say it...

1287
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:34,286
like you was a angel.

1288
01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:39,783
And then the doctor
started in working on her.

1289
01:36:39,818 --> 01:36:43,278
She was real bad off,
and she was bleeding,

1290
01:36:43,313 --> 01:36:46,762
so he had me take you
after a minute

1291
01:36:46,763 --> 01:36:51,516
and told me I better
go in the other room

1292
01:36:51,551 --> 01:36:56,270
with you and Raymond
and let him work.

1293
01:36:56,271 --> 01:36:58,773
so I bundled you up in a blanket,

1294
01:36:58,808 --> 01:37:01,276
took you two and Miss Carrie,

1295
01:37:01,311 --> 01:37:03,278
and went in the kitchen.

1296
01:37:06,779 --> 01:37:09,281
Heh heh...

1297
01:37:09,316 --> 01:37:11,749
and then, Ray,

1298
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:14,286
I put that baby in your arms.

1299
01:37:14,321 --> 01:37:17,305
Ray, when you saw that baby,

1300
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:20,290
you said, "That's my baby. "

1301
01:37:20,291 --> 01:37:24,295
"That's right.
Yhat's your baby," I said.

1302
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:26,260
"He's your brother. "

1303
01:37:26,295 --> 01:37:28,797
Then the doctor come in the room.

1304
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:31,816
I took one look at his face,

1305
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:34,802
and I knew Willa Mae was gone.

1306
01:37:38,305 --> 01:37:41,308
Carrie went in the bedroom
with Dr. Parks

1307
01:37:41,343 --> 01:37:42,809
to help him clean up.

1308
01:37:44,811 --> 01:37:47,311
And the three of us

1309
01:37:47,312 --> 01:37:49,814
was left alone there in the kitchen.

1310
01:37:58,822 --> 01:38:02,325
Ray, you held this boy
in your arms

1311
01:38:02,326 --> 01:38:05,829
right after he was born.
Ain't that something?

1312
01:38:12,833 --> 01:38:16,336
Oh, God...

1313
01:38:16,337 --> 01:38:19,338
your mama wanted to stay.

1314
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,843
She just didn't have the strength.

1315
01:38:27,346 --> 01:38:30,847
Sure do wish I could see you.

1316
01:38:50,863 --> 01:38:53,365
Bless your heart, boy.

1317
01:38:53,366 --> 01:38:57,370
You gonna go out the
same way you come in.

1318
01:38:57,405 --> 01:38:59,371
Heh heh heh...

1319
01:39:17,386 --> 01:39:21,138
Well, hope that truck
of yours will run

1320
01:39:21,173 --> 01:39:24,857
with all those bullet holes in it.
Guess I'll go home

1321
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:28,395
lookin' like I tangled with Al Capone.
Heh heh heh. Yeah.

1322
01:39:32,897 --> 01:39:33,898
Well...

1323
01:39:37,402 --> 01:39:41,905
Virgil, tell your wife and kids
I was glad to meet 'em.

1324
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,907
I was glad to meet you, too.

1325
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:49,913
Take care, Earl.
You bet.

1326
01:39:53,915 --> 01:39:55,882
Ma'am,

1327
01:39:55,917 --> 01:39:57,919
I want to thank you
for everything.

1328
01:40:04,425 --> 01:40:07,393
Now, don't you forget
your old Aunt T.

1329
01:40:07,428 --> 01:40:10,930
I don't think I could
hardly do that, now, could I?

1330
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:13,930
You take care, now.

1331
01:40:17,934 --> 01:40:19,435
Bless your heart.

1332
01:40:26,442 --> 01:40:28,944
Going home to Poorville, huh?

1333
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:32,947
Yep.
Well, I haven't been back there

1334
01:40:32,982 --> 01:40:35,448
since I left it... 60 years ago.

1335
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:38,917
Probably hasn't changed much.

1336
01:40:38,952 --> 01:40:42,455
Oh, it's grown up a little, I guess.

1337
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:46,959
Always wanted to get
down there someday

1338
01:40:46,994 --> 01:40:49,460
And visit mama's grave.

1339
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:52,963
Well, you ought to come
on down sometime and do it.

1340
01:40:54,964 --> 01:40:56,465
One of these days.

1341
01:40:58,468 --> 01:41:01,471
The police impound yard
is right up there.

1342
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,980
This it?

1343
01:41:17,983 --> 01:41:19,484
This is it.

1344
01:41:23,989 --> 01:41:26,490
Yeah, you ought to come
on down sometime.

1345
01:42:57,565 --> 01:42:59,066
You sure this is it?

1346
01:43:01,067 --> 01:43:03,069
I'm sure.

1347
01:43:28,089 --> 01:43:31,591
Well, we'll see.

1348
01:43:44,102 --> 01:43:45,603
"Father... "

1349
01:43:54,612 --> 01:43:57,615
"Sarah... Sarah. "

1350
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:08,121
Here it is.

1351
01:44:10,123 --> 01:44:11,624
Willa Mae...

1352
01:44:14,126 --> 01:44:15,127
Mother.

1353
01:44:31,642 --> 01:44:34,143
Kind of a nice morning.

1354
01:44:34,178 --> 01:44:35,644
Yeah, it is.

1355
01:44:39,148 --> 01:44:40,149
Willa Mae...

1356
01:44:44,652 --> 01:44:48,620
Want a snort?
Go on.

1357
01:44:48,655 --> 01:44:50,156
Won't bite ya.

1358
01:44:55,661 --> 01:44:57,162
Hoo-hah.

1359
01:44:59,164 --> 01:45:02,666
I never could drink that scotch.
Heh. Shoot.

1360
01:45:06,669 --> 01:45:10,137
Well, I tell ya...

1361
01:45:10,172 --> 01:45:14,675
I guess the folks are up
and out, probably.

1362
01:45:14,676 --> 01:45:16,643
Yeah.

1363
01:45:16,678 --> 01:45:20,146
Now, listen, this is not going to be
like a sunday picnic,

1364
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:22,148
let me tell you that right now.

1365
01:45:22,183 --> 01:45:25,184
Tuby and my girl will be
all right, I guess,

1366
01:45:25,219 --> 01:45:29,187
but that nephew of mine makes
your boy look like Mahatma Gandhi.

1367
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:32,691
Whoo...
He might take a shot at you...

1368
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:34,693
or even maybe both of us.

1369
01:45:36,451 --> 01:45:39,954
# Tell me, sister

1370
01:45:39,989 --> 01:45:43,423
# How do you feel?

1371
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:46,461
# Tell me, my brother,
brother, brother

1372
01:45:46,962 --> 01:45:50,931
# How do ya feel?

1373
01:45:50,966 --> 01:45:53,433
# If ya feel like dancin'

1374
01:45:53,468 --> 01:45:57,472
# Get up and let's
start dancin'

1375
01:45:57,507 --> 01:46:01,476
# Start gettin' the spirit
Start gettin' the spirit

1376
01:46:01,977 --> 01:46:03,478
# The spirit in the dark

1377
01:46:03,513 --> 01:46:07,446
# In the dark
Doot-doot

1378
01:46:07,481 --> 01:46:10,984
# It's like sally walker
Doo doo doot-doot

1379
01:46:10,985 --> 01:46:14,630
# Sittin' in a saucer
Doo doo doot-doot

1380
01:46:14,665 --> 01:46:17,991
# That's how ya do it
Doo doo doot-doot

1381
01:46:17,992 --> 01:46:21,495
# Now, get on out to it
Doo doo doot-doot

1382
01:46:21,996 --> 01:46:23,963
# Ri-i-ide, Sally, ride #

1383
01:46:23,998 --> 01:46:27,001
# Put your hands on your hips
Cover your eyes

1384
01:46:27,036 --> 01:46:30,254
# And move
With the spirit

1385
01:46:30,289 --> 01:46:33,007
# Darlin', move
Move with the spirit

1386
01:46:33,042 --> 01:46:35,474
# With the spirit

# Move with the spirit,

1388

# Move with the spirit

01:46:41,015 --> 01:46:44,483
# Are you gettin' the spirit?

01:46:44,518 --> 01:46:48,020
# Are ya gettin' it in the dark?

# I wonder how you're gettin' the spirit

# The spirit in the dark

1393
01:46:55,528 --> 01:46:58,030
# People movin'

# Yeah, everybody's groovin'

1395
01:47:01,068 --> 01:47:04,036
# Just gettin' the spirit

1396
01:47:04,037 --> 01:47:06,004
# Start gettin' the spirit

1397
01:47:06,039 --> 01:47:09,542
# Are ya gettin' it in the dark?
In the dark

1398
