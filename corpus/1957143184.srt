[soldier yelling in

14
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,174
[Saville] As you were.

15
00:02:58,217 --> 00:02:59,052
Name?

16
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,087
Vincenzo Bugeja.

17
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:03,189
Student.

18
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:06,192
He was caught throwing
stones at the soldiers.

19
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:15,769
What's your name boy?

20
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:17,804
Luigi Collins.

21
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:19,072
Luigi,

22
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:22,942
were you throwing stones
at the soldiers too?

23
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:30,849
And what did he do?

24
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:32,217
Nothing.

25
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,754
He stood by, watched the rioters

26
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:36,823
and did nothing to stop them.

27
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,694
[sighing]

28
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,602
Name?

29
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,106
John Abela, 17 years old,

30
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:56,009
he was caught in the
middle of the riots.

31
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:57,944
I saw what you did.

32
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:00,646
And what did we do?

33
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:04,450
[reflective music]

34
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:06,786
Look, these are all boys.

35
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:08,988
Did you catch the ringleaders?

36
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:11,691
We made numerous arrests.

37
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,626
That's not what I asked you.

38
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,895
All right, take them away.

39
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:21,033
Load them into the truck.

40
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,234
Take them straight to prison.

41
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,069
[Soldier] Sir!

42
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:00,339

00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,867
the garden has come
up beautifully.

47
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,435
Yes, Sir.

48
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:38,938
What's your name?

49
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,975
Yes, Sir.

50
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:46,112
Do you understand me?

51
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:47,813
Yes, Sir.

52
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:49,882
[Hunter titters]

53
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,084
Beautiful work.

54
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:54,920
Thank you.

55
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,528

Thank you Omar.

[footsteps approaching]

68
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:23,475
Fergie.

69
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:25,744
Your car is ready, Sir.

70
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:26,678
Thank you.

00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:30,216

[speaking in a foreign language]

75
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,896
[Saville] Two hours is
all we'll need

76
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,331
to round up the agitators.

77
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:21,234
I insist we send a
strong message,

78
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:24,403
shut down these
clowns permanently.

79
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:25,403
[Ritchie] Pardon my forwardness.

80
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:28,740
What is being proposed
here is insane.

81
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:31,677
We cut off the head,

82
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:33,846
the body will fall.

83
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,316
We cannot do what we want,
there are laws.

84
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,819
- We are the law.
- The war is over.

85
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:44,556
Sir, I'm still in touch
with their leaders,

86
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,859
I can bring them back to
the negotiating table.

87
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,261
If we do nothing

88
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:51,996
that'd just be inviting
more riots, more mayhem.

89
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,333
Now you all remember what
happened last February,

90
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:57,837
they paralyzed the whole
island with their strikes.

91
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,371
And then went on the rampage,

92
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:03,641
looting and burning shops
and government offices.

93
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:04,909
You're being overly dramatic,

94
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:07,980
they just threw some eggs
at the Malta Chronicle,

95
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:09,181
that's all.

96
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:12,117
A cowardly attack on the
freedom of the press.

97
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,351
The freedom of the press?

98
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:15,520
The Chronicle writes what
we tell them to write.

99
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:18,089
Now, our authority's
being challenged,

100
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:19,492
over and over.

101
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,394
The gloves have to come off.

102
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:26,331
Sir, this island is vital.

103
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:27,700
Precisely!

104
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,567
And that's why we
have to act now.

105
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:32,304
We have to protect
our interests.

106
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,740
[Ritchie] They have been
loyal subjects

107
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:37,076
for over a century.

108
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:38,277
Some of these people
are more British

109
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:39,644
than the king himself.

110
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:40,745
[titters] What?!

111
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,280
Have you done your
homework, man?

112
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:44,916
Have you not read what's
being written?

113
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:48,352
Sir, our severity has helped

114
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,889
to increase their ill behavior.

115
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:53,759
War against civilians

116
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:56,028
brings only pain.

117
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,362
And you,

118
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,298
of all the people in this room

119
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,466
should know what I'm
talking about.

120
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:05,705
How dare you mention that.

121
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:09,008
My boys died for their country,

122
00:16:10,174 --> 00:16:13,478
like any decent British
soldier would do.

123
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:16,816
I have always done my
duty to the crown.

124
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:17,450
Really?

125
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:21,319
And what were you doing
during the war?

126
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,054
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

127
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:29,160
May I may remind everyone

128
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:31,496
that we represent civilization.

129
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:35,400
I expect a mannerly
conduct from all of you.

130
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:39,871
Fergie, you have been
somewhat silent.

131
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:41,807
We're in a pickle, sir.

132
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:44,075
Any bright ideas?

133
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:46,878
I believe it would be reasonable

134
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:49,380
to make sure that
politicians know

135
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:51,116
that if they incite any
more violence,

136
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:53,786
we'll fight fire with fire.

137
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,020
How about that?

138
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,095
It's just awful.

139
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:05,865
Awful.

140
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:11,403
It has been a long night.

141
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:14,105
I want to thank you all
for your advice.

142
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:16,875
I have made my decision.

143
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:20,077
There will be no arrests tonight

144
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,913
and no deportations.

145
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:24,682
I do not wish to rock
the boat further.

146
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:29,888
- But, if any trouble starts
- [suspenseful music]

147
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:31,190
then we will quash it

148
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:33,825
by all means necessary.

149
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,930
Make sure their people
understand this.

150
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:42,366
We'll reconvene tomorrow
morning to follow proceedings.

151
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:43,235
Goodnight gentlemen.

152
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:44,702
If I may,

153
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:49,240
we should move some
troops closer to the city

154
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:51,709
just as a precautionary measure.

155
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,020
[engine rumbling]

156
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:06,091
[tense militaristic music]

157
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,247
Tell me private,

158
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:30,982
where is your gas mask?

159
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,019
Gas mask?

160
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:36,721
I don't have a gas mask.

161
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:40,291
They didn't give you a gas mask?

162
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:40,860
Do we need a gas mask?

163
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:44,797
Private, everyone
needs a gas mask.

164
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:53,538
[laughing]

165
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:55,840
Stick with us, private,
we'll look after you.

166
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:57,509
This is Corporal Bell,

167
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,243
I'm Private Colebrooke.

168
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,110
What's your name?

169
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:01,512
Private Love.

170
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:04,717
[calm music]

171
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:39,317
[man whistling]

172
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:03,802
- [birds cawing]
- [waves breaking]

173
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:08,873
I know, I know.

174
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,877
It's not exactly The
Ritz in Paris,

175
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:15,480
but it'll do the regiment fine.

176
00:21:15,512 --> 00:21:17,215
Squad A, lower quarter.

177
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:19,183
Squad B, upper quarters.

178
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:23,956
Well, come on, move
your arses men!

179
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:29,894
Sharp!

180
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:31,664
- Sargent.
- Corporal.

181
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:35,233
Corporal Bell!

182
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,269
There'll be a room
inspection in another hour,

183
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:40,538
have the men ready.

184
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:41,839
[Bell] Yes, Sergeant.

185
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:43,342
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

186
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:43,741
Move it.

187
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:45,576
Come on, hurry it through,

188
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:46,744

hurry it through.

189
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:48,278
Inspection in an hour,
you heard the sergeant.

190
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:50,115
How long have you been in
the army, Private Love?

191
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:51,717
Eight months.

192
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:53,919
Well, don't let yourself

193
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:56,054
get too worked up
about it, Private.

194
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:58,723
This isn't the war,
this is Malta.

195
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:00,692
Thank you Corporal Bell.

Thank you for coming, Dr.
Sceberras

199
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:02,755
I'm very concerned about
tomorrow's demonstration.

200
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:05,023
These constant transgressions

201
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:07,159
are making certain people
uncomfortable.

202
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,427
Our children are
dying of hunger,

203
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:13,398
that should make everyone
be uncomfortable.

204
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:15,267
Why won't you trust me?

205
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,202
I've given you no reason not to.

206
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:21,139
But this striking and
protesting business

207
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:23,174
has to stop now!

208
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:33,519

Get to the back son.

223

And now, what the bloody
hell was that?

224
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:22,254
My grandfather can do 10
times better than that

225
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:24,890
and he's been dead for
the past 30 years.

226
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:27,392
Get to the rear, you're
doing it again.

It will be wiser

276
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,577

kind of a message

00:52:17,773 --> 00:52:19,275
are we sending to these people

302
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:23,346
[Ritchie] We need to reach
out to their politicians.

[Ritchie] Never!

304
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,715
It's a sign of weakness.

305
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:26,716
Quiet!

306
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:31,288
I need some time alone.

within the next hour.

Yes, Sergeant?

336
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:21,731
Right, situation on the
ground is as follows.

337
00:54:22,398 --> 00:54:23,833
Protests have turned violent

338
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:26,869
and the bastards are making a
mess of the place as we speak.

339
00:54:26,902 --> 00:54:30,205
We're gonna restore order
the British Army way.

340
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:31,507
Any questions, son?

341
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,276
Do we have any intelligence

342
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:34,210
on the number of hostiles?

343
00:54:35,512 --> 00:54:39,582
It's an outright rebellion
against King and Empire.

00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:41,850
Everyone is a bloody hostile!

00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:45,822
I'll take squad A, you
take squad B.

you've cleared up your target.

- Yes, Sergeant.

362
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:11,875
maintain your composure.

363
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:14,344
Port arms.

364
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:18,414
Quick march.

368
00:56:47,175 --> 00:56:48,911
Right men, stand down,
two minutes break.

369

Under the arches, move, move.

370
00:56:51,047 --> 00:56:52,249
Keep your eyes up.

371
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:55,050
Good God, man, you stink.

372

history will be

563
01:17:54,176 --> 01:17:56,445
charitable to us?

564
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,086
Our troops behaved gallantly

565
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,622
and with honor, Sir,

566
01:18:07,555 --> 01:18:09,757
in very difficult circumstances.

567
01:18:11,326 --> 01:18:15,063
I believe history will
extol our efforts

568
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:16,731
to secure the Empire.

569
01:18:19,301 --> 01:18:20,369

Don't you?

584
01:19:27,635 --> 01:19:28,570
We've done good today.

585
01:19:29,703 --> 01:19:31,606
It depends on your
definition of good.

586
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,377
