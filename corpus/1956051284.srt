1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,035
(ominous music)

2
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,632
[Man] Hello, Dr. Martin.

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,973
He can't find the lab. (laughs)

4
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,096
(humming)

5
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,944
(electricity zapping)

6
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,000
(laughs)

7
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,750
(Dr. Martin clears throat)

8
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,548
Dr. Martin.

9
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,216
Now you're mapping the facial muscle

10
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,088
control regions, right?

11
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,974
(clears throat) Yes.

12
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,684
Have you finished?

13
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,768
Not quite.

14
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,479
Well, I wonder why.

15
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,064
All right.

16
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,980
Go into the stacks, get
me two more Class 3s.

17
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,976
Class 3.

18
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,818
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,686
Right away.

20
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,329
(electricity zaps)

21
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,209
Paranoia.

22
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,548
Paranoia.

23
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,463
Down there.

24
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,056
No, I need paranoia.

25
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,021
Paranoia.

26
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,694
(gasps)

27
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,413
(glass shatters)

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,036
Berkovitch.

29
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,457
Well?

30
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,333
What?

31
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,960
Not what, who?

32
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:41,802
Who?

33
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:42,795
Who fell?

34
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,796
One of the specimens.

35
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,173
Class 4, I think.

36
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:46,887
Theo.

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,683
I thought that we understood each other.

38
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,226
People, Berkovitch.

39
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,318
Individuals, minds, souls.

40
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,404
Every brain is a living record of a life.

41
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,864
A journey taken.

42
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,451
Who knows what journey
they're on now, hmm?

43
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,570
Now, who fell?

44
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,330
(Theo sighs)

45
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,072
Montag.

46
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:11,828
Montag.

47
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,328
Phillip Montag.

48
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,455
That's parietal paralysis.

49
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,301
I think we're fairly well
covered on that area, but still.

50
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:26,548
The place just won't be
the same without him.

51
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,049
Gather up what you can.

52
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,472
Prepare a new bottle, 80% more gelatin,

53
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,596
and we'll see if we can
keep the old boy together.

54
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,471
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,601
(humming)

56
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,064
Morning, Mr. Hoffencamp.

57
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,824
How's every little floating thing?

58
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,912
Oh, yeah?

59
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,782
You don't say.

60
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,080
Feeling a little suspicious?

61
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,036
Persecuted?

62
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,046
I see.

63
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,258
Like somebody studying
you or observing you.

64
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,091
Right.

65
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,881
Well, that's correct.

66
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,631
Just remember, Hal, that
just because you're paranoid,

67
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,384
doesn't mean they aren't out to get you.

68
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,010
(ominous music)

69
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,737
Are you all right, Dr. Martin?

70
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,859
Oh, nothing that a little
brain surgery couldn't cure.

71
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,906
(chuckles)

72
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,279
Now, where was I?

73
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,531
Um...

74
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,283
All that we suffer.

75
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,124
Right.

76
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,291
Or enjoy comes from the
brain and its condition.

77
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,335
Whether it's hot, cold, moist, dry.

78
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,382
Madness, in particular,
stems from its moistness.

79
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,135
Hippocrates, 4th century BC.

80
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,851
I'll type this up.

81
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,640
Thanks.

82
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,605
The universe is just a wet dream.

83
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,825
By the perception of
illusion, we experience reality.

84
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,118
The inscrutable Professor Ang.

85
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,582
Ah, see?

86
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:20,124
The liberal arts course
pays off after all.

87
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,541
Have you been drinking?

88
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,712
You always get cryptic
after you've been drinking.

89
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,428
It's the only way I
can keep my lunch down.

90
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,553
I just spent the last hour
and a half being grilled

91
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,677
by the chairman over a
plate of calamari fungi.

92
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,144
He says I'm not people-oriented.

93
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,184
Now, what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

94
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,556
I don't know.

95
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,274
I'm brain-oriented and that doesn't seem

96
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,984
to have anything to do with people.

97
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:44,818
Exactly.

98
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,232
How would you know?

99
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,697
You're your own boss,
you do your own work.

100
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,909
You married the smartest,
prettiest girl in our class.

101
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,655
It was me or you and you lost.

102
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,123
That's about the only thing you ever lost.

103
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,953
No, I lost Halsey.

104
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,832
I lost the numbers.

105
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,967
Shit, I'm probably gonna lose my job.

106
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,836
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,180
Do you know Lakeside?

108
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,641
Yeah, it's a mental institution.

109
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,475
Correct.

110
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,309
We own it.

111
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,678
Oh, you own it, huh?

112
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,477
Well, the corporation has
very diversified interests.

113
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,146
From the tridium that feeds the rockets

114
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,394
to the powdered milk
that feeds the babies.

115
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,440
We're Eunice.

116
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,155
All right.

117
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,899
What about Lakeside?

118
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,871
There's a patient there, a
former employee name of Halsey.

119
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,289
The man was a genius, but he lost it.

120
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,251
Butchered his family and plead insanity.

121
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:46,964
But some of the board members
feel he might be dissembling.

122
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,799
Well, why would he fake it?

123
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,920
Halsey wasn't exactly happy
with some of the applications

124
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,967
his work might be put to.

125
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,882
Look, maybe he's just
trying to get out of it.

126
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,054
The point is, he's nuts.

127
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,725
He's not responsible,
but I am responsible.

128
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,018
You see, Halsey was my baby.

129
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,902
So now, I'm in shit city with the board

130
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,443
and he's in a rubber
room totally paranoid.

131
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,445
Oh.

132
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:15,739
Paranoid.

133
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,036
So, this is what it's all about, huh?

134
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:24,873
Hmm.

135
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,167
Jim.

136
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,540
I didn't know who else I could turn to.

137
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,884
I mean, nobody knows more
about paranoia than you.

138
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,549
You're the brain man for Christ sakes.

139
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,263
I don't do corporate science.

140
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,507
I told you that.

141
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,473
Aw, come on.

142
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,059
As a favor to me, would
you go to Lakeside?

143
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,770
Visit Ward 8, ask for Halsey.

144
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,810
I'm not a psychiatrist.

145
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,933
Then run a few tests.

146
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,479
See what you think.

147
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:54,949
Besides, aren't you getting a
little tired of bottle brains?

148
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,243
Here's one you can have fresh.

149
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,075

I'm looking for Mr. Halsey.

159
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,778
Right over there.

160
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,741
Thank you.

161
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,169
(woman laughing)

162
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,258
Mr. Halsey?

163
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,266
Conklin send you?

164
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,103
No.

165
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,018
My wife send you?

166
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:08,855
No.

167
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,440
My lawyer?

168
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,934
[Dr. Martin] No, Mr. Halsey.

169
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,857
I didn't say I was Halsey.

170
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,104
Well, I'm sorry.

171
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,322
You see, I was told that.

172
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,441
You're not from Conklin?

173
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,826
No.

174
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,945
Nor from your wife.

175
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,786
My wife?

176
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,745
What's she to you?

177
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,579
How long have you known her?

178
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,413
What do you mean?

179
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,281
Sit down.

180
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,203
Thank you.

181
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:30,794
I'm Halsey.

182
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,288
I've been expecting you.

183
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,336
Let's go somewhere where we can talk.

184
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,969
He didn't trust me.

185
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,015
I didn't trust her.

186
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,059
And she didn't trust him.

187
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,026
You see?

188
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:55,894
Yes, go on.

189
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,646
Smilin' Ed pays me in cash, right?

190
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,568
Always has.

191
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,908
Son, Conklin pays cash.

192
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,323
Checks are for bankers and grifters.

193
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,116
But when I look, I don't see Ben Franklin.

194
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,204
No, siree.

195
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,951
I see Conklin's greasy
face smiling up at me.

196
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,452
It was his way of spying on me

197
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,419
with his little face in my pocket.

198
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,210
And worse, much worse.

199
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,125
What?

200
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,547
He fucked my wife.

201
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:23,389
Right there in the factory
on the perfect sleeper.

202
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,225
And that man, he's the troublemaker.

203
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,718
He's even followed me in here.

204
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,721
He's in the hospital.

205
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,065
Dr. Martin, he wants to kill me.

206
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,653
Mr. Halsey, have you ever
heard of Eunice Corporation?

207
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,609
Eunice.

208
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,233
That's my wife's name.

209
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,984
No, this is a corporation.

210
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,159
Maybe you did some mathematical
work for them or something.

211
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:51,034
I work with numbers, sure,
but I work for Conklin.

212
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,081
Conklin Mattresses.

213
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,828
I'm an accountant.

214
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,671
Neat little rows and columns.

215
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,505
No equations.

216
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,170
Equations are too messy.

217
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,545
You get a few numbers left over and boom.

218
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,223
End of the world as we know it.

219
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,012
No.

220
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,510
I stick to accounts.

221
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,270
It's safer.

222
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,434
Safer?

223
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,104
Are you familiar with
the Hippocratic Oath?

224
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,271
Doctors take it.

225
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,237
Right, but maybe everybody should.

226
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,940
At least do no harm.

227
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,160
I think that's a fine rule.

228
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,827
We can't all do good,
but at least do no harm.

229
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,664
Mr. Halsey, would you mind
if I ran a few tests on you?

230
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,540
Just make a few maps?

231
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,668
All simple, all completely painless.

232
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,762
Would that be all right?

233
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,881
Does it pay cash money?

234
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,677
No.

235
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,850
I'll take it.

236
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,848
(machines beeping)

237
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,050
(computer beeping)

238
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,642
[Dr. Martin] Well, one thing's for sure.

239
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,985
Halsey's not faking.

240
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,819
Oh, really?

241
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,653
How do you know?

242
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,817
Well, look at these.

243
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,862
Brain maps of three certified paranoids.

244
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,987
See this green area here, here, here?

245
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,613
That's the abnormality.

246
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,832
That's the fly in the
ointment, if you will.

247
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,371
Now, here's Halsey.

248
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,371
See that?

249
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,792
Same thing.

250
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,415
[Jim] Fantastic.

251
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,009
How soon can you operate?

252
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,002
Operate?

253
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,254
No, no, no.

254
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,722
This is all theoretical work.

255
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,933
I need maybe two more years of lab work,

256
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,892
and then two years of animal research,

257
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,855
and then I think we might just
chance opening somebody up.

258
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,689
I haven't got four years.

259
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,025
I haven't even got four weeks.

260
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,566
Why not just cut it out?

261
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,938
No, no, no, no.

262
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,072
You open that door and
you step off a cliff.

263
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,536
It's awfully risky.

264
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,325
Especially for Halsey.

265
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,037
Halsey was working on something big.

266
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,910
Cornerstone technology.

267
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,413
That's all I can tell you.

268
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,460
It's classified shit.

269
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,677
When Halsey lost his marbles,
he destroyed his results.

270
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,764
We need those numbers
or we need to make sure

271
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,680
that nobody else will ever get them.

272
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,475
Jim.

273
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,061
You want him brain dead.

274
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,110
Who said anything about brain dead?

275
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,194
Don't you believe your own theories?

276
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,116
Afraid to put 'em to the test?

277
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,534
No.

278
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,372
Come on.

279
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,582
You can't stand there
and tell me you haven't

280
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,328
dreamed of an opportunity like this.

281
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,545
A living brain.

282
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,421
Think of it.

283
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,837
I...

284
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,512
I just wouldn't feel right about it.

285
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,379
Sorry, Jim.

286
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,010
I'd rather not.

287
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,383
Oh, for Christ sakes.

288
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,511
Would you quit thinking
about Halsey for a second

289
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,558
and think about yourself?

290
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,151
You see, in a sense, you
already work for Eunice.

291
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,241
Eunice?

292
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,860
Don't be so naive.

293
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,248
Who's research isn't
corporate funded these days?

294
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,119
I mean, it's either us or
the Department of Defense.

295
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,668
That doesn't mean that you own me.

296
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,293
Don't you want to change
the world and get rich?

297
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,340
What if Halsey refuses?

298
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,844
Well, Halsey's really not
in a position to choose.

299
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,308
And nor am I?

300
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,099
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

301
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,098
Look at it this way, it could be worse.

302
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,727
You could be the patient and
Halsey could be the doctor.

303
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,729
(laughs)

304
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,132
(horn honks)

305
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,501
Whoa.

306
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,128
He's got my brain.

307
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,430
He's got my brain.

308
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,050
Fuck, shit, my brain.

309
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,393
It's my fucking brain, goddamn it.

310
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,226
Shit.

311
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,846
Piss fucking shit.

312
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,314
Give me my fucking brain.

313
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,728
That's my fucking brain!

314
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,566
No.

315
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,400
Yes.

316
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,234
It's my fucking brain.

317
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,274
- No.
- It's my brain.

318
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,612
Sir, there must be some mistake.

319
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,446
There's no mistake.

320
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,280
It's my brain!

321
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,490
- This is my brain.
- That's my brain!

322
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,324
My brain!

323
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,363
No, you have your own brain.

324
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,236
This is mine and you can't have it.

325
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,237
- It's my fucking brain!
- Please, sir.

326
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,365
I'm afraid that it is not your.

327
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,708
(tense music)

328
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,669
(tires squealing)

329
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,335
(glass shatters)

330
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,592
(siren wailing)

331
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,107
(chatter on police radio)

332
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,493
(echoed chattering)

333
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,482
Let's put the cages over here

334
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:42,031
and the freezers along
this wall over here.

335
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,788
Oh, Martin.

336
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,157
How embarrassing.

337
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,208
Ellis.

338
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,918
Sorry to hear about your grant.

339
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,538
I think it's outrageous.

340
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,418
I mean, what ever happened
to academic freedom?

341
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,634
Bastards own us, Rex.

342
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,882
Lock, stock, and barrel.

343
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,723
You've got guts.

344
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,888
I'll say that for you, not me.

345
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,932
Do I question why the
US Army is interested

346
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,804
in endocrine secretion?

347
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,438
Chemical regulators of human behavior.

348
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,778
Well, you can bet your
bottom dollar I don't.

349
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,317
What do you want?

350
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,617
I know it's terrible of
me to barge in here so soon,

351
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,705
but, well, I have to be in
Washington all next week.

352
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,538
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,658
I thought they told you.

354
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,127
My grant has been doubled.

355
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,086
We need more space.

356
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,049
And you know, I love all this shelf space.

357
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,419
By the way, what are you
going to do with all of these?

358
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,510
I don't know.

359
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,345
Tell you what.

360
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,591
I can probably use most of them.

361
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,968
Of course, all I really need
are the endocrine receptors,

362
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,469
but I'll pay you by the pound.

363
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,016
Charge as much as you want.

364
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,983
Our Uncle Sam is picking
up the tab on this one.

365
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,519
Get out of here.

366
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,771
(chuckles)

367
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,567
What?

368
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,490
You heard me.

369
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,447
Get out of here.

370
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,239
Both of you.

371
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,203
No need to be nasty, Rex.

372
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,697
I'm just trying to do you a favor.

373
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,665
They're individuals.

374
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,534
They're special.

375
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,956
They're unique.

376
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,044
You're not going to grind them up

377
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,710
into your brain shake smears.

378
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,548
Get out.

379
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,382
All right.

380
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,251
No problem, Rex.

381
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:25,597
Just make sure that you
and all of your friends

382
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,967
are out by the end of the week.

383
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,264
Let's go, Bixby.

384
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,263
Just a minute.

385
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,354
(yells)

386
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,270
(tense music)

387
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:41,238
(metal clattering)
(glass shattering)

388
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,611
Oh, no.

389
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,202
(sighs)

390
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,285
Yeah.

391
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,242
Bad dream?

392
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,040
Oh, it was so vivid.

393
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,712
It must be an aftershock of the accident.

394
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,549
Accident?

395
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,963
What accident?

396
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,680
Oh, I had a little
accident this afternoon.

397
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,053
I think.

398
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,019
Or was that part of my dream?

399
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,765
Jim said you seemed a
little tense this afternoon.

400
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,482
When did you see Jim?

401
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,852
Since when do you and Jim get
together to talk about me?

402
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,319
Relax.

403
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,153
He called me.

404
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,317
He's my friend, too.

405
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,280
Oh, great.

406
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,908
You and Jim, huh?

407
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,073
We should both get together and decide.

408
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,036
What's the matter?

409
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,247
I don't know why you're so upset.

410
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,787
I'd think you'd be excited.

411
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,330
Oh, I don't know.

412
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,255
I guess I'm a little afraid.

413
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,001
I don't want to rush into anything.

414
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,213
You've been poking
around in people's brains

415
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,431
as long as I've known you.

416
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,140
What makes this one so different?

417
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,179
Halsey.

418
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,303
Halsey makes it different.

419
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,851
He was a full fellow at the
Institute for Advanced Studies

420
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,689
when he was 14.

421
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,185
I was still reading Tom
Swift, boy scientist.

422
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,607
So, what happened to him?

423
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,650
Tom Swift?

424
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,488
No, silly.

425
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,073
Halsey.

426
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:07,862
Oh.

427
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,027
Well, they said he went nuts.

428
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:14,577
He killed his wife, two kids,
and three research assistants.

429
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,371
Genius, maybe, but
definitely not a nice guy.

430
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,914
No, quite to the contrary.

431
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,878
He's a very sweet man.

432
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,338
I met him today.

433
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,048
He likes me.

434
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,635
I'm so glad you're making new friends.

435
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,924
Morning, boys.

436
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,685
Would you buy me a pack
of cigarettes, please?

437
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,553
Oh, sure.

438
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,015
My money's no good here.

439
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,279
Well, here's a couple of bucks.

440
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,114
No, no.

441
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,278
Give me your wallet.

442
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,868
You think I want every
Joe in the joint to know

443
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,329
who's buying me my cigarettes?

444
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,496
Trust me.

445
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:02,954
All right.

446
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:04,752
Here.

447
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,597
Old man RJ was nobody's fool.

448
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,813
You can learn a thing or
two from this beast's back.

449
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,931
Look real close.

450
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,399
You can see a man there.

451
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,233
He's pissing.

452
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,022
See?

453
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,357
It's Franklin Roosevelt.

454
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,197
There.

455
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,736
That's his willy.

456
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,827
Actually, it's Rosenfeld.

457
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,070
It's true.

458
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,196
He changed his name.

459
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,822
I read it in a book.

460
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,788
And there in the lion.

461
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,088
You can see a giant bald eagle

462
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,958
mounting a naked woman from behind.

463
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,344
Halsey, I need your help.

464
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,337
[Halsey] You do?

465
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,759
Yes.

466
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,134
Here, let me help you with that.

467
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,885
In fact, I think you're
probably the only one

468
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,182
who can help me.

469
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,646
[Halsey] Me?

470
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,436
Why me?

471
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,815
You and I, we have something in common.

472
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,938
[Halsey] What's that?

473
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,817
Well, for one thing, we
both had the same employer.

474
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,533
Son of a bitch!

475
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,902
Halsey.

476
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,120
[Halsey] You work for Conklin!

477
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,203
No, I don't work for Conklin.

478
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,163
I knew it!

479
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,782
Goddamn rotten spy!

480
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,204
No, I'm not a spy.

481
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,373
I don't work for Conklin.

482
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,337
Let me explain it to you this way.

483
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,710
We both know that pure
science exists above all this.

484
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,005
Do you trust me?

485
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,641
[Halsey] I do.

486
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,729
I need to open you up.

487
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,694
I need to examine your brain.

488
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,562
My brain?

489
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,111
You have a special brain,
a very special brain.

490
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,326
That's why we did all those tests.

491
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,196
But tests aren't enough for them now.

492
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,822
I need to show them.

493
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,075
My brain.

494
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,426
I know you feel like
I've railroaded you.

495
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,636
Try blackmailed.

496
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,221
I'm just helping you be you.

497
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,557
You know you want to do this.

498
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,142
And believe me.

499
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,138
Some day when you're rich and famous,

500
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:28,563
and you're the head of
Eunice's neuroscience division,

501
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,561
you'll thank me.

502
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,437
Mark my words.

503
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,236
You'll thank me for what I did.

504
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,028
Good luck.

505
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,875
(doors whirring)

506
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,294
(tense music)

507
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,846
Mr. Reston, surely you're not suggesting

508
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,220
that Eunice go into the lobotomy business?

509
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,439
We don't need that kind of publicity.

510
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,808
It's not the image
Eunice wants to project.

511
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,357
I was merely using these
unpleasant associations

512
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,605
to illustrate a point.

513
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,325
Dr. Martin's procedure is
quite a different story.

514
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,113
Rex.

515
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,077
He's right.

516
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,663
It's very different than the '50s.

517
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:09,125
You could call it the
kinder, gentler lobotomy.

518
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,666
Let's get to the point, shall we?

519
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,880
What about Halsey?

520
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:14,622
Theo.

521
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,260
Mr. Halsey's paranoid psychosis stems from

522
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,139
an abnormality near the sub-visual cortex.

523
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,233
Now I've been doing very
extensive maps on the area.

524
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,442
Skip the map.

525
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,232
Can you cure him?

526
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,696
Restore his mathematical genius?

527
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,780
Stimulate his memory?

528
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,820
At least get the numbers?

529
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,537
In the best possible case,
he may completely recover.

530
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,247
If so, he'll probably
remember the numbers you want

531
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,991
or be able to recalculate them.

532
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,245
If, and only if, he
believes it's appropriate.

533
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,212
And in the worst case?

534
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,500
Tabula rasa.

535
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,548
A clean slate.

536
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,514
It could completely wipe his brain.

537
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,382
Please, proceed, Dr. Martin.

538
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,101
You have our undivided attention.

539
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,866
(tense music)

540
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,545
(electricity zapping)

541
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,394
(laughing)

542
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,476
Mr. Halsey?

543
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,145
Yes.

544
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,769
Are you still with us?

545
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,566
Yes.

546
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,906
Why are you at Lakeside?

547
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,745
(electricity zaps)

548
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,287
(elegant harpsichord music)

549
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,659
[Halsey] I don't know.

550
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,787
Oh, yes, you do.

551
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,130
What about your family?

552
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,339
They're dead.

553
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,421
Oh, I'm so sorry.

554
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,929
What happened to them?

555
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,598
They were murdered.

556
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,387
Really?

557
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,889
Oh, I'm so sorry.

558
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,059
Mr. Halsey?

559
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,896
Yes.

560
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,773
(electricity zaps)

561
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,574
Who killed them, Mr. Halsey?

562
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,369
Conklin.

563
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,328
Black, and white, and red all over.

564
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,203
Shocking.

565
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,750
You didn't kill them yourself?

566
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,714
No.

567
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,675
[Chairman] But what about the numbers?

568
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,639
I'm just an accountant.

569
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,507
Bullshit.

570
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,394
Just give us those numbers, Halsey.

571
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,013
Gentlemen, please.

572
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,982
This is a delicate procedure.

573
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:25,980
Mr. Halsey.

574
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,616
[Rex] Can you hear me, Mr. Halsey?

575
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,734
Huh?

576
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:30,531
Yeah.

577
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,491
Mr. Halsey?

578
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,915
Yes?

579
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,453
Is the man who followed you,

580
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:42,422
the man who killed your family,
this Conklin, is he here?

581
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,377
Yes.

582
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,296
Do you see him?

583
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,669
No.

584
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,715
How do you know that?

585
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,554
He follows me everywhere.

586
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,595
Black, and white, and red all over.

587
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,515
Well, I can't see him, Mr. Halsey.

588
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,103
Why don't you take a look around

589
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,564
just to put your mind at rest?

590
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,854
There he is.

591
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,948
(laughing)

592
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,369
Now, I want you to just relax.

593
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,756
(electricity zapping)

594
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,398
[Jim] Knock, knock.

595
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,772
Mr. Halsey.

596
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,983
Is the man in white still with us?

597
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,575
Look for him, please.

598
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,662
Who are you referring to?

599
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,201
(sighs)

600
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,165
Thank you, Mr. Halsey.

601
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,453
By the way, Mr. Halsey.

602
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,204
What do you do for a living?

603
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,831
I'm a mathematician.

604
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,710
[Rex] And what are you working on now?

605
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,711
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

606
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,677
I'm sorry.

607
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,219
[Rex] That's quite all right.

608
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,189
(people applauding)

609
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,367
Dr. Martin, you have
written and said many times

610
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,236
that reality is in the brain.

611
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,078
That's right.

612
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:38,912
Yes.

613
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,157
And yet you give yourself the power

614
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,752
to alter another human being's reality.

615
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,540
Um.

616
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,710
Ethical questions aside,

617
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,709
what are we really talking about here?

618
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,301
What's the growth potential?

619
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,296
I've got this one.

620
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,094
For the last decade
cosmetic plastic surgery

621
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,433
has out grossed every
other medical procedure,

622
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:02,554
bar none, by several thousand percent.

623
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:08,231
If people are so anxious to
change their faces and bodies,

624
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,071
what about their personalities,
their very souls?

625
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,609
Had a bad childhood?

626
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:14,573
We can fix it.

627
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,067
(laughing)

628
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:20,868
Resculpt your memory, sharpen
your perception, or soften it.

629
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,365
Why not?

630
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,082
And why not Eunice?

631
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,496
Hear, hear.

632
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,463
(people applauding)

633
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,926
See, they love you.

634
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,545
What did I tell you?

635
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,511
Look, I know I pushed you
a little hard on this,

636
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,429
but it's all for the best.

637
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,392
(laughing)

638
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,057
Now you and Dana are meeting the chairman

639
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,226
and I for dinner at eight.

640
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,565
Don't be late.

641
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,603
Yeah, fine.

642
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,227
We'll be there.

643
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,525
[Jim] Excuse me, chairman.

644
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,802
(Conklin laughing)

645
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,685
(ominous music)

646
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,272
(machine beeping)

647
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,278
Halsey.

648
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,075
Bank of Sleepyland.

649
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,200
Damn you, Halsey.

650
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,790
(Conklin laughing)

651
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,378
(tense music)

652
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,765
Get off my tail.

653
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,515
It's not funny anymore.

654
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,248
Hey.

655
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,793
Hey, who the hell are you?

656
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,083
What do you want?

657
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,181
I'll take Manhattan, but
I'll settle for dinner.

658
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,640
What's the matter?

659
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,811
How long have you been behind me?

660
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,147
I don't know, a couple of blocks.

661
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,685
Didn't you hear me honk?

662
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,729
No, I didn't.

663
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,227
But I thought that
somebody was following me.

664
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,979
I guess not.

665
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,820
I'm sorry.

666
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:41,689
My mistake.

667
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,945
Come on.

668
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:52,825
Rex, come on.

669
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,506
You okay?

670
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,295
Yeah.

671
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,558
Thank you.

672
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,724
Thanks.

673
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,352
Do you really think you should drink?

674
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,145
Oh, absolutely.

675
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,313
Now don't get mad, but I.

676
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,480
When you start a sentence like that,

677
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,194
it signals my brain something is coming

678
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,405
that I absolutely will get
mad at and before I know it,

679
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,695
ugly pheromones are
rocketing through my system

680
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,489
and I'm ready to kill.

681
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,700
Did you have a nice day?

682
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:31,538
All right, Rex.

683
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,372
What's going on?

684
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,365
What's wrong?

685
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,208
I guess I'm a little tired.

686
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,498
I don't mean just tonight.

687
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,416
You've changed.

688
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,541
Sometimes I feel like I hardly know you.

689
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,507
Well, Dana.

690
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,296
I just.

691
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,134
(ominous music)

692
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,973
Hey.

693
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,012
[Dana] Rex.

694
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:55,437
Hey, you.

695
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,523
Hey, watch it, buddy.

696
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,811
Oh, I'm sorry.

697
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,394
I'm terribly sorry.

698
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,235
It's my fault.

699
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,313
No harm done.

700
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,031
Yeah, no harm done.

701
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,386
We go back quite a ways.

702
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,507
We were actually roommates in college.

703
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,846
[Dana] Rex.

704
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,684
Rex.

705
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,518
Excuse me.

706
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,308
Rex.

707
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,848
I'm back.

708
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,560
[Jim] Rex.

709
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,435
Excuse me.

710
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,153
[Jim] We're over here.

711
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,772
Um, do I know you?

712
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,198
Right.

713
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,113
Rex, honey.

714
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,950
Oh.

715
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:51,785
You need a drink.

716
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:52,699
Of course.

717
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,116
Excuse me.

718
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,204
I don't believe the two of you

719
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,699
have been formally introduced.

720
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,419
Res, I'd like you to meet Cyril
Vance, chairman of Eunice.

721
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,788
It's an honor and a
pleasure, Dr. Martin.

722
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,665
You're a moron at
your leisure, Mr. Vance.

723
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,293
(laughs) Don't mind
my husband, Mr. Vance.

724
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,135
It's cocktail hour and
I think he's channeling

725
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,130
the voice of Oscar Wilde.

726
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:14,679
Here we go.

727
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,222
A toast to madness.

728
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,099
Madness is merely moisture on the brain.

729
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,145
Here's proof.

730
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,651
I think he started
celebrating before us.

731
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:32,368
Cy, the possibilities of
this thing are unlimited.

732
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,612
I mean, this is gonna have
a revolutionary impact

733
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,830
up and down our service and product lines.

734
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,372
Well, I love your idea for
clinics within the communities.

735
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,835
Have you a name for them?

736
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,376
I've got the boys in marketing
revving up their engines.

737
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,001
How about attitude adjustment centers?

738
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,298
How does that grab you?

739
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,091
Awful.

740
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,303
There's no harmony to that.

741
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,802
It's not user friendly.

742
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,520
You're absolutely right, sir.

743
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,479
How about...

744
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,525
I've got it.

745
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,778
The new you from Eunice.

746
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,830
The new (chuckles) you from Eunice.

747
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,417
The new you from Eunice.

748
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,335
I love it.

749
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,915
(laughing)

750
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,212
Why not?

751
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,006
Why not a doc-in-the-box
on each corner, hmm?

752
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,427
Slogans, come on in
for a jiffy spinal tap.

753
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,222
$19.95 for a quick lube and lobotomy.

754
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,811
Bang, drive-in service.

755
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,396
You could even do it to yourself.

756
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,185
Self...

757
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,355
I don't know if anybody's
told you about me,

758
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,480
but I'm a purple people.

759
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,278
No, I'm a person pimple.

760
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,741
Uh, people person.

761
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,735
There we go.

762
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:00,114
People like me, generally,
when they meet me.

763
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:00,955
Excuse me.

764
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:01,790
Cy, wait.

765
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:02,624
Please, let me explain.

766
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:07,622
He's been under a terrible
strain these last couple weeks.

767
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,418
Shit.

768
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,379
I like people.

769
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,600
Have another drink,
you dumb son of a bitch.

770
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,396
You're finished.

771
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,521
Fine, fire me.

772
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,864
Take my wife, take my life.

773
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:34,947
That's why I'm here.

774
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:35,782
[Dana] Rex, calm down.

775
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,697
You're not well.

776
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,162
(tense music)

777
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,750
(sighs)

778
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,328
(laughing)

779
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,920
(breathing heavily)

780
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,604
Oh great, it's home.

781
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,944
Maybe it's stress.

782
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,154
B12 deficiency.

783
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,899
A slight concussion.

784
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,656
I'm glad to be back.

785
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:07,908
Feels good.

786
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,831
(ominous music)

787
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,760
(Jim yelling)

788
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,301
(screaming)

789
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,175
(Conklin laughing)

790
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,034
Oh, my god.

791
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,839
(doorbell rings)

792
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,114
What's the problem, huh?

793
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,046
I didn't do it.

794
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:18,835
Okay.

795
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,382
Okay.

796
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,671
I didn't.

797
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,885
I didn't do it.

798
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,513
I didn't do it.

799
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,471
I didn't.

800
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,467
Of course you didn't do it.

801
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:30,308
It's all right.

802
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,677
You're awake now.

803
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,686
Awake?

804
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,806
Just another dream.

805
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,023
Thank God.

806
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,642
Thank God I didn't do it.

807
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,360
Of course not.

808
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,945
Same dream?

809
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,189
Same as what?

810
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,906
As the one last night,
and the night before,

811
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,616
and the night before.

812
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,162
Where am I?

813
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,701
You're in Lakeside, of course.

814
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,789
Lakeside Sanitarium.

815
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:56,251
Don't you remember, Mr. Martin?

816
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,370
No, I don't.

817
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,126
How did I get here anyway?

818
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,919
What am I doing here?

819
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,419
I would like to speak to
somebody in charge, please.

820
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,718
Well, how are we doing this morning?

821
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,010
It's you.

822
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,383
It's him.

823
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,384
He did it.

824
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:13,476
He killed them.

825
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,310
He killed them all.

826
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,144
Don't go.

827
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:15,978
No.

828
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,314
Get away from me, you maniac.

829
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,773
I don't know what's going on here, but.

830
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,108
Did I follow you?

831
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,352
Did I torment you?

832
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,150
Did I, perhaps, even kill your loved ones?

833
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,272
Yes, you did.

834
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,069
Good.

835
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,116
That's very frightening.

836
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,452
Those are very frightening thoughts.

837
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,695
Are you frightened?

838
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,618
Sometimes we have thoughts
that are so frightening,

839
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,914
we can't even admit to
ourselves that we have them.

840
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,333
The only way we can
deal with those thoughts

841
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,379
is to believe that somebody else has them.

842
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,501
Don't do that.

843
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:49,004
It's not reality yet, but it's progress.

844
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,303
Now, may I have your arm?

845
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,517
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

846
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,930
No, you don't.

847
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,179
No, you don't have to
get into any of this.

848
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,521
Now, Mr. Martin.

849
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,810
Dr. Martin.

850
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,774
All right, Dr. Martin.

851
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:04,524
No, no.

852
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,772
Get away from me.

853
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,450
You don't want me to call
Fred and Dewey, do you?

854
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,820
I don't care who you call.

855
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,867
Now, this has gone far enough.

856
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,207
Now, I demand that return my clothes

857
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,745
and tell me what's going on here.

858
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:22,212
And I warn you, my wife is a top attorney.

859
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,498
Fred, Dewey!

860
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,124
All right.

861
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:26,966
All right.

862
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:27,800
This can hurt.

863
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:29,882
(metal bangs)

864
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:30,675
Hear that?

865
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,395
(grunting)

866
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,982
I'm gonna sue you.

867
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,692
I'll sue all of you.

868
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,811
There.

869
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,778
That wasn't bad, was it?

870
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:49,739
Thank you, gentlemen.

871
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,074
Wait at the nurse's station.

872
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,364
I'll call you if I need you.

873
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,538
I wish that you would
stop treating me like.

874
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,329
What?

875
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,080
Like you're what, Mr. Martin?

876
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,627
Whoa.

877
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:09,422
I'm staring to feel a little racy.

878
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,635
Something...

879
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,225
That was no sedative you gave me.

880
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,686
You are the man who's following me.

881
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,519
I know that.

882
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,934
That's right.

883
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:25,480
In my best white suit stained with blood.

884
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,648
You killed Jim and Dana.

885
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:31,274
It's possible to be
distracted by too much detail.

886
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:35,243
For instance, your dream
could be very simple.

887
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,828
You create yourself as that

888
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,494
which you have always wanted to be.

889
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,617
But some part of you, or
some part of your mind,

890
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,994
is not very comfortable with that,

891
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,873
so you fragment into
another part called Halsey.

892
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:51,593
And in your dream, Halsey
becomes your patient,

893
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,554
as in actuality, you are my patient.

894
00:48:56,183 --> 00:49:00,223
But in real life, Mr.
Martin, there is no Halsey.

895
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,313
You are Halsey.

896
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,726
(ominous music)

897
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,119
(woman laughing)

898
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:21,081
(people chattering)

899
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,677
Now, do you think you can behave yourself?

900
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,135
I should think so.

901
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,349
All right.

902
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,058
You can unbuckle him.

903
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,224
Easy, easy.

904
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,652
You all right?

905
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,021
Yes.

906
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:53,818
Okay.

907
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,205
Toni.

908
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,546
Toni, it's you.

909
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,790
Of course, sir.

910
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,792
I'm here as always.

911
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,418
See, she knows me.

912
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,463
But...

913
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,972
What is this?

914
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,265
How did we get in my office?

915
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,684
Make yourself comfortable, Mr. Martin.

916
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,731
My office is your office.

917
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,774
You can sit in my chair of you'd like,

918
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,947
but I think you'd be more
comfortable over here.

919
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,867
Then I can close the door
and we can start our session.

920
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,911
You don't know what
you're talking about.

921
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,875
What, Mr. Martin?

922
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,588
Rex Francis Martin
born December 7th, 1956.

923
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,625
Pearl Harbor day in Chicago.

924
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,796
The oldest if three children.

925
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,840
My mother's name was Willoughby.

926
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,304
And that's a lithograph, 1548.

927
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,180
I graduated from the University of Chicago

928
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,475
and I have my MD and PhD in neuroscience

929
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,814
from the Miskatonic University.

930
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,309
Got married, Dana and I, in 1979.

931
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,527
She was a lucky catch.

932
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:19,275
We got married outdoors
in a garden, barefooted.

933
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,823
See, I drive a Volvo with 30,000 miles.

934
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,196
My shirt size is 17-35.

935
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,449
I have no scars, I have no birthmarks,

936
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,452
and I know where the wastepaper basket is.

937
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,543
(paper rattles in can)

938
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,333
Boom.

939
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:37,509
My office is in the Beaumont
Building, 8th floor.

940
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,298
And this is my office.

941
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,721
Now, will you kindly tell me who you are,

942
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,810
why you are here in my office,

943
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,646
and generally what is the meaning of this?

944
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,856
Those are very reasonable questions.

945
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,145
Very reasonable questions.

946
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,313
Of course, certainly.
- Thank you.

947
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,310
But before I do that,

948
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:56,857
I'd like you to have a
look at a few things.

949
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:57,695
Oh.

950
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,236
Now you say your office
is in the Beaumont Building.

951
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,232
You know very well it is.

952
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,074
The 8th floor?

953
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,363
- Yes, this is my office.
- That would be a city view.

954
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,201
This is my office.

955
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,035
A city view, yes?

956
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,246
I don't know how we got here.

957
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,409
Would you take a look out that window

958
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,874
and just tell me what you see?

959
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,918
(birds chirping)

960
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,385
No, it can't be.

961
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,380
It's all right.

962
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,222
I'm fine.

963
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,136
I know, I know you're fine.

964
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:26,974
It's all right.

965
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,434
Now just...

966
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:29,268
Over here.

967
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,728
Just look, please.

968
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,692
I can't believe it.

969
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,532
I'm sorry, I can't believe it.

970
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,526
You think you're being hoaxed?

971
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,949
Yes, I think there is
a very real possibility.

972
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,242
It's a very remote possibility, surely.

973
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,115
Why don't you sit down?

974
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,962
You say you're a man of science.

975
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,331
Can you think about this scientifically?

976
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,085
Excuse me, Dr. Ramsen.

977
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:01,881
Jim.

978
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,337
Jim, Jim, thank God.

979
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,714
Get me out of here.

980
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,135
There's a crazy mix up here.

981
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,508
You remember Jim, our accountant.

982
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,509
Accountant?

983
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,351
No.

984
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,686
Jim's a trained administrator.

985
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,897
He runs the whole R & D department.

986
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,141
Maybe some day, Mr. Martin.

987
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,313
Dr. Ramsen, it's Mr. Martin's account

988
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,481
I came to see you about.

989
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:23,152
You see, Mr. Conklin's way
behind on his payments.

990
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:23,944
Conklin?

991
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,775
Who's Conklin?

992
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,072
What's he got to do with my account?

993
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,320
You were his prize accountant.

994
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,322
I don't see how the mattress business

995
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,448
survives without you.

996
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:36,374
I don't think we need to
discuss this anymore in front of.

997
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,838
(tense music)

998
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,910
You've really been busy.

999
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,878
Must be very satisfying.

1000
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,754
Keep up the good work.

1001
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,466
Henry.

1002
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,422
No, no.

1003
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,890
Just don't get up.

1004
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,847
Are you lost?

1005
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:37,143
They sometimes send the
lost ones here to me.

1006
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,481
This is the lost and found.

1007
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,521
Well, it's my idea in the first place.

1008
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,769
Oh, it's very good.

1009
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,442
I'll take you.

1010
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,064
I know where to go.

1011
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,191
Without me, you'll never
choose the right door

1012
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:53,163
or you could be eaten
by a tiger. (laughing)

1013
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,165
[Rex] This is a closet here.

1014
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,375
[Woman] No, it's not.

1015
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,959
It's my office.

1016
00:54:58,962 --> 00:54:59,793
[Rex] This is a closet.

1017
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,130
These are clothes here and
I'd like to get out, please.

1018
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,499
[Woman] No, it's my
office, and you're my client,

1019
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,626
and you can't go.

1020
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,877
[Rex] There's some mistake.

1021
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,094
[Woman] Ow!

1022
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,053
[Rex] Get away from the door.

1023
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,845
(people shouting)

1024
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:33,112
(breathing heavily)

1025
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,579
(tense music)

1026
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,810
(people groaning)

1027
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,477
I see you've just
visited my little museum.

1028
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,688
Antique neurological devices are my hobby.

1029
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,648
Mankind's efforts to tame madness

1030
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,483
make a fascinating history.

1031
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,272
Museum?

1032
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,071
How can you do this to people?

1033
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,189
What people?

1034
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,451
These people.

1035
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,500
But I saw...

1036
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,003
What's this?

1037
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,212
People in cages.

1038
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,294
You've become overexcited.

1039
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,422
Perhaps a little shock
therapy will help you relax.

1040
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,263
(fingers snap)

1041
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,382
No, I think.

1042
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,097
Just a light one.

1043
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,766
(tone warbling)

1044
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:32,864
(electricity zapping)
(muffled screaming)

1045
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,990
(door creaking)

1046
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,545
Halsey.

1047
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,914
Shh.

1048
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,006
What are you doing here?

1049
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:55,800
They keep all of the psycho
killers on the same floor.

1050
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,843
Then it wasn't a dream.

1051
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:58,839
[Halsey] No.

1052
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,591
They just don't want to upset you.

1053
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,888
But I didn't do it.

1054
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,511
You don't need to tell me that.

1055
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:04,888
I know who did it.

1056
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,434
You've seen him.

1057
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,352
Who?

1058
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:11,069
You know who and he's
here in the hospital.

1059
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,947
Halsey, you're crazy.

1060
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,906
Hey.

1061
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:20,620
Residents of glass structures
ought not hurl projectiles.

1062
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,247
Now, listen to me.

1063
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,784
You be whoever they want you to be.

1064
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:27,626
You understand?

1065
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,710
It's the only way.

1066
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:29,579
All right.

1067
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,252
The more you resist, the
crazier they think you are.

1068
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:35,468
If they don't see any real progress,

1069
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,635
they're likely to take extreme measures.

1070
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,257
Now whatever you do,

1071
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,602
don't let them take you into surgery.

1072
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,810
(door closes)
Shit, it's them.

1073
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,063
I'll go hide in the closet.

1074
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:55,859
Okay.

1075
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,161
Halsey, come out.

1076
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,379
Coast is clear.

1077
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,882
Halsey.

1078
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:18,094
(ominous music)

1079
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:21,055
(breathing heavily)

1080
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,145
(door creaking)

1081
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:41,783
Oh, Halsey.

1082
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:42,618
Dr. Martin.

1083
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:43,862
Oh boy, am I glad to see you.

1084
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:44,988
Halsey, you gotta help me.

1085
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:45,829
Where am I?

1086
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:46,663
How long have we been?

1087
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,123
Settle down, settle down.

1088
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,867
They said that you didn't exist.

1089
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:50,709
I know.

1090
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,078
They said that we're the same person.

1091
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,546
I know the whole stinking story.

1092
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,210
They told me the same thing.

1093
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,048
They did?

1094
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,041
Yes siree Bob.

1095
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,385
They said you didn't exist.

1096
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,629
That I was a creation of your mind?

1097
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,427
Some sort of character in your dream?

1098
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,264
Right as rain.

1099
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,099
That's what they said.

1100
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,140
[Both] I know I'm real.

1101
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,976
(gasps)

1102
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:11,768
No.

1103
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,274
Oh, God.

1104
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,063
Yeah.

1105
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:18,571
Hey, have we done this before?

1106
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,406
Are we doing this now?

1107
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,402
(door closes)
Shit, it's them.

1108
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,903
I'll just duck into the closet.

1109
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:26,950
Don't go in the closet.

1110
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:27,788
Trust me.

1111
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,499
[Halsey] There's no place else.

1112
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,128
(tense music)

1113
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,128
(machine beeping)

1114
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:39,963
Dana?

1115
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,464
Wait a second.

1116
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,342
I know I'm here.

1117
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,342
[Dana] Rex.

1118
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,105
Fine.

1119
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:53,894
Great.

1120
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,398
PS, you've got brain damage.

1121
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,531
Oh, Christ.

1122
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:13,959
You dumb bastard.

1123
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:17,501
Why don't you ever look
where you're going?

1124
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,386
Oh, this should be interesting.

1125
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,386
You smarmy son of a bitch.

1126
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,182
Jesus.

1127
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,268
Dana?

1128
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:42,442
I can't watch this.

1129
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,949
Halsey, you still in there?

1130
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,871
(yells)

1131
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,211
(ominous music)

1132
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:00,002
Everything's gonna be all right.

1133
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,876
He's in the best possible hands.

1134
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,099
Dana, I just want you to
know I'm here for you.

1135
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,971
I always have been.

1136
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:16,768
Help me.

1137
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,475
I'm not dead yet.

1138
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,603
Did you hear that?

1139
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:30,115
(grunting)

1140
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:36,750
That's funny.

1141
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,621
I could've sworn I heard something.

1142
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:43,208
(panting)

1143
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,968

1145

01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,100
Halsey, where are we?

1149
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,194
We're in my brain.

1150
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,186
Your brain?

1151
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,654
Hey, don't bug me.

1152
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,364
I'm keeping my head above water.

1153
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,778
I'm maintaining.

1154
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,367
I am real, real busy here.

1155
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,611
(thunder rumbling)

1156
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,611
Hey, did you hear that.

1157
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,453
What?

1158
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,287
A storm's coming.

1159
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,122
A storm?

1160
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:15,956
A brainstorm.

1161
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,166
(laughs)

1162
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,251
Shit, that's no storm.

1163
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:20,665
What is it?

1164
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:23,130
Undersea monsters of the Id.

1165
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,750
Are they dangerous?

1166
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,628
Not to me, but then this
is my brain, my dream.

1167
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,550
You can't get hurt in your own dream.

1168
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,470
But you, you better watch.

1169
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,433
(yells)

1170
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:38,975
Halsey.

1171
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:39,768
Shit.

1172
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:06,256
What?

1173
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,090
And we're gonna kep on dumping on you

1174
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,881
till you get your ass out of here.

1175
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:10,844
What?

1176
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,883
You heard me.

1177
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:12,630
Move it.

1178
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,300
You're scaring off my customers.

1179
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,641
Make sure he's gone.

1180
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,433
He stinks.

1181
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,857
Look, if you want to
come back after we close,

1182
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,819
maybe we can get you some food

1183
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,235
from the kitchen or something.

1184
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,661
Hey, he's serious.

1185
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:39,577
If you're not out of here,
he's gonna call the cops.

1186
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,201
(subdued music)

1187
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,578
(tense music)

1188
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:11,548
(sighs)

1189
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,011
What the hell?

1190
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,566
Boom.

1191
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,193
(phone ringing)

1192
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,081
Hello?

1193
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,497
[Man On Phone] Ah, Dr. Halsey.

1194
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,541
Glad to find you back in your office.

1195
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,663
I'm not Halsey.

1196
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,539
[Man On Phone] (laughs) Of course not.

1197
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,337
You are in Dr. Halsey's office,

1198
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,677
you answer Dr. Halsey's private line,

1199
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,887
but you are not Dr. Halsey.

1200
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,427
Who is this?

1201
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:05,895
[Man On Phone] Wait right
there and you'll find out.

1202
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:17,068
Halsey.

1203
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:21,281
Halsey.

1204
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,988
Halsey.

1205
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,205
Halsey, Halsey.

1206
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:36,050
(suspenseful music)

1207
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,014
Okay.

1208
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:46,385
Well, hopefully he's still in there.

1209
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,887
Uh-uh.

1210
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,763
In tact this time, huh?

1211
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,273
Let's do it.

1212
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,279
Shit!

1213
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,741
Jack?

1214
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,703
Jack Halsey?

1215
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,623
How's the golf game?

1216
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,209
How's Mrs. Halsey and the kids?

1217
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,704
I haven't seen you in a while.

1218
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:14,922
It's me, Ellis.

1219
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,125
I'm, not Halsey.

1220
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:19,627
Repeat that.
- What?

1221
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,173
Repeat it!

1222
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,796
You're not Halsey.

1223
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:26,808
Thank you.

1224
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,850
(tense music)

1225
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,816
(breathing heavily)

1226
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,672
(man laughing)

1227
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:58,961
You cocksucker!

1228
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,584
I know I'm a cocksucker.

1229
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:01,927
(laughing)

1230
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,215
You.

1231
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,008
Hey.

1232
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,095
You!

1233
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,844
Hey!

1234
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:10,935
No, wait!

1235
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,804
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1236
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,614
(can clatters)

1237
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,588
[Man] Spare change?

1238
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:42,801
Do you know me?

1239
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:44,883
Sure.

1240
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,548
Yeah, sure.

1241
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:48,423
Sure, I do.

1242
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,269
Mr. John Q Public.

1243
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,011
No.

1244
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:55,894
No, you know me.

1245
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,562
You know who I am.

1246
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,524
You know me.

1247
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:00,903
You know me!

1248
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,568
Look, I don't know you from Adam,

1249
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:05,782
but I'll tell you something.

1250
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:10,029
You look like you got
Eunice written all over ya.

1251
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,406
(horn honks)

1252
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,245
Jim.

1253
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,122
Jim.

1254
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,333
Hey, Jim.

1255
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:22,629
Jim, Jim.

1256
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:24,801
Oh, thank God it's you.

1257
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,511
You just...

1258
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:27,550
You gotta help me.

1259
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:28,388
Hop in.

1260
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:29,347
All right.

1261
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:35,934
Oh, Jim.

1262
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,686
I've gotten so lost.

1263
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,605
Everything has gotten out of hand.

1264
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,568
I mean, get this.

1265
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,859
They think that I am Halsey.

1266
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,109
But then, I thought he killed you.

1267
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,701
No, I killed you.

1268
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:50,911
I killed somebody.

1269
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,825
And then Dana was there, too.

1270
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,368
Try to relax.

1271
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,662
It's just bad dreams.

1272
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,080
No, I'm not dreaming this.

1273
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,373
It's not a dream.

1274
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,837
I ruled that out.

1275
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,505
It's more like that I'm
being dreamed by Eunice.

1276
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,467
You too.

1277
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,508
Everybody, the whole thing, this car.

1278
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:12,098
We're all being dreamed by Eunice.

1279
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:15,139
For the universe is like a wet dream.

1280
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:21,559
By the perception of
illusion we experience reality.

1281
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,401
Are you experienced, Mr. Halsey?

1282
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:26,363
That's Mr. Conklin, Eunice security.

1283
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,357
He's been looking all over for you.

1284
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,029
All right.

1285
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,744
I'd like to tell you that
you have the wrong man.

1286
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:35,990
I'm sorry, Mr. Halsey,
but it's important.

1287
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,334
We really do need that equation.

1288
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:40,669
Where are you taking me?

1289
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:42,788
Home, to Lakeside.

1290
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:43,880
Where you belong.

1291
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,670
Farmhouse, this is The Shepard.

1292
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:46,666
We're coming in.

1293
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,545
Go.
(engine starts)

1294
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,387
Where should we begin?

1295
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,851
At the beginning, of course.

1296
01:11:58,356 --> 01:11:59,221
That's it.

1297
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,098
Just relax, Mr. Halsey.

1298
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,434
What do you want?

1299
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,811
Just the facts.

1300
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:12,484
I don't know what you're talking about.

1301
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,701
But you can't do this.

1302
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,744
We own you, Halsey.

1303
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,791
You, your ideas, your
thoughts, your very brain.

1304
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,288
It's all ours.

1305
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:26,164
You, Halsey, are a wholly on subsidiary

1306
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,462
of Eunice corporation.

1307
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:29,926
I'm not Halsey.

1308
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,511
Are you sure?

1309
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,551
Zhuang Zhou wondered whether he was a man

1310
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,049
dreaming of being a butterfly,

1311
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:38,552
or whether he was a butterfly
dreaming of being a man.

1312
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:41,055
Are you sure you're not a butterfly?

1313
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,398
This doesn't seem to be working.

1314
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,393
I don't see what we're
accomplishing here.

1315
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,395
He's of no use to us this way.

1316
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,361
[Woman] Just make sure no one else

1317
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,401
will ever get it out of him.

1318
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,274
Tabula rasa.

1319
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,492
The clean slate.

1320
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,736
Wait, let me try.

1321
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,328
Can you hear me?

1322
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,823
Halsey, can you hear me?

1323
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:00,665
Okay.

1324
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:01,658
Martin.

1325
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,995
Rex, can you hear me?

1326
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,833
It's me, Jim.

1327
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,250
I know who you are.

1328
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,046
Good.

1329
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:14,008
Now listen very carefully.

1330
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:17,258
It doesn't make any difference
anymore who you are.

1331
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:20,852
When you get out of here, you
can be whoever you want to be.

1332
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,312
We'll help you.

1333
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,851
Start a whole new life.

1334
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,190
You want to be a neurologist?

1335
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:26,808
Fine, you've got it.

1336
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,608
But you've got to work with us.

1337
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:34,533
Look, my ass is on the line, too.

1338
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,612
I could lose my job, but
you could lose much more.

1339
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,242
Much, much more.

1340
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:44,293
I don't know what you want.

1341
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:47,459
We want the right side of the equation.

1342
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,252
You erased it.

1343
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,749
Don't you remember?

1344
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:53,835
No.

1345
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,008
Well, you did.

1346
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,802
It was on a Monday.

1347
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:00,266
The last day you came to work.

1348
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,431
You'd had a tough weekend.

1349
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,646
Hard work killing and
dismembering your family.

1350
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,891
I mean, that's real aerobic exercise.

1351
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:10,144
Something to get the heart pounding.

1352
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,361
Ring any bells?

1353
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,781
It was three little numbers.

1354
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:15,991
What were they?

1355
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,112
Tell me, you dumb son of a bitch!

1356
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,079
Where's my wife?

1357
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:25,201
Just burn out the core and let's go.

1358
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,997
(electricity zapping)

1359
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,106
(tires squealing)

1360
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,317
(yelling)

1361
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:03,156
(glass shatters)

1362
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,372
[Doctor] Brace him, for God sake.

1363
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,866
[Man] EEG was very spiky.

1364
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:08,710
[Woman] Yeah, but the
screaming and the operation.

1365
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:11,956
[Doctor] He's just experiencing
a vivid dream, that's all.

1366
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,674
And we all know dreams can't hurt us.

1367
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,384
Dr. Martin?

1368
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:18,845
You called me Martin.

1369
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:20,555
[Doctor] Of course.

1370
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,760
Then I am Rex Martin.

1371
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,934
Yes, you're Dr. Rex Martin.

1372
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,851
Thank God.

1373
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,145
Thank God.

1374
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,652
I've been so lost.

1375
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,112
[Doctor] You've been in an accident.

1376
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,822
You're in surgery.

1377
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:40,568
You've had severe cerebral hemorrhaging.

1378
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:41,739
Zone?

1379
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,408
[Doctor] Rear visual.

1380
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:45,246
We just now isolated it.

1381
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,114
Seizures.

1382
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,413
I've been having seizures.

1383
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,627
[Doctor] Yes.

1384
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,416
Did I kill my wife?

1385
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,506
[Doctor] No, of course not.

1386
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:57,216
If you'll look through the glass there.

1387
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,505
Can you see her?

1388
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:02,172
And who's with her?

1389
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,594
Jim.

1390
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:08,641
Yes.

1391
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:11,606
They've all been very worried about you.

1392
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:15,569
I'm ready to go in now and see
if I can't repair the damage.

1393
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,687
All right?

1394
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:17,983
Right as rain.

1395
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:21,775
I'm in your hands, Doc.

1396
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,368
I'll adjourn your fee.

1397
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:26,989
After all, it's old man Conklin's money.

1398
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,206
Beg your pardon?

1399
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,952
Conklin Mattress Factory.

1400
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,294
They gave it to Halsey,
Halsey gives it to me,

1401
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,788
I give it to Ramsen.

1402
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:35,835
Just relax, Doctor.

1403
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:37,423
I'm a bit nervous myself.

1404
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,635
I've never operated on
another brain man before.

1405
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,379
Just do no harm.

1406
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:43,175
What?

1407
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,473
No harm done.

1408
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,388
(ominous music)

1409
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,613
(toilet flushes)

1410
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,053
(paper rattles in can)

1411
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:13,974
Boom.

1412
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:16,940
(suspenseful music)

1413
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:50,344
(breathing heavily)

1414
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:07,406
[Man] Doctor, we're losing pressure.

1415
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,617
[Doctor] Increase the O2.

1416
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,868
[Woman] It's cranial bleeding, Doctor.

1417
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:18,710
[Doctor] What are the numbers?

1418
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:19,543
No respiratory response.

1419
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:21,458
[Woman] It's down.

1420
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:22,455
(steady tone)

1421
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,331
Flatline, Doctor.

1422
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,629
[Doctor] This has stopped.

1423
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,636
Party's over.

1424
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,988
Well, at least he didn't feel any pain.

1425
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,584
(ominous music)

1426
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,530
[Rex] Where am I?

1427
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:35,112
Am I dreaming...

1428
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,656
or is this death?

1429
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:42,498
I'm dead.

1430
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,042
Great.

1431
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,426
I'm dead, I think.

1432
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:52,383
I think?

1433
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:58,427
