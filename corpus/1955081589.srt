that the first explosion,

also intended to bring folks to the scene

to get them while they were there.

to sweep the two adjacent buildings

347
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,228
anything pops up, you call it in
on the double. You got that?

348
00:34:49,328 --> 00:34:51,188
Copy.

349
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,925
Hey!

350
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,617
Got a body here. Just picking it up.

351
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,589
Son of a bitch.

352
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,762
Come on.

353
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,089
It's me. So you threw a tantrum
'cause I told you to sit?

354
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,792
I think I found something.
Centennial Park,

355
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,629
one of the eyewitnesses said something
about an EMT being on the scene.

356
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,089
Can you read that?

357
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,954
"EMT near the bag that was later found
to be the bag with the pipe bomb."

358
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:17,874
Okay, we're gonna see the same thing

359
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:20,511
- in the Birmingham bombing.
- So where's this coming from?

360
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,951
I've been trying to remember.

361
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:32,518
When Jax and I first entered the building,
we saw two men dressed as EMTs.

362
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,461
The guy that knocked me down
in the hallway

363
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,397
was wearing a blue jacket with patches.

364
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,431
Yeah, but that doesn't mean much.

365
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,932
The office manager in the Birmingham
bombing said that she found it odd

366
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:54,413
that there was an EMT on the scene
the day before looking around the explosion.

367
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:59,350
So you think one of the bombers was here
dressed as an EMT?

368
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,233
Okay, why would they come here?

369
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:05,056
Tie up loose ends? I mean,
they've already come after me once.

370
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,383
So you've seen others,
aside from the nurse?

371
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,996
Listen, I come around the corner

372
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:16,334
and this big son of a bitch throws me up
against a wall, and both of them armed.

373
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,637
Something's going on,
something's not right.

374
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,716
She said something about...

375
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,641
"Daniel wants me alive."

376
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,514
Okay.

377
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,050
So who's Daniel?

378
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,219
(STRUGGLING)

379
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,988
(SHUSHING) Be calm, Jude.

380
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:40,120
Be calm.

381
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,484
My name is Daniel.

382
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,599
If you promise me
that you can stay calm...

383
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,904
I'll remove the gag.

384
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,859
But if you break your promise...

385
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,873
do you understand me?

386
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:07,391
Stay calm, stay calm.
It's okay, Jude. It's okay.

387
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,121
(SHUSHING)

388
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,973
Here we go,

389
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:14,495
there we go, that's better.

390
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:18,207
I want to take this moment,
I want to talk to you...

391
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:20,700
about our Lord God.

392
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,131
Are you a believer, Jude?

393
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,644
It's a very simple question, Jude,
there's no right or wrong answer.

394
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:38,105
Do you believe in the Lord, our God?

395
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,519
No.

396
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,088
I don't know. I did when I was a kid.

397
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,224
That's okay.

398
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,281
That's okay, Jude.

399
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,209
That's a very familiar tale these days.

400
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,623
But if I were you I think now would be
the time for you to resume your faith.

401
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:05,873
- What do you want?
- Have no fear, Jude.

402
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:09,614
For those that fear our God trust our God.

403
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,218
Your helpers trust your ruler.

404
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,122
Jude, we're here to give you freedom.

405
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:20,387
Freedom, Jude.

406
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,863
I heard that shit before!
Wait, what are you doing?

407
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:30,167
Let me go! Fuck you! Fuck you, honky!

408
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,101
Fuck your God! (SCREAMING)

412
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,300

- Alright, that's almost identical to...
- Your parents' church.

417
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,891
I thought that was all race-related.

- (DOOR OPENS)
- Yeah, me, too.

419
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,199
- They came for him.
- Who came for who?

420
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,463
For Ben.

421
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,266
Found it, here you go.

422
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,998
But, wait, I don't understand,
I thought that we just...

423
00:40:48,098 --> 00:40:50,490
needed people who didn't believe.

424
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:53,707
Yes, we do, but he's different.

425
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,471
But we're exposed out in the open.

426
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:00,856
Do you want to take a vow
of silence like Jude?

Ah!

- We thought you was them.
- Isaac... your hand doesn't look good.

429
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,774
Nah, nothing but a scratch,
had it worse in the war.

430
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,633
- So, Jude never came back?
- No.

431
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,014
- Who are these people?
- These are friends.

432
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:27,752
We got to get Isaac's hand fixed up.
You stay with these guys. I'm gonna go...

433

No, no, no, no, no.
I'll go get a doctor, you stay here.

434
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,892
Ben, it doesn't sound
like a really good idea, man.

435
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,783
They're not looking for you.
They're looking for me. I'll be right back.

- Okay, tell me what happened.
- It was a nurse.

439

They came up to us
and they asked for Ben by name.

440

- Why?
- I don't know.

No, I don't think so.

different from mine. Ah...

Now, Benjamin...

459
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:13,398
I would very much like to remove
your gag but in doing so...

460
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:18,775
you need to promise me
that you will not scream.

had consumed them.

482

you protect a false God.

And that...

510
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:18,931
is the only eternal sin.
