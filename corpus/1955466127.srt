1
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,868
That was my husband's Ford Galaxy.

2
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,790
We drove Jamie home...

3
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,713
from the hospital in that car.

4
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,836
My mom was 40 when she had me.

5
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,941
Everyone told her the she was
too old to be a mother.

6
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,204
I put my hand through the little
window and he squeezed my finger.

7
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:24,201
And I tell 'em, life was very big.

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,904
And unknown.

9
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,668
And she told me that
there were animals.

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,972
And sky and cities.

11
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,420
Music.

12
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,000
Movies.

13
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,969
He'd fall in love.

14
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:39,245
Have his own children.
Have passions.

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,346
Have meaning.

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,948
Have his mom and dad.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,601
And they got divorced...

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,873
My father moved back east
and left the car with us.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,977
He calls on birthdays and Christmas.

20
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,255
Last time I felt close to him,

21
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,930
was on my birthday in 1974.

22
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,763
He bought me mirrored sun glasses.

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,898
I saw the President fall downstairs.

24
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,709
And I threw up on the carpet.

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,667
Since then it's just been us.

26
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:12,754
You will go up to that plane.

27
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:18,270
No Richard no, what has
happened to you last night...

28
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,736
Listen, Captain.

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,094
I am having a party tonight,
it's my birthday actually.

30
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:33,001
And I would like you to drop by,
So I can feed you.

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,771
It's not necessary, Ms. Fields.

32
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,263
No, Dorothea, no... I insist.

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,420
Please.

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,145
It was a beautiful car.

35
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,960
Mom, It smelled like gas
and overheated all the time.

36
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,745
It was just old.

37
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,460
What?

38
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,570
Well, it wasn’t always old.
Just got that way all of a sudden.

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,018
You know?

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,551
When the firemen come...

41
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,029
people don't usually invite them for dinner.

42
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,748
Yeah, why not?

43
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,957
I can't just move on...

44
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,630
be happy with my life, and...

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,838
bring blame on him.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,430
That just makes me feel like
I'm not good enough.

47
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,839
It is inconsistently
being compared to my dad.

48
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:38,837
Hey, sorry.

49
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,777
Jamie's not here right now.

50
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,005
They are not home.

51
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,958
Don't.

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,903
I'm taking a picture of everything
that happens to me in a day.

53
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,633
I don't like having my pictures taken.

54
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,988
I didn't happen to you.

55
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,434
Hello.

56
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,680
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

57
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,050
Here.

58
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,381
You aren't gonna believe...

59
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,664
- what happened.
- What?

60
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,880
Our car burst into flames
in the parking lot.

61
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:39,948
Eh...

62
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,995
- Seriously?
- Are you okay?

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,534
Yeah, we are okay.

64
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,009
How did it happen?

65
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,313
I don't know. They said it was
probably just something electrical.

66
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,556
We walked down and it
was just sitting there.

67
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,981
On fire.

68
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,075
Oh Man!

69
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,814
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

70
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
So...

71
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,380
What happened...?

72
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,971
They never tell you, anything.

73
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:06,495
I will know anything for
like a week.

74
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,342
And I'm..
I'm gonna be late on rent.

75
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,529
That's okay, don't worry about that.

76
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,050
Thanks.

77
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,503
Oh God!

78
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,283
What if you've been in the car?

79
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,385
I wouldn't be here.

80
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,831
You would've missed me?

81
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,646
Don't joke.

82
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,175
It's so much easier
before you got all horny.

83
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,214
- But it's not like you don't...
- Do what?

84
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,021
Friends can have sex and still be friends.

85
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,664
I like us, like we are, okay?

86
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Okay.

87
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,012
Jamie, Could you come help me
set out please?

88
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,313
Can my mom just chill out?

89
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,702
She is compensating for her loneliness.

90
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,578
Dorothea,
All that is really beautiful moulding.

91
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:47,167
It is.

92
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,771
I wanna continue
that around the side.

93
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,644
Well,
we are gonna have to rematch that.

94
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:52,794
Now is that...
Is that actually wood?

95
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:55,251
- Or is that plaster?
- The plaster is underneath it.

96
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:59,384
The moulding on the outside. There is wood.
Okay. It's gonna take a little bit of time.

97
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,533
- But...
- We got.

98
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,893
Okay, no, it's good.

99
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,894
Actually, it was built in 1905.

100
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,657
And the same family had it forever,

101
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:09,450
but they lost all their money
during the war.

102
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,597
And then there was a fire and...

103
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,073
They should have been hit with that.

104
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,250
Anyway.

105
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,943
So... It was just a mess,
they've let it fall apart.

106
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,153
Then a bohemian inherited it in '60s...

107
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:21,094
and free spirits moved down.

108
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:22,992
- And they lost it to the bank.
- Beautiful.

109
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,443
I completely fell in love with them...

110
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,911
We are connected to the dirt,

111
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,656
'cause we came from the dirt.
The dirt is made of stars.

112
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,601
and started out the
same way that we are.

113
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:32,323
So...

114
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:35,604
When you put your hands into that...

115
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,805
Dirt and feel the Earth Mother.

116
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,460
William...

117
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,453
It look as though,
I'm gonna be in need of a car.

118
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,726
Do you think that you have
something for me out there?

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,951
Cheap?
Maybe that '49 Deluxe.

120
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,728
I think we can work something out,

121
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:56,608
Maybe we'll trade for rent or something.

122
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,160
- Thank you.
- Sure

123
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,112
Okay, got through that one.

124
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,722
Alright, just um.. give me a minute.

125
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,918
And then come out.

126
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,619
My mom was born in 1924.

127
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,074
When she was my age, people...

128
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:45,753
drove in sad cars to sad houses.

129
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:48,398
With old phones,
no money or food.

130
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,923
Or televisions.

131
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,339
But people were real.

132
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,104
And when she was 16...

133
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,527
the war broke out and
she had to leave school.

134
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,674
Her dream was to be a
pilot in the Air Force.

135
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,310
She actually went to the flight school.

136
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,141
But the war ended
before she was done.

137
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,343
She became the first
woman to work...

138
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:11,732
In the continental Can
company drafting room.

139
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,543
Then she met my dad.

140
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,849
And then I came.

141
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,484
And they got divorced.

142
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,440
But people from her time...

143
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,738
never admit anything went wrong.

144
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,919
What do you mean?

145
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,861
I'm sorry, he is too young to have...

146
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,276
an account in his name only.

147
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Little guy.

148
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,731
No, he's a person,
he's not half a person.

149
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,461
And he's not some cute little guy.

150
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,658
He has vision, autonomy and privacy.

151
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,077
He needs a bank account.

152
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,101
Can you do that for us?

153
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,541
Jamie, you can't just keep skipping...

154
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:47,771
the school and making excuses.

155
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,482
Wait a minute, why not?

156
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,995
Why you can't he just skip school?

157
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,613
If he has a legitimate need to be away.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,729
Well, the I need a
"legitimate" real note from you.

159
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,109
- okay.
- With your real signature.

160
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,702
Wow,
how did you forged my signature so well?

161
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,997
That is ingenious!

162
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,280
But you should never forge
someone's signature...

163
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:12,135
..Do anything behind someone's back.

164
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,701
Please excuse Jamie from
school this morning.

165
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:19,234
He was doing volunteer
work for the Sandinistas.

166
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,481
Please excuse Jamie from
school this morning.

167
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,819
He was involved in a
small plane accident.

168
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,902
Fortunately, He was not hurt.

169
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,634
Will be for a legendary surprise.

170
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,079
It's mahogany underneath.

171
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:33,699
She's always trying to bring
a man into my life.

172
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,350
This is probably Honduran mahogany,

173
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,473
- Really fine grain.
- This is like, really really boring.

174
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,114
Hey, Come on! Watch it.

175
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:42,776
He's going over like woods and stuffs.

176
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,002
He's helping me out
restore the house, okay?

177
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:46,035
IBM.

178
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,890
She writes down her stocks every morning.

179
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,567
$213.20.

180
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,118
GE?

181
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,148
$51.62.

182
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,889
She smokes Salem,
because they are healthier.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,631
Wears Birkenstocks because
she is contemporary.

184
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,759
She read "Watership Down"...

185
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,860
And learned how to carve
rabbits out of wood.

186
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,487
And she never dates a man for very long.

187
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,578
Thank you, Popeye.

188
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:12,680
Good night, Dorothea.

189
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,534
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So I'll see you later.

191
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,878
Just don't hang with that Chris guy anymore,
okay?

192
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:21,471
And he's kinda dumb.

193
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,919
Exactly.

194
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,436
- Happy Birthday.
- Bye, Julie.

195
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,710
Stop.

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,005
What?

197
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,945
You think that you know
everything that's going on.

198
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:38,834
No, I just think that...

199
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,898
You know having your heart broken, is a...

200
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,761
tremendous way to learn about the world.

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Okay.

202
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,243
Do you think you're happy?

203
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,431
Like...

204
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,282
As happy as you thought you'd be
when you were at my age.

205
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,569
Seriously?

206
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,881
You don't ask people question like that.

207
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,484
You're my mom.

208
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,676
Especially your mom.

209
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,905
Look. Wondering if you are happy...

210
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:15,719
It's a great shortcut
to just being depressed.

211
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,050
Give me that.

212
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,255
What is that?

213
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,408
It's the "The Raincoast".

214
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,904
Can't things just be pretty?

215
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,831
"Pretty music" is used to hide...

216
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,794
how unfair and corrupt society is.

217
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,502
Okay so.

218
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,895
They are not very good.

219
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:27,692
And they know that, right?

220
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,325
Yeah.

221
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,643
It's like they have got
all these feelings.

222
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:35,798
And they don't have any skill,
and they don't want skill

223
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:37,470
because it's really interesting.

224
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:41,307
What happens when your passion is bigger...

225
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,855
than the tools that you have...

226
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:43,895
to deal with it.

227
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,218
It creates this energy.

228
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,590
This..this.this rock.

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,160
Isn't it great?

230
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,448
My son was born in 1964.

231
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,414
He grew up with a meaningless war.

232
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,252
With protests.

233
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,840
With Nixon.

234
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,573
With nice cars and nice houses.

235
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,997
Computers.

236
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,196
Drugs.

237
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,934
Boredom.

238
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,770
I know him less everyday.

239
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,470
He said it was just a game.

240
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,713
You breath real hard and
another kid pulls on your diaphragm.

241
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:52,002
And you faint.

242
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,074
He said you're supposed to
come to a few seconds later.

243
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,143
- Can I try?
- Yeah.

244
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:06,239
But it took Jamie almost
a half an hour to wake up.

245
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,692
Go and get help.

246
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,644
Can you tell me your name?

247
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,506
Jamie.

248
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,368
Jamie, why would you do something?

249
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,733
So dangerous?

250
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,329
I don't know.

251
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,962
I mean, everyone was doing it.

252
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,529
So you just went along with it?

253
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,977
It looked like fun.

254
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,063
That's just dumb,
why would you do something so stupid?

255
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,038
Just following along?

256
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,010
Do you know you
almost died..

257
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:46,684
Right?

258
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,341
- You don't need worry about me.
- Why didn't you think?

259
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,929
Jamie, Hey.

260
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,710
Jamie.

261
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,379
What is going on?
Wait.

262
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,435
What? You are not gonna talk to me now?

263
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,979
I'm not the one who doesn't talk.

264
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,213
What?

265
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,480
Come on!

266
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,937
You scared the hell out of me.

267
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,609
Why did you hurt yourself like that?

268
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,140
Why do you smoke yourself to death?

269
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,307
Hey.

270
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,763
Why are you fine
being sad and alone?

271
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:26,339
I...

272
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:30,089
I... You...

273
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,751
You can't talk to me like that.
We don't...

274
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:33,982
You don't say that to me.

275
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,577
I think History has been tough on men.

276
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,096
I mean they can't be what they were.
And they can't figure out what's next.

277
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,309
What are we talking about?

278
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:40,442
Men?

279
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,118
I think history and men.

280
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,638
I mean,
who are your heroes now a days?

281
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:47,666
A bunch of privileged
drug addicts?

282
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:50,062
I think maybe you guys
can help me with Jamie.

283
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,765
I think...

284
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,642
He needs help in figuring out...

285
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,691
how to be himself in all this mess.

286
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,430
And I can't be there.

287
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,378
I can't be there with him.

288
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,715
I have to let go.

289
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,095
Is this because the fainting thing?

290
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,648
He's fine.

291
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:09,024
No. It's because of everything.

292
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,094
I don't understand
what are you asking?

293
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,190
How do you be a good man?

294
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,233
What does that even mean now a days?

295
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,526
He has only got me.

296
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
It's just...

297
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,586
Think about it, it's not enough.

298
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,906
You are serious.

299
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,762
- Yeah.
- What about William?

300
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,482
William's a guy.
That's...

301
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,284
He can talk to him about guy things.

302
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:34,151
Have you ever seen them have a conversation?

303
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,357
They have nothing in common,
they don't connect.

304
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,527
It's just not working.

305
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,749
I mean, I thought about that.

306
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:39,842
He...

307
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,554
Well, He likes you.

308
00:20:42,587 --> 00:20:44,305
And you, He likes you a lot.

309
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:44,877
That...

310
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,831
That's my friend,
I don't wanna be his mom.

311
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,827
Yeah, no, I'm his mom.

312
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,517
I mean, Don't you need a man to raise a man?

313
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:57,126
No I don't think so.

314
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,050
I mean...

315
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,270
I think You are what's gonna work for him.

316
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,053
I mean...

317
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,642
You know him better than anyone.

318
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,090
You know that.

319
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,255
And...

320
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,207
You care about him,
You can watch out for him.

321
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,730
And you... just share your life.

322
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:23,067
You're talented person,
show them you're interested in care.

323
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,748
You know he will be lucky to have that.

324
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,036
Help me with what?

325
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,251
All goes through this
part of your life, it's not easy.

326
00:21:48,284 --> 00:21:49,485
It's not easy for anybody.

327
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,386
- You asked them to help me?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,189
No, they..
They get it.

329
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,315
So they said yes?

330
00:21:58,414 --> 00:21:59,414
Yeah.

331
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,183
Fuck!

332
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,216
Hey...

333
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,306
You just feel guilty cause
it's just me and you.

334
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,213
You don't know what I'm feeling.

335
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,035
Just tell me.

336
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,221
Kid.

337
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,912
You never tell me
what you're gonna do.

338
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,139
You just do it.

339
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,734
I got the keys to my step mom's car.

340
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,741
Tanya and Michelle,
are both gonna be there.

341
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,490
Hey, you guys going to L.A.?

342
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,290
Yeah.

343
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:46,461
I am.

344
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,111
Can I come?

345
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:53,212
Listen all.
You ready?

346
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:54,736
We gonna...

347
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,808
That was Jamie.

348
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,960
He is in L.A.

349
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,602
He and some friends went to a show.

350
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,744
- Oh.
- Yeah.

351
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:31,837
He wanted to tell you.

352
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,572
Okay.

353
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,612
Aren't you worried?

354
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,791
He's mad at me.
And This is his way of dealing with it.

355
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,855
And he has every right to be mad.

356
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,943
Yeah, but if it makes him this mad,
then maybe it wasn't a good idea.

357
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,442
Maybe...

358
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,205
Maybe I did the wrong thing.

359
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:44,681
I...

360
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,080
- With the kid, I mean.
- Yeah I know.

361
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,848
I think that Jamie's energy is very...

362
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,797
Unstable.

363
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,664
Well, you're right.
Then there's an energy crisis, maybe that...

364
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,194
Plays into it someway.

365
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,850
I'm sorry.

366
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,495
You don't have very..
many funny lines do you?

367
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
Okay.

368
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,598
Jamie...

369
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,590
Jamie.

370
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
Hey.

371
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,170
Hey.

372
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,536
Everything okay?

373
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:26,569
Yeah.

374
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,170
Can I come in?

375
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,590
Sure.

376
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,908
So I had this new idea for my photography.

377
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:38,992
I was gonna...

378
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,974
take a picture of everything...

379
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,783
That I own,
so it will be self-portrait.

380
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:45,177
Myself...

381
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:47,050
through the stuff that I have.

382
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,661
Can I show you?

383
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:54,095
So...

384
00:26:54,211 --> 00:27:00,969
Bra, birth control,
On Photography by Susan Sontag, Shoes.

385
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,736
Underwear.

386
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,961
a picture of a picture of my mom.

387
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,584
I'm gonna do a bunch of them.

388
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,119
It's a little bit...

389
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:12,549
It's a little bit sad.

390
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,481
You know, all these stuff together...

391
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,286
I don't know why that is.

392
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,517
None, I mean...

393
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,752
You know what I mean?

394
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,826
It's really beautiful, Abbie.

395
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,576
Do you wanna fool around with me?

396
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,979
Really?

397
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:39,686
Yeah.

398
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:44,461
Yeah.

399
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,090
I do.

400
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,333
You know..
I'm recovering from cervical cancer.

401
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
I know.

402
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,121
Your hair smells good.

403
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,940
I make my own shampoo.

404
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,406
Of course you do.

405
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,649
It's OK Jeeves, he's back.

406
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,551
You can relax now.

407
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,020
Where were you?

408
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,450
We went to the Starwood,
saw a show.

409
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,812
You know, in LA
I had a lot of fun.

410
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,165
Are you drunk?

411
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Don't.

412
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,210
What's wrong?

413
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,316
Tim Drammer came inside me.

414
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,264
I don't wanna hear this shit.

415
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,229
We broke into that old pool at the
rec center.

416
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,096
Got loaded.

417
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,656
Fucked around.

418
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,912
And me and Tim ended up in his mom's
Maverick.

419
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,302
Did you just cum?

420
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,210
Yeah.

421
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,237
You said you would pull out.

422
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,391
Yeah.

423
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,336
Sorry.

424
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,420
Thought we had a deal there.

425
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Fuck!

426
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,076
What're you gonna do?

427
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,675
It'll be fine.

428
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,161
Your mom asked me to like, help, raise you.

429
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,337
Yes I know.

430
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,405
She was raised in the Depression.

431
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,095
everyone helped raise everyone.

432
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,947
You know, the whole neighborhood
raised the kids.

433
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,955
Sorry.

434
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,110
Can we do therapy?

435
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,146
Jesus, I don't want to do
therapy right now

436
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,847
- Let's role play.
- Please no.

437
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,646
I'll be your mom, and you can
tell her what you wanna tell her.

438
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,570
Just do it.

439
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,350
- I don't want to talk to my mom.
- What would you say to her?

440
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,341
Okay.

441
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,251
I don't need your help, Mom.

442
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,458
I've got it.

443
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,522
I'm okay.

444
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,724
I, I'm gonna need a story.

445
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What?

446
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,613
A story.

447
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,677
- What do you mean?
- Like...

448
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,250
A story.

449
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,976
Where...

450
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,253
I'm just a normal woman.

451
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:20,364
and...

452
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,677
you're a photographer.

453
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,449
And you're photographing me, but...

454
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,969
While you are doing it...

455
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,214
You can't help yourself and
you start touching me.

456
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:33,856
And...

457
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,534
You touch me.

458
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:38,470
And you...

459
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Say...

460
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,241
I'm sorry.

461
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,271
I'm sorry.

462
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,770
Really?

463
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,218
I'm can't just be myself?

464
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,214
No.

465
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,913
- Okay, so...?
- Nice to meet you.

466
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,439
Oh, hi, Do I just look in the camera?

467
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,152
- Or should I look off to the side?
- Let's start that way...

468
00:33:06,186 --> 00:33:07,592
- looking in the camera.
- Okay.

469
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,625
Should I smile?

470
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,128
Do you like to smile?

471
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:11,396
- Yeah.
- Okay.

472
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,430
Okay.

473
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,325
Oh, you took it. I thought you are gonna
say like 1, 2, 3...

474
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:19,544
- No. I just wait for the moment.
- Okay.

475
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:22,065
I just have to fix something.

476
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
It's right here.

477
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,099
- I am sorry.
- Not it's alright.

478
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,327
I don't mind.

479
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,994
I've just never done this before.

480
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:31,404
So...

481
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,599
I'm still little bit nervous.

482
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:34,632
But...

483
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,416
- I can wear my hair differently.
- Abbie.

484
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,625
Yeah?

485
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,609
I'm sorry.

486
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,152
I'm really sorry.

487
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,933
Julie and I have been
friends since we were little.

488
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,708
She likes to say she's self
destructive.

489
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,570
His mother is a therapist.

490
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,145
We used to talk and I...

491
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,350
She makes Julie attend her teen group
sessions.

492
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:34,555
What about the possibility?

493
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,021
That you're choosing boys
who are inappropriate?

494
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,097
Unconsciously.

495
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,037
When her mother remarried, Julie
changed.

496
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:46,925
When her half sister
Amanda was born...

497
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,010
with Cerebral Palsy, she changed more.

498
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,085
You know what I mean.

499
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,672
Wow. It looks really pretty on you,
it just makes your whole face pop.

500
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,137
Like soda pop.

501
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,555
She started fooling around.

502
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,681
She started sneaking into my house.

503
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,392
Sleeping over.

504
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,163
- Because you did?
- Because I'm crazy.

505
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,859
You want to be crazy.

506
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,418
Scratch me.

507
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,930
We should go up the coast somewhere.

508
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,178
Just me and you.

509
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,537
Julie works at the La Cumbre Plaza
mall.

510
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,249
Spring rain features cinnamon,
jasmine, lily-of-the-valley and rose.

511
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,694
Sex is commitment.

512
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,759
once you're there,
you cant go back to holding hands.

513
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,746
and once you give yourself
both mentally and physically...

514
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,145
well, you're completely vulnerable.

515
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,710
All he cares about is his
new wife and her birthday.

516
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,803
And Christmas with her and her family.

517
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,632
And inviting all of her family.

518
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:16,526
Spring rain features cinnamon,
jasmine, lily-of-the-valley and rose.

519
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,086
Of all the misconceptions about
love...

520
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:24,230
the most powerful and persuasive is
the belief that falling in love...

521
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,776
is love.

522
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,560
or at least one of the manifestations of
love.

523
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,284
Love is supposed to be a feeling
that you feel.

524
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,440
People say that they're falling in love...

525
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,501
but they're not actually falling in
love.

526
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,041
It's a fake connection that
you feel with some.

527
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,061
and marriage should never happen.

528
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,462
<i>YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED,
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU.</i>

529
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,119
<i>DIE!</i>

530
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,307
Hey, Julie.

531
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,680
- Hey.
- Hi.

532
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,668
So come on in.

533
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:39,113
It's Okay, come in.

534
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,055
He's not up yet.

535
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,158
He got in kinda late.

536
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,969
Hey you wanna help me
bring this stuff in?

537
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,983
So is Jamie okay?

538
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,265
Yeah.

539
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,510
He's okay.

540
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,028
I heard by him come in last night.

541
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,128
I was awake.

542
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Right.

543
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,273
Yea, I was just, couldn't sleep.

544
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:12,059
so I was, you know, listening for him.

545
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,749
How was the show?

546
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,087
Good.

547
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,865
Next time you take a trip,

548
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:34,559
just let me know, okay?

549
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:36,368
I won't make too much dinner.

550
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,773
Hey, do the stocks with me?

551
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,250
Yeah.

552
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,042
Okay, IBM.

553
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,243
IBM, $69.73

554
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,140
Xerox.

555
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,590
You okay?

556
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,972
Xerox, $53.92.

557
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:16,605
- Stop.
- Okay, $ 53.92.

558
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,727
Listen.

559
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,340
Abbie has her appointment
today and I can't be here...

560
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:22,151
And I have to go to work.

561
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,394
So I was hoping that
maybe you could be here.

562
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,929
When she gets back.

563
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,055
In case she needs support.

564
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,697
She is going through a lot.

565
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,097
Okay, What if it's..

566
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,599
Like bad news or something?

567
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,704
Well, you can handle it or if you can't...

568
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,978
You have to start somewhere.

569
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,737
Men always feel like they have to

570
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,144
fix things for women...

571
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:47,431
But they are not doing anything.

572
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,919
But some things just can't be fixed.

573
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,868
Just be there...

574
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,990
Somehow, that's hard for you all.

575
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,506
Mom, I'm not "all men".

576
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,665
Okay. I'm just me.

577
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,654
Yes and no.

578
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,745
And if I have to have full on chemo?

579
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,885
Or get a hysterectomy?

580
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,319
Do you know what that is?

581
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,854
Look,I should just go with you.
You know, I mean..

582
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,128
Your mom did tell me to share my
life with you.

583
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,267
Yeah I know.

584
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,803
You don't...

585
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,283
Don't worry 'bout it, she just...

586
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,121
She's from The Depression.

587
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,850
Yeah.

588
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,040
It's good news Abbie.

589
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,847
There were no malignant cells.

590
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,003
Your biopsy is benign.

591
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,692
And.. in the future?

592
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,582
There was damage to the muscle wall.

593
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,756
From the surgery.

594
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,274
You have an incompetent cervix.

595
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,589
Incompetent?

596
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,531
It may not be strong enough...

597
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:28,424
to go full term during pregnancy.

598
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,620
As the baby grows...

599
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,576
the cervix widens.

600
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,099
If it's weakened,
it's likely to open prematurely.

601
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,665
I'm gonna be OK.

602
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,509
He said that I probably
can't have kids.

603
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,294
Was having Jamie like...

604
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,778
the biggest thing that
ever happened to you?

605
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,980
I guess so.

606
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,503
Sorry.

607
00:42:12,536 --> 00:42:13,671
No.

608
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,673
You'll get through this.

609
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,749
You will get through it.

610
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,451
You will do it.

611
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,066
This is the really hard part.
And then what happens is.

612
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,077
there's a hard part and then it
gets better.

613
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,367
And then it gets hard
again, but never mind.

614
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,716
I should not have told you that part.

615
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,441
I should've just said it gets better
and then..That's it.

616
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:52,475
But...

617
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,153
You got birds?

618
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,682
Is that ok?

619
00:42:55,716 --> 00:42:56,716
Yes.

620
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,414
So did you name them?

621
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,249
Not yet.

622
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,151
They are a boy and a girl.

623
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:08,865
And, that, they are monogamous for life.

624
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:09,957
So...

625
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,280
If one of them dies, then the other one...

626
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,175
He will die like a week later.

627
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,215
How about Maximilian and Carlotta?

628
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:23,103
Right, I...

629
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,676
You know, They deserve something grand.

630
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,023
they're gonna be monogamous their
whole lives.

631
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,887
Right?

632
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,430
Max and Carlotta are
really good names.

633
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,951
So...

634
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,634
You went to the doctor's and
you waited with her.

635
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,685
Yeah.

636
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,409
But I told you to wait here.

637
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,148
I..um...

638
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,886
I thought it would be better to...

639
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,389
go and really be there.

640
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,642
She is really upset.

641
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,713
That must have been a lot to deal with.

642
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,300
I'm fine.

643
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm good.

644
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:21,906
I...

645
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,213
I learned a lot

646
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,239
Abigail Porter.

647
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,457
Home pregnancy tests that...

648
00:44:36,544 --> 00:44:38,516
Women can do safely and easily.

649
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,683
A small revolution for...

650
00:44:40,717 --> 00:44:43,350
women seeking to take
control of their lives.

651
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,931
What the fuck is this?

652
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,132
It's a pregnancy test.

653
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,239
Abbie's doctors said that...

654
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,919
She wouldn’t be able to have kids.

655
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,323
Why'd she take you?

656
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,888
- Is that all of it?
- Yeah.

657
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,602
That's a lot.

658
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,550
Now what?

659
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,801
Shake for 10 seconds.

660
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,380
Okay.

661
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,469
Leave undisturbed for 2 hours.

662
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,199
2 hours?

663
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,699
that's what it says.

664
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,020
Okay. If it appears then
you're positive,

665
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:15,912
And if no ring appears here
then the test is negative.

666
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,222
What do we do for two hours?

667
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,489
Guy's don't smoke like that.
Don't hold it like that.

668
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Like...

669
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:34,492
This.

670
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,455
Between your two fingers.

671
00:46:36,488 --> 00:46:37,902
- That?
- Yes, that's better.

672
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,508
Okay now, walk,

673
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,703
do like a cool cigarette walk.

674
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:59,001
Guys aren't supposed look like they're
thinking about what they look like.

675
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,607
Watch me.

676
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:11,910
See?

677
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,814
Smoking is gross.

678
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,320
No, it's not.

679
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,694
Gives you cancer.

680
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,000
This is just my opinion,
I think being strong..

681
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:26,399
..is the most important quality.

682
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,130
It's not being vulnerable,
It's not being sensitive.

683
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,209
It's not even...
Honestly, it's not even being happy.

684
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,419
It's about strength.

685
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,913
And your durability
against the other emotions.

686
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,859
No ring.

687
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:53,712
No ring.

688
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,352
- Hey.
- Hey.

689
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,621
Thanks for going with me.

690
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,566
Yeah, totally.

691
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,008
I made you this.

692
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,257
- It's a mixed tape.
- Yep.

693
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:21,794
These are bunch of songs,
that I think my life...

694
00:48:21,827 --> 00:48:24,573
would have been better
if they would have been around.

695
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:26,843
When I was a teenager.

696
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,403
So I'm hoping,
that if you listen to them, now...

697
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,959
you'll be a happier and
more realized person...

698
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,259
than I could ever hope to be.

699
00:48:43,148 --> 00:48:44,919
From that night on...

700
00:48:44,952 --> 00:48:47,050
Abbie started telling me
everything.

701
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,314
She grew up in Santa Barbara.

702
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,121
Where everyone is happy.

703
00:48:52,154 --> 00:48:54,168
but that just made her feel crazy.

704
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,687
In 1973 she moved to New York City...

705
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,920
and went to Art school.

706
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,896
New York City made her feel same.

707
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,630
She was so fucked up.

708
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,796
She fell in love with photography.

709
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,715
She learned to dance when she got sad.

710
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,969
She saw "The Man Who Fell to Earth"...

711
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:16,508
And dyed her hair red.

712
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,280
I figured out how to be looked at it...

713
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,727
by men, and...

714
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,375
How to Make Them...

715
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,451
excited and uncomfortable.

716
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:32,473
I am so cocky and
I was so angry.

717
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,798
And I was so happy.

718
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,877
She fell in love with her teacher.

719
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,573
- Then she went to Planned Parenthood.
- Abigail Porter.

720
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,237
Her friends couldn't deal with
her having cancer.

721
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,706
So she went home to her mom.

722
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,184
Hey Mom.

723
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,610
Gail, did you ever take DES?

724
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,511
When you were pregnant with Abe?

725
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,460
Yes.

726
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,444
I had two miscarriages before
Abbie,

727
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,012
the doctor told me to take it.

728
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,444
DES was a fertility medication.

729
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:22,721
Doctors prescribed it to women.

730
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,902
Later they found out
that the daughters...

731
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,626
of the women who took it...

732
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,252
Got cervical cancer.

733
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,944
I didn't know that
you had miscarriages.

734
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:38,093
When her mom found out it was
because she took that drug...

735
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,213
she wouldn't talk about it.

736
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,855
And everything Abbie did.

737
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,317
made her mad.

738
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,414
So Abbie looked for another place to live.

739
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,518
- Hi.
- Hello.

740
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,778
And she started renting the room
upstairs.

741
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,222
I'm Abbie.

742
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,091
And she got a job at the news press.

743
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,754
- Hi Dorothea.
- Hi, Charlie.

744
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,630
Hi.

745
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,047
You wanna go out sometime?

746
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,855
Get a drink?

747
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,832
Yeah.

748
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,471
What the heck, Charlie?

749
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,151
Sure.

750
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:53,730
okay.

751
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,836
I wasn't sure.

752
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,422
What?

753
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,128
Some of the guys thought
you are a lesbian.

754
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:01,926
You know.

755
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:04,654
Which I don't have a problem
if you are.

756
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,571
But you are not.

757
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,254
You know I'm not.

758
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,681
Shall we go out then?

759
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,903
Okay, yeah.

760
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,547
Sure. You wanna come to dinner
at my house again sometime?

761
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,811
Good...

762
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,304
We could do that.

763
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,840
Shit!

764
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:05,260
Julie.

765
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,324
It's really, it's nothing.

766
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,541
I just end up there sometimes.

767
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,316
What do you guys do?

768
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,481
I just sleep.

769
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,448
We talk.

770
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:37,296
Can I have one?

771
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,386
No, they are really bad for you.

772
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,921
You smoke all the time.

773
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:47,490
You know, when I started they weren't
bad for you,they were just stylish.

774
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:48,874
Sort of edgy, so...

775
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,779
It's different for me.

776
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,368
Okay.

777
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,796
You're good at hiding stuff, huh?

778
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,389
My mom calls it compartmentalizing.

779
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,466
Apparently I do that a lot.

780
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,859
Are you helping him?

781
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,768
I am trying.

782
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:26,801
Really?

783
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,280
What about you?

784
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,929
Have you thought about
your impact on him?

785
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,801
It's always about the mother.

786
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,510
Like, do you think you've
moved on, since his dad?

787
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,678
You know that you're not actually a
therapist right?

788
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,154
I've had new guys, okay?

789
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,398
No one appropriate.

790
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,474
Appropriate?

791
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,865
Guys you're not going to
risk anything with.

792
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,943
Men you don't even really like.

793
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,235
Listen, you're 17, Okay?

794
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,405
Maybe you don't know what's good
about these guys.

795
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:16,751
That I really like.

796
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,491
I'm talking about you.

797
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,548
You never seem into it.

798
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,164
Except for with William.

799
00:55:28,353 --> 00:55:29,504
But...

800
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,114
He is inappropriate.

801
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,603
Okay, Jesus.

802
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:38,048
Yeah.

803
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,702
It's hard to find someone that I like.

804
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:47,674
I had my chance, twice.

805
00:55:47,707 --> 00:55:50,546
But that part of life just
didn't work out for me.

806
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,551
- Bye.
- Bye.

807
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,500
Where were you?

808
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,556
I had some errands.

809
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,225
You did the whole list?

810
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,486
You know all the stocks?

811
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,274
Yeah.

812
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,518
IBM is down.

813
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,704
Sorry, I'll fix it next time.

814
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,617
Good job on that.

815
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,170
William.

816
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,210
Yes.

817
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,906
Do I seem stuck to you?

818
00:57:28,941 --> 00:57:30,331
How do you mean?

819
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,564
Well, I guess I wouldn't know, Would I?

820
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,766
- Abbie.
- Yes?

821
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,897
Let's go out tonight.

822
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,741
I want to see this modern world.

823
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,420
Can I go?

824
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,058
I don't know if I'm going to
find an appropriate man here.

825
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,418
Thank you.

826
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,763
What was that?

827
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,408
What does that mean?

828
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,557
Don't kiss a woman if you unless you know
what you mean by it.

829
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,682
Aren't you sleeping with Abbie?

830
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,037
That's not something serious, is...

831
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,563
Then why do it?

832
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:54,881
It's 1979, I am 55 years old...
This is what my son believes in.

833
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,106
These people.

834
00:59:57,495 --> 01:00:01,075
With this hair... And these clothes.

835
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,437
Making these gestures, making these sounds.

836
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,594
It's 1979 and I am 55 years old...

837
01:00:09,627 --> 01:00:13,543
and in 1999 I'll die of cancer from smoking.

838
01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:19,279
Hey!

839
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,856
- You going?
- Yeah.

840
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,931
Do me a favor, just,
take care of Abbie.

841
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:35,746
They don't know this is the end of punk,
They don't know that Reagan's coming.

842
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,053
It's impossible to imagine that
kids will stop dreaming...

843
01:00:40,086 --> 01:00:44,928
about nuclear war, and have
nightmares about the weather.

844
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:49,717
It's impossible to imagine
HIV.

845
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,735
what will happen with skateboard
tricks.

846
01:00:52,658 --> 01:00:53,947
The Internet...

847
01:00:55,078 --> 01:00:57,861
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah, it was interesting.

848
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,492
- So Abbie has your number, right?
- Yeah.

849
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:07,231
- Give you a call for dinner.
- I would like that.

850
01:01:15,316 --> 01:01:16,496
Kid...

851
01:01:19,946 --> 01:01:20,946
It's late...

852
01:01:22,906 --> 01:01:23,928
How was it?

853
01:01:25,746 --> 01:01:28,381
It was Life changing.

854
01:01:42,424 --> 01:01:45,534
Before I die I will prepare for Y2K.

855
01:01:45,694 --> 01:01:48,654
I will put Canned food and water in the
garage.

856
01:01:49,594 --> 01:01:52,874
I put 16 thousand dollars
worth of gold coins...

857
01:01:52,907 --> 01:01:56,255
into a safe deposit box at the Bank of
Montecito.

858
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:03,337
I died before the New Year...

859
01:02:04,244 --> 01:02:07,160
Dolphin-shaped balloons
floated over my head.

860
01:02:07,904 --> 01:02:11,314
They were playing Louis
Armstrong on a Boombox.

861
01:02:25,172 --> 01:02:26,350
Jamie?

862
01:02:29,282 --> 01:02:30,902
Sorry, are you awake...?

863
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:37,530
I just wanted to tell you that
you have to get out of this town.

864
01:02:37,742 --> 01:02:39,857
If you want to have any chance...

865
01:02:39,891 --> 01:02:41,972
of an interesting life moving forward.

866
01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:43,005
What happened?

867
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,065
Sorry, shit!

868
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,490
We don't have sex.

869
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,989
I just sleep here.

870
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,780
Okay...

871
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,595
- Can I lay down?
- We were sleeping.

872
01:03:01,629 --> 01:03:03,396
- Just lay down here.
- It' Okay, I'm just gonna talk...

873
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,127
to Jamie for a second...

874
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,397
So Lynette Winters spit on me.

875
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:12,731
So then I hit her.

876
01:03:12,818 --> 01:03:15,654
- Why'd she spit on you?
- Because I spit on her.

877
01:03:15,953 --> 01:03:17,485
Right before I was
going to New York

878
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:19,302
and I thought I was
never gonna come back.

879
01:03:19,335 --> 01:03:21,607
It felt very liberating at the time.

880
01:03:22,438 --> 01:03:25,061
And somehow I ended up breaking a chair.

881
01:03:27,528 --> 01:03:30,148
- Hey Julian, I'm sorry.
- You okay?

882
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,368
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

883
01:03:34,028 --> 01:03:35,719
And then William told me...

884
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:37,412
he didn't wanna sleep with me anymore.

885
01:03:37,478 --> 01:03:40,222
What are you saying?
I don't like you...

886
01:03:40,256 --> 01:03:41,859
I don't like you. I don't like...

887
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,679
Just...

888
01:03:44,713 --> 01:03:48,213
I'm just gonna talk to Jamie
for a second...

889
01:03:48,247 --> 01:03:51,114
You can not let her sleep here.

890
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:55,757
If she's not having sex with you,
it's dis-empowering.

891
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:02,160
Also you need to get out of this town
before you start working.

892
01:04:02,193 --> 01:04:04,171
at a sunglasses shop...

893
01:04:06,853 --> 01:04:08,599
and it goes for you too.

894
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:27,067
Jamie, here is some books...

895
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,702
from a feminism class I took...

896
01:04:28,726 --> 01:04:30,488
I thought it would be helpful for you,

897
01:04:30,521 --> 01:04:31,990
to get a woman's perspective.

898
01:04:32,064 --> 01:04:34,791
- What happened to your lip?
- I got in a fight.

899
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:37,491
- What?
- There was a fight.

900
01:04:37,534 --> 01:04:38,911
It was, it was ridiculous...

901
01:04:39,011 --> 01:04:40,647
Hold on, is that "Our Bodies Our Selves"?

902
01:04:41,195 --> 01:04:43,992
This is a really good book...

903
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:46,468
There is a very good chapter...

904
01:04:46,503 --> 01:04:49,829
On home births.

905
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:55,035
Home births actually stunts the
baby's growth personality.

906
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:58,739
- What is a growth personality?
- It's a real term.

907
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,424
Who knows what it means for a new born...

908
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:04,646
to see wood walls, and...

909
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:07,044
carpeted floors and to smell...

910
01:05:07,352 --> 01:05:09,736
real human smells and to feel...

911
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,943
wool and cotton and flannel clothes...

912
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:14,509
instead of starchy, white...

913
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:19,530
deodorized... To me,
that meant like, and what else?

914
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:29,803
Women's sexuality,

915
01:05:29,848 --> 01:05:32,008
defined by men to benefit men.

916
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:36,361
has been downgraded and perverted,
repressed and channeled.

917
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:40,376
Anatomically, all orgasms are
centered in the clitoris.

918
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,680
whether they result from direct manual
pressure applied to the clitoris.

919
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,665
indirect pressure resulting from...

920
01:05:45,728 --> 01:05:48,947
I fucked Heather so hard,
she came like three times.

921
01:05:50,408 --> 01:05:55,070
- How did you stimulate her clitoris?
- With my dick.

922
01:05:57,598 --> 01:06:00,468
Women need direct clitoral stimulation.

923
01:06:00,548 --> 01:06:04,610
Like with fingers. Or vibrators.
Or something.

924
01:06:05,158 --> 01:06:06,707
She probably faked it.

925
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,218
women fake it all the time.

926
01:06:08,648 --> 01:06:10,508
Talking Heads're a bunch of fags.

927
01:06:12,698 --> 01:06:14,629
Actually there's a girl in their band...

928
01:06:14,706 --> 01:06:17,086
And she's dating the drummer, so...

929
01:06:19,546 --> 01:06:21,261
Her name is Danna...

930
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:25,224
Fuckin' around faggot.

931
01:06:34,426 --> 01:06:36,370
So, what was the fight about?

932
01:06:39,676 --> 01:06:41,553
Clitoral stimulation.

933
01:06:45,304 --> 01:06:47,182
Why do you need to fight about that?

934
01:06:48,441 --> 01:06:51,576
I don't know,
I wanna be a good guy...

935
01:06:52,094 --> 01:06:53,442
Okay. I just wanna...

936
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,227
be able to satisfy a woman.

937
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,139
Kid, I'm sure you will.

938
01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:23,722
Shit!

939
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:26,803
Jamie!

940
01:07:27,981 --> 01:07:29,061
That's not cool...

941
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:32,947
Yeah, That's what Matt called me.
For liking the talking heads.

942
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:41,862
- And what is Black Flag?
- It's a hardcore band.

943
01:07:41,896 --> 01:07:42,538
So...

944
01:07:42,615 --> 01:07:46,177
The people who love Black Flag,
hate the Talking Heads.

945
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,507
What?

946
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:52,053
The punk scene is very divisive.

947
01:07:52,879 --> 01:07:53,879
Hey!

948
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,052
You are all so advanced,
aren't you?

949
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:01,739
The next time a guy
tells you a sex story...

950
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:05,253
You just have to agree
with everything he says...

951
01:08:05,286 --> 01:08:06,546
and act like it's right.

952
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,391
Even if it's not, because they don't wanna
be contradicted.

953
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,690
They just wanna to live in
their fantasy lands.

954
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,778
How are you dealing?

955
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:18,697
With everything.

956
01:08:34,518 --> 01:08:36,873
Whatever you think your life is
going to be like,

957
01:08:36,907 --> 01:08:40,250
just know, it's not going to be
anything like that.

958
01:08:44,508 --> 01:08:45,508
Right...

959
01:09:01,216 --> 01:09:02,818
Take me to that club.

960
01:09:08,296 --> 01:09:09,408
Tonight?

961
01:09:11,286 --> 01:09:13,366
- Hey.
- Hi..

962
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:17,194
Wow, you look amazing...
Where are you going?

963
01:09:17,664 --> 01:09:19,423
We're just gonna go out...
is that okay?

964
01:09:19,754 --> 01:09:21,734
Oh yeah, of course... And where to?

965
01:09:22,294 --> 01:09:23,538
Just going out.

966
01:09:26,464 --> 01:09:27,930
- Bye.
- Bye.

967
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:47,754
Hide it there.

968
01:09:49,017 --> 01:09:51,098
Hey, can I have a beer?

969
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:57,223
Now say I'm into older women.

970
01:09:57,657 --> 01:09:59,233
- What?
- Just say it.

971
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,837
I'm into older women.

972
01:10:04,462 --> 01:10:05,855
How old are you?

973
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:08,308
Age is a bourgeois construct.

974
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,229
Age is a bourgeois construct.

975
01:10:12,562 --> 01:10:13,871
It's a good answer.

976
01:10:14,912 --> 01:10:17,653
- Age is...
- Ok, ok, you've got it.

977
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:21,487
So now, if she asks too many questions...

978
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,740
You just say as little as possible, okay?

979
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,398
Now show me your most inscrutable face.

980
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:45,113
I don't really make choices...
About women...

981
01:10:45,147 --> 01:10:46,147
They just...

982
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:51,230
They come to you.
You could have more than that.

983
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,495
But what about you? Why...?

984
01:10:57,318 --> 01:10:59,475
I mean, what happened to Jamie's dad?

985
01:11:06,948 --> 01:11:10,182
He just didn't turn out like
I thought he would.

986
01:11:12,498 --> 01:11:13,972
I guess that happens...

987
01:11:14,468 --> 01:11:16,637
There must've been something good about
him.

988
01:11:21,366 --> 01:11:24,645
- He was left handed?
- That's it?

989
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:26,112
That's it?

990
01:11:27,036 --> 01:11:32,948
And I was right handed. And...
So..In the morning...

991
01:11:33,076 --> 01:11:36,087
We would look at the stock reports
together and...

992
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:42,254
He could write with his left hand
and scratch my back.

993
01:11:46,116 --> 01:11:50,590
- And that's it!
- I loved that.

994
01:11:55,454 --> 01:11:56,875
Do you you ever meditate?

995
01:12:02,004 --> 01:12:05,863
I feel the air... coldness of the air.
Goes through my nose...

996
01:12:06,964 --> 01:12:08,640
All I'm really doing is...

997
01:12:10,634 --> 01:12:15,044
Bringing my attention back to my breath.

998
01:12:15,404 --> 01:12:17,687
So when I take a breathe in...

999
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,451
There is a feeling...

1000
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:23,007
Air going in...

1001
01:12:24,742 --> 01:12:26,195
Air going out...

1002
01:12:27,352 --> 01:12:28,675
It's a good feeling.

1003
01:12:35,112 --> 01:12:36,961
It's okay..good... I'm just gonna...

1004
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:41,652
Go ahead...

1005
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:43,904
I'm just gonna smoke...

1006
01:12:45,332 --> 01:12:46,616
I'm listening...

1007
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:52,647
- I wanna get on the same page.
- You are such...

1008
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,581
How did you get to be
this person that you are?

1009
01:12:56,615 --> 01:12:58,975
It's so... You're so unusual.

1010
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,906
William's dad managed an auto
repair shop..

1011
01:13:04,939 --> 01:13:09,718
In Cleveland. Engines always made sense to
him.

1012
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,343
He tried to put himself
through college, but couldn't afford it.

1013
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,786
He met Theresa in 1963,

1014
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:24,533
she was smart, brave,
better off,...

1015
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,697
they were in love.
They moved to Oakland,

1016
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,044
Then, to a commune in Sevastopol.

1017
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:31,441
Well I learned to be like them.

1018
01:13:31,475 --> 01:13:32,475
You know?

1019
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:37,317
As it turns out, it was a lot
easier than I thought it would be.

1020
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:40,138
but it wasn't really me.
I was doing it for...

1021
01:13:41,318 --> 01:13:43,838
So that I wouldn't lose Theresa.

1022
01:13:45,398 --> 01:13:48,191
He started looking like them,
talking like them...

1023
01:13:48,268 --> 01:13:52,014
but they made him feel old and
uneducated and poor.

1024
01:13:52,905 --> 01:13:54,413
Theresa started thinking...

1025
01:13:54,447 --> 01:13:57,445
William was uptight and possessive and
she left him.

1026
01:13:58,606 --> 01:14:00,334
After Theresa women...

1027
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:02,061
didn't have to look one way or the other.

1028
01:14:02,095 --> 01:14:03,561
Or be a certain way.

1029
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,096
I think that I just...

1030
01:14:09,671 --> 01:14:13,307
I want to win them over
so that I won't be lonely.

1031
01:14:13,776 --> 01:14:16,151
- You live here?
- I do.

1032
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,902
But, once I have them...

1033
01:14:18,936 --> 01:14:20,825
I don't really know what
to do with them.

1034
01:14:29,644 --> 01:14:33,047
- You want to do something later?
- Sleep.

1035
01:14:34,894 --> 01:14:35,924
I should go.

1036
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:39,949
What he likes is making bowls...

1037
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:42,634
He doesn't smell like
oil and grease...

1038
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:45,489
his hands don't look like a dumb
mechanic's hands.

1039
01:14:45,561 --> 01:14:47,494
I've using small bowls for a while,

1040
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:56,658
And when it gets little bit drier...

1041
01:15:01,562 --> 01:15:02,750
It's beautiful.

1042
01:15:08,602 --> 01:15:09,733
What?

1043
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:13,926
Did you fix it?

1044
01:15:15,102 --> 01:15:16,290
Well, maybe.

1045
01:15:16,938 --> 01:15:19,566
It's part of Volkswagen now.

1046
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,197
I had to improvise.

1047
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,437
And how you're gonna get to
know a person way over there?

1048
01:15:52,988 --> 01:15:58,014
- What am I supposed to do?
- Just make a little small talk.

1049
01:15:58,438 --> 01:16:01,015
Introduce yourself...
ask her to dance...

1050
01:16:02,318 --> 01:16:05,741
- Okay, hello I am William...
- Hello...

1051
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:08,289
Hello...
I live downstairs...

1052
01:16:08,348 --> 01:16:10,137
- Yeah.
- With the cars...

1053
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:15,256
- Would you like to dance with me?
- Yes, sure.

1054
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,168
Okay.

1055
01:16:16,202 --> 01:16:21,434
Put your hand out right,
Put the other hand here and just be there...

1056
01:16:22,766 --> 01:16:28,804
- All she wants is a little company.
- Oh good...

1057
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:33,049
That's nice.

1058
01:17:05,844 --> 01:17:08,949
I feel like I understand you.

1059
01:17:11,134 --> 01:17:14,692
- We should get away from here.
- It's just me and you, you know?

1060
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:17,431
Go up the coast... Be alone somewhere.

1061
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,825
Jamie, You are in love with Julie...

1062
01:17:26,882 --> 01:17:28,883
You can't let it push you around.

1063
01:17:29,842 --> 01:17:31,495
You have to tell her what you want.

1064
01:17:42,882 --> 01:17:45,036
If you were to listen to it...

1065
01:17:45,932 --> 01:17:48,692
What does that mean... Art Fag?

1066
01:17:48,726 --> 01:17:49,919
I mean, what is...?

1067
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:54,447
If you would've think about it
from more like a sociological perspective.

1068
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,878
Where does that come from?
Art fag.

1069
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,196
- What is that?
- Abbie understands it.

1070
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:02,447
Abbie does not understand it,
she's just a part of it.

1071
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,638
We don't need to like it.

1072
01:18:20,401 --> 01:18:21,979
Okay, what is he saying?

1073
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:26,283
Head on my shoulders...

1074
01:18:29,048 --> 01:18:31,550
- going berserk.
- What?

1075
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:34,540
- Is that interesting?
- I don't know.

1076
01:18:35,218 --> 01:18:36,401
I don't know either.

1077
01:18:37,248 --> 01:18:39,183
I think we're maybe over-thinking this.

1078
01:18:55,296 --> 01:18:56,931
Let's try the Art Fag one.

1079
01:18:59,426 --> 01:19:01,090
Here come the Art Fags.

1080
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:06,845
Oh yeah.

1081
01:19:14,536 --> 01:19:15,799
What do you think?

1082
01:19:28,504 --> 01:19:29,504
That's it.

1083
01:19:33,444 --> 01:19:35,677
I guess we're more the art fag types.

1084
01:19:37,184 --> 01:19:38,473
I like that.

1085
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:18,629
What're you looking at?
- inscrutable boy.

1086
01:20:23,172 --> 01:20:25,683
I gave him beer and then I...

1087
01:20:26,002 --> 01:20:29,098
taught him how to
verbally seduce women.

1088
01:20:29,397 --> 01:20:30,436
And...

1089
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:33,491
we drove drunk, but I stopped that.

1090
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:38,362
and then he kissed Trish
and then we walked home.

1091
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,880
You're not mad?

1092
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:52,242
You are mad...

1093
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:03,068
You get to see him
out in the world as a person.

1094
01:21:04,288 --> 01:21:05,830
I never will.

1095
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:14,708
Just...

1096
01:21:23,032 --> 01:21:24,358
There.

1097
01:21:56,406 --> 01:21:58,747
I can't believe
Abbie gave you this book.

1098
01:22:00,424 --> 01:22:01,730
It's interesting.

1099
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,014
What's it like?

1100
01:22:06,694 --> 01:22:08,891
- For girls...
- What?

1101
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:10,757
Sex?

1102
01:22:13,404 --> 01:22:14,756
Orgasms.

1103
01:22:18,044 --> 01:22:20,005
Do you really want to know
What it's like?

1104
01:22:23,444 --> 01:22:24,601
Yeah.

1105
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:27,423
I don't have them.

1106
01:22:29,672 --> 01:22:30,952
What?

1107
01:22:32,632 --> 01:22:34,250
None of my friends do.

1108
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,927
- So why do you do it?
- There's other reasons.

1109
01:22:41,662 --> 01:22:44,215
You know, like the way that
he looks at you...

1110
01:22:47,642 --> 01:22:50,526
the way they all get a little
desperate at some point.

1111
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:54,304
And the little sounds that they make.

1112
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:09,858
And their bodies...

1113
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:15,065
Cause you don't exactly
know what they're gonna look like..

1114
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,406
Or smell or feel like...

1115
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:23,330
Until you do it.

1116
01:23:27,243 --> 01:23:28,437
But yeah...

1117
01:23:28,608 --> 01:23:30,352
Half the time I regret it.

1118
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:35,730
The why do you do it?

1119
01:23:38,188 --> 01:23:40,111
Cause Half the time I don't regret it.

1120
01:23:52,117 --> 01:23:55,194
I am gregarious...
interested in others.

1121
01:23:55,466 --> 01:23:57,148
and I think intelligent...

1122
01:24:01,656 --> 01:24:04,077
All I ask is to get to know
people and...

1123
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:05,817
to have them interested in knowing me.

1124
01:24:06,356 --> 01:24:08,840
I doubt whether I would marry
again and...

1125
01:24:08,873 --> 01:24:10,990
live that close to another individual.

1126
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,282
But I remain invisible.

1127
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:16,874
Don't pretend for a minute,
as you look at me that.

1128
01:24:17,174 --> 01:24:19,635
that I'm not as alive as you are.

1129
01:24:19,969 --> 01:24:22,102
and I do not suffer from the
category...

1130
01:24:22,135 --> 01:24:23,617
to which you are forcing me...

1131
01:24:27,586 --> 01:24:31,256
I think stripped down I look more
attractive than my ex-husband...

1132
01:24:32,704 --> 01:24:35,454
But I am sexually and socially obsolete.

1133
01:24:35,524 --> 01:24:36,529
And he is not.

1134
01:24:38,474 --> 01:24:40,721
I have a capacity now for
taking people as they are.

1135
01:24:41,104 --> 01:24:42,523
which I lacked at twenty.

1136
01:24:43,194 --> 01:24:45,368
I reach orgasm in half the time...

1137
01:24:45,395 --> 01:24:47,439
and I know how to please...

1138
01:24:47,514 --> 01:24:49,053
Yet I do not even dare show a man...

1139
01:24:49,087 --> 01:24:50,746
that I find him attractive.

1140
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:54,794
If I do so, he may react
as if I had insulted him.

1141
01:24:57,404 --> 01:24:58,438
I am supposed to fulfill my...

1142
01:24:58,462 --> 01:25:01,252
small functions and vanish.

1143
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:11,074
What do you think of all that?

1144
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:15,748
I don't know...

1145
01:25:15,782 --> 01:25:17,580
Maybe, I'm a feminist?

1146
01:25:23,482 --> 01:25:24,539
So...

1147
01:25:29,482 --> 01:25:31,101
You think that's me...

1148
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:33,615
No, I don't know.

1149
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,280
So, you think you know me
better because you read that.

1150
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:39,680
No, no.

1151
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:45,183
Then why're you reading it to me?

1152
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:51,219
I thought it was interesting.

1153
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,879
Okay, well...

1154
01:26:02,018 --> 01:26:04,922
I don't need a book
to know about myself.

1155
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:14,341
I'm sorry.

1156
01:26:31,028 --> 01:26:34,255
I mean, I appreciate that
you trying to help, I do...

1157
01:26:34,288 --> 01:26:36,719
I just think
you are taking it too far.

1158
01:26:37,052 --> 01:26:42,561
And this stuff, with you know, the women's
movement I respect, but it's just...

1159
01:26:43,006 --> 01:26:45,878
It's complicated,
and I think it's too much for him.

1160
01:26:46,116 --> 01:26:48,597
I don't know what it is
that you're talking about.

1161
01:26:48,627 --> 01:26:50,450
Okay, he is 15 years old boy...

1162
01:26:50,486 --> 01:26:53,205
- I know...
- You are giving him hard core feminism...

1163
01:26:53,256 --> 01:26:57,194
But he really loves it
and it's really..it's helping him.

1164
01:26:57,226 --> 01:26:59,609
- Helping him what?
- It's helping him become a man.

1165
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:01,297
This is the boy you
were talking about.

1166
01:27:01,327 --> 01:27:02,945
Learning about a
female orgasms...

1167
01:27:02,978 --> 01:27:04,201
is helping him be a man?

1168
01:27:04,234 --> 01:27:06,871
Well what man do you know that cares
anything about that?

1169
01:27:06,904 --> 01:27:09,920
- It's a miracle!
- he's a high school kid.

1170
01:27:09,954 --> 01:27:10,593
Okay?

1171
01:27:10,594 --> 01:27:12,926
It's too much, I'm telling you.

1172
01:27:16,554 --> 01:27:19,179
I think he seems really okay with it.

1173
01:27:20,228 --> 01:27:22,847
You know you don't actually know
what you're doing with him?

1174
01:27:25,734 --> 01:27:27,253
Okay, so...

1175
01:27:28,747 --> 01:27:29,892
Just...

1176
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:34,035
As you know...

1177
01:27:34,442 --> 01:27:38,505
There is a growing disrespect
for government...

1178
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:41,250
The schools, the news media...

1179
01:27:41,283 --> 01:27:42,529
And all the institutions.

1180
01:27:43,642 --> 01:27:47,914
This is not a message
of happiness or reassurance.

1181
01:27:48,762 --> 01:27:52,439
But it is the truth
and it is a warning.

1182
01:27:53,982 --> 01:27:58,550
It is a crisis of confidence.

1183
01:27:59,512 --> 01:28:02,590
We can see this crisis
in the growing doubt...

1184
01:28:02,623 --> 01:28:03,661
about the meaning of our...

1185
01:28:03,685 --> 01:28:07,573
own lives and in the loss
of unity and purpose...

1186
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:08,884
for our nation.

1187
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:15,950
Too many of us now, tend to worship
self indulgence...

1188
01:28:15,983 --> 01:28:17,933
and consumption.

1189
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:24,445
But we've discovered that owning
things and consuming things.

1190
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:29,923
Does not satisfy...
our longing for meaning.

1191
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:37,879
We always believed that we
were part of a great movement.

1192
01:28:37,968 --> 01:28:39,640
Of humanity itself...

1193
01:28:40,718 --> 01:28:43,618
Involved in the for freedom.

1194
01:28:48,748 --> 01:28:51,859
We are at a turning point in our history.

1195
01:28:54,588 --> 01:28:58,014
The path that leads to
fragmentation and self-interest...

1196
01:28:59,818 --> 01:29:03,463
down that road lies a mistaken
idea of freedom.

1197
01:29:06,136 --> 01:29:09,300
It is a certain route to failure.

1198
01:29:12,206 --> 01:29:14,193
Thank you and good night.

1199
01:29:17,546 --> 01:29:20,449
- He is so screwed.
- No shit.

1200
01:29:20,996 --> 01:29:22,579
It's over for him.

1201
01:29:24,086 --> 01:29:25,877
I thought that was beautiful.

1202
01:29:27,649 --> 01:29:28,430
Well...

1203
01:29:28,536 --> 01:29:30,711
Why didn't you
just say I'm sorry?

1204
01:29:30,745 --> 01:29:31,745
I'm done.

1205
01:29:32,136 --> 01:29:34,156
- My pride...
- I know.

1206
01:29:34,184 --> 01:29:36,947
- Yes...
- You don't seem like a prideful person.

1207
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,884
- You seem humble.
- I left my pride outside today.

1208
01:29:42,334 --> 01:29:44,143
Jamie,
would you please wake up Abbie?

1209
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:50,632
- Yeah Abbie.!
- Ugh, stop it, I'm menstruating.

1210
01:29:51,634 --> 01:29:54,978
Abbie, you know what?
You're menstruating, okay.

1211
01:29:55,004 --> 01:29:57,530
But do you have to say it, Ok?

1212
01:29:57,563 --> 01:30:00,366
Do we really need to know everything
that's going on with you?

1213
01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:04,747
What? I am menstruating.
What is that a big deal?

1214
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:07,076
We don't need to hear about that,
thank you.

1215
01:30:09,052 --> 01:30:11,434
If you ever wanna have an
adult relationship with a woman..

1216
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:13,955
Like if you wanna have
sex with a woman's vagina,

1217
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:15,398
You need to be comfortable.

1218
01:30:15,431 --> 01:30:19,135
With the fact that the vagina menstruates...
I'm just saying...

1219
01:30:19,168 --> 01:30:20,950
Menstruation,
it's not a big problem.

1220
01:30:20,972 --> 01:30:24,136
So, start singing now... Menstruation.

1221
01:30:25,332 --> 01:30:28,040
- No.
- Yes, menstruation.

1222
01:30:29,182 --> 01:30:31,669
- Menstruation.
- Jamie, no...

1223
01:30:31,922 --> 01:30:32,936
You don't have to.

1224
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:35,215
You saying it like you're scared,
don't say like you're scared...

1225
01:30:35,225 --> 01:30:37,896
- Say it like it's normal.
- Menstruation.

1226
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:39,219
- Menstruation.
- Menstruation...

1227
01:30:39,253 --> 01:30:40,025
Not bad.

1228
01:30:40,058 --> 01:30:42,508
Julian, menstruation...
You can say it.

1229
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:45,006
- Right now...
- I'm Sorry...

1230
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,080
Menstruation.

1231
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:49,243
It's just, keep eye contact with me.

1232
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:51,185
Who are you looking at?
Menstruation.

1233
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:53,282
- Menstruation.
- Yes that's right...

1234
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:55,889
Menstruation, Charlie?
You're quiet...

1235
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:58,268
- Menstruation?
- Menstruation?

1236
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:00,785
No, not like a question, menstruation.

1237
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,804
Menstruation.

1238
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:04,879
Now everybody say it together...

1239
01:31:05,188 --> 01:31:09,674
Menstruation, like gentle, happy...
But casual and...

1240
01:31:09,878 --> 01:31:12,992
- Menstruation!
- It's gross Abbie.

1241
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:15,897
No, it's not. It's not gross.
It's a very deep time.

1242
01:31:16,228 --> 01:31:19,118
Creatively and it's
emotionally trans-formative.

1243
01:31:20,488 --> 01:31:23,867
And sex during menstruation
can be very pleasurable...

1244
01:31:23,908 --> 01:31:27,347
for a woman and can even like,
relieve some of the cramps.

1245
01:31:27,521 --> 01:31:28,628
Jamie I also wanna say...

1246
01:31:28,652 --> 01:31:30,842
never have sex with just the vagina...

1247
01:31:30,878 --> 01:31:32,816
You have to have sex
with the whole woman.

1248
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:38,261
That's way off topic of
what I'm talking about.

1249
01:31:38,296 --> 01:31:39,296
Thank you.

1250
01:31:39,616 --> 01:31:43,424
The first time that I got my period,
I was watching...

1251
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:46,598
One that flew over the "Cuckoo's Nest",
with some guy...

1252
01:31:46,986 --> 01:31:50,896
And...yeah I just told him that
I had to leave.

1253
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:54,706
So I went to the market and
I bought a box of tampons.

1254
01:31:54,956 --> 01:31:57,691
I read the instructions on the box
and I put one in.

1255
01:31:57,746 --> 01:32:00,441
And I never told my mom about it,
but she never asks.

1256
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:01,560
So it didn't matter.

1257
01:32:02,876 --> 01:32:05,690
I never saw the end
of the Cuckoo's Nest.

1258
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:10,452
Jack Nicholson got a lobotomy...

1259
01:32:10,486 --> 01:32:13,143
and so the big Indian guy,
smothered him with the pillow...

1260
01:32:13,177 --> 01:32:14,938
so that he could be, you know, be free.

1261
01:32:15,204 --> 01:32:17,076
Okay... Let's talk about something else.

1262
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:20,211
At 14, I had sex for the first time.

1263
01:32:20,245 --> 01:32:21,245
Julie!

1264
01:32:21,284 --> 01:32:23,153
Julie, please... You, Honey...

1265
01:32:23,234 --> 01:32:26,343
I decided one night that I was just gonna
loose my virginity.

1266
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,935
- I didn't care who.
- Julie, you gotta to calm down.

1267
01:32:28,968 --> 01:32:32,016
- Stop it, let her talk.
- I picked this guy that I didn't know..

1268
01:32:32,049 --> 01:32:33,158
at a party...

1269
01:32:33,644 --> 01:32:37,628
And we had fairly painful sex.
In his van..

1270
01:32:37,865 --> 01:32:41,857
just parked on the street.
Just used spit for lubrication.

1271
01:32:42,339 --> 01:32:43,615
Disgusting...

1272
01:32:44,952 --> 01:32:47,009
I made it home in time
for the curfew though.

1273
01:32:47,044 --> 01:32:49,984
His carpet smelled like
spilled bong water.

1274
01:32:55,462 --> 01:32:58,951
Well, let's call it a night.

1275
01:32:59,150 --> 01:32:59,877
All right.

1276
01:32:59,912 --> 01:33:02,454
Thanks all for coming...
show is over girls.

1277
01:33:03,512 --> 01:33:05,207
Thank you so much for coming...

1278
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,762
Jamie, we need to talk.

1279
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:14,334
There's a lot of stuff happening...
right? And I just...

1280
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:16,335
Would like to know what's going on with you.

1281
01:33:17,496 --> 01:33:18,268
I mean...

1282
01:33:18,302 --> 01:33:21,301
I know it's all been a
lot for us to deal with.

1283
01:33:21,794 --> 01:33:22,726
Mom.

1284
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:27,541
I'm dealing with everything right now.
You are dealing with nothing.

1285
01:33:40,868 --> 01:33:42,853
Can't believe you told
everyone all that.

1286
01:33:43,981 --> 01:33:46,099
I can say what I wanna say.

1287
01:33:48,318 --> 01:33:49,975
They're gonna think you're some...

1288
01:33:51,028 --> 01:33:53,117
They are gonna get the
wrong idea about you.

1289
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:54,227
What?

1290
01:33:54,728 --> 01:33:56,030
That I'm a slut?

1291
01:33:58,548 --> 01:34:00,000
Is that what you think?

1292
01:34:04,478 --> 01:34:06,973
You can't sleep here anymore...

1293
01:34:07,468 --> 01:34:09,261
And just want to talk...

1294
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:18,187
- really?
- Yes.

1295
01:34:22,326 --> 01:34:23,566
Jamie...

1296
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:30,447
I'm sorry.

1297
01:34:34,906 --> 01:34:37,056
I am sorry, okay?

1298
01:34:42,114 --> 01:34:44,826
Let's just get out of here.

1299
01:34:46,244 --> 01:34:49,817
Let's go up the coast...
like you said that you would.

1300
01:34:52,144 --> 01:34:53,675
Just the two of us.

1301
01:35:01,854 --> 01:35:03,077
Mom...

1302
01:35:04,234 --> 01:35:06,103
Julie and I took the car...

1303
01:35:07,984 --> 01:35:09,831
We're taking a trip up the coast...

1304
01:35:11,112 --> 01:35:12,672
Just to get away.

1305
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:15,657
You don't need to worry about us.

1306
01:36:13,587 --> 01:36:14,587
Hey...

1307
01:36:14,688 --> 01:36:19,008
Do you think that you could
buy us some like wine coolers?

1308
01:36:19,159 --> 01:36:23,452
You can keep the change, strawberry
or anything berry really.

1309
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:36,173
- Hi, what's the matter?
- Hi...

1310
01:36:37,019 --> 01:36:39,113
You changed lanes in the intersection
back there.

1311
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:41,490
Seriously, that's all?

1312
01:36:42,356 --> 01:36:44,622
I need to see your license registration.

1313
01:36:45,378 --> 01:36:48,114
What if I don't have my license?

1314
01:36:49,621 --> 01:36:50,325
Okay.

1315
01:36:50,406 --> 01:36:52,926
What's your name, address,
and date of birth, do you have that?

1316
01:36:53,196 --> 01:36:57,268
You know, these are very personal questions
and we've just met.

1317
01:36:57,766 --> 01:37:00,770
What's your name?
What's your address, right?

1318
01:37:00,886 --> 01:37:03,277
I mean... It's a little forward...

1319
01:37:30,104 --> 01:37:32,348
I love you...

1320
01:37:40,535 --> 01:37:41,803
What's wrong?

1321
01:37:42,697 --> 01:37:43,934
Nothing.

1322
01:37:48,846 --> 01:37:50,203
Tell me.

1323
01:37:56,272 --> 01:37:58,643
I think that I'm too close to you...

1324
01:38:00,052 --> 01:38:01,467
To have sex with you...

1325
01:38:04,392 --> 01:38:06,062
It's confusing...

1326
01:38:08,222 --> 01:38:09,535
Sorry.

1327
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:17,772
I can help you get over that.

1328
01:38:21,315 --> 01:38:23,022
I don't wanna get over that.

1329
01:38:26,098 --> 01:38:27,349
Yes you do.

1330
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,836
You're being like the other guys.

1331
01:38:31,252 --> 01:38:33,232
I don't want to just,
have sex with you,

1332
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:35,621
I want you...

1333
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:38,272
But it's your version of me.

1334
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:41,762
It's not me.

1335
01:38:43,888 --> 01:38:46,476
It'd be a lot better
if you just wanted sex

1336
01:38:47,468 --> 01:38:49,849
You're exactly like the other guys...

1337
01:38:50,468 --> 01:38:52,502
You just seem like you are a modern.

1338
01:39:05,602 --> 01:39:06,714
Jamie?

1339
01:39:08,848 --> 01:39:09,869
Jamie.

1340
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:12,108
Jamie!

1341
01:39:43,464 --> 01:39:45,576
These people have no sense of humor.

1342
01:40:04,634 --> 01:40:06,611
Having a kid seems like...

1343
01:40:08,334 --> 01:40:12,980
- The hardest thing.
- Yeah...

1344
01:40:14,672 --> 01:40:16,534
How much you love the kid...

1345
01:40:21,002 --> 01:40:23,522
you're just pretty much screwed.

1346
01:40:35,952 --> 01:40:37,555
- It's for you.
- Hi.

1347
01:40:38,053 --> 01:40:39,053
Hey.

1348
01:40:39,962 --> 01:40:42,362
Julie just called me,
they are in San Luis Obispo,

1349
01:40:42,396 --> 01:40:43,725
she doesn't know where he is.

1350
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,006
She can't find him.

1351
01:40:46,289 --> 01:40:46,922
I...

1352
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,500
- Would you drive me?
- Yes, I will.

1353
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,156
- Out there?
- Yeah let's go..

1354
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:51,764
- Will you come?
- Yes.

1355
01:41:36,388 --> 01:41:37,908
I'm sorry...

1356
01:41:42,835 --> 01:41:44,160
He came back.

1357
01:41:45,576 --> 01:41:46,813
He's right there.

1358
01:41:48,876 --> 01:41:51,171
Okay... Okay.

1359
01:41:55,376 --> 01:41:56,435
It's okay.

1360
01:42:19,834 --> 01:42:20,834
Well...

1361
01:42:21,534 --> 01:42:24,133
Julie is... pretty complicated woman.

1362
01:42:24,584 --> 01:42:26,193
It's a lot to take on.

1363
01:42:26,226 --> 01:42:27,895
I'm impressed in a way.

1364
01:42:30,234 --> 01:42:31,291
Whatever.

1365
01:42:42,034 --> 01:42:45,675
Aren't you going to get Julie?
To come talk with me?

1366
01:42:46,152 --> 01:42:48,421
- Jamie?
- What?

1367
01:42:49,742 --> 01:42:51,154
I thought they'd help.

1368
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,421
Well..It just seemed like you couldn't
deal with me anymore.

1369
01:42:58,177 --> 01:42:59,177
Look.

1370
01:43:00,242 --> 01:43:03,278
I wanted... I...

1371
01:43:04,684 --> 01:43:05,929
Look, I...

1372
01:43:07,532 --> 01:43:10,214
I don't want you to end up
in the same place as me.

1373
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:17,821
- What does that mean?
- Well, I wanted you to be happier.

1374
01:43:20,445 --> 01:43:23,954
And I just didn't think I could do it by
myself. I...

1375
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:28,826
You're right.

1376
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,799
I thought we were fine though
just me and you.

1377
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,433
Yeah?

1378
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:45,340
Yeah.

1379
01:44:19,026 --> 01:44:20,834
Okay. Come...

1380
01:44:20,946 --> 01:44:22,310
Come and dance with your mom.

1381
01:45:21,322 --> 01:45:22,557
- Bye.
- Bye.

1382
01:45:22,856 --> 01:45:23,856
Bye.

1383
01:45:26,538 --> 01:45:28,178
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

1384
01:45:38,772 --> 01:45:40,896
So maybe we don't go back yet?

1385
01:45:43,892 --> 01:45:44,915
Okay.

1386
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:59,003
- Were you and Dad ever in love?
- Sure.

1387
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,061
Or um...

1388
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:10,455
Maybe I was just...

1389
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,499
I thought that was supposed
to be in love. Or..

1390
01:46:16,074 --> 01:46:20,127
I was scared I'd never be in love.

1391
01:46:22,438 --> 01:46:24,066
So I...

1392
01:46:26,008 --> 01:46:28,436
I just pick the
best solution at the time.

1393
01:46:39,678 --> 01:46:43,177
- I want to bleach my hair.
- Kid...

1394
01:46:44,318 --> 01:46:46,786
- Really?
- Yeah.

1395
01:46:56,236 --> 01:46:57,248
Okay.

1396
01:47:02,396 --> 01:47:03,805
Are you lonely?

1397
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:08,763
Well... I might marry Bogart.

1398
01:47:08,811 --> 01:47:11,508
In my next life...
We'll see.

1399
01:47:11,956 --> 01:47:13,280
I'm thinking about it.

1400
01:47:14,596 --> 01:47:16,050
He is dead.

1401
01:47:17,226 --> 01:47:18,592
Well...

1402
01:47:19,524 --> 01:47:22,672
This is my next life, right? So...

1403
01:47:23,994 --> 01:47:28,366
He may be there... may be around, and
we might meet and..

1404
01:47:30,014 --> 01:47:31,882
something might happen between us.

1405
01:47:33,944 --> 01:47:34,944
Okay..

1406
01:47:37,184 --> 01:47:38,890
You can't have it in the real world?

1407
01:47:39,479 --> 01:47:42,468
Hey, this is no time
to be rational, sweetie.

1408
01:47:42,501 --> 01:47:46,264
- Can you just go with this?
- Yeah, keep going.

1409
01:47:46,685 --> 01:47:47,685
Okay.

1410
01:47:48,944 --> 01:47:54,009
So he knows what I'm thinking...
And he makes me laugh...

1411
01:47:55,532 --> 01:47:58,274
And... he really sees me.

1412
01:47:59,642 --> 01:48:03,750
And... You know that he's gonna do
what he says he's gonna do.

1413
01:48:03,762 --> 01:48:08,253
- So that's easy...
- It Sounds nice.

1414
01:48:09,811 --> 01:48:10,883
Yeah.

1415
01:48:14,137 --> 01:48:15,207
Yeah...

1416
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:21,575
I thought that was just the beginning of
a new relationship with her.

1417
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:26,121
where she'd really tell me stuff.

1418
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:30,720
But maybe it was never
really like that again.

1419
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:34,073
Maybe that was it.

1420
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:41,143
In March of 1999, I'll start
to feel tired and confused.

1421
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:43,879
When I finally go to the doctor,

1422
01:48:43,912 --> 01:48:45,952
he will say that the
cancer in my lungs...

1423
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:49,867
had already traveled to my breast and brain.

1424
01:48:50,988 --> 01:48:54,105
I'll try to teach Jamie what to do
with my stocks.

1425
01:48:54,138 --> 01:48:57,770
but my instructions will be
impossible to understand.

1426
01:49:11,718 --> 01:49:13,967
Abbie will take me to Planned
Parenthood...

1427
01:49:15,358 --> 01:49:17,060
And I will go on the pill.

1428
01:49:21,596 --> 01:49:25,701
I will go to NYU and lose touch
with Jamie and Dorothea.

1429
01:49:27,096 --> 01:49:29,198
and I will stop talking to my mom.

1430
01:49:31,052 --> 01:49:33,199
I will fall in love with Nicholas.

1431
01:49:33,896 --> 01:49:35,844
We will move to Paris.

1432
01:49:37,056 --> 01:49:39,240
and choose not to have children.

1433
01:49:41,206 --> 01:49:43,426
I'll stay in Santa Barbara.

1434
01:49:43,907 --> 01:49:46,724
In just two years I will marry Dave.

1435
01:49:47,526 --> 01:49:51,303
A month after I get married
Carlotta will die.

1436
01:49:53,965 --> 01:49:57,112
A week later... Max will die too.

1437
01:49:59,674 --> 01:50:01,489
I will work out of my garage.

1438
01:50:01,522 --> 01:50:03,608
and show in local galleries.

1439
01:50:04,924 --> 01:50:08,226
Against my doctor's advice,
I will get pregnant..

1440
01:50:08,884 --> 01:50:12,644
by the time I'm 34
I'll have two boys...

1441
01:50:16,804 --> 01:50:19,017
I'll live with Dorothea
for another year.

1442
01:50:21,549 --> 01:50:23,614
And then I'll open a pottery store.

1443
01:50:23,682 --> 01:50:26,062
In Sedona, Arizona.

1444
01:50:29,012 --> 01:50:31,918
I will marry Laurie
a singer-songwriter...

1445
01:50:32,172 --> 01:50:36,035
We'll get divorced a year...
Then I'll meet Sandy.

1446
01:50:36,902 --> 01:50:39,277
And continue to do my pottery.

1447
01:50:41,702 --> 01:50:44,722
My mom will meet Jim in 1983...

1448
01:50:45,842 --> 01:50:48,472
they'll stay a couple until she dies.

1449
01:50:49,182 --> 01:50:50,935
On her birthday each year,

1450
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:53,869
he will buy her a trip on a biplane.

1451
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,285
Years after she's gone...

1452
01:50:58,316 --> 01:51:00,212
I'll finally get married
and have a son.

1453
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:06,285
I'll try to explain to him what his
grandmother was like.

1454
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:09,906
but it will be impossible.
