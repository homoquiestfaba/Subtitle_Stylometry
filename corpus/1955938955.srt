1
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:32,684
Again.

2
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:34,450
Every time.

3
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,563
It--it's really amazing,
you know?

4
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,955
No matter how little milk
you put on your cereal,

5
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:43,383
there's always
too much left at the end.

6
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,834
I mean, you would think it would
be possible to judge it right.

7
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:49,291
You know, maybe put in
just the right amount of milk

8
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:50,928
so it all comes out even?

9
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:53,631
But no.
Th--there's always too much.

10
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:55,811
It's just...

11
00:00:57,476 --> 00:00:58,991
Shit!
So, what?

12
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:02,634
You end up havin to pour in more cereal
that you probably don't even want,

13
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:04,960
Or--or having to pick up the bowl
and slurp it!

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,395
Like you're
some kind of a dog!

15
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:10,244
There's no reprieve!
It's every time!

16
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:13,252
It just digs, and digs,
and digs,

17
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:16,037
until you just can't
take it anymore...!

18
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:18,379
I wish I were dead!

19
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,768
Ugh!

20
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:48,051
I don't believe it!
I'm gonna die!

21
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,817
I don't need this,
you know.

22
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:11,577
Flies are the filthiest creatures
on the planet.

23
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:15,098
The number one
carriers of disease.

24
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:22,025
And they're pathetically stupid.
The stupidest of all bugs.

25
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,774
I mean...
You've seen 'em, right?

26
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:26,326
They--they sit around
cleaning their hands all the time,

27
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:28,182
you know, like it matters?

28
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,677
So, I go in my backyard.

29
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:32,317
There's a piece of dog crap
on the ground.

30
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:37,426
A piece of dog crap.
Fly sitting on it, cleaning his hands.

31
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:40,524
How incredibly stupid
would you have to be?

32
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,396
"What is this shit on here?"

33
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:53,746
"It's there again.
What is this shit?"

34
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,909
They're dirty,
disgusting creatures

35
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,262
that should be
gathered up and exterminated.

36
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,787
And I'm not that interested
in that whole food chain thing.

37
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:04,103
"Pollinisation" or
whatever the hell it is.

38
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,945
I'd gladly give up
an occasional honeydew

39
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:12,253
if it meant being forever rid
of those useless, pathetic, vile, horrible,

40
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:15,811
disease riddled, wretched little
flying devil bugs!

41
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:21,136
Oh, great.

42
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,820
I don't even know
why I read this, you know.

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,256
 Everything in it
just makes you sick.

44
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:31,802
Yesterday, I read about
this guy that killed his sister-in-law,

45
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,606
and then his brother.

46
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:36,716
Right, so he goe's to trial.
He is found innocent

47
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:41,505
by reason of insanity,
and gets out in four years.

48
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,545
Four years!

49
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:49,782
You know what
I think they should do?

50
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:52,800
Let's say somebody kills
Amy Lou Rogers.

51
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:55,047
I think they should
lock him in his cell;

52
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,808
and when they
bury Amy Lou,

53
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:59,972
they should put the key
to the cell in her hand.

54
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,394
That way,
when a few years goes by,

55
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:07,265
and the guy starts whining:
"Hey, when are you gonna let me out?"

56
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:09,724
"I've been in here
a really long time."

57
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,807
"When do I get out?"

58
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:14,146
You just go:
"Hey, don't sweat it, pal."

59
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:17,074
"As soon as Amy Lou
comes back to life,

60
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,409
digs her way out, and
waltzes in here with the key,

61
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:21,601
you're walking!"

62
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,377
"24 hours tops,
you're on the streets!"

63
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:29,251
But you know
what really gets me mad?

64
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:34,118
I bought these natural
watermelon popsicles.

65
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:39,627
On the box, It said: "100% natural,
100% watermelon."

66
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:42,240
So I thought:
"Hey, I love watermelon."

67
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,940
"I love popsicles."

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,830
"This should be
the perfect thing for me."

69
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:49,799
So I take a bite.

70
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,266
And I notice there's something
in my mouth.

71
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,665
Something small and hard.

72
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:58,528
So I spit it out...
It was a seed.

73
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,925
A seed!

74
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:06,920
They actually put
watermelon seeds in the popsicles!

75
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:10,700
What is the possible
marketing strategy here?

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,883
"Yes!
Watermelon popsicles!"

77
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:15,658
"With all the annoyance
of real watermelon!"

78
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,301
I mean, what's next?

79
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,937
Banana flavored popsicles
with skin?

80
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:22,809
Coconut popsicles with a
thick, though husk?

81
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:25,695
It makes me sick!
How do they expect me to eat this!

82
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:29,058
What do they take me for?
It is totally unacceptable!

83
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:31,486
And don't expect me
to go along with it, like:

84
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:36,502
"Oh, no problem!
Seeds in the popsicles? That's great!"

85
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:40,402
"I love that..."
Uuuugh!

86
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:48,726
I don't know...
I didn't ask for this, you know.

87
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:52,318
I didn't... I didn't ask
to be born.

88
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,318
Sometimes I just wanna...
I just wanna shut everything out.

89
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,258
Just relax.

90
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:15,357
What the...?

91
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:19,915
I can...
I can relax later or something.

92
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,607
Yeah.
I'm no--I'm not tired.

93
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:25,002
I should be working.

94
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:29,051
Yeah.
Get some work done.

95
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:31,772
I u--I used to
like my job, you know.

96
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:34,066
I write children's books.

97
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,903
Everything was going great.
You know, I work my own hours.

98
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:38,947
Something I like.
Good pay.

99
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,068
Boss was really tolerable.

100
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,887
- Thane, how are you?
- I'm good.

101
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,914
I just read
your latest submission.

102
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:48,378
Now, it's a little rough, and we
might have to tone it down a bit.

103
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:50,417
But I like the way
you think, Thane.

104
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:53,810
You are very creative.
Very different.

105
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,156
I like that.

106
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:57,954
Thanks, Marvin.
I'll rework it.

107
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:01,517
You know... you should
cheer up a little bit, Thane.

108
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,291
You're a bright kid.
You got a lot going for you.

109
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:05,975
Try smiling a little.

110
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:08,964
Smiling's never really been
one of my strong points.

111
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:11,683
Well, give it a try.
It's good for business.

112
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:15,329
You'd be surprised how many business deals
are made on personality alone.

113
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:16,938
<i>Then he gets married.</i>

114
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:18,766
He marries this...

115
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,204
...woman...

116
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:23,440
...who is, like, half his age,
which I have no problem with,

117
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,044
but she's, like,
this horrible person.

118
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:29,062
She's inhuman.
Melanie.

119
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,253
Me-la-nie.

120
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,554
- Marvin!
- Princess!

121
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:38,889
You have to get going, darling.
You have a very big lunch meeting.

122
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,901
Oh, uh... Thane, I'd like you
to meet my wife.

123
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,079
- This is Melanie.
- Oh, darling.

124
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:48,394
Please, let's not get into this.
We barely have enough time as it is.

125
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:50,391
- Well, I guess you're right.
- Of course I am.

126
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:51,910
Now let's just
get you to lunch,

127
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,501
and you let me handle
everything here at the office.

128
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:58,153
- I don't like him.
<i>- Now she makes all the decisions,</i>

129
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:01,366
which wouldn't be so bad
if someone else relayed them,

130
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,685
but you have to
listen to her speak.

131
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:05,191
She's totally self-indulgent.

132
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,604
She could listen to
her own voice for hours.

133
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:11,734
Not only do I not have a clue
as to what my boss sees in her,

134
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:15,560
but I would love to know how the earth
could just keep from opening up

135
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,904
<i>and sucking her into some deep,
dark, multidimensional void!</i>

136
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:22,977
<i>"You have to
make your dead line,</i>

137
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:26,535
<i>or we won't be able
to get the copy in on time."</i>

138
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,138
<i>She's always giving orders
that don't matter.</i>

139
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:33,004
Or she'll go off one some huge,
pathetic, condescending,

140
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:36,435
inaccurate lecture
on the meaning of life.

141
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:39,628
<i>"Some people are just
less capable than others."</i>

142
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,125
"People depending on
their upbringing and nationality,

143
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:48,013
<i>have different ability levels, and
have to be put into their correct category."</i>

144
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:53,408
Nightmare! It's like this incredibly
articulate way of saying:

145
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:56,216
"I'm hopelessly prejudiced.
Sorry."

146
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,952
But the horror
of all of this,

147
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:03,409
is you can't say anything,
because it's the boss' wife.

148
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:07,483
Right? So--so you just sit there and nod
so you don't lose your job,

149
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,338
and you hear yourself
saying things, like:

150
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:11,955
"Yeah... I guess."

151
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:15,378
Then you feel like the most
spineless loser on the planet,

152
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:17,699
because you've sacrificed
your self-worth,

153
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,242
and everything you value
and believe in,

154
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:24,411
because it might hurt you financially
if you speak up.

155
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,677
I-i-it's amazing what some people
are capable of.

156
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:39,304
Great.
It's not even 10 o'clock yet.

157
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:46,172
Hey, dorkhead!
Turn it down!

158
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,315
This guy's a perpetual
thorn in my side.

159
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:52,505
He plays music,
if that's what it is,

160
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:56,232
all day, at a volume that any
amphitheater would be envious of.

161
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:58,241
He never hears me yell,
which is no surprise.

162
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:01,556
I'm sure there's blood
constantly spewing from his ears.

163
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:06,048
There he goes.
There he goes.

164
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:10,215
Now, you tell me...
you tell me, just...

165
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,737
What the hell is that?

166
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:15,270
I mean... I mean, what is he doing,
some sort of gigantic boot dance?

167
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,626
I mean, what is that?

168
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,687
I can't even remotely imagine
just what in the hell...!

169
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:28,223
Oh my gosh.
I hope he didn't trip.

170
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:30,668
And hit his temple on
the power button of the stereo.

171
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:33,722
Accidentally turning it off, and
knocking himself into a permanent coma.

172
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:35,676
That would be terrible.
What would I do?

173
00:10:36,964 --> 00:10:40,361
I guess I should wait a couple of weeks
and see if something starts to smell.

174
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:49,341
- Yeah.
- <i>Tonight. At 8 o'clock.</i>

175
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:51,772
What?

176
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:54,566
What does that mean?

177
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,526
What the hell is that?
8 o'clock?

178
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,325
It's just some--some
jerk or something...

179
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:06,158
You know it used to be
peaceful around here.

180
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:10,084
The dog.
I forgot to bring in the dog.

181
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,591
Sorry about that.
This is my dog, Pete.

182
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:25,623
Please, don't think I'm crazy.
I'm not.

183
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:28,242
It's just that I don't believe
in real pets.

184
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:32,522
Sure, I know people love them.
They're cute, they're cuddly.

185
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:37,033
It's just that I have a hard time
imagining giving a place in my life

186
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:40,443
to some beast, that if worse
came to worse, would turn on me.

187
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:43,874
Because, that's the reality of it,
whether you want to admit it or not.

188
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:44,916
They're animals.

189
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:46,781
And if there was suddenly
a food shortage,

190
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:50,116
and the opportunity arose,
your precious little Fifi

191
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:54,017
wouldn't think twice about putting you
on the old smorgasbord list.

192
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:57,219
People just believe
what they wanna believe.

193
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:10,127
Remember when that plane
crashed in the snow,

194
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:12,285
and some of the people survived?

195
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:14,563
But they didn't get rescued
for a really long time

196
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:18,762
and they actually had to eat
the other passengers to stay alive?

197
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:23,839
I mean, that is a big,
moral decision.

198
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,903
If your life depended on it,
do you think you could do it?

199
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,855
I don't know,
I've thought about it a lot.

200
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,894
I figure they didn't
do anything wrong.

201
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:35,785
You know, I mean,
it was life and death.

202
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:38,425
I think I probably could
if my life was at stake.

203
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:42,653
I mean, it would have to be
a major, major deal, right?

204
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:45,239
Not like a long layover
or something like that.

205
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,647
I mean, none of it's, like:
"It's late in Dallas, the snack shop's closed;

206
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,174
let's eat Larry!"
You know.

207
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:51,884
I'd never go along with that.

208
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:55,538
I don't, uh...
think it's morally correct.

209
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:59,037
But, if it was life and death,
line 'em up.

210
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:01,060
Snack time, that's what I say.
Because, you gotta remember:

211
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,475
These people died in a plane crash.
You're not murdering anyone.

212
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,468
I could eat them.

213
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,917
Or maybe if a guy was
walking along, and he tripped,

214
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:10,264
and he hit his head on a rock,
and he wasn't dead,

215
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:12,861
but you knew he was gonna die...

216
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:14,518
I could probably
start eating him.

217
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:17,726
You know...
Like a coma.

218
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:20,629
But if he woke up, I'd stop.
'Cause I'd figure: "Hey,

219
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:25,215
that's normal, human etiquette, and
I'm not crossing that line for anybody."

220
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:26,593
"I'm sorry."

221
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,244
What the hell was--

222
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:33,867
Now, what the--

223
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:36,921
I must need sleep.

224
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:41,346
What?

225
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,474
What!

226
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:50,458
- Hi, sir, how are you today?
- Don't ask.

227
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,778
- You seem like an intelligent man.
- What are you selling?

228
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,214
Well, it's not so much
what I'm selling, sir,

229
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,030
as it is what I have to offer.

230
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,511
Oh, what do you have to offer
that just happens to cost money?

231
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,535
I offer security.

232
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,941
- Insurrance?
- That's right, sir.

233
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:10,413
I am so sorry.
Please, come in.

234
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,446
I... I feel like an idiot.

235
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:19,861
- I hope this is okay for you.
- Oh my, this is more than fine.

236
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,349
Thank you very much.

237
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:24,684
Uh, do you already carry
any kinds of insurrance?

238
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,836
Oh, let's not
talk about that now.

239
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:30,687
It must be fascinating,
what you do.

240
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,723
Well, yes, I-I... guess it is.

241
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,916
Oh, surely you're being modest.

242
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:39,757
I'll bet there are all kinds of people
that envy you, and you don't even know it.

243
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:42,290
- Well, I don't know about that.
- Oh, sure there are, I mean...

244
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,363
What you have is a dream life.
You're actually able to go door to door,

245
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:50,325
help people,
and still make a living.

246
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,370
- Yes, uh... I guess that's right.
- Of course it is.

247
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,267
And the beautiful thing?
It's a giving occupation.

248
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:00,429
With no concernable greed,
or any sort of self-interest,

249
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,168
or any attitude,
or doing anything you can

250
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,681
just to get people to buy something
they don't want or probably will never use,

251
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:08,731
and playing on people's inherent fears
and phobias just to make a buck.

252
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,253
You're not into that.

253
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:13,502
I think that's great.

254
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:17,550
Well...
Thank you.

255
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:19,960
Don't mention it.
Now, if you don't mind,

256
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,747
please tell me exactly what types
of policies can you offer?

257
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:25,422
- Well, uh, we have all kinds.
- Terrific.

258
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:28,770
Uh, do you presently carry
any kinds of insurrance?

259
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,774
- No. None at all.
- Ah.

260
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:32,720
Why is that?

261
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:36,002
Well, I've never been able
to afford it before, but...

262
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,819
I just kinda came into
this big inheritance.

263
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:43,888
To be honest with you, it's more money
than I know what to do with.

264
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:46,561
So for me, this is
a great opportunity.

265
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:50,954
A wise decision. How do you feel
about... life insurrance?

266
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,423
- Well, I want it, definitely.
- Great.

267
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:56,752
Uh, these are the different
amounts of coverage.

268
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:58,030
Oh, definitely this one.

269
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:00,323
That's the highest.

270
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:02,417
Better safe than sorry.

271
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,391
U-unless you think I should
go with one of the lower ones?

272
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:05,755
Maybe save myself
a little money?

273
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:08,789
I think it's best to go
with our first instinct.

274
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,150
Um...

275
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,807
- Do you have renters' insurrance?
- No, but I'd like it.

276
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:14,142
Good. Good.

277
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:16,444
I should take care
of my car insurrance too, you know.

278
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:20,721
I'm not very proud of this, but
it expired a couple of months ago, and...

279
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:23,548
I understand, that could
happen to anybody.

280
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:26,939
Tell me, is there a legal limit
to the number of policies one can own?

281
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,998
No, no.
There isn't at all.

282
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:30,630
- Great.
- Um...

283
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,284
Actually, I don't have
all the necessary paperwork

284
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:35,838
for all the different policies.

285
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:38,321
Would you have the time to come
down to our offices for just a few minutes?

286
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:40,501
- Absolutely.
- Terrific!

287
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,780
Yeah, I'd like to not
put this off very long, though.

288
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,368
I mean... well, you know
how important insurrance can be.

289
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:47,511
I certainly do.
We can leave right now.

290
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:49,519
Oh, I have an appointment
in a few minutes.

291
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,856
But if you promise me
you'll stay at the office,

292
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:53,954
I can be there
in about 45 minutes.

293
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,258
That would be perfect.
I'll have all the papers ready.

294
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:57,456
Great!

295
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,676
Here's my card.

296
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:03,329
Ray.
Fantastic, Ray.

297
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:06,090
- And your name?
- Thane. Thane Furrows.

298
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,529
Thane.
I'll see you in 45 minutes, Thane.

299
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:10,640
Great. Oh, Ray,
there is just one thing.

300
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,905
Sure, anything.

301
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:15,771
Well, there is one little problem about
buying these policies from you.

302
00:17:15,871 --> 00:17:17,266
Oh, what's that?

303
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,622
I'd rather be dead!

304
00:17:30,797 --> 00:17:32,232
I hate salesmen.

305
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:35,401
I always have hated salesmen,
I always will hate salesmen.

306
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:38,915
They're the ultimate slime of the earth.
I hate being around them.

307
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,541
I'd rather brush my teeth
and drink orange juice.

308
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:44,223
They only thing they care about,
is tricking people

309
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:46,365
and making them afraid
not to buy.

310
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,998
That steams me. And I usually
don't get worked up very easily.

311
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:52,759
But this just cuts me
right to the bone.

312
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:03,717
Every year, eight people die
because of letter bombs.

313
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,997
Six of those eight
are said to be in junk mail.

314
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:09,479
Now, I'm not paranoid,

315
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,680
but I certainly don't wanna be
tearing open a Christmas card,

316
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,733
and spend the rest of my life looking like
some biology student's wall chart.

317
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:22,893
I hate these.

318
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:25,006
This--this is
one of those advertisements

319
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:27,271
where they want you to think
it's a letter from a friend.

320
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:30,566
but with a computer,
they insert your name in a copy,

321
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,977
and keep referring back to you
throughout the letter.

322
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:34,922
I mean, look at this.

323
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:37,839
You know, I wonder
which word was inserted here.

324
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,585
This must be
a personal letter just to me.

325
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:43,682
"Hello, T. Furrows."

326
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:48,058
"We would like to introduce you
to the wonderful world of mortgages."

327
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:49,372
Because it's so realistic.

328
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:52,664
Because so many of my friends
call me "T. Furrows."

329
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:56,653
Here's another one.

330
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,660
"Great news, T. Furrows!"

331
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,044
"Three of these four people
have already won $100,000."

332
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:09,536
"Mrs. Beatrice Daniels,
Mr. Arthur Penance,

333
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:13,837
Lyla Bellish, and...
T. Furrows!"

334
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:19,456
Boy... I wonder which of these four
is gonna be the big loser here.

335
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,718
Oh...
A dating service.

336
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:30,926
"Why, when there are thousands
of single, eligible people in this area,

337
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:35,790
do we spend so much time alone,
or in relationships of convenience?"

338
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:40,914
"Your name may have been
recommended by an existing member,

339
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,178
or it may have been
on one of the select lists

340
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:45,722
we use to search out
quality people."

341
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:50,511
Great.

342
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:53,591
So you pay a lot of money
to go down to this little office,

343
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:56,891
and watch a bunch
of other losers on video tape,

344
00:19:56,991 --> 00:20:00,102
who are also stupid enough
to pay a lot of money.

345
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:01,890
Then you go out
on a loser date,

346
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,209
and, of course, you have
a really great time, because...

347
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,889
...you're losers.

348
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:09,249
Then you get married,
you have a couple of kids,

349
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:14,281
but one night you're watching TV,
and this real estate seminar comes on.

350
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:18,864
It says you can make a million dollars
in less than a year.

351
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:23,759
So you both talk it over, and decide
it's a really... "good move."

352
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:27,756
And you invest your life savings,
and you lose it.

353
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:28,931
And you know why?

354
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:33,011
Because you've based your entire
relationship and life

355
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:36,857
on the fact that you instantly respond
to bogus advertisements.

356
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:41,543
But that's not the catastrophe.
The catstrophe is that you have kids.

357
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,404
Little losers.

358
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:46,391
You've inbred a new incredibly
gullable breed of human

359
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,702
that will be taken advantage of
their entire life.

360
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:51,148
Then they'll meet
someone else's little losers

361
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,023
at another video dating service,

362
00:20:53,123 --> 00:20:55,583
and after a few generations,
evolution will take over

363
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:58,084
and there''ll be an entirely new
pathetic breed of people

364
00:20:58,184 --> 00:21:01,628
that will only be capable
of saying "okay" and writing checks.

365
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:06,350
And all because you really thought
you'd been handpicked

366
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,471
by an honest dating company
searching for quality people!

367
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,496
The hell is this?

368
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,030
What's that supposed to mean?

369
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,392
Some joke.

370
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,983
Somebody probably
put it in with my mail.

371
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:45,828
She still writes me.

372
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:50,557
It's been four years,
and she still writes.

373
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,789
Relationships.

374
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:55,985
Y-yeah, th-they shouldn't even
call them relationships.

375
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:58,548
They should have
a more descriptive, like...

376
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,781
Pain Land, or something.

377
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:03,691
I mean, you could be
madly in love with someone,

378
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,653
do everything in your power
to make it work,

379
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:09,609
and then all of a sudden,
they're not interested.

380
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,258
So, no problem,
you scrape yourself up,

381
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:14,636
and when you finally
get them out of your system

382
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:20,080
so you can meagerly continue on with
what's left of your semi-shattered life,

383
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:21,734
they want you back.

384
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:25,912
It's like, the only prerequisite
to acquiring their devotion

385
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,212
was to not want or need them.

386
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:31,062
So she still writes me.

387
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:33,212
Well, I'm not gonna
read the letter.

388
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,257
I'm not gonna read it.

389
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:37,980
There's no way.

390
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:47,003
I mean, what is the motivation behind
making someone's life miserable,

391
00:22:47,103 --> 00:22:49,658
and as soon as they can get along
without wanting to die,

392
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,953
you step into the picture again?

393
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:53,325
You know?
I mean, it's like...

394
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:55,435
"Oh, I heard your life
is going well."

395
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:59,326
"You know, I thought we might be
able to get into that old groove again."

396
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:02,206
"You know, the one where you
love me more than anything,

397
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:05,283
and I give nothing in return
and act uncaring?"

398
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:08,477
"I think I was much happier
when life was like that."

399
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,167
H-how about the ones
who will date you for several years,

400
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,034
and then say:
"Let's just be friends."

401
00:23:15,134 --> 00:23:18,159
And then they're shocked
that it crushes you.

402
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:20,469
I mean, "let's just be friends."

403
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:22,921
I mean, that--that's like your mom
coming up to you and saying:

404
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:26,180
"Honey, I still love you a lot,
but when we're in public,

405
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,957
don't call me Mom.
Call me Marge."

406
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,198
"Let's still be friends."

407
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,037
Which is the perfect scenario for them,
because it means:

408
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:38,516
"Oh, I don't want anything
to do with you anymore,

409
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:42,193
but you know, it'd be really
convenient for me if I felt no guilt,

410
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:44,636
and you were still there for me
if I ever wanted to talk to you

411
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:46,647
or have you help me
with my life."

412
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:48,444
Well, I don't think so!

413
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,592
I don't think so!

414
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:57,688
Hey, I g--I gotta get
an unlisted number.

415
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,885
Screening.

416
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:08,199
<i>Please don't leave a message
unless it's vital.</i>

417
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,093
<i>Thane?
Are you there?</i>

418
00:24:12,512 --> 00:24:14,866
<i>Pick up the phone, Thane.</i>

419
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:19,077
<i>Oh, it's so nice
to have the whole day free.</i>

420
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:22,854
<i>The entire day
just to sit here and relax.</i>

421
00:24:22,955 --> 00:24:25,225
<i>I wonder how long this tape is.</i>

422
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:29,330
- Hello, Mom.
- Oh, hello, honey.

423
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,590
I had a feeling
you were there.

424
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:34,966
Have you been eating well?
How's your diet?

425
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:38,157
- I'm not on a diet.
- You know what I mean.

426
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:41,652
You never eat right, and if you
don't eat right, you're gonna get sick.

427
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:47,922
Now, I was reading in this magazine,
and it said that cabbage can prevent cancer.

428
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:51,456
- Have you been eating cabbage?
- That is so weird.

429
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:55,020
- There's a plate of it right in front of me.
- Don't be smart!

430
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,122
I wonder what's better,

431
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:59,655
having cancer, or having to
eat cabbage all of the time.

432
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:02,728
You're not funny.
This is serious!

433
00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:07,484
I was talking to Elyse,
and she told me that her son, Bruno...

434
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,853
You know, Bruno, the one
with that big thing on his nose.

435
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:14,629
I don't know why
they never had that thing removed.

436
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:18,224
It looks like someone shot him
with a potato gun, and it stuck.

437
00:25:18,324 --> 00:25:22,529
Anyway, Elyse told me
that Bruno wasn't feeling well,

438
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:25,205
and the doctor told him
that he was...

439
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:27,061
She'll talk for hours.

440
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:30,332
You know, it doesn't matter about who,
or what, or why,

441
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:34,478
just as long as there's
some sort of volume exiting her lips.

442
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:37,350
- ...serious problems.
- Yeah. Uh-huh?

443
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,886
There's a lot of people like that.
I don't know what it is.

444
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:42,400
Yeah...
They'll just go on and on,

445
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,090
you know, sucking away your life,
draining you like a vampire.

446
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,379
And if you don't start eating better,
you're gonna end up in trouble too.

447
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:51,738
- Yeah.
- Now.

448
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:54,203
- Uh-huh?
- Don't get me wrong, Thane.

449
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:58,227
I'm not trying to nag you.
It's just that I worry.

450
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:00,225
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- All you ever eat is cereal.

451
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,899
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- And a person needs more than that.

452
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:04,704
I really should be working.

453
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:07,716
You know, I'm already past
the deadline on my new book.

454
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,570
If I don't turn it in soon,
the she-devil will make my life hell.

455
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,562
- <i>Really?</i>
- You know...

456
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:15,388
I would always
make my deadlines,

457
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:18,607
if they wouldn't just keep rejecting
entire projects I turn in.

458
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:20,282
You know, like they have
nothing better to do,

459
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:22,597
than to think of reasons
I should have to work more.

460
00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:24,710
Is it some sort of
sadistic pleasure?

461
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,301
I mean, I'll work on a project for three days,
rework it for another two,

462
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:30,602
turn in an example...
Wham!

463
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:35,345
"It's not sensitive to kids.
Oh, it's too scary."

464
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:37,697
Just totally overreacting.

465
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,928
<i>- You're right.
- You're going to have to...</i>

466
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,801
- <i>What was that?</i>
- Uhm, the...

467
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:51,744
- My clock alarm going of.
- What, do you have it around your neck?

468
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:54,859
Uh, no, I was...
Laying down here next to it.

469
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,428
<i>Laying down?</i>

470
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:59,424
<i>It's nearly 1 in the afternoon,
you can't lay down now.</i>

471
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,333
<i>It's only a few hours
until 8!</i>

472
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:05,405
Mom?

473
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:14,188
- Hello?
<i>- Why'd you hang up?</i>

474
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:16,844
I didn't hang up.
I got cut off.

475
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:18,681
<i>What was that you said
about 8 o'clock?</i>

476
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:21,569
- What?
- You said something about 8 o'clock.

477
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:23,750
<i>No I didn't.
Are you okay?</i>

478
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,318
Look, Mo--Mom, I... I gott--I gotta go.
Okay? There's someone at the door.

479
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:28,752
I-I'll talk to you later.
Okay, see you, bye.

480
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,561
This is crazy.

481
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:37,836
I gotta get some work done.

482
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,007
Why do I have to
please other people with my work?

483
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:51,314
I mean, I work countless hours
on valuable product,

484
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:53,514
just to see it
get turned down.

485
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:56,306
And who loses here?
Is it me?

486
00:27:56,406 --> 00:27:59,651
No. No, it's not me.
It's the kids.

487
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:01,474
The kids lose.

488
00:28:01,574 --> 00:28:05,505
Valuable information
and mental growth cut off

489
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:09,170
because someone didn't have
the foresight to see the need.

490
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,161
Here... I-I'll show you.

491
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,353
H-here's one
they turned down.

492
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:18,145
Now here's a book that
does more than just kill time.

493
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:22,529
It helps the kid to spot the symptoms
if his mother's being unfaithful.

494
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:24,282
Here's another one.

495
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,731
Now, they really
misinterpreted this one.

496
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:34,548
My whole intent here, was to
have an instruction manual

497
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:37,340
that even a child
could understand.

498
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,334
Only to be used
in grave circumstances.

499
00:28:42,434 --> 00:28:44,962
I mean, you know, like,
somebody's choking on a chicken bone,

500
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:47,771
and they have to be taken to the hospital,
but there are no adults around,

501
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:50,268
I mean, what are you gonna do,
let them die?

502
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:54,252
Yeah, you know, I guess
some people probably would.

503
00:28:58,544 --> 00:29:02,270
Now this...
is my pride and joy.

504
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,763
I haven't even
told them about it yet.

505
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:07,478
It's a pop-up book.
My first one.

506
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,219
It's called
<i>What Happened to Grandma?</i>

507
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,139
Well, that's one of the
working titles.

508
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:16,596
It deals with the passing
of a loved one.

509
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:19,884
But the beautiful thing is,
as you can see,

510
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,584
when you open it up...

511
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,772
As this can be a very trying
and traumatic time for children,

512
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:31,892
this book helps point out
that Grandma isn't gone forever,

513
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:35,283
she's just sort of
relocated without her body.

514
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:37,979
It also points out
the very real possibility

515
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,037
that they're just one little car wreck away
from going there themselves.

516
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,244
But... there's no hope.
They'll probably reject this one, too.

517
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:51,661
And you know why? Because they're
trying to keep children mindless.

518
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:56,911
They're trying to block them from having
the ability to think for themselves.

519
00:29:57,787 --> 00:30:03,084
To think that the futures of hundreds
of thousands of innocent children

520
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:07,975
are being programmed to do and think
whatever Big Brother tells them,

521
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,951
just makes me sick!

522
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:14,082
I have no intention
of participating any longer

523
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,913
in the vegetation
of the young mind!

524
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:20,995
I won't do it!
I'd rather be dead!

525
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:25,277
Oh, great.

526
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:10,774
You're mine.

527
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:24,650
The door was open,
so I let myself in.

528
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:28,869
Were you
trying to get this?

529
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:29,922
No.

530
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:32,321
I wa--I was just messin' around.

531
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:36,503
"Messin' around?"
"Messin' around," he says?

532
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:40,263
He's got three deadlines hanging
over his head, and he's messin' around?

533
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:44,837
You had better
pull yourself together, mister!

534
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:46,907
You are threading
on thin ice!

535
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,778
I have not been impressed
with your work of late,

536
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:50,683
and if I don't see some sort
of improvement soon,

537
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:53,296
there's going to be
all kinds of trouble!

538
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:57,205
These kinds of jobs don't
grow on trees, you know, Thane.

539
00:32:57,305 --> 00:33:01,863
There are a lot of talented people out there
that would kill to be in your shoes.

540
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:06,183
You've had it pretty easy in the past,
and I tell you it has hurt you.

541
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,287
The problem with you is,
you are not a dedicated worker.

542
00:33:12,387 --> 00:33:13,645
I need an ashtray.

543
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:16,394
Oh...
I don--I don't have one.

544
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:18,466
Fine, I'll use this.

545
00:33:20,828 --> 00:33:23,381
It is very important that you
become a dedicated worker, Thane.

546
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,752
Your future at Shangri-La Books
depends on it.

547
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:28,938
You've gotta think about this, Thane.
Your future is at stake!

548
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,623
I'll tell you, Marvin is
not going to like this.

549
00:33:32,723 --> 00:33:34,721
No, Marvin wouldn't care
about any of this.

550
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:38,107
And Marvin wouldn't have
broken into my house!

551
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,870
Unless--unless the door were open.

552
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,562
Then he... he might
have let himself in.

553
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:47,166
I mean...
Who wouldn't, right?

554
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:51,037
I cant' stand it!
I... I can't stand it!

555
00:33:51,137 --> 00:33:53,812
I'm a weasel!
Just tell her off!

556
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:55,879
Wy can't I just
tell her off?

557
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:58,901
I'll lose my job.
I don't wanna lose my job.

558
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,412
This is a nightmare!

559
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:03,450
See, now, I'm just gonna sit there,
and never bring up the fact

560
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:06,916
that she's a horrible person,
no matter what she says.

561
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:10,423
I don't believe this!
I wish I were dead!

562
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:16,425
So, let me tell you, I am so tired
of all the inept people at the office.

563
00:34:16,525 --> 00:34:19,161
A'll I'm surrounded by
is ineptness.

564
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:22,642
Now don't get me wrong, Thane,
you are not totally inept.

565
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,233
Of course you need a lot of work,
but who doesn't?

566
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,707
It's all upbringing.
I'm one of the lucky ones.

567
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:30,408
Take minorities, for instance.

568
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:33,919
They're not inferior because
they are genetically different.

569
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,869
They're inferior
because of upbringing.

570
00:34:37,426 --> 00:34:41,020
How--how do you listen to
a statement like that, and just sit there?

571
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,279
Oh, man!
I'm a wreck.

572
00:34:43,888 --> 00:34:46,270
I... I can't deal with it.

573
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:49,190
What--what am I saying?

574
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:51,558
What am I saying?

575
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:57,094
How important is a job
if you have to sacrifice your integrity?

576
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,622
I won't have it.

577
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:02,853
I won't have it!

578
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:07,157
Wait a second!
Now just wait a second!

579
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:08,814
You're wrong.

580
00:35:09,422 --> 00:35:12,223
You're racist,
and you're wrong.

581
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,641
And I--and I'm sorry,
if you wanna get me fired,

582
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:17,548
because I don't agree with
your perjudicial statements,

583
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:21,086
fine, but what you said
was wrong.

584
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:25,576
That sounded pretty good.
I'll try that.

585
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:30,038
For instance, I was watching
one of these freedom rallies on the news.

586
00:35:30,138 --> 00:35:32,467
Some other backwards country,
I'm not sure which one.

587
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,107
And I started thinking:

588
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:38,173
"How horrible freedom can be."

589
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:40,981
"Our country could
learn something from this."

590
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:43,564
The only people
making the decisions,

591
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:45,731
should be those few
that are mentally capable.

592
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:48,849
You can't give the general public
a say in what goes on.

593
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:52,080
They're unable to render
an intelligent decision.

594
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,586
There are very few smart enough
and wise enough

595
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,278
to be making those decisions.

596
00:35:57,378 --> 00:36:00,615
And you can usually
a person's worth by their income.

597
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:04,152
I think you should only be allowed
to vote if you make over, say...

598
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:06,216
200,000 a year.

599
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:08,874
It's just plain, common sense,
don't you agree, Thane?

600
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:13,586
Thane?
Don't you agree?

601
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:15,645
Well...

602
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,903
Yeah...

603
00:36:23,163 --> 00:36:26,869
I don't believe it!
How can I agree with her?

604
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:29,076
There's no excuse!
I should be killed!

605
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:33,189
I should be skinned alive
and then rolled around in salt!

606
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:36,290
Now...
About your work.

607
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,420
As of late, I've been
very unimpressed.

608
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,716
You seem bent on these
unconventional tactics

609
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,302
that frankly, I think stink.

610
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,965
I came to pick up your new book
you've been so secretive about.

611
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:49,453
Is it finished?

612
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,797
Y-yeah, it's finished.
It's right in front of you.

613
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:57,159
- What was it doing behind the couch?
- It's a long story.

614
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,878
- <i>Bye Bye, Grandma?</i>
- It's a working title.

615
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:02,478
I'm also thinking of
<i>What Happened to Grandma?</i>

616
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:07,336
<i>Bye Bye, Grandma.</i>
It's cute, I like it.

617
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,672
The great thing is,
it's a pop-up book.

618
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:11,283
We don't do pop-ups.

619
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:14,061
It's something new.

620
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:19,765
Yes... A pop-up.

621
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:24,674
Oh!

622
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:26,560
What is this?

623
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,676
This is sick!
We can't sell that!

624
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:31,034
- Why not?
- Because it's not nice!

625
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,331
Of course it's not nice!
Death rarely is.

626
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:35,356
Death?

627
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:38,704
What are you writing about death for?
These are children's books!

628
00:37:38,804 --> 00:37:40,924
Death is the last thing
on their minds!

629
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:42,824
Why can't you write about
bunnies or something?

630
00:37:42,924 --> 00:37:44,750
I don't wanna
write about bunnies!

631
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,188
- Look at Murray Craig.
- Please, don't bring up Murray Craig.

632
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:51,678
- Murray Craig is our top writer.
- I know Murray Craig is the top writer!

633
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:53,818
I know Murray Craig
makes a lot of money!

634
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:56,463
But Murray Craig has
the mind of an ostrich!

635
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:58,574
- His books sell!
- He's uncreative!

636
00:37:58,674 --> 00:38:02,469
He is not uncreative.
He is the creator of Happy the Clam.

637
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:04,922
P-please, please, don't bring up
Happy the Clam.

638
00:38:05,022 --> 00:38:08,263
Happy the Clam is,
and has been for the past 10 years,

639
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:11,304
our number one marketable figure.
Everyone loves Happy the Clam.

640
00:38:11,404 --> 00:38:13,597
Children love Happy the Clam.
Parents love Happy the Clam.

641
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:15,948
My husband and I
both love Happy the Clam.

642
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:18,795
- It's a stupid concept!
- It is not a stupid concept!

643
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:22,190
It's a clam!
A clam!

644
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,591
Could you possibly pick
a more distant, non-feeling,

645
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:29,181
totally unemotional...
thing!

646
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:31,426
I mean, they have
no distinguishable features,

647
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,592
absolutely no
measureable intelligence,

648
00:38:33,692 --> 00:38:36,175
they're disgusting,
squishy...!

649
00:38:40,406 --> 00:38:42,234
I mean, look at this.
Look at it!

650
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:47,292
There's legs sticking out of its shell,
it's sideways, and of course, a hat!

651
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,175
A clam with a hat!

652
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:51,602
"Oh look, honey, the Clams
have come over for dinner!"

653
00:38:51,702 --> 00:38:55,048
"Hello, Mr. Clam. Would you
like me to take your... hat?!"

654
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:57,644
Happy the Clam
is a mindless creation!

655
00:38:57,744 --> 00:39:01,002
There is nothing appealing about him!
There is nothing redeeming about him!

656
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:05,196
He represents everything
I hate in life!

657
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:07,229
I hate him!
I always have hated him!

658
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:12,477
I always will hate him!
I hate Happy the Clam!

659
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:17,516
I will not sit here and listen to you
badmouth Happy the Clam!

660
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:22,186
If you are looking to lose your job,
mister, you are on the right track!

661
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:24,483
This company
was founded 12 years ago,

662
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:27,684
and thanks to Murray's creation
of Happy the Clam,

663
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:31,651
for the past 10 years,
has been showing a sizable profit!

664
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,698
So you may not like
Happy the Clam,

665
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:35,877
but Happy the Clam
pays the bills!

666
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:39,372
And whether you like it or not,
if it weren't for Happy the Clam,

667
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:43,441
you wouldn't have a job!

668
00:39:47,657 --> 00:39:49,530
Maybe I--maybe I was
a little rash.

669
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,146
I have to...
I have to apologize.

670
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:58,779
I did forget one key use
for Happy the Clam.

671
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:03,970
I forgot that Happy the Clam
could be rolled up into a little ball,

672
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,377
and shoved up your butt!

673
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:08,979
That's what I forgot!
Silly me!

674
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,513
And as far as the company
being here for 12 years,

675
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:14,132
how would you know?

676
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:17,399
You've only been
screwing up things for 2!

677
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,497
And now, let's analyze
how she got the job.

678
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:22,993
Did she graduate
from college? Ehh!

679
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:26,380
Did she study her craft
for long hours? Ehh!

680
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,877
Well, then surely she inherited
the business from her father? Ehh!

681
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:34,624
You know how she got the job?
She slept with the boss!

682
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,946
That's how she got the job!

683
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,781
Oh, no!
So soon?

684
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:46,777
Please come back!
I love these little chats we have!

685
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,681
Surely, you can stay
a little longer?

686
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,515
What have I done?

687
00:40:56,615 --> 00:41:00,826
My job! Ugh!
How am I gonna eat?

688
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:13,272
I... I was...

689
00:41:13,372 --> 00:41:15,948
I was never crazy
about that job, anyway.

690
00:41:24,054 --> 00:41:25,295
Smokers.

691
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:29,415
There's no excuse
for smoking.

692
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,700
I can't stand smoke.

693
00:41:33,476 --> 00:41:37,575
A hobby that makes you die.

694
00:41:38,884 --> 00:41:42,566
I mean, that's the equivalent
of always carrying around a salt lick

695
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,024
laced with a tiny bit
of cyanide.

696
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:48,479
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Oh, nothing, just a hobby."

697
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:53,573
"Whoa...
I'm getting kinda dizzy."

698
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:57,461
What about people
who say they're gonna quit,

699
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:59,207
and you see them,
like an hour later,

700
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:01,072
with a butt hanging
out of their mouth?

701
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:04,117
I mean, what--what if Gandhi
had that kind of willpower?

702
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:08,871
"I will not eat until there is
complete freedom and independence."

703
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:12,409
"Is that a Butterfinger?"

704
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:16,057
I mean, what--what does the
Surgeon General have to print

705
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:18,137
to get his point across?

706
00:42:18,484 --> 00:42:24,075
"Warning: If you do this,
you will die. You know, die?"

707
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:28,218
"Dead-O-Rama?
You won't be alive anymore."

708
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,316
"Un-alive.
You'll take a dirt nap."

709
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,398
"You'll be paying a personal visit
directly to Elvis."

710
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:38,575
"It will be over. Your friends will
no longer be able to visit you."

711
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:41,866
"Your mail will stop coming.
You will be dead."

712
00:42:41,966 --> 00:42:44,072
"Aerobics will be
out of the quesion."

713
00:42:44,172 --> 00:42:47,452
"Worms will have a new
and sudden attraction to you."

714
00:42:47,552 --> 00:42:52,272
"If you do this,
you... will... die!"

715
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,544
But it still wouldn't work.
And you know why?

716
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:58,528
Because they'd just say:

717
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:02,224
"Well, my grandfather
smoked three packs a day,

718
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:05,047
and he lived to be
93 years old."

719
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:09,539
Yeah. What they forget to tell you,
is he had one lung, breathed like a walrus,

720
00:43:09,638 --> 00:43:14,875
and couldn't tell you who he was.
Boy... that's living!

721
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,951
I was in Las Vegas.
Don't ask me why.

722
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:24,581
I got a ticket for making
a right-hand turn on a red light.

723
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:27,808
That's against the law
in Las Vegas.

724
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:30,560
Prostitution is legal.

725
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:35,000
But I made the huge mistake of
making a right-hand turn on a red light.

726
00:43:35,595 --> 00:43:39,249
I could have been having sex
on the hood of the car,

727
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:41,368
in the middle
of the intersection,

728
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:46,697
no problem... but I made
a right-hand turn on a red light.

729
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,423
Yeah, I probably
could have got out of it,

730
00:43:48,523 --> 00:43:52,255
if I told the cop I was a pimp,
and late for a collection.

731
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:55,533
But, yeah,  then he probably would
have asked to see my hat,

732
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,231
and I would have
been stuck.

756
00:45:12,218 --> 00:45:14,794
Now when you
say professionally,

757
00:45:14,894 --> 00:45:16,790
do you mean by, like,
a doctor or a lawyer?

758
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,935
Because, I wouldn't think those guys
had that kind of time.

Sorry, let me put it another way.

00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:26,843
This is really stupid.

826
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,944
A big, elaborate joke.

827
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,486
Maybe I should have gone
to the restaurant with Al.

828
00:49:34,114 --> 00:49:37,148
What am I saying?
This is probably all Al's idea.

829
00:49:37,868 --> 00:49:41,242
Boy. He's amazing, going through
all that trouble, you know?

830
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:44,284
Al.

831
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:49,241
He's... he's one of these guys
that's always the voice of reason.

832
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:53,432
You know, totally idealistic,
but he calls it optimism.

833
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,720
Everything is okay
and positive.

834
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,248
Plus, he has this horrible
habit of always saying:

835
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:03,092
"Hey, you know, in 10 years,
this isn't even gonna matter."

836
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:06,195
And you know you're screwed
when he says that,

837
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:10,238
because he only uses it when he
can't think of a bright side either.

838
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:14,131
Plus, he always wants to go
to restaurants, and I hate restaurants.

839
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:18,054
They're very unenjoyable.
I hate those theme restaurants.

840
00:50:18,154 --> 00:50:21,186
You know, the one's where they put
the wrong names on the bathroom door?

841
00:50:21,286 --> 00:50:22,769
Like, instead of
"Men" and "Women",

842
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:25,631
they'll put some cute name,
like "Buccaneer."

843
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,945
All right, but then sometimes
it's like such a cute name

844
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:31,181
that you're not quite sure,
and like an absolute moron,

845
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:33,313
you have to walk up
to the hostess and go:

846
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:38,075
"Uh, yeah, am I a 'Squid' or a 'Halibut'?
What the hell's happening here?"

847
00:50:38,767 --> 00:50:41,023
Then you have to deal
with the waitresses.

848
00:50:41,123 --> 00:50:43,726
You ever get those ones
that love to refill coffee?

849
00:50:43,826 --> 00:50:46,182
They won't stop.
Yeah, you've seen 'em.

850
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:49,348
"Little more coffee for you there?"
"Heat it up a little bit?"

851
00:50:49,448 --> 00:50:51,945
"How about just a touch more?"
"Cap that off for ya?"

852
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:53,993
"Little more?"
"A tad more?"

853
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:55,415
"Come on."

854
00:50:55,515 --> 00:50:57,960
Even if you don't drink any,
they still come by.

855
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,465
"I think we can squeeze
a little more in there."

856
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:04,633
"Don't move the table."

857
00:51:06,652 --> 00:51:09,752
Or what's worse,
the how-ya-doin' waitress.

858
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:13,313
Everyone's had her.
It's like a horror movie.

859
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:17,262
- "How ya doin'?"
- "Good."

860
00:51:17,362 --> 00:51:19,216
She comes back
in a couple of minutes...

861
00:51:19,316 --> 00:51:21,672
- "How ya doin'?"
- "Good."

862
00:51:21,772 --> 00:51:23,593
- "Things all right?"
- "Yeah."

863
00:51:23,693 --> 00:51:25,588
- "How ya doin'?"
- "Fine."

864
00:51:25,688 --> 00:51:27,713
- "Things okay?"
- "Yeah."

865
00:51:27,813 --> 00:51:29,492
- "How ya doin' now?"
- "Good."

866
00:51:29,592 --> 00:51:31,086
- "Things okay?"
- "Yeah."

867
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:32,558
- "How ya doin'?"
- "Fine!"

868
00:51:32,658 --> 00:51:33,824
- "Things okay?"
- "Uh-huh."

869
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:34,938
- "How ya doin'?"
- "Good!"

870
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:35,990
- "Things all right?"
- "Yeah!"

871
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,170
- "How ya doi--"
- "Listen!"

872
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:42,131
"I told you!
I'm fine!"

873
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:47,482
"Oh... my..."

874
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:50,047
"How ya doin'?
Things okay?"

875
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:55,105
I went to the Texas State Fair.

876
00:51:55,205 --> 00:51:57,649
Boy, there's something
that should be abolished.

877
00:51:57,749 --> 00:51:59,770
State fairs.

878
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,513
I mean, everything's fake.

879
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:03,864
You know, like, they had
the tallest man in the world.

880
00:52:03,964 --> 00:52:07,294
You go inside,
he's like 6'9''.

881
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:11,159
O-oh, there was this tent
with the Turtle Lady inside.

882
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:13,760
On the outside of the tent,
there was this tape playing:

883
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,528
"The Turtle Lady!
Come in and see the Turtle Lady!"

884
00:52:18,628 --> 00:52:22,354
"You can talk to her!"
And that was their big selling point.

885
00:52:22,454 --> 00:52:24,026
You can talk to her.

886
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:26,291
So finally, I get curious.

887
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:29,477
I pay the buck,
I go inside.

888
00:52:31,252 --> 00:52:36,597
So I'm inside this little tent,
just me and the Turtle Lady.

889
00:52:36,816 --> 00:52:38,858
And I suddenly realize:

890
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:41,758
"I have nothing to say
to a Turtle Lady."

891
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,608
I mean, what do you say?

892
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:47,877
"Hey... How about those Dodgers...
huh, Turtle Lady?"

893
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:49,992
"Some weather that we're--"

894
00:52:50,092 --> 00:52:52,563
There's nothing to say
to a Turtle Lady!

895
00:52:52,663 --> 00:52:56,226
Or, if it's not fake, they'll take
someone with a physical defect,

896
00:52:56,326 --> 00:52:58,511
and sensationalize it.

897
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:03,031
"Come see the man
with no lips!"

898
00:53:03,131 --> 00:53:05,387
"He has no lips!"

899
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:10,128
"Whistle? I don't think so!
He can't; he has no lips!"

900
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,378
"He's lipless!"

901
00:53:12,478 --> 00:53:14,793
"Drink out of a straw?
Think again!"

902
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:16,956
"Come in and talk to him!"

903
00:53:17,056 --> 00:53:19,568
"But don't expect to hear
any Ps or Bs!"

904
00:53:19,668 --> 00:53:22,585
"He can't make them!
He has no lips!"

905
00:53:22,984 --> 00:53:24,891
So you get curious,
pay the buck,

906
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:27,214
and you're face-to-face
with this guy...

907
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,806
"How ya doin'?"

908
00:53:31,235 --> 00:53:32,335
Whoa!

909
00:53:39,627 --> 00:53:42,567
Oh, come on!
What the hell is this?

910
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:01,123
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

911
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,804
<i>Open your eyes.
Come on, open 'em.</i>

912
00:54:11,029 --> 00:54:12,352
What's with you?

913
00:54:12,452 --> 00:54:14,020
You looked like you were
in a trance or something.

914
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,776
The door was open,
so I let myself in.

915
00:54:15,876 --> 00:54:18,382
Oh, maybe I should just
have my door removed!

916
00:54:18,482 --> 00:54:20,309
Hey, temper, temper.
What...

917
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:23,339
- Y-you look like you saw a ghost.
- I did!

918
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,059
There was a...
I keep seeing...

919
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,004
Maybe I just
need some sleep.

920
00:54:32,526 --> 00:54:33,852
Let's order a pizza.

921
00:54:33,952 --> 00:54:36,191
I hate pizza!
Those guys touch the food!

922
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:39,337
- I know a guy that found a toe nail--
- Oh, come on! What...!

923
00:54:39,437 --> 00:54:41,925
Where do you hear these stories?
A toe nail.

924
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:44,706
Besides, you hate all food.
Wait, uh--I take that back.

925
00:54:44,806 --> 00:54:47,325
Cereal.
Heh, you like cereal.

926
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:50,464
- Great idea.
- I don't want cereal!

927
00:54:52,393 --> 00:54:54,225
Make it hot cereal.

928
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:59,080
You're in an extra rare mood today.
You wanna talk about it?

929
00:54:59,946 --> 00:55:02,952
- I-I-I don't think so.
- Okay.

930
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,761
- I think I lost my job.
- Really?

931
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:10,061
Yeah.

932
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,643
Tha--that's all the milk
you're gonna use?

933
00:55:16,743 --> 00:55:19,792
Absolutely.
This time I got it beat.

934
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,944
So, uh, what's the deal
with your job?

935
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:26,759
Melanie came over
for my new book.

936
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:31,251
- And I kinda told her off.
- Ho ho! Head honcho, huh?

937
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:33,838
Uh, you "kinda" told her off?
What exactly does that mean?

938
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:38,417
I told her, the only reason
she has a job,

939
00:55:38,517 --> 00:55:40,873
was because she
slept with the boss.

940
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:43,797
Oh, man!

941
00:55:44,155 --> 00:55:46,424
Do you think this'll affect
my Christmas bonus?

942
00:55:46,524 --> 00:55:48,384
Well, at least you
went out with a flare.

943
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:51,207
Yeah. I don't know
what I'm gonna do about money.

944
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:54,516
Hey, 10 years, this isn't
even gonna matter.

945
00:55:55,213 --> 00:55:57,840
You gotta relax.
You're too tense.

946
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,383
No, I'm not.

947
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,849
- Look at your foot.
- What?

948
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:07,338
I just do that so...
bugs won't get on it.

949
00:56:08,403 --> 00:56:10,634
I... uh--I'll bet you five bucks

950
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:13,161
you can't stop shakin' your foot
for five minutes straight.

951
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:16,328
- You're tossing your money away.
- Five?

952
00:56:16,428 --> 00:56:17,727
- Ten!
- Fifteen?

953
00:56:17,827 --> 00:56:19,463
- Fifteen!
- Okay.

954
00:56:19,563 --> 00:56:20,774
Okay.

955
00:56:21,484 --> 00:56:23,050
You're gonna have to
stop it first.

956
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:25,233
No problem.

957
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:29,217
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

958
00:56:29,317 --> 00:56:30,547
Go!

959
00:56:41,823 --> 00:56:44,007
I had a rough day.
I'm keyed up.

960
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:45,275
I don't want your money.

961
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:46,654
- Take it.
- No.

962
00:56:46,754 --> 00:56:47,776
- Take it!
- I don't want it!

963
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:49,413
Look, you won the bet.
Don't piss me off.

964
00:56:49,513 --> 00:56:51,718
- Take the money!
- Okay, okay, okay.

965
00:56:51,818 --> 00:56:54,702
I tell you what, I tell you what...
I'll pay you fifteen bucks,

966
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:57,051
if you tell me another thing
you said to Melanie.

967
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:02,643
I told her to take Happy the Clam
and shove him up her butt.

968
00:57:03,814 --> 00:57:06,970
Oh, yeah!
You're d--oh, man!

969
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,844
I wish I could have seen that.

970
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:13,954
- My life sucks!
- Oh, life doesn't suck.

971
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:16,121
You just have to
have the right outlook.

972
00:57:16,221 --> 00:57:18,270
We're all here
to serve a purpose, okay?

973
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,635
To be as good and helpful
as we can, and, uh...

974
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:22,714
Later on we die,
and find out how we did.

975
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:23,897
In the tunnel?

976
00:57:23,997 --> 00:57:25,380
- What?
- You know, the tunnel?

977
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,060
Everyone that's been clinically dead
says they were in a tunnel,

978
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,799
with a bright light
in the end.

979
00:57:29,899 --> 00:57:32,053
Could you even imagine?
We die,

980
00:57:32,153 --> 00:57:34,265
and we go someplace
worse than this?

981
00:57:34,365 --> 00:57:37,285
A tunnel?
Dark tunnel, bright light...

982
00:57:37,385 --> 00:57:40,236
Tell me there isn't gonna be, like,
tons of moths all over the place.

983
00:57:40,618 --> 00:57:43,044
All right, the light
is probably God.

984
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:46,188
- Oh, here we go.
- You still don't believe in God?

985
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:49,804
No, I definitely believe in God.
He's the guy that needs all the money.

986
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:51,862
- Definitely believe in him.
- Okay, no...

987
00:57:51,962 --> 00:57:55,491
God is, uh... God is peace.
Thane, everybody needs God.

988
00:57:57,964 --> 00:57:59,164
Okay.

989
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:03,875
Then how do you explain
all the starving people in the world?

990
00:58:03,975 --> 00:58:08,469
Hmm? I mean what about
cruelty and murder?

991
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,670
What about rape?
What about war?

992
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,433
Okay, yeah, sure, absolutely.
There's a lot of pain in the world.

993
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:17,788
It i--it isn't God's will.
Man has a free will.

994
00:58:17,888 --> 00:58:20,674
W-we were given the ability
to be good and helpful,

995
00:58:20,774 --> 00:58:22,967
or the ability to steal
or kill or be cruel.

996
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:24,294
It's--it's our decision.

997
00:58:24,394 --> 00:58:27,538
And everytime we make a bad decision,
somebody else suffers.

998
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:29,936
Like, uh... uh... Somebody's
walking down the street

999
00:58:30,036 --> 00:58:31,683
and belts you in the head
with a hammer.

1000
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:33,861
You're gonna suffer
because of his decision.

1001
00:58:33,961 --> 00:58:36,548
We're all dependent on
one another for happiness.

1002
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:40,820
God doesn't cause that stuff, Thane.
It's the wrong decisions of man.

1003
00:58:41,196 --> 00:58:43,156
Then man sucks.

1004
00:58:43,555 --> 00:58:46,705
Does it always have to
come down to something sucking?

1005
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:51,842
I think it does.

1006
00:58:56,582 --> 00:58:59,158
- It's just a fly.
- Everything basically sucks.

1007
00:58:59,258 --> 00:59:02,034
I know it.
I can feel it inside of me.

1008
00:59:02,134 --> 00:59:04,470
I agree with you;
man is basically evil.

1009
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,690
- And that's why everything sucks.
- Wait a minute.

1010
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,019
- Man isn't basically evil.
- You said it yourself.

1011
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:10,125
You said it. Things are
screwed up because of man.

1012
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:12,841
No, no, no, no.
I didn't--no, man's bad decisions,

1013
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:14,969
that's not being evil.
Ok--look, we make mistakes.

1014
00:59:15,069 --> 00:59:17,822
Often times we regret these mistakes.
That's not being evil.

1015
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:21,019
People are evil and sadistic.
Every single one.

1016
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,640
- Wait a second!
- I can prove it, I can prove it!

1017
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,030
Have you ever picked up
a little puppy and held it?

1018
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:26,267
Yeah.

1019
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:27,938
Okay, well, you know
how cute they are?

1020
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:29,766
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1021
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,697
So you've been holding the puppy,
and it's so cute.

1022
00:59:31,797 --> 00:59:34,210
For that one little second in time,
you really love him,

1023
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:36,037
and you give him a squeeze,

1024
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:39,095
but he's so cute, you just
wanna squeeze him a little harder.

1025
00:59:39,955 --> 00:59:41,430
- Yeah?
- Well, there you go.

1026
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:44,548
There's a direct tie-in between
love and wanting to kill something.

1027
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,429
Oh, come on!
Wait a second!

1028
00:59:46,529 --> 00:59:47,777
No, it's true, it's true.
You squeeze it,

1029
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:49,609
and you just wanna
squeeze it a little harder,

1030
00:59:49,709 --> 00:59:51,744
you know, it's just like:
"Oh, you're so cute."

1031
00:59:51,844 --> 00:59:53,519
"I just wanna squeeze you."

1032
00:59:53,619 --> 00:59:57,291
"I just wanna squeeze you.
I just wanna squeeze you!"

1033
00:59:57,391 --> 00:59:59,839
"There!
That's how cute you are!"

1034
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:03,340
You gotta admit.
You've experienced that emotion.

1035
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,182
Look, look, no.
Come o--no.

1036
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:07,164
Even if that thought
of squeezing something hard

1037
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:09,161
enters people's minds,
they don't actually do it.

1038
01:00:09,261 --> 01:00:10,715
'Cause they know
they would hurt the thing.

1039
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,303
They--they, uh, stop squeezing,

1040
01:00:12,403 --> 01:00:14,963
because they don't want anything
bad or painful to happen.

1041
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:18,531
You're just showing affection, and
you get carried away with emotion.

1042
01:00:18,631 --> 01:00:21,574
I don't believe it!
There's no way!

1043
01:00:21,674 --> 01:00:25,114
It's like it defies
all logic and reason!

1044
01:00:25,214 --> 01:00:27,606
- What?
- The cereal!

1045
01:00:28,716 --> 01:00:30,518
It's a long story.

1046
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:38,971
Now what the hell
do you suppose that was?

1047
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:42,050
- I don't know.
- It's unbelievable.

1048
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,040
He's either constantly
blaring wretched music,

1049
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,776
or he's, like, training for
some shot put competition.

1050
01:00:48,876 --> 01:00:51,035
- It's unbearable!
- What's eating you, man?

1051
01:00:51,135 --> 01:00:52,431
It's sometihng else.

1052
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:57,345
Have...

1053
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,867
Have you been playing some kind
of joke on me lately?

1054
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:01,969
What are you--

1055
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:04,063
- You found out.
- It was you!

1056
01:01:04,163 --> 01:01:06,835
- How did you find out?
- Of course it was you!

1057
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:08,662
Who else would go
to all that trouble?

1058
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:11,075
Man! I gotta admit,
you had me going!

1059
01:01:11,175 --> 01:01:12,967
It wasn't that--that much trouble.

1060
01:01:13,067 --> 01:01:14,110
- Not that much trouble?
- Yeah.

1061
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,806
But you had to
make the first phone call.

1062
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,619
Slip that little piece
of paper in with my mail,

1063
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,901
after the mailman came,
but before I could get it.

1064
01:01:21,001 --> 01:01:23,034
Interrupting the phone call
from my mom.

1065
01:01:23,134 --> 01:01:24,695
I don't even know how you
set up that long thing

1066
01:01:24,795 --> 01:01:28,118
with the carpet cleaner survey.
How'd you make that voice?

1067
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:29,523
What are you talking about?

1068
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:33,391
- All that stuff. 8 o'clock.
- What happens at 8 o'clock?

1069
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:35,467
Hey, don't mess around.
You allready told me it was you.

1070
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,539
I-I, uh... I thought you were
talking about your car.

1071
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:39,084
- My car?
- Yeah.

1072
01:01:39,184 --> 01:01:41,570
I--you know, I've been writing
"wash me" in all the windows.

1073
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,460
- That was you?
- Yeah.

1074
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,000
You bastard!
Why would you--

1075
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,053
Wait, wait, wait, wha--what,
what's this, uh... what, uh...

1076
01:01:47,153 --> 01:01:50,242
Somebody's going to
clean your carpets at 8 o'clock?

1077
01:01:52,383 --> 01:01:55,659
- Are you playing around?
- No, I swear!

1078
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:03,851
Hey!
What's the deal, Al?

1079
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:05,247
Are you okay?

1080
01:02:08,565 --> 01:02:10,203
I think I'm going crazy.

1081
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,754
I keep seeing stuff, too.

1082
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:15,695
I tell you,
you gotta relax, man.

1083
01:02:15,795 --> 01:02:17,369
Get away.
Take a vacation.

1084
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:19,063
Please.
I hate vacations.

1085
01:02:19,163 --> 01:02:21,078
Even if you have a good time,
the second you get back,

1086
01:02:21,178 --> 01:02:22,338
everybody bugs you.

1087
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,265
"Oh, dude, did you
have a good time?

1088
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,187
"What'd you do?
Did you bring any pictures?"

1089
01:02:26,287 --> 01:02:27,634
It's a nightmare!

1090
01:02:27,734 --> 01:02:30,188
Couldn't be doing that bad.
You're still complaining about everything.

1091
01:02:30,976 --> 01:02:32,676
Um, look, I wanna hear
about this stuff.

1092
01:02:32,776 --> 01:02:34,102
I really do.
I gotta get back to work.

1093
01:02:34,202 --> 01:02:35,489
I'll come right back, though.

1094
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:36,974
I'll come right back.
We'll grab a bite.

1095
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:38,828
- You can fill me in, okay?
- No restaurants.

1096
01:02:38,928 --> 01:02:40,533
No, no.
No restaurants.

1097
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,960
- What time do you get off?
- I'll be done about 8:30.

1098
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,412
- That's too late.
- What do you mean?

1099
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,794
I don't know.
Go to work.

1100
01:02:50,894 --> 01:02:53,518
- You gotta go to work.
- Yeah, I gotta get back. Um...

1101
01:02:53,618 --> 01:02:54,773
All right...

1102
01:02:55,265 --> 01:02:57,825
I'll knock off early, okay?
I'll be here 8:15.

1103
01:02:57,925 --> 01:03:00,921
8:30 the latest, okay?
A-and you gotta promise me something.

1104
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:03,282
That you're not gonna sit
around here in the dark all day,

1105
01:03:03,382 --> 01:03:05,780
thinkin' about crummy stuff,
gettin' all depressed, okay?

1106
01:03:06,758 --> 01:03:09,230
- Promise.
- Promise.

1107
01:03:10,255 --> 01:03:12,726
Okay.
I'll see you later.

1108
01:03:23,493 --> 01:03:24,960
Vietnam.

1109
01:03:26,308 --> 01:03:28,575
Really don't like
to talk about it.

1110
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,415
It was Quang Tri Province.

1111
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:34,526
December 24th, 1968.

1112
01:03:36,861 --> 01:03:39,238
Dweeble was watching
the outer perimeter.

1113
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:43,239
Jackson and Pollock
bringing C-rations.

1114
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:47,702
Taylor was playing Canasta
through it all with Shovel Face.

1115
01:03:50,197 --> 01:03:53,048
Cong mortar shell fired
from half a mile out.

1116
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,418
Landed right
in the middle of camp.

1117
01:03:56,552 --> 01:03:59,377
Never exploded.
It was a dud.

1118
01:04:00,361 --> 01:04:03,329
But it took his head off.
Clean at the neck.

1119
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:07,562
Taylor was the first
to notice anything wrong.

1120
01:04:07,967 --> 01:04:10,868
He kept saying:
"Take a card, man."

1121
01:04:10,968 --> 01:04:12,371
"Take a card."

1122
01:04:12,471 --> 01:04:14,748
"If you don't discard,
you gotta take one."

1123
01:04:16,592 --> 01:04:19,049
He stared at Shovel Face
for a while.

1124
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:21,658
Then he statred yelling
for a medic.

1125
01:04:22,175 --> 01:04:23,418
Like that would help, right?

1126
01:04:23,518 --> 01:04:26,874
Like he'd be able to apply
a tourniquet to his neck or something.

1127
01:04:28,383 --> 01:04:30,830
But it was all
too late anyway.

1128
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,551
The V.C. were 
coming over the wire.

1129
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:35,076
Thousands of them.

1130
01:04:36,847 --> 01:04:38,933
Dweeble hid all the claymores.

1131
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,777
But they just kept coming.

1132
01:04:42,536 --> 01:04:44,361
Nobody survived.

1133
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:47,879
Man...

1134
01:04:48,065 --> 01:04:50,581
I'm glad I was in grade school.

1135
01:04:54,007 --> 01:04:56,139
I don't think
I could have dealt with it.

1136
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:04,080
Well.

1137
01:05:04,664 --> 01:05:06,161
I guess I'll, uh...

1138
01:05:06,565 --> 01:05:08,306
...watch some TV.

1139
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:17,278
<i>Remember...</i>

1140
01:05:17,378 --> 01:05:20,640
<i>At Shady Lane Mortuaries,
we care.</i>

1141
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,491
Well, I don't.

1142
01:05:22,591 --> 01:05:26,280
<i>I can't function anymore.
I'm tired of living a lie.</i>

1143
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,386
I love watching soap operas.
I mean, how much worse can acting be?

1144
01:05:30,486 --> 01:05:32,421
I lik--I like it when, right before
they go to commercial,

1145
01:05:32,521 --> 01:05:33,820
they'll make the big face.

1146
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,964
You know, the big face?
Eh?

1147
01:05:36,064 --> 01:05:38,436
You know, they'll have something,
like, Mark will walk in the door,

1148
01:05:38,536 --> 01:05:39,816
and this woman will go...

1149
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:41,546
"Mark?!"

1150
01:05:42,028 --> 01:05:44,543
You know, the big face,
then they place the big music.

1151
01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:45,743
Then you come back
from the commercial,

1152
01:05:45,843 --> 01:05:48,084
and they have him walk in
the door again, and she goes:

1153
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,834
"Mark.
How have you been?"

1154
01:05:51,934 --> 01:05:55,466
What happened to the big face?
It's like it never happened!

1155
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:59,442
<i>You've made it
through the entire puzzle.</i>

1156
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:02,757
<i>Now, for $10,000...</i>

1157
01:06:03,118 --> 01:06:06,061
<i>What famous boxer
coined the phrase,</i>

1158
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:09,426
<i>- "I am the greatest"?</i>
- Oh, how lucky!

1159
01:06:09,526 --> 01:06:12,450
<i>Oh... I'm not
a very big sports fan.</i>

1160
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:15,093
You don't have to be
a big sports fan, lady.

1161
01:06:15,193 --> 01:06:19,139
There's only one possible answer.
<i>- This isn't really my expertise.</i>

1162
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:21,121
Doesn't have
to be your expertise,

1163
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:24,013
just say the name of
the only boxer you know!

1164
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:28,869
<i>- Five seconds, Veronica.</i>
- Oh, come on, Lady! You gotta get it!

1165
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:34,423
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- Oh! I don't believe it! $10,000!

1166
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,135
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1167
01:06:36,235 --> 01:06:39,316
<i>The only boxer I even know
is Muhammad Ali.</i>

1168
01:06:42,243 --> 01:06:45,877
Geez, I can't watch this!
How stupid can you be?

1169
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:49,658
The stupidest person
I ever saw in a game show...

1170
01:06:49,758 --> 01:06:53,707
The <i>second</i> stupidest person...
was on <i>Password</i>.

1171
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:55,519
The password was "exotic"
or something.

1172
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:59,468
The celebrity guy goes:
"Fancy...?"

1173
01:06:59,568 --> 01:07:01,885
And this woman actually said:

1174
01:07:04,108 --> 01:07:05,473
"Schmancy."

1175
01:07:05,573 --> 01:07:11,420
Like--like, in her wildest dreams,
the password is "schmancy."

1176
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,662
"S-C-H-M..."

1177
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:17,092
But what about these
exploitation talk shows?

1178
01:07:17,192 --> 01:07:19,578
I-I m--I mean, I think
there should just be one of them.

1179
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:21,770
Call it <i>Oprah DeNaldo.</i>

1180
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:25,112
The host is a fat woman
with white hair and a mustache.

1181
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:27,303
I mean, if you're ever
feeling crummy about yourself,

1182
01:07:27,403 --> 01:07:30,551
flip on one of these freak shows
for about a half hour.

1183
01:07:30,651 --> 01:07:32,100
I saw this woman
on there, once...

1184
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,341
She dressed her kid up
like a pig.

1185
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:36,869
Right, so evidently
the kid stole something,

1186
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,422
so to punish him,
she dressed him up like a pig,

1187
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:43,813
tied him up in front of their house
to humiliate him,

1188
01:07:43,913 --> 01:07:46,182
and she got arrested
for child abuse or something,

1189
01:07:46,282 --> 01:07:49,595
which is right, because nobody
should do something like that,

1190
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:52,604
and I certainly
would never condone it.

1191
01:07:53,038 --> 01:07:54,576
But you gotta admit...

1192
01:07:54,676 --> 01:07:59,377
That is a pretty effective
disciplinary tactic, isn't it?

1193
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:01,970
I mean, you wouldn't have
to be told twice

1194
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:05,361
once Mom brought out
pulled out the pig suit, huh?

1195
01:08:06,118 --> 01:08:08,498
"Billy, that room's
a little messy..."

1196
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,739
Your brother's standing there
in an elephant suit:

1197
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,762
"Hey, I'd listen to her
if I were you, man."

1198
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:17,966
This... this bitch is out of her mind.
She's crazy."

1199
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:20,570
The entire house is like a zoo...

1200
01:08:26,942 --> 01:08:31,650
From now on, I am going
to spend every waking moment

1201
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:38,187
completely and intently dedicated
to finding this guy a job!

1202
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:42,059
Please turn the music down.

1203
01:08:44,894 --> 01:08:47,055
Please turn
the music down a little!

1204
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,826
Turn down the music!

1205
01:08:54,694 --> 01:08:56,230
I gotta relax.

1206
01:09:00,547 --> 01:09:02,735
I gotta remember
not to close my eyes.

1207
01:09:04,128 --> 01:09:05,812
I'm going insane.

1208
01:09:05,912 --> 01:09:07,139
No!

1209
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:09,900
This is a typical, normal day.

1210
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:12,047
Just like any other.

1211
01:09:12,768 --> 01:09:16,045
Typical... normal...

1212
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,788
Would you turn that music down!

1213
01:09:32,998 --> 01:09:35,722
Thank! You! Very! Much!

1214
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,415
Isn't it a pity,
that it has to come to that?

1215
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:45,039
I mean, I'm as open-minded
as the next guy.

1216
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:49,087
But if I have to go through
my entire life being taken advantage of,

1217
01:09:49,187 --> 01:09:51,413
well, I'd rather be dead.

1218
01:10:38,787 --> 01:10:44,624
Oh! You must be the tumor-like
substance that lives upstairs!

1219
01:10:44,993 --> 01:10:46,812
I don't mind you
pounding on my floor, man,

1220
01:10:46,912 --> 01:10:48,515
but could you do it
with a little rhythm?

1221
01:10:48,615 --> 01:10:50,521
'Cause you are really
messin' with my head.

1222
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:51,812
Oh, I completely understand.

1223
01:10:51,912 --> 01:10:56,089
We wouldn't want to clutter up
that magnificent reservoir of thought.

1224
01:10:57,638 --> 01:11:00,137
Yeah.
Let's check out the place.

1225
01:11:03,389 --> 01:11:06,155
Oh, yeah, this is capable.

1226
01:11:07,018 --> 01:11:08,803
This is very capable.

1227
01:11:10,207 --> 01:11:11,670
Organized.

1228
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:15,540
By the way, I'm Vol.

1229
01:11:16,059 --> 01:11:18,511
Vol?
How very appropriate.

1230
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:20,668
Is your last name Ume?

1231
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,869
No. Look, man,
we're neighbors, you know,

1232
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:25,356
and I don't wanna
have a beef with you.

1233
01:11:25,456 --> 01:11:27,674
I thought maybe we could
just kinda chill, you know.

1234
01:11:27,774 --> 01:11:29,829
We could grab a beer
and forget about everything.

1235
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:32,870
The only way beer
could possibly help me

1236
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:36,656
is if I poured it in my ears
until I was completely deaf.

1237
01:11:36,756 --> 01:11:38,816
Because that's the only way
that living under you

1238
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:42,876
would be anything other than
a frighteningly accurately preview

1239
01:11:42,976 --> 01:11:45,756
of the un-ending horrors of Hell!

1240
01:11:45,856 --> 01:11:48,479
Whoa!
Somebody get this dude a Valium.

1241
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:51,822
Look, man, I'm sorry if I play my tunes
a little too loud for you sometimes.

1242
01:11:51,922 --> 01:11:56,467
Sometimes? Your apartment
is a constant source

1243
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:58,389
of music and effects!

1244
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:03,799
I mean, it's like some film company
hired you to score my entire existence!

1245
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:05,299
That'd be cool!

1246
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:07,117
Okay...

1247
01:12:07,805 --> 01:12:10,163
Let's settle this once and for all.

1248
01:12:10,644 --> 01:12:16,584
If you win, I can never
bring up your "tunes" again.

1249
01:12:16,684 --> 01:12:20,919
But if I win, you can
never play any

1250
01:12:21,019 --> 01:12:26,692
of that odd-pitched,
melodic agony again.

1251
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:29,243
What?

1252
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:33,182
No music for the rest
of your life.

1253
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:37,919
Complete and total silence.

1254
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,566
What if I move?

1255
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:47,183
You know, I would love
to save others from the eminent hell

1256
01:12:47,283 --> 01:12:48,979
that would accompany you
as their neighbor.

1257
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:50,201
But I must admit,

1258
01:12:50,301 --> 01:12:53,065
I'm only concerned with myself
in this matter.

1259
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:57,295
If you move, it's off.

1260
01:12:58,514 --> 01:12:59,784
Deal!

1261
01:13:01,052 --> 01:13:03,517
Wait.
What's the game?

1262
01:13:04,282 --> 01:13:05,499
Arm wrestling.

1263
01:13:06,738 --> 01:13:08,620
That's a bit physical, bud.

1264
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,217
Oh, so you're gonna chicken out?
No, no, I understand.

1265
01:13:12,317 --> 01:13:16,039
The idea of using your manhood
to back up your argument

1266
01:13:16,139 --> 01:13:18,965
is something you just
can't deal with.

1267
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:31,333
It is going to be
so peaceful around here.

1268
01:13:32,623 --> 01:13:37,457
I can hardly imagine it, really.
Endless days of peace and quiet.

1269
01:13:38,318 --> 01:13:40,376
Oh, I'm sure things
might work out well for you.

1270
01:13:40,476 --> 01:13:41,737
You might get a new hobby.

1271
01:13:41,837 --> 01:13:44,525
Stamp collection...
Hey, who knows?

1272
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:47,747
One day, you might even
read a book.

1273
01:13:49,146 --> 01:13:51,449
Oh? Oh!

1274
01:13:51,549 --> 01:13:53,674
Oh! Hey.

1275
01:13:58,004 --> 01:14:01,714
Oh! Uh-oh!
Oh, oh, oh! Oh!

1276
01:14:05,597 --> 01:14:07,705
- By the way...
- What?

1277
01:14:07,805 --> 01:14:10,020
- When do you wanna start?
- Huh?

1278
01:14:11,059 --> 01:14:12,308
Geez!

1279
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:14,907
You like thrash music?

1280
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:18,560
It's really cool, but you gotta
crank it to hear the clarity.

1281
01:14:19,628 --> 01:14:22,333
- Oh no!
- See ya!

1282
01:14:22,433 --> 01:14:24,796
I don't believe it!

1283
01:14:24,896 --> 01:14:26,787
This sucks!

1284
01:14:37,575 --> 01:14:39,320
I'm not gonna let it bug me.

1285
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:41,823
It was a fair bet.

1286
01:14:43,424 --> 01:14:46,638
It just so happens that I lost.

1287
01:14:48,543 --> 01:14:53,419
He won the bet,
and I will abide by it.

1288
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,092
Oh, come on.

1289
01:15:18,192 --> 01:15:19,994
You would have done it, too.

1290
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:23,458
I just want a little quiet.

1291
01:15:24,324 --> 01:15:27,249
A little peace and quiet.

1292
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:32,958
Don't close your eyes!
Don't close your eyes!

1293
01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:34,748
Don't close your eyes!

1294
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,012
Okay. So...

1295
01:15:51,395 --> 01:15:55,602
- Hello?
<i>- If you build it, he will come.</i>

1296
01:15:55,702 --> 01:15:58,134
- What?
- I'm kidding. This is Al.

1297
01:15:58,234 --> 01:16:01,513
<i>- I'm coming right over.</i>
- Al, you should never play around like that!

1298
01:16:01,613 --> 01:16:04,076
Oh, whoa! Mr. Touchy.

1299
01:16:04,402 --> 01:16:05,990
Hey, hurry up, okay?

1300
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:08,824
All right, just relax.
I'll--I'll be right over.

1301
01:16:09,452 --> 01:16:11,247
<i>And so will I!</i>

1302
01:16:17,112 --> 01:16:19,747
There's a guy in the phone!
That's good!

1303
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:21,517
That's good,
a guy in the phone.

1304
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,134
Tha--that's fine.
That sounds fair.

1305
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,004
My life could have
been different, you know?

1306
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,708
I could have been
one of those...

1307
01:16:44,136 --> 01:16:46,116
...totally uninformed...

1308
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,019
...mindless...

1309
01:16:48,888 --> 01:16:51,149
...content individuals...

1310
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,232
...with a beautiful wife.

1311
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:58,480
A nice house.

1312
01:16:59,768 --> 01:17:01,376
A great car.

1313
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:04,264
Perfect job.

1314
01:17:07,138 --> 01:17:11,482
- It's great to be alive.
- I'm gong to school, Daddy.

1315
01:17:11,582 --> 01:17:15,183
- I love you.
- And I love you.

1316
01:17:15,283 --> 01:17:18,634
Now run along.
Hey, hey, don't forget your lunch.

1317
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:23,697
And don't forget
to kiss your mother.

1318
01:17:24,595 --> 01:17:26,521
That's not a bad idea.

1319
01:17:31,705 --> 01:17:36,924
- I love you, honey.
- Oh, I love you too, sweetheart.

1320
01:17:37,882 --> 01:17:41,598
- Isn't life grand?
- Yes, dear. You know?

1321
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,470
Life is grand.

1322
01:17:43,634 --> 01:17:45,905
And you wanna know
what makes it grand?

1323
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:47,730
You.

1324
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:53,078
That is the sweetest thing
I have ever heard.

1325
01:17:53,178 --> 01:17:57,701
I am the luckiest woman
in the whole, wide world.

1326
01:17:57,801 --> 01:18:01,676
And I am the luckiest man.

1327
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:06,704
Sweetness?
By the way...

1328
01:18:06,804 --> 01:18:08,404
What, pumpkin?

1329
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:11,612
It's 8 o'clock.

1330
01:18:25,686 --> 01:18:26,849
Wh--

1331
01:18:28,285 --> 01:18:29,500
Who is it?

1332
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,224
Al?

1333
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:45,670
Is that you?

1334
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:13,311
What do you want?

1335
01:19:13,774 --> 01:19:16,244
I believe you're supposed
to come with me.

1336
01:19:16,597 --> 01:19:19,573
- What?
- It's 8 o'clock.

1337
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:22,008
It's you?

1338
01:19:22,373 --> 01:19:24,642
You're 8 o'clock?

1339
01:19:24,742 --> 01:19:27,138
Whoa, scary!

1340
01:19:27,238 --> 01:19:29,392
Well, I got a little
message for you, pal.

1341
01:19:29,492 --> 01:19:31,826
I'm not going anywhere!

1342
01:19:31,926 --> 01:19:34,927
It's 8 o'clock, sir.
The limo is waiting.

1343
01:19:36,461 --> 01:19:39,376
- Limo?
- The limo.

1344
01:19:42,877 --> 01:19:46,282
- What is this?
- I just drive the car, sir.

1345
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:48,136
You'll have to come with me.

1346
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:09,964
This is really nice.

1347
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:13,123
Hey, did I win something?

1348
01:20:21,502 --> 01:20:22,893
He's not real.

1349
01:20:22,993 --> 01:20:25,281
He's not real.
It's just the limo driver.

1350
01:20:25,846 --> 01:20:29,281
Oh, I'm real, man.
I'm as real as it gets.

1351
01:20:34,213 --> 01:20:35,809
Hey, what is this?

1352
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,049
Let me outta here!

1353
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,523
Who are you?

1354
01:20:49,576 --> 01:20:51,259
I'm Death, man.

1355
01:20:54,054 --> 01:20:55,122
Death?

1356
01:20:56,366 --> 01:20:59,899
Like... <i>the</i> Death?

1357
01:21:00,374 --> 01:21:04,739
Well, I'd say "in the flesh,"
but that wouldn't be 100% accurate.

1358
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:08,058
Th--this is crazy.

1359
01:21:16,656 --> 01:21:17,751
See?

1360
01:21:18,127 --> 01:21:20,475
It was a fly!
Just a fly.

1361
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,112
You couldn't kill him.

1362
01:21:23,543 --> 01:21:26,859
- This can't be.
- You know it's real, just accept it.

1363
01:21:26,959 --> 01:21:28,674
This isn't real!

1364
01:21:39,872 --> 01:21:41,325
Did that scare you?

1365
01:21:42,616 --> 01:21:43,682
Yeah.

1366
01:21:44,591 --> 01:21:46,058
That's because I'm Death.

1367
01:21:46,585 --> 01:21:49,022
It's very scary when I do
something like that.

1368
01:21:50,016 --> 01:21:53,052
- You're weird!
- I'm Death.

1369
01:21:53,883 --> 01:21:55,882
- Well, I'm not dead!
- You are dead.

1370
01:21:55,982 --> 01:21:57,579
- I'm <i>not</i> dead!
- You <i>are</i> dead.

1371
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,809
I'm <i>not</i> d--
Okay, okay, I'm dead, I'm dead!

1372
01:22:03,129 --> 01:22:05,027
You gotta be shown.

1373
01:22:05,897 --> 01:22:08,202
They all have to be shown.

1374
01:22:08,795 --> 01:22:10,330
Close your eyes.

1375
01:22:10,721 --> 01:22:12,042
Close 'em!

1376
01:22:18,257 --> 01:22:19,639
<i>It's Al.</i>

1377
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:22,167
<i>My apartment!</i>

1378
01:22:26,294 --> 01:22:27,471
<i>Thane.</i>

1379
01:22:28,184 --> 01:22:31,135
<i>Thane?
Hey, Thane!</i>

1380
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:32,461
<i>Thane!</i>

1381
01:22:33,773 --> 01:22:34,896
<i>Thane!</i>

1382
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,426
Pretty radical, huh?

1383
01:22:41,277 --> 01:22:44,582
- I'm too young to die.
- Cliché.

1384
01:22:44,682 --> 01:22:47,705
Actually, this is a little bit
before your scheduled time,

1385
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:51,117
but you kept saying:
"I wish I were dead."

1386
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,971
- That's a figure of speech!
- Maybe so.

1387
01:22:54,071 --> 01:22:56,069
But you're only allowed
to say it 18,000 times.

1388
01:22:56,169 --> 01:22:58,842
- Then they call me in.
- 18,000 times?

1389
01:22:58,942 --> 01:23:01,829
- That's stupid!
- Also, you weren't useful.

1390
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,784
- What?
- You weren't any use to anyone.

1391
01:23:04,884 --> 01:23:08,509
All you did was sit around and complain.
You never actually helped anyone.

1392
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:10,111
What if I had?

1393
01:23:10,211 --> 01:23:14,532
<i>♪ It's too late now, baby  ♪</i>

1394
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:17,848
<i>♪ It's too late  ♪</i>

1395
01:23:17,948 --> 01:23:21,370
- You love this!
- I love people.

1396
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,549
Well, you make
a crummy Death!

1397
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:25,708
Shouldn't you be
wearing a hood or something?

1398
01:23:25,808 --> 01:23:27,868
That was a little fashion thing
I went through.

1399
01:23:27,968 --> 01:23:29,621
I was depressed.

1400
01:23:29,721 --> 01:23:31,160
Watch this, though.

1401
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,489
- What the hel is that?
- Being dead is great!

1402
01:23:39,589 --> 01:23:41,434
Go ahead. Try it!

1403
01:23:41,534 --> 01:23:43,940
- No!
- Eh?

1404
01:23:44,281 --> 01:23:47,470
I hate being dead!
This sucks!

1405
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:50,937
I hate it more than life!
I hate the way you are!

1406
01:23:51,037 --> 01:23:52,633
I hate you!

1407
01:23:52,733 --> 01:23:54,726
It's stupid how we're
in this limo!

1408
01:23:54,826 --> 01:23:57,411
It's stupid, that thing
you're doing with your ear!

1409
01:23:57,511 --> 01:24:00,962
That rule about
18,000 times is lame!

1410
01:24:01,062 --> 01:24:02,698
I don't like it here at all!

1411
01:24:02,798 --> 01:24:05,548
There's no tunnel!
The least you could have done

1412
01:24:05,648 --> 01:24:07,493
was giving me a tunnel
with a bright light!

1413
01:24:07,593 --> 01:24:11,144
Nobody has ever come back
and said: "Oh, it was so peaceful;

1414
01:24:11,244 --> 01:24:13,566
I was in this big
stretch limo."

1415
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:15,563
Oh, th--this is great!

1416
01:24:15,914 --> 01:24:18,193
I'm not even floating!
You know?

1417
01:24:18,293 --> 01:24:20,511
You'd at least think
I'd be floating or something.

1418
01:24:20,611 --> 01:24:22,848
No, no, no!
I'm in the back of a car,

1419
01:24:22,948 --> 01:24:25,390
with a guy that can
relocate his ear!

1420
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:29,715
Oh, this must be Heaven!
Somebody pinch me!

1421
01:24:31,418 --> 01:24:34,505
And look at you.

1422
01:24:34,605 --> 01:24:39,063
Yeah, you with your face
popping up all over the place.

1423
01:24:39,163 --> 01:24:42,461
Yeah, maybe all I did was complain.
Maybe I didn't help anyone.

1424
01:24:42,561 --> 01:24:44,181
But at least I wasn't
just showing up,

1425
01:24:44,281 --> 01:24:47,011
trying to scare people
24 hours a day!

1426
01:24:47,111 --> 01:24:49,645
Oh, there's a lot of things
that need to be changed around here!

1427
01:24:49,745 --> 01:24:51,329
And as soon
as I see a little bit more,

1428
01:24:51,429 --> 01:24:54,689
I'm gonna give you a full,
detailed rundown

1429
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:58,528
of the way things should be!
And you're gonna hear it, man!

1430
01:24:58,628 --> 01:25:00,973
You're gonna hear it all!

1431
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,616
Not this time, pal!

1432
01:25:03,716 --> 01:25:06,555
First, when people think
about death and dying,

1433
01:25:06,655 --> 01:25:10,475
they're building up expectations.

1434
01:25:10,575 --> 01:25:15,324
And it is your responsibility
to make sure they're not let down.

1435
01:25:15,424 --> 01:25:17,932
And whoa!
Believe me!

1436
01:25:18,032 --> 01:25:22,500
This is one, gigantic let-down!

1437
01:25:22,839 --> 01:25:24,596
For instance, when you die,

1438
01:25:24,696 --> 01:25:28,171
did you ever think maybe you'd like
to see someone that you like?

1439
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:30,490
You know,
like a relative or something?

1440
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:33,870
Not some rubber-faced
limbo champion!

1441
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:37,854
Oh yeah, I'm dead now.
Please bring in Mr. Play-Doh Face.

1442
01:25:37,954 --> 01:25:41,859
That would be nice!
I'd like to be annoyed for eternity!

1443
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:45,599
Bring me the loser!
Yeah, I love being around him!

1444
01:25:45,699 --> 01:25:47,515
It's great!

1445
01:25:48,325 --> 01:25:49,380
Thane?

1446
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,775
Hey, Thane!
Thane?

1447
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:56,074
Hey... God, Tha--
Thane!

1448
01:25:57,183 --> 01:25:58,442
I can't believe this.

1449
01:25:59,052 --> 01:26:01,060
I gotta call the police.
Hey!

1450
01:26:03,683 --> 01:26:05,139
You're alive?

1451
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:09,554
- Yeah?
- You were dead!

1452
01:26:11,157 --> 01:26:12,263
Was I?

1453
01:26:12,363 --> 01:26:14,162
You were laying right there.
You had no pulse.

1454
01:26:15,974 --> 01:26:17,115
Really?

1455
01:26:17,894 --> 01:26:19,339
What happened?

1456
01:26:19,718 --> 01:26:21,628
Do you remember anything?

1457
01:26:23,062 --> 01:26:24,491
This limo.

1458
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:28,803
And there was this guy
that took his ear off.

1459
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:34,971
I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.

1460
01:26:35,285 --> 01:26:37,374
Wait, wait, wait.
Y-you feel up to that?

1461
01:26:37,474 --> 01:26:39,397
I mean... are you okay?

1462
01:26:40,301 --> 01:26:42,283
I feel great!

1463
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:46,593
- Come on, let's go.
- You mean go out?

1464
01:26:46,693 --> 01:26:49,050
And get something to eat
at a restaurant?

1465
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:51,101
Yeah, what's the problem?

1466
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:55,150
Hey, Thane, let me get this straight.
You wanna go to a restaurant?

1467
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,664
Yeah, but I'm telling you, man,
they better have cereal.

1468
01:26:57,764 --> 01:27:01,383
And none of this: "Oh, we only
serve it in the morning."

1469
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,442
I'm sorry.

1470
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:16,675
This time I'm gonna
have to put my foot down.

1471
01:29:16,775 --> 01:29:18,001
I'm not taking him.

1472
01:29:18,101 --> 01:29:20,589
There's no way I can
be around that guy.

1473
01:29:21,325 --> 01:29:23,701
And I'm not coming back
for him, either.
