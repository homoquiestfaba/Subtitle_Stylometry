1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
EMPTY (2011)

2
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,455
Do you know how to drive?
- Yes, we have plenty of time.

3
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:08,923
Not enough fuel.

4
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,968
How far can we last?
- Not the whole trip.

5
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:29,103
Oh my God, oh, no, no.
- It's okay, no worries.

6
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:31,904
No alsjblieft, so we lost. What
if the wrong direction?

7
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,105
They do not live without us away, Piper.
I do not know if this is the good way.

8
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:35,683
We're going to run, no time to lose.

9
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,400
Shit, is that a car?

10
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,910
EMPTY

11
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:10,576
ONE WEEK EARLIER

12
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:17,217
Forward.
- As an exercise commander.

13
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,194
An exercise
-Commander? It seemed not even on.

14
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:24,388
My father was a fucking soldier.
- Really?

15
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:30,330
These drillers will give you really down,
if you had something out.

16
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,269
Oh yeah, I forgot your military background.

17
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:44,412
Yeah, interesting.
- If we wanted to see it for you.

18
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:47,611
We would be living here year round, so fish.

19
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:51,816
So in the wild, make a campfire.
- I see the fun in that.

20
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:56,155
I feel like a real guy here, you know?

21
00:02:56,155 --> 00:03:00,970
Not bound in an office,
gazing at my computer.

22
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,470
Scour the Web as a bloody zombie.

23
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:06,399
Same office, which ensures that we
can pay the rent?

24
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:10,205
This here is as it should be
before one makes a mess.

25
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:15,907
Honey, I love to town ... No, I love it.

26
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,952
Perhaps you are even a few days to hang out.

27
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:23,956
Oh yeah, nice balls into the woods here
for five days is definitely not enough?

28
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,841
Thanks for this beautiful view, very sexy.

29
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,562
Hey.

30
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:33,889
It's better here than stay there, where everyone
fights for a piece of junk.

31
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:40,402
You know, I do not care if
they all make to the ground.

32
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,439
Okay.

33
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:49,841
What the hell was that about?
- Very strange.

34
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,813
A hippie.
- Not all in a row.

35
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,152
Fighting for a piece of junk?

36
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:59,870
Yes, and they all get the fuck.
- Probably stoned.

37
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:27,520
Not too close.

38
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:33,956
Chicken.

39
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,965
Tastes good.

40
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:45,300
Look at you, it's a campfire.

41
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:50,211
What do you think?
- Think?

42
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,449
You're beautiful.

43
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:05,725
Thank you.

44
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:12,970
How would you feel if I were
to ask you to marry?

45
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:19,198
Um, you ask me that?

46
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:25,740
I mean, I have no ring or
anything, I'm just saying ...

47
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:27,839
I see us the rest of our lives together.

48
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:41,880
What do you think about going to marry me?

49
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:57,333
Surely you can at least
show a little interest?

50
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,243
I do not say I did not do?
- With that expression on your face?

51
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:04,183
What should I do? I was only just thinking.

52
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:09,860
What do you think, how
would your father react?
- No, not at all.

53
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,352
Or how our parents met for
the first time would meet?

54
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:15,827
And how terrible it all will not.

55
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:19,706
Stop it.

56
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:27,737
I'm sorry that I have started. It
was stupid, I was somewhat excited.

57
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,707
Whatever.

58
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:21,860
Are you awake?

59
00:07:28,537 --> 00:07:32,405
Are you awake?
- Yes, what is it?

60
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:39,977
I'm sorry.
- Do not worry about it.

61
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:48,120
Are you sure?
- Yes, definitely.

62
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:23,246
MAXIMUM SPEED 40 KM / H

63
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,325
Won!

64
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:45,663
Can you get something for me: some
with cherries and pineapple vruchtencakeje?

65
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:48,738
Yes.
- Thank you.

66
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,865
5 NEW CALLING YOU MISSED. YOU HAVE
5 NEW VOICE MAIL MESSAGES.

67
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,170
What is it?

68
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:10,347
No gasoline here. I think
they're not even open.

69
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,251
Have you tried the door?

70
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:29,910
NO FUEL DUE TO FUEL CRISIS

71
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:47,984
Something strange going on here.

72
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,518
Yes, I have voice mails from my father.

73
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:52,918
Everyone wonders if all is well with me.

74
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:56,569
Tell me that this is a joke.
- What? What is it?

75
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,636
That sign on the door says
closed due to gas crisis.

76
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,744
What?
- Look there!

77
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,387
FUEL CRISIS AFFECTING ALL AMERICA

78
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,234
Have you seen cars on the way here?

79
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,379
No, no, not me.

80
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm going to call my brother,
I know it either.

81
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:51,681
I'll call you back, then I know what to do.

82
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:53,598
Are you serious?

83
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,162
I love you, man, you see.

84
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,627
Yes Mom, listen, I gotta go ..

85
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:04,363
I have to find out.

86
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:09,618
Okay, I'll call you. I gotta
go I love you, Doeg.

87
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:13,903
My mom says that in California,

88
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:17,388
no gas. Nothing, though one week.

89
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:21,180
Stores have already closed because
nobody could work.

90
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:25,317
My brother says that Boston is a madhouse.

91
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,256
Are you okay with him?
- Yes, he sounded good, but ...

92
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:31,326
It's pathetic, because I think he
has more fun too.

93
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:39,971
I see no way.
- How far is Cambridge?

94
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:45,371
About 600 km.
- So far it is not.

95
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:45,814
That's it.

96
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:47,914
How far do you think we
can go with this tank?

97
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,160
Turn off the ignition.

98
00:13:59,294 --> 00:14:01,626
It's official. We can in no way home.

99
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:15,939
<i>There is still everything is possible.
The President has assured us</i>

100
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:20,274
<i>that gasoline is ahead next week.</i>

101
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:24,848
<i>The army will operate military food
drops and care where needed.</i>

102
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:32,149
<i>Meanwhile, New York on fire in
Chicago doin 'too bad ...</i>

103
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,854
<i>That does not yet ...</i>

104
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:38,934
<i>We need to really figure out
how it managed to come.</i>

105
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:45,304
<i>... It will take some time before petrol
again will be available to the public.</i>

106
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:50,550
<i>It took a while before I could get</i>

107
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:59,782
<i>People just do not get
the news they need.</i>

108
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:05,664
<i>But it's why I highly appreciate
that you came here</i>

109
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:08,417
<i>to try to transfer the
news to the people.</i>

110
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,430
<i>No trouble hearing.
- I think this ...</i>

111
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,123
<i>I just need a little
convincing ends have</i>

112
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:19,870
<i>they inform me that we
can save gas ...</i>

113
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:37,185
Listen, I need to stop. I
have to change clothes.

114
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:37,747
Here, now?

115
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:40,352
I wear these clothes for five
days. I feel dirty.

116
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,489
I need to purify thoughts.

117
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:54,132
Hey, why do not we go to
my father. The summer cottage.

118
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,700
Connecticut?
- Yes, it is not far from here.

119
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,929
I'm sure we catch up with the fuel we have.

120
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,439
There must be a better place where we can go.

121
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:04,874
Where?
- No idea, Kishidi motel?

122
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:13,342
We'll go near me. Wait a few days.

123
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:15,455
You know, see what happens, we know nothing.

124
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:18,113
Why not go to that house? He's
not himself, he's in England.

125
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:20,955
Listen, I do not want help from your
father, I get there damn it acidic.

126
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:24,394
Do not be ridiculous. Piper,
we can find some.

127
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:27,293
40, $ 50 per night, stay
there one week. No problem.

128
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,525
That could be longer. This
can not continue, Piper.

129
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:32,332
Probably some political game. Hold the oil
tap as close to us.

130
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,906
We keep it as full and then back to normal.

131
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:37,602
What are you talking about?
Who is stopping us?

132
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:40,737
The Middle East.
- Who? Which country?

133
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:44,870
That sucks Pakistan or Afghanistan,
or any pokke
-standard whatsoever.

134
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:49,598
You do not know what you're talking about. Okay,
you watch any news unless it's sports news.

135
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:53,870
You read the paper disagree.
- I just heard on CNN ...

136
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:05,996
Please. Find a motel
- Fine, whatever.

137
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:41,469
Why something like this, as we
just go to the cottage?

138
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:45,203
So retarded.
- Come on baby, let's just watch.

139
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:49,944
Go on, now.

140
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:04,251
Jesus.

141
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,393
Hello, you had a few minutes ago called?

142
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:37,326
Yes, that was me, hello.
- How did you here?

143
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,728
Driven.
- Really?

144
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,922
Yes, we camped last week and
now back to civilization.

145
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:44,776
Or what's left of it.
- I don 't.

146
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:50,226
Just a warning. Fuel Shortage, thus
no cleaning crew, etc.

147
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:54,354
We get discount or something?

148
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:57,709
'm Afraid not, I must now
work longer than usual.

149
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:00,410
Of course, we meant nothing.

150
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:04,364
Whatever.

151
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:08,739
Can I have your credit card,
driver's license see, please?

152
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:20,495
Where is the nearest supermarket?

153
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:20,936
Excuse me?

154
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:23,507
We want some food, we are starving.

155
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:25,308
You said you have been camping
for a few days?

156
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:26,830
6 days.

157
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:30,209
So you do not know what's going on?

158
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:34,751
Oh yes. Fuel Crisis and many
other deficiencies, we know.

159
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:39,620
Tell us where the nearest supermarket and
book us in and ...

160
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,184
Most shops are closed ...
and many robberies now.

161
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:45,250
It is very dangerous here.

162
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,865
So there is no more food to get?

163
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:53,745
I have enough food stored

164
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:55,518
and other stuff prior to the
hell breaks out here ...

165
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,176
-Excuse my language, ... one week ago.

166
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,479
I knew a lot of people, some
homeless people and guests can use.

167
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,297
Okay, so ...

168
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:05,279
I can deliver what you need.

169
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:09,961
No risk of going into stores, they
can see you as criminals.

170
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:13,715
Are we criminals?
- Good idea, do not you think?

171
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:15,692
Or waste gas to get anywhere.

172
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,763
It is so extraordinary.
- That's it.

173
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:20,760
I offer it because I

174
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:25,469
who are trying to get away.
- God, that's terrible.

175
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:29,370
Sorry, only even try to penetrate
what we stand for.

176
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,536
There are even reports of rape had been.

177
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:45,493
A taser. If someone tries something fun
I leave them a scare.

178
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:49,611
Give me enough time to tie
them, until the police arrive.

179
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,848
Okay, thank you made us a guide how to ...

180
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:54,500
Rape?

181
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:56,703
Can you give us the keys, please?

182
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:01,234
And how much would you pay?

183
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:11,742
Okay, That's $ 200.
- What? $ 200?

184
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:14,852
Cash. Our kredietpasautomaat does not work.

185
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:16,616
Fantastic.
- Pay him normal.

186
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:20,988
This would not cost more than $ 50?
- That was so, yes.

187
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:23,493
Pay it simply, Dell.
- Okay.

188
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,825
Thank you.

189
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:30,276
Can we order food or something?

190
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:31,135
I made a list.

191
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:43,845
There is everything available,
cost per piece.

192
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:50,450
Ipods and portable DVD players?
- Also available for rent at night.

193
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:56,428
Beautiful collection of films, games or
activities for your enjoyment.

194
00:22:56,897 --> 00:23:00,229
We watch TV a lot, usually.
I'm sorry, our rooms

195
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:04,895
are not equipped with TVs. Many of our
guests come to escape them properly.

196
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:08,917
Well, the portable DVD player.

197
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:10,305
Honey, it's very expensive, do not you think?

198
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:13,484
There is a risk involved for

199
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:17,253
these things get so small I
have to take charge ...

200
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,296
A little?

201
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,341
Okay, fine.

202
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:24,424
We call you when we need some.

203
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:30,255
Sure, I'm here.
- Thank you.

204
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:33,920
Of course, I want my guests feel at home.

205
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:39,434
My name is Guy and I are 24
-7 there, well, since the crisis began then.

206
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,100
Call but if you need anything,
no matter what. I'm here.

207
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:45,903
You do not need to worry about.

208
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:02,989
What did you think of the janitor?
- You mean the receptionist.

209
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:05,796
I even unnecessary.

210
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:13,809
I wonder if he ever picked up
anything decent in his life.

211
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,340
He's a little eccentric.

212
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:18,369
That list looked quite cool, so
we want something from?

213
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,945
I do not know.

214
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:23,344
It says: $ 3 for a bottle of
water. $ 10 for a sandwich.

215
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:28,510
Come on, there must be a
shop here in the neighborhood.

216
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:30,518
Just use the list.

217
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:32,352
Honey, I do not see why
we should spend money unnecessarily.

218
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:34,728
We do not waste money.

219
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:39,860
Come on, let's just stay here. Feel
safe, for now ... yes?

220
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:44,530
Okay, we'll stay here and order
some of the list.

221
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,138
Moreover, we have enough food in the
camp that we can eat.

222
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:47,669
Nice.

223
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:52,378
But tomorrow I'm looking to see if I
can buy some at normal cost.

224
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:55,302
I'm not off by that bum on the counter.

225
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:56,440
He is no bum.

226
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,160
More like a pedophile.

227
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:18,430
NEW RESULTS FUEL CRISIS

228
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,476
Yes, wait.

229
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:29,214
SPREAD PANIC AND VIOLENCE RECORDED IN NYC

230
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:43,224
Where's the lady?
- Under the docuhe.

231
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:45,631
Got everything?

232
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,458
Sure, magazines, or 2 weeks old.

233
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:50,934
That's all, better than nothing, right?
- Yes.

234
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,787
And I have snacks for you or your wife.

235
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:57,990
Oh, we're not married, she's my girlfriend.

236
00:25:57,352 --> 00:25:59,144
Sure, nice, I suppose.

237
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:00,968
And what is it, $ 35, right?

238
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:04,683
I also ask $ 5 for delivery.

239
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:07,184
It is therefore $ 40
- Delivery?

240
00:26:07,388 --> 00:26:10,259
You say anything about delivery.

241
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:10,619
Hi.

242
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:12,314
Hello.

243
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:17,220
$ 35 here, okay?
- $ 40 including delivery.

244
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:19,755
Listen friend, I do not understand what
you're trying to get here.

245
00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:21,333
But your prices are slightly exaggerated.

246
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,733
If you can get this stuff anywhere else,
I love you not to hear.

247
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,860
We are glad that we get from you. Pay him.

248
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:31,205
Listen, I understand it a
little difficult now.

249
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:33,483
So, I pay a little extra
now, more than usual.

250
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:35,474
But come on man, you are exaggerating a bit.

251
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,974
I show you the price, you'd
have to buy anything though.

252
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:41,786
You've called me.
- Yes, and to be honest

253
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:44,890
I felt like I had been taken but it
will be, we wanted to have this.

254
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,426
But now you ask me, delivery,
out of the blue?

255
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:51,269
It's not that, it's my standard delivery fee.

256
00:26:51,495 --> 00:26:53,566
There is sometimes a manager or
someone I can achieve?

257
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:55,660
Let me know what you're doing.
- Dell, be nice.

258
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,829
We are talking here.
- Well, I'm about.

259
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,319
If you do not like what this is,
we do not have to do this.

260
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,169
Well, mate, actually ...

261
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,213
Please, we are satisfied with what you give.

262
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:10,411
He's a little upside down when
he should spend money.

263
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,437
It's a bit of a hectic period for everyone.

264
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:14,348
Listen, let me handle this, okay?

265
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:17,786
You're pretty rude.
- You know, you trade it and see, okay.

266
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,990
Not very, as I said,
what everyone is stressed.

267
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:30,535
What we owe you?
- It comes to $ 45.

268
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:38,175
Okay, let me just pay.
- Jesus, unbelievable.

269
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:44,882
I'm sorry for the turmoil.
- No problem.

270
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:49,500
Enjoy your meal.

271
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:02,326
What is your problem?
- My problem? Are you kidding?

272
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:04,435
Angry and your enemy up with
no reason for it?

273
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:06,664
He tried to take advantage of us.
I tried him to stop.

274
00:28:06,874 --> 00:28:08,361
What exactly are making an extra few bucks?

275
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:10,810
Piper, you can not let you be snowed under.

276
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:15,613
Forget that stupid. He continues with excuses
to then ask for money.

277
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:17,774
You exaggerate!
- You ...

278
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,317
Do not make a point.

279
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:25,680
A showdown with the concierge
is just ridiculous.

280
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,991
Really? So you think it's a dirty showdown?

281
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:31,792
Yes, he works 24 hours a day
for a few dollars more

282
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:36,528
people a pleasure to do.
- You're so naive, you know?

283
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,963
Yes, and are such a smart guy.

284
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:41,641
It's all relative, compared to you.

285
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:45,642
I am the great explorer.
- It'll do. Childish.

286
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:48,211
I was trying to protect you, damn it?

287
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:52,444
I'm a short walk away from this bullshit.
- Dell!

288
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:01,189
Bullshit, damn.

289
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:05,557
Yes Dad ... Everything is fine.

290
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:15,639
Yes, Dell arranged for the best
hotel, best room ...

291
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:18,768
and the service is really great.

292
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:43,299
What is it?
- Nothing.

293
00:29:46,507 --> 00:29:50,238
Sorry Dad. Can I call you back?

294
00:29:50,677 --> 00:29:52,645
Yes, yes, I have to go now.

295
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:59,998
Everything is fine ... Okay,
I love you. Doeg.

296
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:02,884
Your Father?
- Yes.

297
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:07,666
Tell me what happened?
- I do not want crazy.

298
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:10,730
Okay, tell me, for I am your
stack mesjokke if you say something.

299
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,928
I went to some blocks ...

300
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:16,759
I then heard some controversy.
- And?

301
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:20,640
I do not know exactly, but it seemed

302
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,839
A raid or something.
- I'll call the police.

303
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:33,228
Okay, how is it that 112 is not working?

304
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:35,321
I do not think the police or
whatever is nearby to help.

305
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:38,830
Think, no gasoline, how do you
think they come here?

306
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:40,701
Nonsense, of course that petrol.

307
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:42,592
Already a police on the street, anywhere?

308
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,128
Well, not me.

309
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,259
Okay, what do we do? Guy calls?

310
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:53,166
Guy? From the desk?

311
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:55,102
Yes.
- Are you serious is it?

312
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:57,266
Well, we have to do what?

313
00:31:01,582 --> 00:31:06,712
Listen, be honest ... it did not look
so bad. More panic on my part

314
00:31:06,712 --> 00:31:08,980
I went out just what my roof, that's all.

315
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,558
I want only what is on my ease, Dell.

316
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,363
Are you okay?
- Yes.

317
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:32,725
Yes.

318
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:36,663
I swear.

319
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:46,168
Damn what?

320
00:33:55,622 --> 00:34:00,423
Hey, Damn, what are you doing?
- What is it, what happens?

321
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:04,787
Get out, motherfucker!

322
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:06,800
An asshole who wanted to steal our gas.

323
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,467
What? Stolen anything?

324
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:09,467
No, it is him lubricated.

325
00:34:10,723 --> 00:34:12,584
We have to go here.
- Now?

326
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,196
I would not stay here. Not funny anymore.

327
00:34:14,196 --> 00:34:15,967
Where?
- The summer house.

328
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,407
What I wanted to go much earlier.

329
00:34:18,612 --> 00:34:23,548
No, listen. I'll stay here a minute longer
if someone steals gasoline from us

330
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:25,878
He has nothing stolen. I scared him
off. What does that make?

331
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,826
I want to leave, I'm not safe here anymore.

332
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:32,209
I have spent $ 200 on.
- What do I care about the money now, Dell.

333
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,750
I'm not risking our lives because we
have been given $ 200

334
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:37,989
There must be something else we
can go, but the summerhouse.

335
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:41,257
I'm sorry that you are not my father.
- I never said.

336
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:44,769
I'm just saying I do not want
to be dependent on him.

337
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,386
Fine. You're right. We pack our things.

338
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:23,701
Meet the big bucks.
- Nice place.

339
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,866
Can your father is no castle afford?
- It's a holiday.

340
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:34,208
So many states it's also not.
- As if I had suggested otherwise.

341
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:39,882
You just get used to it. Like my father.

342
00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:44,547
It is but the rugged exterior.
- A rugged exterior, you call him?

343
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:49,525
He's not as bad as he arises.
- You're right. A great guy.

344
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:53,497
As if we have dinner with him and
he no question about my life.

345
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,650
I wish it would happen more often.

346
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:02,863
I'm going to take a shower
before we go to bed.

347
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:05,672
Where is it?
- Step on the right.

348
00:40:11,374 --> 00:40:13,815
Dell, honey. Wake up.

349
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,544
No power.

350
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,641
What time is it?

351
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:33,310
No power. Should have happened last night.

352
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:38,753
Maybe a blown fuse.

353
00:40:42,128 --> 00:40:44,688
Only in this room?
- No, the toilet and the hall also.

354
00:40:47,467 --> 00:40:48,695
Cunt.

355
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:36,410
Cunt.

356
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,180
Damn!
- Sorry, I did not know.

357
00:41:56,603 --> 00:41:59,800
Back on?
- No.

358
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:05,171
Now?
- No.

359
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:08,740
Cunt!

360
00:42:09,282 --> 00:42:10,874
Do you think this area is
called the failure affected?

361
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:14,352
It's not the fuse, unless the
case concerns the whole stop.

362
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:17,356
God!
- Maybe a cable or something.

363
00:42:18,324 --> 00:42:20,451
Who will fix?
- Nobody.

364
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:25,727
So, what do we do?
- What about your house warming?

365
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:30,826
No idea, electricity?
- Shit.

366
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,969
Nondedju!
- Wait a minute.

367
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,617
No, it's now the day Expl ...

368
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,164
We use the fireplace, then
we can just continue.

369
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,104
It goes from bad to worse.
- No, not that bad though.

370
00:42:42,448 --> 00:42:46,281
Look, all these cans of food, pasta ...

371
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:49,853
How will heat the pasta? The
oven does not agree.

372
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:55,558
We have camping bunch more. The campfire.

373
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:58,286
And the news? You surely are you aware

374
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:00,960
we completely shut off from
the civilized world.

375
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,227
Dell, stop it!
- Look, it's all fucking heavy!

376
00:43:03,227 --> 00:43:05,930
I will not sit and pretend everything
is fine, because it is not.

377
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,767
Lets face it, the situation is just cunt,
until we ourselves going fucked up!

378
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:12,935
Honey, calm now ... No, I
do not settle down. No.

379
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:29,559
When they said that?
- Yes, I know, I know t.

380
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:30,855
My God.

381
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:35,423
Watch out. Okay bro, I love you.

382
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:39,163
Dad, I gotta go. The battery is almost
empty and I 'm not charging.

383
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,701
Yes, do not forget. I'll call you
back in a few hours, okay?

384
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:49,949
I love you, I gotta go, bye.

385
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:54,388
And how's your brother?

386
00:43:54,388 --> 00:43:56,649
He was watching the news on
when the power went out.

387
00:43:56,956 --> 00:43:59,463
And it was announced that the crisis is to

388
00:43:59,463 --> 00:44:02,999
Could take three months, we have power again.

389
00:44:03,663 --> 00:44:05,528
Three months?
- Yes, he told me.

390
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,750
And your father, what did he say?

391
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:13,966
And they ride bikes everywhere. Use only

392
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:15,498
cars when absolutely necessary.

393
00:44:15,498 --> 00:44:20,308
And he said he wanted me, so
us, to come to England.

394
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:23,678
He wants us to come to England?

395
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:26,975
I'm sorry, baby, but your father seems to
me some of the clasp tapped.

396
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:27,586
Do not be.

397
00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:29,884
Not surprising that he thinks
he's Napoleon or something.

398
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:32,547
But he is confident stroke.
- You're mean.

399
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:36,675
Sorry, did you forget what he said
to me, right in my face?

400
00:44:37,372 --> 00:44:39,462
But first I had an expensive
university education and then

401
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:41,992
had to get a degree before I
could even deal with you.

402
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:44,169
I know that my father sometimes
can be a jerk but

403
00:44:44,169 --> 00:44:46,450
does not mean he does not
have to worry about us.

404
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,726
I try not, you're forcing me to.

405
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:52,113
You say you he wants "we"
have to come to England?

406
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:54,330
And you know yourself that it's hogwash.
- Whatever.

407
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,672
I'll get some wood for the fireplace.
- Why? It's not cold.

408
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:03,748
Would you sit in a dark
house? I have a flashlight.

409
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:08,381
Your childish behavior.
- Because it is wood?

410
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:10,510
It does not matter to me whether
we have a fire, okay?

411
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:13,762
I'll do it myself.
- Fine.

412
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:55,499
Would that be enough?

413
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:38,141
I must have fallen asleep.
- Yes, the fireplace a good
start to get going.

414
00:46:44,157 --> 00:46:45,886
Nothing, just nonsense.

415
00:46:51,264 --> 00:46:56,395
Sounds strange but ... it feels almost good.
- What do you mean?

416
00:46:57,603 --> 00:47:00,300
With everything going on.

417
00:47:04,677 --> 00:47:08,579
We make it. Maybe we are better off this way.

418
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:15,536
It is the great similarity,
it does not matter

419
00:47:15,536 --> 00:47:19,223
whether you're a rich or a poor
devil stinker, it does not matter.

420
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:24,724
You're not fat cats. That makes
me not care at all.

421
00:47:24,724 --> 00:47:29,620
I know, but because I ...
- Hey, just you and me.

422
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,671
Exactly, and that is why I stay.

423
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:30,860
Do you?

424
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,592
I know one of the past but
that was a little one.

425
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:36,000
Leeggerooft may be?

426
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:41,835
We can go to that house and
take everything we can meenenem.

427
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:48,539
A good idea, why did we not previously?

428
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:51,139
Do you?
- Yes k've got a good feeling.

429
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:12,869
I try to remember. It is
quite a long time ago.

430
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:19,207
An accident or something?

431
00:49:25,818 --> 00:49:29,276
Probably out of gas?
- Unusual. Just push it?

432
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:34,255
Honey, I'm afraid.
- Do not worry, it come good.

433
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:36,990
I'm with you.

434
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,729
No, stay here. Be right back.

435
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:05,589
Wait, man. That's my car.

436
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:09,386
Are you out of gas?
- Just before a bridge too shitty.

437
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:18,425
Sucks.
- Yes, it's all bollocks.

438
00:50:18,425 --> 00:50:23,507
I want to go to my mother, she
is sick and who does not kutverpleegster.

439
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:26,574
In any case ...

440
00:50:26,574 --> 00:50:29,910
could you help me to him from off the road.

441
00:50:39,658 --> 00:50:42,627
You want me ...?
- Put it in neutral and I push.

442
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,634
I'm now pushing. Send him but to the side.

443
00:51:08,687 --> 00:51:11,451
Good.
- Sorry about your car.

444
00:51:11,724 --> 00:51:14,989
So is the way life is, right?

445
00:51:16,729 --> 00:51:18,993
I gotta go.
- Sure.

446
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:27,899
Ok, thanks, man.
- Good luck.

447
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:30,445
You too.
- Thanks.

448
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,744
What was there?
- No more petrol ..

449
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,830
What will he do now?
- No idea.

450
00:51:47,326 --> 00:51:49,521
Can we offer to no lift or something?

451
00:51:50,629 --> 00:51:55,622
Piper, we know nothing of that host.
- I know, but you helped him anyway?

452
00:51:55,622 --> 00:51:58,990
He has not done anything, right?

453
00:51:59,572 --> 00:52:01,972
It just does not feel good to a
stranger in our car to have.

454
00:52:03,676 --> 00:52:08,409
We can not ask where to go?
- Piper, I really do not.

455
00:52:13,919 --> 00:52:15,853
Fine, whatever.

456
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:22,151
Hey, buddy?
- Yes.

457
00:52:22,151 --> 00:52:25,991
Do you need a lift or something?
- Man, that would be great.

458
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,880
Okay, step.
- Thank you.

459
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,171
Many thanks.

460
00:52:50,556 --> 00:52:51,764
Where did you go on our way?

461
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:54,686
Man, if you would bring me a
few miles, it would be nice.

462
00:52:55,995 --> 00:52:58,970
Sure I can go further from there.

463
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:03,231
Thanks, I really appreciate that.

464
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:06,725
No problem. Sorry for your car. You
have nothing left there anyway?

465
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,703
Nah, it's so good.

466
00:53:25,124 --> 00:53:28,321
Turn it right.
- Here?

467
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:30,461
Yes, this rotation.

468
00:53:30,696 --> 00:53:35,690
In the middle of the bush.
Okay, turn here but.

469
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:46,871
Stop right there.
- Here? Are you sure?

470
00:53:51,183 --> 00:53:54,583
Step out of the car. Get
off this fucking car.

471
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:56,550
Get out! Okay, calm down!

472
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:59,351
I help only! Shut up, shut up, that car!

473
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:02,759
Well I'm low.

474
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:04,623
Get out!

475
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:09,585
Do not make me mad!

476
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:25,900
Do not touch my arm! Stop!

477
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:37,657
Piper, the car!

478
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:57,415
No, no!
- I sucked his blood on me.

479
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:03,647
Cunt. I never got stabbed?
- Do you remember?

480
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:09,749
You have to go and him help.
- Damn, that you kidding?

481
00:55:09,749 --> 00:55:12,454
This guy tried to abduct. Why?

482
00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:15,624
We helped him alone. I do not understand!
- This is ridiculous.

483
00:55:19,805 --> 00:55:22,350
Cunt.
- Do not you stop?

484
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:24,287
You should be thanking me, hugging me.

485
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,300
You can 't let it not die, right?

486
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,230
The only reason he was in the car

487
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:33,160
for him to give a kutlift!
- I'm trying to grasp what was happening.

488
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:40,745
If this shit happened in the Middle Ages

489
00:55:40,745 --> 00:55:42,786
you would not call the police.

490
00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:45,759
There was no security.
- Don 't like you're retarded!

491
00:55:45,964 --> 00:55:48,727
You know what? You can pot,
Piper, really the pot!

492
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:51,563
Do not talk to me!
- Call me not backward!

493
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,856
After all I've done just for you?

494
00:55:53,856 --> 00:55:55,432
You're terrible.

495
00:55:55,432 --> 00:55:58,669
I'm terrible? Do you think I had a choice?

496
00:55:59,169 --> 00:55:59,927
Choice for what?

497
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:02,645
Did you think we could get away
without me him stabbed him?

498
00:56:02,645 --> 00:56:06,460
I can not, I can not ...
- Oh, you fucking now?

499
00:56:08,585 --> 00:56:11,417
Okay, damn it, great!

500
00:56:19,398 --> 00:56:21,366
What happened, happened.
- Easy for you to say.

501
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:27,563
You wanted to bring that bastard and I
need to clean up your mess?

502
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:29,710
It's not fair.

503
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,779
Indeed, it is not.

504
00:57:13,352 --> 00:57:15,115
Thank you.

505
00:57:28,534 --> 00:57:32,368
Are you mad at me?
- I am disappointed.

506
00:57:32,638 --> 00:57:36,904
What?
- In so many things.

507
00:57:39,912 --> 00:57:44,474
What things?
- The situation, everything.

508
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,756
Once in the car?
- I could go to hell, you
said, you were so angry.

509
00:57:57,756 --> 00:58:00,364
Given the circumstances, you had better
neglect can catch me.

510
00:58:01,567 --> 00:58:07,870
You really frightened now.
- I just want to understand, help me.

511
00:58:13,946 --> 00:58:19,475
Why did you have quarreled about
today? Of course I'm grateful.

512
00:58:20,786 --> 00:58:24,313
You risked your life for me. I ...

513
00:58:26,325 --> 00:58:31,240
But? I ... I do not know, it scares me ...

514
00:58:31,296 --> 00:58:33,594
What made you afraid? I've stabbed someone?

515
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,230
You can not sit there as if you did not care.

516
00:58:37,257 --> 00:58:38,880
It scares me!
- Pure nonsense!

517
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,162
What nonsense?

518
00:58:41,162 --> 00:58:42,965
From the first day I was trying
to prove myself to you!

519
00:58:42,965 --> 00:58:45,900
That has nothing to do with it.
- Has everything to do with it!

520
00:58:52,484 --> 00:58:54,525
I'm the bastard never wanted the car.

521
00:58:54,525 --> 00:58:55,317
I know I made a mistake.

522
00:58:55,317 --> 00:58:58,446
Yes, I know it that your mistake.
But I have sure pay!

523
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:01,237
You think so much smarter than me.

524
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,924
You make a point about everywhere

525
00:59:02,924 --> 00:59:06,827
salvaged and how naive I am or not.
- You are, is that my fault?

526
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:10,630
You know, I can not.

527
01:00:24,977 --> 01:00:27,502
Have you slept here all night?
-Yes.

528
01:00:46,732 --> 01:00:48,261
Where you going?

529
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:53,159
To the lake, there is a
section where you can fish.

530
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:55,602
You're you're surely aware that the
more likely it is frozen?

531
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:57,782
They call it ice fishing, Dell.

532
01:00:59,812 --> 01:01:01,940
It's not so much frozen!

533
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:42,845
Let me help you.

534
01:02:29,134 --> 01:02:34,333
I did not know you can eat frozen fish.
- You can not pretend nothing has happened.

535
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:37,321
I do not.

536
01:02:39,745 --> 01:02:43,100
Someone down and stabbing him there
to die, is this normal?

537
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:46,444
We have done nothing wrong,
it was an accident.

538
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:50,610
An accident? You put one down by accident.

539
01:02:57,229 --> 01:03:00,221
He was the one who threatened with
a knife. He tried to abduct.

540
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:01,907
Why did you do then stabbed twice?

541
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:03,691
I wanted to make sure that he
would do us no pain.

542
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:05,632
I had to stop him.

543
01:03:12,277 --> 01:03:14,266
Why not give me the feeling that
this is all my fault?

544
01:03:14,266 --> 01:03:15,538
I do not.

545
01:03:18,116 --> 01:03:20,846
I'm not here to ridicule because you
invited him to ride more.

546
01:03:22,487 --> 01:03:24,921
Why do you blame me that I protect?
- I know you do not.

547
01:03:28,126 --> 01:03:31,151
I just wish this never happened.

548
01:03:31,151 --> 01:03:33,264
Are you glad that it happened?

549
01:03:37,235 --> 01:03:39,863
I would do anything for you to take it back.

550
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:06,353
I can not believe we eat frozen fish.

551
01:04:06,565 --> 01:04:08,320
Why not? They do it enough in Alaska.

552
01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:29,449
Have you left the door open? No,
I do not think so.

553
01:04:33,892 --> 01:04:35,792
Stop, both!
- Run, run!

554
01:04:35,994 --> 01:04:37,484
Quick! Go!

555
01:04:38,997 --> 01:04:41,396
Inside!
- Okay, okay.

556
01:04:41,396 --> 01:04:43,295
Does not!
- Okay, okay!

557
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:46,620
Come on, this is our house!
- Do you have weapons?

558
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:49,601
What, you just rob us? Keep your Kanis!

559
01:04:49,601 --> 01:04:51,471
Take those bags, they have nothing we want!

560
01:04:53,922 --> 01:04:56,862
Hey, you lucky. Some people shoot
at you for fun.

561
01:04:56,862 --> 01:04:59,141
Yeah, thanks for that. You're welcome.

562
01:05:26,701 --> 01:05:29,950
They brought all the food
we had. You bastards!

563
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:30,738
They will come back.

564
01:05:30,738 --> 01:05:32,445
They're not coming back, because there's
nothing more to be gained.

565
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:35,776
But they can come back.
- Listen, I can not look far ahead, okay?

566
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:02,910
Okay.

567
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:07,549
Listen, I gotta go because the
battery is running out.

568
01:06:08,753 --> 01:06:14,658
I'll call you in a few hours
back, okay? I love you.

569
01:06:17,629 --> 01:06:21,291
What's going on?
- I was talking to my dad.

570
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:21,973
And?

571
01:06:21,973 --> 01:06:26,836
He said he would help us get out of here.

572
01:06:30,269 --> 01:06:32,933
I know, but we need help. We
can not stay here, Dell.

573
01:06:34,145 --> 01:06:35,772
We have no choice, Piper.

574
01:06:36,114 --> 01:06:38,129
My father said people knew

575
01:06:38,129 --> 01:06:40,380
who have their own boat, who
could dock in the harbor.

576
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:43,586
Really?
- It was worth a try.

577
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:46,162
With this gas crisis ...

578
01:06:46,162 --> 01:06:48,455
I have my serious doubts that
even ships might go somewhere.

579
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,790
If it does not work, then
we have lost nothing.

580
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:55,889
Come on, Dell. I can not stand
that macho bullshit talk to you.

581
01:06:56,134 --> 01:06:57,561
Call it what you want.

582
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:01,630
This is quite different to take
money from my father

583
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:07,620
This is survival, Dell.

584
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,247
I know we can.
- Somebody just broke into our house!

585
01:07:13,351 --> 01:07:16,377
We can at night not even sleep,
come on, do not ...

586
01:07:17,822 --> 01:07:22,486
We have to leave.
- What if he fails?

587
01:07:27,532 --> 01:07:31,559
I have no choice. But if he
can help us we go, Dell.

588
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:44,146
We would not even be talking about,
because it is simply impossible.

589
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:49,285
Hey but if he gets us out, will you join me?

590
01:07:51,256 --> 01:07:52,600
Yes.

591
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,457
Yes, I will go.

592
01:08:12,883 --> 01:08:13,946
Hi Dad.

593
01:08:16,298 --> 01:08:16,970
Okay.

594
01:08:21,686 --> 01:08:23,847
I'll call you in a few hours back, okay.

595
01:08:27,158 --> 01:08:30,355
I love you, adios.

596
01:08:34,599 --> 01:08:39,298
What did he say?
- Nothing new. He works there still.

597
01:08:41,606 --> 01:08:45,133
Listen, go get some sleep, okay?
You'll feel much better tomorrow.

598
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,560
Thank you.

599
01:09:54,345 --> 01:09:55,868
What is it?
- Good morning, honey.

600
01:09:55,868 --> 01:09:58,642
Where did you get all that food come from?
- Oh, found in a box in the basement.

601
01:09:58,917 --> 01:10:01,942
You have certainly overlooked. How many
left? We need to ration.

602
01:10:01,942 --> 01:10:03,850
I phoned my dad this morning. And?

603
01:10:05,423 --> 01:10:08,983
It's him successful. We go out
of here, baby. To England.

604
01:10:08,983 --> 01:10:12,118
A ship stops at the nearest
port and picks us up.

605
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:14,162
We should note at 16.00 hours.

606
01:10:14,162 --> 01:10:18,201
Can not. There is no fuel, no oil,
or peanut butter sometimes you doin?

607
01:10:18,403 --> 01:10:22,396
There is fuel, not only in the States.
Europe is now rationed, but my

608
01:10:22,607 --> 01:10:25,410
dad says not so fast runs.
- Unbelievable.

609
01:10:30,315 --> 01:10:34,274
Yes, you're right. I'm happy. Let's go eat.

610
01:10:37,589 --> 01:10:40,716
By the way, my phone is dead.
- Really?

611
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:45,795
Yes, but we still have yours.
- Mine is dead too.

612
01:10:47,966 --> 01:10:51,697
What? I thought the more power
you have yours than mine?

613
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:56,454
What should we do if something happens
the way to the port?

614
01:10:56,454 --> 01:10:57,841
You know the way to this?

615
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:02,174
I wrote down the route. But I have
not taken into account without a phone.

616
01:11:03,381 --> 01:11:06,440
God, this is so annoying, I do not even hear.

617
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,190
Yes.

618
01:11:08,953 --> 01:11:10,982
Why did not you tell me about your phone say?

619
01:11:10,982 --> 01:11:11,717
Not thought about.

620
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:13,738
Moreover, sitting somewhere in verweggistan

621
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:15,347
If you already can get in touch with someone.

622
01:11:15,347 --> 01:11:17,120
What do you think they do?

623
01:11:20,265 --> 01:11:22,165
I really wish you had told me.

624
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,724
You have the route?
- Yes, we still have plenty of time.

625
01:11:58,269 --> 01:12:00,134
We do not have enough gasoline.

626
01:12:07,445 --> 01:12:09,741
How far can we go in the tank?
- Hopefully the whole way.

627
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:12,600
We have 30
-40 minutes to arrive there.

628
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:16,253
Do not worry, we will get there.

629
01:12:27,565 --> 01:12:29,863
I think we need another 32 km.

630
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:42,867
Oh my God.

631
01:12:42,867 --> 01:12:44,345
We can walk the last km, we have time.

632
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,726
It is light that makes me scared.

633
01:12:49,537 --> 01:12:50,645
As if there is constant
curse hanging over us.

634
01:12:50,645 --> 01:12:51,648
Not so dramatic.

635
01:13:01,203 --> 01:13:04,668
Okay, we need to Halcon Road is
still 16 km to the port.

636
01:13:04,668 --> 01:13:07,661
We will get there, you watch.
- Can not you a little harder?

637
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:10,593
No, I keep the speed constant.

638
01:13:10,873 --> 01:13:13,352
You use more gas if you give more gas.

639
01:13:13,634 --> 01:13:15,500
A little more gas, so more gas?

640
01:13:15,856 --> 01:13:18,948
So easy. That means I do
not do much to accelerate.

641
01:13:18,948 --> 01:13:21,313
If I do do I use more gasoline.

642
01:13:29,991 --> 01:13:32,863
Shit. Nothing wrong.
- No, please, please.

643
01:13:32,863 --> 01:13:35,230
It cost us more than two
hours to reach the port.

644
01:13:35,433 --> 01:13:36,900
We have two hours when we need it.

645
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,798
What if we get lost, run the wrong direction?

646
01:13:38,798 --> 01:13:40,335
We're not going away without us, Piper.

647
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:46,830
I do not know.
- Come on run, we have no time to lose.

648
01:13:47,345 --> 01:13:48,505
Shit.

649
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,979
All these things carry?
- Just in geaval that.

650
01:14:00,425 --> 01:14:01,254
You think we will not make it.

651
01:14:01,254 --> 01:14:02,950
I never said that, I just take them along.

652
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:04,753
Come on, we gotta go.

653
01:14:26,117 --> 01:14:29,520
We were already at the exit should be.
Perhaps the distance from incorrectly chat.

654
01:14:31,654 --> 01:14:34,290
We can not go back now,
that's no longer an option.

655
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:36,451
Just go, okay.

656
01:14:37,228 --> 01:14:38,957
I can not stand.

657
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:03,243
Shit, is that a car?

658
01:15:06,691 --> 01:15:09,230
Would they have gas?
- No idea.

659
01:15:10,328 --> 01:15:12,318
Hey, manage it?

660
01:15:12,318 --> 01:15:15,932
I do not think they have
seen us. Even up close.

661
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:20,280
How do we know they are trustworthy?
- You do not know, it seems fine.

662
01:15:21,172 --> 01:15:22,503
I think I did more horror.

663
01:15:22,503 --> 01:15:25,402
You do not think I am about to pee.
- Come on, we gotta go.

664
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:27,738
Walk forward and arouse attention.

665
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:29,871
Okay.

666
01:15:42,493 --> 01:15:44,723
Hello, we are but two, we do no harm!

667
01:15:44,929 --> 01:15:47,550
Not come closer, okay?

668
01:15:50,722 --> 01:15:54,394
Who is there with you, I see it not?
- My friend, he is okay.

669
01:15:54,394 --> 01:15:56,267
Just camping gear!

670
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,467
We have nothing, we can not help you ..

671
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:02,738
We just need to Bridgeport Harbor,
a few km away.

672
01:16:11,956 --> 01:16:13,651
Okay, okay, come on. We take you along.

673
01:16:13,858 --> 01:16:15,520
Quick!

674

How are you?

676
01:16:21,465 --> 01:16:23,558
Thank you, thank you very much.

677
01:16:23,768 --> 01:16:26,760
So you go to the port?

01:16:32,743 --> 01:16:33,493
<i>Yes.</i>

680

<i>Yes, I go with.</i>

681
01:16:38,883 --> 01:16:42,147
It's Halcon Road direction, you know?

682
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:44,753
<i>It almost feels good.
- What do you mean?</i>

683
01:16:44,753 --> 01:16:50,350

<i>Yes I know where it is, about 15
-20 minutes away ...</i>

685
01:16:57,435 --> 01:16:59,835
<i>If we wish, we can
live here year round.</i>

686
01:16:59,835 --> 01:17:03,873
<i>Hunting, fishing and a campfire.</i>

687
01:17:04,909 --> 01:17:08,215
<i>Where you going?</i>

688
01:17:08,215 --> 01:17:09,705
No matter where we go.

689
01:17:09,705 --> 01:17:11,940
Oh, you do not tell us though.

690
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:15,712
<i>There are currently many robberies and
threats here. Quite dangerous here.</i>

691
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:22,357
It is what krapjes.
- Does not matter.

692
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,375
<i>You people are not your run</i>

693
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,155
<i>and certainly not as it now stands.</i>

694
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:28,594
Hi, thank you.

695
01:17:29,934 --> 01:17:32,493
<i>Stop here.
- Here?</i>

696
01:17:32,493 --> 01:17:35,400
Honey, come on, hurry up.

697
01:17:40,845 --> 01:17:41,937
<i>Fuck you!</i>

698
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:44,261
Go on, honey.

699
01:17:44,261 --> 01:17:45,809
<i>Do not you put
someone down accidentally.</i>

700
01:17:49,687 --> 01:17:51,279
Come on, we gotta go.

701
01:17:51,555 --> 01:17:54,460
<i>If this happened in the Middle
Ages or some such ...</i>

702
01:17:54,325 --> 01:17:57,550
<i>you can not polite to call,
or the security alert.</i>

703
01:17:59,797 --> 01:18:01,162
Listen honey, I would not count.

704
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:04,910
What?

705
01:18:04,368 --> 01:18:08,133
<i>You lucky man. There are people
shooting you down for fun.</i>

706
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:10,102
Why tell me this now?

707
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:13,539
<i>Have you seen somewhere the police?
- Not me!</i>

708
01:18:13,539 --> 01:18:16,780
What happened to him? I want it just a ride.

709
01:18:16,753 --> 01:18:20,658
It's all right. Dell get into the car,
we have an amazing talk about.

710
01:18:21,525 --> 01:18:24,870
I can not.
- What are you doing, doing?

711
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,390
Come on baby, stay with me.
- I can not believe you do this.

712
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:36,310
I can not.
- We will find food and shelter.

713
01:18:39,829 --> 01:18:42,904
<i>I feel like fucking a real man here.</i>

714
01:18:42,904 --> 01:18:46,568
We can not stay here all
day while you are arguing.

715
01:18:46,777 --> 01:18:48,404
Come with me.

716
01:18:50,948 --> 01:18:52,600
I can not.

717
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:58,153
<i>How would you feel if you
were to ask to marry?</i>

718
01:19:05,663 --> 01:19:07,620
Can we go?

719
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:12,227
<i>You and I together.
- Exactly.</i>

720
01:19:13,804 --> 01:19:15,465
<i>And I want it that way.</i>

721
01:19:22,613 --> 01:19:27,107
If he can help us, then go right?
- Okay, but do not have too much hope.

722
01:19:30,688 --> 01:19:33,987
Yes, let's go.

723
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:42,132
<i>Come on, this is our house.
- Do you have weapons?</i>

724
01:19:42,132 --> 01:19:43,426
<i>No.</i>

725
01:19:53,511 --> 01:19:54,842
<i>Dell! Do not!</i>
