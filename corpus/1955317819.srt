00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:52,150
#HUNT FOR THE UNICORN KILLER#

2
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:13,370
You sure you want to come back here again?
- Things are different now, Daddy.

3
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,662
I just wasn't sure what I was
doing up here the first time.

4
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,556
I still don't know what's wrong
with all the colleges in Texas.

5
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,159
Well, I don't know if
I like it here, Honey.

6
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:38,834
Don't worry, Daddy.
- Oh, Honey.

7
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:41,412
Don't say that doodlebug,
I'm your father.

8
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:43,967
That's my job: to worry.

9
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:46,239
You haven't called me
that in a long time.

10
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,585
Well, for a few years
there, I didn't think

11
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:51,099
you wanted to hear it,
so I was real careful.

12
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,500
I guess I didn't like a lot
of things there for a while.

13
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:58,897
But you don't have to be
so careful anymore, Daddy.

14
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:02,575
We're okay.
- Yeah.

15
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,318
Come on!
- I don't know.

16
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:16,126
So you were here before. - Yeah.
I left after freshman year.

17
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:19,928
Why?
- Just not sure what I wanted to do yet.

18
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:23,718
Did some traveling.
Tried college back home.

19
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,719
That was not a good idea.

20
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,472
You're born in Tyler, Texas, you
usually die in Tyler, Texas.

21
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,209
All my friends from high
school married each other.

22
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:36,098
Some of them have their
first baby already. Not me.

23
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:38,423
There's still too much I want to do.

24
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,103
How old are you?

25
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,650
Twenty-one.
- Cool!

26
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:50,116
Hey everybody! Holly can buy beer!

27
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Where you goin'?

28
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:22,282
Dear Meg: Well, it's less
intimidating here the second time "

29
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:25,829
Megan, a few years
off was healthy, I suppose.

30
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,928
So was putting in all that time
and effort to lose my Texas twang.

31
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:35,004
I went to my first anti-war
march the other day. Don't tell Daddy!

32
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:39,727
Don't tell Daddy!" There's an exclamation
point after that, so don't tell.

33
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,769
Don't tell, Mary. - I won't
tell. - "Funny. I never felt

34
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,871
like I fit in back there in Texas, but "

35
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,946
I don't really feel like
I fit in here, either.

36
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
Who knows?

37
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,964
Now, remember: remember you guys can
use my room and stereo but only if you

38
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:58,765
turn it up really loud once in a while
so Daddy thinks I'm still at home.

39
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:03,953
What are you guys doin' up there?
Turn it down!

40
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:07,763
Love you all.
Holly.

41
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,585
Join us at the rally.

42
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,904
What's going on?
- Earth Day.

43
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:18,905
What's Earth Day?

44
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:03,795
Better when Khrushchev
does it, isn't it?

45
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,596
Too much with a sandal.

46
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:10,445
Greetings! I'm Ira Einhorn!

47
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,391
On behalf of the City of Philadelphia.

48
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:16,418
The City of...

49
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:19,749
Brotherly Love

50
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:23,631
I'd like to welcome you to
the very first Earth Day!

51
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:32,225
Earth Day is not about confrontation.

52
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:35,106
It's a celebration! Isn't it?

53
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,777
Vibrant! All right.

54
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,770
Excuse me.

55
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,205
All right.

56
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:46,779
This revolution I'm talking about
cannot happen without legislation.

57
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:51,136
So, it is for that reason that we're
going to allow a politician to speak.

58
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:57,517
All of us here should listen to him.

59
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:03,452
But if he lies if he
feeds us any sort of

60
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:07,761
self-serving political
crap, we will let him know!

61
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,983
Ladies and Gentlemen, Senator and former

62
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:16,243
Vice-Presidential nominee, Ed Muskie!

63
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,488
We're very excited about your book.

64
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,489
It's groundbreaking.

65
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,934
Part poetry, part philosophy.

66
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,046
Well, it speaks to this generation.

67
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,545
But we do need one more thing from you.

68
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,883
A title.

69
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:52,943
Ira?
- I don't believe in titles.

70
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:54,944
It immediately categorizes it.

71
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,970
I don't want the content compromised.

72
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,333
Well, doesn't the Library of
Congress decide on a number?

73
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:04,196
Sure.
- There's your title.

74
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,701
Let me get this straight:
You want to use a

75
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:09,775
Library of Congress number
as the title of your book?

76
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,908
Ira, where ya goin? Come on.
This is important.

77
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:18,909
So is this.

78
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,576
I was wondering how
long this would take him.

79
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,583
But he's already got a date with him.

80
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,584
Like that makes a difference with Ira.

81
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,469
I'm Ira.

82
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,267
Holly?
- Which is it?

83
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,794
Singing or dancing?
- Dancing.

84
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:38,994
How did you know?
- You're a Taurus.

85
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:41,815
You're all musical.
Brahms was a Taurus.

86
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:45,217
Hey, come on.
How did you know this?

87
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,917
It's a very complex psychic technique.

88
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:50,903
I've mastered the art
of reading upside down.

89
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,888
May I borrow your pen? I'm having lunch
with me editor over there.

90
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,245
Since he's paying, it'd be a little
rude to leave, so here's my number.

91
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:07,052
Call me sometime.

92
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,835
I'll do your chart for you.

93
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,950
Earth Day.

94
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,291
That's where I saw you last year.

95
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:23,072
You and the rest of the world.

96
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,111
Have you really read all those books?

97
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:36,034
Yup.
I read a book a day.

98
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:39,486
Excuse me.

99
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:42,640
Yeah, this is Ira.
- Hi.

100
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:45,371
This is Holly.
- Well, hi.

101
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,372
Hey can you hold on for a second?

102
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:51,038
I'd like you to have that book.
- Really?

103
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,559
I'd like you to go back to
your dorm, read it, and when

104
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,260
you're through, call me and
we'll discuss it. Okay? - Okay.

105
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:58,477
Bye-bye.

106
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:04,777
Hey.

107
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:06,824
I was hoping you'd call.

108
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:10,715
You're kind of a celebrity.

109
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:14,113
Celebrity helps my work.
- What is your work?

110
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:18,010
Enlightening the planet. - Well, I
thought maybe you were a housekeeper.

111
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,330
Your place is so much cleaner than mine.

112
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:24,146
Yeah, my mind doesn't
function well in chaos.

113
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,606
I need an orderly environment.

114
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,591
This is beautiful.
- It's me.

115
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,929
It's my underground name.
- Einhorn.

116
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,930
Ein: German for "one".

117
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:39,488
Horn: Self-explanatory.

118
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:42,062
One-horn.

119
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:44,569
Hence the Unicorn.

120
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,705
A mythical beast.

121
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,312
How appropriate.

122
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:53,276
You speak German?
- And Greek.

123
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,916
Spanish.
French.

124
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,917
I'm very impressed, Holly Maddux.

125
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:02,081
I figured if I learned a
lot of accents it would...

126
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:04,087
Help you get rid of your own?

127
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,235
Yeah.

128
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,683
When you were young, you'd sometimes
provoke family and friends, wouldn't ya?

129
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:15,763
Especially family.

130
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,579
Your skin is very sensitive.

131
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:23,955
Your innate sensuality frightens you.

132
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,604
You wish to be the object of love.

133
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,313
Isn't that a real generalization?

134
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:35,084
I mean, doesn't everyone?
- Yeah, but

135
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:38,761
we require unrestrained

136
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:44,228
Always unrequited

137
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:47,216
Unconditional love.

138
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,126
This is a real leap of faith
you're making here, Holly.

139
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,583
I mean, how long have
you known this guy?

140
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,401
Long enough.
You're right, Sheila.

141
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:11,019
A leap of faith.
That's exactly what it is.

142
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,509
Well you graduate in a month
and then you have to move out.

143
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:17,770
Why rush it?
- It just feels right.

144
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:21,079
That's all.
- And what do I say if your Dad calls?

145
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,529
Tell him I'm not there and
then call me right away.

146
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:28,139
You can talk all you want
about car-polluting the planet,

147
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,320
but when you want to move,
they sure come in handy.

148
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:33,216
I'll grant you that.
They do serve a purpose.

149
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:35,183
I don't know how the two of you are
going to fit into that apartment.

150
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:37,184
I made a few changes.

151
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:57,558
I gave 'em all away.
- Well.

152
00:12:58,005 --> 00:13:00,063
We'll start over again.

153
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:03,080
One book at a time.

154
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,378
I've never seen Ira so happy.

155
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,879
What's the matter?

156
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:13,907
It took him years to build up
that collection of books and then

157
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:16,878
he just gives them all away.
Doesn't that seem a bit obsessive?

158
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:20,689
Well, maybe he's in love.
Holly could finally be the one.

159
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,555
Ira? One woman?
She'd have to be pretty amazing.

160
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:26,556
At least this one has a brain.

161
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:29,218
Yeah, that's what scares me.

162
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:32,395
Well, you never know.
Maybe it'll work. - Bye-bye!

163
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,396
Such an optimist.

164
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:40,819
So is this new place nice?
- Yeah. It's great.

165
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,320
Safe neighborhood?
- Yes, Daddy. It's very safe.

166
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,790
Tell Buffy I'm making her
a special card for her birthday.

167
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,471
I'll do that, doodlebug.
I'll do that.

168
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:53,358
If you need anything, you call me.
- I will.

169
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:56,679
Bye, Daddy. Love to you all.
- Bye, honey.

170
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,345
So you didn't mention me.
- Not yet.

171
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:05,302
What?
He wouldn't approve?

172
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:11,253
No, they're a bit conservative.

173
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:17,984
Ira.
That's my journal.

174
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:21,169
Yes.
And some of its very good.

175
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,567
Please.
Don't ever do that.

176
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:25,556
I'm sorry.
- I mean it.

177
00:14:25,557 --> 00:14:27,579
It's private.
- I'm sorry.

178
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,435
It's just you're the first woman
I've ever really wanted to know.

179
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:38,104
It's something I've never
felt before and I just

180
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:40,169
want to know everything
about you, that's all.

181
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,694
Please forgive me.

182
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:46,559
I'll never even peek into
your journals ever again.

183
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:49,423
All right?

184
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,534
Yeah? You like that one?
It creeped me out a bit.

185
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,051
Really? - Yeah, a little bit, I...
- Hello, Ira.

186
00:15:57,067 --> 00:16:00,482
Evenin', George.
- I need your help.

187
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:05,956
These longhairs think they're tearin' down
my city, they got another thought comin'.

188
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:08,131
I'll make a look like a...

189
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:19,160
I don't either.
- They listen to you, talk to them.

190
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,437
Get them to keep it peaceful
and I'll keep´ the law from

191
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,833
turning this into a bloodbath, all right?
- Okay. I'll try.

192
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,849
Would somebody take Holly home?
- No.

193
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,459
Honey, it's going to be dangerous.
- No, I want to stay.

194
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Come on.

195
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,916
Okay, okay here.

196
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:54,718
This is not what it's about!

197
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:59,173
Please, please, be quiet! Please.

198
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:02,964
This is not what it's about people.
This is not revolution.

199
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:06,612
This is not peace.
You're burning buildings

200
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,728
Mindless destruction, the
blood of other human beings.

201
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:17,222
This is what we're fighting against!
Let's follow the principles of Gandhi

202
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,216
and Martin Luther King, not those of

203
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:23,131
Richard Nixon and Mayor Rizzo! Okay.

204
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,528
Wake up.
I want everybody to sit down.

205
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:30,529
C'mon, everybody sit down.

206
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,050
Okay, let's join hands.

207
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,141
Everybody join hands here.

208
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:44,128
Everybody joining hands over there?

209
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,732
We're all settled?
Now I want us to sit here

210
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,819
and peacefully

211
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,220
protest the atrocities in Vietnam.

212
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,620
"Amazing Grace,

213
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:09,198
how sweet the sound"

214
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,753
You can come in anytime you want.

215
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:16,318
"That saved a wretch

216
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:19,978
like me.

217
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:26,304
I once was lost

218
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:32,048
but now I'm found...

219
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:36,798
What's goin' on here?

220
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:45,138
Nothin', Mayor.

221
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:47,139
Nothin' at all.

222
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:51,984
Follow the bouncing ball,

223
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,559
I want this stinking
hippie out of my city.

224
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,663
I've been looking into some
pretty wild stuff lately.

225
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:11,083
Currently, I'm investigating
of paranormal powers

226
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:13,910
which will afford us huge insights
into the cellular consciousness.

227
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:18,860
Put it into English, Ira.
- Psychic Phenomena, Harry.

228
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:20,949
The power of the minds.

229
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,624
Channeled correctly, the mind can
emit enough energy to bend this spoon.

230
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,021
You got any proof of this?

231
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:30,879
That's the trouble with
journalists they always need proof.

232
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:35,116
I will have proof, Trevor, soon.
- Well, here it is.

233
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:37,304
It's totally organic, even the flour.

234
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,490
And I hope it's okay because
I've never done this before.

235
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:48,737
Hello?

236
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:51,981
Ira Einhorn? We have a search
warrant for this apartment.

237
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,358
So who sold you the pills?

238
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:02,755
Well. A pharmacy. You know
you guys are really on the ball.

239
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:07,371
You're arresting me for possessing a
legal drug prescribed for a kidney ailment.

240
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,452
Start telling the truth.

241
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:11,615
You got a problem, officer?

242
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:14,430
He's under arrest, lieutenant.
- I just heard about this, Ira.

243
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:17,400
Call the lab, George.
Call my doctor. It's legal.

244
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,401
All the charges were dropped.

245
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:21,544
In a nutshell, Ira Einhorn was arrested

246
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:23,748
for only one reason:
because he's Ira Einhorn.

247
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,765
Right.
All right.

248
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:32,765
First of all I'd like to
thank the City of Philadelphia

249
00:20:32,976 --> 00:20:35,261
for the lovely accommodations.

250
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:39,704
Secondly, I'd like to
take this opportunity to

251
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:42,713
announce my candidacy for
mayor of this great city.

252
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,937
My experience has
been and I pinch myself

253
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:50,134
now as the Department of
Energy as an Ensyme.

254
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:54,317
They send me their weekly bulletins
and it comes out: "Ira Einhorn Enzyme."

255
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,328
...part of an international
conspiracy to make the planet livable.

256
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,958
Now, if I may, with my remaining time

257
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,229
What is he doing?

258
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,115
If you had cut your hair, you
would have gotten more votes.

259
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,049
Get rid of that beard
and you'd be mayor today.

260
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:24,411
Hello, holly. - Hello, Mrs. Einhorn.
- I've told you before, it's Bea.

261
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:28,121
Call me Bea, here. I'll take the laundry.
You go get something to eat.

262
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:30,279
I just can't picture you as a jock.

263
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:33,249
Ira worked very hard for that.

264
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:36,037
He was so skinny as a boy.

265
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,495
He made us buy all
these weight-gain drinks.

266
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:41,281
Look, let's just change
the subject, shall we?

267
00:21:46,316 --> 00:21:48,443
He's the most fascinating
man I've ever met.

268
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,078
There's nobody like
him back there in Tyler.

269
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:54,207
Everybody that comes to
Philadelphia stops by for a visit.

270
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:56,464
Allan Ginsburg, the poet.

271
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,860
Abby Hoffman.
Jerry Rubin.

272
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,716
We write together.
We read constantly.

273
00:22:01,717 --> 00:22:03,717
Subjects I've never even thought about.

274
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,783
And probably never
would have without him.

275
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:08,595
He teaches at a thing
called the Free University

276
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:12,014
and his classes always in enrollment.

277
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,646
Politics. God. The War.
Sex.

278
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,686
Ira makes us think about all of them.

279
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,759
I feel like I'm back in school again.

280
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,458
I'm sorry about not making the family
camping trip, it's just too busy this year.

281
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,239
Love to you all, Holly.

282
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:34,455
In the 1980's, everybody's
going to have one of these.

283
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,730
Every home will have a computer.

284
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,915
These computers
will link together in a network

285
00:22:39,698 --> 00:22:41,698
Thank you.

286
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:48,450
Who's the guy in the two thousand
dollar suit? - That's Arthur Whitler.

287
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,938
He's the CEO of the Mid-Atlantic
Communications Company.

288
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:58,036
Whitler.
I thought I saw you out there.

289
00:22:58,037 --> 00:23:01,853
Hi. I'm Ira. - Yes.
Of course you are.

290
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:05,338
The problem is: how do you
get the information out there?

291
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,086
A network.
We phone them.

292
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,425
I have access to some of the
brightest people on the planet.

293
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:16,035
They send him articles, essays.
Really enlightening and important ideas.

294
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,787
So Ira has that and
you have a mailing list.

295
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:21,824
Stamps, envelopes, an office
full of Xerox machines.

296
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,670
What I was saying is:
it'd be a network, Arthur.

297
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,139
A network of ideas.

298
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,675
All this is it's
very interesting, Ira.

299
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,697
Careful with that.

300
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,362
Well, honey.

301
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:45,248
You be careful up there in Philadelphia.
- Don't worry.

302
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:47,305
All my girls always
tell me not to worry.

303
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:51,826
You be sure to tell Holly
she's welcome home anytime.

304
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:54,070
You tell her that?
And you?

305
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:56,071
You be careful with this package.

306
00:23:58,293 --> 00:24:00,293
Oh, you too.

307
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,811
What do ya think?

308
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:25,385
So, I got an extra mat for you.

309
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,579
Hope you don't mind
sleeping on the floor.

310
00:24:27,804 --> 00:24:29,860
No.
- Holly?

311
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:32,275
Where the hell you been?
I needed you here.

312
00:24:32,276 --> 00:24:34,431
I the files we're copying today

313
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:39,028
I was picking up Meg.

314
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,066
She's gonna stay with us for a few days.

315
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,621
Hi.
I'm Ira.

316
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:47,622
Hi.

317
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:51,741
You don't look like sisters.

318
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:54,037
Well, I look like Daddy.

319
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:58,162
Welcome to our home, Sister Meg.

320
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:08,017
She's asleep. - I don't care.
- Come on.

321
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:10,018
Ira, please don't.

322
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:12,403
Touch me then.

323
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:14,558
No.

324
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:19,622
Look, I'm sorry.

325
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:22,136
But I feel funny with
her in the same room.

326
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:24,725
I understand.

327
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,848
Where are you going?
- Out.

328
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,849
Come on.

329
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,827
It's all right.

330
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:39,961
Just be very quiet, okay?

331
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:49,093
So, Daddy's getting' downright liberal.

332
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:51,208
He let Mary go out on a date last week.

333
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:53,153
He never let me do that at her age.

334
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:56,017
Yeah, well. You were always the
groundbreaker, but

335
00:25:56,803 --> 00:26:00,512
But what? He still isn't liberal enough
to like my living arrangements,

336
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:03,070
is that what you're trying to say?
- Well, you know Daddy.

337
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:05,556
Yeah, I know Daddy.
Look, Meg.

338
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:07,557
I don't want to put you in an
awkward position or anything.

339
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,656
Oh, don't worry.
I won't say anything about it.

340
00:26:11,032 --> 00:26:13,032
Thanks.

341
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:18,422
Now this.
This would look great on you.

342
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,423
I'm not wearing used clothes.

343
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:23,168
Oh my God.
Now you're starting to sound like Daddy.

344
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,713
Holly?

345
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,730
Oh my God, are you okay?

346
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:52,506
I think I'm pregnant.

347
00:26:56,623 --> 00:27:00,051
What are ya gonna do?
Ya gonna get married?

348
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,260
You don't have to get
married anymore, Meg.

349
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:06,123
You do back in Tyler.
- Well, things are different here.

350
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,775
Things are just different.

351
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:17,498
You can't say anything about this.
- I won't.

352
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:20,883
Promise: not to anybody.
Especially Ira.

353
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,436
Why not?
- Because you can't.

354
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:26,437
I'll tell him when the time is right.

355
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:29,517
I will tell him.

356
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,416
Okay.

357
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:58,187
You know. - You think he was a vegetarian?
- He was devoutly Jewish

358
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:00,188
What about the fishes.

359
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:02,334
The fishes.

360
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,282
You see, that's what's happening today.

361
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:07,403
We're all struggling for some story.

362
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:10,471
Because you know, we're basically
trying to find it in myth.

363
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:13,058
A new story for us to that's
a really pretty sweater.

364
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:15,548
The joy of celebrity.

365
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,884
Ira?

366
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,885
Hey, take Holly home for me, will ya?

367
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:24,518
Ira, you can't do that to her.

368
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,761
She'll understand.
Don't worry about it.

369
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,731
See and that's what's happening
today, we're all struggling for

370
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:33,721
some story and that's the meaning
for what hat whole story is, man.

371
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:36,051
The reason why there's so
many wars in the world

372
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:18,062
So how was she?

373
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:22,355
Vacuous.

374
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,945
Come on in.

375
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:38,788
Why do you do this to me?

376
00:29:40,338 --> 00:29:42,338
I never lied to you, Holly.

377
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,715
You know I have the need
for another woman sometimes.

378
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:50,567
It's not something I'm proud
of, it's just the way I am.

379
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,708
And you've known this from the
very beginning, haven't you?

380
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:58,589
Haven't you?
- Yes.

381
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,590
Please, Holly.

382
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:06,217
I mean I love you but
I cannot be tied down.

383
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,007
I've been honest about this
from the day you moved in.

384
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:11,383
I'm pregnant.

385
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:24,193
Come here.

386
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:31,101
Sweetheart.

387
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,890
I'm so sorry.

388
00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:43,550
I'll arrange everything.

389
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:47,451
Arrange what? - We can't have a baby.
- I don't want to have an abortion.

390
00:30:47,452 --> 00:30:49,452
We're not ready for a baby, Holly.

391
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:53,627
But I love you.
I want us to start a family.

392
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:55,979
Holly, look.
Look at me.

393
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:59,695
We're not bringing a baby
into a world that's unlivable.

394
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:05,320
My work is trying to corrects
one of that but I can not

395
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,783
and will not have a child
until that work is finished.

396
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:15,511
All right?

397
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:19,983
We have to do this, Holly.

398
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,619
We have to.

399
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,148
Okay, Holly.

400
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:27,367
Put this gown on.
Will you please?

401
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:30,315
I'll be right with you.
Ira? You know the drill.

402
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:32,316
You've got an hour.

403
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:48,985
Dear Meg: Just a quick note to let
you know I took care of that problem.

404
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,202
I'm fine, so don't worry.

405
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:54,906
Well, what's your
sister got to say, Meg?

406
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:58,026
Oh, nothin' much.

407
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,552
What, Daddy?
- Somethin' wrong with your sister?

408
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,969
No.

409
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:19,214
You just sit there,
read Holly's letters,

410
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:21,711
laugh your head off and
read all the good parts.

411
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:27,947
But ever since you got back from
that place what is it, Meg?

412
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,513
It's a lot of things.

413
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:33,111
She doesn't look good and they
live in a ghetto, I swear

414
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,884
They?
She's livin' with this fellow isn't she?

415
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:40,992
Yeah.
Swore you to secrecy, right?

416
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,576
Well, Mom and I weren't born yesterday.

417
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:48,577
We figured it was something like this.

418
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:50,627
Can't say we approve.

419
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:55,421
Well, don't worry.

420
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:57,422
Your secret's safe with me.

421
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:08,316
I can buy this material in bulk.
I can do all sorts of things.

422
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:10,341
I can make dresses,
tablecloths, anything.

423
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:12,941
There's a real market for
this kind of stuff. - I know.

424
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:14,942
I just need a little start-up money.

425
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:18,815
Hello.
Hey, Daddy.

426
00:33:18,816 --> 00:33:22,627
I have no desire to go to Texas. - I haven't
seen 'em in so long and they were hurt

427
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:25,002
when I missed the family camping trip.
- I'm not stopping ya, Holly.

428
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,571
If you feel you have to do this, do it.
- They want to meet you.

429
00:33:28,572 --> 00:33:30,572
I want you to meet them.

430
00:33:32,603 --> 00:33:34,603
Look, this means a lot to me.

431
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:42,274
I don't ask you for much, do I?

432
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:49,022
Please?

433
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:21,675
Lord, I want to thank you for
the food we're about to eat

434
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,656
and for sendin' Holly
here to share it with us.

435
00:34:29,941 --> 00:34:31,941
Amen.

436
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:43,063
Ira.

437
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:45,439
I don't know, but you cut my hair.

438
00:34:50,107 --> 00:34:53,425
Hey, Holly?
Holly?

439
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,872
Ira, you've got to see this oh look

440
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:59,527
Holly?
I need you to brush my hair.

441
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:04,562
Look-it, that's me.

442
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,244
Holly?

443
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:14,141
I want you to brush my hair.

444
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,247
Okay.

445
00:35:20,774 --> 00:35:22,774
Holly.

446
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:32,122
Did you read my book, Frank?

447
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:34,502
Yep.

448
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:37,382
So what d'ya think?

449
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,051
Well, Ira, I'm not
really much on poetry.

450
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:47,001
Robert Frost is about as far as I go,
but I thought I should read it.

451
00:35:48,343 --> 00:35:51,561
I can see we have different tastes.

452
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:56,160
I don't think I've ever seen quite
a collection of books on Hitler.

453
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:00,132
World War Two had quite
an influence on me.

454
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,083
Most things do
when you're a teenager.

455
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,643
Saw an awful lot of evil, ugly things.

456
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,405
I guess I'm still trying
to figure some of it out.

457
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,583
You do realize
how offensive that is, I hope.

458
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:20,304
That flag. Yeah, well we
found that in a post office

459
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,669
in a little French village we liberated.

460
00:36:23,861 --> 00:36:25,998
They found it pretty offensive, too.

461
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,853
Of course, as a Jew,
I find it particularly.

462
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:32,444
Well, we had to defeat the
biggest anti-Semite of all time

463
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:35,669
and I'm proud to say, I
was a small part of it.

464
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,452
That flag reminds me of it every day.

465
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,590
It's just a souvenir.

466
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:46,122
That's all.

467
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:49,153
You wanna make more
of it, go right ahead.

468
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:52,755
This is a big charade, you know?

469
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,911
Forcing us into separate bedrooms.

470
00:36:58,814 --> 00:37:00,814
I'm old-fashioned.

471
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:05,478
Holly and I live together, you know?
We sleep together.

472
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:08,998
Ira, I have to fill
you in on a couple of things.

473
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:13,556
Just because we talk a little slow
down here, does not mean we are stupid.

474
00:37:15,846 --> 00:37:19,133
I think you're the most ill-mannered
man I have ever met in my life.

475
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,269
And I know you're an intelligent fella.

476
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:25,293
And you probably can turn on
the charm any time you want.

477
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:31,365
You just came here into my
house and you chose not to.

478
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:38,787
I know that you want me to make
a big scene, probably want me to

479
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:43,536
throw you out of the house you wanna
drive a wedge between Holly and us.

480
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,682
I don't like you.

481
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:52,230
And I really don't like the
way you treat my daughter.

482
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:57,956
But you're a guest in my house
and I'm gonna be civil with ya.

483
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:00,813
For Holly's sake.

484
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:05,336
I don't want Holly to
have to choose between us.

485
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:07,337
I'm not gonna put her through that.

486
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:11,559
So you can be as obnoxious
and condescending as you want

487
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:15,556
I'll deal with it.

488
00:38:20,897 --> 00:38:22,897
Well, I got something for you, Holly.

489
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:25,138
Here.

490
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,837
It's
handmade.

491
00:38:30,136 --> 00:38:33,594
All your sisters got one.
I wanted to give it to you personally.

492
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:35,672
Oh, Daddy, I can't.

493
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:38,375
Oh, honey, sure you can.

494
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,016
It's beautiful, honest it is, but

495
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:45,234
He wouldn't approve of it, though.

496
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:48,642
Just hold it for me, will you?

497
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,702
All right, honey.
All right.

498
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:53,576
When you want your present,
you call me all right?

499
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:58,529
Call me.
- You're not interested in my...

500
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,353
Your first book, it sold.
- It sold. - Two thousand copies, Ira.

501
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:04,354
That's it.

502
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:07,892
Look.
I don't need a big advance.

503
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:10,453
I just need something
to, you know, hold me over.

504
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:14,159
You know what, champ?
Your stuffs just too out there.

505
00:39:15,093 --> 00:39:17,899
Who are you? Look, I don't
have to explain anything

506
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,219
to you! Look! Don't
hang up on me, please.

507
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,366
Don't hang up.
My phone is essential to my...

508
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,415
We need money.

509
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:37,240
Ira. No. Please.
- What?

510
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,241
You'd be great at this.

511
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:42,631
I'll get a job.
- Not making this kind of money.

512
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,432
Come on. It'll be good for you,
Holly. It'll be good for us.

513
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:47,433
It'll liberate ya.

514
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:51,216
Make you explore your sensuality,
make you less inhibited.

515
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:56,687
Holly, look.

516
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,090
The work we're doing is so important.

517
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,731
Does it really have to stop because
of something so mundane as money?

518
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:15,551
Nervous?
- No.

519
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,894
Mr. Geller. Thank you.
We've seen some amazing

520
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,203
examples of psychic
phenomenon here today.

521
00:42:28,273 --> 00:42:30,694
I'd also like to thank
Dr. Poharak and the man

522
00:42:30,764 --> 00:42:33,903
who arranged all this
for us today, Ira Einhorn.

523
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Your water, sir.

524
00:42:41,985 --> 00:42:43,985
Thank you.

525
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:53,657
You don't drink?
- Glass of wine, occasionally.

526
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:56,618
That's it?
- A little pot.

527
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:58,619
For mind-expanding purposes only.

528
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:01,189
My LSD days went out in the sixties.

529
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:04,403
Why do you ask?
- Oh, I'm just curious.

530
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:07,077
Hi. I'm Ira.
- Yes, I know.

531
00:43:07,078 --> 00:43:09,078
Barbara Bronfman.

532
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:12,642
You honestly believe the CIA's
experimenting with this sort of thing?

533
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:16,770
Absolutely.
Along with the Defense Department.

534
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,326
You see what Geller was doing today?
- Amazing.

535
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:21,327
What better radar than the human radar?

536
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:24,724
See, we're gathering proof that
both the CIA and the Russians

537
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,816
are developing this psychic ability in
people to make them into human weapons.

538
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:32,947
I don't mean to interrupt
but we should get going.

539
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,028
It's getting late.

540
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,813
Would you excuse me?
- Of course.

541
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:43,584
Holly.
You ever heard of Seagram's Whiskey?

542
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:47,108
Sure.
- Well, that woman is Barbara Bronfman.

543
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:49,151
She is Seagram's Whiskey.

544
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:51,388
She's the richest woman in Canada.

545
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:53,413
And she's interested in my work.

546
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,041
Well, I'd like to talk to her.
- Well, what are you going to talk about?

547
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:59,042
Stripping?

548
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:02,306
Go hang out.

549
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:11,763
You know, Arthur. Your labs should
investigate Geller's power.

550
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,025
There could be some
groundbreaking stuff here.

551
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:16,263
A little too groundbreaking.

552
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:18,820
Look, Ira.

553
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:21,639
It might be a good idea to be careful
about some of the things you're saying.

554
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:24,648
About the CIA?
Defense Department stuff?

555
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:28,111
Those people don't have a sense of humor.
You could be making some powerful enemies.

556
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:30,433
Don't worry about me, Arthur.

557
00:44:33,656 --> 00:44:35,656
I'm also making some powerful friends.

558
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:37,993
Holly?
It's unbelievable.

559
00:44:37,994 --> 00:44:40,893
I mean, Poharak wants me to come up to
his farm, this summer and help him with

560
00:44:40,972 --> 00:44:45,140
his experiments on mind control and the
Bronfmans have asked me up to Canada.

561
00:44:45,403 --> 00:44:47,966
It's great!
- What about me?

562
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:50,573
You keep saying they want you
to come up there. - What about me?

563
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:52,957
Holly. We're experimenting
with psychic phenomenon

564
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,958
that is someday going
to effect all of us.

565
00:44:55,644 --> 00:44:57,644
I want you there with me.

566
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,005
All right?
- Maybe you should go by yourself.

567
00:45:01,006 --> 00:45:04,123
What?
I can't go there without you.

568
00:45:04,124 --> 00:45:06,124
You'll find another woman.

569
00:45:12,783 --> 00:45:14,783
I'm sorry.

570
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:20,104
You scared me.
- Then don't provoke me.

571
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:25,284
Honey.

572
00:45:31,671 --> 00:45:33,671
How many times do I have to tell you?

573
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:38,174
I need you.
Come with me, please.

574
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,750
Don't say things like that.

575
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:09,447
Hey hey!

576
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:12,958
Ira.
We are going to have such a time.

577
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:15,882
I made you some bread.
Raisin bread.

578
00:46:15,883 --> 00:46:18,276
Thank you...
- Holly. - Holly.

579
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:21,521
Poharak is here and
some psychic phenomenon

580
00:46:21,522 --> 00:46:23,809
experts from Europe.
- Perfect.

581
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:28,229
The signs are all obvious, yet, we sit as
if paralyzed at the edge of the millennium.

582
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:31,574
Waiting.
The darkness of the past looms.

583
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:35,414
He sensed the mark of the future
is being carved deep in his bones.

584
00:46:36,357 --> 00:46:38,598
Since that time, he has
slowly been exploring

585
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:41,250
the realm of the mythological mother.

586
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:46,645
Hello.
What are you drawing?

587
00:46:46,646 --> 00:46:48,646
Nothing.

588
00:46:48,857 --> 00:46:50,827
You're missing the lecture.

589
00:46:50,828 --> 00:46:53,098
I have no idea what they're
talking about half of the time.

590
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:55,809
I have a feeling some of
them aren't even too sure.

591
00:46:57,326 --> 00:46:59,326
Then why are you here?

592
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,960
I was bored this weekend.

593
00:47:02,098 --> 00:47:04,689
Don't let me interrupt you.
- No. It's okay.

594
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,690
Sit down if you want.

595
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:15,570
I'm Saul.
Saul Lapides.

596
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:17,571
Holly Maddux.

597
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:26,780
So I sold the business and I've just been
sorta bummin' around on my boat ever since.

598
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:31,177
I've got it docked at Fire Island.
Have you ever been there? - No.

599
00:47:31,178 --> 00:47:33,178
I'd love to take you out on it sometime.

600
00:47:34,623 --> 00:47:37,876
I live with someone.
- Yeah, I know.

601
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:39,877
Ira.

602
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:43,981
We'd better get back.
- Wait.

603
00:47:43,982 --> 00:47:45,982
Could I see your drawings?

604
00:47:46,494 --> 00:47:48,400
No.
They're no good.

605
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:50,401
Please.

606
00:48:01,183 --> 00:48:04,715
It's beautiful.
- No. It's crude.

607
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,731
There's no style.
- It's lovely.

608
00:48:09,788 --> 00:48:11,788
It's fragile.

609
00:48:14,146 --> 00:48:16,146
The life energy never leaves.

610
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:19,004
It is here with us, no?

611
00:48:20,286 --> 00:48:22,286
Open yourself to it.

612
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,603
Open your self.

613
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:28,708
Think about a safe haven.

614
00:48:30,395 --> 00:48:35,365
Make the body safe
place to look inward.

615
00:48:35,757 --> 00:48:38,096
Look inside.

616
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Your self.

617
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,080
I see something.

618
00:48:46,497 --> 00:48:49,169
It's a girl.
I see a girl.

619
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,270
A girl.

620
00:48:51,546 --> 00:48:53,546
What else?

621
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:57,134
It's nothing.
It's not important.

622
00:48:57,135 --> 00:49:00,853
Tell us, what did you see?
- Don't encourage her...

623
00:49:06,336 --> 00:49:08,336
It's a little girl.

624
00:49:09,853 --> 00:49:12,623
She's frightened.
Very frightened.

625
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:16,377
Because she's learning to ride a bike.

626
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:21,575
It's a two-wheeler and it's her
first time but she's doing it

627
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:24,636
and she leaves the person who's
holding her and she starts to

628
00:49:25,317 --> 00:49:27,317
Starts to what?

629
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,140
A little girl on a bicycle?

630
00:49:32,023 --> 00:49:35,997
Look. It's obvious Holly isn't
sophisticated enough to distinguish

631
00:49:36,068 --> 00:49:38,757
between true, psychic energy
and her own, little imagination.

632
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:41,842
Just shut up and listen, honey.

633
00:49:45,936 --> 00:49:48,041
You know? What that woman has
to say is every bit as important

634
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:51,073
as anything the great
Ira Einhorn has to say.

635
00:49:52,118 --> 00:49:54,118
You don't understand
our relationship, Saul.

636
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,852
Holly.

637
00:50:14,853 --> 00:50:16,853
I'm sorry.

638
00:50:17,502 --> 00:50:19,916
I don't know what got
into me. It's just,

639
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,618
you see, sometimes I
don't think you understand

640
00:50:22,668 --> 00:50:25,166
how important this is
to me and to my work.

641
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:30,342
If I hurt you it's because,
well I want you to grow.

642
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:35,202
Look.
I know I'm a little rough sometimes.

643
00:50:36,773 --> 00:50:38,681
You know, sometimes it just...

644
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:41,518
I lose my patience and...

645
00:50:43,027 --> 00:50:45,941
well, look.
I'm sorry.

646
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,942
Will you forgive me.

647
00:50:49,743 --> 00:50:51,743
Holly.

648
00:50:53,504 --> 00:50:55,504
Holly?

649
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:03,162
Holly?

650
00:51:14,015 --> 00:51:17,540
Daddy?
Thanks for sending me the money.

651
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:19,654
Worth every cent.

652
00:51:21,718 --> 00:51:24,805
She's done her little
disappearing act before,

653
00:51:24,806 --> 00:51:26,972
but never more than a day or so.

654
00:51:27,443 --> 00:51:29,443
Why don't you call her parents?

655
00:51:29,911 --> 00:51:31,855
They hate me!

656
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:34,072
No one hates you, Ira.
- Look.

657
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:37,813
The father's a Nazi. They're trying to
pull her away from me. I can feel it.

658
00:51:37,814 --> 00:51:39,990
You're not going to know
anything until you call.

659
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:54,936
I'll get that.
It's probably one of Mary's boyfriends.

660
00:52:00,547 --> 00:52:02,547
Hello?

661
00:52:04,408 --> 00:52:06,408
One minute.

662
00:52:07,397 --> 00:52:10,183
Holly?
It's him.

663
00:52:10,184 --> 00:52:12,184
King of the Piggies.

664
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:14,641
Don't be like that.

665
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,807
Daddy... - I'm not lyin' for you and I'm
not gonna do your dirty work.

666
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:21,481
Now you've gonna get some
backbone, talk to him. Tell him.

667
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:32,121
Go on.

668
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,535
I don't want to talk to you, Ira.

669
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:44,546
No.
Please, don't.

670
00:52:45,134 --> 00:52:47,134
No.

671
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:49,249
Not after the way you've treated me.

672
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,559
Goodbye, Ira.

673
00:52:56,829 --> 00:52:58,829
Don't call here again.

674
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,075
I mean it.

675
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:06,244
Way to go, Holly! Yeah!

676
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,674
I see.

677
00:53:09,675 --> 00:53:11,808
You got a degree from
one of the best colleges

678
00:53:11,999 --> 00:53:14,005
in the country and you
want to make dresses?

679
00:53:14,717 --> 00:53:17,022
My dresses and my designs.

680
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:20,581
I need to do something on my own.
Something I can take some pride in and then

681
00:53:20,582 --> 00:53:22,587
And then, you can go back to him.

682
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,909
Go back there, Meg.
Whether Ira's a part of it or not.

683
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,884
I can't stay here.

684
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:30,885
I don't belong here.

685
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:37,565
I miss you.

686
00:53:37,566 --> 00:53:41,246
I love you and the hurts I know
I've heaped upon you, pain me too.

687
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:44,785
And I feel so stupid for
doing it, for you were

688
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:47,988
soft and lovely and I want
you to just be with me.

689
00:53:49,548 --> 00:53:51,548
The rest are distractions, Holly.

690
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:54,350
They do not allow me the
constant focus I need.

691
00:53:55,835 --> 00:53:57,835
Please come back to me, Holly, please.

692
00:53:58,472 --> 00:54:00,838
I will share you work
and you can share mine.

693
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,959
Please.

694
00:54:04,698 --> 00:54:06,873
Feed my being with your very presence.

695
00:54:24,475 --> 00:54:27,933
Well, I've been back for six weeks,
and so far here, things are better.

696
00:54:28,305 --> 00:54:30,305
Repeat: so far.

697
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,775
Ira's been incredibly
considerate and supportive.

698
00:54:33,377 --> 00:54:36,785
I've started to make my dresses
and working in our local food co-op.

699
00:54:37,226 --> 00:54:39,471
I've even been selling
some of my baked goods.

700
00:54:39,762 --> 00:54:43,285
All organic, of course.
You'd probably hate them, daddy.

701
00:54:43,502 --> 00:54:45,706
I know you were worried
last time, but don't be.

702
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:48,214
Content and busy and
plan to stay that way.

703
00:54:49,306 --> 00:54:51,306
Sounds good, doesn't she?

704
00:54:53,746 --> 00:54:56,698
In a few years, Holly,
this will all be obsolete.

705
00:54:56,784 --> 00:54:59,270
Just hit a button on
a computer and all the

706
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,687
research material you need will
be aright at your fingertips.

707
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,341
Rita?

708
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:08,542
Oh God. - How are you?
God, I thought you moved away.

709
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:12,824
Don't touch me! Don't come near me,
you son of a bitch! It's just like

710
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:15,639
What?
- Do you hear me, you bastard?

711
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,640
Don't you ever touch me!

712
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:28,137
It's on sale.
