00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:34,986
And now, o Greatest of the Great,

57

58
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:42,207

This low-born cobbler of no worth

69
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,943
Attacked me in the square, today

70
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,382
Shall we take his head away?

71
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:47,637
What?

72
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:48,817
No...

73
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:52,383
Yes, Zigzag, if really think so.

74
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,669
But what has he done?

75
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:57,176
Attacked me!

76
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:58,646
Really?

77
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:59,880

And now, she has no need of you,

107
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:40,413
we'll put you in a cell.

161

163
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:59,255

165
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,850
And with her, my royal bride,

166
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:14,332
I'll rule in public sight,

167
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:17,706
with Princess Yumyum at my side.

168
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:21,972
The crown is mine by right!

169
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:23,815
Eh, Fido?

170
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:44,193

will have to wait.

189
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:36,411
Coming, Your Majesty,  coming!

190
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,442
Oh Great King Nod, have no fear!

191
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,794
Zigzag, your Grand Vizir is here

192
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:06,576
Death and destruction, Zigzag

193
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:11,916
My kingdom will come to
destruction and death.

194
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:14,693
Calm, Serene Highness.

195
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:16,904
You must catch your breath

196
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:19,179
What dawn of disaster?

197
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:22,838
Why speak you of death?

198
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:25,654
A nightmare... no, a vision!

199
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,466
A vision of invasion!

200
00:32:55,678 --> 00:32:59,569
An entire race of one eyed men!

201
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:03,271
And death... death, everywhere.

202
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:06,818
Excellent Majesty, Ruler Supreme!

203
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,232
I can safely assure you

204
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,861
a dream's just a dream.

205
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,350
I saw it, I tell you!

206
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:43,054
Calm down, Your Highness.

207
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:46,588
Invaders?! One-eyed?!

208
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:50,433
But, this is against what has been profecied.

209
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:54,904
For, has it not been written,
we are safe from any threat.

210
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:59,716
as long as those three golden
balls are on the minaret?

211
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:27,602
Aah! What if the balls are taken away?

212
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,597
A way has never been found

213
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:32,962
to take them away.

214
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:34,661
What freak of nature

215
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:38,048
could ever get up to the
top of that minaret?

216
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:31,443
*Sangre! Fire!

217
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,318
-Catastrofe! Calamity!
-Oh my dear!

218
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:37,208
Such things could never happen here

219
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,525
Such things have never occurred here.

220
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,158
Well, they haven't happened yet!

221
00:35:43,263 --> 00:35:45,138
Oh, can't you see?

222
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:49,416
The golden balls are
safe atop the minaret!

223
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:46,481
I - I just...

224
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:50,906
have this funny feeling.

225
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:44,072
It's not time to get up, too early to arise,

226
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:48,645
too early to open the King's sleepy eyes.

227
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,505
Wait, wait father!

228
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,888
Something's happening!

229
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:07,761
Is this the opportunity ringing?

230
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:13,153
I thunk there are some balls,
you should be bringing.

231
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:19,255
Get those balls. Keep out of sight.

232
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:23,060
Bring them to me late tonight.

233
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:41,185
Who won?

234
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,343
Won?

235
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:58,443
One... eye...

236
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:01,130
Won?!... I?

237
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,178

238
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,044

239
00:42:06,632 --> 00:42:07,505
Aye?!

240
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:10,033
One eye!!!

241
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:17,802
Alla barad!

242
00:42:19,138 --> 00:42:22,240
The balls are gone!

243
00:42:22,895 --> 00:42:27,021
My kingdom will come to
destruction and death!

244
00:42:42,431 --> 00:42:46,366
My loyal generals!

245
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:50,906
My brave soldiers!

246
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:56,215
The three golden
balls have gone!

247
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:04,497
Our city faces invasion!

248
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:11,548
The mighty One Eye is coming

249
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:17,124
Take up your positions!

250
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:20,771
With my blessing.

251
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:24,576
<i>Long live King Nod!</i>

252
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:28,178
<i>Long live King Nod!</i>

253
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,311
Nanny, where could my cobbler be?

254
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:49,824
Try the prision.

255
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:52,418
What? Oh, no!

256
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,333
What goes on in this palace?

257
00:43:55,506 --> 00:43:58,084
<i>Ah, lovely balls!</i>

258
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,568
<i>Use the door you idiot!</i>

259
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:19,099
Oh, I see who jailed you.

260
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,169
Get away, bird of evil!

261
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:28,482
Get back to your master's tower!

262
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:38,786
Gone!...

263
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:47,433
Thief! Thief!

264
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:55,625
Thief! Thief!

265
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:11,303
Gentlemen, gentlemen! What a delight!

266
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:21,288
We'll let this be our little secret...

267
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,154
All right?

268
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,945
I'll rule the land, after one little thing.

269
00:47:37,218 --> 00:47:39,941
Now that I have the balls,

270
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:42,668
I will go see the king

271
00:47:47,121 --> 00:47:49,927
Have no fear, Zigzag, your Gran...

272
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:54,128
You're here, Zigzag, but where are the balls?

273
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:56,544
Magicked away, my Lord.

274
00:47:56,616 --> 00:47:58,739
Magicked away?!

275
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:01,588
Oh, no...

276
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:04,924
Oh, you mustn't look so tragic.

277
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:08,703
I am not unschooled in magic.

278
00:48:09,098 --> 00:48:11,177
You mean... you?!

279
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,216
Alakazam!

280
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,099
Observe!

281
00:48:18,164 --> 00:48:20,117
Look at that!

282
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:24,396
There's something...

283
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:30,411
You see, I can restore you the gold balls,
though they be lost.

284
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:33,802
I'll give you anything, Zigzag
Just do it!

285
00:48:33,904 --> 00:48:36,080
As my peril will be dire,

286
00:48:36,187 --> 00:48:39,200
you must grant my heart's desire.

287
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,575
Which is?

288
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:42,957
I require, Sire,

289
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:47,941
your daughter Yumyum, to wed.

290
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:53,669
You... want my daughter?!

291
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,760
Never!

292
00:48:57,005 --> 00:48:58,105
Never?

293
00:48:58,137 --> 00:49:00,927
Never, ever!

294
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:05,847
Get out! Ouuuut!

295
00:49:05,937 --> 00:49:08,617
Well, I just thought I'd ask.

296
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:16,207
We'll see who wins at the end of the day!

297
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:18,722
We'll see who ends up grieving!

298
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:21,655
I'll go to One Eye, right away.

299
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,952
I'm taking my balls and leaving!

300
00:49:33,716 --> 00:49:36,889

There is a mad and holy old witch

314

who dwells at the top
of the desert mountain.

315

At the foot of the desert mountain...

320
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:30,971
is a golden idol, with a priceless
ruby set in its forehead.

321
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,940
When the desert sun is directly overhead,

322
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:38,951

falls upon a hidden door

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,717
Keep your heads down

374
00:54:23,116 --> 00:54:25,166
Haaalt!

375
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:59,368
Who are you?

376
00:54:59,692 --> 00:55:05,293
Well... er...I am Roofless The chieftain!

377
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,980
Abd this sd my band of bigands

378
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:15,529
We are the scourge of the counrysidel

379
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:20,823
I am the Princess Yumyum -

380
00:55:21,265 --> 00:55:24,105
daughter of your King

381
00:55:24,982 --> 00:55:27,349
And that's my nurse, you're sitting on.

382
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:29,443
Eh,

383
00:55:29,747 --> 00:55:32,286
You're a disgrace to your profession!

384
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:34,693
Just look at you!

385
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:37,998
Look at the state of your shoes!

386
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:42,872
Well things have not been too good lately.
Like, no, I mean...

387
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:47,154
In fact this is the first caravan we've
seen for thirty years, innit boys?

388
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,786
- That's true.
-Well. we is doing our best

389
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,169
Your country is in great danger.

390
00:55:54,413 --> 00:55:57,958
I hereby declare you my Royal Guard.

391
00:55:58,443 --> 00:56:00,677
Umm, Royal Guardl, boys!

392
00:56:00,872 --> 00:56:04,777
You will accompany us
on our perilous journey

393
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:07,441
to save our golden land!

394
00:56:13,654 --> 00:56:17,144
The camp of the One Eyes,
how very nice!

395
00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:22,973
Perhaps they'll be willing
to pay my price.

396
00:56:25,702 --> 00:56:29,129
I'll have these barbarians
kissing my feet.

397
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:33,292
And maybe we'll find you
something to eat.

398
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,433
Eh, Fido?

399
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:40,829
Gentlemen, gentlemen, what a delight!

400
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:44,798
To meet you all here
on such a fine night.

401
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:14,837
Throne!

402
00:57:27,252 --> 00:57:28,252
Fido!

403
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:33,159
Who dares enter the camp
of The Mighty One Eye?

404
00:57:33,347 --> 00:57:37,208
Oh, Mighty One Eye!

405
00:57:37,466 --> 00:57:44,080
I... I... I am Zigzag the Greato
of the golden land.

406
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:45,706
And ?...

407
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:49,415
I am a magician -- sorcerer too.

408
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:53,799
And I'm in a position,
I think, to serve you.

409
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:56,246
Sorcerer?

410
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:04,716
I conjure demons,

411
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:08,089
charm beasts,

412
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:12,878
and birds of prey too.

413
00:58:13,135 --> 00:58:14,785
Fido!

414
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:28,569
As you will see, that's not all I can do.

415
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:32,940
Haha!

416
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:40,718
I have power over people,

417
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:43,710
though they may appear complex

418
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:49,013
for me, they fall like playing cards.

419
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,298
And I control the deck!

420
00:59:00,134 --> 00:59:02,654
But all this is nothing,

421
00:59:02,836 --> 00:59:05,936
for, now, in my hand

422
00:59:06,072 --> 00:59:11,022
is the very key to the golden land!

423
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,976
For, no man can take it, no matter how great

424
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:20,064
unless he possesses...

425
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,911
these three balls of fate!

426
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:34,613
You say you can charm beasts?

427
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:45,494
Throw him to the alligators!

428
01:01:12,404 --> 01:01:14,123
What's that?

429
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:17,592
Now, what is it?...

430
01:01:20,858 --> 01:01:22,640
Lo, and behold!

431
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,857
My friends...

432
01:01:33,454 --> 01:01:39,061
it grieves me to see
you fed on persons like me,

433
01:01:39,272 --> 01:01:41,075
with no meat.

434
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:46,339
Just help me a little and I won't foget

435
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:50,786
to feed you each day a surprise

436
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:56,496
that is plump, portly, paunchy and fat!

437
01:01:57,642 --> 01:01:59,868
Faaaat!

438
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:29,532
Magic! 'Tis magic!

439
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:35,935
Princess, perhaps me and my men
ought to be staying here.

440
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:39,255
Yes, Roofless, you stay here.

441
01:02:39,396 --> 01:02:42,076
Guard the exit, we're going up.

442
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,013
'Tis magic from another world.

443
01:04:04,338 --> 01:04:06,338
My friends.

444
01:04:06,891 --> 01:04:08,938
My friends!

445
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:32,314
Careful, Tack!

446
01:05:12,296 --> 01:05:15,536
Oh, Tack, I knew you'd get us here!

447
01:06:53,348 --> 01:06:56,247
Giant bird! Giant bird!

448
01:07:15,222 --> 01:07:18,262
Oh, mad and holy old witch,

449
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:23,825
I am Princess Yumyum
of the Golden City.

450
01:07:23,935 --> 01:07:25,154
Meh!

451
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,567
Our Golden City is going to be under attack.

452
01:07:28,807 --> 01:07:33,094
My father says you can tell us
how we can save our city.

453
01:07:33,305 --> 01:07:34,501
Hmm!

454
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,258
We'll pay.

455
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:41,904
Ok. Everyone, here,
who can save your city?

456
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:46,154
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo!

457
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:47,810
Tack?!

458
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:50,411
Can Tack save our city?

459
01:07:51,748 --> 01:07:54,201
Aaah, aaa!

460
01:07:57,624 --> 01:07:59,366
Hmph! Ga!

461
01:08:06,975 --> 01:08:09,271
Mnyk mnyo, mm!

462
01:08:09,787 --> 01:08:11,170
Hmmm!

463
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:16,658
Aaha!

464
01:08:30,901 --> 01:08:33,241
He's got a big heart.

465
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,500
Tack, how do you feel about it?

466
01:08:38,454 --> 01:08:40,067
Money in front!

467
01:08:51,636 --> 01:09:00,222
Aaah! For you, I will make special price!

468
01:09:01,412 --> 01:09:06,802
And take a special trip!

469
01:10:14,968 --> 01:10:18,721
Mystic mood!

470
01:10:21,546 --> 01:10:24,264
Show me the way,

471
01:10:24,505 --> 01:10:29,482
show me how this curse to lay

472
01:10:51,215 --> 01:10:53,638
Match... match!

473
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:10,394
Attack...

474
01:11:10,815 --> 01:11:12,314
a tack.

475
01:11:13,678 --> 01:11:15,013
Hah!

476
01:11:16,036 --> 01:11:17,342
A tack.

477
01:11:18,177 --> 01:11:19,427
See?

478
01:11:19,545 --> 01:11:24,427
But it's what you do
with what you got!

479
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,084
Go home!

480
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:33,748
Noooowww!...

481
01:11:56,665 --> 01:12:00,314
Faster! Faster! Faster!

482
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,083
Take me to your master!

483
01:12:07,588 --> 01:12:10,660
One mistake will suffice.

484
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,972
Don't treat me lightly twice.

485
01:12:14,323 --> 01:12:16,403
Take me to your master!

486
01:12:23,035 --> 01:12:26,402
Gentlemen, we must return at once!

487
01:12:26,481 --> 01:12:30,591
Your Majesty, if there's one thing myself and my men are good at...

488
01:12:30,823 --> 01:12:32,036
Good at ?

489
01:12:32,134 --> 01:12:35,747
We're good at making our getaway!

490
01:12:35,828 --> 01:12:37,328
We're good at running.

491
01:12:37,415 --> 01:12:39,116
- Away!
- Away!

492
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:43,013
Banzai!

493
01:12:50,976 --> 01:12:53,376
Get set, GO!!

494
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,177
Now, shall we slaughter?

495
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:03,649
Except for the Princess,
that, we agreed.

496
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:08,707
She is the price for my traitorous deed.

497
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:13,651
Their soldiers will cower behind these walls

498
01:13:13,773 --> 01:13:18,013
when they see that we have
the three golden balls.

499
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:22,204
Tomorrow... I strike!

500
01:13:23,474 --> 01:13:27,933
And you shall ride at the front...

501
01:13:28,573 --> 01:13:31,364
sorcerer.

502
01:13:33,407 --> 01:13:36,216
Take the right flank!  You, the left flank!

503
01:13:36,296 --> 01:13:37,497
Turret gate!

504
01:13:37,598 --> 01:13:40,005
Doorman, you take the
women and children!

505
01:13:40,195 --> 01:13:41,879
Ready the physicians!

506
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:47,376
Faster, faster, you fools!
Fasterrrrr!

507
01:15:03,588 --> 01:15:09,078
This is One Eye magic, sorcerer!

508
01:15:17,181 --> 01:15:19,272
It must be the One Eyes!

509
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:21,800
Move it, boys!

510
01:15:22,371 --> 01:15:28,403
One Eyes, attaaaaack!

511
01:16:32,261 --> 01:16:35,211
Oh, my God, my daughter!

512
01:16:35,673 --> 01:16:37,390
My daughter!

513
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:40,382
My daughter! Oh, my God!

514
01:16:40,655 --> 01:16:42,041
My child!

515
01:16:42,802 --> 01:16:44,075
Help me!

516
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,718
Help me, to help her!

517
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:19,072
Tack, please, no!

518
01:17:24,971 --> 01:17:26,473
Oh, Tack!

519
01:17:33,442 --> 01:17:35,172
Hmph, the cobbler!

520
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:23,265
Taaack!

521
01:20:28,576 --> 01:20:31,803
Oh, Tack, my wonderful cobbler!

522
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,576
Tack! Taaack!

523
01:23:05,593 --> 01:23:06,851
Taaack!

524
01:30:13,983 --> 01:30:19,303
The greatest wizard has to know,
exactly when it's time to GO !!

525
01:30:23,577 --> 01:30:29,130
My friends, my friends, are you still here?

526
01:30:29,347 --> 01:30:32,200
I haven't fed you yet, I fear.

527
01:31:03,529 --> 01:31:06,824
Oh, my bottom! Oh, my top!

528
01:31:06,957 --> 01:31:09,582
Greedies, don't you ever stop?!

529
01:31:11,064 --> 01:31:16,824
You too, Fido? Man's best friend?!

530
01:31:17,179 --> 01:31:22,789
For Zigzag, then, it is the end.

531
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:46,820
Oh, my God!

532
01:32:31,957 --> 01:32:33,957
Oh, Tack, my cobbler!

533
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:38,361
My daughter! My wonderful daughter!

534
01:32:51,346 --> 01:32:54,492
The prophecy is fulfilled!

535
01:32:55,264 --> 01:32:59,317
The city owes you a great debt of gratitude

536
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:03,245
Oh, cobbler, how can we ever repay you?

537
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:04,795
Father...

538
01:33:06,443 --> 01:33:07,803
Oh!

539
01:33:18,889 --> 01:33:20,389
I love you.

540
01:33:21,466 --> 01:33:23,957
I love you.
