1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:03,670
Submarine 4 to headquarters. The situation gets worse.

2
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,420
D'Angelo, Marks, talk to me.

3
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,490
We move to the separation room.

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,430
So far only 9 rescue.

5
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,330
It's very messy here, man. This is the worst I've ever seen.

6
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,360
Please!

7
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,270
Please.

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,400
Somebody help me.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,240
Please!

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,400
Who is there?

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,340
Are you the only one who survived there? We're going to the rescue ship now.

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,220
D'Angelo, what was that?

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,420
I do not know.

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,520
Hear.

15
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,370
Jonas, there is something else on the boat.

16
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,240
There is something out there.

17
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,480
Are you okay, friend?

18
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,320
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,420
Something hit the palkanya.

20
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,490
Return to the rescue ship, now.

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,430
We are there now.

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,240
Lift him up.

23
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,430
Marks. - D'Angelo, we have entered.

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,370
You almost arrived.

25
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,500
Jonas, listen to me, we're stuck.

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,410
What? - Close the pan.

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,510
I will be back.

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,510
Not enough air.

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,390
Marks! / Jonas, you have to leave here before it's too late.

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,220
The stomach is leaking.

31
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,350
There is water everywhere.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,420
Jonas, things will get worse.

33
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,400
You have to close the line so you can get out of here. Come on Jonas.

34
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,300
Go away from here. Don't waste time anymore.

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,240
Go, hurry! - There is no more time!

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,410
Boss, are you crazy?

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,260
Back off, if we come back, we will all die.

38
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,320
All.

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,310
What have you done?

40
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,340
Are we here a team or what?

41
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,360
Welcome to Mana One, Mr. Morris.

42
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,270
Get rid of it in front of me.

43
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,370
What are you doing? Come on. Hug me. So that's it.

44
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,250
Nice to see you again, Mr. Morris.

45
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,250
Please pass here.

46
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,280
It's always good, what is it, sandalwood?

47
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,410
I admit, it's very impressive so far.

48
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,510
Oh, here they are.

49
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,220
You remember my daughter, Suyin, chief marine expert.

50
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,290
Hi.

51
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,430
You are beautiful than I saw first.

52
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,270
What is he talking about?

53
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,300
Sorry, what are you saying?

54
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,430
I do not understand.

55
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,310
She said that she likes your hat.

56
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,470
Oh, yes. - Yes.

57
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,480
Come on. -Ayo.Yes.

58
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,320
Your granddaughter is very smart.

59
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,490
Okay. What we have here.

60
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,300
This is ...

61
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,500
...very bad.

62
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
You know I realize I don't know much about construction ...

63
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:47,340
... but I believe that world-class research institutions deserve a world-class entrance.

64
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,470
Yes. I agree.

65
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,350
O floor.

66
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,250
Oh my goodness.

67
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,260
Welcome to the O floor.

68
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,420
Nice.

69
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,360
This is our observation center.

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,300
Where the researchers can access the five levels after they are finished.

71
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,370
Wow,

72
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,470
Look at that.

73
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,470
That's not what you usually see every day.

74
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,440
Do you order the pope according to your orders?

75
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,510
Maybe I pulled them with the "whale song".

76
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,430
That's Ruthie and her daughter Gracie.

77
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,320
Extraordinary.

78
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,300
Wow,

79
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,430
Please him. - Please.

80
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,460
Quickly follow me.

81
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,500
I hope we have time.

82
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,270
Please come in.

83
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,210
Wow. / I want to introduce you to our program designer.

84
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,270
Jaxx. - Hi, Doctor.

85
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,250
Hello.

86
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,340
Hi.

87
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,280
Doctor Heller, chief medical officer.

88
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,340
Nice to meet you.

89
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,320
You're like Bones, huh?

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,260
The DJ here is a pilot of our cruisers.

91
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,230
How are you?

92
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,350
Like millionaires.

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,490
And of course the Mac head of the station. - Mr. Morris, on time.

94
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,300
That's what I keep hearing.

95
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,460
Hold this.

96
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,230
What is the right time?

97
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,240
Good morning, Mr. Morris.

98
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,330
Lori Taylor, our mission pilot.

99
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,470
Hello, Mr. Morris, welcome.

100
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,380
Hey. How are you down there?

101
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,350
Where did you learn to drive a submarine?

102
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:35,310
I spent 10 years with an environmental rescue group that cannot be named.

103
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,380
Ask him if he ever detonated a whalership with homemade torpedoes.

104
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,260
Hey. - No.

105
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,390
That's great recruitment.

106
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,490
11-2.

107
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,260
6 degree water temperature.

108
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,260
Our Mac has passed the limit, we are approaching 11 thousand meters.

109
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,270
100 meters from the sea floor.

110
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,470
Maybe.

111
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,440
Maybe from the bottom.

112
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,310
Maybe?

113
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,370
What does that mean, "maybe"?

114
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,310
Come on.

115
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,370
Look at this.

116
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,380
Since 1875, we all believe that the Marianas Trench is the deepest place on earth.

117
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,490
I have a theory that what we think is the seabed is actually a layer of hydrogen sulfate.

118
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,230
Under the cloud, there is a very cold climate.

119
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,320
Which can be a new world.

120
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,360
At first we just wanted to find out if my father was right.

121
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,500
If there is warm water down there, we will be the first to see it.

122
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,370
And what if you're wrong?

123
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,250
Then you waste 1.3 billion dollars.

124
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,250
Are you kidding?

125
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,250
He's kidding, right?

126
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,350
I heard that.

127
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,380
Wait, what?

128
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,480
10 meters, close to the limit.

129
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,400
Float at 5 meters.

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,420
Total stop.

131
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,370
Final check. - Yes.

132
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,300
Ready to continue.

133
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,400
Doctor? - Crew please continue.

134
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,460
DJ? - Submarine rover is ready.

135
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,500
Origin crew, we are ready to enter.

136
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,270
Enter

137
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,470
Do you always think dirty?

138
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,350
Sex, food, strength, and money.

139
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,480
Blast.

140
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,490
Dive Control, we are ready to enter.

141
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,370
We have entered.

142
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,400
Hey, we've entered.

143
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,370
This is a cloud.

144
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,430
This is not the basis.

145
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,380
Lori, be careful, we don't know the depth on the other side, stay alert with your surroundings.

146
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,470
Understood, Mac.

147
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,280
We are ready.

148
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,320
Comrades, we enter.

149
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,260
We get little sun contact.

150
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,360
There is a light below here.

151
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,390
Congratulations.

152
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,300
Release the lamp.

153
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,290
The lamp has been released. We will rotate.

154
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,410
Wow. - very easy.

155
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Geez.

156
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,390
Wow,

157
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,330
Mac, tell me you are them.

158
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,490
We are watching directly, Lori.

159
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,270
There are lots of smiling faces up here.

160
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,350
DJ, we got a suitable place to release the rover.

161
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,510
Understood.

162
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,410
Release is in your hands.

163
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:33,290
Okay. Rover is free.

164
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,220
Understood.

165
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,380
How could it be?

166
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,310
This ecosystem is completely released from this ocean ...

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,410
... except for cold clouds.

168
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,480
We will find a species that is completely unknown.

169
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,360
Sounds like a good investment.

170
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,330
Lori, I got contact.

171
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,490
Go to, E-0 to 0.

172
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,500
Oh, that's big.

173
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,230
Oh, that's great.

174
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,430
And it moves quickly.

175
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,250
DJ does Rover see this?

176
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,340
Negative. I will highlight more lights.

177
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,490
Wow! I just lost his telemetry.

178
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,520
What is this?

179
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:52,300
Origin, please turn sharply right 310, it should only shift.

180
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,410
The last time I checked, the shift did not turn 90 degrees.

181
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,510
It's behind us, right behind us.

182
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,420
What is that?

183
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
Lori, what happened down there?

184
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,430
Hey, guys, look at this.

185
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,290
Wow,

186
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,290
What can make it on a rover?

187
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,240
I don't think I want to know.

188
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,340
That's back.

189
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,330
BEWARE

190
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,430
Oh, my God.

191
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,500
Get out of here, we have to go back.

192
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,340
I've tried, this doesn't work.

193
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,440
I lost control. - I also.

194
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,350
Oh God, DJ, Mac, what's happening down here?

195
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,450
This isn't good.

196
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,390
There's something behind us ...

197
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,520
Lori, enter.

198
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,220
Origin, can you hear me?

199
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,220
Origin. Please answer.

200
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,230
Come on. - Lori, enter.

201
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,500
Wall, can you hear me?

202
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,330
Toshi?

203
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,450
Gather.

204
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,310
Selection.

205
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,370
Not good.

206
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,480
I know they are still alive.

207
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,350
I still get telemetry from their vital signs.

208
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,290
How long do they have?

209
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,320
Maybe 18 hours.

210
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,230
The communication pole is broken, so the camera is dead.

211
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,490
If we try to tow it there is a possibility that 50-50 tanks will explode.

212
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,190
And punch the capsule.

213
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,290
Suffers it from the hold? - Impossible.

214
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,430
That will cause severe damage to the ship.

215
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,530
We have to try something. - They are 6 miles under the sea ...

216
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,300
And no one has ever tried to save at that depth.

217
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,370
Well, that's not true.

218
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,380
No, it's impossible.

219
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,250
We can't handle this.

220
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,410
Never as deep as 11,000 meters.

221
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,480
We've been 5,000 meters, 8,000 meters long, and one point will only be a number.

222
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,290
What if with this number, 3.

223
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,230
That's the number of people who will save under 10,000 meters deep.

224
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,490
And number 1.

225
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,260
Only 1 person lives and can tell it.

226
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,230
You know right?

227
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,430
And see what happens to that one person in the depths ...

228
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,300
He saved 11 people including you, Heller.

229
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,240
That's what I mean.

230
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,400
My friends died, because he experienced madness in depth.

231
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,380
Come on, Heller, that's your diagnosis.

232
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,440
Jonas said something attacked them.

233
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,350
Something big enough to destroy a new submarine.

234
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,450
He's a drunk, he's lazy in Thailand ... - You didn't hear me, you were there.

235
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,250
It is enough.

236
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,220
We all hear, Lori's last message, we have to think ...

237
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,360
... that it's possible that Origin met something in common, with what Jonas Taylor described.

238
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,460
Something that can be avoided by him.

239
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,470
Dad, please.

240
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,400
Prepare a helicopter.

241
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,380
We have to go to Thailand.

242
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,270
Basic rubbish.

243
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,210
Your ship killed me.

244
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,270
Number 1 machine dies.

245
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,310
And there's a leak in ... - I'll take care of it, tonight.

246
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,260
That's what you said last night and the night before.

247
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,420
And the night before.

248
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,450
And what can I do?

249
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,390
You drink too much.

250
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,260
And you just say that because I hold a beer in my hand.

251
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,460
You're always happy in your hands.

252
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,340
Do you know why? - Because I drink too much?

253
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,330
I think it's a quiet Tuesday.

254
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,320
You know I like to enter lively.

255
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,340
Do you think that suddenly coming here after 5 years makes you accepted?

256
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,430
You live in a remote place, really?

257
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,310
I think you won't come to visit.

258
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,470
Jonas. Let me introduce you to ... - Nice to meet you, Doctor Zhang.

259
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,380
I always admire the results of your work.

260
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,250
You're too good, Mr. Taylor.

261
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,220
No, no. You're a good person.

262
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,420
Hey, can I offer you two beers?

263
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,260
Because I will drink beer.

264
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,230
This isn't a social visit, Jonas.

265
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,360
I know you don't use a helicopter for fun.

266
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,270
You surprised me, Mac.

267
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,430
We have a problem ... - Seriously.

268
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,310
Sorry, as you know ...

269
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,370
I don't dive anymore.

270
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,370
I am not responsible to others ... / Mr. Taylor.

271
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,440
Do not mean to offend Doctor Zhang.

272
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,380
There are 2 types of people in this world who force me back into the water.

273
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,320
Maybe you two.

274
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,290
But you can't.

275
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,520
You will say your problem, and I will reject it.

276
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,290
You will offer me money. I will still reject it.

277
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,320
You will pull me back to me first, and I will reject it.

278
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,300
Because I'm sick of that.

279
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:30,230
So what if we enjoy this beer, and I'll take you home.

280
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,370
Jonas.

281
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,500
This happened this morning.

282
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:36,470
Let's leave here!

283
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,500
Close the pad.

284
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,380
This doesn't work.

285
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
I lost control! - I also.

286
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,480
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Do you see this Mac?

287
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,250
There's something down here.

288
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,380
We have to turn right.

289
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,220
There's something behind us ...

290
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,420
That's Lori.

291
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,360
Your ex-wife and crew were trapped at a depth of 11,000 meters.

292
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,360
Fear they also face the species that you meet down there.

293
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,270
I have divers who have little experience to go.

294
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:09,300
But I feel indebted to my crew, to give this best chance of salvation ...

295
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,250
Please ...

296
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,390
Lori, give me the key.

297
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,350
Thanks.

298
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,270
OK.

299
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,240
Okay, if we can turn on the firewall. I can...

300
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,300
Maybe I can restart the computer.

301
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,410
Okay.

302
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,440
Try turning it on.

303
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,290
Backup power is recovered.

304
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,350
The heater is on.

305
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,230
There's no way we can turn on the engine, but maybe we can get thrust.

306
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,260
What are you doing? Record something?

307
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,290
Letter to my wife.

308
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,330
Just in case.

309
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,310
Hey, we will be fine.

310
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,400
One by one.

311
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,470
Come on, give me octopus greetings.

312
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,520
Do you see? Always successful.

313
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,300
No. - What?

314
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,470
We have to turn off the lights.

315
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,330
Turn off the lights.

316
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,490
There is something down there with us.

317
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,230
How can you be sure while there is no window there?

318
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,330
Whatever it is, he can destroy nuclear submarines.

319
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,360
That's not my imagination.

320
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,460
Is that why you destroyed the hold?

321
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,410
Look, I brought 11 survivors back with me.

322
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,310
And let the others die because of panic.

323
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,380
If I don't blow the hold, we will all be killed by that creature.

324
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,250
There are no creatures.

325
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,410
There is no evidence of anything.

326
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,390
Because it was destroyed in the explosion, Heller.

327
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,290
Look, there's no time at the time.

328
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,320
So I made a decision.

329
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,290
And you leave our friends there to die because of your cowardice.

330
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,360
What do you think happened down there?

331
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,270
He lost consciousness.

332
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,400
And now we will send him into the same situation.

333
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,510
Excuse me, Suyin, sorry I'm annoying, but we need you. This is an emergency.

334
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,210
What's wrong, Jaxx?

335
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,280
Now they are leaking oxygen. Their time is only a few hours, maybe more.

336
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,390
I will go.

337
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,380
No. - Wait, what?

338
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,380
I will bring one Glider, connect it to Origin, and pull it up to the top.

339
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,420
Wait, if the Origin tank explodes, you will also die.

340
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,400
We have to try it.

341
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,430
mother.

342
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,390
Ready to leave.

343
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,260
Suyin, you have been allowed to glide.

344
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,510
Automatic decrease setting is turned on.

345
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,220
Hey, Meiying. - Hi.

346
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,480
Sir, we have a new problem.

347
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,450
Your daughter.

348
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,510
He climbs the Glider and tries to save them.

349
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,290
Why did you let her go?

350
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,380
Believe me, I don't let her do anything.

351
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,390
I have an impression you should try to save anyone dying on the seabed.

352
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,390
Who is he?

353
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm the one who pays for all this.

354
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,340
Uh-huh?

355
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,360
You know, he looks heroic, and the way is fast, but ...

356
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,470
... he has a negative attitude.

357
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,440
What is our window of time?

358
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,380
Soon.

359
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,250
Who are you? - I designed all this.

360
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,480
So my life is in your hands.

361
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,350
More or less.

362
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,450
Is that a problem?

363
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,330
No. You look like you know what you're doing.

364
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,390
Oh, sorry.

365
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,340
Mac, ask Doctor Heller to meet us in the treatment room.

366
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,300
Heller?

367
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,500
Did I not mention it?

368
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,280
He is in good health.

369
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,480
It's like the last time you checked me.

370
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,480
Suyin brought Glider 15 minutes ago.

371
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,350
He planned to bring Origin up.

372
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,250
Take me to the ship.

373
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,450
I'm still not finished. - Yes, we're done.

374
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,520
Lori runs out of air.

375
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,500
And we are in international waters, which means ...

376
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,260
... I can beat you without breaking the law and being free.

377
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,390
That's right.

378
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,230
Legal problem.

379
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,470
Thankfully he did not hold a grudge.

380
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,210
Jonas, you know the submarine is at a depth of 12,000 meters, right?

381
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,370
What's leaking at the bottom of the ocean?

382
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,350
Good points.

383
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,480
Are we ready? - Yes.

384
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,280
When you turn off the security system, the machine will be fully manual.

385
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,410
I know that's what you will do.

386
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,360
The system does not matter, try to survive with changes in pressure.

387
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,420
Try not to blow yourself down there.

388
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,520
Thank you, man.

389
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,400
Hello, guard.

390
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,310
You must be crazy.

391
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,370
Who called me that?

392
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,510
My mother, Doctor Heller.

393
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,350
You know I'm not crazy.

394
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,520
I only saw something that no one else saw.

395
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,480
That's the definition of crazy.

396
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,490
Backup power, backup power.

397
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,240
So where are your parents?

398
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,400
My mother tried to save our friends from the ocean floor.

399
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,280
My father is an instructor in Taipei.

400
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,410
Grandpa says mother needs to continue life.

401
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,480
But mom says she needs time because she has married a bastard.

402
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,460
Sounds like your mother has a point.

403
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,320
You know a lot of things.

404
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,290
An 8 year old child hears everything.

405
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,460
Do you mind if I try it?

406
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,200
See you later.

407
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,250
Hey, crazy.

408
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,270
Will my mother die?

409
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,310
I will bring Captain Bubble and your mother back in no time.

410
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,410
I promise.

411
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,390
Thank you. - Evolution 1 will be ready.

412
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,300
DJ? - Yes.

413
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,390
Jaxx? Are we ready?

414
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,460
Dock?

415
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,400
Evolution?

416
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,300
We are ready for diving.

417
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,270
Luxury.

418
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,350
The system is ready for diving.

419
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,290
The system is ready for diving.

420
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,350
Hey, man, we're ready to leave.

421
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,390
The system is ready for diving.

422
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,460
The system is ready for diving.

423
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,240
Jonas. - The system is ready for diving.

424
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,320
Evolution slid successfully.

425
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:54,430
Evolution turns off the security system.

426
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,460
Warning, the second engine Evolution is turned off.

427
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,370
Why does he manage so fast?

428
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,400
He turned off all support systems such as heating and life aides.

429
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,240
He will faint.

430
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,380
Blood gas decreases.

431
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,350
Jonas.

432
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,410
Tell Heller I won't slow down.

433
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,460
Suyin, know that Evolution is behind you, you are asked to return to Mana One as soon as possible.

434
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,410
Negative, he can escort us on the way up.

435
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,470
Tell her to get out of my way, Mac.

436
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,410
More people mean greater risk.

437
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,280
Jonas, you just told her herself.

438
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,480
What? / The green button there is for one channel communication channel.

439
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,250
Brilliant

440
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,270
Enter the thermocline.

441
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,340
Okay, Mac, I'm past.

442
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,490
Warning, the pressure reached 16 thousand PSl.

443
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,480
With this speed I have to dive by turning everything off, until it's finished.

444
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,390
I'll contact from the other side.

445
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,230
Do you have WLFl here?

446
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,200
Okay. Bro.

447
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,370
Toshi, is he still out there?

448
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,270
I do not know.

449
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,300
Right now I can't see anything.

450
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,380
That's him.

451
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,280
I got Origin's visual.

452
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,280
I can see the hook.

453
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,290
Alright, they are still alive.

454
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,260
I will tow it.

455
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,350
Distance to target ... 6 meters.

456
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,450
4 meters.

457
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,330
The target is locked.

458
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,430
Shoot magnetic hooks in ...

459
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,460
3 ...

460
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,500
2 ...

461
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,290
Suyin?

462
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,310
You are okay? What happened?

463
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,260
There's ... something down here.

464
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,350
Something just hit my boat.

465
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,500
Suyin?

466
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,310
What happened? - Giant squid.

467
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,370
He managed to catch the Glider.

468
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,280
Warning of dangerous pressure!

469
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,440
Mac, he tried to destroy me.

470
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,470
He destroyed me.

471
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,250
My glider won't be able to hold it back.

472
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,410
The ship will not survive.

473
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,420
Suyin, remove the compensator retainer.

474
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,420
The compensator does not work.

475
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,290
The ship will break in 10 seconds.

476
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:52,300
The ship will break in 9 seconds.

477
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,290
Shark.

478
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,390
The size is approximately 25 meters.

479
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,490
That's Megalodon.

480
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,430
Impossible.

481
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,300
I'm so glad I'm not crazy.

482
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,380
Suyin, turn off your ship power. He is interested in light.

483
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,470
We must stay in a state without lights.

484
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,450
Turn off the engine in 30 seconds.

485
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,420
I turned everything off except the communication tool.

486
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,390
Get ready he will come again, Suyin.

487
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,440
Turn off the engine in 25 seconds.

488
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,390
Suyin, there's no time. Turn off your lamp.

489
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,220
Turn off the engine in 20 seconds.

490
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,220
Turn off your lamp. Right now.

491
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,390
Turn off the engine in 15 seconds.

492
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,330
Mac, I have no control.

493
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,470
Hurry up. - 10 ...

494
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,440
9 ... 8 ...

495
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,440
7 ...

496
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,500
6 ...

497
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,390
Now is your chance, blow your rod.

498
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,300
No. I can help you save the crew.

499
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,530
Your Gliderm is broken, there's nothing you can do.

500
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,440
Blast your rod, now.

501
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,460
Damn.

502
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,250
Doctor Zhang, your daughter is safe.

503
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,280
Now I'm heading to Origin.

504
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,330
Distance to target 3 meters.

505
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,240
Water discharge is complete.

506
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,350
Come on.

507
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,270
Looks like this is the worst of "I told you, right ?:

508
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,440
You come all the way here just want to say that to me, right?

509
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
More or less.

510
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,470
Extend your hand.

511
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,480
That doesn't look good.

512
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,320
In the third count.

513
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,520
He came.

514
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,290
Come on, quickly.

515
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,460
We can't do anything if the ship is still connected.

516
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,370
Then we will all die.

517
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,430
Come on, I've held you.

518
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,270
He is close enough.

519
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,370
Come on, fast, fast.

520
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,480
Hurry up.

521
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,380
We won't have time.

522
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,480
Toshi, fast.

523
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,420
Toshi, no!

524
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,360
Sorry.

525
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,290
Sign in, Evolution.

526
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,380
Jonas, come in.

527
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,290
Are you all ok?

528
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:20,300
Doctor Heller detected Lori's vital, and The Wall, but we didn't detect Toshi's vitality.

529
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,240
Is Toshi alright?

530
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,400
Jonas, is Toshi okay?

531
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,470
Slowly.

532
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,240
Don't move her neck.

533
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,340
Nice.

534
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,350
Watch Out. Nice.

535
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,320
You can't save Toshi?

536
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,230
Why not? - He closed the palkanya.

537
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,300
He saved us.

538
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,270
You leave him.

539
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,330
You leave him.

540
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,240
That's why you are.

541
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,240
You're the one who left friends behind.

542
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,480
When you go to that depth ...

543
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,480
... you carry the lives of people in your hands.

544
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,250
You are the one who chooses to lower them.

545
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,360
This is why I don't do this anymore, Mac.

546
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,370
How is the condition?

547
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,440
It didn't hit her vital organs, but she lost a lot of blood.

548
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,250
But the condition is stable.

549
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,350
Jonas.

550
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,450
Sorry.

551
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,260
I am wrong.

552
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,370
You saved Lori.

553
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,370
I consider it even.

554
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,300
I just want to apologize. I'm angry, I lost patience,

555
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,470
... and you saved ...

556
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,410
You're naked.

557
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,510
I know you do everything you can, so ...

558
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,210
Thanks.

559
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,450
Yes. You are welcome.

560
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,480
I know it's not easy to be a survivor.

561
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,300
I will go.

562
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,420
You better get dressed. - Yes, that's the plan.

563
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:07,390
Okay, continue.

564
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:30,430
Hi. I am alright.

565
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,330
Jonas and Lori are the worst couples.

566
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:38,320
Oh / All experiments are over.

567
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,470
I did not ask anything.

568
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,410
I know.

569
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,340
This is what attacks us. A Megalodon.

570
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,310
How big is that creature? - Between 70 and 90 feet.

571
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,320
21 to 27 meters.

572
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,380
Megalodon is the biggest shark ever.

573
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,360
It's not afraid of anything.

574
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,450
It has no predator.

575
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,360
The jaw is stronger than any animal.

576
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,300
Meg can bite the whale in two, destroy the bone.

577
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,300
We are in an unmapped area.

578
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,510
To this day, Megalodon is considered extinct more than 2 million years.

579
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,480
wrong. - A living fossil.

580
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,380
The living fossil killed my friend.

581
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,250
I can't express my sadness at Toshi's death.

582
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,320
We find the greatest discoveries of a lifetime.

583
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,490
This is what Toshi did.

584
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:44,370
This is what we all do, but we have to do it slowly.

585
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,300
Yes, it won't work for me.

586
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,380
What is Magnum One?

587
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,340
The station? - Yes, and what does it do?

588
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,370
Hm? Recently?

589
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,220
Exactly. There is no.

590
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,490
A machine of 20 million dollars, lost. The 30 million dollar submarine is gone.

591
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:16,260
You sit in the most expensive underwater biology camp in human history.

592
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,260
Hey, crazy people.

593
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,290
And now we find something amazing.

594
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,280
We can't work slowly. - Thank you for keeping the promise.

595
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,440
You don't stop going to the moon.

596
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,210
Because you lost an astronaut.

597
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,510
You go ahead, or someone else will arrive first.

598
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,220
Others will want this.

599
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,450
Whether we like it or not.

600
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,220
It looks like you like it.

601
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,230
Excuse me? - I say...

602
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,260
... looks like you like it.

603
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:54,260
Sorry, is he part of this team? - Right, he's part of this team.

604
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,430
Okay.

605
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,410
Maybe you think nature knows what he is doing.

606
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,410
The weather changes may exist for a reason.

607
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,350
If you want to explore, please do it.

608
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:14,480
If you send people there, don't call me to save you.

609
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:18,390
If only what I did was not clear to you.

610
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,400
So that makes us hostile.

611
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,370
That's the order.

612
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,280
Downstairs.

613
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,410
Come on.

614
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,490
What you find is a gold mine bigger than we thought.

615
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,460
We are not ready to face creatures like Megalodon.

616
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,360
We can get ready in one week.

617
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:34,300
We need a long time ... - Are you crazy?

618
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,320
That will be another alternative.

619
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,330
What is that?

620
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,360
My daughter.

621
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,240
Jonas! - Do you see Meiying?

622
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,510
Meiying.

623
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,480
Meiying! - I'm right.

624
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,250
Meiying.

625
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,380
Meiying.

626
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,450
Meiying!

627
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,450
Mother! - Meiying.

628
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,490
It is okay.

629
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,230
Are you okay?

630
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,460
There is a monster watching us.

631
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,490
It's okay, it's just a whale.

632
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,460
Wait. Where is Susy?

633
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,230
Where are the others?

634
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:57,480
Is the station okay? Report it.

635
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,340
No leakage, no damage.

636
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,440
Team, run an emergency protocol.

637
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,390
And no one is approaching the water. - Do you want to sit down?

638
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,410
Turn on the water lamp, especially the important area.

639
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,330
You said it was impossible for him to get here.

640
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,420
It should be. - Everyone, look at this.

641
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,460
When the accelerator rises, everything is installed, the temperature is 1 degree Celsius, right?

642
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,270
Yes. -But a minute later ...

643
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,300
... when the evolution occurs, the temperature rises by 25 degrees.

644
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,280
A shark can't use it.

645
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,280
In fact, 20 sharks.

646
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,510
The megalodon comes from the heating vent.

647
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,450
That can cost millions of gallons per minute.

648
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,280
The heat from the vents clears the road from the cold.

649
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,520
You said we paved the way for giant sharks?

650
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:46,460
Not really, it's like a stopover vent, the temperature is back to normal and the gap is closed.

651
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:52,230
Yes, but that was before the pre-historic killing machine came to say hello.

652
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,360
We waste time and it's out there.

653
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,400
We have to find and kill him. /No!

654
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:02,210
We can't, we must take harmless choices first.

655
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,240
For Megalodon or for us?

656
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,450
I got an emergency signal. 20 miles southwest.

657
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:14,420
What does it mean? - This means that a ship sank.

658
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,290
Three ships. - That's a Megalodon.

659
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,260
I have to go there, right now.

660
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:38,410
Back off! I saw something.

661
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,460
This shark doesn't have fins. - It was killed by a shark catcher.

662
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:03,410
They cut off the fin and release the shark to death.

663
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,460
All for a bowl of soup.

664
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,280
Looks like Megalodon avenged him.

665
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,210
One fish doing all this?

666
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:19,350
You just see it yourself.

667
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,290
Okay. We have shark cages and spears on his ship.

668
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:27,490
If we can shoot Megalodon in a weak spot like the mouth or gills,

669
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,430
... we can inject it with something dangerous.

670
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:33,270
Waw, waw, it takes at least 20 minutes to prepare the cage.

671
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,360
And the creature will soon disappear.

672
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,270
I will just put the tracker.

673
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,410
Have you never watched "Shark Week"?

674
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:45,310
They have GPS trackers.

675
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,320
Keep an eye on the shark until the cage is ready.

676
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,250
We can put the tracker on the fin.

677
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,310
Thank you again.

678
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,380
Yes, but somehow we have to put it on Megalodon.

679
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,380
No, we can't. The creature proved aggressive towards the ship.

680
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,360
The safest way to approach it is without a vehicle.

681
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,530
Wait! Wait. - Do you want someone to swim there?

682
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,260
Two prehistoric sharks that eat our friends?

683
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,300
Actually, one of us in the water is not a threat.

684
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,240
Okay, who will swim?

685
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,270
Let's choose.

686
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,410
I can't swim.

687
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,440
Sorry. My body makes me say that.

688
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:27,480
Are you sure about this?

689
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:32,290
Not really.

690
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:36,320
If I'm eaten, you will regret it.

691
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,410
This tracker has a distance of 100 feet.

692
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,470
100 feet? - Come close before you shoot.

693
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,310
OK.

694
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,340
If I know how, I will do it.

695
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,340
We can overcome this.

696
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,370
You're a great liar.

697
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,480
Be careful. - Yes, thank you, friend.

698
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,490
I hope you are right about this. /I also.

699
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,340
Maybe I will need it.

700
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:35,250
I'm heading there, to the killer shark.

701
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,250
Yes, I saw you, Jonas.

702
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,450
Sharks react to panic movements.

703
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,260
Keep calm.

704
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,300
Everything will be alright.

705
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:07,280
Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming.

706
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:19,470
Gosh, it's shark diving.

707
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:20,460
Successful. - Mac, tracking it on!

708
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,470
Good. Pull him, DJ!

709
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:33,470
Stop! Stop! There is no vibration!

710
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,270
Damn, I'm having a problem.

711
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:40,270
Jonas, it's heading towards you. - It's heading towards us!

712
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,410
Run the boat, run the ship!

713
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,280
Pull him!

714
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,440
Come on! - Come on!

715
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,460
Maybe you are a bastard, but you know how to do it. Nice.

716
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,390
I prepared his spear to inject endorphins.

717
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,290
A faint killer whale with a dose of 10cc.

718
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,480
Dead with a dose of 20 cc.

719
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,510
What do you think?

720
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:00,390
I think we just use the whole bottle.

721
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,320
Remind me again why this is a good idea.

722
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,460
What? This is a shark cage.

723
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,440
Plastic shark cage.

724
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:11,340
I assume you never said that.

725
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:15,470
This object is made of polycarbonate, specifically designed not to crack,

726
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,420
... not broken, but can be damaged. And in this case, with its thickness,

727
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,320
... it takes 2,000 pounds per square inch.

728
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:30,450
When it comes to solving it, it takes 8 to 9 thousand pounds.

729
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,330
I don't like it.

730
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,430
He doesn't like it. - I won't go there.

731
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:46,340
Continue.

732
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,240
It is enough!

733
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,510
Hi. - What do you think?

734
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:06,380
He said be careful. It was him version of "I love you".

735
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,490
He is very sure of you.

736
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,260
I have dived with sharks hundreds of times.

737
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:17,500
I don't like this. - Yes.

738
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:19,410
But I know the anatomy of sharks.

739
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,470
And I know this can penetrate the skin of Megalodon.

740
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,250
Suyin, let me do it. - Hey, don't worry about me.

741
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:33,310
Let me do the best I can.

742
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,300
Is everything okay up there?

743
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:25,400
Suppose it's fresh, so you, you know, tastes good.

744
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:31,240
I'm glad you took care of me. - Thank you. See you, good luck.

745
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,500
What happened down there? Are you okay?

746
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,310
Yes, I'm fine.

747
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:06,440
There are only a few 8-foot sharks.

748
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,260
This is it.

749
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,480
We get shark's attention. - Suyin, that's on the way.

750
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,230
50 meters! - 50 meters.

751
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,500
30.

752
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,330
10 meters.

753
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,320
Okay.

754
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,350
Wow ...

755
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,390
I'll try to hit it in the eye.

756
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,460
Damn it!

757
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,490
Damn it!

758
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,300
Yes, the poison comes in!

759
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,500
Okay, you hang on there.

760
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,330
I'm stuck, I'm in shark's mouth.

761
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,510
The cage won't break.

762
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:49,280
That's the problem, the cage is swallowed!

763
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,260
Geez.

764
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,240
Don't do this anymore. - Oh, no, friend.

765
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,300
New problem, my mask broke.

766
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,280
I lost air.

767
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,280
Please!

768
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,350
Please!

769
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,330
Come on!

770
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:14,440
You are welcome.

771
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,210
No more, go! Take this to the ship.

772
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,510
It's not safe for you.

773
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:32,290
Jonas, come back ...

774
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,320
Jonas, the crane is in the water!

775
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,360
The rope will attract you, hurry up!

776
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,260
Swing the sack and lower it.

777
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,370
We will lower it. Friends, I need help.

778
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,370
Come on ...

779
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,480
Over here!

780
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,320
Throw the rope!

781
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,320
She does not breathe.

782
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:06,300
Wow, wow ... just slowly.

783
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,310
You died a few minutes ago.

784
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,240
Doctor...

785
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,410
You make me owe.

786
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,350
Closer than I like.

787
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,220
Can I speak privately with Jonas?

788
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,450
Certain.

789
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:42,240
You saved me again.

790
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,370
But I would rather you live.

791
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,310
There is something you might want to see.

792
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,430
Hey, you are safe.

793
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,460
How are you? - I'm better.

794
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,490
Thanks.

795
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:14,310
Jonas, take a picture of me with this big monster.

796
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,280
Oh, for a moment. this.

797
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:19,470
If you want good photos, tilt your head sideways again.

798
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,420
Closer. Come on, come on in.

799
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,440
Okay.

800
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,380
Are you okay?

801
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:34,330
Yo, Jonas, did you get that before?

802
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,490
I got everything.

803
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,330
That's not funny, man!

804
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:41,460
No, seriously it's funny, look at this.

805
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,470
<i> We can prey on water ... <i>

806
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:48,310
<i> We can prey on water ... <i>

807
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:49,470
<i> We can prey on water ... <i>

808
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,480
Hey, look at this.

809
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:55,350
This is kind of weird.

810
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:59,480
Look, remember the bite mark in Holland?

811
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,290
Well, do you like that? That's really an extraordinary natural moment.

812
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,520
I'm glad the problem is over.

813
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,370
You don't end it all.

814
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:16,300
Not for Toshi, not for science.

815
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:19,270
We do what people always do.

816
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:23,300
Find then destroy.

817
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,280
Hey, I tell you, at least you can use this for sports.

818
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,340
Make your feet big, you know?

819
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:36,380
Oh yeah, jellyfish!

820
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:19,230
What? There are 2?

821
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:21,260
Nobody says there are 2!

822
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,330
How can there be 2 ?!

823
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:26,470
I'm in the water, please! Somebody help me!

824
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,470
Please! - What are you doing?

825
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:32,280
I can't swim.

826
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:35,440
Seriously? Really? But you are swimming racing.

827
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:42,450
Come on guys! You don't realize, you work in the middle of the ocean!

828
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:47,220
This is not part of the agreement, this is not part of deskjob.

829
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,460
And I'm not happy!

830
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,430
Sir!

831
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:55,300
No! Sir!

832
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,240
Sir!

833
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,370
There is something very big.

834
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,370
Yes, of course.

835
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,240
I can not take it anymore.

836
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,250
Mac, give your hand.

837
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,380
Hey, I want you to find my location.

838
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,220
Search from sat in this section.

839
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,490
Yes, you.

840
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,260
How should I know ?!

841
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,360
Hurry up, I need help.

842
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,270
Thank you, thank you.

843
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,460
Relax, relax.

844
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,340
This isn't good, he needs a hospital right away.

845
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:36,400
Let's find a doctor. Who is the doctor here?

846
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:40,300
Mac!

847
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:42,510
Are you okay? - Yes.

848
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:49,320
Comrades, we can do this.

849
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,380
Swimming calmly to the boat.

850
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:53,420
Slow slow and calm.

851
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,430
Shark is coming!

852
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,300
We will not succeed.

853
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:08,280
Jazz, you will be fine.

854
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,300
You're a good person Jaz. - What is the moment?

855
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,410
Be careful.

856
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,470
No!

857
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,370
It's okay, Jazz.

858
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,450
Are you okay.

859
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,330
What was that before? What is that?

860
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,460
Okay, come on, Dj. - No, no!

861
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:08,270
This is the reason we don't leave the station, okay?

862
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,400
That's why you didn't do it.

863
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:14,400
You're down there, and you make him angry. Now he will kill us.

864
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,470
Now what should we do?

865
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:19,240
I didn't like this from the start. Swim in the middle of the sea.

866
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:22,410
Those who eat something else, others eat that.

867
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,510
Friend, this ...

868
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:29,360
He just killed Heller, he killed Wall.

869
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:32,330
He killed Toshi.

870
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:36,360
They are all our friends.

871
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,500
Okay, can I say that this thing sank?

872
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:50,270
What are we doing now? - Where is Mac?

873
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,290
Yes!

874
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,540
What's with your hair?

875
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,310
What's with your hair?

876
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,470
Finished

877
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,220
Friend!

878
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,450
That creature is a demon!

879
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,480
Is your friend still with us?

880
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,390
Do you get our position?

881
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,520
Ocean? We are in the middle of the sea!

882
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:43,330
Maybe to slow down the shark, we throw him away?

883
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,360
You're really crazy.

884
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:51,310
Okay, good news. This is the time for retribution.

885
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,270
Yes, good!

886
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,440
Do you really think the rifle will hurt the creature?

887
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:34,440
I don't have many choices, okay? I just want him to leave.

888
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,250
Good friend.

889
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,410
Father...

890
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,320
No, father.

891
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,450
Mother!

892
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,460
Mother!

893
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,360
Welcome, mother.

894
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:32,450
Forgive me.

895
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:38,300
He is sad and confused.

896
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:42,360
And you?

897
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:46,270
I really don't want to think about that.

898
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,440
So bad things happen then, change lives forever.

899
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,410
While the earth continues to spin.

900
01:15:55,450 --> 01:16:01,290
We hope to stop for a while.

901
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,220
But that didn't happen

902
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,250
I will be able to live with that.

903
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:13,260
Then don't, my 2 friends die.

904
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,290
Did not have time to say goodbye.

905
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,300
We play, we are together.

906
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,310
And die silly.

907
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:26,270
It's not just you who lost.

908
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:31,380
This is losing him, the person you saved.

909
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,260
I'm glad you are here.

910
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:53,270
I have informed the Chinese government about Megalodon.

911
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:58,370
Likewise with the authorities in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia & Australia.

912
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,440
China sent 2 destroyers to kill Shark.

913
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:08,450
So this is now officially beyond our ability.

914
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:14,460
I closed MOT 1 until the megalodon died.

915
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:19,230
And the evacuation ship arrived the next morning.

916
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:21,290
You're right.

917
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:25,500
And finally, I want to say ...

918
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,500
...Forgive me.

919
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:33,340
For your loss.

920
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,320
Your friends.

921
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,340
I was here to celebrate with you.

922
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:45,350
But now I grieve with you.

923
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:01,430
Take care of yourself.

924
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,340
What do you get for me?

925
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:14,380
This high-power explosive.

926
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,360
I have arranged to have a delay when sinking.

927
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,490
Basically this is a marine mine.

928
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,360
It is true.

929
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,390
I'm not sure this is the right thing to do.

930
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:31,430
Every person killed by the creature has the potential to file a lawsuit.

931
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,270
Potential victim.

932
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,300
Relaxing friends, everything will be fine.

933
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,480
I can see your card. - Oh you two here.

934
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,350
Hey.

935
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:47,350
How do you feel?

936
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,380
Better than all of you.

937
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:54,260
Hmm? - What do you have?

938
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,460
3 Kings ... - What? Come on.

939
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,400
Every time. You owe me the trick.

940
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:02,330
OK.

941
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:07,310
Let's get ready when you're back, OK? - Good, good, good, good, good.

942
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:12,280
I tried to distract her. - Very tough child.

943
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,340
Sorry, don't trust you.

944
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:21,410
You don't call me crazy. - Yes, I don't call you sane.

945
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:26,320
Sane is not a word I often hear.

946
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,460
So what?

947
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:31,330
Well ... I guess I went home to Thailand.

948
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:34,300
Mac tells me about you and Suyin.

949
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,290
Nothing. - Well, maybe there is something.

950
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:41,400
You and Mac can't be trusted. - How did you try something just now?

951
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:46,350
The rest of your life in the sight of big grass ... Suffering and loneliness.

952
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:48,510
I thought that was a good idea.

953
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,350
You think so, huh?

954
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,290
Thank you for everything.

955
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,350
Jonas ...

956
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:01,420
... my mother likes you too.

957
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,370
She imitated the most severe mother of my life.

958
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,370
Approaching dangerous areas ...

959
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:15,310
Confirm visual.

960
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:18,370
Let me explain myself!

961
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:20,510
We are not a mile from the monster.

962
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,280
Until the helicopter kills the monster!

963
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,380
We have visuals on the target. - Stop the boat!

964
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:29,220
Stop the boat!

965
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:34,260
Launch Delta Load.

966
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:49,340
We get shark!

967
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,430
Attack again!

968
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:54,400
Sir, it's impossible ... - Attack again!

969
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:02,480
The target is dead! Repeated, the target is dead!

970
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:07,390
Are you absolutely sure? Because I don't want to be eaten by prehistoric fish!

971
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:12,420
Sure, sir ... There are ... scattered pieces.

972
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,490
Shark meat pieces!

973
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,230
That's a good sign. OK.

974
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,470
Take us there!

975
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:31,410
Get down there, get some teeth, big teeth for my office desk!

976
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:34,510
OK. - Take it for yourself.

977
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,420
Nice!

978
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:41,500
Do you see this?

979
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,360
It's crazy!

980
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:52,240
It's crazy!

981
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,310
Very weird.

982
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:05,220
Ouch, buddy. Don't do that.

983
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:06,450
This creature has no teeth.

984
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:10,390
What? - I thought we killed the pope.

985
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:15,460
That creature is just below us.

986
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:18,430
Get us out of here!

987
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:27,400
Wait, wait, you idiots! Wait! I'm here! Hey!

988
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,440
Oh no! No!

989
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:34,410
No!

990
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:37,280
No! No!

991
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:41,280
Hey! No!

992
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,410
Yes, I understand, I understand. Thanks.

993
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,250
Let me guess, Morris never called someone.

994
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:16,420
Don't call anyone. No one knows I'm out there. No one.

995
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,520
Even Australia, Chinna doesn't know, no one.

996
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,290
What did he think?

997
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:23,230
He wants to take care of it as secretly as possible.

998
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,360
Mac, we need to go. - And everything goes, huh. Good.

999
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,300
Jack. Can you find that creature? - Wait, wait, why did you ask for that?

1000
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:31,500
I like the fact you ask about the creature.

1001
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:36,440
Do you want me to illegally touch Morris's satellite tracking system to look for the black shark?

1002
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,470
Yes. - Good.

1003
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:41,410
Using a tracker from Meg. We killed him.

1004
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,470
Bro ...

1005
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:46,280
... we really will do this?

1006
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:48,260
Many people will die if we don't kill him, Mac.

1007
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:49,380
I participated. - I also.

1008
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,390
Let's do this.

1009
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:53,420
What do you think if the creature eats an evacuation ship?

1010
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:58,490
Well, let's say, a sunny day for fishing.

1011
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,370
Then let's prepare everything. Explosives and weapons.

1012
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:05,340
Whatever, all of it. Everything. - Because we will evacuate, right?

1013
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:10,330
Like evacuation? Like leaving a dangerous area and going to a safe place?

1014
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:13,250
Like normal people?

1015
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:27,360
What do we get? - Yes, this is what I saw from the shark.

1016
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:30,300
But here, where the creature is headed.

1017
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:32,390
Sanya Bay, what's there? - Nothing.

1018
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:36,370
It only has one of the most famous beaches with a high population in the world.

1019
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:37,530
Success with the authorities?

1020
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:41,410
No. Prehistoric sharks, sound like a fad phone.

1021
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,430
We cannot depend on them for anything.

1022
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,410
How long does the shark reach the beach? / 20 minutes.

1023
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,420
Can we get there first? - doubtful.

1024
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:50,470
Yes, we have to. - We were not useful until first.

1025
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,420
If we don't have a plan.

1026
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:55,390
Maybe we have a plan.

1027
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,260
This is what we do, right in shallow water.

1028
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:03,460
There are lots of corals! - So, how do we bring it here?

1029
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:07,300
When there are many people who can be preyed here?

1030
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:10,330
He invited her to night.

1031
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:24,450
So, how do you want to do it?

1032
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:26,510
Do you ask my opinion?

1033
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,250
No. I'm trying to be polite before you really do it.

1034
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,390
So you will feel better for yourself.

1035
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:37,400
Appreciate that.

1036
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,310
What? - There is no.

1037
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,400
We are ready.

1038
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:54,280
CAHR-63A

1039
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:41,280
Oh, my God!

1040
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,390
We are approaching. Stop here. Jaxx, DJ, must sort the tool.

1041
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,460
Yes, it is being cultivated.

1042
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,410
What is this?

1043
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,330
Watch out!

1044
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:55,350
Sharks! Shark! - Sharks?

1045
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,420
There are sharks! - There are sharks!

1046
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:01,450
Is there a shark? - Hurry to the beach!

1047
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,460
Hurry up! Get up!

1048
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:08,230
Hurry up. - Hurry up!

1049
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,330
Hurry up!

1050
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:12,500
Mother!

1051
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:19,270
My child! - Mother!

1052
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,440
My son!

1053
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:24,440
Help me!

1054
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:28,420
Do you see the sharks?

1055
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:32,450
No, haven't seen it yet! - Help me! Come on!

1056
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,440
Come on, quickly!

1057
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:10,320
Mother! - My son, hurry up!

1058
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:12,490
To the beach!

1059
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:16,400
Quickly swim! - Hurry up!

1060
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:22,500
Mother!

1061
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:03,410
Has anyone changed their mind about our plan?

1062
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,350
Not being killed is a good start.

1063
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:10,350
Finally there is a joke. Let's make it happen.

1064
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:13,220
Suyin, watch out, get out of there.

1065
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:25,360
Damn it! Can't shoot! - What's wrong, Jonas?

1066
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:28,310
Too close to the ship!

1067
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:30,440
Gosh!

1068
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:35,470
Jonas, the shark is after you! - Mac!

1069
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:42,350
Jonas, what's there? - Try to move away from shark's mouth.

1070
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:05,400
Gosh!

1071
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:18,450
Suyin, your turn. Lead to you. - I'm in position.

1072
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,290
The shark is approaching.

1073
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:23,260
Need a little taper.

1074
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:31,430
I'm ready to shoot! - Shoot it!

1075
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:35,240
Avoid! Avoid!

1076
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:44,480
What happened under there? There!

1077
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:59,300
Has anyone seen it? / Can't see the shark, what's down there?

1078
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:11,470
Fine, I got shark's attention.

1079
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,510
Bawake my direction!

1080
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,420
Your turn!

1081
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:23,280
I thought we both saw the shark.

1082
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:29,230
Dead you ugly bastard!

1083
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:34,190
No, no, no! - Damn it!

1084
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:37,300
Gosh!

1085
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,470
Wow!

1086
