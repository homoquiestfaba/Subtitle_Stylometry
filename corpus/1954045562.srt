wretched mistake?

12
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,446
I hate the expression
"I hear you."

13
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:23,048

the one expressed to me
by Mr. Arnaud's father

is that you are
encouraging Paul to gamble.

You told
your dad that, Paul?

68

It's his credit card.

69
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,893
MONROE: The point is,
Mr. Furst,

70
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,630
Mr. Arnaud did not send his
boy 3,500 miles from home

71
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,766
in order to start him
on the road to perdition.

72
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,703
You are supposed to be earning
your Masters of Finance

73
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,806
and serving as a graduate
teaching assistant.

74
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:06,245
Instead, you are running
some kind of virtual casino.

75
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,347
Gambling is forbidden
on campus.

76
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,650
Bookmaking is forbidden
on campus.

77
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,685
And if you don't
change your tune,

78
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,022
you're going to be forbidden
on campus as well.

79

I'll finish with Mr. Furst alone.

80

Paul. Thanks, man.

81
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,538

income is too high.

My official title is
"Affiliate for Online Gaming."

98
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,685
I get a small fee for

I'm not living some
elaborate lifestyle, here.

It's how I'm paying my way
through this university.

101

What we touch touches us,
too, Mr. Furst.

102
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,262
Dean, I'm in marketing.

103
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,497
As am I.

104
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,100
And what I market
is this university.

105
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,770
You will close up shop,
effective immediately,

106
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,607

but the rest of us still have
to grind for our Masters.

Is your plan just to gamble
for your tuition money?

117
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,729
Whoa, whoa, it's not like
I'm shooting craps

118

You're playing poker,

It's a big difference.

121
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:47,272
And $17,000 means
zero to me right now.

122
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,741
This is my shot, okay?
And statistically, it's the right play.

123
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,443
Look, I've been
three-tabling.

124
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,078
I find a guy on the fourth,

125

Hold up. (STAMMERING)
Why did you just raise?

127
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,519
Non-weighted game theory.

128
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,321
Because it'll outperform the EV of
flatting and he'll spaz in anyway.

337
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,926
That means they fall substantially
below the standard deviation.

338
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,700

Internet forums, chat rooms,

339

Good.

350
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,876
I'm a big believer

351
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,911
who kills what
they eat, you know?

352
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,614
The Indians had
that figured out.

353
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,249
And not a whole
hell of a lot else

My name's Ivan.

356
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,887

357
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,155
It's a pleasure, Richie.

<i>This is The House.</i>

360
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,528
I never in a million years thought
I'd have something like this.

361
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,964
Just got to the point where me and
my old partner, Alex Maynard,

362
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,433
looked in the ATM account and
realized we had so much money

363
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,402
that it was morally incumbent
on us to buy something.

364
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,605
So, we ordered
a set of these boats.

365
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,541
We had a good time.
A lot of fun.

366
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,310

Is he still involved?

367
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,580
No. Alex, um...

368
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,918
You know, this life
has a lot of temptation.

369
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,887
And it just gets
a hold of some people.

370
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,458
Alex died of a drug overdose a
little more than three years ago.

371
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,395
He was a good guy.
He was my...

372
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,464
He was my best friend.

373
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,066
<i>Why The House?</i>

374
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,635
Because the house
always wins.

375
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,872
Which is why we don't
have to cheat people.

376
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,775
We have the greatest
business model in the world.

377
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,379
50,000 players, three cents
a second, average rake.

378
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,447
That's just poker, okay?

379
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,951
The rest of the site we're doing
$1.2 to $1.9 million a day.

380
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:31,455
That translates into
$750,000 net profit per day.

381
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,025
But the math is right.
Am I missing something?

382
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,027
No, you didn't
miss anything.

383
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,363
We missed something.

384
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,965
We had a couple
of our programmers

385
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,700
who decided
it would be a good idea

386
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,602
to write a backdoor
into the code

387
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,537
so that they could
see player's hole cards.

388
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,539
And they cheated you.

389
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,641
And they cheated
other players.

390
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,610
And I'm really sorry
and I'm embarrassed.

391
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,045
And that has nothing
to do with what

392
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,780
this company
and what this site stand for.

393
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,782
You saw it.

394
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,684
The donkeys in Compliance
missed it.

395
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01,185
This is why

from Compliance come from.

397

But you came to me.

398
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,124
You didn't tell
anybody else.

399
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,793
Because you know rumors
of cheating and bullshit

400
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,761
can affect these sites
like fucking bedbugs

401
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,363
and you can never
get rid of it.

402
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,998
That took a lot of balls.

403
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,300
Honestly, I couldn't get
to you any other way.

404
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,903
Regardless,
I'm very grateful.

405
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:22,139
I am nothing if not world-class
at showing my gratitude

Studying my player history,
ran it through your algorithm,

417

Look, Richie, I understand
why you did what you did.

421
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,377
I know about what happened
with that job on Wall Street.

422
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,746
You were trying to get rich, and
you were trying to be respectable.

423
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,848
And you would have, if you
had another year and a half.

424
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,216
Those people
took your labor...

425
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,617
And my fucking money.

426
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,119

and they burned it all up.

Because Wall Street's a different place.
The rules have changed.

429
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,926
The odds of getting a job at a
good hedge fund on Wall Street

430
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,129
are roughly the same
as hitting runner-runner flush

431
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,063
in a hand of Texas Hold 'Em.

432
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,535
You probably know what the odds
of hitting a runner-runner flush

433
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,303
in Texas Hold 'Em are,
don't you?

434
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,139
Roughly four percent.

435
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:29,840
Roughly four percent.

00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,934
What the fuck have
I done in New Jersey, huh?

684
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,402
Or New York,
for that matter?

685
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,338
You're not that bright
for a Princeton man.

686
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,706
It's sad.

687
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,575
I was talking to my
associate, Agent Mohr,

688
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,745
and he has a sworn statement
from a Dean Monroe

689
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:52,149
that says you were promoting
gambling at Princeton.

690
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,618
Now, if you were my guy,
I could make it all go away.

691
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,086
Wipe the slate clean.

692
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:58,021
But if the sun comes up
tomorrow and you're still here,

693
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,222
and you're not my guy

694
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,993
then I pull the trigger.

695
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:07,864
And you can forget about working on
Wall Street or any legitimate casino.

696
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:11,902
Because you need a license for that,
and felons don't get them.

697
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,671
See, I can stand here and say I'm
doing it because it's my job.

Or I'm upholding the law,
blah-blah-fucking-blah.

699
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:21,545
But the truth is, I'm doing
it because I enjoy it.

on you sometime,

I just didn't know
what you'd do.

715
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,029
Now I do.
Is it that guy Shavers?

716
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,531
Did he give you the line
about how I'm a bad guy,

all that shit?

718

Yeah, he's threatened
me with jail.

He said I'd be barred from
re-entering the country.

gonna go to jail, okay?

by the FBI.

I get it.
That's really fucking scary.

just get the fuck out of here.

one thing.

something wrong?

to take online gambling

three points rake-back

1027
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,662
Then you got more than
an ongoing negotiation.

1028
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,964
You have
a fucking problem.

1029
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,432
Did he take the money?

1030
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,067
Yeah, he took it.

1031
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:27,002
Then what's the fucking
problem, Richie?

1032
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,938
I mean, it's the gambling
business in Costa Rica.

You let me walk
right into it, Ivan.

1035
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,977
This is your job.
You understand?

1036
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,346
If you want a safer job,
go work for the post office.

1037
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:39,548
You want a clear conscience?
Go start a charity.

1038

But if you want
your own fucking island

1039
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:44,453
and your boss says you gotta go
out there and take a beating,

1040
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,722
go out there, take it,
come back to work and say,

1041
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,258
"Do you need me
to do it again?"

1042
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:56,065
Because right now, I am giving
you the keys to the kingdom.

1043
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,266
How did you know I'd even
make it out of there alive?

1044
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:58,500
How did you know?

1045
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:00,302
Because you're a winner.

1046
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:01,971
Because I believe in you.

1047
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,741
And you got hurt.
I'm sorry.

1048
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:08,544

I'd do it again.

And six weeks from now,
that could be me.

fucking arrest him?

You guys don't have jurisdictional
issues like the FBI!

what do you think
he's going to do, huh?

All right.

1119
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,989
So they got me running these
credit card security protocols.

1120
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,858
And I get in there,
into the code,

1121
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,561
and I decide to freelance
around a little bit, right?

1122
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,297
So, I find there's nothing in the
individual players' accounts.

1123
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,465
What do you mean,
"nothing"?

1124
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,266
Nothing.
Practically drained, dude.

1125
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:52,935
They keep enough in there
to cover the floats.

1126
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:54,937
So if any given player
wanted to cash out,

1127
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:57,005
the software would find the
money and then pay him off.

1128
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:58,507
In the meantime,
Block's just using

1129
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:00,609
everybody else's
funds as his own.

1130
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,177

here's the thing.

1140
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,442
People often make poor decisions
when they're desperate.

1141
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:34,243

00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,845
No.

1143
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,947
What do you mean?

1144
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:40,782
Let's say you're being
charged by a bear.

1145
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:42,651
You're supposed
to stand still.

1146
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:44,686
Most people run and they
end up getting killed.

1147
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,489
It's understandable, right?

1148
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:48,624
Let me show you something.

1149
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,495
I really have Wilson
to thank for this.

1150
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:54,997
He don't look like much,
but he's a dog

1151
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,132
with a bone when
he gets an assignment.

1152
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,835
This is some surveillance
footage he dug up.

1153
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:10,312
Would you look at that?

1154
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:13,515
Take a few years off him and the old guy
really does look like you, doesn't he?

1155
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,617
This is the Trop in AC.

1156
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,323
If I wasn't your friend, I'd
say your dad was a deadbeat.

1157
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,360
There isn't a casino,
a bookmaker, or shylock

1158
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:27,763
from Vegas to New York

1159
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:31,266
that the old man isn't into
for some serious wood.

1160
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,835
You owe money like that,
you get a reputation.

1161
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:36,271
That's how I knew
how to find him.

1162
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:38,407
And now hopefully
we can get him some help.

1163
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:41,043
And get you
some help, too.

1164
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,179
This is my favorite part,
right here.

1165
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,581
Look at this.

1166
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:48,617
That isn't just card counting,
that's passing a bobo.

1167
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,819
Turns out, the old man's been
kiting counterfeit bills

1168
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:51,920
from Tunica to Nevada.

1169
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,189
They were about
to arrest him

1170
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:56,291
before I grabbed him up.

1171
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:58,961
In fact, I have him over at
the Intercontinental Hotel,

1172
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:00,495
just down the street.

1173
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,097
Here's the thing, Richie.

1174
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:06,602
Your dad owes $187,000 to some
guys that don't fuck around.

1175
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:09,004
But you're my man, and you
took some hits for me.

1176
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:10,739
And I don't forget that.

1177
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,077
So this is what I did.
I bought the debt.

1178
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,945
I own the paper
on your father.

1179
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,614
The only person who can
do anything to him now

1180
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,816
is me.

1181
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:24,086
Which is good news, because I would
never do anything like that.

1182
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:26,421
I hold the debt,
your dad stays healthy,

1183
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:28,624
and we can all go back
to exactly how it was.

1184
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:30,325
Okay?

1185
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,396
Yeah, thank you.

1186
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:35,764
I appreciate it.

1187
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:40,902
Richie?

1188
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,639
Uh, come in.

1189
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,176

1191
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,718
What do you think?
This is where they put me.

1192
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,886
It's a real soft spot, huh?

1193
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:58,854
It's real nice, Dad.

that he was stealing.

Any new industry,

it's like Russia

Okay. What are you
gonna do about it?
