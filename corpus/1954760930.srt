558
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:34,858
when even the castration program
doesn't work..

559
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,660
And I get fired?

560
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,165
- Seriously?

561
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,168
It's also my job,
and my life on the line!

562
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:51,841
- How dare you,
ugly piece of mutant shit

563
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,611
<i>talking to me like that?</i>

564
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,514
- I have been trying to
tell you for days now.

565
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:59,983
I have the answer
to all our problems!

566
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:04,521
We've got to make a human
centipede of our prisoners.

567
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:09,092
Sewn ass to mouth
sharing one digestive system.

568
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:14,964
No more prison fights, no more assaults
on guards, no more disrespect.

569
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,833
They will literally be
on their knees

570
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:20,770
begging for your mercy
and it's the ultimate deterrent

571
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:24,674
for those considering
a career in crime.

572
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,109
It's brilliant!

573
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,778
We don't gotta to deal
with their shit no more.

574
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,247
They just gotta deal
with each other's.

575
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,582
- What?

576
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:38,187
That B movie shit?

577
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,259
Impossible!

578
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,295
- No! It is possible.

579
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:49,032
That's why I let Daisy make
an appointment with Mr. Tom Six

580
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,000
creator of these films.

581
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:54,504
He claims that it's 100%
medically accurate!

582
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,875
- The man is still
in his potty stage.

583
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:02,445
A poop infatuated toddler.

584
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,147
You call him now

585
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:07,984
and tell him I don't speak
with a stupid filmmaker

586
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:10,753
about his poop fetish!

587
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,423
- Fine then, we'll get fired!

588
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,525
- You..

589
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:18,261
Are fired!

590
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,597
Right now!

591
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,200
- You know, Bill Boss,
I used to look up to you.

592
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,803
I used to idol-worship you.

593
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,838
I worked 10 years for you

594
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,442
and I grew this stupid
mustache to look like you.

595
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,712
But I know what you are.

596
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:39,816
You are a sadistic,
vile, asshole.

597
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:42,919
- Get out of my face.

598
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:47,490
You malignant midget!

599
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,505

Black, chicken slave niggers..

Mother fisting, baby raping
Mexican lowlifes.

<i>Me cago en la madre</i>

00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:12,468
Jewish goat fuckers.

615
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,340
Pubic hair bearded

617
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,182

[laughing]

625
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,925
How you all..

626
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:44,594
Got out of your cells?

627
00:47:44,596 --> 00:47:47,396
Go back to your cells,
immediately.

628
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,536
I only follow orders.

629
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:58,941
I just try to do my job.

630
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:02,278
Please forgive me and let me go.

631
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:08,150
I will pardon all of you!

632
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,686
No!

633
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:14,023
I just let you go..

634
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:17,360
Immediately, you can go.

Go, go!

See your loved ones.

638
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:33,542
I have a heart problem..

639
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:37,680
And diabetes mellitus!

640
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:44,987
Under stress
I could get a severe attack..

641
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:47,590
That would kill me!

But I'm not gonna do you
in your stinking ass.

00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,913
I'm gonna cut me a fresh hole

00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:14,250
in your soft kidney tissue.

649
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,851

<i>- Sir, Mr. Tom Six</i>

00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:18,874
- Dwight!

00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:33,923
- Didn't I fire you?

674
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,958
- I'm gonna give you
one last chance

675
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,593
and if you don't like
what you hear

676
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,328
then I'll quit myself!

677
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,066
- Uh-huh.

678
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:49,672
- Mr. Tom Six!
It's so great to meet you.

679
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:52,007
My name's Daisy, uh, I was
wondering if you could sign

680
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:53,676
an autograph for me
before you go in.

681
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,578
- Sure, babe.
- Thank you.

682
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,747
You're even more
handsome in person.

683
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,249
- Thanks.

684
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,419
- Uh, let me show you in.

685
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:07,490
Gentlemen, Mr. Tom Six.

686
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,595
- Ah, Mr. Six,
it's nice meet you.

687
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:14,630
- Hello, sir.
- My name is Dwight Butler.

688
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,799
This is my boss,
Mr. Bill Boss.

689
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,334
- Sir.

690
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,203
- Please take a seat.

691
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,940
- First of all, Mr. Six,
I'd like to say

692
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,309
congratulations on your movies.

693
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,112
They've become
a... a cultural mime.

694
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:32,581
I mean, there is
the "South Park" episode

695
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,583
of the Human Centipede.

696
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:38,687
And then there's the LA porn
parody, and the cat toys.

697
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:42,491
- I don't have
the time for this..

698
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,660
Fan shit shat.

699
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,328
[knock on door]

700
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,534
- Well, I'm sorry I'm late.

701
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:56,772
Prisoner 297 had a heart attack

702
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,175
and I had to resuscitate
him again.

703
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:02,778
But, um, he's stable now.

704
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,082
I.. Mr. Six, this is a big
pleasure 'cause I'm a big fan!

705
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:10,486
- Uh, thank you sir.

706
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:11,921
[groans]

707
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:13,756
<i>- Well, we are gathered</i>
<i>here today.</i>

708
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,824
Glad to investigate
the possibility

709
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:21,263
of applying Mr. Six's human
centipede idea to our prison.

710
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:23,933
I mean, is it
100% medically accurate?

711
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:29,605
- This is<i> my</i> desk!

712
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,609
In my headquarters!

713
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:36,445
At my penitentiary!

714
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,813
Wake up!

715
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:41,850
We're not in a movie
here playing some idiots!

716
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,186
- Well, it is 100%
medically accurate.

717
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:46,488
I consulted a real surgeon
in Amsterdam

718
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:49,091
and he made a very detailed
operation report for me

719
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,626
and he said he could
actually make

720
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:52,761
a human centipede
in his hospital.

721
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:55,598
I brought the, uh,
operation reports

722
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,366
and the drawings..

723
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:00,836
So maybe you can
have a look at that?

724
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,414
[clears throat]

725
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,515
- Okay, uh..

726
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,251
- What do you think, doc?

727
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:20,155
- Well, from what I see here,
uh, it looks..

728
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,258
Medically accurate.

729
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,592
- You're sure?

730
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:26,795
- You would have to give
anti-rejection medication

731
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,964
and there is always
the risk of infection

732
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:31,433
during the healing
process, but, uh..

733
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:36,005
Yeah, I'm sure.

734
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:38,007
- But what about the excretia?

735
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:41,610
- Well, the feces wouldn't be
contaminated by outside bacteria

736
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,345
because it would be going from

737
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,080
one digestive tract to another.

738
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:47,249
So it wouldn't be harmful.

739
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:50,319
But there wouldn't be
much nutritional value.

740
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:54,857
On the other hand if you gave
a series of, uh, injections

741
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:57,459
of fluids with plenty
of vitamins and minerals

742
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,296
I don't see why
someone couldn't survive

743
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,598
a lifetime in this position.

744
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,034
- Aah! Gentlemen.

745
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:09,672
[instrumental music]

746
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:14,243
This is a historical moment.

747
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:20,416
This is beyond
medieval torture!

748
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:23,452
Beyond castration!

749
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:28,324
The ultimate correction
nationwide.

750
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:34,196
We have business
on hand, gentlemen.

751
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,964
We start immediately.

752
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,800
- No, the surgery can't be done

753
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,269
like in Tom Six's movies.

754
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:42,771
We have to take into account
of the fact that

755
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,039
at the end of their sentence

756
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,974
the prisoners have
to be released

757
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,610
<i>without being mutilated.</i>

758
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:52,081
So I've been
thinking about this.

759
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:55,918
What we have is instead of
the pulling of the teeth

760
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,954
we have a gastro-intestinal
bite-ring

761
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,624
that holds the mouth open,
so they can't stop the feces

762
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,927
from coming into their system.

763
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:08,630
Instead of the cutting
of the knee ligaments

764
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:10,466
we simply inject

765
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:13,669
to induce temporary paralysis
in that joint.

766
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,772
Then, to attach the head

767
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:19,475
to the buttocks
of the person in front

768
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:22,111
<i>we have a system</i>
<i>of leather straps</i>

769
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:25,748
which can be adjusted,
pulled in tight and then undone

770
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,583
for when we release.

771
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:32,020
<i>At the end of their sentence</i>
<i>and taken out of the centipede</i>

772
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:35,691
<i>there's only a slight scar</i>
<i>round their mouth and anus.</i>

773
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:43,599
Well, doctor,
what do you think?

774
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,267
Is it possible?

775
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:48,103
- Very clever, Mr. Butler.

776
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:51,707
But this, all of this
is beginning to be

777
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:56,111
in serious conflict
with my Hippocratic oath.

778
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:01,583
If I back out of this,
I'm gonna get fired, aren't I?

779
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:06,021
- Very clever thinking,
Mr. Jones.

780
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,424
- You know, my original idea
for the Human Centipede films

781
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,993
was sewing a child molester's
mouth to the anus

782
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:14,129
of a fat truck driver, as
a punishment, so I love this.

783
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:16,298
- I just got
an even better idea

784
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,702
for our life-time-trash
and the death-row-scum.

785
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:26,141
But I'll talk
to my loyal doctor first.

786
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:31,113
- Gentlemen, you may use my human
centipede idea, but on one condition.

787
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:34,583
I have witnessed all the fake
latex stuff on my movie sets.

788
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:38,153
Now I insist on attending
one of your real

789
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,322
<i>mouth to anus operations.</i>

790
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:43,258
- Deal.

791
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,330
I put you in charge
of the whole operation, doctor!

792
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:53,035
Soon you'll lead..

793
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:57,940
Surgical teams all over
the States.

794
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,810
- Fantastic!

795
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:06,081
Uh, we are going to need
a much bigger surgical team.

796
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:09,151
We have to run blood workups
on all the prisoners,

797
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,854
uh, test their stool samples
for parasites.

798
00:58:11,856 --> 00:58:13,889
- Whatever you need, doc.

799
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:21,096
I've another brilliant idea.

800
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:26,768
We'll show the cockroaches
the two Human Centipede films

801
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:33,308
back to back
at their monthly film night

802
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,612
and then..

803
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:40,082
I'll announce them their fate.

804
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:43,752
- The prisoners will tear
this place apart.

805
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,989
We have to do this without the
fore knowledge of our clientele.

806
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,426
- Shut up, pooper.

807
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:59,935
- How dare you
turn your back on me?

812

814
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:32,167
- Come on, swallow it, bitch.

815
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:35,771
- No!
- Swallow.

- These films risk
causing harm.

822
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,434
They should be banned!

823
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:06,902

829
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:36,932

01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,689
on their fucking, fucking

924
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:44,359
fucking, fucking knees.
Ha ha ha.

925
01:07:47,998 --> 01:07:50,765
I'll explain.

926
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:53,535
This spectacular operation

927
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:55,603
only once.

928
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,472
We start

929
01:07:57,474 --> 01:08:00,141
with injections into the lig...

930
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:02,043
- Ligamenta patellae.

931
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:05,146
- Ligamenta patellae.

932
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:08,616
Paralyzing the ligaments
of your kneecaps.

933
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:11,619
So knee-extension

934
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:14,089
is no longer possible.

935
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:18,259
Your lips and anuses

936
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,862
are cut circular
along the border

937
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:24,165
between skin and mucosa,
the muc...

938
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,034
- Mucous-cutaneous.

939
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:29,270
- Mucous-cutaneous zone.

940
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,473
Then we combine

941
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:34,809
those circular mucosa
and skin parts

942
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:37,178
of anus and mouth

943
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:41,249
creating a human centipede

944
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:45,687
connected via
your gastric systems.

945
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,222
Gentlemen.

946
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:51,493
Put them to sleep.

947
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:03,471
- By the way,
what are your plans

948
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,574
for the life sentenced
and death row prisoners?

949
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,746
- Wait and wonder, peepheart.

950
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:20,522
How's it going, doc?

951
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:23,091
- Right on schedule,
five surgical teams

952
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:24,259
working round the clock.

953
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:26,528
Those teams creating
centipede segments

954
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,597
of three prisoners each,
which are then taken outside

955
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,766
to the hospital tents

956
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,602
and then they are sewn
into the final

957
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:37,205
larger human centipede chain.

958
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:40,808
- Marvelous, doc.

959
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,844
- Since I have you here..

960
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,749
What do you want to do
with this prisoner?

961
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,417
He has Crohn's disease.

962
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:50,685
[farting]

963
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:53,688
- What the fuck
is Crohn's disease?

964
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:57,292
- It's an inflammatory
bowel disorder.

965
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:59,327
The prisoner has
constant diarrhea.

966
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:03,665
- Who'll kiss his ass?

967
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,437
Our awesome..

968
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,574
Tattoo wasp!

969
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:16,711
The white, anal

970
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,280
sexing prostitute.

971
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:23,318
- Please.

972
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,986
<i>One more chance.</i>

973
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:28,256
Please don't sew me
into a human centipede.

974
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:29,357
I beg you.

975
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:30,758
- Yeah yeah.

976
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,126
[sniffles]

977
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:34,629
Your whining

978
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:37,899
makes my dick even harder.

979
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:46,007
Revenge is so sweet.

980
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:51,913
Take it into your sleep.

981
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,482
- We have another
problem at hand.

982
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,804
- That's fuckin' gross!

983
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,973
- I have a stoma

984
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,676
and you have a problem.

985
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:23,111
<i>Thank God.</i>

986
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,647
[speaking in foreign language]

987
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:28,483
Now I finally discovered
why they blessed me

988
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:31,452
with a lifetime stoma. Ha ha ha.

989
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,422
[laughs]

990
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:37,091
- This guy is repulsive.

991
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:39,160
Maybe it's a fake.

992
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,362
With Mexicans, you never know.

993
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:44,999
[grunts]

994
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:49,504
No fake.

995
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,040
No way to integrate him, doc?

996
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:54,842
- His rectum is sewn shut, no.

997
01:11:58,281 --> 01:12:00,114
- Finish him off then.

998
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:02,350
- I'm sorry.

999
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:05,353
But I have cooperated
with you and I will..

1000
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:07,255
Continue to cooperate.

1001
01:12:07,257 --> 01:12:10,725
But I will not
just kill prisoners!

1002
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:13,561
- Jesus Christ.

1003
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:17,765
Chicken shit!

1004
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:19,701
- Excuse me.

1005
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:21,536
I have work to do.

1006
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:30,044
- My friend, you don't match.

1007
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:32,647
I have to kill you.

1008
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:36,484
Take it fucking personally!

1009
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:39,654
[gunshot]

1010
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:42,924
Ooh.

1011
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:46,994
Ugh!

1012
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:49,931
Take my gun.

1013
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:57,271
Wash it, oil it, disinfect it.

1014
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:59,941
If I sniff the tiniest stink

1015
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,176
you'll suck a bullet out of it.

1016
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:09,083
- And what do you
want to do with him?

1017
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:12,320
- I am sick and tired
of your vegetables.

1018
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,490
[screams]

1019
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:17,058
[gunshot]

1020
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,434
- What the fuck!

1021
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:29,337
- Please, sir, can we go
and see Daisy now?

1022
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:37,745
Just look at her.

1023
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:41,115
She is the only beautiful and
sweet thing about this place.

1024
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:43,751
I think she should be treated
in a regular hospital.

1025
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,686
- No.

1026
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:48,956
I want my cock socket close.

1027
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,426
Beaten up women

1028
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:54,328
make me so horny.

1029
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:58,866
- Please, Bill, don't.

1030
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:01,269
- Jesus Christ.

1031
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:03,938
- I beg you.

1032
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:09,644
I...I love her.

1033
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:13,080
- Even the corpse of a spastic
would turn you down.

1034
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:14,682
Fuck off!

1035
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:17,819
Ah!

1036
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:20,688
[intense music]

1037
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:39,540
I'll make you
squirt even in a coma.

1038
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:55,022
- Alright, we're all done.

1039
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:56,657
- Good job.

1040
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,510
[indistinct yelling]

1041
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:27,088
I want you to make sure

1042
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:30,124
that the world premiere
of the first

1043
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:32,960
human-prison centipede

1044
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:35,263
is guaranteed

1045
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:38,432
to take place the moment

1046
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:41,135
our communist governor

1047
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:44,372
appears at the gate
to destroy us!

1048
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,274
- Well, there is only

1049
01:15:46,276 --> 01:15:48,442
16 more prisoners left

1050
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:50,111
to undergo the procedure.

1051
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:53,247
After that
the human-prison centipede

1052
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,950
will be finally complete

1053
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:58,586
on time and under budget.

1054
01:15:58,588 --> 01:16:00,821
- They did their magic.

1055
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,324
[sniffles]

1056
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:06,494
Thank God for Africa!

1057
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:12,033
Thank God for female
circumcision!

1058
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,343
Private rehearsal!

1059
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:31,752
Let's hear what
our zombie governor

1060
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:34,488
will have to say.

1061
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:58,646
- May I offer you a genuine

1062
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:01,082
Dominican Republic cigar?

1063
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:04,852
- I only smoke Cuban cigars

1064
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:06,821
best in the world.

1065
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:09,156
No! Just kidding.

1066
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:13,928
After having seen the miracle

1067
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:18,666
of the first
human-prison centipede

1068
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:21,102
I'll never again touch

1069
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:24,271
a communistic cigar from Cuba

1070
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:29,343
because you, Sir William Boss

1071
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:32,546
you are the new American hero.

1072
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,617
You are in the Hall of Fame

1076

Thanks to you.

1077
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:47,261
Our glorious nation

1078
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:49,830
will be the example

1079
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,298
to the world again.

1080

A proud, safe nation

<i>Your idea, Sir William</i>

1083

You will be honored personally

the United States of America.

Mr. Dwight Butler

1089
01:18:20,596 --> 01:18:22,897
it was his brilliant idea.

1090
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,467
- Oh, yeah.

1091
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:28,335
You did it.

1092
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:37,111
You fucking..

1093
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:39,547
Fucking did it.

to see the real
mouth to ass operation.

1106

Prove all the skeptics wrong.

1107
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:24,125
It is 100% medically accurate.

01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:21,942
and our friends on death row.

1293
01:31:21,944 --> 01:31:24,377
Now..

1294
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:26,913
Is that a deterrent?

1295
01:31:39,127 --> 01:31:41,194
This man..

1296
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:44,364
Has just
finished his sentence..

1297
01:31:45,267 --> 01:31:47,467
And already checked out

1298
01:31:47,469 --> 01:31:49,369
of the centipede chain.

1299
01:31:49,371 --> 01:31:51,905
Ready to go home.

1300
01:31:55,444 --> 01:31:57,043
All what is left

1301
01:31:57,045 --> 01:31:59,746
are a few little scars

1302
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:03,416
around his mouth and anus.

1303
01:32:03,418 --> 01:32:06,186
Another big advantage

1304
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:09,356
because other people can see

1305
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:11,358
by these little stigmas

1306
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,326
that he was integrated

1307
01:32:13,328 --> 01:32:16,096
in a prison centipede.

1308
01:32:16,098 --> 01:32:19,399
Another huge deterrent, right?

1309
01:32:22,104 --> 01:32:24,771
How are you doing?

1310
01:32:24,773 --> 01:32:27,774
[speaking in foreign language]

1311
01:32:41,256 --> 01:32:43,356
Good luck, my friend.

1312
01:32:46,995 --> 01:32:50,664
Stay clean!

1313
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:54,534
You see?
It really works.

1314
01:32:55,971 --> 01:32:59,673
What do you think, sir?

1315
01:32:59,675 --> 01:33:01,875
- This..

1316
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:04,210
This is a violation
of human rights.

1317
01:33:04,212 --> 01:33:06,580
It's certainly
a violation of federal ethics!

1318
01:33:06,582 --> 01:33:08,748
Oh, God, I am fucked.

1319
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:12,185
You insane freaks will get
the death penalty for this.

1320
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:18,124
- Sir, you're dead right.

1321
01:33:18,126 --> 01:33:21,695
But in fact,
it was Mr. But..

1322
01:33:21,697 --> 01:33:23,930
- This is heights.
This is too much.

1323
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:25,932
This is too much.

1324
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:32,672
- You got the wrong man!

1325
01:33:34,509 --> 01:33:36,443
Fuck!

1326
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:39,412
[dramatic music]

1327
01:34:00,469 --> 01:34:03,503
[music continues]

1328
01:34:23,358 --> 01:34:26,359
[music continues]

1329
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:49,849
[music continues]

1330
01:34:52,821 --> 01:34:54,421
- Please, don't.

1331
01:34:54,423 --> 01:34:58,191
- What an epic

1332
01:34:58,193 --> 01:35:01,027
glorious moment, huh?

1333
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,529
When do you think we can start

1334
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:05,365
the national surgical campaign

1335
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:08,234
'cause I am so fucking ready.

1336
01:35:11,006 --> 01:35:12,939
What is the matter?

1337
01:35:12,941 --> 01:35:15,909
[gunshot]

1338
01:35:19,147 --> 01:35:22,148
[dramatic music]

1339
01:35:27,789 --> 01:35:30,824
[groaning]

1340
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:45,371
[dramatic music]

1341
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:51,511
[gunshot]

1342
01:36:15,303 --> 01:36:18,338
[crying]

1343
01:36:25,247 --> 01:36:28,214
[dramatic music]

1344
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:48,668
- Gentlemen..

1345
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:52,205
This is exactly
what America needs.

1346
01:36:54,943 --> 01:36:57,644
This may even
get me elected president.

1347
01:36:57,646 --> 01:36:58,678
You've convinced me.

1348
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,080
It's genius.

1349
01:37:03,585 --> 01:37:06,820
Don't change a goddamn thing.

1350
01:37:06,822 --> 01:37:08,688
My pals in DC..

1351
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:11,324
They won't believe
their near-sighted eyeballs.

1352
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:14,327
[laughing]

1353
01:37:20,202 --> 01:37:22,202
[instrumental music]

1354
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:26,105
- Yep, my idea!

1355
01:37:26,107 --> 01:37:28,942
- You are..

1356
01:37:28,944 --> 01:37:31,911
Absolutely right, Dwight.

1357
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:38,251
You're indeed a genius.

1358
01:37:38,253 --> 01:37:41,387
You came up with the idea.

1359
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:46,159
You deserve every credit.

1360
01:37:47,929 --> 01:37:50,830
Give me a hug, Dwighty!

1361
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:53,833
[instrumental music]

1362
01:38:06,915 --> 01:38:09,015
[gunshot]

1363
01:38:44,653 --> 01:38:47,654
[screaming]

1364
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:26,492
[instrumental music]

1365
01:41:41,463 --> 01:41:44,497
[music continues]
