[Charles Trenet
sings Boum in French]

00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,270
[dog moans]

4
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,246
[female voice]
My name is Amy.

5
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,451
And yes, at college,
I blew my dog.

6
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,088
I don't know why,

7
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,791
maybe it was just
out of boredom

8
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,766
or just some kind
of dumb experiment.

9
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,530
Like knowing
something is hot
but you touch it,

10
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,697
and you're surprised
when you get burned.

11
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,706
Ugh.

12
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,436
I'm not into bestiality
in any way.

13
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,240
No, no, no.

14
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,446
It was just something
completely stupid.

15
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,782
I was full of guilt but,

16
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,116
at the same time,
as disgusting as it was,

17
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,624
another part of me
kind of thought
it was funny.

18
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,421
I could never tell anyone.
Anyone!

19
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,396
Not friends, although it'd be
a hell of an icebreaker
at a cocktail party.

20
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:49,697
Anyone here besides me
know what canine semen
tastes like?

21
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,834
I couldn't tell
any boyfriend.

22
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,839
Men are insecure
about their penises.

23
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,842
There's no need to bring
the whole animal kingdom
into it.

24
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,148
As the years went by,
when it popped
into my mind,

25
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,879
it was like something
that happened
to someone else.

26
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,046
Like a movie I had watched,
not starred in.

27
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:13,252
I never had to tell
any boyfriends because
I was never that serious

28
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,624
that I felt the need
to be totally honest.

29
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,684
Until now.

30
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,121
Until John.

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,227
And that is why
my life was turning to shit.

32
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,704
(male voice)
Penny for your thoughts.

33
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,104
Where did you go?

34
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,163
Sorry.

35
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,607
What were you
thinking?

36
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,666
Nothing.

37
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,541
You were thinking
about something.

38
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,911
A--friend.

39
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,949
A friend?

40
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,348
A boyfriend
you haven't told me about?

41
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,046
No, just a--

42
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,611
companion.

43
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,180
Ahh.

44
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,520
Do you love me?

45
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,992
More than anything.

46
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,619
How much?

47
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,722
I love you more
than anything
in the whole wide world.

48
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,959
Good.

49
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,729
Why?
What's this about?

50
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,202
Nothing.

51
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,568
All right.

52
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,705
You all finished, Steve?

53
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,506
Ah, right.

54
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,444
So, would you please?

55
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:13,679
Oh, my God.
You are such a baby.
He's not even my dog.

56
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,221
Ugh.
I'm gonna need
another bag.

57
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,183
You sure your dog did this
and not some hobo?

58
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,892
Yeah, a hobo's
would smell better.

59
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,028
You're gonna pay for this.
I am not carrying it.

60
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,857
Whatever happened
to your dog?

61
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,266
I gave him away.

62
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,325
Why?

63
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,304
He got too big.

64
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,273
Oh.

65
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:41,502
Hey.

66
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,445
Hey.

67
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,883
So...my first byline.

68
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,749
I'm so proud.
Where is it?

69
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,528
Now it's a short piece, so...

70
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,021
It's a start.

71
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,837
It's a great start.

72
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,779
Yes.

73
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,478
Yes. Yes!

74
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,610
Yeah?

75
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,676
Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,981
Wait, wait, wait!

77
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,581
You gotta read
the fine print first.

78
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,564
[soft music]

79
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,844
Here.

80
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,019
It fits.

81
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,335
You know
you have a nice penis?

82
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,766
Thank you.

83
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,572
And you're my best friend.

84
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,007
You're my best friend.

85
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,810
I feel like
I could tell you anything.

86
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,483
Me, too.

87
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,046
When I was a boy,

88
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,889
and I played with myself,
the first time I came,

89
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,861
I thought I broke
my bits.

90
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,328
How old were you?

91
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,865
Twenty.

92
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:41,922
Nine.

93
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:42,990
Twenty nine.

94
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,195
No! Nine!

95
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,264
Tell me a secret.

96
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,832
Tell me the weirdest thing
you've ever done.

97
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,845
Something that you
wouldn't tell anybody.

98
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,410
I don't like
this game.

99
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,116
What?

100
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,826
Oh, come on,
we're gonna get married soon,
we shouldn't have secrets.

101
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,998
Oh, now this is really
gonna drive me nuts.

102
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,730
I love everything that made
you you, you don't have
to be ashamed.

103
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,333
Are you sure?

104
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,966
Yes.

105
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,510
Okay.

106
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,643
Well

107
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,178
One time

108
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,325
when I was
in college

109
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,383
I...

110
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,357
You what?

111
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,864
Yeah?

112
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,707
I slept with
my girlfriend Linda.

113
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:02,205
Slept-slept?
'Cause I slept with my brother,
Brad, till I was five.

114
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,270
No!

115
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,340
Sex.

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,414
Really?
How did that happen?

117
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:16,756
We were just out
late one night, drinking.

118
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,128
And one thing
led to another.

119
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,259
Ooh.

120
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,203
(narrating)
I had never had sex with
Linda, or any woman.

121
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,502
The idea of sex
without a penis
is like--

122
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:32,567
a sandwich without meat.
Felt a little bad
lying to him but--

123
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,670
on the upside,
John liked it,

124
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,777
and I got fucked good
because of it.

125
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,975
(Ed)
Hey!

126
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,883
How's the gorgeous dame
business been treating you?

127
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,215
Oh, not too bad.

128
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,346
Mind if I join you?

129
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,253
Have a seat.

130
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,255
Yeah, what do you like
most about teaching?

131
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,322
Hmm, I would have to say
the microwave food.

132
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,389
Ah-hah.

133
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,457
You?

134
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,333
I would have to say

135
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,736
pretending that you like
all the kids the same

136
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,637
when some of them
are real assholes.

137
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,174
And the microwave food.

138
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,007
Oh, yeah.

139
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,377
How's John?

140
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,977
Great.

141
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,523
Good.

142
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,493
What's wrong?
Is he cheating?

143
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,551
No!

144
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,120
If he was,
I'd have to give him
the, you know--

145
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,893
sleepin' pill.

146
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,696
How important do you think
it is to be totally honest
in a relationship?

147
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,171
If you want
the relationship to last,
nothing but the truth.

148
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,405
Even if it's gonna hurt
the other person?

149
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,480
I don't know,
I think honesty
is overrated.

150
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:49,351
Look, I love Beth,
but the first time
we got together,

151
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,617
she wanted me
to suck her toes.

152
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,852
I wouldn't
so she got hurt.

153
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,156
Why not?
Men put their faces
in worse places.

154
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,061
Oh, but her feet
stink really bad.

155
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,860
She's super clean,
but her feet stink worse
than any dude's.

156
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,133
The first time
she took off her shoes,
I almost passed out.

157
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,504
It smelled like
she had been making
shit wine.

158
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,176
You didn't tell her that?

159
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,801
Hell, yeah.

160
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:13,936
How did she take it?

161
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,880
Badly, but now, she knows
that I don't suck her toes

162
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,439
not because
I don't love her,

163
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,246
but because
her feet stink.

164
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,653
Do you suck
her toes now?

165
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,453
Uhh--no.

166
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,062
If you want
the relationship to last,

167
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,099
you gotta be
brutally honest.

168
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,832
[school bell ringing]

169
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,576
(Amy)
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

170
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,044
Have a great time.
Call me when
you get back.

171
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,740
I will.
Hey!

172
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,282
(Amy)
Linda's lending me
her bag for our trip.

173
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,476
Cool.
You leaving?

174
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,540
Yeah.

175
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,745
Bye.

176
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,347
Okay.

177
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,120
See ya.
Say hi to your mom
for me.

178
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,960
Okay, let's hit
the road.

179
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,466
Go away,
you're gross.

180
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,558
What's wrong?

181
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,863
Do we have to take
Steve?

182
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,403
Nobody could
watch him.

183
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,631
What's bothering you?

184
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,735
Nothing's
bothering me. Steve!

185
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,867
Calm down, Steve.
Find your own bitch.

186
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,376
I need to smoke.

187
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,673
So smoke.

188
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,544
I can't smoke.
My parents don't know
I smoke.

189
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,881
I'm not driving
five hours in a car
without you smoking.

190
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,715
Blame me,
tell them
I smoke.

191
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,415
They're not gonna be
too thrilled
that you smoke either.

192
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,958
[soft music]

193
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,226
(John)
Baby, how
can you not know

194
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,232
where your
parents' house is?

195
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,996
I never spent time
driving to it,
only away from it.

196
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,665
Getting cold feet?
'Cause it feels like
you're mad at me.

197
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,039
No! I--
I love you.

198
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,010
Well, what's
the problem then?

199
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,675
Nothing, I just--
get nervous
around my parents, you know?

200
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,015
My mom is really sweet,
my dad is really smart,
they just--

201
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,554
think I'm perfect.

202
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,089
I'm the one who's
supposed to be nervous.

203
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,751
My dad wanted
to be a writer, too.

204
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,988
You told him
I wrote?

205
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,859
I told him
you worked for a paper.

206
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,094
Honey, I deliver
a newspaper.

207
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,035
It's not even a newspaper,
it's a weekly.
A free weekly.

208
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,437
That's great.
He's gonna think
I'm a bum.

209
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,637
No, they're gonna love you.
They have to love you.
They're my parents.

210
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:30,239
Besides, they reserve
their strongest criticisms
for me.

211
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,415
(John)
I'm so fucking nervous.

212
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,218
(Amy)
Oh, that's
another thing.

213
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,691
My mom is really religious
so we don't swear
in front of her.

214
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,695
By we,
I mean you.

215
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,358
We don't swear or smoke,
are you sure
these are your parents?

216
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,627
Yes.

217
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,168
Shoulda hired
a Sherpa.

218

[Amy chuckles]

219
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,768
(Amy)
One second.
All right.

220
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,446
You ready?

221
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,777
No.

222
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,214
Kiss me.

Hi, Mom!

00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,396
Hi, Daddy.

227
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,494
You must be John.

228
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,803
Hello, sir.

229
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,934
I give hugs, John.

230
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,171

(John)
Oh, fuck!

235
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,621
Sorry, I didn't
mean to say it.
I'll get you a new pot.

236
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,668
The dog was in the car
way too long.

237
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,430
Let's go inside.

238
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,267
Yeah!

We were about
to give up on you.

240

(father)
You get lost?

241
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,376
I told you to get
the directions from the Web.

242
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,847
I thought
I'd remember.

243
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,543
That's our Dizzy.

244
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,586
Honey, don't bite
your lip.

And who is this
offending beast?

246
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,547
(Amy)
John's dog.

247
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,455
We didn't want
to leave him at home.

248
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,515
His name is Steve.

249
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,893
Steve.
Hi, Steve.

250
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,292
Where do you guys
keep your paper towels?

251
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,597
I'm gonna clean up
that mess outside.

252
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,330
I'll give you a hand.

253
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,968
Whoo.
Let me look at you.

254
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,445
Ooh.
You look so pretty!
Are you eating?

255
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,447
Yes, Mom.

256
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,285
I'm really sorry about this.
You must think
I'm an idiot.

257
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:55,123
I'm not upset
about the plant
or the dog mess.

258
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,027
But John, while
you're staying here,

259
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,123
I'm gonna have to ask you
to watch the potty mouth.

260
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,863
I'm no shrinking violet,
I like to curse myself.

But at the stag night,
and the whatnot.

262
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,603
Not around Amy's mother,
swearing upsets her.

263
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,472
Of course. Sir.

264
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,537
Amy's mother
is very old-fashioned.

265
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,078
I'm the only man
she's ever slept with.

266
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:27,254
I'm not naive, John,
I know that you and Amy
are probably having sex.

267
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,353
But I am gonna have to ask you
while you're a guest here,

268
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,762
to sleep
in separate rooms.

269
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,527
Out of respect
for her mother.

270
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,502
Yeah, of course,
I wouldn't have it
any other way, sir.

271

And thanks
for having us.

How you doing?

Dougie has been
living with us.

282
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,096
When were you
here last?

283
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,435

Christmas.

He's been here
for eight months.

285
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,300
He lost his job.

286
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,314
I didn't lose it.
Spicks and the niggers
with the quotas took it.

your mother!

his girlfriend, too.

Yes.

to give your mother
a nervous breakdown?

call her "diamond girl"?

has been fun,

should all turn in.

under this roof.

you wearing?

I should be wearing a nightcap

making this face.

00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,360
I told you about that stuff.
Why'd you pretend
not to know?

343

It was fun
watching your parents
be so proud of you.

It's embarrassing.

00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,161
[soft music]

357
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,798
[thud]

358
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,374
Meth?

359
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,288
Do you want some?

360
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,621
I'm good.

361
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,057
You don't party?

362
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,298
Yeah, I party,
just not meth.

363
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:16,896
Hm.

364
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,550
Don't say anything
to my family.

365
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,645
Okay?

366
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,220
[sighs]

367
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,955
You know, I was
the perfect one
before she came around.

368
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,795
And then,

369
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,462
after that I just
couldn't do anything right.

370
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,537
I'm sure your parents
love you both very much.

371
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,441
[choked]
Mm-hmm.

372
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,880
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

373
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,544
Mm-hmm.

374
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,309
[sighs]

375
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,279
Say something.

376
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,254
What?

377
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,690
Say something.

378
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,959
Something.

379
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,193
(recorded voice)
Something.

380
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,257
Something.

381
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,659
Something.

382
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,104
Something.

383
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:26,008
Something.
Something.
Something.

384
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:30,242
[faster]
Something. Something.
Something. Something.

385
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:34,313
Tump. Tump. Tump...

386
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,320
(Douglas)
I got this
at a garage sale.

387
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,148
It's so sweet.

388
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,928
F ive bucks.
They didn't know
what they had.

389
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,861
[distorted voice]
Something.

390
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,496
I just have to learn
how to use it.

391
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,335
And teach myself
how to play.

392
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,068
And then, l's thinkin',

393
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,408
I could, like--
lay down some tracks--

394
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,846
[distorted]
Something.
Something.

395
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:07,817
You know, I could be
like a, like a--

396
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,623
um, recording star.

397
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,625
Something.
Something.

398
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,183
[keyboard notes]

399
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:20,061
[mimics keyboard notes]
Hello, hello.

400
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,898
There is no limit
to what this does.

401
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,699
[strange noises
come from keyboard]

402
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,761
(Douglas)
Ow.

403
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,828
(recording)
Ow.

404
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,499
- Ow.
- Ow.

405
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,700
Ow.

406
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,509
[popping noise]

407
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:42,485
[music]

408
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,222
[popping]

409
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:58,928
[birds chirping]

410
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,302
[dog barking]

411
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:10,543
[music from screen]

412
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,449
Wake up.

413
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,950
Mom and l
made breakfast.

414
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,819
Wake up, honey.
Your sister and l
made breakfast.

415
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,447
Go away.

416
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:24,088
Cheese and crackers,
he's a grouch
in the morning.

417
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,427
Well, don't take
too long.

418
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,493
How'd you sleep?

419
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,069
Oh, just great.
Do you know
he smokes meth?

420
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,402
You're serious?

421
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,670
Yes! In this room.
He offered me some.

422
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,075
Right before
he sang into his piano
all night.

423
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,135
What?

424
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:42,942
Don't ask.

425
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,441
He's got
some chops, though.

426
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,754
That was delicious,
ladies.

427
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,158
What's Daddy doing?

428
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,857
Oh, the neighbor's tree
fell into our yard.

429
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,532
Why don't you
go talk to him?

430
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,795
Not now,
he's got an ax.

431
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,936
I tell my neighbor
he needs to trim his trees
and he ignores me.

432
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,666
That's all right.
I got it.

433
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,735
Now, I have to build
a whole new fence.

434
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,006
Well, I guess good fences
don't build good neighbors.

435
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,778
Frost wasn't talking
about my douche-bag neighbor
when he wrote that.

436
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,662
He's going to ask Dad
if you can marry him.

437
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,426
How did you know?

438
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,989
He has that fear
in his eyes

439
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,900
that your father had
when he asked Grandpa.

440
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,402
Actually, I have
a confession to make.

441
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,067
I'm not really a writer.

442
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,235
Oh?

443
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,836
I just deliver
the Free Times.

444
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,940
I'm--I'm trying to write.
I submit my stuff
all the time.

445
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,349
The Chinese
have a saying.

446
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,410
Find a job
that you love

447
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,389
and you'll never have to work
a day in your life.

448
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,191
You must love teaching.

449
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,415
I hate it.

450
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,359
I always have hated it.

451
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,857
Every second of it.

452
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,031
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

453
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:11,991
You're young.

454
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,630
Don't give up
on this writing.

455
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,468
You don't have
any responsibilities.

456
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,907
You'll have plenty of time
to settle down later.

457
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,745
I haven't been
honest with him.

458
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,549
About what?

459
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,523
I can't tell you.

460
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,063
Is it a sex thing?

461
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,604
Honey, that's
not a big deal.

462
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,665
We all have
those kind of secrets.

463
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,040
Mother!

464
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,806
Well,

465
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,280
there were things I did
before I met your father

466
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,215
that he
doesn't know about.

467
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,082
Jesus.

468
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,583
My son is on drugs.

469
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,056
Pardon me?

470
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,753
I'd kick him out, but
his mother won't let me.

471
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,059
She sticks up for him.

472
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,922
I don't know
what happened to that kid.

473
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,094
I wish--

474
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,694
I wish he were more
like his sister.

475
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,262
She's never let me down.

476
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:27,971
Daddy always said
he was the first person
you ever slept with.

477
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,446
Technically,
I wasn't lying.

478
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,240
My daughter is
one of the few things

479
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,616
that brings me joy
in my life.

480
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,086
I think
the world of her.

481
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,116
I do, too, sir.

482
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,393
When I was a young girl,
living in Memphis,

483
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:48,524
one night, my girlfriends
and I were at an arcade
when it was closing,

484
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,832
and this man came up
to us and...

485
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,735
told us that...

486
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,501
Elvis would like us
to stay.

487
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,734
You had sex
with Elvis?

488
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,276
Will you let me
tell my story?

489
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,333
Yes.

490
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,541
That's why
I want to marry her.

491
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,316
We were invited
back to Graceland,

492
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,825
and Elvis asked
my friend and l

493
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,795
to join him
in the bedroom.

494
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,560
[whispering]
And you had sex
with him?

495
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,068
Well, yes and no.

496
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,765
What about the writing?
Haven't you heard
anything I've said to you?

497
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,410
He just played
with himself
and watched.

498
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:40,884
You wrestled another woman
in your underwear
while Elvis beat off?

499
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,886
And you didn't
even get laid?

500
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:47,180
Look, if I was to die
and never be published,
I could live with that.

501
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:52,662
But I couldn't live
without marrying
your daughter.

502
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,496
I had sex
with Roy Orbison, too.

503
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,505
Roy Orbison!

504
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,976
Oh, no!

505
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,182
He was cute
when he was young.

506
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,883
Oh, no, Mom,
Roy Orbison
was never cute.

507
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,325
You're right.
He was never cute.

508
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,556
You never told Daddy.

509
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,190
Mm-mm.

510
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,360
Sometimes I wish I had.

511
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,064
It bothers me
a lot, but...

512
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:38,371
I was never able
to work up the courage.

513
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,639
You know, John,

514
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,978
there are some men,

515
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,415
crueler men, perhaps,

516
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,444
who would just let you hang
in the wind for a while.

517
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,988
But I give you
my blessing.

518
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,021
Thank you, sir.

519
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,793
What should I do?

520
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,458
Tell him.

521
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:07,437
Tell him
whatever this thing is.

522
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,838
If he can't accept it,
he's the wrong guy.

523
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:16,445
Don't carry it around
half your life like I have.

524
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:20,382
I still feel dirty
and guilty.

525
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,644
Especially when
I hear Pretty Woman.

526
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,757
Or when wrestling
is on.

527
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,424
Look at them.

528
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,798
They have no idea--
don't smile!

529
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,308
They have no idea
what we're talking about.

530
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,641
It's killing them, huh?

531
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,840
Yeah.

532
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,883
Just look sad.

533
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,353
Look sad.

534
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,091
They don't look happy.

535
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,119
Just smile.
Just keep smiling.

536
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,788
Okay.

537
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,562
I hope everybody's
hungry.

538
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:11,624
(Amy)
I am.

539
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,294
[doorbell rings]

540
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,106
Folks. Sister.

541
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,172
Hey, Randy.

542
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,843
Guy.

543
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,888
(mother)
Hello, Randy.

544
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,547
Hi.

545
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,615
This is John.

546
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:35,716
See ya.

547
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,522
Why don't you boys
stay and eat?

548
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,357
It does look
pretty tempting.

549
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,694
Yeah, sit down,
join us.

550
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,701
(mother)
Dougie!

551
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,430
Eat.

552
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,538
So what are you boys
up to tonight?

553
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,912
Uh, gotta see
a guy--

554
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,248
about a--thing.

555
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,091
Job--jobby--thing.

556
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,417
What?

557
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:14,562
Yeah, this dude--
It's gonna be good.
Right, buddy?

558
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,796
Oh, I see.

559
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,833
Let's eat.

560
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,936
(Randy)
That was delicious.

561
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,310
Come on,
let's go.

562
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,781
Oh, why
don't you boys stay?

563
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,048
Yes, stay.
We could, uh, do a puzzle.

564
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,749
A puzzle?
That'd be great.

565
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,883
Oh.

566
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,963
Are you against fun?

567
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,853
(Amy)
First, we need to find
all the edge pieces.

568
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,120
I wish these monkeys
weren't all the same color.

569
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,661
(Randy)
You know what monkeys hate?
Midgets.

570
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,855
Really?

571
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,524
They see them
as a threat
and try to kill them.

572
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,466
And midgets know it, too,
and are scared of monkeys.

573
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,524
Ha!

574
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,900
A friend
worked on a set

575
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,529
they had a midget
and a monkey

576
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:32,133
and the midget said,
"Hell no, I'm not
working with that thing."

577
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,943
(Randy)
The monkey went--
not ape shit but--

578
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,141
You know
what I mean.

579
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,747
See you, man.

580
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,615
Thanks for
coming over, Randy.

581
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,319
Where's my rock?

582
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,554
I was trying to tell you
before dinner.
Nobody has any.

583
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,756
Sorry, man.

584
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:56,829
Hey, is your sister
serious about that dude?

585
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,301
Seemed kinda
like a cock.

586
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,001
(Randy)
Just one man's opinion.

587
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,223
[blows]

588
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:36,266
[spraying]

589
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,080
[sniffs]

590
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,241
[soft knocking]

591
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,548
What took you
so long?

592
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,018
Where are we going?

593
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,555
Just come on.

594
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,519
[Amy giggles]

595
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,584
(John)
Wow!

596
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,123
(Amy)
This car's been here
since I was a kid.

597
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,597
Get in.

598
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,432
In the back.

599
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,028
Okay.

600
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,627
What did my dad say?

601
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,753
That he loves you.

602
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:32,955
Yeah.

603
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,691
And that
he hates teaching.

604
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,529
And I forget
what else he said.

605
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,796
Tell me another story.

606
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,200
What kind of story?

607
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,573
Like you
and your friend Linda.

608
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,078
Oh, that kind of story.

609
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,584
Yeah, that kind of story.

610
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,618
You tell me
a story.

611
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,787
Okay.

612
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,059
Here's something
I lived with
over the years.

613
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,532
When I was at camp,

614
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:15,004
me and about
five other guys,

615
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,973
we played
"shoot the cookie."

616
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,873
What's that?

617
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,411
Shoot the cookie.

618
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,379
It's where we all
stand around--

619
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:29,443
and beat off on a cookie,
and the last one to finish
has to eat it.

620
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,420
Did you lose?

621
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,083
Oh, my God!

622
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,623
Oh, I can't believe
I told you that.

623
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,685
No, it's okay.

624
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,528
Why did I tell you that
after you still haven't
told me

625
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,534
your big dark secret?

626
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,033
Okay.

627
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,638
What? Come on,
it can't be that gross.

628
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,078
Well...

629
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,980
What?

630
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,385
Well, a long time ago,
when I was at school,

631
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,026
and I was alone...

632
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,893
Yeah.

633
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,128
but I wasn't alone.

634
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,429
Who were you with?

635
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,761
Rufus.

636
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,434
Rufus?

637
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,971
Rufus, my dog.

638
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:33,772
And he was lying
on his back,

639
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,945
and I was staring
at his penis,

640
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,191
and--

641
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,663
I sucked him off!
[laughs]

642
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,383
No.

643
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,218
You didn't just
tell me that. No.

644
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:27,297
[laughing nervously]
I was kidding,
it never happened.

645
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,599
I was trying
to make you laugh!

646
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,407
Oh, my God,
well, you didn't.

647
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,683
I don't know
why I did it.
I never did it again.

648
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,219
I can't breathe.

649
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,966
I feel like
I'm going to throw up.

650
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,643
You won't let me
touch you?

651
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,083
You fuck dogs?

652
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:24,093
No! It happened just once,
and I never did it again!

653
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:28,029
I didn't fuck him,
I just sucked him off.
It was just a dumb thing.

654
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,361
Oh.

655
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,334
Hold me.

656
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,567
Please hold me.

657
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,845
You forced me to tell you,
and now you hate me.

658
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,603
No.

659
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,584
Hold me back, then.

660
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,787
Kiss me.

661
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,686
You can't even kiss me.

662
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,990
Yeah.

663
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,864
I wish
I were dead.

664
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,708
[moan]

665
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,475
[spraying]

666
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,866
[spraying]

667
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,062
[inhales deeply]

668
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,636
[sobs]

669
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,831
Baby?

670
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,242
Baby, what's wrong?

671
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,746
John.

672
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,750
Did you have
a fight?

673
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,786
Oh.
Oh, there, there.

674
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,290
I'm sure
it's not a big deal.

675
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,819
It is a big deal,
Mom. I told him,
and now he hates me.

676
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,457
He doesn't hate you.

677
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:14,061
So you're not
a virgin. Big deal.
I doubt he is either.

678
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,365
Do you want me
to go talk to him?

679
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:22,740
No!
No, please, don't do that.
You'll just make it worse.

680
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,144
It might help.

681
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,616
No, really, please,
promise me you won't!

682
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,084
All right.

683
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,014
John?

684
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,525
May I speak with you
for a moment?

685
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,564
Privately.

686
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,571
I heard
about your argument.

687
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,374
Are you high?

688
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,352
Upsetting my daughter
like that?!

689
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:15,160
I want you to say
you're sorry to her.

690
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:22,097
Do you know how hard
it was for her
to tell you that?

691
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,888
[music]

692
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,697
Good morning, John.

693
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,471
Good morning.

694
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,368
Hi.

695
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:00,933
Hi.

696
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,871
[whistling]

697
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,507
Well, good morning.

698
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,779
You're up early.

699
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:12,648
(Mom)
Eggs?

700
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,714
Yeah, yeah,
thanks, Mom.

701
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,691
(father)
Good morning.

702
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,699
That was fun last night,
wasn't it?

703
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,200
What?

704
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,395
The puzzle.

705
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,301
Oh, yeah.

706
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,865
Mom, I like them
sunny side up.

707
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:33,909
Just eat them.

708
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,506
That's not
how I like 'em.

709
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,641
Why do you have
to be such a jerk?

710
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,916
Um, I know
something about Amy.

711
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,928
Something dirty she did.

712
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,434
(mother)
Dougie, that's enough.

713
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:02,700
She's not the angel
you guys make her
out to be.

714
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,468
Be quiet.

715

00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,223
What did you say?

717
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:28,060
That Amy sucked
a dog's cock.

718
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,592
Ah!

(father)
You pathetic piece
of shit!

721
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,430
It's your fault
for being
soft on him.

722
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:41,900
No! No!

723
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,003
(mother)
Stop them.

724
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,344
(Doug)
You think I'm fucking?
Amy's a fucked up whore.

725
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,018
(Amy)
Daddy, stop it,
he's not lying!

726
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,076
It's true!

727
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,620
I did it, l--

728
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,219
I did
what he said I did.

729
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,106
John and l
are leaving.

730
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,869
I love you, Daddy.

731
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,172
Yeah.

732
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,722
(mother)
This is the first time,

733
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:33,593
since the day
you were born,

734
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,861
that I'm ashamed
to be your mother.

You ate a cookie

750
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,413
Yeah!
Human sperm!

751
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,750
Oh, what?
Now you care
who knows?

752
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,084
You forced me
to tell you!

753
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,819
Not about blowing a dog!
What's wrong with you?

754
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,588
Did you get high
with my brother?

755

No!

[When You're Smilin'

Hey, buddy,
what's wrong?

759
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,149
You wanna talk?

760
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,057
Okay, then I'll talk.

761
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:52,193
Do you know that I know
the ancient art
of Origami?

762
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,031
That was a student's
test paper.

763
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:59,507
That's okay,
I know this kid,
he wasn't gonna pass.

764
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,868
All right, now this is
the most important part.

765
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:07,781
Close your eyes.
Keep 'em closed.

766
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,310
Voila.

767
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,288
A flower.

768
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,788
Or, or a duck.

769
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:25,093
Everyone I love
hates me.

770
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,237
Nobody could hate you.

771
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,202
John and my family do.

772
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,869
They think
I'm disgusting.

773
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,777
I did a terrible thing.

774
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,144
Well, this terrible thing,

775
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,550
did you mean to hurt
anyone on purpose?

776
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,644
No.

777
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:49,722
Well, it sounds to me
like you just made
a mistake.

778
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,990
This was
pretty disgusting.

779
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,022
Look, you're being
too hard on yourself.

780
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,058
You're the sweetest
person I know, even
if you are just human.

781
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,069
In fact, that's the part
I like the best.

782
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,166
You're gross, yeah,
I was fucking Steve.

783
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,806
I didn't say anything.

784
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,597
I can't do this anymore.

785
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,545
You wanna break up?

786
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,741
No. Do you?

787
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,618
No.

788
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,758
I just wish
you never told me.

789
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,357
I wish
I never told you, too!

790
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:05,260
I wish it never
happened! It was just
some dumb stupid thing

791
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:09,704
I did when I was
18, and now nobody
wants to be with me!

792
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:10,762
I'm sorry.

tonight?

I missed us.

797
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,054
I missed us, too.

798
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,579
What's wrong?

799
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:57,642
Nothing.

You're not hard.

801
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,291
I will be,
just shut up
and kiss me.

802
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,741
You can't get hard.

803
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,144
I will
if you stop talking.

804
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,808

805
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:27,872
Mm-hm.

806
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:28,940
Mm-hm.

807
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,422
I'm gonna get more.

808
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,485
Mm-hm.

809
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:47,527
Oh, no!
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

810
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,020
Ooh-ooh.

811
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,381
Cheers.

812
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,449
Cheers.

813
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,894
I have a confession
to make.

814
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,462
You're a dude?

815
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,936
No.

816
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,610
I don't like women.

817
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:31,169
I agree, I think
most of them
are pains in the asses.

818
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,912
No.

819
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:40,685
I don't "like" women.

820
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:44,284
I think vaginas
are disgusting.

821
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,158
My friend Linda?

822
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,890
Yeah?

823
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,226
No.

824
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,426
You lost me.

825
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,799
I never had sex
with her.

826
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,639
Really?

827
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,732
Are you bummed?

828
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,471
No, I'm not bummed.

829
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,743
But why would you
tell me that you did?

830
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,443
I thought
you wanted to hear it.

831
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,713
Are you mad at me?

832
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,379
No, no.

833
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,449
What can I do
to make it up to you?

834
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:20,952
Something dirty.

835
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,465
What?

836
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,725
I wanna see you do it.

837
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,731
You know,
with Steve.

838
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,798
You're gross.

839
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,639
Why?

840
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,976
You're not kidding.

841
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,949
Baby, you did it before.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

842
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,848
I fucking hate you.

843
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,386
Now you have morals?
There's a line
you can't cross?

844
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,822
I made a mistake once,
and you can't forgive me!

845
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,360
I wanted to see it
for myself.

846
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,523
I made a mistake with you.

847
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,368
I made a mistake with you,
you dog blowin' cunt.

848
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:34,093
Sorry about what
I said last night.

849
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,159
Me, too.

850
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,164
You didn't say
anything wrong.

851
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:41,404
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry
about what you said.

852
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,446
Actually,
I take that back.

853
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,378
I'm glad to know
what you think of me.

854
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,109
I can't get it
out of my head.

855
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,379
I can't live like this.

856
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,647
I'm leaving.

857
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,616
Amy, please--

858
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,453
Don't!
Don't do that!

859
00:54:55,525 --> 00:55:01,896
You know what?
Do whatever you want.
I can't take it anymore.

Hello?

Hi, Daddy.

864
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:29,985
It's Amy.
How are you?

865
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,750
Fine.

866

Who is it?

It's Amy.

868
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,432
How was your trip
back home?

869
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,501
We made it
back fine.

870
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,630
I'm really sorry
about how things--

871
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:44,696
Please, don't.

872
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,609
I don't want to talk
about this.

873
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,273
I just wanted to say--

874
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,815
I don't want
to discuss what
you're gonna say.

875
00:55:54,951 --> 00:56:01,550
Okay. I'm sorry.
I won't bring it up again.

876
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,615
Can I talk
to Mom?

877
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,966
She's not here
right now.
She's out.

878
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,127
Out?

879
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,008
Oh...

880
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,509
Well...

881
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,179
give her my love.

882
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,175
I love you, Daddy.

883
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,718

Fuck him.

886
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,891
You can do
so much better than him.
You know that.

887
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:51,830
That last time I saw him,
he got letchy and weird
and hugged me too long.

888
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,307
He did?

889
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,140
Yeah.
I wasn't gonna say
anything then but--

890
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,874
he's disgusting,
you can't go
back to him.

891
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,117

892
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,173
Yeah.

00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,859
We're not including you
as a man, baby.

895
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,661
Nice save.

896
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,096
Look, you can stay here
as long as you need to.

897
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,759
Thanks, you guys.

898
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:25,130
Need his ass kicked?
'Cause, um, Linda's
super strong.

899
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,472
I love you, faggot.

900
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:31,378

I fuckin'

902
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:49,423
Oh, yeah, it's in.
Right there.
Keep moving like that.

903
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:53,196
Oh, my God.
Squeeze my balls.

904
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,363
Oh, yeah.
Slow down.

905
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,907
Oh, my God.
You like it
in that hole?

906
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,636
Yeah, that's a good hole.

907
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,237
Oh, my gosh.
I got a mommy now.

908
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,748
Oh, now I got a mommy.

909
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,182
M m, mm, mm.

910
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,054
And he's, like, " Uh, uh."

911
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:15,181
It's so weird,
it's like listening
to ghosts fucking.

912
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:18,921
I'm sleeping
on an inflatable mattress,
it's like a life raft.

913
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,054
I gotta get
my own place.

914
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,257
I'll help you look,
let me go with you.

915
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,857
Beth wouldn't mind?

916
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:29,098
She's been working late,
I haven't seen her
in weeks.

917
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,901
You're a pal.

918
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,135

Where are we?

919
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,241
That's it!
Perfect.

920
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,940
Okay, I'll stop.

921
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,312
No.

922
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,714
Want me to stop?

923
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,844
You could live
out your days
as a crack whore.

924
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,354
That'd be nice.

925
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,593
There you go,
there's a cute place.

926
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,096
It doesn't look
like it gets
morning sun.

927
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,962
Morning sun?
Is that like
your lndian name?

929
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,802
I like it.

930

No, really?

00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,602

Hello.

What's wrong?

937
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,760
Your brother
is in jail.

938
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,627
My God. Why?

939

Robbery.
He didn't do it.

940
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,365
Someone else
used his car.

941
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,564
We thought you were
the lawyer.

942
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,072
I have to get off
the phone.

943
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,130
I understand.

945
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:54,812
Hello?

(Ed)
Hey, um--

947
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,989
it's me, Ed.
I'm sorry to be
calling so late.

948
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,223
No, no problem.
What's wrong?

949
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:04,698
I think Beth's
having an affair.

950
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,496
Why do you
think that?

951
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:10,596
Well, she's been working
late, and she works
with this guy Charlie.

952
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,335
and umh...

953
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,673
So I thought
I would surprise her
with dinner

954
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,337
so I walked
into her office

955
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:20,712
and she was on her desk
fucking Charlie.

956
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,348
That might be
an affair.

957
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,379
Look, I'm sorry.
Am I buggin' you
with this?

958
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,255
No! Why don't you
come over?

959
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,089
I couldn't--

960
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,061
Please, it's the
least I could do.

961
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,792
Just come on over,
I'll see you
in a little while.

962
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,863
All I've got is wine
and a loaf of bread.

963
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,874
Have you been
entertaining Christ?

964
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,940
That's it.
I'm done with women.
They're evil.

965
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:55,883
I'd be gay
if it wasn't
for the sex thing.

966
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:59,820
I don't get it,
why can't people
be committed?

967
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:03,848
I've been attracted
to other women, but
I've never acted on it.

968
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:10,593
Ed, commitment
is a reaction,
not a decision.

969
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,036
Are you sure
you're only 26?

970
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:18,437
What's the youngest women
you've ever had sex with?

971
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,999
Oh.

Wow.

974
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,849
Ah, it's not that
impressive. I was
only 16, too.

975
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,454
I'm such a loser.

976
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,722
No, you're not.

977
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,924

Yeah,
I'm too old for you.

We cannot act
like weirdos at work.

totally cool about this.

And I'm gonna come by
this weekend and pick up
my stuff, okay?

1001
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:54,923
All right.
Bye.

1002
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,862
Not there.

1003
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,730
Not picking up.

1004
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,968
So, uh, what was
that disgusting thing

1005
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:09,307
that you told me
that everyone was
so upset about?

1006
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:15,740
All right, forget it.
I never brought it up, okay?

1007
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:22,851
Wow.

1008
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,891

Thanks for coming with me
to pick up this stuff.

1009
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,932
Of course.

1010
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,864
It's not like
you could carry
the couch on your own.

1011
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,232
Will he be there?

1012
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,738
Yeah.

1013
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,274
But don't worry.

better over there.

my balls just rolled out

I'm positive.

01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,102
Who's this?

1073
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,046
This is my friend, Ed.

1074
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,207
Hi, Ed.

1075
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,773
Sir.

1076
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,912
What happened
to John?

1077
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,081
We broke up.

1078
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,114
Oh, of course.

1079
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,354
Well, come on in.

1080
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,667
We had just started dinner
when it happened.

1081
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,681
I can't put
the food away.

1082
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,549
You don't have to, Daddy.

1083
01:09:56,926 --> 01:10:00,054
Your brother
still doesn't know,
I'm not speaking to him.

1084
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:08,094
He really shouldn't hear it
from a stranger, though.

1085
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,602
I'll tell him.

1086
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:21,543
Look, uh,

1087
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,848
I'm gonna get
a hotel room.

1088
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,547
You guys should
really be alone.

1089
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:30,251
Look, you tell your dad
I said goodbye.

1090
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:41,198
All right, call me
if you need anything,
okay? Please?

1091
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,760
I will.
Thanks.

1092
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:43,998
All right.

1093
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:54,615
[soft music]

1094
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:30,674
Hey.

1095
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:33,017
Hey, morning.

1096
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:36,023
No, you are not coming
with me to prison
to see my brother.

1097
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:39,356
No, that is the last place
you should go alone.

1098
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:42,090
You're borderline stalking.
This is my family.

1099
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:47,968
Look, I don't think
you know how nuts
I am about you.

1100
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,699
All right?
None of this
bothers me.

1101
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,509
My brother's crazy.

1102
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,773
You should meet
my family.

1103
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,371
Nuts.

1104
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,990
Who's this guy?

1105
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,459
This is my friend, Ed.

1106
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:17,831
Nice to meet you.

1107
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,409
So, nice outfit, huh?
What do you think?

1108
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,446
Dougie, I have
some terrible news.

1109
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:34,571
What?

1110
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:40,286
Mom died.

1111
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,389
Um--

1112
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:02,976
From what?

1113
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,340
A brain aneurysm.

1114
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:14,019
umh... What causes that?

1115
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:18,449
Sometimes it just happens,
sometimes it just--

1116
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:23,926
Sometimes what?

1117
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,661
Stress.

1118
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,999
[sobbing]
You and Dad
blame me, huh?

1119
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,031
You do.

1120
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:47,111
Mom died when she couldn't
bear that her daughter
was a fucked-up whore.

1121
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:48,478
Don't start.

1122
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:53,324
Oh, haven't you told
your boyfriend about
your big secret?

1123
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:54,384
Fuck you!

1124
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,624
Fuck you, too!
At least, I didn't kill Mom!

1125
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,729
[barking]

1126
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:13,173
You can tell me
anything. Okay?

1127
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:18,345
I want to know what
happened. I don't
care what it was.

1128
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:21,417
We need to be totally
honest with each other.

1129
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:27,360
No, we don't!
I want you to go home.
You're not my boyfriend.

1130
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:36,361
[doorbell rings]

1131
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,533
Hey, Randy.

1132
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:41,906
Hey, Amy.

1133
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,275
Sorry
about your mom.

1134
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,874
Thank you, Randy.

1135
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:48,939
And uhm...

1136
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:52,417
sorry about
that other thing, too.

1137
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,251
Your brother
told me. Yeah.

1138
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,917
I guess
he wasn't supposed to.

1139
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:01,394
Or I wasn't supposed
to tell you that I knew,

1140
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:05,490
but anyway, I know,
and sorry about both.

1141
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:09,697
I mean, I'm sorry,
but forget--

1142
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:10,795
It's fine.
Thanks.

1143
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,937
I kissed
a dead body once.

1144
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,435
Oh.

1145
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,177
Yeah, I never told
anybody that.

1146
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:28,788
Hey, my mom made this
casserole and wanted me
to bring it over.

1147
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,485
Tell her thank you.

1148
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,155
It bounced around
in my truck a little.
Should be okay.

1149
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:38,365
It smells like gas, but--

1150
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,795
it probably
doesn't taste like it.

1151
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:51,107
You don't have to eat it
if you don't want to.

1152
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,677
You look really pretty
when you're sad.

1153
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,116
You, too.

1154
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,561
[soft music]

1155
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,469
[indistinct chattering]

1156
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,664
I need you
to love me, Daddy.

1157
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:50,126
(Ed, recorded)
Hi, this is Ed's cell,
please leave a message.

1158
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:59,430
[no audio]

1159
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,705
Ed?

1160
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,307
Hey.

1161
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:13,184
We need to talk.
How come you won't
return my phone calls?

1162
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:17,191
I'm not an idiot.
I was leaving you alone.

1163
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,692
Come here.

1164
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,133
Listen, I'm really sorry
about how I acted
the other day.

1165
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:31,764
That's okay.
Not like you were
under pressure.

1166
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:38,706
Look, I'm sorry, too.
I was movin' way too fast.

1167
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,573
How about dinner?

1168
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,483
I'm sorry,
I thought you heard.

1169
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,148
Beth and l
are together again.

1170
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,595
Oh.

1171
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:56,653
That's great.

1172
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,324
Yeah.

1173
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,924
Yeah.

1174
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,697
Are you happy?

1175
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:07,071
Yeah, yeah,
we're in therapy,

1176
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:10,441
it's working,
and we're getting
a lot off our chests.

1177
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:17,051
I'm really happy
for you.

1178
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:18,745
Thank you.

1179
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,812
[sad piano music]

1180
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,670
(Dad)
Anybody home?

1181
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:51,980
I know you smoke.

1182
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,721
You've been smoking
since you were 13.

1183
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,418
Why didn't you
say something?

1184
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,851
I didn't want you
to know I knew.

1185
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:02,986
Oh.

1186
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,801
You want anything?

1187
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,628
Water.

1188
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,211
You ever hear
from that Ed?

1189
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:24,674
No.

1190
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:28,816
He seemed
like a nice guy.

1191
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,653
Yeah.

1192
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,090
Thanks.

1193
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,729
Have a seat.

1194
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:49,436
Your mother
wrote you a letter.

1195
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,483
She wrote it
before your brother
went to jail.

1196
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,815
I never got around
to sending it.

1197
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,217
(mother)
Dear Amy,

1198
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:09,161
I can't begin to tell you
how sorry I am

1199
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,199
for the way
I have treated you.

1200
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,701
I'm not going to say
I forgive you.

1201
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,703
because you did
nothing wrong.

1202
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:21,970
We all do
dumb things
in our youth.

1203
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:27,379
As you know.
And I hope
you can forgive me.

1204
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:31,010
I have never stopped
being proud of you.

1205
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:34,021
You will always be
my diamond girl.

1206
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:37,354
I love you.

1207
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:39,325
Mom.

1208
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,110
I want you
to have this.

1209
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,986
Daddy, I can't.

1210
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,324
You're my diamond
girl, too.

1211
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,475
I know your mother
had a secret.

1212
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:47,387
Did your mother tell you
that she had sex with
someone else other than me?

1213
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,102
You're crazy, Dad.

1214
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:03,232
I'm sorry.

1215
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,575
Mom was
the original virgin.

1216
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:09,913
I know, I know--
sometimes my mind--

1217
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,182
You're right,
I am crazy.

1218
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,122
Here.

1219
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:20,153
Oh.

1220
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,696
[chuckling]

1221
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,895
I don't know
why she kept all that.

1222
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:26,866
I don't know
why that's there.

1223
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:30,268
Ticket stub from
a Roy Orbison concert.

1224
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,265
I don't know either.

1225
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,332
God, I loved
Roy Orbison.

1226
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:38,905
Mom did, too.

1227
01:23:58,366 --> 01:23:59,765
What are you
doing here?

1228
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:01,830
We need to talk.

1229
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:03,871
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

1230
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:05,303
Please.

1231
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,535
All right.

1232
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:13,313
(Ed)
Hey, Beth, I'm taking
Cowboy for a walk.

1233
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,847
Come on, Cowboy,
come on.

1234
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,227
So what's the emergency?

1235
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,566
Look, I know
you're trying to work
things out with Beth,

1236
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:39,130
and I want to be
respectful of that, but--

1237
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,136
I love you, Ed.

1238
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,573
Things aren't working
out so well with Beth.

1239
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,916
I want to be with you.

1240
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,181
I'm afraid of you.

1241
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:02,796
Why can't you just
tell me what happened?

1242
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:06,263
I can't!

1243
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:09,830
I better head back.

1244
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,039
If I tell you what I did,

1245
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:16,100
you'll think I'm disgusting,
and you won't love me anymore.

1246
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:17,303
I'm disgusting.

1247
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,006
No, you're not.
You're perfect.

1248
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:24,541
I love porn, okay?
I've got tons of porn.

1249
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,951
I beat off to it
for hours at a time.

1250
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:29,080
It's much worse
than that.

1251
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,332
I know what happened.

1252
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:45,938
You do?

1253
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,642
You had an abortion.

1254
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,442
Yes.

1255
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:59,783
That's why you were
gonna marry John,
because of the baby.

1256
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:02,880
Things weren't working out
so you had an abortion.

1257
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:07,257
Your parents found out,
and they got mad at you.

1258
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:13,329
Do you still love me?

1259
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,137
For being honest?

1260
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:23,506
I love you
even more.

1261
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:29,610
Do you really watch
that much porn?

1262
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:30,912
Why?

1263
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:33,317
I think porn
is kinda gross.

1264
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:34,377
Really?

1265
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:36,013
Mm-hmm.

1266
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:38,991
No, I was just
telling you that
to make you feel better.

1267
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:40,850
Oh.

[Roy Orbison sings
You Got It]

1269
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:46,999
* Every time I look
Into your loving eyes *

1270
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,730
(Amy narrating)
Ed and I are engaged now.

1271
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:54,332
* I feel love that money
Just can't buy *

1272
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:59,905
I felt bad that he got tore up
over my fictitious
aborted baby.

1273
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:02,449
And I felt bad
about lying to him.

1274
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:05,884
Whenever I would feel the need
to tell him the real truth,

1275
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:09,686
I would think of the image
of my mother wrestling
another woman

1276
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:12,954
in her bra and panties
for Elvis' sexual
gratification.

1277
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:15,518
Or her being banged
by Roy Orbison.

1278
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:20,561
Think how disturbing
that was for me to picture.

1279
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,929
How much worse
it would be for my dad
to know the truth.

1280
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:29,773
* Anything at all,
You got it, baby *

1281
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:38,580
It's important to lie.

1282
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:41,713
It's trying to live up
to the lies that we tell
about ourselves

1283
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,416
that makes us
better people.

1284
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:47,052
* You got it, baby *

1285
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:49,255
Did you ever have
a dog growin' up?

1286
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,594
No, just cats.

1287
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,692
* Anything at all *
* You got it *

1288
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:58,237
* Baby *

1289
01:27:58,306 --> 01:27:59,534
