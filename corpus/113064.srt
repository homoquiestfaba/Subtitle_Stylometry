2
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,946
Dead means they're broken?

3
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,951
Well, their bodies are broken, yes.

4
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,622
And they're under the
ground? Their bodies are, yes.

5
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,708
Tell me what dead is.

6
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,128
Mmm. When you...

7
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,924
When you look at the
photographs ofThomas and Timothy,

8
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,134
do you remember the stories
of what they're doing?

9
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,721
Yes. Hmm, well,

10
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:04,685
Tom and Timmy are alive
in your imagination.

11
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,104
It makes me sad to think about them.

12
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,315
Makes me sad too, Ruthie.

13
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,401
But Mommy's sadder.

14
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,530
Well, yes.

15
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,439
Uh-huh.

16
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,736
Does your son have a
driver's license? Huh! Ooh!

17
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,779
Jesus.

18
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,741
Heh! You don't have to yell, Minty.

19
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,203
Yeah? Well, let me consider it, will ya?

20
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,748
Yeah.

21
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,501
All right. I'll call you back. Bye.

22
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,309
Eh, it still gets cold
in the evening, huh?

23
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,229
Thanks.

24
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,815
Jesus. Look at this yard.

25
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,655
We should clear out some of these
straggly looking flower beds.

26
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,327
I want to put in a swimming pool.

27
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,913
Why?

28
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:51,834
Oh, for Ruth when she gets older.

29
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,671
Something like the one we had
in Providence. They loved it.

30
00:04:55,712 --> 00:05:00,217
And the lawn... It ought to
be more like an athletic field.

31
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,346
No.

32
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,976
Look at this picture. Who is he?

33
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:14,106
That's Minty O'Hare's son... the
boys' English teacher from Exeter.

34
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,149
He wants a summer job.

35
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,861
He wants to be a writer.

36
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,863
What would he do for you?

37
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,574
It's mainly for the
experience, I suppose.

38
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:28,537
I mean, if he's thinking about becoming a writer,
he should see how one works, see what it takes.

39
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,584
What would he actually do for you?

40
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,711
Mmm, well...

41
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,178
I've been thinking.

42
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:50,142
I want to try separating...
for the summer.

43
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,440
Just temporarily.

44
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,641
So you began your career writing novels?

45
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:36,647
Yes, but they were terrible novels. Uh,
unfortunately I had to write three of them...

46
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,108
before I realized I am not
a writer of adult fiction.

47
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:44,238
I am simply a entertainer of
children, and I like to draw.

48
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,783
Edward, don't be nervous
because he's famous.

49
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,244
He's an Exonion.

50
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,829
His sons were charming boys...

51
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,083
but... mediocre students.

52
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,961
Why do cautionary tales for children come so
naturally to you? They were both in my class.

53
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,381
Well, I think I can imagine
their fears and express them.

54
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,425
Um, in my stories, Anyway,

55
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:09,388
uh, you can see what's coming, but you don't see
everything that's coming. Just pick up what you can.

56
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,015
Note his work habits.

57
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,518
See if there's a method to his madness.

58
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,855
And... above all...

59
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,109
throw yourself in headlong and just
do whatever it is he wants you to do.

60
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,237
In my opinion, there is no better opening to any story
than the opening of The Mouse Crawling Between the Walls.

61
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,283
I mean, the first lines...
"Tom woke up, but Tim did not."

62
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,036
Daddy, I had a dream.

63
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,289
I heard a sound.

64
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,834
Uh, what sort of sound, Ruth?

65
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:42,588
It's in the house, but
it's trying to be quiet.

66
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
Hmm.

67
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,349
Well, let's go look for it then.

68
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,896
It's a sound that's trying to
be quiet? What did it sound like?

69
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:04,026
It was a sound like someone
trying not to make a sound.

70
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,040
Your penis looks funny.

71
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,669
My penis is funny.

72
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,298
Come out sound. Come out sound.

73
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,512
I'll tell you a story
about a different sound.

74
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,765
One night when Thomas was just your age,

75
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,643
and Timothy was still in diapers,

76
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:42,064
Tommy heard a sound.
Did they both wake up?

77
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,399
Oh, Tom woke up,

78
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,985
but Tim did not.

79
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,615
And Tom woke up his father...

80
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,243
and asked him, "Did you hear that sound?

81
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,415
There's the sound again,"
Tom whispered to his Father.

82
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,669
"It's a monster!" he cried.

83
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,380
"It's just a mouse...

84
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,966
crawling between the walls,"

85
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,093
his father said,

86
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,680
and thumped the wall hard with his hand.

87
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,099
And the mouse...

88
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,142
Scurried away.

89
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,522
"It's just a mouse.

90
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,691
That's all," Tom said.

91
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,527
And he quickly fell asleep.

92
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,280
But Tim,

93
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,449
he stayed awake all night long.

94
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:39,454
And every time that thing crawling
between the walls came crawling back,

95
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,540
he'd hit the wall,

96
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,751
and he'd listen to the monster...

97
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,837
scurry away,

98
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,715
dragging his thick, wet fur,

99
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,177
and no arms and no legs with it.

100
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,974
- And that...
- Is the end of the story.

101
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,478
Where's Mommy?

102
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,733
Mommy, uh... It's her turn
at the other house, remember?

103
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,862
It's my turn tomorrow night. But
she'll be here in the morning, okay?

104
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:16,283
- Okay.
- "Are there any mice in this house?"

105
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:21,496
Hmm. Everyone has mice.

106
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,624
Mice are everywhere.

107
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,753
See you in the morning, Ruthie.

108
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,033
Eddie? Eddie?

109
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,414
Mrs. Cole? Marion.

110
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,711
Come.

111
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,175
You can drive, can't
you? Oh, yeah. Yes I can.

112
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,679
I know boys your age. They love
to drive every chance they get.

113
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,725
Yes, ma'am. But I don't
know how to drive a stick.

114
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,644
It's an automatic. Okay.

115
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,439
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,900
Sorry about before. I was...

117
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,277
I was expecting Mr. Cole.

118
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,864
Ted lost his license three months ago.

119
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,075
You're not at Exeter anymore. You
can call us by our first names.

120
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,205
Okay.

121
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,542
Aren't you coming in?

122
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,669
Not tonight.

123
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,106
Did it hurt? Does it hurt much?

124
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,234
No, I'm all right. I'm all right.
Don't worry about me. Eddie!

125
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,695
It is an honor to meet you, sir. Ah.

126
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:44,116
I want to thank you in advance for this
experience. Ah, well, I hope you find it worthwhile.

127
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,286
Ed, this is Doctor Loomis.
Eddie's my new assistant. Hi.

128
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,163
Hi. Yeah. Exeter, '05.

129
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,541
I was class of'61. Good stuff.

130
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,127
So, Tuesday, yeah? Right.
See you then. Tuesday, yeah.

131
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,963
Nice to meet you, Eddie. Ciao.

132
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,716
I've read all your novels and
all your children's books... 3:30?

133
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:04,261
Yeah, 3:30. Got it.

134
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:07,139
I've... I read all your novels
and all your children's books,

135
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,766
and my favorite is The
Door in the Floor. Ahh.

136
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,896
Well, you're probably one of the few
people on earth who have read all my novels.

137
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,734
So, uh, what makes you think
you want to be a writer, Eddie?

138
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,278
Oh, I wrote something,
and I brought it with me.

139
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,032
I'd be extremely honored if you might read
it, whenever you're not busy, of course.

140
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:29,578
Well, writing is rigorous work.
I keep myself incredibly busy.

141
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:35,042
Yeah. Many of my books contain
500 words or less, so...

142
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,505
every word must be examined and
re-examined thoroughly. Okay.

143
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:43,467
You're going to be spending the whole summer
looking for "le motjuste," as Flaubert says. Oh.

144
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,677
- The right word. The true word.
- "Okay. Well,"

145
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,764
I'm prepared to throw myself in headlong
and do whatever you need me to do.

146
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,601
Yeah, because I'm sure there'll be
many different tasks that will come up.

147
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,646
Oh, all right. For
example, I need squid.

148
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:59,525
I'm, uh, using squid
ink for my new book,

149
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,319
and for all my drawings now.

150
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,363
There's a, uh...

151
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,533
a woman in Montauk, she's a fishmonger.

152
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,702
She collects the squid ink
for me. Should I go today?

153
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:15,332
Ah, you can go tomorrow. You see her
husband over there, don't mention my name.

154
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:20,379
"Also, I have to tell you"...
"because it's a little complicated"...

155
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,342
you've arrived here during what is
a sad time in a long, happy marriage.

156
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:29,680
Uh, Marion and I, we're separating...

157
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,558
temporarily, on a trial basis.

158
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,269
And I've, uh... I've rented
a small apartment in town,

159
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,647
and every other night one of us
will be spending the night there.

160
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,985
Uh, during the day, you'll work there
at the apartment while I'm working here,

161
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,696
but you'll sleep here.

162
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:50,576
I know it seems unnecessarily
complicated, but...

163
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:54,121
it's hard to know what's...
what's best for my daughter.

164
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:59,001
Anyway, your bedroom is in the main
house, upstairs, second door on the left.

165
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,881
Uh, you want to take your stuff up
there, relax? Or you wanna take a shower?

166
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,966
Unpack.

167
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,010
Okay, well,

168
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,180
make yourself comfortable, Eddie.

169
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,557
Thank you, sir.

170
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,685
And... I'm sorry about your marriage.

171
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,021
Me too, Eddie.

172
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,023
Anyway,

173
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,652
I'm sure you're gonna do great here.

174
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,615
It's gonna be a good summer
for ya. I'm glad to have ya.

175
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,934
- ""

176
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,668
Did you see the shrine?

177
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,546
Mm-hmm. It's kinda creepy, huh?

178
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,090
It's sad.

179
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,926
You go to Exeter, right?
Yeah, I'm an upper.

180
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:34,096
An "upper"? Yeah, like,
an upperclassman...

181
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,099
like, kind of like a junior. Your
father's a teacher there, right?

182
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,394
So you get to go for free? Yeah.

183
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,938
He was their teacher, right?
So that's why you're here?

184
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,982
I guess.

185
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,946
- Did you know them before they died?
- Uh, no, but I heard a lot about them.

186
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:54,324
When I was in eighth grade I
used to date a senior from Exeter.

187
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:59,454
Really? Yeah. He was
older than you, of course.

188
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,293
His name was, like, Chickie
or Chuckie or something.

189
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,461
It was probably a nickname.

190
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:16,305
You know, it... it's quite
common to have a nickname there.

191
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,602
It is.

192
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,501
Oh, great, you got it.

193
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,628
Just in time. Yes, sir.

194
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,797
Uh, here, wait. Just a second.

195
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,178
Here. I want you to, uh,

196
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,681
put it in here and then freeze it.

197
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,767
What should I do next?

198
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:05,771
I'm sketching a model. Why don't
you go to the beach, take a swim?

199
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,649
I... I could straighten up the
work room or something else.

200
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,817
No, no. Go ahead.

201
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,530
Anything really. I just want
to help. No, that's all right.

202
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,407
Contemplating the waves...

203
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:22,371
will be a hell of a lot more useful to you
as a young writer than watching me draw.

204
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,249
Okay. There'll be, uh,

205
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:28,961
plenty more rigorous work to do...

206
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,672
at some point in the near future.

207
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,676
Don't spill that stuff.

208
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,652
Take your dress off, please.

209
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,712
And your bra.

210
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,517
Morning, Eddie.

211
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,644
Morning, ma'am.

212
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:44,281
- ""
- " Bright, yeah.! Colors.!"

213
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,086
Hi. Hi.

214
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,672
Did you just see that movie? Yes.

215
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,799
Me too.

216
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,845
- Is that your dinner?
- Sort of, yeah.

217
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:52,641
I... got kind of tired of burgers. I've
had one every night since I got here.

218
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,811
Ted doesn't get you
anything? Not really.

219
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:59,690
I mean, he would. It's just, I don't
think Ruth likes to eat with me.

220
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:03,819
I don't think your parents would like it if
they thought we weren't taking care of you.

221
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,405
They wouldn't mind,
really, I don't think.

222
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,412
Eddie, would you like to
go to dinner one night?

223
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:17,416
I'll make sure you get
something... decent.

224
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,668
Okay. Okay?

225
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,004
Yeah. Good.

226
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,298
Thanks. Good night.

227
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,383
See you. Bye.

228
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,761
Eddie?

229
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,930
Just one second.! Uh,

230
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,225
Ruth wanted to be sure that one
of the photographs was still here.

231
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:20,896
She gets anxious if she can't
see them or if they get moved.

232
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:25,067
Which one was it, sweetie? There it is.

233
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,069
Ahh.

234
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:30,072
He's just a little broken,
but he won't die, right? Right.

235
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,908
Not yet. No. Ruthie had a dream.

236
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,703
- Where's feet?
- "Hmm? What are you talking about?"

237
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:39,248
Where are the feet?

238
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,959
- Sorry, Eddie.

239
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,546
We've gotten in the habit of showing Ruth these
pictures, and if we don't she gets very worked up.

240
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,714
That's okay. You can see them anytime.

241
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:50,384
Ahh, see? See you in the morning, Eddie.

242
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:52,970
- " What did he do?"
- ""

243
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,570
That's Mrs. Vaughn.

244
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:55,199
Came over to discuss some sketches.
Had some questions about them.

245
00:26:55,324 --> 00:27:00,037
Uh, guess she's an early riser.

246
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,456
Do you want me to drive
you home now, or... Uh, no.

247
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,375
I'm gonna... I'm gonna walk. I
left the revisions on my desk. Hmm?

248
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,795
Um, after I finish, what should
I do next? I'll let you know.

249
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:34,882
Eddie, I should have knocked.

250
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:43,849
It's my fault. "I
- I'm not angry. I"...

251
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:47,019
I'm just... I'm just embarrassed.

252
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:52,274
Eddie?

253
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:05,787
Come here, please.

254
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:18,050
It's funny. Let's just call
it funny and leave it at that.

255
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:21,303
Eddie?

256
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,764
Look at me.

257
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:27,226
Sit.

258
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,823
I know boys your age.

259
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:45,744
I know it's what boys
your age do, isn't it?

260
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:49,373
Look, Eddie, I am flattered.

261
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:54,837
It felt good to know that someone
was at least thinking about me.

262
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:59,007
Oh, not to assume that you
"were thinking about me, um"...

263
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:03,136
Maybe about my clothes. And I know you
probably have so many girls you think about.

264
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:07,349
- I didn't...
- I think about what you were wearing when I first met you.

265
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:12,062
It was a pink sweater,
buttons up the front.

266
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:14,106
Oh!

267
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,860
That sweater, it's so old.

268
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,406
Because of how it must
feel against your skin.

269
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,287
Oh.

270
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,877
Would you do me a favor?

271
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,591
Take this down with you.

272
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:42,759
Please? All right.

273
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,680
Thank you.

274
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:07,576
I'll probably be about an hour. Here.
Why don't you go over the revisions?

275
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,629
- Hey, do you want your supplies?
- Oh, yeah.

276
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,546
Hi.

277
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,965
You look nice.

278
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,969
The tie or the jacket.
You really don't need both.

279
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:09,096
Okay.

280
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:15,561
How's the work going for you?

281
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:19,147
I just retype "A Sound Like Someone"
Trying Not to Make a Sound every morning.

282
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:22,526
Sometimes he changes a
comma from a semicolon,

283
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:25,571
and then the next morning
he changes it back.

284
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:32,661
He needs a computer. Ted needs a driver.

285
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:36,832
That's why he hired you,
because he needs a driver.

286
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,421
I don't get to drive much at home, so...

287
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:51,054
Eddie, you're so serious.

288
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,184
Boys your age shouldn't be so serious.

289
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,062
I know a joke, But it's not very good.

290
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,565
Tell me.

291
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:05,736
There's this battleship out in the ocean,
and the captain of it, Captain Stern,

292
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:10,699
this captain learns that the mother of
one of his sailors just died. Mm-hmm.

293
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:13,327
And the sailor's name
is Midshipman Abernathy.

294
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:18,916
So the captain thinks and thinks, and he tries to come up
with the best way to tell Abernathy that his mother died.

295
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:24,755
And finally after staying up all night,
he comes up with a nice way of telling him.

296
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:29,218
So the next morning he calls
the crew up on deck and says,

297
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:33,931
"Gentlemen, all of you whose mothers
are still living, step forward.

298
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:37,643
Not so fast, Abernathy."

299
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,774
I-I like that joke, Eddie. I...
No, it's a... it's a dumb joke.

300
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:46,360
I do. I do.

301
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,621
Why don't you ask Alice out on a date?

302
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,124
She's not my type.

303
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:04,503
Well, she's a good nanny anyway.

304
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:21,436
I think it was wrong
of us to have had Ruth.

305
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,984
When we first moved here, the idea was,

306
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,152
a new place,

307
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,573
a new child,

308
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,992
a new life, I suppose.

309
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,705
Ted's a good father.

310
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:46,003
But he doesn't really know how to
do all the stuff you have to do.

311
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:49,089
And I can't.

312
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:52,384
I can't with her.

313
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:05,314
I picked that one because
they're in silhouette,

314
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:08,483
and you can almost imagine
what they would look like now.

315
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,615
Timothy looks guilty.

316
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,285
Thomas looks like a wild animal.

317
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:29,087
This one's funny.

318
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,173
Tommy looks so...

319
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:35,594
scared.

320
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:25,686
I hope I'm not disturbing
you. Oh, no. No, not at all.

321
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,356
You can tell in this picture...

322
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:33,569
Timothy is more introspective,

323
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,654
like you.

324
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:45,998
And you know where this is?

325
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,709
What does it say?

326
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:53,589
"Come hither, boys, and become men."

327
00:36:57,593 --> 00:37:01,180
Not pink with lilac.

328
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,891
Oh.

329
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,685
I wasn't thinking about the colors.

330
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:10,898
I don't know if they had sex.

331
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:14,610
Thomas, maybe. He was so popular.

332
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:18,739
But, Timothy, he was so shy.

333
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,952
That's all boys want, isn't it?

334
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:26,038
Yes.

335
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:29,333
Before I die.

336
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,470
Have you had sex, Eddie?

337
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,395
No.

338
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:58,070
Well, it's too hot in here,

339
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:02,658
so I hope you'll forgive me
if I don't wear the sweater.

340
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:59,548
You still really haven't
had sex, have you, Eddie?

341
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,550
Not really.

342
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:05,345
No, not really.

343
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,476
But I feel...

344
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:15,022
I feel complete.

345
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:23,197
Come here.

346
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:55,312
"There was a little boy who
didn't know ifhe wanted to be born.

347
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:58,649
"His mommy didn't know if she
wanted him to be born either.

348
00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:03,779
"They lived in a cabin in the
woods on an island in a lake,

349
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,615
"and there was no one else around.

350
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:11,078
"And in the cabin there
was a door in the floor.

351
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:16,625
"The little boy was afraid of what
was under the door in the floor,

352
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,837
"and the mommy was afraid too.

353
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,092
"Once, long ago, other children had
come to visit the cabin for Christmas,

354
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:28,428
"but the children had opened
the door in the floor...

355
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:30,973
"and had disappeared down the hole.

356
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:35,811
"The mommy had tried to
look for the children,

357
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:39,982
"but when she opened the door in the
floor she heard such an awful sound...

358
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:43,277
"that her hair turned
completely white...

359
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,571
"like the hair of a ghost.

360
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:51,577
"And the mommy had
also seen some things,

361
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:55,664
"things so horrible
you can't imagine them.

362
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,877
"And so the mommy wondered...

363
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,045
"if she wanted to have a little boy,

364
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:06,758
"especially because of everything that
might be under the door in the floor.

365
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,971
"And then she thought, 'Why not?

366
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:14,808
"I'll just tell him not to
open the door in the floor.'

367
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,562
"Yet the little boy...

368
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:21,064
"still didn't know if
he wanted to be born...

369
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,443
"into a world where there
was a door in the floor.

370
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:29,448
"But there were some
beautiful things in the woods,

371
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,618
"on the island and in the lake.

372
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:35,329
"'Why not take a chance? 'he thought.

373
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:41,627
"And so the little boy
was born and he was happy,

374
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:46,215
"and his mommy was happy again too.

375
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:49,218
"Although she told the boy...

376
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:52,596
"at least once every day,

377
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:56,058
"'Don't ever, not ever,

378
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:58,602
"'never, never, never...

379
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:01,355
"open the door in the floor.'

380
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:09,321
"But, of course, he
was only a little boy.

381
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:12,074
"If you were that little boy,

382
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,494
wouldn't you want to open
that door in the floor?"

383
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:29,132
The publisher thinks the drawings are too
rudimentary and there are too few of them.

384
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:32,719
But, um, I'm just an
entertainer of children,

385
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,972
and I like to draw.

386
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:42,855
Nudes, uh... Nudes are a requisite
fundamental exercise for anyone who draws,

387
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,566
like... like landscapes.
So you do landscapes too?

388
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:48,569
No. Long Island's too flat.

389
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:51,989
You don't prefer to
use professional models?

390
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:55,993
If nakedness... I mean, the feeling of
nakedness... is what a nude must convey,

391
00:42:56,034 --> 00:43:01,582
well, there's no nakedness that compares to what it feels
like to be naked in front of someone for the first time.

392
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:04,668
Hmm? Right, Eddie?

393
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,254
Yes. Yeah. No.

394
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:18,849
I'm grateful to you, Eddie. Oh, it's
my pleasure. It was very interesting.

395
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:21,143
No, I mean, uh,

396
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:24,313
I'm grateful to you for being
such a good friend to Marion.

397
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:29,026
She's been so unhappy.

398
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:33,322
It's good to see her smiling again.

399
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,856
Hello, Cole residence.

400
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:54,862
No, he's not here yet.
Should I go look for him?

401
00:44:57,948 --> 00:44:59,950
Unsteady?

402
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,841
Excuse me, Mr. Cole.

403
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:21,471
Um, Patrick called from
Bobby Van's restaurant.

404
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:25,893
- He said you might want a ride home.
- I have a ride.

405
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,982
Go on home, Eddie.

406
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:36,904
Sorry, Mr. Cole. Good night.

407
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:47,683
Ready, Eddie? Yup.

408
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:49,768
Ahh.

409
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:56,149
I, uh, converted this barn into a squash
court when I first bought the place.

410
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,986
Not quite regulation in its dimensions.

411
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:03,699
Plus, uh, there's a dead spot
in the floor by the back walls.

412
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:07,661
So, basically, I'm considered even
by the best players on the island...

413
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:10,289
to be unbeatable on my own court.

414
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:14,251
You play much? Um,
this is my third time.

415
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:18,172
Ahh, well, don't expect mercy from me.

416
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,841
I'm gonna grind you into a fine powder.

417
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:23,886
Huh!

418
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:39,693
Where those red lines
intersect, that's called the "T."

419
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:43,405
Whoever controls the
"T" controls the game.

420
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:46,575
You need to win control of the
"T" if you hope to win the game.

421
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:50,329
7-love.

422
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:06,512
Aah! Jesus! You all right?

423
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:09,223
Yeah, I'm fine.

424
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:12,601
Yeah, it was a good shot though.
Still made it to the wall.

425
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:15,646
Isn't that a let? Aren't you supposed
to just take the let and not hit the guy?

426
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,065
Well, technically you're
right, but I'll take the point.

427
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,109
Can't just take the
"T." You gotta earn it.

428
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:32,663
Aah! 9-0,
9-1, 9-0.

429
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:37,960
You look like a boy
who'll sleep well tonight.

430
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:42,047
Maybe you need to catch up
on your sleep anyway, hmm?

431
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:16,081
Stop screaming, honey. It's
okay. It's just Eddie and me.

432
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:18,375
G-Go back to bed, okay?

433
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:23,589
- Okay?
- Okay.

434
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:31,138
Did you get the stamps? Ah, two rolls.

435
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:37,978
They still have the ones with
the nocturnal animals? Mm-hmm.

436
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:44,193
Anyway, I, uh...

437
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:46,820
I presume it was Marion's mistake,

438
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:51,325
but surely it was a mistake for the
two of you to let Ruth see you together.

439
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:58,332
I'm not threatening you,
Eddie, but I must tell you...

440
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:02,878
that, uh, you may be called
upon to testify. Testify?

441
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:08,300
In the event of a custody dispute, regarding
which one of us is a more fit parent.

442
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:15,516
I would never have let a child see me
with another woman, whereas Marion...

443
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:18,894
has really made no effort
whatsoever to protect Ruth...

444
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:21,772
from seeing what she saw.

445
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:26,485
And if you are asked to
testify to what happened,

446
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:30,322
I trust that you won't
lie... not in a court of law.

447
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:40,499
From the sound of it, it
was a rear-entry position...

448
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:44,837
not that I have a personal problem
with that or any other position.

449
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:46,964
But for a child,

450
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,843
I imagine doing it doggishly...

451
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:54,096
must seem especially animalistic.

452
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:13,448
I'll only be about 25 minutes today.

453
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:17,244
Just a quick sketch.

454
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,005
I've never been unfaithful to Ted.

455
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,723
Why didn't you leave him?

456
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:41,685
Ted understands me.

457
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:48,150
Ted's the only one that really
knows what happened to me.

458
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:56,783
You don't need some time?

459
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:06,210
Aah! What are you doing?

460
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,505
Okay. Ready?

461
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:14,343
"He starts with
conventional portraits"...

462
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:17,471
a mother, a child.

463
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,849
Then the mother, then the mother nude.

464
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:24,937
Then the nudes go through phases,

465
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,398
like innocence, modesty,

466
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:30,484
degradation...

467
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,487
and shame.

468
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:36,198
Mrs. Vaughn?

469
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,785
Mrs. Vaughn is experiencing the...

470
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:42,204
degrading phase right now.

471
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,627
Move your head to the light.

472
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:54,383
"To the"... Evelyn, more to the light.

473
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:58,679
Evelyn.

474
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:56,737
I want to know more about you.

475
00:53:57,988 --> 00:54:00,324
You know too much already.

476
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,627
Tell me about the accident.

477
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,298
I mean, do you know
how it happened, or...

478
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,510
or was it anybody's fault?

479
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:31,063
Marion?

480
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:45,327
M-Marion? Mommy.

481
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,252
Mommy.

482
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:41,133
It was early in the morning,
and Mommy was just waking up.

483
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:46,388
Thomas and Timothy crawled under the
covers. And Daddy took the picture in France.

484
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:49,516
But what did you did to the feet?

485
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:53,395
Well, maybe it never happened.

486
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:57,024
You know, maybe it was just a dream. No.

487
00:55:57,149 --> 00:56:02,613
I guess it's just a
mystery. No, it was paper.

488
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:05,199
Don't you want to go back to bed? Yes.

489
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:09,494
Bring the picture. It's
my picture. It's not yours.

490
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,580
That's true.

491
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:35,437
Mommy.! Mommy.!

492
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:45,239
Ow. Ow.!

493
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:49,535
She cut her finger, badly. Ow.

494
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:56,917
Shh. It's okay. Am I going to die?

495
00:56:56,959 --> 00:57:00,254
No. You're not going to die.

496
00:57:00,379 --> 00:57:02,631
You're not going to die.

497
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:09,346
You don't understand. I put the
picture in her room. It's my fault.

498
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:13,976
That's not the point. The point is, you shouldn't
have gone into her room in the first place.

499
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:17,521
That's her mother's job. I
told you, Marion was asleep.

500
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:21,275
I doubt it. I doubt "asleep" would
accurately describe Marion's condition.

501
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:25,070
I did it to her. I asked
her about the accident.

502
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:27,573
Ah, it doesn't matter.

503
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:31,285
She was a great mother to the
boys, but she's for shits now.

504
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,289
It's my fault. No. It's Marion's fault.

505
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,418
Ruthie, please. Mommy.!

506
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:42,129
- "Come on now." Go to sleep now. Please.
- Mommy!

507
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,423
I'm here, sweetie. Come on. Mommy!

508
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:46,717
Mommy! Come on. Now, please, Ruth.

509
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:48,844
Mommy! Come on now, honey.

510
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:53,473
Mommy! Mommy! Come on.

511
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:04,735
She had a bad dream. She heard
bangs. Heard banging noise.

512
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:08,822
What kind of banging
noise? I... I don't know.

513
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:10,866
What difference does it make?

514
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:17,706
Come on, honey.

515
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:20,792
It's okay.

516
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:25,714
It's okay. Shh. Shh.

517
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:27,758
It's okay.

518
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,513
It's okay. It's okay.

519
00:58:56,078 --> 00:58:59,373
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

520
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:28,569
Take me back.

521
00:59:34,116 --> 00:59:37,578
Like you should Right now, lick it good

522
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:39,705

525
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:52,009

00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:56,680
That nigga, get on your knees A bitch
like me moans and screams Love this song.

527
00:59:56,722 --> 01:00:00,893
Thug misses know what I mean
At the club, so fresh, so clean

528
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:03,979
Hos hatin'niggas watchin'me

529
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,485
Why now?

530
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:38,240
I've stayed too long already.

531
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,746
You want me to do what?

532
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:31,627
I want you to give her
these, but not the portfolio.

533
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:34,379
Just the drawings... I
want the portfolio back.

534
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:36,632
Isn't she expecting you?

535
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:39,468
Tell her I'm not coming,

536
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:42,596
but I wanted her to have the drawings.

537
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:49,353
It... It might be, um, awkward...

538
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:51,355
to ask for the portfolio back.

539
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,107
It won't be a problem.

540
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:04,660
I
- I don't really understand. "He"... "He wants to give them to me." He doesn't want them?

541
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,954
He said he wanted you to have them.

542
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:09,790
Oh.

543
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:13,252
Uh, but when is he coming?
He's coming Friday, isn't he?

544
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:17,256
I have the whole day for him on
Friday. He knows I have the day.

545
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:20,467
Will you stop? Is he coming on Friday?

546
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,970
I-I don't know. Yes, you do know.

547
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:26,390
- Uh...
- "Did you look at those drawings?" Did he show you?

548
01:03:30,644 --> 01:03:32,813
My God, I'm locked out.

549
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:36,441
You're gonna have to break in. Me?

550
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:45,826
You're gonna have to carry me
over the glass. I have bare feet.

551
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:50,205
How dare you? How
dare you detest me? Ow!

552
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:54,418
You're not exactly living an "un-sordid" life
yourself, are you? Just... Please, I wanna go home.

553
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,461
Oh, go!

554
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:02,968
- Why did she think you looked at the drawings? Did you?
- No.

555
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:08,307
Oh, Christ. Of course you did. No.
I didn't. She exposed herself to me.

556
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:13,187
Jesus. She did what? She didn't mean to, but she
exposed herself. The wind, it b-blew her robe open.

557
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:17,191
- "Jesus Christ.!"
- And she locked herself out because of you.

558
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:20,986
She said you liked all the doors to be locked,
and you didn't like the gardener to be around.

559
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,280
She told you that? Yes.

560
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:26,867
She said she had the
whole day for you Friday.

561
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:29,494
I can't spend the whole
day with her Friday.

562
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:35,042
You're gonna have to come and pick me up
in 45 minutes. Make that a half an hour.

563
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:39,213
On Friday morning, you're going
to leave him at Mrs. Vaughn's.

564
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:42,424
"I know"... "for half an hour."

565
01:04:42,508 --> 01:04:46,428
No. You're never going back,

566
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:51,350
and it'll take him all day to
make his way back home by himself.

567
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:54,937
Mrs. Vaughn won't offer him a ride.

568
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,606
I don't expect him back before dark.

569
01:04:57,648 --> 01:05:00,400
Ted's gonna be really pissed off.

570
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:07,199
I read your, um... your story.

571
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:13,247
Oh. I thought you forgot. No. I just
didn't have a chance to get to it before.

572
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:17,251
It's not very good, is it? Oh,
it's, uh... it's very heartfelt,

573
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,670
very... very personal.

574
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:22,548
It's, um...

575
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:27,386
Well, it's just a collection of personal
anecdotes that don't really add up to much.

576
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:30,681
It's, uh... I was just tryin' to see if
I could write something that seemed true.

577
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:34,810
Oh, it seems true. It, uh,
just isn't very interesting.

578
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:38,981
Sort of a... an emotional
outburst, but, uh,

579
01:05:39,106 --> 01:05:42,150
it isn't really a story.

580
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:47,698
And that, uh... the guy, Hank... you
know, the one who dies at the end? Yeah.

581
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:51,869
You need to prepare a reader
for something like that. Uh...

582
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:56,707
It just... It didn't seem like
the way things happened. Well,

583
01:05:56,832 --> 01:06:01,170
you need to let your audience
guess what's gonna happen...

584
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:05,132
you know, anticipate what's gonna
happen... and then you surprise them.

585
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:08,802
But, um, you have to guide them
through it. You know what I mean? Yeah.

586
01:06:08,844 --> 01:06:12,848
There's a part of writing that, uh,

587
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:16,143
involves a certain manipulation.

588
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:21,607
That may seem cold to you, but it
is, you know, sort of cold. I-I guess.

589
01:06:21,732 --> 01:06:27,029
Everything in fiction is
a tool: Pain, betrayal,

590
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:30,032
even death.

591
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:33,285
These are, you know...

592
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:39,333
These are like, uh, different colors on
a painter's palette. You need to use them.

593
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:49,510
Also, the details... they could
be more specific, you know?

594
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:55,516
Specific details, they... they create
whole scenes in a reader's mind.

595
01:06:57,226 --> 01:07:01,063
Not being specific, that's just
sloppy. It's sloppy thinking.

596
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:04,650
S-Specific details? Yeah...

597
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:08,195
smells, taste... details.

598
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:13,784
But I'll tell ya, for a, uh...

599
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:16,078
for a first effort, it's not that bad.

600
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:18,247
You know, the, uh... Thanks.

601
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:23,085
The prose is a little purple, a little
pretentious. Thanks. Thanks anyway for reading it.

602
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:26,380
You're welcome.

603
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,804
You ever think about getting a computer?

604
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:39,184
Be easier to do your own revisions that
way, so you wouldn't need an assistant.

605
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:48,402
Maybe the next book. Yeah.

606
01:07:57,828 --> 01:08:03,417
Oh, boy. Uh, you better wait for me.

607
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:06,170
I'm not gonna last a
half hour with this woman.

608
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:09,715
Twenty minutes tops, maybe 10.

609
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:25,439
Five.

610
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:45,626
Ifhe hits you, hit him
back. He won't make a fist.

611
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:48,045
At worst, he'll slap you.

612
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,798
You should make a fist,
and punch him in the nose.

613
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:54,468
If you punch him in
the nose, he'll stop.

614
01:08:57,054 --> 01:09:00,516
You can call Alice to help
you with Ruth. Screw Alice.

615
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:03,143
You better start to like her a little.

616
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:08,649
When Ted kicks you out, you're going to
need a ride to the ferry at Orient Point.

617
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:11,318
And who's gonna explain this to Ruth?

618
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:17,449
I won't be a bad mother to her.

619
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:20,744
I'd rather be no mother than
to be a bad mother to her.

620
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:23,372
That doesn't make any sense.

621
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,671
I don't want her to be like me.

622
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:34,675
Remember, honey, don't cry when
the doctor takes the stitches out.

623
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,803
I promise you, it won't hurt.

624
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:42,182
Can I keep the stitches to show you?

625
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:55,696
You can take her anywhere for lunch. All she
ever eats is grilled cheese and french fries.

626
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:59,366
And ketchup. And ketchup.

627
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:01,410
I have money.

628
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:15,757
I love you.

629
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:17,885
So long, Eddie.

630
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,945
Evelyn. Evelyn, wait! Wait now!
Come here, you son of a bitch!

631
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,740
Come here, goddamn it! I'll
kill you, you fucking fraud!

632
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,742
Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn.

633
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:44,411
Evelyn!

634
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:08,477
Why the hell did he...

635
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:25,244
- Oh-oh.
- ""

636
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:28,247
- Run!

637
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:36,315
All right. And one more.

638
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:40,319
Did we get the picture? What picture?

639
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,198
Feet. Oh, the photograph.
No, it's not ready yet.

640
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:49,536
That's not very nice. My stitches
are ready. My cut's all fixed up.

641
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:54,333
Yeah. You know what? You're right. Let's go to the frame
shop and tell 'em to give us the picture. Good idea.

642
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:04,218
Ted Cole?

643
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,887
Yes. It is. It is Ted Cole.
Good morning, Mendelssohn.

644
01:13:06,929 --> 01:13:10,599
It "is" Ted Cole. It is.
Forgive me for bleeding.

645
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,185
Don't be silly. It's nothing
you need be forgiven for. Uh...

646
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:15,604
Could you... Ah! Get Mr. Cole a chair.

647
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:17,606
Can't you see he's bleeding?

648
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:20,526
Look, I... No, you look. If there's no
manager here, there must be someone else.

649
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:25,239
There must be someone else here besides you,
and I'm not leaving without that photograph.

650
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:30,452
Did you got mad at her? Yes, I did.

651
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:35,624
To put it simply, I need
a ride home. A ride? Yes.

652
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:38,252
I'll take you myself.

653
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:41,380
Of course, um, I'm going
to have to call the wife.

654
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:44,842
She's probably out shopping,
but not for too long.

655
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:49,930
You see, my car, it's in the shop. Mm.

656
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:52,808
I use a bicycle, else I'd take you home.

657
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:56,103
Mm. Too bad.

658
01:13:58,063 --> 01:14:00,732
You warned him, you disgusting cretin.

659
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:04,987
If you have killed him, Mrs.
Vaughn, you would have gone tojail.

660
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:09,825
You want this? Hmm? It's your
last paycheck. You're fired.

661
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:13,412
I understand that you're angry.
I'm very sorry about that.

662
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:18,709
When my customers are angry, I ask them to voice
their complaints in writing, if you don't mind.

663
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:24,006
I work for Ted Cole. I'm a writer's assistant.
Then you won't mind writing, will you?

664
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:40,439
"60 times." Really?

665
01:14:40,564 --> 01:14:43,317
Yes.

666
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:54,036
The Vaughns of Gin Lane?

667
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:59,708
We framed a painting by Sibley for
them called The Epitome of Diabolism.

668
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:02,711
Please go on.

669
01:15:03,754 --> 01:15:07,799
Your signature is very, very beautiful.

670
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:12,054
I need a pen with a broader
nib. Also, some red ink, hmm?

671
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:14,431
Red like blood, not like a fire engine.

672
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:16,517
Yes. Of course.

673
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:52,386
This is Ruth. She's four.

674
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:59,268
What do you want from
me? Just the photograph.

675
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:02,563
It's of Ruth's mother. She's in
a bed in a hotel room in Paris.

676
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:04,690
It's not a good picture of
the boys. It's only their feet.

677
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:07,985
- Yes, I know. Ruth likes the feet.
- Are the feet ready?

678
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,737
Yes, dear.

679
01:16:10,863 --> 01:16:14,199
I'll go check. Should be
almost ready. Excuse me, ma'am.

680
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:16,702
Can I have my writing back, please?

681
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:22,124
It's really not out of my way.
I'd be honored to take you. Really.

682
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:25,419
No. That's all right. Someone
else will come along soon.

683
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,422
It's not trouble. Really, I don't mind.

684
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:32,885
No. Really. There you are. If you need
a few minutes, I can run a few errands.

685
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,888
I-I'd be thrilled to
take you. Really. No.

686
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:44,146
There's no charge for
the photograph. Thank you.

687
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:53,322
Yes. I'm sorry.

688
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:56,742
- Is the blood all gone?
- Yes, dear. See?

689
01:16:56,825 --> 01:16:59,119
As good as new.

690
01:16:59,161 --> 01:17:03,415
- Okay. Thanks.
- Young man, if you're ever interested in a job,

691
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:05,417
perhaps next summer.

692
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:10,380
I can always use an extra
hand in the summer. Thank you.

693
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:14,259
She wrote her freshman English
term paper on you. Shut up.

694
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:18,347
Mmm. What was the title
of your term paper?

695
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:25,812
Uh, "An Analysis of the Atavistic Symbols
of Fear in "The Door in the Floor. "

696
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:30,484
As you know, um, myths and fairy tales
of tribal peoples are full of images...

697
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:33,654
like magic doors and
children disappearing...

698
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:37,366
and people being so frightened
their hair turns white overnight.

699
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:44,206
And the vagina? When the, uh, little boy's in
the womb, the door in the floor is a... vagina.

700
01:17:44,248 --> 01:17:47,668
How long was this paper?
"Twenty-eight pages"...

701
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:50,963
not counting the
footnotes and bibliography.

702
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:54,007
"But"...

703
01:17:54,091 --> 01:17:58,178
I don't suppose you girls have a
car? Believe it or not, I need a ride.

704
01:18:21,118 --> 01:18:23,078
Ahh.

705
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,416
Oh. Is this sandwich for me? Yes.

706
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:31,003
These slippers are just wonderful.

707
01:18:31,128 --> 01:18:34,298
They were a Christmas gift
from me to my late husband.

708
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:36,341
Ah. May I? Please.

709
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:45,893
I'll get these clothes right back to you. I
was just gonna give them to the Goodwill anyway.

710
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:47,895
Look at that.

711
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:51,398
Phil was almost exactly your size.

712
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:55,194
Oh.

713
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:01,283
You know, this is rather serendipitous.

714
01:19:01,325 --> 01:19:05,579
I've been looking for two suitable
subjects for a mother and daughter portrait.

715
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:08,916
Something I'm thinking
about for my book.

716
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:12,503
At first I would want to draw
you and your daughter together.

717
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:15,088
That way, when I draw
each one of you separately,

718
01:19:15,214 --> 01:19:19,635
uh, the presence of the other
one is... is, uh, somehow there.

719
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:21,637
How long would it take, and...

720
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:25,474
Uh... which one of us would you
want to draw first... separately?

721
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:28,936
I should do Glorie first.

722
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:33,524
First, uh... Well, first, the two
of you together, and then, uh...

723
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:38,987
then Glorie alone, and then when
Glorie's back at college, you alone.

724
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:42,366
Mr. Cole, you really are an enigma.

725
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:46,328
So which are you, and
artist or a writer?

726
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,956
Oh, Glorie, I'm...

727
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:52,835
I'm neither, really. I'm... I'm
just an entertainer of children,

728
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,379
and I like to draw.

729
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,506
What sort of drawings
did you have in mind?

730
01:19:57,548 --> 01:20:00,259
- ""
- "" "Don't"... "No, no, no.! Don't"... "Don't stop."

731
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,512
My goodness. Wiper! Wiper.

732
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:21,905
Uh, yeah. Why don't you, uh, just
come in and wait on the porch.

733
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:23,991
I'll be right there.

734
01:21:42,486 --> 01:21:47,074
Would you like, uh, some
refreshments, some water or some tea?

735
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:52,371
For the whole rest of your life, whenever you
need to feel brave, just look at your scar.

736
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:57,918
Your hand will grow bigger, and your finger will grow
bigger, but your scar will always stay the same size.

737
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,381
And it will always show up in your
fingerprint. What's a fingerprint?

738
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:04,424
I'll show you.

739
01:22:27,698 --> 01:22:31,827
- "Those are my fingerprints."
- Ooh. That's really neat, Ruthie.

740
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:34,955
- So you were at the doctor's office
getting the stitches taken out? - Uh-huh.

741
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:38,000
And we went to the
beach. And we had lunch.

742
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,295
And Eddie showed me my fingerprint.
Oh, that's really neat, Ruth.

743
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:44,965
- I see the photograph was ready finally.
- We got the feet back!

744
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:48,594
Look at all this sand in your hair,
Ruth. You're gonna need a bath.

745
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:54,600
Well, I was waiting quite a while
for you this morning. Where were ya?

746
01:22:55,726 --> 01:22:58,312
Where's Marion going? I'll give
her the bath. Better read that.

747
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,856
- Answer me.
- Read that first.

748
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:04,484
What's this? It's the only good
writing I've done all summer.

749
01:23:08,197 --> 01:23:10,199
"60 times"?

750
01:23:16,288 --> 01:23:18,290
Okay. Let's run.

751
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:24,755
Did you saw that?

752
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:30,385
Where are all the other pictures? Uh,
I don't know. Maybe Mommy moved them.

753
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:36,433
Look at you. You've got sand in your toes and in
your hair and in your ears. I got it in my crack too.

754
01:23:36,517 --> 01:23:39,353
Well, I guess it's a
good time for a bath then.

755
01:23:41,104 --> 01:23:45,651
But Mommy didn't move those
things. What are those things?

756
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:48,070
They're picture hooks.

757
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:54,034
- Mommy moved all the pictures but not the picture hooks.
- I'll give Ruth the bath.

758
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:57,037
I'll take a quick shower.
Yeah. Make it quick.

759
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:01,542
Why would Mommy do that?

760
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:05,963
I don't know, sweetie.

761
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:14,972
Hi. This is Ted. I
can't play today, Dave.

762
01:24:15,097 --> 01:24:17,099
Yeah, my wife's left me.

763
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:21,395
No, no. I'm okay.

764
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:27,025
Yeah. All right. Yeah.

765
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:30,696
I'll see you then. Bye.

766
01:24:35,284 --> 01:24:37,411
Aah! Where the fuck is my wife?

767
01:24:37,536 --> 01:24:39,538
I don't know. Don't lie to me.

768
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:45,586
Jesus!

769
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:47,588
Christ!

770
01:24:47,588 --> 01:24:50,591
I hit you with an open hand...
with the flat of my hand!

771
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:53,010
You clench your fist, you
punch me in the nose? I'm sorry.

772
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:55,971
Jesus Christ.! I'm sorry. Marion
said it was gonna make you stop.

773
01:24:56,013 --> 01:24:59,433
"Marion said"? If she thinks she's
got a rat's ass of a chance...

774
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:02,186
to get custody of Ruth, she's
got another think coming.

775
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:06,690
She doesn't expect to get custody of
Ruth. She has no intention of trying.

776
01:25:06,732 --> 01:25:12,154
- She told you that?
- "She told me everything I'm telling you."

777
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:20,746
What kind of mother doesn't even
try to get custody of her daughter?

778
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:24,208
I don't know. She didn't tell me that.

779
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:27,586
God.

780
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:31,340
Okay. Okay.

781
01:25:33,759 --> 01:25:36,011
Christ.

782
01:25:36,053 --> 01:25:39,348
Why... Why did she have to take all
of the photographs? There're negatives.

783
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:43,810
She could have taken the negatives and had
prints ofher own made. She took the negatives too.

784
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:48,774
The hell she did. Go look for yourself.

785
01:25:52,236 --> 01:25:57,574
She can't have the
photographs and the negatives.

786
01:25:57,658 --> 01:26:01,954
They were my sons too. I should have half the
photographs, for Chrissake. What about Ruth?

787
01:26:02,037 --> 01:26:05,374
Ruth should have some of the photographs.
Marion said you'd say that. But she said no.

788
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:11,004
Oh. Well, obviously,
she went to New York.

789
01:26:11,088 --> 01:26:13,507
I doubt it. What do you know, Eddie?

790
01:26:13,549 --> 01:26:19,471
That's the only place she could go. I even know where in
the city she is. I just can't imagine her goin'to New York.

791
01:26:19,555 --> 01:26:21,849
You don't have an imagination, Eddie.

792
01:26:23,642 --> 01:26:27,145
Christ. Aren't you planning on
getting a divorce with her anyway?

793
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:29,523
That Marion's question,
or is that your question?

794
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:35,028
- It's mine.
- Eddie, just stick to what Marion told you to say, okay?

795
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:40,075
- She didn't tell me to get the photograph. That was my idea.
- Well, that was a good idea.

796
01:26:40,117 --> 01:26:43,412
- "I was thinking of Ruth."
- Yeah. I know you were.

797
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:49,960
Thank you. You want a drink?

798
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:54,173
No.

799
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:57,718
What day is tomorrow, Saturday? Yeah.

800
01:26:57,759 --> 01:27:03,098
I want you out of here by tomorrow. Sunday at the
latest. That's fine. I just need a ride to the ferry.

801
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:07,269
Alice can take you.

802
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:11,023
What about this one? Tell it!

803
01:27:11,064 --> 01:27:14,610
I'm sorry, Ruth. I don't
know. Okay? I just...

804
01:27:14,651 --> 01:27:19,865
This is the one with Thomas in the tall
hat. Timothy is trying to reach Thomas's hat.

805
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:25,913
Timothy can't reach Thomas's hat, 'cause Thomas is
standing on a ball. Timothy got mad and started a fight.

806
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:29,750
Was the fight in the picture? No. The
fight was after the picture, you dummy!

807
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:33,212
Okay. We're gonna go watch a
movie. Yes. We're gonna go. No! No!

808
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:35,631
We're gonna go pick a
video. Yes, we are. No!

809
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:38,759
Ruthie, stop it! No! No!

810
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,761
Stop it! No!

811
01:27:40,844 --> 01:27:45,516
Oh, Alice.

812
01:27:47,643 --> 01:27:49,645
What? What have you
done to Alice, Eddie?

813
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,523
I didn't do anything. She was
crying when I first got here.

814
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:55,817
I've been asking her what's wrong,
and she won't even talk to me.

815
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:03,158
Where's Ruthie?

816
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:07,538
Uh, she's asleep. She was crying.

817
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:16,004
I'm sorry, Alice, for
springing all of this on you.

818
01:28:16,088 --> 01:28:19,591
Fuck you, Ted. I appreciate
you pickin' up the slack.

819
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:27,474
I've spent years trying to get
over my own fucked-up family.

820
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:30,102
And I've done the
best I could with Ruth.

821
01:28:30,227 --> 01:28:33,105
No.

822
01:28:33,146 --> 01:28:37,526
No. I just can't anymore.
I'm gonna quit. I quit.

823
01:28:38,569 --> 01:28:41,405
And you should have
the decency to quit too.

824
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:44,283
It's... It's too late for me to
quit, Alice. I just got fired.

825
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:47,578
I never knew you were such
a superior person, Alice.

826
01:28:47,703 --> 01:28:51,164
Alice has been superior to me
all summer. Haven't you Alice?

827
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:55,002
I "am" morally superior to
you, Eddie. I know that much.

828
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:59,006
"Morally superior." What a concept.

829
01:28:59,131 --> 01:29:03,594
Don't you ever feel morally
superior, Eddie? Hmm? To you I do.

830
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:08,015
Yeah. You see? Everyone feels
morally superior to someone.

831
01:29:08,098 --> 01:29:10,726
Fuck you guys.

832
01:29:10,851 --> 01:29:13,687
There goes my ride to the ferry.

833
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:17,024
Oh, you're a smart boy, Eddie. You'll
think of someone to give you a ride.

834
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:26,825
You want a drink?

835
01:29:26,909 --> 01:29:28,827
No, thanks.

836
01:29:28,911 --> 01:29:31,330
Oh, for Chrissake. Have a beer.

837
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:37,753
Jesus. Look at this yard.

838
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:46,261
Cannot believe she doesn't want
custody of her own daughter.

839
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:49,264
What kind of mother leaves her daughter?

840
01:29:49,348 --> 01:29:52,434
I don't know her well
enough to judge her.

841
01:29:52,518 --> 01:29:54,603
Let me tell you something, Eddie.

842
01:29:54,645 --> 01:29:58,398
I don't know her well
enough to judge her either.

843
01:29:58,482 --> 01:30:01,944
Yeah, well, don't forget,
it's you she's really leaving.

844
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:05,072
Guess she knew you pretty well.

845
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:12,079
Well enough to judge
me, you mean? Certainly.

846
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:16,542
But then, she's leaving
you too, isn't she, Eddie?

847
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:24,508
You don't expect her to call you
up for a secret rendezvous, do you?

848
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:30,264
No. I don't expect to hear
from her. No, me neither.

849
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:33,767
Hmm. I have drawings of her.

850
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:39,106
I drew her long ago,
before the accident.

851
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:46,113
She was so... so incredible.
So fucking beautiful. Amazing.

852
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:49,700
You should have known her then.

853
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:52,995
Oh, Marion.

854
01:30:54,997 --> 01:30:57,708
She hated to pose for me.

855
01:31:01,879 --> 01:31:05,132
These are the only drawings I kept.

856
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:10,470
I was never good enough to draw Marion.

857
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:14,850
I didn't know how to. I didn't
have the ability, I guess.

858
01:31:19,563 --> 01:31:22,316
You want one? You can have one.

859
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:24,443
No. Ruth should have them.

860
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:26,904
Mmm. That's a good idea.

861
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:31,158
You're full of good ideas, Eddie.

862
01:31:32,201 --> 01:31:34,203
Wrong cubes.

863
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:52,721
Marion?

864
01:31:52,763 --> 01:31:55,057
Jesus, aren't you the optimist?

865
01:31:58,769 --> 01:32:01,355
Forget the light, Eddie.

866
01:32:02,481 --> 01:32:04,858
This story's better in the dark.

867
01:32:09,947 --> 01:32:13,408
What story? You told me you
asked Marion to tell it to you,

868
01:32:13,492 --> 01:32:16,787
but Marion can't handle this story.

869
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:19,623
Turns her to stone
just thinking about it.

870
01:32:19,665 --> 01:32:23,085
Remember, you turned her to
stone just asking her about it.

871
01:32:24,086 --> 01:32:26,088
I remember.

872
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:29,800
Go on.

873
01:32:33,387 --> 01:32:35,389
Well, here's the deal.

874
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:42,938
Thomas had his driver's
license, but Timothy did not.

875
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:49,528
Tommy was 17 and...
been driving for a year.

876
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:55,409
Timmy was 15. He had only
started to take driving lessons.

877
01:32:56,451 --> 01:33:00,414
It was Ted's opinion that
Timmy, who was only learning,

878
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:05,711
was already a more attentive
student than Thomas ever had been.

879
01:33:07,713 --> 01:33:11,967
Timmy studied the
driving manual diligently.

880
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:16,805
He was a more patient
driver than Thomas.

881
01:33:16,847 --> 01:33:21,018
Not that Tommy was a bad
driver. Tommy was a good driver.

882
01:33:22,728 --> 01:33:26,815
He was alert, confident.

883
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:31,445
He had excellent reflexes.

884
01:33:33,155 --> 01:33:39,119
And he was cynical enough to
assume... as Ted had instructed him...

885
01:33:40,162 --> 01:33:44,041
that every other driver is a bad driver.

886
01:33:44,124 --> 01:33:47,127
Who taught to you drive, Eddie?

887
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:50,422
Um, my dad.

888
01:33:50,506 --> 01:33:52,925
Well, good for him.

889
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:56,845
Tell him for me, he did an
excellent job, would you?

890
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,182
Okay.

891
01:34:15,948 --> 01:34:18,659
Keep... Keep going.

892
01:34:19,743 --> 01:34:25,666
We were out west, actually, and
it was after a long day of skiing.

893
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:29,044
"It was snowing"... a wet, thick snow.

894
01:34:31,213 --> 01:34:35,634
At 17 and 15, respectively,

895
01:34:35,676 --> 01:34:39,972
Thomas and Timothy could ski
the pants off their parents.

896
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:45,686
That day, in fact, Ted and Marion had
retired to the bar at the ski resort...

897
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:48,522
where they were waiting
for a very long time...

898
01:34:48,564 --> 01:34:52,401
for Thomas and Timothy to
finish their last run...

899
01:34:52,401 --> 01:34:55,988
and the last run after that.

900
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:59,700
I get the picture. You were drunk.

901
01:35:01,618 --> 01:35:05,080
Well, that, uh...

902
01:35:05,122 --> 01:35:08,834
that was one aspect of
what would become trivial...

903
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:13,255
in the... area of the ongoing
argument between Marion and Ted.

904
01:35:13,297 --> 01:35:19,303
I mean, Marion said that Ted was
drunk, although in his view, he wasn't.

905
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:23,724
Marion, while not drunk, certainly had had
more to drink than she was accustomed to.

906
01:35:23,724 --> 01:35:27,936
Besides, Tommy had not been
drinking. He had his license.

907
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:31,315
There was no disagreement as to
who among them should be the driver.

908
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,443
And, brothers being brothers,

909
01:35:34,484 --> 01:35:38,572
Timmy sat beside him
in the passenger seat.

910
01:35:39,615 --> 01:35:41,700
And as for the parents,

911
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:46,747
Ted and Marion... sat in the backseat.

912
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:52,461
Ted and Marion began to quarrel...

913
01:35:52,503 --> 01:35:56,048
about the best route back to the hotel.

914
01:35:56,131 --> 01:36:00,093
There was gonna have to be a left
turn no matter how Tommy did it.

915
01:36:00,219 --> 01:36:04,473
So, Tommy moves into the center lane.

916
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:07,601
It's, um, a turning lane.
It's not a passing lane.

917
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:10,771
He puts on his blinker,

918
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:15,651
not knowing that both lights are
covered with wet, sticky snow...

919
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:19,780
that his father failed to clear
off at the same time his father...

920
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,449
failed to clear off the rear window.

921
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:30,874
Any cars coming up from behind Tommy's
car can't see the directional signals or...

922
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:32,876
the brake lights or the tail lights.

923
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:37,381
The car is not visible,

924
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:41,426
or it's visible only at
the last second to any...

925
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:45,347
anyone approaching from behind.

926
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:54,982
And then, the interior of
the car is filled with light.

927
01:36:54,982 --> 01:36:58,944
- "It's the headlights from the car" coming up from behind.
- ""

928
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:13,834
The snowplow cut the car
almost perfectly in half.

929
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:27,931
Tommy was killed by the steering column.
Crushed his chest. Died instantly.

930
01:37:29,016 --> 01:37:32,269
And Ted...

931
01:37:32,311 --> 01:37:36,231
was trapped in the backseat
for all of 20 minutes.

932
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:41,028
He...

933
01:37:41,153 --> 01:37:47,117
- He couldn't see Tommy, but he knew he
was dead because Marion could see him.

934
01:37:48,202 --> 01:37:51,705
She couldn't see Timmy. He
was directly in front ofher.

935
01:37:51,747 --> 01:37:56,460
Ted, however, could see that
Timmy was still breathing.

936
01:37:56,543 --> 01:38:01,423
Ted could also see that the
snowplow, as it cut the car in half,

937
01:38:01,465 --> 01:38:05,511
also cut Timmy's left
leg off at the thigh.

938
01:38:12,935 --> 01:38:17,231
Timothy Cole bled to death
of a severed femoral artery.

939
01:38:21,318 --> 01:38:24,738
Marion knew that Tommy was dead,

940
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:27,908
but only that Timmy had been
carried from the wreckage,

941
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:31,411
hopefully... to the hospital.

942
01:38:32,454 --> 01:38:35,874
And then Marion,

943
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:38,794
she sees Timmy's shoe in the wreckage.

944
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:44,383
"Oh, look. Timmy's shoe.
He's gonna need his shoe. "

945
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:51,598
And she walks over to it,
reaches down to pick it up.

946
01:38:58,981 --> 01:39:02,401
Ted... Ted wanted to stop her.

947
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:14,079
Talk about turned to stone.

948
01:39:16,331 --> 01:39:19,835
I couldn't move. I couldn't even speak.

949
01:39:37,019 --> 01:39:40,606
And that was when Ted allowed
his wife to discover...

950
01:39:40,689 --> 01:39:45,319
that her younger son's
shoe was attached...

951
01:39:48,322 --> 01:39:50,824
to a leg.

952
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:59,208
And that was when Marion realized
that Timmy was gone... too.

953
01:40:04,713 --> 01:40:07,799
And that...

954
01:40:07,883 --> 01:40:11,094
that is the end of the story.

955
01:40:42,668 --> 01:40:45,671
I hired you, Eddie, because
you look like Thomas.

956
01:40:47,965 --> 01:40:50,509
I gave her you.

957
01:40:58,892 --> 01:41:01,395
See you in the morning, Eddie.

958
01:41:37,556 --> 01:41:41,602
It's Eduardo. What's Eduardo doing here?

959
01:41:42,644 --> 01:41:45,606
I don't know. Maybe Mrs.
Vaughn hired him to kill you.

960
01:41:45,606 --> 01:41:48,442
No, no. Not... Not Eduardo.

961
01:41:49,443 --> 01:41:54,156
You don't see her out there anywhere, do
you? She's not in the cab or in the back.

962
01:41:54,198 --> 01:41:58,076
Maybe she's lying underneath the truck.

963
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,705
- I'm being serious, for Chrissake.
- So am I.

964
01:42:05,834 --> 01:42:11,215
Why... Why don't you go out
there and, um, see what he wants?

965
01:42:11,298 --> 01:42:14,801
Not me. I've been fired.

966
01:42:14,927 --> 01:42:18,347
Oh, for Chrissake. What?

967
01:42:19,348 --> 01:42:21,850
Wha...

968
01:42:21,934 --> 01:42:25,312
At least go with me then.
I can't go out there alone.

969
01:42:25,354 --> 01:42:27,898
Mrs. Vaughn fired me.
Eduardo, Eduardo, Eduardo.

970
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:30,359
Let me make sure I understand you.

971
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:33,612
You think you saved my life,
and this cost you your job?

972
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:37,533
Yes, I did save your life, and it
did cost me my job. Well, Eduardo,

973
01:42:37,574 --> 01:42:41,203
I play squash regularly, and
I'm pretty fleet of foot, um,

974
01:42:41,286 --> 01:42:43,789
but I do... I do appreciate
your brave warning.

975
01:42:43,872 --> 01:42:49,044
How much money are we talking about exactly?
I'm not here for a "hand-down," Mr. Cole.

976
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:53,549
I was hoping you might
have some work for me.

977
01:42:53,632 --> 01:42:55,634
Ah.

978
01:42:58,387 --> 01:43:01,723
Let me... Let me show you
where I want to put a pool.

979
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:05,853
I want, uh, more lawn, like
an athletic field, you know?

980
01:43:05,936 --> 01:43:08,856
Just, uh, pretty big. You
want some lines painted on it?

981
01:43:08,897 --> 01:43:12,985
No, no. Just the size
of an athletic field.

982
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:17,239
Wow. That's a lotta lawn.
A lotta mowin'. All right.

983
01:43:17,281 --> 01:43:20,951
And a lot of fertilizers. Yeah.

984
01:43:21,034 --> 01:43:25,247
Well, whatever you say. I'm putting
you in charge. Thank you, Mr. Cole.

985
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:27,875
What about your wife?

986
01:43:28,917 --> 01:43:34,882
What about her? Oh, uh, does
she work, or what does she do?

987
01:43:34,965 --> 01:43:37,009
Yeah, sure. Sure, she works.

988
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:41,180
She cooks, she look
after our children. Mmm.

989
01:43:42,264 --> 01:43:45,392
Maybe, uh... Maybe she'd
like to clean my house.

990
01:43:45,434 --> 01:43:49,188
Or maybe she'd like
to cook for me and, uh,

991
01:43:49,271 --> 01:43:52,024
look after my daughter, Ruth.

992
01:43:52,107 --> 01:43:54,026
Sure. I'll ask her. Yeah?

993
01:43:55,152 --> 01:43:58,197
Good. Good. Excellent.

994
01:43:59,281 --> 01:44:03,327
Gotta do something about
these straggly flower beds too.

995
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:05,913
Oh. You can start today, Eduardo.

996
01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:11,585
You can begin by taking my former assistant
to Orient Point, hmm? Sure. I can do that.

997
01:44:13,003 --> 01:44:16,715
Uh, immediately. Before
breakfast, huh? Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

998
01:44:33,065 --> 01:44:35,943
Well, you're a fairly
good driver, Eddie.

999
01:44:38,195 --> 01:44:42,491
About Marion, there's
another thing you should know.

1000
01:44:43,534 --> 01:44:46,787
Even before the
accident... I mean, even...

1001
01:44:46,912 --> 01:44:50,082
even if there had
never been an accident,

1002
01:44:50,165 --> 01:44:52,084
she still would be difficult.

1003
01:44:54,837 --> 01:44:56,964
I don't believe it.

1004
01:45:01,134 --> 01:45:05,639

1005
01:45:05,681 --> 01:45:08,350
an "AirJordan," I think he called it.

1006
01:45:13,522 --> 01:45:16,400
Specific details, Eddie.

1007
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:19,862
Specific details.

1008
