Ew, Bobbi, I don't want to talk about it

3
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:01,951
Now is a perfect time to talk about it.

4
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:02,924
Let it go, Baby.

5
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:07,685
I don't want to let it go.

6
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:09,666
You're my tenacious little tiger, aren't you?

7
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,605
Rawr.

8
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:15,714
You make me crazy.

9
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:17,730
You are crazy.

10
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,016
About you.

11
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:21,727
No way.

12
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:23,396
And you're crazy about me, right?

13
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,550
No way.

14
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:29,444
And you're making me crazy with that music.

15
00:02:29,547 --> 00:02:30,417
That's the one.

16
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:40,878
You do what?

17
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:41,956
Come on, Travis.

18
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,702
We only have a week's vacation.

19
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:46,577
We've been on the road for four hours, OK?

20
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:49,011
Two of those hours were spent at that secluded little--

21
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:56,241
Travis, look out!

22
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,471

Shit.

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,077
Ah, shit.

43
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,390
You've been in a very bad accident.

44
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:41,700
You've sustained a number of serious internal injuries.

45
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:43,264
Here.

46
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:44,758
You have to take these.

Hello.

55
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:40,603
Have a seat.

56
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,261
What about Albuquerque?

57
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:46,408
Anything?

58
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:47,346
No.

Miss Firkin, would you please not smoke in my office?

60
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:56,384
Wyatt, what happened in Wyoming?

61
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:58,711
I thought you said you had a solid lead.

62
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:01,979
That case had no connection on the abduction of Bobbi Ryland.

63
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,439
Yeah, but how do you know that?

64
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:04,933
Because it's my job to find out.

65
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,255
Yeah, but how do you know?

66
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:07,193
Hey.

67
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:16,160
Travis, was Bobbi involved in any type of religious group?

68
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:20,817
Any connection with any type of cult activity,

69
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:22,103
anything like that?

70
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,406
What are you getting at?

71
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,213
Another girl was kidnapped last week

72
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:31,001
out of a trailer park, about 250 miles

73
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:32,738
from where Bobbi was taken.

74
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:36,075
Pretty blonde, blue eyes.

75
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,925
You do I mean what I say, Wyatt.

76
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,123
You don't get the guys that took Bobbi, I will.

77
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,590
I'm going to kill every one of them.

78
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:45,599
I didn't hear that, Travis.

79
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,593
How long, Travis?

80
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:30,088
How long is this going to take?

81
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,245
I don't know what else to do.

82
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,459
I loved her, too.

Who is it?

87

No shit!

00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:19,547
I thought you had another six months.

Out on good behavior Couldn't believe it when little sis

93
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:24,275
wrote me about Bobbi.

94
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:25,699
They took her in fucking broad daylight?

95
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,766
Yeah, I wish I would have had one of these.

96
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,156
I would have shot that witch so fast.

97
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:33,311
- Who? - A woman was driving the car.

98
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:34,250
She dies.

99
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,222
How many others?

100
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:36,717
At least four.

101
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:38,316
I was seeing so many stars when I went down,

102
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:39,949
it could have been 20.

103
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:40,958
Cops?

104
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:42,035
Well, for the first month or two,

105
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,077
they were all over the place.

106
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,580
They never found any real clues.

107
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:49,056
It was a total set up with that motorcycle, man.

108
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,794
About an hour earlier, there was a guy staring

109
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,740
at Bobbi at a Stop 'n Go.

110
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:55,382
He was in the next aisle, and I didn't get a look at him.

111
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:58,023
The worst part is, the Illinois police found two cases

112
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,803
that were similar, and they found pieces of torn jeans

113
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:03,480
like the ones Bobby was wearing with blood all over them.

114
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:04,731
It was her blood type, and then--

115
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:06,157
Like Bobby's the only one who wears

116
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:08,728
a size five 501 blue jeans and has a type B blood.

117
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:10,362
They never found a body?

118
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,301
She's alive.

119
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:12,274
She's alive.

120
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:16,236
Where do you think she is?

121
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:21,657
Different times, I've thought Seattle,

122
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:24,960
San Jose, Tucson, Albuquerque.

Thank god she's got that [inaudible] line at work.

128
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:42,234
I put the pieces together best I can.

129
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,381
I get out and I go drive.

130
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:45,293
I look and I ask questions.

131
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:46,509
And I get fucking madder and madder

132
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:47,691
trying to find out where the hell

133
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:51,966
she is and just bring her back, man.

134
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,939
We'll get her.

135
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:54,642
It's time to call the posse.

136

137
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,354
Don't worry.

138
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,439
You're going to love these guys, if I can get them.

139
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,941
Travis, was there any communication between you

140
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:02,949
or anybody else?

141
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:05,069
Any demands or ransom note?

142
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:06,702
No, nothing.

143
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:08,302
Well, that's a clue.

144
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:09,518
I'll see you.

Who are these people?

152
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,549

154
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,978
Do you think we lost them?

155
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,369
Yeah, I think so.

156
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:01,688
What the hell was that?

157
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:04,365
It was just this guy's cousin I killed.

158
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,443
- What? - What?

159
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:06,485
It was an accident!

160
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:07,944
His bark is worse than his bite.

161
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,475
Get out of town, man.

162
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:10,829
I did.

163
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:11,872
Hey, I'm hungry.

164
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,019
You guys want to get a burger?

165
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:18,615
Marion, we've got a situation here.

166
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,361
No, you are not to negotiate on her behalf.

167
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,724
It's not your job!

168
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:27,270
Do not take a personal check as a deposit.

169
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:28,348
What?

170
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,502
It's Patrice again.

171
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:31,996
She's just gone off the deep end completely.

172
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:34,256
You know how they do sometimes.

173
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,758
They're okay for a while, and then they just snap.

174
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:38,393
God damn it.

175
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:39,643
God damn it!

176
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:41,833
She should have been good for at least two more.

177
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,119
Mary, I've got to go here.

178
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:45,309
Yeah.

179
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:47,985
Listen, don't touch her. Don't force her.

180
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,120
Just let her do as much as she wants, which will be all of it.

181
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,030
Got it.

182
00:15:58,134 --> 00:15:58,968
Damn it.

Take it easy.

186
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:27,990
This is ridiculous.

187
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:32,717
I feel like The Princess and the Pea.

188
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:34,837
Where the hell did these come from?

189
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:37,096
You didn't expect me to leave them in complete stranger's

190
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,981
car, did you?

191
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:42,102
Since when did you start transporting guns?

192
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:45,126
They're not mine.

193
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,384
Why am I not surprised by that?

194
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,470
They're Loch's.

195
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,841
That's how I know he's going to be here.

196
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,587
He doesn't like to be away from his babies too long.

197
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,878
Does this have anything to do with that cousin guy?

198
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:02,747
And who's Loch?

199
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:04,346
The cousin guy is pissed at me.

200
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:06,848
Loch? He hates me.

201
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:08,551
Why?

202
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:10,741
Life.

203
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,409
So now you're going to kill the guy?

204
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:13,835
No he's in the posse.

205
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:15,537
You mean he's going to come with us?

206
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:17,936
Yeah, he wouldn't miss it for the world.

207
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,813
Why?

208
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:20,786
You'll see.

209
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,654
What the hell are we doing here?

210
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,428
He does a lot of business in this part of town.

211
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:02,911
Yeah, well what kind of business?

212
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:22,341
Put the gun down.

213
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:23,313
Yo, man.

214
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:24,808
What's happening?

215
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:27,589
I know Chopper.

216
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:28,736
Where's Chopper?

217
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,794
Boy's fucking dead man.

218
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:34,088
Vino, I did time with Vino.

219
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,799
Vato's six feet under, homes.

220
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:39,232
Oh, no.

221
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,109
What's Loch?

222
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,160
Who the fuck is Loch, man?

223
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,168
Get him!

224
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,802
[threatening sounds]

225
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:48,894
Come on, man!

226
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:54,004
[gunshot]

227
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,642
Who the fuck is this wimp?

228
00:19:00,746 --> 00:19:02,832
He's my best friend from fifth grade.

229
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:04,363
Like I'm supposed to believe that shit.

230
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:05,682
Hey, Lonnie.

231
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:07,421
Man, are you selling us defective shit here?

232
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:08,567
What's your problem, man?

233
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,445
You want to die? - Come on, Lonnie.

234
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,418
I wouldn't lie to you.

235
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:14,442
You know that.

236
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:17,326
Ask him who our seventh grade art teacher was.

237
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,820
We never had seventh grade art class.

238
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,037
Right. See?

239
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:22,123
No art class?

240
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,478
Damn.

241
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,911
That would piss [gunshot] me [gunshot] off.

242
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:26,954
[gunshot]

243
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:33,592
Best friends, huh?

244
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,330
You didn't tell him about the--

245
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:36,269
No way, Loch, man.

246
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:37,311
No way.

247
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,980
- Don't call me that! - Lighten up.

248
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,301
He doesn't know what it means.

249
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:44,680
Yeah, well, he'd better not ever know, huh?

250
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:48,572
So, we going to get to kill some people or what?

251
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:49,963
[gunshots]

252
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,957
Hey, you're OK, man.

253
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,109
[sirens]

254
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,689
- Love this guy or what? - Or what.

255
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:08,662
Yo, Reb.

256
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:09,669
Take this piece.

257
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,720
[sirens]

258
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,156
So, what's the deal?

259
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,824
- We've got to get his girl. - How much?

260
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:26,040
- Run! - How much?

261
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:26,805
Run!

262
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,126
[dramatic music playing]

263
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,777
So, how much?

264
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:55,098
We'll work it out.

265
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:57,599
You bet your ass we will.

266
00:20:57,704 --> 00:21:01,040
I hate to remind you about this, Loch,

267
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:06,360
but she was my sister's best friend, and besides, you know,

268
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:07,437
I did save your--

269
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,375
All right, man.

270
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,078
We'll work it out.

271
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:10,947
Thanks, man.

272
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,580
So, let's go get the professor

273
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:13,552
And Sue.

274
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:15,048
Let's get Sue.

275
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:15,986
Ah, man.

276
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:16,820
Not Sue.

277
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:18,628
He drives me fucking crazy.

278
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,991
Oh, like that's going to be a personality change for you now,

279
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:22,104
right?

280
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:25,927
Shut up, asshole.

281
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,343
Do you know where to find him?

282
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,464
Hey, I'm part Indian, man.

283
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,610
Oh, yeah, Loch--

284
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:44,348
Lonnie!

285
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:45,322
Lonnie.

286
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:46,434
This is Travis.

287
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:51,612
I'd check the safety on that thing

288
00:21:51,716 --> 00:21:53,316
before I'd go pointing it south.

289
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,232
You're OK, kid.

290
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:02,039
He's a jerk.

291
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:04,264
So let's go get the rest of the posse.

292
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,344
Where's the stuntman at?

293
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:16,533
Where is the stuntman at?

294
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:18,618
Does anybody know where the stuntman is?

295
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:19,591
Robert!

296
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,006
- Yes, sir. - God damn it.

297
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,500
I told Sterling I don't want anything

298
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:27,030
to do with that wacko stuntman.

299
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:29,670
There It be 1,700 guys in the Stuntman's Association,

300
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:32,034
and we got a hire Suicide McVeigh?

301
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:33,181
Then where the hell is he?

302
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:34,434
Find him will you, please?

303
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:35,407
Yes, sir.

304
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:36,761
Go, go!

305
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:37,769
Jesus Christ, come one!

306
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:38,951
We got a movie to make here.

307
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:40,203
After this shot, we can all go home.

308
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:42,739
I got some tickets to the Tyson fight.

309
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:44,269
Get away from me.

310
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:45,417
Oh, you feel so good.

311
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,406
I want a part in your next movie.

312
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,803
I'll give you a part in my next movie.

313

Whatever you want.

314
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:53,237
Where is the stuntman at?

315
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,899
I can't get enough of you!

316
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:05,749

317
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,043

319
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:10,997
You're not going to cost me my job.

320
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:13,187
I got a Stallone picture coming up next week.

321

331

Are you listening to me?

332

Are you listening to me?

[tires squealing]

335
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:57,433
He's gonna die.

336
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,534
He's gonna die.

337
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,098

Right.

I'm going to go with the boys, all right?

371
00:25:20,397 --> 00:25:21,232
I'll be back.

372
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:22,587
I've got to go.

373
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:23,803

Ow, my ankle.

00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:28,427
Oh!

378
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,191
Jeez!

379
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,789
We need you to sign this.

380
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,389
I'm not signing anything until I get this

381
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:34,022
checked out by a specialist.

382
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:36,038

Hey, Professor, we need your help.

398

How would you like to help us blow some people up?

399
00:26:44,892 --> 00:26:45,656
No, man.

I ain't going back to prison.

401

It's not going to happen.

402
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:51,148
I'm having too much fun on the outside, man.

403

I'm not talking about jewelry stores or banks.

404
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:54,693
This is a rescue.

My girlfriend.

406
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:58,065
She was kidnapped six months ago.

407
00:26:58,169 --> 00:26:59,976
Police have almost given up.

408
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,297
We haven't, and I won't.

409
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:08,596
Sue, is this legit?

410
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,125
Talk to me.

411
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,481
What's legit?

412
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,323
I've got a week or two off before my next gig.

413
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:14,539
I'm bored already.

414
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:16,278
Bottom line, man.

415
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:17,772
How much we talking?

416
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,931
We'll work it out.

417
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:26,078

Well, I met the posse. OK.

This is going to be interesting.

It's about 4:30.

I'm heading back to town to pick up some stuff.

429

Don't work too hard.

00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:13,834

Yeah, look, I'm tired, too.

Yeah, it went OK.

You know, it's shit like this that

really makes me hate this job.

445
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:46,333
Yeah, well, I've got something more important to worry about.

446
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:49,877
Yes, it is more important.

This is Loch, that's Lonnie.

- Hi. - Hi.

469
00:29:38,954 --> 00:29:39,823
How are you doing?

470
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:48,929
So, this is the Dirty Not-Quite-Half-a-Dozen, huh?

471
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:51,606
Oh, I bet these bad guys are going

472
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,032
to be all kinds of scared.

473
00:29:56,124 --> 00:29:57,897
- Would you guys like a beer? - Yeah, sure.

474
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:58,870
Yeah.

475
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:04,466
So, there was all this interstate brouhaha

476
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,150
bullshit between the Chicago and the LAPD.

477
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:10,896
You never saw such egos in your lives.

478
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,727
Now Bobbi's mother, lovely and totally phony Mrs. Ryland,

479
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,987
has had a complete nervous breakdown

480
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:19,515
and is basically a veg.

481
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,721
Now, Mr. Ryland, god, he is such a jerk.

482
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:26,503
He was always telling Bobbi that I was such a bad influence

483
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:28,484
on his little princess, and that she

484
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:30,187
shouldn't waste her college educated

485
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:33,037
time on a loser friend like me.

486
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:36,478
Now he says that he can't handle the pressure anymore,

487
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:38,076
and he wants Bobbi declared legally

488
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:42,039
dead that he and Mrs. Thorazine can get on with their lives.

489
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:44,923
I've got to go out for a bit, guys.

490
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:48,260
Travis, I'm going to be out of town for a couple of days,

491
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:50,103
in case you try and call, but I can

492
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:51,840
pick up messages on my machine.

493
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:55,663
So leave me a number where I can reach you, OK?

494
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,054
I really hate these business trips,

495
00:30:57,158 --> 00:31:00,633
but somebody's got to make some money, right?

496
00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:01,572
Yeah.

497
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,900
Great, thanks.

498
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:07,273
So, what do you do?

499
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:09,914
Besides take care of Travis?

500
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,547

503
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,213
The whole spiel.

504
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:19,437
Good bucks?

505
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,870
Well, the overhead is kind of high,

506
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:24,963
and sometimes you do have a hard time getting product.

507
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:28,127
But we pretty much pre-sell, so when we do get product we can

508
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:30,455
sell, we get top dollar for it.

509
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:32,888
And the best part about it is we deal

510
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,217
in cash only, so we don't have to worry

511
00:31:35,322 --> 00:31:36,815
about having to collect.

512
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,700

00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:42,098
the four of us can go out to dinner sometime.

00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:44,288
Like London or something.

515
00:31:44,392 --> 00:31:45,227
Yeah.

516
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:46,200

Good evening, sir.

522
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:30,272

523
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:32,218
It's almost morning.

00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:35,658
I didn't realize.

526
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:36,875
It's about Bobbi.

527
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,814
What?

528
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:38,961
May I come in, sir?

529
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:44,279
MRS. RYLAND: Nigel, is that the mailman?

530
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:47,233
I told him no cottage cheese!

531
00:32:47,337 --> 00:32:48,589
Didn't give him a tip.

532
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:02,909
What about Bobbi?

533
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:04,508
We're going to bring her home.

00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:05,967
What do you mean?

535
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,435
I mean, we're going to find her and bring her home.

536
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:09,234
Her body?

537
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:10,868
No, her. Whole.

538
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:11,807
Altogether.

539
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:13,058
Alive.

540
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:13,996
Who is we?

541
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:15,734
You and Wyatt?

542
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:17,229
No, sir.

543
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,723
I mean, Detective Wyatt has tried.

544
00:33:18,827 --> 00:33:20,287
You know, I mean, I think he has tried,

545
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:22,443
but I have some other people.

546
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,110
What people?

547
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:25,848
Some private detectives I know.

548
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,934
Oh, good god, Travis!

549
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:30,367

on the best private detectives money can buy,

551
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:35,093
and what did it get us?

552
00:33:35,198 --> 00:33:38,361
Zero, zilch!

553
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:42,393
I have turned my life inside out over this.

554
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:44,304
I couldn't work.

555
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:45,868
I've lost thousands and thousands

556
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:48,892
of dollars in revenue while trying to find my daughter.

557
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:51,568

00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:37,116
I reach out for you and find you're not there.

745
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,027
Baby, can't you see?

746
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:44,832
Your love lies deep inside of me.

747
00:47:44,937 --> 00:47:49,628
I need you close to me now.

748
00:47:49,732 --> 00:47:51,506

(SINGING): Baby if I could I would walk on water

752
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:45,656
I would walk on water

753

Fight battles to the end to conquer

754
00:48:52,608 --> 00:48:56,224
all and touch you again.

I need you close to me now Please try to understand.

759
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:51,973
I know we've been at this awhile, and I'm a little tired,

760
00:49:52,078 --> 00:49:54,997
but I've got to ask you one more time.

761
00:49:55,102 --> 00:49:58,404
Where were you yesterday at 4:30, Tony?

762
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:00,141
Window shopping.

763
00:50:00,246 --> 00:50:01,358
Window shopping?

764
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:03,095
Is that what you told me before?

765
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,104
Yep.

766
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:05,251
You sure?

767
00:50:05,355 --> 00:50:07,058
Yeah.

768
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:09,178
Can I have another cigarette?

769
00:50:22,038 --> 00:50:24,679
You lying sack of shit!

770
00:50:24,784 --> 00:50:26,973
You haven't got nothing on me, Wyatt.

771
00:50:27,078 --> 00:50:27,946
Nothing.

772
00:50:51,234 --> 00:50:52,068
Nothing.

773
00:50:58,811 --> 00:51:01,835
Damn it, Frank, that was real stupid.

774
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:03,469
Stupid?

775
00:51:03,572 --> 00:51:05,276
Who do you think you're dealing with?

776
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,013
Look, I'm sick discussing this.

777
00:51:07,118 --> 00:51:08,994
It's done.

778
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,289
Did you get the money?

779
00:51:11,394 --> 00:51:14,660
I mean, let's discuss something important for a moment, here.

780
00:51:14,764 --> 00:51:16,503
I know you told me not to disturb you,

781
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,415
but the O'Briens are here.

782
00:51:18,518 --> 00:51:20,047
Speaking of money.

783
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:21,125
That's quite all right, MaryAnn.

784
00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:22,585
You just send them right on in.

785
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:23,523
OK.

786
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:30,995
Mrs. O'Brien.

I have some good news for you.

793
00:51:39,615 --> 00:51:41,284
Some really wonderful news.

794
00:51:45,177 --> 00:51:46,011
Really?

795
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:24,834

No.

800
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,786
Nope.

801
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,976
What you might want to know is that we're releasing

802
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,911

803
00:52:39,015 --> 00:52:40,058

804
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:47,462
Give me a break!

805
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,130
If you didn't have your fucking nose up between his legs

00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:50,902

807
00:52:51,006 --> 00:52:52,293
Well, that's a laugh!

808
00:52:52,397 --> 00:52:54,794
You'd suck her snot if she asked you!

809
00:52:59,731 --> 00:53:01,676
Hey, I'm sorry.

810
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:04,805

00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:06,404
Excuse me, sir?

812
00:53:06,508 --> 00:53:08,941
Sir?

813
00:53:09,046 --> 00:53:11,061
Unlike the one who bred you, sir, I

814
00:53:11,165 --> 00:53:12,348
was raised with some manners.

815
00:53:15,614 --> 00:53:16,796

Shit.

You know what she said.

819
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:29,934
Leave the fucking local yokels alone.

820
00:53:30,038 --> 00:53:32,298
He ain't worth the $1.99 he makes a month.

821
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:33,652
Him and his fucking horse.

822
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:39,458
Get a car!

823
00:53:39,562 --> 00:53:40,673
Yeah, get a car!

824
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:49,155
Yo, Curt, man, you gotta clean this stuff up.

825

Hey, fuck you!

827
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,454
You remember the fucking receipt?

828

You dummy, you.

You've got to help me.

Let me go!

Probably had a good time [inaudible]

858
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,271
What the fuck is this shit?

859
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:07,869
We just want to make sure we don't miss

860
00:56:07,974 --> 00:56:10,025
any details of your confession.

861
00:56:10,129 --> 00:56:10,859
What confession?

862
00:56:10,963 --> 00:56:12,632
Who's the fuck are you guys?

863
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,169
Who the fuck are you, Tony DeLonghi?

864
00:56:15,273 --> 00:56:17,532
More importantly, who the fuck do you work for?

865
00:56:17,636 --> 00:56:18,610
Work for?

866
00:56:18,714 --> 00:56:20,208
Oh, that's a laugh.

867
00:56:20,314 --> 00:56:21,807
I've been out of work for months now.

868
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:24,901
Haven't you guys heard, there's a recession in this country.

869
00:56:31,852 --> 00:56:32,720
Who do you work for, huh?

870
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,806
Who gives you the orders?

871
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:35,814
Orders?

872
00:56:35,919 --> 00:56:38,700
I don't take orders from anybody.

873
00:56:38,804 --> 00:56:42,488
Look, dickface, I'm not in the mood for

874
00:56:42,592 --> 00:56:44,746
your stupid semantic bullshit.

875
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:48,119
Now where's the fucking girl?

876
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:49,510
Girl?

877
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:51,524
Perhaps he doesn't know, man.

878
00:56:51,629 --> 00:56:54,548
Like, perhaps we made a mistake.

879
00:56:54,653 --> 00:56:56,808
Think about it, dude.

880
00:56:56,912 --> 00:57:00,423
What are you fucking talking about?

881
00:57:00,526 --> 00:57:03,307
You know, you curse an awful lot.

882
00:57:03,412 --> 00:57:07,236
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

883
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,364
What are you fucking talking about?

884
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:13,318
Who gives a flying fuck about how much I swear?

885
00:57:13,422 --> 00:57:14,985
You don't have any idea what I've been through

886
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,028
over this ordeal, do you?

887
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,913
Hey, Travis, chill out, man.

888
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:19,921
Chill out?

889
00:57:20,025 --> 00:57:21,382
Chill out?

890
00:57:21,486 --> 00:57:22,980
Where the fuck is Bobbi?

891
00:57:23,084 --> 00:57:24,856
I don't know, man.

892
00:57:24,961 --> 00:57:28,576
Travis, I really don't think he knows.

893
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,599
Shut the fuck up!

894
00:57:31,704 --> 00:57:33,303
This is your fucking posse?

895
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,866
Hey, Travis give me a break, all right?

896
00:57:34,971 --> 00:57:36,118
When things get tough, these guys are

897
00:57:36,222 --> 00:57:37,960
going to be here for you 1000%.

898
00:57:38,065 --> 00:57:38,933
Oh, yeah?

899
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:43,520
What's this asshole going to do?

900
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:46,718
Throw his typewriter at them?

901
00:57:46,823 --> 00:57:47,691
This nutcase here.

902
00:57:47,796 --> 00:57:49,291
What's he going to do?

903
00:57:49,395 --> 00:57:51,515
Fill some rubbers up with water and pitch them off the roof?

904
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:52,940
This little wimp, this little wimp

905
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:54,817
is so worried about someone calling him a name,

906
00:57:54,922 --> 00:57:57,910
he can't even piss without shaking.

907
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,100
This is total bullshit, man I was better off

908
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:02,881
looking for Bobbi on my own.

909
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:04,514
Posse?

910
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:05,870
Pussy is more like it.

911
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:12,543
Boy, you really need to get laid.

912
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:14,281
You're gonna die.

913
00:58:14,386 --> 00:58:15,220
Maybe.

914
00:58:19,911 --> 00:58:20,815
You.

915
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,205
You're definitely going to die.

916
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:25,161
You haven't got the guts to do it.

917
00:58:25,265 --> 00:58:26,654
You couldn't kill a man.

918
00:58:32,216 --> 00:58:33,536
Where's Bobbi?

919
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,587
I don't know.

920
00:58:35,691 --> 00:58:38,611
Hey, man, why don't you get a grip!

921
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:39,618
Right now!

922
00:58:39,723 --> 00:58:41,044
Who the fuck are you?

923
00:58:41,148 --> 00:58:44,762
None of us even know who this Babette broad is.

924
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:46,709
What exactly are you paying us?

925
00:58:46,813 --> 00:58:48,413
You're paying us squat!

926
00:58:48,516 --> 00:58:52,687
Like Sue said, we might even die on this thing.

927
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:56,233
So why don't you chill out and quit being such a prick!

928
00:58:56,338 --> 00:58:57,797
Might die?

929
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,048
Might die?

930
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:02,941
Who's the one who keeps running to the phone, huh?

931
00:59:03,045 --> 00:59:05,652
Somebody tipped somebody off where we were yesterday.

932
00:59:05,756 --> 00:59:06,833
Might die?

933
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:13,820
Somebody is definitely gonna die.

934
00:59:13,924 --> 00:59:15,454
[gunshot]

935
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:38,497
Talk to me.

936
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:39,922
One. Two.

937
00:59:40,026 --> 00:59:41,383
We weren't supposed to kill you.

938
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:42,911
Talk! Talk!

939
00:59:43,016 --> 00:59:45,449
I mean, I don't think it would have cared if we did,

940
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:47,047
but that wasn't our orders.

941
00:59:47,152 --> 00:59:48,404
Your orders?

942
00:59:48,508 --> 00:59:51,774
Those orders that you don't take from anybody?

943
00:59:51,878 --> 00:59:57,648
I got a phone call, this guy I work for sometimes.

944
00:59:57,752 --> 00:59:59,421
They're mostly scare jobs, .

945
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:03,591
They just want us to go in and rough somebody up a little bit,

946
01:00:03,696 --> 01:00:08,389
shake them up, detour them, sort of scare the shit out of them.

947
01:00:08,493 --> 01:00:10,161
Who's they?

948
01:00:10,265 --> 01:00:11,447
I don't know.

949
01:00:11,551 --> 01:00:14,713
Frank just always uses we, like, we need

950
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:17,217
you to take care of something.

951
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:18,224
Frank?

952
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:22,395
Yeah, I don't know his last name.

953
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,202
Where's Bobbi?

954
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:30,146
Man, I swear, I swear, I never heard of no girl named Bobbi.

955
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,162
This guy, Frank, he's smart.

956
01:00:32,267 --> 01:00:34,699
He's not going to tell me anything.

957
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:37,862
I don't know what the hell they do out there.

958
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,148
Out where?

959
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:40,781
Out in the boonies.

960
01:00:40,885 --> 01:00:42,311
I don't know where it is.

961
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:44,362
I'm the detour man.

962
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:47,837
Anytime anybody gets within 100 miles of the place,

963
01:00:47,942 --> 01:00:51,939
I get a call to dissuade them from coming.

964
01:00:52,043 --> 01:00:53,155
So where is this place?

965
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,032
What, east, north, south, west, what?

966
01:00:55,137 --> 01:00:56,388
I don't know.

967
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:59,689
I mean it, I really don't know.

968
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:01,531
You know, I hate it when people think

969
01:01:01,635 --> 01:01:05,910
I'm dumb I really hate it.

970
01:01:06,016 --> 01:01:09,213
Kind of makes me crazy.

971
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:11,124
Crazy.

972
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:13,940
Really fucking crazy, man. You know what I mean?

973
01:01:14,044 --> 01:01:15,886
This kind of fucking crazy.

974
01:01:15,991 --> 01:01:18,389
Crazy, crazy.

975
01:01:18,493 --> 01:01:20,405
Fucking crazy, Tony.

976
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:22,837
Crazy, Tony, real fucking crazy.

977
01:01:22,942 --> 01:01:25,480
Would you like to know how fucking crazy it makes me?

978
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:26,418
See this?

979
01:01:26,522 --> 01:01:28,504
Fucking crazy, man.

980
01:01:28,607 --> 01:01:32,466
Real fucking crazy.

981
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,864
Fuck.

982
01:01:34,968 --> 01:01:36,845
You know what I mean?

983
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:37,783
Huh?

984
01:01:40,946 --> 01:01:43,066
Where is this place, Tony?

985
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:44,700
I swear to god, man, I don't know.

986
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,192
Where?

987
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:51,999
Please.

988
01:01:52,103 --> 01:01:55,196
Have you ever heard of Vinnie Van Gogh?

989
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,586
Oh, man.

990
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:57,559
Three seconds.

991
01:01:57,663 --> 01:01:58,533
Ah, man!

992
01:01:58,637 --> 01:02:00,271
One.

993
01:02:00,376 --> 01:02:01,661
Two.

994
01:02:01,766 --> 01:02:05,068
About 200, maybe 300 miles northeast of here, I think.

995
01:02:05,172 --> 01:02:06,388
I've never been there.

996
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:07,501
I don't know where it is.

997
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:13,722
I knew this guy once who worked for him.

998
01:02:13,826 --> 01:02:17,753
I think he said it was somewhere near Ravina.

999
01:02:17,857 --> 01:02:19,353
I've never seen him since.

1000
01:02:19,457 --> 01:02:23,627
I never laid eyes on this Frank guy, and I swear on my life,

1001
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:27,729
I've never seen no girl named Bobbi or otherwise.

1002
01:02:32,595 --> 01:02:33,603
Take off your clothes.

1003
01:02:36,036 --> 01:02:36,904
Let's go.

1004
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:41,979
Get up!

1005
01:02:42,084 --> 01:02:42,918
Come on!

1006
01:02:45,872 --> 01:02:46,810
Come on, Tony.

1007
01:02:46,915 --> 01:02:47,853
We haven't got all night.

1008
01:02:47,957 --> 01:02:50,529
Whoa, baby, look at that, huh?

1009
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,580
[taunting continues]

1010
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,210
Socks.

1011
01:03:11,314 --> 01:03:14,130
Nothing.

1012
01:03:14,234 --> 01:03:15,658
What do I look like?

1013
01:03:15,763 --> 01:03:18,126
Your maid?

1014
01:03:18,231 --> 01:03:20,038
Anything else you'd like to tell us?

1015
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:24,522
I swear, I don't know anything else.

1016
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:28,901
I never even knew who pays me. when I got back from a job,

1017
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,230
there'd be an envelope under the mat.

1018
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:33,698
Once I didn't get to finish a job, and there was no envelope.

1019
01:03:33,802 --> 01:03:34,671
I swear.

1020
01:03:34,775 --> 01:03:36,375
That's it.

1021
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,973
That's it.

1022
01:03:38,077 --> 01:03:38,946
Get out of here.

1023
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:39,885
Come on, let's go!

1024
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:41,101
Come on!

1025
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:42,734
Come on, come on, come on!

1026
01:03:52,814 --> 01:03:58,271
You're about 20 or 30 miles from anybody or anything.

1027
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,669
Good night, Tony DeLonghi.

1028
01:04:00,773 --> 01:04:03,241
We'll be sure to say hi to Frank for you.

1029
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:04,180
Come on!

1030
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:20,168
I really don't think he knew what was going on?

1031
01:04:20,272 --> 01:04:21,593
[laughter]

1032
01:04:21,697 --> 01:04:22,635
Fuckin' A!

1033
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,242
That was beautiful, man!

1034
01:04:25,346 --> 01:04:28,302
Touchdown!

1035
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,726
[celebrating]

1036
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:37,130
We should all win Academy Awards for that one.

1037
01:04:37,234 --> 01:04:39,561
Man, you had me going!

1038
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:41,682
When I saw you smear that stuff all over your face,

1039
01:04:41,787 --> 01:04:43,698
I thought I was going to lose it right there on the spot.

1040
01:04:43,802 --> 01:04:45,958
It's not that. What is this stuff made of?

1041
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:48,877
Good thing I remembered to put blanks in this gun.

1042
01:04:48,982 --> 01:04:49,920
All right.

1043
01:04:50,024 --> 01:04:51,380
Now the real fireworks begin.

1044
01:04:51,484 --> 01:04:52,560
Let's go.

1045
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:54,508
Oh, by the way.

1046
01:04:54,611 --> 01:04:56,905
The part about you guys not getting paid?

1047
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:59,965
We get Bobbi and you four guys split a hundred grand.

1048
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:01,598
[cheering]

1049

[dogs barking]

1050
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:24,607
What's that?

1051
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,423
A dog.

1052
01:05:27,526 --> 01:05:29,300
No shit, Sherlock.

1053
01:05:29,404 --> 01:05:30,585
Damn.

1054
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:32,635
You don't take your job serious, do you?

1055
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:33,782
What's to take?

1056
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:35,590
Except my paycheck.

1057
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:37,989
This job is cush city, man.

1058
01:05:38,093 --> 01:05:39,518
We don't have to do jack shit.

1059
01:05:39,622 --> 01:05:41,082
We don't even have to listen to the bone

1060
01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:42,959
unless we're doing bone watch.

1061
01:05:43,063 --> 01:05:44,523
Oh, yeah.

1062
01:05:44,627 --> 01:05:47,824
Sometimes we've gotta dig a hole, we got to fix things.

1063
01:05:47,929 --> 01:05:49,285
Big deal.

1064
01:05:49,389 --> 01:05:52,101
Chill out, man.

1065
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:53,559
Could be a big deal.

1066
01:05:53,664 --> 01:05:54,776
A real big deal.

1067
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,932
Do you hear something?

1068
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:57,800
A sound.

1069
01:05:57,904 --> 01:05:59,190
Do you hear an unusual sound?

1070
01:05:59,294 --> 01:06:00,337
Sorry.

1071
01:06:00,443 --> 01:06:02,354
Do you hear the fucking dog fucking barking?

1072
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,223
Yes, sir.

1073
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:04,577
The dogs aren't usually barking.

1074
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:05,968
I heard the dog barking, sir.

1075
01:06:06,072 --> 01:06:07,810
What the hell are you doing out here?

1076
01:06:07,914 --> 01:06:09,026
Never, ever leave bone watch.

1077
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:09,999
Ever!

1078
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:11,495
Get back there now!

1079
01:06:11,598 --> 01:06:13,476
Sam.

1080
01:06:13,579 --> 01:06:14,866
Sam!

1081
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,673
I hate to drag you away from Wheel of Fortune, Sam,

1082
01:06:16,777 --> 01:06:18,481
but I need you on front watch.

1083
01:06:18,584 --> 01:06:19,975
No problem.

1084
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,937
And you two worm farm rejects, get out there and walk

1085
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:25,258
the perimeter until dawn.

1086
01:06:25,362 --> 01:06:28,629
If you hear anything, see anything, shoot it.

1087
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:29,568
Kill it.

1088
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:32,488
Decimate it.

1089
01:06:32,592 --> 01:06:34,642
I guess you get what you pay for, huh, Mr. B?

1090
01:06:38,048 --> 01:06:40,100
Well, I guess I better dock your pay, eh, Goliath?

Hey?

1093
01:06:51,222 --> 01:06:51,917
What?

1094
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:53,168
Can I ask you a question?

1095
01:06:55,984 --> 01:06:57,131
What does decimate mean?

1096
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:00,675
Buy them the farm.

1097
01:07:00,779 --> 01:07:01,788
I think.

1098
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,152
Can I, can I ask you another question?

1099
01:07:04,256 --> 01:07:05,507
What, dickhead?

1100
01:07:05,611 --> 01:07:07,905
Does Frank really expect us to shoot people?

1101
01:07:08,009 --> 01:07:11,103
Do I look like an encyclopedia to you?

1102
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:14,335
They're not worried about cops and stuff?

1103
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:15,864
I guess not.

1104
01:07:15,968 --> 01:07:17,220
OK by me.

1105
01:07:21,322 --> 01:07:22,780
I got to call Deb, OK?

1106
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:24,346

01:07:39,568 --> 01:07:41,932
It was that Cousin guy again, and he had a gun.

1111
01:07:42,036 --> 01:07:43,948
Oh, god, Travis, I didn't know what to do.

1112
01:07:44,053 --> 01:07:45,095
Can you please come back?

1113
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,693
Come back as soon as you can.

1114
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:48,710
I'm so scared!

1115
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:50,934
Travis!

1116
01:07:51,038 --> 01:07:52,429
Drive!

1117
01:07:52,532 --> 01:07:53,437
Look, your sister's in trouble with your trouble, man.

1118
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:54,548
We gotta get back now.

1119
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,813
[deb screaming]

1120
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:05,498
Oh, god, you scared me so much!

1121
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:06,888
[inaudible]

1122
01:08:06,992 --> 01:08:08,174
Sis.

1123
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:08,938
It's OK.

1124
01:08:09,042 --> 01:08:10,433
We're here now.

1125
01:08:10,537 --> 01:08:11,372
What happened?

1126
01:08:11,476 --> 01:08:12,866
He-- He--

1127
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:13,909
He what?

1128
01:08:14,013 --> 01:08:14,846
Did he hurt you?

1129
01:08:14,952 --> 01:08:16,099
No, but he tried!

1130
01:08:16,203 --> 01:08:17,420
What happened?

1131
01:08:17,523 --> 01:08:20,651
I, I heard all this yelling from outside,

1132
01:08:20,756 --> 01:08:22,911
and all this pounding on the door, and it's in bad shape

1133
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,405
since he just shot it up.

1134
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:27,395
Then, then he just kept banging on the door and he said,

1135
01:08:27,499 --> 01:08:28,402
Where is your brother?

1136
01:08:28,507 --> 01:08:29,410
I know he's in there.

1137
01:08:29,514 --> 01:08:30,592
Let me in!

1138
01:08:30,696 --> 01:08:31,878
And then he ran around to the bedroom window

1139
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,199
and tried to get in.

1140
01:08:33,303 --> 01:08:37,265
So I ran and got the gun that you gave me.

1141
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:38,898
Did you call Wyatt?

1142
01:08:39,003 --> 01:08:40,394
Yeah, but he was off-duty.

1143
01:08:40,498 --> 01:08:42,513
And I don't trust any of these other assholes,

1144
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:45,016
and I don't even know the story about what happened

1145
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,588
between Reb and this guy.

1146
01:08:47,692 --> 01:08:48,979
And god, the last thing I need to do

1147
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,646
is get my brother in trouble with the law when

1148
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,490
you need him so much, Travis.

1149
01:08:52,593 --> 01:08:54,123
[crying]

1150
01:09:00,275 --> 01:09:01,838
You're OK.

1151
01:09:01,942 --> 01:09:03,125
Thanks.

1152
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:04,098
Yeah.

1153
01:09:04,202 --> 01:09:05,036
Yeah.

1154
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,149
OK.

1155
01:09:06,253 --> 01:09:07,296
God.

1156
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,693
You guys must was exhausted, huh?

1157
01:09:09,797 --> 01:09:12,405
Why don't you get some shut eye.

1158
01:09:12,509 --> 01:09:15,775
I'm, uh, I'm going to go into the office early tomorrow

1159
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,869
and then I'm going to stay with a friend.

1160
01:09:18,973 --> 01:09:20,572
I can't stay here anymore.

1161
01:09:53,765 --> 01:09:55,016
Thanks.

1162
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:58,319
You should have seen Travis and the professor tonight.

1163
01:09:58,423 --> 01:10:00,508
What a show!

1164
01:10:00,612 --> 01:10:02,281
I'll tell you about that tomorrow.

1165
01:10:02,385 --> 01:10:03,531
I'm a little tired right now.

1166
01:10:03,636 --> 01:10:04,609
Yeah.

1167
01:10:04,714 --> 01:10:06,244
I'm going to get some sleep, too.

1168
01:10:06,348 --> 01:10:07,182
Good night.

1169
01:10:22,891 --> 01:10:23,725
Oh!

1170
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:24,768
Oh.

1171
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:25,741
Travis.

1172
01:10:27,827 --> 01:10:33,180
It's kind of cramped out there.

1173
01:10:33,284 --> 01:10:36,238
If you want to crash in my room.

1174
01:10:36,343 --> 01:10:41,278
I, I've got a big bed, you know, and I don't steal the covers,

1175
01:10:41,382 --> 01:10:46,353
and I promise, I don't snore.

1176
01:10:46,457 --> 01:10:50,593
I-- I got a real live lead today.

1177
01:10:50,697 --> 01:10:54,347
I've got to do some homework.

1178
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:56,780
Appreciate the offer, Deb.

1179
01:10:56,884 --> 01:10:57,997
Thanks.

1180
01:10:58,101 --> 01:11:00,360
No, thank you for coming so quick.

1181
01:11:06,025 --> 01:11:07,553
You're my hero, you know?

1182
01:11:13,671 --> 01:11:14,748
I'm nobody's hero.

1183
01:11:28,131 --> 01:11:29,520
OK.

1184
01:11:29,624 --> 01:11:33,449
We take the 62 going east, and then we go to the 405,

1185
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:35,534
and we're going to take that south.

1186
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:37,306
Is that right, Lonnie?

1187
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:38,453
Uh, no.

1188
01:11:38,558 --> 01:11:39,948
No, it's north.

1189
01:11:40,052 --> 01:11:43,146
Because it hits at that culvert there and then you go.

1190
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,266
Hey, Professor, Is this the bay you wanted?

1191
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,212
It's got all the Tony DeLonghi shit in it.

1192
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:50,548
Yeah, I needed that I needed my notebook.

1193
01:11:50,652 --> 01:11:52,982
Cool, man. Thanks for bringing that by.

1194
01:11:53,086 --> 01:11:54,581
Yeah, no problem.

1195
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:06,675
555-0666.

This is Marion.

1199
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:14,739
May I help you please?

1200
01:12:14,843 --> 01:12:15,712
I'm sorry.

1201
01:12:15,817 --> 01:12:16,512
I have the wrong number.

1202
01:12:16,616 --> 01:12:17,903
That's just crazy, isn't it?

1203
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:18,980
It will never happen again.

1204
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,065
Sorry.

1205
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,074
Grab the phone.

1206
01:12:22,178 --> 01:12:23,117
I was asleep when Deb left.

1207
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:24,332
Call the office.

1208
01:12:24,438 --> 01:12:25,375
I need to talk to her for a minute,

1209
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,182
then we need to get out of here.

1210
01:12:27,288 --> 01:12:29,477
What's the number?

1211
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:32,396
555-0668.

1212
01:12:32,501 --> 01:12:36,601
555-0668.

1213
01:12:36,706 --> 01:12:39,244
You guys, what was the area code we were just at?

1214
01:12:39,348 --> 01:12:40,772
- Up by Ravina? - Yeah.

1215
01:12:40,877 --> 01:12:41,780
It's 805, I think.

1216

1218
01:12:44,874 --> 01:12:46,473
Jesus Christ, I dialed the wrong number.

1219
01:12:55,162 --> 01:13:00,062
555-0667.

1220
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,626
Hurry up-- [phone ringing]

1221
01:13:01,731 --> 01:13:02,634

1222
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,570
Babes in Arms Ranch.

1223
01:13:13,965 --> 01:13:15,634
Fucking good morning to you, too.

1224
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,705
You guys aren't going to believe this.

1225
01:13:24,809 --> 01:13:27,173
I know where the hell she's at.

1226
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:28,563
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1227
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:29,606
Come on!

1228
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,205
[music playing]

1229
01:13:34,645 --> 01:13:38,052
All your papers are finally in order.

1230
01:13:38,156 --> 01:13:40,763
Money has been paid in full.

1231
01:13:40,867 --> 01:13:42,883
I think it's time to make your dream come true.

1232
01:13:46,498 --> 01:13:50,112
Here she is.

1233
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,276
Here's your brand new, squeaky clean,

1234
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:56,960
healthy, blue-eyed little girl.

1235
01:13:57,064 --> 01:14:01,235
Oh, she's so beautiful.

1236
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,911
Oh, she's perfect!

1237
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:06,379
Thank you.

1238
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:09,299
Thank you.

1239
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,342
Oh, hi!

1240

[woman crying]

1241
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:20,733
Bring her back!

1242
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:24,279
Give her back!

1243
01:14:24,384 --> 01:14:25,947
I already gave you two!

1244
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:28,032
I want to keep this one!

1245
01:14:31,682 --> 01:14:32,620
Let her go!

1246
01:14:32,725 --> 01:14:34,080
Let me out of here!

1247
01:14:34,184 --> 01:14:36,410
I want to go get my baby!

1248
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:37,383
Stop!

1249
01:14:37,487 --> 01:14:38,425
You're hurting her!

1250
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:39,884
Stop it!

1251
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:41,518
You're hurting her!

1252
01:14:41,622 --> 01:14:43,187
Leave her alone!

1253
01:14:47,045 --> 01:14:51,806
I'd give you that, too, but I can't risk losing a cash crop.

1254
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:53,996
Comprende, little stupid breeding bitch?

1255
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,873
You've just about fulfilled all of your usefulness

1256
01:14:55,977 --> 01:14:57,715
you're ever gonna have.

1257
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,939
I don't think Frank can force himself

1258
01:15:00,044 --> 01:15:02,269
to ever touch you again.

1259
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:04,354
You'd better pray he can close his eyes and think

1260
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,716
of Miss January, or else you're going

1261
01:15:06,822 --> 01:15:08,837
to od'ing just like Patrice.

1262
01:15:08,942 --> 01:15:10,540
So shut the fuck up!

1263
01:15:18,882 --> 01:15:20,308
I guarantee you after that little light

1264
01:15:20,412 --> 01:15:22,080
show in the garage, there is no way we're going

1265
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,992
to be able to get in under daylight,

1266
01:15:24,096 --> 01:15:25,625
unless we go in at first light.

1267
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,570
Are you sure this is the place?

1268
01:15:27,676 --> 01:15:28,823
This is the place.

1269
01:15:28,927 --> 01:15:29,865

1273
01:15:56,212 --> 01:15:57,532
Get this place cleaned up now!

1274
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:06,499
Get up or he's going to go at you again!

1275
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:08,237
You're not pregnant yet.

1276
01:16:08,342 --> 01:16:09,175
Yet?

Excuse me can we get through here?

Nope.

1281
01:16:36,981 --> 01:16:38,962
We really need to get through here.

1282
01:16:39,067 --> 01:16:40,318
- Nope. - All right.

1283
01:16:40,422 --> 01:16:41,291
Let me out.

1284
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:46,331
Excuse me I don't think you understand.

1285

No, I don't think you understand.

Look, J.R--

1287
01:16:49,424 --> 01:16:50,502
No, you look.

01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:00,414
you would have forgotten all about Little Miss Princess

1479
01:31:00,518 --> 01:31:02,986
here.

1480
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:06,115
Then you and I, Travis--

1481
01:31:06,219 --> 01:31:09,069
She watched while Frank raped every single one

1482
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:10,876
of those girls.

1483
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:12,475
No!

1484
01:31:12,579 --> 01:31:16,472
But not Little Miss Queenie here, huh?

1485
01:31:16,575 --> 01:31:19,912
You see, Travis, that wasn't necessary.

1486
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:22,276
Because the little princess was already

1487
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:26,690
PG when we picked her up during your little play honeymoon.

1488
01:31:26,794 --> 01:31:28,949
What?

1489
01:31:29,054 --> 01:31:30,480
That's right.

1490
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:32,112
Your little darling was already pregnant

1491
01:31:32,217 --> 01:31:34,580
and was too chickenshit to tell you about it.

1492
01:31:37,152 --> 01:31:39,376
She thought she'd lose you.

1493
01:31:39,482 --> 01:31:44,277
That you wouldn't want it, Mr. Independence.

1494
01:31:44,382 --> 01:31:47,336
Bobbi told me she was going to get an abortion

1495
01:31:47,441 --> 01:31:50,915
and never tell you about it.

1496
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:53,557
Do you have any idea how beautiful that baby will be?

1497
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:54,530
Do you?

1498
01:31:57,519 --> 01:32:05,583
The child of Princess Bobbi and our handsome hero, Travis?

1499
01:32:09,962 --> 01:32:11,874
Hey, Frank!

1500
01:32:11,978 --> 01:32:14,689
Come here, Frank.

1501
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:16,427
Deb.

1502
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,547
I didn't want to believe that you'd lie to me.

1503
01:32:22,197 --> 01:32:23,726
[gunshot]

1504
01:32:29,739 --> 01:32:30,956
Wyatt?

1505
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,972
I never trusted that Firkin girl as far as I

1506
01:32:33,076 --> 01:32:34,918
could dropkick a typewriter.

1507
01:32:35,023 --> 01:32:37,837
- You followed her? - I followed you.

1508
01:32:37,942 --> 01:32:39,471
[dramatic music playing]

1509
01:32:43,051 --> 01:32:43,990
BOBBI: Oh, God!

1510
01:32:44,094 --> 01:32:57,093
[gunshots]

1511
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:59,248
- Loch? - Get the hell out of here!

1512
01:32:59,352 --> 01:33:01,715
Go!

1513
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:03,558
Loch.

1514
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:07,207
Don't call me that, man.

1515
01:33:07,312 --> 01:33:10,162
You know, you never did tell anybody how I got that name.

1516
01:33:10,266 --> 01:33:11,100
No, I swear.

1517
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:19,928
Oh, god.

1518
01:33:25,456 --> 01:33:28,444
I never told anybody, Loch.

1519
01:33:28,547 --> 01:33:30,703
That was the only secret I ever kept in my life.

1520
01:33:38,455 --> 01:33:39,983
[gunshots]

1521
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:10,742
What about the other girls?

1522
01:34:10,847 --> 01:34:12,759
Suicide got them all out.

1523
01:34:12,863 --> 01:34:15,887
And Reb?

1524
01:34:15,992 --> 01:34:19,849
Reb's going to be OK. We're going to be OK.

1525
01:34:32,988 --> 01:34:55,961
