00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,720

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,400
Train's running in 10 minutes.

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,680
That's the thing
about this messed-up disease.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,480
My mother-in-law, God rest her soul,
she was only 66.

6
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,040
Megan's 42.

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,320
lt's about time, Hog Head.

8
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,080
Car trouble. Sorry, Tom.

9
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,040
What do l care?

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,840
l got your train today.
It's all set with the boys upstairs.

11
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,600
Take some time off.
We got you covered.

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,920
l wanna work.

13
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,400
Wait up, Tom.

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,440
All right, l wanna tell you this
as a friend and not your boss, Tom.

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,280
You're not dealing with this.

16
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,480
l'm dealing with it, my way.

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,280
All right.
l'll give you all the streaks you want...

18
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,680
...but if you don't
spend time with her now...

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,160
.. .you're gonna regret it
the rest of your life.

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,800
Give him his orders.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
See you, Tom.

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
How long do l have?

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,400
l can't answer that.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
Well, give me your best bet.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,040
l won't hold you to it.

26
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,200
-Are you all right, Megan?
-Oh, yeah. l'm fine.

27
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,600
Hey, what's the date today?

28
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,480
Tuesday, February 2nd.

29
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,040
Tom, do you really think
you should be driving?

30
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,200
Don't you start with me too.

31
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,000
This is Stargazer Express.
We are setting up and running.

32
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,480
Wanda, your favorite train is leaving.

33

About time. Stargazer Express.

34
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,560
Come on, baby. Don't give us
a hard time over five little minutes.

35
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,200
Because you know you want me.

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,840
Like l want hemorrhoids.
Over and out. Romeo.

37
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,600
Over and out.

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,880
-Romeo, huh?
-Yes, sir.

39
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,120
Love on a train.
Man, there ain't nothing like it.

40
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,600
So. what do think about trains now?

41
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,680

So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,520
Why, hello, Davey.

49
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,000
How's your poor mother, bless her,
on this lovely Tuesday morning?

50
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,160
-She's okay.
-Up and around, is she?

51
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,560
Not yet. But soon.

52
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,680
You sure?
Better tell her to watch her step then...

53
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,040
-...all that drinking.
-Okay, later, Mrs. Brown.

54
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Breakfast is ready, Mom.

55
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,360
Did you say your morning prayers?

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
Eat your eggs before they get cold.

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,200
No, sweetie, l don't want it.

58
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Mom, you have to eat something.

59
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,600
Kneel, Davey.

60
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,440
l said my prayers.

61
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,120
Well, say them again, sweetie.

62
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,760
O God, come to my aid.

63
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,280
l can't hear you, sweetie.

64
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,200
O Lord, make haste to help me.

65
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,440
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit.

66
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,600
Hallelujah.

67
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,040
You know, it's after 10.

68
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,720
You slept so hard,
l didn't wanna wake you.

69
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,920
l feel stronger.

70
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:30,800
l knew it. l told you you'd feel better.

71
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,200
How long before the train gets here,
sweetie?

72
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,320
Thirty minutes.

73
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,840
We're gonna see the train?

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Yeah, Davey.

75
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,240
You mean it?

76
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,760
We don't have to,
if you're not feeling well.

77
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,480
l'm fine, baby.

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,560
Here, that's two for you...

79
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,280
...and three for me.

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,360
-What for?
-To make us happy, baby.

81
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
To make us happy.

82
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,000
Honey, can you get the phone,
please?

83
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,960

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Hello?

85
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,840
Hi. this is the principal

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,760
l'm calling because Davey
hasn't been in school.

87
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,160
Well, you see, his mother died.

88
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,440
Oh. l'm very sorry.
We weren't aware of that.

94
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,520
l'm telling you, Tom, if you were smart,
you'd be going too.

95
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,080
Trains, l mean, l love it, man,
but it's a dying business.

96
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,400
Mom.

97
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,560
Are you okay?

98
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,040
Yeah, l'm fine.

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,920
We'll wait, Davey.

100
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,640
-We'll wait until it comes, and then--
-Did you know the Stargazer Express...

101
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,520
...goes all the way to Seattle?

102
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,720
l love you, baby.

103
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,960
-Cold today.

Good morning, passengers.

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,520
We are approaching

106
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,920
...right on time.

107
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,040
O God, you are my God.

108
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,960
l wait for you from the dawn.

109
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,480
There's two engineers
on each passenger train.

110
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,440
My body longs for you.

111
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Pray with me, baby.

112
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,920
-But l already prayed.
-Pray with me, Davey.

113
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,000
My lips will praise you...

114
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,800
...for your mercy is better
than life itself.

115
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,520
lt's here.

116
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,560
Wait, Mom, don't go, it's coming.

117
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,160
Mom, what are you doing?

118
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,840
Mom!

119
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,880

120
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,760
-Mom. Mom, wake up.
-Be brave, honey.

-Mom, wake up! What are you doing?
-lt's okay.

124
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,200
-Object on the tracks.
-What?

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
Objects on tracks. Call it in.

126
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,240
-Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
-Call it in!

127
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,880
All right, l'm slowing down.

128
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,280
This is Stargazer Express,
approaching Highway 6.

129
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,960
We have an object on tracks.
repeat, object on tracks.

130
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,320
Sixty-eight miles an hour.

131
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,560
Mom!

132
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
Mom!

133
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,720

134
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, my God.

135
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,080
-What's the speed?
-Fifty-five miles an hour.

136
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,840
Still too fast, man. We're still too fast.

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
-We gotta stop this train, man.
-No!

138
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,360
No, no, no!
You're not stopping the goddamn train!

139
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,400
What are you talking about?
We gotta try!

140
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,520
We can't.
We got too many cars on the turn.

141
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,760
-We have to take the chance!
-Hands off! We're following procedure!

142
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,560
-Screw procedure, Tom!
-There's nothing we can do about it now!

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,280
There is nothing we can do!

144
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,400
Help! Someone help me!

145
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,200
What are you doing?

146
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,640
Mom! Mom! Get out!

147
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,000
Fifty miles per hour.

148
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,320
-Oh, my God.
-Forty-eight.

149
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,280
-All right, brace for impact.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

150
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,640
Mom!

151
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,960
Perfect.

152
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,640
Thanks.

153
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,160
May l?

154
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,840
The railroad.

155
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,720
Are you a trainman?

156
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
You ever been on one?

157
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,480
l don't know
if l should kiss you or slap you.

158
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,760
Repeat after me: l.

159
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,880
-l.
-Would like.

160
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,520
Would like.

161
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,120
To take you out sometime.

162
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,800
To take you out sometime.
You'd go out with me?

163
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,680
Well, now that you've asked me
so nicely, why not?

164
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,320
Hey, Megan.

165
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,200
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

166
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,760
-What's going on?
-Okay.

167
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,640
-Jesus.
-l'm... .

168
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,080
l'm planting flowers.

169
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,040
Well, not in your condition.
You can't do this kind of work.

170
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Where's Tom? Oh, jeez. Hold on.

171
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,440
Okay, thanks.

172
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,920
l thought he was keeping
an eye on you.

173
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
Sometimes l think he can't stand
to be around me.

174
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,680
Here.
Just in case you change your mind.

175
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

176
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,640
The piano?

177
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,520
-l ordered it.
-You're kidding me.

178
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,240
Oh, Megan.

179
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,720
l'm gonna learn how to play.
l've always wanted to learn.

180
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,960
Megan, you have to rest.

181
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,320
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage. rage. rage

182
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
Against the dying of the light.

183
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,760
ls that what you're doing? Raging?

184
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,320
lt's a poem.
It's a Dylan Thomas poem.

185
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,240
-Do you want me to get that?
-Yeah. Thanks.

186
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,840
Stark residence.

187
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,400
No, no. It's not.
Who should l say is calling?

188
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Oh, is he all right?

189
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,320
Yes.

190
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,760
Yes. Thank you.

191
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,800
Tom had an accident.

192
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,080
Give your specimen samples
to this officer.

193
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,280
Cheers. Let me know if l'm pregnant.

194
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,800
Visual clearance coming
off the corner was 300 feet.

195
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,000
lf you do the math, the posted was 60,
figure it was between 50 and 45, but....

196
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,160
lt was a suicide.

197
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,240
No doubt about it.
We did everything by the book.

198
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,760
-The box will tell you that.
-We know you did, Tom.

199
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,960
lt's just a complicated situation.

200
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,280
lt's a suicide. It's not complicated.

201
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,840
Not when there's a woman
and a young child involved.

202
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,640
We're bringing you on the carpet.

203
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,320
Some whack-job
drives a car in front of my train.. .

204
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,360
-...and it's my fault?
-We don't have a choice on this one.

205
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,400
No one remembers Victor Lopez,
but everybody knows Susan Smith.

206
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,240
-What the hell's that supposed to mean?
-Victor Lopez.

207
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,120
lt's the homeless man
who dove under my train in Oxnard.

208
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,760
Tom, nobody cares if some wacko
throws himself under a train...

209
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,640
.. .but everybody feels
for a mother and her child.

210
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,800
Wait, Tom, look.
Look, l'll talk to him. Hold up, Tom.

211
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,840
Hey, it's a week, 10 days max,
you know?

212
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Take time off. Give us a chance...

213
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,360
-...to prove you did everything right.
-You know we did.

214
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,760
You know this is a formality, Tom.

215
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560
We gotta do this.

216
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,080
l'm sorry, excuse me.
This way, this way. Excuse me.

217
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,760
You didn't stop.

218
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,840
You didn't stop.

219
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,520
Hi. Are you okay?

220
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,680
-Yeah, l'm all right.
-What happened?

221
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,760
Taking some time off.

222
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,920
-They're making you?
-You saw the doctor?

223
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,000
-Susan brought some soup over.
-Not hungry.

224
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,720
You have to do chemo again?

225
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,520
You know, this room, the kitchen?

226
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,480
lt's my favorite room
in the whole house.

227
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,560
The only room we fully unpacked.

228
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,640
Yeah. What did the doctor say, Meg?
What are the options?

229
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,680
We don't have any options.

230
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,520
l have days, weeks, maybe months.

231
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,120
The cancer has metastasized
to my bones.

232
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,320
So we'll treat it again.
It's gonna be hard, but--

233
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,960
lt's over.

234
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,400
What are you talking about?
No, no, no. We gotta fight this. We--

235
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,800
l'm done fighting, Tom.

236
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,200
The chemo made me sick,
and the cancer's too advanced.

237
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,160
l don't wanna spend the rest of my life
in a hospital room...

238
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,560
...full of tubes and syringes
and oncologists.

239
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,760
-Come on, there's gotta be something.
-There's nothing.

240
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,680
We have to. We gotta try.
l mean, we gotta try to....

241
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,200
Gotta try to find a way to deal,
you know, with--

242
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,920
Death.

243
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,200
Say it.

244
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,760
You know what, this is only for tonight.
Tomorrow, we'll find you a good home.

245
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,240
Okay? You don't feel tired?

246
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,800
You need to get a little bit of sleep
if you can.

247
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,640
Good night, David.

248
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,120
Okay.

249
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, maybe now that you have
some time off...

250
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,920
...maybe we can go to San Francisco.

251
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,040
There's gonna be a hearing.
l have to be around to find out when.

252
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,200
Great.

253
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,760
An official excuse.

254
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,400
No, it's not an excuse.

255
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,480
lf l'm absent at the hearing,
l'll lose my job.

256
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
You're like sand, Tom.

257
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,960
Harder l try to hold onto you,
the faster you slip through my fingers.

258
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,920
Okay.

259
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
lt's okay.

260
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,960
No.

261
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,000
Out.

262
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
Meggie?

263
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,200
Tom thinks that we can help you.

264
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,720
He was very convincing
over the phone.

265
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,680
Well, we're a center
for alternative approaches...

266
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,000
...to treat or ameliorate disease.

267
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,920
We offer applied kinesiology,
cupping, even electromagnetic therapy.

268
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,640
Can you cure me?

269
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,280
As a professional in the medical field,
you know that there are no guarantees.

270
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,760
However, we can try
to rejuvenate your system...

271
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,600
...teach you a number
of relaxation techniques...

272
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,120
...such as meditation,
deep breathing, self-hypnosis.

273
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,800
All of these will help you relax.

274
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,320
l don't wanna relax.

275
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,200
-l wanna live.
-Honey....

276
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,320
Why don't we just
hear what she has to say.

277
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,000
lt's all right, Tom.
Of course you wanna live, Megan.

278
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,880
And l would like to spend
what little is left of my life...

279
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,760
...doing exactly what l want to do...

280
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,480
...which does not include
electromagnetic therapy.

281
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,880
Okay. Thank you.

282
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,160
-You're not even listening to me.
-What do you want?

283
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,720
-What would you like me to do?
-What happened to us?

284
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,840
-What are you talking about?
-You heard me.

285
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,680
-Meggie, come on.
-Don't ''Meggie'' me.

286
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,000
-l'm not some fragile thing.
-What do you want?

287
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,760
l wanna know why
we never had children. How about that?

288
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,320
l don't know, because we never found
the time. We never found the time.

289
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,560
How could we have time?

290
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,280
We moved in 10 different houses
in 1 5 years of marriage.

291
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
l'm a trainman.
That's what trainmen do.

292
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,960
That is not what trainmen do,
that's what you did.

293
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,720
That's not what trainmen do.
It's not the rules for trainmen.

294
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,080
How could anybody, anybody,
have a child like that?

295
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,160
You got sick.

296
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,560
You're blaming me?

297
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,880
No, l'm not blaming anyone.

298
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,760
lt was just the way things worked out.

299
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,720
l thought l had all this time...

300
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,000
...to be a woman.

301
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,920
To be a wife...

302
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,120
...and a nurse, and a mother.

303
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,800
Then l found out l didn't. l just didn't.

304
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,960
l don't have any time.

305
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,160
l probably would have made
a lousy father, anyway.

306
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,800
l'm not afraid to die.

307
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,520
But to think that l haven't lived?

308
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,240
That terrifies me.

309
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:15,560
Thank you so much
for agreeing to do this so quickly.

310
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,640
You will be gentle with him,
though, Judy?

311
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,920
l think he suffers from PTSD.

312
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,160
These kids don't need pity.

313
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,400
They require structure and discipline.
That's my gift to them.

314
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,880
-Right, it's just that his mother was--
-Now, stop. You already told me.

315
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,320
Separate yourself from your job, Renee.
They're not your children.

316
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,080
Of course. You're right.

317
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,120
Thanks.

318
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,280
lt's a nice room, huh?

319
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,360
Well, it's a little pink, but at least
you have it all to yourself, right?

320
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,440
lt's definitely better
than temporary boarding.

321
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,840
l don't wanna stay here.

322
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
This is gonna be a great place for you,
David.

323
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,160
Please don't make me stay.

324
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,320
-You're gonna be safe.
-Please.

325
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,400
Honey, you'll be safe,
and l think you'll really like Judy.

326
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,520
You let her know if you need anything,
and she'll get in touch with me, all right?

327
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,640
Bye.

328
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,880
Used to be my girl's room.

329
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,840
We asked for a girl...

330
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,440
...but you were an emergency.

331
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,160
You want some clean clothes?

332
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,720
This'll have to do for now.

333
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,160
We'll talk later.

334
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,960
And it cleans for months.
Never scrub your toilet again.

335
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,960
Authorities have just revealed
the identity of the woman.. .

336
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:26,720
...that was killed in the Simi Valley
train crash as 27-year-old Laura Danner.

337
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,440
The police say that her 1 1-year-old son.
David Danner.. .

338
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,200
...had been with her in the car...

339
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,960
.. .but he somehow managed
to escape the accident unharmed.

340
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,120
l'm told that the senior engineer
who was driving that train. Tom Stark.. .

341
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,960
.. .and his partner. Otis Higgs.
have been suspended pending--

342
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,520
Kitchen is off-limits
between mealtimes.

343
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,680
TV privileges are permission only.
Understood?

344
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,680
-Yes.
-''Yes, ma'am. ''

345
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:53,480
As long as you live here,
you'll play by my rules.

346
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,120
Listen to your own rules.

347
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,760
Go to your room.

348
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,480
You're the one
who should stay out of the kitchen.

349
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,520
You're bad.
l knew it the moment l saw you.

350
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,080
Get to your room. Now.

351
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,600
Go.

352
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,760
Get dressed and go to sleep.

353
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,520
Hello?

354
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,000
Hello? Anybody here?

355
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,080
l fancy they're long gone.

356
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,200
The officers.
They collected their evidence and left.

357
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,320
You knew them?

358
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,720
Laura and Davey? l suppose so.

359
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,480
You look a bit pale, dearie.

360
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,880
-l do feel a little....
-Come on. Let me get you a cup of tea.

361
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,640
Tom? Where are you?

362
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,440
l'm out in the garage.

363
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,160
Hey, man, l'm sorry to disturb you
at the house, but....

364
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,840
l had no idea you were
into model trains. This is nice.

365
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,160
Hey, man, you mind
if we go get a beer or something?

366
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,800
Yeah, sure.

367
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,080
Let me get my coat.

368
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,080
We'll let it brew a while.

369
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,400
-You're very kind.
-Now.. .

370
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,920
...l've lived in this building five years.

371
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,440
Now, Laura and l,
we were never bosom buddies...

372
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,240
...but you don't live
that long next door to someone...

373
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800
...without getting to know
them on an intimate level.

374
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,160
So did she ever mention suicide
to you?

375
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,760
Oh, you are a nosy one.

376
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,560
Poking and snooping.

377
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
Now, how did you find us?
Who sent you?

378
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,840
-lt's listed in....
-Well, dear, dear, dear.

379
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,200
-Call information if you don't believe me.
-Trying times indeed, huh?

380
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,800
Oh, cookies!

381
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,680
No, thank you.

382
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,960
Really.

383
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,640
So you were saying, about Laura.

384
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,280
Oh, yeah. Bless her.

385
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,080
l looked after the boy
here and there, you know.

386
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,640
Couldn't help but notice the men
coming and going from her apartment.

387
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,640
l mean,
haven't been anybody for ages.

388
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:30,200
But they used to flock
around her like hungry birds.

389
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,960
But they stopped coming?

390
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, she had a breakdown.

391
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,800
Nerves disease.

392
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,880
Monstrous, really,
the tricks our mind plays on us.

393
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,440
Well, l used to drop by, do chores.

394
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,800
Cook for the boy.

395
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,280
But frankly,
she needed professional help.

396
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,040
Tea?

397
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,240
So she gave up.

398
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,920
ls that why you think she did it?

399
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,760
l really don't know.

400
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,120
-Have you thought about it?
-About what?

401
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,120
The accident.

402
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,600
l'm just....

403
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,000
l'm having a little bit
of a hard time with it.

404
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Yeah, l-- l don't wanna talk about it.

405
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,880
Look, l'm-- l'm gonna talk to N.B.

406
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,000
l'm gonna give him my notice.

407
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,280
No, you-- You can't do that. That makes
it look like we did something wrong.

408
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,680
-That's because we did.
-We didn't have a choice.

409
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,040
-We didn't?
-No.

410
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,880
lf we'd used that emergency brake...

411
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,520
.. .wheels could've flattened,
train could've derailed.

412
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
-We'll never know--
-We're not gonna know.. .

413
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,840
...but-- But it was a judgment call,
and l-- l made it.

414
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,680
We killed a human being.

415
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,440
A person, Tom. l don't know...

416
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,440
...how l can....

417
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,520
lt was a suicide.

418
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,440
Suicide.

419
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:01,360
You know, the homeless man
was my first one? Victor Lopez?

420
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,280
Come on, come on.
Can we talk about something else?

421
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,360
lt was right before
the end of the run and....

422
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,800
l mean, we had a smooth ride
going for like 10 hours.

423
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,760
And then l see him. l mean, he's
standing on the tracks, clear as day.

424
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,400
And l'm blowing the horn. l'm--

425
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,120
l'm ringing the bell.
l mean, l'm doing everything.

426
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,720
He just ignored us.

427
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,840
They turn us into executioners.

428
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
You know what he did
right before we hit him?

429
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,440
He smiled at us.

430
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,760
He had a death wish, you know?

431
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,480
Some people do.

432
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,880
Other people don't wanna die,
they die anyway.

433
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,920
l'm gonna wait
till the hearing's done...

434
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,920
...but l'm giving my notice.

435
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,480
Yeah, fine. Go ahead, do that.

436
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,000
-Come on, man. Don't be an asshole.
-Because l got no time for a quitter.

437
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,920
You know what your problem is?

438
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,720
Everything is dying around you and you
just can't deal with it, can you?

439
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,320
Hey! Hey, get out!

440
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,040
Get out! Now! Let's go!

441
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,760
Get out!

442
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,840
Talk about my wife again, l'll kill you.

443
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,600
You know what? Fuck you, Tom!
At least l'm alive.

444
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:29,160
You're dead inside
and everybody knows it!

445
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,040
What are you doing?

446
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,680
l'm leaving for San Francisco,
tomorrow, alone.

447
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,920
No, just wait...

448
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,520
...wait until after the hearing
and l'll come with you.

449
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,080
No, you won't.

450
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,440
You'll-- You'll sign up
for more train trips.

451
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,360
Come on, Meg,
Iet me make it up to you.

452
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,960
What for?

453
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,280
A final goodbye?

454
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,640
Good night.

455
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,960
-Are you the conductor?
-Yes.

456
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,360
l'm looking for my Uncle Tom.

457
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,160
Yeah, l've seen him in this cab.
This is his train.

458
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,520
You mean Tom Stark?
l didn't know he had relatives.

459
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,840
Yeah. He has a sister.

460
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Sorry, kid, but Tom's not on duty today.
He's off because of the accident.

461
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,760
Well, actually, l don't think
l have the right address.

462
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,960
You want me to check his address?

463
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,040
Could you hurry?
My mom's waiting in the car.

464
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,680
You're bossy.

465
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,040
You're just like your uncle.

466
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,960
l'll just wait right here.

467
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,640
Are you ready to say you're sorry?

468
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,000
What happened?

469
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,880
Don't go.

470
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,200
l have to.

471
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,600
What's gonna happen if you get worse?
l mean...

472
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,320
.. .who's--?
Who's gonna take care of you there?

473
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,760
l'll figure it out.

474
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,240
Please don't go.

475
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,040
Please. l'm sorry.

476
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,240
Please.

477
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,520
Okay, l'll notify the police, Judy.

478
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,960
Thanks.

479
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,920
Crap.

480
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,240
l can't do this.

481
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,680
lt's too late, Tom. Come on.

482
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,080
-You didn't stop!
-Hey!

483
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,600
-Hey!
-What?

484
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,000
-What are you doing? Hey!
-Stop! All right, stop.

485
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,680
Get off me, kid.

486
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,480
He killed my mom!

487
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,000
Tom! Don't hurt him!

488
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,400
-What are you, nuts?
-Stop!

489
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,720
l didn't kill your mother,
she killed herself!

490
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,760
-Will you stop it!
-No, she didn't!

491
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,040
How fast were you going?
Sixty? Seventy?

492
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,000
-l was going 48.
-You didn't even try to stop!

493
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,680
l don't owe you an explanation!

494
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,520
-Hey, Tom, stop it. Sweetie.
-Yes, you do!

495
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,600
-Stop it!
-You could've stopped! You didn't try!

496
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
-You didn't even try!
-Listen, come on.

497
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,080
Okay, come on.

498
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:20,000
-He killed my mother.
-Your mother killed herself.

499
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,560
Come sit down. Let's have some water.
Come on.

500
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
-lt doesn't say.
-Yes, it does.

501
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,720
Show him where.

502
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,120
Page 55, code 343.

503
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,240
See, the-- All the rules
are sort of listed in....

504
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:43,880
lmagine a train
and it's g-- It's going very fast.

505
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,000
-lt's on the track and there's passen--
-Over 45 miles per hour.

506
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,880
The engineer's gonna use the
emergency brake on the turn...

507
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:53,520
-.. .hundreds of passengers onboard--
-A chance that the train could derail.

508
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:55,840
-That's what it says.
-Right. That's right.

509
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,160
-Well, it's not for sure.
-lt's a chance l couldn't take.

510
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,280
Okay, let me clean this hand up.

511
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,160
Here, all right,
it's just gonna hurt for a second.

512
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,320
There we go. Okay, push down.

513
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,440
What's your name, David or Davey?
What do you...?

514
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,840
Davey.

515
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,320
How'd you find me?

516
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,520
-l went on the train.
-What train?

517
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,560
And who's watching you now?

518
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,160
No one.

519
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,560
No family?

520
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,680
They put me in a foster home.

521
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,920
We gotta call the police.

522
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,040
lf they're not here already.

523
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,760
Okay, here, just hold that like that.

524
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,640
lt's gonna be okay. Don't worry.

525
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,760
No, just push it down.

526
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,600
Okay.

527
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,480
Don't go anywhere.

528
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,160
ls this the Stark residence?

529
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Yeah.

530
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,480
Megan Stark?

531
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,880
-Yes.
-We have your piano.

532
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,400
My piano?

533
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,200
My piano.

534
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,520
Where do you want it?

535
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,560
-lnside.
-Okay.

536
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,840
-What piano?
-l... .

537
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,160
My piano. l ordered it last week.

538
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,240
Hey.

539
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,320
What are we gonna do?

540
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,040
-We gotta get him out of here.
-No.

541
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,440
-Let him stay.
-Why? What are you talking about?

542
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,040
Just for one day.

543
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,000
No. l can't have contact
with the victim's family.

544
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,000
-l could lose my job.
-Please, Tom.

545
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,680
Did you see his face?
Did you see his--? His clothes?

546
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,280
He just lost his mother.

547
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,960
Somebody could be looking for him.

548
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,720
lf he leaves, l'm leaving with him.

549
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,040
Do you want some more?

550
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:01,120
No, thanks.

551
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,560
What are you doing?

552
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,520
-l'm washing my dishes.
-No, no, l'll do it.

553
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,520
No, really, l don't mind.

554
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,440
lt's okay.

555
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,120
You-- You go on
and make yourself at home.

556
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,400
Do you play?

557
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,320
No.

558
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,920
Oh, come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

559
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,440
Right back this way is the restroom.

560
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,560
How you doing?

561
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,120
Good, ma'am.

562
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,320
You can call me Megan.

563
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:29,520
l'm just gonna leave some clean
clothes here by the door, okay?

564
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,960
Okay.

565
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:42,960
Where is he?

566
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,360
Taking a bath.

567
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,840
He's so polite.

568
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,760
He's a strange kid.

569
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
He's too grown-up.

570
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,480
You should have seen
how he was raised.

571
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,080
What do you mean?

572
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:02,800
Don't get mad.

573
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,360
-l went to his house.
-Whose house?

574
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,600
David. Dav-- David and
Laura's house in Simi Valley.

575
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,280
Why, why, why would you do that?

576
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,680
l went because l saw them
talking about her on the news.

577
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,200
-l had to know.
-You had to know? Had to know what?

578
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,880
There's nothing to know.
She put her car on the tracks.

579
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:22,240
She was young, Tom.

580
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,960
She has a child.

581
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,000
l mean, why would anybody...?

582
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:31,840
lt was important to me.

583
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,080
lt was horrible,
the way they lived in their house.

584
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,840
lt was just....

585
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,080
lt was horrible.

586
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,240
Judy Neasy has been a
foster parent for many years.

587
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,000
She has an excellent reputation
with us.

588
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,600
She is a disciplinarian, but l got him
on such short notice, l thought that...

589
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,640
...after living with a mentally
ill mother, l thought maybe...

590
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,680
-...discipline might be good for him.
-l'm sure you meant well.

591
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,400
-Do you have a picture?
-Yes, l do. Here you go.

592
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,840
We'll circulate it to our patrol units.

593
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,680
You will find him, won't you?

594
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,520
Gonna try this thing out?

595
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,840
No, he's sleeping.
l don't wanna wake him.

596
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,440
He won't wake up.

597
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:03,320
l'm glad that you didn't....

598
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,440
l know.

599
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,680
l wish we could keep him.

600
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,560
You promised one day.

601
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,280
He needs us.

602
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:54,760
We could get in a lot of trouble.

603
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,840
lt's against the law, and besides,
that's like kidnapping.

604
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,600
-So?
-So.. .

605
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,120
...if they find out
that he was even here for one day...

606
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,880
...they're not gonna reinstate me.

607
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,280
l'm asking you to do this for me.

608
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,200
lf l don't work the rails, l'm nothing.

609
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,160
You're my husband.

610
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,240
l slept for almost a whole day.

611
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:39,800
l was so tired
and l didn't even know it.

612
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,280
Where's Tom?

613
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,600
He's out working on his model railroad.

614
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
He has a railroad?

615
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:54,800
lt's out in the garage.
You can see it when you're all done.

616
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,520
l'm done!

617
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,800
This is really cool.

618
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,960
Why is it broken?

619
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:16,400
Well, l'll fix it in no time.

620
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,680
Gosh. All these stations and people.

621
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,520
lt's so real.

622
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,600
Well, l've been at it for a while.

623
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:34,960
You ready?

624
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,240
Come on, kid.

625
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,640
Hey, Davey, here's our number.

626
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,160
And if you need anything,
anything at all, you just call me, okay?

627
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,600
l don't wanna go back there.

628
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,240
l know. But you can't stay here.
They won't let you.

629
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,520
Because of the accident?

630
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,200
Yes.

631
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,000
Meg.

632
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:43,120
Hey, tuck your head down.

633
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:49,400
What are you afraid of?

634
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,760
Nothing.

635
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,520
l just-- l don't want
anyone to see you, is all.

636
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,240
Thank you. Thank you.

637
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,080
Thank you.

638
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,760
Okay.

639
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,800
Okay.

640
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,680
When did you start driving trains?

641
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:52,160
Running trains.

642
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,760
How old were you?

643
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,680
l don't know, l was about 30.

644
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,200
Passenger trains?

645
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,680
Freight first.

646
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,520
Well, l'll be 1 2 in August.

647
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,680
-Hope you like chicken.
-Yeah, l love it.

648
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,880
My mom used to make it a lot.

649
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,360
Aren't you gonna say grace?

650
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:33,520
We don't do that here.

651
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,520
Tom.

652
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:39,120
Dear Jesus,
l wanna thank you for the meal.. .

653
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,200
...that we're going to receive and--

654
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,680
Excuse me.

655
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:46,160
Davey.. .

656
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,280
...don't worry.

657
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,560
Thanks.

658
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,320
He didn't mean to.

659
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,640
-l'm going out for a little bit.
-Where you going?

660
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,400
l'm gonna go get him some clothes.

661
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:18,080
-He can't keep wearing your T-shirts.
-Well, let me go.

662
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,920
l mean, you've been going nonstop.
No, let me go. Yeah.

663
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:22,760
Are you sure?

664
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,360
Yeah, wh--? Wh--?
What should l get?

665
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,680
l made a list.

666
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,560
-Boy's jeans.
-Yeah.

667
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,160
Don't know what size.

668
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,680
Socks, a toothbrush, definitely.

669
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,040
-l'm not sure if you think--
-Okay, get whatever's on here, right?

670
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:45,640
Yeah.

671
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:50,080
What the hell are we doing?

672
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:55,080
l don't know. l don't know,
but it feels good.

673
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,760
l feel better than l have in a long time.

674
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,960
Wanna help?

675
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,960
Yeah.

676
00:53:56,519 --> 00:53:57,520
Okay.

677
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,840
Figure out where your passengers might
want some shade, put these trees there.

678
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,720
-Okay.
-All right?

679
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,800
So, what do you call your railroad?

680
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,640
l call it the Stark Special.

681
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,920
That's a nice name for a railroad.

682
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,920
Yeah, l like to think so.

683
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,160
l like that engine you got there.

684
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,040
My mom gave it to me.

685
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,320
She was a lot like Megan.
She cooked a lot and cleaned.

686
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,120
And she'd help me with my homework.

687
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,600
Yeah, l'm sure she was
Mother of the Year.

688
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,440
Shit.

689
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,720
You know what?
All that won't be necessary.

690
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,640
l just want you to teach me
one really beautiful song.

691
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,760
That's perfect. What's it called?

692
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:37,520
''A Maiden's Prayer. ''

693
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:39,800
''A Maiden's Prayer''?

694
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,600
lt's pretty. Okay. Now....

695
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,680
Okay, just place this finger here.

696
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,520
-Like so.
-Okay.

697
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:57,720
You've really never seen one?

698
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,600
They don't have them in Simi Valley.

699
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
Well, they're big and blue and wet.

700
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,560
You're such a poet.

701
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,040
How you doing? You all right?

702
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,160
Thank you.

703
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,360
Maybe l should dance with Davey.

704
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,720
Come on, man.
Don't keep a lady waiting.

705
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,320
Thank you.

706
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,760
Davey?

707
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,920
Davey? Are you okay?

708
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,840
What's going on?

709
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,360
Can l get you something?

710
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,240
Do you wanna talk about it?

711
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,120
Was it a bad dream?

712
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,840
l was pretending.

713
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:21,120
Pretending what?

714
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,760
That you were my mother,
and that we were a family.

715
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:34,880
l told Tom that my mom cooked,
and helped me with homework.

716
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:39,000
She didn't.

717
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,680
Not for a long time.

718
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,360
She did the best for you
that she could.

719
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,120
She tried really hard.

720
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,920
l know she did.

721
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,640
Here.

722
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,320
You go to sleep, okay?
Let's get you back in bed.

723
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:24,640
Davey?

724
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,520
Do you want me to sit with you
for a few minutes?

725
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,160
Okay.

726
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:01,680
Morning.

727
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,360
Oh, my God. l fell asleep.

728
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,440
Want tea?

729
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:17,160
Thank you.

730
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,200
So how long have you had
that engine?

731
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,600
My mom said my dad left it for me.

732
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,640
He wanted me to have it
when l turned 6.

733
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:02,800
l guess he liked trains.

734
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,280
Did your dad like trains?

735
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,120
Never knew him.

736
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,920
l didn't know mine either.

737
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,520
lt's a bird.

738
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:24,240
Cool.

739
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,160
Good.

740
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,200
-Sexy stuff, huh?
-That is irresistible.

741
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,480
-That's for you.
-Do that again.

742
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,360
You only get it once.

743
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,080
Thank you.

744
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,640
Oh, my gosh.

745
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,280
My gosh.

746
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,640
Tom.

747
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,040
We can't afford that. That's beautiful.

748
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:19,960
Repeat after me.

749
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:23,280
Happy.

750
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:29,200
-Happy.
-Valentine's day.

751
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,800
Valentine's Day.

752
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,440
Oh, my, so much time has passed.

753
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,840
Do you know something?

754
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:59,120
l remember certain moments
with such clarity.. .

755
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,120
...like it was just yesterday.

756
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:13,360
Let me do that.

757
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,600
That's perfect.

758
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:23,760
Remember the first time
you spoke to me?

759
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,680
l remember.

760
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,880
-Our first train ride.
-And our second.

761
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,200
Good night. Sweet dreams.

762
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,840
''He fought by instinct,
but he could also fight with his mind.''

763
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,960
What's instinct?

764
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:50,600
lt's a feeling that you get
in your stomach...

765
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,360
...that tells you
if something is right or wrong.

766
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,120
''He rushed as if trying a shoulder trick
that had failed before.

767
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,040
I I
But at the last moment....

768
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:05,760
What is it?

769
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,480
The hearing's in five days.

770
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:17,360
ln five days what?

771
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:19,480
lt's the official hearing.

772
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:23,640
lt's when they'll decide
whether Tom did the right thing...

773
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,840
...in the accident.

774
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:30,000
What if they decide
he didn't do the right thing?

775
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:32,360
He won't be an engineer anymore.

776
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:38,240
lt's okay. Tom is capable.
He can do a lot of different things.

777
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,000
But there's nothing like running a train.

778
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,640
Go on.

779
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,320
What do you call this one?

780
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,520
That's the Atlas 3086.

781
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,080
-lt's really nice.
-Yeah, thanks.

782
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,960
l could tell them she wanted to die.

783
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,720
What?

784
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,000
You could say it at your trial.

785
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:21,680
No, it's a hearing. It's not a trial.
It's all right. Thanks.

786
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,000
You don't want me to tell them?

787
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,480
lt doesn't really matter
if your mom wanted to die or not.

788
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,000
The only thing that matters
is if l handled the situation correctly.

789
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:35,760
l forgive you.

790
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:42,360
You forgive me for what?

791
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:47,760
She took away my options
when she put her car on the tracks.

792
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,440
Yeah, she did.

793
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,320
lt just so happens she chose my train.

794
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:58,320
l know.

795
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,960
l got zero.

796
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:17,320
-No sick days?
-None.

797
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,720
Excuse me. Hi, l was wondering
if you could help.

798
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,400
Well, what is a pretty girl like you
doing in a train station all alone?

799
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:27,360
Well, l'm looking for a missing boy.
Maybe you've seen him.

800
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We saw this guy, right?

801
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,480
-When did we see him?
-Yeah. He just left.

802
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,520
He was riding a horse,
and he said Darth Vader was his father.

803
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,960
-Yeah--
-Yeah, thanks a lot.

804
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:38,720
Wait, wait, wait. Let me see that.

805
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,120
This is Tom's nephew.

806
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:45,800
-No.
-Yeah.

807
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,440
Who's Tom?

808
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,160
He said he forgave me
for killing his mom.

809
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,400
lt used to be so simple, you know?

810
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,160
Black and white.
There was a right thing to do...

811
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,520
...and a wrong thing to do.

812
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,480
Life is more like a gray area, Tom.

813
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,440
Not everything.

814
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,720
Some things you know for certain.

815
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,320
Meggie.

816
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:58,160
Hey, what's wrong?

817
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,240
She's fine.

818
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:14,760
Here.

819
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,920
-The lady from Child Services.
-What?

820
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,360
-She's at the door.
-lt's all right. Stay here.

821
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,680
Who?

822
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,640
The woman who put me
in the foster home.

823
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,080
-Oh, hi. Tom Stark?
-Yeah.

824
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:05,080
Hi, l'm Renee Hargrove.
Ventura Children and Family Services.

825
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:09,200
We didn't actually meet, but l remember
seeing you at the scene of the accident.

826
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:11,440
Would you mind if l came in?

827
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:15,600
Sure.

828
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:17,520
Thank you.

829
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,480
This is a lovely home.

830
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:29,560
l am looking for a missing boy.
David Danner?

831
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,680
l know who he is.

832
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:36,040
-Have you seen him since the accident?
-No.

833
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:37,880
Really?

834
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,760
Oh, l forgot the book.

835
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,800
Oh, this is a great book.

836
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,800
-Do you have children, Mr. Stark?
-That's my wife's.

837
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,520
Would you mind terribly if l just took
a little look around? Do you mind?

838
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,280
-Well--
-Thank you.

839
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,560
David ran away from his foster home.

840
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,280
So, what's that to me?

841
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:11,520
Oh, Mr. Howie Pugh,
the train conductor.

842
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,840
He told me that David
was on the train looking for you.

843
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,160
He claimed to be your nephew.

844
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,360
My nephew?

845
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,520
Do you mind?

846
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,760
Yeah, actually l do.
l mean, this is my home.

847
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,280
l'm sorry. l know this is an imposition.

848
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:38,880
Okay, you should go in here.
Go in here. Just be quiet.

849
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,560
Excuse me,
l don't think you heard what l said.

850
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,280
Tom? What's going on?

851
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:50,960
My wife, Megan.

852
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,880
Oh, l'm sorry to barge in like this,
but l'm looking for a missing boy.

853
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,280
Yes, and l couldn't help but notice...

854
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:02,960
...that the walls
in this room smell freshly painted...

855
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,280
...and there's a little toy train.

856
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,120
-You okay?
-She's sick.

857
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,920
l have cancer, stage four.

858
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:21,680
lt's in my bones.

859
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:25,640
This is the spare room.
l have trouble sleeping.

860
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,560
At night l come in here...

861
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,720
...because l don't wanna disturb
my husband.

862
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,280
He's just painted it for me...

863
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,760
...because blue is my favorite color.

864
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,760
-l'm sorry.
-You said that already.

865
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,920
Do you want to look around?

866
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,920
No, no, that's okay.

867
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,320
l hope you feel better.

868
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,840
l could just show myself out.

869
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:04,680
Thank you.

870
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,600
She's gone, kid.

871
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:35,800
Still high.

872
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,720
We should tell him l'm sick.

873
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:46,480
No, it's too soon.

874
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,320
l don't think he's ready.

875
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,920
l can call Susan
and tell her to bring some dinner.

876
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,280
Don't worry about dinner, all right?

877
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:56,880
Tom?

878
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:02,000
lt's gonna be okay.

879
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,680
Almost ready.

880
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:25,200
And he wants to stay.
He needs us.

881
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,880
So that's that.

882
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,240
Yeah.

883
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,080
-That's the craziest thing l've ever heard.
-l know.

884
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:40,440
-l mean, really.
-Yeah, it's pretty bad.

885
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,600
Good. Let it out.

886
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:05,080
Get it up.

887
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,640
That's all you gotta do. Ready?

888
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,760
Simi Valley Police Station.

889
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,240
Detective Crane, please.

890
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:23,400
Detective Crane speaking.

891
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,760
Hello?

892
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,960
Hello?

893
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:30,120
ls anyone there?

894
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:54,440
-You have to go. l'll be fine.
-Let's not kid ourselves.

895
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,800
Once they find out about the kid,
l'm out of a job. How many of these?

896
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,160
Two. They're not gonna find out
about him. You have to testify.

897
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,160
So you know for sure.

898
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,080
l know l did the right thing.

899
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,480
Then tell them.

900
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:21,840
l don't want you to have any regrets,
Tom. Not because of me.

901
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,680
No, honey, l won't.

902
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,680
l'm gonna go with you.

903
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,160
No, Meg. You're not well enough.

904
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:33,040
Well, l'll feel worse if we don't go.

905
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,240
What about the kid?

906
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,480
We'll take him with us.

907
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,160
We'll wait in the car.

908
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,080
Oh, boy.

909
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,880
All right.

910
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,720
-Thanks a lot, N.B. l appreciate it.
-You bet.

911
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,840
Ready for you, Tom.

912
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,000
Hey, Otis.

913
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,600
You're gonna be the sexiest accountant
in town.

914
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,120
So this is an unofficial hearing, Tom,
and the goal of the proceedings...

915
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:27,440
...is to determine if
an official investigation is necessary.

916
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,080
-l understand.
-Okay.

917
01:18:29,239 --> 01:18:31,400
For the record,
were you the senior engineer.. .

918
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,240
...on February 2nd,
the date of the fatal incident?

919
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:35,400
l was.

920
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,080
And could you describe for us
what happened that day...

921
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,680
...to the best of your recollection?

922
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,200
-l wish l could go in.
-Me too.

923
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:47,760
Why do we have to hide?

924
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,200
Why can't l just tell the social worker
l wanna stay with you?

925
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:55,920
lt doesn't work like that.

926
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,480
But why?

927
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:02,560
People like to follow rules...

928
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,720
...and you staying with us
definitely goes against that.

929
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:13,440
And what was your first reaction
when you saw the car?

930
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:15,640
l slowed the train down.

931
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:19,920
But you didn't use
the emergency brake.

932
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:25,200
l decided not to. The emergency brake
wouldn't have stopped that train in time.

933
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:28,720
But your partner thinks
the impact might have been prevented.

934
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,440
l disagree. At that speed,
with that many cars on the turn...

935
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,360
.. .we probably would've derailed.

936
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,480
lf you could do it all over again,
would you do anything differently?

937
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:44,360
Mr. Stark.

938
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
-l can't do it all over again.
-But if you could.

939
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,120
No.

940
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,840
l wouldn't have done
anything differently.

941
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,080
lt's over, Tom.

942
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,040
There's no official investigation.
Everything was by the book.

943
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,800
Where you going?

944
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,800
Hey, we got a streak schedule
for you tomorrow, Tom.

945
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,200
Megan. Megan....

946
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,680
-l didn't do anything.
-lt's okay. Get in the car. Get in the car.

947
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,360
Honey. Meggie.

948
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,160
-Honey.
-Megan.

949
01:20:31,319 --> 01:20:33,040
Megan.

950
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,440
Megan.

951
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,080
So...

952
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,000
...Megan's sick.

953
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,720
She's got cancer.

954
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,680
Can't they cure her?

955
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:09,040
They did.

956
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:10,920
Twice.

957
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:12,600
lt came back.

958
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:15,600
Can't they cure her again?

959
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,880
ls Megan gonna die?

960
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,240
Can l see her?

961
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:43,960
Tom, she wants to go home.

962
01:22:23,319 --> 01:22:27,440
-Hey, listen. Thanks a lot.
-Of course.

963
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,680
-Let me know if anything changes, okay?
-Yep.

964
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,880
See you.

965
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,560
-Drive safely.
-Yeah.

966
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:04,720
Hey, hey, hey. Stop it. Stop it.
What are you doing?

967
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,560
Hey, hey. Come here. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

968
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,120
-What's going on? What's going on?
-Let go! Let go!

969
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:11,760
-No!
-Hey, hey, hey.

970
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,360
-Take it easy.
-l can't be here.

971
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,240
-What? What are you talking about?
-l can't. l'm bad.

972
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,480
You're ba-- What did you do?
What did you do?

973
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:21,960
l told the principal
that my mom was dead.

974
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:25,560
-You lied? Is that what you did?
-Yes. l shouldn't have.

975
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:30,360
-God's punishing me. l killed her.
-What are you talking about?

976
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,120
-She shouldn't have gone that day.
-No, no, no.

977
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:35,960
-God's not punishing anybody.
-Megan is gonna die too now.

978
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:38,200
Hey, look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

979
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:40,440
Megan was sick long before
you ever got here.

980
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:45,960
-l shouldn't have let her out.
-No. Take it easy. Just take it easy.

981
01:23:46,119 --> 01:23:49,720
l was on the tracks, and l tried.
Mom.

982
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,440
-Davey.
-Mom, l'm so sorry.

983
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,400
-Davey.
-l shouldn't have let you die.

984
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,520
lt's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

985
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,040
-God is punishing me.
-No, you did the right thing.

986
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:01,360
You did the right thing.

987
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,840
Look. Listen to me.
It's okay. It's not your fault.

988
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:09,320
-You di--
-Megan's dying now.

989
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:15,160
-Because she's sick.
-No. God's punishing me.

990
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:16,520
Easy, kid.

991
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:22,200
lt's not your fault, okay?

992
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,160
Here you go.

993
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,760
Why don't you go see Megan now?

994
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,520
Come sit by me.

995
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:36,280
l wish we had more time.

996
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:43,920
l would like to take care of you
a little bit longer.

997
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:52,880
You know, if you think really hard,
maybe you could stay longer.

998
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,880
l love you, Davey.

999
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,080
And l will stay with you.

1000
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,680
l will. Forever.

1001
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,320
Right here.

1002
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,320
l love you too, Megan.

1003
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:13,160
-Promise.
-Anything.

1004
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:19,040
To fight for him.
He is so much like you.

1005
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:24,920
Whatever you want.

1006
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:28,720
Promise.

1007
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,520
l promise.

1008
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,760
Oh, Meg.

1009
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,720
She's gone.

1010
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,800
Hey.

1011
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,000
You remember that lady, Renee?

1012
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:45,840
The social worker?

1013
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:47,600
Yeah.

1014
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,800
l think we need to go see her.

1015
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:52,640
Why?

1016
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,640
Well, you can't hide forever,
you know?

1017
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,800
And you need to go to school...

1018
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,720
...and be a kid again.

1019
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,040
Hey, listen.

1020
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:14,440
l want you to know
that whatever happens...

1021
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,880
...we're in this together.

1022
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:22,080
-Okay?
-Okay.

1023
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:24,040
Okay.

1024
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:31,280
So you ready to see
how that engine of yours does?

1025
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,760
All right. Hit it.

1026
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,120
Okay, pick up a little speed.

1027
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,520
There you go.

1028
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,840
Okay, back it off just a little.

1029
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,200
Yeah. Not bad.

1030
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,920
Not bad at all.
