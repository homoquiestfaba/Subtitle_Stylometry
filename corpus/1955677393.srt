NETFLIX PRESENTS
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

2
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,349
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,977
A DAUGHTER OF CAMBODIA REMEMBERS

4
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,694
Under the pretext
that there is a war necessity,

5
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,446
they come into Cambodia.

6
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,942
The Nixon Doctrine
for Southeast Asia appears to have failed.

7
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:54,071
The war that began in Vietnam
has now engulfed Cambodia.

8
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:59,035
There is anger and frustration
at the US bombings.

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,831
Thousands of lives lost.
Farms and livelihoods destroyed.

10
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:10,004
Many are now turning to the Khmer Rouge,
who promise to reclaim Cambodia

11
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:13,633
from the government of General Lon Nol,
which is backed by Washington.

12
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,886
But little is known
of the Khmer Rouge's leaders

13
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,972
or their true intentions.

14
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,185
The communist insurgents
now surround the capital, Phnom Penh.

15
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,020
President Ford's speech yesterday,

16
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,856
in which he asked for
no more military aid for Cambodia,

17
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,235
apparently has had an effect,
prompting the embassy to pull out.

18
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,570
APRIL 1975

19
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:38,115
Word that the US was pulling out
of Cambodia came early Saturday morning.

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,994
Journalists and foreign residents
have been told to assemble

21
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,289
at the US embassy before 9:00 a.m.

22
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:49,627
A school several blocks from the embassy
is serving as the makeshift landing zone.

23
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:57,051
The helicopter evacuation is
being carried out by American marines.

24
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,132
Loung.

25
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,593
Loung. Get down!

26
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,596
Be careful. You'll fall.

27
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,735
You are so dirty...
You've finished it!

28
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,739
Let's go and wash your hands.

29
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,278
Have you had fun with your brothers?

30
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:43,533
I can't dance like Khouy.
It's too hard for me.

31
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,121
That's no problem. I'll teach you.

32
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
Yes.

33
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,292
I'm worried, Captain.

34
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,210
The Americans have abandoned us.

35
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,506
They've evacuated their embassy
down to the last man.

36
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,342
It was a mistake for us
to have trusted them.

37
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,137
The Khmer Rouge could reach the city
at any moment.

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,851
Who knows what will happen to Lon Nol
if they get this far?

39
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,605
We are all Cambodians.

40
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,817
So much damage has been done.

41
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,237
If there is a chance to rebuild,
we have to take it.

42
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,120
Help each other to some rice.

43
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,124
Loung.

44
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,169
Just a spoonful?

45
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,796
So you won't get chubby!

46
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,090
Give some to Chou.

47
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,010
An egg for you?

48
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,725
Stop that and eat up.

49
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,981
Let me give you some sauce.

50
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:28,471
Loung!

51
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,306
Loung! Chou!

52
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,683
Come inside!

53
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,310
Loung!

54
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,033
Unity! Unity!

55
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,665
The Americans are gone!
Cambodians must unite!

56
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,096
Chou, come on!

57
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,975
We must welcome our brothers!
Cambodians unite!

58
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,102
Hurry!

59
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,704
Chou, Loung, go and get some lunch.

60
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,292
What's happening outside?

61
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,066
Brothers, you are welcome.

62
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,528
We don't want any bloodshed.

63
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,364
We are all Cambodians.

64
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:12,700
Our country is in our hands.

65
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,497
Angkar has prevailed
throughout the country.

66
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,250
Surrender your weapons.

67
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,795
You now answer to Angkar!

68
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,132
Meng, Khouy, come inside.

69
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,469
Loung.

70
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,763
Go and eat something.

71
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,557
Pa said we have to pack.

72
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,308
Loung, what's happening?

73
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,601
I don't know.

74
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,776
Khouy! You can't take this.

75
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,695
Just take what's important.

76
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,281
Loung! Time to pack.

77
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,077
Only take what we really need.

78
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,622
Ma, please can we take
our New Year's dresses?

79
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,957
Please.

80
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,626
I'll take them.

81
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,836
Go and help Geak get changed.

82
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:07,547
Loung.

83
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,341
Don't stand there.
Go and change, quickly.

84
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,357
You have to leave the city for three days!

85
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,861
Loung, come on!

86
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,491
Pa, let's take the car.

87
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
No, we're taking the truck. Come on!

88
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,165
The Americans are going to bomb the city!

89
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,084
You can return in three days!

90
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,335
Come on, children. Climb up.

91
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,842
Sit down.

92
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,608
Stop that!

93
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,365
Take off your shirts!
And your shoes!

94
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,909
Why are you doing this?

95
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,369
Get them onto the trucks!

96
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,016
Keep moving!

97
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,227
The Americans are going to bomb our city.
You all have to leave!

98
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,188
You'll be safe in the countryside.

99
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,440
You can return in three days.

100
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,108
Do not question Angkar.

101
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,117
Leave! Hurry up!

102
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,080
It's Pa's friend.

103
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,647
Get down, Loung.

104
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,782
Loung, come on, sweetie!

105
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,995
Darling, what are we doing?

106
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,497
It's okay.
We'll have to stay here tonight.

107
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,876
We can't go any further today.

108
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,753
Let's get ourselves organized.

109
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,910
Leave! Now!

110
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,150
Hey!

111
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,776
Get moving!

112
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,278
Come, children.

113
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,738
Time to get going.

114
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,949
Get up.

115
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,283
Hey!

116
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,912
Pack your things!

117
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,126
Comrade, Angkar needs your truck!
You no longer need it.

118
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,628
Pass me the luggage.

119
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:02,383
Let's take our things off the truck.

120
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,386
Loung, put this on.

121
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,264
Only take what we need.

122
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,683
Pa, pass me the bags.

123
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,230
Hey! Comrade!

124
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,439
Your watch.

125
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,316
Angkar needs it.

126
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,611
Hand it over.

127
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,322
Give it to Angkar.

128
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,871
Oh! This is a very nice watch.

129
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,331
Who are you to have such a good watch?

130
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,334
It was a gift from my boss.

131
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,631
Come on. Let's hurry up.

132
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,466
You work for the government?

133
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,387
I don't understand.
I don't speak a foreign language.

134
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,763
Of course you understand.

135
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,100
You work for the government,
don't you?

136
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,895
-Hurry up!
-I don't understand what you are saying.

137
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,563
I think you do.

138
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,233
Please speak normally. I don't understand.

139
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,777
Let's pack our things.

140
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,112
Let's go.

141
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,864
Hurry up!

142
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,339
Faster, faster! Go, go!

143
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,884
Keep on walking! Faster!

144
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,584
What's wrong, sweetheart?

145
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:30,466
The soldiers said we could go back home
after three days.

146
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,218
I'm not so sure.

147
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,262
But it's the third day.

148
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,724
I'm sorry. We have to keep moving.

149
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,976
Pa, I miss home.

150
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:45,272
We can't go home.

151
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,987
Let's go.

152
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,907
Let's keep walking.

153
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,367
Be brave, my child.

154
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,786
We will try to rest soon.

155
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,097
People!

156
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:22,559
Nobody passes this point
without permission!

157
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,395
Come forward!

158
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:33,529
Any government officials,
police officers, soldiers, teachers...

159
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,407
must step up to the table
and identify themselves.

160
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,872
All families have to register their names.

161
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,292
Soldiers from the Lon Nol army,

162
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,002
or anyone unable to work,
must step aside.

163
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:51,797
Remember, we are workers.

164
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,050
Do whatever they say and don't argue.

165
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,555
Step forward!

166
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,853
You don't need money anymore.

167
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,105
In the new Cambodia,

168
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,361
there will be no banking,
no trading, and no private property.

169
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,823
No rich, no poor. No class.
We are all the same now.

170
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,616
What is your work?

171
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,369
Is this a Lon Nol army uniform?

172
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,662
That's not mine.

173
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,998
Take him away!

174
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,801
What is your work?

175
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,346
I am a packer at the shipping port.

176
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,730
Remove her shoes.

177
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,467
All right, you are clear. You can go.

178
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,137
Next!

179
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,837
Loung, let's go to the lake.

180
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,053
Wake up!

181
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,223
Loung, wake up.

182
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,812
Gather your things quickly.
We have to go.

183
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,491
What do you monks contribute? Nothing!

184
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,370
You monks are parasites! Work harder!

185
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,793
Now you can be the cows!

186
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,630
Pull the plow!

187
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,131
Work hard! Work for Angkar!

188
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:17,438
Look, that looks like your uncle!

189
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,527
Brother Leang!

190
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,455
I've been looking for you
since I heard Phnom Penh was evacuated.

191
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,956
Hello, Uncle.

192
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,875
There is some food in the cart.

193
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,924
They are so poor.

194
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,469
We are poor now, too.

195
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,138
From today,
we no longer speak of rich or poor.

196
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,667
Is it true everyone was made
to leave Phnom Penh?

197
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,170
Did they bomb the city?

198
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:35,135
Angkar said they were about to,
but I didn't hear any bombing.

199
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,556
The Americans have been bombing us here
for years.

200
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,853
Sometimes days in a row.

201
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,147
They destroyed my house
and killed our cattle.

202
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,150
That's why I support
the Khmer Rouge revolution.

203
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,194
We want a new Cambodia.

204
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,909
This is our land.
The earth and the water are ours.

205
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,828
If you want to stay,

206
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,997
you'll need permission
from the village chief.

207
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,752
You need to be careful
because you're from the city.

208
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,548
Angkar has many eyes.

209
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,090
They can't stay with us.

210
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:59,302
If they find out he was a Lon Nol captain,
it will get us killed.

211
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,973
But this is my sister!

212
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,641
You already know...

213
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:09,062
family ties don't count anymore.

214
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,900
I know. I know perfectly well.

215
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,239
They will kill all of us.

216
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,826
Do you want us to die?

217
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,522
Comrade!

218
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,113
Come and sit on my lap, sweetheart.

219
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,874
They said to wait here and we would
be brought to food and shelter.

220
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,712
I heard on the American radio
that Saigon has fallen.

221
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,048
The Americans have pulled out of Vietnam.

222
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,721
Off the truck! Hurry up!

223
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,177
All of you, on the carts!

224
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,766
Follow me.

225
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,810
Get on the cart with your brother.

226
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,021
Everything will be fine.

227
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,722
You monks are parasites.
Leeches draining the blood of the people!

228
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,863
Faster.

229
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,913
Get off now!

230
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,170
Come, Loung.

231
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,672
Get down. They're coming!

232
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,763
Take your sister.

233
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,769
Let's get you off there.

234
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,028
You can't stay here, sweetheart.

235
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,962
Put down what you are carrying.

236
00:34:55,676 --> 00:35:02,558
Angkar rejects everything that was part
of imperialist and feudalist society.

237
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:10,525
Foreign possessions corrupt
the people of this country.

238
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,487
You must renounce all personal property.

239
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,157
Get rid of your selfish ways of thinking.

240
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,828
Angkar will take care of you.

241
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:29,168
Angkar is your family now.

242
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,838
Follow me.

243
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,340
Quickly!

244
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,102
-Bloodsuckers!
-You should be shot and killed!

245
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,021
You live off the back
of hardworking people like us!

246
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,982
Can't you even walk?

247
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,528
Move!

248
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,780
This plot is yours.

249
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,909
Your place is over there.

250
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:10,668
He said our place is this way.

251
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,441
Comrades!

252
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,695
Your first work assignment is
to build your own house.

253
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,989
No one is going to build it for you!

254
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:46,912
Go get some berries and dye your clothes,
so you can get rid of all colors.

255
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,708
We are all equal.

256
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,961
When we dress the same,

257
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,799
we rid ourselves
of corrupt Western vanity.

258
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,094
Develop a revolutionary mindset.

259
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,097
You must obey Angkar.

260
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,267
Angkar is the ruler.

261
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,728
Give me the shirt.

262
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,313
Come on.

263
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,542
Chou. Come here.

264
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,464
Hide this shirt.

265
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,702
Come forward.

266
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,261
Comrade, sit here.

267
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,598
Comrade, sit over there.

268
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,682
Sit down there.

269
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,560
Sit down.

270
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:39,084
There is no more individualism
or private property.

271
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,925
You must rid yourself
of personal possessions.

272
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,239
Angkar is all-powerful.

273
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,077
Angkar is the savior and liberator
of the Khmer people.

274
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,429
Work your hardest for Angkar.

275
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,223
Give your all.

276
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,523
Comrades!

277
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,609
From now on,
our harvest won't depend on the weather.

278
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,193
We will have all the water we need.

279
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,241
Now, the rice field is your paper,
and the hoe is your pen.

280
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,619
Give everything.

281
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,662
Dig a straight line!

282
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,417
Keep the rows straight.

283
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,503
Keep on working!

284
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,954
Angkar leads the revolution in Kampuchea!

285
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,167
Angkar leads the revolution in Kampuchea!

286
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,881
Comrade Khoeun,
do you have something to say?

287
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:36,428
Comrade Sun does not use the medicine
of our revolution.

288
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:39,431
Instead, he has been searching
for Western medicine.

289
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:40,558
I saw it, too.

290
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,019
Comrade Sun. Stand up.

291
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,438
Is it true?

292
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,359
My child had fever.
And he had bad diarrhea.

293
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,154
If I hadn't given him French medicine,
he would have died.

294
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,323
Sorry, comrade.

295
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,076
Angkar does not believe you.

296
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,161
No! I'm telling you the truth!

297
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,289
You still behave as an individual.

298
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,041
Comrade Proem.
Take him to re-education.

299
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,501
No, please don't!

300
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,463
Don't hurt me! Have mercy!

301
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,090
I'm sorry, comrade!

302
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,385
Sit!

303
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:23,851
Angkar thanks Comrade Khoeun,
who is loyal to Angkar.

304
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,770
Discard your old ways of thinking.

305
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:31,108
Angkar will destroy all enemies,

306
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:34,945
visible and invisible!

307
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:55,090
If they find out who I am,
you and the children would be in danger.

308
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,594
You must do what we've discussed.

309
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,056
I know you understand.

310
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:06,185
I can't. They are too young.

311
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,978
Promise me.

312
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:41,530
The comrades on the front line
need rice and vegetables.

313
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,866
Get back to work in the fields.

314
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:42,299
Do not forget to work hard,
and don't make them angry.

315
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,676
Yes.

316
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,808
May angels take care of you, sweetheart.

317
00:46:55,729 --> 00:47:00,525
Angkar is your mother and father.

318
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,116
Angkar needs strong young men and women.

319
00:47:09,534 --> 00:47:12,829
The revolution is not only
in this village.

320
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,583
It is taking place throughout Kampuchea.

321
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,882
Angkar knows what is best
for every one of us.

322
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,426
Go to the front!

323
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,227
Look after yourself
and your brother and sister.

324
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,436
Loung.

325
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,279
You have to think
with a revolutionary mindset.

326
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,457
Stand in line.

327
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,190
It is your duty to report
any wrongdoing to Angkar.

328
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,442
You must keep each other in check.

329
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,200
Why did you eat a bean?

330
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,742
Why? Why did you do that?

331
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,414
I am so sorry.

332
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,833
Please don't punish me.

333
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,751
You're sorry?

334
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,671
You stole and now you expect forgiveness?

335
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,383
I'm sorry.

336
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,427
Why did you do it?

337
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,346
Tell the truth!

338
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,473
I only ate a little.

339
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,933
A little?

340
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:03,227
You ate that much!

341
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,150
How dare you argue with me!

342
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,157
Are you still denying it?

343
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,450
Get back to work!

344
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:21,953
And you, too.

345
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,305
It's better to make a mistake
and kill an innocent person

346
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,182
than to leave an enemy alive.

347
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,069
Hurry up. Make sure no one sees us.

348
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,622
I have something for you.

349
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:14,881
Put it in.

350
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,264
I have something else.

351
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,169
Eat this, sweetheart.

352
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,152
-Do you like it?
-Yes, Pa.

353
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,952
Just do this.

354
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:36,255
One day, when we return home,
what would you like to eat then?

355
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,424
I would like to eat Ma's chicken soup.

356
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,141
What about you, my loves?

357
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,769
I'd like to eat crunchy roast pork.

358
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:54,188
And I'd like to have coconut custard.

359
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,987
That's all I have.

360
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,241
Looks like someone got into the rice.

361
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,839
Maybe it was the rats.

362
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:10,301
It's all right. I'll hang it higher.

363
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,388
Kim, why are you hitting your sister?

364
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,898
Don't worry, sweetheart.

365
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,622
Come here, son.

366
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,048
Don't fight, children.

367
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,933
You have to love each other.

368
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,438
Don't cry. It's okay.

369
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,484
Don't cry.

370
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,862
There's no need for tears.

371
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,075
Go help your mother.

372
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,328
Don't upset her.

373
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,245
Ma!

374
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:46,540
Comrade.

375
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,752
What is it?

376
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,629
I have a message from Angkar.

377
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,050
It's about your daughter Keav.

378
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,563
Thank you.

379
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:12,650
Come.

380
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,994
You're all right.

381
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,412
Don't worry.

382
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,539
Ma is here.

383
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,380
I am here to take care of you.

384
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,931
Work faster!

385
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,211
Why are you standing around?

386
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,712
Get back to work!

387
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,151
What happens when people die?

388
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:48,157
At first they think
they're sleeping peacefully,

389
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,161
not knowing they are dead.

390
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,373
They sleep for three days.

391
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,709
And then on the third day,
they wake up.

392
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:04,048
That's when they realize they are dead.

393
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,593
They walk to a river,

394
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,306
wash the dirt from their bodies,

395
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:20,023
and start their journey to heaven
to reincarnate.

396
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,403
Where do they go?

397
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,200
I don't know.

398
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:41,335
I hope Keav won't have to come back here.

399
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:32,155
-Is Comrade Im here?
-Yes, comrade.

400
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,250
Comrade, what can I do for you?

401
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,420
Angkar needs your help
to repair the bridge near Prey Svay.

402
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,465
Comrade, you must come with us.

403
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,720
Please wait a moment, comrade.

404
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:15,072
Put on a brave face for the children.

405
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:25,374
They're waiting for me.

406
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,334
Time to get down, sweetheart.

407
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:20,096
Son, you're the big brother now.

408
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,597
Enough! Time to go!

409
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,224
I have to go.

410
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,019
It's all right.

411
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,969
Brothers and sisters, go to work.

412
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:02,763
Now!

413
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,016
Pa!

414
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,361
Pa, come back!

415
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,779
My tummy hurts.

416
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:47,910
Ma, I'm hungry.

417
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,164
Enough. I'm going.

418
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,532
Is there someone there?

419
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:29,410
If I catch you, I'll beat you to death.

420
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,246
-Forgive me!
-Do you hear me?

421
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,333
-I asked you a question!
-I'm sorry!

422
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,961
Eat it! Go on, eat it!

423
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,588
Forgive me!

424
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,300
Little bastard!

425
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:47,303
Now will you steal again?

426
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:49,012
I will stop!

427
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,139
If I catch you again...

428
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,058
I will kill you!

429
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,146
Get out of here!

430
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:01,567
Beat it!

431
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,623
My poor child!

432
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,378
I'm sorry. I tried.

433
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:30,721
I'll be gentle.

434
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,594
You have to leave and go far away.

435
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:13,346
You must each go in a different direction.

436
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,769
Kim, head south.

437
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,440
Chou, you must go north.

438
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:25,901
Loung, you go east.

439
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:27,903
Do you understand?

440
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,546
You all have to walk
until you reach a work camp.

441
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:52,928
Tell them that you are orphans
so they will take you in.

442
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:59,435
Never tell anyone your real name.

443
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:06,692
That way, if they catch one of you,
they will not get the others.

444
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,749
Pa left this for you.

445
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:27,045
PA AND MA LOVE YOU

446
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,210
I don't want to go.

447
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,170
You have to.

448
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,217
-Ma!
-I don't have any choice!

449
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:15,678
You must leave!

450
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,683
Go. Out!

451
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,728
Get up!

452
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:23,430
Let's go.

453
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:43,450
Hey! Comrades.

454
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:45,077
There are two kids walking around.

455
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:00,842
Comrade!

456
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,779
Where are you going, comrade?

457
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,866
We are orphans.
We are looking for a place to live.

458
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,212
Keep on walking that way, comrade.

459
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:41,049
You will see a red flag.
That's the field.

460
01:18:55,563 --> 01:18:57,482
Thank you.

461
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,878
Comrades, what are you doing here?

462
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:03,924
My sister and I are orphans.

463
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,634
How old are you?

464
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:11,139
I am seven. My sister is ten.

465
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,391
Leave your things there.

466
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,768
Then come straight back to work.

467
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,521
Yes, comrade.

468
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,696
Hurry up!

469
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:04,359
What's your name?

470
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:05,610
Saryn.

471
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,036
Angkar is all-powerful.

472
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:18,623
Angkar is the savior and liberator
of the Khmer people.

473
01:21:18,706 --> 01:21:21,376
You are all Angkar's children.

474
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:24,922
Clay is molded while it is soft.

475
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:28,008
Only you, children, are free from stain.

476
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:33,846
Our soldiers at the front line
are crushing the Vietnamese enemies.

477
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:36,724
Long live our glorious
revolutionary Kampuchea!

478
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:53,570
Comrade Saryn!
Comrade Sat, come here!

479
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:02,579
Faster!

480
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:38,865
Enough! No affection here!
Don't be weaklings. Get going!

481
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:48,958
You have to go now, comrades.

482
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,299
You have to go.

483
01:25:10,062 --> 01:25:12,064
Don't drag your feet!

484
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,035
Comrade Srei!

485
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,915
I've brought some new comrades.

486
01:26:10,998 --> 01:26:13,293
These children are very smart and strong.

487
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:16,213
They will help our revolution.

488
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,256
Come with me.

489
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,178
Crush the Vietnamese!

490
01:26:26,473 --> 01:26:28,350
They are like cockroaches.

491
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:34,480
We must take our knives
and spill their guts into the dirt!

492
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:37,233
Smash the aggressors
who dare to invade our country!

493
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:51,748
On your feet!

494
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:55,126
Remember this.

495
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,336
Listen, comrades.

496
01:26:57,128 --> 01:27:00,382
You must have a revolutionary mindset.

497
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:19,609
You see?

498
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,861
Do not fear our enemies!

499
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:23,988
Use your pain to fight the enemy.

500
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:27,074
Never show weakness
in the face of the enemy.

501
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:29,827
Do you hear me?

502
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:31,955
Yes, we do.

503
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,457
Do you understand, comrades?

504
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,584
We do.

505
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,129
Fight! Get in position.

506
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:56,813
Make a good hole.

507
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:59,065
Pull the pin out. Twist it.

508
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,235
Place it in.

509
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,074
Keep it steady.

510
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,412
Now activate it.

511
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:29,220
Cover it up. Use leaves, twigs, dirt.

512
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:30,860
Pay attention.

513
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:34,906
This is our valuable weapon.

514
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:37,324
Anyone can shoot it.

515
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:44,957
Take the cartridge out, fill it up,
put it back.

516
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,876
You push this in.

517
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:50,379
Take aim.

518
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,924
Your right hand squeezes the trigger.

519
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:14,028
-Do you understand?
-We do.

520
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:16,072
-Got it?
-Yes.

521
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:20,201
Long live the invincible
Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea.

522
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:44,011
Next!

523
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:13,207
Spend a few hours with your sister
and then come back immediately.

524
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,851
The soldiers came for them.

525
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:21,603
Mama! Wake up!

526
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,189
Mama!

527
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,443
Mama!

528
01:39:20,912 --> 01:39:22,581
Comrades, stand up!

529
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:31,090
Never let down your guard!
If you do, they'll kill you.

530
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:35,386
You must protect yourselves
in any way you can.

531
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:38,097
-Do you understand?
-We do.

532
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:41,767
-Destroy the Vietnamese!
-Destroy them! Destroy them! Destroy them!

533
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:44,686
Long live the invincible
Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea!

534
01:41:16,069 --> 01:41:17,946
Follow me.

535
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:26,705
Chou!

536
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:30,751
Chou!

537
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,625
Come join us.

538
01:48:37,468 --> 01:48:40,847
This is Comrade Gat.
And this is Comrade Geh.

539
01:48:44,267 --> 01:48:46,353
So, let's stay together!

540
01:48:46,436 --> 01:48:47,688
I have a chicken.

541
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:50,732
Let's eat it together.

542
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,536
There are some eggs in the snake!

543
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:47,831
-The eggs are tasty.
-Very tasty.

544
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:47,742
Loung, hurry!

545
01:58:49,831 --> 01:58:50,957
Comrade! Comrade!

546
01:58:51,541 --> 01:58:54,335
They caught a Khmer Rouge soldier!
They're taking him up there!

547
02:03:58,556 --> 02:03:59,682
What's your name?

548
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:01,934
Mani.

549
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:03,227
What's your name?

550
02:04:05,771 --> 02:04:06,856

This film is dedicated to those who
lost their lives under the Khmer Rouge.

552
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:50,185
And those who survived.

553
02:08:18,482 --> 02:08:22,444
US Air Force data revealed
that over 2.7 million tons of explosives

554
02:08:22,527 --> 02:08:25,572
were dropped
during the secret bombing of Cambodia,

555
02:08:25,655 --> 02:08:26,824
a neutral country.

556
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:31,495
Through execution,
starvation and forced labor,

557
02:08:31,578 --> 02:08:33,622
the Khmer Rouge systematically killed

558
02:08:33,706 --> 02:08:35,958
nearly a quarter
of the country's population.

559
02:08:37,918 --> 02:08:41,171
A daughter of Cambodia remembers

560
02:08:41,255 --> 02:08:45,509
so that others may never forget.
