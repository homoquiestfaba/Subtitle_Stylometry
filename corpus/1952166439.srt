1
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:51,693
In a story so bizarre I can scarcely
believe the event I'm reporting,

2
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:54,329
and yet corroborated by at least
a dozen eyewitnesses,

3
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,634
a white male apparently fell from
the sky above downtown Los Angeles today,

4
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:02,237
landed in the middle of a busy
intersection, destroying one vehicle

5
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:04,373
and hospitalizing its elderly driver,

6
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:08,377
and then was removed from the scene
before emergency personnel could respond.

7
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,446
Without a body, the police have yet to
piece together the events of a day

8
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:14,783
that can only be described
as...implausible.

9
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:17,653
Reports of a second body landing
in the Boyle Heights area have yet

10
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:21,783
to be confirmed and are being treated as
the bullshit they most likely are.

11
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:36,064
Ooooooh.

12
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,055
Ahhh.

13
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:44,032
You big cock English.

14
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:46,262
Strong like horse.

15
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,398
Fuck that.

16
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:03,473
That's not so bad.

17
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,520
You like nice and rough.

18
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,375
Nice.

19
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,762
Pick up, Eve.

20
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,305
The number you have reached is not
in service at this time and--

21
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:04,465
Fuck!

22
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,666
Shit.

23
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,311
You lost?

24
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:16,047
Nope.

25
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:22,844
Shit.

26
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:29,388
Shit.

27
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,495
Shit.

28
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,030
Shit.

29
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,157
On your knees, son.

30
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:42,537
Okay, chow mein. Who do you work for?

31
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:44,596
Fuck you, Chelios.

32
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,477
Fuckin' ground.

33
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:55,175
Oo.

34
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,713
Fuck.

35
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:03,684
Oo-Oo.

36
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:09,364
You found me in quite an unpleasant
mood this morning, mate.

37
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:12,634
Now... I'm gonna ask you this
question one time.

38
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:16,195
Who's gots my fucking strawberry tart?

39
00:09:19,774 --> 00:09:21,609
Capiche?

40
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:22,711
J-J-...

41
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,879
...-J-...J-J-...

42
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,247
...-J-J--

43
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,516
...Just spit the fucking name out!

44
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,118
Johnny Vang!

45
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:31,886
Johnny fucking Vang?

46
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:33,888
Johnny fucking Vang?

47
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:34,889
Good boy. Where?

48
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:36,758
Cypress Social Club!

49
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:39,894
Cypress...Cypress Social Club.

50
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:42,330
Now you're sure about that, ain't ya?

51
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,766
Good boy. Thanks for coming.

52
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,563
Now you can keep that.

53
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,719
Hello. Doc Miles.

54
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:15,019
Yeah... Doc, it's Chev.

55
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:17,425
Jesus H... Chelios!

56
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:18,893
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

57
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:20,829
Listen, I'm deadly fuckin' serious, Doc.

58
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:23,465
These Triad motherfuckers cut out
my fuckin' heart

59
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,467
and put in one of those plastic
artificial jobs.

60
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,731
You got an artificial heart?

61
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:31,072
Do you think I'm having a fuckin' laugh?

62
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:33,308
No-No-No, but you got to admit,
it's a little out there, dude.

63
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:35,043
Yeah, you take your fuckin' time, Doc.

64
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:37,078
You don't have any time,
if you've got an artificial heart.

65
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,214
They're not designed to keep you
alive more than a couple days

66
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:40,548
while you're waitin' on a transplant.

67
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:42,350
And don't do anything strenuous.

68
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,852
Yeah, sure, Doc. No problem.

69
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:45,320
So what's my next fuckin' move?

70
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,056
Well, we got to get a real heart put
back in you preferably your own.

71
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:48,857
I'm on it.

72
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:49,858
Okay, you're on it.

73
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,459
Doc! Jesus fucking Christ!

74
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:52,260
I'm-I'm sorry.

75
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,694
Sorry.

76
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:56,464
Does-Does-- Let me-- Does that thing
have a a-a-a a belt battery pack?

77
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:57,198
Check.

78
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:59,291
How many bars are showing?

79
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:00,935
One.

80
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,637
Shit. That's better than none, I guess.

81
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:07,199
Look, what they did you with is
an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

82
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:11,946
It's got an internal battery that'll
pick up once the belt battery dies.

83
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,815
It's like a reserve tank.

84
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:17,952
Once the internal battery takes over,
you got one fuckin' hour.

85
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:20,255
The internal battery charges
wirelessly through

86
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,490
its transcutaneous energy transfer system.

87
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,327
Two coils, there's one internal,
one external that transmit the, uh,

88
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:30,632
magnetic force across the skin
without piercing the surface.

89
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:34,135
The internal coil receives power
and sends it to the controller device.

90
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,871
Is this makin' any fuckin' sense to you,
Chevy?

91
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,340
It's fucking Greek, Doc.

92
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,773
Greek.

93
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,945
Look, you got to keep your body
electrically charged to keep

94
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:45,413
that piece of shit pumpin'.

95
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:46,648
Copy that.

96
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:47,448
Hey, Chev.

97
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:48,416
Yeah.

98
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,418
I'm stoked you're alive, dude.

99
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:51,753
I'll get back to you, Doc.

100
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:53,744
Yeah, well, y-- Call me.

101
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,987
Fuck!

102
00:12:58,593 --> 00:12:59,460
Hey-Hey-Hey!

103
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,528
That's a nice car.

104
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:03,464
I don't suppose you know where
the Cypress Social Club is, do you?

105
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:05,099
Man, fuck that shit, puto.

106
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,802
Let's race, ese.

107
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,904
Don't you tempt me, fucker.

108
00:13:09,904 --> 00:13:12,395
What I need from you is directions.

109
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,764
Oh, shit.

110
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,739
Shit!

111
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:10,760
Damn, dog. You good, ese?

112
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:13,628
Tiger fuckin' Woods.

113
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:18,768
Never better.
Greatest day of my fuckin' life.

114
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:24,912
You gents couldn’t point me
in the direction of the

115
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:27,649
Cypress Social Club, could ya?

116
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,717
Well, you ain't too far.

117
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:32,987
You go down Orange for, like,
two miles and then you're there, homes.

118
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,648
Cool.

119
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,555
You mind givin' me a jump?

120
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,326
Just juice me.

121
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:40,349
Hey, Menudo, where's the fuckin' Social Club?

122
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:46,821
Uh, donde esta La Social Club?

123
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,195
Buenos nachos, white boy.

124
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:02,534
This is a fucking social club?

125
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:11,753
You Johnny Vang?

126
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:12,685
Uh-uh.

127
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:54,687
Go!

128
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:27,094
Get lost, bitch.

129
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:28,026
Fuck you!

130
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:31,666
What?

131
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,167
Where's Johnny Vang?

132
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,101
You lookin' to get your ass killed, dog?

133
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:38,773
Wrong expression.

134
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:40,365
You ain't tappin' my ass.

135
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,970
There you go, cupcake.

136
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,181
Fuckin' no Ebola for me today, thanks.

137
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,286
There goes my ride!

138
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,860
What's that, fucking cunt-onese?

139
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:03,690
I'd rather stick my dick in a blender.

140
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:24,585
Johnny Vang?

141
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:25,453
Yes.

142
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:26,886
Where?

143
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:39,267
Hey, dude why you in rush?

144
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,401
Wait for me!

145
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:42,003
Goddamn!

146
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:42,670
Get off me!

147
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,238
Get out of the fucking car!

148
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:46,536
Hey!

149
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:51,239
Get your own fuckin' station wagon!

150
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:54,444
Damn!

151
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,208
Fuck!

152
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,519
Hey!

153
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,187
You taking this too fast with me.

154
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:00,855
Which way?

155
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,057
I want you to take it slow.

156
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:04,684
Which way?

157
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:10,164
Hey! Hey!

158
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:11,927
You didn't ask name.

159
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,597
Shut up a minute, for fuck's sake!

160
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:18,500
Where is he?

161
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:20,741
Johnny Vang?

162
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,208
Yes!

163
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,942
Motherfucker!

164
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:36,646
Baby!

165
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:59,343
Where's fuckin' Chelios?

166
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,313
You like sushi, Chinese man?

167
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:18,766
How the fuck am I supposed to know
what kind of ''-ese'' you is,

168
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,631
you slanty-eyed fuck?

169
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:24,799
Check it out. Sushi.

170
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:44,247
Hey, Chico!

171
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:47,951
Hm?

172
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,865
We can make a deal.

173
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:52,355
Hm?

174
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:16,913
Eve?

175
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:21,852
Eve.

176
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,294
Here, baby.

177
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:54,591
Eve!

178
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,790
Chev.

179
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:07,475
Hey. I need you to take your fuckin'
hands off Lemon now, man.

180
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,009
Who the fuck are you?

181
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,878
Who the fuck am I?
Who the fuck are you?

182
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:13,080
Do you know this guy, Lemon?

183
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,048
''Lemon''?

184
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:16,951
You were dead.

185
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:18,919
Uh...

186
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,082
I'm...uh, I'm so confused right now.

187
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:23,858
What's that ticking sound?

188
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,059
Yeah, what is that sound?

189
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:26,193
You're kinda weird, tick-man.

190
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:27,751
It's time for you to go!

191
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,233
Randy?

192
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,724
''Randy''? Come here.

193
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:52,851
Fuck!

194
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,625
Not you.

195
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,692
Babe, it's not--

196
00:22:58,692 --> 00:22:59,827
Who the fuck is that?

197
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:01,454
Ah, some whore.

198
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:02,730
Fuck, no.

199
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,731
That was a mistake.

200
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:04,198
Oh, fuck.

201
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:06,333
Look she's helpin' me find my heart.

202
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,935
Yeah. What?

203
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:08,769
Go away.

204
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,430
Come on, let's go.

205
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,800
What?

206
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:23,115
Oh, you dozy cunt.

207
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,025
No.

208
00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:36,397
We need his ass alive.

209
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:38,299
Chev Chelios.

210
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:39,733
Let's save some bullets, dude.

211
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:41,869
I'm up for that,
when we've all had a drink.

212
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:43,304
Should I duck?

213
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:44,498
Yeah.

214
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:45,591
Shall I bypass the formalities?

215
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,168
Of course.

216
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:51,535
Who do you work for and what the fuck
do they want with me?

217
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,274
EI Huron.

218
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:54,208
English!

219
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,510
What's a fuckin' ''EI who-done''?

220
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,637
It's a ferret.

221
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:04,818
He wants you alive...
so he can watch you die.

222
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:07,288
Oh, yeah? Why?

223
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:11,224
I don't know. Doesn't everybody?

224
00:25:12,393 --> 00:25:17,057
Shut up. Oo, you lucky bastard.

225
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,231
Eve, let's go.

226
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:32,238
Che-Che, Che-Che-Che-- Chev Cherios.

227
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:44,948
Get on the floor now!

228
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:50,491
Turn around.

229
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:52,859
Hey!

230
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:54,725
Hey!

231
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,172
Oh, it's on now!

232
00:25:58,172 --> 00:25:59,969
No, stop!

233
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,074
Get off!

234
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:06,378
Get off me, ma'am!

235
00:26:14,722 --> 00:26:16,690
Stop it!

236
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,884
No!

237
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:14,114
Why didn't you call me?

238
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:15,416
Like fuck I didn't.

239
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,247
Didn't you get my message?

240
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:21,388
No!

241
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:23,090
Where have you been for the last
three months?

242
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,324
I thought you were dead.

243
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:26,093
I fell a mile out of a helicopter.

244
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:27,161
It's a long story.

245
00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:28,762
No way! You know what?

246
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:29,963
That's totally possible.

247
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:33,233
I saw this video on YouTube
where this guy's parachute doesn't open

248
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:36,403
and he falls like fourteen thousand feet
and he lives.

249
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:40,339
Yes baby, I know it's possible
because I fuckin' did it!

250
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:41,642
Quit it.

251
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:43,076
Since when were you on the Internet?

252
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:45,145
You know, a lot of things have
changed since you died.

253
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:46,880
I didn't fuckin' die.

254
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,474
Well, that's besides the point,
isn't it?

255
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:55,912
Get off!

256
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:58,421
Oo!

257
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:02,362
Where are we going, Chev?

258
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:03,330
I don't know.

259
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,533
I need to find that slant from the club,
the one with the red cooler.

260
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:09,229
Are you talking about Johnny Vang?

261
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,485
Do you know Johnny Vang?

262
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,886
I know his ass.

263
00:28:25,886 --> 00:28:28,455
He's got that box with him all the time.

264
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,157
That box. I need it.

265
00:28:30,157 --> 00:28:35,094
I can bet on my grandma's coochie he's
at the horse track.

266
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:40,400
Dude, you gonna put Johnny Vang on ice?

267
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,502
Maybe.

268
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:44,471
That's so fuckin' sexy.

269
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:47,241
Fuckin' dead.

270
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:49,209
Didn't they cuff you?

271
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:53,580
Damn it. Do me.

272
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,639
I'll do you.

273
00:28:59,052 --> 00:29:00,246
Bitch.

274
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,124
I got to get a hold--
I've got to call Doc.

275
00:29:04,124 --> 00:29:05,259
I need a cell phone.

276
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:06,026
Why didn't you just say it?

277
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:08,119
I have a cell phone.

278
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:10,663
Here.

279
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:17,704
You got a cell phone.

280
00:29:17,704 --> 00:29:19,072
I got you.

281
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:20,207
Okay?

282
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:22,543
You've got to work for the things that--

283
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:23,610
Chevy?

284
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,412
I lost the belt battery, Doc.

285
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:26,213
How long ago?

286
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:27,114
Over an hour.

287
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:29,216
Jesus Christ, that's not fuckin'
possible, Chevy.

288
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,251
You should be dea-- Fuck, never mind.

289
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:33,086
Look...it's a wireless system,

290
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:36,356
so any kind of low-level electrical
shock to your skin should juice it.

291
00:29:36,356 --> 00:29:37,824
At least temporarily.

292
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:40,060
Hey, Chev I'm a certified heart surgeon.

293
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,595
Well, I... I was.

294
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:42,896
I lost my license after I fucked up

295
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:45,933
my ex-wife's vaginal rejuvenation
procedure in our basement.

296
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:47,434
That's irrelevant right now.

297
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:49,436
The point is if you can get
hold of your heart,

298
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,438
I'm reasonably sure I can
put it back in for you.

299
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:52,339
Okay, Doc.

300
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:56,002
I'll be in touch when I find that
Chinese cocksucker that's got me pump.

301
00:29:57,878 --> 00:29:59,780
That you even had to choose
between Phyllis and me.

302
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,372
Chinese?

303
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:03,684
Sharon, I just shut down, okay?

304
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:04,718
I couldn’t think.

305
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:05,485
I couldn’t feel.

306
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:09,478
Hey, Chocolate would you get off your
fat ass and get dressed?

307
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:11,992
Why?

308
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Do you have any idea...how silly

309
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,763
Is Doc Miles gonna have to choke a bitch?

310
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:20,199
Do you know that I was waiting for
those results, too?

311
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,935
I needed to put things in perspective.

312
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:24,171
Oh, you needed? I see, you needed.

313
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:26,799
I think I know who we're dealing with.
That's how you do things now.

314
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:36,210
''Hell, no, we won't blow!''

315
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,221
For fuck's sake move!

316
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:43,246
Jesus. Shit!

317
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:47,761
What the fuck!

318
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:49,058
Shit!

319
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:51,565
That's right!
You're gonna pay me by the inch, bitch!

320
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:52,099
You make a living!

321
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:53,133
We want to make a living!

322
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,034
You carry a weapon!

323
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:55,969
We carry weapons... in our pants.

324
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:57,337
Sick and tired of this!

325
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:59,640
Pay me my fuckin' wages, mother fuckers!

326
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,908
Droppin' loads on all of
your silly wages!

327
00:31:01,908 --> 00:31:03,110
They need their money.

328
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,178
What, do you want me to fuck this car?

329
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,612
What, do you want me to fuck this car?

330
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:10,917
Suck my fuckin' tits!

331
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,214
Get off the car.

332
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:15,711
I'm gonna bang that bitch in the back!

333
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:17,424
Hi.

334
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:18,692
We're just sick and tired of this!

335
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:20,060
Just because it's porn
doesn't mean we all

336
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,595
want to do it! We like to
get paid for it!

337
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:22,729
This is a weird scene.

338
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:23,997
We've got pissed-off beaver everywhere.

339
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,328
We're on pursuit.

340
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,669
Whoa!

341
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:41,882
''Oh!''

342
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:43,349
Cunt!

343
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:50,023
Sit!

344
00:31:50,023 --> 00:31:51,217
Good--

345
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:54,027
I'm just makin' sure. Whatever.

346
00:31:54,027 --> 00:31:55,896
Dude, he's totally doing
what he's supposed to.

347
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:57,597
Well, he's got to know who's in charge.

348
00:31:57,597 --> 00:31:58,765
Dude!

349
00:31:58,765 --> 00:31:59,466
Come on!

350
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:00,734
He's gonna eat somebody's baby
and you're gonna be in--

351
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,536
No, dude, chill.
Uh, you're gonna get sued.

352
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:03,403
He's totally doing what he's supposed.

353
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:04,304
to be doing. Come on.

354
00:32:04,304 --> 00:32:05,965
Whatever. I wanted a cat.

355
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:07,704
Fuck!

356
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:14,781
See? Way better than a cat, man.

357
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:16,149
Whatever.

358
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:17,551
Who's this fuckin' asshole?

359
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:20,320
You pair of sausage-Nigels.

360
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,456
How do you sleep at night?
Who is this guy?

361
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:23,190
I'm from PETA.

362
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,092
This is animal cruelty, you fuckers.

363
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:26,593
Hello, there.
Hey, give that back, you liberal freak.

364
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:27,961
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah.

365
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:29,596
Um... Dude.
Fuckin' shame on you two.

366
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:31,064
That's two hundred and fifty dollars.
I tell you.

367
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:32,165
You pair of cunts.

368
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:33,533
Press the fucking button.
Well, take it back.

369
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,000
Hit him.

370
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,126
Not so bad.

371
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,038
Disgusting.

372
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:38,505
Morning.

373
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:40,273
Mom would be so proud.

374
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:41,007
Sorry about that.

375
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:41,675
Give me that thing.

376
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:42,903
No.

377
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:46,146
Yeah, there you go. Go on.

378
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:48,815
Ruff, ruff, ruff ruff, ruff ruff!

379
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:50,717
If you don't press that fuckin' button,
you're goin' in the pond.

380
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,412
I'm pressing it. Press it!

381
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:55,155
Come on, what's the matter?

382
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:56,156
Fuckin' wake up!

383
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:57,390
Make him press the button you--

384
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,721
Give him the fuckin'--

385
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:03,296
What are you, fuckin' useless?

386
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:04,965
Hey! No problem.

387
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:06,398
Stop right there!

388
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,460
Stop!

389
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:10,468
Oh, shit.

390
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:14,099
Oh. See, that's what I told you.

391
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:18,268
My fuckin' nuts!

392
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:21,615
Get him off!

393
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,048
It's all right!

394
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:26,481
Will our insurance cover that?

395
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,258
Stop it!

396
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:33,426
Freeze! Get down! Get down!

397
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:36,020
Turn around! Get down!

398
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:38,064
What the fuck is that around your neck?

399
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:40,000
Get down on the ground!

400
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,399
Show me your--

401
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:44,727
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

402
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:50,742
Kaylo?

403
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:52,512
Get on!

404
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:54,314
Both of you down on the ground now!

405
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:56,016
Get down! Get down!

406
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:58,280
Get off that fuckin' moped!

407
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:05,492
Kaylo, I thought you were dead.

408
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:06,293
My name's Venus.

409
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:08,124
I'm from Hollywood.

410
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,321
Kaylo was my brother.

411
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,710
Brother?

412
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,712
No shit.

413
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:27,914
Hey, what the fuck
did you hit me for, anyway?

414
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:29,216
I have a condition.

415
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:31,818
FBT, Full Body Tourette's.

416
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,786
I can't control myself.

417
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:35,188
Jesus!

418
00:34:35,188 --> 00:34:36,519
Fuck!

419
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,459
What the fuck?

420
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,766
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about your brother,

421
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:48,568
but I need to get to the
Hollywood Park racetrack.

422
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:50,593
And I mean right the fuck now.

423
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:58,069
What's the matter,
are you hurIln' or something?

424
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:05,151
Is that where they're at?

425
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:05,919
Who?

426
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,520
The ill suckers that killed my brother.

427
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,155
You're Chev ''The Cheese'' Chelios, right?

428
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:10,223
The sickest, most wickedest motherfucker

429
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:12,792
that ever vaporized a motherfucker
in cold blood, right?

430
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,227
Yeah. That's me.

431
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:16,923
Yeah. So we're gonna get those suckers--

432
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:18,798
Get a grip on yourself.

433
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:20,231
It's already done.

434
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,301
Huh?

435
00:35:21,301 --> 00:35:22,769
It's done.

436
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:25,602
I already took care of
the ones that did Kaylo.

437
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,475
But... AII of them?

438
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:29,409
AII of them.

439
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:31,912
D-E-A-D. Brown bread.

440
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:32,812
Right Said Fred?

441
00:35:32,812 --> 00:35:33,980
Simply Red.

442
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,504
I see.

443
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,118
Well, don't look so gloomy, Elvis.

444
00:35:38,118 --> 00:35:40,954
I can assure you they did
not die pleasantly.

445
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:43,556
No...you don't understand.

446
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:45,058
It's a matter of honor.

447
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:47,993
It should have been me to
avenge my brother's death.

448
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:51,764
Well...so long, Chelios.

449
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:54,191
My brain hurts.

450
00:35:55,435 --> 00:35:59,205
There is one I never got to on account
of I could never find him.

451
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:01,041
The one that calls himself ''The Ferret.''

452
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,342
EI Huron?

453
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:03,276
You know him?

454
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:05,812
No. It means ''The Ferret'' in Spanish.

455
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:08,214
Right. Yeah, I knew that.

456
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:11,741
Listen, you want to find the dude that
made your brother dead, you find him.

457
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:16,915
Chev?

458
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:20,423
Racetrack.

459
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:24,156
You're here.

460
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:02,802
That you, Chelios?

461
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,571
I'm runnin' on empty, Doc.

462
00:37:04,571 --> 00:37:06,061
Same here, buddy.

463
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:09,109
I think I need to stick
my dick in a socket.

464
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:11,277
I don't recommend that.

465
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:12,645
But friction...

466
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:13,413
Friction?

467
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:17,117
Yeah. Skin-on-skin contact
creates static electricity.

468
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:18,184
You're fuckin' kidding me, right?

469
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:22,989
Dude...the friction of two like objects
causes a transfer of electrons.

470
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:25,325
Science one-oh-one, Chevy.

471
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:28,453
You probably ditched that class. I did.

472
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,830
Find someone to rub against.

473
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,298
It's gonna help.

474
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:34,163
Well, it's not gonna hurt.

475
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:41,498
Terrific race.

476
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,671
That's a great horse, mate.

477
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:48,637
What the fuck, man?

478
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:50,050
What the fuck?

479
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,118
What are you doin'?

480
00:37:52,118 --> 00:37:54,211
Mate, that was all you.

481
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:07,357
Yo, man!

482
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,640
Fuckin' Doc.

483
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:22,749
Hey there, mister!

484
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:24,617
Somebody stop him! Stop him!

485
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:27,450
Chev? Oh!

486
00:38:28,988 --> 00:38:30,757
Look, my horse! My horse!

487
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:32,192
Get out of there!

488
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,293
Scram!

489
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:34,453
Please.

490
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:47,040
Hey, oink-oink, chill out.

491
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,308
He's just had too many drinks.

492
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:50,276
I got him. Okay? Go about your business.

493
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:51,177
AII right, then.

494
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:52,378
Honey, let's go.

495
00:38:52,378 --> 00:38:53,413
My heart.

496
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:55,074
Oh, I love you, too.

497
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:57,747
Honey, come on, over here.

498
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:01,254
Are you okay?

499
00:39:01,254 --> 00:39:03,415
Is it the Chinese poison?

500
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:06,081
Friction.

501
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:10,760
Doc said, friction.

502
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:18,795
Chev.

503
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:25,574
Friction. Friction?

504
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:31,507
I'll give you friction.

505
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:33,319
Yeah.

506
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:33,953
Oh.

507
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:34,420
Babe.

508
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,755
Babe, what are you doin'?

509
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:37,390
Yeah. I know how this game works.

510
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,558
Oh, yes, work it, baby.

511
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:39,259
Okay.

512
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:40,886
Yeah. Fuck!

513
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:44,497
Keep goin', doll.

514
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:45,899
Rub it, baby.

515
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:47,033
Yeah rub it!

516
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:48,067
Okay good.

517
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:49,728
Rub it!

518
00:39:52,372 --> 00:39:53,072
Oh, my God.

519
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:54,040
It's gross.

520
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,641
Hey!

521
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:56,040
No!

522
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,178
Oh!

523
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:09,584
Oh, baby.

524
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:17,330
Fuck, it's workin', Eve!

525
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,364
That's smashing!

526
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:20,730
Fuckin' do it, babe! Come on!

527
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:25,205
Doc Miles, you motherfucker!

528
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:26,906
You fuckin' nailed it, Doc!

529
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:29,175
You fuckin' got it, Doctor!

530
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:30,767
Oh, my God.

531
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,374
Baby, switch.

532
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:55,134
Give the kitty some cream, baby.

533
00:40:55,134 --> 00:40:56,936
Give the kitty some more cream.

534
00:40:56,936 --> 00:41:00,473
That's it! Who's your horse!

535
00:41:00,473 --> 00:41:02,065
Fuckin' Eve!

536
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:09,449
This is your lucky day.

537
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:10,917
I fuckin' love you!

538
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:12,976
I love you so much!

539
00:42:00,366 --> 00:42:02,334
Eve! Stop!

540
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:30,257
The race is over!

541
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:32,498
Oh!

542
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:34,432
Door number six!

543
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:37,559
Dude I'm coming!

544
00:42:49,682 --> 00:42:51,584
You're fucking useless.

545
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:53,086
Yeah?

546
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:55,987
Well, you ain't no Ralph Macchio
yourself, Chev!

547
00:43:35,428 --> 00:43:37,623
Oh, fuck!

548
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:42,791
Did I drop some change
or did I hear a chink?

549
00:43:44,971 --> 00:43:46,172
Fuck you, man!

550
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:47,507
Yeah, fuck me?

551
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:49,702
Give me that fuckin' box!

552
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:52,205
Come here, cunt!

553
00:43:54,947 --> 00:43:57,347
Fuck you, Chelios!

554
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:08,795
Number six, Fire Carrier
Number seven.....

555
00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:10,854
Number eight, Flying Bearcat.

556
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:15,234
Get in.

557
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:16,633
Number ten

558
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:26,112
Ah.

559
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:27,814
Chev Chelios.

560
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:29,949
Don motherfucking Kim.

561
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:33,612
Looks like you pulled my lily-white ass
out of the hot grease again.

562
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:39,826
Please...don't thank me.

563
00:44:39,826 --> 00:44:41,160
I don't think I shall.

564
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,730
Now, I'm not sure if you're aware of this,
Jeeves, but your slant-eyed associates

565
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,834
have taken something of
extreme value to me.

566
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:49,769
And I intend to get it back.

567
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:52,071
You know what you are, Chev Chelios?

568
00:44:52,071 --> 00:44:53,439
Tell me.

569
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:57,535
You...are a shit magnet.

570
00:45:16,195 --> 00:45:20,222
Your friend has the gay condition.

571
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:24,337
And now where were we?

572
00:45:24,337 --> 00:45:27,573
You were about to tell me exactly
who's got what I need and why.

573
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:31,475
You may have heard of the name...
''Poon Dong.''

574
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:35,147
Only in dirty limericks.

575
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:39,519
The patriarch of our organization
said to be one hundred years old,

576
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,155
considered to be more god than man
by the Triad gangs.

577
00:45:43,155 --> 00:45:47,994
Well, several months ago, word had spread
out that Poon Dong had taken gravely ill

578
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:52,363
and without a heart transplant,
only had few days left to live.

579
00:45:58,004 --> 00:45:58,871
I see.

580
00:45:58,871 --> 00:46:00,840
Of course, that was unacceptable.

581
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,910
Many a Triad would have given their
hearts from their own breasts to save

582
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:07,413
the life of Poon Dong. But not me.

583
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:09,815
Fuck that. But many.

584
00:46:09,815 --> 00:46:11,751
Then word spread out that there was a man

585
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:15,421
who had a heart so powerful
that he was capable of surviving

586
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:18,879
even our most deadliest of poisons.

587
00:46:22,862 --> 00:46:24,697
Yeah, the Chinese shit.

588
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:26,432
Yes.

589
00:46:26,432 --> 00:46:29,201
It was you, Chev Chelios.

590
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:34,373
It was your heart that Poon Dong
chose to replace his own.

591
00:46:34,373 --> 00:46:39,478
One more question. Who the fuck is
EI Huron, The Ferret?

592
00:46:39,478 --> 00:46:41,614
And how is he involved with all this?

593
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:43,809
The Ferret?

594
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:57,663
Ah. Let's just say our organizations have
a history of, uh, conflicting interests.

595
00:46:57,663 --> 00:46:59,265
I see.

596
00:46:59,265 --> 00:47:02,034
Well, that's mighty white of you
to help me out like this Donald.

597
00:47:02,034 --> 00:47:03,369
Now, if you don't mind...

598
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:05,438
Uh who said I was helping you out?

599
00:47:05,438 --> 00:47:10,643
My reward for returning you to
Poon Dong will be great.

600
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:12,678
So, this is how it is?

601
00:47:12,678 --> 00:47:16,341
This is how it is.

602
00:47:44,777 --> 00:47:48,008
Chicken and broccoli.

603
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,328
Dude... are you all right?

604
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:38,023
Aye, never better.

605
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,338
Fish Halman here, bringing you breaking,

606
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:48,908
on-the-scenes coverage of
an explosion of mayhem,

607
00:48:48,908 --> 00:48:52,344
murder and lewd behavior that has swept
the Long Beach area this morning.

608
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:55,181
Our viewers may remember
a similar series of incidents

609
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:59,885
which took place some three months back
involving this unidentified man.

610
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:01,587
Police are now confirming that today's

611
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:05,624
lurid events are the work of
that very same psychotic deviant.

612
00:49:05,624 --> 00:49:08,861
Ted Garcia's standing by
in Hollywood Park with a live report.

613
00:49:08,861 --> 00:49:09,929
Take it away, Ted.

614
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:10,863
Thanks, Fish.

615
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:13,332
I'm standing here with a
group of people -- families,

616
00:49:13,332 --> 00:49:15,701
seniors and degenerate gamblers --

617
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:17,236
that are shocked and traumatized

618
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:19,205
by what they've witnessed here today

619
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:20,840
when what started as a sunny,

620
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,809
southern California afternoon
at the races turned,

621
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:27,646
without warning, into a public,
open air porno.

622
00:49:27,646 --> 00:49:29,548
Did you say ''porno,'' Ted?

623
00:49:29,548 --> 00:49:31,450
Straight up, Fish.
I'd like you to meet...

624
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,519
...Glenda Lansing of Hawaiian Gardens.

625
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,156
Glenda says she had an all-too
up-close-and-personal encounter

626
00:49:37,156 --> 00:49:41,160
with the suspect just moments before
the shocking incident occurred.

627
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,663
That bastard had his filthy
hands all over me.

628
00:49:44,663 --> 00:49:46,799
Could you describe exactly what happened?

629
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:50,369
I never saw a bastard wanted it so bad.

630
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:54,306
He put his filthy hands on
every part of me.

631
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:57,009
Okay, that's a little too much
information for this broadcast, Glenda.

632
00:49:57,009 --> 00:49:59,078
Can you describe the man
that assaulted you?

633
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:02,047
He looked like that fella
from the movies.

634
00:50:02,481 --> 00:50:03,749
The teabag.

635
00:50:03,749 --> 00:50:04,717
Teabag?

636
00:50:04,717 --> 00:50:08,587
You know, the trainspotted fella?

637
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:10,956
Built like a-a brick shithouse.

638
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:14,393
AII right, ma'am, you know that kind of
language is not gonna fly on TV.

639
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:16,829
Well, that son of a bitch.

640
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:20,196
He treated me like his hot little whore.

641
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:28,503
Explain to me again how you let
this motherfucker get away.

642
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:33,112
He just uh went buck wild
and killed everybody.

643
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:34,875
But not you.

644
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:36,715
Just got lucky, EI.

645
00:50:36,715 --> 00:50:39,479
The three of us work the Puerto way!

646
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:42,353
You know the drill, bitch.

647
00:50:50,596 --> 00:50:52,188
Do it.

648
00:50:59,438 --> 00:50:59,939
Andale!

649
00:50:59,939 --> 00:51:01,372
Do it!

650
00:51:17,656 --> 00:51:20,716
Now the other one.

651
00:51:49,655 --> 00:51:51,924
You bought yourself another chance.

652
00:51:51,924 --> 00:51:54,760
I don't think you'll fuck
it up next time.

653
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:01,029
Now... go get yourself a Band-Aid...
and go get me fucking Chelios, cabron!

654
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:20,085
That's the last time.

655
00:52:20,085 --> 00:52:21,987
The last time that son of
a bitch leaves me

656
00:52:21,987 --> 00:52:25,616
with my ass in the wind in front of
eight thousand people!

657
00:52:28,027 --> 00:52:28,894
W-W-Wait, Lemon!

658
00:52:28,894 --> 00:52:30,062
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey! It's me.

659
00:52:30,062 --> 00:52:30,763
Randy. Hi.

660
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:31,797
What the hell are you doing here?

661
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:33,299
Look, it's about the dude.

662
00:52:33,299 --> 00:52:34,300
What dude?

663
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,401
The asshole.

664
00:52:35,401 --> 00:52:36,001
What about him?

665
00:52:36,001 --> 00:52:36,969
He's on every channel.

666
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:39,571
The guy's a fuckin' psycho killer, baby!

667
00:52:39,571 --> 00:52:41,273
Every cop in the city's lookin' for him.

668
00:52:41,273 --> 00:52:44,677
Not to mention the fuckin' beaners
and the fuckin' Orientals.

669
00:52:44,677 --> 00:52:45,244
So?

670
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:46,912
So? So?

671
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:50,049
So the heat's on the street and that
dude's playin' for keeps, baby.

672
00:52:50,049 --> 00:52:52,284
I have no idea what the hell
you just said.

673
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:53,585
Look, Lemon-Lemon-Lemon, look.

674
00:52:53,585 --> 00:52:54,286
What?

675
00:52:54,286 --> 00:52:57,722
I know we've all been down our dark
roads in the past, okay, babe?

676
00:52:58,991 --> 00:53:02,594
I need my hair did, my nails did,
you ain't gave me no money.

677
00:53:02,594 --> 00:53:04,496
Where's you been at, Randy?

678
00:53:04,496 --> 00:53:06,765
If I ever catch you with another bitch--

679
00:53:06,765 --> 00:53:09,632
Well, you do got a big-ass dick
for a white boy.

680
00:53:11,937 --> 00:53:13,005
Anyway, look.

681
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:15,274
The point is...you're my lady now.

682
00:53:15,274 --> 00:53:15,841
AII right?

683
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:17,943
And I don't think it's really safe
for you to be out there with

684
00:53:17,943 --> 00:53:21,572
that-that sick fucker running
wild right now.

685
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:23,015
You can say that again.

686
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:24,817
Look, look-look-look, hey-hey,
listen to me.

687
00:53:24,817 --> 00:53:25,818
Listen to me.
Here's what I think we should do.

688
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:27,052
What Randy?

689
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:27,619
AII right.

690
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:28,954
I say we go to the fuzz.

691
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:29,288
AII right?

692
00:53:29,288 --> 00:53:31,156
We tell 'em everything we know.
We come clean.

693
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:31,623
What?

694
00:53:31,623 --> 00:53:32,992
Yeah, the fuzz, all right?

695
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:34,460
I mean, I'd kill this guy myself,

696
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,996
but I got two strikes against me.

697
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:37,963
Let go of me.

698
00:53:37,963 --> 00:53:38,797
Look, baby.

699
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:42,101
AII right, I'm tryin' to be cool to you,
but I will drop the hammer.

700
00:53:42,101 --> 00:53:43,932
You want me to drop the hammer, baby?

701
00:53:52,077 --> 00:53:54,443
I'm in no mood today, Randy!

702
00:53:58,984 --> 00:54:01,418
Lemon! Lemon!

703
00:54:12,898 --> 00:54:15,366
Freeze! Hey!

704
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:19,893
Now spread it! Come on, let's go.

705
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:24,905
Against the car.

706
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:49,398
Si.

707
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:53,231
Don't leave no skid marks, nigga!

708
00:54:54,506 --> 00:54:56,642
Ride that shit, Big Betsy.

709
00:54:56,642 --> 00:54:58,210
Throw your arm up, son, like...

710
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,312
Eight seconds, nigger. Yeah!

711
00:55:00,312 --> 00:55:02,214
Oh, my God.

712
00:55:02,214 --> 00:55:03,148
Hello.

713
00:55:03,148 --> 00:55:03,916
Orlando.

714
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:06,752
Venus! What is up, my man?

715
00:55:06,752 --> 00:55:07,519
Where you been, man?

716
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,088
I ain't seen your ass since--

717
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:11,356
Hey, by the way, man,
we was all of us broken up about

718
00:55:11,356 --> 00:55:12,357
what happened to your brother, man.

719
00:55:12,357 --> 00:55:12,958
You okay?

720
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:14,126
Orlando, I need your help.

721
00:55:14,126 --> 00:55:14,927
Venus, come on.

722
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:16,462
You know you my nigger, you can't
get no bigger. L.A. underground,

723
00:55:16,462 --> 00:55:18,497
we're like a family, man. You--

724
00:55:18,497 --> 00:55:19,531
That's it, baby.

725
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:21,633
We be a-be a freak-ass family,
but we be family, all right?

726
00:55:21,633 --> 00:55:23,202
We look out for our own. What you need?

727
00:55:23,202 --> 00:55:25,693
I'm looking for a man called The Ferret.

728
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:27,236
EI Huron.

729
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,840
Aw, shit.

730
00:55:30,275 --> 00:55:31,833
Ferret?

731
00:55:36,148 --> 00:55:40,175
Hey. Oh. Oh, great.

732
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:45,657
We gotta keep him hydrated.

733
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:46,925
Step on it! Fuck!

734
00:55:46,925 --> 00:55:48,517
Hold it in-Hold it in!

735
00:55:50,596 --> 00:55:51,927
Fuck.

736
00:55:51,997 --> 00:55:54,522
This is an ambulance you fuckhead!

737
00:55:56,568 --> 00:55:58,170
Hey, we got to drain those organs!

738
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,171
Hold it in!

739
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:00,873
Jesus! What the fuck are you doin'?

740
00:56:00,873 --> 00:56:01,974
This is an ambulance!

741
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:02,808
That's right, motherfucker.

742
00:56:02,808 --> 00:56:03,876
I'm aware of that.

743
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:05,777
'Cause I'm in need of emergency services.

744
00:56:05,777 --> 00:56:08,647
Yeah, uh we have got a guy in the back
of the fuckin' ambulance!

745
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:09,848
Get him out of here, man!

746
00:56:09,848 --> 00:56:11,650
That's one of Don Kim's blokes.

747
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,819
This man is in critical condition!
Get the fuck out of here!

748
00:56:13,819 --> 00:56:14,987
Yes, I'm aware of that.

749
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:16,788
I'm the fucker that put him there.

750
00:56:16,788 --> 00:56:17,756
Now...

751
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:19,825
Okay. He's got a gun!

752
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:20,792
According to my physician...

753
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:21,260
Okay.

754
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,263
I'm in need of an external
lithium battery belt...

755
00:56:24,263 --> 00:56:27,666
for an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

756
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:28,901
Might you have such a thing?

757
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:30,035
We're gonna lose him, Brock.

758
00:56:30,035 --> 00:56:32,671
Uh, please, look, this guy's
fuckin' dying.

759
00:56:32,671 --> 00:56:36,008
Don't worry about him.
He's not gonna make it.

760
00:56:36,008 --> 00:56:37,776
Now, about my battery...

761
00:56:37,776 --> 00:56:42,577
Yeah, the, uh-the, uh, you said the
Avicor T.A.H. Yeah, we got it, but why?

762
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:48,387
Holy... shit!

763
00:56:48,387 --> 00:56:49,021
Chop-chop.

764
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:50,113
Okay.

765
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,926
Oh, fu--

766
00:56:53,926 --> 00:56:56,228
He's...fucking dead, man!

767
00:56:56,228 --> 00:56:57,889
Do you mind?

768
00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:05,237
You ready for this shit?

769
00:57:05,237 --> 00:57:06,104
Do it then.

770
00:57:06,104 --> 00:57:06,471
Damn.

771
00:57:06,471 --> 00:57:08,063
Turn the fuckin' thing on.

772
00:57:13,779 --> 00:57:16,839
Feels like, uh...crack.

773
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:18,450
Yeah... but better.

774
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:21,353
You know, those things aren't designed
for strenuous activity.

775
00:57:21,353 --> 00:57:23,287
Tell me about it.

776
00:57:29,361 --> 00:57:30,095
Stop the fucking ambulance!

777
00:57:30,095 --> 00:57:32,431
No, dude, you got to go to the hospital.

778
00:57:32,431 --> 00:57:33,762
Fuck it.

779
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:46,704
Bing fucking Crosby.

780
00:57:49,915 --> 00:57:51,049
Breathe out.

781
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:53,118
Raise your buttocks upward by first
walking up the board slightly...

782
00:57:53,118 --> 00:57:54,753
Come on, down that doggie.

783
00:57:54,753 --> 00:57:56,755
...then straightening your legs.

784
00:57:56,755 --> 00:57:57,889
Feel that great--
Down, dog-- Hello.

785
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:59,224
Doc, I'm close.

786
00:57:59,224 --> 00:58:00,993
So am I. Chev can this wait a second?

787
00:58:00,993 --> 00:58:02,961
I think I've found that motherfucker
that's got my organ.

788
00:58:02,961 --> 00:58:04,029
Wait!

789
00:58:04,029 --> 00:58:04,529
Hey!

790
00:58:04,529 --> 00:58:07,833
I think I got the skinny on that Triad
geezer from my girls on the streets, Chev.

791
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:08,800
Old news, Doc.

792
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,202
I'll get back to you
when I have the tart.

793
00:58:10,202 --> 00:58:11,692
Chevy, wait!

794
00:58:19,311 --> 00:58:21,142
Chev Cherios!

795
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:36,057
Fuckin' clowns.

796
00:59:03,822 --> 00:59:05,221
Goddamn it.

797
00:59:07,826 --> 00:59:12,564
It's completely normal to be freaked out
when someone has a gun at your head.

798
00:59:12,564 --> 00:59:14,433
I would’ve shit myself.

799
00:59:14,433 --> 00:59:15,500
I still have nightmares.

800
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,402
Everybody has nightmares.

801
00:59:17,402 --> 00:59:20,572
The point is by coming here
and talking with me

802
00:59:20,572 --> 00:59:24,109
you made a choice to confront
your issues and lick 'em.

803
00:59:24,109 --> 00:59:27,145
I can't even leave my fucking apartment.

804
00:59:27,145 --> 00:59:31,616
I ca--I-- Every time I go up to...leave
the door, I-I see the guy with the gun.

805
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:33,285
I'm having a really bad day.

806
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:34,119
Oh, shit!

807
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:36,610
Tell me you've got epinephrine
on this fuckin' cart.

808
00:59:37,089 --> 00:59:39,291
Think about it like this, Ankleson.

809
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:43,061
Today is the first day of the
rest of your life.

810
00:59:43,061 --> 00:59:45,397
You got to go out and enjoy it.

811
00:59:45,397 --> 00:59:49,201
Knock back a couple of beers...
hit a titty bar.

812
00:59:49,201 --> 00:59:50,535
Uh...excuse me?

813
00:59:50,535 --> 00:59:53,538
Have. some smelly snatch rubbed
in your face.

814
00:59:53,538 --> 00:59:55,140
You got to get out there, man.

815
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,576
Yeah. I'm gonna do it.

816
00:59:57,576 --> 00:59:59,511
I'm gonna go out there and
tackle the world.

817
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:01,413
No, don't tackle the world.

818
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:03,348
Tackle a fuckin' whore.

819
01:00:03,348 --> 01:00:04,549
Get your dick wet. Yeah.

820
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:07,519
Dip your wick into life a little bit.

821
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:08,754
Have some fun.

822
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:10,085
Yeah.

823
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:13,125
I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna
floss my teeth with some pubes.

824
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:14,793
Oh... now you're on it.

825
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:15,827
Thanks, doctor.

826
01:00:15,827 --> 01:00:17,295
Oh, my pleasure.

827
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:20,899
No, no, no, the pleasure’s all mine.

828
01:00:20,899 --> 01:00:25,097
I'm done with fear. My life begins today.

829
01:00:35,914 --> 01:00:37,211
Fuck!

830
01:01:29,768 --> 01:01:31,429
Whoo!

831
01:01:32,804 --> 01:01:34,203
Whoo!

832
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:07,262
Maybe we better call nine-one-one.

833
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,633
Where's my box?

834
01:03:18,944 --> 01:03:20,844
No!

835
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:29,451
No!

836
01:03:35,493 --> 01:03:39,297
Five more like that...and your brains
will be strawberry jelly.

837
01:03:39,297 --> 01:03:42,067
You can't look in that box!

838
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:45,170
The key and the fuckin' combo.

839
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:46,738
No!

840
01:03:46,738 --> 01:03:48,433
Do it.

841
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:58,848
That's better.

842
01:04:07,225 --> 01:04:09,887
This isn't my fuckin' pumper!

843
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:16,401
What the-- What is that? What kind of
sick freak carries

844
01:04:16,401 --> 01:04:19,097
something like this around in a box?

845
01:04:21,339 --> 01:04:23,708
I am shocked to my fucking core.

846
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:26,404
You've got some deep problems,
motherfucker.

847
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:32,049
What the fuck is that?

848
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:45,964
That one I sort of know and it's fuckin'
got to come back and fuckin' r-run it--

849
01:04:45,964 --> 01:04:47,732
What the fuck is this?

850
01:04:47,732 --> 01:04:50,030
What the fuck is tha--

851
01:04:51,069 --> 01:04:51,870
Hello.

852
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:52,637
Doc.

853
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:53,471
Chevy.

854
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:56,074
When you hung up on me, I was trying to
fuckin' tell you something.

855
01:04:56,074 --> 01:05:00,011
Your heart was transplanted three weeks
ago into that Shaolin motherfucker.

856
01:05:00,011 --> 01:05:02,213
Fucking great. Now what?

857
01:05:02,213 --> 01:05:03,114
I'm on it.

858
01:05:03,114 --> 01:05:04,949
Poon Dong is still in L.A.

859
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:07,619
And if I'm right he's got what you
need in pristine working

860
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,921
condition beating inside his chest.

861
01:05:09,921 --> 01:05:10,455
Good.

862
01:05:10,455 --> 01:05:11,456
Where do I find him?

863
01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:12,657
Don't worry about it.

864
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:14,318
I got people on the street.

865
01:05:29,874 --> 01:05:32,707
Good luck with that, Doc.
I'll try it my way.

866
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:37,038
Come here, you. Up you get.

867
01:05:37,982 --> 01:05:42,009
Okay, darling. One last dance.

868
01:05:42,253 --> 01:05:44,118
Where's the fuckin' old man?

869
01:05:58,236 --> 01:05:59,897
What old man?

870
01:06:07,045 --> 01:06:11,505
Hey! Hey I-I got five dollars says
you’ll blow me for twenty bucks.

871
01:06:18,556 --> 01:06:20,825
Oh. Oh, stop. Stop right here.

872
01:06:20,825 --> 01:06:23,555
Stop right here. Hey, baby.

873
01:06:23,728 --> 01:06:25,130
Hey. Oh. Hiya.

874
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,332
Hey, baby. How you doin'?

875
01:06:27,332 --> 01:06:28,733
I'm doin' okay, baby.

876
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:29,434
Oh, yeah?

877
01:06:29,434 --> 01:06:30,201
How you doin'?

878
01:06:30,201 --> 01:06:31,896
What you need?

879
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:35,536
You know what I need.

880
01:06:36,274 --> 01:06:37,308
Let's take a walk.

881
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:38,775
Come on, Daddy.

882
01:06:44,949 --> 01:06:46,610
Fuck you, Chelios.

883
01:06:49,187 --> 01:06:50,355
Fuck you, Chelios!

884
01:06:50,355 --> 01:06:51,723
Hey, fuck you, Chelios!

885
01:06:51,723 --> 01:06:53,291
fuck you Chelios

886
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:54,759
Fucking fuck your balls, Chelios.

887
01:06:54,759 --> 01:06:56,594
Hey, yo, Chelios. Fuck you.

888
01:06:56,594 --> 01:06:57,796
fuck off Chelios

889
01:06:57,796 --> 01:07:02,426
Fuck...off...Cheli-fucking-os!

890
01:07:06,504 --> 01:07:09,240
Tell me what he's like when he's at home.

891
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,709
When he's home? He's like a ghost.

892
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:13,444
He just plays those video games...

893
01:07:13,444 --> 01:07:15,446
...all day, all night.

894
01:07:15,446 --> 01:07:16,514
Video games

895
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:17,282
AII day.

896
01:07:17,282 --> 01:07:18,950
And you let him do that.

897
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:19,684
Oh.

898
01:07:19,684 --> 01:07:23,721
Well, I mean, you did buy the games
for him, yeah?

899
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:27,258
Of course. Why should I deny my son?

900
01:07:27,258 --> 01:07:28,593
How are you today, Chev?

901
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:30,261
I'm golden, sir.

902
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:34,165
Your mum tells me that you've been
getting into quite a bit of trouble.

903
01:07:34,165 --> 01:07:35,166
Is that true?

904
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:38,169
Yes, sir. Regretfully, that's true.

905
01:07:38,169 --> 01:07:40,038
What kind of trouble?

906
01:07:40,038 --> 01:07:44,209
Fighting...talking back...pinching.

907
01:07:44,209 --> 01:07:45,543
Pinching what?

908
01:07:45,543 --> 01:07:49,914
Televisions, stereo components,
books from the library.

909
01:07:49,914 --> 01:07:51,216
That's not all.

910
01:07:51,216 --> 01:07:51,950
No, sir.

911
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:54,319
Also, a till from a restaurant.

912
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:55,320
And one car.

913
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,588
A toy car?

914
01:07:56,588 --> 01:08:00,024
No, sir. A BMW Zed One.

915
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:02,393
Don't you--

916
01:08:02,393 --> 01:08:03,361
Chev, sit. Sit down.

917
01:08:03,361 --> 01:08:04,128
People.

918
01:08:04,128 --> 01:08:05,096
People. AII right.

919
01:08:05,096 --> 01:08:08,657
I hear you've been having quite a bit
of trouble at school, too.

920
01:08:13,705 --> 01:08:15,002
Chelios!

921
01:08:21,145 --> 01:08:23,514
Nothing I can't handle, sir.

922
01:08:23,514 --> 01:08:25,049
I have a lot of piss and vinegar.

923
01:08:25,049 --> 01:08:26,184
He's hyperactive.

924
01:08:26,184 --> 01:08:27,252
Oh, shite, Mom!

925
01:08:27,252 --> 01:08:29,554
Hey! You want to watch your dirty
little mouth, son.

926
01:08:29,554 --> 01:08:31,356
We tried givin' him Ritalin, but...

927
01:08:31,356 --> 01:08:32,690
Chev?

928
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,992
I sold it.

929
01:08:33,992 --> 01:08:36,728
With all this energy, uh,
you've never thought about,

930
01:08:36,728 --> 01:08:39,128
I don't know, tryin' out for sports?

931
01:08:51,876 --> 01:08:52,911
I like to run.

932
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:53,678
Chev.

933
01:08:53,678 --> 01:08:55,313
Where's Dad?

934
01:08:55,313 --> 01:08:57,115
I never met the wanker.

935
01:08:57,115 --> 01:08:58,883
He died before I was born.

936
01:08:58,883 --> 01:09:03,554
What do you think he'd say if he saw
you acting out like this?

937
01:09:03,554 --> 01:09:04,722
Don't know, sir.

938
01:09:04,722 --> 01:09:08,259
If he were here now...
and he asked you...

939
01:09:08,259 --> 01:09:11,462
''Why the bloody hell do you do
the things you do, son?''

940
01:09:11,462 --> 01:09:12,330
what would you tell him?

941
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:15,466
Don't know, sir. Bored, I guess.

942
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:17,001
Bored, he guesses.

943
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:17,902
Bored?

944
01:09:17,902 --> 01:09:18,603
Bored?

945
01:09:18,603 --> 01:09:19,170
Shut up.

946
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:22,674
We're gonna take a short break now
but when we return...

947
01:09:22,674 --> 01:09:29,238
we are gonna find out what makes
you tick little man.

948
01:10:02,747 --> 01:10:05,910
Hey. You okay? Wake up.

949
01:10:07,085 --> 01:10:08,677
Wake up.

950
01:10:26,204 --> 01:10:28,506
Ria, baby.

951
01:10:28,506 --> 01:10:30,497
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What happened to you?

952
01:10:34,912 --> 01:10:36,280
Wh-What are you doin' out here?

953
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,408
Oh. Trying to get my boyfriend.

954
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,921
What are you out here for?

955
01:10:45,256 --> 01:10:48,089
Uh, I'm looking for the man
that killed my brother.

956
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,058
Yeah.

957
01:11:05,109 --> 01:11:09,136
I have to go. I might not come back.

958
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:11,816
Give all the girls kisses
and hugs for me, okay?

959
01:11:11,816 --> 01:11:13,818
I kiss and hug all the pussy.

960
01:11:13,818 --> 01:11:16,048
You go kill cocksucker.

961
01:11:30,234 --> 01:11:31,903
Some boyfriend you got there, Miss Lydon.

962
01:11:31,903 --> 01:11:34,439
He lied to you for what, six months,
regarding his line of work,

963
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:39,035
which I guess wouldn’t be such a big
deal if he wasn't a hired killer!

964
01:11:39,277 --> 01:11:43,381
He made you a target for the South
American mob for kidnapping, torture,

965
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:47,485
or worse sexually humiliated you
in front of-- what?

966
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:50,921
I don't know-- half of Los Angeles, twice.

967
01:11:51,155 --> 01:11:52,190
Twice!

968
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:54,559
And then left you there to take the rap.

969
01:11:54,559 --> 01:11:57,228
And now you can add an arrest
and a police record to

970
01:11:57,228 --> 01:12:01,028
the list of wonderful things Mr. Chelios
has brought to your life.

971
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,724
Help me out here, sweetheart, okay?

972
01:12:04,268 --> 01:12:08,364
'Cause, uh... 'cause I'm a
little bit confused.

973
01:12:09,273 --> 01:12:15,371
Why the fuck... do you continue to
protect this asshole?

974
01:12:17,281 --> 01:12:19,772
That's a dicky question.

975
01:12:21,085 --> 01:12:24,111
Besides, I don't know
who you're talking about.

976
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:28,693
I mean... I'd like to see you fall out
of a helicopter and live.

977
01:12:28,693 --> 01:12:29,794
What?

978
01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:31,284
Hm?

979
01:12:46,444 --> 01:12:48,079
It looks like you made bail.

980
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:49,914
Great. Can I have my stuff back?

981
01:12:49,914 --> 01:12:53,518
Yeah. Yeah, just, uh, just one
little piece of advice.

982
01:12:53,518 --> 01:12:58,319
Wake the fuck up...and smell
what's burning.

983
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,301
Hola, Chev.

984
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:55,746
I take it you're the greasy fucker that's
been huntin' me all day.

985
01:13:55,746 --> 01:13:57,081
The Ferret.

986
01:13:57,081 --> 01:13:59,417
Some people know me by this fucking name.

987
01:13:59,417 --> 01:14:03,955
And many men have died cursing
the name of EI Huron...

988
01:14:03,955 --> 01:14:07,358
as they choked on their own blood
and the blood of their families.

989
01:14:07,358 --> 01:14:08,426
Colorful geezer.

990
01:14:08,426 --> 01:14:15,855
I was born with another name...
the name of my father.

991
01:14:18,169 --> 01:14:21,332
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah, fuckin' hell.

992
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:25,009
And my father's father's.

993
01:14:25,009 --> 01:14:26,744
We're all very sad.

994
01:14:26,744 --> 01:14:33,843
And the name...that I share...
with my two brothers...

995
01:14:34,185 --> 01:14:36,278
Alejandro...

996
01:14:40,224 --> 01:14:42,021
...and Ricardo.

997
01:14:47,999 --> 01:14:49,626
Verona.

998
01:14:52,303 --> 01:14:56,240
Well, I-I can tell...
by the tick-tick-tick...

999
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,776
that you had no idea...

1000
01:14:58,776 --> 01:15:01,145
that there was a third brother.

1001
01:15:01,145 --> 01:15:02,380
Nope.

1002
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:06,083
That fact escaped me...
or I assure you, Elvis,

1003
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:08,219
I would have made it a fucking hat trick.

1004
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:11,055
I got a trick-or-treat for you cabron.

1005
01:15:11,055 --> 01:15:14,859
I'm gonna make you wish...
that you was never a man.

1006
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:16,994
If you want to kill what's left of me,
you get on with it.

1007
01:15:16,994 --> 01:15:19,622
What's the rush, Chelios?

1008
01:15:19,864 --> 01:15:23,960
I know someone who's going to
love to watch this.

1009
01:15:54,765 --> 01:15:56,494
You.

1010
01:16:13,984 --> 01:16:14,985
You got the donor?

1011
01:16:14,985 --> 01:16:17,180
Like you got a boner.

1012
01:16:18,756 --> 01:16:20,057
Hey, baby.

1013
01:16:20,057 --> 01:16:22,560
You always say y-you want to
be more spontaneous.

1014
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,562
Uh-uh, cowboy.

1015
01:16:24,562 --> 01:16:25,096
Huh?

1016
01:16:25,096 --> 01:16:26,497
We gonna go back to my place.

1017
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:27,331
Ooh.

1018
01:16:27,331 --> 01:16:27,832
Yeah.

1019
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:29,390
That sounds good.

1020
01:16:30,735 --> 01:16:33,838
Ricardo never wanted my money Chelios.

1021
01:16:33,838 --> 01:16:35,740
He was, uh, too stubborn.

1022
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:38,300
He wanted to make his own way.

1023
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:42,911
But now I think he likes what
my money can buy.

1024
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:46,584
The technology to keep his brain alive.

1025
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:51,214
Not forever but long enough to
watch you die.

1026
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:17,581
Yo, Ferret this ain't Roots, man.

1027
01:17:17,581 --> 01:17:19,383
Que?

1028
01:17:19,383 --> 01:17:20,941
Hey, cabron.

1029
01:17:24,054 --> 01:17:26,357
You got to be fucking kidding me.

1030
01:17:26,357 --> 01:17:28,092
You killed my brother, motherfucker.

1031
01:17:28,092 --> 01:17:29,650
Prepare to die.

1032
01:17:43,674 --> 01:17:45,005
No!

1033
01:18:01,525 --> 01:18:02,992
Fuck you, Chelios!

1034
01:18:26,951 --> 01:18:28,714
Ronnie James Dio!

1035
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:32,278
Chucha madre!

1036
01:19:00,851 --> 01:19:02,716
This way, sugar.

1037
01:19:08,259 --> 01:19:11,626
Confucius say...karma's a bitch.

1038
01:19:14,098 --> 01:19:16,191
Uh-oh.

1039
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:31,072
Hello, Ricky.

1040
01:19:33,183 --> 01:19:35,617
Why do we go on like this, Ricky?

1041
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,785
Hurting each other?

1042
01:19:39,456 --> 01:19:41,185
Water?

1043
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:43,426
Did you say, ''Water''?

1044
01:19:48,999 --> 01:19:52,730
H-two-O coming right up.

1045
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:01,841
Motherfucker!

1046
01:22:13,911 --> 01:22:15,879
Chev Cherios! Che--

1047
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:28,821
Chev Cherios. Chev. Chev.

1048
01:22:30,394 --> 01:22:31,628
Che--

1049
01:22:31,628 --> 01:22:33,186
Che-- Che--

1050
01:24:27,377 --> 01:24:28,867
I'm cuttin' the battery.

1051
01:24:29,112 --> 01:24:30,773
The battery's out.

1052
01:25:11,255 --> 01:25:12,756
Paddies. Give me the paddies.

1053
01:25:12,756 --> 01:25:14,383
What's going on?

1054
01:25:18,195 --> 01:25:18,962
Chevy.

1055
01:25:18,962 --> 01:25:20,122
Clear!

1056
01:25:23,267 --> 01:25:24,256
Fuck!

1057
01:25:27,037 --> 01:25:27,504
Shit!

1058
01:25:27,504 --> 01:25:28,739
No!

1059
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:29,640
God!

1060
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,834
Come here.

1061
01:26:27,297 --> 01:26:29,266
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

1062
01:26:29,266 --> 01:26:30,858
What the fuck?

1063
01:26:31,835 --> 01:26:33,598
Jesus.

1064
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,408
It's so hard to keep a straight face.

1065
01:26:38,408 --> 01:26:39,176
Wait

1066
01:26:39,176 --> 01:26:40,438
Sorry, Chet.

1067
01:27:27,391 --> 01:27:27,858
Come back here.

1068
01:27:27,858 --> 01:27:29,092
Nail the mark.

1069
01:27:29,092 --> 01:27:30,127
AII right, let's go.

1070
01:27:30,127 --> 01:27:31,361
Uh, body parts ready?

1071
01:27:31,361 --> 01:27:32,629
Yes!

1072
01:27:32,629 --> 01:27:33,994
AII right.

1073
01:27:34,297 --> 01:27:35,365
Taping. Here we go.

1074
01:27:35,365 --> 01:27:37,100
And...you set there?

1075
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:38,168
Ready and...

1076
01:27:38,168 --> 01:27:39,829
Action, Mike!

1077
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,964
Andrew!

1078
01:27:55,619 --> 01:27:58,247
Go. Go, Lance. Run, Lance.

1079
01:28:25,715 --> 01:28:26,716
Action, Manning!

1080
01:28:26,716 --> 01:28:29,453
Droppin' loads all over your silly wages!

1081
01:28:29,453 --> 01:28:31,288
You think these muscles are free?

1082
01:28:31,288 --> 01:28:33,523
You think this cock's for free?

1083
01:28:33,523 --> 01:28:36,793
No way! No scabs, no crabs!

1084
01:28:36,793 --> 01:28:41,598
No scabs, no crabs! I'm gonna bang
that bitch in the back!

1085
01:28:41,598 --> 01:28:44,067
I'm gonna bang your prisoner!

1086
01:28:44,067 --> 01:28:47,298
Droppin' loads all over your prisoner!

1087
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:50,307
Okay. Look at Jason and say it.

1088
01:28:50,307 --> 01:28:52,642
Droppin' loads all over your prisoner!

1089
01:28:52,642 --> 01:28:55,612
Droppin' loads all over your silly wages!

1090
01:28:55,612 --> 01:28:59,514
Yeah! Yeah! Fuck you!

1091
01:30:02,312 --> 01:30:04,481
I take it you're the faggot
that's been hunting me all day.

1092
01:30:04,481 --> 01:30:06,283
No-No-No-No. No.

1093
01:30:06,283 --> 01:30:08,051
I take it day. The Faggot.

1094
01:30:08,051 --> 01:30:10,246
The Faggot. Oh, sorry, the Ferret.

1095
01:31:07,711 --> 01:31:10,847
No dough, no blow! No dough, no blow!

1096
01:31:10,847 --> 01:31:13,350
Dicks like this don't come for free!

1097
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:16,019
Huh. Lips like this don't come for free.

1098
01:31:16,019 --> 01:31:17,919
That's what I meant to say.

1099
01:31:18,021 --> 01:31:18,688
I got lost.

1100
01:31:18,688 --> 01:31:21,521
I meant, ''Lips like this don't
come for free.''

1101
01:31:21,858 --> 01:31:22,688
Keep goin'.

1102
01:32:21,217 --> 01:32:24,387
Oo. Oh. Ooh-hoo. Oo.

1103
01:32:24,387 --> 01:32:26,082
Oo, my horse!

1104
01:32:26,923 --> 01:32:28,447
What?

1105
01:32:30,727 --> 01:32:33,457
I never had it that way before.

1106
01:33:24,914 --> 01:33:26,049
Let us kiss for a second.

1107
01:33:26,049 --> 01:33:29,185
Okay. Yeah. Okay-Okay.

1108
01:33:29,185 --> 01:33:30,387
And here we go.

1109
01:33:30,387 --> 01:33:32,150
And action!

1110
01:34:12,662 --> 01:34:16,032
Water.

1111
01:34:16,032 --> 01:34:18,466
Fuck! You need a few mints.

1112
01:35:15,024 --> 01:35:16,192
Holy shit.

1113
01:35:16,192 --> 01:35:17,727
That was unbelievable. Are you okay?

1114
01:35:17,727 --> 01:35:20,897
Yeah. Holy shit! Oh, fuck!

1115
01:35:20,897 --> 01:35:23,024
That was fuckin' cool!

1116
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:24,767
Almost cradled the balls on that.

1117
01:35:24,767 --> 01:35:26,536
That was fuckin' great!
Look, I'm sure we got it.

1118
01:35:26,536 --> 01:35:27,270
You good?

1119
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,637
Yeah.

1120
01:35:27,637 --> 01:35:28,338
Good job, brother.

1121
01:35:28,338 --> 01:35:28,972
That was so cool.
That was awesome.

1122
01:35:28,972 --> 01:35:29,372
You okay? Holy shit.

1123
01:35:29,372 --> 01:35:30,240
Yeah.

1124
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:30,807
Wow!

1125
01:35:30,807 --> 01:35:32,297
Fuck, that was hot!
