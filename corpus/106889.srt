00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,608
But we all thought...

332
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,611
Nope.

333
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,446
It's gonna be hard to take care of us
if you're dead too.

334
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,711
This?

335
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,589
Won't kill me for years.

336
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,024
Who's gonna take me to school?

337
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,891
I guess I am.

338
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,453
- And make me chicken fingers?
- Me.

339
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,125
- And give me a bath?
- Me.

340
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,295
And check my nose boogies for infections?

341
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,805
We'll find someone else
to do that last thing.

342
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,967
Come here.

343
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,603
All we gotta do is stick together.

344
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,775
Everything's gonna be OK.

345
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:30,150
Thanks for trying, Aunt Helen,
but it's not gonna be OK.

346
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:35,890
Come on, Sarah. It's time for your bath.
Come on, Henry.

347
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,962
Good idea. Great. Uh...

348
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:44,901
You guys do that, while Aunt Helen
is gonna go out and check the lawn.

349
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,766
Is Aunt Helen older than you, Audrey?

350
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,506
<i>(Audrey whispers)</i> Get farther down.

351
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,984
Is she playing hide-and-go-seek?

352
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,317
<i>(Audrey)</i> I don't think so.

353
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,915
<i>(Henry)</i> We are in deep shit.

354
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,425
<i>(Helen)</i> I love New York pizza.

355
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,462
Aunt Helen, can we go to
the Statue of Liberty tomorrow?

356
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,434
No, because we won't be here...

357
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,995
- Where's Henry?
- He said he'd be right back.

358
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,940
I go to the bathroom for five seconds,
and he's gone?

359
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,510
- With mustard. Here it is.
- I didn't want mustard.

360
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,944
- You don't want mustard?
- No.

361
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,448
All right. No mustard.

362
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,644
- There he is.
- Henry!

363
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,746
- OK? Who's gonna pay for this?
- Aunt Helen.

364
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,884
- You can't do that. You can't just leave.
- I hate pizza. I wanted a hot dog.

365
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,224
- Can you pay Aaron, please?
- I'm Aaron.

366
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,732
Hi, Aaron. I like that he's
making new friends. It's lovely.

367
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,164
<i>(Aaron)</i> Talk me up!

368
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,829
The next time you want something
like a hot dog, you tell me, OK?

369
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,667
- And we'll all go together.
- <i>(Henry)</i> OK.

370
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,608
- Where are we going to dinner?
- This is dinner.

371
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,774
<i>(Sarah)</i> Gee, Mommy never
let pizza be our whole dinner.

372
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,873
<i>(Henry)</i> And Dad always said
not to eat and walk at the same time.

373
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,943
<i>(Audrey)</i> Well, they're not here
to yell at us, so it doesn't matter.

374
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,488
<i>(Henry)</i> How many beds do you have
in your apartment, Aunt Helen?

375
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,320
- <i>(Sarah) Aunt Helen!</i>
- <i>(Helen laughs)</i>

376
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,691
- Audrey, your knee.
- Stop!

377
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,630
Hey, guys. Shh!

378
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,627
<i>(lisps)</i> I'm telling you,
if we don't go to sleep right now,

379
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:29,231
Sleepless Sally gets really upset
when the kids aren't going to sleep.

380
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,605
Where's Sarah? Sarah?

381
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,144
I'm right down here.

382
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,612
Henry's feet stink. Phew!

383
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,673
- <i>(Henry)</i> But I'm a man.
- <i>(Audrey)</i> Give Aunt Helen a whiff.

384
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,948
I don't want to smell your feet.

385
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,649
- Ew! I can smell them from here.
- Ew!

386
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,248
Ew!

387
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,088
Henry!

388
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,995
You need to wash your feet
not once a week.

389
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,053
<i>(Henry)</i> Good night, all.

390
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:58,330
Audrey, get out of the bathroom.

391
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,394
Fire! Fire!

392
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,900
- Aunt Helen?
- Hm?

393
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:07,373
Why are we going back? This was great.
We should spend more time here.

394
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,710
- More time?
- Yeah.

395
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,045
We can move here.

396
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,210
We can't sleep every night
in a stinky-feet bed.

397
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,121
We'll move to another apartment.
It's a huge city.

398
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:23,287
You'll be closer to your job and everything.
You love your job.

399
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,522
- What about Henry and Sarah?
- What about them?

400
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:29,294
They've got school. They have friends.
You guys grew up in that neighborhood.

401
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,801
That's why. It's a sad neighborhood now.

402
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,771
Everywhere we go there,
we think of Mom and Dad.

403
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,933
- The kids treat me differently.
- We will discuss this later.

404
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,443
Please think about it, Aunt Helen.

405
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,476
OK, we got a train to catch. Let's go.

406
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,382
Henry, stop brushing your teeth.
They're gonna fall out.

407
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,889
- I can't get Hippo in the bag.
- Oh, give it to me.

408
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,688
OK.

409
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,227
There. He's in the bag.
Are you happy now?

410
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,859
<i>(Helen)</i> Henry!

411
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,404
Now, the only thing to do
would be to tell Aunt Jenny.

412
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,236
Thinking about it, Audrey.
I will think about it.

413
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:15,177
- Tell her we voted.
- I'll think about it, Audrey.

414
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,374
I understand the children's feelings,

415
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,714
- but that's not part of the plan.
- That's <i>your</i> plan, Jenny.

416
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,812
All right, well, what about the idea
of not selling Lindsay's house?

417
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,825
I know you guys offered to pay
the mortgage, but it's enormous.

418
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,385
I spoke to the bank,
and the mortgage is too much for us.

419
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:36,400
All right. Besides being my idea,
what's wrong with moving down the block?

420
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:40,165
I mean, I think
the calm of the familiar is better

421
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,230
than the overwhelming
hustle-bustle of the city.

422
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,742
Guys, can you please keep the coloring
on the eggs and not each other?

423
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,278
Oh, no, no, no. No.

424
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:54,816
Jenny, Sarah thinks that Hippo's parents
are on vacation. That they're coming back.

425
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,982
Henry walks around like a zombie
and draws skeletons.

426
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,821
- Audrey is my only ally.
- You really have to watch her.

427
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,926
Look, they're not happy.
And they've told me themselves.

428
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,462
They're not gonna be happy
anywhere right now.

429
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:11,059
OK, OK. Wait. Wait.
Let us talk for a minute.

430
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,572
Wait till you see what the Easter Bunny
brings. He's gonna bring lots more eggs.

431
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,871
The Easter Bunny's not coming.
The Easter Bunny joined 50 Cent.

432
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:23,313
- <i>(Audrey)</i> Why are you being a brat?
- <i>(Henry)</i> You're a brat.

433
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,612
Helen is right.
A change might do them some good.

434
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,483
And if it doesn't work out,
they can always move back here to Jersey.

435
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,988
<i>(Audrey)</i> Ew, you got some in my hair.

436
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,693
- <i>(Sarah)</i> You know what? You know what?
- <i>(Helen)</i> Oh!

437
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,821
- Oh, no.
- You're not very good at this, Aunt Helen.

438
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,093
- Stop it!
- Irwin's after ya!

439
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:50,233
- Turtles carry... carry diseases.
- Stop it. Sarah, please.

440
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:55,007
We have to find an apartment.
We need to help Aunt Helen.

441
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,476
OK? By being quiet.

442
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,247
<i>(smacks lips noisily)</i>

443
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,182
<i>(clicks tongue)</i>

444
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,264
Stop it.

445
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,737
Stop.

446
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,872
<i>(Helen clicks her pen)</i>

447
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,388
<i>(screams)</i>

448
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:51,033
<i>(Helen)</i> No.

449
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,865
Chelsea. No.

450
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:57,237
You know, I hear there's
some pretty decent stuff in Queens.

451
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:02,302
No. We are not bridge-and-tunnel people.
We are Manhattan people.

452
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,745
<i>(gasps)</i>

453
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,339
Oh, wow.

454
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,353
Four bedrooms. Close to Central Park.
The owner wants it rented quickly,

455
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,584
so he's asking what is very reasonable
for a New York apartment.

456
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,455
Only nine thousand a month.

457
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,690
<i>(# "Whose Life Am I In" by SHeDAIS Y)</i>

458
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,493
<i># I feel like an android living in a Polaroid</i>

459

<i># Whose life am I in?</i>

00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,460
That's the girl looking at 4B.

467
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,962
- One bathroom. That's it?
- Yeah, well,

468
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:04,532
I'll put you on a waiting list if a two opens
up. And look at this - flower power, huh?

469
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,043
So I guess Audrey
can have the back room

470
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:11,549
and Henry and Sarah can share the middle
one and I'll just sleep on a pull-out couch.

471
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,114
Wow, graffiti.

472
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:17,314
Sure, there's plenty of room for a pull-out
couch here. Look, you got a nice view.

473
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:22,485
So, the ad said something about a visual
security system. How does that work?

474
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,757
When somebody buzzes, you stick your
head out the window and you look down.

475
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,024
That's the visual part.

476
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,966
Then you yell for them to come up or not.
That's the security part.

477
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,731
Here's your keys.
Welcome to the Astoria Arms.

478
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:39,141
I am only available between 8:30 and nine
in the morning because I have a life.

479
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,275
So...

480
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,608
home!

481
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,277
<i>(Sarah)</i> Yeah!

482
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,461
<i>(Jenny)</i> I ordered the pizza.
It should be here in 30 minutes.

483
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,055
<i>(Ed)</i> Yay!

484
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,656
Um...

00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,837
Know what, I bet this is lead paint.

486
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,471
Guys. Guys, guys.

487
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,033
Don't chew on the windowsills, all right?

488
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:17,070
Yeah. Stick to the table legs,
like I taught you.

489
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,777
<i>(Ed)</i> OK, come on, guys. Let's go, let's go.
Sometime today. Into the bedroom.

490
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,184
This window is also painted shut.

491
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:27,486
You know, I mean, for 1200 a month,
you'd think you'd have windows that open.

492
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,051
- I want this bed.
- Look, for the tenth time,

493
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:35,793
in the old house I had this bed
and you had that bed.

494
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:40,566
- But I want this bed.
- That's it! Hippo goes out the window.

495
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,698
- Followed by Irwin.
- <i>(Jenny)</i> Guys!

496
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:49,907
Stop fighting. He pinches her all the time,
and hard. It's hard.

497
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,209
<i>(sighs)</i>

498
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,477
Thank you.

499
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:59,346
- So, it's not that bad, right, Jen?
- No.

500
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,587
- Hi.
- I'm Nilma Prasad. I live across the hall.

501
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:10,293
Here's some samosas
that we made for you.

502
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,337
So that would make you my neighbor.
This is my neighbor,

503
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,599
my friendly neighbor, Jenny.
Nilma, I'm Helen.

504
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,365
- No, I'm Nilma.
- I'm Helen. That's Jenny.

505
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,138
I snagged this one in the hallway,
screaming.

506
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,341
- It's OK, Flora. Mr Costello's deaf.
- <i>(Flora)</i> I'm not.

507
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,508
<i>(Nilma speaks Hindi)</i>

508
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,645
So I see you have kids too,
so maybe a play date sometime?

509
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,852
Oh! Oh, my goodness,
that would be wonderful.

510
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,393
Great.

511
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,227
- I'm Jenny, Helen's sister.
- Hello.

512
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:44,359
- Can I ask you a special favor?
- Yes.

513
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,802
- Helen is new at being a mom.
- Uh-oh.

514
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,432
- Exactly.
- These aren't her kids?

515
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,966
- Our sister passed.
- Oh, I'm so sorry. Bless her.

516
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,878
- So, Nilma, if you could from time to time...
- Oh, absolutely.

517
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,383
- And if they...
- Which they will, no?

518
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,510
- You could...
- No problem.

519
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,953
- That's all I'm asking.
- OK, say no more, please.

520
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,117
- Thank you so much.
- OK, no problem.

521
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,594
- Just mommy talk.
- Oh, right.

522
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:17,863
So, Helen, where have you decided
to send the kids to school?

523
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,698
Got it covered.

524
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:31,041
It's just middle school
and you'll both have to be separated,

525
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,673
- all three of you.
- <i>(Sarah)</i> No.

526
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,274
I vote against separation.

527
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:39,415
You know, maybe we should find a school
with less policemen everywhere.

528
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,584
Audrey. Hi. Let's go.

529
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,128
Come on, guys.
This cab's gonna be about $100.

530
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:49,724
- <i>(boy)</i> That girl is fine.
- Hi. Yeah, she's pretty.

531
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:54,932
Nice, Audrey.
Thanks for making my life a lot easier.

532
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,771
<i>(Audrey)</i> I don't like school, anyway.

533
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,542
I mean, I'll just drop out and get a job.

534
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,550
<i>(Sarah)</i> I like school.
I wanna go to school. I want to.

535
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,745
<i>(Henry)</i> Aunt Helen, you promised
you'd find us a school.

536
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,015
<i>(Helen)</i> Oh, God, help me.

537
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,955
<i>(church bell)</i>

538
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,095
Slow down. Stop.

539
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:24,361
That was fast. Kids.

540
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,764
Lisa, stop dragging your sweater.

I mean, Lutheranism
has been in our family for as long as

557
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,147
Lutheran people have been around.

558
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,782
Being a Lutheran is the greatest.
I mean, right, kids?

559
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,787
Hippo wants to be a Lutheran, too.

560
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,482
Hippo <i>is</i> a Lutheran.

561
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:59,694
I knew that God told us to move here
so that we could attend your fine school.

562
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:04,234
A good, solid education
taught our Lutheran way is the best way.

563
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,760
- I mean, isn't that right, Father?
- Pastor.

564
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,831
- Father Pastor.
- Pastor Parker.

565
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,739
Right.

566
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,311
Thank you for that fine testimonial.

567
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,871
Hallelujah.

568
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,382
Hallelujah.

569
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:26,583
Well. I'm just gonna need the kids'
transcripts and blood tests and they're in.

570
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,683
- Blood tests?
- Make sure they're really Lutheran.

571
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,856
You'd be surprised
how many non-Lutherans try to sneak in.

572
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,731
I'm sure. Um, problem.

573
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,738
They're all hemophiliacs.

574
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,274
All three of them. Can't take blood.

575
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,311
- Shh. They're sensitive.
- It's a joke.

576
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,438
Why would I joke about hemophilia?

577
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,609
There's no blood test. That's the joke.

578
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,651
Oh.

579
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,812
You don't have to be Lutheran to go here.
It's Queens.

580
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,220
There's, like, 50 Lutheran kids
in the whole neighborhood.

581
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,821
Shall we take a look around?

582
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,158
So we have space available.
Can you handle the tuition?

583
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,287
- <i>(Helen)</i> Not a problem.
- <i>(Sarah)</i> Tetherball!

584
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,265
Oh, yay!

585
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,528
Henry, we have basketball courts,
gym down there.

586
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,230
- Saint Barbara's believes in basketball.
- Oh.

587
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,398
So what's the Lutheran take
on the afterlife?

588
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,932
Pretty much the standard
heaven, hell, purgatory thing?

589
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,675
- Pretty much. Old school around here.
- You wanna go see the basketball courts?

590
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,310
- No, I'm gonna go play tetherball.
- OK. Play hard.

591
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,785
OK.

592
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,118

593
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,623
Hello.

594
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,689
Excuse me.

595
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,588
Mrs Fricker, I know what you got there.

596
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:43,498
- I made you some special brownies.
- Wow. You, uh... I'm gonna...

597
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,100
- He gets a lot of brownies.
- I see that.

598
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,140
Mm. Better than last time.

599
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,834
- Hi, I'm Phyllis Shore.
- Helen Harris.

600
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,071
- This is my daughter Lisa.
- Hi, Lisa.

601
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,912
- Will you be joining us at Saint Barbara's?
- I hope so.

602
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,713
- Thank you. I'll see you Sunday.
- OK. Bye-bye.

603
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,311
- See you Sunday night at vespers.
- See you at vespers.

604
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,948
See you at vespers.

605
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,686
You know what vespers is?

606
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,821
Some kind of scooter?

607
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,229
Close enough.

608
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,304
<i>(Helen)</i> We got ten minutes. You don't
want to be late for your first day of school.

610
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,407

- <i>(Audrey)</i> I'm not in there.

611
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,273
<i>(tearfully)</i> Can't do it.

613
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:42,215
- I don't remember how.
- What's the matter?

614
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:47,060
- Your shoes? Here, let me help you.
- No! No!

615
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,430
Sarah, sweetheart,
we have to go to school.

616
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:55,837
- OK? Let me help you.
- No! That's not how. You don't know how.

617
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:01,640
Sweetheart, are you nervous about today?
I mean, it's a big day at school.

618
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:06,740
Mom was teaching her
how to tie her shoelaces just before.

619
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,149
Oh.

620
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,451
Right.

621
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:16,687
And I guess she had
a special way of tying them.

622
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:20,754
Well, your mom and I
were probably taught the same way.

623
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,633
Let me think. Something about...

624
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,670
Bunnies.

625
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,066
Bunnies.

626
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,198
Right.

627
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,799
Bunny ears.

628
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,637
You make two bunny ears,

629
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,807
bunny goes around the tree,

630
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,145
into the burrow,

631
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,955
pull tight.

632
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,821
Yeah. Yeah.

633
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,027
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- When will you be home from work?

634
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,934
By dinnertime. Audrey's in charge, though,
so listen to her, OK?

635
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,336
I don't wanna listen to her.

636
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,169
- Pastor Dan.
- Pastor Dan.

637
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,267
- Well, it's the four Lutherans.
- Here we are.

638
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,209
Here you are.

639
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,974
Pastor Wells, would you please show
Henry and Audrey to the home room?

640
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,606
Sure.

641
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,741
- Hello, Audrey.
- Bye.

642
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,651
- Bye. Pay attention! Sit up straight!
- Good morning.

643
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,916
Wait, what about lunch?

644
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,584
- Eat it, it's healthy.
- I meant, we don't have any.

645
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,728
Oh! Right. I'll take care of it.

646
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,521
Bye.

647
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,661
- Can you break a 20?
- Always got change in the collection plate.

648
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,500
- And kindergarten?
- Right over here.

649
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,701
Oh, wow, look.
It's a juggling pastor, Sarah.

650

- Hello, Sarah.

653
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,177
Look at all this fun stuff.
You've got markers and crayons,

coloring books, and all the nice people.
Hi. You're gonna have such a good time.

655
00:39:54,425 --> 00:40:00,489
<i>(Mrs LaGambina)</i> We were all drawing our
favorite animal. Lily was drawing a cat.

656

Sarah, do you want some crayons?

657
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,831
Oh, no, not those.
Those are the teacher's markers.

658
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:11,307
Better put your sweater on,
it's chilly outside.

659
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,107
OK, that was funny. Sorry, Sarah.

660
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,876
- You could've just told me.
- More fun this way.

661
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,880
- <i>(Mrs LaGambina)</i> Who's this?
- <i>(Sarah)</i> Hippo.

662
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,943
Everybody, meet Hippo.

663
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,223
<i>(Dominique)</i> All right, all right, all right.
Enough. Come on, let's get started.

664
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,886
Hi, Lacey. Hey.

665
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,895
Helen.

666
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,198
- I told you I'd make it back.
- Good. Sit down, sweetie.

667
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,963
- Who's that?
- That's the intern.

668
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:42,028
Move over, intern. Caitlin, move.

669
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,270
OK, good.

670
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:48,573
Now, what about the Armani deal?
Is that gonna be completed in my lifetime?

671
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,513
Tom made it happen this morning,
and you're all set for your trip to Miami.

672
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,642
Good. You're gonna love it there.

673
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:58,085
- Me?
- Well, yes. You're back, I need you.

674
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:04,321
Dominique, I... I can't just pick up
and leave for a week right now.

675
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,719
- Why?
- <i>(whispers)</i> I have...

676
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,526
Oh.

677
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,794
The babies. Oh.

678
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:16,500
All right, who wants to take this mummy's
place on a first-class trip to Miami?

679
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,001
Caitlin. You're on.
Helen will tell you what to bring.

680
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,535
Don't wear any of those
midriff-baring outfits. It's so last year.

681
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,181
And I want my luggage
Federal Expressed ahead of time.

682
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,152
Right, that's it.
Lacey, who am I having lunch with today?

683
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,655
- Was it <i>Vogue,</i> or <i>Elle,</i> or...?
- <i>Vogue</i> at Cipriani.

684
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,748
OK. Good.

685
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,690
Good to have you back, sweetie.

686
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,955
We'll go over everything else
at the fashion show tonight.

687
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,894
Tonight?

688
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,866
Unless, of course, you've got
a Brownie meeting or something.

689
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,232
Oh, no, no, no. I'll be there.

690
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,396
- Good.
- OK.

691
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,779
- <i>Hola!</i>
- <i>(man)</i> Sweetheart, over here.

692
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:02,978
- Hi.
- Who's your date?

693
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,021
- His name is Pâté.
- <i>(man #2)</i> Big smile.

694
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,989
<i>(man over PA) Thank you. Please take</i>
<i>your seats. The show's about to begin.</i>

695
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,754
That's Martina, the supermodel,
sitting next to Dominique.

696
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,294
Who are the ladies on the end?

697
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,490
Those are the agents
we're trying to steal her from.

698
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:18,126
Hello. You have a lovely agency. Yes.

699
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,261
I think we should have lunch.

700
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,567
Take the houselights out and go Cue One.

701
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,475
- Hi, Teddy.
- Hi. Kids, don't touch the runway lights.

702
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,945
Excuse me. Pardon me. Thanks.

703
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,312
- Hey, hi.
- <i>(Audrey)</i> Front row seats!

704
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,476
- <i>(Dominique)</i> What's all this?
- <i>(Henry)</i> There's no room.

705
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,777
<i>(Helen)</i> Can you squash down
just a little bit more?

706
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,980
- Don't these children live in Queens?
- I know.

707
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,047
I know. I couldn't find anybody
to watch them.

708
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,686
But don't worry, you won't even know
they're here. I'm here to work.

709
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,595
This child's wearing pajamas.

710
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,034
<i>(Sarah)</i> Aunt Helen, I'm hungry.

711
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:55,765
- You should've eaten your hamburger.
- It had onions.

712
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,933
OK. Take care of her a sec.
I'll be right back.

713
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,206
- Keep an eye on her.
- You're going?

714
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,446
Keep an eye on Sarah.

715
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,550
Hey, partner.

716
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:20,222
- Working on your lingerie merit badge?
- I'm a buyer from Victoria's Secret.

717
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:24,324
You're with Helen and you should go back
to your seat. Yeah. Go for Teddy.

718
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:30,030
Does my nose boogie look green?

719
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,302
Yes, as a matter of fact, it does.

720
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:37,973
Sort of Prada green.
Not their best collection. Put it back inside.

721
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,780
<i>(# "Fashion" by David Bowie)</i>

722
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:52,160
- Ooh, look, a doggy!
- Yes. Watch the lovely doggy.

723
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,392
Hello, doggy.

724
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,402
- Oh, my...
- Come here, doggy.

725
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,030
<i>(male model)</i> Oh!

726
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,807
Are you all right? Model down.
I repeat, we have a model down.

727
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,440
Oh, no. Sarah, what are you doing?
Are you OK?

728
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:16,414
- <i>(Sarah)</i> What happened?
- Everything's OK.

729
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:36,072
All set. The limo's downstairs.

730
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,803
- Martina. Welcome to our agency.
- Thanks. I'm so excited.

731
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,402
You can be effusive on the way in the limo.
Go on, off you go.

732
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,614
<i>(Helen)</i> So we should be to Coney Island
in about an hour.

733
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,777
<i>(phone rings)</i>

734
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,320
Excuse me. This is Helen.

735
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,915
- Hi, it's Dan.
- Dan. What's wrong?

736
00:44:54,992 --> 00:45:00,760
Nothing is wrong. We just have
a little situation with Sarah down here.

737
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,824
- I think you should come to the school.
- Come there now?

738
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:09,066
It's a little difficult to get to school
right now. I'm working. Is she OK?

739
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,868
Helen.

740
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,467
Give me the phone.

741
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,341
Yeah. Hi.

742
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,846
We'll be right there. OK.

743
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,818
- Are you sure?
- No problem. We have plenty of time.

744
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,711
I know how it is. I have a four-year-old.

745
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,462
Then I couldn't find
the burrow for the bunny.

746
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,657
- I hate it when that happens.
- Me too.

747
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,999
- You guys wanna do my makeup?
- <i>(girls)</i> Yeah.

748
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,403
- Can I be a princess?
- <i>(girl)</i> Yeah. You're pretty.

749
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,270
OK.

750
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,842
Sarah, you don't have to learn
to tie your shoes right now.

751
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,176
When you're ready to tie your shoes,
you will.

752
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:57,084
That's right. Shoe-tying's tough.
Why do you think Jesus wore sandals?

753
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,218
- See ya.
- <i>(Helen)</i> Thanks, Pastor Dan.

754
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:04,658
- Do I look pretty?
- <i>(girls)</i> Yeah.

755
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:08,498
So, you wanna go play?
Everything's gonna be fine.

756
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,193
<i>(girl)</i> A little bit of green up here.

757
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,999
Stop!

758
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,034
Are those permanent?

759
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:26,276
It's OK, it happens to me all the time.
It'll come off in a couple of days.

760
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,721
Sorry, Helen.

761
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,054
It's not working.

762
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,753
I understand.

763
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,163
I'm sorry, Dominique.

764
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,263
Thank you so much for everything.

765
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,972
I'll collect my things.

<i>(canned laughter on TV)</i>

769
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:15,723
Are you all right, Aunt Helen?
You've been watching reruns all day.

770
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,859
Reruns are the culture of the unemployed.

771
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,272
<i>(knock at door)</i>

772
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,067
Hey, I'll get it. I have no life.

<i>(knocking)</i>

774
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,182

It's the Exorcist.

776
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,066
- Hi.
- Hi.

777
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,605
Sorry about Martina.

778
00:47:56,673 --> 00:48:00,541
So I brought you comfort food -
Chunky Monkey.

779
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,542
- Would you like to come in?
- Pastor Dan.

780
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,515
Hey, kids.

781
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,916
How did he get past
the visual security system?

782
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,717
- Who cares? Now we can watch MTV.
- Yeah.

783
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:16,156
It's funny how one moment
I'm living my life

784
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:20,856
not really in touch with the fact that I'm
sharing this planet with permanent pens,

785
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,594
and the next moment
one such pen has made, shall we say,

786
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,159
an indelible impact on my career.

787
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,432
- Hey, Helen.
- A black mark on my record,

788
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,905
X-ed out my future...

789
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,933
- Helen.
...and, in short, my career is dead.

790
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,207
Like your turtle.

791
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,276
- What?
- Turtle's dead.

792
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,876
Oh, no.

793
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,546
Oh, Irwin, no.

794
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,318
May he rest in peace...

795
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:53,522
Shut up. You don't understand.
This is Henry's turtle. It's his friend.

796
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,689
He's...

797
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,029
He can't be dead.

798
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,193
Oh, he's dead.

799
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,904
We need to find a body double now.

800
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,769
Here.

801
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,140
What about the empty bowl?

802
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,375
I'll hide it.

803
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,651
Ki... Kids!

804
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:24,957
We're gonna go get butterscotch
and chocolate syrup for the ice cream.

805
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,963
You stay put and watch television.

806
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:32,297
And don't come in the kitchen,
I just waxed the floors.

807
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,429
- Irwin's long-lost brother.
- Yeah.

808
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,236
Thanks for doing this. You're my savior.

809
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,437
- I mean...
- I know what you mean.

810
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,776
So, how are things going?

811
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:47,078
- Fine.
- Hm?

812
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,880
- Fine.
- Just fine?

813
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,854
- Yeah. What do you mean?
- Well, it's just that

814
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,414
I've noticed Audrey
spending too much time with the boys.

815
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:59,986
You know, that's normal for what she's
going through, to look for that attention,

816
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,623
but some of these kids are not exactly
angels, you know what I mean?

817
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,896
They're 15. It's teenage stuff. It's harmless.

818
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,333
No, it's not really harmless,
cos one of these punks - his name's BZ -

819
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,533
I'm about to kick his butt outta school.

820
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,838
Let's just get upstairs
before Henry finds the bowl.

821
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,778
Yeah, Henry. You said the kid likes
basketball. He never ever picks up a ball.

822
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,078
I know. I've noticed that.

823
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,051
The thing with Sarah and the shoes
the other day, that's not the first time...

824
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,918
Hey, what do you expect, Dan?

825
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:31,518
They've lost their parents, moved to a new
city, changed schools, changed religions.

826
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,759
Well, let's talk about some things
you could do at home.

827
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:38,027
You wanna know
what I've been doing at home?

828
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,695
I've been doing the best I can.

829
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,831
Do you have any idea
what this has done to my life?

830
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:48,537
Hey, Helen, do you have any idea
what it's done to theirs?

831
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:54,744
Hey, Pastor Dan, Mr Self-righteous,
I'm hanging on by a thread here.

832
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:59,551
I lost my sister, my social life,
my disposable income,

833
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:04,150
my ability to fit into a size two
and - this just in - my job.

834
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,663
Pretty much the only two things that
haven't disappeared are my nicotine fits

835
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:11,530
and the few pounds that have recently
taken up residence on my ass.

836
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:16,796
So forgive me if I'm not too thrilled about
being lectured, in Queens,

837
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,565
about being a lousy legal guardian
to three kids

838
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:22,339
who maybe shouldn't have been
given to me in the first place.

839
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:26,007
They weren't given to you, they were
entrusted to you by their mother, who...

840
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,711
Don't you talk about Lindsay.

841
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:33,347
Don't you dare talk about Lindsay.
You didn't know her.

842
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,516
- Gimme the turtle.
- That was outta line. I'm sorry.

843
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,322
Dan, give me the damn turtle.

844
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,696
Helen...

845
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,293

00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:22,167
They're great kids.
They pretty much take care of themselves.

850

We love children.
We're thinking about adopting.

851
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:28,469
But there'd be a lot of traveling involved

00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,372

854
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:37,483

- I believe it.

It means hillside in French.

- Yes.

- Actually, I wasn't a secretary.

- <i>(Helen)</i> Happy Mother's Day.

987
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,624
- You.
- Aunt Jenny, hey.

988
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:18,224
Oh, gosh. Everybody, please sit down.
All right. We're going to eat right away.

989
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:24,068
So, um, did you remember
to bring your letter?

990
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,576
- Oh, of course I did.
- Mm-hm. Oh.

991
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:33,104
- Not until you show me yours.
- Well, why don't we just do it after dinner?

992
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,446
- <i>(dog barks)</i>
- Stay!

993
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,315
<i>(whines)</i>

994
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:40,150
What happened with the train?
Was there a delay?

995
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:43,715
No, no. Audrey was making samosas
at Nilma's, so we caught the next train.

996
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,920
Mm-hm. Just one?

997
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:51,295
Well, they were hungry
so they ate them on the way.

998
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,292
Can I help you with something, Jenny?

999
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,771
You know what?
I've got everything organized.

1000
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,535
Ooh. Ooh.

1001
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,477
Sweetie, what did Mommy say about
kicking when she's having a conversation?

1002
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:06,208
You need to wait until she's finished.

1003
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,375
Thank you very much.

1004
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,079
Did you just boss around the unborn?

1005
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:16,656
It's never too early
to start learning manners.

1006
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,456
OK, kids. We're ready.

1007
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,557
Whoa!

1008
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,694
Wow!

1009
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,368
- Oh, my gosh.
- <i>(Jenny)</i> Look at that. Hey, guys.

1010
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,667
- Holy cow.
- Yeah.

1011
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,571
- Oliver, did you wash your hands?
- Yes, Mom.

1012
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,078
Everything tastes great, honey. You
shouldn't have to cook on Mother's Day.

1013
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:42,084
You know I don't mind.
Being a mom is the greatest job on earth.

1014
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:46,351
I know your mom felt that way.

1015
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,958
- Jenny.
- What?

1016
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:54,861
We all love her. We miss her.
We can mention her. Can't we?

1017
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,023
I don't like to.

1018
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,799
<i>(Sarah)</i> Me neither.

1019
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,838
You know, would you kids like
to talk about what you've been reading?

1020
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,311
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter.

1021
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,315
- Stuff by Shank 54.
- Huh.

1022
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:18,183
- That sounds interesting. Who's that?
- He writes poems.

1023
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:21,712
On the side of our building.
With spray paint at four in the morning.

1024
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,952
Sometimes I help when I can't sleep

1025
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:28,656
because Aunt Helen's on a date
or Audrey's on the Internet talking dirty

1026
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,666
or Sarah's crying
because we forgot to feed her again.

1027
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,258
Henry.

1028
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,065
What?

1029
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,972
Jenny, no.

1030
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:44,206
Henry, what are you talking about?
Is this some kind of joke?

1031
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,646
I don't know why
you keep saying things like this.

1032
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,843
It's not funny.

1033
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,478
- I thought it was funny.
- Thank you.

1034
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:56,152
Henry was making all of that up, Jenny.
Jenny, what are you doing?

1035
01:04:56,225 --> 01:05:00,321
"When a problem comes along
you must whip it. Before the cream..."

1036
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,921
- Jenny, give me my letter.
- That's it?

1037
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:05,524
That's all she left behind
to explain why she chose you?

1038
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:09,264
- The lyrics to "Whip lt"?
- It makes sense to me.

1039
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:13,900
What is it with you two and that song?
It's ridiculous. I don't get it.

1040
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,570
- Exactly!
- What are you saying?

1041
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:23,176
That that's the point? I'm no fun? That I
don't get things? That I never make jokes?

1042
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,584
Show me your letter.

1043
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,345
No.

1044
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,654
No? No? What do you mean "no"?

1045
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:33,490
We said you would read my letter
and I would read yours.

1046
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,792
This is not a letter.

1047
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:40,598
These are lyrics. Nonsensical lyrics.
This is not a letter.

1048
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:45,607
If this was a letter, you could read my letter,
but this is not a letter.

1049
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,007
<i>(Helen)</i> Not a letter?

1050
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:49,510
What?

1051
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:52,513
You are a smug,

1052
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,778
bitter, colossal bitch.

1053
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:56,814
<i>(whines)</i>

1054
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,820
OK. Guys.

1055
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:03,416
I think this is a good time
to take Origami for a walk.

1056
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,426
No, we'll miss the fight.

1057
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:10,193
If you're finished,
I think I'd like to serve dessert.

1058
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:14,225
<i>(Helen)</i> You don't wanna help me,
you just wanna judge me.

1059
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,797
Let's all go into the living room and listen
to Jasmine play the piano with one arm.

1060
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:22,943
You just wanna prove that you're a better
mother than me, that Lindsay was wrong.

1061
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:27,343
Why would I need to prove that?
Of course I'm a better mother than you.

1062
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:32,217
I've been doing it forever. But does that
matter? No. She still chose you over me.

1063
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:38,227
Exactly. <i>She</i> chose, Jenny. Not me.
I had no control over it.

1064
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:43,561
You're angry with me because
of a decision that <i>she</i> made <i>for</i> me.

1065
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:47,329
<i>#</i> Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is...

1066

1067
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:56,039
I don't know what it's like?
How do you think I got this way?

1068
01:06:56,145 --> 01:07:00,206
Whatever this way is
that's so particularly unfun and funny.

1069
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,547
- Who changed your diapers?
- Don't start with that.

1070
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:06,019
Mom died when I was seven.

1071
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:10,889
- Who fed you? Who baby-sat you?
- Lindsay was there, too.

1072
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,288
Lindsay was in New York
trying to be a dancer

1073
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,887
and I was at home
not having a normal childhood

1074
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,195
cos I was too busy being your mommy.

1075
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:21,870
And you're Tra-La-La Helen.

1076
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,873
So... free.

1077
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:33,440
Miss Party-Party-All-Night-Long
and I never ever got to feel like that, ever.

1078
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:37,379
Not once.

1079
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,926
I don't wanna fight any more.

1080
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:51,759

Maybe I can come see you DJ sometime.

1085
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:13,319
I don't know, Miss Audrey. I'm not spinning
no kids' birthday parties, you know?

1086
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:16,085
- You got a fake ID?
- Course.

<i>Nurse Wilson says he's OK.</i>

1088
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,560
When's Henry gonna play, Aunt Helen?

1089
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,362
Uh...

1090
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:30,733
Hey, Coach. This isn't the NBA Finals.

1091
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:33,934
What happens to "everybody plays"?
Why don't you put Henry in?

1092
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:36,876
<i>3, 2, 1.</i>

<i>And Saint Barbara's wins.</i>

- Hi. Excuse me. What is your problem?
- Aunt Helen, please.

I know, I...
He could be one of your best players.

1097
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:53,887
He doesn't wanna play
so you need to square that away with him.

1098
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,955
- You're the coach.
- <i>(Henry)</i> Just forget about it.

I'm gonna go change.

1100
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:05,273
I'm sorry that I yelled at you, Dan,
but I've been battling with the kids,

1101
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:11,177
I'm fighting with my sister and
we're too stubborn to talk to each other.

1102
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,579
I guess I'm just edgy.

1103
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,343
Hey, nobody ever said
it was gonna be easy. Right?

1104
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,048
Yeah, try doing it on your own.

1105
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:23,250
We got a lot of people around here who do.

1106
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:27,159
Matt Higgins' mom, she took a pay cut,
she works out of her house.

1107
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:31,222
And Tommy Meyers' dad is with the kids
all day long, then he works at night.

1108
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,269
I mean, it's tough, but it can be done.

1109
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:38,932
- Hey, you know what you need?
- A nanny. But I can't afford one.

1110
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:42,473
You need some fun.
I'm just the man to provide it.

1111
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,706
What are you doing on Sunday?

1112
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:48,078
- Going to church, of course.
- Yeah, right.

1113
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,277
Nice try.

1114
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:55,380
- You and the kids. Sunday afternoon.
- What do you have in mind?

1115
01:09:56,592 --> 01:10:01,256
Today we're at the Central Park Zoo,
where every spring a prayer is said,

1116
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,663
blessing the animals
and the newborn babies.

1117
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:05,859
Pastor.

1118
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:09,564
Dear Lord, we humbly ask
that you bless these animals

1119
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,300
and all your creatures
throughout the world.

1120
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,669
Blessed are you, Lord. Amen.

1121
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,713
OK, who wants
a private tour of the zoo, huh?

- You and me, on a date.

1146
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:47,892
Oh, no. I made you abandon your vows?

1147
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:52,907
I know you think that I'm probably worth it,
and I'm not. Go back to God.

1148
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,034
I can't be responsible for this.

1149
01:11:55,110 --> 01:12:00,412
Hey, Helen. I'm a pastor.
I'm a Lutheran minister. I can date.

1150
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,508
I can get married, have kids,
watch dirty movies.

1151
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,917
- Really?
- Yeah.

1152
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:10,421
OK, I can't watch dirty movies,
but we're pushing for it, so, you know.

1153
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:15,191
- What d'you say?
- I'm really flattered, Dan, but I...

1154
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:17,755
I can't.

1155
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,496
I'm sorry.
I had a great day, though, today.

1156
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:26,767
OK.

1157
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:31,274
- Pastor Dan just asked me out.
- <i>(Audrey)</i> That is so weird.

1158
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:36,751

Go... go inside and do that.

1159

<i>(sighs)</i> Way to go, Pastor Dan.

1160

It beats balloons and bunting.

1161
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,193
Thank you so much.

1162
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:56,602
There are a couple of customers
wandering outside. Focus the wanderers.

<i>Sales associate to the parking lot, please.</i>

<i>Sales associate?</i>

1166
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:09,480
Leo. The guy on stilts
is looking down my shirt.

1167
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,186
Hey! Mini-Me.
Watch I don't break your kneecaps.

1168
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:18,783
<i>(Helen)</i> Think you can reach them?

1169
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:22,058
Hi. Helen Harris.
Welcome to Massey Motors.

1170
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,826
- Leo Dileo.
- Pleasure.

1171
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,958
- Ahem!
- And that's Rene DeCarlo.

1172
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:27,558
- Hi, Rene.
- Hi.

1173
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:32,767
All right, Leo, let's see if we can
find you something you like. Follow me.

1174
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,937
- You know, I bought a lot of used cars...
- Previously owned.

1175
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:40,845
We got a nice silver Volvo over there. It's a
great family car. I mean, if you have family.

1176
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,749
- Just a rich bachelor.
- That's what I thought.

1177
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:46,982
You don't want this one. Oh, wow.

1178
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,523
I forgot we had this baby.

1179
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,821
I think I know why. It looks like a jukebox.

1180
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:56,957
Only a handful of these were made.
Earmarked for special customers only.

1181
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:01,799
Like in the old days when guys like
Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra

1182
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:04,528
used to special-order their cars
right from the factory.

1183
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:10,973
- You're kidding.
- Sir, three things we don't joke about:

1184
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:15,506
Elvis, Sinatra and Lincolns.

1185
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:19,112
But, like I said, for special customers only.

1186
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:22,954
Honey, I own every hot-dog stand
in Rockaway.

1187
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:28,122
Not the beach, but, still, I can afford to pay
well over sticker for this. And cash.

1188
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,358
<i>It's getting a little windy.</i>
<i>Are you sure it's all right?</i>

1189
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:31,956
- <i>(man) Yeah, it's OK.</i>
- <i>OK. You sure?</i>

1190
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:35,364
<i>You want a deal on a previously owned</i>
<i>car? Then come to Massey Motors,</i>

1191
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:38,167

<i>Mickey Massey. It's a...</i>

- You're not gonna believe it. She sold it.

1194
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,746
Bye, Leo. Drive safely.

1195
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,990
She gets a ham.

1196
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,656
Yes, I did.

1197
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,621
Hey, kids. I'm home.

1198
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:06,725
- Do we have mustard?
- I don't know. Why?

1199
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,794
Because we got ham.

1200
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,998
I sold a car.

1201
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:15,601
- Yay, Aunt Helen!
- Go long, Henry, go long.

1202
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:23,679
- And she takes him down.
- <i>(Helen)</i> You got that pigskin down.

1203
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:26,583
I don't know.

1204
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,122
OK.

1205
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,526
Hey. What's up?

1206
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:39,658
Hippo's mommy and daddy
are still on vacation.

1207
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,733
We're gonna go slice the ham.

1208
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:51,176
- I'm the man, I should slice the ham.
- You're no man.

1209
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:57,446
- They've been gone a long time.
- That's because they went really far away.

1210
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,817
Where did they go?

1211
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,186
Honey?

1212
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:07,353
Sarah, where did they go?

1213
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,522
Heaven.

1214
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,393
That's right, sweetie.

1215
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,660
That's right.

1216
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:20,401
And now there's no one
to give him a birthday party.

1217
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:23,839
- When's Hippo's birthday?
- Now.

1218
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,609
Now?

1219
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,009
Say "Hippo."

1220
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:32,417
Hippo.

1221
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,817
- It's a keeper.
- Great.

1222
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,860
Vince, thanks again for doing this
on such short notice.

1223
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,555
You're sure hanging out
with a new crowd these days.

1224
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:44,793
Yeah, well, tonight is a very special night.
You see, it's Hippo's...

1225
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:48,131
Excuse me, the VIPs. Excuse me.

1226
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:56,668
Hey, Vince. We're here to celebrate.
Devon just got the new Polo campaign.

1227
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,906
Yeah, he's the Ralph Lauren
underwear guy.

1228

<i>(Vince)</i> Congratulations.

1229
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,850
Hey, Devon. Congrats.

1230
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,717
- Are you ready for your dessert?
- Yes, please.

1231
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:11,282
- Can I get you coffee or tea?
- Ooh, can I get a cappuccino, please?

1232
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,591
- Decaf. And I'll have a real one.
- OK.

1233
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,993
And I'll have a Singapore Sling.

1234
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,868
Hey, Jerome. Excuse me, Jerome.

1235
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,798
Hi. Do you think you could sing
"Happy Birthday"?

1236
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:28,502
- Who's the birthday kid?
- Actually, it's Hippo's birthday.

1237
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:33,637
- You want me to sing to a Hippo?
- Yeah.

1238
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,174
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

1239
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,380
All right. What do we got? Skulls.

1240
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:44,255
Another round of double-cherry
Shirley Temples.

1241
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,659
Oh, no, no.
At 12.50 a pop, I don't think so.

1242
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:53,964
And this is for you, Helen. Compliments
of the gentleman right over there.

01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,535
Now, that was kinda sexy.

1308
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,927
Um, Nilma,

1309
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:50,658
have you met the principal of our school?

1310
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,324
- Hi.
- Hi.

1311
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,129
Hi.

1312
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:58,398
- I gotta go. Thank you.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1313
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:03,434
So, uh... I guess we're all getting As.

1314
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:06,643
- Yeah!
- <i>(Helen)</i> All right, OK.

1315
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:09,149

1318
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:19,126

1326
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:51,357
- It's really not that big of a deal, Dan.
- Hey, she was caught making out with BZ.

1327
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:54,793
- OK, not so good.
- While cutting class.

1328
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:58,889
- Also not so good.
- In a balcony in my church.

1329
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,628
How can I come down on her

1330
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,136
for something we were caught doing
a few days ago?

1331
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:06,503
Because you're the adult
and she's the child.

1332
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:11,235
She's gotta know you're serious.
Kids need boundaries. You know that.

1333
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:16,750
But, Aunt Helen, it's a big deal
that a senior asked me to the prom.

1334
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:19,719
I mean, what do you want me to do?
Find another senior?

1335
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:21,346
Yes.

1336
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:28,858
Audrey, I wanna treat you like an adult, but
I do not want you to go to the prom with BZ.

1337
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:32,923
If you go with him, I'll be very disappointed.

1338
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:36,661
- OK.
- OK.

1339
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:41,469
- So, will you help me find a dress?
- Yes, I'll find you a dress.

1340
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:42,908
OK.

1341
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:47,607
- In the balcony of the church?
- Seemed like a good idea at the time.

1342
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:51,675
- You are so going to hell.
- Hey.

1343
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,311
Spider.

1344
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:57,518
OK. Cradle.

1345
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,489
All right, guys. Shoot.

1346
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:06,890
Whoo!

1347
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:09,027
OK. Hit the showers.

1348
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,506
Henry, pick up the balls.

1349
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,006
Hey. Gimme one of those.

1350
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:20,172
Come on.

1351
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:27,145
Let's go. Take a shot.

1352
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:30,647
Come on.
You gotta get fired up for your game.

1353
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:33,352
I am. Can't you tell?

1354
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,726
<i>(sarcastically)</i> Yahoo.

1355
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,856
Oh, Henry.

1356
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,868
OK. Henry?

1357
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,904
Let's talk.

1358
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,100
You used to love to play sports.

1359
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:49,507
Sit down.

1360
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:55,878
You and your dad used to play basketball
till it was too dark to even see the hoop.

1361
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,578
Even when I missed, he'd always count it.

1362
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:02,487
He called it
"Giving me the benefit of the dark."

1363
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,852
- It's OK to smile about it.
- No, it's not.

1364
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,559
- And it's OK to play sports.
- No.

1365
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:15,501
- Why?
- Because he can't play any more.

1366
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:18,333
Because everyone kept saying
Mom and Dad are up in heaven

1367
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:20,306
and they're looking down on us always.

1368
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:24,368
Well, if he is, I'm not gonna
make him feel bad about not playing.

1369
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:29,644
Like if you're having a good time
without him, you're rubbing it in?

1370
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:31,184
Yeah.

1371
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:34,779
Henry. The only thing sadder
than them not being here

1372
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,724
is knowing that by not being here,
you're not doing what you love.

1373
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,863
- They want you to be happy.
- But then it's like I'm just forgetting them.

1374
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:46,298
No, it's not.

1375
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,766
No.

1376
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:50,633
Cos every time you smile,

1377
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,265
or laugh,

1378
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:55,775
or enjoy your life,

1379
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:59,178
it makes their dreams come true.

1380
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,983
Besides, if they are looking down,

1381
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:07,147
you really want them
to be stuck watching a lousy game?

1382
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,816
No. My dad hates a lousy game.

1383
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:24,129
Come on.

1384
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,732
Yeah!

1385
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:31,935
Yes. I am the senior-class treasurer.
And I just...

1386
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:36,377
I want to say that I'm very honored
to be taking Audrey to my prom tonight.

1387
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:38,544
I want you to know that.

1388
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,178
Thank you.

1389
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:42,150
Breathe.

1390
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,021
Hey. Take a look. I got a wig on.

1391
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:49,558
<i>(Audrey)</i> I'm gonna come out now.

1392

How do I look?

1393
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:58,667
You look just like your mother.

1394
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:04,502
Thank you, Peter.

1395
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,605
- OK. We're gonna go.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1396
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:11,550
I wanna... We have to have a picture.

1397
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:14,277
OK, get closer. Smile.

1398
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:23,258
All right, welcome to the senior prom -
Bridges of Friendship.

1399
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:25,322
Coming up next: ladies' choice.

I hear there's actually
some punch in the vodka.

<i>(DJ) Guys, your choice later.</i>

1402

- Who is it?
- <i>(Dan)</i> Prom king.

Hey, I thought we could have our own
little prom. Where's the little kids at?

1405
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:44,877
They're sleeping.

1406
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:47,815
Doesn't the principal
have to police the prom?

1407
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:51,757
Don't worry.
LaGambina's looking out for Audrey.

1408
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,294

Hello.

Hello.

What?

Uh... What? I-I'm sorry.

1421

Can you hear me now?
Yes. This is Mrs LaGambina.

1422
01:29:58,292 --> 01:30:01,887
Yeah, hi. I don't mean to worry you,
but Audrey's not here.

1423
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:05,763
She arrived with Peter,
but she seems to have gone off with BZ.

1424
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,763
I understand. Thank you for calling.

1425
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:16,867
Dan. That was the school.
Audrey left the prom with BZ.

1426
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:21,779
And they overheard some kids saying BZ
was bragging about taking her to a motel.

1427
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:24,682
- What motel?
- They wouldn't say.

1428
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:28,153
OK. They're gonna tell me.
Just come here.

1429
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:31,017
- I just... It's just that I knew it.
- Don't worry.

1430
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:34,755
I'll call you from the prom.
Don't worry.

Thank you.

- So what do you know?
- Nothing yet.

if he can get something out of BZ's friends.

No. Thank you for your time.

Jenny, we have called over 20 motels.
BZ has a car, he could be anywhere.

of Ronkonkoma for all we know.

- Did you let her have a credit card?
- No.

OK. What about your credit cards?
Check your wallet.

- OK.

activity. If she's used it, they'll know where.

Henry and Sarah, please? I'll explain later.

- Don't you talk to me like that.
- It's just prom.

1511
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:36,452
You listen to me. If you ever
so much as <i>blink</i> in her direction again,

1512
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:41,467
I can and <i>will</i> bury you so far in the ground

will incinerate your sorry ass.

1514

- Do you understand me?
- Yes, ma'am.

You want me to make you a cup of tea?

1529

No, thanks.

1530
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:23,833
I think it would be best for me if you just go.

1531

I'm not girlfriend material.
I'm not brave.

1534
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:36,040
I'm not anything you need.

1535
01:37:36,116 --> 01:37:38,676
- Hey, Helen.
- No, please.

1536
01:37:38,752 --> 01:37:40,447
Don't.

1537
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,614
Please, Dan.

<i>(door opens and closes)</i>

1539
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:10,313
OK. So, then, if you wanna come on
Sunday, great, and you just figure that out.

1540
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:14,013
All right?
And then say goodbye to the kids.

1541
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,756
Hey.

so he doesn't get scared in the dark, OK?

1543
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:30,659
- Henry.
- Don't worry about it.

1544
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,867
OK.

1545
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:40,175
I know you're mad.

1546
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:42,181
I'd be mad too.

1547
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:47,949
But, really, Audrey, I'm only thinking of you.

1548
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:50,513
I got you guys something.

1549
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:53,321

1550
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:56,727
That's darling.

1551
01:38:57,831 --> 01:39:00,800
OK, say goodbye to Helen.

Ibsen wrote, "Not all women
are meant to be mothers."

1553
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,959
And I have to say, I agree with him.
Fashion and family do not mix.

1554
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:40,336
But, you know, there can be exceptions.

1555
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:42,705
Exceptions?

1556
01:39:42,776 --> 01:39:47,975
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you. Exceptions like...?

1557

Tinka.

1558
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:52,476
Tinka.

01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:56,148
She wants you to be her agent,

01:39:56,223 --> 01:40:01,126

right now, well...

1633

What don't you understand?
I love those kids.

1637
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:11,904
Whether or not you love them
was never the question.

1638
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:15,931
It was whether or not you could raise them.

1639
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:18,935
The power to take the kids back is yours.

1640

This is not a power struggle
between you and me.

to do the right thing for everyone.

1642

The kids aren't packed. It's too late
for them to go anywhere tonight, anyway.

1643
01:45:33,927 --> 01:45:36,191
Ed, can you let Origami out?

- Yeah, we did.

1652
01:46:06,593 --> 01:46:08,959
It's not really Irwin.

1653
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:13,659
My Irwin had a skull and crossbones
that I drew on his stomach.

1654
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:15,895
Why didn't you say something?

1655
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:18,597
Seemed you didn't want me to know.

1656
01:46:18,672 --> 01:46:25,908
Sarah, honey, why don't you go play
with turtle and figure out a name for him?

1657
01:46:27,614 --> 01:46:33,382
I just couldn't stand the idea of you losing
something else you cared so much about.

1658
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:36,251
Can I put him in a bowl?

1659
01:46:38,358 --> 01:46:39,723
Yeah.

1660
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:47,066
Sarah, you wanna help Henry
with the turtle?

1661
01:46:48,502 --> 01:46:49,867
Can I name him Hippo?

1662
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:52,268
Why do you want
to name everything Hippo?

1663
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:54,739
Because I can spell it.

1664
01:46:55,509 --> 01:47:00,811
Audrey, sweetie, can you do me a favor
and get me your wallet?

1665
01:47:02,282 --> 01:47:03,749
Why?

1666
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:06,683
Could you just do it, please?

1667
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:14,920
Open it up and give me your fake ID.

1668
01:47:16,296 --> 01:47:19,993

- Because I said so, that's why.

1669
01:47:20,567 --> 01:47:24,594
I'm not gonna give it to you.
I'm not a child.

1670
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:26,730
Yes, you are.

1671
01:47:26,807 --> 01:47:30,709
You are a child, Audrey,
and you have a right to a childhood

1672
01:47:30,777 --> 01:47:37,512
and you should fight for it. But if you won't,
then I will. Now, give me your ID.
