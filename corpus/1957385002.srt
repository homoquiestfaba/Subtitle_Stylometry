1
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,559
( music playing )

2
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,263
( cell door clanking )

3
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,391
( man speaking
indistinctly )

4
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,147
( overlapping chatter )

5
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,774
( phone dialing )

6
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,112
Hello. Dr. Arlen?

7
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,115
It's Albert,
Albert De Salvo.

8
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,118
I must say I didn't
expect to hear from you.

9
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,704
How have you been?

10
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,707
Actually,
I've been doing well.

11
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,751
You know, Walpole...

12
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,127
ain't so bad after all.

13
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,254
Well, I'm very happy
to hear that.

14
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,881
But listen.
If you wouldn't mind

15
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,841
relieving me
of my curiosity,

16
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,218
why are you
calling me?

17
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:35,221
I got some things I want
to get off my chest.

18
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,223
Well, I'm sure they
have mental health
professionals there

19
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:38,849
who can help you.

20
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,226
This is different.

21
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,103
I want to tell the truth

22
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,023
about the Boston
Strangler murders.

23
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,984
I see.

24
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,654
Look, Albert,

25
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,864
let's not do this
over the phone,
all right?

26
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,241
I'll arrange
to meet you

27
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,867
at 9:00 A.M.
tomorrow morning.

28
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,661
I'll set up a private
therapy room.

29
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,288
We can talk there.

30
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:01,830
That'd be great.

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,166
Thanks, Doc.
Hey, thanks a lot, huh?

32
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,435
( piano music playing )

33
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,726
Now, now.
That's enough
for now.

34
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,353
Come on, Jennifer.
Don't stop me now.

35
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,729
- I'm begging you.
- It's late.

36
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,356
I got to get up early.

37
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:09,356
- Just a while longer.
- ( laughs )

38
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,233
Stop your groveling,
Romeo.

39
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,277
It don't look
so sexy on you.

40
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,405
You're right.

41
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,948
You're right.

42
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,660
I shall be like a Knight
of the Round Table

43
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,079
and ride off
into the cold, dark night.

44
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,210
Farewell, young maiden.

45
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,551
( laughs )
You okay?

46
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,804
Well, if I'm not,
can I come in?

47
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,431
Send the king my best.

48
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,977
- ( car horn honks )
- ( motorcycle passes )

49
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,485
( laughs )

50
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,987
( laughs )

51
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,520
Mrs. Jennifer Foster.

52
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:13,856
( laughs )

53
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,859
Mrs. Jennifer
Mitchum-Foster.

54
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,318
( laughs )

55
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,403
Nah, too long.

56
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,282
Jennifer Foster.

57
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,786
Jen Foster.

58
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,456
Mrs. Jennifer Foster.

59
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,790
( laughs )

60
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,800
( gasps )

61
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,261
( laughs )
Such a klutz.

62
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,311
( gasping )

63
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,819
No. Stop.

64
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:05,199
Mrs. Jennifer Foster.

65
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,367
( sobbing )

66
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,536
No. No.

67
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,957
( grunts )

68
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,210
( gagging )

69
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,463
( police radio chatter )

70
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,549
Captain, would you
look at this?

71
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,804
A front-page guide
to the Strangler murders

72
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,097
right there
in black and white

73
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,473
for every criminal
in Boston to read.

74
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,810
Why don't we just hand
the investigation over
to Ms. Fineman?

75
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,522
It's my fault.

76
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,731
I let out
the information.

77
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,569
I'm sorry, John.

78
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,113
I just been under
all sorts of pressure

79
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,364
to get this case solved.

80
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,200
Winfield is threatening
to take over

81
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,577
not just our department,

82
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,954
but every department
in the county.

83
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,539
So I figured,
what the hell,

84
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,665
why not get
everybody involved?

85
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,792
Yeah, but you know
what you done, Cap?

86
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,336
You compromised
my entire investigation.

87
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,589
Investigation, John?

88
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,300
We've got
no investigation.

89
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,552
We've got no fingerprints,
no witnesses,

90
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,804
- nothing!
- ( knock on door )

91
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,306
Captain Parker,
lineup's set.

92
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,767
They're waiting on you,
Detective Marsden.

93
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,722
Let's just
get this over with.

94
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,097
All right.
Don't be scared.

95
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,226
Over here.
It's all right.
He can't see you.

96
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,603
Okay.

97
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,566
Woman:
Just take your time.

98
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,694
( no audible dialogue )

99
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,112
The joker with
the sunglasses

100
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,822
is Albert De Salvo.

101
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,282
Couple years ago,

102
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,619
he was charged
with assault,

103
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,954
spent 11 months
at Middlesex

104
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,081
before they let him
go on parole.

105
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,542
Who's the serious one
on the end?

106
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,670
Frank Asarian.

107
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,757
I'm really surprised he's
even out on the streets.

108
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,092
He's got a record
a mile long.

109
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,677
That's... it's him on...

110
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,679
he's over there.
He's on the far right.

111
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,264
He's on the end.
It's him. That's him.

112
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,273
- And, oh, my God, it's...
- Make sure.

113
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,650
He grabbed me.

114
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,987
He grabbed me,
and he punched me
across the face.

115
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,405
I could never
forget his face.

116
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,615
I'll never forget
his face.

117
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,907
Look. He even looks
like a criminal.

118
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,034
Where are you?
I know you in there.

119
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,828
Look at him.
I hope he burns in hell.

120
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:38,996
That's fine.

121
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,623
I'm going to come back
for you.

122
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,665
- Yeah.
- You know that?

123
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,916
- Get over here.
- Where's my lawyer?

124
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,712
Have a seat, fellas.

125
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,338
Finish filling out
your paperwork,

126
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,715
and you're
free to go.

127
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,341
And what if
I can't read?

128
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,761
Sir, if you need help,
we'll find you
an assistant.

129
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,137
Yeah, I'd rather
you assist me.

130
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,556
- I'm sure you would.
- ( laughs )

131
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,738
What are you
looking at, penguin?

132
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,740
What,
he's a fucking penguin,

133
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,826
walking around
in suit and tie.

134
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,952
That's a tuxedo,
asshole.

135
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,495
What?

136
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,665
It's a tuxedo.
Penguins always look

137
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,750
like they have
tuxedos on, asshole.

138
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,210
You trying to make
an ass of me?

139
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,004
Don't you think
I know that?

140
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,922
It's a literal-
fucking-ation.

141
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,383
I didn't mean nothing
of it, all right?

142
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,345
Albert:
It makes no difference.

143
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,930
Got that burn
in my stomach.

144
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,933
Got to find some food,
if you know what I mean.

145
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,978
You have a good one.

146
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,980
Your eyes forward,
Asarian.

147
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,190
Keep moving.

148
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,156
What are you
looking at?

149
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,282
Keep moving.

150
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,700
Woman:
You're not even done.

151
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,327
Albert:
Someone stole
my sunglasses.

152
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,412
I don't care about that.
You gotta finish
your paperwork.

153
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,206
Come home and help me
do it, will you?

154
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,791
Ah, jeez.

155
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,587
( bells tolling )

156
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,761
Hi, Mary Beth.

157
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,060
Oh, hi, girls.
How are you?

158
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,687
Good.

159
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,968
( whistles a tune )

160
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,886
- Hey, beautiful day, huh?
- Hi. Yeah.

161
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,597
Hey, I got
a new office here
on campus.

162
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,973
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

163
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,600
I been meaning
to introduce myself,

164
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,435
but I just
been really busy
with the agency.

165
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,395
- Agency?
- Yeah.

166
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,771
Things are
easing up a bit

167
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,565
ever since
Jackie took over
the White House.

168
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,151
They been making me
search for girls who
look just like her.

169
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,778
You're in
the fashion business?

170
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,823
You could say that.

171
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,365
I'm a modeling scout.

172
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,326
Modeling scout?

173
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,119
Yeah. You know,
I find girls.

174
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,330
I measure 'em,
I photograph 'em,

175
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,457
and then I introduce
'em to the agency.

176
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,792
Oh. Sounds interesting.

177
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,838
You know,

178
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,797
now that I have
a moment alone with you,

179
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,842
you do sort of have
the type of build

180
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,551
the agency's looking for.

181
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,969
What size are you?

182
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,888
Thanks.
Actually, I'm a four.

183
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,266
No frigging way.
You're not a four.

184
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,852
Yes, I am.

185
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,145
( scoffs )
I got to get to work.

186
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,689
- ( laughs )
- Wait.

187
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,067
You can measure me,

188
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,693
and I'll
prove it to you.

189
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,070
What, you'll prove it
to me, eh?

190
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,696
Yeah.

191
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,240
Well, it's
a cutthroat industry.

192
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,909
You sure
you can handle that?

193
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,868
Don't know
if I don't try.

194
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,495
Well, that's true.

195
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,080
- Yeah.
- Uh...

196
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,706
Oh, sorry.
Susan.

197
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,709
Susan. Why don't you
follow me to my office?

198
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,090
You know,
on second thought,

199
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,300
it's probably not
a good idea, you know,

200
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,929
getting measured in
a strange man's office.

201
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:07,138
Maybe another time, huh?

202
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,140
Well, hey...

203
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,767
follow me.

204
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,143
My room's
just upstairs.
Come on.

205
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,770
- You sure?
- Yeah, come on.

206
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,146
Measure me upstairs.

207
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,523
Okay. I got
a few minutes.

208
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,900
- Let's make it fast, huh?
- Okay.

209
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,026
It's too beautiful
outside, right?

210
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,443
Susan: Yeah.

211
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,409
So what agency did you
say you're from?

212
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,203
The Black and White
Modeling Agency.

213
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,206
It's downtown.
I'll give you my card.

214
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,126
How much does it pay
if they accept me?

215
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,752
$40 an hour.

216
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,462
$40 an hour?

217
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,049
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you kidding me?

218
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,052
I could pay
my entire tuition
at that rate.

219
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,055
$40 is just
for the modeling in town.

220
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,307
They pay you more if they
fly you out of town,

221
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,059
plus they pay
all your expenses.

222
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,144
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Sure, yeah.

223
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,147
Lots of girls fly
back and forth to Paris
on a regular basis.

224
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,190
- Paris?
- Mm-hmm.

225
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,110
Oh.

226
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,945
( sighs )

227
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,864
Here's my apartment.

228
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,132
Okay.

229
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,507
( giggles )

230
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,935
Do you mind?

231
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,105
No, not at all.

232
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,150
34 inches.

233
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,153
Really? I thought
I was 32 inches.

234
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,822
Nah, you're a...
you're a 34.

235
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,825
( giggles ) Well,
what's my cup size?

236
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,744
How do you
measure that?

237
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,872
Well, there's no,
you know,

238
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,625
physical measurement
for cup size.

239
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,502
You have to...

240
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,587
well, you know,
by hand.

241
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,049
Yeah?
You're the professional.

242
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:05,965
( laughs )

243
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,605
To get an accurate
measurement,

244
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,149
I have to...

245
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,525
Oh, yeah. Okay.

246
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,198
( laughs )

247
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,866
You have
a gentle touch.

248
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,702
Well?

249
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,579
What's my cup size?

250
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,207
Just a moment.

251
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:41,501
You really
should know by now.

252
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,882
Sorry.

253
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,885
You're a "C" cup,
definitely a "C" cup.

254
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,888
What did you say
your name was?

255
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,598
Oh, it's Johnson.

256
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,350
It's Mr. Johnson.

257
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,060
You can call me Gary.

258
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,104
And where's the agency?

259
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,190
What's the address?

260
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,193
It's downtown,
71st Street, 853.

261
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,196
Well, wouldn't
the address
be in the 70s?

262
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,865
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 753.

263
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,576
You know, I'm sure you're
a good student and all,

264
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,162
but maybe, you know,
modeling's just
not for you.

265
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,205
Maybe you're just
not cut out for it.

266
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,291
Maybe you're not really
a modeling agent.

267
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,209
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

268
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,836
I think you
should go now.

269
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,213
- Really?
- In fact,

270
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,257
maybe I should
just go ahead

271
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,258
and call the cops.

272
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,385
You're not
going to do that.

273
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,804
- ( gasps )
- You're not going anywhere.

274
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,931
- Wait. ( sobbing )
- You're not going anywhere.

275
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,058
You know, the agency
doesn't like girls

276
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,228
who talk back, you know.

277
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,272
They put girls like you
right back on a plane

278
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,564
and send you
where you came from.

279
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,358
Oh, where you think
you're going, huh?

280
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,155
I know there's
no way out of here.

281
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,781
What are you going
to do, jump? Huh?

282
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,158
What, do you got wings?

283
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,287
My boyfriend'll
be here any minute.

284
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,913
( laughs )

285
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,998
When I was
stationed in Germany,

286
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,042
I used to hear
that one all the time.

287
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,669
Only, it was in German.

288
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,672
( speaking German )

289
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,175
Shut the fuck up.
( laughs )

290
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,802
There's money
in my dresser.

291
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,221
You can
have it all.

292
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,225
Top drawer.

293
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,435
Left side.

294
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,729
( sobbing )

295
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,065
Just please
go away!

296
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,567
Please just
leave me alone.

297
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,285
Why don't you go ahead
and do me a favor

298
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,912
and come on
on out of there

299
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,705
so I don't have
to come get you, huh?

300
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,335
Open the door.

301
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,588
( moans )

302
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,717
Open the fucking door.

303
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,351
Open the fucking door.

304
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,815
( scream echoing )

305
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,403
Open the fucking door,
bitch!

306
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,324
Open the fucking door!

307
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,451
- Fucking whore!
- ( Susan screams )

308
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,330
( sirens blaring )

309
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,665
( clears throat )

310
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,292
Would have been here
an hour ago.

311
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,918
Traffic was all backed up
on Common Avenue.

312
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,628
Ah, it's all right.

313
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,589
Been upstairs?

314
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,465
- Yeah, I been up there.
- How's it look?

315
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,385
It's not
a pretty picture.

316
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,760
You'll see.

317
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,304
- What's up, guys?
- Hey, John. How are you?

318
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,265
Hey, John. Samans,
Beverly Samans,

319
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,891
early 20s.

320
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,268
This one is
not strangled,

321
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,312
even though
the stocking is up
around her neck.

322
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,896
She was stabbed
in the neck.

323
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,273
Well, that's creative.

324
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,899
And the killer
left her body

325
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,443
splayed out for all
the world to see,

326
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,069
dress pulled up,
legs wide open.

327
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,196
Mr. Marsden.

328
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,074
( chuckles )

329
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,077
When are you going
to catch the Strangler?

330
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,747
Stranglers.
There's clearly

331
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,374
more than one man
at work here.

332
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:11,127
And how can you be
so sure of that, John?

333
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:15,131
How can you be so sure
it's just one man?

334
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,508
How long have you been
doing this, John, huh?

335
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,177
It's called M.O....

336
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,262
sexual assault,
strangled by stockings,

337
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,889
break-ins,
no witnesses,

338
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,265
et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

339
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,892
I can keep going, John.

340
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,727
Well, forgive me,
Mr. Winfield,

341
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,812
but his M.O.
isn't that clear.

342
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,773
The first five
were elderly.

343
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,775
The sixth was
young and black.

344
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,736
- Mary Brown and now...
- Beverly Samans.

345
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,323
Beverly Samans, it appears,
were stabbed to death.

346
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:41,407
Doesn't sound like
one particular M.O.
to me.

347
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,453
John, I need you
to listen to me,

348
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,080
because I'm trying to be

349
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,248
painfully
crystal clear to you

350
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,709
so I can get through
that thick skull of yours.

351
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,337
( elevator dings )

352
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,882
Just a second, guys.

353
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,974
I'm running
for a Senate seat
next year, John,

354
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,393
and the last thing
I need

355
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,437
is a crime-happy dick
hot-bopping around town,
telling everyone

356
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,272
that there are
multiple murderers

357
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,108
running rampant
in my streets.

358
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,403
The city's position
is that there's
just one,

359
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,029
just one...

360
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,866
and I intend
to catch this
one monster

361
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,702
and send his ass
so deep in jail,

362
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,829
the devil himself
can't find him.

363
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,833
Therefore,
my city will be happy
about life again.

364
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,668
You understand me,
John?

365
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,671
You can have
any theory that you want.

366
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,674
The fact is you
got no jurisdiction
over my department,

367
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,677
and my department
will continue

368
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,803
the search
for multiple killers.

369
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,304
You trying
to oppose me, John?

370
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,849
I don't work
for you, Art.

371
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,350
I work for the people.

372
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,479
You know, it's amazing
you've lasted this long.

373
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,983
Apparently you have
someone taking care
of you on the force.

374
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,863
'Cause I've never seen
a more naive detective.

375
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,535
Enough of this nonsense.

376
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,419
( baby crying )

377
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,134
Good day,
Mrs. Lucino.

378
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,510
Why, thank you, Albert.

379
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,137
How's that beautiful wife
of yours?

380
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,138
She's doing okay,

381
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,432
if you mean
adjusting and all.

382
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,682
Thanks for asking,
huh?

383
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,185
You know,
us Italians and Germans
were partners in the war.

384
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,228
It's a good match,
makes for beautiful kids.

385
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,354
Thank you, Mrs. Lucino.

386
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,397
Michael and Judy
certainly are beautiful.

387
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,024
But, you know,
the war's been over

388
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,067
for almost 20 years
now, you know?

389
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,195
I mean,
we may be Italian,

390
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,905
but always be proud
to be an American.

391
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,908
Hey, I didn't join
the military to fight
for Mussolini

392
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,535
or the Nazis,
for that matter.

393
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,454
Of course, Albert.
You're a decent young man.

394
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,871
See you on Sunday?

395
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,414
Yes, ma'am. Hey...

396
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,041
be careful
out there, huh?

397
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,586
- That Boston Strangler...
- Don't worry.

398
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,588
I've got protection.

399
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,214
- Certainly do.
- ( laughs )

400
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,549
Good day,
Mrs. Lucino.

401
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,300
You too.

402
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,888
Claudia?

403
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,182
Claudia, where are you?

404
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,558
Claudia?

405
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,561
Claudi...
Claudia?

406
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,855
Michael?

407
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,567
Where are you?

408
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,611
Where the fuck are you?

409
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,154
Claudia?

410
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,656
Michael? Judy?

411
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,494
Where are the kids?

412
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,370
They're
at your mother's house.

413
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,372
Don't you
remember anything?

414
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,958
I brought you
some flowers
and chocolates.

415
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,170
That was Munich,
Albert.

416
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,381
This is Boston.

417
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,591
The romance is over.

418
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,552
Be a man.

419
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:48,594
I am a man.

420
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,555
No, Albert.

421
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,599
You are not a man
until you can act

422
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,975
like a responsible
husband and father.

423
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:56,227
Claudia, I go
to work every day

424
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,312
to bring home
money for you
and the kids, right?

425
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,690
Half of the time you
tell me you're at work,

426
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,900
you're having a beer
at the bar,

427
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,361
or worse, you're
screwing other women.

428
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,405
Ah, Claudia,
come on now.

429
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,533
Albert,
don't you realize

430
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,576
that I can feed
the children

431
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,452
breakfast, lunch,
and dinner

432
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,872
for the price
of all your beer?

433
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,707
Baby, please, huh?

434
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,500
I swear to God
I can make it better.

435
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,127
I swear to God.

436
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,796
When, Albert?

437
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,090
When?

438
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,386
You dragged me
all the way across
the Atlantic Ocean.

439
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,889
Why would you
do that?

440
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,474
So you
could be a bum?

441
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,352
- Albert.
- Hmm?

442
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,229
Do you remember
the promise

443
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,898
that you told me
back in Germany?

444
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,858
- Mm-hmm.
- That you told my parents?

445
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,484
Mm-hmm.

446
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,529
I promise, baby.

447
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,822
- Albert.
- Mmm.

448
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,492
Albert.

449
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,662
Albert.

450
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,416
Albert!
Stop it.

451
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,668
- ( moaning )
- ( crying )

452
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,253
- Albert!
- What?

453
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,630
- Stop it!
- ( grunts )

454
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,423
I got needs!
I'm a fucking man!

455
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,799
You're my wife!

456
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,343
Fuck you.

457
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,721
Don't you ever
touch me again.

458
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:14,889
Is this the treatment
I get for being a man?

459
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,933
I got fucking needs,
damn it!

460
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,303
Again, different knot.

461
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,933
- You sure about that?
- Positive.

462
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,894
The first five
were tied into a bow.

463
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,688
This one was tied
into a knot first.

464
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,898
Then the bow was tied.

465
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,150
And while we're
scratching our asses,

466
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,903
there are women dying
all over the city.

467
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,365
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

468
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,368
There is,
if I can help it.

469
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,620
Hey, Captain,
hand me those tweezers,
will you?

470
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,833
Thanks.

471
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,136
What are you
going to do with that?

472
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,221
This is evidence,
Captain.

473
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,015
I'm going
to save it.

474
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,642
Maybe we can
match it up

475
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,269
to the killer
under a microscope.

476
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,521
Not in my lifetime.

477
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,418
Anything?

478
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,753
Do we have anything?

479
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,963
Not a thing, sir.

480
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,758
There was not
a fingerprint anywhere
in this apartment.

481
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,760
Witnesses?

482
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,178
Not a one.

483
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,805
As far
as I can tell,

484
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,598
nobody heard
or saw anything.

485
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,974
Family been notified?

486
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,601
Yes, they have.

487
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,855
Find out if she had
any ongoing disputes.

488
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,899
Find every friend
and family member

489
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,776
and get 'em
down to the precinct
for questioning.

490
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,072
Don't you worry,
sweetheart.

491
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,782
We're going
to figure this out

492
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:40,201
if it's
the last thing we do.

493
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,869
John, maybe we
should let forensics

494
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,829
come in, do their thing,

495
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,706
and why don't you head
back to the office?

496
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,710
I don't need to head back
to the damned office.

497
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,094
You know,
that attitude
is the reason

498
00:27:58,094 --> 00:27:59,721
we can't find
these girls'
killers.

499
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,640
Everybody wants this
to just go away,

500
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,225
sweep it
under the carpet.

501
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,353
Well, it's not
going away.

502
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,854
It's not going away,
'cause the killer

503
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,606
isn't just
going to stop.

504
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,982
People kill
each other.

505
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,026
I mean, all we are
is animals

506
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,738
in a fucking
suit and a tie,
no difference,

507
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,489
and all
of you detectives

508
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,742
need to think
about why you're
on the force.

509
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,619
What about you,
Spinelli?

510
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,413
Why are you here?
What's motivating you?

511
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,790
What motivates me?

512
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,043
( snorts )
Job stability.

513
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,629
Job stability.
There it is.

514
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,923
It ain't about
catching the bad guy
any more than it was

515
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,092
when my father
was a cop.

516
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:41,637
It's about
job stability.

517
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:42,805
We're all
just trying to provide

518
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,640
for our families here,
every one of us.

519
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,016
Yeah, yeah. Well,
you know what, Joe?

520
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,643
Maybe you should have
been a bricklayer,

521
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,019
'cause they get
great fucking benefits.

522
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,855
- Oh, get...
- Hey, hey, hey.

523
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,481
Hey, John. John.

524
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,733
Try that again,
I'm going to make sure

525
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,110
you're cleaning
convicts' cells

526
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,696
for the rest of your
career. You got me?

527
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,489
You got me, Joe?

528
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,253

Strangler?

585
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,714
It's got all
the earmarkings.

586
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,093
Matches the M.O.,

587
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,844
but on close
inspection,

588
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,304
there are
some incongruities.

589
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,764
Really?

590
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,184
Like what?

591
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,394
John,
she's strangled

592
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,021
with the stocking,
all right,

593
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,107
but that bow is not tied
like we'd expect.

594
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,068
It's a copycat.

595
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,653
The first five were killed
by the same guy.

596
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,196
Sophie Clark
and this girl

597
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,950
were killed
by jagoffs who actually
read the papers.

598
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,827
Woman:
New Year's Eve.
At least we know

599
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,079
the Strangler doesn't
take holidays off.

600
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,081
Well, technically
it's not a holiday
until tomorrow.

601
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,624
Technically
it is tomorrow.

602
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,584
Hold on.
Who are you?

603
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,380
And how the hell
did you get access
to my crime scene?

604
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,173
I'm Jana Fineman.
I'm with "The Record."

605
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,426
Oh, you're
with "The Record."
You're a reporter.

606
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,344
We prefer
to think of ourselves
as public disseminators.

607
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,179
It's our duty
to inform the public.

608
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,806
Well, you know what?

609
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,850
I'd prefer to think of you
as somebody who's gone.

610
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,143
Donovan, get her
out of my face.

611
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,145
Detective Marsden,
would you mind
commenting on why,

612
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,188
after seven murders,
you have no leads,

613
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,815
no witness,
no evidence.

614
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,400
How do you know
what evidence we got?

615
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,193
All right?
The department is
not in the habit

616
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,239
of sharing details
on investigations
with the papers, miss.

617
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,781
Our sources
are telling us
that you have

618
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,200
absolutely nothing
to go on.

619
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,243
I don't give a damn
about your sources.
Get her out.

620
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,287
She's going. She's going.
She's almost gone.

621
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,913
She's gone.

622
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:14,220
Radio: Fellow citizens
of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts,

623
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,763
someone please
call in to my show.

624
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,140
I want to hear from you.

625
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,726
Someone tell me what is
going on in this town.

626
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,187
Why can't the cops
find this guy?

627
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:25,189
He's strangling women
all over town.

628
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,150
The list,
it's just despicable.

629
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,193
Anna Slessers,
she's 55 years old.

630
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:30,819
She was the first to die.

631
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,654
She was strangled with
the cord of her bathrobe,

632
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,283
her very own bathrobe,
around her neck,

633
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,160
on June 14, 1962.

634
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,535
A nylon stocking was used

635
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,913
to kill 68-year-old
Nina Nichols on June 30,

636
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,456
and Helen Blake, age 65,

637
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:44,291
was found the same day.

638
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,126
- A stock...
- ( radio clicks )

639
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,213
How was the party?

640
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,673
It'd have been
a lot better if you
had been there.

641
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,138
You'll catch him, John.

642
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,848
Don't lose focus.

643
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,435
I can't catch "him."

644
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,188
Of course you can.

645
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:08,149
You're the top detective
on the force.

646
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,442
It's not that I don't
believe in myself, babe.

647
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,152
I can't catch "him,"

648
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,779
'cause I don't think
it's one man.

649
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,448
The M.O.
changed drastically

650
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,659
between Jane Sullivan
and Sophie Parker.

651
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,494
Jane was 67.

652
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:22,288
Sophie was 19.

653
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,580
But they were
all strangled.

654
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,416
The first five
were the same guy,

655
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,294
but I'm 100% sure
that he stopped.

656
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,297
The last two
were copycats.

657
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,049
Basically the papers
have printed

658
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,051
a how-to book on
the Boston Strangler.

659
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,220
"Just follow
these instructions,

660
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,180
and you too can
be the Strangler."

661
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,849
Have you told anyone else
how you feel?

662
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,811
Michelle, this is
not how I feel.

663
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,189
John, I'm not
questioning you.

664
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,565
Calm down.

665
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,149
This is your wife
you're talking to here.

666
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,944
Sorry, babe.
I'm a bit tense.

667
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,697
Yeah, no kidding.

668
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,324
This is political.

669
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,076
The papers, the public,

670
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,120
the mayor,
and the attorney general

671
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,371
all want it
to be one man.

672
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,291
Nobody wants to hear
there's a...

673
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,542
( chuckles )

674
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,669
there's murderers
running rampant
out there.

675
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,675
Well, we can't
solve anything tonight,

676
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,345
so why don't you...

677
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,558
you just focus
on investigating me, huh?

678
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,110
( door closes )

679
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,404
( overlapping
conversations )

680
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,495
Hey, why don't you
get on over there?

681
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,414
All right.
All right, simmer down.

682
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,042
( crowd murmurs )

683
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,169
Look, I know it's odd

684
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:55,172
for all of us to be
here in the same room,

685
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:58,550
but perhaps Mr. Winfield
can enlighten us.

686
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,221
Winfield:
Morning, gentlemen.

687
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,140
Let's try and act
like professionals.

688
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:08,644
Now, as you all know,

689
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,562
there's been
12 Strangler murders

690
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,439
without any real leads.

691
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,485
Now, I know you all
have been working

692
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,528
very hard
investigating
your cases,

693
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,531
but it's simply
not working.

694
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,117
I've got so much
pressure up my ass,

695
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,328
I'm about to crap
out of my mouth.

696
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:30,291
So I have devised a way

697
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,292
to give us a chance

698
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,253
to catch
this murdering bastard.

699
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,547
As of today,

700
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,966
the entire
Boston Strangler case

701
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,803
will be handled
by a new bureau of
the commonwealth.

702
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,557
This bureau will be called
the Strangler Bureau.

703
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,936
Every department...

704
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:54,398
and I mean
every department...

705
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,526
will be
working together...

706
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,405
providing the bureau

707
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,490
with every shred
of evidence,

708
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,202
witness testimony,
et cetera.

709
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,543
The head of this
new bureau will be...

710
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:17,379
Mr. Fred Addison.

711
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,299
What? Addison?

712
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,386
Are you kidding?

713
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,471
What is this,
a joke or something?

714
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,848
What does he know
about law enforcement?

715
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,683
Huh? Has he ever
been on the street?

716
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,519
No offense,
Mr. Addison,

717
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,062
but what the hell
does he know about
police business?

718
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,399
Sergeant Donnely,

719
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,942
are you questioning
my judgment?

720
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,153
Do I look
like a joke to you?

721
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,323
I suggest you put
a sock in it right here
and right now,

722
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,409
or you will be at home
with your wife,

723
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,494
baking cookies
and doing laundry.

724
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,747
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

725
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:54,291
Does this look like
a fucking classroom
to you, Mr. Smith?

726
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,584
Put your hand down.

727
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,628
No questions
will be answered
until I'm finished.

728
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,464
Now, I will tie
your hands to your belt,

729
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:02,383
you try
that shit again.

730
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,471
Also leading this bureau

731
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,474
will be Detective
Phillip Bloom,

732
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:14,728
Special Officer
John Marsden

733
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,606
of the Boston State Police,

734
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:20,901
and Andrew Tuney
of the Mass State.

735
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,448
Alongside
these fine gentlemen

736
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:26,823
will be a medical advisory

737
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,950
made up of experts
from around the state.

738
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:31,787
Finally...

739
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,541
the press
will be informed

740
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,503
of a $10,000 reward

741
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:41,296
for any information

742
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,925
leading to the capture
of the Strangler.

743
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,554
You all look as if
you want to kill me.

744
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,141
You have any questions,

745
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,645
Mr. Addison will take them.

746
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,568
He's your man.

747
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,237
I just delivered
the message.

748
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,405
Fred.

749
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,533
Now, gentlemen,

750
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,451
we all have to work
together on this,

751
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,454
and we will explore
every option possible

752
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,624
to gather as much
information as we can

753
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,917
to capture this criminal.

754
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,545
Now, I'd like you all
to meet me back here today

755
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:22,921
at precisely 2:00 P.M.

756
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,382
to discuss further details.

757
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,635
Good morning.

758
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,010
2:00?

759
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,596
All right, ladies,
you heard him.

760
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,390
- Yeah, great.
- See you back here at 2:00.

761
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,766
See you later.

762
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,810
Why don't you go
and see if he's
got everything.

763
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,728
Look, we'll try
to keep you up to speed

764
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,648
here on this.
I'm sorry about that.

765
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:43,609
John, maybe
we can have a... yeah,
we need to have a talk.

766
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,445
Your office or mine?

767
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:50,198
Oh, whoa.

768
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,033
- You all right?
- Yep. Yeah.

769
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:03,587
Here it is, Mr. Addison,
all 37,000 pages.

770
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:05,631
Well done, Richie.

771
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,173
I would imagine
that everything is collated

772
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,509
and labeled
to my exact specifications.

773
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,760
You betcha.

774
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,470
And the computer folks
have their copy?

775
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,472
Yes, sir.
Delivered it
this morning.

776
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,099
37,000 pages?

777
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,727
Not 370?

778
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,395
37,000 pages?

779
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,314
That's right,
Mr. Marsden.

780
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:25,317
This is every single
bit of information
about the cases

781
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,653
organized into
one master book.

782
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:29,988
And the scientists
over at MIT have been
gracious enough

783
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,531
to help compile all
of the information

784
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,284
on their
mainframe computers.

785
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,870
Computer? Whoa.

786
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,664
What the hell
are you going to do
with a computer?

787
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,125
Organization,
Mr. Marsden,

788
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,501
organization.

789
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,128
Well, Mr. Addison,

790
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,422
takes a hell of a lot
more than computers

791
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,174
and organization
to solve a case.

792
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,135
Well, whatever it takes,
Mr. Marsden,

793
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,678
you haven't found it,
have you?

794
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,805
How the hell
would you know?

795
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,690
Frigging Poindexter.

796
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,861
Well, it looks like MIT's

797
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,947
going to be solving
all our cases.

798
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,574
( chuckles )

799
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:15,659
37,000 pages.

800
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,703
( laughs )

801
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,246
- No, no, don't.
- No, no, no.

802
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,623
It's a one-way street.
You can't...

803
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,541
They'll never see me
on a one-way street.

804
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,377
- ( siren blaring )
- ...on a one-way street.

805
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,630
Shut up! Shut up!
Ah, this fucking...

806
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,339
Albert, you can't
go down this way!

807
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,882
- It's a one-way street.
- It's a one-way street.

808
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,134
They'll never know I went
on a one-way street.

809
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,511
- Shut up.
- What are you doing?

810
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,054
Albert, you're taking
our lives in your hands.

811
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,681
- Pull over!
- ( car horns honking )

812
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:38,723
You could kill us
all, Albert.

813
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,016
- Michael, tell him...
- Shut up!

814
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,185
Just shut the hell up,
Sondra! Shut up!

815
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,728
- Johnson. Mr. Johnson.
- Paris?

816
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:47,107
I done some bad things, man.
I got some problems.

817
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:49,610
What kind of bad things?
You've got the cops
after you.

818
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,403
Some fucking problems
with the broads.
You know that.

819
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,781
Susan: You're in
the fashion business?

820
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:55,783
I made some mistakes,
okay, Mike? You just...

821
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,867
- What's... oh, my God!
- ( crashes )

822
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,494
Oh, shit!

823
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,371
Shit, I'm sorry, guys.

824
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,831
Oh, fuck.
God, I'm a prick.

825
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,165
I'm an asshole.

826
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,668
Slow down. It's fine.

827
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:07,210
Come on, Sondra,
let's get out of here.

828
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,503
No, no.
Where you guys going?

829
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,089
- Where you going?
- Albert.

830
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,091
Albert, what did
you do, Albert?

831
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,801
- Buddy, don't you go anywhere.
- You're arguing with them.

832
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,594
- Don't you go anywhere!
- What did you do?

833
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,221
- Mikey!
- You're bleeding.

834
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,597
What have you
done, Albert?

835
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,307
Now look what you
gone and done.

836
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,226
You're a mental case,
Albert De Salvo.

837
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:26,271
- A mental case!
- ( sirens blaring )

838
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,981
Claudia, don't you
go anywhere!

839
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:29,607
- Don't you leave me!
- I can't do it, Albert.

840
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,608
Don't you
fucking leave me!

841
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,695
I've had enough of this.
I'm sick of this.

842
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:34,988
Sondra:
I don't want to be here
when the cops get here.

843
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,448
- Just give yourself up.
- Mikey.

844
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,657
Please, come on,
Albert.

845
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,409
- Please. I'm sorry, Mike.
- What'd you do?

846
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,161
- What'd you do?!
- Did some bad shit, man.

847
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:43,621
You're innocent
till proven guilty, right?

848
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,373
You get... they got
nothing on you, right?

849
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,791
They're coming right now.
I'm in trouble.

850
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,376
- Turn yourself in.
- Mikey!

851
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,670
What am I gonna do?
Mikey!

852
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,254
Come on,
just turn yourself in.

853
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,756
- But... what are you doing?
- Please, Albert.

854
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,382
- Please. Just please.
- I can't do it!

855
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,426
What am I gonna do?
Mikey!

856
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:57,720
Come on,
just turn yourself in.

857
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,137
Officer on bullhorn:
We have you surrounded.

858
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,181
Turn off the ignition
and step out of the car.

859
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:02,725
- What'd you do?
- Put your hands up...

860
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:04,184
Shit, get out of here!
Go! Go! Go!

861
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,728
- You cannot get away.
- ( engine sputtering )

862
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:08,021
You are under arrest,
Mr. De Salvo. Please...

863
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:11,483
God damn it! Start,
you fucking thing!

864
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,860
Damn it!

865
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,696
Keep looking
straight ahead,
Mr. De Salvo.

866
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:18,031
I'm looking.
I'm looking.

867
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,789
So this is
the loony bin, eh?

868
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:27,999
It ain't so bad.

869
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,043
Go faster, Mr. De Salvo.

870
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,795
All right, all right.

871
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,466
So where do they keep
the broads in this joint?

872
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,842
( laughs )

873
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,844
Just keep walking.

874
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,763
Hey, hey, how long
this guy been in here?

875
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,348
Ain't none
of your business.

876
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,724
All right. Just asking.

877
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,740
I thought I said
no roommates.

878
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,203
Shit.

879
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,998
You better clean up
in that sink over there.

880
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,792
Nice to meet you
too.

881
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:14,295
Gorgeous, huh?

882
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:21,761
Hey...

883
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:27,809
I know you.

884
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:30,186
Nah, you don't know me.
( chuckles )

885
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:34,190
Nah, I know you.

886
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,817
I never forget a face.

887
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,154
Yeah?

888
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,030
I don't either, and...

889
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,700
you don't look
too familiar to me.

890
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,704
That's because you
ain't paying attention.

891
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,873
You can't remember nothing
if you ain't watching.

892
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:56,797
February of last year.

893
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:59,549
Yeah, that's it.

894
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:02,218
You're... you're
the little joker
in the lineup.

895
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,931
I ain't ever been
in a lineup.

896
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,891
Sure, you have.

897
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:09,267
Bitch chose me...

898
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:13,771
thought I was
the Boston fucking
Strangler or something.

899
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,398
Imagine that,

900
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,192
a nice guy like me,

901
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:20,778
the Boston Strangler.

902
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,155
Now wait a minute, now.

903
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:24,908
Yeah, now I remember.

904
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:26,451
Yeah, that's right.

905
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,995
Man, was I glad
she chose you.

906
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:30,580
When I was walking out
of the jail that day,

907
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,583
I met this little honey,
and... ( sighs )

908
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,878
I'm just saying.
( laughs )

909
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:38,546
I'm really happy
for you.

910
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,840
Ah, no offense. I don't
mean no disrespect.

911
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,593
I'm just saying,
you know.

912
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:46,804
Those were some
serious charges, huh?

913
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,598
You're telling me.

914
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:51,017
How'd you beat the rap?

915
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,898
Had a winning ticket
on a horse at a track,

916
00:46:55,898 --> 00:46:57,273
perfect alibi.

917
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,108
Sure, yeah.

918
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,319
It's perfect.

919
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,906
So which bed is mine?

920
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:05,907
Don't bother me.

921
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:11,038
I don't sleep
in the bed.

922
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:12,914
Yeah, where do you sleep?
Sleep with the fish?

923
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:16,001
( laughs )

924
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,669
I don't
really sleep much.

925
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,380
And when I do...

926
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,299
I sleep
on the floor.

927
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,511
Hey, wait.
What is that,

928
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,346
some Buddhist shit, huh?

929
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,351
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

930
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,981
Nah.

931
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,607
- ( pats back )
- Bad back.

932
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,317
( laughs )

933
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,945
I see.

934
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:43,987
So...

935
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:47,573
what are you
in here for?

936
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,995
Why are you in here, Al?

937
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,413
How do you know my name?

938
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:56,083
Memorized it.

939
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:57,625
Where?

940
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,295
From the lineup card.

941
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:03,298
From a year ago?
Come on.

942
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,800
I ain't that smart, Al.

943
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:12,015
You see, while I was
at the police station,

944
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,516
I stole the lineup card,

945
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,893
just in case my alibi
didn't hold up,

946
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,562
'cause if
it didn't hold up,

947
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:20,107
I was going to make up
some cockamamie story

948
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:21,482
about it being
one of youse.

949
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,110
Ah, that's
frigging brilliant.

950
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,028
You're like your own...
very own lawyer, huh?

951
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,030
What, you study law?

952
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,198
What were you,
a copper?

953
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,870
Nah.

954
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,080
Just always
thinking, you know?

955
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,047
Can never
stop thinking.

956
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,633
You got to think
like a rat

957
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,927
if you want to stay
out of shit holes
like this.

958
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,140
What are you
in here for, anyway?

959
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,187
I shot a guy...

960
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,024
six times in the head
point-blank.

961
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:05,152
Holy shit.

962
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:07,278
For what?

963
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,654
Before that...

964
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,283
I stabbed him
five times.

965
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,847
Spoke to your grandmother
yesterday.

966
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,692
No, I don't want to go.

967
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,195
No, not you.
Winnie.

968
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:55,827
I'm not going to talk
about this any further.

969
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,120
You're not going
to Marianne's party.

970
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,204
I don't care
what you say.

971
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,747
- I said I'm going.
- You're not going.

972
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,041
I don't like
that woman's morals.

973
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,083
Why? It's just a party.

974
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,001
You can't go.
When I talk to your father,

975
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,087
you're gonna find out
how you're not gonna go
anywhere for two years.

976
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,713
- Get in the car.
- Fine.

977
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,976
Ma, what's happening?

978
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:21,352
- I don't know.
- That guy's bleeding.

979
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,063
- Ma, go help him.
- Oh, my God.

980
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,897
( groaning )

981
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,402
Get on your knees.

982
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,238
Mom, go. Go.

983
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,031
- Stay calm. Stay calm.
- But he has a gun.

984
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,408
- Don't look, honey.
- Come on.

985
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,826
Beg me for your life.

986
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:39,162
Beg me. Beg me
not to shoot you.

987
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,913
On your knees.

988
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,916
Don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

989
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,127
Take the money.

990
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:47,044
Don't kill me.

991
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,046
( sobbing )
No.

992
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,339
Lock your door.

993
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,967
That's much better,
much better.

994
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,635
Unfortunately,

995
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,264
beggars
can't be choosers.

996
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:59,932
No. No.
( wails )

997
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,976
- Come on! Oh, my God!
- My God!

998
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,269
- Ma, he shot him.
- My God!

999
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,480
- Mom, go, please.
- ( engine sputters )

1000
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,108
- Mom, what the hell?
- Stay calm.

1001
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:09,817
- Let's go. Please.
- It's okay.

1002
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,194
We're getting
out of here.

1003
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:14,071
- He's coming.
- ( screaming )

1004
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,907
Come on. Mom, go.

1005
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,286
- ( sobbing )
- Oh, no. Please, God.

1006
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,123
( gun clicks )

1007
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,301
Frank:
He tried to be a hero.

1008
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,180
I was just
robbing the store.

1009
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,223
That damn clerk
wouldn't open up
the register.

1010
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:43,434
So you just stabbed him?

1011
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,313
You're damn right I did.

1012
00:51:46,313 --> 00:51:49,106
What, you telling me
you never killed nobody?

1013
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,026
I mean, not really.

1014
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,486
What does that mean?

1015
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,112
What do you mean,
"not really"?

1016
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:59,742
Well, there was
this one woman,
you know, and I...

1017
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,953
I think I scared her,
you know. She...

1018
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,289
I think she
had a heart attack
right there.

1019
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:07,167
- She dropped dead.
- ( laughs )

1020
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:08,543
( laughs )

1021
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,378
That ain't murder.

1022
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,213
You're funny.

1023
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,839
Ah, I mean, you know,

1024
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,177
I'm just saying if I
hadn't snuck up on her,

1025
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:18,553
well, she'd still
be going to church

1026
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,263
this Sunday, you know.

1027
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:22,139
I mean, I didn't call
an ambulance or anything,

1028
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,891
so I figured
I killed her.

1029
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,185
( scoffs )
And that's why they
locked you up?

1030
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,271
Nah.

1031
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,606
What for?

1032
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,651
I like the broads,
you know?

1033
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,487
Frank:
Tell me who doesn't
like the broads, right?

1034
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:42,159
( whimpering )

1035
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:48,082
( gasping )

1036
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,719
( traffic passing )

1037
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:21,407
John.
Go to sleep.

1038
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:24,118
I heard a noise.

1039
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,953
So what?

1040
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,371
This is the noisiest
neighborhood

1041
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,498
in all of Boston.
Now go to sleep.

1042
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:40,801
You're a cop,
for God's sakes.

1043
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,429
What are you afraid of?

1044
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,942
I worry about you
when we're not together.

1045
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,280
I can take care
of myself.

1046
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,697
Oh, yeah?

1047
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:04,617
You can take on a 6'2",
200-pound man, can you?

1048
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,453
Yeah.

1049
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:07,953
Sure.

1050
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,372
I could take him on.

1051
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,294
Kick him in the balls,

1052
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:16,295
and then I'd bite out
his jugular,

1053
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,005
just like
you taught me to.

1054
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,634
Right.

1055
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,222
John, it's
a quarter past 5:00.

1056
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,266
I'm going
back to bed.

1057
00:55:02,425 --> 00:55:03,718
Did you hear that?

1058
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,471
Now you're
losing it, John.

1059
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,349
I didn't
hear nothing.

1060
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:13,144
Look,
it's the Strangler case.

1061
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,520
It's getting to you.

1062
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,397
It's not getting to me.

1063
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:18,023
You're only human, John.

1064
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,151
Murdering people
gets to people.

1065
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:22,069
Ain't nothing strange
about that.

1066
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:27,032
Somebody's getting
murdered out there
right now,

1067
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:30,161
and there's
not a damn thing
I can do about it.

1068
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,872
Two years I been
working on this case,
and I got nothing.

1069
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:34,416
I can't solve
this thing.

1070
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:36,625
No one can.

1071
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,252
I'm not nobody,
Michelle.

1072
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,714
You solved 10 cases
since this investigation's
been going on.

1073
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,466
- This is different.
- How?

1074
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:48,345
This is the biggest case
we've ever had.

1075
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,432
This is bigger
than Jack the Ripper.

1076
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,143
What?

1077
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:58,022
- Wha...
- I've heard enough.

1078
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,774
I'm sleeping
downstairs.

1079
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:01,358
What's the matter?

1080
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,818
You're scaring me,
John.

1081
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,361
That's what's
the matter.

1082
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,183
Is it really necessary
for you to walk me
all the way there?

1083
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:36,561
It's for your
protection, sir.

1084
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,990
Yeah. You cheater.

1085
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,075
( knock on door )

1086
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,369
Mr. De Salvo,
you have a visitor.

1087
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:54,578
Oh.
Get the cards.

1088
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,247
- I got 'em.
- Get the cards.

1089
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,998
Here.

1090
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,626
Mr. Whitmore.

1091
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:07,383
I'd like you to meet
the newly infamous,

1092
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:09,009
famous the world over,

1093
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,387
soon to be
a wealthy man,

1094
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:14,139
Albert De Salvo.

1095
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,934
Certainly is
a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Whitmore.

1096
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,979
Frank's told me
a lot about you.

1097
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,233
This is the Boston
Strangler?

1098
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:27,236
( chuckles )
In the flesh,
Mr. Whitmore.

1099
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,405
Can you believe it?

1100
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,241
Not really, no.

1101
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:36,036
All right.

1102
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:46,672
Well, let's get down
to business.

1103
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,507
Okay.

1104
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,688
You know,
the city has spent
millions of dollars

1105
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:03,480
trying
to track you down.

1106
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,400
The D.A. created
a special task force
just for that purpose.

1107
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,652
For three years,
they've been looking
for you,

1108
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,279
not a trace.

1109
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:13,365
It's pretty impressive.

1110
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,826
Frank:
Sure is.

1111
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,579
Albert is like a cat.

1112
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,497
He could sneak
in and out

1113
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,625
of any apartment
in Boston without
being noticed.

1114
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,836
No witnesses...

1115
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,463
ever.

1116
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:34,803
Then why confess, hmm?

1117
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,848
Family man, wife, kids,

1118
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,309
a dog,

1119
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,102
probably even
a goldfish.

1120
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,521
No one even
suspected you.

1121
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,609
Guess you could say
it was a career move.

1122
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,320
Ha. A career move.

1123
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,656
Now, look,
Mr. Whitmore...

1124
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:05,084
we got client-attorney
privileges here, right?

1125
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:07,878
- I mean...
- Frank, you know the score.

1126
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,047
Anything you say
in this room stays
in this room.

1127
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,050
That's the way
it goes, guaranteed,

1128
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,677
confidential.

1129
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:17,179
Good, because...

1130
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,644
the way
that we see this,
Winfield...

1131
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:27,649
is offering
$10,000 per murder.

1132
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:30,025
Now, that's
over $100,000.

1133
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,278
See, I tell Frank,

1134
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,364
Frank tells the cops,

1135
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,574
and we split
the reward money.

1136
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,702
- Simple.
- And you,

1137
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:42,621
you become
a world-famous litigator.

1138
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,124
I mean,
any publicity

1139
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:46,917
is good publicity,
right?

1140
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,629
It's going
to be messy.

1141
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,672
It's a huge story.

1142
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,841
I mean, the press
and the public,

1143
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,467
they're going to want
to crucify Al,

1144
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:56,719
crucify him.

1145
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,138
They're going
to have the grave
already dug.

1146
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:03,475
Unless...

1147
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:06,437
Whitmore:
Unless what?

1148
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:09,189
Unless you
claim insanity.

1149
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,817
For me, or for him?

1150
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:13,527
See, I'm going to jail
for life anyway,

1151
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,738
so we cop
an insanity plea.

1152
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:16,864
They don't execute me,

1153
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,657
and I live out
the rest of my life

1154
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,743
in a hospital,
and the best part

1155
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:23,663
is our families
get to keep the cash.

1156
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:27,667
( laughs )

1157
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,418
Jesus.

1158
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:40,929
( chuckles )

1159
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,267
Then I'll do it.

1160
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,770
( laughs )
Perfect.

1161
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,396
- That's great.
- Perfect.

1162
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:50,647
Ah, thank you,
Mr. Whitmore.

1163
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,316
Thank you.
Thank you.

1164
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:53,692
On one condition.

1165
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,695
Sure, yeah.
Whatever.

1166
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:57,446
If you guys
get the reward,

1167
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:59,531
we split it
three ways.

1168
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:00,908
- Three ways.
- Ho. Ho.

1169
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:03,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Three frigging ways?
What is this? Frank.

1170
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,122
Calm down.
Mr. Whitmore.

1171
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:10,125
Frank, I'm doing
this for free.

1172
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,128
It's pro Bono.
I don't see a dime
off of this.

1173
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,755
It's the least
you can do.

1174
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:17,424
Before you know it,
there's nothing left.

1175
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,843
Wait. Hold on.

1176
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:22,221
That'd be plenty
of money, Al.

1177
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:29,228
We can't do it
without him.

1178
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:30,855
Don't you see?

1179
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:34,024
The plan is
already in motion.

1180
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:36,860
There's no turning back.

1181
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:42,407
He's the only one
that could keep you out
of the electric chair.

1182
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,789
Hey...

1183
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:50,792
Mr. De Salvo,

1184
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:52,835
I don't think
you realize

1185
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:56,713
what the public
really thinks of you.

1186
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,716
They don't want
to just see you
get electrocuted.

1187
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,426
They want
to tear you to pieces.

1188
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,012
They want
to string you up from
the nearest lamppost

1189
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,556
and cut your guts out.

1190
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,850
That's what they
want to do to you.

1191
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,687
Now, you let me
handle the legals,

1192
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:15,691
I'll make sure
that you live a long,
comfortable life.

1193
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,443
Yeah, but, Mr. Whitmore,

1194
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,238
the thing is,
see, I got kids,

1195
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,784
and I got a wife
who I know still loves me,
and I got a family.

1196
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:26,869
I'm the one taking
a chance here, right?

1197
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:29,705
I'm the one
taking a risk.

1198
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,169
All right.

1199
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:37,254
That's it.

1200
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,257
Al, it's going
to be fine.

1201
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:43,845
Either way,

1202
01:02:43,845 --> 01:02:46,597
there's no going back
to the way things was,

1203
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:49,600
so why not let
Mr. Whitmore here

1204
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,269
make sure you go somewhere
that's comfortable?

1205
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,734
And don't he deserve
some of the money too?

1206
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:01,111
I mean, I know him.

1207
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,655
He works real hard.

1208
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:05,741
He'll do anything
and everything

1209
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:08,744
in his power
to take care of you.

1210
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,829
Al...

1211
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,956
come on.

1212
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,959
We're running out
of time here.

1213
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:17,962
You're running out
of time.

1214
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,965
So...

1215
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,592
ahem.

1216
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,886
We got a deal
or what?

1217
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,430
We got a deal.

1218
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,724
( laughs )

1219
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,727
Frank, I'll be in touch.

1220
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:34,770
Okay.

1221
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,898
That's what
I'm talking about.

1222
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,274
- Okay.
- Guard!

1223
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,903
( sirens blaring )

1224
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:44,154
Detective Marsden!
Sorry.

1225
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,156
You know Albert De Salvo?

1226
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,783
Yeah, sure, I do.

1227
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:49,911
Measuring Man,
Green Man.

1228
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:52,412
Why? What's up?

1229
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,248
Well, come on.
Spit it out,
for Pete's sake.

1230
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:57,334
Albert De Salvo
confessed to being
the Boston Strangler.

1231
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,961
He confessed
to what?

1232
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:00,337
To the Boston Strangler.

1233
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,673
I mean, isn't that great?
We got our man. That's it.

1234
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:04,341
He confessed.
It's over.

1235
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,343
It's finally...
it's over.

1236
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,345
( bells tolling )

1237
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,850
Thought you'd be happy,
Detective Marsden.

1238
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,271
I thought you'd be
jumping for joy right now.

1239
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:19,564
In fact, everybody else
is downstairs celebrating.

1240
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,941
They're shaking hands.

1241
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:22,567
- Are they?
- Yeah.

1242
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,948
So are you
coming downstairs
and celebrating?

1243
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,911
Yeah, 'course I am.

1244
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,915
Matter of fact,
I'm going to come down
and buy you a drink.

1245
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:37,291
I'll be right down.

1246
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:38,918
You got it, sir.

1247
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,394
Ahem.

1248
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:28,592
Michael, Sondra,

1249
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,927
I want you to meet
a very good friend
of mine.

1250
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,513
This is Frank Asarian.

1251
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:36,017
Frank, this is
my brother Michael

1252
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:38,602
and my sister-in-law
Sondra.

1253
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,063
My pleasure.

1254
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:42,939
My pleasure.

1255
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,152
Al, it's a family meeting.

1256
01:05:46,152 --> 01:05:47,944
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
It's all right.
It's all right.

1257
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,571
No, Frank is
my family in here.

1258
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,115
Come on, come on,
let's sit down.

1259
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:00,916
So?

1260
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,292
Michael:
I just don't get it.

1261
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:09,883
I mean, I just
don't know what to say.

1262
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,302
There is
nothing to say.

1263
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,389
I made
some mistakes.

1264
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:16,515
Some mistakes?

1265
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:20,394
You call killing
innocent women mistakes?

1266
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:23,397
Listen, Albert,
we just don't understand

1267
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:25,148
how and when
all this happened.

1268
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:28,194
I mean, I know that
you got your problems
with the broads and all,

1269
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:29,986
but murder?

1270
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,406
See, look, you don't
understand, okay?

1271
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,449
There's a lot to the story
I ain't telling you.

1272
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,119
Okay, it's very
complicated.

1273
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,162
All I can say,
though,

1274
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,791
is I'm going to make
a whole lot of money
off this deal.

1275
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,043
And I'm already
pretty famous, right?

1276
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,254
You're not famous,
Albert.

1277
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:50,257
You're infamous.
It's different.

1278
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:51,716
Sondra.

1279
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,095
Look, I know
we never seen
eye to eye

1280
01:06:54,095 --> 01:06:56,055
on a few things,
okay, but...

1281
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:58,890
any sort of fame
is all right by me,
you know?

1282
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,976
No, I just
don't get it.

1283
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,105
There's reward money.

1284
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:07,399
Frank's going
to collect that.

1285
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:09,526
There's going to be
television interviews.

1286
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,403
There's going
to be book deals.

1287
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,572
I even got a call
about a movie.

1288
01:07:13,572 --> 01:07:16,200
I mean, no, listen,
they want to make

1289
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,576
a frigging movie
about me.

1290
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,203
And guess who's
going to play me.

1291
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:20,412
Tony frigging Curtis.

1292
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:22,164
This is crazy.
You kill people,

1293
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,374
and all you could
think about is being
a movie star?

1294
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,169
The way we're
looking at it is that

1295
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:29,754
I'm already gonna
be in jail for life
for other crimes.

1296
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,339
Why not make
the best out of it?

1297
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,967
And Frank's come up with
this really good plan
for my incarceration.

1298
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,343
Tell 'em, Frank.
Go ahead.

1299
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,097
Ahem. Well...

1300
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,059
we decided
with our lawyer,

1301
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,270
Stuart Whitmore,

1302
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,273
to go for
an insanity plea.

1303
01:07:47,273 --> 01:07:49,900
Mr. Whitmore
made a deal with
the Attorney General

1304
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,569
that nothing Albert
says about the Boston
Strangler case

1305
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,654
can be used against him.

1306
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:58,533
I mean, they already
got him in the court of
public opinion anyway,

1307
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,202
so why bother
trying him in court?

1308
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:05,166
So they're going
to try him for
the Green Man offenses.

1309
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:07,334
Now, what's going on here?
Is Asarian here

1310
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:10,003
your legal
representation too?

1311
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,588
He's a smart guy,
okay?

1312
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:14,175
So just let him speak,
Mike, all right? Come on.

1313
01:08:14,175 --> 01:08:15,550
Go ahead, Frank.

1314
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:19,846
As I was saying,

1315
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,474
Mr. Whitmore's
going to suggest
to the jury

1316
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:24,559
that Albert is
completely insane.

1317
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,396
And instead of
going to Walpole,

1318
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,107
he's going to go
to a country club
run by the state.

1319
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:33,735
It's brilliant.

1320
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:36,197
It's frigging
brilliant.

1321
01:08:36,197 --> 01:08:39,200
Michael,
I've had enough.

1322
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,493
They're demented.

1323
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:48,041
( sighs )
Why you giving up
so easy?

1324
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,752
Let them
prove you guilty.

1325
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,796
This is an opportunity.

1326
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,714
I got a chance here
to make the name

1327
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,175
Albert De Salvo
mean something.

1328
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:58,468
I mean, Ma worked
her whole life for us
to mean something.

1329
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,679
Nah, nah, this ain't
what she meant, Albert.

1330
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,268
I'd rather just be
a plumber my whole life...

1331
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,604
than be in the mess
you're in right now.

1332
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,108
I love you, Albert.

1333
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:15,485
I'll visit you
every week.

1334
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,279
Promise. Well,
maybe next time

1335
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,072
we could just
play some cards
or something

1336
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,282
like the old days.

1337
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,034
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1338
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,246
Sure, Mike,

1339
01:09:25,246 --> 01:09:26,621
just like
the good old days, huh?

1340
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,220
Don't worry, Al.

1341
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,099
You're making
the right decision.

1342
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:50,520
He ain't in
your predicament.

1343
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,189
He don't know.

1344
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,941
He's a plumber.

1345
01:09:58,153 --> 01:09:59,696
Yeah, you're right,
Frank.

1346
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:02,741
He doesn't know
my predicament.

1347
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,368
No.

1348
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,713
She mapped it all out.

1349
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,090
Look at all the details
she got here.

1350
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,925
You'd think she
committed the murders.

1351
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,510
Now listen to this.

1352
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,221
There was
a pack of cigarettes
sitting on the ground

1353
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,349
underneath a pink chair
with flowers on it.

1354
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:29,310
Mm. Yeah, see,

1355
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:31,186
now this is the kind
of information we need.

1356
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:32,562
We need
to know the murders

1357
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,189
in more detail
than anyone else.

1358
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:36,107
Exactly. Look.

1359
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,777
Right here,
it says Ida Irga

1360
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:41,780
was wearing a blue robe
with flowers sewn on it,

1361
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,408
not pictures,
but actual knitting.

1362
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:46,327
That's what
I'm talking about.

1363
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,246
What are you doing?

1364
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,873
What? I got
to look at it.

1365
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,459
You know,
I got to see it.

1366
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:55,001
I got to let
the picture sink in.

1367
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,462
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1368
01:10:57,462 --> 01:11:00,465
What? I got a, you know,
photogenic memory.

1369
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:03,468
You got a photographic
memory, you moron?

1370
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,220
What, are you serious?

1371
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,971
Why didn't you tell me?

1372
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,348
What? I thought
everyone had one.

1373
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:09,974
What are you
talking about?

1374
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,811
( laughs ) This is
like a gift from God.

1375
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:15,439
Do you know
what that means?

1376
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,856
No.

1377
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,025
Just look at that one.
Look at that one.

1378
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,485
- I'm looking.
- Oh, my God.

1379
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,987
They're going...
you're going to know
better than the murderer.

1380
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,365
Well, look. Right here,
you see these pictures
right here.

1381
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,409
Yeah, just look at it.
Just look at it, okay?

1382
01:11:27,409 --> 01:11:28,952
- Fine.
- Okay?

1383
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,745
All right, I got...
I got... oh, my God.

1384
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,373
- You got it?
- I got it.

1385
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:34,666
- Perfect. Look at that.
- Okay.

1386
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:37,461
( laughs )

1387
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:38,837
Next. Next.

1388
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:40,714
We've got through the...
that fast?

1389
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:42,466
- Come on.
- Here you go.

1390
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:44,509
- Okay.
- Jesus Christ.

1391
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,762
( door opens )

1392
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:50,181
So you're Albert De Salvo.

1393
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,558
Certainly is a pleasure

1394
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:53,893
to meet
someone so famous.

1395
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,104
The most famous person
I ever met

1396
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:59,065
was Miss Ohio of 1957.

1397
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:01,485
Uh...

1398
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:03,445
I didn't agree
to no lie detector test.

1399
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:05,613
Relax, Albert.
It's a tape recorder.

1400
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,948
For the record,

1401
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,451
we're going to record
your confession.

1402
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,580
I ain't afraid
of no lie detector.

1403
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,374
I'm just saying we
never agreed on that.

1404
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:16,750
Don't worry about it,
Albert.

1405
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,753
We all have secrets.

1406
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:21,713
We're only interested

1407
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:24,340
in the ones
you're confessing to.

1408
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,843
Ready?

1409
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,387
Sure.

1410
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:31,473
( recorder clicks )

1411
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:33,183
Mr. De Salvo...

1412
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:36,102
Oh, please,
call me Al, huh?

1413
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,354
Let's get
this thing started off
on the right foot, huh?

1414
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,356
I couldn't agree more.

1415
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,358
Albert...

1416
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:46,154
when was the first time
you met Anna Slessers?

1417
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:48,907
Well, I wouldn't
say, you know,
I actually met her.

1418
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:51,410
She was just
a pretty girl that...

1419
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,244
Pretty girl?

1420
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:56,748
But Anna Slessers
was 55 years old.

1421
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:59,334
Yeah, yeah.
Anna Slessers.

1422
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:01,961
You know, but she
was a real looker
for 55.

1423
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,550
See, you know, I was...

1424
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,426
I was hiding
in the closet, right,

1425
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,678
and I watched her
walk inside.

1426
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,305
Usually I'm hiding
in the...

1427
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,681
in the bedroom
or something,

1428
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,435
but this time, I was hiding
in the foyer closet,

1429
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:18,019
and she was...

1430
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:20,439
she was holding
a bag from Gimbels.

1431
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:21,856
Addison:
Oh, well, that's strange.

1432
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:24,108
Because I'm sure that...

1433
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:27,613
it was a bag
of groceries.

1434
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,365
Albert:
Yeah, that's right.

1435
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:31,658
Yeah, it was
a bag of groceries.

1436
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:35,496
You know, it was
meat, milk, and
all that stuff.

1437
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:44,212
James,
are you home?

1438
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:16,662
So after she finished

1439
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:19,122
putting the food
and stuff away,

1440
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,582
I stayed in the closet.

1441
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:23,835
You do remember
that you killed her
in the bedroom?

1442
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,547
You're talking about
Anna Slessers, right?

1443
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,173
Yes.

1444
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,550
Right. Yeah.

1445
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,176
So she walked
into the bedroom,

1446
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,553
and I followed her
very quietly.

1447
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:36,557
You know,
she didn't know
I was there.

1448
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:56,701
( drawer thumps )

1449
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,328
James?

1450
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,540
( gasps, yells )

1451
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,499
( muffled screaming )

1452
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:07,587
Stop. Help!

1453
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,923
Help me! Help!
Help me! Help!

1454
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:13,593
( yelling )
Help! Help!

1455
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:16,346
Someone help me!

1456
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:18,097
God help me!

1457
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,433
( screams )

1458
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,727
( gags )

1459
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:25,313
Oh, God!
Help me! Stop!

1460
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,725
Addison:
So when did you
use the stocking

1461
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:03,184
to strangle her?

1462
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:04,978
Where'd you get it?

1463
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,356
See...
( laughs )

1464
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:10,358
see, now you're
trying to trick me,
Mr. Addison.

1465
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:13,569
See, I remember
this one very clearly.

1466
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,363
So I took the tie
to her robe.

1467
01:16:15,363 --> 01:16:16,740
I wrapped it
around her neck,

1468
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,574
and I'm pulling
on it, and I'm
pulling on it.

1469
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,619
She's fighting me
and fighting me, right?

1470
01:16:20,619 --> 01:16:22,245
She even scratched me
with her nails.

1471
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,663
It was terrible.

1472
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:26,416
But, you know, I mean,
it was necessary, and...

1473
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:29,419
Okay. That's lots
of information.

1474
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:33,006
We might have to go back
a few steps, though,

1475
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:35,341
just to make sure
we got it all right,

1476
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,926
I mean, we got it all.

1477
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,804
You know how judges are.

1478
01:16:38,804 --> 01:16:40,764
Sure. I understand.

1479
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:43,516
( tape rewinds )

1480
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,226
So...

1481
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,232
let's take
a step back.

1482
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:53,693
You said that,
on the night

1483
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:56,612
of the Slessers murder,
you hid in the closet

1484
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,824
and then you followed her
into the bedroom.

1485
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:01,576
Is that right?

1486
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:03,077
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1487
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,705
That's exactly
what happened.

1488
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,510
( sighs )

1489
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,807
( sighs )

1490
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:31,397
I'm sorry, Al.

1491
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:34,818
Sorry?

1492
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:39,906
Is that all
you got to say?

1493
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:43,869
You see, I'm the one
who's going to go
to Walpole.

1494
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,371
The appeal is
already in motion.

1495
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:51,667
Did you see the faces
on those jurors?

1496
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,879
Did you see them,

1497
01:17:53,879 --> 01:17:56,798
those God-fearing
people?

1498
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,674
They hated me.

1499
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,843
They want
to see me fry,

1500
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,679
sent me
right to the chair.

1501
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,806
And we'll appeal it.

1502
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:07,767
Look, it's just...

1503
01:18:09,811 --> 01:18:12,814
everybody's all
in a frenzy

1504
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:15,233
about the Strangler.

1505
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,781
Just too soon.

1506
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:25,076
Oh, yeah?

1507
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,411
Is that your
professional opinion?

1508
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,540
At least you'll be
with Frank in Walpole.

1509
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,251
Frank's going to
the frigging electric
chair, and you know it!

1510
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:40,716
That's on appeal too.

1511
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,721
Look, Albert, you're still
going to get your money.

1512
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,516
You're going to get
your book deal,
your movie deal.

1513
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:50,601
All of that is still
coming through.

1514
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,186
But Walpole,
for Christ's sake!

1515
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:54,689
Walpole! They will
fucking kill me there!

1516
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:56,149
I'm going to die there!

1517
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,945
Albert, this is your life.

1518
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:03,030
You did this,

1519
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,826
not me, not anyone else.

1520
01:19:05,826 --> 01:19:07,827
I've done everything
that I could, everything.

1521
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:14,208
Do you want me
to appeal the verdict?

1522
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:16,878
I don't know.

1523
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:18,504
Does Frank think
I should do it?

1524
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,047
For God's sake, for once,
forget about Frank.

1525
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,924
I'm your attorney!

1526
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,301
I am.

1527
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,933
Listen to me.

1528
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:32,435
We can appeal this thing

1529
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:35,313
and get you
in an institution.

1530
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:37,064
Okay?

1531
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:39,942
Is that what
you want? Hmm?

1532
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:42,945
Yeah.

1533
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:45,991
Yeah, maybe
you're right.

1534
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:50,328
By the time the court
hears the appeal,

1535
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:53,957
this whole Strangler
thing will be...

1536
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:57,001
old news, right?

1537
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,214
Yeah.

1538
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:02,883
Right.

1539
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,639
Stay strong.

1540
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:11,682
Lay low.

1541
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,644
Everything
will be fine.

1542
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:18,982
This is my world.

1543
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:24,946
We'll get you
out of it, brother.

1544
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:29,533
Need a little money
while you're in here? Hmm?

1545
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,002
40 will last you.

1546
01:20:42,923 --> 01:20:45,299
Not enough
for the fucking casket.

1547
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:21,961
Man on radio:
Albert Henry De Salvo,

1548
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,796
the 35-year-old
mental patient

1549
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,966
who says
he murdered 13 women
as the Boston Strangler,

1550
01:21:25,966 --> 01:21:27,508
was found guilty tonight
of armed robbery,

1551
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,885
assault, and sex offenses
involving four women.

1552
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,846
He was sentenced
to life imprisonment.

1553
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:34,432
De Salvo's lawyer, who had
asked the jury of 12 men

1554
01:21:34,432 --> 01:21:36,559
to find the defendant
not guilty by reason
of insanity,

1555
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:38,894
told newsmen bitterly,
quote, unquote,

1556
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,146
"Massachusetts has
burned another witch.

1557
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:41,772
No fault of the jury's,
of course.

1558
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,399
It's the fault of the law."

1559
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:44,900
His case was built
on the argument

1560
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,527
that De Salvo was
a schizophrenic
personality.

1561
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,612
Although
the 13 murders committed

1562
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:51,407
in the Boston area
from mid-1962 to early 1964

1563
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,200
were not a part
of his trial,

1564
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,578
De Salvo's lawyer tried
to inject testimony
relating to them.

1565
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:57,788
He said he felt these
crimes were so monstrous

1566
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:00,416
that the jury must agree
that his client was insane,

1567
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,501
but the court refused
to permit testimony

1568
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,129
relating
to the stranglings.

1569
01:22:04,129 --> 01:22:05,796
De Salvo, a former
military policeman

1570
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,089
and former middleweight
boxing champion

1571
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,799
of the armed forces
in Germany,

1572
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:11,010
stood erect and wan
as the jury foreman,

1573
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:13,054
F. Hunter Rolley
of Concord,

1574
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:15,973
a brokerage firm analyst,
reported him guilty

1575
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:18,017
on each count
of a 10-count indictment.

1576
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:20,436
The jury deliberated
three hours, 45 minutes...

1577
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,150
Albert:
I just can't take it
no more, you know.

1578
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:27,234
I just can't
take no more.

1579
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,528
It's time, man.

1580
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:31,489
Six years is
enough time.

1581
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,074
I'm a changed man,
you know.

1582
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:35,034
I ain't the same man
I used to be.

1583
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,119
I help
the old people now.

1584
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,997
I work
in the infirmary.

1585
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:40,373
I haven't
had a drink

1586
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:42,000
since I broke out
of Bridgewater.

1587
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,667
And what's
the difference

1588
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,711
if I tell
the real story now?

1589
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:48,381
What's the difference
if I tell that I ain't
the Boston Strangler,

1590
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:52,052
that I never was
the Boston Strangler?

1591
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:53,803
Man, I don't need
the fame no more,

1592
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:56,222
and I ain't
seen a dime from
any of this mess,

1593
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:59,142
not a...
not a frigging dime.

1594
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,603
You know...

1595
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,897
maybe if
I tell the truth,

1596
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,982
my family'll talk
to me, you know?

1597
01:23:08,401 --> 01:23:11,196
You can't say nothing,

1598
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:13,948
nothing to nobody.

1599
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,699
And that's for the rest
of your life.

1600
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,328
But why, Frank?
I mean, why?

1601
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,955
What's the difference?

1602
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:23,166
Because I'm telling
you not to.

1603
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:27,002
I'm in this too,
you know.

1604
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:30,714
I don't want no problems,
no press, no nothing.

1605
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:33,342
There's no sense
in rehashing the past.

1606
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,139
In my book...

1607
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:40,307
it's over.

1608
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,062
You're talking like
you got something

1609
01:23:44,062 --> 01:23:46,021
you don't want me
to know, Frank.

1610
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,398
You hiding something?

1611
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:51,569
You better shut up, boy,
before I grab your head

1612
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:53,696
and I bust it
against those bars.

1613
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,868
Sounds like
you got a secret.

1614
01:23:58,868 --> 01:24:01,871
Sounds like you been
holding on to something
for all these years.

1615
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,583
( laughs )

1616
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:10,379
I'm done talking.

1617
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:14,633
I've said enough.

1618
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,690
( whistles )

1619
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,066
( buzzer sounds )

1620
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:38,949
You can do with it

1621
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:41,076
whatever
the fuck you want.

1622
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,947
Claudia:
You even know
what you've done?

1623
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:19,199
( bell tolling )

1624
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,033
Frank:
You're running
out of time.

1625
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,326
- ( woman moans )
- Why you giving up so easy?

1626
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:24,495
- ( screams )
- I got needs!

1627
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:27,498
I'm a fucking man!
You're my wife.

1628
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:30,501
I ain't the same man
I used to be.

1629
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:44,723
Guard!

1630
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:47,352
( phone dialing )

1631
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,567
Hello. Dr. Arlen?

1632
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,902
It's Albert,
Albert De Salvo.

1633
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,779
I must say
I'm surprised
to hear from you.

1634
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:00,155
How have you been?

1635
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:03,867
Actually,
I've been doing well.

1636
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:05,452
You know, Walpole...

1637
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,746
ain't so bad after all.

1638
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:09,957
Well, I'm very happy
to hear that.

1639
01:26:09,957 --> 01:26:11,333
But listen.
If you wouldn't mind

1640
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,210
relieving me
of my curiosity,

1641
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:15,170
why are you
calling me?

1642
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,298
I got some things I want
to get off my chest.

1643
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:19,383
Well, I'm sure they
have mental health
professionals there

1644
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:20,884
who can help you.

1645
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,012
Nah, nah.
This is different,
Dr. Arlen.

1646
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,391
I want to tell the truth

1647
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:28,517
about the Boston
Strangler murders.

1648
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,270
I see.

1649
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,856
Look, Albert,

1650
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:36,191
let's not do this
over the phone,
all right?

1651
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,568
I'll arrange
to meet you

1652
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,194
at 9:00 A.M.
tomorrow morning.

1653
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,571
I'll set up a private
therapy room.

1654
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:42,197
We can talk there.

1655
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,200
That'd be great.

1656
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,578
Thanks, Doc.
Hey, thanks a lot, huh?

1657
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:13,122
( cell door clinks )

1658
01:28:18,419 --> 01:28:21,381
Who's over there?
Who's there?
Who are you?

1659
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:22,589
- ( grunting )
- Ow! Oh!

1660
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:24,384
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1661
01:28:24,384 --> 01:28:26,511
What the fuck
are you doing?

1662
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:27,511
( blade slicing )

1663
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,304
Oh, yeah? You going
to fucking talk now?

1664
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:32,057
- ( Albert screaming )
- ( grunting )

1665
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,853
Fucking snitch.

1666
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:42,860
( door closes )

1667
01:28:58,459 --> 01:29:00,669
Guard, we're done here.

1668
01:29:17,603 --> 01:29:19,229
Man on radio:
Albert H. De Salvo,

1669
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:20,606
who became known
as the Boston Strangler,

1670
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:22,232
was found stabbed to death

1671
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:23,901
at Walpole State Prison
this morning.

1672
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:25,528
The prison authorities said

1673
01:29:25,528 --> 01:29:27,279
that the 40-year-old
inmate's body was discovered

1674
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:30,699
in his cell bed in the prison's
hospital wing at 7:00 A.M.

1675
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:33,411
De Salvo, who worked
as an orderly in the hospital,

1676
01:29:33,411 --> 01:29:35,496
was said to have died
of multiple stab wounds.

1677
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:37,540
The Norfolk County
District Attorney

1678
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:40,125
said tonight that
a possible suspect
had been questioned,

1679
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,835
but that no arrests
had been made.

1680
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,629
Although De Salvo
confessed the details

1681
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:45,255
of the slayings
of 13 women

1682
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,132
from the Boston area
to a psychiatrist

1683
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:49,176
and became widely known
as the Boston Strangler

1684
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:50,719
through a book
and a movie release...

1685
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:27,422
( instrumental music playing )
