Give me your shoes.

Oh, shit!

You want my shoes?

372
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:24,348
For two years now,
I've been meaning to ask you.

373

When you dress like this, where
exactly do you strap your piece?

374

You mean
you forgot already?

375
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:34,066
Well, you know it was
way back in the day.

376
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:37,694
Oh, yeah.
Maybe you should ask Lamont.

377
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,864
Why I gotta ask Lamont?
I'm standing right here.

Damn, nigga! Why you
always up on my woman?

I was asking
a legitimate-ass question.

Why is it every time you see me
talking to her, you roll up on me?

- You feeling insecure?
- Lamont, he’s just kidding.

Don't smoke. Thanks.

You know why
they call me that?

392
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,730
'Cause "ch-you" always takes care
of "ch-your" peoples?

I'd never come back.

was a "but what?" that'd be it.

and nobody'll say nothing.
