00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,739
Oh, just--
I can show them to you.

543
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,336
Okay.
I don't know if that--

544
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:00,970
Let's get some
of those puppies.

545
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,712

[groans]

550
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:23,465
[groggily]
Just replacing the shingles.

00:33:23,475 --> 00:33:25,228
<i>Oh, replacing some shingles.</i>

552
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:27,397
Hey, when you're done up there,
will you come do my house?

553
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:28,698
I got to do the whole roof.

554
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,966
Hmm.

a couple of drinks?

558
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,711
Must be the tar.

Must be the what?

560
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:46,583
Yeah, I remember
when I was a kid

561
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:49,886
I was helping my mom
bring groceries to the car.

562
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:52,227
And it was summer,

563
00:33:52,237 --> 00:34:00,035
and I remember the smell
of the hot asphalt.

564
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:05,940
I guess the tar of the shingles
reminds me of that.

Everyone, just stand back.
The big man's in charge.

Sir, would you like
store credit or not?

586
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,428
Just take 'em, okay?

587
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:37,001

About what?

00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,504
If I can get you to come down
to the station, then--

609
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:36,506
Is this about my neighbors?

610
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:39,242
I heard them fighting before.
Is she okay?

611
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:42,183
I'd just like to talk.

612
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:44,647
We've had some complaints
from some of your neighbors.

613
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:48,451
Complaints from my neighbors,
what do you mean?

614
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:50,053
We just need
to clear up a few things.

615
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:51,721
Is she okay?

616
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:53,990
Did she tell you
I talked to her?

617
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,197
Well, first things first,

618
00:38:56,207 --> 00:38:57,494
What did you do
this afternoon?

619
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,462
I was sleeping
this afternoon.

620
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:01,131
Most of the time,
I was sleeping.

621
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:02,232
Why?

622
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:03,900
You sleep during the day?

623
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,302
I work at night.
I'm a janitor.

624
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:08,643
What did my neighbors say?

625
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:10,573
I'm not get into
specifics here.

626
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,109
My neighbors
made complaints about--

627
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,745
Okay, sir, look,
I don't know anything about you,

628
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:17,113
but your record's clean.

629
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:19,315
What are you tal--
So if we can just keep it that way.

630
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:21,351
My record?
What are you talking about?

631
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,886
Look, don't bother
the other tenants.

632
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:24,154
I don't bother them.

633
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:26,623
Don't harass anyone,
and don't threaten anyone.

634
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:28,630
I don't--

635
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,734
Wait, did she think
I was gonna hurt her

636
00:39:32,744 --> 00:39:33,730
or something?

637
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,798
Who?

638
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:38,440
The woman
who lives next door to me.

639
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,903
You threatened
a couple of children.

640
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,137
That's why you're here.

641
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:42,205
What are you talking about?

642
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:43,873
They said you attacked them
in the hallway

643
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,308
and you chased after them
with a bat.

644
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:46,710
They broke into my apartment.

645
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,178
A couple of ten-year-olds...
Yeah.

646
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:49,879
Broke into your apartment.
Yes, they did.

647
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,181
Did you leave
the door unlocked?

648
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,782
No, I--no.

649
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:53,917
Then how'd they get inside?

650
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:55,927
I don't know.

651
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,793
I just brought you down here
to talk, okay?

652
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:05,462
I'm not saying one thing
or another.

653
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:09,804
Raped her,
her husband.

654
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:11,601
Her husband raped her.

655
00:40:11,611 --> 00:40:13,636
Sir, if I can get you
to keep yourself out of trouble,

656
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:14,838
you'll save us both
some time.

657
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,639
I heard--he beats her.

658
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:18,575
They live next door to me.

659
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,343
I heard--I heard him beat her.

660
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:21,911
I heard her scream.

661
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:22,912
I heard he raped her.

662
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,247
<i>Sir, are you listening to me?</i>

663
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:28,227

664
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,221
I'm sorry.

665
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:32,856
I didn't mean
to go into your room

666
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:34,157
<i>and look through your stuff.</i>

667
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:35,291
<i>I'll never do it again.</i>

668

<i>It was wrong,</i>
<i>and I'm sorry.</i>

669
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,095
Can I go now?

670
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,196
Go to your room.

671
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:41,331
Can I play nintendo?

672
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:42,332
No.

673
00:40:42,342 --> 00:40:43,667
No nintendo for a month.

674
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:44,668
<i>But, Mom.</i>

675
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:46,678
Go now.

676
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,106
I don't even know
what to say.

677
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:52,008
I'm so sorry.

678
00:40:52,018 --> 00:40:53,610
If I were you,
I would've slammed the door

679
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,878
in my face already, but--

680
00:40:54,888 --> 00:40:57,013
Well, I brought you this.

681
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:04,821
Oh, it's just--
I don't know, I listen to it.

682
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:08,091
You've probably heard me
playing the tape during the day.

683
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:10,131
Thank you.

684
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:13,163
And I would like to invite you
over for dinner tomorrow night.

685
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:16,037
I can't.
I work at night.

686
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:19,936
Okay, well, this weekend, too,
maybe, if you're around,

687
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:22,677
We'd love to have you over.

688
00:41:22,687 --> 00:41:25,714
I don't know.

689
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:29,317
I don't think so,
but I don't know.

690

Okay, well,
it's an open invitation.

691
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:35,890
And, again, I'm very sorry,

692
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,697

And, you know--and I know
it's selfish of me to, you know,

Say that I don't want
to see you leave me,

to call me back.

call me back if you want,

For what?

1237
01:15:59,664 --> 01:16:02,323
For the way I was,

1238
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:07,228
picking on you
and making fun of you and...

1239
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:09,902
I'm sorry I acted like that.

1240
01:16:16,609 --> 01:16:20,542
Yeah.

1241
01:16:20,552 --> 01:16:24,117
A few things
I could have done differently.

1242
01:16:26,286 --> 01:16:31,786
It was a long time ago.

1243
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:35,090
Yeah.

Can I ask you something?

<i>What's he like?</i>

1251

I mean, like...

1252
01:17:15,068 --> 01:17:20,568
What kind of person
was he before he got married?

1253
01:17:20,578 --> 01:17:27,809
Like, back in high school
when you knew him,

1254
01:17:27,819 --> 01:17:31,046
'cause, um...

1255
01:17:31,056 --> 01:17:33,051
Uh...

1256
01:17:37,023 --> 01:17:43,558
I can't imagine him,

1257
01:17:43,568 --> 01:17:49,668
you know, like,
without my mom.

1258
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:58,873
He didn't judge people.

1259
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:02,377
And he was, um--

1260
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:05,980
he was--he was smart.

1261
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:09,117
Smart, real smart,

1262
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:15,223

show off about it.

Yeah, just turned 17.

they might as well be
in something safe, you know?

I see all these parents

"you know, you're just
encouraging them to drive fast."

a great car here.

I start next week

start learning the names

1301
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:25,342
I hate spending
the holidays alone,

1302
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:28,345

my mind off it.
