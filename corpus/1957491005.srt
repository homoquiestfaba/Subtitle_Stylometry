Probably still here.

355
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:52,048
[bell dinging]

356
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,517
Who is still here?

357
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,618
Your cohorts.

358
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,654
- I'm sorry, my cohorts?
- Your posse.

359
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:01,623
My posse?
I have a posse now?

360
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:03,860
- You do.
- Cool.

361
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,329
- It's news to me.
- Yeah.

362
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:10,565
I mean, it's all
pretty explainable,

363
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,801
except for the piano.

364
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:15,838
Well, I mean,
could be a player piano.

365
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:18,740
Let's see.

366
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,978
[Nate] All right.

367
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,949
Ye... Uh...

368
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,519
You're... Okay.

369
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,462
You're just gonna stand? Okay.

370
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:45,533
- Okay. Well, it definitely was.
- Hmm.

371
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,204
But not like any that I've ever
seen. I mean, old school

372
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:50,973
players, they're pneumatic
and they have tubes and rigging

373
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,043
and stuff.
The new ones are digital,

374
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:56,178
but it would still need
a mechanism

375
00:18:56,212 --> 00:18:57,980
- to make the keys move.
- [Nate] Hmm.

376
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,515
[high-pitched twanging]

377
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:02,985
And now that I think of it,
it should have a power code.

378
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,619
But I checked while
you were at the door

379
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:05,553
and I didn't find anything.

380
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:10,492
Huh, you know a shitload
about player pianos.

381
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,693
[Andy] I've watched
an unhealthy amount

382
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,062
of <i>American Pickers.</i>

383
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,899
[Nate] Well, you know, it could
be battery-operated somehow.

384
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:19,135
Could be, but how would you
have gotten rid

385
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:21,003
of the device
and the battery so fast?

386
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,973
Oh, I mean, the posse.

387
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,607
Yeah, could have been.

388
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,043
But I didn't
see anyone grab anything,

389
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:28,177
and believe me, I was looking.

390
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,779
Oh, I believe you.

391
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,481
And the notes were so perfect.
Well done on that, by the way.

392
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,851
I mean, to play
that piece that solidly

393
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,820
would have
taken a sizable device.

394
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:43,793
Unless... you invented
a new type of player piano.

395
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,495
Uh, my garbage disposal hasn't
been working since, like, June.

396
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,098
Huh?

397
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,868
I just... I mean, it goes
like [imitating disposal].

398
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,937
Turns on, it just doesn't
really dispose of garbage.

399
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:56,538
So...

400
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,074
What's your point?

401
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:01,077
Just that I'm not very handy,
so I'm probably not the best

402
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,644
candidate for somebody who,
you know, invented some

403
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:04,180
new technology
for player pianos.

404
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:06,581
- Fair enough.
- Yeah.

405
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:11,753
- How did I know the song?
- What song?

406
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,156
The rainbow drops.

407
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,125
It's a very famous song.

408
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,863
- It's not that famous.
- It's Chopin.

409
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:24,133
Yeah, but it's classical music,
so, like, who really

410
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,868
listens to classical
music these days?

411
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:27,169
Eric did.

412
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:29,305
Okay, how
did I know about him?

413
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:31,706
- Google.
- Right, Google.

414
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,176
Best friend to all you
skeptics and conspiracists.

415
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,278
I guess you could find anything
that you want on there.

416
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:39,782
So, you actually think that I...
I what... I Googled Amanda

417
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:42,550
before she came here,
and I just stumbled across some

418
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:45,788
Facebook post mentioning her
deceased Chopin-loving husband?

419
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,723
- You've got it.
- Well, shit.

420
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:50,692
- Yep.
- [Nate] Yeah, you got me.

421
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,762
- [piano playing discordantly]
- Sorry.

422
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:55,630
I think maybe you should
go and tell everyone how

423
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:56,932
you humiliated the charlatan.

424
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:00,936
- Let me film you.
- Like one of your French girls?

425
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,604
I want to film a séance.

426
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,639
No one takes pictures
inside this house.

427
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:06,042
Please.

428
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:07,609
No one takes pictures
inside this house.

429
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:08,778
Come on, people
should see this show.

430
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,645
- People do.
- More people.

431
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,680
You know, a couple years ago,
some friends of friends

432
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:14,649
brought some people from LA,
these big producer types.

433
00:21:14,682 --> 00:21:16,684
They sat through the séance,
they loved it and they offered

434
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,821
me a network deal
that night for a show.

435
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:21,290
It was going to be like
<i>Queer Eye</i> meets <i>Crossing Over.</i>

436
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,126
The... S... You're gay?

437
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:28,596
Wh... No, that's... The point is,
is I turned them down.

438
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:31,666
Oh, you're saying
that you can't be bought.

439
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,635
No. I'm saying
that these execs,

440
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,737
they could have made millions
of dollars off of that deal

441
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,739
and they didn't even try
as hard as you are right now,

442
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,175
so I'm
wondering why you care so much.

443
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:42,644
I'm a generous soul who likes
to see good artists succeed.

444
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,114
So, you're offering
me your patronage?

445
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:46,882
By way of YouTube hits, yeah.

446
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,617
Huh. It's a pretty sweet plan.

447
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,020
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

448
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,121
There's
just one problem with it.

449
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,024
[both] No one takes pictures
inside this house.

450
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:56,591
You got it. Good job.

[glass shattering]

454
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:05,401
Delete that photo.

Whoa, butterfingers.
It's broken glass...

456
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:08,304
Delete the photo
right now, please.

457
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:10,106
What, are you in witness
protection or something?

458
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:11,673
No, it's for your own safety.
Just delete the photo.

459
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,109
- Are you threatening me?
- No, listen to me.

460
00:22:13,142 --> 00:22:14,810
It's... it's a warning.
Please delete the photo.

461
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:16,212
- Warning about what?
- Andrea, delete the photo.

462
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:18,646
All right, ca... calm down.
And it's Andy.

463
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,849
Here.

[maudlin string music]

465
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:24,987
Oh, you guys are good.

466
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,155
What?

467
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,290
You guys are fucking good.

468
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:29,624
What are you talking about?

469
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,361
Right, what am I talking about?

470
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,163
You know, the longer
you guys mess with me,

471
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:35,397
the longer I'm gonna linger.

472
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:37,133
Andy, did you delete the photo?

473
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,733
No, I will not delete
this photo until you tell

474
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,768
- me how you're doing it.
- Doing what?

475
00:22:40,803 --> 00:22:42,371
Your friend with the white
contacts skulking

476
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,039
in the background
of the picture?

477
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:45,740
I mean, I swear to God,
I won't tell anyone,

478
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:47,343
but I mean, what does he,
just, like, hang around

479
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:48,911
- and wait for someone to... Hey!
- Okay, listen to me.

480

Does your phone
back up to the cloud?

481
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:51,380
If the cloud buys it a drink.

482
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,048
- Does it or not?
- No, it doesn't.

483
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:55,184
Fine. No.

484
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,220
- That's theft.
- Yeah.

Coming from the person
who won't leave my property.

486
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:05,361
It's only trespassing
if there's a sign.

487
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:07,229
You know, this is exactly
why I don't let the press

488
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:09,198
into my freaking séances.

489
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:12,902
- Press, who's press?
- You tell me.

490
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,837
Does it actually count
as journalism if you're just,

491
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,907
you know, debunking
the occult for YouTube shows?

492
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:24,380
If you ask my father, he would
say no, that's not journalism.

number one paranormal
investigator and Australian

498
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,299
host of <i>Fact,</i>
<i>Fiction, or Folklore.</i>

499
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:46,802
Do you actually meet
people who don't recognize

500
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:48,003
you in this industry anymore?

501
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,272
Shockingly, I have.

502
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,876
YouTube-famous isn't
the same as real-world famous.

503
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:55,743
[Nate] I'm really sorry that
you have to deal with that.

504
00:23:55,778 --> 00:23:57,046
That sounds very hard.

505
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,380
I can't
imagine what that's like.

506
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:01,450
You think I'm number one?

507
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:07,022
I assume that you came
here to... humiliate me

508
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:08,857
and show the world what
a fraud I am.

509
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:11,060
No, I came here to scope
things out because you've got

510
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:14,163
two people
whose opinions I really value,

511
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:15,998
who are convinced
that you're the real deal.

512
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,399
Huh.

513
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:18,968
And they insisted
that I check you out.

514
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,103
Hmm. Remind me to thank
whoever they are.

515
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:23,505
- When did you spot me?
- [Nate scoffing]

516
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,407
Soon as you walked
through the Goddamn door.

517
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:29,278
- What, so you lied then?
- What do you mean?

518
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:31,880
You just said that you won't
allow press into your séance,

519
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:33,916
and apparently you clocked
me from the get-go.

520
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:38,454
- So, why was I allowed to stay?
- I don't know, sadomasochism.

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,157
Seriously?

522
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,528
- You wanna know?
- Yeah.

523
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:52,501
You actually
really want to know?

524
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,070
Sliding off my seat
in anticipation.

525
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,540
Russel Beetz.

526
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:01,043
Who's that?

527
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:02,544
You YouTubers
don't know anything

528
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:03,879
outside of your own use.

529
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:07,549
Russel Beetz, like yourself,
was an occult debunker

530
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,185
who was a writer, and he was
very popular in the '90s

531
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,287
and early aughts.

532
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:13,555
He fell out of fashion
when people stopped

533
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,024
reading
and started watching more...

534
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:16,525
- YouTube.
- Yeah.

535
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,562
Video killed
the occult book star.

536
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,834
Russel Beetz was a pretty
well-known skeptic,

537
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:29,038
and three years ago,
he came to one of my séances.

538
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,073
[dark choir music]

539
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:33,108
<i>He didn't give me his real
name, so I didn't even know</i>

540
00:25:33,142 --> 00:25:35,411
<i>he was there,
but something else sure knew.</i>

541
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:39,315
<i>So, we go into the ritual
like normal,</i>

542
00:25:39,348 --> 00:25:41,483
<i>and halfway through,
we make contact with this</i>

543
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:42,885
<i>participant's deceased wife.</i>

544
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:48,090
<i>I don't know why. Maybe it's
just a... a lifetime of busting</i>

545
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:50,359
<i>charlatans like me
or something, but Beetz</i>

546
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:53,262
<i>really got pissed off
and started screaming at me.</i>

547
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:55,898
<i>Pulled up to his feet
and started tearing me</i>

548
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:58,033
<i>a new one in front
of everybody, saying that,</i>

549
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,968
<i>"There's strings over here,
there's a remote for the bell,</i>

550
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:01,603
<i>and he's not
talking to your wife.</i>

551
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:03,472
<i>She's dead and gone
and never coming back."</i>

552
00:26:05,007 --> 00:26:07,943
<i>He got pissed, grabbed
the metronome, and smashed it</i>

553
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:09,044
<i>on the ground.</i>

554
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:12,147
Had that thing
since I was a kid.

555
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:16,518
Couple of years back,
I debunked a guy

556
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:20,456
on my show and he punched
me square in the face.

557
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:22,958
Yeah, Stanley Hanson.
I love that episode.

558
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:24,993
- It's my favorite.
- Rude.

559
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:28,530
So, what?
Beetz just stormed out?

560
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:31,266
No. No, hell no,
I kicked his ass out.

561
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,534
Literally.

562
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:38,207
Remind me to stay away
from your metronome.

563
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,010
Listen, it gets worse.

564
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,014
People, when they come to these
things, they... they bring

565
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:48,684
something with them. Even
the nonbelievers, something

566
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:52,388
accompanies them. When we form
the circle, we open a doorway,

567
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:55,257
and we only let through
the things we want,

568
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,959
but when the circle is broken...

569
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,128
Yeah, okay. I get it.
I broke the circle.

570
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,329
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

571
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:02,398
So was Russel Beetz.

572
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:06,201
[keyboard clacking]

573
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:13,409
[eerie chanting music]

574
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:24,987
[book thudding]

575
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:37,966
[sinister growling]

576
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,145
What'd he see?

577
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,548
I don't know.

578
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:55,384
I never spoke to him
again after the séance.

579
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,453
Well, then,
how did you hear that story?

580
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:00,122
Because the police told me.

581
00:28:01,423 --> 00:28:02,991
Right after Russel
killed himself.

582
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:04,326
Get the fuck out.

583
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:09,097
[email dinging]

584
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:18,273
[email dinging repeatedly]

585
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:24,546
[eerie growling]

586
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:29,418
[email dinging repeatedly]

587
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:37,192
Google it.

588
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:38,293
Your favorite, right?

589
00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:41,363
One week to the minute after
he interrupted that séance,

590
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:43,232
Russel was dead.

591
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:44,566
And naturally, because of our
little fight at the table,

592
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,568
the police thought
I was a suspect,

593
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,237
so they came to question me.

594
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,405
But thankfully,
I was out shopping, so there

595
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,708
was ample surveillance
footage to act as an alibi.

596
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:54,476
- Convenient.
- Yeah.

597
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,311
Anyway, after they cleared me,
I started talking to one

598
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:58,280
of the police officers about
how they found this book

599
00:28:58,313 --> 00:29:00,048
that Russel
had started working on.

600
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:04,119
Recanting all of his former
work. And apparently,

601
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:07,523
the first chapter in that book
was the story I just told you.

602
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,827
Well, sure, but he could have
made all of that up.

603
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,461
Yeah, he could have.

604
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:15,030
That wouldn't really
explain why he killed himself.

605
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:17,399
Also wouldn't explain
the photo.

606
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:19,735
What photo?

607
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,539
After they searched his house,
they looked at his computer

608
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:25,440
and they found an email
from the night of the séance

609
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,076
and there was a photo
of Russel sitting at his desk,

610
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,146
and behind him, there was
a dark figure with white eyes.

611
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:35,117
- No shit.
- Yeah.

612
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,418
[Andy] Can I see it?

613
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:39,288
I don't have the photo.

614
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,823
[Andy] What do you mean
you don't have the photo?

615
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:42,457
I mean, it was police evidence.

616
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,092
I'm just telling
you what the cop told me.

617
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:47,129
Of course
you don't have the photo.

618
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:50,132
I mean, that photo
would be indisputable proof

619
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,234
- of life after death.
- [Nate] Are you serious?

620
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:54,136
Come on, nothing
is indisputable to you

621
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,838
skeptic vultures.

622
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:58,106
I'm gonna take
that as a compliment.

623
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:00,642
I'm just saying, you know,
shows like yours would be

624
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:02,477
the first to try to
refute it and say something

625
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:05,314
like the picture was obviously
photoshopped or the cops

626
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,282
were in on the prank.
You'd say whatever you have to.

627
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:09,751
Yeah, well, you really can
Photoshop anything these days.

628
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:11,219
Okay.

629
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,058
Wait a minute.

630
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:19,361
That story was all
to explain why you don't

631
00:30:19,394 --> 00:30:21,129
allow press into your séances?

632
00:30:21,597 --> 00:30:24,801
- Yeah.
- Well, not to harp on about it,

633
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,836
but you allowed me
to stay tonight.

634
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:30,372
Yeah, I did.

635
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:31,874
[glasses clattering]

636
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:35,310
Were you hoping
that I would piss off a ghost

637
00:30:35,344 --> 00:30:37,446
and then it would follow
me home and one week later,

638
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,681
I would seppuku myself,
<i>Ringu</i> style?

639
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:42,484
I guess I was just hoping
I could convince you.

640
00:30:43,585 --> 00:30:45,220
But you know,
now that you mentioned it,

641
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:47,189
spiritualists really
do hate your show.

642
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,290
[air rushing unnaturally]

643
00:30:48,323 --> 00:30:49,458
[door slamming]

644
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:51,326
Apparently so do the spirits.

645
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,128
[dramatic music]

646
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,434
[breathy, overlapping
whispering] <i>Pick up the...</i>

647
00:30:59,468 --> 00:31:02,805
<i>Pick up the knife. Pick up
the knife. Pick up the knife.</i>

648
00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:05,173
Shit.

649
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:12,681
[knives clattering]

650
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:18,253
[wind howling]

651
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:19,354
[door thudding]

652
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:23,725
[breathy, indistinct
whispering]

653
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,560
Okay,
that wasn't fucking funny.

654
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,629
- [Nate] What?
- That door could have hit me.

655
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:29,331
[Nate] No, it couldn't have.

656
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:30,800
What do you mean couldn't have?

657
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,802
[Nate] I don't have
that kinda luck.

658
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:35,303
You know, I don't mind being
mocked in some bullshit séance.

659
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:36,405
But the moment it gets
physical,

660
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,306
that is crossing the line.

661
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,909
[Nate] Yeah, well, you know,
if you really don't feel safe

662
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,710
in my house,
you do have the right to leave

663
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:42,812
anytime you want.

664
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:45,347
Hey!

665
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,949
Just verifying
that it's broken.

666
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:48,951
Yeah, and if I was
the liar you think I am,

667
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:50,385
you could have
taken my hand off.

668
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:52,187
I don't have that kind of luck.

669
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,225
You know,
you are extremely annoying.

670
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:58,928
Oh, quit flirting with me.

671
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:01,563
I'm not flirting with you.

672
00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:04,332
You skeptics,
you drive me freaking crazy.

673
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,471
Well, comes
with the territory, chief.

674
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:11,740
[Nate] Yeah. Well, you know,
I never really wanted

675
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:13,775
to be in this territory, pal.

676
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:17,379
- [Andy] But you did.
- No, I didn't.

677
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:19,982
Yeah, you did.

678
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,820
The moment that you started
accepting money for duping

679
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:26,755
people in mourning and became
a professional spiritualist,

680
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:29,658
you entered
the realm of the skeptic.

681
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,294
Yeah, but I never
really wanted to be

682
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,762
a professional
spiritualist, so...

683
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:36,364
- [Andy] Occultist.
- That neither.

684
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,367
So, what did you want to be?

685
00:32:39,902 --> 00:32:41,403
A botanist.

686
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:43,371
You wanted
to become a botanist?

687
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,340
[Nate] Yeah, I was a botanist.

688
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:48,376
I got a degree at Berkeley,
and then I worked at UC Davis,

689
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,679
and then I got a job at
UC Riverside, and then I moved

690
00:32:50,712 --> 00:32:52,414
back to Pennsylvania, and got
a job at Carnegie Mellon.

691
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:57,352
So, you... you were really
a botanist?

692
00:32:57,385 --> 00:33:00,355
Yes. What is... Is that, like,
hard to imagine?

693
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:04,259
Prove it.

694
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:07,462
W... What?

695
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,433
[Nate sighing deeply]

696
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:14,971
Okay. Okay.

697
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:16,072
Come on.

698
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:18,707
[footsteps thudding]

699
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,609
Mm-hmm.

700
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:35,423
Boom. Botanist.

701
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,528
Huh.

702
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:40,662
Whoa.

703
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:43,833
Got any weed in here?

704
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,802
No.

705
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,307
Yeah, okay.

706
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,780
But you could just be
a nerd who likes plants?

707
00:33:57,814 --> 00:34:00,883
Yeah, it's kinda
the definition of a botanist.

708
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,018
So, yeah.

709
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:05,720
- Say something smart.
- Like what?

710
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,689
Like something only
a botanist would know.

711
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:08,958
What would that prove?

712
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:11,726
- Just do it.
- Okay.

713
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,697
Um, plants utilize an enzyme
called rubisco to fix carbon

714
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,399
dioxide from the air,
which is pretty much

715
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,467
- responsible for the...
- You are a botanist.

716
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:23,005
I... yeah.

717
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:24,807
Yeah.

718
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:26,675
I hope you approach
your occult debugging

719
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,577
with a little bit
more rigor than that.

720
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,445
You're a scientist.

721
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:31,546
Was.

722
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:35,383
Okay, I'm going to need
to hear the whole story.

723
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,919
Yeah, I don't think so.

724
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:38,988
You know, you're my
occupational nemesis,

725
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:40,755
so why would I share that
personal information with you?

726
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,024
If you tell me, I'll leave.

727
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:44,593
If I call the cops,
you'll leave.

728
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:48,697
That's true. But then
there's paperwork. So, come on.

729
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,499
Regale me with the tale
of how one goes from being

730
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,169
in the field of science
to one of science fiction,

731
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:54,736
and I'll bugger off.

732
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:57,539
Look, séances
are not science fiction.

733
00:34:57,572 --> 00:34:59,407
- Okay?
- No, they're séance fiction.

734
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,510
Okay, that was good.

735
00:35:02,544 --> 00:35:04,646
So, you get one story and then
you have to leave, okay?

736
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:08,516
Deal.
Can I have a glass of that?

737
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:15,091
- Sure.
- Thank you.

738
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,393
[footsteps receding]

739
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,497
[Nate sighing]

740
00:35:28,004 --> 00:35:29,537
[Nate muttering indistinctly]

741
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,173
[footsteps thudding]

742
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:33,608
[Nate clicking tongue]

743
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:34,709
[Nate clearing throat]

744
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:36,711
Okay.

745
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,748
So, up until 2012,
I was living the super boring

746
00:35:39,782 --> 00:35:42,584
botanist life and pretty
much loving every minute of it.

747
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:44,120
What happened in 2012?

748
00:35:44,153 --> 00:35:46,088
[Nate] <i>It's when I moved
into this house.</i>

749
00:35:48,157 --> 00:35:50,558
<i>And pretty much right away,
I started to feel</i>

750
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:52,194
<i>things were a bit askew.</i>

751
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:54,964
- [Andy] <i>Were you scared?</i>
- [Nate] <i>No.</i>

752
00:35:54,997 --> 00:35:56,933
<i>I mean, it's an old house,
you know,</i>

753
00:35:56,966 --> 00:35:58,801
<i>wood expands and contracts,
wind blows</i>

754
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,735
<i>in strange ways. Kinda...
It's par for the course.</i>

755
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:04,840
[clothes clattering]

756
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:10,679
<i>Plus, I</i> was <i>an atheist,</i>
<i>so I wasn't really</i>

757
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:11,781
<i>thinking about ghosts,
but then...</i>

758
00:36:11,814 --> 00:36:13,648
[Andy] <i>Okay, yeah, no.</i>

759
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:16,786
- Now I know this is horseshit.
- [Nate] What do you mean?

760
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:19,255
You can't honestly expect me
to believe that this

761
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:22,191
is a haunted house and
you're this atheist

762
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:24,026
turned spiritualist character,
come on.

763
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,228
Yeah, I feel like I've made
it abundantly clear

764
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:28,264
that I really don't care what
you think because this house

765
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,032
is haunted and you can't
believe...

766
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:32,201
- [plant thudding]
- What the fuck?

767
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:35,938
Don't worry.
That was not ghosts.

768
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:38,074
It's just a wonky floorboard.

769
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:42,078
- Yeah, none of it's ghosts.
- Well, some of it's ghosts.

770
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:47,716
[floor creaking]

771
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:51,287
Sorry, are my
scary stories getting to you?

772
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,822
No.

773
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:54,890
You fucking rigged that.

774
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:57,093
No, the universe just loves me.

775
00:36:57,126 --> 00:36:59,195
Uh, where was I? Um...

776
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:01,197
- Your house sucks?
- Yes, yes, it does.

777
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,033
So, my buddy Sean
was over watching TV

778
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:06,035
with me when
I first moved in and...

779
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:08,536
[TV announcer] <i>Welcome,
welcome, welcome. Well, ladies</i>

780
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,573
<i>and gents, this is the one we
have been waiting for...</i>

781
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,011
[Sean] You embarrass me, man.

782
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,547
[electric crackling,
TV shutting off]

783
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:21,549
[distant thump]

784
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,587
[TV turning on]

785
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,257
[TV announcer] <i>... go head to
head. They've been at each</i>

786
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,960
<i>other all year, there's been
a bit of trash talk between</i>

787
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:32,862
<i>them also, some of the big
players...</i>

788
00:37:32,895 --> 00:37:33,963
[electric crackling,
TV shutting off]

789
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:37,800
- Is that you?
- No, you?

790
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,268
[Sean] No.

791
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,071
[TV turning on]

792
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:45,875
[TV announcer] <i>But now,
the time for talking is done.</i>

793
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,344
<i>It is time for them
to come out on the pitch.</i>

794
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:52,281
<i>We're gonna see who
is the best team today.</i>

795
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:53,916
[eerie whispering]

796
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:55,151
- [TV thudding]
- What the fuck?!

797
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,586
[Nate scoffing]

798
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,687
[low piano note playing]

799
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:05,327
So, the ghost used
that same low piano note?

800
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:08,330
- Yeah.
- Just like Eric?

801
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:10,199
Yeah.

802
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:11,766
So, even if all this were true,

803
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:13,035
- which it's not...
- Which it is.

804
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:17,605
...how do you know that Eric
was the one playing the piano

805
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:21,077
tonight and not whatever
is haunting this house?

806
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,945
Well, okay.
I guess I don't know for sure.

807
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,014
So, even if it were all true,

808
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:26,248
- which it's not...
- Which it is.

809
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:30,319
...you, sir,
could still be a fraud,

810
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,189
because you have no
way of knowing whether

811
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:34,990
entities
are who they say they are.

812
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,060
Okay.
Yeah, that's a fair point.

813
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:39,795
Would it make you feel
better if I add that

814
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:41,696
to the whole pre-séance
disclaimer portion?

815
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,765
- No.
- Okay.

816
00:38:44,732 --> 00:38:46,202
[Andy] Continue.

817
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:49,038
So, this all happened
about a week before

818
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:50,873
Halloween and my buddy
Sean thought it'd be

819
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:52,808
a fun idea
to hold a séance and...

820
00:38:52,842 --> 00:38:54,210
Are we ready to begin?

821
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:01,016
Are there
any spirits present tonight?

822
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,985
[tense music]

823
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,026
Were you the one messing
with the TV earli...

824
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,128
[loud thump, people gasping]

825
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:13,195
Don't break the circle.

826
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:16,899
The website said not
to break the circle.

827
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:19,767
Can you please tell me that one
of you rigged the table?

828
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:27,309
Uh, okay.
What is it you want?

829
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:31,180
I... I think it has to be
a yes or no question.

830
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:33,315
- [Sean] Okay.
- [loud thud]

831
00:39:38,454 --> 00:39:40,222
- Is that a yes?
- [loud thud]

832
00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:45,828
- And a no?
- [two loud thuds]

833
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:49,265
What the fuck? Please
tell me that you are knocking.

834
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,136
I read about these
two sisters that fake

835
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,872
séances by
knocking with their toes.

836
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:01,776
Are you knocking
with your toes?

837
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,780
- Okay, very cute.
- I did... did you knock?

838
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:05,848
[Sean] Negative.

839
00:40:06,315 --> 00:40:07,383
[loud thud]

840
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:09,618
[Meredith] All right,
everyone scoot your chairs in.

841
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,787
- Don't break the circle.
- Without breaking the circle,

842
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,489
move you're chairs in,
spread your legs...

843
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:15,224
Said your mom.

844
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:17,026
...and touch the feet
of the person next to you.

845
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,328
[Sean] Okay.

846
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:22,364
[Meredith] So, whoever's foot
is on top, press down. Ow!

847
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:23,731
[Sean] Oh, it wasn't that hard.

848
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,169
Okay.
So, we're all feeling secure?

849
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:28,837
Eh.

850
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:32,274
- Spirit.
- Spirit?

851
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,009
What?

852
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:37,112
Isn't that a little impersonal?

853
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:39,481
Oh, I'm sorry, do they
have preferred pronouns?

854
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:42,918
Spirit.

855
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:47,856
Did you used
to live in this house?

856
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,295
Did you die in this house?

857
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:57,399
Are you the lease
holder of this house?

858
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:58,867
[Meredith chuckling softly]

859
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:03,738
I think it likes Nate.

860
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:05,307
Yeah, it does.

861
00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:09,812
[curious, fantastical music]

862
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:21,523
Spirit... did you used
to live in this house?

863
00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:30,432
[two loud thuds]

864
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:32,167
Did anyone's foot move?

865
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,176
Did you die in this house?

866
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,346
[two loud thuds,
low piano note playing]

867
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:47,516
Is that something different?

868
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:51,353
- [loud thud]

that very much, so he fired me.

Mm. Occupational hazard.

Yeah. Obviously, I needed to
find some other source

opened the doors to Hell House

thought about leaving?

to sell a house that people

created here and my platform

Goddamn it,
Nate, open the door

1219
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:55,978

break the fucking thing down!

- [Andy panting]
- Where's the knife?

1222
00:59:01,383 --> 00:59:03,285
It's on the ground,
I put it down.

1223
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,357
Just back off,
away from the knife.

1224
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,260
Okay, I just...
I'm trying to help you.

- Yeah.
- Did you just kick me?

I... I did, I'm sorry.

1267
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:10,098
I kick when I get scared
and you scared me.

Why would it attack me?

I don't know,
but it's definitely haunted.

Wouldn't it be great if my
posse came out right now?

It would. It really would.
How do we get out of here?

1275
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:31,320
Do you think they'd
let you open the door?

I don't know.
There's one way to find...

I don't have the keys.

What do you mean
you don't have the keys?

1292
01:04:40,589 --> 01:04:43,425
I mean the keys are upstairs
and I kind of got distracted

1293
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,293
when that thing threw me
against the wall,

1294
01:04:45,327 --> 01:04:46,194
so I don't have the keys.

1295
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:49,799
How do we get
out of this fucking house?

1296

maybe we can pray...

with a former botanist
and his stupid shaggin' wagon.

1304
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:19,261
Okay, there is a good
chance that we might die

1305
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:20,595
tonight,
but probably not in this car.

1306
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,732
- How do you know?
- I had it blessed.

1307
01:05:23,765 --> 01:05:25,434
- What?
- Yeah.

1308
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:27,302
Yeah, I thought it would
be a good idea to have

1309
01:05:27,335 --> 01:05:29,005
a, you know, portable
poltergeist panic room.

1310
01:05:29,038 --> 01:05:30,907
Couldn't really have a priest
over to the house

1311
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,842
without the house knowing,
so I drove over to a church

1312
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:33,943
and had it blessed.

1313
01:05:34,944 --> 01:05:37,579
Right, so you thought
ahead to get a portable

1314
01:05:37,612 --> 01:05:39,314
- poltergeist panic room...
- Yeah.

1315
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:41,216
...but not to hide a spare key?

1316
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:47,790
I'm sorry, Nate, what
is the point in a portable

1317
01:05:47,824 --> 01:05:50,793
poltergeist panic room
if it's not portable?

1318
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:52,294
Well, I don't know,
maybe moments like this

1319
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:53,662
it's pretty useful, huh?

1320
01:05:53,695 --> 01:05:54,964
I didn't say it was
a foolproof plan.

1321
01:05:56,398 --> 01:05:57,466
[Nate sighing]

1322
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,002
So, what now?

1323
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:02,738
I don't know, I guess we just
play games on our pho...

1324
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:10,245
Yours too?

1325
01:06:11,446 --> 01:06:13,715
It seems even
Victorian-Era ghosts know

1326
01:06:13,749 --> 01:06:15,617
how to block cell
and Wi-Fi signal.

1327
01:06:17,419 --> 01:06:19,488
And if they did work,
then trust me, I would totally

1328
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:21,423
be live-streaming this shit.

1329
01:06:22,324 --> 01:06:24,894
Yeah, you'd
be a shoe-in for a Webby.

1330
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:26,896
- And posthumously, of course.
- Yeah.

1334
01:06:40,742 --> 01:06:41,811
Perfect.

1335
01:06:44,947 --> 01:06:47,482
I did tell
you not to break the circle.

1336
01:06:47,516 --> 01:06:48,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,387
[Nate sighing heavily]

1338
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,557
Everyone said
I was gonna die in this house.

1339
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:58,027
- What?
- Yeah.

1340
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,529
It's not very supportive.

1341
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:02,464
Yeah, I know, but I guess
a lot of them were right.

1342
01:07:05,467 --> 01:07:06,535
Ugh...

1343
01:07:08,537 --> 01:07:11,406
You know... you know
what the stupidest part is?

1344
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:13,276
No, but I'd like to know.

1345
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:23,652
I think I only stayed because
I knew I wouldn't be alone.

[Andy laughing]

1347
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:31,726
Okay, thank you.

1348
01:07:32,661 --> 01:07:34,096
I think I'd rather be alone.

1349
01:07:35,564 --> 01:07:36,631
What about you?

1350
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:38,968
What about me?

1351
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:41,503
I mean, you're always such
an angry skeptic.

1352
01:07:41,536 --> 01:07:43,772
- Thank you.
- No, I'm serious.

1353
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:48,476
When I would watch your videos,
you... you just seemed... mad.

1354
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:53,983
I am mad.

1355
01:07:56,052 --> 01:07:59,354
I mean, it... it didn't
start out that way, but...

1356
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:02,424
It started out with me
just wanting to know,

1357
01:08:02,457 --> 01:08:05,061
but the more I learned,
the more frauds I uncovered,

1358
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:06,528
and the angrier I got.

1359
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:09,966
I guess
it's kind of a vicious cycle.

1360
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:13,401
Well, in your defense,
you did expose a lot of frauds.

1361
01:08:13,435 --> 01:08:15,838
Hmm. All but one.

1362
01:08:19,574 --> 01:08:21,811
[Nate breathing deeply]

1363
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:25,047
You know,
I think really, though, I...

1364
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:27,749
I just wanted to know.

1365
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:30,920
Know what?

1366
01:08:32,188 --> 01:08:33,055
That she was there.

1367
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:39,394
So, I could...
Uh, I just wanted to know.

1368
01:08:43,099 --> 01:08:44,166
She is.

1369
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:47,569
Thanks.

1370
01:08:49,571 --> 01:08:53,642
No, Andy, she is.

1371
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,011
Yeah, I know.

1372
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:57,512
No, Andy,
I'm not being metaphorical,

1373
01:08:57,545 --> 01:08:59,648
your mom is literally
here with us tonight.

1374
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:04,153
I... I told you spirits
can make objects appear,

1375
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:06,688
and I never went out and bought
some bumblebee necklace,

1376
01:09:06,721 --> 01:09:08,490
and yet all that bumblebee
stuff was all over

1377
01:09:08,523 --> 01:09:10,826
