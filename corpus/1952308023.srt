1
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,408
Colma stays out of place

2
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,712
While I take the train to a space

3
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,152
I can leave my worries
far behind me

4
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,487
If for only eight hours a day

5
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,494
I trace the lines I find upon me

6
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,463
Find my way to Serramonte

7
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,725
I can't believe

8
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,892
How much it hasn't changed

9
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,492
It goes to show

10
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,231
that Colma stays

11
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,837
And Colma stays

12
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,870
Colma stays

13
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,378
The rest move forward

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,947
I can't tell

15
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,515
What I move toward

16
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,676
I can't see the changes

17
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,685
Everybody swears

18
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,755
Are happening before my face

19
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,381
I trace the lines on the floor

20
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,586
Find my way back to Westmoor

21
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,186
I still see the teachers

22
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,697
That I sat before

23
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,960
And hated even then

24
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,471
'Cause Colma stays

25
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,969
New York just cleaned up
Times Square

26
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,980
And San Francisco
is right over there

27
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,350
Los Angeles just instated

28
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,151
A new mode of public transit

29
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,850
While Colma stays

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,760
I guess it's cool we got
a new police station

31
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,697
Next to the police station

32
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,096
Colma stays

33
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,534
Far from disaster

34
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,036
Safe and slow

35
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,629
The people leave faster

36
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,503
Wish I had a car

37
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,544
'Cause where you are
ain't very far

38
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,374
Where Colma stays

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,675
I trace the roots undefined

40
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,841
Oh, my God

41
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,714
They're tearing down Lyon's

42
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,222
Who says that there's no progression
here in Colma?

43
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,655
Can't they see the signs?

44
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,623
<i>Westlake Shopping Center</i>
<i>just got a Boston Market.</i>

45
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,126
<i>They built a multiplex next to the Toto's.</i>

46
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,697
<i>Shakey's is now IHOP.</i>

47
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,665
Colma stays next to Daly City

48
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,736
Object of ridicule and pity

49
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,862
New York's got New Jersey

50
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,498
San Francisco's got the place

51
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,076
Where Colma stays

52
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,543
I trace the roots of my sadness

53
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,615
Find my way into
the mouth of madness

54
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,412
Maybe there's a reason why

55
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,611
The world goes on and on

56
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,622
While Colma stays

57
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,351
And Colma stays

58
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,124
London's got a bustling scene

59
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,899
And Amsterdam's different
standards of a scene

60
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,005
Paris got the Louvre and Eiffel Tower

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,873
To mark its land

62
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,707
While Colma stays

63
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,441
We finally got an In-N-Out Burger

64
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,350
Next to a Krispy Kreme

65
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,282
Maybe it's a different way of living

66
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,553
But it's just the way

67
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,185
I've lived for so long

68
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,524
How can you say

69
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,531
That I'm missing out?

70
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,895
Colma stays

71
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,628
The place I was born

72
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,466
Wanting, sad, forsaken, forlorn

73
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,097
Still I wouldn't give it up

74
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,039
For anybody

75
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,941
I know nothing more

76
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,571
You hear the tone of my voice

77
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,583
Still you think
that I have a choice

78
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,052
What more can a girl
from Colma do

79
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,520
Than just accept

80
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,558
That Colma stays?

81
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,887
And Colma stays

82
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,897
Everybody has their call

83
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,894
And everyone in Colma
ends up at the mall

84
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,267
Maybe there's a reason why

85
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,006
The world will never know

86
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,048
Where Colma stays

87
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,049
Colma stays

88
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,211
Colma stays

89
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,915
And you will never know

90
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,662
Colma stays

91
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,094
Fast as a tortoise

92
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,665
Colma stays

93
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,097
Like rigor mortis

94
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,133
Colma stays

95
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,668
As popular as Tae-bo

96
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,465
Colma stays

97
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,370
But I have to go

98
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,077
Oh, Kevin will see you soon.

99
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,043
Go ahead and have a seat.

100
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,171
Okay.

101
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,649
- Billy?
- Yeah, that's me.

102
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,050
Nice tie.

103
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,624
Billy. Billy Castillo.

104
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,160
Castillo.

105
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,526
- It's Spanish.
- Castillo, right.

106
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,327
That whole double "L" thing?

107
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,400
Never made much sense to me.

108
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,665
So you just graduated
from high school.

109
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,764
Uh, yeah, last week.

110
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,308
How's it feel to you?

111
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,105
Uh, it's... it's new.

112
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,737
I mean, I've been waiting
for it for such a long time.

113
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:02,837
Now that it's actually here,

114
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,507
it just feels like
any other day, I guess.

115
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,615
I always thought that I'd
have all the answers

116
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,485
by the time I was 18,

117
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,922
and, you know, now that I'm 18,

118
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,253
I don't really feel any wiser.

119
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,453
It's just part of the big journey, I guess, right?

120
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,496
I drew those nipples huge.

121
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,198
So, yeah, big journey
and whatnot.

122
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,700
Are you going to college right away?

123
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,963
In August.

124
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,436
That's not too far away.

125
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,598
No.

126
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,233
Uh, but I can schedule
my classes around work.

127
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,450
So it says here that...

128
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,576
Where'd your tie go?

129
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,779
It's in my hand.

130
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,721
Why is it in your hand?

131
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,452
I just... You know, I thought that...

132
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,959
It's okay, leave it off. Leave it off.

133
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,528
Yeah, it was an ugly tie anyway.

134
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,120
I know, right?

135
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,496
So it says here that you were part of
Thespian Troupe 2665?

136
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,499
Yeah.

137
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,229
Thespian.

138
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,069
Yeah, we had a bumper sticker
that said "Thespians do it on stage."

139
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,199
Now, that's just juvenile.

140
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,403
I always thought so.

141
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,537
You had a paper route
before this?

142
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,740
Uh, yeah.

143
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,942
- And you want to work here?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,320
Sell me this shirt.

145
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,484
Okay.

146
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,992
Hello. Do you have any questions
about this shirt?

147
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,791
Oh, hello.

148
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,768
I was wondering if you could tell me
something about this shirt.

149
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,530
Uh, I'd be glad to.

150
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,938
What was your question?

151
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,238
Actually, I have quite a few, sonny.

152
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,974
Do you have this in a Medium?

153
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,215
Actually, sir, this is...

154
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,652
I am a woman. Don't call me sir!

155
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:56,827
Excuse me, ma'am.

156
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,556
Uh, I think this is a Medium.

157
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,131
I see.

158
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,564
You see, I have a tendency to put on weight,

159
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,796
and I was wondering
if it would shrink on me.

160
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,136
I'd say,

161
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,575
I think if you're careful...

162
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,944
You still live with your parents, huh?

163
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,175
Yeah.

164
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,047
- You don't do your own laundry?
- No.

165
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,643
It says that it's
prewashed and preshrunk.

166
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,280
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about the things you don't know.

167
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,688
That's what training is for.

168
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,558
Do you know how many fucking
mongoloids I've hired here?

169
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,860
I had a paper route

170
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,196
And I think that maybe

171
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,500
I was happy

172
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,039
I had it figured out

173
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,199
I knew someday

174
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,109
That I would be happy

175
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,114
All along, I didn't know
what it meant

176
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,047
To have it figured out

177
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,053
Just as long as I said

178
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:59,318
Things will get better
than a paper route

179
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,416
I used to go to school

180
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,824
And I think that maybe

181
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,125
I was happy

182
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,029
I know I wasn't cool

183
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,192
I knew someday

184
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,566
That I would be happy

185
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,641
But I couldn't envision
the future enough

186
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,709
To scare the dither away

187
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,838
Just as long as I said

188
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,470
Things will get better

189
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,481
It will be okay

190
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,346
- So how'd it go?
- I got it.

191
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,350
You got it?

192
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,011
You got the job?

193
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,316
- That's good.
- Yeah.

194
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,153
Congratulations, Billy.

195
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,228
When we get home,
we'll order a pizza.

196
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,057
No, just drop me off at Ro's house.

197
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:42,032
But... we're gonna order a pizza.

198
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,694
It's not that big a deal.
Just drop me off at Ro's house.

199
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:49,264
So... you think you're so cool
now that you're 18 years old.

200
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,809
You know what?
When I was your age,

201
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,778
- I was 18, and I didn't know shit.
- Julio.

202
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,643
Jesus, he's 18 years old.

203
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,151
You don't think the motherfucker
swears himself?

204
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,687
Things'll get better

205
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,385
Oh, hi, Mr. Valode. Is Ro home?

206
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,689
I don't know.

207
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,525
- Rodel!
- What?

208
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,098
Billy's here for you.

209
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,633
Tell him to come up!

210
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,209
I got the job.

211
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,675
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

212
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,439
Holy shit, man.
I get fired from my job,

213
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,411
and you get a job doing
the exact same thing.

214
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,312
You take my title of retail bitch.

215
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,146
That's right, a retail bitch
for all those consumer whores.

216
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,810
Well, Maribel's supposed
to be inviting us

217
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,444
to something later on,
and I don't know what...

218
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,079
- We should celebrate.
- Nice, what are we gonna do?

219
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,057
She says there's
this cool party tonight.

220
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,424
- Oh, someone else's party.
- Hey, you might like it.

221
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,554
There's supposed to be
a lot of girls there tonight.

222
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,189
That is the last thing I should be
thinking about right now.

223
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,200
School was such a joke

224
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:54,568
- And I'm glad to be gone
- I was happy

225
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,664
Now I'm poor and broke

226
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,236
- But I have to move on
- I'll be happy

227
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,781
I used to think that when I graduated

228
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,317
Things would blur a little less

229
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,312
I told myself that
things will get better

230
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,617
Than this whole amorphous mess

231
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,249
It will be okay

232
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,493
Things will get better

233
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,622
It will be okay

234
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,866
Things will get better

235
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,300
Hey, Billy, it's Maribel. I'm just calling
to see where you guys are at, and...

236
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,036
Oh, you're right in front of my house
and walking up to me right now,

237
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,577
so I'm gonna hang up.

238
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,738
- Which one of us were you calling?
- I called both of you.

239
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,112
- I just left a message on your voice mail.
- Yeah, we were singing.

240
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,276
We all gonna go to the party
at Chester House?

241
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,512
What the hell is Chester House?

242
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,645
Chester House!
You know, it's that house

243
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,883
where all those college kids
throw those random parties,

244
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,290
like the Super Bowl party
or the white trash party.

245
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,555
You mean there's a difference?

246
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,197
Yeah.

247
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,327
I just wish I had the structure

248
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,565
That I had two weeks ago

249
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,972
I have so many questions

250
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,442
One of them being

251
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,773
Do I look fuckable?

252
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,007
I'd switch for you.

253
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,312
- We need to lighten up, up
- And I'm glad to be gone

254
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,750
Something to swivel us

255
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,446
- I was happy
- Something frivolous

256
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,750
- You need to have some fun
- Now I'm poor and broke

257
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,452
- And I have to move on
- Get some drinks in us

258
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,152
Maybe some cannabis

259
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,492
Maybe you just need to pull

260
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,862
That stick out of your ass

261
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,861
Things have piled
to shit right now

262
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,496
But still this, too, will pass

263
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,405
No one told us that

264
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,808
The future feels about the same

265
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,744
No one told us that this party

266
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,284
Would look so fucking lame

267
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,853
It will be okay

268
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,054
Things will get better

269
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,391
So why do they call it Chester House?

270
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,623
Well, these college kids
wanted to stay near the college,

271
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,667
but the cheapest house they could rent
was in Westchester Square.

272
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,599
So they called it
Westchester House.

273
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,933
But after a while
it just became Chester House.

274
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,507
- Hmm. Chester House. That's cool.
- Isn't it?

275
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,632
- No.
- No.

276
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,735
Look, can you guys
act normal for one night?

277
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,404
- Normal.
- Act.

278
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,345
Just try and have
a good time tonight.

279
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,507
Please?

280
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,549
For me?

281
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,381
- "For me?"
- Come on.

282
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,872
21-year-old appeal

283
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,172
I can't believe how young I feel

284
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,268
And it

285
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,081
Makes me feel I'm cool as shit

286
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,519
All the nonconformists gather 'round

287
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,026
To show off, wax and blather wit

288
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,928
Everybody's cool as shit

289
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,694
Hey, what's up!

290
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,169
Hey! Show us a magic trick!

291
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,207
And no one knows
how young we are

292
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,469
We're all on the same page

293
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,239
No one knows how young we are

294
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,611
That we are underage

295
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,308
Come on! Let's do a shot!

296
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,509
None for me.

297
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,744
More for us.

298
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,421
Crash the party

299
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,786
And they'll never know

300
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,553
We're rockin' slow and steady

301
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,026
Act the part

302
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,619
And they will never know

303
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,097
I'm feeling cool already

304
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,599
Crash the party

305
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:48,503
And they will never know

306
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,973
There goes Amanda.

307
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,135
Remember, guys, act the part.

308
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,837
How the hell do you act 21?

309
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,278
Hey, Maribel, you made it!

310
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,577
Hi, Amanda! Awesome party.

311
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,515
Yeah, another college party, right?

312
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,780
- Anyway, what's up, biatch?
- Nothing.

313
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,583
Oh, I just brought my friends along.

314
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,521
This is Billy, and this is Rodel.

315
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,751
Right. So anyway,

316
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,986
there's beer in the bathtub,

317
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,789
and mixin's in the kitchen.

318
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,261
All of my roommates
are on the roof

319
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,161
testing out this red-haired sinsemilla.

320
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,290
On the roof, huh?

321
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,925
Well, I guess
they really wanted to...

322
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,128
get high.

323
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,003
- I'm 21.
- Right.

324
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,937
Maribel, come give me a hug, nigga.

325
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,833
Oh, my God, I said nigga.

326
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,536
That's such a Maribel thing to say.

327
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,444
- It is?
- Oh, Maribel, you are too cute.

328
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,846
She would have gotten the joke

329
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,383
- if she weren't so stupid.
- No, you're right.

330
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,544
The joke works on exactly two levels.

331
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,780
Come on.

332
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,652
Let's go check out
the mixin's in the kitchen.

333
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,191
Maybe I'm not cool enough

334
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,729
To understand this hipster stuff

335
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,855
Just yet

336
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,832
But there's one thing I don't get

337
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,098
I love you so much, man!

338
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,401
I don't know what
I'm doing with my life!

339
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,534
Is that what we're gonna be when we grow up?

340
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,634
What, Loud?

341
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,304
You see, that's great

342
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,018
Obnoxious seems to be my fate

343
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,959
As long as he says random things

344
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,187
With funny faces to make

345
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,992
Everything his random thing

346
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,226
There's only so much I can take

347
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,097
Well, I think he rocks.

348
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,295
In that sucky way.

349
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,701
Let's do a shot.

350
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,242
Crash the party

351
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,537
And they'll never know

352
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,271
We're rockin' slow and steady

353
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,846
Act the part

354
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,176
And they will never know

355
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,978
I'm feeling cool already

356
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,245
Crash the party

357
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,789
And they will never know

358
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,381
This party really fucking blows

359
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,927
- I can't believe you.
- What?

360
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,462
Did you guys come to this party
just to criticize it?

361
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,395
No, we came to the party
'cause we thought

362
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,229
it would be a great way
to celebrate the fact

363
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,461
that Billy got the job today.

364
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,094
Oh, my God! Billy, that's awesome!

365
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,230
Congratulations! Why didn't you guys tell me?

366
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,740
Oh, we were gonna tell you,

367
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,606
but you looked really busy
dominating the conversation.

368
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,202
And we're not criticizing the party.

369
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,337
We're just...

370
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,006
You know, criticism
implies that we have

371
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,016
some sort of evaluation
process, and we don't.

372
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,608
This party just fuckin' sucks.

373
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,415
Yeah, whatever.
Rodel, grab me three cups.

374
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,649
Three cups for your alcoholic consumption
coming up.

375
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,247
Two cups. I'm not drinking.

376
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,157
You know, it was cooler when I
could call you a fag for not drinking.

377
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,253
Now you get to hide
behind the real cool term.

378
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,956
You're straight-edged.

379
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,862
Where's the Kahlúa?
I want to make a Tootsie Roll.

380
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,992
Where's the Jack?
I want to make a Jack and Coke.

381
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,764
Where's the toilet? I want to make a stinky.

382
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,270
You're gonna shit in their toilet?

383
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,397
Yeah, I have to go.

384
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,338
Okay, we'll be here.

385
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,137
Crash the party

386
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,441
And they'll never know

387
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,073
We're rockin' slow and steady

388
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,549
Act the part

389
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,983
And they will never know

390
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,611
I'm feeling cool already

391
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,984
Crash the party

392
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,687
And they will never know

393
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,005
Is this the bathroom?

394
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,666
Yes, it is

395
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,543
You and me, let's do
a shot of straight Kahlúa

396
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,911
Is there someone in there?

397
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,677
I'm taking a shit

398
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,152
Or perhaps we feel
a shot of straight tequila

399
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,281
Maybe while I'm standing here

400
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:31,488
You could grab me
an ice-cold beer

401
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,497
Sure, give me a second.

402
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,567
Maribel, you're being beckoned.

403
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,163
You're sweating.

404
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,797
So are you.

405
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,967
You have paint on your face.

406
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,409
So do you.

407
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,740
No, I don't.

408
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,179
Oh. Well, I just came from rehearsal,

409
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,116
so I didn't have time to was the paint off.

410
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,117
You're in a play?

411
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,450
Yeah, I'm a thespian.

412
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,353
Awesome! I'm an actor.

413
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,392
I didn't think I'd meet an actress tonight.

414
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,394
Actually, I prefer to be called an actor.

415
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,793
Oh. Right. Right.

416
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,455
That whole "woman" thing.

417
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,931
That whole "woman" thing?

418
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,161
Sorry. I didn't mean...

419
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,430
It's okay.

420
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,061
I should go.

421
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,867
Can I get my beer?

422
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,202
Right! Sorry.

423
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,742
Wait.

424
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,976
Crash the party,
and they'll never know

425
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,949
Some things you can't rehearse it

426
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,920
Act the part, and they will never know

427
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,888
I'm such a stupid person

428
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,960
Crash the party,
and they're out the door

429
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,961
We're rockin' slow and steady

430
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,157
Act the part, and then we'll drink it all

431
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,461
I'm feeling cool already

432
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,967
Crash the party

433
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:50,599
And they will never know

434
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,308
- Hey, there, stranger.
- Hey.

435
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,573
I don't know about you guys,

436
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,378
but Mama's getting laid tonight.

437
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,815
By who?

438
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,750
I don't know. Somebody.

439
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,583
All the guys here have girlfriends.

440
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,786
Good. It means they won't
call me in the morning.

441
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,452
Wow. Is that what you're drinking

442
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,553
to make yourself more
attractive tonight?

443
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,859
It's what I'm drinking to make other people
more attractive tonight.

444
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,161
You don't stand a chance
of getting anybody here.

445
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,497
Just watch, Billy.

446
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,764
Rodel, all the guys here are straight.

447
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,005
Hey, how can you tell
if your roommate's gay?

448
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,077
How?

449
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,338
His dick tastes like shit.

450
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,311
That's really crass.

451
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,779
Oh, I love it.

452
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,440
I'm gonna write that down.

453
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,178
Do it.

454
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,784
You guys wanna see our reenactment

455
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,517
of Michael Madsen meeting Alex Baldwin
for the first time?

456
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,853
Yeah.

457
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:48,888
How you doing tonight?

458
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,525
How you doing tonight?

459
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:52,933
I hate Michael Madsen.

460
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,869
He played the father in <i>Free Willy.</i>

461
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,031
You know what?

462
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,302
The movie he was
in that was really good?

463
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,934
- What?
- Shut the fuck up.

464
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,239
Now, that was a good movie.

465
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,287
I'm Margaret Avery!

466
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,655
See, Daddy?
Sinners got soul, too.

467
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,228
I love this guy!

468
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,853
He's fuckin' off his nut!

469
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,591
- You've seen <i>The Color Purple?</i>
- What?

470
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,291
You've seen <i>The Color Purple.</i> Shug Avery.

471
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,837
No. I don't even know
who the fuck Margaret Avery is.

472
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,440
Something random and quirky!

473
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,033
I love this guy!

474
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,946
Everybody listen up.

475
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,142
I'm 21 years old.

476
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,879
Just like Maribel.

477
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,011
Just like Billy.

478
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,423
We were talking earlier about
how much we miss being 18,

479
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,257
because we're certainly
not 18 right now.

480
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,331
Right?

481
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,458
And we were talking about how we
used to sneak into college parties,

482
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,466
much like this one.

483
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,467
You know, you've all done it.

484
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,471
And I see all of you, us,

485
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,564
desperately clinging
on to our high school years

486
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:07,167
back when it was cool and subversive
to flip off the camera.

487
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,747
And we're all still a bunch
of geeks and losers, right?

488
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:10,940
Am I right?

489
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,448
I don't know about that.

490
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,520
So, when I see us acting
all hip and shit,

491
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,520
I can't help but think to myself

492
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,385
Could

493
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,753
We

494
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,883
Oh, no, he's singing.

495
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,554
Get any older?

496
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:29,532
Our youth is just slippin' away

497
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,536
We're tryin' real hard to act the part

498
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,698
I'm sure that we'll be cool someday

499
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:41,108
This one looks like he still
lives at home with mom

500
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:45,172
And this one took his best friend
as a date to the prom

501
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,376
And this one smells like feet

502
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,613
And really likes to eat

503
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,383
How could you not love this guy?

504
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,688
- Rodel.
- Could we get any older?

505
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,819
Get any older

506
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:01,228
I think that we can die right now

507
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,531
Underneath the cool facade,
we're still real odd

508
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,663
We're major fuckin' dorks, and how

509
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:13,267
This one looks like she needs
to wear a push-up bra

510
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,903
And this one goes
to the Renaissance Fair

511
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:21,318
You've got all
the <i>Buffy</i> episodes on DVD

512
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,650
Because you wished
you looked as skinny as her

513
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,919
Could we get any older?

514
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,755
I don't think so

515
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,558
You're hanging on to your youth

516
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:37,294
You act real cool
like you never ditched school

517
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,667
But everybody knows the truth

518
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:45,436
You throw parties every week
just to pass the time

519
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,139
And then everybody leaves
for you to clean up the grime

520
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,511
And then you're stuck at home

521
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,140
All alone

522
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:57,688
Wishing you could find a man

523
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,590
Could you get any lamer?

524
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:06,494
I'm sorry
if I'm sounding blunt

525
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:10,659
But if you can't hang
with what I just sang

526
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,202
You can shove it

527
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,272
Up

528
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,068
Your

529
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:22,875
Cunt

530
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,793
Just kidding! God, Take a joke!

531
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,059
Fucking lesbians!

532
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,259
I'll take it from here.

533
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,063
I'm real sorry, gentlemen. Nice party.

534
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,762
You know, I can walk, you know.

535
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,237
Just 'cause I'm drunk doesn't mean
that I can walk... or not walk.

536
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,239
Come on!

537
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,902
I am so sorry. He gets like this.

538
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,410
So you know he gets like this,

539
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,104
and you brought him
to my party anyway?

540
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,806
Well, at least he didn't kick anything.

541
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,178
One day, I'll find my happy place

542
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,016
Maybe one day then I'll find a person

543
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,181
Who can curl up in my arm

544
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,815
Come on, Billy, sing with me.

545
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,952
No, I'm tired. Get off the car.
I want to go home.

546
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,654
You know the words.
Sing harmony. 3, 4...

547
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,858
One day, I'll find my happy place

548
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,491
And maybe then I'll find...

549
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,332
I forgot the fucking words

550
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,406
I forgot the words, Billy.
What are the words?

551
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,872
Fucking words

552
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,067
Come on, sing harmony.

553
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,007
Yeah, I really want
to do this right now.

554
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:31,173
I know it lies somewhere
beyond the clouds

555
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:35,218
And oh, dude, where
my heart is stopping

556
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,314
I don't care, I know that I'll be there

557
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,155
One step at a time, yeah

558
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,697
I'll climb to the highest point

559
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,926
- I know that if I try
- Harmony!

560
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,559
I'll fly

561
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,970
So high you won't believe
what I can do

562
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,041
Kick!

563
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,769
It's true

564
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:03,576
My happy place
is waiting in the sky

565
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,173
And I can meet you there...

566
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,712
Woman, you fucked up my song.

567
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,255
I had fun tonight.

568
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:25,962
Billy, I'm drunk, and I'm pissed.

569
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,902
You know, if we were
in Britain right now,

570
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,530
you would have
sounded so redundant.

571
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,302
Oh, my God, Rodel!

572
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,240
It was one thing for you to get drunk

573
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,971
and start snapping
at people at the party,

574
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,140
but then you get all karaoke
on everyone with my car alarm?

575
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,341
That was the fun part.

576
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,215
And you. You're sober,
and you encouraged him!

577
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,982
Sorry, Maribel. We didn't mean
to mess up your night.

578
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,682
We meant to mess up our own.

579
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,589
We keep forgetting that everything
revolves around you.

580
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:50,956
What?

581
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,463
Maribel, he's drunk.
It's the alcohol talking.

582
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,295
You're a fuckin' bitch Maribel.

583
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,063
Jesus, Ro!

584
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,934
That's the alcohol talking, too.

585
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,336
I'm sorry, Maribel.

586
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,667
It's okay.

587
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,070
No, I mean it.

588
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,302
- I hate you.
- What?

589
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,308
I hate you?

590
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,844
Not I hate you.

591
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,642
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Maribel.

592
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,240
You really are off your nut, you know that?

593
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,185
I had fun getting drunk

594
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,086
and singing show tunes
on top of your car.

595
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,250
Fag.

596
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,922
Call you tomorrow.

597
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,861
Okay. Good night.

598
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,113
You sure you're okay to drive?

599
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,518
Pretty sure.

600
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,318
You can always crash here.
My parents don't mind.

601
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,121
- That might be a good idea.
- Okay.

602
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,521
Come on.

603
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,409
Shit!

604
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,375
Oh, my God! I'm fuckin' drunk!

605
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,708
Yeah, you are.

606
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,745
You know, Joanne used to do this, too.

607
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,079
Oh, really?

608
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,711
Yeah, she had this way of pinning me
up against the car.

609
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,619
Something like this. Come here.

610
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,962
Kinda like that, with one leg.

611
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,899
I think she thought
she was being sexy.

612
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,368
Wow. That's hot.

613
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,029
Yeah, I always liked that.

614
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,300
She did it me one time after rehearsal.

615
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,670
Got old pretty fast.

616
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,869
Dude, I gotta go home.

617
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,037
Give me my keys, biatch.

618
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,679
You know, I'm glad you're straight-edged.

619
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,777
Why?

620
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,687
'Cause if you were drunk tonight,
I'd never hear the end of Joanne.

621
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,189
God! You scared the shit out of me.

622
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,231
Go to sleep. It's 3 in the morning.

623
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,730
So how was the party?

624
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,771
Go to sleep.

625
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,737
Hey...

626
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,399
did you get any pussy?

627
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,704
Dad, don't ask me that.

628
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,940
A father can't ask his own son
if he got any pussy?

629
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,380
You didn't take your meds today, did you?

630
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,008
Jesus Christ!

631
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,883
Just 'cause I ask you a simple question
about the party...

632
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,684
Never mind! Go to sleep!

633
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:32,534
<i>You have one new message</i>
<i>and 18 old messages.</i>

634
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,874
<i>Hello. This is Gary Nottingbird</i>
<i>calling from Theater Peninsula.</i>

635
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,971
<i>I'm calling for Billy Castillo.</i>

636
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,710
<i>I just reviewed my notes</i>
<i>from your audition the other day,</i>

637
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,480
<i>and I wanted to call and make sure</i>
<i>you're still interested in the part,</i>

638
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,021
<i>which we do want to offer you.</i>

639
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,089
<i>We just want to know</i>
<i>what your availability was.</i>

640
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,763
Rodel! Michael is here!

641
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,099
- Rodel!
- What?

642
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,676
Michael is here!

643
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,568
Hey, Ro.

644
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:23,281
- You want eggs?
- Fuck, yeah!

645
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,321
I never really liked him anyway.

646
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,118
I mean, I know I never
said anything, but...

647
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,249
Yeah, but I could tell.

648
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,917
Which is fine 'cause I hated Joanne.

649
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:33,155
- Well, we're even, then.
- Yeah.

650
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,732
I told him I was
perfectly fine being single.

651
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,891
I'd never been happier.

652
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,263
Never?

653
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,462
Nope.

654
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,233
Well, there was that one time
my family told me I was adopted.

655
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,501
Doesn't really count, though.

656
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,134
A month later, they told me
they were just kidding.

657
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,507
Jesus, that's fucked.

658
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,241
Yeah. Happy times.

659
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,140
Remember when I auditioned
for <i>Friend Joseph?</i>

660
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,219
Yeah.

661
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,684
- I got a call yesterday.
- Yeah.

662
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,118
I got the part of Jerry.

663
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,917
Holy crap!

664
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,719
My parents are still asleep.

665
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,623
You got cast in <i>Friend Joseph?</i>

666
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,025
- Yeah.
- As who?

667
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,687
- You remember the play?
- Yeah.

668
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,196
You remember Jerry?

669
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,823
The quirky Jewish
second-banana sidekick?

670
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:10,992
- Yeah.
- That's you?

671
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,592
- That's me.
- Oh, my God!

672
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,603
You're the quirky Jewish
second-banana sidekick.

673
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,536
I totally thought
they were gonna cast me

674
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,938
in the flamboyant gay role.

675
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,306
There's a difference?

676
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,709
I'm so happy for you.
Oh, my God!

677
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,474
Who did you get cast as, the gay guy?

678
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,106
No, I got cast as Jerry.

679
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,014
I though he was the gay guy.

680
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,882
No, he's the quirky Jewish sidekick.

681
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:33,445
Yee! I'm so excited for you!

682
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,185
Thank you.

683
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,063
It's just kind of depressing.

684
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,098
Why?

685
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,429
I don't know.

686
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,436
19 just sounds so much closer
to becoming a grownup.

687
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,197
And you're not a grownup?

688
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:54,142
No. I just want to look like a grownup
so I can get alcohol.

689
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,310
It's not just that. I kind of feel

690
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,747
like I've been clinging onto high school
since we graduated.

691
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,515
So that's why you've gotten
so much louder ever since.

692
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,589
Fuck you.

693
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,419
I'm just kidding. Go ahead.

694
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,288
I mean, high school...

695
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,656
Keep it down. I'm right here.

696
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:13,923
Can I talk now?

697
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,759
Yeah, go ahead.

698
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,198
High school, to me, was a place

699
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:22,033
where you didn't have
to make very many choices.

700
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,834
At least not
important ones anyway.

701
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,738
Now that we're out of high school,

702
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,937
I feel like that image I had of high school
was just an image.

703
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,310
Everybody thinks that
about high school.

704
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,043
Not Billy. And to an extent, not you.

705
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,812
You know,

706
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,820
I always thought Billy would
make it somewhere, though.

707
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,583
Somewhere real big.

708
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,714
Not you?

709
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,191
No, I used to dream about it, but...

710
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,785
As long as I have whatever I write, I'm happy.

711
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,488
You know, you really
should buy a journal.

712
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,691
It beats writing your ideas
down on scraps of paper.

713
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,631
Yeah. You know,
I lost one of those scraps of paper

714
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,964
in my room somewhere, by the way.

715
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,439
That's very Emily Dickinson
of you, by the way.

716
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,016
Um, hi.

717
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,449
I was wondering if you knew

718
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,110
where the rehearsals
for <i>Friend Joseph</i> were?

719
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,688
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

720
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,051
Oh, you're in the play, too, then.

721
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,352
Yeah. I'm Tara.

722
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,653
Tara. I remember you.

723
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,594
You were the one at the party
at Chester House.

724
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,460
Yeah? Which one?

725
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,329
Well, uh, you were in
a Polaroid on the fridge.

726
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,232
You were the one
flipping the camera off.

727
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,367
Hey, you're that sweaty guy
from the bathroom.

728
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,738
Great. That's how you remember me.

729
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,107
Well, yeah. I felt really bad.

730
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,045
I wanted to find out where you went,
but then I had to go.

731
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,480
You were gonna look for me?

732
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,709
Well, yeah.

733
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,115
I gave up on you, though.

734
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,447
Figured I lost you.

735
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,753
I'm not so sweaty now.

736
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,025
You're Filipino. You know
what would happen.

737
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,463
I don't know. My cousin came out to her dad,
and she's fine.

738
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,795
Jim's in prison.

739
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,494
Imagine the heartache
my dad would go through

740
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,195
if he found out his good son's a fag.

741
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:05,173
Okay, honestly,
I don't know how he could not know.

742
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,607
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

743
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:07,973
I'm just saying.

744
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,478
You've never had a girlfriend,

745
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,549
and Michael's been sleeping over
for the past two years.

746
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,345
I just told him you're my girlfriend.

747
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,080
- You fucker!
- Hey, I had to.

748
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,849
I feel so used.

749
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,947
Admit it, you're flattered.

750
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,083
Well... yeah.

751
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:28,257
So, um, what's the surprise
you have for me and Billy?

752
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,531
Holy shit! Those I.D. S look real!

753
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,125
Don't they?

754
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,135
You go in first.

755
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,762
We both go in.

756
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,378
Couple of 40s, you know?

757
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,319
Get something cheap for us.

758
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,323
Ahem. I'm 21.

759
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,055
May I see your I. D?

760
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,918
7.50.

761
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,965
What the fuck, dude?
Do I look old?

762
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,497
Wow. I didn't realize
this is going to be such a big deal.

763
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,838
It is <i>Friend Joseph.</i>
There's really no other way to do it.

764
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,913
Well, l... I better
get to my car.

765
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,641
Okay.

766
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,546
Did you want to walk me to my car?

767
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,743
Yeah, sure.

768
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,849
Well, this is my car.

769
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,290
That wasn't far at all.

770
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,521
No.

771
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,153
We're holding hands.

772
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,233
Yeah. Now I'm kissing.

773
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,428
Tara, I kinda recently got
out of a bad relationship.

774
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,664
It's just a kiss.

775
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:16,933
Okay.

776
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:34,146
There's only one name on my mind

777
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:39,218
It's left my other thoughts behind

778
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,323
A name that's soft and kind

779
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:47,370
Tara

780
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:54,343
She won't be like the other girls

781
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:59,382
She won't make all my fears unfurl

782
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:03,317
Her name is such a pearl

783
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,151
Tara

784
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,658
It's happening

785
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,128
I feel it

786
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:18,600
I know she's the one for me

787
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,604
Tara

788
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:27,337
Tara

789
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:34,373
We are so mature for our age

790
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,205
Who's that?

791
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,775
What are you guys doing here?

792
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,571
Maribel's got a surprise for you.

793
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,736
What is it?

794
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,642
Remember that picture
you gave me three weeks ago?

795
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,408
Dude, we're in a fucking bar!

796
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,974
I know, and I'm having my first drink.

797
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,111
I made Maribel get me something light.

798
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,210
Okay by me.

799
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,915
God, I'm fucking happy having a drink!

800
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,549
A drink! Singular.

801
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,993
So, uh, who's that girl
you were kissing a while ago?

802
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,086
Her name is Tara.

803
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,530
She plays the ingenue in <i>Friend Joseph.</i>

804
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,625
Whoa. Dating from
within the cast?

805
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,795
Well, not necessarily. I told her

806
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,736
that I'd just got out of a relationship.

807
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,966
Why'd you say that?

808
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,269
'Cause I did.

809
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,604
Yeah, like, three months ago.

810
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,144
That's pretty recent.

811
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,145
Yeah, well, we didn't
see you stop kissing her.

812
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,976
Wait. We?

813
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,607
You and Maribel saw?

814
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,380
Yeah. Maribel was the one
who pointed you out to me.

815
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,813
Drink up, niggaz!

816
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,555
Dude, check out that guy over there.

817
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,961
I love him!

818
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,430
You mean Hulk Hogan?

819
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,228
That's fucked up!
Don't call him Hulk Hogan.

820
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,666
Dude, I'll call him what I want.

821
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:05,105
Damn. Maybe you should
slow down on that beer there.

822
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,840
I want another one.

823
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,914
Yes, you do.

824
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,389
- What?
- Is Ro home?

825
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,018
No, he's out.

826
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,693
Good.

827
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,861
Look at you,

828
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,532
coming in here with a bloke on each arm.

829
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:41,168
Well, what can I say?
I'm a lucky gal.

830
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:46,011
Shit! I'd say those two bastards
are the lucky ones.

831
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,584
Are you all swingers?

832
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,779
Yes.

833
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,948
No, we're just friends from high school.

834
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:57,824
Good. This isn't exactly
a couples bar, you know,

835
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,988
much less a triples bar.

836
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:04,329
This is a bar where some
of the people can commiserate.

837
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,131
Well, single is what we are.

838
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,762
The ancients say that Cupid

839
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,741
Shot his arrow through the air

840
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:17,109
Indiscriminately, just shooting

841
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,012
Arrows without a care

842
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,745
If I saw an infant with wings

843
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:26,482
Just randomly dealing death about

844
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,956
Well, I'd kick that flying baby's ass

845
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,620
And then I'd tear his wings out

846
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,963
Oh, good-bye, Cupid,
we bid farewell

847
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,968
To you

848
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,231
We've made up our minds

849
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:46,537
There's nothing you can do

850
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,669
No more tears, no more games

851
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,806
We're through with it all, ta-ta

852
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,781
No battle of sexes

853
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,011
We're through with out exes

854
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,419
So good-bye, stupid, <i>au revoir</i>

855
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,650
You know, this is
my first time drinking,

856
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,693
and I don't think
I've ever felt so free.

857
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,955
Atta boy! Here's the aspirin of love.

858
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:10,727
I one had a girl who made me feel all at once

859
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,495
At ease

860
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:17,267
And somehow simultaneously had me on

861
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,932
My knees

862
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:22,307
She met my cousin,
and then there wasn't

863
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,313
A time when she
had enough space

864
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:29,875
And I caught my cousin
wearing her crotch on his face

865
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,420
Cheating cunt!

866
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:36,755
Oh, good-bye, Cupid,
we bid farewell

867
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,589
To you

868
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,061
We've made up our minds

869
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:45,261
There's nothing you can do

870
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,497
No more tears, no more games

871
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,768
We're through with it all, ta-ta

872
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,240
Whatever we fear

873
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,106
We'll drown it in beer

874
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,739
So good-bye, stupid, <i>au revoir</i>

875
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,942
Champagne for my real friends,

876
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,246
and real pain for my sham friends.

877
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,719
That's a great quote.
Who said that?

878
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,313
I don't know. I probably did.

879
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,790
How can you not know
if you originated a phrase?

880
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,121
I lose track.

881
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:15,028
Besides, originality
is the art of hiding your sources.

882
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,360
Who said that?

883
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,763
Something I made up.

884
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:21,031
I once had a boy
who made me believe

885
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,596
I was the world

886
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,438
Saccharine sweet,
he said such things

887
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,944
That would make you hurl

888
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,537
I think he's gay.

889
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,980
He cheated once,
I was fine with that

890
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,645
But my personal things got attacked

891
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,415
And he stole money
out of my pockets,

892
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,785
pawned my dad's gun,

893
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,358
gaffled my secret stash of money,

894
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,620
and sold my entire
collection of DVDs...

895
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:46,628
For crack

896
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:53,095
Oh, good-bye, Cupid, we bid farewell

897
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,034
To you

898
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,572
We've made up our minds

899
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:01,701
There's nothing you can do

900
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,906
No more tears, no more games

901
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:08,109
We're through with it all, ta-ta

902
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,583
No sex where we stand

903
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,381
But we still got our hands

904
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,979
So good-bye, Cupid, <i>au revoir</i>

905
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,822
The exes are gone,
the breeder's upset

906
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,328
The faggot has had enough

907
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,422
Did you hear us, we've had enough

908
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,936
Everybody fucking sing!

909
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,805
Oh, good-bye, Cupid

910
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,743
We bid farewell

911
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,076
To you

912
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,241
We've made up our minds

913
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:45,720
There's nothing you can do

914
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:49,189
No more tears, no more games

915
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,989
We're through with it all, ta-ta

916
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,426
No battle of sexes.

917
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,157
We're through with our exes.

918
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,664
I can't believe that he took her.

919
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,166
I'll buy you a hooker.

920
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:04,104
So good-bye

921
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,765
Stupid, <i>au revoir</i>

922
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,117
How can I not see that car there?

923
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,644
You like it?

924
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,115
What, you mean it's mine?

925
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,618
Me and your mom bought it for you.

926
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,849
Go ahead. Get inside. Try it out.

927
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,559
I really wasn't expecting this.

928
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:08,995
You like it?

929
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,930
It's awesome!
Thank you so much.

930
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,969
No problem. You deserve it.

931
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,886
Rodel!

932
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,317
Ro, what the fuck happened?

933
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,980
Michael came to my house today
and told my dad everything.

934
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,616
What do you mean everything?

935
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,456
Everything!

936
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,730
How many people can tell you

937
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,240
That they know you so

938
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,538
Much more than you know?

939
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:33,705
And how many times
do you tell yourself

940
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,808
Nobody will

941
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,387
Or can feel your woes?

942
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,550
Every year I lose a part

943
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,594
Of my heart to the world

944
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,259
And narrowing down to the core

945
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,167
Of my quaint little world

946
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,944
The sides of the polygon change

947
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:06,709
And the number of points
in the shape rearrange

948
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,683
My circle of family

949
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,447
Friends and acquaintances

950
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,318
Is diminishing

951
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:18,190
Triangles stay the last shape

952
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,284
I know you think

953
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,522
Crazy is what

954
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,722
You only know

955
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,765
That's just not true

956
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,929
Crazy is what?

957
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,973
Tell me this day ended

958
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,372
The whole way with you

959
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,511
If you really think

960
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:40,378
That I would fare better

961
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,780
With somebody

962
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,046
Who claims to be some picture

963
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,645
Of sanity

964
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,815
Then I need you to be someone

965
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,722
Who can be

966
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,727
Crazy like me

967
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,389
Crazy like me

968
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,523
Crazy like me

969
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,420
Billy.

970
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,672
How are things going for you here?

971
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,215
Uh, fine.

972
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,545
Everything's fine. Why?

973
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,620
Well, l...

974
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,244
I'm just gonna spit it out.

975
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,186
You've been working here
for two weeks already,

976
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:58,352
and I'm thinking of having you
train for the register.

977
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,224
Wow. Okay.

978
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,662
Billy, this is more than okay.

979
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,324
This shows I have trust in you.

980
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,062
I don't just put any fucking mongoloid
on the register.

981
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,467
This is a big deal.

982
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,061
Well, that's stupendous, sir.

983
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,572
However...

984
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,199
and I'm gonna have
to level with you here...

985
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,870
I've noticed you've already
requested two days off

986
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:16,968
in the last two weeks.

987
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,843
Yeah, that's for my rehearsals.

988
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,779
See, we have a set schedule
for rehearsals.

989
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,784
But there isn't a set
schedule here, so l...

990
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:24,319
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean

991
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,649
we don't have
a set schedule here?

992
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,279
You get the printed
schedule the week of.

993
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,756
Yeah, but l... I need more notice than that.

994
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,349
I mean, it's hardly a set schedule.

995
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,292
It changes every week.

996
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,523
All right, how many more
days off in the future

997
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,065
do you think you're
gonna be requesting?

998
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,134
I don't know. I mean,

999
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,758
I guess whenever
my schedule here

1000
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,030
clashes with my rehearsals.

1001
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:44,368
That was the wrong answer.

1002
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,135
So what are you saying
I should do?

1003
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,233
Well, I think you should either

1004
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,142
make arrangements with
your theater people,

1005
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:53,682
or... and I'm not trying to sway
your decision or anything here...

1006
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,616
but you should go with us.

1007
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,211
Any mongoloid would know
it's the right choice.

1008
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:04,921
Since you stay with your parents,

1009
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,962
is there really any reason
for you to have this job?

1010
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,223
Yes, I need this job.

1011
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,424
I would go crazy
if I didn't have this job.

1012
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,194
Well, maybe you can get
a different job

1013
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,099
- that allows you to...
- Babe, I need the job.

1014
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,138
I need the money.

1015
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,106
I'm saving up for something big.

1016
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,268
Saving for what?

1017
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,845
Something big, okay?

1018
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,777
You know, it's the best paying shit job

1019
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,348
I can get right now.

1020
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,441
- Sorry if I'm being nosy.
- You're not being nosy.

1021
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,588
Joanne, she was nosy.

1022
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,519
Hey, what's up with that party
we're going to tonight?

1023
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,392
Yeah, it's a networking party.

1024
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:45,491
There's gonna be writers and actors
and directors and even some bands.

1025
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:46,534
Nice. That sounds cool.

1026
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:47,568
Yeah, we're thinking about

1027
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,864
bringing my cards
with me... you know,

1028
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,564
pitch myself to these directors.

1029
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,970
Wow. I should do that, too,

1030
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,372
'cause they're always
looking for more actors.

1031
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:56,274
Actually, I was thinking about
bringing some of my plays, too.

1032
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,040
People want writers
just as much.

1033
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,582
Yeah, but they're a dime a dozen.

1034
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,615
You know, I really like
what you've done

1035
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,215
with your character, by the way.

1036
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,554
You've really made it your own.

1037
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,026
Thanks. You know,
I'm pretty proud of it.

1038
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,426
You know, it's
a new <i>Friend Joseph,</i>

1039
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,999
so I figured, why not
create a new Jerry?

1040
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,500
I wanna be known
for this version of Jerry.

1041
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,536
How's Rodel doing?

1042
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,971
He's all right.

1043
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,803
I don't think that
he likes me very much.

1044
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,969
- Why would you say that?
- Just a feeling.

1045
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:30,170
Like whenever he's around,

1046
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,611
there's this really subtle vibe that,

1047
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,773
you know, if you're
not sharp, you'll miss it.

1048
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,385
I thought I'd find you here
with orange chicken.

1049
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,786
Dude, I like orange chicken.

1050
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,289
Yeah, I know. But that's not orange chicken.

1051
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,691
That's deep-fried, Westernized
Chinese versions of chicken nuggets

1052
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,955
in orange sauce.

1053
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,861
- Dude, orange colored sauce.
- I know, right?

1054
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,160
Hi, Rodel.

1055
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,464
Hey, how'd the flyering go?

1056
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,663
Uh, like, five
neighborhoods, I think.

1057
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:56,739
Yeah, I did five neighborhoods.

1058
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,330
Damn. Nice.

1059
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,602
We should have a good audience
for opening night, at least.

1060
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,235
By the way, I am doing your laundry
from now on.

1061
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,041
Um, weird. Okay.

1062
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,513
Why?

1063
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,208
I need the practice.
See, I need to look

1064
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,910
at tags and labels
so I could tell customers

1065
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,543
how to wash their own clothes.

1066
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,952
So you want to experiment
with my clothes.

1067
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,957
He just wants more clothes
to wash than he already has.

1068
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,617
Hi. Guess who I was talking to.

1069
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,863
Oh, I gotta go.

1070
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,159
- See you.
- See you at home, man.

1071
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,426
- I'll see you at home.
- Bye.

1072
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,133
- So...
- Hello?

1073
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,267
Hey, Maribel.

1074
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,572
No, sorry, my phone's on vibrate.

1075
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,510
Uh, no, I'm at the cafe right now.

1076
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:39,980
I was just talking to Billy.

1077
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,243
No, nothing much, really.

1078
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,182
Just, uh, you know, eating.

1079
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,184
Bye, Ro.

1080
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,254
Oh. "Bye, Ro."

1081
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,913
Yeah, suddenly she knows me so well.

1082
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,354
Yeah, she can call me Ro.

1083
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,450
I mean, she leaves her food here
for other people to clean up.

1084
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:52,493
So fucking self-centered.

1085
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:53,687
Are you talking about me?

1086
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,627
Oh, now she thinks
I'm talking about her.

1087
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,324
Yeah, whatever.

1088
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,492
Now she's walking away like a freshly-fucked
fucking prostit...

1089
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:01,570
Hello?

1090
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,349
Do you know what today is?

1091
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,483
Thursday.

1092
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,858
Did you want to be alone today?

1093
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,692
Yeah.

1094
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:29,696
Good.

1095
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,767
I came just in time.

1096
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,098
Deadwalking quietly

1097
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,194
Through the graves

1098
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,570
The grass of the graveyard

1099
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:41,337
Beneath my feet

1100
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,344
Everyone sleeping

1101
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,710
I feel the hush

1102
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,215
My heart steady pulsing

1103
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,912
The only beat

1104
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,286
These are the main
Colma residents

1105
00:59:55,391 --> 01:00:00,419
For this is
the true population now

1106
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,361
Graveyards and tombstones

1107
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,933
To dot the hills

1108
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,934
There's more of them dead

1109
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,334
Than alive in town

1110
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:15,776
Come dance with me

1111
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:22,080
Till the sun

1112
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:25,780
Goes down

1113
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,692
That's where my mom's buried.

1114
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,233
I know, right? What do you say to that?

1115
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,700
I know.

1116
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:45,740
I feel like I could say, "Oh, wow,"
or, "Oh, really?"

1117
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:48,276
But it'll sound fake.

1118
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,278
Why fake? 'Cause you're not really interested?

1119
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,574
No.

1120
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,979
It's not 'cause I'm not interested.

1121
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,314
It's just kinda heavy.

1122
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,352
Yeah, it's always easier

1123
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,978
to walk around the heavy stuff.

1124
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:03,786
Do you want to visit your mom?

1125
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,020
Now you're just trying
to prove something to me.

1126
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,222
No, I just figured
that since we're here...

1127
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,094
Nah.

1128
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,791
Are you sure?
Because we can go...

1129
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,163
Let it go.

1130
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,603
This is my future main residence

1131
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:26,774
Just deadwalking
nowhere and everywhere

1132
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:31,115
No one and everyone
knows your name

1133
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:36,385
And nothing and everything
in the end

1134
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:40,826
We will be resting beneath the soil

1135
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,924
And flying so high
up above the clouds

1136
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:50,267
Nothing too heinous to worry us

1137
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,739
And nothing bad, either

1138
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:55,470
To cry about

1139
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:02,715
Come dance with me

1140
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:07,688
Till the sun

1141
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:12,159
Goes down

1142
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:18,995
You know, I always figured we'd all move in
together at some point.

1143
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:22,629
Yeah, I always thought it might be
kind of cool if we all did.

1144
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,173
Well, you're living with Billy now.

1145
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,333
How's that?

1146
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:28,842
I'm so grateful.

1147
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,776
I really am.

1148
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,404
I just think it might be cooler

1149
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,346
if we all moved in together, you know?

1150
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,678
I know.

1151
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:38,583
Still living in his parents' house.

1152
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,883
Yeah, that feels awkward.

1153
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,448
You know, just having piles of my clothes
lying around his room.

1154
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,084
Just clothes?

1155
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,720
I never got the rest
of my shit from my dad.

1156
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,167
Are you going to?

1157
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,164
I don't know.

1158
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:01,366
I don't want to talk
about that right now.

1159
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,775
Okay. Let's drop it.

1160
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,078
Let it go.

1161
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:23,263
Deadwalking quietly

1162
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,266
- Through the graves
- This is my future

1163
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,700
- Main residence
- The grass of the graveyard

1164
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,034
- Beneath my feet
- Just deadwalking nowhere

1165
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,437
- And everywhere
- Everyone sleeping

1166
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,033
- I feel the hush
- No one and everyone

1167
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,112
- Knows your name
- My heart steady pulsing

1168
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:40,011
- The only beat
- Nothing and everything

1169
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:42,516
- In the end
- These are the main Colma residents

1170
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:46,418
- We will be resting beneath the soil
- For this is the true

1171
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:49,320
- Population now
- And flying so high up

1172
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,586
- Above the ground
- Graveyards and tombstones

1173
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,924
- To dot hills
- Nothing too heinous

1174
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,488
- To worry us
- There's more of them dead than alive in town

1175
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,364
Nothing bad, either, to cry about

1176
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:05,133
Come dance with me

1177
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:09,905
Come dance with me

1178
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:14,711
Come dance with me

1179
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:19,516
Come dance with me

1180
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:25,458
Come dance with me

1181
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:30,294
Till the sun

1182
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:34,529
Goes down

1183
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,377
By the way, Maribel?

1184
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:43,376
What?

1185
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:44,673
Happy Birthday.

1186
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,690
- Hey.
- Hey.

1187
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,031
Oh, l... I washed
all of your clothes.

1188
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,035
Wow, thanks.

1189
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,538
No, um...

1190
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:12,573
You know your black shirt?

1191
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:13,869
Yeah.

1192
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:18,708
You took my black shirt
and made it look like

1193
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:20,873
some kind of fucked up sock puppet.

1194
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,276
Hey, you want to come with us

1195
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:25,513
to that networking party tonight?

1196
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,350
- A who?
- It's a networking party.

1197
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:30,289
There's gonna be, like, actors and directors,
and writers there.

1198
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,951
It's actually called
a networking party?

1199
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,426
How shameless is that?

1200
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,588
Most people try to disguise it by calling it

1201
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,222
a tsunami benefit or something.

1202
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,960
Yeah, it's pretty
to-the-point, I guess.

1203
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:41,127
Dude, we're taking Maribel out for her birthday.

1204
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,332
- Did you forget?
- No, I didn't forget.

1205
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,911
I just sort of planned
everything really poorly.

1206
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,775
- You forgot.
- Yeah, I forgot.

1207
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,439
Dude, it's okay.

1208
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,107
There'll be more networking parties.

1209
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,787
What makes you think
I'm not going?

1210
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,619
I don't know, Billy. Maybe because Maribel's
one of your best friends.

1211
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:03,885
Oh, come on. Don't give me that.

1212
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,291
Do you think I can afford
not to be seen at this party?

1213
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,454
You can't afford not to be seen at this party?

1214
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:10,122
No, I can't!

1215
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:22,274
Well, if he can't, he can't, you know?

1216
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,176
Yeah, I mean, he says he's sorry.

1217
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,441
Okay.

1218
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:31,144
You don't sound okay.

1219
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,448
He could have called me himself.

1220
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:34,580
He never flakes.

1221
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,588
Well, I mean,

1222
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,124
it was an emergency
rehearsal, you know?

1223
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:40,024
I mean, he had to get on the road
as soon as he got the message.

1224
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,290
Plus his cell phone's dead.

1225
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:45,629
I had to come and relay
the message for him.

1226
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:47,259
Interesting.

1227
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,945
Wow. Didn't expect
to see you here.

1228
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,483
Yeah, that party was pretty lame.

1229
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:04,246
It was less like
schmooze and booze,

1230
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,878
and it was more like
booze and snooze.

1231
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,219
Tara made some contacts,

1232
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:12,726
and some director wanted
to put me in his Latin play.

1233
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,796
It was pretty lame.

1234
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,865
Probably should have
gone with you guys.

1235
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,729
Probably would have been more fun.

1236
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:24,972
How's Maribel?

1237
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,804
Did you hear me? How's Maribel?

1238
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:35,042
I told her you had
an emergency rehearsal

1239
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,846
- and that your cell phone is dead.
- Nice.

1240
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:39,182
She still seemed really sad
that you weren't there.

1241
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,518
Jesus Christ,
you gave her that story,

1242
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,524
and she still laid a guilt trip on you?

1243
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:44,593
How self-centered can you get?

1244
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,354
We got, like, four weeks until we open.

1245
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,765
Yeah, well, you should call her anyway.

1246
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,856
She's visiting L.A. For a week.

1247
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,628
Yeah, I probably should.

1248
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:56,936
Hello.

1249
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,006
Hi, baby.

1250
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,572
Yeah?

1251
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,405
Good.

1252
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,877
I had a wonderful time.

1253
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:13,914
Yeah.

1254
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,254
"Tara and Billy, the perfect match.

1255
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,095
"I've got a match:
His face and her ass."

1256
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,193
"Both have their sights
on the stars and the sky.

1257
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,397
It's their excuse to have their noses so high."

1258
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:31,734
Why'd you write this?

1259
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,138
Where'd you get that?

1260
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:35,676
- From your pocket.
- You go through my fucking pockets?

1261
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,269
Are you gonna be the type of dad
who reads his kids' diaries?

1262
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,247
How dare you you!
How dare you write this shit!

1263
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,475
What, do you think it's not true?

1264
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,516
I'm going to bed, Billy.

1265
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,353
I need to wake up early
so I can pass out your flyers.

1266
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:05,499
So, uh, this isn't as big
as I thought it was gonna be.

1267
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,235
It's not big.

1268
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,504
I mean, it's pretty big
for a regional theater, but...

1269
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,045
God, the way Billy's
been talking about this,

1270
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,637
I kinda expected something...

1271
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,239
- bigger.
- Word.

1272
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,818
Hey, it's Billy!

1273
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:18,147
Oh, he's looking for us.

1274
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:20,979
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

1275
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,088
Everybody, this is Maribel,

1276
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:27,458
and this is my bestest
friend in the world, Rodel.

1277
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,622
This is Gary, the director.

1278
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:30,721
- You guys know Tara.
- Hi.

1279
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,164
And this is John. He helped flyer.

1280
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,860
In all kinds of crazy neighborhoods.

1281
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,698
- Rodel helped flyer, too.
- Cool.

1282
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,795
Sorry, I'm gonna have
to cut this short.

1283
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,636
I have to tend to
the rest of the actors.

1284
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,437
It was really nice meeting you.

1285
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:44,135
- I'm gonna go help Gary.
- Okay.

1286
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:45,577
Enjoy the show.

1287
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,670
Hey, thanks.

1288
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,340
Dude, don't be catty.

1289
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,417
What?

1290
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:52,247
Oh, and before I forget.

1291
01:09:58,827 --> 01:09:59,851
Cool. Thanks, man.

1292
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:02,396
Hey, it's the least I could do
after all those flyers you passed out.

1293
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,489
Now get back in there and change.

1294
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,498
Oh...

1295
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:06,659
You should go soon?

1296
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:07,895
I should go now.

1297
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,001
Did he just pay that guy in front of you?

1298
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,870
Yeah.

1299
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,536
- Did you count a hundred dollars?
- I did.

1300
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,704
And how much did Billy
pay you for flyering?

1301
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:19,872
Well...

1302
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,948
jack shit.

1303
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,349
Oh, man.

1304
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,682
Oh, man.

1305
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,350
- What?
- Don't look now,

1306
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,484
but when you can,

1307
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,187
look who's in line to see the show.

1308
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:39,660
Oh, man.

1309
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:51,611
Opening number

1310
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,113
A musical show

1311
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:54,682
There isn't anyone in here

1312
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,512
That you'll really know

1313
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:57,984
Regional theater

1314
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,554
Wouldn't you know?

1315
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:02,647
We're starring in a musical show

1316
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:06,057
Playbills say that this show is a rage

1317
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,560
Clever and witty

1318
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,130
And only off stage

1319
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:10,664
Let's stop with the fodder

1320
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,290
Continue the show

1321
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:15,564
It's time for us to meet Friend Joseph

1322
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:29,581
- I love you
- I know 'cause you're telling me in song

1323
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:30,879
I love you

1324
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:34,149
Even though we haven't
known each other long

1325
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:38,454
- I love you
- It's been, what, 15 minutes, if that

1326
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,394
- Oh, I love you
- What the hell, I love you, too

1327
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:45,524
Hope neither one of us

1328
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:49,661
Dies

1329
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:51,364
I am not the lead

1330
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,670
And I am standing here to say

1331
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,302
Despite the way I come across

1332
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,677
I really am not gay

1333
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:02,307
I'm just quirky, quirky, quirky

1334
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,148
I'm so whimsical and quirky

1335
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,745
I'm supporting-actor quirky

1336
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:10,518
I'm so quirk, and I'm not gay

1337
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:13,060
I am quirky, quirky, quirky

1338
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,824
So damn quirky, quirky, quirky

1339
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,525
I'm the best-friend kind of quirky

1340
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:22,365
And again, I am not gay

1341
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,938
- Hey, Joseph!
- What?

1342
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,802
Did you hear the one
about the musical theater actor

1343
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,808
who tried to tell a funny joke on stage?

1344
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:28,808
No.

1345
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:32,076
Thank you very much.

1346
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,615
I am quirky, quirky, quirky

1347
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:37,413
So damn quirky, quirky, quirky

1348
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,579
I'm supporting-actor quirky

1349
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,089
I'm so quir-ky

1350
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,422
I am quirky, quirky, quirky

1351
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,223
So damn quirky, quirky, quirky

1352
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:53,526
Oh, Jerry. I shall always have
a special place in my heart for you.

1353
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:54,863
But you won't have me.

1354
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,996
Oh, Jerry. My heart belongs to someone else.

1355
01:12:58,107 --> 01:12:59,404
Oh, Joanne.

1356
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,725
Don't. I swear to God.

1357
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,386
I'm sorry, okay? It slipped out.

1358
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:24,432
I saw her in the audience,
and it just slipped out.

1359
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,797
Billy, I used to hope
that I could go one day

1360
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,062
without you mentioning
her fucking name.

1361
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,432
Do you know that?

1362
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:35,207
I told you I got out
of a bad relationship.

1363
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,800
I never said I wanted anything.

1364
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,639
No, you never said a thing.

1365
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,095
Tara never really
believed in the Grail.

1366
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,158
How can you fuckin'
joke about this?

1367
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,169
'Cause it <i>is</i> a fuckin' joke.

1368
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,769
Whatever, dude. We'll talk later.

1369
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,465
No, we probably won't.

1370
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:24,605
Why?

1371
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:29,984
Why?

1372
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,049
Why?

1373
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:40,161
Why, Rodellio?

1374
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,467
I hate you!

1375
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,170
I hate you!

1376
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,410
- Hey.
- Hey.

1377
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,419
If you want to put
those in my car...

1378
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:40,419
It's okay.

1379
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:41,682
You're not that far away.

1380
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,314
I'll just walk to your house.

1381
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:45,357
Wait.

1382
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,553
Let him, Billy, please.

1383
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:50,626
Is he okay?

1384
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,029
He'll be fine.

1385
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:01,442
He'll be okay.

1386
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,340
What'd you buy?

1387
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,881
- Wine?
- Yep.

1388
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:11,111
Guillermo Maria Castillo,
you bought wine?

1389
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:14,882
Well, I had to use that fake I.D.
You gave me, right?

1390
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,720
Now I'm in dire need.
This needs to be open now.

1391
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,292
Yay for metal twist caps.

1392
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:25,391
I could never be a wine taster.

1393
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,961
I guess you can't,
'cause this sure as hell don't taste like wine.

1394
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:38,378
Am I that horrible a person?

1395
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,005
Well, you've always been
a smug little prick.

1396
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,674
You think I'm kidding?

1397
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,649
No, I'm laughing
'cause I know you're not.

1398
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,182
It's cute when you swear.

1399
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,156
You gonna pass that over,
Swiggy Marley?

1400
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:57,322
Sorry.

1401
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:10,336
There's only one
name on my mind

1402
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:15,314
It's left my other thoughts behind

1403
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:19,353
A name that's soft and kind

1404
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,615
Maribel

1405
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:24,419
Tara

1406
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:25,720
Joanne

1407
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,886
She won't be like the other girls

1408
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:30,396
She won't be like the other girls

1409
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,957
She won't make
all my fears unfurl

1410
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:35,593
She won't make
all my dreams unfurl

1411
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:39,572
Her name is such a pearl

1412
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:42,006
Maribel

1413
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,578
Tara

1414
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:47,773
- Joanne
- It's happening

1415
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,317
- I feel it
- Joanne

1416
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:54,718
I know she's the one for me

1417
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:57,656
Maribel

1418
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:02,795
Maribel

1419
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:09,933
We are so mature for our age

1420
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:15,065
I don't know what you thought that was.

1421
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:17,145
It was a kiss.

1422
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:18,678
Sweetie...

1423
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,906
What?

1424
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,847
Want to hear something I wrote?

1425
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:32,985
A diatribe?

1426
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:34,823
A what?

1427
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,090
Nothing.

1428
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,222
Go ahead.

1429
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:52,038
"Colma stays.

1430
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:53,114
"Land of cemeteries,

1431
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,547
"car dealerships, and schools.

1432
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,175
"Nary a thing I haven't done in Colma.

1433
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,720
"Maybe I'll come back
again some day.

1434
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:03,052
"I leave the lines far behind.

1435
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,626
"Find my future
sparkling and shiny.

1436
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:06,887
"Maybe there's a reason why

1437
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,828
"the world goes on and on.

1438
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:13,059
- That's really nice.
- "Good-bye land of sand and fog.

1439
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,728
"Good-bye, Daly City smog.

1440
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:19,204
"And good-bye to the house
I lived in since I was a kid.

1441
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:21,707
"Maybe I know just
what you meant to me.

1442
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:25,405
"That's nothing and everything
all at once."

1443
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,281
You looked really happy

1444
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,223
when you came back
from L.A., by the way.

1445
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:41,124
- I got laid.
- It's not just that.

1446
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,662
You had a glow about you.

1447
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,295
You ever think about moving to L. A?

1448
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,165
L. A?

1449
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:51,466
That's just as bad
as moving to New York.

1450
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,371
Whatever, man.
You'd be out of Colma.

1451
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:57,937
Nah.

1452
01:21:58,046 --> 01:21:59,411
Can't.

1453
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:02,375
Why not?

1454
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:14,388
Billy says you're
too rainbows and unicorns for L.A.

1455
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,555
- What the fuck does he know?
- Right?

1456
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,656
You know, the night of your birthday,

1457
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,632
he didn't really have rehearsal.

1458
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:22,862
You know, I kinda figured.

1459
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:23,995
I made that up.

1460
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,164
You made that up?

1461
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,674
Yeah, he actually didn't want to go.

1462
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:32,042
He tried to drag me to some stupid
networking party with Tara.

1463
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:33,375
I told him, "It's Maribel's birthday"...

1464
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:34,880
So you knew that night,

1465
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,746
but you didn't tell me the truth.

1466
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:39,376
It was your birthday.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

1467
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:40,920
But you'll hurt my feelings now?

1468
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,284
I figured you should know.

1469
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,984
Why tell me now?

1470
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,493
Why tell me at all?

1471
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:48,823
'Cause you don't like Billy anymore,

1472
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,329
you figure it's okay
to hurt my feelings?

1473
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,059
Would you rather I didn't tell you at all?

1474
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:55,827
I don't know.

1475
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:58,098
It's cool.

1476
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,503
Never mind.

1477
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,775
Listen, things got out of hand.

1478
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:04,970
Things were said.

1479
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,479
Basically, everybody's at fault here.

1480
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:07,479
Yeah.

1481
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:09,311
Everybody.

1482
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:10,884
So you're mad at me.

1483
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,283
No.

1484
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,547
I'm fine.

1485
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,257
I don't believe that.

1486
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,916
Well, if I am,

1487
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:19,823
maybe I'll tell you next week.

1488
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:50,148
You know those rare days
when there's no fog

1489
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,988
and you can see clear
out past the city limits

1490
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:56,530
and you can't help but notice
the San Francisco skyline

1491
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,462
and you realize
how close we actually are

1492
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:00,727
to a major metropolis?

1493
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:02,928
And I wonder, you know,
when the fog clears,

1494
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,700
do people in San Francisco
notice us?

1495
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:08,207
I mean, why would they, right?

1496
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,709
The most they would see
from over the hills and fog

1497
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,302
would be this flat land

1498
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,780
with a bunch of houses all lined up

1499
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,249
in sort of a wavy grid.

1500
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:20,549
Or maybe it could be
something somber and tragic,

1501
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:23,453
when all they see
are a bunch of graveyards.

1502
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:25,549
They can't see the little things that make us

1503
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,128
so much different from the city.

1504
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,663
I mean, kids play
in huge groups in the street.

1505
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:32,960
People have driveways.

1506
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,059
Neighbors have barbecues
in their backyards.

1507
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,105
People fuckin' have backyards.

1508
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,367
Yeah, and then
there's the fog.

1509
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:42,807
When it's thicker
than your average mist,

1510
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,674
and you can see it
rolling in on the city

1511
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:48,271
like a huge lumpy blanket.

1512
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,146
When I was small,
I would stand on this hill

1513
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,651
and watch as the sunny sky
turned to fog

1514
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:55,951
as it rolled over and through me.

1515
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,025
And I would pretend
that I was being carried

1516
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:00,026
on the grassy hump
of a flying city,

1517
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:03,689
slowly breaking through the clouds
as we soar off into the horizon,

1518
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:06,858
and my city in the clouds
taking me somewhere better.

1519
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,102
Yeah.

1520
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,868
Then the fog clears,

1521
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:16,535
and the grass around my feet
is moist with dew,

1522
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:18,612
and...

1523
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,544
the sun burns off
whatever mist is left,

1524
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:22,013
and, you know,

1525
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,846
I can see the skyline
of San Francisco

1526
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,886
way off in the distance...

1527
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,181
and I'm happy.

1528
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:59,212
One day I'll find my happy place

1529
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,050
And I ain't gonna
share nothin' with you

1530
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,625
'Cause you've got your own

1531
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,690
You have your own

1532
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,933
One day I'll find my happy place

1533
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:18,528
And I'm determined
that I'm never gonna find

1534
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,665
My way back out

1535
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,671
My way back out

1536
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:31,216
I know we'll lie somewhere

1537
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,219
Beyond the clouds

1538
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,653
And open air

1539
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,952
My heart is stopping

1540
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:39,321
I don't care

1541
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:41,987
I know that I'll be

1542
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:44,030
There

1543
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:47,192
One day I'll find my happy place

1544
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:49,532
And maybe then I'll find a person

1545
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:52,367
Who can curl up in my arms

1546
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,466
In my arms

1547
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:03,173
I know we'll lie somewhere

1548
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:05,309
Beyond the clouds

1549
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,217
And open air

1550
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:09,620
My heart is stopping

1551
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:11,316
I don't care

1552
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:13,951
I know that I'll be

1553
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,996
There

1554
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:19,225
One step at a time

1555
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,268
I climb

1556
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,837
To the highest point

1557
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:27,101
I know that if I try

1558
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,438
I'll fly

1559
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:32,342
So high you won't believe

1560
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:35,382
What I can do

1561
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:37,713
It's true

1562
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:40,811
My happy place is waiting

1563
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,856
In the sky

1564
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,187
And I

1565
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:47,727
Can meet you there

1566
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:04,197
- Hey.
- Hey.

1567
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,143
I'm leaving.

1568
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:10,642
I know.

1569
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:12,406
Where are you going?

1570
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,344
New York.

1571
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:15,643
Wow.

1572
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:18,710
Yeah, I'm taking the bus.

1573
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:21,379
What are you gonna do there?

1574
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:27,455
Don't know.

1575
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:31,196
Why New York?

1576
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:34,796
L... I don't know. I don't really have

1577
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:36,995
any good reasons
for anything I do.

1578
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:38,868
That's very Rodel of you.

1579
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,438
L... I don't see how,
but okay.

1580
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:51,440
Are you okay?

1581
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,214
Yeah, I'm fine.

1582
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,984
When did the whole
New York thing come up?

1583
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,930
Remember when I moved
into Maribel's?

1584
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:07,694
I took my bags over to her house?

1585
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:09,394
I think that night

1586
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:12,166
was the first time I realized

1587
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:15,572
that I am unhappy.

1588
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:25,079
I told Maribel the reason
you didn't come to dinner that night.

1589
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:28,312
Oh.

1590
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:29,651
Yeah.

1591
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:36,622
And the poem that I wrote?

1592
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:41,925
I wrote that intentionally for you to read,

1593
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:43,367
and I had it folded up

1594
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:45,530
and sticking out of my pocket
on top of the laundry

1595
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,130
'cause I knew you'd find it there.

1596
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:49,869
Why would you do that?

1597
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:52,745
I don't know, Billy.
Maybe because I'm unhappy?

1598
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,712
I don't have any reasons
for anything I do.

1599
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:08,791
I'm leaving.

1600
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:11,763
Yeah, I see that.
You look packed.

1601
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:13,333
Yeah.

1602
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:14,765
Finally moving.

1603
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:19,031
Where to?

1604
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,767
San Francisco.

1605
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:23,343
Oh, the city.

1606
01:31:23,444 --> 01:31:25,173
A whole five minutes away.

1607
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:28,472
Don't mock me.

1608
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:31,852
No, I'm not mocking you.

1609
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:33,250
I just...

1610
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:34,412
It's convenient, you know?

1611
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,615
You can see your mom and dad
whenever you want.

1612
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:55,633
I should get going.

1613
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,977
E-mail me when things get better.

1614
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:38,184
I never said I needed
to be loved by you

1615
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:42,489
I never said I needed to be loved

1616
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,660
I guess I came across
as needy anyway

1617
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:51,859
At least needy enough

1618
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:57,327
So maybe all of them
just didn't need to hear

1619
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:01,764
Maybe they just knew

1620
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:04,902
Maybe they felt

1621
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:06,411
That I needed

1622
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:08,641
The space to be filled

1623
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,377
That was once filled by you

1624
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:16,220
But maybe, maybe this time

1625
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:18,622
I realize

1626
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:20,819
Something new

1627
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:26,230
Maybe I'm finding out

1628
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,165
For myself

1629
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:31,898
Without being told

1630
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:35,442
Maybe I know

1631
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:37,875
Just what you meant

1632
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:41,380
To me

1633
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:43,677
That's nothing

1634
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:45,513
And everything

1635
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,680
All at once

1636
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:54,156
To my friends

1637
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:56,559
I thank you all

1638
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:59,098
You make me who I am

1639
01:34:01,602 --> 01:34:03,832
What I think

1640
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:06,406
What I choose

1641
01:34:06,507 --> 01:34:08,737
Because of you, I can

1642
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:13,307
You're the ones

1643
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:15,905
Who fill the space

1644
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:18,383
You're the ones that I need

1645
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,477
You are the ones

1646
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:24,387
That I look for in times

1647
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:27,757
Of my darkest need

1648
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:30,630
But maybe

1649
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:35,498
Maybe this time I can leave all

1650
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:39,039
All on my own

1651
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:42,132
Maybe I have the reason

1652
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:44,871
To finally step forth

1653
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:49,473
And fearfully grow

1654
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:52,780
What is it I'm hanging on to

1655
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:54,718
Here in Colma?

1656
01:34:54,822 --> 01:34:56,619
I think I know

1657
01:34:57,992 --> 01:35:00,426
That's nothing

1658
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,257
And everything

1659
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:08,632
All at once

1660
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:11,432
I can take whatever fits inside my car

1661
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:16,098
I can start anew

1662
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:20,837
I let go of all the things that hurt me so

1663
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:25,510
I let go of you

1664
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:30,354
I have bigger, brighter
things ahead of me

1665
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:34,988
I see brighter days

1666
01:35:36,797 --> 01:35:39,925
Everything fits in my car

1667
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:42,662
I'm taking it all

1668
01:35:44,105 --> 01:35:47,768
But Colma

1669
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,103
Stays

1670
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:00,279
Colma stays

1671
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:01,718
Land of cemeteries

1672
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:03,619
Car dealerships and schools

1673
01:36:03,724 --> 01:36:07,353
There's nary a thing
I haven't done in Colma

1674
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:10,555
Maybe I'll come back again one day

1675
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:12,859
I leave the tracks far behind me

1676
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:15,731
Find my future
sparkling and shiny

1677
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:18,304
Maybe there's a reason why

1678
01:36:18,405 --> 01:36:20,430
The world goes on and on

1679
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:21,803
While Colma stays

1680
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:24,667
And Colma stays

1681
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:30,175
Good-bye land of sand and fog

1682
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:35,882
Good-bye, Daly City smog

1683
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:40,716
Good-bye to the house I lived in

1684
01:36:40,828 --> 01:36:43,319
Since I was a kid

1685
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:45,022
And Colma stays

1686
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:47,962
Yes, Colma stays

1687
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:51,794
Colma stays

1688
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:57,867
But I have to go

1689
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:46,224
I know you don't know how to feel

1690
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,921
Believe me, I am in the dark

1691
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,829
Everyone involved is asking

1692
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:56,368
What do we make of all of this?

1693
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:59,064
Why does the future look so stark?

1694
01:38:01,342 --> 01:38:03,970
Everyone involved is asking

1695
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:05,238
Who are you?

1696
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:06,608
What happened?

1697
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,944
It all looks so damned crystal clear

1698
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:10,175
Where are we?

1699
01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:11,512
Why ask it?

1700
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:14,315
All you should know
is that we're here

1701
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:16,582
All of the questions that you ask

1702
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:18,783
I'm sure that I can't answer

1703
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:21,020
I can't answer anything

1704
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:22,356
You ask me here

1705
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:24,488
And as the credits roll

1706
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:27,158
I walk alone

1707
01:38:27,268 --> 01:38:29,429
Teetering on the edge of

1708
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:32,061
I don't belong

1709
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:34,538
Constantly on the verge of

1710
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:38,840
I won't have any answers

1711
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:41,210
I can't answer anything

1712
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:42,612
You ask me here

1713
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:44,581
And as the credits roll

1714
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:49,349
And when we hit the daylight

1715
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:51,981
I will be, he will be

1716
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:55,687
You will be

1717
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:57,923
One step at a time.

1718
01:38:58,032 --> 01:39:00,193
I can't answer anything

1719
01:39:00,301 --> 01:39:01,393
You ask me here

1720
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:03,834
And as the credits roll

1721
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:07,600
I walk alone

1722
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:09,869
Teetering on the edge of

1723
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:12,411
I don't belong

1724
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:14,981
Constantly on the verge of

1725
01:39:15,082 --> 01:39:19,485
Spinning unfinished questions

1726
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:21,577
I won't answer anything

1727
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:22,917
You ask me here

1728
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:24,923
And as the credits roll

1729
01:39:25,025 --> 01:39:28,324
I walk alone

1730
01:39:28,429 --> 01:39:30,226
As the credits roll

1731
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:33,357
I don't belong

1732
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:35,196
As the credits roll

1733
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:39,671
I see the starting point

1734
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:44,540
Every moment has a moment
following the last

1735
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:49,548
You were so experienced
in what follows the past

1736
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,244
Don't pretend to know the answer

1737
01:39:52,353 --> 01:39:54,753
And I'll do the same

1738
01:39:54,855 --> 01:39:56,049
Don't be glib

1739
01:39:56,156 --> 01:39:58,886
And I will promise
not to play the game

1740
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:03,623
The time is now

1741
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:08,566
- As the credits roll
- The time is now

1742
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:13,800
- As the credits roll
- The time is now

1743
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:18,742
- As the credits roll
- The time is now

1744
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:24,113
- As the credits roll
- The time is now

1745
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:25,549
The time is now

1746
01:40:25,652 --> 01:40:26,812
The time is now

1747
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,285
The time is now

1748
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:30,687
- The time is now
- We have to do that again.

1749
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:34,819
That's so fun!
