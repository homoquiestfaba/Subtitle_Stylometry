00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,989
(soft piano music)

3
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,756
(soft jazz music)

4
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,766
- How are you holding up?

5
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,001
- Better than I thought.

6
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,269
- It's not the end
 of the world, is it?

7
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,372
- No, it's not the
 end of the world.

8
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,475
(cell phone buzzing)

9
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:24,912
Hello?

10
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,381
(crackling voice)

11
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,249
Hello?

12
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,250
- Sam.
 - Hello, Mom?

13
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,584
- [Cecilia] Sam,
can you hear me?

14
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,153
Sam, where are you?

15
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,788
I need you.

16
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,156
- Something's wrong.

17
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,191
I can feel it.

18
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,259
- Sam, Sam!

19
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,593
Where are you going?

20
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,794
Where are you going?

21
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,630
Wait, wait, wait
 where are you going?

22
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,864
Tell me what's happening?

23
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,499
I thought we were
 past all this shit.

24
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,768
- Something's
 wrong, I have to go.

25
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,371
- What about the press,
 what about all your friends?

26
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,305
- Tell them I'll be back.

27
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,139
- Hey, hey!

28
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,642
After all the shit
 I've been through

29
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:55,476
to help you get
 to where you are.

30
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,977
You walk out on me?

31
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,246
You're walking out on us.

32
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,483
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

33
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,327
- [Alex] I told you I'm not
dealing with this shit anymore!

34
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:14,662
- Ma, just call him, please!

35
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,266
- [Alex] What's up,
 baby, it's okay.

36
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,199
- What's going on?

37
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,669
- Dude, I'm over this shit, man.

38
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,170
- [Sam] What'd he do?

39
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,338
- I told her I'm not gonna
 deal with this shit anymore.

40
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,240
He's never gonna
 fucking change, okay?

41
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,542
You don't know the shit that

42
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,943
he's fuckin'
 rollin' in, alright?

43
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,178
He's gonna end up fucking
 somebody else over

44
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,980
and we're gonna end
 up paying for it.

45
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,881
Fuck that!

46
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,815
It's okay, baby.

47
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,816
It's okay, we're going home.

48
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,255
- [Sam] I'll see
you later, okay?

49
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,890
Alright, I'll call you later.

50
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,558
- Do not call me
about this shit!

51
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:46,527
I'm done.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,368
- Ah, shit!

53
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,439
(grunting)

54
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,273
Damn it!

55
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,176
Sam, Sammy!

56
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,745
That you?

57
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,213
Come help me out here.

58
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,382
(speaking foreign language)

59
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,950
- Dad, what's going on in there?

60
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,220
- I don't know, I don't care.

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,054
Come on, papa.

62
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,289
- I got you.

63
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,357
- Hurry up, I'm
 late for my shift.

64
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,190
- [Sam] Here.

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,258
- Good, thank you.

66
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,126
- [Sam] Sure.

67
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,060
- [Bill] Alright.

68
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,094
- Can I get you anything?

69
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,262
- No, no, no, no, no.

70
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,834
Just, (laughs)
 have fun with that.

71
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,504
Alright, I'm leaving.

72
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,739
- [Cameron] Leave me alone.

73
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:32,973
- [Cecilia] We are
 not calling him.

74
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,174
- Ma, just call him,
 it's the only way

75
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,175
to get these people
 out of my life!

76
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,109
- What the hell happened to you?

77
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,811
- Hey Sam, I fell skateboarding.

78
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,447
- Oh yeah, you skateboard now?

79
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,280
- Tell him.

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,549
- Nothing!

81
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:42,683
Look, are you gonna
 take the car or not?

82
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,617
- What car?

83
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,386
- Forget about the fucking car!

84
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,587
Tell him!
 - Oh my God!

85
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,422
You people make me
 sick, literally sick!

86
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,357
- Chill out!

87
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,224
- Baby, baby we need their help.

88
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,059
- He's doing heroin.

89
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,727
- I'm not doing heroin!

90
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,329
- Oh no, then why
 do you keep taking

91
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,230
little pieces of
 aluminum foil, huh?

92
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,500
Those fevers you get,
you think I'm an idiot?

93
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,502
And you better bring me
back my wedding ring!

94
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,770
- What are you
 talking about, ma?

95
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,104
I didn't take your ring!

96
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,373
- Oh yeah, because I was the one

97
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,174
who broke the lock
 to my door, right?

98
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,279
- Cameron, I really hope
you're not doing heroin.

99
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,147
Do you know how that shit
 changes your physiology,

100
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,649
like literally changes you?

101
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,851
- Relax, geez man, I know.

102
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,886
Okay?

103
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,187
I know.

104
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,589
This nigger thinks
 he's the only one

105
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,791
that can look shit up on Google.

106
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,059
Besides, I haven't been
doing it for that long.

107
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,661
- So you have been doing it!

108
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,929
- Mom, mom, mom, stop!

109
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,431
Hold on, mom, mom, mom, mom!

110
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,699
Mom, mom, mom, stop!

111
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,266
Mom, calm down!
 - I swear to God!

112
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,668
- Calm down, calm down.

113
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,904
Alright, everyone calm down.

114
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,972
- Michelle, are you gonna
 take the car or not?

115
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,207
- Oh, my God.

116
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,309
- I already told you,
I'm not going anywhere!

117
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,744
- What car?

118
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,278
- Don't worry about
 it babe, okay?

119
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,548
They always do what
 I want them to do.

120
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,485
My friend's car, bro!

121
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,920
- Alright, well
 go take it to him!

122
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,422
- I would, but it stalled on me

123
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,156
and something that was
in the car went missing!

124
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,891
- What went missing?
 - Okay?

125
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,759
I don't know!

126
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,960
- [Sam] You don't know?

127
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,161
Then how do you know
 it went missing?

128
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,663
- Because it was
 in the car and then

129
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,764
(clapping) then it wasn't!

130
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:04,665
- That is what he's asking you.

131
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,900
What was in the car?

132
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,003
- It was a white box, Mom, but
 I don't know what was in it!

133
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,607
- Cam, do you have this box?

134
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:14,808
- No, look!

135
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,977
Mike and I were
 using the car, okay?

136
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,579
- Who's Mike, is he
 the owner of this car?

137
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,880
- No, he's Bosco's brother.

138
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,814
- Bosco?

139
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,550
Is Bosco the owner of this car?

140
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,751
- Yes!

141
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,285
I dropped Mike off
 but on my way to Bosco

142
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,054
the car stalled,
it wouldn't run!

143
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,489
- Alright, then tell him that.

144
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,023
- Did you forget
 about the part where

145
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,225
something went missing
 from his car, Sam?

146
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,360
You're supposed to
 be the smart one!

147
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,194
- Hey!

148
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,930
- It's fucking Bosco.

149
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,865
- Shut up!

150
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:39,900
- Why, who is he?

151
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,034
- He's my friend.

152
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:41,969
- You're friend?

153
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,404
He is not your fucking friend!

154
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,873
This dude owns a Maserati!

155
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,107
Okay?

156
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,177
Not a fucking Prius,
 a $200,000 dollar car!

157
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,745
Baby, you are fucked!

158
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,246
- Okay, okay alright.

159
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,248
Cameron, you understand that
 this isn't normal, right?

160
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,349
Do you get it?

161
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,618
This is not normal!

162
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,919
Cameron, look at me!

163
00:06:58,919 --> 00:06:59,787
Look at me, hey!

164
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:01,622
What the fuck are you on?

165
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,556
- I'm not on anything!

166
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,091
- Oh really, really?

167
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,292
- Oh my God, stop lying to
 them, we need their help!

168
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,294
- Will you shut the fuck up?

169
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,329
- I will not shut the
fuck up, it's the truth!

170
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,464
- Stop it!
- I don't care!

171
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,665
I don't care anymore!

172
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,666
- Alright, Michelle.

173
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,569
What was in the car,
 what'd you lose?

174
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,770
- Oh, my God.

175
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,672
Will you please just help me out

176
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,373
and go take this guy his car?

177
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,712
Come on, Sam, this is
 my only way out, man.

178
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,279
I'm trying to get away
 from these people.

179
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,715
They're the reason
 I'm like this.

180
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:31,619
Please just tell him you're
 bringing him his car,

181
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:34,855
that I'm in jail and that you
 don't know when I'll be out.

182
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:35,689
Please!

183
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,959
- Okay, so say, what,
 we bring him the keys,

184
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,829
we bring him the car, we
 tell him you got arrested.

185
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,665
And how did we get the keys,
 how, what about the box?

186
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,266
- Just.

187
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,201
- Look, tell him
 you came and picked

188
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,603
them up from me in jail.

189
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,505
And the box, tell him the cops

190
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,607
took it when they arrested me.

191
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,509
He'll never bother me again.

192
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,144
- Okay, but you gotta
 do your part, okay?

193
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,679
You have to stop.

194
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,648
- I will, okay?

195
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:01,448
I will.

196
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,251
- What's his number?

197
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,553
- I'll call him.

198
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,455
- [Sam] What's his name again?

199
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,289
- Bosco.

200
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,959
- [Sam] Bosco.

201
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,698
(phone ringing)

202
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,600
- [Bosco] Who is this?

203
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,801
- Hi, is this Bosco?

204
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,070
- [Bosco] Who is this?

205
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,471
- I'm Cameron's brother.

206
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,372
- [Bosco] I don't give a fuck!

207
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,239
What do you want?

208
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,076
- I'm trying to get
 your car back to you.

209
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,011
- [Bosco] Why do you
 have my fucking car?

210
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,413
- I don't actually
 have your car,

211
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,649
but I'm trying to arrange
 a way for you to get it.

212
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,483
Where does he live?
 - I don't know.

213
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,317
- [Bosco] Where's Cam?

214
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,820
- He's locked up.

215
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:44,491
- [Bosco] Put Cam on
 the phone, please!

216
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,027
- Look, I'm just telling you
 what my mom told me, alright?

217
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,497
She told me that Cam and
 Mike were driving someplace,

218
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,199
he dropped Mike off,
 he was going to return

219
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,134
the car to you, it
stalled on the highway.

220
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,904
And then somewhere along
 those lines he got arrested.

221
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,806
That's it, that's
 what she told me.

222
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,240
(Bosco laughing)

223
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,642
She told me this in Spanish.
 - You're lying to me.

224
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,576
I might have misunderstood
 something, but...

225
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:03,376
- [Bosco] I don't believe you.

226
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,511
- Cam isn't here!

227
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,879
- [Bosco] Stop
 fucking around with me

228
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,414
and put Cam on the phone!
 - Hello, hello?

229
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,582
- [Bosco] Cameron?

230
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,416
- Hello?

231
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,352
Who the fuck is this?

232
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,887
- I told you!

233
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,856
You think everybody doesn't
 know you're a fucking liar?

234
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:16,957
- Relax, relax, okay?

235
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,458
Ma, ma you know who it is.

236
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,493
You remember when you picked
 me up from Brooklyn last week?

237
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,529
It was the guy
 with the Maserati.

238
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,864
- So this is the same?

239
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,298
Oh, my fucking God!

240
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,935
Are you sending mom and Michelle
to return this guy's car?

241
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,838
- Thank you, thank you!
- Get the fuck off me!

242
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,040
Why are you even here, man?

243
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,007
Did ma call you?

244
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,843
You calling in the troops?

245
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,510
Oh, you love this, don't you?

246
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,912
Yeah, you and Alex.

247
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,548
You both need people
like me so you can point

248
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,084
your fingers and say,
ooh, that's the bad guy!

249
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,018
- Yeah well, right
 now you're not

250
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,954
really acting like a good guy!

251
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:47,888
Are you?

252
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,723
- I'm whatever I need to be.

253
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,991
- You're a fucking liar!

254
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,159
- Stop calling me a liar!

255
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,094
- But it's true,
 though, you are lying!

256
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,729
(all screaming)

257
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:56,596
- Stop it!

258
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,231
Stop it, stop it!

259
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,334
I'm just gonna go take this
 Bosco guy his car, okay?

260
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,703
I don't want any more
 of your problems.

261
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,536
- Mom, wait!

262
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,607
Does he know where you live?

263
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,409
- Everyone knows
where Cam lives.

264
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,678
Fuck.

265
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,445
- Lock the doors and
 text me his number.

266
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,947
- Really, lock the doors?

267
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,850
Man dramatic, bro!
 - Not letting you go alone!

268
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,851
I'll meet you in the car.

269
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,987
- Fucking asshole!

270
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,155
- Wait, you need a jacket!

271
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,496
(tape rewinding)

272
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,744
Cam?

273
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,383
Papa?

274
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,586
- [Sam] Cameron!

275
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,488
- Sam?

276
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,757
- [Sam] Cam?

277
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:57,991
- What's wrong?
 - Where's Cameron?

278
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,492
- I just got here.

279
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:02,863
- Oh, my God!

280
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,200
- What are you doing in there?

281
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,035
It's freezing!

282
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,838
(laughs)

283
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,707
- Jesus Christ, this is crazy.

284
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,375
Mom, he called me.

285
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,179
Said he was tired of not
feeling loved, of feeling alone.

286
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,380
- Why didn't you--

287
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,314
- He said he was
 gonna kill himself.

288
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,549
- Why didn't you call me?

289
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,117
- Mom, he needs
 psychiatric help.

290
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,218
- I know, I took
 him to the doctor.

291
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,419
You know what they told me?

292
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,955
They told me I was
 the one who was crazy.

293
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:28,789
- What?

294
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,324
What are we gonna do?

295
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,159
- I don't know.

296
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,393
What can I do?

297
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,129
It's not like before
 when he was 14 or 15.

298
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,831
He's gonna be 19 in a few months

299
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,267
and there's nothing
 I can do for him.

300
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,702
Legally, if he
 doesn't want the help.

301
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,908
He went away to that
 school and I thought

302
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,643
he'd come back better,
but he won't get a job.

303
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,445
He won't go to church.

304
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,615
He won't take his medication
 and he won't stop doing drugs.

305
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,754
I don't know how much
longer I can take this.

306
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,489
- We'll figure something out.

307
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,957
We gotta get him outta there.

308
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,828
(ominous music)

309
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,245
- Why are you here?

310
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,049
- I'm trying to help
 you keep your job.

311
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,518
I don't know what's
 going on, Cecilia.

312
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,720
But remember you have an
 obligation to your students

313
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,755
that supercedes your own needs.

314
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,359
Think that through.

315
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,429
This may not be
 where you should be.

316
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,235
Have a good day.

317
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,172
- Okay, sorry about that.

318
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,141
Let's begin.

319
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,311
(door slamming)

320
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,584
(melancholy music)

321
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,990
He said the two would
 be here in 30 minutes.

322
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,858
- It's been 45.

323
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,095
(opera music on radio)

324
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,065
- I wanted to do that.

325
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,834
Be an opera singer
 like my Tia Ana.

326
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,705
- I didn't know that.

327
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,973
Why didn't you?

328
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,143
- I think it was just
too big a dream for me.

329
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,512
Then I had you guys.

330
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,650
- I think I'm gonna
 write about all this.

331
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,452
- Like a book?

332
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,488
- Yeah.

333
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,323
- Yeah?

334
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,026
- Mmhmm.

335
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,328
- That's good.

336
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,599
- Just tell me if you
don't want me to do it.

337
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,835
- No, do it, do it.

338
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,570
Maybe it will do
 someone some good.

339
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,842
How did it get so bad?

340
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,677
- I don't know.

341
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,047
How much longer
 can we keep it up?

342
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:40,914
Till he's 30, 40?

343
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,153
- Sam, believe me,
 if I could jump

344
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,521
inside his body and
 change him I would,

345
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,423
but for now, we just
 have to help him.

346
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,928
Cameron's not like you or Alex.

347
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,296
He's always needed us.

348
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,600
He said he's gonna
 go back to rehab,

349
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,703
so that'll give me 30 days
 to focus, to really focus.

350
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,338
- If he stays the 30 days.

351
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,074
- He said he was this time.

352
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,609
And Michelle's going with him.

353
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,282
- Can I see the keys?

354
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,060
(alarm beeping)

355
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,703
(engine revving)

356
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,208
I thought he said
 it wouldn't start.

357
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,442
- He said the battery stalled.

358
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,244
I don't know, maybe
 it needed to rest.

359
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,782
What are you looking for?

360
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,319
- I don't know.

361
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,920
Something doesn't feel right.

362
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,197
Mom, what is it,
what's going on?

363
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,598
- Something's wrong.

364
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,699
- What is it?

365
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,036
- It's Cameron.

366
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:10,937
- What?

367
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,272
- It's Cameron, it's Cameron.

368
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,206
- What are you talking about?

369
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,341
Mom, it's alright.

370
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,143
- Oh, my God!
- Mom, Mom, Mom!

371
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,211
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

372
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,446
- What is happening?

373
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:24,451
- No, no! (crying)

374
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,586
Please, please, no!

375
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,521
(moaning)

376
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,192
(speaking foreign language)

377
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,662
- Mom, it's alright.

378
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,730
(crying)

379
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,336
(police radio chattering)

380
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,938
- The detective
 tells me how he died.

381
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,942
Dozens of pictures before me,
 still he tells me how he died.

382
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,412
How Cameron drowned
 in our backyard pool

383
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,681
after he was shot
 in the back twice.

384
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,885
He warns me then
 flips the folder open,

385
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:03,790
Michelle's head open, the
 left side more intact.

386
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,658
I could almost tell it was her.

387
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,197
It's honest, it's,

388
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,665
it's dark.

389
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,667
I'm just concerned
 that the overall tone

390
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,904
is on a par to Blackout.

391
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,608
(muffled talking)

392
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,977
- Anybody wanna tell me
how good my turkey is?

393
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,179
- [Sam] It's really good, Mom.

394
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,414
- It's good, right?

395
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,015
I wish Deanna and
 Emily were here.

396
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,483
- Yeah, I know, me too.

397
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,852
They're still down in
 Florida with her parents.

398
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,255
- You know what, we
should do a family trip.

399
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,023
You want that papa,
you go down to Florida?

400
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,191
- No!

401
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,726
(laughs)

402
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,295
Hey, hey check these out.

403
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,665
You tell me how
 much you think's--

404
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,000
- Bill, don't start.

405
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,669
I thought you getting
 a desk job meant that

406
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,538
the basement was gonna
 start looking the way it did

407
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,906
before you started
filling it up with junk.

408
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,907
- Antiques.

409
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,343
- [Cecilia] Antiques?

410
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,111
- Dad, I don't think
 these are worth very much.

411
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,548
- These are the first
memory cards ever made.

412
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,183
- These are USB drives.

413
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,484
It's a USB drive, Pop.

414
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,952
(laughs)

415
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:09,088
- And technology doesn't
 really gain value with time.

416
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,658
- How much do you think
the iPhone costs now

417
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,461
compared to what it was
when it first came out?

418
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,296
- Yeah, but these aren't
the first iPhones.

419
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,832
This is not the first that's
 anything (laughs) sorry.

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,101
- Dream killers.

421
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,237
- [Sam] Sorry, Pop.

422
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,071
- Give it back.

423
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,005
- [Sam] No, I want it.

424
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,707
- Forget about it, give it back.

425
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,276
- You wanna eat?

426
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,110
Let me get you some
 juice, okay papa?

427
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,680
- [Alex] Dad, you
 want some gravy?

428
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,082
- Thank you.

429
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,818
(men chattering)

430
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,462
Thank you.

431
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,631
- [Alex] Sorry, Dad.

432
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,903
- [Bill] That's the last
advice I ever ask you.

433
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:57,870
- [Sam] Aw, come on.

434
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,372
- [Cecilia] Hey.

435
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,507
- Thank you.

436
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,809
- Okay here, drink that.

437
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,911
Why don't you tell Sam
 about your new job?

438
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,078
- You got a job?

439
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,614
- I got him the job.

440
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,116
- Wow, what is it?

441
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,419
- [Cecilia] Come on, tell
 him what you're doing.

442
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,986
- Just loading shit
 into a warehouse.

443
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,821
- You're welcome.

444
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,156
- Well, that's good.

445
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,591
You never know where
 there's room to grow.

446
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,826
- That's right.

447
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,429
I keep telling him
 that, you never know.

448
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,996
You just gotta be positive.

449
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,799
Every job is an opportunity
 to discover something new,

450
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,269
to discover something different.

451
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,102
You know?

452
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,372
Are you tired of being home?

453
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,809
- Did you put something in this?

454
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:37,977
- What?

455
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:38,811
No.

456
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,113
- What's that
 bitter taste, then?

457
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,349
- I don't, you
 want me to try it?

458
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,084
- No, we're supposed to
trust each other, Ma!

459
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:47,587
The counselor told us we're
 supposed to trust each other.

460
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,121
But how the fuck am I
 supposed to do that--

461
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,290
- Oh!

462
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,224
- When you keep
 doing shit like this?

463
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,892
- Alright, okay I'm sorry.

464
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,160
I'm sorry.

465
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,395
- Whoa, dude!
 - You ungrateful little fuck!

466
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,629
- Wait don't, stop,
 Bill, stop, stop!

467
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,897
There's no fighting
 this Thanksgiving!

468
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,033
- You can't let him
 get away with that!

469
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,803
(speaking foreign language)

470
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,472
- I'm done.

471
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,139
I'm sorry.

472
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,709
(speaking foreign language)

473
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,543
- Dad.

474
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,555
- [Sam] I thought you and
 I could use a little rum.

475
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,390
- Thanks.

476
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,159
That was the worst
 Thanksgiving dinner ever.

477
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,928
- At least it's over.

478
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,864
(glasses clinking)

479
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,635
You excited?

480
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,103
- About what?

481
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,070
- Spring semester.

482
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,675
- I think I'm gonna
 take some time off.

483
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,144
- Won't that affect your
candidacy for tenure?

484
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,480
- Sam, they're never
 gonna give me tenure.

485
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,550
- But, you were looking forward

486
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,285
to teaching that
 Shakespeare class.

487
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,489
- I don't know, I just,
I'm ready for a change.

488
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,792
I'm thinking about
 doing real estate.

489
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,128
I can work from home,
 make my own hours.

490
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,032
- I don't know, Mom, you were,

491
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,200
you waited three years
 to teach that class.

492
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,971
- Shakespeare isn't
 going anywhere.

493
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,626
- They can't come in here,
 Mom can't come in here.

494
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,569
Fuck, man!

495
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,004
This isn't fucking normal, Sam!

496
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,173
People aren't supposed to
 go through this shit, man!

497
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:51,110
I keep fucking waking up in
this goddamn fucking nightmare!

498
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,482
Nothing seems to fucking
make sense anymore!

499
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,183
This isn't who we are!

500
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,017
Right?

501
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,532
Look at this shit.

502
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,782
Thinking about moving to
Miami, we're selling the house.

503
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,253
Taking Mom and Dad with me.

504
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,423
And get a fresh start.

505
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,797
No one should be
dealing with this shit.

506
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:57,910
Sam, are you scared, man?

507
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,760
- [Cameron] You want
 something to drink?

508
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,261
- No, I'm alright.

509
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,464
- [Cameron] Good, 'cause
 I didn't get you anything.

510
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,532
(laughs)

511
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,737
- [Sam] Really, you're
gonna smoke right here?

512
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,006
- Relax, bro, it's not
 gonna go in the house.

513
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,744
- [Sam] How are you?

514
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,679
- [Cameron] I'm good.

515
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:33,880
- Nah.

516
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,383
I mean, like, how's
everything been at home?

517
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:40,152
- (laughs) I'm as
 good as I'm gonna get.

518
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm selling heroin, coke too.

519
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,432
If any of your friends need
 it, let me know, I got 'em.

520
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:57,369
- Damn.

521
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:00,439
That's heavy.

522
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,143
Cameron?

523
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:04,977
- Yeah?

524
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:07,947
- Just be careful.

525
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,883
- I know man, I'm not stupid.

526
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,285
- Alright.

527
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:18,658
- Besides, it's not like any
 of this shit even matters.

528
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,160
Look at the sun.

529
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:23,896
It's gonna die.

530
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:29,736
The stars, the universe, it
 all ends for everything, man.

531
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:31,070
None of it matters.

532
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,574
- You sound like you've
already given up.

533
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:37,777
- Nah, I just understand
how shit works now.

534
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,880
All the little things
 inside the big things

535
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,414
start to become the same thing.

536
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,618
It invalidates everything.

537
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,054
Just think about it,
 man, this explosion.

538
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,224
(laughs)

539
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,192
Scary, right?

540
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:55,728
- Yeah.

541
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,731
You know what's really scary?

542
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,999
- What?

543
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,433
- Thinking about
your 13 year old

544
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,202
self's opinion of yourself.

545
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,537
(laughs)

546
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,072
- What?

547
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,475
- I picture my 13 year old
 self walking into my room,

548
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,078
checking out my shit,
 looking at my room,

549
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:15,615
my apartment, the
 diploma on the wall.

550
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:17,049
Seeing how much I aged.

551
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,719
It can really mess with you.

552
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,321
What about yours?

553
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:25,357
What would your 13 year old
 self feel if he saw you?

554
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,192
- If he saw me?

555
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,026
- [Sam] Yeah.

556
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:33,332
- He would feel nothing
 because he wouldn't know me.

557
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:41,073
- I think I'm gonna
 write about all this.

558
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,274
- What do you mean?

559
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,443
- About, you know,
 all this, you.

560
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:46,646
- What are you gonna call it?

561
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,214
- I don't know.

562
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,584
It can't be a word, it
 has to be like a feeling.

563
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,954
- Maybe you'll write
 me a happy ending.

564
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,057
- [Sam] Yeah, hopefully.

565
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,861
(melancholy music)

566
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:53,946
Hey.

567
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:55,948
- I'm really sorry.

568
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,086
- I could have done something.

569
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,921
- It's not your fault,
 it's not your fault.

570
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,089
You cannot blame yourself.

571
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,256
He was too far gone.

572
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,491
- I'm not sure, I'm not.

573
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,927
- Look, you told his story.

574
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,297
That's gonna keep him alive.

575
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,235
(cell phone buzzing)

576
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,306
- Yeah, Dad, what's up?

577
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,373
- It was fast.

578
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,076
Bosco had a very strong alibi,

579
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,045
confirmed by over
 a dozen people.

580
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,082
They couldn't find his
 prints in the house.

581
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,851
They're letting him go.

582
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,085
- What?

583
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,921
- They can't charge
 him with anything.

584
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:35,855
They're letting him go.

585
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,023
I'm on my way over there.

586
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:43,863
- Hey, do you know if
 Mom's still sleeping?

587
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,965
- They're letting him go.

588
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,200
- What?

589
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,902
- Yeah, Dad called,
they're letting him go.

590
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:57,643
What are we going to do?

591
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,146
What are we gonna tell Mom?

592
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:02,214
- Whatever we fucking,
 whatever we have to.

593
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,753
Alright, whatever we have to.

594
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,192
(Alex sighing)

595
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:27,273
- I wish we could just like,
oh, move the whole family here.

596
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:28,407
Like, be safe, you know?

597
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,576
Out of the city, safe.

598
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,778
- You like that house?

599
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:34,546
- Yeah, I like
 that, that's pretty.

600
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,481
- Good.

601
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,582
- That's my lucky number, too.

602
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,449
- How about that?

603
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,385
Me, too.

604
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,520
- [Cecilia] What?

605
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,354
- You really like that house?

606
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,189
- [Cecilia] Yeah.

607
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,126
- Good.

608
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:49,561
I'm glad you like it
 because you own it.

609
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,900
- What do you mean I own it?

610
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,867
- We own it.

611
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:56,668
- What?

612
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,438
- Happy anniversary.

613
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,440
(laughs)

614
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,677
- Oh, my God!

615
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,612
For real?

616
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,514
(speaking foreign language)

617
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,582
(laughs)

618
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,153
- It's got a big
 pool in the back.

619
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,487
- Let's go see!

620
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,722
- Let's go swimming!

621
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:19,225
- [Cecilia] Let's go! (laughing)

622
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,660
(speaking foreign language)

623
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,195
- Cece, please just come.

624
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:26,232
Okay, breathe with me, okay,
 'cause you're very nervous.

625
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:28,367
Breathe, okay.

626
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,269
(speaking foreign language)

627
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,071
One day at a time, okay?

628
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,172
- Okay.

629
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:34,540
- Okay, breathe.

630
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,808
- I wanna go home.

631
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,443
- Why, I'm taking
 care of you here.

632
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,878
- Because everything is there.

633
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,180
Everything of his is
there, I wanna go home.

634
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,649
- No, come on let's, breathe
 with me a little bit.

635
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,952
- [Cecilia] I wanna go
 home, I wanna go home.

636
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,753
- [Wilma] Cece, please
 you have to breathe.

637
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:48,754
- [Cecilia] I wanna go home!

638
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,489
- [Wilma] Cece!

639
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,858
- [Cecilia] Where'd
 you get that?

640
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:53,259
- [Cameron] Relax,
 I didn't steal it.

641
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,627
Where are your records?

642
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,562
- Beneath the TV.

643
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,643
(laughs)

644
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,512
- [Cameron] Here,
 check these out.

645
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,814
- Oh man, I haven't
 seen these in so long.

646
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,585
Oh, you have to play this.

647
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:20,486
It's my favorite.

648
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,827
- I had a weird
 dream last night.

649
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,863
- Oh yeah, what was it about?

650
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:31,931
- Just a weird dream.

651
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:38,604
- Dreams are very powerful
 things, like a web.

652
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,506
You're at the center
 of it and dreams

653
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,741
are everything that
 extends outward.

654
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:46,112
Everything you are,
 are meant to be, were.

655
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,515
But, you know, you can't
be all those things

656
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,250
in real life, so
dreams are a nice way--

657
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,284
- It was a bad dream.

658
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,289
Just me driving on
 some dark highway.

659
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,757
It works. (laughs)

660
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,193
- Ooh, I love this.

661
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,931
(both laughing)

662
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,734
Tell me more about
 your dream, papa.

663
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:10,402
- Don't worry about
 it, it's nothing.

664
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,539
I got you these seeds.

665
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,141
- What?

666
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,175
What are these?

667
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,443
(laughs)

668
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:19,745
- Relax, Ma, they're
 just flowers, okay?

669
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,647
I was helping Miss Russo,
 the old lady next door,

670
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,215
clean out her garage.

671
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,584
She gave me the record
 player and 40 bucks.

672
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,219
So that was pretty awesome.

673
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,322
She um, she told me
 she hears us yelling

674
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,092
and screaming all the
 time, so she gave me these.

675
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,693
Said to plant 'em in
the front of the house,

676
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,095
that they'd being happiness.

677
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,833
- I love you, papa.

678
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:47,439
- I um, I know I've
been kind of bad lately.

679
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:51,510
But um, (laughs)
 I'm gonna go clean.

680
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,346
Okay?

681
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,347
I promise.

682
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,583
(speaking foreign language)

683
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,985
- You're a good boy.

684
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,520
I know you are.

685
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,191
(speaking foreign language)

686
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:09,128
- There was a fight
 a few weeks ago,

687
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:12,031
some classroom disturbances.

688
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,533
Truancy is the real
 issue here, however.

689
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,535
Out of 62 school days so far,

690
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,405
he has only attended 19 of them.

691
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,608
Our psychologist
evaluated him yesterday

692
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,311
and there was nothing
troubling or remarkable.

693
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:26,578
- Nothing?

694
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,048
- Nothing that he
 could see, anyway.

695
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:32,151
We can consider after
 school programs, mentoring,

696
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,320
but if he's not
willing to attend them,

697
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,222
then there really is no point.

698
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:37,823
Whatever he's going through,

699
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:40,926
that change has to
 come from within him.

700
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:43,029
- You're telling me I
have to just be patient?

701
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,296
- You know what they say.

702
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,965
Patience is bitter,
 the fruit is sweet.

703
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,302
He is a good kid, Cecilia.

704
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,704
He will realize what he
has to do soon enough.

705
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,074
- What if he doesn't?

706
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,476
- If he doesn't then we'll cross

707
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,045
that bridge when we come to it.

708
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,846
Okay?

709
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,548
- Okay.

710
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,087
(school bell ringing)

711
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,512
- [Sam] Hey, there's
 the birthday girl!

712
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,346
- No!

713
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:36,148
- [Sam] What is it?

714
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,083
- Where's Cameron?

715
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,417
- He left with Alex, why?

716
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,518
- My purse is missing.

717
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:41,387
- Shit.

718
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,821
- Yeah, I need to report this.

719
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,323
- What?

720
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:45,791
- I need to report that
 my stuff is missing, Sam.

721
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,360
He has my credit cards, my
 identification, my work phone.

722
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,995
- Alright, well maybe
 it's here someplace.

723
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,930
- No, because it was
 right fucking here!

724
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,566
God, fuck that
 fucking drug addict!

725
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,801
Why did you invite him?

726
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,069
- Because I want
 to feel like I have

727
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:57,903
a normal fucking
 family sometimes.

728
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,138
- I should have said no,

729
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,006
but then I would have
 been the asshole.

730
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,008
But I told you, I
 fucking told you!

731
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,176
You know what an enabler is?

732
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,444
Open your eyes, Sam!

733
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,346
Or are they only
 open for your book?

734
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,715
You need to fix this.

735
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,026
(knocking)

736
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:21,860
- Cam?

737
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,863
- [Cameron] I'm not going!

738
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:28,600
- What the hell do you
mean, you're not going?

739
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,336
Cameron, open this damn door.

740
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:32,838
Don't play with me, Cameron!

741
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,308
Okay, do what you want.

742
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,777
You wanna stay and do
 eight years in prison?

743
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:42,214
Stay and throw away all the
 money I spent on that lawyer!

744
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,216
But you better think
about your future, boy,

745
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,185
because you're still only 17.

746
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,754
This is your last
 chance to start over.

747
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:50,856
(banging)

748
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:51,690
Cameron?

749
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,960
You choose because I'm done!

750
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,061
I've done enough!

751
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,898
(thudding)

752
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:00,699
- Cameron?

753
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,903
- Cameron!

754
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:05,737
Cameron!

755
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,840
Stop the car, get
 out of the car!

756
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,442
Get out of the car!

757
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,456
(panting)

758
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,397
(ominous music)

759
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:04,896
- It's too late.

760
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,131
- [Cecilia] What?

761
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,966
- [Man] They waited for
over an hour, Cecilia.

762
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,669
- Did you tell them
 I had an emergency?

763
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,172
- I did, I did but you can't
 keep these people waiting.

764
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,006
It's over.

765
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,580
- I'll appeal it.

766
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,914
- You'll appeal it?

767
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,283
- Yes.

768
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,217
- And then what?

769
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,852
You win and you're allowed back.

770
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,088
How many more classes
 are you gonna miss?

771
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,658
How you gonna get your
 evaluations out of the toilet?

772
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,961
I've been patient,
 Cecilia, believe me.

773
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,195
I've been really patient.

774
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,633
We're gonna offer
 you paid suspension.

775
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,770
Take it, take it.

776
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,838
Take it and just
walk away, okay?

777
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,009
I'm sorry.

778
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,287
- As far as the wine we'll
 go with the Pinot Noir.

779
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,455
- [Cecilia] Can I
 get a Long Island?

780
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,358
- Oh, my God, what
 are you doing here?

781
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:09,127
- I missed my baby sister,
 I thought I'd stop by.

782
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,362
Are you busy, is
now a good time?

783
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,730
- Oh yeah, yeah, it's fine.

784
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,367
I wish you would have
told me you were coming.

785
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,868
I would have opened
 the kitchen for you.

786
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,370
- No, no it's fine.

787
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,408
It's just one of those spur of
 the moment things, you know.

788
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:28,347
- Cece, you hate the city.

789
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,881
You live 50 miles away.

790
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:30,716
What's going on?

791
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:34,486
- I got fired.

792
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:36,288
- What?

793
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:39,190
I thought you were
 getting tenure.

794
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,559
(laughs)

795
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,527
- That's a joke.

796
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,498
How about that drink?

797
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,366
(laughs)

798
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,700
- Merlot?

799
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,836
Two merlots, please.

800
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:53,305
- You know I thought
 I could do it, Wilma.

801
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:54,540
I thought I could do both,

802
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,345
have a family and have
 a successful career.

803
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,046
- You did, you are doing it.

804
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,183
- Cameron's doing something.

805
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,453
He's up to something, I
don't know what it is.

806
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,787
(speaking foreign language)

807
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,323
No, no it's not all
 his fault, you know?

808
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,791
He has issues.

809
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,660
We moved out to Long
 Island because we thought

810
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,862
that's what you do,
 you buy the house,

811
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:17,963
you put the flag
 out in the front.

812
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,333
That was the dream, right,
 when Mami came here?

813
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,534
That's what she told us.

814
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,772
But, we're not doing it right.

815
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:28,407
I don't know,
 somehow I'm failing.

816
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,975
I feel like I'm failing him--

817
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:30,809
- Listen to yourself.

818
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,043
- I'm failing my family.

819
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,045
I'm just, I'm failing everybody.

820
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,581
- You have to stop!

821
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,148
You have to stop
blaming yourself

822
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,150
for whatever Cameron
 chooses to do.

823
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,987
He's not a child anymore.

824
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,155
He knows that his actions
 have consequences,

825
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,558
yet he continues to
 behave the same way.

826
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:50,295
You have to focus on
the rest of your family.

827
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:51,930
Why do you think Sam moved out?

828
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,767
- Why he got that
 job in the city?

829
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,904
- He could have waited
 tables anywhere,

830
00:38:58,904 --> 00:38:59,838
but he chooses the city.

831
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,373
Why do you think that is?

832
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:04,610
This thing with Cameron, it
 doesn't only affect you, Cece.

833
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,145
It hurts me, it hurts
 your boys, it hurts Bill.

834
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,313
- Okay, you know what?

835
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,748
Enough, Wilma. (speaking
foreign language)

836
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:12,150
- Nobody can say anything
because you don't wanna hear it.

837
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,351
- No, you have said enough.

838
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:17,288
- What's wrong?

839
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,825
Missing pills again?

840
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:22,694
- I don't know,
 I don't, maybe...

841
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,297
- Every time those pills
mysteriously disappear,

842
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,666
where do you think they go?

843
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:29,901
Hmm?

844
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,875
- Hey Kevin, have
 you seen Cameron?

845
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,410
- Yo Kev, come over!

846
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,645
Want a hit?

847
00:39:39,645 --> 00:39:41,713
- Oh shit, let's go upstairs.

848
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,548
I'm sure he's fine.

849
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:43,782
- It's been three days.

850
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,250
We haven't heard back from him.

851
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,985
- When he runs out of
money, he'll come back.

852
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,987
- So you don't know where he is?

853
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,289
- I know he's been spending
 a lot of time in Brooklyn,

854
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,659
but we haven't spoken to
each other in a while.

855
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,995
Do you know who he's
 been hanging around with?

856
00:39:56,995 --> 00:40:00,098
- No, we don't know anything.

857
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,533
We just wanna make
 sure he's okay.

858
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,004
- What would you do if you were,

859
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,873
I don't know, a five year old?

860
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:09,240
And someone comes up to you and

861
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,742
gives you a free piece of candy.

862
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,678
The next day they
 give you two pieces.

863
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,580
What do you do on the third day

864
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,114
when that person
doesn't show up?

865
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,316
You go looking for them, right?

866
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,785
- Right.

867
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,820
- That's who he's been
 hanging around with.

868
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,590
(tea kettle whistling)

869
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,691
- How is she?

870
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:31,429
- It's been difficult.

871
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,164
Alex brought Emily
 over yesterday

872
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,301
and that cheered
 her up a bit, but...

873
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,839
She wants to go home.

874
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,175
I think it's too soon.

875
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,376
But you know how she is.

876
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,721
So, they let him go.

877
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:58,023
- Does she know that?

878
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,257
- No, of course not.

879
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:01,493
- Okay.

880
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,400
- Cece?

881
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,268
You awake?

882
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,073
Look who's here.

883
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,711
- Mom?

884
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,046
Mom, you awake?

885
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,621
Tia was telling me
 that Emily spent

886
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,222
the day with you here yesterday.

887
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:40,732
Have you been taking
 your medication?

888
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,202
You know you have to take them.

889
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,939
They'll make you feel better.

890
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,612
Look what I brought you.

891
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,283
Remember when you
 gave me these books?

892
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,430
Samuel, happy first
 day of school.

893
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,901
I hope you understand our
 decision in moving out here

894
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:18,003
and see that Long
 Island is not so bad.

895
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,706
I'm sure you'll make
 lots of new friends

896
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,708
and in a year you can
 have your own car.

897
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:24,576
No more trains.

898
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,379
I'll be here to talk
 when you're ready.

899
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,048
Love, Mom.

900
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:39,424
- Today has, it's
 been a bad day.

901
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:46,798
- How would you like to come
 stay with me for a few days?

902
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:48,934
Would you like that?

903
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,037
What do you think?

904
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:56,975
(festive Latin music)

905
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,765
- [Cecilia] Hey, what
are you doing out here?

906
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:21,366
- Just waiting for Alex and Cam.

907
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:26,805
- You okay, papa?

908
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,108
- I just don't want
 things to go back

909
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,943
to the way they
 were before he left.

910
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,211
- They won't, they won't.

911
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:37,649
- Mom, I can't see next year,

912
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:40,218
I can't see the next five years.

913
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,220
Waiting tables was
 not part of the plan.

914
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:45,490
- Well, maybe you need to
 shift your focus, you know?

915
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,958
Go back to writing your book.

916
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,663
- I don't know.

917
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:55,266
- Look, it's a cliche, but
 they say it because it's true.

918
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:56,768
Write about what you know.

919
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,170
Write about what you love,
 what makes you happy,

920
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,739
what makes you tick,
 what scares you.

921
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,073
- A lot of things scare
me these days, Mom.

922
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,308
- Alright, come on,
 you can (laughs).

923
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,312
It's all about, it's
just all about focusing.

924
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,279
You know?

925
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,181
Allowing yourself to go there.

926
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,990
It's gonna be
different, he's changed.

927
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,060
- I wouldn't get your hopes up.

928
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,661
- You can be so cynical.

929
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,531
(horn honking)

930
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,834
Ooh, there's my baby!

931
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,268
(laughs)

932
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,170
- So, I pick him up
 at the train station.

933
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,638
I leave him in the
 car for five minutes

934
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,440
to go get groceries and
 this little piece of shit--

935
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,374
- [Cecilia] Wait a minute.

936
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:37,809
- Fucking takes off in my car!

937
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:38,844
Get out of the fucking car!
 - What are you doing?

938
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:39,644
- Get out of the car!
 - Alex!

939
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:40,578
- He's fucking stoned.

940
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:41,847
He's been gone for two years.

941
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,048
The first time we
 see you and you're

942
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:44,315
already fucking
 stoned, aren't you?

943
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,250
- Jesus Christ.

944
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,785
Stop yelling, you're here, okay?

945
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:48,586
Are you alright?

946
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:52,123
- Welcome fucking home!

947
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:54,826
Little shit.

948
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,660
- [Cecilia] You okay, papa?

949
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,598
- Cecilia, just leave him there.

950
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:06,972
- Can you make it?

951
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:10,475
Oh, my little baby, I miss you.

952
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:17,883
- Ma, you need help?

953
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,284
- [Cecilia] Yeah.

954
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:21,887
Thank you, papa.

955
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:22,854
- You're welcome.

956
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,355
I gotta head out of here.

957
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,190
- What?

958
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,391
But it's still early!

959
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,226
- Yeah, I know, but
 the party's over

960
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,328
and I gotta be up at
 three in the morning.

961
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,498
- You still working on
 that housing development?

962
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:35,300
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

963
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,002
Uh, listen, I gave Cam the list

964
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:39,504
of interviews he's
 got for tomorrow.

965
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:44,542
They're not the classiest
 jobs, but it's a start.

966
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,845
Can you just make sure
that he makes it there?

967
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:49,781
- Yeah, don't worry, I will.

968
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,316
I will, don't worry, okay?

969
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:52,918
- [Alex] Alright,
 no, I'm not worried.

970
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,419
Okay.
- I'll drive him myself.

971
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,887
Okay?

972
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:57,622
- Cool, and make sure he brings
his resume with him, please.

973
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,257
- Okay.

974
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,959
- Good, I know. (laughs)

975
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,293
Alright, I gotta go, Mom.

976
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:03,561
- Okay.
 - Alright.

977
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,030
(speaking foreign language)

978
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,965
- I love you.
- I love you too, papa.

979
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,552
- I'm sorry I didn't get
 to go up there that much.

980
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:29,020
- [Cameron] It's cool.

981
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,788
It's a bitch of a drive, I
 wouldn't have gone up either.

982
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,589
- Yeah.

983
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:34,325
Alex tells me about
 all the interviews

984
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:35,827
he has lined up for you.

985
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:37,963
- Yeah, a bunch
 of weak-ass jobs.

986
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:41,933
- [Sam] It's better than
 sitting here, though, right?

987
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:42,767
- Yeah.

988
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,238
What about you, you still
 doing that writing thing?

989
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,807
- Yeah, yeah, I'm still
doing the writing thing.

990
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,376
- [Cameron] That's cool.

991
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,878
Gotta do what you love, right?

992
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:54,679
- Yeah.

993
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,249
What about you?

994
00:46:58,249 --> 00:46:59,650
What do you love?

995
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,086
(laughs)

996
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:02,620
- What do you love?

997
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,555
(laughs)

998
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,491
You sound like my
 counselor, man.

999
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:11,729
- [Sam] Alright.

1000
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:14,765
- [Cameron] You wanna smoke?

1001
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,767
- Nah, you know I
 don't do that no more.

1002
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,569
- [Cameron] Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,009
I'm selling heroin, coke too.

1004
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:26,777
(voices echoing)

1005
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:34,085
- Thank you, Annie.

1006
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:36,187
Anyone else?

1007
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,360
Anyone else?

1008
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,966
- I uh, lost my daughter Paige,

1009
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,436
six months and 10 days ago.

1010
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:54,605
Overdose.

1011
00:47:56,674 --> 00:48:00,178
It's completely ripping
 us apart, me and my wife.

1012
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:06,051
The sense of pain
 and the desperation,

1013
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,054
the guilt that comes
 along with it is like,

1014
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:12,924
it's unlike anything I've...

1015
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:15,726
I mean, still, six months...

1016
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,129
(stammering)

1017
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:23,568
I haven't had a moment
 of silence up here

1018
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,106
and I'm afraid that
when that moment comes,

1019
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,607
when I finally stop
 thinking about it,

1020
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,310
that's when I'm afraid that
 it's going to be too much.

1021
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:37,148
To be alone in the silence.

1022
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:40,851
Without her laugh or without me

1023
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,154
being able to tell her
 how much I love her.

1024
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,257
(man sobbing)

1025
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,093
She was only 17.

1026
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:52,197
I just miss her so much!

1027
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,533
- I'm so sorry.

1028
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:01,139
I'm sorry, Sam I wanna go home.

1029
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:01,973
- Okay.

1030
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:21,592
- So, what do you think?

1031
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:23,995
Should I just take the
 sign off right now?

1032
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:25,230
(laughs)

1033
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:28,833
Ms. Dern, Miss Newman,
I am so sorry I'm late.

1034
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:31,336
- It's alright, gave us a chance
to check out the backyard.

1035
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:32,837
- Big, isn't it?

1036
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:35,706
Let's go, come on I'll show
 you the rest of the house.

1037
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,775
If I can find the keys, okay.

1038
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:40,778
So what's great about
this layout is that you

1039
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:45,250
can convert the media
 room into a third bedroom.

1040
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,751
That's room to grow.

1041
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,186
- How many square feet is it?

1042
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:50,521
- About 1600 square feet.

1043
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:51,789
(cell phone buzzing)

1044
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:55,126
Oh, excuse me for a second.

1045
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:56,861
Hello.

1046
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,131
Oh, you're kidding.

1047
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,801
Jesus Christ, I'll
 be right there.

1048
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:08,939
I am so sorry, but...

1049
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,683
Unbelievable.

1050
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,990
What the hell happened?

1051
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,625
- [Cameron] It's nothing,
 she just ran out of money,

1052
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,759
so they kicked her out.

1053
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,529
- I'm sorry, I
 rushed my clients out

1054
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,631
of the house so I
 could give her a ride?

1055
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:34,465
Who are you?

1056
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,833
- Hi, I'm Michelle.

1057
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,102
- Hi, Michelle.

1058
00:50:37,102 --> 00:50:38,569
Who's Michelle?

1059
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,870
- Oh, my God, Ma, you're
 gonna drive me fucking crazy.

1060
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,106
- I'm gonna drive
 you fucking crazy?

1061
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:42,373
- Yeah.

1062
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,175
- This is the third
time this week you have

1063
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:45,943
called me with this
 bullshit, Cameron, come on!

1064
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,278
I'm trying to keep this job.

1065
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:49,847
- I know, but she has
 nowhere else to go!

1066
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:52,283
So she's gonna be staying
 with us for a few days, okay?

1067
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:53,951
- Oh, great.

1068
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:56,187
- Come on, you know I love you.

1069
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:59,524
(speaking foreign language)

1070
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:00,758
- You're gonna make me crazy.

1071
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,760
You're gonna kill me.
 - Thank you so much.

1072
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,796
- Come on, let's go,
 bring your pink bag.

1073
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:12,503
Get her bag, be a
 gentlemen at least.

1074
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:13,338
- No.

1075
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,941
I'm not raising
 someone else's kid.

1076
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:19,043
- It's only a few days.

1077
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:20,478
- A few days.

1078
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:23,214
A few days turn into a few
weeks, turns into a few months.

1079
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,415
No!

1080
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,050
- I already told
 her she could stay.

1081
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,152
- Untell her.

1082
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:28,619
She isn't staying.

1083
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,022
And Cameron needs to think about
getting his own place, too.

1084
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,524
- What does that mean?

1085
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,860
So you're gonna kick him out
 now, is that what's happening?

1086
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,129
So that's your answer now
 for everything, right?

1087
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:39,230
You just wanna kick him out.

1088
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,231
- Cecilia, what are you doing?

1089
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,833
You're losing
 sight of everything

1090
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,170
because you can't cut the
 fucking umbilical cord!

1091
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,273
You already gave birth to him.

1092
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,309
You're waiting around
 for him to kill you?

1093
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:52,377
He almost killed me!

1094
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:56,547
He has you in the palm of his
 hand and you can't see it!

1095
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,450
You need to make the choice.

1096
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,820
Yeah, I'm telling you right now.

1097
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:04,922
Make a choice!

1098
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:08,559
- Oh yeah, go, walk away Bill!

1099
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,329
That's what you always
 do, anyway, you disappear!

1100
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,263
- Bullshit!

1101
00:52:13,398 --> 00:52:15,633
I've been right
 here the whole time!

1102
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,336
Paying my dues!

1103
00:52:19,204 --> 00:52:21,706
But you don't see me anymore!

1104
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:22,540
No!

1105
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,310
Look at me!

1106
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:28,145
Look what he's done to me!

1107
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:31,015
What you've done to me!

1108
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:35,720
(sobbing)

1109
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:51,436
(laughs)

1110
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:54,539
You remember when
 you had to play

1111
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:58,576
the pumpkin in that
 Thanksgiving play?

1112
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:03,080
You had to get your
 hair cut but that guy

1113
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,049
in the barber shop didn't
 know how to cut your hair?

1114
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:07,017
So you gave yourself a buzz cut.

1115
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:10,288
(laughs)

1116
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:13,958
I remember when we went
to that amusement park

1117
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:16,827
and you wanted to get
on that roller coaster.

1118
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,763
You made me get in
 the front with you.

1119
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:23,200
You made me get on that
five times in the front.

1120
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,571
I was so scared.

1121
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:29,640
And you kept saying, you
just gotta let go, Ma.

1122
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,476
You just gotta let go.

1123
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:41,151
Was this my fault?

1124
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:09,880
- Alex and I cleaned everything.

1125
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:12,917
Washed everything ourselves.

1126
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,486
We didn't want them
 to touch his things

1127
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,087
any more than they already have.

1128
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:30,000
I've been doing some
 reading about well,

1129
00:54:31,536 --> 00:54:33,037
how to pass the time, I guess.

1130
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:43,481
- What's this?

1131
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:46,351
- [Sam] Singing classes.

1132
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,622
- Singing classes?

1133
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,760
- Yeah, to help take
 your mind off things.

1134
00:54:57,362 --> 00:54:59,163
- Why does everyone
 keep saying that?

1135
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:05,135
Why does everybody
 keep saying that?

1136
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,805
I don't wanna take
 my mind off it.

1137
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,206
My son just died.

1138
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:15,446
I don't wanna take
 my mind off that.

1139
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,086
This just isn't the same.

1140
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:23,888
None of this is the same.

1141
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,496
- I'll wait for you downstairs.

1142
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:34,765
Let me know if you
 need anything, okay?

1143
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,550
(somber opera music)

1144
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,546
- They didn't.

1145
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:24,915
It's empty!

1146
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,417
Why is this empty?

1147
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:31,922
(sighing)

1148
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:38,896
(sniffing)

1149
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:42,166
I can't smell him.

1150
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,503
I can't smell him.

1151
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:53,578
No!

1152
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,946
(sobbing)

1153
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,347
No!

1154
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,583
No, no, no, no!

1155
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,218
No, no, no!

1156
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,456
(screaming)

1157
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:23,307
- [Cameron] Ta-da!

1158
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:26,310
- No, no, no Cam, no.

1159
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,478
- Come on.

1160
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:30,347
- Babe, once you
 start doing that shit.

1161
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:31,616
Come on, just smoke it.

1162
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:33,183
Or chip it, I'll do it with you.

1163
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,084
- No, you're not.

1164
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:34,952
- Yeah, I am, come on.

1165
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,286
I'll do it with you.

1166
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:40,525
- Let me just, let me
 just do it this one time.

1167
00:57:40,525 --> 00:57:43,160
I'll do it here, with you, safe.

1168
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:47,532
Besides, I gotta
 test the merchandise.

1169
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:48,499
Quality control.

1170
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,167
This is work.

1171
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,438
- I'm still pretty toasted.

1172
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:55,706
You're not high?

1173
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,608
- Yeah, but this is different.

1174
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:01,779
Get me a spoon?

1175
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,215
(rap music)

1176
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,422
* Can't take it

1177
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:13,390
* Can't take it

1178
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,592
* What life you wanna live

1179
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:16,160
* What path you tryin' to go

1180
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,795
* Reflection on my city

1181
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,730
* All I see is blow

1182
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,599
* Nobody ever gave
 me shit, though *

1183
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,233
* Why you watchin' me go

1184
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,535
* Wanna a piece of this life

1185
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:25,836
* That's history

1186
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,104
* Middle finger's up
 I'm chasing three *

1187
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,606
* Father told me
 don't grab game *

1188
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:30,207
* Don't game, the same thing

1189
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,109
* B-I-G, I'm screamin' it

1190
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:33,878
* Street life, I'm meanin' it

1191
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:35,546
* Feet forward,
 I gotta get out *

1192
00:58:35,546 --> 00:58:37,314
* Bright lights
 and gold chains *

1193
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:39,016
* Long nights, I'm not free

1194
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,885
* Fuck that, I know me

1195
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:42,519
* Greater self, I owe me

1196
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,354
* Almost took my life at 19

1197
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,090
* Honestly, you don't know me

1198
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,958

00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,660

00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:56,701

00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,804

00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,473

00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,209

* I can't take it

1210
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:11,081
* I can't take it

1211
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,818
(fast rap music)

1212
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,268
- Get out, get out!

1213
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:34,905
I will kill you
 before you kill me!

1214
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,641
- Bill, what the
 hell are you doing?

1215
00:59:36,641 --> 00:59:38,475
- Cecilia, I've had it!

1216
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,711
I'm not gonna take
 his shit anymore!

1217
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:41,545
No more!

1218
00:59:43,648 --> 00:59:45,549
- He sold the car.

1219
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:46,383
- Dad's car?

1220
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:47,852
- Yeah.

1221
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:50,721
He said he heard a number
 on the radio, called,

1222
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:53,590
they came, they took the car,
 they gave him $200 dollars.

1223
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:03,367
I'm afraid of him.

1224
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,306
For him, for all of us.

1225
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:18,649
You know, we've had
 to start sleeping

1226
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,450
with the doors locked at night.

1227
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:24,922
The other night I woke up
 and he was hovering over me.

1228
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,256
He said he's been hearing voices

1229
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:28,659
in his head and they
 tell him what to do.

1230
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:31,428
- Oh yeah, right, so
now he's schizophrenic?

1231
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,130
- Oh, Sam.

1232
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:41,038
You know, when you were little
 I was scared of this moment.

1233
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:43,674
The moment when
 children stop being

1234
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,342
children and they become adults.

1235
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:48,679
But it never comes.

1236
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:54,084
No matter what you do
 or how bad it gets,

1237
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,722
you'll always be
 my little babies.

1238
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:06,997
- How much is in there?

1239
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,866
- [Cecilia] 10 grand.

1240
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,167
- [Alex] What did Dad say?

1241
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,068
- He doesn't know.

1242
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:14,905
- He lied to us.

1243
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:17,908
- Have you thought about what

1244
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:18,743
you're gonna do with the money?

1245
01:01:18,743 --> 01:01:19,576
- What do you mean?

1246
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:20,510
- It's a lot of money.

1247
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,946
- I'm not taking that money.

1248
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:23,180
- You can cover the
 funeral expenses with it.

1249
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,382
- I already said, I'm
not touching that money.

1250
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:26,216
- [Sam] Why not?

1251
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,551
- Why not?

1252
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:28,919
What's the matter with you?

1253
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,255
Think for a second!

1254
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:33,257
- It's true though, you've
 already lost so much.

1255
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,992
- That money got
 your brother killed!

1256
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:36,226
- Yeah, we understand that, Mom,

1257
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,928
but right now you
 and Dad need it.

1258
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:41,098
- How much did you loan
me for the funeral?

1259
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:42,399
- Oh, that doesn't matter.

1260
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:44,334
- Alex, how much did
you lend me, two grand?

1261
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:45,569
- Mom, please.

1262
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:46,570
- Here, here you
 go, take the money.

1263
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,404
Take the money.

1264
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:48,773
Alright, you happy?

1265
01:01:48,773 --> 01:01:50,107
Now get the hell out!

1266
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:53,010
Get out, get the hell out!

1267
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:53,844
Go!

1268
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,760
(melancholy violin music)

1269
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,666
- Whoa.
- Jesus.

1270
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,168
- Watch where
 you're going, bitch.

1271
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:06,176
- [Michelle Voiceover]
 This dude owns a Maserati!

1272
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:09,179
- [Cameron Voiceover]
Ma, you know who he is.

1273
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,816
The guy with the Maserati.

1274
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:15,552
(dramatic music)

1275
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,775
(knocking)

1276
01:06:18,775 --> 01:06:19,709
- Oh, shit.

1277
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,881
(speaking foreign language)

1278
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,083
What are you doing here?

1279
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:29,753
- Why haven't you
 returned my calls?

1280
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:30,954
- I've been busy.

1281
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,156
- Yeah, Dad spoke to me.

1282
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:34,258
He said you didn't
 come home last night.

1283
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:35,192
- Sam, please.

1284
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:36,526
- You're losing the house?

1285
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:39,329
What happened to
 you getting a job?

1286
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,934
It's always gonna be
 like this, isn't it?

1287
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,003
- Like what, huh?

1288
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,338
Like what?

1289
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,406
Am I supposed to just forget

1290
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:50,974
that my son died six months ago?

1291
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:52,542
Or that the man who killed him

1292
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:54,444
is out there
 walking around free?

1293
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:55,812
- How do you know that?

1294
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:57,314
- You lied to me, Sam!

1295
01:06:57,314 --> 01:06:59,216
You lied to me!

1296
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:00,517
I saw him!

1297
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,718
I smelled him!

1298
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,787
I looked into his eyes
 and you know what?

1299
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:07,191
He had no idea who I was
or what he did to me.

1300
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:09,559
So, I'm sorry if this is all
 a little bit too emotional

1301
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,828
for you, but right now
 my world has changed!

1302
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:13,563
- Yeah, well you're not alone!

1303
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:15,365
I loved Cameron, too!

1304
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,601
But do you think he cared about
the pain that he brought us?

1305
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:19,536
The danger he put us in?

1306
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:20,804
No!

1307
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:23,173
I think about how lucky
we were to have left

1308
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:24,641
before everything
happened in that house!

1309
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,143
That's what I think
 about and I think

1310
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:27,211
about it every single day!

1311
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,278
And I'm thankful.

1312
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:29,479
You know, I was thankful for

1313
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:30,814
the fact that I
 was alive after it.

1314
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:32,582
I was thankful for the
fact that you were safe.

1315
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:34,651
And a part of me was
 thankful for the peace

1316
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:37,287
that I thought that his
 death would bring our family!

1317
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:39,856
- You son of a bitch!
 - Mom, Mom!

1318
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:41,725
Mom, Mom, you stop!

1319
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:42,959
He's gone, alright?

1320
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:43,860
He's gone!

1321
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,694
He's gone!

1322
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:47,397
He's fucking gone
 and oh my, God,

1323
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,532
the way that he still haunts our

1324
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:51,368
family is just
 fucking unbelievable!

1325
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:52,602
So I don't know
 what your plans are,

1326
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:54,371
I don't know if you're gonna let

1327
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:57,307
this destroy you, but
 I'm done and I'm gone.

1328
01:07:58,308 --> 01:07:59,143
- Sam.

1329
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:01,611
Sam!

1330
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:22,432
(dramatic music)

1331
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:55,825
Don't move.

1332
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:02,031
I think about everything
you've taken from me.

1333
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:05,769
Everything I've
 loved and I think

1334
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:07,571
there must be a
 reason for all this.

1335
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,608
There must be a balance.

1336
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:15,645
Maybe this will
 help tip the scales.

1337
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:20,183
(gun firing)

1338
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:25,021
(Bosco gasping)

1339
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:29,326
- I can't move, I can't move!

1340
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:30,960
Help me!

1341
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,228
Help me!

1342
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,464
No, no, no, no, fuck!

1343
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:38,668
- Rot in hell, you
 son of a bitch.

1344
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:41,505
(muffled yelling)

1345
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:00,524
(gasping)

1346
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:17,741
(haunting laughter)

1347
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:28,418
Cameron?

1348
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,228
(gasping)

1349
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:03,453
(dramatic music)

1350
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:11,861
(speaking foreign language)

1351
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:13,963
- What the hell did
 you bring in with you?

1352
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:18,201
I felt you coming.

1353
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:20,404
Come on.

1354
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:06,315
Why did you come here?

1355
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:07,651
- I need help.

1356
01:13:07,651 --> 01:13:08,585
- Yes, you do.

1357
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,688
- I need to get rid of someone.

1358
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:16,760
(speaking foreign language)

1359
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,627
- A curse?

1360
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,983
I think I have a better
solution for you.

1361
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,722
- I don't understand.

1362
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:47,557
- [Sorida] You will.

1363
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,224
- Why are you so
fucking nervous?

1364
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:23,459
We haven't done anything yet.

1365
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,662
Sweetheart, lose the shades.

1366
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:28,665
Put your hands up against
 the fucking fence.

1367
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:29,866
- What?

1368
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:30,800
- Come on, let's
 go, I'm in a hurry.

1369
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,235
- [Cecilia] What are you doing?

1370
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:33,402
- I wanna make sure
 you're not a goddamn cop.

1371
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:34,437
- I, I'm not a cop.
 - Stop moving.

1372
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:42,111
- So, what do we do now?

1373
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,313
- You got a picture,
 a name, an address?

1374
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,649
What do you got?

1375
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:46,616
- [Cecilia] Yes, all of it.
 - Give it to me.

1376
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:51,955
What did he do?

1377
01:14:53,356 --> 01:14:57,527
No, actually, I don't really
give a fuck, I had a long week.

1378
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:03,733
My fee is $6,000 dollars,
 cash, upfront, not negotiable.

1379
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:05,535
Do you understand that?

1380
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:07,403
- Okay.

1381
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:10,406
Anything else?

1382
01:15:10,406 --> 01:15:13,242
- I'll call you and I'll
see you in a few days.

1383
01:15:44,608 --> 01:15:46,676
You are fucking late.
 - I'm sorry.

1384
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:47,811
- We're on, 5 p.m.

1385
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:04,794
- [Sam] How is she?

1386
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:08,998
- I don't know.

1387
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:16,973
Remember I told you about Miami?

1388
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,742
- Yeah, yeah.

1389
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:22,078
- Me and Deanna
 are gonna head down

1390
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:24,280
there this weekend and
 check out this house.

1391
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:27,083
- Oh.

1392
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,618
- Her parents said we could stay

1393
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:29,552
with them until
 we find something.

1394
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:35,358
- That's great,
 that's great, wow.

1395
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:36,292
I hear the housing market is

1396
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,695
looking really great down there.

1397
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:41,731
- Yeah, it's picking up.

1398
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:49,172
Alright, man.

1399
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,542
I gotta get back to work.

1400
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:57,213
Call you later.

1401
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:58,214
- Alex, hey.

1402
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,157
- It's a book.

1403
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:09,793
- Yeah, it's a book.

1404
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,466
- Thanks, Mom.

1405
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:24,007
(tense music)

1406
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,783
- It's 5:15, where are you?

1407
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:36,219
You told me to be
 here at 5 o'clock.

1408
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:37,053
Call me back!

1409
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:40,356
Shit!

1410
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:47,697
Where is he?

1411
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:48,732
- [Sorida] What?

1412
01:17:48,732 --> 01:17:50,333
- The man you sent me to.

1413
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,267
Where is he?

1414
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:52,201
- I don't know where he is.

1415
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:53,369
- You gave me his number,

1416
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:55,204
don't tell me you
don't know where he is.

1417
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:56,039
(speaking foreign language)

1418
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:56,873
- Stop!

1419
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:02,979
- What are you gonna
 do with that? (laughs)

1420
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:04,247
You're not gonna kill me.

1421
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:08,284
- Just tell me where he is.

1422
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:11,120
- You've known from
 the moment you walked

1423
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,758
in here what you
 had to do yourself!

1424
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:16,893
- Give me back the
 money I gave you.

1425
01:18:16,893 --> 01:18:17,827
- Or what?

1426
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:19,262
You gonna call the police?

1427
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:21,564
Tell them you wanted me
to hire you a hit man?

1428
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:24,834
(laughing)

1429
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:52,061
- [Cecilia Voiceover]
 You're to blame.

1430
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,229
Maybe you are.

1431
01:18:55,598 --> 01:18:56,665
(kissing)

1432
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,868
- [Cameron] Okay, okay.

1433
01:18:58,868 --> 01:19:00,703
- [Sorida Voiceover] You've
known from the moment you walked

1434
01:19:00,703 --> 01:19:03,672
in here what you
 had to do yourself!

1435
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,746
- [Cecilia Voiceover]
 I love you, papa.

1436
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,048
- [Cameron Voiceover]
 I love you too, Mom.

1437
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:19,455
I'm gonna go clean.

1438
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,325
I promise.

1439
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,594
(speaking foreign language)

1440
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,531
(tires screeching)

1441
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:35,571
(knocking)

1442
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,948
(gun firing)

1443
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:48,852
- [Cecilia Voiceover]
 Sam, can you hear me?

1444
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:55,158
Can you hear me?

1445
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:58,061
(melancholy music)
