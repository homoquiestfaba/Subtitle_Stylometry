CAPTAIN: Good afternoon,
this is your captain again.

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,160
We're about 80 miles north
of Miami International.

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
We are about to begin
our final approach.

5
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,920
I'd like to take this time,
on behalf of the crew,

6
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,920
to thank you for
flying with us today.

7
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,840
And we hope you'll
include Carnival Airlines

8
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,240
in your future travel plans.

Miss Hamilton?

12
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,880
We'll be landing in
just a few minutes.

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Lauren, welcome.

15
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,280
You look fabulous, as always.

16
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,080
Raul?

17
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,960
Thank you.

18
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
Are you blind?

19
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,480
No, I always carry
this one myself.

20
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,880
Raul remembered.

21
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,560
So are you happy,
healthy, psyched?

22
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,960
We've got a full night's
work ahead of us.

23
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Now the good news--

24
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,640
no more hotel.

25
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,400
Daddy bought this nice little
villa for clients to stay.

26
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,000
She's our 9:15.

27
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,200
The Italian blonde's our 9:30.

28
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,920
But you have got to see Heidi.

29
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
She'll be by as soon as she's
off her shoot in Key West.

30
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,080
You'll see her, you'll
want her, you'll grab her.

31
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,080
Excuse me.

32
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,320
Let's leave the ladies alone.

33
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,640

going to the dogs.

00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,640
Don't you want to make
sure it's all there?

36
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm sure it is.

37
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,040
I see you're still not shaving.

38
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,320
My father lets him
get away with it.

39
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,080
See if you can avoid
the traffic, will you?

40
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,800
We are not running
on Spanish time.

LAUREN: I'm not using the
perfume bottle in these shots.

42
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,640
I'm going for
something different.

43
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,240
Right, right, right, right.

45

Don't you worry, Lauren.

46
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
I'm going to keep you
up to your ears in them.

47
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
I only need one--

48
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,200
the right one.

49
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,440
Now, Lauren, you're not
going to get picky on me again,

50
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,560
are you?

51
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,760
I mean, last time
was bad enough.

52
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,320
This isn't just
another job, Jennifer.

53
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,760
Oh, please.

54
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
All they ever want is
something sleek and sexy.

55
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,560
No, that's just it.

56
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,680
They don't want slick this time.

57
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,160
They want it real, provocative.

58
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,760
Not glossy, but raw.

59
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,720
Raw?

60
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,240
Yeah, they want it passionate.

61
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,040
Something that strikes a nerve.

62
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,400
You know, I don't even know
myself how to get it yet.

63
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,320
So, is the husband
taking a later flight?

64
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,240
No, Stephen is
staying in New York.

JENNIFER: It's
gorgeous, isn't it?

69
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,200
Mrs. Spencer will show
you up to the bedroom.

70
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Hi, it's me.

71
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,400
Yeah, well we'll be
there within the hour.

72
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,760
As soon as she's changed.

73
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,600
Order in some dinner
from next door.

74
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,760
Any calls?
Yeah.

75
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,680
Is that it?

[phone ringing]

77
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
Should I get
that, Mrs. Hamilton?

78
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,240
No.

79
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,400
But do me a favor-- hang
up the things in that one.

80
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
Hello?

81
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,840

82
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,400
Yeah, just now.

83
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,760
Fine.
How did you find me?

84
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,040
Well, you're being awfully
attentive all of the sudden.

85
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,560
How do you expect me to be?

86
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
Yeah, well, maybe you should
have thought about that before.

87
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,720
Yes, you said that.

88
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,640
But over for you and whoever
she is is one thing, for me--

89
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,280
Stephen, I don't want to have
this conversation now, OK?

90
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,080
I've got work to do.

91
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,480
Yes.

92
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,280

Thanks, that's a great help.

94

I thought you'd like
it a little cooler.

95
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,760
Yes, that's-- thank you.

96
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I don't need anything else.

97
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,720
I mean, you can tell Jennifer
and Miss Perkins I'll

Jennifer.

150
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
She always gives you
such a hard time.

151
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,120
But it doesn't mean anything.

152
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,960
No?

153
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,720
Well, it's a job.

154
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
I work for Mr. Perkins.

155
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,640
If he wants me to drive
his daughter around,

156
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,840
that's fine with me.

157
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,240
Yeah, he's an interesting guy.

158

LAUREN: I wish I knew.

162
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,160
It's usually pretty simple.

163
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,360
I see the face I want,
I know what to shoot.

164
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,040
But it's not about
a face this time.

165
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,520
It's about an image that's sexy.

166
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,800
For real, not just flash.

167
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,080
It can't be fake.

168
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,280
It has to be felt.

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,720
Turn your back to me.

367
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,600
Good.

368
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,840
Over your shoulder.

369
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
OK.

[music playing]

371
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,040
This is it, dammit.

372
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,320
This is what I'm looking for.

373
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,920
So are we cooking, or what?

374
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,520
Heidi's ready.

375
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,920
Oh, good.

376
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,200
Where the hell have you been?

377
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,080
I need those dresses
picked up at Finerlooms.

380
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,120
Yeah.

381
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,600
You have a good time?

382
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,680
Yeah.

383
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,680
OK.

384
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,520
I want you thinking about that.

385
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,560
I want you to think about
the way it was last time.

386
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,440
OK.

387
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,800
Turn your back.

388
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,200
Look at me, all right.

389
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,160
And run your hands
down your body.

390
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,680
Imagine they're his hands.

391
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,400
It feels good, doesn't it?

392
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,320
His hands feel good
on your skin, huh?

393
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,640
Good.

394
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,520
Imagine his fingers
touching your breasts.

395
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,600
He's taking your dress
off down your hips.

396
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,600
Good.

397
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,520

398
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,080

how to touch you.

He's making you hot, excited.

402
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,440

406
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
It feels good.

407
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,400
Move with it.

408
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,240
[shutter clicks]

409
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,200
He's behind you now.

410
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,040
His lips are over your ear,
telling you every nasty thing

411
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
he's going to do to you.

412
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,640
You feel him inside.

413
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,920
You feel him getting harder.

414
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
That's it.

415
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,080
You're so hot, so excited.

416
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,320
You could come now.

417
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,640
What?

418
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,440
Why are you stopping?

419
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,240
What?

420
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,040
JENNIFER: So, where
the hell is he?

421
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,880
LAUREN: It's only five after.

422
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,760
I swear one of these days
I'm going to kick his slick ass

423
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,360
back across the Bay.

424
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,560
[laughs] Jennifer.

425
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,840
What is bothering
you about Raul?

426
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,760
He seems perfectly nice to me.

427
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
He just--

428
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,400
I don't know.

429
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,360
Ever since daddy let him start
working with art collection,

430
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,280
he acts like he knows something.

431
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,960
Well, he's not dumb.

432
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,760
No, but God, a few years ago
he could barely speak English.

433
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,800
And now he runs around our
estate like he owns it.

434
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,480
Daddy just promised him
a piece of sculpture

435
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,440
that's worth a small fortune.
It's ridiculous.

436
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,840
Look, I got to book, babe.

437
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,640
Are you sure I can't help you?
- No, it's OK.

438
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm sure he'll be here.

439
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,920
Well, if he's not here in
five would you let me know?

440
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,360
I'll see you at Dad's

441
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,200
Speak of the devil.

LAUREN: Wait a second.

444
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,320
Raul, where are we going?

445
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,760
RAUL: You'll see in a minute.

449
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,400
What did you say to them?

450
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,640
I said, don't
even think about it.

451
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:55,160
[speaking spanish] Marissa?

452
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,000
Here, ask her anything you want.

453
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
She's perfect, perfect.

454
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,400
The real thing,
she's got it all.

455
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,520
Talk about raw passion.

456
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,280
The way she was on the roof.

457
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,080
The look she had
on her face when

458
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,240
she lifted her
skirt for that guy,

459
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,120
if I can just get that on film.

460
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,520
Of course Jennifer will have
a fit, she's so high on Heidi.

461
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,720
I'll use them both.

462
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,880
Besides, once Jennifer
sees her she's

463
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,600
going to sing her up for life.

464
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
As long as she
shows up tomorrow.

465
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,800
Oh, she'll be there.

466
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,280
Yeah.

467
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
OK.

468
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,280
Thanks, Raul I owe you one.

469
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,200
It's nothing.

470
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,920
What?

471
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,480
Nothing.

472
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,440
I just have never seen
you without your--

473
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,960
Nikon bag, I know.

474
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,960
I feel naked without it.

475
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,480
But I've got my little
Canon right here.

476
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,120
Wait, I have an idea.

477
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You'll be my date.

480
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,680

482
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,520
Come on.

483
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,640
The guest of honor.

Raul, [speaking spanish]

485
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,440
I'm sorry we're late.

486
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,560
Oh, as if cared.

487
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,880
We simply started without you.

488
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,800
You look exquisite.

489
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,720
Thank you.

490
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,320
Raul, are you joining us?

491
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,840
Well, I couldn't show up
without an escort, now could I?

492
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,640
Oh, we'll just get
another setting here.

493
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,000
There you are.

494
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,840
Thank you.

495
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
I'll get another chair.

496
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,680
Fine.

497
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,800
Jennifer, we have found
the perfect blue girl.

498
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,120
You're going to love
her, Jennifer I know it.

499
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,000
JENNIFER: But, how can you tell?

500
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,560
I saw her dance, if
you could call it that.

501
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,000
It was more like foreplay.

502
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,480
I've never seen a woman
taking so much pleasure

503
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,520
in her own body, and in public.

504
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,560
It was like nobody was
there but her and her lover.

505
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,040
And I wanted to talk to
her, so we followed them.

506
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,920
Then, they really
started getting into it.

507
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,800
Oh.

508
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,960
Squeeze it right here.

509
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,960
Did they know that
you were watching them?

510
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,280
No.

511
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,240
But it looked like
she was on fire.

512
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,160
But she was still in
control, taunting this guy.

513
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,360
How do you mean?

514
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,640
Well, she took down her
dress, and she's teasing

515
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,960
him with this magnificent body.

516
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,200
And she's letting him
kiss her, and then she's

517
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,200
pushing him away.

518
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,560
I mean, even when he
got her panties off,

519
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,920
she wouldn't let
him go any further.

520
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,280
It was like, not yet.

521
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,120
He got so excited.

522
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,200
It was like he was a slave.

523
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,840
And then?

524
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:26,400
Well, then finally,
he took her from behind.

525
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,360
STAN PERKINS: [laughs] That
sounds my idea of a night out.

526
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,960

529
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,720
You watched all this?

LAUREN: I couldn't
take my eyes off her.

531
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,120
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

532
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,600
Is this your husband?

533
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,920
LAUREN: No, Mrs. Perkins,
my husband isn't here.

534
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,480
It's Raul, Mom.

535
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,880
You remember.

536
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,880
You make a lovely couple.

537

he's the chauffeur.

in the cafeteria this afternoon

542

Thank you.

543
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,680
It's good with coffee.

544
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,440
You want some more?

545
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,240
Yes.

546
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
I'd like one of those, too.

00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,960
actually.

550
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,760
They passed this technique down
from generation to generation.

551
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,600
See the detail work here?

552
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,840
Amigo.

553
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,080
A new shipment just came in.

554
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,080
When can you work on it?

555
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,800
I'll start this week.

556
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,720
Thank you.

557
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,160
Nice having you.

558
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,520
[music playing]

559
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,440
That's the collection.

560
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,880
I'll show you.

561
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,320
[music playing]

562
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,520
Mr. P hired me to open
crates when I was a teenager.

563
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,280
It started as a few
days work, but it

564
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,040
turned into a full-time job.

565
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,160
I got into the
old man's passion.

566
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,400
It's a private world of his.

567
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,480
He opened the door
for me, you know.

568
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,840
And now I'm helping him
organize the entire collection.

569
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Mr. P gave me this one.

570
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,360
Beautiful.

571
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,480
It's from the Pacific Rim.

572
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,560
[inaudible] The
silverfish lovers.

573
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,320
This one-- he's a young
fisherman who hunted

574
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,120
silverfish.

575
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,480
He found this cove
where the fish lived

576
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,680
No, stay there.

577
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,920
Go on.

578
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,640
Oh, you don't mind, do you?

579
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,880
It's just for fun, for me.

580
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,160
Go on.

581
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,240
He found this cove
where the fish lived.

582
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,000
He was in the water.

583
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
[shutter clicking]

584
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,760
He had the fish cornered,
with a spear raised.

585
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,600
But he waited.

586
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,120
He couldn't do it.

587
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,600
And the full moon, seeing
this, turned him into a fish.

588
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,680
And they spent the night
together in that cove.

589
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,440
And the next day, the fisherman
returned to his village

590
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,320
with a beautiful maiden,
with hair of shining silver.

591
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,400
She only stayed with him
until the next full moon,

592
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,920
then she disappeared.

593
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,200
The fisherman searched
the river and the cove.

594
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,600
He never found the silverfish.

595
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,840
He never was able to hunt again.

596
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,600
Wow, that's a beautiful story

597
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,560
It's my turn.

598
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
No, really.

599
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,400
I'm better behind the lense.

600
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,080
It's only fair.

601
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,840
All right, you can take one.

602
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,200
Focus with this.

Now.

608
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,600
- Mm mm.
- Oh yes.

609
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,280
Put your hand behind
your shoulder.

610
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,280
That's good.

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,680
I'm sorry.

627
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,080
Thank you.

628
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,520
You're welcome.

629
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,720
Oh, in the morning--

630
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,480
Yes?

631
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,240
Could you come
by a little earlier

632
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,280
and help me with the equipment?

633
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,960
Sure.

634
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,800
It's going to be
a long day tomorrow.

635
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,760
And you're sure she'll show up--
Marissa?

636
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,800
She'll be there.

637
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,280

you to come home.

So, what?

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,800
Aren't you going
to invite me in?

God, I'd forgotten how
hot it would be down here.

Whew.

00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,600
I knew you'd be surprised.

655
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,160
But I was just kind of hoping
for pleasantly surprised.

Wow, this is nice.

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,680

called, Stephen.

Ah, shoulda, coulda, woulda.

Look, you're still
a little upset.

rated a little kiss.

I can feel it.

And I can feel it in your kiss.

I've felt this all before.

Or maybe I read it wrong,
but I can't wait that long.

This love's weighing heavy
on my heart, on my heart.

Well.

00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,640
I admit that I was wrong.

714
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,560
Maybe it's all been
too much for me.

715
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,200
I was feeling a
little threatened.

You're just so good
at everything you do.

717

someone so talented,

starts to feel--

Good, Stephen, blame me and
flatter me at the same time.

721
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,480
I'm not blaming you.

722
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,200
I'm saying that I did what I did
because of my own insecurities.

It wasn't you, babe.

LAUREN: It didn't mean anything.

726

I know.

before, Stephen.

00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,080
You said that old barn
would make a dream studio

732
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,000
[laughs] Oh God,
this is so like you.

733
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,720
Something's wrong, so you
just throw money at it.

734
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,400
No, no, this is different.

735
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,120
This is what you wanted.

736
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,880
I did it for you, for us.

737
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,560
So we could have a
place, and the time

738
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,640
to make a new beginning.

739
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,280
All right, Stephen.

740
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,320
You say that you want us
to be there for each other.

741
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,080
Well, that means all
the time, not just

742
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,520
want a crisis like this
forces you to pay attention.

743
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,400
Yes.

744
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,600
Yes, absolutely.

745
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,280
You know, these daytime
assignments have done

746
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,200
wonders for your self-esteem.

747
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,000
I've never seen
you so assertive.

748
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,200
It's really attractive

749
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,440
Stephen.

750
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,440
A chance, that's
all I'm asking for.

751
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,760
Just say you'll think about it.

752
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,640
All right?

753
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,400
Come here, come here, come here.

754
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,680

Hi, cookie.

759
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,560
LAUREN: Clifford, did you
pack the extra umbrellas?

760
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,760
You decided to
work on your tan, eh?

761
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,480
I do hope you brought
some swimwear.

762
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,840
Raul, you finally shaved.

763
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,080
What's the occasion?

764
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,520
So, where's wonder girl?

765
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,000
She's supposed
to meet us here.

766
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,920
She's late.

767
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,480
Where is she, Raul?

768
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,440
I took your word on this.

769
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,680
Well, who can you
trust these days?

770
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,200
Stop it.

771
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,040
She'll be here.

772
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,600
We've got to get this
show on the road, babe.

773
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,880
So we'll use Heidi.

774

You won't even miss
this flake of yours.

775
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,840
You've got 10 pieces on board.

776

I've got you for
the day, don't I?

780
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,280
I'm going to need your
muscle on the island, Raul.

781
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,840
Get back on board.

782
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,040

there's something

917
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,880
STEPHEN: How about a
little refreshment, huh?

918
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,400
Woo.

919
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,280
[laughs]

920
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,160
LAUREN: Has anybody
seen my camera bag?

921
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,160
My bag's missing.

922
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,560
Clifford, where's the Nikon?

923
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,560
[sighs] Shit.

924
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,840
You heard what he said, hon.

925
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,440
We can't go back in
the middle of this.

926
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,000
It's not safe.
It's too shallow.

927
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:40,920
Screw this shit.

928
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,480
I want a dinghy.

929
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,760
All right, all right.

930
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,040
He needs both of his
crewmen up on deck.

931
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,800
My shot is in
that role, dammit.

932
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,720
I'm not going to stand
around here and do nothing.

933
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,600
You just have to wait it
out, sweetheart This should

934
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,960
blow over within an hour.

935
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,280
I'll send Raul after it
the minute this lets up.

936
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,000
I'd go back for
you myelf, but I'm

937
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,960
not familiar with those motors.

938
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,680
JENNIFER: Lauren?

939
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,400
Yes, yes, I hear you.

940
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,000
JENNIFER: I'm with
you, babe You better

941
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,520
stay where you are for now.

942
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,200
Kiefer says it's going to
get worse before it lifts,

943
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,000
and it's going to have a hell
of a time getting you moored up

944

[inaudible] again.

945
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,880
So just stay put, will you?

946
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,200
All right.

947
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,080
We're lucky.

948
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,360
You know, I was
depending on you, Raul.

949
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,400
And you just disappeared
like that today.

950
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,480
Listen, everybody else is
into their own bullshit Raul,

951
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,520
I would like to think that you
and I could play it straight.

952
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,440
Straight?

953
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,080
Right.

954
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,640
I'm sorry, OK.

955
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,560
I'm sorry that
Marissa went too far.

956
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,640
I'm so sorry Stephen showed up.

957
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,360
I'm sorry we haven't
had two seconds

958
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,720
to just talk to each other
about what's happened.

959
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,920
It meant nothing.

960
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,600
It doesn't matter

961
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,400
Raul, no

962
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,680
What is there to talk about?

963
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,840
You belong to him, right?

964
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,240
You had an itch.

965
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,200
You scratched it.

966
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,120
Yeah.

967
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,160
And now?

968
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,160
It's over.

969
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,600
It is over.

970
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,160
Stop it.

971
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:12,960
Don't.

972
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,400
It doesn't matter, right?

973
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,480
[music playing]

974
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,920
[SINGING] More than a
dream, closer than a shadow.

975
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,400
I can feel you near.

976
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:12,400
Oh something you're
saying is touching me.

977
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,800
There's a ringing in my head.

978
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:23,360
All along I tried to prepare.

979
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:30,840
Nothing comes close to how
we feel when we're together.

980
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,840
And when you touch
me, I keep holding on.

981
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:41,320
I pray forever is
one day you'll come.

982
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,840
It's more than words.

983
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:50,800
Now that I found you,
I'll never let go.

984
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,720
I'll never let go.

985
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,800
All of my nights

986
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:08,280
Were empty and shallow,
but now filled with tears.

987
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:14,280
Ooh reach out and hold
me, let your love control

988
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,160
me till the river is here.

989
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,720
Tonight I cure all our fears.

990
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:32,720
I want you so much, I need
to feel our hearts together.

991
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,720
And when you touch
me, I keep holding on.

992
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,200
Hold on.

993
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:44,200
I pray forever is
one day you'll come.

994
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,680
It's more than words.

01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:53,200
Now that I found you,
I'll never let go.

996
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,680
Ho ho.

997
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,680
And when you touch
me, I keep holding on.

998
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:05,160
I pray forever is
one day you'll come.

999
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,640
It's more than words.

1000
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:13,160
Now that I found you,
I'll never let go.

1001
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,160
I won't let go.

1002
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,640
Oh no no.

1003
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,640
And when you touch
me, I keep holding on.

1004
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,840
RAUL: So, what now?

1005
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,440
Now you go back to
your husband again?

1006
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,800
He says he's changed.

1007
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,840
Me, I don't have to change

1008
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,800
Oh, so I'd be
better off with you,

1009
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,720
is that what you're saying?

1010
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,640
I can make you very happy

1011
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,720
Yes, for now.

1012
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,520
Is that all?

1013
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,280
You don't want more.

1014
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,680
I know you.

1015
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,680
Yeah, I do.

1016
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,800
What, you really want
a future with me?

1017
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,640
I don't think so.

1018
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,120
You just like what's
going on right now.

1019
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,400
And you?

1020
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,480
Forget about it.

1021
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,080
I'm completely confused.

1022
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:13,480
But I should thank you.

1023
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,440
Thank me?

1024
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,960
Yeah.

1025
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
You taught me something.

1026
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,600
You taught me how to
just let myself be.

1027
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,560
And that's a freedom and a
feeling I didn't even know

1028
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,560
existed.
And you got me there.

1029
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,040
You got your shot.

1030
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,920
Yeah, and what did you get?

1031
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,560
What do you want, really?

1032
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,080
How long are you going
to live like this.

1033
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,440
And don't give me,
it's a good job.

1034
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,960
Well?

1035
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,400
Well, what?

1036
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,320
You could have so much more.

1037
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,280
Mrs. Hamilton, are you there?

1038
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,160
Mrs. Hamilton, are you there?

1039
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,040
Yeah.

1040
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,880
Is the camera OK?

1041
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,520
Ah, it survived.

1042
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,520
Good.

1043
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,520
The coast is clear.

1044
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,400
We're heading back in.

1045
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,360
OK, we're on our way.

1046
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:10,920
We better go.

1048
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,640
You got it?

1049
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:42,440
Great.

1050
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,920
JENNIFER: Yeah, I'm
sure it was nothing.

1051
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,080
Look, that might be the kind
of line you feed your wife.

1052
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,440
[inaudible] Hey, babe.

1053
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,080
We were just about to
call out the Coast Guard.

1054
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,080
JENNIFER: Um, did you--

1055
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,400
did you find the camera?

1056
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,760
Uh huh.

1057
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,640
STEPHEN: Quite a storm, huh?

1058
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,760
God, I missed you.

1059
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,920
I need to get out
of these clothes.

1060
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,840
JENNIFER: Of course.

1061
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,520
Sure.

1062
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,280
I'll um-- I'm going to get Terry
to pull one of the garment bags

1063
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,520
for you.

1064
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,040
LAUREN: No, I can manage.

1065
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:31,840
Don't.

1066
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,040
How you feeling?

1067
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,600
Fine.

1068
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,840
You look a little beat.

1069
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:54,200
I guess the extra
trip overtired you.

1070
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:58,280
I thought it was a bit much, you
and Raul, going in on your own

1071
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,640
like that.

1072
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,120
It was something you had to do.

1073
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
I understand that.

1074
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,040

1075
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,320
[laughs] Thank you
Oh, you know the one

1076
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,280
across form the Biltmore?

1077
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,120
Oh, it's perfect for drinks.

1078
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,360
Terry, Marissa can
come in your car.

1079
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,680
Mm, gracias.

1080
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,080
No, thank you, Marissa.

1081
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,920
You really made it happen.

1082
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,480
She certainly did.

1083
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,920
Now, you know, I can
invest that for you

1084
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,440
and practically double it.

1085
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,080
Really, Marissa, this
is only the beginning.

1086
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,280
Now, if you come with
my agency, I can have

1087
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,360
you working whenever you want.

1088
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,640
No, thanks.

1089

One day with you guys
is enough for me.

1090
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,880
I'm out of here.

1091
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,920
Hey, babe.

1092
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:08,720
Oh.

1093
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,040
JENNIFER: Can you
believe this girl?

1094
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:17,920
Flake.

1095
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,040
What did I tell you?

1096
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,680
An absolute, total flake.

1097
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,000
Thank you.

1098
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,760
JENNIFER: Raul, is my
phone still in the car?

1099
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,360
Well, then must
still be on board.

1100
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,040
Honestly, I shouldn't
even pay him for the day.

1101
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,920
He can't keep track of anything.

1102
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:40,960
Well, what are you waiting for?

1103
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,880
Go back on and get it.

1104
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,720
Get it yourself.

1105
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,600
JENNIFER: What?

1106
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,480
What did he say?

1107
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,800
You heard me.

1108
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,960
Look, I've had just
about enough of this.

1109
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,080
No, I've had enough of you.

1110
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,360
I quit.

1111
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,760
And I'll turn in the
keys to your father.

1112
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,040
JENNIFER: You slimey little--

1113
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,800
STEPHEN: Hey, hey ignore him.

1114
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,800
It's been a long day.

1115
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,840
We'll go for a drink.

1116
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,520
It's over, forget about it.

1117
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,240
Well, who the hell
does he think he is?

1118
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,680
It's over.

1119
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,120
Come on, let's go.

1120
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,400
We can fit in one car.

1121
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,480
LAUREN: Raul?

1122
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,280
Hey, babe?

1123
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:28,680
You two enjoy yourselves It
won't be the first time, right?

1124
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:33,120
Hey, Raul, mind
giving me a ride?

1125
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,080
STEPHEN: Wait a second.

1126
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,760
Lauren?

1127
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,760
Like you said
Stephen, it's over.

1128
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,880
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

1129
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,240
What are you doing?

1130
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,600
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

1131
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,600
I just didn't know how.

1132
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,920
Lauren.

1133
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,720
Stephen, you hurt me.

1134
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,480
And words don't
make that disappear.

1135
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,280
This doesn't.

1136
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,880
Now, I've got to go.

1137
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,600
And where is it that
you think you're going?

1138
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,360
I don't know, babe,
but don't wait up.

1139
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,880
[engine starting]

1140
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,880
[music playing]

1141
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,960
[laughter]

1142
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,880
[music playing]

1143
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,440
[SINGING] More than a
dream, closer than a shadow,

1144
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,880
I can feel you near.

1145
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Ooh something you're
sending is touching me.

1146
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,880
There's a ringing in my ear.

1147
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,840
All along I tried to prepare.

1148
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:11,640
Nothing comes close to how
we feel when we're together.

1149
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:17,120
And when you touch
me, I keep holding on.

1150
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:23,040
I'll pray forever is
one day you'll come.

1151
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,520
It's more than words.

1152
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,880
Now that I've found
you, I'll never let go.

I'll never let go

1154

and shallow but now filled

1155
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:55,760
with tears Ooh reached out and
hold me let your love control

1156
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:02,000

1157
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:06,800
Tonight I cure all our fears.

1158
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,200
I want you so much.

1159
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:14,000
I need to feel our
hearts together.

1160
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:19,120
And when you touch
me, I keep holding on.

1161
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:25,120
I'll pray forever is
one day you'll come.

1162
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:29,920
It's more than words
Now that I've found you,

1163
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,240
I'll never let go.

1164
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,720
And when you touch
me, I keep holding on.

1165
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:45,800
I pray forever is
one day you'll come.

1166
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,400
I need to hear
you say the words.

1167
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,920
Now that I've found
you, I'll never let go.

1168
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,920
I won't let go.

1169
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,200
Oh no no.

1170
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,200
And when you touch
me, I keep holding on.

1173
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,720

Whoa ho.

1175
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:23,880
And when you touch me,
I'll keep holding on.
