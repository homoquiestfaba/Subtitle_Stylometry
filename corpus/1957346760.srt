178
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,217
to say, "congratulations.

179
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,002
For 50 years you did the same
dull thing every dull day."

180

is a great tribute....

181
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,833
It's solid gold.

182
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,226
How much could
you get for it?

183
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,706
Rose, if you ever--

184
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,272
Well, what good's it
doing sitting up there?

185
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,274
That plaque belongs there
like you belong home!

186
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:26,626
Oh, anybody that
stays home is dead.

187
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,366
If I die, it won't
be from sitting.

188
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,674
It will be from fighting
to get up and get out!

Mr. Weber, you don't know
how to run your theater.

258
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,347
Your business is slipping.

259
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,479
You need youth!
Fresh young talent!

260
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,699
Madam Rose, I told
you this morning,

261
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,397
I told you this afternoon,
and I'm telling you now.

262
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,139
If there is anything
I hate worse than kids,

263
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:59,229
it's kids onstage!Shh!

264
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,884
Children, go play
in the alley.

265
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,799
Mr. Weber, that was
a rotten remark.

266
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,714
And if you were a gentleman,
you would apologize

267
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:06,889
and book my act.

268
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,108
I am not a gentleman.

269
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:11,111
Yes, you are!
Deep down you are.

270
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,678
Herbie, I've been looking
all over for you to get
your opinion of the show.

271
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,637
I doubled your Crackerjack
order, Ed.

272
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,117
That bad?

273
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,379
Except for a couple of acts.

274
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,989
I left a memo on your desk.

275
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23,253
Mr. Weber, you left me
in the middle of a sentence.

276
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,734
Madam Rose, you're always
in the middle of a sentence.

277
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:29,042
But if your show is as rotten as
this intelligent gentleman says,

278
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:32,567
you could certainly
try my act for a couple
of nights, couldn't he?

279
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,698
Yeah, he could.
You could, Ed.

280
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,004
What?

281
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,266
Your theater gets
a family audience.

282
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,877
They love kids.

283
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,269
And my kids are great.

284
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,054
They sure are.

285
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,012
How do
you know?I've seen 'em.

286
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,753
Where?In Seattle.

287
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,495
It would give your
show a lift, Ed.

288
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,932
Well...Listen--

289
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,978
Stop pushing.
Let me think it over.

290
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,288
Oh, gee...

291
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:59,681
It's hard for me
to say thanks.

292
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:01,291
You just said it.

293
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,684
Why'd he listen to you?

294
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,860
Everybody in show business
listens to anybody.

295
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,601
Besides, I used to book acts
into this theater.

296
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,820
Are you an agent?

297
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,954
I was, but I'm in
the candy business now.

298
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,956
I sell to vaudeville houses
all over the West.

299
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,218
How could you ever
leave show business?

300
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,177
When the acts I handled

301
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,397
had too little talent, I got
sick to my stomach-- ulcers.

302
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,877
Oh, you're too sympathetic.

303
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,183
Also, I went bust.

304
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:24,445
I was always giving
them my commission

305
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,968
and telling them
they got a raise.

306
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:28,318
The good Lord says
charity begins at home.

307
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:31,495
Well, I don't have a home.

308
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:36,370
You're not married?

309
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,589
I had five sisters
and the ugly one

310
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,243
didn't get married
until a year ago.

311
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,596
Why did you
help me just now?

312
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,468
I love kids.

313
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:50,210
Oh.

314
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:53,256
Also, I've seen
you before.Where?

315
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,779
Waiting outside
Weber's office.

316
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:57,217
You looked like a pioneer
woman without a frontier.

317
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,001
Hmm.

318
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:03,614
I, uh, I don't suppose you'd
consider being an agent again.

319
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:05,007
Would you consider
marrying again?

320
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,443
How do you know
I'm not married now?

321
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,358
I asked your kids about you.

322
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,143
Oh.

323
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:12,667
Well, after three husbands,

324
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,670
it takes a lot of butter to
get you back in the frying pan.

325
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:18,368
After 20 years
in show business,

326
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,371
you kind of breathe
better in the real world.

327
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,026
Funny.

328
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,986

I like you...

330
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,381
But I don't want marriage.

331
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,861
You like me...

332
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,255
But you don't want
show business.

333
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:39,650
That seems to leave
you there and me here.

334
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,913
That all depends on
how you look at it.

335
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:43,872
You look at what
we don't have.

336
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,179
I look at what

00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:11,358
It's from you.

542
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:13,229
well, I picked it out,
but Herbie paid for it

543
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:14,665
with his commission
for a whole month.

544
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,624
Old Herbie makes the same
salary we do.

545
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,365
Inside, you, and
get the coffee.

546
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:20,759
Here I am, busting to tell
Herbie about the dream I had.

547
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,238
Mama--

548
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:23,326
It's really in your honor
coming on the very

549
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,937
evening of your birthday.

550
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,503
Oh, baby, you'll love it.

551
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,724
Children, you'll all love it.

552
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,772
It's a new act.

553
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,817
Ohh...

554
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:41,823
In this dream I saw June singing
a song in, like, a barnyard.

555
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,826
And then a cow came onstage.

556
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,827
A cow?

557
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:47,394
Hey, that's
pretty sexy.

558
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:48,830
Not a real cow.

559
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:51,267
A kind of a dancing cow
with a great big smile.

560
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:53,748
And that cow-- that cow
leaned right over my bed

561
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,749
and spoke to me.

562
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,229
What did the cow say?

563
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:57,839
Madam Rose!

564
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:00,189
I'm not cooking in here,
Mr. Kringelein! That--

565
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,582
Open this door!

566
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,801
I'm dressing. That cow--

567
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,280
Madam Rose!

568
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:05,847
I'll call you tomorrow
when I'm finished!

569
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,414
Ah!

570
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,633
That dear, fat cow looked me
right in the eye and said,

571
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:12,549
"Rose, if you want to get
on the Orpheum circuit,
put me in your act."

572
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,029
Children, you know
what I'm gonna go?

573
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,553
You're gonna pay that
crummy cow and not us.

574
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:18,338
I ain't paying anybody.

575
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:19,730
But I'm gonna take
the cow's advice.

576
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:22,081
I'm gonna call the new act

577
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,996
"Dainty June and Her Farm Boys."

578
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,736
I'm gonna get more boys.

579
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,435
I'm gonna put the cow in the act
and Chowsie and the monkey

580
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:30,785
and Louise's present,
if you don't mind, honey.

581
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,135
But, Mama, I don't even
know what my present is.

582
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,096
No cooking, Madam Rose?

583
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:39,576
How dare you enter a lady's
boudoir without even knocking?

584
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,926
Vere is your hot plate?

585
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,493
"Vere" is your search warrant?Plan B!

586
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:47,280
Never in all my years
of running a theatrical
hotel, have I ever--

587
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:48,890
If you don't leave,
I'm gonna scream!

588
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,805
But you know the rules!

589
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,764
No cooking, no electrical
appliances...

590
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,723
No dogs, no cats,

591
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,246
No pets of any kind.

592
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:01,381
Happy birthday, darling.Oh, Mama.

593
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:02,643
It's a damn zoo.

594
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:04,297
Profanity in front
of my babies.

595
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,256
June, get the bible.
Get the bible!

596
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,216
You pack up this dirty
menagerie and get out!

597
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:12,914
You'll have to throw me out,
you rotten animal hater.

598
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,090
That's what he is.
Send for the S.P.C.A.

599
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:16,700
Send for the police.

600
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,486
I rented these two rooms
to one adult and three children.

601
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,923
And now I find one adult,
five pets,

602
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:25,274
and one, two, three, four--

603
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:26,885
You counted him twice!

604
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,930
A simple little birthday
party for my baby.

605
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,759
One, two, three--
Stand still!

606
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,501
Chow mein, I'd offer you some,
but there's only one egg roll.

607
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:35,937
How many people are
sleeping in that room?

608
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,504
What room, Mr. Kringelein?

609
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:40,159
This room, madam, this room.

610
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:43,553
There isn't a soul in this
room, Mr. Kringelein.

611
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:46,905
No, but I mean--Except you and me.

612
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,907
Argh! Mr. Kringelein!Stop it!

613
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,517
What are you trying to do?

614
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,521
Stop! Help! Help! Rape!

615
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:57,219
My babies! My babies!

616
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,352
Monster!

617
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,440
Oh!

618
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,050
Madam Rose, are you okay?

619
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:04,444
Thank you

620
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:08,187
A little birthday party--
chow mein, a tiny little cake.

621
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,363
Rose, Rose,
are you all right?

622
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:12,974
Rose, what's happened?
Are you okay, honey?

623
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,846
Sure, where have you been?
Ooh, Herbie, Mr. Kringelein,

624
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,067
the hotel manager--
he tried-- he tried to--

625
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:20,068
Again?

626
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:21,504
Well, I had to do something.

627
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,505
Herbie, don't you dare
apologize to him.

628
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:23,985
Where's Louise?

629
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,639
Fat lot you care.
Child has her birthday.

630
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:28,120
Does she like her present?I'm surprised you remembered.

631
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,557
Where have you been?
That's what I want to know.

632
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,994
Rose, this is
Mr. Goldstone.

Child has a birthday
once a year.

Mother...

736
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,703
We're paying for it,
ain't we?

737
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:52,182
You'll get an ulcer
like Herbie.

738
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:54,010
Besides, what the dogs
won't eat, we will.

739
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:56,012
Rose, did it ever occur to
you there might be somebody

740
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,188
in this world who
doesn't like Chinese food?

741
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,539
Don't be silly.
Who?

742
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,064
Don't you
like it, Herbie?

743
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:06,153
Sure, Rose,
I love it.

744
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:07,372
Did she?Yes, Mama.

745
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:08,808
That's a healthy-wealthy
lady-wadie.

746
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:10,418
Oh, God.Herbie's angry.

747
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,507
Herbie's never angry.
It's bad for his stomach.

748
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:14,988
Come on, girls, beddie-bye.It's so early.

749
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,034
But you have to audition
for Mr. T.T. Grantziger at
his Palace Theater tomorrow.

750
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,645
You have to look young.

751
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:20,646
Can I wear a dress?

752
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:21,821
You'd look old in a dress.

753
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:23,953
Besides, you
haven't got one.

754
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,828
Good night,
Uncle Herbie.

755
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:31,396
'Night, June.

756
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:33,311
Good night, Louise.

757
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,748
Good night,
Herbie.

758
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,272
I'll cold-cream their faces
and be right back.

759
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,448
Rose, the hotel
is two doors away.

760
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:43,059
Honestly, you behave as
though those girls-- Rose!

761
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:47,629
We need new silverware.

762
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,718
Herbie...

763
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:52,112
Herbie, how long is it gonna
take you to get used to me?

764
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,593
How long did it take me
to get used to those coats?

765
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,377
What's the matter with them?
They're very stylish!

766
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:58,423
Louise is very handy
with a needle.

767
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,294
As the good Lord says,
"an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth,"

768
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,992
and it serves them right
for overcharging.

769
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:16,266
They can skip the cold
cream for one night.

770
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,272
All this time
we've been together,

771
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:24,057
and you still stand up for me.

772
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,667
Instead of standing
up to you.

773
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:27,669
Well, I wanted to have
dinner, just the two of us,

774
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,236
but what was I gonna
do with the girls?

775
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:30,542
They're just babies.

776
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,326
Rose, no matter
how you dress them,

777
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,241
no matter how you smother
them, they're big girls.

778
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:35,373
They're almost young women.

779
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,548
They're not and they
never will be.

780
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:37,766
I'm embarrassed
in front of them.

781
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,551
When are you gonna
you marry me, Rose?

782
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,683
Don't forget our scrapbooks
to Mr. Grantziger's tomorrow.

783
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:43,642
When are you gonna
quit stalling?

784
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:46,558
Honey, don't you know
there's a depression?

785
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:48,777
Of course I know.
I read "Variety."

786
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,562
Don't you know what
it's doing to vaudeville?

787
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,781
Don't you know what the talkies
are doing to vaudeville?

788
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,783
Don't you know I love you?

789
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:57,960
Do you think I'd
be unfaithful to my
husbands if you didn't?

790
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:00,398
But I have to think of my
girls and their happiness.

791
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:03,836
Louise is very happy being
the front end of a cow.

792
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:06,273
It's better than
being the rear end.

793
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:07,666
Anyway, she loves animals.

794
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,885
She and June should
both be in school.

795
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:13,062
And be like other girls--
cook and clean and sit and die.

796
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:16,805
Honey, could I have
a spoon to stir my tea?

797
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,938
I promised June she'd be
a star and she will be.

798
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:21,201
I promised her I'd get her on
the Pantages circuit and I did.

799
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:23,203
I promised I'd get her on the
Orpheum circuit and I did.

800
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:24,683
I did.

801
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:28,208
And you promised me that
after I did, you'd marry me.

802
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:29,862
I promised her she'd
headline on Broadway.

803
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,254
Didn't you hear what I said?

804
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:34,214
Yes, but I'm ignoring it.

805
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:37,435
Thanks, honey.

806
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,742
It isn't very polite
of a gentleman to remind
a lady that she welched.

807
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,483
There was no date
on that promise.

808
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,834
Rose, stop handing
me that bull!

809
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:50,709
Your stomach.
Oh, Herbie...

810
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:52,711
Why don't you get angry
on the outside instead

811
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:54,234
of letting it settle
in your stomach?

812
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:57,803
I'm afraid.

813
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:00,675
Of me?

814
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,503
Of me.

815
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:05,071
What do you mean?

816
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:07,856
if I ever let loose,
it'll end with me

817
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,032
picking up and walking.

818

that don't know.

1078
00:55:03,517 --> 00:55:05,171
And I'll tell you
something else.

1079
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:06,955
Grantziger's a hick.
He'll get no place!

1080
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:08,392
Rose!

1081
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:09,784
He's trying to take
my baby away from me!

1082
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:11,046
That's what
he's trying to do.

1083
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,092
Well, over my dead body he will.

1084
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:14,398
Rose, come on now.Just a minute!

1085
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:17,052
Just wait one minute.

1086
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:25,800
No!

1087
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:28,063
Mama's just talking big, June.

1088
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:31,110
She won't really--Yes, she will.

1089
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:32,503
Well, Maybe
Mr. Grantziger will--

1090
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:34,853
No, he won't.

1091
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:38,160
Well, that's show business.

1092
00:55:38,204 --> 00:55:40,946
Aren't you happy that someone
like Mr. T .T. Grantziger

1093
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:42,774
thinks that you can be a star?

1094
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:44,819
You're funny.

1095
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:46,778
Why?

1096
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:48,562
Well, you're never jealous.

1097
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:51,783
Oh, well, I don't
have any talent.

1098
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:53,872
I don't mind, really,

1099
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:56,744
except Mama would
like it better if I did.

1100
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:59,443
Guess that's what
she likes about me.

1101
00:55:59,486 --> 00:56:01,270
Mama's no fool.

1102
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:02,881
I'm not a star.

1103
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:05,187
Oh, you are.I'm not!

1104
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:09,583
Mr. Grantziger can make me one.

1105
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:11,977
Mama can make
you a star, too.

1106
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,022
Mama can do one thing:

1107
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:16,242
she can make herself believe
anything she makes up,

1108
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:19,637
like with that rhinestone finale
dress that you sewed for me.

1109
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,161
Mama wants publicity,
so she makes up a story

1110
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:25,425
that three nuns went blind
sewing it.

1111
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,035
And now she believes it.

1112
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:29,777
She even believes
the act is good.

1113
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:32,432
Isn't it?

1114
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:35,000
It's a terrible act
and I hate it.

1115
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:36,480
I've hated it from
the beginning.

1116
00:56:36,523 --> 00:56:38,395
And I hate it even more now.

1117
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:41,093
I hate pretending
like I'm two years old.

1118
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:43,312
I hate singing those
same awful songs,

1119
00:56:43,356 --> 00:56:45,793
doing those same awful dances,

1120
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:48,405
wearing these
same awful costumes.

1121
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:56,674
Well, I didn't mean it
about the costumes.

1122
00:56:56,717 --> 00:57:00,634
No, you just meant that
you're too big for them now.

1123
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:03,071
Did you ever feel like
you didn't have a sister?

1124
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:05,117
Sometimes.

1125
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,597
It's Mama's fault!

1126
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,555
You can't blame
everything on Mama.

1127
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,078
Well, you can't maybe.

1128
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:12,341
I wish she'd marry Herbie
and let me alone.

1129
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:14,561
Herbie doesn't want marry her.

1130
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:17,042
All he cares about is the act.

1131
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:18,696
Oh, honest, Louise.

1132
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,654
Well, he's an agent.

1133
00:57:20,698 --> 00:57:22,482
Your mother isn't
feeling well.

1134
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:27,095
I'll take her back
to the hotel.

1135
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:28,706
Don't worry, June.

1136
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:30,359
I'll get you a good booking.

1137
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:36,496

Why don't you show
it to Madam Rose?

1196
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:53,301
I'm not that good, Herbie.
I'm just fooling around.

1197
01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:55,913
Tulsa, you started fooling
around about three months ago,

1198
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:58,132
right after Mr. Grantziger
canceled our booking.

1199
01:00:58,176 --> 01:00:59,656
Well, I

1200
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:02,049
He's just had more
time, that's all,

1201
01:01:02,093 --> 01:01:03,398
like that two-week
layoff in Albany.

1202
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:04,922
And the layoff in Rochester.

1203
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,924
And the layoff
in Niagara Falls.Sure, Herbie.

1204
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:09,666
I thought you were maybe
worried about the act.

1205
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,755
Oh, no, Herbie.

1206
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,975
because the way things
are picking up,

1207
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:18,544
why, I wouldn't be surprised
if you kids got paid.

1208
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:20,067
Matter of fact,

1209
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:23,549
they're good enough right
now for me to treat you

1210
01:01:23,592 --> 01:01:25,507
to an ice cream soda.

1211
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:27,031
No, thank you.

1212
01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:28,510
Chow mein?

1213
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,730
Mama doesn't like us
to eat before a show.

1214
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:33,994
Louise, there's one
thing your mama knows.

1215
01:01:34,038 --> 01:01:36,954
I wish you did.

1216
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,043
I like her.

1217
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:43,003
Herbie.

1218
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:48,748
Uh... uh...

1219
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,751
Nothing.

1220
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:56,321
Tulsa, if you or the boys
have any problems,

1221
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:57,714
you bring them to me.

1222
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,237
Sure, Herbie.

1223
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:07,985
You didn't tell
him anything, did you?

1224
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:09,900
I mean, that you're
rehearsing
a dance

1225
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,771
How'd you know I was
rehearsing an act?

1226
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:14,078
I saw you practicing on
Monday after the matinee

1227
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:16,907
with a broom for your partner.
I was up in the flies.

1228
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,952
Louise, please, just--Oh, I won't tell
anybody, Tulsa.

1229
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:19,997
I promise.

1230
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,260
I'm very secretive, like you.

1231
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:29,528
That's what this means,
here in your palm.

1232
01:02:29,571 --> 01:02:34,489
And this means that you
make up dreams, like me.

1233
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:38,015
What do you make
up dreams about?

1234
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:40,974
People.

1235
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:43,847
Oh, I do that, too.

1236
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:47,198
You, but yours are about
a partner for your act.

1237
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:50,505
She's gonna be more
than a partner, I hope.

1238
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:54,248
I mean, I dream
that one day...

1239
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,641
Well, you know.

1240
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:59,601
What would she have
to be like, Tulsa?

1241
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:01,647
A wonderful singer
and dancer, I guess.

1242
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,650
No, I'm gonna do
most of that myself.

1243
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:06,695
I don't mean I'm gonna
hog it all, but...

1244
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:08,828
But they always look
at the girl in a dance team,

1245
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:10,090
especially if she's pretty.

1246
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:13,224
Oh, makeup can
help and costumes.

1247
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:14,878
I've got the costumes
all figured out.

1248
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:18,316
I'll sew them for you.Okay!

1249
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:20,405
Hey, thanks!

1250
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:23,190
Well, you see, I pretend

1251

And you say they're old enough
to take care of themselves.

52 weeks,
all year, every year,

1385
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:40,470
I'll work my fingers

01:11:40,513 --> 01:11:43,255
I'll do twice what I did before,
and I was pretty fair.

01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,909
See, I could be
a district manager

1388
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:46,650

in one place.

1389
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:49,043

Don't you want that?

1395
01:12:00,272 --> 01:12:02,709
Yes.

1396
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:04,320
Oh, mama, say yes.

1398
01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:17,420

Honey, it's gonna be fine.

1401
01:12:23,077 --> 01:12:24,992
Everything happens for the best.

1402
01:12:25,036 --> 01:12:26,516
Okay, so the act's finished,

1403
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:27,952
but you and me
and our daughter--

1404
01:12:27,995 --> 01:12:29,214
we're gonna have a home.

1405
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:31,956
Say, we even got a cow
for the backyard.

1406
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:35,176
Why, we are gonna be
the best damn family ever was.

1407
01:12:37,178 --> 01:12:40,704
I'm used to people
walking out.

1408
01:12:40,747 --> 01:12:43,924
When my own mother did it,
I cried for a week.

1409
01:12:43,968 --> 01:12:46,144
Your father did it.

1410
01:12:46,187 --> 01:12:47,406
Then the man I married after him
did it.

1411
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,975
And, well,

1412
01:12:51,018 --> 01:12:53,760
this time I ain't crying.

1413
01:12:53,804 --> 01:12:56,372
This time I'm apologizing

1414
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:58,939
to you.

1415
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:01,159
I pushed you aside for her.

1416
01:13:01,202 --> 01:13:02,421
I made everything
just for her.

1417
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:03,944
No, Mama.

1418
01:13:03,988 --> 01:13:05,642
Now she says I can't make her
an actress

1419
01:13:05,685 --> 01:13:08,340
like she wants to be.

1420
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,908
The boys walked because
they think the act is finished.

1421
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:13,171
They think we're nothing
without her.

1422
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:15,478
She's nothing without me.

1423
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:17,654
I'm her mother,
and I made her.

1424
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:19,220
And I can make you now.

1425
01:13:19,264 --> 01:13:20,700
I'm gonna make it up to you

1426
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:22,398
for all the years
I pushed you in the back.

1427
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:24,661
And I will, my baby,

That's a good girl.
Now go to bed, Agnes.

1634
01:23:11,769 --> 01:23:14,772
Now that I'm an actress,
it's Amanda.

1635
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:16,861
Whatever it is, go to bed.

1636
01:23:16,904 --> 01:23:18,776
Can I ask Herbie
a question first?

1637
01:23:18,819 --> 01:23:20,038
Sure.

1638
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:23,128
Herbie, do you think
we'll ever work again?

1639
01:23:23,172 --> 01:23:26,044
Of course we will.I'll get us a booking, Amanda.

1640
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:27,828
Thank you, Herbert.

1641
01:23:29,091 --> 01:23:31,919
Louise, your hair.

1642
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:33,878
It's yours if you want it.

1643
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:37,186
Gee, I always wanted to be
a blonde.

1644
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:39,057
Then get some peroxide
and a toothbrush.

1645
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:41,016
Wigs are expensive.

1646
01:23:41,059 --> 01:23:43,627
Say, we could get a good refund
on this,

1647
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:44,889
if we ever pay for it.

1648
01:23:44,932 --> 01:23:46,630
How about getting
a gallon of peroxide

1649
01:23:46,673 --> 01:23:48,023
and a carton of toothbrushes?

1650
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:50,373
What for?Make them all blondes.

1651
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:51,983
I was only joking, Herbie.

1652
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,421
So was I, honey.Yes, but why not do it?

1653
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:56,727
They're children, Louise.

1654
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,598
They're young girls, mama.

1655
01:23:58,642 --> 01:24:00,513
And with blonde hair, they could
be pretty young girls.

1656
01:24:00,557 --> 01:24:03,342
It'd sure jazz up the act
and make it easier to sell.

1657
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:06,693
We could call it "Madam Rose
and Her Blonde Babies ."

1658
01:24:06,737 --> 01:24:08,652
"Baby Blondes."Nothing with babies.

1659

Yes.

All blondes except you,
because you're the star.

1661

If I'm the star,

1662
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:16,660

He went out front
to check the billing.

1721
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,404
Good morning.

1722
01:27:17,884 --> 01:27:20,060
Oh, no, no, no.

1723
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:33,160
Oh, it ain't weighted right,
damn it.

1724
01:27:33,204 --> 01:27:34,423
It scratches the hell out of me

1725
01:27:34,466 --> 01:27:36,033
and it just don't bump
when I do.

1726
01:27:36,076 --> 01:27:39,036
Maybe there's something wrong
with your bumper.

1727

Big joke.

1728
01:27:41,778 --> 01:27:44,259
I'm out there bumping
my brains off with no action,

1729
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:45,738
and she's being witty.

1730
01:27:45,782 --> 01:27:48,567
Hey, you with the neck.

1731
01:27:48,611 --> 01:27:50,656

Get the cow.

1736
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:09,022
Now, mama--

1737
01:28:09,066 --> 01:28:10,589
You don't know what kind
of people these are.

1738
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:11,895
You don't know
what kind of a theater this is.

1739
01:28:11,938 --> 01:28:13,462
Yes, I do. It's a house
of burlesque.

1740
01:28:13,505 --> 01:28:14,767
A house of burlesque.
Do you know what that is?

1741
01:28:14,811 --> 01:28:16,465
Filth, that's what.

1742
01:28:16,508 --> 01:28:17,901
I tell you when your friend
Herbie shows his face--

1743
01:28:17,944 --> 01:28:19,555
Mama, I'm sure
Herbie didn't know.

1744
01:28:19,598 --> 01:28:21,078
Not much, he didn't.
Agnes!

1745
01:28:21,121 --> 01:28:23,298
He did the booking
over the telephone.
Agnes!

1746
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:25,909
Mama, we were all so happy.Agnes, damn it.

1747
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:28,694
Madam Rose, you know
my name isn't Agnes anymore.

1748
01:28:28,738 --> 01:28:31,175
...Agnes, I want you
and the rest of those girls

1749
01:28:31,218 --> 01:28:32,916
out of this hellhole
in two seconds flat.

1750
01:28:32,959 --> 01:28:35,092
But, Madam Rose--March!

1751
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:36,702
Yes, ma'am.

1752
01:28:36,746 --> 01:28:38,356
Wait in the other room.

1753
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,011
I'll take the front end
of the cow, you take the rear.

1754
01:28:41,054 --> 01:28:42,360
And what bags we can't carry,
your friend Herbie can

1755
01:28:42,404 --> 01:28:44,406
damn well pick up
and carry by himself.

1756
01:28:47,409 --> 01:28:49,106
Now you listen to me, Louise.

1757
01:28:49,149 --> 01:28:50,499
Just because you think
your friend Herbie--

1758
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:51,717
This has nothing
to do with Herbie.

1759
01:28:51,761 --> 01:28:52,718
You don't know
what burlesque is.

1760
01:28:52,762 --> 01:28:55,330
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.

1761
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,636
No daughter of mine is ever
working in burlesque,

1762
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:58,942
and no daughter
of any woman I know.

1763
01:28:58,985 --> 01:29:00,639
Then, Mama, where are we
going to work?

1764
01:29:00,683 --> 01:29:02,511
I'd rather starve.

1765
01:29:02,554 --> 01:29:04,948
Mama, how much money
do we have?

1766
01:29:04,991 --> 01:29:06,428
Including what's left
of their allowances,

1767
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:08,125
how much do we have?

1768
01:29:08,168 --> 01:29:10,214
Something will turn up.Well, something has turned up,

1769
01:29:10,257 --> 01:29:12,042
and this is it.

1770
01:29:12,085 --> 01:29:14,436
Mama, we're flat broke.

1771
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:16,089
We've got to take this job.

1772
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:17,656
Even if you wanted to quit
and go home right now,

1773
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,310
we'd have to take this job.

1774
01:29:28,145 --> 01:29:29,364
I had a dream.

1775
01:29:29,407 --> 01:29:30,408
Mama.

1776
01:29:31,931 --> 01:29:34,151
Oh, you'll like this one.

1777
01:29:34,194 --> 01:29:37,328
I had it over a week ago,
only I didn't want to tell.

1778
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,156
I was home in Seattle

1779
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,680
and the cow came into my room.

1780
01:29:41,724 --> 01:29:43,552
Only this time she wasn't
dancing and smiling.

1781
01:29:43,595 --> 01:29:46,729
She was wheezing and sadlike.

1782
01:29:46,772 --> 01:29:48,252
She came right over to my bed,
looked at me, and said,

1783
01:29:48,295 --> 01:29:51,211
"Rose, move over."

1784
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:54,301
I'm sorry, Mama.

1785
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,782
Why?

1786
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:58,480
She didn't ask you
to move over.

1787
01:29:58,523 --> 01:30:01,308
No, I mean I'm sorry I'm not
good enough

1788
01:30:01,352 --> 01:30:03,572
in the act.

1789
01:30:03,615 --> 01:30:06,575
Oh, it's the act
that ain't good enough, baby.

1790
01:30:06,618 --> 01:30:09,665
Rose?In here, Herbie.

1791
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:12,276
Rose, I didn't know,
believe me.

1792
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:14,583
I do, honey.

1793
01:30:16,193 --> 01:30:17,412
What the hell?

1794
01:30:17,455 --> 01:30:19,022
It's only two weeks.
The money is good.

1795
01:30:19,065 --> 01:30:20,589
Maybe by that time
something will turn up, right?

1796
01:30:20,632 --> 01:30:22,199
Right.You're a nice girl, Rose.

1797
01:30:22,242 --> 01:30:23,592
Thank you.That's show business.

1798
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:25,202
One good thing-- I bet
we got top billing.

1799
01:30:25,245 --> 01:30:26,290
No. We're featured, though.

1800
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:27,596
Second?

1801
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:29,598
Actually they had us
lost in the middle.

1802
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:31,600
I thought last was better,
and so it says,

1803
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:33,602
"and Rose-Louise and
Her Hollywood Blondes."

1804
01:30:33,645 --> 01:30:35,125
and I'm making them
put a box around it.

1805
01:30:35,168 --> 01:30:36,605
They'll use a lot of pictures.

1806
01:30:36,648 --> 01:30:38,824
Forget the box, Herbie.
Forget the pictures.

1807
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:41,610
But, Mama, if--You don't know what they say
in the business,

1808
01:30:41,653 --> 01:30:43,699
but Herbie does.

1809
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:47,050
They say once a Vaudeville act
plays in burlesque,

1810
01:30:47,093 --> 01:30:50,836
that means it's all washed up.

1811
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,447
Nothing's gonna turn up for us,
is it, Herbie?

1812
01:30:53,665 --> 01:30:54,753
No.

1813
01:30:58,278 --> 01:30:59,932
I guess it is
a pretty rotten act.

1814
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:01,456
It ain't the act, honey.

1815
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:03,458
I've been telling you,
Vaudeville's dead,

1816
01:31:03,501 --> 01:31:04,633
stone-cold dead.

1817
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:10,465
Well, we sure as hell tried.We sure as hell did.

1818
01:31:10,508 --> 01:31:11,857
Nobody can say we didn't last
right up to the very end.

1819
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:12,858
Sure as hell can't.Right?

1820
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:14,120
Right.

1821
01:31:14,164 --> 01:31:18,255
Well, I'd better get
the cues ready.

1822
01:31:18,298 --> 01:31:19,735
Herbie...

1823
01:31:22,302 --> 01:31:23,956
...how about marrying me?

1824
01:31:28,613 --> 01:31:29,658
Sure.

1825
01:31:32,138 --> 01:31:33,531
I love you, you know.

1826
01:31:33,575 --> 01:31:34,532
I know.

1827
01:31:34,576 --> 01:31:35,881
Do it today.

1828
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:37,883
Not while we're in burlesque.

1829
01:31:37,927 --> 01:31:39,406
The day we close.

1830
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:42,584
It's a deal.

1831
01:31:42,627 --> 01:31:45,369
Oh, Herbie.
I do, honey, I do.

1832
01:31:45,412 --> 01:31:47,589
So do I, Rose.Hey, Rose-Louise,

1833
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:48,851
where the hell is your music
and light cues?

1834
01:31:48,894 --> 01:31:50,983
Be right with you.You Rose

1835
01:31:51,027 --> 01:31:52,681
Yeah, I'm Rose-Louise.Things are looking up.

1836
01:31:52,724 --> 01:31:55,684
Well, I got a show to open,
Rose-Louise, so move your ass.

1837
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:57,294
Listen, you little punk,
for the next two weeks

1838
01:31:57,337 --> 01:31:59,122
you're gonna speak like
a Sunday school teacher.

1839
01:31:59,165 --> 01:32:00,253
You got something
in this theater

1840
01:32:00,297 --> 01:32:02,299
you've never seen before--
a lady.

1841
01:32:02,342 --> 01:32:03,996
Look at her.
That is a lady.

1842
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,302
That is also a lady.

1843
01:32:05,345 --> 01:32:06,608
Every girl in this damn act

1844
01:32:06,651 --> 01:32:08,697
is a lady, you understand?Yes, sir.

1845
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:11,134
Now go onstage and I'll give you
those cues when I'm ready.

1846
01:32:11,177 --> 01:32:13,353
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, ma'am.

1847
01:32:32,764 --> 01:32:34,549
Oh, sir.

1848
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:36,899
Won't you give me
your protection?

1849
01:32:36,942 --> 01:32:38,727
I'm a lady, too.

1850
01:32:39,771 --> 01:32:41,773
Hey, the damn thing worked!

1851
01:32:47,866 --> 01:32:51,087
Well, if you ladies
will excuse me...

1852
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:52,305
We're very busy.

1853
01:32:52,349 --> 01:32:54,569
In my dressing room.

1854
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:55,961
In your dress--
Mama.

1855
01:32:56,005 --> 01:32:57,746
You're damn right it is.

1856
01:32:57,789 --> 01:33:00,096
And I don't like sharing it
any more than you do,

1857
01:33:00,139 --> 01:33:03,578
particularly with a troupe
of professional virgins.

1858
01:33:04,796 --> 01:33:06,624
We are not--
All right.

1859
01:33:06,668 --> 01:33:08,757
So you're acrobats.

1860
01:33:11,673 --> 01:33:13,762
We happen to be headliners
from the Orpheum circuit.

1861
01:33:13,805 --> 01:33:15,894
We were booked into this theater
by mistake.

1862
01:33:15,938 --> 01:33:18,201
Weren't we all?

1863
01:33:18,244 --> 01:33:21,030
Say, who made that?
I did.

1864
01:33:21,073 --> 01:33:23,293
I make all our costumes.

1865
01:33:23,336 --> 01:33:26,992
Will you look at them ladylike
little stitches?

1866
01:33:27,036 --> 01:33:28,864
That miserable broad
who's been making my gowns

1867
01:33:28,907 --> 01:33:29,995
must be using a fishhook.

1868
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:31,388
What do you pay her?

1869
01:33:31,431 --> 01:33:33,782
25 bucks a gown
and I provide the material.

1870
01:33:33,825 --> 01:33:35,784
30.But she's new in the business.

1871
01:33:35,827 --> 01:33:37,568
30.
Who are you?
Her mother?

1872
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,222
Yes.
30.

1873
01:33:39,265 --> 01:33:41,224
I'll get the material
after the matinee.

1874
01:33:41,267 --> 01:33:42,529
It's a deal.

1875
01:33:44,444 --> 01:33:48,013
Where's your toreador costume?The girls must have it in--

1876
01:33:48,057 --> 01:33:53,018
God knows what else they've got
in that dressing room with them.

1877
01:33:53,062 --> 01:33:54,063
You know,

1878
01:33:54,106 --> 01:33:56,239
from the way that dame walks,

1879
01:33:56,282 --> 01:33:58,850
she would have made a damn good
stripper in her day.

1880
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:03,899
Hey, Tessie, I'm short
a talking woman.

1881
01:34:03,942 --> 01:34:05,422
Tough titty.

1882
01:34:05,465 --> 01:34:07,642
Tessie, the new comic
won't use a chorus girl.

1883
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:10,427
Let him use Mazeppa.
Everyone else has.

1884
01:34:11,863 --> 01:34:13,648
Now, you know Mazeppa's got
a gladiator ballet

1885
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:15,258
just before his spot.

1886
01:34:15,301 --> 01:34:17,434
Then cut the ballet.
It stinks anyway.

1887
01:34:17,477 --> 01:34:19,436
Oh, be a sport.
I'm in a bind.

1888
01:34:19,479 --> 01:34:22,091
You're always in a bind
in this flee-bitten trap.

1889
01:34:22,134 --> 01:34:24,136
I'm a strip woman, slob.

1890
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,878
I don't do no scenes.
Now screw.

1891
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,144
Have you ever heard of
a first-class strip woman

1892
01:34:32,188 --> 01:34:33,493
playing scenes?

1893
01:34:33,537 --> 01:34:35,539
Well, you play stock
in a dump like this,

1894
01:34:35,582 --> 01:34:37,106
you gotta expect to be insulted.

1895
01:34:37,149 --> 01:34:38,890
The work's steady,
ain't it?

1896
01:34:38,934 --> 01:34:41,110
Yeah, but you bring in a new
star for each show, don't you?

1897
01:34:41,153 --> 01:34:43,199
Tessie, it's just a few lines.

1898
01:34:43,242 --> 01:34:44,461
Fat boy,

1899
01:34:44,504 --> 01:34:45,941
save your bad breath.

1900
01:34:47,203 --> 01:34:49,335
I'll give you
10 bucks extra.
Nah.

1901
01:34:49,379 --> 01:34:50,467
Excuse me.

1902
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:52,904
I can read lines.And who are you?

1903
01:34:52,948 --> 01:34:55,472
Rose-Louise of Rose-Louise
and Her Hollywood Blondes.

1904
01:34:55,515 --> 01:34:57,692
Wait a minute.

1905
01:34:57,735 --> 01:34:58,780
What kind of lines?

1906
01:34:58,823 --> 01:34:59,868
You in her act?

1907
01:34:59,911 --> 01:35:01,304
Not exactly.

1908
01:35:01,347 --> 01:35:03,306
Shut up.
How are your legs?

1909
01:35:03,349 --> 01:35:06,309
Great, and I'll learn her
the scenes.

1910
01:35:06,352 --> 01:35:08,920
Okay, 10 bucks.

1911
01:35:11,227 --> 01:35:13,490
It's money, Mama.

1912
01:35:13,533 --> 01:35:15,361
What's she going to be saying
out there on that stage?

1913
01:35:15,405 --> 01:35:18,495
The same burlesque crap that's
been said since the year one.

1914
01:35:18,538 --> 01:35:20,105
Say, where have you been
all your life?

1915
01:35:20,149 --> 01:35:21,150
Playing Vaudeville.

1916
01:35:21,193 --> 01:35:22,586
Where

1917
01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:25,241
You name a big city
and we've played it.

1918
01:35:25,284 --> 01:35:28,548
My grandfather says
we've covered the country
like gypsies.

1919
01:35:28,592 --> 01:35:31,508
Well, you may be a gypsy,
Rose-Louise--

1920
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:34,250
Say, that ain't a bad name
if you ever take up stripping.

1921
01:35:34,293 --> 01:35:35,773
She won't.

1922
01:35:35,817 --> 01:35:38,341
No, but you let her feed lines
to a bum comic

1923
01:35:38,384 --> 01:35:39,951
for a lousy 10 bucks.

1924
01:35:39,995 --> 01:35:41,344
That's training.

1925
01:35:41,387 --> 01:35:42,911
She's going to be an actress.

1926
01:35:42,954 --> 01:35:44,434
This is only temporary.

1927
01:35:44,477 --> 01:35:45,740
As soon as she finishes here,

1928
01:35:45,783 --> 01:35:47,176
she goes right back
to Vaudeville.

1929
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:52,355
Back to Vaudeville, my eye.

1930
01:35:52,398 --> 01:35:54,444
There ain't any Vaudeville left
except burlesque.

1931
01:35:54,487 --> 01:35:56,663
We know.

1932
01:35:56,707 --> 01:35:58,927
You know?

1933
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:00,189
You better wise her up.

1934
01:36:00,232 --> 01:36:02,757
She's wise.

1935
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,759
She's a damn sight wiser
than any of you.

1936
01:36:04,802 --> 01:36:06,543
Like mother, like daughter.

1937
01:36:06,586 --> 01:36:08,719
Okay.

1938
01:36:13,419 --> 01:36:15,421
It's okay, baby.

1939
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,951
Say,

1940
01:36:22,994 --> 01:36:25,388
whose feelings did I hurt?

1941
01:36:25,431 --> 01:36:27,129
Yours or hers?

1942
01:36:28,608 --> 01:36:29,827
Neither.

1943
01:36:29,871 --> 01:36:31,263
We'll both be fine.

1944
01:36:31,307 --> 01:36:33,875
That's good, because sharing
a dressing room

1945
01:36:33,918 --> 01:36:35,398
is like sleeping together.

1946
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:36,878
If you don't get along with
one another--

1947
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:38,923
Miss Tura!

1948
01:36:42,622 --> 01:36:44,624
Miss Tura.

1949
01:36:47,889 --> 01:36:51,718
I will thank you not to give
the boss any notion

1950
01:36:51,762 --> 01:36:55,070
that I would ever play scenes.

1951
01:36:55,113 --> 01:36:59,552
One more disparaging remark
about my ballet

1952
01:36:59,596 --> 01:37:01,903
will find this bugle
right up your--

1953
01:37:01,946 --> 01:37:03,426
Please.

1954
01:37:03,469 --> 01:37:05,428
There is a lady present.

1955
01:37:06,733 --> 01:37:08,039
Where?

1956
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:10,041
Open your eyes
instead of your mouth.

1957
01:37:10,085 --> 01:37:12,435
Gypsy,

1958
01:37:12,478 --> 01:37:16,656
meet Miss Mazeppa
and Miss Electra.

1959
01:37:18,049 --> 01:37:21,009
Say, you're even younger
than I was

1960
01:37:21,052 --> 01:37:23,750
when I began stripping.

1961
01:37:23,794 --> 01:37:26,666
Oh, I'm not going to strip.

1962
01:37:28,668 --> 01:37:30,801
Something wrong
with stripping?

1963
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:33,630
No, I just meant that
I don't have any talent.

1964
01:37:33,673 --> 01:37:36,459
You think they have?

1965
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:39,941
I myself, of course,
was a ballerina.

1966
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:42,639
But take it from me,
to be a stripper,

1967
01:37:42,682 --> 01:37:45,033
all you need to have
is no talent.

1968
01:37:45,076 --> 01:37:46,861
You'll pardon me,

1969
01:37:46,904 --> 01:37:50,603
but to have no talent
is not enough.

1970
01:37:50,647 --> 01:37:53,868
What you need to have
is an idea

1971
01:37:53,911 --> 01:37:56,479

you pinhead.Hey, you seen Amanda?

2047
01:42:56,996 --> 01:42:58,215
She must be packing.

2048
01:42:58,259 --> 01:42:59,477
Ain't your act through today?

2049
01:42:59,521 --> 01:43:02,306
You bet it is--
through, finished, over.

2050
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:04,221
Hey, I've been hunting

Here.

01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,181
Oh, Herbie.

2053
01:43:07,224 --> 01:43:08,704
It's like for a funeral.

2054
01:43:08,747 --> 01:43:10,358
It's for the wedding.

2055
01:43:10,401 --> 01:43:13,665

bridesmaid, Amanda.

You'll be happier
as Agnes, Amanda.

2058
01:43:17,408 --> 01:43:19,497
Oh, you're leaving?

2059
01:43:19,541 --> 01:43:23,066
Yeah, I have to go home
and let my hair grow out.

2060
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:25,111
Oh, you poor kid.

2061
01:43:25,155 --> 01:43:26,112

2062
01:43:26,156 --> 01:43:27,462

I'm coming, you creep.

2069
01:43:42,128 --> 01:43:45,393
And now, Miss Tessie Tura.

2070
01:43:54,358 --> 01:43:55,707
Why aren't you nervous?

2071
01:43:55,751 --> 01:43:58,188
I've never been so nervous
in my whole life.

2072
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,190
You've never been
married before.

2073
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:01,365
Well, your mother's never been
married before

2074
01:44:01,409 --> 01:44:02,671
like she's gonna be this time--

2075
01:44:02,714 --> 01:44:04,194
for keeps and forever, to me.

2076
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,327
Honey, ain't you
a little bit nervous?
Sure.

2077
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,851
I don't know why the hell
I stay in this business.

2078
01:44:08,894 --> 01:44:10,287
If it ain't one damn headache,
it's another.

2079
01:44:10,331 --> 01:44:12,376
Shh, they can hear you
out front.

2080
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,770
It's my theater,
ain't it?
Let 'em.

2081
01:44:14,813 --> 01:44:16,859
Last show, no talking woman.

2082
01:44:16,902 --> 01:44:18,948
The show before that--
no second banana.

2083
01:44:18,991 --> 01:44:20,384
If that crazy broad wasn't here,

2084
01:44:20,428 --> 01:44:22,125
why did you start
the performance?

2085
01:44:22,168 --> 01:44:23,953
She don't go on
till next to closing.

2086
01:44:23,996 --> 01:44:26,521
She said she was only going
next door to the drugstore.

2087
01:44:26,564 --> 01:44:28,174
What was she arrested for?
Shoplifting?

2088
01:44:28,218 --> 01:44:29,654
No, soliciting.

2089
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:32,744
She always was greedy.
Cut the spot.

2090
01:44:32,788 --> 01:44:34,137
Do you think we ought to
invite the minister out

2091
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,269
for a drink after?

2092
01:44:35,312 --> 01:44:36,270
It's the star strip.

2093
01:44:36,313 --> 01:44:37,532
Cut it.

2094
01:44:37,575 --> 01:44:39,011
They'll yell murder
if it's the same act

2095
01:44:39,055 --> 01:44:40,535
they've been seeing
for the past eight weeks.

2096
01:44:40,578 --> 01:44:41,666
The star's the novelty.

2097
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:42,798
And what do you want
I should do?

2098
01:44:42,841 --> 01:44:44,930
Let you strip?

2099
01:44:47,498 --> 01:44:48,978
My daughter can do it.

2100
01:44:49,021 --> 01:44:51,328
Rose-Louise.
Since when?

2101
01:44:51,372 --> 01:44:53,809
Ever since she's been here to
see how little there is to it.

2102
01:44:53,852 --> 01:44:55,985
She didn't look bad
in them scenes.

2103
01:44:56,028 --> 01:44:57,508
She'll look great
in her own gowns.

2104
01:44:57,552 --> 01:44:58,509
What's the gimmick?

2105
01:44:58,553 --> 01:45:00,076
She's young.

2106
01:45:00,119 --> 01:45:02,121
And you got any better ideas?

2107
01:45:02,165 --> 01:45:04,385
Well, she'd better get ready
right damn quick.

2108
01:45:04,428 --> 01:45:06,474
It's the star spot.

2109
01:45:06,517 --> 01:45:07,823
You're telling me?

2110
01:45:07,866 --> 01:45:09,955
That means the star salary.

2111
01:45:09,999 --> 01:45:10,956
If we keep her.

2112
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,480
You will.

2113
01:45:12,523 --> 01:45:13,959
She's gonna be wonderful.

2114
01:45:18,137 --> 01:45:19,791
I knew something would turn up.

2115
01:45:19,835 --> 01:45:21,184
Where's that dress
you were gonna make for Tessie?

2116
01:45:21,227 --> 01:45:23,099
It will work perfect for you.

2117
01:45:23,142 --> 01:45:24,579
Well, come on,
get your makeup on.

2118
01:45:24,622 --> 01:45:25,841
There ain't much time.

2119
01:45:25,884 --> 01:45:27,321
Oh, silly,

2120
01:45:27,364 --> 01:45:29,105
you ain't really gonna strip.

2121
01:45:29,148 --> 01:45:31,673
All you'll do is walk around
the stage in time to the music

2122
01:45:31,716 --> 01:45:33,501
and drop a shoulder strap
at the end.

2123
01:45:33,544 --> 01:45:36,721
You're a lady,
like Herbie says you are.

2124
01:45:36,765 --> 01:45:38,462
You'll just parade so grand,

2125
01:45:38,506 --> 01:45:39,855
they'll think
you're doing them a big favor

2126
01:45:39,898 --> 01:45:41,944
if you even show them your knee.

2127
01:45:41,987 --> 01:45:45,034
Louise, it's the star spot.

2128
01:45:45,077 --> 01:45:47,253
I always promised my daughter
we'd be a star.

2129
01:45:54,565 --> 01:45:56,524
Baby,

2130
01:45:56,567 --> 01:45:59,396
it's all right to walk out
when they want you,

2131
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,180
but you can't walk out now

2132
01:46:01,224 --> 01:46:04,401
when after all these rotten
years we're still a flop.

2133
01:46:04,445 --> 01:46:05,794
That's quitting.

2134
01:46:05,837 --> 01:46:08,840
We can't quit
because we're a flop.

2135
01:46:08,884 --> 01:46:11,539
Louise, don't be like June.

2136
01:46:11,582 --> 01:46:13,541
Just do this so we can--

2137
01:46:13,584 --> 01:46:16,413
we walk away proud
because we made it--

2138
01:46:16,457 --> 01:46:18,067
maybe only in burlesque,

2139
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:20,417
maybe only a second-rate
burlesque at that--

2140
01:46:20,461 --> 01:46:23,551
but let's walk away...

2141
01:46:23,594 --> 01:46:25,248
a star.

2142
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,215
There ain't enough time
to finish the dress,

2143
01:46:36,259 --> 01:46:37,695
but we can pin it.

2144
01:46:37,739 --> 01:46:40,655
Hey, here's some material
for extra panels.

2145
01:46:40,698 --> 01:46:42,874
Didn't I tell you
you were born lucky?

2146
01:46:42,918 --> 01:46:44,876
You can unpin them and drop them
every once in a while

2147
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:47,139
so they think
you're taking something off.

2148
01:46:47,183 --> 01:46:51,361
Not too much makeup, baby--
young and girlish, pure.

2149
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:54,582
Don't smear that junk all over
your face like they do.

2150
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:56,714
You keep your mouth
the way the lord made it.

2151
01:46:56,758 --> 01:46:58,977
No rouge, no beauty marks.

2152
01:46:59,021 --> 01:47:00,457
You be a lady--

2153
01:47:00,501 --> 01:47:02,677
grand, elegant,

2154
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:05,462
with a classy,
ladylike walk.

2155
01:47:05,506 --> 01:47:07,029
Shoes.

2156
01:47:07,072 --> 01:47:09,205
Oh, my god, shoes.

2157
01:47:09,248 --> 01:47:11,555
Well, you could wear these--

2158
01:47:11,599 --> 01:47:14,384
these old silver ones
I borrowed from Tessie.

2159
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,038
They'll do for this performance.

2160
01:47:16,081 --> 01:47:18,823
Come on, get into them.

2161
01:47:18,867 --> 01:47:21,304
Oh, no, your hair's all wrong.

2162
01:47:21,347 --> 01:47:22,958
You can't let it just hang there
like spaghetti.

2163
01:47:23,001 --> 01:47:24,612
Put it up.

2164
01:47:24,655 --> 01:47:25,613
It's got to have class.

2165
01:47:25,656 --> 01:47:27,049
Fluff it up
in the front.

2166
01:47:27,092 --> 01:47:28,920
Thank God the Lord gave us
good color

2167
01:47:28,964 --> 01:47:30,618
and that you
washed it this morning.

2168
01:47:30,661 --> 01:47:34,709
Say, maybe we should put in
a couple of feathers, huh?

2169
01:47:34,752 --> 01:47:36,232
No, that's what they all do.

2170
01:47:36,275 --> 01:47:38,626
Jewelry, jewelry.

2171
01:47:38,669 --> 01:47:40,149
No, let Tessie and the others

2172
01:47:40,192 --> 01:47:41,542
wear all the vulgar junk
they want.

2173
01:47:41,585 --> 01:47:43,979
She almost ready?
She goes on in five minutes.

2174
01:47:44,022 --> 01:47:47,069
She'll be there.
She'll be there.

2175
01:47:47,112 --> 01:47:49,114
Come on.
Get into the dress.

2176
01:47:54,293 --> 01:47:56,513
What are these?

2177
01:47:56,557 --> 01:47:58,080
Oh.

2178
01:47:58,123 --> 01:48:00,343
My wedding present
from Tessie.

2179
01:48:00,386 --> 01:48:03,041
Good for a lady.
Yeah, wear them.

2180
01:48:03,085 --> 01:48:04,390
Let's see, what else?

2181
01:48:04,434 --> 01:48:05,609
Music!

2182
01:48:05,653 --> 01:48:10,179
Hmm, Spanish, cow,
military-- no.

2183
01:48:10,222 --> 01:48:11,833
Say--

2184
01:48:11,876 --> 01:48:14,488
Say, you can do June's
"Let Me Entertain You" number.

2185
01:48:14,531 --> 01:48:16,664
I'll mark it for the conductor
to repeat two choruses slow--

2186
01:48:16,707 --> 01:48:17,969
No, 2 1/2 choruses.

2187
01:48:18,013 --> 01:48:19,493
And sing out, Louise.

2188
01:48:19,536 --> 01:48:21,669
You just walk and dip.
My girl's a lady.

2189
01:48:21,712 --> 01:48:24,846
Make them beg for more
and then don't give it to 'em.

2190
01:48:26,978 --> 01:48:28,980
Let's see, anything else?

2191
01:48:35,726 --> 01:48:38,947
Where you been?
Out front?

2192
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:41,950
No, I got sick to my stomach
and threw up.

2193
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,779
But you feel better now?

2194
01:48:44,822 --> 01:48:46,563
No.

2195
01:48:46,607 --> 01:48:48,391
Herbie, I had to.

2196
01:48:51,176 --> 01:48:53,222
That's why I'm leaving.

2197
01:48:55,746 --> 01:48:57,922
I apologize.

2198
01:48:57,966 --> 01:48:59,141
No, let me,

2199
01:48:59,184 --> 01:49:01,099
for my resemblance
to a mouse--

2200
01:49:01,143 --> 01:49:03,101
no, to a worm, the way
I've crawled after you.

2201
01:49:03,145 --> 01:49:04,929
No more, Rose.
I won't.

2202
01:49:04,973 --> 01:49:06,452
I was even going to
crawl away from you

2203
01:49:06,496 --> 01:49:08,411
because my stomach
started to turn over at the idea

2204
01:49:08,454 --> 01:49:11,457
of coming back and telling you
we're finished.

2205
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:13,895
Tell me tomorrow after
we're married.

2206
01:49:13,938 --> 01:49:15,374
We're never getting married.

2207
01:49:15,418 --> 01:49:16,898
Sure, we are, first thing
in the morning.

2208
01:49:16,941 --> 01:49:20,031
Never! Not if you got down
on your knees and begged.

2209
01:49:20,075 --> 01:49:21,293
Oh, I still love you,

2210
01:49:21,337 --> 01:49:23,034
but all the vows
from here to doomsday--

2211
01:49:23,078 --> 01:49:24,340
they couldn't make you a wife.

2212
01:49:24,383 --> 01:49:25,559
I want a wife.

2213
01:49:25,602 --> 01:49:27,082
I'm gonna be a man
if it kills me.

2214
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:29,345
So you're killing me.

2215
01:49:29,388 --> 01:49:31,434
Nobody can kill you.

2216
01:49:31,477 --> 01:49:33,349
You're jealous,

2217
01:49:33,392 --> 01:49:35,830
just like every man
I've ever known,

2218
01:49:35,873 --> 01:49:38,267
jealous because
my girls come first.

2219
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:39,747
Well, they always did
and they always will.

2220
01:49:39,790 --> 01:49:42,358
Then why did June leave?I don't wanna hear her name.

2221
01:49:42,401 --> 01:49:44,969
She didn't want the act
any more than Louise wants this.

2222
01:49:45,013 --> 01:49:46,101
Louise does.

2223
01:49:46,144 --> 01:49:48,103
She'll leave like June did.

2224
01:49:48,146 --> 01:49:49,365
Never.

2225
01:49:49,408 --> 01:49:50,758
She's gonna be a star.

2226
01:49:50,801 --> 01:49:54,109
She's gonna be a star
if it kills you and her.

2227
01:49:54,152 --> 01:49:56,372
She's gonna be a star someplace.

2228
01:49:56,415 --> 01:49:58,635
Where are you gonna be
when she gets married?

2229
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:00,463
She won't be getting married
for years.

2230
01:50:00,506 --> 01:50:02,291
She's a baby.

2231
01:50:02,334 --> 01:50:03,814
Sure.

2232
01:50:03,858 --> 01:50:06,121
Anyway, her career
will always come first.

2233
01:50:06,164 --> 01:50:07,731
That's right.

2234
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:13,824
That is right.

2235
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,792
Herbie...

2236
01:50:24,835 --> 01:50:26,837
why does everybody walk out?

2237
01:50:30,711 --> 01:50:35,629
Maybe Louise won't.

2238
01:50:35,672 --> 01:50:38,022
Don't leave, Herbie.

2239
01:50:38,066 --> 01:50:41,025
I need you.

2240
01:50:41,069 --> 01:50:43,419
What for?

2241
01:50:43,462 --> 01:50:44,855
A million things.

2242
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:51,470
Just one would be better.

2243
01:50:57,476 --> 01:50:59,261
Goodbye, honey.

2244
01:50:59,304 --> 01:51:00,871
Be a good girl.

2245
01:51:08,487 --> 01:51:10,751
You go to hell.

2246
01:51:10,794 --> 01:51:12,840
Come on, get her music
to the conductor.

2247
01:51:12,883 --> 01:51:15,016
And you'd better
stand by me for the light cues.

2248
01:51:15,059 --> 01:51:16,844

Any particular color
you have in mind?

Mother, I've already started
making the gown.

2463
02:05:40,141 --> 02:05:41,751

that's one reason

2485
02:06:22,444 --> 02:06:24,272
why you don't
want me backstage--

2486
02:06:24,315 --> 02:06:26,100
so I won't hear
them laugh.

2487
02:06:26,143 --> 02:06:27,928
Well, that's them you ought
to keep out, not me,

2488
02:06:27,971 --> 02:06:29,364
because they're
laughing at you, too,

2489
02:06:29,407 --> 02:06:33,020
you, the burlesque queen
who speaks lousy French

2490
02:06:33,063 --> 02:06:34,717
and reads book reviews
like they was books.

2491
02:06:34,761 --> 02:06:36,806
Turn it off, Mother.You know what you are
to them?

2492
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:39,374
A circus freak,
this year's novelty act.

2493
02:06:39,417 --> 02:06:40,462
And when the bill
is changed--

2494
02:06:40,505 --> 02:06:42,986
I said turn it off.

2495
02:06:43,030 --> 02:06:47,600
Nobody laughs at me,
because I laugh first...

2496
02:06:47,643 --> 02:06:50,167
at me--

2497
02:06:50,211 --> 02:06:53,649
me from Seattle,

2498
02:06:53,693 --> 02:06:55,695
me with no education,

2499
02:06:55,738 --> 02:06:58,001
me with no talent,

2500
02:06:58,045 --> 02:07:01,788
as you've kept reminding me
my whole life.

2501
02:07:01,831 --> 02:07:05,356
Well, look at me now--

2502
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:07,445
a star.

2503
02:07:07,489 --> 02:07:09,534
Look at how I live.

2504
02:07:09,578 --> 02:07:11,493
Look at my friends.

2505
02:07:11,536 --> 02:07:13,713
Look at where I'm going.

2506
02:07:13,756 --> 02:07:15,758
I'm not staying
in burlesque.

2507
02:07:15,802 --> 02:07:17,238
I'm moving.

2508
02:07:17,281 --> 02:07:18,979
Maybe up, maybe down,

2509
02:07:19,022 --> 02:07:21,068
but wherever it is,
I'm enjoying it.

2510
02:07:21,111 --> 02:07:24,767
Mama, I'm having
the time of my life

2511
02:07:24,811 --> 02:07:27,248
because for the first time
it is my life.

2512
02:07:27,291 --> 02:07:28,858
And I love it.

2513
02:07:28,902 --> 02:07:30,817
I love every second of it.

2514
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:33,428
And I'll be damned if you're
going to take it away from me.

2515
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:39,477
I am Gypsy Rose Lee.

2516
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:42,524
And I love her.

2517
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:47,442
And if you don't,
you can clear out right now.

2518
02:07:51,707 --> 02:07:55,755
Madam,your press agent is
here with a photographer.

2519
02:07:55,798 --> 02:07:57,234
Tell him I'll be ready
in a minute.

2520
02:07:57,278 --> 02:07:58,801
Oui, Madam.

2521
02:08:06,983 --> 02:08:09,246
Mama, we can't
go shouting

2522
02:08:09,290 --> 02:08:11,509
seven performances
of this a week.

2523
02:08:12,772 --> 02:08:14,730
The whole family shouts.

2524
02:08:14,774 --> 02:08:17,559
It comes from our living
so near the railroad tracks.

2525
02:08:17,602 --> 02:08:19,169
I'm getting an ulcer.

2526
02:08:19,213 --> 02:08:20,475
You think I'm not?

2527
02:08:20,518 --> 02:08:22,869
Yes, I think you're not.

2528
02:08:22,912 --> 02:08:25,306
And if you want an ulcer, Mama,
get one of your own.

2529
02:08:25,349 --> 02:08:27,700
You can't have mine.

2530
02:08:27,743 --> 02:08:29,223
Everybody's got stomach
trouble but me.

2531
02:08:31,138 --> 02:08:33,880
Louise, let's forget it.

2532
02:08:35,185 --> 02:08:36,534
No, Mama, let's finish it.

2533
02:08:36,578 --> 02:08:37,666
I gotta go feed Chowsie.

2534
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:39,668
Mama, you fought
your whole life.

2535
02:08:39,712 --> 02:08:41,104
I wish you
could relax now.

2536
02:08:41,148 --> 02:08:42,236
You need more mascara
on your left eye.

2537
02:08:42,279 --> 02:08:44,368
Mama, you've got to
let go of me.

2538
02:08:44,412 --> 02:08:45,848
Let go?

2539
02:08:45,892 --> 02:08:47,676
I'll give you
anything you want.

2540
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:48,938
You need me.

2541
02:08:48,982 --> 02:08:52,289
A house,
a farm, a school--

2542
02:08:52,333 --> 02:08:53,508
a dramatic school
for kids.

2543
02:08:53,551 --> 02:08:55,075
You were always
great with kids.

2544
02:08:55,118 --> 02:08:56,772
I am a pro,

2545
02:08:56,816 --> 02:08:58,774
not an old workhorse
you can turn out to pasture

2546
02:08:58,818 --> 02:09:00,907
just 'cause you think you're
riding high on your own.

2547
02:09:00,950 --> 02:09:04,562
Mama, no kid does it
all on his own.

2548
02:09:04,606 --> 02:09:06,739
But I'm not a kid anymore.

2549
02:09:06,782 --> 02:09:09,829
From now on, even if I flop,
I flop on my own.

2550
02:09:09,872 --> 02:09:11,047
Hey, Gyps,

2551
02:09:11,091 --> 02:09:13,093
what do you say?

2552
02:09:13,136 --> 02:09:14,921
"So long, Rose."

2553
02:09:14,964 --> 02:09:16,400
That's what she says.

2554
02:09:16,444 --> 02:09:19,186
"Don't slam the door
as you leave."

2555
02:09:19,229 --> 02:09:20,578
Hello, Rose.

2556
02:09:20,622 --> 02:09:21,971
Gyps, baby,

2557
02:09:22,015 --> 02:09:25,540
may I present
Monsieur Bougeron

2558
02:09:27,237 --> 02:09:28,456
Enchante, Monsieur.

2559
02:09:28,499 --> 02:09:31,154
Enchante, Mademoiselle.

2560

2562
02:09:36,029 --> 02:09:37,682
One before the plunge.

2563
02:09:43,166 --> 02:09:44,777
Fine.

2564
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:46,517
All right, Miss.

2565
02:09:46,561 --> 02:09:48,476
Just one thing
I want to know--

2566
02:09:48,519 --> 02:09:50,043
all the working and pushing

2567
02:09:50,086 --> 02:09:51,696
and finagling,

2568
02:09:51,740 --> 02:09:54,003
all the scheming and scrimping,

2569
02:09:54,047 --> 02:09:55,744
all the lying
in bed nights

2570
02:09:55,788 --> 02:09:58,573
figuring how we're gonna get
from one town to the next,

2571
02:09:58,616 --> 02:10:00,575
how do we
all eat on a buck,

2572
02:10:00,618 --> 02:10:03,796
how do I make an act
out of nothing--

2573
02:10:03,839 --> 02:10:06,233
what did I do it for?

2574
02:10:06,276 --> 02:10:08,801
You say I fought
my whole life.

2575
02:10:08,844 --> 02:10:11,455
I fought your
whole life.

2576

2577
02:10:15,242 --> 02:10:16,547
what did I do it for?

2578
02:10:18,375 --> 02:10:21,074
I thought you did it
for me, Mama.

2579
02:10:30,170 --> 02:10:33,521
Come on, smile, Gyps.

2580
02:10:33,564 --> 02:10:34,957
Show us your talent.

2581
02:10:35,001 --> 02:10:37,133
That's it.

2582

I thought you made
a no-talent ox into a star

2586
02:10:52,932 --> 02:10:56,413
because you like doing things
the hard way, Mama.

2587
02:10:56,457 --> 02:10:58,894
And you haven't any talent--

2588
02:10:58,938 --> 02:11:01,027
not what I call talent.

2589
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:02,898
Talent for the deaf, dumb,
and blind,maybe!

2590
02:11:02,942 --> 02:11:07,772
Not an ounce of it,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee.

2591
02:11:07,816 --> 02:11:09,818
I made you!

2592
02:11:09,862 --> 02:11:12,212
And you want to know why?

2593
02:11:12,255 --> 02:11:15,128
You want to know
what I did it for?

2594
02:11:15,171 --> 02:11:20,916
Because I was born too soon
and started too late.

2595
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,354

Just-- just
trying out a new--

2681
02:16:23,871 --> 02:16:26,787
a few ideas you might
want to use.

2682
02:16:26,830 --> 02:16:30,007
You really would have been
something, Mother.

2683
02:16:32,271 --> 02:16:33,707
Think so?

2684
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:37,232
If you had had someone
to push you, like I had.

2685
02:16:37,276 --> 02:16:41,280
If I could've been,
I would've been,

2686
02:16:41,323 --> 02:16:44,239
and that's show business.

2687
02:16:45,501 --> 02:16:48,069
I guess I did
do it for me.

2688
02:16:48,112 --> 02:16:49,940
Why, Mama?

2689
02:16:52,726 --> 02:16:54,641
Just wanted to be noticed.

2690
02:16:55,946 --> 02:16:58,993
Like I wanted you
to notice me.

2691
02:17:05,434 --> 02:17:07,262
I still do, Mama.

2692
02:17:19,448 --> 02:17:21,276
It's okay, Mama.

2693
02:17:25,889 --> 02:17:27,456
It's okay, Rose.

2694
02:17:32,548 --> 02:17:34,202
Say...

2695
02:17:35,725 --> 02:17:37,771
You look like
you should speak French.

2696
02:17:39,251 --> 02:17:41,078
You're coming
to that party with me.

2697
02:17:41,122 --> 02:17:42,819
No.Come on.

2698
02:17:42,863 --> 02:17:44,212
No.
Like this?

2699
02:17:44,256 --> 02:17:45,779
You can wear my fur.

2700
02:17:45,822 --> 02:17:47,781
I've got a stole
in the box office.

2701
02:17:47,824 --> 02:17:52,916
Well, maybe just
for an hour or two.

2702
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:55,876
Say, this looks better
on me than it does on you.

2703
02:17:55,919 --> 02:17:58,748
Funny how we can both
wear the same size.

2704
02:17:58,792 --> 02:18:00,315
Especially in mink.

2705
02:18:00,359 --> 02:18:03,187
You know,
I had a dream last night.

2706
02:18:03,231 --> 02:18:05,973
It was a big poster
of a mother and daughter--

2707
02:18:06,016 --> 02:18:07,496
like the cover of that
ladies' magazine.

2708
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:09,759
Yes, Mother.Only it was you and me

2709
02:18:09,803 --> 02:18:12,109
wearing exactly
the same gown.

2710
02:18:12,153 --> 02:18:14,242
It was an ad for Minsky.

2711
02:18:14,286 --> 02:18:17,332
And the headline said,

2712
02:18:17,376 --> 02:18:19,639
"Madam Rose...

2713
02:18:22,859 --> 02:18:25,949
...and her daughter Gypsy"!
