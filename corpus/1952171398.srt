1
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,430
Gentlemen...

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,976
as all of you know, Dr. Prescott,
Dr. Lazaar and myself...

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,396
have, for the last 10 months,
been engaged in Project XYZ.

4
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:25,067
Each of us was working on
a separate phase of the project...

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,652
under a security system only you...

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:32,449
who serve and protect
our mighty nation so admirably...

7
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,576
are capable of devising.

8
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,541
It was to take the sum total
of our combined knowledge...

9
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,502
to ever implement Project XYZ.

10
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,422
But in spite of your ingenuity...

11
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,342
a combination
of our general knowledge alone...

12
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,887
was enough for us to realize that
we had developed...

13
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,474
a terrible weapon.

14
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,560
A weapon that would escalate
the current arms race...

15
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,604
to nightmare proportions.

16
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,985
And so, upon discovering...

17
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:12,572
the true dimensions
of our unconscionable task...

18
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:17,368
we burned every note, every equation...

19
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,330
every trace of our work.

20
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:25,627
Gentlemen, we have destroyed
the XYZ nightmare.

21
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:28,755
Destroyed the XYZ nightmare...

22
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:41,601
Destroyed the XYZ nightmare...

23
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,671
It's an android!

24
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,636
That's Dr. Royce Tobias,
the day he signed on to my project.

25
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:45,432
That's Dr. Royce Tobias
yesterday morning.

26
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:46,558
You're kidding.

27
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,352
What's left of an intricately built
human robot.

28
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:54,316
Somewhere along the line the real doctor
was replaced by an android.

29
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:58,236
Now he and all he knows about
Project XYZ are missing.

30
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:00,989
You did say it would take
all three scientists...

31
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,199
to develop the XYZ weapon.
Was that right?

32
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:05,618
Yes, that's a small consolation.

33
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:10,457
There's no possibility that the
other two scientists might short-circuit?

34
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,417
No.

35
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,919
Prescott and Lazaar are still
flesh and blood...

36
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:17,130
but we've got to make sure
they stay that way.

37
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,883
- When did they abort the project?
- Two days ago.

38
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:22,719
They came and told me
right after they burned their notes.

39
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:25,889
So then, if they were working
right up till that time...

40
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:29,183
Tobias had to have been replaced
after XYZ was aborted, right?

41
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,351
That's right.

42
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,521
I guess we have to find out
exactly when the switch was made.

43
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:37,233
I'll start at Tobias' laboratory,
see if I can find anything there.

44
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,110
Good.

45
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:48,661
Well, Diana, looks like we'll be seeing
quite a lot of each other.

46
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:53,749
Yeah, I guess the more I find out,
the more questions I'll have for you, Dex.

47
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,837
Why can't you plan on asking me
those questions...

48
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,547
over dinner one of these evenings?

49
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,716
More likely, I'll be...

50
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:04,427
asking them over the telephone.

51
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:09,807
Hey, Dex...

52
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,268
remember what I used to tell you
in college?

53
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:15,646
Yeah. "Confine your passes
to the football field. "

54
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:37,418
Thank you very much.
I'll close the door behind me.

55
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:52,766
Lady, stay right where you are,
and don't move. You understand?

56
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:55,936
Stay right there, that's just fine.

57
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,108
Gotten enough exercise?

58
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,952
Now, in 50 words or less, tell me
why you were in that laboratory.

59
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,495
No, I can't.

60
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:58,039
You have to. You can't lie.

61
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,293
I can't...

62
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:31,281
Whatever you were programmed for,
I guess it wasn't for truth.

63
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,879
Dr. Prescott wasn't too happy
with his new living arrangements.

64
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:51,092
Lazaar had some colorful phrases about
the security measures where he is, too.

65
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:52,260
Not good.

66
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,303
We've got guards at every entrance...

67
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:57,014
every elevator, and at their rooms
in both buildings.

68
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:59,892
- They may not be happy, but they are safe.
- Good.

69
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,111
Trevor.

70
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:11,821
Steve, it's Diana.

71
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,906
Listen, I'm at Dr. Tobias'.

72
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:18,202
When I got here, I wasn't alone.
I was greeted by another android.

73
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:19,328
What happened?

74
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:22,873
Let's just say he broke down
under pressure.

75
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:24,041
Are you all right?

76
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,253
I'm fine. But I'd like to know...

77
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:30,089
why I'm standing
in a physicist's laboratory...

78
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:33,008
looking at a battalion of toy soldiers.

79
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,343
Just a second.

80
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,971
Diana found some toy soldiers
at Tobias' apartment.

81
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,139
Does he have some kind of a hobby?

82
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:45,271
All three scientists play war games...

83
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:47,773
with miniature soldiers for relaxation.

84
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,566
Did you hear that, Diana?

85
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,818
Yes.

86
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:54,071
I guess only geniuses can play with toys
when they're over 50...

87
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:55,322
and get away with it.

88
00:08:55,406 --> 00:08:58,701
Right. You let us know
if you find anything else, will you?

89
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,077
Right.

90
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:46,915
This is torture.

91
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:55,757
Yes.

92
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:58,593
Dr. Prescott?

93
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:01,554
It's not as if I could have gone anywhere.

94
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:04,891
You expecting these?
Somebody just brought them by for you.

95
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:09,646
Yes, thank you, my good man.
Thank you so much.

96
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:12,315
Yes, now, Dr Lazaar...

97
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,319
we shall see just who should have won
the Battle of Chateau Thierry.

98
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,366
Now, I'll put this here for the moment.

99
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:05,743
You can go in an emplacement,
Commander...

100
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:07,703
and I'll put this cannon here.

101
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:11,916
Yes, here, and here.

102
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,210
Now, I get some positioning on this.

103
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,545
I told Lazaar not to move his men
up so quickly.

104
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:18,464
They'll be moved out of position...

105
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,591
and this infantry here...

106
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:25,721
What is the...

107
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,147
Hello, Dr. Prescott.

108
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:39,110
You're going to do exactly
what I tell you to.

109
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:41,612
Now, listen...

110
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:03,026
A new friend, a little noisy but very smart.

111
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,988
And you have all these friends to meet.

112
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:09,157
So much to do!

113
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:14,871
Just when I was going to introduce
all of you.

114
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:18,458
Keep an eye on them, will you?

115
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:26,925
You, with that flirty smile,
you take care of the introductions.

116
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:29,886
Make sure he feels at home.

117
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:53,743
Yes, coming.

118
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:03,419
Come.

119
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:06,297
Yeah, I have another guest?

120
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,843
Let me see.

121
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:21,520
Mine is better. Mine are always better.

122
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:26,192
Put it in that cage.

123
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,335
So the android Diana ran into...

124
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:47,087
was supposed to retrieve something
from the laboratory?

125
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,839
A reasonable deduction.

126
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,133
It was probably sent to find and remove...

127
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:53,886
a clue to Dr. Tobias ' disappearance.

128
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:57,556
I wish I could advise you that
we've identified that clue, but-

129
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,894
No need to explain. I am Well acquainted
with human fallibility.

130
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,646
May I make a suggestion?

131
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:06,231
Of course.
That's why I keep you well-oiled.

132
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:08,525
According to data just received...

133
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,819
the key to Dr. Tobias ' disappearance...

134
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:14,114
Would seem to lie With the place
where he spent most ofhis time.

135
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:15,240
Right.

136
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:17,326
Therefore, I suggest that you carefully...

137
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,788
examine the present domiciles
of the two remaining scientists.

138
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:23,248
I'm one step ahead of you, Ira.

139
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:26,376
Diana's on her way to Prescott's
for that very reason.

140
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:29,338
I'll give you a chance
to make another suggestion.

141
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:31,298
Do not do me any favors.

142
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:33,550
It's almost Christmas.

143
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:34,927
Affirmative.

144
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,807
I want to buy Diana a present,
but I don't know what to get her.

145
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:43,685
With everything you know about her,
what do you suggest?

146
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,104
I suggest you talk to Wonder Woman.

147
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:49,566
You're a big help.

148
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,615
Dr. Prescott.

149
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,451
Yes, come in.

150
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:05,415
Hi, I'm Diana Prince from the IADC.

151
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:08,293
I don't care if you were from the IADC
or the FDIC.

152
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:11,087
I can't tell you how happy I am
to have some company.

153
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,797
Such lovely company at that, too.

154
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:15,175
Thank you very much,
but I have some questions-

155
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,218
Please sit down, we'll have a lovely chat.

156
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:18,928
- I really can't stay-
- Yes, you can.

157
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,723
- I need to ask a few questions.
- Would you like some tea?

158
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:22,932
- Please.
- I don't...

159
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,101
Doctor, all I want to find out...

160
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,729
is when the android switched places
with Dr. Tobias...

161
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,565
- so the XYZ weapon-
- Plenty of time for questions later.

162
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:33,151
...won't fall into the wrong hands.

163
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:35,737
I'll have some tea.

164
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,948
First, we'll turn on the burner...

165
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:42,410
and the water.

166
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:48,124
Perhaps a cookie?

167
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,293
This is going to be very nice.

168
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,551
Isn't this a rather strange hobby
for the three of you?

169
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,928
What? No, you see...

170
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,307
battle strategy, actually the art of it,
is fascinating.

171
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:06,684
But you aborted Project XYZ.

172
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:08,853
That's quite another matter, you see.

173
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:11,981
We felt war should be kept
on the level of fantasy.

174
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,442
Unlike our superiors.

175
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,111
Now, I have a little mint...

176
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:18,279
No.

177
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,990
- A little orange pekoe?
- Really, I don't want anything.

178
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,784
- You'll love this one-
- Doctor, please.

179
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:26,120
Just listen, I don't have time for tea.

180
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:29,457
- No one has time for tea-
- Okay, let's get down to brass tacks.

181
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,792
After you burned your notes
on the project...

182
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:34,462
did Dr. Tobias go anywhere
with anyone unusual?

183
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:37,131
I've already answered
these questions enough.

184
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,092
No.

185
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,138
But a robot can't just switch places
with somebody without...

186
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,732
My tolerance for pain is astonishing,
isn't it?

187
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:56,150
Remarkable.

188
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,985
That burner's red-hot.

189
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,836
Prescott's been replaced by an android?

190
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,004
That's right.

191
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:21,341
I had him taken to Valley Medical.
The doctors there confirmed it.

192
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:23,385
How could that have happened?

193
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,763
The guards in and around
Prescott's apartment have no idea.

194
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,392
They swear that Prescott never left,
that he had no visitors...

195
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,644
and that he did nothing unusual.

196
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,397
Yet somebody was able to
make the switch.

197
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,149
Wait until Dex hears about this.

198
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,651
In any event, I'm having
Dr. Lazaar checked out.

199
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:40,861
I'm going there now.

200
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:44,281
Looks like he's the only one between
somebody and the XYZ weapon.

201
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:47,617
Steve, if he's still flesh and blood,
it means that...

202
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:50,537
either he's next in line to be replaced
by an android...

203
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,497
or he's the one doing the replacing.

204
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:55,876
And if he isn't flesh and blood,
the consequences are unthinkable.

205
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,879
There's still one more thing
I intend to look into.

206
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:01,047
I'll call you later.

207
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:31,119
I must say, this has been one of my
more unusual house calls.

208
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:34,372
I've checked people for colds, flu, virus...

209
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:36,791
but never for not being human.

210
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,376
Thank you, Doctor.

211
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:44,132
You're the only one that hasn't been
replaced with an android.

212
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,551
The nightmare just goes on and on.

213
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:49,053
Security will have to be tightened.

214
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:51,890
It may mean moving you again.

215
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,892
Just make it end, young lady.

216
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,227
Just make it end.

217
00:19:56,311 --> 00:20:00,064
Then you'll understand
that since you are the only one left...

218
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:02,984
there's another course of the investigation
I have to take.

219
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,110
Of course.

220
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,154
You'll have to inquire as to whether...

221
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:08,531
I'm the one putting
the XYZ weapon together.

222
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:09,657
Right.

223
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,451
You'll check out my friends...

224
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:14,996
see if I have any questionable ties
with foreign countries...

225
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:19,083
and look for evidence that
I'm under some great financial strain.

226
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,544
- It has to be done.
- Understood.

227
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:25,131
But let me point out right now,
it will prove fruitless.

228
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:28,092
I'm responsible for what's happened...

229
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:31,429
only insofar as 10 months ago,
I agreed to work with Dexter...

230
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:33,222
in this awful undertaking.

231
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:35,433
- Where do you get these?
- Soldiers?

232
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,435
From a toy shop in Georgetown.

233
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:39,270
On Blakely Street.

234
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:59,081
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

235
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,633
May I help you?

236
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,563
I thought you were one of the dolls.

237
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,064
Did you?

238
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:27,568
I was being quiet on purpose for this one.

239
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,153
It's naptime.

240
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:30,946
Well, she's cute.

241
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:34,491
You like her.
Maybe I could show you a doll?

242
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:37,744
No, I'm interested in toy soldiers.

243
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:42,374
I have something that'll light up
your child's eyes...

244
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,334
like two moons.

245
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:45,669
- No-
- Look.

246
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:48,630
Actually I'm interested in
miniature troops.

247
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:51,216
- Miniature troops?
- Tinkertown troops.

248
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,261
That's the brand name.
I saw some World War I models.

249
00:21:56,555 --> 00:22:01,059
But why would
such a pretty woman like you...

250
00:22:01,143 --> 00:22:04,062
take up such morbid pastimes?

251
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,940
They're not for me.
They're for a friend for Christmas.

252
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:09,109
He studies Von Clausewitz as a hobby.

253
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:10,527
No miniature troops.

254
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,196
- Perhaps the shop on Maple-
- You don't carry them?

255
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,906
- No.
- I was told you did.

256
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:19,870
You try the shop on Maple.
Just north of Third Street.

257
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:22,914
Okay, thank you.

258
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,208
Miss...

259
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:30,046
this time of year, an old man like me...

260
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,216
gets tired, and sometimes very rude.

261
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,554
Maybe you'll accept this gift
for your dashboard in your car...

262
00:22:37,804 --> 00:22:40,473
and perhaps forgive a tired old man.

263
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:41,933
All right.

264
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:44,894
Thank you very much,
and Merry Christmas.

265
00:22:44,978 --> 00:22:46,604
The same to you.

266
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,733
Bye.

267
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:13,172
My friends, did you hear that?

268
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:17,009
She is a lady agent.
She's got to be stopped.

269
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:22,598
My love.

270
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:27,103
At last, your first voyage.

271
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:30,106
Your maiden voyage.

272
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:35,486
For it is a maiden
that you shall be destroying.

273
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:21,716
Tired old man, my eye.

274
00:25:31,768 --> 00:25:34,396
You'll be my most perfect...

275
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:37,399
the crème de la crème de la crème.

276
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,401
Now, turn around.

277
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:46,324
Because of you, my love...

278
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:49,369
all of my friends and I...

279
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:53,039
will be happy for a long time.

280
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:57,168
Now, let me see that great big smile.

281
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:12,141
Now, let me get this straight.

282
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:15,436
- You were strafed by a model airplane?
- That's right.

283
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,565
There's a tree out on County Line Road
with enough holes in it to prove it.

284
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:22,819
What's the name of this toy maker?
We'll have him checked out.

285
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:26,739
Orlich Hoffman, and he runs
the Jungle King shop on Blakely.

286
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:32,745
Dr. Lazaar is gone.

287
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:35,540
- Gone?
- He's not in the safe house we arranged.

288
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:37,667
It's all right. I had him moved.

289
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:39,043
You what?

290
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:43,798
Well, it was obvious to me
that after we lost Dr. Prescott...

291
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:46,550
our security measures
were a little inadequate.

292
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:48,135
So I had him moved.

293
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:50,972
Good work, Diana. Where is he now?

294
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:53,849
He's out of any and all possible danger.

295
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:57,061
But exactly where is he?

296
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:01,273
I'd just as soon spare you
the burdensome details, Dex.

297
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:04,819
Diana's right.
The fewer people that know, the better.

298
00:27:04,902 --> 00:27:06,362
Including you and me.

299
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:08,489
I don't know...

300
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:11,951
How can we be sure her
safety precautions will be tight enough?

301
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,953
We'll just have to trust her.

302
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:17,081
Steve, Project XYZ was mine.

303
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:20,417
If anything goes wrong,
the world will blame me, not her.

304
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:25,422
Relax, Dex. Trust her.
Like I told you before, she's the best.

305
00:27:29,301 --> 00:27:30,719
I see.

306
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:36,225
This list contains the date and nature
of all informational transactions...

307
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:38,811
concerning Major Dexter that I have made.

308
00:27:39,478 --> 00:27:40,896
In code, of course.

309
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:44,483
You mean, you can tell me
if anything's been added or deleted...

310
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:45,734
from your memory banks?

311
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:46,985
Affirmative.

312
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,737
Has anything ever been deleted?

313
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:51,657
Coded item E4F87...

314
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,492
indicates a name was deleted...

315
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:56,787
from his list of associates
in August oflast year.

316
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,747
Can you tell me the name?

317
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:02,167
Negative.
It has been erased from my memory.

318
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:06,171
Can you tell me where it used to be
on the list?

319
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:10,217
The name was positioned between the
names Henderson, Michael T...

320
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,344
and Ingalls, Barbara A.

321
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:15,972
Between "H" and "I". Hoffman.

322
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,185
It could have been Hoffman's name
that was removed from the list.

323
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:21,728
A sound deduction.

324
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:24,606
The name fits into
the alphabetical sequence.

325
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,901
Dexter wanted to remove
any connection...

326
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:30,362
between himself and that toy maker.

327
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,864
He's been behind it all along.

328
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,658
Thank you very much, Ira.

329
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:36,201
Thank you, Miss Prince.

330
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:38,078
Merry Christmas, Ira.

331
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:41,414
And a Merry Christmas to you. Ho, ho, ho.

332
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:52,467
She got away...

333
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:55,428
from my plane.

334
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:57,680
It's just as well.

335
00:28:58,598 --> 00:29:01,184
She's the only one who knows
where Lazaar is.

336
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:03,102
We need her alive, and fast!

337
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:06,356
Well, then, let's get her back,
like we planned.

338
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:08,399
No.

339
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:10,860
I need a guarantee this time.

340
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:14,405
Your over-sized dolls don't exactly
have a flawless performance record.

341
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:17,867
- Yeah, but they get better.
- I don't want better. I want perfect!

342
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:20,953
I want that guarantee.
If anything goes wrong with this one-

343
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:22,872
Nothing will go wrong.

344
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:26,292
I'm this far, Hoffman.

345
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:29,170
I've been shining my shoes
like a good boy...

346
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:32,965
and saying "Yes, sir" and "No, sir"
to idiots in uniform for 15 years...

347
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,802
just waiting for something
like XYZ to come along.

348
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:37,804
And I am this far from making it pay off!

349
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:41,140
- I know!
- This far from never having to sweat...

350
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:45,645
or worry, or take orders, or put up with
anybody's stupidity ever again!

351
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:47,980
Now, I'm depending on you!

352
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:51,734
And you can and you should.

353
00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:54,946
You're the one human being
who believed in me...

354
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:58,157
and what my toys could do.
You can depend on us.

355
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:04,580
All right.

356
00:30:05,456 --> 00:30:07,500
We'll pick up Dr. Lazaar in the morning.

357
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,336
And then we'll ship him out
with the other two doctors...

358
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:13,339
and send them to my buyer
out of the country.

359
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:17,051
And then we'll reap the rewards
of Project XYZ.

360
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:20,804
- We won't let you down.
- That's right. You won't.

361
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:23,515
Because if you do, you won't be alive.

362
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:29,021
Get ready.

363
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:39,907
- Hello?
- Hello? Diana.

364
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,533
This is Dexter.

365
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:44,203
I have some wonderful news for you.

366
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:46,580
I've found somebody
who knows the whereabouts...

367
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:49,249
of Dr. Tobias and Dr. Prescott.

368
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:50,959
Really?

369
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:54,254
Yes. I'd like you to meet this person
at midnight...

370
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:57,090
at the southwest corner of Perry Park.

371
00:30:58,675 --> 00:31:02,054
I'm gonna have to clear this with Steve,
you know.

372
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:06,058
Listen, I'll save you a dime.
Steve's right here.

373
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:14,232
Diana? There's no time to explain.

374
00:31:14,316 --> 00:31:16,902
Just be at the park in 20 minutes
like Dex said.

375
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:19,696
Call me When you have Tobias
and Prescott. Okay?

376
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:07,869
- Hello, Diana.
- Hello...

377
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,873
Wonder Woman.

378
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:16,294
You've been working
on the XYZ case all along?

379
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:17,545
Yes.

380
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,964
From the moment
Dr. Tobias disappeared...

381
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:22,675
I knew the safety of the entire world
was at stake.

382
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:24,135
And you found the doctors?

383
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:27,096
Yes, in the basement of that toy shop.

384
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:29,974
- Let's go.
- Anything you say.

385
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:45,865
Well, Diana...

386
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:49,160
this is your little night for surprises,
isn't it?

387
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:50,828
- Not really.
- Oh, come now.

388
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:54,665
Don't tell me I was high on your hit parade
of suspects all along?

389
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:57,960
Let's just say I wasn't blinded by faith
the way Steve was.

390
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:01,255
Yes, I always say,
there's nothing like a good friend.

391
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:03,382
- Right, Orlich?
- Yes.

392
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:06,510
One could always use a good friend.

393
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:08,054
Absolutely.

394
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:11,849
Now, Diana, where is Dr. Lazaar?

395
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:15,519
- You can't possibly believe I'd tell you.
- No, I don't.

396
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:17,897
Orlich?

397
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:24,570
- My good friend...
- My good friend.

398
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:25,738
Yes.

399
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:07,112
Now, Diana...

400
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:13,035
you can't help but tell me
where you've hidden the good Dr. Lazaar.

401
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:15,579
Where is he?

402
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:21,418
I can't. He's the only one left.

403
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:27,883
Where is Dr. Lazaar?
Where did you arrange to have him held?

404
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,762
My apartment...

405
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,223
410...

406
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:38,560
in the Spruce Building.

407
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:42,939
Under what kind of guard?

408
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:49,571
One plainclothesman at the door...

409
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,907
a guard at the elevator...

410
00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:56,328
armed, both of them...

411
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:59,956
and two cars circling all the time.

412
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:04,961
Was there a password?

413
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:09,424
Yes, the guard at the door...

414
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:13,970
is "alphabet soup. "

415
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,515
Alphabet soup.

416
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:20,810
Any other safety precautions?

417
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,688
No, the simpler, the better.

418
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:26,733
How thoughtful.

419
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:34,324
Go to sleep, now, Diana.

420
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:36,242
Have a nice long nap.

421
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:44,500
Make sure she stays under.
I'm going to get Lazaar.

422
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:48,379
I want you to load up Tobias and Prescott,
get them into the van...

423
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,590
and meet me at the dam
at precisely 11:00.

424
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:53,259
- You got that?
00.

425
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:57,263
But the lady. She was not in our plans.

426
00:35:58,014 --> 00:36:00,266
You don't have to worry about her.

427
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:02,935
After we're all through,
we'll find Sleeping Beauty...

428
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:06,522
a nice quiet place
where she can just go right on sleeping.

429
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:07,857
Forever.

430
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:10,985
Lock the door.

431
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:48,230
Good morning.

432
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:53,569
I wonder if I might be able to interest you
in a bowl of alphabet soup?

433
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,114
Yes, sir. Come in, please.

434
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:30,814
It's almost 11:00. We have to get
them loaded and on our way.

435
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,566
Come.

436
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,925
At this rate we'll never get him out
of the basement...

437
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,302
let alone the country.

438
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:03,638
I did pretty well giving you strength...

439
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:07,851
but not too good when it comes
to showing respect for your elders.

440
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:04,240
As soon as we get Dr. Tobias,
we should be on our way.

441
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:06,701
What's this?

442
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:20,548
Oh, Mommy.

443
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:31,475
You should have stuck to the toys
you were best at, Mr. Hoffman.

444
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,227
The harmless ones.

445
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:35,229
Stop her.

446
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,767
What you do now?

447
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,188
I'm going to get Dr. Tobias.
It's almost 11:00.

448
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,190
Right. Good.

449
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:05,527
I'll go warm up the van.

450
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:44,524
- Dexter.
- You're late.

451
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:47,860
We were unavoidably detained
by Wonder Woman.

452
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:52,365
- Wonder Woman?
- Yeah, she attempted to foil our efforts.

453
00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:55,410
- You stupid fool! What happened?
- She failed.

454
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,663
As you can see, we are here.

455
00:41:59,372 --> 00:42:03,334
The two doctors are in the back of the van.
You have Dr. Lazaar.

456
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:04,710
Yes, he's in the car.

457
00:42:04,794 --> 00:42:08,214
We've got to reunite the three,
send them out of the country...

458
00:42:08,297 --> 00:42:11,050
and we'll be rich men.

459
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:14,512
- Get Lazaar.
- My dear.

460
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:16,347
A pleasure.

461
00:42:29,235 --> 00:42:33,239
You know, with most of your androids,
I can tell them from the real thing.

462
00:42:33,322 --> 00:42:35,825
- Nonsense, my boy.
- No, I can. I really can.

463
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:38,744
Nobody else can.
But I know your dolls from the real thing.

464
00:42:38,828 --> 00:42:40,287
And I want to tell you something.

465
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,706
This one looks like the real thing.

466
00:42:44,124 --> 00:42:47,962
I told you, they get better.
This one's perfect.

467
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:51,757
- She fools even you.
- Don't count on it.

468
00:42:55,636 --> 00:42:58,430
Am I to carry Dr. Lazaar
all the way out of the country...

469
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:00,391
or do you want him in the van?

470
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:03,519
You see? She even has a sense of humor.

471
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:06,730
"Am I to carry or not?"

472
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:24,790
- Get back, Hoffman.
- What are you doing?

473
00:43:25,499 --> 00:43:28,252
If she's one of your androids,
you can rebuild her.

474
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:30,837
- If she's not...
- No!

475
00:44:17,384 --> 00:44:19,219
Dexter...

476
00:44:19,302 --> 00:44:21,930
the disadvantage of rear wheel drive.

477
00:44:29,437 --> 00:44:32,357
She was here last night
and no one's seen her since.

478
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,817
Of course, I'm concerned. Why she's...

479
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:38,905
She's standing right here.
I'll call you later.

480
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:42,408
Sorry, but I would have called in.
I couldn't.

481
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:45,536
- I found the missing scientists.
- Tobias and Prescott?

482
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,788
And Lazaar.

483
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:50,541
Wonder Woman got to them just before
they were shipped out of the country.

484
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,878
- By whom? Who's behind all this?
- Major Dexter.

485
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,133
Dex?

486
00:44:59,217 --> 00:45:02,970
Yes, with the help
of the little toy maker, Hoffman.

487
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:06,682
They were about to sell the XYZ weapon
to a foreign country.

488
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:09,393
Wonder Woman has them both
under wraps.

489
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,812
I'll call the police.

490
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:13,523
No. Wait a minute.

491
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:16,400
She suggested we let them think
their plan worked.

492
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:17,735
What?

493
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:21,072
She used her golden lasso
to make them forget they were caught.

494
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:24,575
Now it's our turn to replace the scientists
with androids.

495
00:45:25,409 --> 00:45:29,205
You mean, let them ship fake scientists
out of the country?

496
00:45:29,288 --> 00:45:32,625
Arresting Dexter and Hoffman
would only publicize this whole thing.

497
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,585
And the more people that know about it...

498
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:37,379
the greater the chances are
that someone else will try it.

499
00:45:37,463 --> 00:45:39,924
Yeah, that way, everybody would get...

500
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:43,093
or everybody'd think they'd be getting,
exactly what they want.

501
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:48,015
Right. And the XYZ weapon
can finally be forgotten once and for all.

502
00:45:50,184 --> 00:45:53,771
Wonder Woman's right again, as usual.
Let's get started.

503
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,232
Everything's all set.

504
00:45:57,441 --> 00:46:01,070
Hoffman happened to store extra androids
for the scientists...

505
00:46:01,153 --> 00:46:02,571
in the basement of his toy shop.

506
00:46:02,655 --> 00:46:05,199
- They're already at the dam.
- And the real scientists?

507
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:07,284
Safe and sound at Valley Medical.

508
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:10,788
- What do you say we get a ringside seat?
- Let's do.

509
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:23,217
Shall we?

510
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:27,638
They think everything is going as planned.

511
00:46:37,981 --> 00:46:40,942
What will whoever bought the weapon do
when they find out?

512
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:43,653
That they've paid for three androids?

513
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:47,407
Who wouldn't know Project XYZ
from a science fair project.

514
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:49,493
I'd say they'd be furious.

515
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:53,163
They'll see to it that Hoffman and Dex
get just what they deserve.

516
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:05,383
It's always tough learning
who the people are you can really trust.

517
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:07,802
