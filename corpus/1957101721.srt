1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:04,004
(ominous music)

2
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,121
(bullets clanking)

3
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,392
- [Narrator] Mi
papi always said,

4
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:27,395
all empires are created
of blood and fire.

5
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:33,701
His empire was our
country of Val Verde.

6
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,204
(gentle music)

7
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,911
It was a beautiful
and peaceful place

8
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,515
while my father ruled
it with a firm hand.

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,383
But the Americano
government called him

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:53,587
a dictator, and the Yankee
cowards started a war

11
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,423
to overthrow my father.

12
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,159
Our soldiers fought like lions,

13
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,194
but there was one man
we could not defeat.

14
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:09,403
Mi papi was exiled, but
he had a mighty heart,

15
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,338
and (speaks in
foreign language).

16
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:15,176
He rallied his army,
he rebuilt his power,

17
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:19,847
and he planned to retake Val
Verde using the very same man

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,914
who overthrew him.

19
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,554
- Your friend, Colonel Mantrixx,

20
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,888
won't like this mission.

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,259
Will he give us any trouble?

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,761
- He doesn't have to like it.

23
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,396
As long as I've
got his daughter,

24
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,731
he's got to bend
over and take it.

25
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,401
(phone rings)

26
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,235
- Si.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,377
Colonel Mantrixx was
not on the plane.

28
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,045
Kill her.

29
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,284
(dramatic music)

30
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,102
(gun firing)

31
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,305
(yelling)

32
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,983
(bullets clanging)

33
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:44,498
- Welcome back, John, so
glad you could make it.

34
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,335
(explosion booms)

35
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,045
- Felipe we must hide!

36
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,148
(speaks in foreign language)

37
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,684
(gun firing)

38
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,325
- Cheni!

39
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,192
Cheni!

40
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:33,414
(gun firing)
(yelling)

41
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:36,317
(glass shattering)

42
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,855
- Daddy?

43
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,531
- [Narrator] I saw
mi papi die that day.

44
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,333
And I swore I would
have my revenge.

45
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,237
(upbeat music)

46
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,948
- Leave anyone alive?

47
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,050
- Just the mariachis.

48
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,388
(speaking in foreign language)

49
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,758
- John, I'd like you to start
up your old squad again.

50
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,193
- This was the
last time, General.

51
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,530
- What are you gonna
do with yourself?

52
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:23,397
Be a cop?

53
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,966
A construction worker?

54
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,702
You are the last action hero.

55
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,904
John, what do you say?

56
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,608
- No chance.

57
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,600
(playful music)

58
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,573
- They drew first blood.

59
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:06,407
- That's finger paint, dumbass.

60
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,575
Here's your mail.

61
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,354
- Yippe-kay-AY, Mr. Falcon.

62
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,090
- [Orderly] Mail call.

63
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:33,133
(ominous music)

64
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,043
- You are one
weird motherfucker.

65
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:43,877
Leave me alone!

66
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,484
- [Orderly] Somebody loves ya.

67
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,366
- I love you, Dad.

68
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,206
Dear Daddy.

69
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,043
- [Cheni] I'm sorry it's been
so long since I've written,

70
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,346
but sometimes it's hard
to put things into words.

71
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,815
First of all, I wanted
to thank you for being

72
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,984
such a great dad.

73
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,520
You taught me about nature,

74
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:29,490
you taught me how to
have good table manners,

75
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,559
Daddy I'll never forget
about the fun times

76
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,593
we had together.

77
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:38,065
You taught me how to be
a confident young lady.

78
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,233
You were the total
Daddy package.

79
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:44,204
You were so much
fun to grow up with.

80
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,405
- Yes!

81
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,675
- [Cheni] And once
those bad men took me,

82
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,844
you did things for me that
most dads never could.

83
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,345
- If you want your kid back,

84
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,381
you gotta cooperate, right?

85
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,749
- Wrong.

86
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,718
(gun firing)

87
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,753
- [Cheni] After you rescued me,

88
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,388
I'll never forget
that you turned down

89
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,591
the military to stay with me.

90
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,393
And after what happened,
I can understand

91
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,928
why you were so protective.

92
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,264
But when I started dating,

93
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,200
you took things way too far.

94
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,268
- Cheni, no!

95
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,437
(gasping)

96
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,271
- Daddy!

97
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,142
After you wiped out
my after prom party,

98
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,546
I guess everyone realized
that you just cared too much.

99
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:31,485
- Under the provisions
of the Rambo Act,

100
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,253
I am taking this homicidal

101
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,657
former war hero into
military custody

102
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,458
for psychiatric rehabilitation.

103
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,963
- No!

104
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:43,831
Dad!

105
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,569
The General told me they took

106
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,672
you to a really nice place,
and in the last few years

107
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,941
you've made great progress.

108
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,344
Well, Daddy, I'm
making progress, too.

109
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,946
I'm getting married!

110
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,247
- Married?

111
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,449
- [Cheni] I know this is
a little bit of a shock,

112
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,819
but please Daddy try
to be happy for me.

113
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,821
Love, Cheni.

114
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,822
- Cheni!

115
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,323
No!

116
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,759
(yelling)

117
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,161
- Time to get these guys
doped up and locked up.

118
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,830
- Cheni.

119
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:17,698
No Cheni.

120
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,368
(ominous music)

121
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,707
Cheni!

122
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,475
Cheni, where are you?

123
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,780
Daddy's coming!

124
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,383
- Daddy?

125
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,286
- No, not daddy.

126
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,489
(gun firing)

127
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,658
(yelling)

128
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,695
- Barrett!

129
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,566
Let the girl go, it's
me that you want!

130
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,735
- I don't need the girl, John.

131
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,004
I don't need the girl!

132
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,371
- Come on, Barrett.

133
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,140
Throw away that chickenshit gun.

134
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,508
Put a knife in me!

135
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,710
And look me in the eye and see

136
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,745
what's going on in
there when you turn it.

137
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:05,879
Let's party.

138
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,716
- I don't need the gun, John.

139
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,084
I can beat you.

140
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,152
I don't need no gun!

141
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,590
I'm gonna kill you now!

142
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,160
(screams)

143
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,395
(grunting)

144
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:37,711
- You're getting old, John.

145
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:38,612
- Bullshit!

146
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,882
(grunting)

147
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,766
- I'm not gonna shoot you
between the eyes, John,

148
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:01,401
I'm gonna shoot you
between the balls!

149
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,637
(grunting)

150
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,941
(grunting)

151
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,553
- Let off some steam, Barrett.

152
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,097
(grunting)

153
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,064
- Looks like you
got it in your head

154
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,766
to be a real troublemaker.

155
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,236
But we got a solution
for troublemakers.

156
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,571
I don't know why that
letter got you so riled up,

157
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,273
but a big enough
dose of the juice

158
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,110
will make a guy forget
just about anything.

159
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,411
Right?

160
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:48,515
You'll be a quiet little
boy from now on, right?

161
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,952
- Wrong.

162
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,187
(grunting)

163
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,459
(siren blaring)

164
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,196
(grunting)

165
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,552
(groaning)

166
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,821
(grunting)

167
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,795
- What the hell?

168
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,797
Look who's crazy now!

169
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,335
(toilet flushes)

170
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,742
(pensive music)

171
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,319
(beeping)

172
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,260
Married on Sunday?

173
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,598
No chance.

174
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,175
(grunting)

175
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,691
(dramatic music)

176
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,766
You always show up right
after the dirty work.

177
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,936
How did you know
where to find me?

178
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,972
- I've been assigned to
this place for years.

179
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,206
- But why were you there?

180
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,776
Wait, why was I there?

181
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,779
- That place is a
dumping ground, John.

182
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,981
Where the government puts men

183
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,283
who are too dangerous to
leave out in the open.

184
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,586
Your last assignment was to stay

185
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:09,389
there for the rest
of your natural life.

186
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,657
I'm sorry, John.

187
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,161
It breaks my heart to
see it end like this.

188
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,663
Whole damn thing reminds
me of El Salvador.

189
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,232
You remember El Salvador, John?

190
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,136
- Yeah, I remember El Salvador.

191
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,972
I remember it went
something like, this.

192
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,240
(grunting)

193
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,777
- We still got the
moves, eh, John?

194
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,312
- What's this we bullshit?

195
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,813
Yours is barely unconscience.

196
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,584
(grunting)

197
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,154
- Now you've got to
get out of here, John.

198
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,157
Find a nice, quiet place and
start a new life for yourself.

199
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,759
- I can't do that, General.

200
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,930
They've got Cheni,
I've go to save her!

201
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,598
- Are you feeling okay, John?

202
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,934
That was a long time ago.

203
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,335
- I know that she's grown up.

204
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,870
But they have her again.

205
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,172
The letter she sent
me, the picture,

206
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,707
it doesn't make any sense.

207
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,709
I know that she's in danger!

208
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,643
Will you help me?

209
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,314
- I believe you,
John, but I'm sorry.

210
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,283
I'm barely active duty anymore.

211
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,952
But I think I
still can help you.

212
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,226
Here's some gear
to get you started.

213
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,966
And this is the shadiest
nightclub in town.

214
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,235
It's called Huntin' Slash.

215
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,802
It's run by a guy named Sullee,

216
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,906
and it's a down and dirty place.

217
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,707
- Sullee?

218
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,544
I knew a Sullee.

219
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,647
Sullee?

220
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:41,848
Remember when I told you I
was going to kill you last?

221
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,750
- That's right,
Mantrixx, you did!

222
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,486
- I lied.

223
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,089
(screams)

224
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,391
- If there's any
criminal connection

225
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,560
to the people who
took your Cheni,

226
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,064
it's not a bad place
to start digging.

227
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,531
- I'll check it out, General.

228
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,268
- And in case things get rough.

229
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,337
Welcome back, John.

230
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,740
You and I are the
last of a dying breed,

231
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,577
so don't go getting yourself
killed ahead of schedule.

232
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,280
(pistol racking)

233
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,581
- No chance.

234
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,284
(dramatic music)

235
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,357
- John, one more thing.

236
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,359
It'll look better if.

237
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,062
- Sure, General.

238
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,698
I'm sorry about this.

239
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,967
(grunting)

240
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,541
(upbeat music)

241
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:10,503
- Hey, baby?

242
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,141
You know, a pretty
little thing like you

243
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,009
shouldn't have to
buy her own drinks.

244
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:22,015
You know, I always dreamed
I'd meet a girl like you.

245
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,584
- Funny, I had the same dream.

246
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,685
(chuckling)

247
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,520
- Oh Wait, I forgot.

248
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,655
It was a nightmare.

249
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,992
- Oh, you're breakin' my heart.

250
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:39,632
Okay, you know what, I can
see where I'm not wanted.

251
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,103
Hey, Tony, get this
pretty little thing

252
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,272
a special on the house.

253
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,507
Show her there are
no, hard feelings.

254
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,450
Cheers.

255
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,998
(dramatic music)

256
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,503
- Sir, the shipment
is almost complete.

257
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,307
We just got a call
from The Generalissimo.

258
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,241
He wants to know--

259
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,375
- Can't you see I'm busy?

260
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,354
Shouldn't you be
stalking somebody?

261
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,055
Hey, I'm tryin'
to get laid here.

262
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,028
- Is there a back
room to this place?

263
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:46,733
Can you show me?

264
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,670
- You see?

265
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,504
I'm busy.

266
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,573
Back room?

267
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,109
It'd be my pleasure.

268
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:57,844
- Thanks.

269
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,382
- Sullee, you bastard.

270
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,287
(beeping)

271
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,322
Locked and loaded.

272
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,098
(ominous music)

273
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,667
(upbeat music)

274
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,251
(ominous music)

275
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,492
- Everything all
right here, pal?

276
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,361
We don't get a lot of
briefcases in this place.

277
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,365
- I just came in
for a quick drink.

278
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,866
My boss is a real
pain in the ass,

279
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,034
if you know what I mean.

280
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,101
- What's in the box.

281
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,139
- All right, it's just my work,

282
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,208
it's a real pain in the heart!

283
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,477
(grunting)

284
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,785
- Another satisfied customer.

285
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,490
- [Both] You son of a bitch!

286
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,024
(grunting)

287
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,461
(gun firing)

288
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:55,562
- Get him!

289
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,798
Security!
(gun firing)

290
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,067
(grunting)

291
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,308
- That guy is one
tough motherfucker!

292
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,676
(grunting)

293
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,977
- I'm gonna kick your ass!

294
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,647
(grunting)

295
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,416
- Magic Eight Ball says,

296
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,050
don't count on it!

297
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,753
(dramatic music)

298
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,864
(tires squeal)

299
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,040
- Mantrixx is alive!

300
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,380
(tires squealing)

301
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,918
Don't tell me to calm down!

302
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,953
That asshole dropped
me off a cliff,

303
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,522
now he's back to finish the job!

304
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,972
- [John] I know where
you're going, Sullee.

305
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,641
You're mine now!

306
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,609
- I'm coming to you!

307
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,445
I'm coming to you now!

308
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,617
- Hey, you ever cut
butter with a warm knife?

309
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,451
- Si.

310
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,921
It's like slitting a
young girl's throat.

311
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,763
(grunting)

312
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,033
(groaning)

313
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,672
- I can't believe
you're not butter.

314
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,878
(whistling)

315
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:29,949
(grunting)

316
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,652
(pensive music)

317
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,328
(dramatic music)

318
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:00,079
(pensive music)

319
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,992
(guns cocking)

320
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,631
Cheni!

321
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,399
(dramatic music)

322
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,239
- Daddy.

323
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,243
You made it.

324
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:38,945
- Thank God you're alive!

325
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,781
What the hell are
you doing here?

326
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,416
We've got to get out of here!

327
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,285
- You're right, Dad.

328
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,787
We do need to get out of here.

329
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,790
But first, there's
someone you need to meet.

330
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,658
- But who?

331
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,697
- What is this?

332
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:02,434
- Don't worry, Daddy, your
friend will explain everything.

333
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,302
- Friend?

334
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,270
What friend?

335
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,438
- Your oldest friend.

336
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,352
Welcome back, John, so
glad you could make it.

337
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,024
- Barrett, you
bastard, it is you!

338
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,359
But how the hell are you alive?

339
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,630
- Oh you mean my
little souvenir?

340
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,165
Turns out, you missed
every vital organ, John.

341
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,136
(dramatic music)

342
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,973
Where you going, John?

343
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,474
I'm not through with you yet.

344
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:44,711
I'll be back, John.

345
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:46,679
I'll be back!

346
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:48,881
Ow!

347
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:51,718
The steam cauterized the wound,

348
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,653
and I'm feeling good as new.

349
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:57,590
I bet I'm feeling better
than you are, old man.

350
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,861
Naughty boy, John,

351
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,930
can't go shooting guns in here.

352
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,331
You might hit your daughter.

353
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:08,567
Get his weapons.

354
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,879
- Chaining me up isn't
like you, Barrett.

355
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,682
Come on, don't you
want a rematch?

356
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,851
Finally stick me with
that big knife of yours?

357
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:27,119
- Oh, I'll stick
it in you, John.

358
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,254
But first.

359
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,356
- First, Colonel Mantrixx,

360
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,558
we have a little job for you.

361
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,362
(dramatic music)

362
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:42,401
John, John, John, John.

363
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,637
John Mantrixx.

364
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:49,141
My name is Generalissimo
Felipe Ares.

365
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:54,580
And you killed mi papi.

366
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,383
- You're Ares' son?

367
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,550
- Yes!

368
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:01,921
I am his son and I
am his successor too.

369
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:05,324
Mr. Barrett, it's time
to begin phase two

370
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:10,096
of (speaks in foreign language)

371
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,263
See to it.

372
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,999
- My pleasure.

373
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:13,833
Darling?

374
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:17,670
- Barrett!

375
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,571
Let my daughter go!

376
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:22,341
- Oh, she's much
happier with me, John.

377
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,175
Toodle-oo!

378
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,281
(chuckling)

379
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,684
- I am really gonna enjoy this.

380
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,322
- No thanks to you,

381
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,358
the people of Val
Verde have grown soft.

382
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:43,863
They have been corrupted
by their little democracy!

383
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,867
But I will finish
mi papi's plan,

384
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,368
and you will help me.

385
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,841
- Never fear, Herr General.

386
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,779
Our friend the Colonel
is quite the feisty one.

387
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,982
But we are in luck.

388
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:06,385
We have just the thing for that.

389
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,220
(chuckling)

390
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,289
- So, once he's drugged,

391
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,224
can I hit him?

392
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,561
- Ey, quiet, you fool!

393
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,663
Don't be a stupido, okay?

394
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,700
Hey, when he's
drugged, can I hit him?

395
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:22,802
- No!

396
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:25,004
The Colonel is not a toy!

397
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,207
And I am not here so
that you can play games!

398
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,310
Now, Colonel, this will hurt.

399
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,847
- You're damn right.

400
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,683
(explosion booms)

401
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,087
(grunting)

402
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,157
- I need him alive.

403
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:47,693
I go get the troops, get him!

404
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,861
Go get him!

405
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,597
(dramatic music)

406
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:55,001
(grunting)

407
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,169
- Never bring a toothpick
to a pipe fight.

408
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,675
(guns cocking)

409
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,412
(gun firing)

410
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,914
- Attention!

411
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:08,747
Attention!

412
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,587
The Colonel John
Mantrixx is escaping!

413
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:19,058
(speaks in foreign language)

414
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,260

(yelling)

425
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,605
- Watch your back, ho!

(guns firing)

(explosion booms)

442
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,800
- We're under attack!

443
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,868
The government's found us!

444
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,203
- That's not the government.

445
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,905
That's--
- Mantrixx!

446
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,875
He's escaped!

447
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:17,809
- Let's go.

448
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,313
(dramatic music)

449
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,749

(gentle music)

464
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,850
- (groans) Barrett?

465
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,387
- When you kicked me
out of your unit, John,

466
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,688
I swore I'd have payback.

467
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,690
You know what today is?

468
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:47,193
Payback, day.

469
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,632
(gun firing)
(yelling)

470
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:59,471

475
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,349
(dramatic music)

476
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,760
- They're all right.

477
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,595
- "All right?"

478
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,397
You want weapons with
no questions asked,

479
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,566
they're the best money can buy.

480
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,734
But there's one question
you'd better answer,

481
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,636
when do I get paid?

482
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,739
- Ms. Maelstrom, that's
not my department.

483
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,541
You'll have to take it up with.

484
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,910
- El Generalissimo is not happy!

485
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,078
- Well there he is now.

486
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,750
- I have just heard that the
Colonel Mantrixx has escaped!

487
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:22,087
Many soldiers of Val Verde
have died, for nothing!

488
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,424
All because of you!

489
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,758
- Hey, fuck you!

490
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,660
The guy showed up out
of nowhere at my bar,

491
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,929
what was I suppsed to
do, knife fight him?

492
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,664
Look what happens
when you do that!

493
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,734
And don't bitch
about a few guys,

494
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,469
I've been spreading
the doc's magic formula

495
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,405
around all the dives I own.

496
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,140
Thanks to me, you have
thousands of recruits.

497
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,310
- Yes, but will they be ready?

498
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,913
- They're almost as good
as your regular soldiers,

499
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,348
which is to say they're shit.

500
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,651
But I've trained them
which end of a gun to hold.

501
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,421
All they need to do is
follow simple orders.

502
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,989
Once Mantrixx assassinates
the president,

503
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,158
the whole country
will be in chaos.

504
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,493
- My Dad's not an assassin.

505
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,595
- Oh, shit!

506
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:04,963
- But he will
smash your face in.

507
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,600
(grunting)

508
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,937
- It looks like someone
neglected to keep up her dosage.

509
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,972
- So sorry it slipped
my mind that your magic

510
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,309
mad scientist formula
needs booster shots.

511
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,544
- She is strong willed!

512
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:20,546
The formula is made
for average people.

513
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,016
If it were potent enough
to tame her permanently,

514
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,186
it would kill the sheep
that you're training.

515
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,125
(speaks in foreign language)

516
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:34,993
There!

517
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:35,827
Good as new.

518
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,866
Mr. Sullee, please escort
her to her quarters.

519
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,968
- Her quarters, not yours.

520
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,338
I won't have her spoiled
before her special day.

521
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:49,408
- Yeah, don't worry,
she's not my type.

522
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,043
Man hands.

523
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:54,546
No offense.

524
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,225
- Handing out weapons to
civilians is stupid enough.

525
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:09,661
Arming John Mantrixx's daughter?

526
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:10,696
Brain-dead.

527
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,030
But that's your business.

528
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,400
My business, is business,

529
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,067
and you'll be handing
out slingshots

530
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,371
if I don't get paid for
my last two shipments.

531
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,408
- Maelstrom, (speaks
in foreign language)

532
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,843
take it easy, okay?

533
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,279
When I control Val
Verde I will give you

534
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:29,281
20 million Felipes, hey?

535
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:33,385
And a very grateful Presidente.

536
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:34,586
(grunting)

537
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,188
- You will express
your gratitude in gold,

538
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,690
just like we agreed.

539
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,260
When John Mantrixx wrecks
this little clown show,

540
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,930
I'm not gonna be the one
left holding the bag.

541
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,932
- We've got a plan for Mantrixx.

542
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:47,966
- You had a plan
for getting dressed

543
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:48,934
this morning, too.

544
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,769
Look how that turned out.

545
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,571
- Mantrixx does pose a problem,

546
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,410
but you have a reputation for
problem solving, do you not?

547
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,482
A woman of your
considerable talents

548
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,384
should be able to
deliver Mantrixx to us

549
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:09,821
for say, an extra 30%?

550
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,324
In acceptable
currency, of course.

551
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,926
- I don't know, I've
got some boys who know

552
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,464
their business, but
Mantrixx is the best.

553
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:21,467
- Yes, yes, of the best, surely.

554
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,435
But what if I were able to offer

555
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,936
you the services of...

556
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,740
(whispers)

557
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,741
- You know him?

558
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,277
- Yes.

559
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,945
He would be happy to help,

560
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,582
Colonel Mantrixx is not
a hero to everybody.

561
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,756
- You son of a bitch!

562
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:47,959
Where is my sister?

563
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,796
Sandy went missing
two weeks ago,

564
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:53,432
and the last place anybody
saw her was Hunting...

565
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,668
That disgusting bar.

566
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,004
I was checking the
place out when I saw you

567
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,706
and that pervy guy
tear out of there.

568
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:01,773
I followed you to the
compound and then I saw

569
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:02,974
all hell break loose.

570
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,944
I think Sandy
stumbled on something,

571
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,013
and I think you
know what that is.

572
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,516
So I'm gonna ask
you one more time,

573
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,118
where is my sister?

574
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,353
(grunting)

575
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,191
- I'm not the bad guy.

576
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,062
- Then what were
you doing there?

577
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,296
- Terminating assholes.

578
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,033
I'm looking for someone.

579
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,370
My daughter, Cheni.

580
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,173
- She's pretty.

581
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,143
And, she has really
shitty taste in men.

582
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,145
How'd she end up with
creepy mustache guy?

583
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,980
- His name is Barrett.

584
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,983
When she was little, he and
Sullee, the bar pervert,

585
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:49,521
took her to get me to do
a job, but I saved her.

586
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,322
I hadn't seen her in 10 years,

587
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:55,994
when she sent me this I
broke out to find her.

588
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,229
- Wait, you broke out?

589
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,032
Were you, in prison?

590
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:04,570
- No, just a mental institution.

591
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,438
There's something
wrong with Cheni!

592
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:08,406
These men tried to kill her.

593
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,841
She wouldn't be with them

594
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,911
unless there was something
wrong with her mind.

595
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,345
- Does that run in the family?

596
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,381
- Now come on, listen.

597
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,617
When I was in the hangar,

598
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:19,851
one of them had this.

599
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,421
They said it would
make me cooperate.

600
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,792
It must be some kind
of mind control!

601
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,426
- There are some
chemical compounds

602
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,229
that have been known to make
people prone to suggestion.

603
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,566
When I was talking to
the police about Sandy,

604
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:37,402
they said a lot of people
have been disappearing.

605
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:38,937
If they've been drugging people,

606
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,440
We need to get this to my lab.

607
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,942
I should be able to analyze it.

608
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,277
- Are you a doctor?

609
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,781
- What, you were expecting
a flight attendant?

610
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,450
I'm Dr. Dawn Bergman,
I'm a biochemist.

611
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,987
- John Mantrixx, commando.

612
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,257
- Pleased to meet you, John.

613
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,092
Now let's get going,
the sooner we figure out

614
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:04,496
what this is, the sooner we
can save Sandy and Jenny.

615
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:05,330
- Cheni.

616
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:11,069
(grunting)
(gentle music)

617
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,418
- Dr. Mengel has a
question for you.

618
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,121
Do you remember, Afghanistan?

619
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,323
- Da.

620
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,194
I remember Afghanistan.

621
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,040
(jet engine roars)

622
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,717
(upbeat music)

623
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,526
* One, two, three, four

624
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,031
- You look like, John Travolta!

625
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,201
(speaks in foreign language)

626
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,304
(upbeat dance music)

627
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,156
(laughing)

628
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:41,993
(singing in foreign language)

629
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,070
(group cheers)

630
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,272
(laughing)

631
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:04,582
(speaking in foreign language)

632
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,416
- Yakov!

633
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,387
- Orders?

634
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,889
- Da.

635
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:15,060
Moscow wants words with
our American friend.

636
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,730
We are to take him by convoy
to Jalalabad Airfield.

637
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,931
- Simple.

638
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,601
- Not so simple,
we have no escort.

639
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:28,206
All available armor is tied up
by heavy mujahedin activity.

640
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,475
- So convoy is one truck?

641
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:33,411
- Not to worry, comrade,
intelligence says

642
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,380
mujahedin activity
will be light.

643
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:38,483
- Intelligence.

644
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,086
(upbeat music)

645
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,481
- What the fuck?

646
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,085
- Attention!

647
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,622
At ease, soldiers.

648
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:21,459
Last night, we had a chopper
get shot down over Afghanistan.

649
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,931
It was carrying a U.S.
Intelligence asset.

650
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,435
- These CIA guys, do
they always travel

651
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:32,103
on the wrong side of the border?

652
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,638
They wouldn't be handing
Stinger missiles over

653
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,874
to the rebels, now would they?

654
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:39,477
- Your unit is going to
infiltrate at 1800 hours

655
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,547
and rendezvous with
the mujahedin rebels.

656
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:43,381
- Mujahedin?

657
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,851
We don't need those scum.

658
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:48,186
- This isn't a game, Barrett.

659
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,221
They know every
inch of this terrain

660
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:52,157
and they fight like hell.

661
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,358
You're gonna need their help

662
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,060
if you're going to
pull off this ambush.

663
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:57,062
Get your team ready, John,

664
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,730
the helo leaves in five minutes.

665
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,900
- Then let's not keep
the flyboys waiting.

666
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:03,201
Let's get to the chopper.

667
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,972
(dramatic music)

668
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:11,042
- Mount up!

669
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,344
If mujahedin come calling,

670
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,747
we send them to paradise.

671
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:01,459
(soft music)

672
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,533
(speaks in foreign language)

673
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:12,303
(speaks in foreign language)

674
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,627
- Our brothers have
blocked the main pass,

675
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,463
the Soviets must
take a dirt road

676
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,165
through the hills.

677
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:40,999
We will show you.

678
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,635
- Squad!

679
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,105
Fall in and move out!

680
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,273
Follow our new friends.

681
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:50,741
- John.

682
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,811
- What the hell is it, Barrett?

683
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,414
- When this tour's over, I
think we could use some R and R.

684
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,649
I found a great rate on
these cruises to a place

685
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,485
called Val Verde.

686
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:01,519
There's no women on board,

687
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:03,654
just good ole male bonding.

688
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,655
What do you think?

689
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,958
- You can file this stupid idea

690
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:10,161
with your other ideas about
the leather uniform pants,

691
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,998
the sand volleyball court
and the rubber fist.

692
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:15,166
Now get back in line
and shut the hell up!

693
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:19,670
- Yes sir.

694
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,107
(soft music)

695
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:45,663
(explosion booms)

696
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,032
- Move out now!

697
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:47,865
Out!

698
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,167
Open the gate!

699
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,903
(dramatic music)

700
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,346
(gun firing)

701
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,081
- Fan out, engage!

702
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:05,583
(guns firing)

703
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,062
(guns firing)

704
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,268
(gun firing)

705
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,103
- Filthy Russian dogs.

706
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,008
Oh, Daddy's here to
give you a spanking!

707
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:35,880
(explosion booms)
(grunting)

708
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,283
(gun firing)

709
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,590
(guns firing)

710
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,929
(groaning)

711
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,399
Let's see if Yakov
can cull the herd.

712
00:48:57,102 --> 00:49:00,538
(gun firing)
(groaning)

713
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,107
Mujahedin scum.

714
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,981
(gun firing)

715
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:12,283
(groaning)

716
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,790
(gun firing)

717
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,060
(grunting)

718
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,435
American?

719
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:33,771
You are dying here.

720
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:36,274
- A Russian sniper?

721
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,577
You're lucky I hate
Russians, John.

722
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:43,414
(guns firing)

723
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,415
Good thing I'm here.

724
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,921
- God damn it, Rambo!

725
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:53,658
(dramatic music)

726
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:02,367
- There you go, John,
saved your ass again.

727
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,435
But you don't respect me.

728
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:07,305
You respect these
savages more than me.

729
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,974
Well, to hell with
those savages!

730
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:12,210
(gun firing)

731
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,278
That's right!

732
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,214
Yeah!

733
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:18,449
(grunting)

734
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:19,384
- Come on!

735
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:20,285
Bloody gun!

736
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:22,553
Come on!

737
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,055
Come on!

738
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:24,989
- Barrett!

739
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,725
(dramatic music)

740
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,872
(gun firing)

741
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,741
(explosion booms)

742
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:45,976
(grunting)

743
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,350
(guns firing)

744
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,424
- Son of a bitch!

745
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:01,692
- Shit!

746
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,529
(explosion booms)

747
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,336
(grunting)

748
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:13,438
- Another successful
mission, John!

749
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:14,672
Let's hit the showers!

750
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,343
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

751
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:19,844
- Alright, John, not
at the same time.

752
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:20,678
- No!

753
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:21,912
Not that!

754
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,281
You're going crazy
on the battlefield

755
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:25,183
and killing everybody!

756
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:27,185
- John, I, maybe
a shot went wild.

757
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:29,220
- That's all
bullshit, all of it!

758
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:32,056
I think you like killing a
little too much, Barrett.

759
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:33,391
Get out of my unit.

760
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:34,359
Now!

761
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:36,694
- John, you can't do this!

762
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,596
All I ever wanted
was your unit, John!

763
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,434
All I ever wanted was to
be in your unit, John!

764
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,103
(dramatic music)

765
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:52,443
You better watch yourself, John,

766
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:56,281
you never know when your
past is going to pop up.

767
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,949
(dramatic music)

768
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:10,895
- Jesus, that was
a long flashback.

769
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,434
So, you want another crack
at the son of a bitch

770
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,436
who killed your comrades?

771
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,410
(gentle music)

772
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,139
- It's late, but we
should have enough time.

773
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,974
(choking)

774
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:57,775
- Tony?

775
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:04,014
What he hell did
you do that for?

776
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:06,217
He'll live.

777
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,119
- I work here!

778
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:10,154
I have a key card!

779
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:14,024
(dramatic music)

780
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:22,233
Here, so you don't choke
anyone else while I'm working.

781
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:27,672
Why don't you surf
around, oh wait,

782
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,874
I forgot you've been
locked up for 10 years.

783
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,810
There's this thing
called the internet.

784
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,681
(beeping)

785
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:59,604
- Okay boys, here's the op.

786
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:02,039
We're here to pick up an
ex-Special Forces hotshot

787
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,241
by the name of Mantrixx.

788
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,610
He's been out of
the game a while,

789
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:07,278
but he's still sharp
enough to take down

790
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:10,114
an entire compound
full of troops.

791
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,850
That's why our employers
have provided us

792
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:13,884
with a little backup.

793
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:16,621
You dogs got any questions?

794
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,356
- So is it true
that we're working

795
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:20,057
with the Crimson Cockroach?

796
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:24,929
- That name, I do not like.

797
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,204
Now hear me, Mantrixx is mine.

798
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:37,442
(triumphant music)
(beeping)

799
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:40,711
- Good news, I've
analyzed the drug.

800
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:42,246
It looks like it's derived

801
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,214
from the burundanga plant,
I've whipped up a compound

802
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,883
that I think should
neutralize its effects

803
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:46,717
on the brain.

804
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,294
(fuse sizzling)

805
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,768
(sniffing)

806
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:04,602
- Wait!

807
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,404
I smell trouble.

808
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:13,811
Hurry up!

809
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,312
Grab your compounds!

810
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,848
- Okay, I just need a few
minutes to get the dosages.

811
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:18,816
- I'm going to be handing out

812
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,250
some compounds of my own.

813
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:21,619
- What kind of compounds?

814
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,521
- Compound fractures.

815
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,927
(dramatic music)

816
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,879
(heavy breathing)

817
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:52,349
(gun firing)

818
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:59,490
(gun firing)

819
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:03,661
(grunting)

820
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:19,877
- John Mantrixx.

821
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,212
Do you remember Afghanistan?

822
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,248
- I've been trying to forget it.

823
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,851
- For me, not so easy to forget.

824
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,253
You killed my comrades.

825
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,491
(wistful music)

826
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,365
(laughing)

827
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,368
- That's right, the Spitsnatz.

828
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:46,203
They're my favorite
midnight snack.

829
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:49,707
Come on, let's party.

830
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:56,180
(dramatic music)

831
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,252
(grunting)

832
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:30,615
(siren blaring)

833
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:31,482
- Oh, shit.

834
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,403
(grunting)

835
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:11,822
- What's up, doc?

836
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:16,827
(grunting)

837
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:17,828
You dirty...

838
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:22,466
- What the hell is going on?

839
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:27,204
- Supposed to, capture Mantrixx.

840
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,540
- Where were you
going to take him?

841
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:33,343
- They have a compound off of,

842
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,846
the coastal highway.

843
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,014
- Thanks.

844
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:39,316
Now, you know Comrade
Mullet out there?

845
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,018
- Yes.
- Shoot him.

846
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,890
(dramatic music)

847
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,314
(grunting)

848
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,219
- Mantrixx!

849
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,086
Come on, this way!

850
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,724
(coughing)

851
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,732
Of course the car's
on the other side!

852
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,901
- Come on, let's
get to the Beemah!

853
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,339
(gun firing)

854
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:43,213
(grunting)

855
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,729
(grunting)

856
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,570
- Come with me if you
want to live, soldier!

857
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,437
- C'mon!

858
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:18,548
(tires squealing)

859
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,922
- This is my old commander.

860
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:27,591
I thought that you said you
were out of the game, General.

861
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,327
- Out of the game doesn't
mean out of the loop.

862
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,429
I heard the reports from
the units that were sent in

863
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,232
after the firefight
at the compound.

864
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:38,235
Your style is hard to miss.

865
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,237
Good to know I
haven't lost my touch.

866
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,272
- When I heard the reports

867
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:45,810
of the technology
and the experiments

868
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,278
they found there, I knew
I couldn't leave you

869
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,014
out there on your own.

870
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:51,348
- What the hell do you mean?

871
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,485
- I mean this man.

872
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,455
His name is Dr. Mengel.

873
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,524
- This is the crazy
doctor from the compound.

874
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:02,526
He's brainwashed Cheni!

875
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:05,495
- He was responsible for
the monster I just hit

876
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,663
with ol' Patton here.

877
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:10,334
- Responsible for him?

878
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:11,535
What do you mean?

879
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:14,504
- During the Cold War,
Mengel was in charge

880
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,841
of the Soviet Super
Soldier program.

881
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:19,309
The man you just fought

882
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,812
was the program's
prize pupil, Yakov.

883
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,784
He first got on our
radar in Afghanistan,

884
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,119
where we thought you
had taken him out.

885
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:31,021
He later emerged
again as a mercenary.

886
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,792
They call him the
Crimson Cockroach,

887
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:39,029
because he's damn near
impossible to kill.

888
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:48,672
(grunting)

889
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,707
- That wasn't my fault.

890
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,043
That bitch jabbed me with
some of the doctor's formula,

891
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,578
I had no choice.

892
01:01:57,748 --> 01:01:59,083
(gun racking)

893
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:01,085
- I have the antidote

894
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:02,820
for their mind control compound.

895
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:05,355
If you can get us there,
we can save Cheni,

896
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,191
and my sister and everyone else.

897
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,393
- You wouldn't happen
to know where there is?

898
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:11,829
- I think we might.

899
01:02:13,998 --> 01:02:17,667
There's an address on this
card, off the coast highway.

900
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:20,104
But would they really
tell us how to find them?

901
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:22,072
Sounds like a trap.

902
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:25,843
- You know you don't
want to go in to spring

903
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:28,012
a trap empty-handed.

904
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:29,780
- Don't worry about
that, General,

905
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,782
I know a place where
we can go shopping.

906
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,920
(dramatic music)

907
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:40,457
- Sorry man, we're closed.

908
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:42,526
- It takes two to tango.

909
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,895
- We only accept, cash.

910
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,798
Mantrixx?

911
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:48,866
Is that you?

912
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,400
- I require weapons.

913
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:54,972
- Well in that case, let me
show you the crown jewels.

914
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:04,548
What'll it be?

915
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:06,583
- 12 gauge auto-loader.

916
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:10,620
The M-16 A2 with M-203
Grenade Launcher.

917
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,890
- You still know
your guns, buddy.

918
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,092
- The X-177.

919
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,561
Phased plasma rifle
in the 40-watt range.

920
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:19,429
- Just what you see, pal.

921
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,131
- The Uzi nine millimeter.

922
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,934
- Is this for
pleasure, or revenge?

923
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:24,801
- Both.

924
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:33,643
- Brain-dead soldiers and
brainwashed civilians.

925
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,745
Val Verde's finest.

926
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:39,783
- Cannon fodder has to
come from somewhere.

927
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:46,156
But we are concerned
with much bigger fish.

928
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:50,294
Can we count on you to
handle Colonel Mantrixx

929
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,428
when he arrives?

930
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:52,596
- You can count on me.

931
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:54,999
(chuckling)

932
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:56,266
And what about the serum?

933
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:01,338
- Ah, the serum, my life's work.

934
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,975
This is all that
I could synthesize

935
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:08,445
with these pathetic resources.

936
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:13,783
It's more than enough to
provide strength, youth

937
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,156
and to make a man
more than just a man.

938
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:25,395
But you must take but a
fraction of this dosage!

939
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:31,201
This serum was made for
special men, whereas you,

940
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:36,073
let's just say that
an overdose could lead

941
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:38,208
to severe consequences.

942
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:42,079
- I'll take my chances.

943
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,314
You don't know how
special a man is

944
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,416
until you've looked
deep inside him.

945
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,360
- This is the antidote.

946
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,697
One dose should bring anyone
back who's been drugged.

947
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,400
- That covers the
rescue mission.

948
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,435
I'll take care of Mengel,

949
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,938
he and I have an
old score to settle.

950
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:09,506
- See you at the party, Kerbey.

951
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:15,445
- Full points for
originality there.

952
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,847
Though I did suggest
the cruise line.

953
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:18,715
- Shh!

954
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:22,386
Go now!

955
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:26,090
Finish the wedding so I
can fulfill my destiny.

956
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:28,425
Go!

957
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,598
- Herr General!

958
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,234
I wanted you to have something,

959
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,903
something fitting of
your place as ruler

960
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:41,038
of Val Verde.

961
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:43,407
- Oh!

962
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,245
(exclaiming)

963
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:49,946
I will name him Hector.

964
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:53,417
(speaks in foreign language)

965
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,551
Hector!

966
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:57,221
Let me tell you a story, eh?

967
01:05:57,254 --> 01:06:00,424
About the time I
recaptured Val Verde.

968
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:02,392
- Yeah man, that guy
thinks he's so cool.

969
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:03,460
- Well he's got those shades,

970
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,129
and his gun is bigger than ours.

971
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:06,330
- Jesus.

972
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:07,998
You know, they don't
even pay us a lot!

973
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,233
- I can't afford shades!

974
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:11,101
- I don't even have dental!

975
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:12,469
- You don't have dental?

976
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,303
- Huh?

977
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:14,138
You do?

978
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:15,639
- Hooo, this is awkward.

979
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:16,940
- Ugh, when was that?

980
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,475
- That was the
meeting last Tuesday!

981
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,477
They said everyone,
it's mandatory.

982
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,445
Sign up for the--

983
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,413
- Oh hey, car!
- Oh, yeah, car.

984
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:26,150
(dramatic music)

985
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:39,129
- You here for the wedding?

986
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:40,530
- Yes, yes.

987
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,032
The wedding!

988
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,868
We are caterers, and, well,

989
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:46,303
weddings are just what we do!

990
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,376
- Past the main
building on the right.

991
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,894
- I'm going to find Sandy.

992
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:13,063
- And I'm going to get
dressed for the party.

993
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:15,399
- John?

994
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:16,966
Good luck.

995
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,967
- Good luck to you.

996
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,552
(dramatic music)

997
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,088
(guns cocking)

998
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,663
(grunting)

999
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:47,497
- Huh?

1000
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:51,201
- What's going on over there?

1001
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:52,536
- Eh, probably nothing.

1002
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,204
Catering stuff!

1003
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:56,373
- No, let's go
check it out, huh?

1004
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,210
(grunting)

1005
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:11,888
(yelling)

1006
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:26,770
- Magic.

1007
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,106
(soft knocking)

1008
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:30,940
Come in!

1009
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:41,050
So, why don't you
sit down and relax

1010
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:44,120
while I get a couple
of things going.

1011
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:05,141
- Oh, shit!

1012
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,345
Baby, I'd love to stick around,
but they're expecting me

1013
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:10,247
at the most ridiculous
wedding ever.

1014
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:13,917
So you just stay here and
make yourself comfortable,

1015
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:16,119
and when I get back

1016
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:22,326
we'll have a little
honeymoon all of our own.

1017
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,216
- Sandy?

1018
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:47,517
- Dawn?

1019
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,018
What are you doing here?

1020
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,054
- I've got to get you out.

1021
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,989
- I can't leave,
I'm supposed to wait

1022
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,524
for that nice man.

1023
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:57,727
- That son of a bitch.

1024
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:59,229
The hell you are.

1025
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:01,164
Let me see your arm.

1026
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,198
- Ow!

1027
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,800
What are you doing?

1028
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:10,006
Dawn?

1029
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:11,908
What's going on?

1030
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:12,876
- You're okay, I got you.

1031
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,545
- Oh my God.
- You're okay.

1032
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:16,380
- I was...

1033
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,150
There are soldiers everywhere.

1034
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,652
How are we going
to get out of here?

1035
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:24,354
- Let's just sit
tight for a bit,

1036
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:25,989
I have a feeling they're
going to be getting

1037
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,357
very busy soon.

1038
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:30,159
(dramatic music)

1039
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:21,144
(dramatic music)

1040
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:38,662
- Such a beautiful day, eh?

1041
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:44,401
Such a beautiful day for such
a beautiful lovely bride, eh.

1042
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,938
It's really so sad your
father cannot make it, eh?

1043
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:49,773
- Yeah.

1044
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,575
So sad.

1045
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:53,810
(speaks in foreign language)

1046
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,979
- That's okay, (speaks
in foreign language)

1047
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,147
I will be your
father today, huh?

1048
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,950
Just like tomorrow
I will be the father

1049
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:03,853
of all the peoples of Val Verde.

1050
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:10,326
And since your husband,
he may not get close

1051
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,163
to you tonight, maybe I
will be your papi, eh?

1052
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:17,100
- Yes, you can be my papi.

1053
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,003
(laughing)

1054
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,671
- Ah, yes.

1055
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,674
(soft string music)

1056
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,456
(dramatic music)

1057
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:59,375
(shutter clicks)

1058
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,358
- Dearly beloved,
special friends,

1059
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,393
heavily armed guests.

1060
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:23,700
We are gathered here to
celebrate a unique union.

1061
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:28,204
A union which has
stood the test of time.

1062
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:32,075
He first swept her off
her feet when she was 15.

1063
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:35,712
(clearing throat)

1064
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,246
Yes.

1065
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,283
Well, the couple has opted
to write their own vows,

1066
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:42,185
which they will
recite for us now.

1067
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:45,789
- I Barrett, take you Cheni,

1068
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:48,925
to have and to hold, hostage.

1069
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,962
You wrote your name
on the dog tags

1070
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:53,930
of my heart.

1071
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:01,938
- I lost a father, but I
gained a leather daddy.

1072
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:07,376
Mustaches to ashes,
dust to dust.

1073
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:11,581
- If any here can
think of any reason

1074
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:15,719
why these two should not be
joined in holy matrimony,

1075
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:18,922
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

1076
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,759
(gun firing)

1077
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:23,760
(gasping)

1078
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,597
- Oh my God!
(screaming)

1079
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:30,333
- Consider this a divorce.

1080
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,836
(gun firing)

1081
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:39,342
- Welcome back, John.

1082
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:42,311
Now let's finish this.

1083
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,351
(gun firing)
(yelling)

1084
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,820
(gun firing)

1085
01:14:56,459 --> 01:15:01,364
(grunting)
(explosion booms)

1086
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:04,601
(gun firing)

1087
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,012
(panting)

1088
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,686
(groans)

1089
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:30,059
- You son of a bitch!

1090
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,729
You kidnapped me.

1091
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:36,032
Twice!

1092
01:15:38,802 --> 01:15:40,369
- It's always a
pleasure, darling,

1093
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,505
but I've got business
with your daddy.

1094
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,582
(dramatic music)

1095
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:02,325
(gun firing)
(yelling)

1096
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:10,533
- Goddamn Mantrix!

1097
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,374
I'll go to the islands.

1098
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:19,843
Islands are nice.

1099
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:28,184
I like islands, right

1100
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:39,028
Of course, they're much
nicer with company.

1101
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:40,296
Hey ladies!

1102
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:41,765
What do you say we
ditch this place,

1103
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:45,301
head down South and get to know
each other a little better?

1104
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:47,971
- Wow!

1105
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:50,740
That would have sounded
great an hour ago.

1106
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:52,575
But then she gave
me a little prick.

1107
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,411
- So she won't be needing yours.

1108
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:57,613
And neither will you.

1109
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,818
- Oh, come on.

1110
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:06,756
I'm sure we can settle
this like reasonable

1111
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,825
and sexy adults!

1112
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:13,629
(gun firing)
(screaming)

1113
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:22,972
(dramatic music)
(guns firing)

1114
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:43,126
- Mantrixx!
- Daddy?

1115
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:45,128
- You killed my father
with a pitchfork!

1116
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:50,133
Too bad you're not a
young man any more!

1117
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:52,635
(gun firing)

1118
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:56,806
- Too bad I'm not a
young girl anymore.

1119
01:17:57,941 --> 01:18:00,309
(gun firing)

1120
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:08,551
(blower revving)
(grunting)

1121
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:09,452
- Daddy?

1122
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:11,888
- Cheni!

1123
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:16,192
- I missed you!

1124
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,527
- I'm so sorry I shot
at you the other day!

1125
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:19,896
- I'm sorry I killed
your boyfriends

1126
01:18:19,963 --> 01:18:21,397
and got sent away.

1127
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:24,000
I guess can't solve all
your problems with violence.

1128
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:26,803
(grunting)

1129
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:28,371
- I guess it's
something to work on.

1130
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:29,205
- It is.

1131
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,743
(gun firing)
(yelling)

1132
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:34,643
- Nice shot.

1133
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:35,979
- Thank you.

1134
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:37,313
- Who taught you that?

1135
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:38,414
- You did.

1136
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:39,582
- Who's your daddy?
- You are.

1137
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:41,084
- But my fiance?

1138
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,251
- Right?

1139
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:43,386
- You can use violence.

1140
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:45,922
- Count on it.

1141
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:48,858
(machine whirring)

1142
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:55,664
(steam whistling)

1143
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:57,366
You need to get somewhere safe.

1144
01:18:57,366 --> 01:18:59,102
- I need to get even.

1145
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,572
(intense music)

1146
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,263
(gun firing)

1147
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,765
(guns firing)

1148
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,402
(grunting)

1149
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,544
(yelling)

1150
01:20:15,111 --> 01:20:17,313
(grunting)

1151
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:57,520
(pensive music)

1152
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:20,309
(explosion booms)

1153
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:30,419
(gun firing)

1154
01:21:46,369 --> 01:21:48,837
(guns firing)

1155
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,909
(grunting)

1156
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,428
- These chuckleheads did
have one thing right.

1157
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,697
Daddy's little girl makes
a hell of a hostage.

1158
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:16,932
(grunting)

1159
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:21,870
Maybe I'll have Daddy capture

1160
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:24,440
that pisspot little
country for me.

1161
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,409
Poor little Jenny.

1162
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,710
- My name, is Cheni.

1163
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:30,980
And I'm a daddy's girl.

1164
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,381
(grunting)

1165
01:22:32,415 --> 01:22:35,985
And Daddy taught
me how to kick ass!

1166
01:22:35,985 --> 01:22:37,953
(grunting)

1167
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:41,124
- That's the stupidest
combination I've ever seen.

1168
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:42,758
(grunting)

1169
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,660
You dirty little bitch.

1170
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:49,065
Why the hell is that working?

1171
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:52,435
- Because I'm a Mantrixx.

1172
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,269
Bitch.

1173
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,108
(mysterious music)

1174
01:23:21,464 --> 01:23:22,965
- It's the end of
the line, doctor!

1175
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:25,701
- Could it be, General Kerbey?

1176
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,536
How wonderful!

1177
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:28,771
It's been too long.

1178
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:32,508
- You haven't aged a day.

1179
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,711
- Science, is a beautiful thing.

1180
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:36,612
- Hey!

1181
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:37,446
Who is this guy?

1182
01:23:37,446 --> 01:23:38,681
- Quiet.

1183
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:40,316
Can't you see
adults are talking?

1184
01:23:41,384 --> 01:23:43,819
- You've let
yourself go, doctor.

1185
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,521
You used to work
for superpowers.

1186
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:49,492
Now you're slumming with
a third world tinhorn.

1187
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:52,828
- Hey, come on, man!

1188
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:54,630
- Why work for superpowers

1189
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,299
when you can build one?

1190
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:00,836
Thousands of civilians
under my control

1191
01:24:00,836 --> 01:24:04,573
are sailing to Val Verde on
these all-male cruise ships!

1192
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,078
In a moment, Mantrixx
and Yakov will be back

1193
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:10,979
under my control.

1194
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:15,684
All the power I need to
crush such a pitiful country!

1195
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:16,885
- Hey!

1196
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,854
You insulting Val Verde?

1197
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:22,591
- When our conquest is complete,

1198
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:26,995
disposing of this
buffoon will be simple.

1199
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:29,365
- Hey, you gonna betray me, man?

1200
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:32,501
- With Val Verde as my own,

1201
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:34,937
I will create an army
of super soldiers,

1202
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:39,375
and soon I will have
a continent of my own!

1203
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,410
- Hey, you know what, man?

1204
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,446
You're also going to have
your own bullet too, man.

1205
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:44,280
- I wouldn't.

1206
01:24:45,248 --> 01:24:46,915
(explosion booms)

1207
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:49,118
(howling)

1208
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:59,595
Now, General, you can persuade
Mantrixx to lower his guard.

1209
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:04,567
- I have a better idea.

1210
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:09,638
(gun firing)

1211
01:25:16,145 --> 01:25:18,747
- But, but how?

1212
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:21,584
- Antidote.

1213
01:25:23,386 --> 01:25:26,589
Science is a beautiful thing.

1214
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:32,395
(ominous music)

1215
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:59,255
(dramatic music)

1216
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:02,658
(grunting)

1217
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:22,978
(groaning)

1218
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:29,618
- Hello, darling.

1219
01:26:30,553 --> 01:26:32,721
(sighing)

1220
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,325
(cheering)

1221
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:38,994
(grunting)

1222
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:40,796
- And we're back,
ladies and gentlemen

1223
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:43,299
to the Arms of Iron Tournament!

1224
01:26:43,299 --> 01:26:45,868
Representing the Soviet Union,

1225
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:49,171
Yakov Jakemoff and in the
red white and blue corner,

1226
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:52,875
John Mantrixx,
decorated war veteran!

1227
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:54,510
From the look in their eyes,

1228
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:56,679
this clearly isn't the
first time these two

1229
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:58,180
have met on the battlefield.

1230
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,849
- What's the matter,
KGB got you pushing

1231
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:02,318
too many pencils?

1232
01:27:02,318 --> 01:27:03,852
- I must break you.

1233
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,489
- This doesn't look
good for Mantrixx,

1234
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:08,257
Yakov has got the upper hand.

1235
01:27:08,257 --> 01:27:10,426
He's taking him behind
the Iron Curtain

1236
01:27:10,426 --> 01:27:13,061
straight to the Siberian Gulag!

1237
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:15,598
It all comes down to
this, the final match.

1238
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:16,932
Mano y mano.

1239
01:27:16,932 --> 01:27:20,035
Communism versus capitalism!

1240
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:20,903
What's this?

1241
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,070
He's changed his grip!

1242
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:26,041
Folks, I haven't
seen this since 1987!

1243
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,876
This is over the top!

1244
01:27:27,876 --> 01:27:30,579
(crowd clapping)

1245
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,183
- And Mantrixx wins!

1246
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:36,184
What a hero!

1247
01:27:41,857 --> 01:27:43,359
- Okay, USA.

1248
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:46,429
- Yakov, I clearly salute
your good sportsmanship

1249
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:48,931
and your willingness
to move along the plot.

1250
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:54,603
- Daddy?

1251
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:57,440
- Cheni!

1252
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:00,476
- Daddy?

1253
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:06,081
Dad?

1254
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:09,217
Help.

1255
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:12,455
- Cheni!

1256
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:13,556
Are you okay?

1257
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:14,990
- Dad, this is a trap.

1258
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:15,824
You have to go.

1259
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,403
(laughing)

1260
01:28:36,845 --> 01:28:39,114
- I thought you didn't
need the girl, Barrett?

1261
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,917
- The classics never
go out of style, John.

1262
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:44,587
- That outfit was
never in style.

1263
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:47,089
- How quickly you
forget the 80s.

1264
01:28:47,089 --> 01:28:48,491
- Listen to me.

1265
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:50,526
We can settle this without
killing each other.

1266
01:28:50,593 --> 01:28:53,796
- Daddy, at this point I'm
about to kill the mother...

1267
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,533
- So what do you say, Barrett?

1268
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,136
- That sounds like some New
Age bullshit to me, John.

1269
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:02,170
I say we go.

1270
01:29:03,972 --> 01:29:06,208
(groaning)

1271
01:29:22,324 --> 01:29:23,992
Old school.

1272
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:25,528
(laughing)

1273
01:29:25,528 --> 01:29:26,895
- What the fuck?

1274
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:30,633
- The doctor said there'd
be a price to pay.

1275
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:33,502
Even if I only have
a little time left,

1276
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:36,672
it'll be worth it, to
see you on your knees.

1277
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,709
- So how do you
want to finish this?

1278
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,210
Queensbury rules?

1279
01:29:42,244 --> 01:29:44,212
Bangkok stick battle?

1280
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,549
Or a Cincinnati pipe fight?

1281
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:58,427
- I don't need your pipe, John.

1282
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:02,197
- How the?

1283
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,868
- Science is a beautiful thing.

1284
01:30:05,868 --> 01:30:08,370
- That's some weird science.

1285
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:09,204
- Come on, John.

1286
01:30:10,372 --> 01:30:12,040
Come on, John.

1287
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:13,208
Let's party.

1288
01:30:16,178 --> 01:30:18,413
(grunting)

1289
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:24,887
Come on, John!

1290
01:30:27,623 --> 01:30:29,725
Come on, what's the
matter, old man?

1291
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:32,695
That all you got?

1292
01:30:32,728 --> 01:30:33,929
- Keep your claws to yourself!

1293
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:38,266
(grunting)

1294
01:30:41,203 --> 01:30:43,305
(laughing)

1295
01:30:43,305 --> 01:30:44,139
(screaming)

1296
01:30:44,139 --> 01:30:45,440
- Oh, like old times.

1297
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:51,446
(laughing)

1298
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,982
- Hostages, combat drugs,

1299
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:57,252
body armor, what's the
matter with you, Barrett?

1300
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:59,287
You afraid to fight
me like a real man?

1301
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,956
- Fair's fair, John.

1302
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:04,793
Not everybody got the huge arms,

1303
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:07,763
and the monstrous abs
and the rippling delts

1304
01:31:08,931 --> 01:31:12,501
and the, the large pack, ooh,

1305
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:17,005
where was I going with that?

1306
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,608
Oh, right!

1307
01:31:19,608 --> 01:31:22,444
You got the muscles,
but I evened it up.

1308
01:31:23,646 --> 01:31:26,515
You see, you didn't have
the guts to be a killer!

1309
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:31,153
In the unit, you should
have been under me

1310
01:31:32,187 --> 01:31:33,956
the whole time, John.

1311
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:37,860
- In your wildest
wet dreams, Barrett.

1312
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:41,697
- Oh, yeah.

1313
01:31:41,697 --> 01:31:44,032
(screaming)

1314
01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:45,934
- Oh, John.

1315
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,104
Do you know what we call this?

1316
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:50,539
Letting off steam!

1317
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,509
(steam blowing)
(screaming)

1318
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,310
- Daddy!

1319
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:02,017
- Remember when I said
I was going to shoot you

1320
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,452
between the balls, John?

1321
01:32:04,486 --> 01:32:08,657
- I thought you said
between the eyes!

1322
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:10,859
(grunting)

1323
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,203
- Sorry Barrett, but I'm
only laying pipe to you once.

1324
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,042
(panting)

1325
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:30,679
(groans)

1326
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:34,016
Now who doesn't have the guts?

1327
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,586
- You may have spilled
my guts, John, but first,

1328
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,760
you broke my heart.

1329
01:32:49,364 --> 01:32:51,199
- See you at the party, John.

1330
01:32:54,202 --> 01:32:56,171
And by party, I mean, hell.

1331
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:02,110
(steam whistling)

1332
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:06,281
(speaks in foreign language)

1333
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:09,117
(pipe clattering)

1334
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,188
(upbeat music)

1335
01:33:24,466 --> 01:33:25,567
- Nice work, soldier.

1336
01:33:27,202 --> 01:33:28,470
- Thank you, General.

1337
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:29,738
- John, I--

1338
01:33:29,772 --> 01:33:30,973
- This better not be
where you ask Daddy

1339
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,574
to crank up his old unit again.

1340
01:33:33,909 --> 01:33:34,810
- She's right.

1341
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:37,145
This really was the last time.

1342
01:33:37,212 --> 01:33:38,146
- Nothing official.

1343
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:41,583
But there are several
thousand drug-crazed civilians

1344
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,152
about to step off
their cruise ships

1345
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:46,121
and start raising hell.

1346
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:49,291
What do you say, John,
to a Val Verde vacation?

1347
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:56,064
- No chance.

1348
01:33:56,064 --> 01:33:58,600
(upbeat music)

1349
01:34:06,008 --> 01:34:08,777
(dramatic music)

1350
01:35:09,805 --> 01:35:12,507
(fauna chirping)

1351
01:35:36,832 --> 01:35:39,835
(branches rustling)

1352
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:05,093
(gun firing)

1353
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:07,095
If it bleeds we can kill it.

1354
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:12,267
(yelling)

1355
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:15,037
(dramatic music)
