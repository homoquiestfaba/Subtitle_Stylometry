2
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,329
Will you be my Valentine?

3
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:54,962
Do you prefer flowers or candy?

4
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,344
"Dear Coach...

5
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,056
...I've been dating a guy
I really like, but...

6
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:07,516
...Valentine's Day is
just around the corner...

7
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,685
...and we haven't
made any plans yet.

8
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:12,271
Every time I bring it up,
he doesn't take the hint.

9
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,816
Valentine's Day is really
important to me, but not to him.

10
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,111
I'm wondering if this relationship
is going anywhere. Signed...

11
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,488
...Should I Move On?"

12
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:23,407
Probably, or she wouldn't
have asked my advice.

13
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:30,081
Dear Should I Move On...

14
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:34,169
...I'm not a big fan
of Valentine's Day but if...

15
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:38,339
...you are and that doesn't matter
to him, maybe you should move on.

16
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:41,300
His insensitivity suggests
the kind of man he is.

17
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:42,676
We need more powdered sugar.

18
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:44,445
I got a response
from Consult the Coach.

19
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:45,346
Who?

20
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:46,847
The advice column.

21
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,600
Not someone you should
trust with your heart.

22
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:52,019
Don't waste time on Mr. Wrong.

23
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:53,896
Go find Mr. Right.

24
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:57,733
The Coach thinks
I should move on.

25
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:00,611
Want my advice?

26
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,101
Don't take your marching orders
from some so-called coach.

27
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:10,204
That might have been overkill.

28
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:12,581
But I'm probably saving her
a lot of grief.

29
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,126
I know how this turns out.

30
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,878
I'm going to be late.

31
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:55,708
Hey. Gary.
You owe me 20 bucks.

32
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:06,677
I'd like to make a reservation
for four for 7:30.

33
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:11,974
Oh, that's too bad.

34
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:15,186
This is Lauren Port
from The Banner.

35
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,063
Oh, you can?

36
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,859
That's wonderful.
Yes, 7:30.

37
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:23,360
We'll see you then.
Thank you.

38
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:25,070
Well played.

39
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,199
Well, if we don't get twins in bed
by 9:00 then we are up all night.

40
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:31,410
Listen I want to give you
a new assignment.

41
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,537
Instead of dispensing advice...

42
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:36,248
...I want you to write
some very special columns.

43
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:37,457
Great.

44
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,377
"All Things Valentine?"

45
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:43,005
We are going to be doing
a cross-media campaign...

46
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:45,049
...spanning
all The Banner outlets...

47
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,009
...newspapers, websites.

48
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:49,136
We are going to become
the go-to spot for...

49
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:50,471
All things Valentine.

50
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,932
And I want a column
on Valentine's...

51
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,184
...every day between
now and February 14.

52
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:57,895
You know, I think I'd be
better off sticking to advice.

53
00:05:58,187 --> 00:05:59,897
Why?
What's the problem?

54
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:03,525
This is an opportunity.
You're a good writer, you can do this.

55
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,734
It's the subject matter
that I have a problem with.

56
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:09,865
What's the objection
to Valentine's Day?

57
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:11,575
Well typically,
it's a disaster.

58
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:12,785
How so?

59
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:16,163
Okay. Well...

60
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,510
...there was a time that I spilled
an entire bottle of cherry soda...

61
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,795
...on my sixth-grade crush
at the Valentine's Day dance.

62
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:26,340
And then in college,
my boyfriend regifted the iPod...

63
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:28,968
...I gave him for Valentine's Day
to the Home Coming Queen.

64
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:32,137
She eventually dumped him,
but she kept that iPod.

65
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:34,223
And yet you graduated summa...

66
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,849
Magna cum laude, but...

67
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:40,312
And then there's the kicker the one
that I really just can't get over.

68
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:45,526
Its really personal.

69
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:48,362
I can do personal.

70
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,700
Just imagine me as your friend
in your boss's clothes.

71
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:56,328
I was dating this guy...

72
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:58,414
...and I was in love,
or I thought I was...

73
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:02,751
...and I went over to his place
on Valentine's Day, and...

74
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,462
Yeah. You know the rest.

75
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:10,301
It's that stunning moment
that steals your faith in love.

76
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:17,766
You do have a way
with words.

77
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:20,769
Yeah. Not so much with men.

78
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:23,397
Consult The Coach
is anonymous.

79
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:25,566
It wouldn't be you writing
those columns...

80
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:29,695
...but someone who adores
Valentine's Day.

81
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:31,322
An anonymous fraud.

82
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:32,697
Avery...

83
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:34,491
...your readership is down.

84
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:36,577
This could give it a boost.

85
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:39,371
And it may just revise
your opinion on a pretty...

86
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,248
...wonderful day of the year.

87
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:53,093
Hey, Busby!

88
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:54,678
Have some more of that.

89
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:58,182
Just a little piece.

90
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,892
This looks good.

91
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:03,103
Every single column about
something I would rather avoid.

92
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:04,938
That's a lot of Valentine's Day.

93
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,750
How come they don't give you
a byline?

94
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:09,234
I don't want a byline.
I like the anonymity.

95
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,963
The Coach isn't who I am,
it's just something I write.

96
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:13,197
What will you write about?

97
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:17,076
I've got my first column figured
out: "Romantic Restaurants."

98
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,179
After that, I'm going
to need your help.

99
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,206
- What kind of help?
- Well...

100
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:24,291
...you guys all love
Valentine's Day.

101
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,977
You love the flowers
and the cards...

102
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,545
And the perfect "Remind him
why he fell in love with you" dress.

103
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:31,673
I remember why I fell in love.
Your braised chicken.

104
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,095
I going to need input
from all you true believers.

105
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,722
Your dad is a hopeless romantic.

106
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,517
"Hopeless?" Hardly.
I won your heart, didn't I?

107
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:45,396
You gotta get over this aversion
to Valentine's Day.

108
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:47,147
What's an aversion?

109
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:48,857
It means she doesn't like it.

110
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,109
How come?

111
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:55,114
A boy I liked hurt my feelings.

112
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:56,365
What a dummy!

113
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,952
- Yeah.
- Aunt Avery?

114
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,830
I kinda like Valentine's Day.

115
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:06,208
Really?

116
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:12,381
Tell me what you like about it.

117
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:14,716
Mostly for the candy.

118
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:16,385
And Josie Ward.

119
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:21,181
She's in my class. I made her
a card and I hope she likes it.

120
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:22,975
Well, if she doesn't
she's a dummy.

121
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,519
No, she's okay.
She's perfect.

122
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,773
You know, if anybody could
help me rethink Valentine's Day...

123
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:32,025
- ...it'd be you.
- Thanks.

124
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:34,034
Eat your broccoli.
I'm going to tell your mom.

125
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:35,279
No!

126
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:41,994
Hey, what's wrong?

127
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:50,752
- Valentine's Day.
- What about it?

128
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,215
Well, it's the most
romantic day of the year...

129
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,259
...and we don't have
any plans yet.

130
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:02,097
I have to work that night.
I'm sorry, McKenna.

131
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:06,226
So we're not doing anything
on Valentine's Day?

132
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:09,605
We have tonight.

133
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:15,569
I don't think that
we're on the same page.

134
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:17,905
And what page is that?

135
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:21,783
The page where we have
a date on Valentine's Day.

136
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,577
Like the one we're having now?

137
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:26,538
The one you're not enjoying
because it's on the wrong day?

138
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:30,250
There are stages
in relationships...

139
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,960
...and we're just...

140
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:35,631
...we're not going anywhere.

141
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:39,885
Can't we just enjoy each other's
company, see where it leads?

142
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:46,934
I can't do this. I'm...

143
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,812
- What do you mean?
- I can't put it as well as this.

144
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:54,650
- What is this?
- The Coach.

145
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,276
- Who?
- Read it.

146
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:01,156
Read it.

147
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:09,289
"His insensitivity suggests the kind
of man he is." Is this about me?

148
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,541
Yes.

149
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,878
"Not someone you should trust
with your heart."

150
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:17,839
This Coach person should not
be trusted with a computer.

151
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:21,426
"Don't waste time
on Mr. Wrong."

152
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,596
"Wrong" because
of Valentine's Day?

153
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:27,849
"Wrong" because you don't even
understand what's wrong.

154
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:36,066
I like you a lot, Brendan.

155
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:38,193
I like you, too.

156
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:41,530
Apparently not enough.

157
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:46,577
I don't know what you want me
to say here.

158
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:56,587
Then I'll just say it.
It's over.

159
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:11,852
I want one of these.

160
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:13,788
We just have to find you
the right guy first.

161
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:16,690
Hannah, we can watch Jeremy on
Valentine's Day so you can go out.

162
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,983
Can I get in on that?

163
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:20,694
- No date on the horizon?
- I can be your date.

164
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:22,362
Now, who can top that?

165
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:24,740
- Goodnight Mom.
- Goodnight.

166
00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:26,282
Goodnight.

167
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:27,409
- Thanks.
- Bye!

168
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,536
- Love you.
- Love you!

169
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:32,122
- Night, Daddy.
- Bye.

170
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,416
Okay, next Thursday.
I'll give you a call.

171
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,959
All right, I should go too.

172
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:41,715
Where's Busby?
Hey, Busby?

173
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:45,218
Busby.

174
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,221
Oh, sweetie.

175
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,309
This isn't like you.
Come on, let's get you home.

176
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:55,520
Come here.
I know. I know.

177
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:57,773
- Is he okay?
- I got you.

178
00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:00,101
I don't know, it's really weird,
he's never like this.

179
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,161
So McKenna just walked out?

180
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,246
They hadn't even served
the entrées yet.

181
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:15,666
My dates usually eat
before they run.

182
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,501
What upsets me
is the "Coach."

183
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,836
I read her online bio.

184
00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:22,255
She doesn't even reveal
her identity...

185
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:25,353
...and she's not even professional!
She should not be giving advice.

186
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,987
Well Dear Abby wasn't professional,
and she gave advice for years.

187
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:29,491
Yeah, this woman
is giving bad advice.

188
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:31,449
How can you condemn a man
you've never even met?

189
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,308
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

190
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:36,228
Well, why didn't you want to make
plans for Valentine's Day?

191
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:38,230
Besides the fact that
I'm working that night?

192
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:40,732
Come on, you're on-call
in case of an emergency.

193
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:42,818
That hardly qualifies
as holding down the fort.

194
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:44,236
I know.

195
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,180
I was just trying to be a good guy
and not lead her on if...

196
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,865
...I'm not sure how I feel
about her.

197
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:51,743
- You're way too cautious.
- I'm careful.

198
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:53,537
I know how wrong it can go.

199
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:57,332
Yeah, well, there are
no guarantees with love.

200
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:04,214
Wait a minute.
Who am I to give advice?

201
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:06,383
I can't even remember
my last romance.

202
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,010
Actually, wait, no,
that's wrong, I do remember.

203
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:11,805
How do you reject a guy
for inferior bowling?

204
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,849
I'm gonna miss going
to the bakery, but...

205
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:15,861
...you know, it's just
gonna be too awkward.

206
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:18,395
Sorry buddy, I gotta go.
I'm hooked on Pru's scones.

207
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:21,356
You know who's gonna be sorry?
Coach.

208
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:23,315
What do you mean?

209
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:25,198
She's committed a foul
and I'm throwing a flag.

210
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:26,653
Just let it go.

211
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:29,156
Somebody's got to call her out.

212
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:30,699
Let's go!

213
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,244
There are lots of things
to do on Valentine's Day...

214
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:36,580
...but a candlelit dinner
is a must.

215
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:38,665
So here you go...

216
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:42,294
..."The Ten Most Romantic Places
for Valentine's Day Dinner."

217
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:46,590
Busby?

218
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,178
Are you okay?

219
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,311
I think Kit is making his way
over here.

220
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,772
Not much of a newsflash,
he works across the street.

221
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,020
Yeah, but he's Brendan's
best friend. What do I say?

222
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:05,192
Good morning.

223
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:07,819
Good morning.

224
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:09,905
- How you doing, Mckenna?
- I'm fine.

225
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:13,492
I'm absolute fine.
I'm fine. Thank you.

226
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:15,827
That's good.

227
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:17,537
- Morning, Kit.
- Morning, Pru.

228
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:19,706
- What can I get you?
- A raspberry scone.

229
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:21,583
How many today?

230
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,668
Just one.
I'm kind of on a health kick...

231
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,337
...and I can't go
cold turkey, so...

232
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:26,880
For here or to go?

233
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,817
I have a few minutes before I got
to get back to work. For here.

234
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:30,883
Okay.

235
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:45,273
So, I guess you heard
about Brendan and I.

236
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:47,108
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:48,860
Brendan's a good guy...

238
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:51,749
...you couldn't be nicer sometimes
these things just don't work out.

239
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:57,202
Duty calls.

240
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,050
An Alaskan husky, not the type
of patient you want to keep waiting.

241
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,878
Thank you Pru.

242
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:09,172
See you.

243
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,174
See you, Kit.

244
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:19,182
- Are you okay?
- I've been better.

245
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:23,520
Maybe you were rushing
things with Brendan?

246
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:25,981
I have a plan.

247
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:28,191
If you want to have it all,
you've got to have one.

248
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,527
Married by 30,
three kids, and a career.

249
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:34,155
Well, you can't just corral someone
into your picket-fence fantasy.

250
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:36,867
You think this is my fault?

251
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:40,704
I'm saying get to know the guy
before you make him "the guy."

252
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,079
You know?

253
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,000
How about you?

254
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,836
I'm trying no guys.

255
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:50,088
Better than the gone guys
I usually pick.

256
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:55,886
Gone guys.

257
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:00,807
Dear Coach,
thanks a lot!

258
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,616
Your restaurant suggestions
are on par...

259
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:04,120
...with your advice
about relationships.

260
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:05,353
Your next patient is here.

261
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:08,815
- Great, thanks.
- Thanks.

262
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,465
Hi.
I'm Dr. Bains.

263
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:34,758
Hi.

264
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:37,969
Well, thanks for fitting us in.

265
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,263
What seems to be the problem
with Busby today?

266
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:44,059
Well, he's just not
his usual chipper self.

267
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,518
Let's take a look.

268
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:49,397
What's going on buddy?
You could just...

269
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:51,608
...tell me, it'd make my job
a lot easier.

270
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,127
The telltale warm nose. Our friend,
Busby, is running a fever.

271
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:12,545
Oh Buddy.

272
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:14,255
Nine times out of ten,
it's nothing.

273
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,385
What if he's in the 10%? Do you
have some tests that you could run?

274
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:20,929
We have plenty of tests.
They are sophisticated...

275
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,514
...and expensive.

276
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:24,182
But I recommend this.

277
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,951
And bring him back in a couple days
and we'll see how he's doing.

278
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:30,188
You're really good with him.

279
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,984
Well, don't tell
any of my other patients...

280
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,361
...but Busby here
is my favorite breed.

281
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,613
I had one just like him
when I was growing up.

282
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:40,323
She's the reason
why I became a vet.

283
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,201
- Really?
- It's a pretty awesome story.

284
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,662
Well,
I like an awesome story.

285
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,580
Especially when it involves
a dog.

286
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:52,168
Well, Max had a run-in with
a porcupine, so I took her to vet.

287
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,339
I offered to pay him with allowance
but he let me work off my debt.

288
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,342
I was in his office
every day after school...

289
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:00,760
...for four years.

290
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:04,681
He was like a father to me.

291
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,349
I wanted to be just like him.

292
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:11,062
Well, sounds like Busby's
in really good hands.

293
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:22,782
- Thanks, again.
- Okay. See you again soon.

294
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,956
Office to door service?
We're a concierge clinic now?

295
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:31,708
She had her hands full.

296
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,973
How do you explain that grin
on your face?

297
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:35,170
I like the dog.

298
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:39,424
I like your new vet.

299
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:45,472
All right. Get cozy buddy.

300
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:55,815
Your
"Ten Most Romantic Places...

301
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,984
...for Valentine's Day Dinner"
are already booked.

302
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:00,026
Coaches I know of have usually
done their homework.

303
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:03,490
Or is it that your column is just
a poorly disguised product placement.

304
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:05,241
Signed,
Bench The Coach.

305
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:06,826
What a creep!

306
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:22,092
- Hi!
- Hey, what's going on?

307
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,803
I may have an idea for
your Valentine's Day column.

308
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:26,179
Oh, great.

309
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:28,723
There's this cute little store.
It's The Confectionery.

310
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:32,227
They're having an event.
The flyer says...

311
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:35,021
..."Make something sweet for
your Valentine's Day sweetheart."

312
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:37,107
Well that sounds promising.

313
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,901
I was gonna go with Reed,
but Jeremy has soccer practice.

314
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,153
Okay, well,
thanks for the tip.

315
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:43,947
Let me know
what I missed.

316
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,198
Bye.

317
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:52,539
Come on Busby.

318
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:54,749
We got to get ready.

319
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,713
Well, he's back
to his normal self.

320
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:03,508
He's chomping on the furniture
and kissing my face at 6:00 a.m.

321
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:05,218
I know, I know.

322
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,555
He's a pretty great dog.

323
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:10,765
- Thank you.
- You have my card?

324
00:21:11,224 --> 00:21:13,518
Call if anything changes.
And one last thing.

325
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:15,913
Why don't you and Busby
stand right over there?

326
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:18,523
Cause you are going
on the wall of fame.

327
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:21,776
Okay, buddy.

328
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,155
Okay, Busby.

329
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,198
Smile. One, two, three.

330
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:30,118
That'll be a nice addition.

331
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:36,583
Now that's a lot
of happy patients.

332
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,502
I just love it
when February rolls around.

333
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:41,462
Romance is in the air.

334
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:45,258
And we have to get
some more silk roses.

335
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,386
Nothing says Valentine's Day
like flowers.

336
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,224
Not a fan
of Valentine's Day I see.

337
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:56,144
- No, not really.
- Me neither.

338
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:57,854
And I thought
I was the only one.

339
00:21:58,438 --> 00:22:00,106
I do like the chocolates.

340
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:01,524
That's it.

341
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,196
Well, I should go.

342
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:07,947
Thank you.

343
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:13,953
So, I'm going to this thing
tomorrow night.

344
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:17,207
It's a class at a confectionery.
They make chocolate.

345
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:19,042
- Sounds fun.
- Well...

346
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,651
...cool. I'll text you the address.
Maybe I'll see you there.

347
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:24,923
All right.
Have a nice day.

348
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:34,807
It's the dog you like, right.

349
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:52,033
Okay everyone, we're going to get
started. Please find a station.

350
00:22:56,663 --> 00:23:00,166
I'm Lisa the confectioner.
And I love Valentine's Day.

351
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:04,003
February 14th is all about letting
people know how much you love them.

352
00:23:04,212 --> 00:23:05,546
And nothing says love...

353
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:07,924
...like giving them
the perfect sweet.

354
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:10,385
The one that's perfect
for them.

355
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:12,428
Take my brother, Danny.

356
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:14,097
Please.

357
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:17,141
Danny loves candy corn.
So every Valentine's Day...

358
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,434
...that's what I make him.

359
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:20,645
But candy corn
is for Halloween.

360
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:23,147
Not if I make it
on Valentine's Day.

361
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:27,110
My best friend likes her candy
sour so I make Tart Hearts.

362
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:30,697
But what if you don't know
someone's favorite sweet?

363
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:36,160
You can never ever go wrong
with chocolate.

364
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:39,289
And no chocolate goes better
with Valentine's Day...

365
00:23:39,497 --> 00:23:40,832
...than chocolate fondue.

366
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:44,502
It's so easy to make, and
tonight, you're gonna learn how.

367
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,421
I think you're
gonna need this.

368
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:47,922
- Thank you.
- Yes.

369
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:50,925
All right. Ready? One, two, three.
Is it too hot?

370
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:53,803
Yes? Yes?

371
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:55,332
It's not too hot,
it's delicious.

372
00:23:57,265 --> 00:24:00,393
It caramelizes nice, right?
Yeah. Here.

373
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:30,757
Okay, I did not know that
that class was for couples.

374
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,134
My sister got a flyer
in the mail and she...

375
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:34,844
I actually had a lot of fun.

376
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:36,888
Oh, good. Good.

377
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:39,932
So what's your grudge
against Valentine's Day?

378
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:45,396
Let's just say some
romantic missteps...

379
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:48,107
...that occurred on that
very loaded day of the year.

380
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:50,401
How about you?

381
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,488
It's not exactly Valentine's Day
I object to. It's...

382
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:56,741
...focusing on all the symbols
of relationships instead of the...

383
00:24:56,949 --> 00:25:01,704
...things that make them last. Like
a shared fondness for the Red Sox.

384
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:04,624
Or the Yankees.

385
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:10,004
Given your history
with the holiday...

386
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:11,923
...why did you want
to take that class?

387
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:13,966
It was research for my job.

388
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:17,970
What line of work requires you
to eat chocolate fondue...

389
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,305
...and where do I apply?

390
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:22,058
I'm a writer, and it is for a...

391
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,310
...project that I'm working on.

392
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:27,772
Well, maybe we could
commiserate again sometime.

393
00:25:28,606 --> 00:25:32,693
Us Anti-Valentiners
are a misunderstood lot.

394
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:34,529
Okay.

395
00:25:34,737 --> 00:25:36,322
I could come by after work...

396
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:39,617
...check on Busby,
see how he's doing.

397
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,994
A vet who makes
house calls?

398
00:25:42,203 --> 00:25:44,330
- I am very dedicated.
- Yes, you are.

399
00:25:46,582 --> 00:25:47,834
How's Wednesday night?

400
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,628
Wednesday could work.

401
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,220
Valentine's Day gifts
can be a challenge.

402
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,472
What if I get him
something he doesn't like?

403
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:04,434
Maybe we should find
something we can do together.

404
00:26:05,101 --> 00:26:06,519
A cooking lesson?

405
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:09,188
A lingering kiss
on a moonlit beach?

406
00:26:10,022 --> 00:26:13,359
Yeah, I went there.
But wouldn't it be wonderful?

407
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:18,197
Are you writing a column
or a romance novel?

408
00:26:18,573 --> 00:26:20,700
There are no beaches
around here.

409
00:26:20,908 --> 00:26:24,287
As to the gift issue someone should
give you atlas for Valentine's Day.

410
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,039
Is there a special someone?

411
00:26:27,248 --> 00:26:30,001
Do you speak from experience
or is it wishful thinking?

412
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,334
Send.

413
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:33,546
Why not just let it go?

414
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:37,550
I don't know. She irritates me.
She intrigues me.

415
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:41,304
Whatever it is,
it's hard to resist.

416
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:50,313
A moonlit country lane then!

417
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:52,940
I was talking romance
not geography.

418
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,070
And as to my personal status
and a special someone.

419
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:04,243
- Hey!
- Hey, Dad.

420
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,329
What's up?

421
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:09,749
Valentine's Day research.
My least favorite topic.

422
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:11,362
And of course
I'm out of ideas...

423
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,586
...so Hannah says I should do
a column on cards.

424
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:20,593
When did you
start saving these?

425
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:24,388
Early on. Remember,
I'm a hopeless romantic.

426
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,517
So your macho auto-parts gig
is just a cover.

427
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:29,685
Real men
don't save Valentines.

428
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:35,441
Your mom gave me this when
we were dating in college.

429
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:38,903
Our first Valentine's Day
after we got married...

430
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:40,488
...I gave her the exact same card.

431
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:41,864
You still remember that?

432
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:43,449
Like it was yesterday.

433
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:46,702
And these are
from you and your sister.

434
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:48,496
Oh, my gosh.

435
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:50,873
I remember these!

436
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,711
I must have cut out a dozen
paper hearts before I got this right.

437
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:58,673
It was sad when you guys
stopped giving them to me.

438
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,134
I guess we just grew out of it.

439
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:04,178
One of those turning points
for a dad, when...

440
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:06,681
...other guys start claiming
his daughter's heart.

441
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:10,810
Hannah's heart is claimed,
mine is still up for grabs.

442
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,688
Maybe it's time to give love
another chance.

443
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,274
Fall down 10 times get up 11.

444
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,527
Yeah,
I wish it were that simple.

445
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,362
Some of us guys are okay.

446
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:24,198
Yeah, and some of you are not,
and I seem to attract the latter.

447
00:28:25,783 --> 00:28:28,494
This really rude guy keeps
commenting on my column.

448
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:30,079
I wish he would just go away.

449
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:33,833
Honey you can't write off
a whole gender.

450
00:28:36,836 --> 00:28:38,796
Well, actually,
I did meet someone.

451
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:44,051
Busby's new vet.
He's just a friend, but..

452
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:47,513
That smile bodes well.

453
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:56,355
As a matter of fact,
there may be someone.

454
00:28:56,606 --> 00:28:58,608
He's a friend,
but it has potential.

455
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,695
And since you are so cynical,
I will assume you are not involved.

456
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:05,698
And if you are,
she is in for a rude awakening.

457
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,578
Kit, listen to this.

458
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:15,041
I already saw it. If this is a war
of words, the Coach may be winning.

459
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:21,213
The battle has just begun.

460
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:35,186
Your numbers
are improving every day.

461
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:37,396
People are loving
the column.

462
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:40,733
Although
"Best Valentine's Day Movies?"

463
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:43,277
"Love Actually"
is a Christmas movie.

464
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:46,197
Actually. You've got
real momentum.

465
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:47,657
I want to keep that going.

466
00:29:47,865 --> 00:29:49,865
It's just me giving advice
about Valentine's Day...

467
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:51,069
...seems like such a stretch.

468
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:53,162
Well, I'll tell you
why it's working...

469
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:56,582
...you're making it more personal.
Your readers can identify.

470
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:58,959
Not everyone's a fan.

471
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,920
You mean "Bench the Coach"?

472
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,381
Yeah, is there any way
that we could block him?

473
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:06,175
Why would we? Every time
he posts a comment...

474
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:07,718
...the hits go way up.

475
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,805
People want to see
what he's gonna post next.

476
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:12,056
Great.

477
00:30:12,264 --> 00:30:14,892
I want you to try to engage him
turn up the heat.

478
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:16,602
I don't want to do that.

479
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:19,855
Your fun little face-off is part of
whole Valentine's Day conversation.

480
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:21,565
It's not exactly Pulitzer material.

481
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:23,734
But a happy employer
will have to suffice.

482
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:32,159
Your "Best Valentine's Day
Movies" are a bit predictable.

483
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:34,662
Put away your hanky
and rethink the genre.

484
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:39,834
Here's my list. I like my love stories
to have a dose of reality.

485
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:43,796
Let's open it up to your readers.
Who has the better list?

486
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:47,383
It's a column, not a contest.

487
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:53,097
- Hi.
- Hi.

488
00:30:53,347 --> 00:30:54,347
Come on in.

489
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,559
Are you okay?

490
00:30:57,643 --> 00:30:59,687
It's just a work thing.
It's this really...

491
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:01,605
...opinionated guy
I can't seem to shake.

492
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:03,983
- Sounds like a drag.
- You have no idea.

493
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:06,402
Anyway...

494
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:08,111
Hi!

495
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:12,283
Hey. You're not much
of a watchdog, are you?

496
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,970
I could've grabbed her purse and been
halfway down the block by now.

497
00:31:14,994 --> 00:31:16,746
Well, he's a lover,
not a fighter.

498
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,790
Well, in my professional opinion,
you have a very happy dog.

499
00:31:26,255 --> 00:31:28,340
- You?
- 'Fraid so.

500
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:31,886
Yeah, that's just a piece
that I'm trying to finish.

501
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:35,931
And the photos?

502
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:39,769
Yes. Now,
that is my first love.

503
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,937
That, and traveling.

504
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:43,606
Nice.

505
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:48,569
Valentines?

506
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:50,101
Have you had
a change of heart?

507
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:52,156
No! They're from my family.

508
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,617
They are super into it.

509
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,118
Does your family live nearby?

510
00:31:56,327 --> 00:31:58,496
Yeah, about 10 minutes away.
What about yours?

511
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:01,665
My mom lives in St. Louis,
that's where I'm from.

512
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:03,959
I have to get her something.

513
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:07,254
I usually just get her a card,
but I want to up my game this year.

514
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:09,340
My brother just got married
and moved away...

515
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,310
...so I think she's feeling
a little lonely.

516
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:13,803
Well, what's she like?

517
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:16,972
She's a gardener,
so flowers are...

518
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,475
...redundant.

519
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,102
I was thinking maybe
a piece of jewelry.

520
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:24,230
Something subtle,
not too flashy.

521
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:27,775
What about
an antique locket?

522
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:29,443
Maybe.

523
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:32,333
You could put your picture on one
side and your brother's on other.

524
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,991
My uncle owns antique store
and he sells some vintage jewelry.

525
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:39,954
Maybe we should
check it out sometime.

526
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,249
Well, I could meet you
there tomorrow.

527
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,502
- I'd like that.
- Me too.

528
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:50,422
I think somebody's jealous.

529
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:52,466
Yeah, well,
it is his house call, after all.

530
00:32:52,675 --> 00:32:54,093
I could make a habit
of this.

531
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:55,386
The house calls,
I mean.

532
00:32:56,303 --> 00:32:58,138
Right. Right!

533
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:08,617
That one's really pretty.
What do you think?

534
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:09,775
It's very pretty.

535
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:11,652
Try it on, see how it looks.

536
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:13,320
Uncle Henry,
it's not for me.

537
00:33:13,988 --> 00:33:15,072
Who's it for?

538
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:16,365
It's for my mother.

539
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:18,242
That's nice.

540
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:22,621
Well, try it on anyway,
so he can see what a good son he is.

541
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,456
Yeah. Here. Let me...

542
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:28,586
...do this. I...

543
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:32,590
...should warn you,
I could be back here for a while.

544
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:34,717
Okay...

545
00:33:39,513 --> 00:33:40,598
There we go.

546
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:44,059
Okay.

547
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:47,521
It's perfect.

548
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:49,023
It's perfect.

549
00:33:50,524 --> 00:33:51,692
I'll take it.

550
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:55,696
I'll get you a box.

551
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:01,222
Well, great,
I'm glad this worked out.

552
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:04,705
Yeah, my mom is gonna love it.
There's just one problem.

553
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:05,955
What?

554
00:34:05,998 --> 00:34:07,958
I will never be able
to top this.

555
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:18,260
So, your uncle, he's great.

556
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,845
Yeah, he's really sweet.

557
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:21,555
He's super-protective.

558
00:34:22,014 --> 00:34:23,854
When I was little,
he got me a tricycle, and...

559
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:26,310
...he would not let me
ride it without a helmet on.

560
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,079
Wait, actually,
that might've been my dad.

561
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:30,663
No, it was my unc... Anyway,
doesn't matter. There I was, this...

562
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:33,525
...little four-year-old
biker girl...

563
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:35,974
...tearing around the neighborhood
in this bright pink...

564
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,906
What?
Am I insane right now?

565
00:34:39,448 --> 00:34:40,616
It's okay.

566
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:46,664
Thank you.

567
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:52,878
Even the box is an antique.

568
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:55,755
Thanks.

569
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:59,464
- Okay. Enjoy the rest of your day.
- Yeah, you too.

570
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:04,431
You know, I was thinking
that maybe we could...

571
00:35:04,682 --> 00:35:06,100
...grab dinner sometime.

572
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:09,353
The Anti-
Valentine's Day Club...

573
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:11,730
...get together to air
their grievances.

574
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,022
Sure.

575
00:35:13,107 --> 00:35:14,358
Yeah. You like Mexican food?

576
00:35:14,566 --> 00:35:17,152
I love Mexican.
In fact, I know a great little place...

577
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:18,445
...that's super-casual.

578
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:21,365
Great! The club needs a hangout.
How's Friday?

579
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:24,201
Friday's great.

580
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:27,705
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

581
00:35:28,414 --> 00:35:30,666
- Okay. See you then.
- Okay. All right. Bye.

582
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,349
So what do you think?

583
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,144
- I like that. That's nice.
- Yeah?

584
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,813
I already have one like this
at home.

585
00:35:53,188 --> 00:35:55,524
Do you really think Reed
will object to this?

586
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,943
Probably not, no.

587
00:35:58,277 --> 00:36:00,517
I don't know, I want this
Valentine's date to be special.

588
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:01,822
I want to wow him.

589
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:04,199
The romance has fizzled
since parenthood.

590
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,243
Yeah, well, I hear
that's pretty common.

591
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:08,912
Yeah. We just need
to reconnect as a couple.

592
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:11,623
But why do you need
a specific day to do that?

593
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:14,293
Same reason
you need birthdays...

594
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:16,837
...anniversaries,
or any special day, really.

595
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,757
I don't know.
A new dress says...

596
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:24,386
..."I'm still in love with you
and I want to look special for you."

597
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,656
And don't tell me you've never
felt that way before.

598
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,766
I have, but we all know
how that panned out.

599
00:36:29,475 --> 00:36:31,226
How're things going
with the new vet?

600
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:33,228
How do you know
about him?

601
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,647
Dad told Mom,
who then told me.

602
00:36:35,898 --> 00:36:37,566
No secret is safe in this family.

603
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:39,693
It's going fine.

604
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:42,529
I really like him.

605
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,575
Enough to invest in a new
Valentine's Day dress?

606
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:47,825
He's just a friend.

607
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,370
"A friend with potential."
I read your column.

608
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,251
Maybe it doesn't hurt
to look.

609
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:04,718
This is gorgeous.
I love the color.

610
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:06,220
It's very Valentine's Day.

611
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:09,598
What if he doesn't ask me?

612
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:13,602
Worst case, you end up
with a gorgeous new dress.

613
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:15,145
Yeah, one that I can't afford.

614
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,275
I don't think the price
is the problem.

615
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:33,287
Okay.

616
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,042
- You want another scone?
- Yeah.

617
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:38,502
Yeah, actually, no.

618
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:40,170
Well, maybe.

619
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,047
Not a trick question.

620
00:37:42,256 --> 00:37:44,133
You know what?
I better not.

621
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:46,093
- I better check on the muffins.
- Okay.

622
00:37:50,722 --> 00:37:53,183
So how's Brendan?

623
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:54,601
He's okay. He's...

624
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,210
I don't mean to put you
on the spot.

625
00:37:56,353 --> 00:37:59,106
Was the whole, you know
Valentine's Day thing just a little, like...

626
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:00,607
...overboard?

627
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,152
- You should talk to him.
- You think?

628
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,029
Yeah. Yeah, no. Definitely.
Definitely. Definitely.

629
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:11,618
Stop talking about the scones.
Tell her how you feel.

630
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:13,821
- It's that obvious?
- Yeah...

631
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:15,330
...it is to me, maybe not Pru.

632
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:28,239
- You want another scone?
- I don't want to talk about scones.

633
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,803
I thought you liked them?

634
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:31,847
I do, I just don't want
to discuss it.

635
00:38:32,097 --> 00:38:33,097
Okay.

636
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,809
You have some flour
on your cheek.

637
00:38:36,143 --> 00:38:37,227
No. The other one.

638
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:40,689
Professional hazard.

639
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,611
Your hair looks
really good that way.

640
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:47,099
It looks the way
it always does.

641
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:51,867
You look great in that color.
Great!

642
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:56,038
It's the uniform.
It's not exactly my best look.

643
00:38:57,581 --> 00:38:59,791
- I better get to work.
- Have a nice day.

644
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:06,506
I think he likes you.

645
00:39:06,924 --> 00:39:08,164
I don't know what his story is.

646
00:39:08,342 --> 00:39:09,384
Yes, you do!

647
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:11,220
I have a policy.
I don't date customers.

648
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,763
Since when?

649
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:14,491
Since the last time
I dated a customer.

650
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,975
Okay, but Kit's different.
He doesn't have tattoos.

651
00:39:17,476 --> 00:39:18,977
You wanna know my life plan?

652
00:39:19,436 --> 00:39:21,556
Pay the mortgage off my house,
keep this place afloat.

653
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,315
I don't have time
for a broken heart.

654
00:39:23,523 --> 00:39:25,123
Who says he's gonna break
your heart?

655
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,767
Says the girl who's still pining
over Kit's best friend.

656
00:39:27,903 --> 00:39:31,448
I'm not "pining," okay?
I am confused.

657
00:39:31,698 --> 00:39:34,034
Yeah, well, I don't have time
for that kind of confusion.

658
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,749
Why don't you come over
for dinner tonight?

659
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:43,085
I can't. I'm having dinner
with the vet.

660
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:46,964
Brendan. I think it's time
you knew his name.

661
00:39:47,172 --> 00:39:48,465
I already like this guy.

662
00:39:48,757 --> 00:39:50,217
But I can come over
later this week.

663
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,445
Maybe bring you some food,
give you a break from cooking.

664
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:54,763
Only if you bring Brendan.
I want to meet him!

665
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,473
I think it's a little soon
for that.

666
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,976
Is that wisdom,
or fear talking?

667
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:01,769
- Both!
- Both!

668
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,149
That's cute!

669
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:12,114
When it comes to fashion,
I've learned that...

670
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:15,659
...second-guessing what might
interest someone else is foolish.

671
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:18,578
Sure, sometimes
it's fun to experiment...

672
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:21,290
...but in the end, I just
try to be true to myself.

673
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,084
Why do women
go to so much trouble?

674
00:40:24,835 --> 00:40:26,753
It's a date, not an audition.

675
00:40:27,254 --> 00:40:31,049
Be who you are, not who you
imagine he wants you to be.

676
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:34,261
If you want your "friend"
to turn into more...

677
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,847
...focus on the conversation,
not on the outfit.

678
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:38,097
Goodnight.

679
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:41,143
We know he's attracted to you,
or you wouldn't have a date.

680
00:40:54,531 --> 00:40:56,575
This is unbelievable.

681
00:40:56,783 --> 00:40:58,452
Yep. Thought you
might like it.

682
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,537
How do I not know
about this place?

683
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:02,186
Because Roy
doesn't want you to know.

684
00:41:02,664 --> 00:41:04,100
I wrote a column
about this place, and...

685
00:41:04,124 --> 00:41:06,060
...he sent me a letter
telling me to cease and desist.

686
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:07,084
Why?

687
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:08,587
Because more people means...

688
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:10,755
...more work for him.
He's gonna have to expand...

689
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:12,174
...and he blames me for that.

690
00:41:12,758 --> 00:41:13,758
Avery!

691
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:16,595
Hey, Roy. I want you to meet
my friend, Brendan.

692
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:18,055
- Brendan!
- Roy.

693
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:19,305
So how're you doing?

694
00:41:19,473 --> 00:41:21,433
My feet are swollen,
my back hurts, and...

695
00:41:21,516 --> 00:41:23,602
...I'm making
a whole lot of money.

696
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:28,523
So, to celebrate my misfortune,
I'm throwing a party on Valentine's Day.

697
00:41:28,774 --> 00:41:30,567
8:00 to 12:00 dinner
and dancing.

698
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,737
You're invited.
Of course, with a friend.

699
00:41:33,987 --> 00:41:37,074
Roy, you do not seem like type of
guy who'd be into Valentine's Day.

700
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:41,703
I proposed to my Angela
on Valentine's Day...

701
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:44,081
...and I married her
exactly one year later.

702
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:45,624
It's been almost 30 years.

703
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:47,876
Valentine's Day
is my anniversary.

704
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:50,629
And there she is.

705
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:52,839
Have a wonderful evening.

706
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:58,470
I grew up on Mexican food.

707
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:01,390
Well, frozen burritos.

708
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:03,892
Why frozen?

709
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,104
My mom worked long hours.

710
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:11,149
My parents got married
way too fast.

711
00:42:11,817 --> 00:42:15,237
A couple strangers have a couple
kids divorce is inevitable.

712
00:42:16,947 --> 00:42:17,947
I'm sorry.

713
00:42:18,782 --> 00:42:20,992
I'm not jaded by nature...

714
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,370
...it's just that Valentine's Day
always seems to...

715
00:42:23,578 --> 00:42:25,705
...remind me of all the things
that can go wrong.

716
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:31,294
I'm doing all the talking here.

717
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:34,464
Now, what is the story,
the real story...

718
00:42:34,756 --> 00:42:36,842
...with you and
the dreaded holiday?

719
00:42:37,884 --> 00:42:39,052
Real story?

720
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:43,974
A really, really,
really bad break-up.

721
00:42:45,684 --> 00:42:48,645
And I got him a watch, which
I promptly gave to Goodwill...

722
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:51,481
...so there's some guy out there
walking around with a watch...

723
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:54,192
...that says, "Happy
Valentine's Day. Love Avery."

724
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:56,611
That's what my watch says.

725
00:42:57,737 --> 00:42:58,780
Crazy!

726
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:03,994
Well, the food's pretty good,
and so is the company.

727
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:06,171
I don't want to get
kicked out of the club...

728
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:09,833
...but how would you feel about
coming here on Valentine's Day?

729
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:12,711
I think that I could
probably handle it.

730
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:13,962
Yeah?

731
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:16,631
So it's a non-date?

732
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,718
- Right.
- All right.

733
00:43:26,683 --> 00:43:29,644
Listen, Avery, there's something
I should tell you.

734
00:43:30,854 --> 00:43:31,938
What?

735
00:43:32,898 --> 00:43:34,983
And it's best
that I just tell you now...

736
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:38,778
...get it out of the way.
I don't want it to come between us.

737
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,824
Okay.

738
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:46,745
I am a horrible dancer.

739
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:49,372
No rhythm.

740
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:51,625
No coordination. I have
stepped on many a toe.

741
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,668
It's okay, I am not much
of a dancer myself.

742
00:43:53,877 --> 00:43:55,277
Then we'll just sit
on the sideline?

743
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:57,464
- Yes. Absolutely. Of course.
- Thank you.

744
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:59,883
Although, you know,
I did see something online.

745
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:01,801
"Learn to dance by
Valentine's Day."

746
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:03,929
It's at one of the dance
studios downtown.

747
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,306
Could be fun?

748
00:44:06,598 --> 00:44:07,974
I'm game, if you are.

749
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:11,937
- Yeah.
- All right.

750
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:21,279
Happy comes at a price.

751
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,490
If he can make me feel
this good...

752
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:26,868
...he can make me feel
just as bad.

753
00:44:28,286 --> 00:44:30,497
I have a date
for Valentine's Day.

754
00:44:31,665 --> 00:44:34,334
But what if he hadn't asked?
I'd be miserable.

755
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,756
Although I'd never admit it,
not even to myself.

756
00:44:48,431 --> 00:44:49,933
You asked if I was involved.

757
00:44:50,183 --> 00:44:51,893
I met someone I really like...

758
00:44:52,102 --> 00:44:55,772
...and she doesn't need any Valentine's
Day validation to feel worthwhile.

759
00:44:56,314 --> 00:44:57,732
You could learn a lot
from her.

760
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:05,740
Leave it to you to ruin
a perfectly good night.

761
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:12,664
- This is fantastic!
- What is?

762
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:16,251
Bench's response to the column.
There's hundreds of comments here.

763
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:17,752
Really?

764
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:19,296
Yeah. They're not all fans.

765
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:21,881
- Some of them agree with Bench.
- You can't be serious.

766
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:23,675
He's bringing in
a male readership.

767
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:29,055
There's a real "He Said/She Said"
thing going on. Great reading.

768
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:29,973
Great.

769
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:32,618
So I suppose you want me to push
back, keep boosting the numbers.

770
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,162
We're gonna do
much more than that.

771
00:45:35,353 --> 00:45:37,188
- We are?
- Yeah, you drop by my office.

772
00:45:37,397 --> 00:45:38,481
I'll tell you my idea.

773
00:45:40,775 --> 00:45:42,068
How do I get rid of this guy?

774
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:14,851
You have company.

775
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,356
- Good morning.
- Hey, Pru.

776
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:23,401
Hello.

777
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,986
Hey. You got a minute?

778
00:46:26,237 --> 00:46:29,282
I was hoping that
we could bury the hatchet.

779
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:31,660
Okay.

780
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:36,456
So, how are you doing?

781
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:39,376
I'm okay.

782
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:44,130
Listen. I've been
thinking about us.

783
00:46:44,422 --> 00:46:47,842
Maybe it was a mistake,
writing to "Consult The Coach."

784
00:46:48,176 --> 00:46:52,889
"Coach" is not really qualified
to give advice.

785
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:54,974
You've been reading
her column?

786
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,186
As a matter of fact,
I have.

787
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:00,939
Someone's been giving her
a lot of grief...

788
00:47:01,147 --> 00:47:02,816
...and it's given me
second thoughts.

789
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:07,737
"Bench The Coach" is me.

790
00:47:08,613 --> 00:47:09,072
What?

791
00:47:09,322 --> 00:47:10,907
Maybe I overreacted...

792
00:47:11,157 --> 00:47:14,285
...but what she said,
she's never even met me.

793
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:18,498
Do you want coffee
or something?

794
00:47:18,998 --> 00:47:20,166
I should get going.

795
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,293
I'm glad you stopped by.

796
00:47:26,715 --> 00:47:27,799
Brendan?

797
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:33,179
I'm sorry if I went overboard...

798
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:36,599
...with the Valentine's.
It's just...

799
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:39,686
...I love romance, and...

800
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:42,439
...Valentine's Day is really
important to me.

801
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:43,898
I understand.

802
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:46,609
Maybe we could do something...

803
00:47:47,444 --> 00:47:49,070
...you know, low-key?

804
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,406
Dinner and a movie,
no big deal.

805
00:47:51,656 --> 00:47:53,950
McKenna, I am sorry,
I can't.

806
00:47:56,327 --> 00:47:57,704
Can I ask why?

807
00:47:58,955 --> 00:48:00,623
I'm going to a party.

808
00:48:03,209 --> 00:48:05,378
You have a date
for Valentine's Day?

809
00:48:05,837 --> 00:48:08,882
It just kind of happened.
I met Avery after you...

810
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,550
I hope you two
have a lovely night.

811
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:12,510
McKenna.

812
00:48:24,105 --> 00:48:25,190
You want me to what?

813
00:48:25,398 --> 00:48:28,485
Pull back the curtains. Let people
know who the Coach really is.

814
00:48:28,693 --> 00:48:29,486
What would be the point?

815
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:31,237
Force "Bench" to reveal
who he is.

816
00:48:31,446 --> 00:48:32,686
I couldn't care less
who he is.

817
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:33,902
Here's what I'm thinking...

818
00:48:34,115 --> 00:48:35,575
...an event to generate buzz.

819
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,827
"The gloves are off
and now the masks."

820
00:48:38,036 --> 00:48:39,704
My mask is staying
right where it is.

821
00:48:41,873 --> 00:48:44,709
Stop raining on your own
parade and hear me out.

822
00:48:45,627 --> 00:48:48,254
We build it up, and then
the day before Valentine's Day...

823
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,548
...we reveal the identity
of the Coach...

824
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:53,176
...and then we challenge Bench
to do the same.

825
00:48:53,885 --> 00:48:59,224
And then you want us to, what, box?
Wrestle? Cage-fight?

826
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,599
Debate.

827
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:02,310
I want you to debate
your brains out.

828
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:03,645
Think of the publicity!

829
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:06,689
You'll do interviews. Your phone
will be ringing off the hook.

830
00:49:06,898 --> 00:49:08,178
I don't have a phone
with a hook.

831
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:11,236
And Bench might not even show
which means you would win by default.

832
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:14,197
Look the problem is. I like the fact
that the Coach is anonymous.

833
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:18,159
Do you know why your column
is so popular?

834
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:20,912
It's because you write
about your feelings.

835
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,414
It's time for you
to stop hiding.

836
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,889
There's no such thing
as "I can't dance."

837
00:49:40,348 --> 00:49:41,975
It just takes practice.

838
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:43,977
Okay.

839
00:49:46,771 --> 00:49:49,148
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

840
00:49:49,357 --> 00:49:51,359
No, my fault. It's okay.

841
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:00,785
I am a disaster.

842
00:50:02,203 --> 00:50:03,830
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

843
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:05,540
You just might have
to carry me home.

844
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,417
- Okay.
- You mustn't give up.

845
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:09,460
Let's try something
a little slower.

846
00:50:11,379 --> 00:50:13,673
Give your feet time
to catch up with your heart.

847
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:14,882
All right.

848
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:17,802
Now hold your partner close.

849
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:21,055
Closer.

850
00:50:22,724 --> 00:50:25,435
Now look into her eyes.

851
00:50:28,771 --> 00:50:31,316
Surrender to the moment
and the music.

852
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,901
There's never been anybody
I couldn't teach!

853
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:31,584
Look at them.

854
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,296
They've been together so long,
and they are still holding hands.

855
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,923
Yeah.

856
00:51:38,508 --> 00:51:41,844
All those years of loving each other,
and fighting and making up.

857
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:44,180
Hanging in
when the going gets tough.

858
00:51:53,564 --> 00:51:55,775
The past doesn't have
to define the future.

859
00:51:58,111 --> 00:51:59,612
I wrote that once.

860
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:02,532
Not sure that I believed it then.

861
00:52:03,282 --> 00:52:04,409
You believe it now?

862
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:07,704
I want to.

863
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:13,418
I mean that's what everybody dreams
of when they're younger, right?

864
00:52:14,752 --> 00:52:16,796
A love that stands
the test of time.

865
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:24,929
Valentine's Day
came early this year.

866
00:52:27,265 --> 00:52:28,725
I think I have a boyfriend.

867
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,411
Look at you, getting
all serious and fit.

868
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:50,079
I've already lost five pounds.

869
00:52:50,288 --> 00:52:52,688
You're not gonna be the only
veterinary stud in neighborhood.

870
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:55,084
- How often are you running?
- Every day.

871
00:52:55,626 --> 00:52:58,755
Nice. What inspired
this transformation?

872
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:02,383
I just want to get in shape.
You know lose the love handles, work...

873
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:04,010
...the cardio,
live a little longer.

874
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:05,219
Who is she?

875
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:08,889
It's Pru.

876
00:53:09,057 --> 00:53:10,641
And why haven't you
asked her out yet?

877
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,202
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

878
00:53:12,226 --> 00:53:14,395
You have literally had
hundreds of moments.

879
00:53:14,604 --> 00:53:15,644
You're in there every day.

880
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,770
All right, the right words then.
The right wardrobe.

881
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:19,015
It would help if I was taller.

882
00:53:19,442 --> 00:53:20,961
You just gotta get out
of your comfort zone.

883
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:23,130
I stepped out of mine with Avery,
and I couldn't be happier.

884
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:25,990
I don't have a comfort zone.
I have varying degrees of anxiety.

885
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,705
Avery and I made a date
for Valentine's Day.

886
00:53:34,373 --> 00:53:36,626
- You're really taking the plunge.
- I like her a lot.

887
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:40,797
I just can't help thinking
what if it doesn't work out?

888
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:43,883
What's the worst
that could happen?

889
00:53:58,606 --> 00:53:59,857
I need you to do something.

890
00:54:12,078 --> 00:54:13,246
Hi, McKenna.

891
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:15,414
How come you didn't tell me
about Brendan?

892
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:18,126
Tell you what about Brendan?

893
00:54:18,334 --> 00:54:20,169
That he was dating
somebody new.

894
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:21,712
Ava...

895
00:54:22,755 --> 00:54:24,590
- Emory.
- Avery. Avery Parker?

896
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:25,925
What's she like?

897
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:28,859
I don't know her that well. She
brought her dog in a couple times.

898
00:54:28,928 --> 00:54:30,346
- Is it serious?
- The dog is fine.

899
00:54:30,555 --> 00:54:31,597
You know what I mean.

900
00:54:33,224 --> 00:54:34,433
You should talk
to Brendan.

901
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:46,404
You know what?
I'm gonna go.

902
00:54:52,577 --> 00:54:54,787
If you wait too long,
you're gonna lose him.

903
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:57,290
He makes me nervous.
I hate that feeling.

904
00:54:57,498 --> 00:54:59,000
I think that means
that you like him.

905
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:01,252
No it means
we need to drop it.

906
00:55:02,378 --> 00:55:03,838
Okay, you made your point.

907
00:55:05,298 --> 00:55:06,841
Tell me this isn't an omen.

908
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:09,886
The omen
needs more cinnamon.

909
00:55:10,928 --> 00:55:12,346
I'll bake another batch.

910
00:55:18,477 --> 00:55:20,730
- Thanks for bringing dinner.
- Of course!

911
00:55:21,189 --> 00:55:22,732
Anything to avoid writing.

912
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,400
Why do you want
to avoid writing?

913
00:55:25,151 --> 00:55:27,337
Because you're not considered
a real writer if you don't.

914
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:28,696
I'm a real writer.

915
00:55:28,988 --> 00:55:30,072
Is that so?

916
00:55:30,281 --> 00:55:32,074
Wanna see what I wrote
to Josie?

917
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:33,409
I sure do.

918
00:55:37,747 --> 00:55:40,124
Wait till you see this.
It is so sweet.

919
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,919
And Reed said he's gonna be late,
so we should start without him.

920
00:55:43,127 --> 00:55:44,378
Aunt Avery.

921
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:49,175
That's so pretty.

922
00:55:49,383 --> 00:55:51,219
Thanks. Read it!

923
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:53,554
Hey. Why don't you read it?

924
00:55:53,763 --> 00:55:55,681
It's always better
in the author's own voice.

925
00:55:56,515 --> 00:55:58,935
"Dear Josie, I am glad
you are my friend.

926
00:55:59,185 --> 00:56:01,687
I like how you laugh and
you are really good at math.

927
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:04,440
You also have
very pretty hair."

928
00:56:04,732 --> 00:56:07,610
She has very pretty red hair,
like yours.

929
00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:09,874
Girls love it when you say
stuff like that.

930
00:56:10,196 --> 00:56:13,282
"I hope you have
a Happy Valentine's Day...

931
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:17,578
...and I hope you like this card
as much as I like you."

932
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:21,916
I think she's gonna love it.

933
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:25,836
I wish I could be as honest
in my writing.

934
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:30,341
- Thanks.
- All right.

935
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:32,093
- Go wash up for dinner.
- Okay.

936
00:56:36,514 --> 00:56:39,308
I think your writing is very
honest, especially lately.

937
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:40,726
You sound like my editor.

938
00:56:40,935 --> 00:56:41,935
Maybe it's Brendan.

939
00:56:42,103 --> 00:56:43,783
This new romance has
given you more daring.

940
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,523
Okay, I wouldn't call it
a romance.

941
00:56:45,773 --> 00:56:46,773
Not yet.

942
00:56:46,857 --> 00:56:48,497
Why don't you invite him
to Mom's potluck?

943
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:50,861
No! It is way too early for him
to meet my family.

944
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,906
Mention it as a casual
off-the-cuff thing, and then...

945
00:56:54,282 --> 00:56:55,922
...ask him how many kids
he wants to have.

946
00:56:55,992 --> 00:56:57,535
Who are you talking about?

947
00:56:57,868 --> 00:57:00,037
- Aunt Avery's new boyfriend.
- Enough!

948
00:57:00,246 --> 00:57:01,664
What'll I wear
to the wedding?

949
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:08,087
This place
is a dog's paradise.

950
00:57:08,296 --> 00:57:09,338
This place is beautiful.

951
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:12,133
We come here every weekend.
It's a trek, but it's worth it.

952
00:57:12,508 --> 00:57:14,885
Do you notice who he's been
spending a lot more time with?

953
00:57:15,511 --> 00:57:17,388
Seriously.
Are you gonna go there?

954
00:57:17,596 --> 00:57:19,098
- I'm just saying.
- Come on.

955
00:57:20,266 --> 00:57:22,727
No, no, we both know
who has his heart.

956
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:25,646
Well, I'm glad you're
giving up on that easily.

957
00:57:25,896 --> 00:57:28,357
It's just as well. I don't want
to confuse the little guy.

958
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:34,113
Before he took off, my dad used to
take me hiking at a place almost...

959
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:35,781
...as beautiful as this.

960
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:38,909
I can't imagine
how rough that was.

961
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:41,996
Do you wanna go to dinner
tomorrow night?

962
00:57:42,413 --> 00:57:44,206
We could go back
to El Adobe.

963
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:47,001
I would love to,
but I've got a...

964
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:49,670
...potluck at my Mom's house.
It's kind of a tradition.

965
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:51,172
No problem.

966
00:57:52,882 --> 00:57:54,091
You want to come?

967
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,553
You know what?
It's okay.

968
00:57:57,803 --> 00:58:00,556
My family can be really
overwhelming. It would be a lot...

969
00:58:00,765 --> 00:58:02,683
What does one bring
to a potluck?

970
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:05,770
Well, "Honorary Parkers"
don't bring anything.

971
00:58:06,437 --> 00:58:08,481
That's what my mom
calls a guest.

972
00:58:08,898 --> 00:58:12,360
I'm okay with that handle,
but I do want to bring something.

973
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:18,908
Seriously?

974
00:58:19,283 --> 00:58:21,702
The Anti-Valentiners are
challenged around every turn.

975
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:24,080
There hearts are
becoming unavoidable.

976
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,999
I'm not as "anti"
as I used to be.

977
00:58:30,169 --> 00:58:32,755
I'd hate to disband
the club, but...

978
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,341
...sometimes, you just
got to go with the flow.

979
00:58:55,403 --> 00:58:56,612
What's the matter with you?

980
00:58:57,613 --> 00:58:59,657
Bench the Coach
wrote a comment.

981
00:58:59,865 --> 00:59:02,910
I think it's a little too harsh.
I'm trying to unsend it.

982
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:06,080
You do realize that you and
Bench are the same guy, right?

983
00:59:06,497 --> 00:59:08,833
We seem to be diverging.

984
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:11,752
I'm not as critical.
Not anymore.

985
00:59:13,045 --> 00:59:14,130
Why?
What'd you write?

986
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:17,466
A snarky one-liner
about her corny taste in music.

987
00:59:18,384 --> 00:59:19,677
I think she'll survive.

988
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,265
She's probably just some lonely
soul with no one in her life.

989
00:59:24,974 --> 00:59:27,685
Except for Bench. Maybe
that's why she's responding.

990
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:29,854
You wanna grab some lunch?

991
00:59:30,062 --> 00:59:32,815
Let's go to the deli. I have
to get potato salad, a lot of it.

992
00:59:33,232 --> 00:59:34,775
Okay.
How much do you want?

993
00:59:34,984 --> 00:59:36,944
Enough to feed
six to eight people.

994
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:38,404
You are hungry.

995
00:59:38,612 --> 00:59:39,864
It's not all for me.

996
00:59:40,114 --> 00:59:41,907
Avery invited me to dinner
with her family.

997
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:45,035
You could barely handle Valentine's Day,
now you're meeting the family?

998
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:47,329
It's no big deal.
I asked her to dinner...

999
00:59:47,538 --> 00:59:49,540
...she was going to her mom's
and invited me along.

1000
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,834
Right. Right.

1001
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:55,171
Well, don't make yourself nuts.
It's just a meal.

1002
00:59:56,088 --> 00:59:57,214
With her family.

1003
00:59:59,175 --> 01:00:00,509
When are you gonna
ask Pru out?

1004
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,261
- Soon.
- Great!

1005
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:05,306
- Someday.
- Good.

1006
01:00:05,556 --> 01:00:07,475
You know. I don't know.

1007
01:00:08,434 --> 01:00:09,685
She might turn me down.

1008
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:11,896
There's only one way
to find out.

1009
01:00:13,647 --> 01:00:14,690
Right.

1010
01:00:17,902 --> 01:00:21,030
It's no secret to my readers that
I wasn't a fan of Valentine's Day.

1011
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,742
But once
I started writing about it...

1012
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:27,077
...my attitude changed.

1013
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,664
Valentine's Day is a way to
celebrate the relationships...

1014
01:00:30,915 --> 01:00:32,416
...that give our lives meaning.

1015
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,836
Something "Bench The Coach"
doesn't seem to understand.

1016
01:00:36,253 --> 01:00:37,296
He's trying!

1017
01:00:37,796 --> 01:00:39,798
So it's time to call him out.

1018
01:00:40,508 --> 01:00:43,719
This Thursday at 3:00,
I'll be at The Portland Banner.

1019
01:00:44,386 --> 01:00:46,180
Come meet the person
you've been attacking.

1020
01:00:49,517 --> 01:00:52,978
"Attacking" may be a bit strong,
but consider me called out.

1021
01:00:54,813 --> 01:00:55,898
All right, buddy!

1022
01:00:58,484 --> 01:01:00,402
I was in vet school
and my landlady...

1023
01:01:00,611 --> 01:01:02,988
...pounds on the door.
Her cat had swallowed an earring.

1024
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:05,032
So I retrieve the earring,
save the cat.

1025
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:06,617
She was so grateful...

1026
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:08,244
...she let me live there
rent-free.

1027
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:10,579
I was able to pay off
my student loans. That cat...

1028
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:11,872
...paid for my education.

1029
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:15,793
Maybe I'll be a vet when I grow up.
Or a writer. Or a fireman.

1030
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:18,379
They say kids your age
will live to be a hundred so...

1031
01:01:18,629 --> 01:01:20,339
...maybe you'll have time
to be all three.

1032
01:01:20,548 --> 01:01:22,007
Do you still live
in that apartment?

1033
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:25,678
I finally got a house and then
I got a cat to remind me I'm home.

1034
01:01:26,804 --> 01:01:28,347
How many kids
do you wanna have?

1035
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,016
A dozen, at least.

1036
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:32,977
When are you guys
getting married?

1037
01:01:33,185 --> 01:01:34,853
Okay! Sweetie.

1038
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:36,636
Brendan and I
are just friends.

1039
01:01:36,689 --> 01:01:39,483
But my mom needs to know
what to wear to the wedding.

1040
01:01:39,817 --> 01:01:40,985
Okay!

1041
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:43,153
I'm so glad you could meet
my family.

1042
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:44,488
So am I.

1043
01:01:44,738 --> 01:01:45,858
Dinner was great.
Thank you.

1044
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:47,908
Wanna see
my grandma's new canary?

1045
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:49,910
I thought
you would never ask!

1046
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:57,876
- Well, we know he likes kids.
- He's wonderful, Avery.

1047
01:01:58,127 --> 01:01:58,836
I agree.

1048
01:01:59,086 --> 01:02:01,206
I'd like him much better
if he wasn't so good-looking.

1049
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:02,498
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

1050
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:04,800
Why don't you invite him
to the face-off with Bench?

1051
01:02:05,009 --> 01:02:06,635
The canary is sleeping.

1052
01:02:06,844 --> 01:02:09,221
- I'll meet him next time.
- Who wants chocolate?

1053
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:12,349
Oh, 'tis the season.

1054
01:02:12,558 --> 01:02:13,767
It certainly is.

1055
01:02:13,976 --> 01:02:15,616
Brendan, how do you feel
about basketball?

1056
01:02:15,853 --> 01:02:16,395
Great!

1057
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:18,939
I got a big-screen TV
and a comfortable couch.

1058
01:02:20,816 --> 01:02:23,027
I like your friend,
Aunt Avery.

1059
01:02:23,694 --> 01:02:24,778
So do I.

1060
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:45,341
Brendan?
You okay?

1061
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:49,553
I'm going out
for an hour or so.

1062
01:02:50,721 --> 01:02:52,640
Okay.
Where you going?

1063
01:02:53,307 --> 01:02:54,558
There's this...

1064
01:02:55,768 --> 01:02:57,728
...thing I have to go to.

1065
01:03:00,397 --> 01:03:02,191
"Consult the Coach"
called me out.

1066
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:05,861
You're gonna go confront her?
Brendan, don't do it.

1067
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,446
You don't understand.

1068
01:03:07,655 --> 01:03:09,114
Look, whoever she is,
she means well.

1069
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:10,991
Hey,
I'm through fighting.

1070
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:13,410
She was right
about McKenna and me.

1071
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:15,746
And she was right
about Valentine's Day.

1072
01:03:16,955 --> 01:03:18,515
What brought about
this change of heart?

1073
01:03:19,249 --> 01:03:20,249
Avery.

1074
01:03:21,168 --> 01:03:22,753
I had a really good time
last night.

1075
01:03:23,128 --> 01:03:24,688
It was a little weird
when her nephew...

1076
01:03:24,797 --> 01:03:26,441
...demanded to know
what my intentions are...

1077
01:03:26,465 --> 01:03:28,884
...but I haven't laughed
like that in a long time.

1078
01:03:29,093 --> 01:03:30,093
See?

1079
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,580
You're in a good place
right now.

1080
01:03:31,804 --> 01:03:33,847
So why go to this showdown
with the Coach?

1081
01:03:35,057 --> 01:03:36,850
I want to apologize to her.

1082
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:42,231
All right, good for you.

1083
01:03:46,443 --> 01:03:47,778
Good for you!

1084
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:56,495
Is this really necessary?

1085
01:03:56,704 --> 01:03:59,790
We want the world's first
glimpse of you to dazzle.

1086
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:03,210
Has there been any
follow-up from Bench?

1087
01:04:04,253 --> 01:04:05,713
- Nope.
- Good.

1088
01:04:05,921 --> 01:04:07,297
Maybe he won't show.

1089
01:04:07,673 --> 01:04:10,801
Well, he better. Showtime.

1090
01:04:23,647 --> 01:04:25,232
Brendan? Hi.

1091
01:04:25,482 --> 01:04:26,859
Hey!
What are you doing here?

1092
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:28,861
- Like we'd miss this.
- You...

1093
01:04:29,069 --> 01:04:31,196
- ...fans of the Coach?
- Imagine that.

1094
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:40,539
There!

1095
01:04:47,755 --> 01:04:49,631
Welcome
to The Portland Banner.

1096
01:04:49,965 --> 01:04:52,509
I'm Lauren Port,
the Executive Editor.

1097
01:04:56,722 --> 01:05:00,601
"Consult The Coach" is one
of our most popular columns...

1098
01:05:01,393 --> 01:05:04,438
...and its author has always
been anonymous...

1099
01:05:04,646 --> 01:05:06,899
...but today,
all that changes.

1100
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:11,445
It's time to put a name
and a face to the column.

1101
01:05:12,154 --> 01:05:15,199
I would like to introduce you
to the real "Coach."

1102
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:19,203
Please,
say hello to Avery Parker!

1103
01:05:22,831 --> 01:05:24,041
Hi.

1104
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:27,169
Thank you all
for coming.

1105
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,924
I have to admit,
this was not my idea.

1106
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:35,219
There's a comfort
in being anonymous, and...

1107
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:39,097
...this is a little bit scary
for me but...

1108
01:05:40,057 --> 01:05:42,059
...I'm proud of the column and...

1109
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:44,144
...I'm really honored
that I get to write it.

1110
01:05:44,603 --> 01:05:48,315
And I know that you're not
all here just to see me.

1111
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:50,993
There's somebody else
you would like to meet.

1112
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:54,530
So here I am, "Bench."

1113
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:58,575
Time to show your face.

1114
01:06:15,551 --> 01:06:17,302
Too bad the big bad "Bench"
didn't show.

1115
01:06:17,511 --> 01:06:19,972
But Brendan did!
Wasn't that sweet?

1116
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:22,182
- Brendan?
- Yeah, where'd he go?

1117
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:25,310
- Wait. He was here?
- Didn't you see him?

1118
01:06:25,644 --> 01:06:27,563
No. How would he even
know about this?

1119
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:29,773
Maybe he heard us
talking about it last night.

1120
01:06:30,983 --> 01:06:31,983
Maybe.

1121
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:39,658
The real "Coach." Please,
say hello to Avery Parker!

1122
01:06:41,827 --> 01:06:42,870
Hi.

1123
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:45,163
What are you watching?

1124
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:48,667
"Consult The Coach."
They revealed her identity today.

1125
01:06:48,876 --> 01:06:50,294
Right. Was it even a woman?

1126
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:53,255
Yeah.
Her name is Avery Parker.

1127
01:06:53,463 --> 01:06:54,823
Why does that name
sound familiar?

1128
01:06:55,424 --> 01:06:57,926
Did she and "Bench The Coach"
have their epic smackdown?

1129
01:06:58,218 --> 01:06:59,720
No. He
didn't show.

1130
01:07:00,846 --> 01:07:02,014
What's the problem?

1131
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:05,934
Avery Parker is
Brendan's new girlfriend.

1132
01:07:07,311 --> 01:07:08,395
I don't get it.

1133
01:07:10,856 --> 01:07:12,024
Neither do I.

1134
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:16,028
I am glad people know
who you are now.

1135
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:18,405
Your columns have
become very special.

1136
01:07:18,822 --> 01:07:20,407
Well, I think there's
a reason for that.

1137
01:07:20,657 --> 01:07:21,657
Besides my mentoring?

1138
01:07:21,825 --> 01:07:23,185
No, in addition
to your mentoring.

1139
01:07:24,411 --> 01:07:26,651
Writing this column has actually
been really good for me.

1140
01:07:26,705 --> 01:07:28,206
I'm starting to believe
in love again.

1141
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:30,459
And I met a guy.

1142
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,962
He's honest
and he's kind, and...

1143
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:36,465
...charming, and I trust him.

1144
01:07:37,758 --> 01:07:39,092
That's a huge step for me.

1145
01:07:39,509 --> 01:07:41,261
First step to genuine happiness.

1146
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,390
I'm glad you found someone
that you can count on.

1147
01:07:44,681 --> 01:07:46,266
I mean
what are the chances?

1148
01:07:46,725 --> 01:07:48,018
Well,
what did you say to her?

1149
01:07:48,226 --> 01:07:49,519
Nothing. I left.

1150
01:07:50,479 --> 01:07:52,856
- So, wait. She doesn't know?
- No, not yet.

1151
01:07:53,065 --> 01:07:54,825
Look, Brendan. Brendan.
You have to tell her.

1152
01:07:54,858 --> 01:07:55,943
And say what?

1153
01:07:56,526 --> 01:07:57,778
This is a disaster.

1154
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:01,949
- It's Avery.
- Talk to her.

1155
01:08:05,953 --> 01:08:07,204
Avery. Hi.

1156
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:10,207
Mom and Hannah said you were
here today, at the paper.

1157
01:08:10,415 --> 01:08:12,918
I'm sorry I couldn't stay.
We had an emergency.

1158
01:08:13,168 --> 01:08:16,922
A German shepherd
with a fractured femur.

1159
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:20,550
Is everything okay?

1160
01:08:21,051 --> 01:08:22,094
Sure.

1161
01:08:23,053 --> 01:08:24,137
You sound funny.

1162
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:26,223
It was a tricky procedure.

1163
01:08:28,558 --> 01:08:30,852
Well, I was thinking
of going to El Adobe...

1164
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,247
...to celebrate my big reveal,
and I thought it would be nice...

1165
01:08:33,271 --> 01:08:34,271
...if you could join me.

1166
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:38,110
That's a good idea.
It'll give us a chance to talk.

1167
01:08:40,237 --> 01:08:42,739
- 7:30?
- See you then.

1168
01:08:43,407 --> 01:08:44,533
Great.

1169
01:08:50,414 --> 01:08:51,665
You have to tell her.

1170
01:08:52,374 --> 01:08:53,374
I will.

1171
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,168
I just have to figure out how.

1172
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:06,388
Excuse me.
Are you Avery Parker?

1173
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,723
That's right.

1174
01:09:08,265 --> 01:09:11,476
I tried to call,
but I couldn't get through.

1175
01:09:12,644 --> 01:09:14,229
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

1176
01:09:14,896 --> 01:09:16,189
I read your column.

1177
01:09:16,398 --> 01:09:19,234
And you do know me,
I mean, sort of.

1178
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:21,820
I wrote to you a while ago.

1179
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:23,655
"Should I Move On?"

1180
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:25,990
Oh, right!

1181
01:09:26,116 --> 01:09:28,285
Yeah, I was writing to you
about my boyfriend.

1182
01:09:28,702 --> 01:09:30,120
His name is Brendan Bains.

1183
01:09:31,955 --> 01:09:36,626
You told me that I should move on
and now he's your boyfriend.

1184
01:09:45,469 --> 01:09:47,345
I don't know
what to say right now.

1185
01:09:47,554 --> 01:09:53,894
I'm sorry for just showing up like this.
I'm just really confused.

1186
01:09:56,146 --> 01:09:57,647
I thought you should know.

1187
01:09:58,565 --> 01:09:59,733
What do you mean?

1188
01:10:00,192 --> 01:10:02,110
Brendan
is "Bench the Coach."

1189
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:12,621
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Nessa.

1190
01:10:15,499 --> 01:10:16,499
Hi.

1191
01:10:18,919 --> 01:10:20,759
I thought we were gonna meet
at the restaurant.

1192
01:10:23,673 --> 01:10:24,673
Is it true?

1193
01:10:26,676 --> 01:10:27,886
Are you "Bench The Coach"?

1194
01:10:31,765 --> 01:10:33,225
- Avery.
- Just tell me.

1195
01:10:38,396 --> 01:10:42,567
Yeah. I'm "Bench The Coach."

1196
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:45,987
I mean I was.

1197
01:10:47,155 --> 01:10:48,515
- And I was gonna tell you.
- Yeah.

1198
01:10:48,698 --> 01:10:51,952
I have been wrong about men before,
but I have never been this wrong.

1199
01:10:52,577 --> 01:10:54,538
- Avery, wait.
- All of those things you said...

1200
01:10:54,746 --> 01:10:56,289
I didn't know it was you.

1201
01:10:56,498 --> 01:10:57,978
How am I ever supposed
to believe you.

1202
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:02,796
What can I do?

1203
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:08,260
Forget we met.

1204
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,190
We like to give flowers
on Valentine's Day.

1205
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,360
Flowers are so beautiful
and festive.

1206
01:11:26,236 --> 01:11:28,488
They are the perfect metaphor
for Valentine's Day.

1207
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:31,950
However beautiful the day
may be, it doesn't last.

1208
01:11:32,909 --> 01:11:36,580
Sooner or later, that good feeling
you had on February 14th...

1209
01:11:36,997 --> 01:11:38,665
...withers and dies...

1210
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,293
...just like the flowers.

1211
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:00,937
It's time I told the truth.

1212
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:46,858
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Yeah, you too.

1213
01:12:57,494 --> 01:12:58,662
Happy Valentine's Day.

1214
01:13:00,163 --> 01:13:01,873
Pretty unhappy, if you ask me.

1215
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:04,834
How's Brendan?

1216
01:13:06,127 --> 01:13:08,546
Not so good.
He and Avery split up.

1217
01:13:10,882 --> 01:13:13,927
Yeah, she's not doing so good either,
judging by her column.

1218
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,348
Relationships are impossible.
Why do we all keep trying?

1219
01:13:22,227 --> 01:13:23,728
I went to see Avery.

1220
01:13:25,105 --> 01:13:27,440
I told her that Brendan was
"Bench The Coach."

1221
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:30,235
- You did what?
- I thought that she should know.

1222
01:13:37,117 --> 01:13:38,702
Maybe I made a mistake.
It's...

1223
01:13:42,998 --> 01:13:44,541
I was just jealous.

1224
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:47,460
And he's not even
the right one for me.

1225
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,890
How do you know
when someone's the right one?

1226
01:13:54,592 --> 01:13:56,386
They meet you halfway.

1227
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:19,576
Happy Valentine's Day.

1228
01:14:42,223 --> 01:14:44,142
Dad,
what are you doing here?

1229
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:47,645
Well, I was in the neighborhood,
about to get a cup of coffee, and..

1230
01:14:47,854 --> 01:14:50,774
...then I remembered that you own
a coffeemaker, so I thought...

1231
01:14:50,982 --> 01:14:52,859
...I'd drop over and get
a fresh-brewed cup.

1232
01:14:54,027 --> 01:14:55,236
Is any of that true?

1233
01:14:57,614 --> 01:14:59,449
Your mom told me
about you and Brendan.

1234
01:14:59,657 --> 01:15:00,909
Do we have
to talk about it?

1235
01:15:02,118 --> 01:15:04,037
I only met him once,
but I really liked him.

1236
01:15:04,829 --> 01:15:06,869
Yeah, well, the man you met
wasn't the real Brendan.

1237
01:15:06,956 --> 01:15:08,375
And "Bench The Coach" is?

1238
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:10,460
The problem is,
I have no idea who he is.

1239
01:15:10,877 --> 01:15:13,171
Maybe you're just scared,
and this is an excuse.

1240
01:15:15,006 --> 01:15:16,341
All I know is...

1241
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,637
...the guy I met couldn't take his eyes
off you, laughed at all your jokes.

1242
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,263
That was a guy in love.

1243
01:15:26,351 --> 01:15:28,186
That's a nice try, Dad, but...

1244
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:32,649
...I don't think Valentine's Day
is ever gonna be my day.

1245
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,068
I'm sorry to hear that...

1246
01:15:35,318 --> 01:15:36,778
...but give the rest of us
a break...

1247
01:15:36,986 --> 01:15:39,030
...'cause today's column
was a real downer.

1248
01:15:41,991 --> 01:15:44,411
- You read my column?
- I especially liked it lately.

1249
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:47,038
So sweet and so hopeful.

1250
01:15:47,997 --> 01:15:49,833
It appealed
to the romantic in me.

1251
01:15:52,669 --> 01:15:54,003
That means a lot to me.

1252
01:15:56,506 --> 01:15:58,425
Don't let go
of the joy you found.

1253
01:16:02,345 --> 01:16:03,513
I said my piece.

1254
01:16:04,431 --> 01:16:05,807
I better get back to work.

1255
01:16:10,687 --> 01:16:11,688
Thanks, Daddy.

1256
01:16:14,357 --> 01:16:15,775
Think about what I said.

1257
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,248
You know what, Busby?

1258
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:34,461
It's time the Coach started
thinking about the team.

1259
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:20,882
Thank you.

1260
01:17:26,012 --> 01:17:27,180
Hi.

1261
01:17:27,847 --> 01:17:30,767
Thank you,
for meeting with me.

1262
01:17:30,975 --> 01:17:32,852
Of course, of course.

1263
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:40,652
I feel badly about
what happened before.

1264
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,820
I should have never told you
about Brendan.

1265
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:44,405
No, it's okay,
I'm glad you did.

1266
01:17:44,614 --> 01:17:46,366
No. It's not.

1267
01:17:48,117 --> 01:17:49,827
He was gonna tell you himself.

1268
01:17:51,454 --> 01:17:53,456
Honestly,
who told me doesn't matter.

1269
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:56,626
He just didn't know how.

1270
01:17:59,003 --> 01:18:00,630
He was afraid
he was gonna lose you.

1271
01:18:01,256 --> 01:18:02,382
Well...

1272
01:18:05,385 --> 01:18:07,387
Relationships are complicated.

1273
01:18:08,263 --> 01:18:10,473
I learned that from you,
reading your column.

1274
01:18:10,682 --> 01:18:12,350
They're not usually
this complicated.

1275
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,062
The last few weeks,
you really opened up.

1276
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:17,480
You gave the rest of us hope.

1277
01:18:17,939 --> 01:18:19,816
That's what makes
this all so hard.

1278
01:18:21,067 --> 01:18:22,694
The man I thought
I was falling for...

1279
01:18:22,902 --> 01:18:24,702
...was the same man
who was calling me a fool.

1280
01:18:27,115 --> 01:18:28,616
What's your heart telling you?

1281
01:18:31,578 --> 01:18:32,620
I don't know.

1282
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:35,999
You care for each other.

1283
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,627
That hardly ever happens.

1284
01:18:40,503 --> 01:18:42,297
No, that happens all the time.

1285
01:18:44,507 --> 01:18:46,301
The problem is
it hardly ever lasts.

1286
01:18:52,849 --> 01:18:54,684
I wish "Bench" never existed.

1287
01:18:54,934 --> 01:18:56,561
He just needs
a better editor.

1288
01:18:56,769 --> 01:18:58,205
You have to let her know
how you feel.

1289
01:18:58,229 --> 01:19:00,273
I called, e-mailed.
No response.

1290
01:19:01,065 --> 01:19:03,985
Yeah, I know the feeling. I don't
know how to get through to Pru.

1291
01:19:04,235 --> 01:19:05,320
Did you ask her out?

1292
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,488
Not in so many words.

1293
01:19:07,864 --> 01:19:09,490
I could barely get past hello.

1294
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:12,744
I'd rather just hang onto the fantasy,
than risk rejection.

1295
01:19:12,994 --> 01:19:14,354
You gotta get out
of your own way.

1296
01:19:14,829 --> 01:19:16,039
How do I do that?

1297
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:20,126
Just let her know
she's worth the risk.

1298
01:19:33,014 --> 01:19:35,016
My apologies
for yesterday's column.

1299
01:19:36,267 --> 01:19:38,686
I forget how much love
I have in my life.

1300
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:44,400
My friends, my family,
my dog, Busby.

1301
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:47,862
These are my Valentines
today and every day.

1302
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,074
If you have
that kind of love...

1303
01:19:51,783 --> 01:19:53,284
...celebrate it.

1304
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,960
Mom.

1305
01:20:04,879 --> 01:20:07,423
This is so cool.
Thanks, Aunt Avery.

1306
01:20:07,757 --> 01:20:10,510
Almond bars?
I love these!

1307
01:20:11,177 --> 01:20:13,554
And Dad, this is for you.

1308
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:15,390
Add it to the collection.

1309
01:20:16,933 --> 01:20:18,643
You say you're proud
to be my daughter?

1310
01:20:18,851 --> 01:20:20,353
Well, I couldn't be
prouder of you.

1311
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,272
We'd better go,
we have dinner reservations.

1312
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:26,567
Honey, you look wow.

1313
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:29,987
- Where are you guys going?
- He won't tell me.

1314
01:20:30,196 --> 01:20:31,906
Somewhere fancy
we can't afford.

1315
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:35,743
- Bye.
- You look "wow" too.

1316
01:20:37,495 --> 01:20:39,706
Wanna hear about my date
with Josie?

1317
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:40,914
Yes, I do!

1318
01:20:40,998 --> 01:20:43,418
I gave her the card,
she gave me one, too.

1319
01:20:44,377 --> 01:20:47,880
She gave one to all of the kids
in the class but...

1320
01:20:48,256 --> 01:20:50,425
...she drew a little heart
in mine.

1321
01:20:50,842 --> 01:20:53,302
That's such
a pretty heart.

1322
01:20:54,011 --> 01:20:55,179
I think she likes you.

1323
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:58,725
Her mom took us out for ice cream.
I had chocolate chip...

1324
01:20:58,933 --> 01:21:00,476
...she had strawberry.

1325
01:21:00,727 --> 01:21:02,937
At the end of the date,
she said...

1326
01:21:03,146 --> 01:21:06,691
..."Happy Valentine's Day," and
then she kissed me on the cheek.

1327
01:21:09,026 --> 01:21:11,070
That sounds
like a really great date.

1328
01:21:12,947 --> 01:21:14,907
I hope that dress means
you have a date?

1329
01:21:17,368 --> 01:21:18,578
I wore this for me.

1330
01:21:38,723 --> 01:21:40,308
Happy Valentine's Day.

1331
01:21:42,185 --> 01:21:43,519
Same to you.

1332
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,356
I have trouble expressing myself
at least where you're concerned.

1333
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,609
I didn't want to give myself
any outs...

1334
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:53,946
...so I came with a lot of visuals
that are pretty hard to mistake.

1335
01:21:56,073 --> 01:21:57,158
I think I get the gist.

1336
01:21:58,826 --> 01:22:01,037
So, no pressure...

1337
01:22:01,829 --> 01:22:03,748
...but I wonder if...

1338
01:22:04,874 --> 01:22:06,234
...you would like
to go to dinner?

1339
01:22:17,678 --> 01:22:19,096
Don't you dare
break my heart.

1340
01:22:20,723 --> 01:22:23,267
- I would never do that.
- You say that now.

1341
01:22:24,477 --> 01:22:26,354
I'll say it every single day,
if you'll let me.

1342
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,776
I don't want to spook you.
Was that too much?

1343
01:22:33,694 --> 01:22:35,404
Maybe, for a first date.

1344
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:39,325
Okay. I can definitely
tone it down.

1345
01:22:40,701 --> 01:22:42,328
You might want
to lose the bear.

1346
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:46,790
Okay.

1347
01:23:01,013 --> 01:23:03,975
All in all, it's been
a pretty good Valentine's Day.

1348
01:23:05,893 --> 01:23:07,812
The thing about love is...

1349
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:22,660
Dear Miss Parker,
I want to apologize for...

1350
01:23:22,869 --> 01:23:25,204
...anything I ever did
that might have hurt you.

1351
01:23:25,746 --> 01:23:27,915
The truth is,
I'm your biggest fan.

1352
01:23:28,499 --> 01:23:30,459
You would make me the happiest
man in the world...

1353
01:23:30,668 --> 01:23:32,253
...if you would give me
a second chance.

1354
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:33,921
Quiet, Busby!

1355
01:23:35,882 --> 01:23:37,842
Please tell Busby
I come in peace.

1356
01:23:49,103 --> 01:23:50,855
You look beautiful.

1357
01:23:55,151 --> 01:23:57,111
This is hard to do
without using my thumbs.

1358
01:23:59,655 --> 01:24:03,075
Well, I think you and I do better
in person than we do in print.

1359
01:24:16,505 --> 01:24:18,424
I've never cared
for Valentine's Day...

1360
01:24:18,841 --> 01:24:20,961
...but somehow, it brought you
and me together, and...

1361
01:24:21,093 --> 01:24:22,653
...now it's my favorite day
of the year.

1362
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:27,141
I said some things
I regret, but...

1363
01:24:27,725 --> 01:24:30,144
...what I regret most is
what I didn't say...

1364
01:24:30,353 --> 01:24:34,732
...that you are the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

1365
01:24:39,737 --> 01:24:41,614
You're doing really well.

Avery Parker...

1367
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:55,753
...will you do me the honor
of being my Valentine?

1368
01:24:58,422 --> 01:25:00,007
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1369
01:25:33,082 --> 01:25:35,209
With a full and grateful heart...

1370
01:25:35,668 --> 01:25:38,129
...I wish each
and every one of you...

1371
01:25:38,671 --> 01:25:42,550
...a Valentine's Day
as magical as mine.
