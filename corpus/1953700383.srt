1
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,880
I can tell you everything about
all the attractions of the city.

2
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,160
From Voodoo to the French Opera
House.

3
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,400
We know everything.

4
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,560
Go along to the favorite place
the 'literazzi.

5
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,520
And you can also Hades visits.

6
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,160
The above-ground tombs
New Orleans.

7
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,440
The museum in Jackson Street...

8
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,720
Holds not only ancient
city maps...

9
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,440
But also the Rosary
Marie Antoinette.

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,360
Interested in money?
And who is not?

11
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,160
Why have you done successfully, Captain?
Where did I fall flat?

12
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,720
Was it blue?
Yes, according to the rules is that

13
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,200
prohibited.

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,880
That was it.
Absolutely brilliant and fantastic.

15
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,320
Pull that silver lame and enjoy
of a real alien.

16
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,960
Sorry.

17
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,720
Fast.

18
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,480
I could not resist.

19
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
She saw me.

20
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,240
She could recognize me.

21
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,400
Why did she do something so stupid?
Bad timing.

22
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,680
I had to finish it r.
Get out.

23
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,640
Are you the valium
my watch or run too fast?

24
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,120
Why do you now smoke?
It's a good time.

25
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,320
A woman could not wait for the elevator
and took the stairs.

26
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,440
Temporarily or permanently
disabled?

27
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,480
Death.
Nice. Creepy, but beautiful.

28
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
Why?
They know we mean it.

29
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,640
Sat you mean?
You really are a special.

30
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,160
Dear Jesus,
My name is Coco Chavez.

31
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,320
I do not know why I
now addressing you.

32
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,720
Life has its uncertainties.

33
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,040
Kidnapping is actually
only for suckers.

34
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,200
But this was my idea.

35
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,760
Junior and I were occupied
with blackmail.

36
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,520
Shall we go to the room?

37
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I never do this
during working hours...

38
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,800
But can I learn from you
than one course.

39
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,200
Help yourself, cowboy.
Come on.

40
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,240
Good.

41
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,840
You are truly unique.
So do we.

42
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,840
I'll be ready.

43
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,200
Your wife wants five thousand
per month...

44
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,520
The car and the beach,
otherwise she gets to court.

45
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,440
I would only draw.

46
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,080
When I read Career information
The manual for the cheat.

47
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,600
We chartered Sloth Browning.

48
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,200
An eccentric who occasionally
appeared in the environment.

49
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
Who are we?
Where have you been?

50
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,960
This requires everyone.
Harvard.

51
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,880
Why did I not support them.
How you doing?

52
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,120
We murder 1 6-year olds
for fun.

53
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,680
It only kills you profits?

54
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,520
You really have to Harare.

55
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,720
This is a romantic dinner.
Should I go?

56
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,400
Just be just
something more charming.

57
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,560
Still in the separations,
business?

58
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,280
Not for long. I'm doing
with a kidnapping.

59
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,040
Come on, even a child knows
kidnapping is for suckers.

60
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,880
What are you talking about?
I do not want more fake orgasms.

61
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,640
Kidnapping?
Why not?

62
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,400
I recently worked for a
accountant Dyscan...

63
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Dyscape?
That company is worth billions.

64
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,280
If you are not in your computer,
You can do anything.

65
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,160
That guy is a genius.

66
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,040
Accountant who governs
insurance and such.

67
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,200
He says that if Ben Dyson
kidnapped...

68
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,160
Dyscape straight four million
pay.

69
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Without a question.

70
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,960
The man is worth billions.
So they got him insured.

71
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,880
He must have one billion bodyguards
and alarm systems.

72
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,600
We talk about the big money.
It is worth it.

73
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,640
Why do you say is true for Sloth?
Because he was not participating.

74
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,120
Not fancy enough.

75
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,040
But you do not stop us, eh?

76
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,920
I'll call you guys. The dinner
I pay. Buenas noches.

77
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,320
Who does too.
I'm going Dyson's house.

78
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,560
I thought it was my turn.
You can always do the fun stuff.

79
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,120
You go find strength.

80
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,200
If you're in New Orleans muscle
needed...

81
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,360
You had to have Poppy Malavero.

82
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,920
A throwing ex-minister in New
Orleans

83
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,520
known as the Bible.

84
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,000
And Jesus, he knew the Bible
better than God.

85
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,160
Miss Chavez.
Mr. Malavero.

86
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,240
Read the book still?
Not since you did not preach.

87
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,800
You still go to church?

88
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,880
You should know that the church
changes in foolish ways.

89
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm sorry that I
so behaved, Coco.

90
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,440
Everyone had done it.

91
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,640
It was the perfect place for it.

92
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,520
You were a beautiful chorus girl.

93
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
Sal!

94
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,200
What's that kid-Mormons
again? Middleweight.

95
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,600
Middleweight?

96
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,800
Sergio. Sergio Dos Veces.
That I mean.

97
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,960
How was it out of the junkyard?
It has cost him an arm.

98
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,240
And one eye.
I can do find out.

99
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
Ruben Ruben Bauer.
Ruben Ruben Bauer.

100
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,600
Totally cool. This German kid
makes some really good things.

101
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,920
He stood on guard
in a jewel heist...

102
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,600
And was attacked by
a door with two pit bulls.

103
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,600
He puts the odds porter
and demolishes those dogs.

104
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,600
Silent Death, provided the instruction.

105
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,640
The others come out.
They had heard nothing.

106
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,800
Sal has his number.
Thank you, Poppy.

107
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,920
The man is clean.

108
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,440
According Poppy are you crazy
but never caught.

109
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,960
And what do you think?
I do not know.

110
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,720
I trust not. Or you
always lucky, or you're a snitch.

111
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,840
What are you thinking?

112
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,360
You do not know.
Say it then.

113
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,720
Clever answer.

114
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,840
I think of you in all
indecent positions.

115
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Where are you from?
I?

116
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,640
From Wanna-Acorn,
North Rhine Westphalia.

117
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,440
And what do they do?
Dogs in flames stabbing...

118
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,040
Drinking and their sisters
chasing.

119
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,640
Are you poor?

120
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,520
Let me see.

121
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
Shows.

122
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,320
Well, maybe I'll call you.

123
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,640
You're crazy and stupid.
Maybe I'll call you.

124
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
Do you know the mambo?

125
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,600
That dance.
I call it the "save me dance.

126
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,480
I am the best muscle bundle
you can get.

127
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,160
And I kill everything.
With guns or knives.

128
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,800
But I get nervous when applying.
Then I do a bit tough.

129
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,560
But if we do both
nothing to lose...

130
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,640
The mambo.

131
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,760
Rubens mambo was the deciding factor.

132
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,280
But on the next
we were not prepared.

133
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,800
Are you well prepared?
That we see so well.

134
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,640
Sew me Junior.
Right now?

135
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,360
I must be calm.
Too much adrenaline.

136
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,840
I want ultra-kinky,
Feast hat lit sex.

137
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,960
Your heart is pounding almost
your chest out.

138
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Throw me on the mattress
otherwise I'll go to Mexico...

139
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,480
For a few of the muchachos
Ava Gardner who also was in that movie.

140
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,920
Do you get air?

141
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,920
Are you well?

142
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,120
Do you go to the bathroom or something?

143
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,080
You can talk, you know.

144
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,960
We are not insane or anything.

145
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,760
Are we nuts?
No.

146
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,240
Yes, I have to go to the bathroom.

147
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Dammit, Junior.

148
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,920
You touch me in places
no man ever touched me.

149
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,040
You make everything in my wake.

150
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm so in love with you.
You're just up for religious experience.

151
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,640
Sorry about today.
I mean it.

152
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,800
This makes up for it.

153
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,480
We can still go lsla Margarita.
Piña Colada's and each other.

154
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,720
They have rum?
Yes.

155
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,360
I am not a Piña Colada type.

156
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,640
Or they have nothing else.

157
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,120
Rum-cola then. I like the way
which you run your ass.

158
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,040
We're on TV.

159
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,120
The police in Park Circle 351...

160
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,040
With computer giant
Ben Dyson was abducted.

161
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,560
In his apartment was Patricia Hornbeck
found dead.

162
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,440
The wife of Senator Hornbeck.

163
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,520
It is unclear whether the murder in
related to the kidnapping...

164
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,880
But such a large police
power we have never seen.

165
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
And?
This is not your concern anyway?

166
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,400
Grimes has broken his foot.
I'm falling for him.

167
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,200
The maid 's body was found.
The doorman is in hospital.

168
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,760
We start with the maid.
Give me a tape recorder, coffee...

169
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,720
And send guests away.

170
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,760
Boys...
Get out.

171
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
This just once, Miss Ruiz.

172
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,560
Were you at the time of the murder
in the flat?

173
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,800
Where were you?
On Thursday I do the

174
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,320
messages.

175
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,800
When I came back,
I opened the door...

176
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,480
And I saw the woman lying.
I have very loud screaming.

177
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,920
I have never...

178
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,360
Did you know her?

179
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,560
Was she a friend
Mr. Dyson?

180
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,720
When you discovered that Mr.. Dyson
disappeared?

181
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,160
I called in January 1991, and the police
wanted to wait on Mr.. Dyson.

182
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,040
They waited and waited.
And when they saw that outfit.

183
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,520
I had picked up
when I got home.

184
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,240
What kind of world do we live?

185
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,080
I think God is asleep.

186
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,720
Friedman?

187
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,840
Commissioner?

188
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,680
The butler did it.
Sorry it took so long.

189
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Want to meet the senator?

190
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
I heard that he
can not play poker.

191
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,320
He is a man with power.

192
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,640
FBI Agent Hawkins, the
kidnapping, you do the murder.

193
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,280
Use all your resources...

194
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,160
And pretend that you like,
because you walk them to the feet.

195
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,480
I do not want.
The senator and I are friends.

196
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,160
I do not want.

197
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Grimes will take some sick,
So you're gonna do it.

198
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,120
I do not want.
I know.

199
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,120
For clarity...

200
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,920
Dyscape to life
Mr. Dyson is not in jeopardy.

201
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,200
We are prepared to the requirements
to meet the kidnappers...

202
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,120
And four million to deliver
to be determined by their place...

203
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,000
İn exchange for Mr.. Dyson.

204
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,760
Tonight at eight hours
we would be called.

205
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,920
My daughter also has "one computer.
Those things are really nice.

206
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,160
We want the authorities happy
help, but we will not...

207
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,720
The kidnappers of the
Line hold or mislead.

208
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,920
That is our position.

209
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,080
Pamper me "s.

210
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,280
That is a sexual remark,
Agent Hawkins.

211
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,240
Okay, you've never
had a female boss.

212
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm in the office,
I've never shot.

213
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,400
I do this for my father.

214
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,440
For a PhD, I ready to suck...

215
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,320
Even if they wanted to do
has a wife.

216
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,600
I'm stupid
and you're usually right.

217
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,600
And I'm in love with you
but do not show it.

218
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,280
Forget something?

219
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,000
You drive better but I will
never admit it.

220
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,400
Keep me posted,
then you can always help us.

221
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,960
How thoughtful of you.
Heard of that door?

222
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,880
I'm going to the hospital.
And the upstairs neighbor?

223
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,920
Mary-Ellen Floyd, she played tennis
with the wife of the senator.

224
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,240
Will you come to the senator?
Lie on top of you like?

225
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,120
Usually, yes.
Later sex?

226
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,600
Just call my ex.
Then I call my ex.

227
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,360
Too bad Joyce hits as
liked, then it was not done.

228
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,560
You know Jim Thompson.
Not bad for a detective.

229
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,080
I'm full of contradictions,
Agent Hawkins. Just wait.

230
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,800
Mr. Gordon?
What is left of it. Who are you?

231
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Detective Friedman.
Do you mind?

232
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,560
I saw almost nothing.

233
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,400
Only something with a guy who
the monitor was on the tenth.

234
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,280
He was standing near the camera.
Dark hair...

235
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,840
Late twenties and early thirties.

236
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,360
Maybe forty.

237
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm just not very good.

238
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,360
But...

239
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,480
You're the last person
Mrs. Hornbeck alive saw.

240
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,800
I'm sorry that you so quickly
again to retell story.

241
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,760
I wish I knew more.

242
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,600
Patty and I played
tennis every Thursday.

243
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,880
Sometimes she went after
showering here.

244
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,640
It's insane.
She was so clever, so witty.

245
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,560
She was my best friend.
We knew each other for fifteen years.

246
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,720
She left my apartment...

247
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,920
And she was murdered
because they took the stairs.

248
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,920
It's pathetic.
I miss her already

249
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,840
I beg you...

250
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,400
From the bottom...

251
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,320
Of my soul,
this Gajes to detect.

252
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,560
I want them to stand trial
with all of that means.

253
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,240
Then I make a new law
which we can

254
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,400
call it.

255
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,720
I swear.

256
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,440
I beg you guys
forgive my behavior.

257
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,800
But I can see my feelings
not express in words.

258
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,280
I hope...

259
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,520
That none of you
This will ever know.

260
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,360
These bastards have
signed their death warrant.

261
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,120
And?
Hack.

262
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,440
That is not enough?
Dyson knows anything yet.

263
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,280
In such transfer
they can catch us.

264
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,920
I had 'r death to shoot.
Why? That had been the same.

265
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,400
Four million.
I always make everything.

266
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,880
Besides my school then.

267
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,600
We have until tomorrow.
Yes, they still find us al.

268
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,680
With beaucoup people.
Now let's hack.

269
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,400
Then they'll never find.
A careless does not matter.

270
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,320
That does matter.
We are now...

271
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,720
What word do I search?
Suspicious. We are suspicious.

272
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,280
They had had nothing
but now they are angry.

273
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,520
We call them tonight.
We do it or we do not.

274
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,160
Do you get along?
I was not cut.

275
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,480
With Walters.
We are intercepted.

276
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,920
Go to Capri's Pizza.
You have five minutes.

277
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,440
I told you so.
Be happy for your boss.

278
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,600
How's he doing?
Crying.

279
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,720
Soon he still gets
a salt shortage.

280
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,560
May I Mr.. Walters?

281
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,760
Who is the FBI agent
standing next to you?

282
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,560
Her name is Hawkins.
No, I want to talk to you.

283
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,440
But say that the fruit
panini's very good.

284
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,480
A mobile.
How long?

285
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,640
Piece of cake.

286
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,440
A silver box, model 399.
With black handles.

287
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,800
Four million used tickets.

288
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You must repeat all of them?
I'll call you tomorrow at noon.

289
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,120
Twelve o'clock?
Then you have the money yet.

290
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,160
Then I have the money yet.

291
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,560
Are you an early bird?
Pardon?

292
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,120
He switches from line.
Not bad.

293
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,760
Are you an early bird?
Yes.

294
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,880
Than eight hours.

295
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,680
Eight o'clock in the morning?
Try to postpone it.

296
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,320
I can only cash afternoon
control. Then the bank open...

297
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,760
Six hours.
You call for six hours.

298
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,320
If you go, the more
earlier, right?

299
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,720
Clear.
Say you're sorry.

300
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,480
I'm sorry.
May I Mr.. Dyson?

301
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,080
No need to cry.
Tomorrow you'll be back Fri

302
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,400
I know this happens quite brutally
but we really do no harm.

303
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,000
Come to the phone.
Your accountant to see you.

304
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
Do not be a coward.

305
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,560
If you're her 's stores,
and how much you're worth...

306
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,560
I ram your brains out.
Got it?

307
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,240
Calm down, people.
It should be called.

308
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay?

309
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,760
I've never in my face
beaten. It really hurts.

310
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,280
That cop me never.
I would not dare.

311
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,160
Coward and was right
love meant.

312
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,800
Well, then up to five hours.
Here Dyson.

313
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,200
Who is this?
Walters.

314
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,560
Accounting. You okay?
It could be better, Walters.

315
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,680
We're going to save you.

316
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,840
He lives. I'll call you for four hours.
And the luck to Hawkins.

317
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,040
And if you lie again
I cut into a thousand piece Dyson choose.

318
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,120
Dyson was that?

319
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Detective?
Got him before?

320
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,640
The transfer to four hours.
Then I have lots of time.

321
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,360
If we do not tackle.
I take everything into consideration.

322
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,400
If you do screw up they are gone.
Kidnappers always make mistakes.

323
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,120
I am so glad that the FBI
scientific progress.

324
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,720
Lick my dick, say.
Here?

325
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,760
Is it too late to a grieving
witness to look?

326
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,240
Not if you bring flowers.

327
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,360
See you at Dyscape.

328
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,120
Miss Floyd, sorry to bother again.
I had forgotten my lighter.

329
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,120
It sounds pretty...
But it's an heirloom from my father.

330
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,560
Thank you.

331
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,000
Thanks again.
No thanks.

332
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,160
We had but at bedtime.

333
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,800
Patty was not bad.
That will be good.

334
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,640
You do not have to be bad
to a victim.

335
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,520
I would do anything for her,
you understand that?

336
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,880
It is not for me to decide
what is right or wrong.

337
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,480
She loved him.
She really loved...

338
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,520
I'm sure.

339
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,680
And it was quite something be.

340
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,720
It was something to be
between Patty and the senator?

341
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,680
Patty and Ben.
Patty Hornbeck...

342
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,640
And Ben Dyson.

343
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,320
They had a relationship.

344
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,280
She was so happy. Finally
she had the luck on her side.

345
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,800
How long were they together?

346
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,240
The past three months
they came here every Thursday.

347
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,160
They went almost one year
with each other.

348
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,800
Time to sleep.
Tomorrow is another day...

349
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,520
And then we all
a new opportunity.

350
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,120
Tell me your dreams again.

351
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,640
I dream that I am bound
in a barn...

352
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,080
With horns on my head
and a cowbell around my neck...

353
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,960
And me from behind
am by a huge bull.

354
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,000
I mean your ambitions.
What do you want?

355
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,920
I am the most available space
girl in this universe.

356
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,000
You do not do crazy things
to get my clothes off.

357
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,080
Four hours is too early.
Then let him wait for nine

358
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,520
hours.

359
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,840
Four hours is too early.
Then let him wait for nine

360
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,560
hours.

361
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,200
At the next show is...

362
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,080
Is not it a bit early?
Not if you drink as much as I do.

363
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,000
Happy reading.

364
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,960
I would like Dyson phone bills
also see.

365
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,240
I do everything, but this is crazy.
Over 1 5 minutes, the

366
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,400
cleaners.

367
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,720
Shoot it.

368
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Thanks, Friedman.

369
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,520
We have one go to eat.
Sure. The best.

370
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,680
Did you sleep last night?
Pardon?

371
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,600
How many hours?
Four, as always. And you?

372
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
Too.

373
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,160
We can also eat leaves.

374
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,280
Reuben, do that thing away.
The bacon is already dead.

375
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,120
I have never until
nothing slain.

376
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,000
You had the chance.
I had her shot.

377
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,960
But Coco was huge.

378
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,480
Really. You were great.
You do not even froze.

379
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,360
I do my first murder remember.

380
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,440
I completely froze.
Well, except my ass then.

381
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,960
I had a week schijterij.

382
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,480
But do not you, eh?

383
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,880
Do you like to have your baby
mother's nipple bitten off?

384
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,400
You keep your good.

385
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,000
I had hitherto only
shot on beer cans.

386
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,160
Once a bird,
but then I was drunk.

387
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,400
I want to just
you just say so...

388
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,040
So you know...

389
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,280
You're doing really good, considering...

390
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
Excuse me.

391
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,160
I feel sick.
Pregnant?

392
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,560
If only it were true.
You know best.

393
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,840
Give me a break, you had no choice.
Why no choice?

394
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,400
What should I say?
That you had to fuck?

395
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,760
Because that is not. You did
Just what to do.

396
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,000
But you're not a monster.
I had ever slain.

397
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,480
Until then, you did everything right.
It was just one incident.

398
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,120
Until then, you did everything right?
What does this mean?

399
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,760
That means...

400
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
What it means.

401
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,720
Listen, you and me...

402
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,320
Have been through so much.
Good and bad things.

403
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,800
But we always feel
of humor had.

404
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,120
Life is a comedy.

405
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,600
Now if you collapse, drag me.
For we are one.

406
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,920
We're just the same.
And this is life.

407
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,360
We learn from our mistakes.

408
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,520
And you should not think that this
incident are now at risk.

409
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,880
Because we know that only
when this is over.

410
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,760
So to be afraid
We both have nothing.

411
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,000
Make sure you live.

412
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,760
Because I can do without you,
but I do not want.

413
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,040
You have a perfectly oiled
machinery put in motion.

414
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,440
Now you take away.

415
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,240
Go take a bath, Go watch TV...

416
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,600
Read a book, do something.

417
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,160
See you in a couple of hours,
I promise you.

418
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,960
Promise bad luck.
Then I promise not.

419
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,840
But I do love you.

420
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,760
Ruben is the deal.
I leave it to you back.

421
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,880
Keep an eye on Sloth.

422
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,640
Go with that banana.

423
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,920
Should not you be doing?

424
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,120
Is this an interview?
With you, you never know.

425
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,240
Are we here all day wait?

426
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,920
You still get paid?
Yes, I get paid.

427
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,320
And you have FBI protection.

428
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,760
Usually you get only
if you gangsters denounced.

429
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,000
Take your shoes off.
Enjoy life.

430
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,760
Showtime.

431
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,200
Go to Wally's Auto Shop.
You have 32 minutes.

432
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,080
I'll be there.
Of course.

433
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,880
The senator is not really fast.

434
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:33,200
Detective, I'm afraid
The Senator has no time for you.

435
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,080
Bang...

436
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,480
İs the key word here.

437
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,080
Lee Ann, with Rickles.
Leave the car ride.

438
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,760
I drink now three quarters
bad coffee...

439
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,840
Waiting for his highness.

440
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,600
I understand that his dead wife
not valuable enough...

441
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,840
Time to five minutes
to spend...

442
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,720
But I soon of time.

443
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,720
I do not like your tone, Detective.
I need to talk to you.

444
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,520
I'm all ears
from here to the car.

445
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Your wife had a relationship with Dyson.

446
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:26,400
I'm not surprised. We had
relationships with all celebrities.

447
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,160
I mean a different kind of relationship.
Is it something obvious?

448
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,800
She had a relationship with Dyson.
It will be your own wife had

449
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,080
are.

450
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,000
They called each other every day.
Listen, asshole.

451
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,240
I do not know what your
intention is...

452
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,200
But as the blackening People

453
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,600
part of your research...

454
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,120
I'll go here with
Commissioner talk.

455
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,800
I have no time for your pathetic
are destroying...

456
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,160
But I know people Sat
You speak to me again.

457
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,680
You'll never look at me.

458
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,040
If I see you here again,
drill so many sources...

459
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:17,200
İt certainly will last 50 years
before you have dug.

460
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,840
I thought you were Matty.

461
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,600
Matty Grimes?
Your cars look alike.

462
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,840
Have a nice day.

463
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,160
I've tried once.
But I do not know why.

464
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,760
Just once?
Amateur.

465
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,840
You too?

466
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,720
Really?
I'm not dwell on mistakes.

467
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,760
You lie.
Maybe.

468
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,840
But who will ever know?

469
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,960
If you commit suicide,
I will never forget...

470
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,880
The blood and dreadful
grimace in the mirror.

471
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,880
But from that moment
it all romantic.

472
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,920
Just like all those rumors.
Sloth is perhaps a cop...

473
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,560
Or maybe he
really killed his parents.

474
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,000
You do not know.

475
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,840
Exactly. And it's all
so unimportant.

476
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,440
Chatter. Junior and you were
high school sweethearts, huh?

477
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,160
If we stay at school.
What you got to know each other?

478
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,760
I had a crazy boyfriend.
Jiminy Cricket.

479
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,320
I know them.
Pinocchio who helped you?

480
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,440
Japie used speed and had
absolutely no confidence.

481
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,200
He was spanking me with an violin.

482
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,440
We stripped off-licenses
and had only oral sex...

483
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,160
Because he was afraid that I
become pregnant.

484
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,000
He dared not even me kissing.

485
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,640
He said his spittle
was rich in sperm.

486
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:41,280
But I was young and he had a
cool engine, so what do you do?

487
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,640
We could hack into the supermarket
where Junior worked.

488
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,560
According Japie pe
a reliable guy.

489
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,040
We would go through the freezer door.
Japie but did not show.

490
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,720
That was often done
and I began to doubt him.

491
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,200
I went in alone
Junior and looked at the drink stand.

492
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,520
The freezer came out in the store.
Since he was hiding.

493
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,880
But the watchman was come along

494
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,760
and who had him imprisoned.

495
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,480
When I appeared he was half paralyzed.
Not a good start, so.

496
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,840
We decided to do nothing and
then came to climb outside Japie.

497
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,560
He saw the door open...

498
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,120
And did it shut
to avoid arousing suspicion.

499
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,960
Junior and I decided then
but drunk.

500
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,680
That night we made
to change the world.

501
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,320
And ourselves.

502
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,360
We went off like rabbits.

503
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,520
Staring at a dead cow
I experienced my first orgasm.

504
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,200
That smell of blood and fresh meat
I'll never forget.

505
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,880
I immediately felt
I was in love.

506
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,960
How did you get out?

507
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,080
When the supermarket opened,
we just ran out.

508
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,320
Junior took immediate dismissal.

509
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,080
And if I see a steak,
I get wet.

510
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:59,720
They have a yellow jig cart.
And a van, very unobtrusive.

511
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,000
And another car for that truck.

512
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,240
It gets a wife.
The leader. Nice type.

513
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,720
Tell him I put them on here
all shut-off.

514
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,800
Ruben said...
I've heard. I'll call you.

515
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,160
No, Mrs. Gurwitz. The distributor
was okay, it was the radiator.

516
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,560
And we have been replaced.

517
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,120
We have a problem.
I do not have that thing out of it.

518
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,760
Can they not wait?
What?

519
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,760
I do need the phone, Mr.. Wally.
This is a matter for the police.

520
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,800
You're not a cop.
Fuck.

521
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,080
Get out your Mr. Wally.

522
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,240
No, ma'am. We are already working
Mercedes has been with yours

523
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,320
I'll just look in the file.

524
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,320
Women...

525
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,200
You never let me wait.
Sorry.

526
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,760
What are you doing?
I need to call.

527
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,760
What is it?
Wally saves your accountant so rotten.

528
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,400
He calls for help.
Officers go inside.

529
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,680
Wally she threatens
with a tire iron.

530
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,880
Male officers?
Yes. Walters inside.

531
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,080
Do you play a game?
A mechanic grabbed and bit me...

532
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,960
Do you think I am a child?

533
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,480
Dyson will not like it
so you play with his life.

534
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,560
I was really on time.
Shut up.

535
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,920
Tell that Hawkins
that van to buzz off.

536
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,880
Yet it is a lie and Dyson.
And I promise you.

537
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,440
Go to the Three Horseshoes Motel.
Since I'll call you. Take a taxi.

538
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,080
And if I see friends there as well,
I will shoot you dead.

539
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,960
He must go to a motel.
They keep an eye on us.

540
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:08,480
They can not see you. Let
motel investigations cameras.

541
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,760
Otherwise they'll never see.
Unless they themselves are at the motel.

542
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,960
But if they are not stupid.

543
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,440
Submit an agent
with the accountant.

544
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,280
They see us. Be careful if you have anything
sees that "one kidnapper seems.

545
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,800
It is no weekend, Dave.
I come for Matty.

546
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,520
Hello, Tinkerbell.
Bye, Dad.

547
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,600
Do not you go to school?
She has a cold.

548
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,520
Matty is there.

549
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,840
All kits, Friedman?
I come here to visit.

550
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,720
The boys miss you.
We hope you are soon recovered.

551
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,920
You lie worse than me.

552
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,080
What can I do for you?
I've got the Hornbeck case.

553
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,520
I heard that. Make me
pride, but not too proud.

554
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,680
I did my job badly.

555
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,000
Coincidentally enough, that you just
at the moment your foot breaks.

556
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:36,160
Everything has its reason. Usually
The reason is that life cunt.

557
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,680
I do not want to rush,
but I just want to nap.

558
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,960
Do you Hornbeck well known?
- He is an ex-policeman.

559
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,080
He can totally play poker.
Did you often with him?

560
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,520
Friedman, I like you
very happy, really.

561
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,440
But what if you want to ask
please do so.

562
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,760
Do you Patty Hornbeck bugged?

563
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,280
You have not slept yet, eh?
You're the expert. Yes or no?

564
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,280
I keep myself away from the stupid.

565
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,560
I do not promote
but I will not die.

566
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,360
I have not bugged.
I ask you very sweet.

567
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,720
I do not want that job.
You must get away from it.

568
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,640
You're going to see ghosts.

569
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,240
What are you doing?
You're bluffing, I want to see.

570
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,520
Put that thing away.
I want to break your foot.

571
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,400
Which is already broken.

572
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,120
Then you can never jump.
Say goodbye your foot.

573
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,840
Stop.
Have you listened to her?

574
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,440
I'll get you.
I swear.

575
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,240
Yes or no?

576
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,080
Impaired idiot.

577
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,600
Well?
Yes.

578
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,200
A taxi.
Walters gets into.

579
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,960
You see the driver?
No. Is one of them?

580
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,840
Absolutely. The FBI
never had a fantasy.

581
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,320
Hang.

582
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,200
Sloth is right.
Walters carries a transmitter.

583
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,160
Leave it to Robin about that one.

584
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,600
If they do not go away
you are going one by one.

585
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,240
How do you feel?
Nervous, but that's normal.

586
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,000
And Sloth?

587
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,720
Which states that feeble
yoga thing to do.

588
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,280
But if he stays calm.
I'll call you for five hours.

589
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,520
Have you eaten?

590
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,600
Rolo come here for?

591
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,760
Pardon?
That is in fact arrested.

592
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,280
Who?
Rolo.

593
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,240
Reception. Who?

594
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,320
Rolo has been arrested.

595
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,000
Who? I do not know Walters.

596
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,120
Who is Rolo?
No idea.

597
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,240
Agent can hear this?
Which agent?

598
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,120
You want to die?

599
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,560
See that green bench behind you?

600
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,240
Underneath my phone and show a note.
Read it and tear 't.

601
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,560
Fuck you.

602
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,360
That was not against you.
I'm used to it.

603
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,080
TAKE THE TRAIN February 1 HOUR.

604
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,160
TAKE THE PHONE WITH YOU
AND THE CASE

605
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,440
That bastard can not see me.

606
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,640
And when the woman goes with it,
she is brilliant.

607
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,120
You must now but alone.

608
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,000
I have four minutes the train.

609
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,240
Send two cars behind the train.

610
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,480
I said he had to wait.
He is already inside.

611
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,960
Let us only.

612
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,280
You replaced Matty for me.
What have you against me?

613
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,640
Your entrance was great, but now I
You talk nonsense. What do you mean?

614
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,280
Ben Dyson and Patty Hornbeck
had a relationship.

615
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,280
Hornbeck had her listen
by Matty.

616
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,480
I'm talking about corruption in
Police on a large scale.

617
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,120
It was clear that I
job would not...

618
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,320
Because it is illegal as what
but you wanted me to sew.

619
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,560
What have you against me?

620
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:33,440
The citizen has no idea how
is required of law enforcement.

621
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:38,000
You mean?
Thank you first come to me.

622
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:43,200
And do you do for me?
You are too quick with your conclusions.

623
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,200
As a Dyson and Mrs. Hornbeck
affair

624
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,160
had, it was a coincidence.

625
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:54,080
Give me a break.
Coincidence, nothing more.

626
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:58,440
There is no coincidence, Commissioner.
You know best.

627
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:04,280
I expect a report
clues and suspects, ASAP.

628
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,360
There is only one suspect.
There is only one killer.

629
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,400
Can I Rupert Hornbeck arrest?

630
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:17,600
I just do this or I not heard.

631
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,400
Shall we take a swim?
With all that gear you sink right away.

632
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:39,480
Some people find dirty iron.
I never thought about it.

633
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,160
I wish women tasted like iron.

634
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,360
You really do
for psychologists.

635
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,840
That's what my mother already.

636
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,720
With Walters.
About two hours Dyson let go.

637
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,680
Put the window open
and thus throw out the suitcase.

638
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,760
Now...

639
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,720
FBI!
Stop!

640
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,120
Ruben, come on now!

641
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,320
Get in!

642
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,320
This is it.

643
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,640
This is it!
Not too much to watch.

644
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:18,640
I've never seen so much dough.
It gives me a hard-on.

645
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,280
Soon the wind out of the window.

646
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,600
Close the window.

647
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,200
You know, I have sometimes
dreamed of...

648
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,280
But it did not fit even
in my head.

649
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,720
Still not.
My head almost pops apart.

650
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,760
Like I have epilepsy.
A stroke?

651
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,720
No, such epilepsy.
A vision.

652
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,400
You mean an epiphany.

653
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:50,320
I thought she was just as
would do as in movies.

654
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,920
Money top
and newspapers underneath.

655
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,680
And there was I been happy.

656
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,440
But this is completely full.
They've really done.

657
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,080
Do you know "Objective, Burma"
with Errol Flynn?

658
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,800
I do not like old movies.

659
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,760
Why not?
I want to talk about it.

660
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:20,720
Errol Flynn, is a gay?
I think Errol Flynn died.

661
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:26,880
I mean, was he a gay?
How should I know?

662
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,720
Cary Grant was feeling gay,
and Rock Hudson.

663
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,000
You know what was in
My mom happened?

664
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:41,960
She was devastated. They have
its so terribly disappointed.

665
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,560
When I see an old movie,
then I always think:

666
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,640
Maybe my mother love
on him but he is a gay.

667
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,600
And I get so sad.
Something there.

668
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,360
Why do you stop?
A new battery.

669
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,640
What happens in that movie?

670
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,880
Flynn and a few soldiers
jump off the plane...

671
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,360
Above the jungle.

672
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:13,560
Someone asks Flynn
What if my parachute does not open?

673
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,440
Says Flynn:
Well, you're the first down.

674
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:24,280
What does that mean?
Nothing.

675
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,440
I need the money.
Are you a man of your word?

676
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:20,320
I've never been bothered.
Got something for me?

677
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:28,440
Ellroy Street 551 5.
Open the box under your seat.

678
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,880
Senator? That girl that
Dyson is unarmed.

679
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,080
Hawkins, where you stay?
I come.

680
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,040
He leaves now.

681
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,080
Here I am.

682
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,880
I hope you're sure.
It is becoming increasingly uncertain.

683
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,160
Do you have money?
Hush money?

684
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,000
To park.

685
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,000
It's wrong.

686
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,680
Time is not linear.
What do you mean?

687
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,320
If you have a time on your watch
look, I vil you alive.

688
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,960
Do you know something I do not know?
This question is an open book.

689
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:16,520
Stop it.
I just take breath.

690
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,280
That haughty stuff is boring.

691
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,480
You're so good with words.

692
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:29,400
And let alone the hostage,
you're too impatient.

693
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,600
When they asked Thompson
how he came all the plot...

694
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,560
He said that there is only one plot.

695
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,720
You can not win them all.
Almost.

696
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,800
Nothing is what it seems.

697
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,800
Why are you not a writer more?

698
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Go follow him.

699
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:56,400
Why me?
He does not like me. Hurry.

700
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,440
Follow the green car.
What kept you?

701
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,920
She sold Tupperware.
What do you mean?

702
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,160
I was worried.

703
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,520
Hornbeck him a given address.

704
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,200
Standard. A .357. What old-fashioned,
but I love it.

705
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,520
Do you smoke?

706
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:38,000
Beautiful things. Are you a
health freak...

707
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,520
Or did you never act tough?

708
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,240
I smoke since my twelfth.
So I never stop.

709
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,320
If I ask a question,
You will not beat me?

710
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,520
I want to know how it feels...

711
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,840
İf you think you it goes.

712
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,800
I mean anything with.
Murder because we do not really...

713
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,560
And this is not
torture technique.

714
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,880
You must think that you die
because you think we are crazy.

715
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:20,480
I want to know what you feel,
but fear and insecurity and so on.

716
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:25,920
I want to know if you feel
will receive a revelation.

717
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,240
A kind permission.

718
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,440
Resolutions and such.

719
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,960
You want to say anything, huh?

720
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,160
I thought maybe you
talk to someone.

721
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,400
This car 340.

722
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,040
Can I have an ambulance?

723
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,840
At the corner of Ellroy Street.

724
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,680
You was not kidding
about your driving style, eh?

725
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,680
Because anyway...

726
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,920
When this is over,
you still need years of therapy.

727
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,960
How did that story again?

728
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,480
About those scientist
who builds the first computer.

729
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:21,640
A perfect machine. He works days
and night and he is finally ready.

730
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,520
He switch on
and his first question is:

731
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:30,640
Is there a god?
And the computer says:

732
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,040
What did that say?

733
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,280
I am now.

734
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,680
I knew it.
I wanted you to talk.

735
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,520
So you will not kill me?
No, if you believe me at least.

736
01:14:54,600 --> 01:15:00,440
May I ask you something?
Yeah. I want to talk.

737
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:05,240
Why did you kill Patty?
Patty Which?

738
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,800
You knew the wife of the senator.
Yes.

739
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:18,440
It was our
so little time awarded.

740
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,280
God, why did this
Thursday one happen?

741
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,520
I'm going effe shower.
What a news.

742
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,320
Go along.

743
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,320
Make sure you never feel you
loss of humor.

744
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,720
I'm going Dyson's house.

745
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,080
We go on Thursday.
The weekend was so much better?

746
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,400
Thursday,
I feel it in my crotch.

747
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:27,320
I am getting dizzy when I
to cross your mind. But Sloth...

748
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,000
He can get the plague.
Who invented it? He or I?

749
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,080
And we do it on Thursday.
I dream about it already.

750
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:41,680
This guy has fixed billions
bodyguards, and alarm systems.

751
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,360
And then we go inside.
It's too simple.

752
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,640
Simple is good.

753
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,240
That gives confidence.

754
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:54,600
Why do you take the gun?
Then we might ask.

755
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:00,200
I'm so nervous.
Coco, you can shoot better than me.

756
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,080
And it's just a precaution.

757
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,680
You would not kill me.

758
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,440
What did I do?

759
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,920
Benjamin?

760
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,440
Hornbeck?
Go ahead, Rickles.

761
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,320
Fuck my wife, eh?

762
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:38,520
You called her when you felt like.
You told her wonderful stories.

763
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,800
And all
behind my back. Why?

764
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,640
Fuck.
That's not the right answer.

765
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,400
Go ahead, Rickles.

766
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,160
Feet.

767
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,440
I put his hands
in the freezer, Senator.

768
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,560
Enough!

769
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,240
Enough? Enough?

770
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,960
This is far from over,
dirty bastard.

771
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,160
We have yet to begin.

772
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:53,120
Smell that burning flesh.
Smell it.

773
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,440
Because that is the last
you'll smell.

774
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:01,600
Think about your business and all that money
you did not spend it.

775
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,880
Was it worth it for a few
hours with my wife?

776
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,200
You said you loved her?

777
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,400
She whispered sweet nothings?

778
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:19,720
Did she say that she night
told me exactly the same?

779
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,640
She did not like you.
Could not.

780
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,040
But she did love you.

781
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,200
Because you're so special,
right?

782
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,320
I gave her.
You respected her.

783
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,840
You respected her,
once a week...

784
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,480
With your cock in her face.
You're disgusting.

785
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,320
Make your excuses, dick.

786
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,440
Why did you kill her?
Because you loved her?

787
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,560
Apologies.

788
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:03,200
I do not make excuses.
Make your apology.

789
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,520
You're nothing.

790
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,320
I'm so sorry.

791
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,720
911.

792
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,400
My name is Ben Dyson.

793
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,320
Yesterday I kidnapped.

794
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,440
Can you an ambulance
to this address?

795
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,360
Go away.

796
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,800
Go away now.

797
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,920
I stay here.

798
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,800
I want of you.

799
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,080
Please.

800
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,680
I've never seen before.

801
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,360
I do not know who you are.

802
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,360
You get a nice new nose,
really.

803
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:44,400
An ambulance to
Ellroy Street 551 5.

804
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,760
They send almost everyone.
Where?

805
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,920
Dyson who has just called a 91.

806
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,200
Alive?
When he called it.

807
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:59,080
551 5?
Which way is it?

808
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,120
Beyond the cemetery.

809
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,280
Your ankle is broken.
Take her to the hospital.

810
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,600
What happened to your ankle?

811
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,480
Why?
Can I borrow your plaster?

812
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,600
Do yourself a favor and 'm
before you really hurt.

813
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:02,440
Just out of curiosity.
Is there a mop in?

814
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:07,440
Wax? Sponges?
No horseplay.

815
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,080
Talk to the boss.
I go inside.

816
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:14,120
This does not happen.
I go inside.

817
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,040
Not at all.
Friedman, now go away.

818
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,840
Otherwise I'll kill you too?

819
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:26,280
Damn, Friedman.
Let me do my job well.

820
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:31,120
This is not personal.
And I can tell you why.

821
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,640
Because you are not a person.
I go inside.

822
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,880
This is an FBI investigation,
Detective Grimes.

823
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,640
Thanks for your help.
I will mention in my report.

824
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:21,960
All units to
Ellroy Street 551 5.

825
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,480
Isla Margarita - three months later

826
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,000
I do not want a rum and coke.

827
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:13,200
I want a piña colada.

828
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:19,920
You look like you see a ghost.
Too much.

829
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,440
How you doing, honey?

830
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,680
I'm still alive.

831
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,800
But not you.

832
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:58,120
Dear Jesus, "what you sow,
ye reap, "they say.

833
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,640
But in life
Not much to harvest.

834
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,720
I learn less and less and there
I always get more regrets.

835
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,040
I have the most dangerous
things done.

836
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,960
Maybe we all a second chance.

837
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:17,760
Personally I doubt that.
But I will keep you informed.
