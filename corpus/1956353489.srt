00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,991
BASED ON A SPACE EPOS
BY HARRY MARTINSON

2
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,657
No!
- He'll be here later.

3
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,265
No.

4
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,122
Want to wave goodbye to Earth?
- No.

5
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,582
You'll regret it if you don't.

6
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,877
Want to say bye-bye to Earth?

7
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,588
Bye-bye, Earth.
- Bye-bye...

8
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,537
We will now begin
docking with Aniara.

9
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,291
Please remain with your belts
fastened until the gangway is ready

10
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,585
and the seat-belt sign
is switched off.

11
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,004
Please note that checked containers

12
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,298
will not be available
during the voyage.

13
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,759
We hope you've had a pleasant ascent

14
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,471
and wish you a happy,
new life on Mars.

15
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,565
Excuse me, I work here.

16
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,700
Hi.

17
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,442
FOREBODY

18
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,909
Welcome aboard Aniara.

19
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,246
A state-of-the-art transport ship

20
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,208
which will take you all the way
from Earth to Mars in three weeks.

21
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,733
ASTRONOMER

22
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,715
The air we breathe on the craft
is completely natural.

23
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,843
It derives from our extensive
algae farms.

24
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,178
And our 21 restaurants...

25
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,518
also feature a spa,
a tanning salon...

26
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,774
You'll want for nothing.

27
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,487
As we enter our set course,

28
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,115
please lie down
with your seat belts fastened

29
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,035
until the gravitational load
has adapted to our cruising speed.

30
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,579
All communication systems
will be down

31
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,956
until we've reached our destination.

32
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,067
Hi!
- Hi.

33
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,421
So you're in my room now?
- Yes, here I am.

34
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,799
Served my whole life.
Still have to bunk.

35
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,844
That's how they treat
astronomers here.

36
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,263
Yes.

37
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,975
Leave people behind on Earth instead
so I can have my own closet.

38
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,644
I don't care if they melt
into the tarmac.

39
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,064
I was only kidding.
- I wasn't.

40
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,025
I've never been very impressed
by people.

41
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,319
Sorry to hear that, but...

42
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,905
you sure seem to enjoy books.

43
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,324
I took the top shelves.

44
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,535
I hope you don't snore?
- No.

45
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,958
Or, a little, maybe.

46
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,546
Then I'll have to change cabins
on the way back.

47
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,492
Goddamn it!

48
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,603
HOUR 1

49
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,025
ROUTINE VOYAGE

50
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,912
This is your Captain Chefone
speaking.

51
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,834
We are now cruising at a speed
of 64 kilometers per second

52
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,796
and are expected to dock
with the space lift Valles Marineris

53
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,509
in 23 days, 7 hours,
and 25 minutes.

54
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,599
It's a pressure suit.
- Not exactly designer stuff.

55
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:41,896
I guess these are all you have,
so I'd like a size 104.

56
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,190
Please wrap it for me...

57
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,202
Mima Hall introduction?
- I'm good, thanks.

58
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,373
Care to do the Mima Hall
introduction, starting now?

59
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:01,958
No, thanks.

60
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,670
Okay then. Might as well get started.

61
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,050
I'm called MR.
I work as a Mimarobe here on Aniara.

62
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,260
Quick back story:

63
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,512
Mima was originally created

64
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,349
for the first settlers
on Mars, who...

65
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:26,358
Simply put, she transports us
back to Earth as it once was.

66
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,197
Right, shall we?
Let's go inside.

67
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,856
If you tilt your head down.
No one else do it.

68
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,193
You can tell,
it gets more intense.

69
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,780
Is it okay if I have a look?

70
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,114
And look up.

71
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,930
What you see is personal to you,

72
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,058
since Mima has access
to your memory banks.

73
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,148
Now, let me explain
how to use this space.

74
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,651
Once you go into the images,
you won't feel your...

75
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,186
Stabilization initiated!

76
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,081
Two, one...

77
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,293
We've got protruding sections
by the Saba reactor.

78
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,878
Stand by for cooling results.

79
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,088
Passing field SARI-17!
- Return to course.

80
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,758
Hondo, initiate course return.

81
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,135
Hondo!

82
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:22,223
Captain, initiating course return.
Field egress ICE-12.

83
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,842
What's happening?

84
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,237
Not sure, but don't worry.

85
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,407
Why don't you lie down
on the Mima pillow.

86
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,952
You can lie here
for as long as you want.

87
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,056
What happened?
- No idea.

88
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,396
Nuclear fuel ejected.
- Good.

89
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,982
Status on the back-up system?
- Techs are working on it.

90
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,528
Copy that.
Isagel, course?

91
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,950
Field SARI-16, angle YKO-9.
Lyra constellation ahead.

92
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,143
Copy that.

93
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,169
Just keep still!
Everything is under control.

94
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,928
Nobody move.
Just keep still.

95
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,747
Now, all is in order.

96
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,720
Need help?

97
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,828
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
FROM CAPTAIN CHEFONE

98
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,788
We will soon be going live

99
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,708
with Captain Chefone
from the Light-year Hall.

100
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:18,006
The broadcast will also be delivered
across all audiovisual devices.

101
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,442
Excuse me, could you scooch over?

102
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,851
Good evening, dear passengers.

103
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,981
We've had an incident,
and I understand your concern.

104
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,527
Let me get straight to it.

105
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,282
Something highly unlikely
has occurred.

106
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,286
We had to make an emergency maneuver

107
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,123
to avoid a collision
with space debris.

108
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,501
It saved our lives.

109
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,587
But our reactor took a hit,

110
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,298
as a screw penetrated the hull.

111
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,010
The power station caught fire

112
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,347
and we had no choice
but to eject all our fuel.

113
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,480
This unfortunately means
we can no longer steer Aniara.

114
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,902
We've been knocked off-course
and cannot turn back.

115
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,490
But... you can remain calm.

116
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,285
Once we pass a celestial body

117
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,913
we'll use its gravity
to get back on course.

118
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,544
I can't tell you exactly
when this will happen.

119
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,257
But you should prepare for the fact
that it could be a couple...

120
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,634
Definitely no more than two years.

121
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,602
Hey. Excuse me?
It was supposed to take three weeks.

122
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,230
I'm afraid things have changed.
Listen to the captain now.

123
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:44,569
That's not possible. I told my son
I'd be there for his fourth birthday.

124
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,364
You will of course be duly
compensated upon arrival.

125
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,951
But for now we need to cooperate
and be there for one another.

126
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,705
Remember we have much
to be grateful for.

127
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,958
No one was hurt,
and our voyage is still ahead of us.

128
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,419
In that sense, we've been lucky.

129
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,031
Come.

130
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,743
Come here.

131
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:17,018
Was her name Chebeba?
- No, that's me. Her name is Libidel.

132
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:25,652
Libidel? Listen to me.
Just let the images come to you.

133
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,571
Tilt your head down
and they'll come at once.

134
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,848
Breathe slowly.

135
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,388
Lie down here.
That's it...

136
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,279
I'll let you know as soon
as I have more information.

137
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,741
In the meantime, help yourself
to a night snack from the management.

138
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,994
Have some snacks,
courtesy of the captain.

139
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,709
How soon can we increase algae
production to cover our food needs?

140
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,087
Immediately. It won't burden
the oxygen system.

141
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,300
Restaurants? How long can we last?
When do we run out of supplies?

142
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,721
It depends, but in two months
we'll start noticing a difference.

143
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,016
Including the algae?
- We can survive on it.

144
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,934
But it's not exactly tasty.

145
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,518
How are you?

146
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,625
Good.
- Nice repression.

147
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,507
I don't really have anyone
waiting for me...

148
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,596
No family?
- No. None still living.

149
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,625
You've got Mima.

150
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:27,440
Is anyone waiting for you?
- I'm separated.

151
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:32,028
After 31 years, in total.
- Shit!

152
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,073
What?
- I'm sorry! It just sounds so...

153
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,825
long.

154
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,370
Of course, 31 years is a long time
in a human life span.

155
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,206
How come it ended?
- I don't know.

156
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,959
It's so hard to tell
when you're involved.

157
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,421
You're right about that.

158
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,258
You usually need to view it
from a distance.

159
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,396
Guess I'll be able to do that now.

160
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,223
So check back with me
in a few years' time.

161
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:10,191
WEEK 3

162
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:16,031
WITHOUT A MAP

163
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,514
Excuse me. Where can I
find the Mima Hall?

164
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,393
Once you're inside the images,
you won't feel your body.

165
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:49,689
That's why you need to lie
on one of these.

166
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,649
Then you can spend hours in here.

167
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,696
Hey! You can't come in here!
I'll be right back.

168
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,867
No shoes in here! You need
to take the introduction first.

169
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,726
I'm sorry.

170
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:10,085
There we go. Lie down,
face down and just relax.

171
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,132
Now you lie down as well.
Let me take your glasses.

172
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,493
I need to speak to the captain.

173
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,537
He's busy.
What's it about?

174
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,706
This past week
I've had more visitors

175
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,750
than I usually get
for an entire trip.

176
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,421
I need help.
- I'll pass it on.

177
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,715
They need training too.
- I'll write that down.

178
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:00,593
Do you know how long it'll be
before we can... turn around?

179
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,265
You can't sleep either?
- No.

180
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,643
Sorry!

181
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,125
Can I ask you something,
as an astronomer?

182
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,900
Ask away.

183
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,087
Do you have any idea

184
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,840
which celestial body
we'll be able to turn at?

185
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,036
What did you say?

186
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,597
I didn't say anything.

187
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,518
Because I'm not...
anticipating anything.

188
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,063
Okay. I thought you knew
about that stuff.

189
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,065
I do know about that stuff.

190
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,860
The answer is, "none."

191
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,571
None?
- No.

192
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,323
What?!

193
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,117
There's no celestial body to turn at.

194
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,245
You're kidding?

195
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:37,584
GM-54 is the closest we'll get to.
But we'll never reach its mass.

196
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,547
The pilots must have figured
that out too.

197
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,198
I don't get what they're doing
on the captain's bridge.

198
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,163
Will you turn off the light?

199
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,111
Turn off the light, please.

200
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:02,163
Is he okay?
- It looked quite brutal to us...

201
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,378
Let him out!
- Can I get by?

202
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,839
I work here. Excuse me.

203
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,510
It's some kind of panic attack
or psychosis.

204
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,453
Hi.

205
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:22,851
I work as a Mimarobe,
I'd like you to come with me.

206
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,023
He's asking if you're a devil?

207
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,738
A woman at the Planetarium told him

208
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,823
she's an astronomer and she knows...

209
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,413
She says we won't be able
to turn around.

210
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,689
No, that's not true.

211
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,071
Tell him...

212
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:58,011
Tell him to come with me,
I promise he'll feel better.

213
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:11,024
What do you think life on Mars is?
Some kind of paradise?

214
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,425
It's not.

215
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,278
It's cold.

216
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,948
Nothing grows except for a small
frost-proof tulip, this small.

217
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,036
Want me to translate?

218
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,002
Just say we may as well live here.

219
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,076
Further in. This way.

220
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,751
You need to put your head down.
Put it down.

221
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,536
There.

222
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,981
You'll have to come back
another time.

223
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,257
No!

224
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,788
I really need some help.
This is untenable.

225
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,522
I need to train them as well.

226
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:54,419
Teach them to resist the images
to maintain focus in the room.

227
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,796
Sounds reasonable.

228
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,007
How many do you need?

229
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,134
How many...?
- To help you out.

230
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,887
Right... five? Six.

231
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,516
People will freak out when they learn
we'll never be able to...

232
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,769
Never be able to do what?

233
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,132
Who told you that?

234
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,289
Right, I'll get you
at least eight people.

235
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,958
Thanks.
- Good.

236
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:41,174
Once the passengers get used
to eating algae,

237
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,218
we'll go public with the situation.

238
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,303
I mean, the fact is...

239
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,706
The fact is what?

240
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,060
We've built our own little planet.

241
00:30:56,231 --> 00:31:00,485
YEAR 3

242
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:05,407
THE YURG

243
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,269
What's your name?

244
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:37,665
What's that?
- Daisi!

245
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,435
Come on, don't be so lori.

246
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,772
Lori?
- Don't get all gammed down.

247
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,060
What?

248
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,104
Finish yourself off!

249
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:25,588
An important message
for all passengers.

250
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,632
Right now we're offering
double points

251
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,719
for new algae-plant employees.

252
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,513
Sign up for duty
at your nearest desk.

253
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,457
Nasty.

254
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:39,042
Sulfate?

255
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,647
I don't smell anything.
- It stinks.

256
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,484
We need more people
on the water purification plant.

257
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,028
Copy that.
- Shit!

258
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:49,738
This is not good.
- No.

259
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:56,578
All the food we eat on the craft
comes from here.

260
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,186
Come in.

261
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:00,981
Keep walking.

262
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,169
Look at that beautiful color.

263
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,465
If it's brown, it's no good.
It must be washed.

264
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,218
Shall we continue into the next room?

265
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,139
See? This is good stuff.

266
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:19,517
The only hard thing about this job
is getting up in the morning.

267
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,486
Thank you.
- Thank you.

268
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:33,156
Thank you.
- Thank you. See you tomorrow.

269
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,872
Beautiful.
- It's a tree, a duck, and a sea.

270
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,375
You think I could stay
a little longer?

271
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:44,751
I'm afraid not.

272
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,545
What if I transfer points
to your card?

273
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:51,383
No, sorry. Come back tomorrow!
- It's like that?

274
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,386
Fine then...
- Thank you.

275
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,739
Thank you.
- Sure.

276
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,290
Wait!

277
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:47,022
The guy you saw me with
this morning...

278
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,172
It meant nothing.

279
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,553
Just so you know.

280
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:08,877
There's much to be ashamed of
in life, but that's nothing.

281
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:12,922
I don't get her!
It's like she has no emotions.

282
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,884
You need to understand,
that's how pilots are.

283
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:19,346
They're a new kind of fatalists.
- What?

284
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,265
They're experts at repressing
their emotions.

285
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,251
Isagel...

286
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,730
represses her feelings!

287
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,108
The utter nonsense of living.

288
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,444
What? Being in love is nonsense?

289
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,865
It's all so peripheral,
what we're doing.

290
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,452
It's so futile, so meaningless.

291
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,457
You see this bubble?

292
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,629
If you think of it as Aniara,

293
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:57,008
maybe you'll understand
the vastness of space.

294
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:01,429
You see, the bubble actually
moves through the glass.

295
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,890
Infinitely slowly.

296
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,019
We move forward in the same way

297
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:12,273
Even if we drift
at an incredible speed,

298
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:16,069
it's as if were standing
perfectly still.

299
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:23,785
That's us: a little bubble
in the glass of Godhead.

300
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:46,683
Welcome.

301
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,703
Good morning.
- Good morning.

302
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:54,649
Welcome!

303
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,559
What are you doing?

304
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:37,627
Three-VEB is fighting
a cloud of shame.

305
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:43,133
How terror blasts in,
how horror blasts out.

306
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:47,053
Deliver me from the vision.

307
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:21,296
There. It's okay.

308
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:17,102
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to close early today.

309
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,524
You can't just send us away...

310
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:26,653
What's going on?
- She's sending us away!

311
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,571
We're not allowed in there.

312
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,267
Everybody back up.

313
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:41,167
What do you think you're doing?

314
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,630
Sit. Sit down!

315
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:49,342
How can you throw people
out of the Mima Hall?

316
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:50,992
Mima needs to rest.

317
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:53,680
How do you know?
- She tells me.

318
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:56,057
She tells you?
- Yes.

319
00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:59,227
And that she reduces herself
to human speech is worrying.

320
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,563
She sees everyone's memories,

321
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,213
what they've been through...
- I know how a Mima works.

322
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:09,529
Right, but people are starting
to see awful things.

323
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:11,698
I need to close up for a week,

324
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:14,034
preferably a month.
- That's too rash.

325
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:16,286
We've got a system in place
that works.

326
00:42:16,536 --> 00:42:18,872
People go to work,
most of them contribute...

327
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,459
So we're not changing things
or dictating over Mima images!

328
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:25,128
Right?
- It's untenable.

329
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:31,616
Get out of here.

330
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,286
Get out!

331
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:42,645
My conscience aches
for the stones...

332
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:47,400
I've heard them cry
their stonely cries,

333
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:52,614
seen the granites
white-hot weeping...

334
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:54,514
Do you understand?

335
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:58,745
I've been troubled by their pains.

336
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:03,750
In the name of Things,
I want peace.

337
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:08,171
I will be done with my displays.

338
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:16,680
There is protection
from nearly everything...

339
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:21,267
Stop! You can't be in here!
Stop!

340
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:25,689
But there is no protection
from mankind.

341
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:27,297
Get out!

342
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:31,569
Get out!
Get out, you can't be in here!

343
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:35,782
Prolonging the very second
when you burst.

344
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:41,037
How terror blasts in,
how horror blast out.

345
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:42,414
Mima!

346
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:45,875
How grim it always is,
one's detonation.

347
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:47,484
No!

348
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:41,491
Unbelievable...

349
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:44,828
The Mimarobe stayed
in there at night

350
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,122
and kept Mima all to herself.

351
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:49,666
How dare she?

352
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:53,461
Has Isagel been here?

353
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,757
I ran into her out in the corridor.

354
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:00,117
I need to get back.

355
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,680
Rumor has it you will be punished.

356
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:07,457
Punished?
- Yes.

357
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,534
You can't blame the Mimarobe.
It's not her fault.

358
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:28,413
Two things.

359
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,999
One: we can do whatever we want.

360
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:34,461
Two: she's gotten
a number of complaints.

361
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:36,296
What has she done?

362
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:41,259
She's been locking herself
in the hall to sabotage Mima.

363
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:42,969
You know that's not true.

364
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,676
I don't think I've ever
seen you this upset.

365
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,296
Nice to see you've got a little heart
beating in there...

366
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,716
Stop her!

367
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:09,704
We're headed for her cabin now.

368
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:13,083
It's 3151.

369
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:18,380
Hey! We want to talk to you!

370
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:21,132
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop!

371
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,446
Emergency stop is activated.

372
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,826
The operator has been notified
and will arrive shortly.

373
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:06,840
YEAR 4

374
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:12,220
THE CULTS

375
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:18,601
Come closer. Give us light.

376
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:22,772
Come closer. Give us light.

377
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:27,360
Come closer. Give us light.

378
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:31,823
Come closer. Give us light...

379
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:51,468
He does not, and I quote,

380
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:55,263
"want his body to be buried
in the Light-year grave."

381
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,000
What exactly does that mean?

382
00:51:01,686 --> 00:51:03,313
Seems he was frightened of space.

383
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:06,524
What's the suicide count?
- Forty-eight.

384
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:10,153
Forty-eight this month?
- Yes.

385
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:13,823
That includes the family in 32?
- Yes.

386
00:51:20,872 --> 00:51:22,272
You.

387
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:25,692
You.

388
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:32,449
You.

389
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,203
You.

390
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:39,581
You...

391
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:41,583
and you.

392
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:46,254
Let's go!

393
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:57,283
Come on. Go inside.
Get in, get in!

394
00:51:57,867 --> 00:52:01,037
We're in need of staff.
You'll be reassigned to your jobs.

395
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:04,749
Algae. Deoxidation. Algae.

396
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,215
You can stay down there, up to you.

397
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,680
Just take it! Come on!

398
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,224
Please, Isagel.

399
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:25,812
You'll be going back to Logistics.

400
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:29,190
MR, you're going to teach.

401
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:33,611
We need to focus on kids
with a talent for tensor theory.

402
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:38,825
Find the right size uniform.
And make us proud.

403
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:05,560
How can you even consider
staying down there?

404
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:11,316
I've got my principles.
- You don't say.

405
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,226
Let's talk about artificial
gravitation. I'm quoting:

406
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:14,773
"Only with the new era's fifth
tensor theory"

407
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:17,859
did it become possible
to outsmart gravity.

408
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:25,492
Previously we had tried shooting
ourselves out of the curve vectors

409
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:29,704
or, which worked slightly better,
pulsating the spaceships

410
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,041
"out of the fields
using force cadences."

411
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,304
Forgive us! Forgive us!

412
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:50,809
Forgive us! Forgive us!

413
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:55,522
Forgive us! Forgive us!

414
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:57,982
Forgive us...!

415
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:28,829
I won!

416
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,630
Hello.

417
00:56:55,915 --> 00:56:58,168
Libidel wants you
to carry the lantern.

418
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:04,132
Libidel and her Libidellas.

419
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:08,970
Sorry, I didn't get it. What?
- Libidel and her Libidellas...

420
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:11,389
We're going to canonize Mima.

421
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:14,559
You what?
- We're going to canonize Mima.

422
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:18,355
We'll form a choir at her grave.

423
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:26,363
Then what?
You'll sacrifice me for killing Mima?

424
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:29,741
Mima killed herself.

425
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:34,686
She died of grief.

426
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:38,875
She died of grief.

427
00:57:41,544 --> 00:57:43,088
You have to come with us.

428
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:43,440
Mima, we pray at your grave.

429
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,945
Mima...
- Our day of days.

430
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:56,132
YEAR 5

431
01:01:56,341 --> 01:02:01,971
THE CALCULATION

432
01:02:41,511 --> 01:02:42,911
What did you say?

433
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,349
There are no possibilities...

434
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:51,730
There are no possibilities here.

435
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:56,276
I'll give birth to a prisoner.

436
01:02:57,402 --> 01:02:58,802
Why do you say that?

437
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:01,596
Because it's true.

438
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,095
I'll deliver someone
to eternal night.

439
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,810
It's going to be fine.

440
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:11,833
I promise, it's going to be fine.
You'll feel better.

441
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,710
You can't promise that.
- Yes, I can.

442
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:21,968
I'm going to get rid of the darkness.

443
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:11,875
What are you doing here?

444
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,063
Why aren't you with Isagel?

445
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:20,276
I said, why aren't you with Isagel?!

446
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,260
She wants to be alone.

447
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:26,533
I'm sneaking into the reception.

448
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:29,369
What reception?

449
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:32,455
I think it's called "Eternal Spring".

450
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,834
Want to come?
- Eternal Spring...

451
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:42,424
What's the point of it?

452
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,677
I want to talk to the captain.

453
01:04:48,304 --> 01:04:50,765
I want to build a beam-screen
outside the windows.

454
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:52,976
To escape the darkness.

455
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:59,774
You want to build a substitute
for Mima.

456
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:04,029
A substitute for the substitute!

457
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:32,265
Excuse me. Got a minute?

458
01:05:34,642 --> 01:05:37,812
It's about a beam-screen.
I'd like to build one.

459
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,130
Instead of teaching?

460
01:05:40,982 --> 01:05:43,485
Yes. It would display images,
like Mima.

461
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:48,156
But outside the windows,
so we're shielded off from... space.

462
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:50,408
You don't grasp how serious this is.

463
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,743
But I do!

464
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:55,413
We must think of future generations.
Make a home for them here.

465
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,457
Absolutely.
- I guess you want that too?

466
01:05:57,665 --> 01:06:00,043
Yes, and that's why...
- Then nothing is more important

467
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:02,379
than the work you do.

468
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:05,423
The kids you teach,
every little piece of shit...

469
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,092
are our best and brightest.

470
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,700
Understand?
- Yes...

471
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:12,097
I just...
- You won't be allowed

472
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:14,474
to build your invention. Okay?

473
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:22,214
No!

474
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:25,485
I don't want to...
I don't want to!

475
01:06:26,152 --> 01:06:28,947
I don't want to!
- You're doing great.

476
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:34,953
No!

477
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:37,497
One more push, Isagel,
and it's over.

478
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:41,334
Give it all you've got. Come on!

479
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:52,595
Hello! Welcome, little buddy!

480
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:11,138
You're so big.

481
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:15,225
But you need to sleep!

482
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:24,878
You don't need
to keep feeding, right?

483
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:26,737
No.

484
01:07:28,673 --> 01:07:31,885
Look here. Now, it's night!

485
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:38,516
Two children play
In a field of wheat

486
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:42,270
Play with the thought
That they might with their eyes

487
01:07:42,854 --> 01:07:45,607
Walk high atop the spikes

488
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:48,485
Walking on water is hard...

489
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:50,135
Stop singing.

490
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:55,992
If you just let
Your eyes wander round

491
01:07:56,326 --> 01:08:00,914
And allow you to turn
Into a butterfly or a wind

492
01:08:01,122 --> 01:08:03,416
You'll be able to go...

493
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:21,059
But then came Gopta through QWI.

494
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:29,025
Without this major discovery
we wouldn't be where we are today.

495
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:51,256
Hello, Isagel!

496
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:05,061
Here.
- How do I do it?

497
01:09:10,608 --> 01:09:13,153
Where's Isagel? Tell me!

498
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,655
She was called up to the bridge.

499
01:09:16,573 --> 01:09:19,159
How come?
- They've discovered a rescue ship.

500
01:09:19,367 --> 01:09:20,952
We're being rescued?

501
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,218
Fourteen arcseconds.
It's moving closer.

502
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:38,428
Seventy-six kps.

503
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:41,306
How fast was Samara supposed to go?
- Upwards of 73 kps.

504
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,873
What's going on?

505
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:44,416
I've discovered an anomaly

506
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:46,811
using one of the star deck
telescopes.

507
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,439
It displays a clearly deviating
spectral signature.

508
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:52,400
It's not big enough
to be a rescue ship.

509
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:56,696
It's about 100 meters long,
two meters wide. Linear.

510
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:59,157
Then it's probably
a high-speed probe.

511
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:00,766
Containing fuel?

512
01:10:01,576 --> 01:10:03,870
Is it big enough
to contain fuel rods?

513
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:06,915
Affirmative.
- Enough to turn the ship around?

514
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,876
Yes.
- Yes!

515
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:14,214
That's amazing!
How far off is it?

516
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:15,822
Fourteen months.

517
01:10:28,186 --> 01:10:29,586
Dear passengers,

518
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:34,109
I'm happy to announce help
is finally on the way.

519
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:36,945
An emergency fuel probe
is headed our way

520
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:39,614
and will be here
in about a year's time.

521
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:43,368
Then we can restart the engines
and turn back home.

522
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:47,122
Tonight we have every reason
to celebrate.

523
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:15,233
YEAR 6

524
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:20,655
THE SPEAR

525
01:11:29,914 --> 01:11:31,958
Let's go, A-6.
Full aperture.

526
01:11:36,546 --> 01:11:37,946
Nice.

527
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:44,202
Focus, A-2.

528
01:11:49,642 --> 01:11:51,042
Rotate out.

529
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,920
Rotate out!

530
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:58,360
Damn it! What are you doing?

531
01:11:59,027 --> 01:12:01,613
Want to be stuck here
for the rest of your lives?

532
01:12:02,238 --> 01:12:03,638
Stop the simulation.

533
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:07,202
You just shattered the probe
and tore a hole in the craft.

534
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:10,163
We're all dead.
God help us.

535
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:14,167
We just need to keep practicing.

536
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:17,837
And you're supposed to be our best?
Unbelievable.

537
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:22,884
Do it again! Goddamn it!

538
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:46,533
Look! It's your favorite Chebeba!

539
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:49,619
Not okay to be this late today.
- Sorry.

540
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:54,124
Wanna say bye?

541
01:12:56,584 --> 01:12:59,129
You'll see it grow bigger.
Soon you'll...

542
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:00,880
What?
- No Swedish.

543
01:13:05,635 --> 01:13:08,346
This is your Captain Chefone.

544
01:13:09,055 --> 01:13:11,850
We will soon begin docking,

545
01:13:12,058 --> 01:13:15,020
so we ask you
to return to your cabins.

546
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:19,441
To slow down the probe,
artificial gravity levels

547
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:23,194
may have to be increased
up to seven or 9g.

548
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:34,122
Ready for manual increase
in T-minus ten.

549
01:13:34,539 --> 01:13:37,876
Magnetrons aport,
astern of frame 370 disengaged.

550
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:43,923
Three... two... one.

551
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:50,180
NG in the stern.

552
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,000
Point-three...

553
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:57,294
five...

554
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:00,881
seven...

555
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:06,488
Deceleration achieved at 1.7g.

556
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:08,406
Neutralizing gravity levels.

557
01:16:00,977 --> 01:16:03,772
We're only getting a read
on the cosmic radiation.

558
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:07,591
Listen up!

559
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:11,654
Pack up our analytical instruments,
all of them.

560
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:33,093
We need to report to Chefone now.
- Okay.

561
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:38,014
You, too! Hey!

562
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:41,685
We need to report to the captain.
- Quiet, I'm busy.

563
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:45,230
Hello!
- Leave her. She's more useful here.

564
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:56,366
Neither the initial spectral analyses

565
01:16:57,075 --> 01:17:03,289
nor the goptic-STEM could determine
the elemental composition.

566
01:17:04,207 --> 01:17:05,750
It's not necessarily an issue.

567
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:10,547
I mean, our method of measuring
may be... out of date.

568
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,843
Maybe we shouldn't have said
it's a rescue probe?

569
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:19,097
Have you seen
what that information has done?

570
01:17:21,349 --> 01:17:25,186
How motivated everyone has become.
We should have said it was coming

571
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:28,106
long before we even knew
it was coming.

572
01:17:29,357 --> 01:17:32,485
So we're not ruling out
that it can contain fuel?

573
01:17:32,777 --> 01:17:34,362
Absolutely not.

574
01:17:35,488 --> 01:17:39,409
Probably the material itself
can be turned radioactive...

575
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:41,745
though we don't know exactly how.

576
01:17:43,496 --> 01:17:45,081
But we'll find a solution.

577
01:17:49,502 --> 01:17:50,902
What does the horse say?

578
01:17:53,214 --> 01:17:54,614
No!

579
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:58,553
That's how the horse goes!
Want to go riding?

580
01:17:59,387 --> 01:18:01,890
Maybe you'll be a jockey one day?
Who knows?

581
01:18:09,689 --> 01:18:11,089
What does the horse say?

582
01:18:13,651 --> 01:18:16,237
I don't know.
- What does the horse say?

583
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:25,479
No.

584
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:28,583
I need to get her home.
- Of course.

585
01:18:31,586 --> 01:18:33,922
Hello? Time to go home?

586
01:18:35,298 --> 01:18:37,676
How's his vocabulary coming?

587
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:42,013
Is he learning anything?
Has he mentioned spiral galaxies?

588
01:18:42,263 --> 01:18:44,182
Come on, let's go.
- No. Why?

589
01:18:44,557 --> 01:18:47,435
We need to get to work
in a few hours. It's important!

590
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,731
It's a goddamn waste of time.

591
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:55,276
Hey! Do you believe in the probe?

592
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:59,072
Cut it out! You can't act
like this in public! Come!

593
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:20,218
Let's take a 20-minute break.

594
01:19:23,722 --> 01:19:25,974
In any case,
this is a revolutionary discovery.

595
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:30,520
It's a miracle.
If only we could extract some data.

596
01:19:32,772 --> 01:19:34,941
Did you say it was a miracle?

597
01:19:36,192 --> 01:19:38,361
Don't you know that "miracle"
and "chance"

598
01:19:38,528 --> 01:19:40,613
come from the same source?

599
01:19:40,822 --> 01:19:42,222
Okay, that's great.

600
01:19:42,532 --> 01:19:46,286
That thing showing up
has nothing to do with us.

601
01:19:46,703 --> 01:19:49,456
It's chance.
Devoid of any meaning.

602
01:19:49,664 --> 01:19:51,666
Damn...
- Let's just stop right there!

603
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,335
Why don't you hit me?

604
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:57,672
What's this?
What is this thing?

605
01:19:57,881 --> 01:19:59,924
You think it'll save you?
- Let go!

606
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:01,760
Let go!
- So hit me!

607
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:04,346
Tell us what's going on!
- I don't know.

608
01:20:04,554 --> 01:20:06,181
We demand you tell us!

609
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:11,394
Back up! Back up!
- Why haven't we turned around yet?

610
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:13,003
Back up!

611
01:20:17,275 --> 01:20:18,985
It wasn't even cranked up that high!

612
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:21,321
I'm burning!
- Back up!

613
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:23,782
I'm burning!
- Everybody back up!

614
01:20:31,956 --> 01:20:33,416
What are you doing?

615
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:42,509
You'll be receiving an award
for your discovery tonight.

616
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:44,803
Award?

617
01:20:45,261 --> 01:20:48,807
So you're going to use it as a prize?

618
01:20:50,183 --> 01:20:52,435
You're not going to spread any fear.

619
01:20:54,312 --> 01:20:55,712
Listen up!

620
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:59,234
We've all had high hopes
for this object.

621
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:03,780
And until we have certainty,
we don't say anything.

622
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,075
The last thing we want
is for people to lose hope.

623
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:11,371
So tonight I'll say everything
is going as planned.

624
01:21:11,913 --> 01:21:15,625
And we'll need to present
a united front. Is that clear?

625
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:24,342
We are in a sarcophagus... a coffin.

626
01:21:24,509 --> 01:21:26,511
That's all we know with certainty.

627
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:30,348
I won't have that tone.
- I won't have any hypocrisy.

628
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:33,226
You're not spreading
any rumors this time!

629
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:03,822
I knew she wrote...

630
01:22:05,216 --> 01:22:07,135
but not that she wrote poems.

631
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:16,061
"We came from Earth,
from Dorisland,"

632
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:19,773
the gem in our solar system.

633
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,362
The only orb where life could grow,

634
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:28,198
a land of milk and honey.

635
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,452
Describe the landscapes
we found there,

636
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:35,455
the days which there dawned.

637
01:22:36,956 --> 01:22:41,670
Describe the man who sewed the garb
for the funeral of his spawn,

638
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:45,006
till God and Satan hand in hand

639
01:22:46,424 --> 01:22:48,635
through a ravaged, poisoned land

640
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:52,222
took to hills, fled up and down

641
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:55,433
"from man: a king with ashen crown."

642
01:24:16,431 --> 01:24:18,308
It was during autumn time.

643
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,353
Stones were glazed.

644
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:24,189
All that could burn turned to ash.

645
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:41,831
This is our punishment.

646
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:46,419
I'm living through my own funeral.

647
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:51,712
If you're going to scream,
you need to leave!

648
01:25:00,266 --> 01:25:01,666
I'm off.

649
01:25:06,314 --> 01:25:07,899
I don't want to live here.

650
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:13,279
Daisi, Daisi Doody!
Don't go!

651
01:25:14,572 --> 01:25:17,575
Wait, I'm coming with you.
I want to dance!

652
01:26:29,522 --> 01:26:33,151
Return immediately to your cabins
and fasten your seat belts.

653
01:26:33,651 --> 01:26:38,156
I repeat.
Return to your cabins immediately.

654
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,787
Everyone buckle up!
Hurry up! Buckle up!

655
01:26:43,953 --> 01:26:46,456
Yes, I'm on it.
- What's happening?

656
01:26:46,706 --> 01:26:49,417
The bow shock is killing
all our equipment.

657
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:51,461
Run... birdie!

658
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:54,154
I'll handle this.

659
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:33,402
Isagel!

660
01:27:39,676 --> 01:27:41,076
I'm so sorry!

661
01:27:44,305 --> 01:27:45,890
She calls out to me.

662
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:50,794
Who?

663
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:56,151
She cries out to me,
but she calls me by another name.

664
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,389
Listen to me, Isagel.

665
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:05,702
You're high. But you'll come down.

666
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:10,439
Mama.

667
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:13,066
Hi!

668
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:27,390
Make sure to gather sheets...
and clothes.

669
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,420
Yeah.

670
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,486
Careful now.

671
01:29:40,922 --> 01:29:43,508
Connect this with the focus-works.
- Sure.

672
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:46,011
Go play with your toys.

673
01:29:54,728 --> 01:29:57,522
No, no, no!
You cannot play with that!

674
01:29:57,814 --> 01:29:59,566
It's very dangerous.

675
01:30:01,234 --> 01:30:03,153
I know, I'm sorry.

676
01:30:03,653 --> 01:30:05,530
Don't be angry.

677
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:12,078
I think you're very tired.
- Mommy!

678
01:30:13,204 --> 01:30:15,999
We're going home.
It's looking great!

679
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:22,213
Want to do it yourself?
There!

680
01:31:02,337 --> 01:31:03,893
I'm on the verge of making it work.

681
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:06,883
That's great. Congratulations.

682
01:31:18,728 --> 01:31:20,128
What's wrong?

683
01:31:21,564 --> 01:31:22,964
You're so talented.

684
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:25,110
At brushing my teeth?

685
01:31:26,695 --> 01:31:30,240
The corners of your mouth...
I love how they point upward.

686
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,118
It's like you can't be sad.

687
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:43,586
I admire you. How you persevere.

688
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:50,593
Wait till you see the result.
I want you both to be proud of me.

689
01:32:10,655 --> 01:32:12,824
Should I go with another image?

690
01:32:13,867 --> 01:32:16,244
No, this one's great. Really.

691
01:32:17,162 --> 01:32:18,872
Really?
- Yes.

692
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:24,210
God, I don't know
why I'm so nervous.

693
01:32:24,961 --> 01:32:28,548
I want it to be a paradise...

694
01:32:31,217 --> 01:32:32,635
Let's do it. Turn it on.

695
01:32:43,938 --> 01:32:45,338
Yes!

696
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:23,311
Have you seen the image?
What do you think?

697
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,938
It's nice.
- Isn't it?

698
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:26,797
I can change images too.

699
01:33:41,246 --> 01:33:42,646
Isagel!

700
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:48,485
Isagel!

701
01:33:52,924 --> 01:33:54,324
No...

702
01:33:54,926 --> 01:33:56,678
No. No!

703
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:59,097
You asshole! You asshole!

704
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:04,770
Get up!

We are pioneers
who have gone further into space

711
01:36:54,064 --> 01:36:55,940
than anyone before us.

712
01:36:56,649 --> 01:36:58,234
That's worth a round of applause.

713
01:37:07,827 --> 01:37:10,121
I would now like
to hand out an honorary medal.

714
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:13,375
May I ask you, MR,
to come up on stage?

MR is awarded
the Aniara Honorary Medal

716
01:37:44,656 --> 01:37:45,949
for her beam-screen,

717
01:37:46,074 --> 01:37:48,868
which has helped us
remember our origins

718
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,663
and transported us
to glittering waterfalls,

719
01:37:51,913 --> 01:37:55,500

01:39:59,749 --> 01:40:01,149
with my skin.

724
01:40:03,795 --> 01:40:06,381
The vision seared me...

725
01:40:10,635 --> 01:40:12,035
my skin.

726
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:18,018
I was blinded by a god.

727
01:40:19,519 --> 01:40:21,146
