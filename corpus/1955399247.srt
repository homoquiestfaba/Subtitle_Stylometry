TO GO TO SLEEP.

334
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,192
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING SOME FLAPJACKS.

335
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,217
YOU WANT TO COME
WITH ME?

336
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,362
WELL...

337
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,231
I DON'T--NAH.

338
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,656
YOU COULD SIT HERE

00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,026
YEAH, SURE.

343
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,204
ALL RIGHT.
ONE CONDITION--

344
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,173
NOT A WORD ABOUT

SHE REALLY KNOWS
HOW TO DRESS.

351
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,394
I MEAN, SHE IS PROBABLY
THE BEST DRESSED PERSON

352
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,247

00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,402
ALTHOUGH SOMEONE ELSE
IS GAZING INTO THEM NOW.

356
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,325
IF THE SCENARIO IS HALF
AS BAD AS YOU PAINT IT,

357
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,930
THE ONLY THING
HE'S GAZING INTO

358
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,602
IS THE BACK OF HER HEAD.

359
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,895
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

360
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:59,414
