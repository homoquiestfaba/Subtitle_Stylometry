 all the furniture?

01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,710
-Oh, they could only
 take a half a load.

It's time for me.

01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,190
I'd love to have some
 breakfast with you.

 packed by night.

-Yes, please, my
 hands are no good.

01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,620
-Yes, I noticed.

966
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,680
Did you burn them?

967
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,380
-No, no.

968
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,950
It's arthritis.

969
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:44,680
It, it helps to keep them warm.

970
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,340
-May I make a suggestion?

971
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,490
-Sure, what?

972
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:52,060
-If these gloves help
 to ease the pain,

973
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,160
you can use them
 as a tax deduction.

974
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,240
-Yeah, but they're so cheap.

975
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,460
-Every penny counts.

976
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,880
