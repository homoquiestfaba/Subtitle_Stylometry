1
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:09,042
[eerie music]

2
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:28,696
[music continues]

3
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,865
[horses galloping]

4
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,346
[horse neighing]

5
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,648
[tense music]

6
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:55,883
Howdy, there.

7
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:58,786
Good morning.

8
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,254
Hey, I wonder what
this alfalfa desperado's

9
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,155
got in them boxes?

10
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,434
- [man] I'm not a farmer.
- My mistake.

11
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:16,671
What are you then?

12
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:19,607
I'm a businessman.

13
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,809
[laughing]

14
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,180
Where are you from?

15
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,182
I was born in Europe.

16
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,918
So that's why
you talk like that.

17
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:38,893
Hey, this stuff looks costly.

18
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,327
Come over here and look at this.

19
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:43,665
Don't open any
more boxes, please.

20
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,200
[tense music]

21
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:55,610
Get down,

22
00:02:58,646 --> 00:02:59,847
now!

23
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:00,715
Now!

24
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:12,694
If you haven't figured by now,

25
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,631
we're gonna be taking
your wagon and your supplies.

26
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,468
- [blows thudding]
- [men grunting]

27
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,639
[intense music]

28
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,419
Your friend is bleeding.

29
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,487
You should help him.

30
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,390
[groans]

31
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,392
Don't follow me.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,536
[eerie music]

33
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:23,564
[dramatic orchestral music]

34
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,626
[music continues]

35
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,823
[music continues]

36
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,192
[church bell ringing]

37
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:09,429
[uneasy music]

38
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:14,168
[bell continues ringing]

39
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,482
[horses galloping]

40
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,790
[dramatic music]

41
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,044
[indistinct chattering]

42
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,836
[indistinct chattering]

43
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,909
[horse neighing]

44
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,158
Good afternoon, sir.

45
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,826
I don't mean to
intrude on your day.

46
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,030
You're not.

47
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,166
Would you be so kind to direct
us to the sheriff office?

48
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,939
Tell you what, I'll take
you there myself, Marshal.

49
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,575
That would be
greatly appreciated.

50
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,890
You look very familiar.

51
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,894
You sure? Not many look like me.

52
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:21,796
That's true.

53
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,765
Are you sure
we haven't met before?

54
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,868
Don't think so, let's go.

55
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,713
[man] Now, here's where
I think we should expand first.

56
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:44,185
Build right there.

57
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,720
Huh?

58
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,924
Maybe a new school, so we don't
have to keep using the church.

59
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,793
We could do that,

60
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:55,029
but there aren't that many
children in Blind Chapel yet.

61
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,198
The church works
fine for their schooling.

62
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:00,267
I think we should consider the
expense of expansion, Sheriff.

63
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:02,236
That's why I'm
thinking about a sporting house,

64
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,405
a nice sized one,
hire lots of girls.

65
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,040
That way
we have a sporting house

66
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,042
that gets real
big in the territory,

67
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,910
draws a big crowd every night.

68
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,212
Huh?

69
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,980
A lot better money in that.

70
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,716
The church-going folk
ain't gonna like that, Mayor.

71
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,184
They will when
their wallets get fattened.

72
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,986
Trust me, Sheriff. [chuckles]

73
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,993
Ivan, what can I do for you?

74
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,862
This man needs to
speak to you, Sheriff.

75
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,964
I'm Marshal Austin Carter,

76
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,265
pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

77
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,267
Sheriff Vernon Kelly.

78
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,769
This is Mayor Bowman.

79
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:39,106
This is Deputy Walker,

80
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,774
our prisoner, Ethan Crawley.

81
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,944
We are escorting him
to the town of San Antonio

82
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,679
to face trial for mass murder.

83
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,316
[Sheriff] I heard of him.

84
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,085
[Mayor Bowman] I've heard of
Ethan Crawley, too.

85
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,987
Why'd you bring this
fiend to our town, Marshal?

86
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,322
To be honest with you,

87
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:57,892
I've been riding for
quite a while, all night.

88
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:02,096
The deputy and
I would like to get a meal

89
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,264
and maybe
a couple hours of rest.

90
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,433
Sheriff, if you don't mind,

91
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,068
we'd like to keep our prisoner

92
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,303
in your jail during that time.

93
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:10,938
[Mayor Bowman] Not a chance.

94
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,074
This man's a leader
of the Hellhound Gang,

95
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,309
a bunch of cutthroats.

96
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,379
They're monsters,
ghouls, even cannibals.

97
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,447
They used to ride
with the Quantrill Raiders,

98
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,316
killer of men,
women, and children.

99
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,051
They used to
burn down entire towns.

100
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,052
That's all we need to know.

101
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,354
Now just a damn minute, Mayor.

102
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,691
I'm not gonna be some
coffee boiler for a sheriff.

103
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:33,494
The law gets
respect in this office.

104
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,029
You can lock
your prisoner up here.

105
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,198
Greatly appreciated, Sheriff.

106
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,168
Do you have any
idea what you just did?

107
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:43,304
My job.

108
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,973
Crawley ain't going nowhere.

109
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,241
I'll keep a keen eye on him.

110
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,244
You better pray
nothing bad happens.

111
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,314
- Your job depends on it.
- Oh, yeah?

112
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,049
Who you gonna
run against me, Mayor?

113
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,419
[tense music]

114
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,155
[Mayor Bowman]
Everybody listen up.

115
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,291
No one breathes a word
of this to any of our citizens.

116
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,326
Is that understood?

117
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,071
You son of a Jezebel.

118
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,944
Thank you.

119
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,083
[Marshal] We didn't mean
to get you in trouble, Sheriff.

120
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,818
Don't worry about Mayor Bowman.

121
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,854
I'm used to him pitching a fit,
he's always like this.

122
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,258
Not always,
sometimes he's worse.

123
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,075
[Deputy Walker]
Being that this town is

124
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,044
so close to the Rio Bravo line,

125
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,412
one might assume
it's got a border name.

126
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,483
That's what I thought
when I first arrived here.

127
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,953
How to get to be
being called Blind Chapel?

128
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,789
Hell, I ain't never
even heard of it.

129
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:11,325
I've been told the town's
first preacher was snake bitten,

130
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:12,826
and went blind.

131
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:15,129
He died a few days later.

132
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,064
The townfolk named
town Blind Chapel,

133
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,465
in tribute to him.

134
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,934
[indistinct] 'bout the preacher?

135
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,137
We have a new one now.

136
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,440
What's troubling you, Marshal?

137
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,113
Your mayor is
a little bit excited.

138
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,348
Yeah, everything he said

139
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,283
about Ethan Crawley
and his gang is true.

140
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,119
They're the most vile
collection of miscreants

141
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,321
one could imagine.

142
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:42,156
And I can guarantee

143
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,124
they're gonna want
their leader returned.

144
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:47,161
As you could assume,
we're just a little distrustful

145
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,929
of our environment at all times.

146
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:56,370
You know a place
where we can dine and repose?

147
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,941
Right there, the best biscuits
and gravy I've ever had.

148
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,344
And the meal is free,
as long as you order a beer.

149
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,212
Oh, I think we could do that.

150
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,516
Will you join us, sir?

151
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,051
As long as you call me Ivan.

152
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,153
I can do that, Ivan.

153
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,662
If this ain't the best biscuits
and gravy I've ever had,

154
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,196
then I don't know what is.

155
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,031
It might be kind
to your digestion

156
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,132
if you ate a little bit slower.

157
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,269
Aw, hell Marshal. I could eat
off the same plate as a rattler

158
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,605
and my gut would be just fine.

159
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,140
Where are you from, originally?

160
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:36,477
La France.

161
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,984
You seem to be an educated man.

162
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,153
Where did you study, Ivan?

163
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,555
Military academy.

164
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,224
That's impressive.

165
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:54,061
Myself, I was homeschooled
by my mother,

166
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:58,265
and I can tell you she was
a stickler about education.

167
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,200
What about your father?

168
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,437
He was shot dead
by a drunken man.

169
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:05,906
I was nine.

170
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,642
I'm sorry to hear that.

171
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,144
[Marshal] Thank you.
Tell you the truth,

172
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,914
that's what gave me the
motivation to become a lawman.

173
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:21,121
By the way, how did
you manage to catch Crawley?

174
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:23,123
Well, mostly luck.

175
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,727
I got tipped off by
a whorehouse boss

176
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,296
that Crawley had the lustful
urge for one of his ladies.

177
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:33,300
We went there and
recognized the two guys

178
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,702
in front of his bedroom door.

179
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,605
We sent both of
them in the boneyard.

180
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,275
That we did. And we caught
Crawley naked in bed,

181
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,177
and we placed him under arrest.

182
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,412
You should have seen
the old nanny he was with.

183
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,347
She looked like
the hind end of a buzzard.

184
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,216
[men laughing]

185
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,083
[Deputy Walker] She did.

186
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,555
How is everything?

187
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:56,223
Ma'am, if you fix
these biscuits and gravy,

188
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,458
I'd like to ask you to marry me.

189
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,395
Our cook is
actually an old, grouchy man,

190
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:03,665
[whispers]
who drinks too much whiskey.

191
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,267
And I'm sorry,
but he's already spoken for.

192
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:09,269
Well. [chuckles]

193
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:12,540
How is your day, Arlene?

194
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,743
No complaints,
but I'd like to see you

195
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:16,410
in here more often.

196
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,347
Would you like anything else?

197
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,584
I think we done. Thanks, Arlene.

198
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,158
Have you seen Vernon today?

199
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,193
I'm thinking about
bringing him some supper.

200
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,496
I think you should
wait till little later, Jenny,

201
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,531
he's busy at the moment.

202
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,468
[tense music]

203
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,282
[church bell ringing]

204
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:01,054
What's going on, Sheriff?

205
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,123
These men are Pinkerton agents.

206
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,192
Hello, Marshal.

207
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,327
We're here to escort
your prisoner, Ethan Crawley,

208
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,730
the rest of the way to
the San Antonio prison.

209
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:12,266
[tense music]

210
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,467
Do you mind if
I see your paperwork?

211
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,334
Not at all.

212
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:16,336
Here.

213
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,206
Our orders.

214
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,479
[music continues]

215
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,621
How did you know
Crawley was in Blind Chapel?

216
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:35,489
Marshal here
telegraphed us from Grand Ridge

217
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,357
and asked for our assistance.

218
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,693
We figured
the Marshal and his deputies

219
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,093
would be to your town by now.

220
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:41,796
[Marshal] It is true.

221
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,431
I telegraphed
a request for assistance

222
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,233
from the Pinkerton Agency.

223
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,636
But I thought that you would
meet us on the trail

224
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,437
before we reached
the town of Blind Chapel.

225
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,409
Plans change.

226
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:08,255
I'm not going to
release my prisoner

227
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,124
until we reach
the town of San Antonio.

228
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,695
No problem, we'll ride together.

229
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:18,131
- [guns firing]
- [men grunting]

230
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,371
[woman screaming]

231
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,774
[woman] Help! [grunting]

232
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,543
I'll shoot her.

233
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,879
I'm gonna shoot
this bitch, I swear.

234
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,748
- [gun firing]
- [woman screaming]

235
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:38,385
[dramatic orchestral music]

236
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,869
[woman screaming]

237
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:57,170
I told you Crawley's gang
was coming back, didn't I?

238
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,207
This is just the beginning,
mark my words!

239
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,342
They know he's here,
and they're coming back.

240
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,311
This is your fault.

241
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:07,314
[dog barking]

242
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,317
[Crawley] Your mayor,

243
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:13,186
he's a strange bird,

244
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,423
but he's right about one thing.

245
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:19,226
If my Hellhounds
return to free me,

246
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,261
you are all
gonna be buzzard food.

247
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:22,697
You shut your mouth.

248
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,364
[chuckles]

249
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,269
Vernon, shoot Crawley
if he tries anything, okay?

250
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,605
I'll do exactly that, Ivan.

251
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:40,615
- [horse neighing]
- [dark music]

252
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,591
[kicking door]

253
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,996
Ivan, I heard shooting,
what happened?

254
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,230
- We need Doc Adams.
- He left about a half hour ago

255
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,833
to make some
house calls outside of town.

256
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,801
Then you will help us, Nora.

257
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,407
[Nora] Put him here.

258
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,284
You're hurt, too.

259
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,687
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

260
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:20,755
Sit down, Marshal.

261
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:24,391
[dramatic music]

262
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:28,596
[Ivan] How is he?

263
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,265
Nora?

264
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,901
I can't help him.

265
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:34,969
What do you mean?

266
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,538
[Nora] I'm no doctor
let alone a surgeon,

267
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,707
but he--he's too far gone.

268
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,509
[gasps]

269
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,911
There's nothing to be done?

270
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:45,713
Is there any way
we can get him to the doctor?

271
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,247
Would he make it?

272
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,585
[somber music]

273
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,598
I'm so sorry.

274
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,583
[Nora] I'm sorry.

275
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,488
Deputy Dennis Walker
was a good man.

276
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:32,627
He was a loyal friend,

277
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:37,598
and a great deputy.

278
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:41,434
You'll be missed, my friend.

279
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:45,773
Please, sit down, Marshal.

280
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:48,743
Please.

281
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,817
[groans]

282
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,359
It looks like the bullet
just tore through the flesh

283
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:09,063
and nothing more,
but you're bleeding badly.

284
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:10,497
I need to close that wound.

285
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:23,945
Here, drink this.

286
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,780
It'll numb the pain.
Go on.

287
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,165
How do you feel?

288
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,066
[Marshal]
It works pretty fast.

289
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,237
Take hold of the Marshal.

290
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:51,539
It's important he keeps still.

291
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:53,741
Got it.

292
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:04,685
[eerie music]

293
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,168
[man chuckles] Lookie here.

294
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:39,720
Excuse me, Captain.

295
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,724
The colonel is
still in Blind Chapel.

296
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,060
What the hell happened?

297
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,796
I was watching
from across the street.

298
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,665
Everything seemed fine at first.

299
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:54,068
Your two men had the Pinkerton
gear and the papers,

300
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:57,238
and got inside the sheriff's
office, as you planned.

301
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,540
There was also the Sheriff,

302
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:03,110
a Marshal and
his deputy and, well...

303
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:05,746
Well what, woman?

304
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:10,952
Well, there was also
this big German, or Russian,

305
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:13,921
biggest son of
a bitch I've ever seen.

306
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:17,658
Then something occurred,
I could not see what,

307
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:19,492
but your two men
draw down on them.

308
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:22,129
Looked like Jackson was first,

309
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:24,932
but this big German or
Russian went batshit crazy.

310
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,935
Both your men are dead.

311
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,870
I was lucky he did not see me.

312
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:31,605
I might have been dead too.

313
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:32,640
Son of a bitch.

314
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:39,513
Thanks, Daniela.

315
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:42,917
Tell the girls
down at the whorehouse

316
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,719
we'll be down to
see 'em real soon.

317
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:47,989
Here's a little bonus for you.

318
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,624
<i>Esta bien, gracias.</i>

319
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:53,627
God damn it.

320
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,798
[tense music]

321
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:04,739
Did you lie to me,
Pinkerton man?

322
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,945
Did you lie to me about
who you was gonna meet?

323
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:16,250
Now you said you was
gonna meet the Marshal,

324
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,921
and deputy, and the sheriff.

325
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:22,890
Is that right?

326
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,894
So who's this big Russian
or German son of a bitch?

327
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:27,928
I don't know. [choking]

328
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,163
- No?
- No.

329
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,665
How about I cut
your goddamn pecker off?

330
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:32,600
No! [sobbing]

331
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,902
Please, I don't know anything.

332
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:36,971
Please don't.
I swear I don't know anything.

333
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:39,907
You don't know anything?

334
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,043
- [choking]
- You are no good to me at all.

335
00:25:49,283 --> 00:25:50,751
- Okay.
- Sir?

336
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:51,619
[Captain] Cut him loose.

337
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:02,063
[dramatic music]

338
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:08,335
[Captain] Get up.

339
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,004
Get up!

340
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:13,574
[indistinct chattering]

341
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,709
- [man] Come on, boy.
- Give him a knife.

342
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,144
Sir.

343
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,881
Pick it up,
you yellow Yankee bastard.

344
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,884
Pick it up or I'll kill you
where you stand.

345
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:28,389
- [Captain grunts]
- [man gasps]

346
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:31,158
[all laughing]

347
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:34,295
[intense music]

348
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,931
[indistinct chattering]

349
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,925
- [lows thudding]
- [men grunting]

350
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,636
[laughing]

351
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:19,807
Back up, boys.

352
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,812
[music continues]

353
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,950
[Captain laughing]

354
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:35,823
Look at me.

355
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:38,893
[choking, gasping]

356
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:03,817
I must say, nurse Nora,
you do meticulous work.

357
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,019
Thank you, Marshal.

358
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,354
But I'm not really a nurse.

359
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,424
I just have some
experience from the war,

360
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:12,159
that and
watching the doctor at work.

361
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,469
I never seen anyone being
so accurate with a handgun.

362
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:24,038
I had some training, Marshal.

363
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:25,773
Just some?

364
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:28,042
- A lot.
- [Marshal] That's it.

365
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:30,945
Now I remember.

366
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:33,113
It was during the war
when we were introduced.

367
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:38,252
Nora, may I present to you,

368
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:43,791
Union Brigadier General,
John Basil Turchin.

369
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:45,059
What's he talking about, Ivan?

370
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,895
I'm talking about how no one

371
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:50,397
can hold a candle
to this man in courage.

372
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:52,399
He saved our hides twice

373
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,769
from the Confederate
army in Chickamauga.

374
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:04,411
Sergeant Austin Carter,
Third Division.

375
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:08,282
It's an honor to
see you again, General.

376
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,417
[grand music]

377
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:14,088
Is that all true, Ivan?

378
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:16,123
It was war, Nora.

379
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:18,526
- I had a job to do.
- You were a general?

380
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:22,062
- Yes.
- How come you never

381
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,464
told anyone in town about it?

382
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:27,067
I was a soldier then.
The war is over.

383
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:28,836
Yes, but a General?

384
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,506
That's all anyone in Blind
Chapel needs to know, Nora.

385
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:50,891
Samuel, where are you?

386
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:52,393
[Samuel] I'm coming.

387
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,866
What is it, Ivan?

388
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,302
You got the bodies
from the shootout already.

389
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,404
Yeah, some locals and I did.

390
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:05,507
Why, what's wrong with that?

391
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,274
Did you find any
personal belongings on them?

392
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,310
No.

393
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:10,311
You're sure about that?

394
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,519
Sir, are you
accusing me of thievery?

395
00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:18,986
Do I have to, Samuel?

396
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:22,557
Do you know how hard
it is to make money at this job?

397
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,560
Hardly no one dies around here.

398
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:27,161
Did you find anything or not?

399
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,597
Nothing valuable.

400
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,634
That's not what
I ask you, Samuel.

401
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:35,035
[sighs] I'll be cow kicked.

402
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:40,841
Where is it?

403
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:49,383
Here.

404
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:51,952
Nothing more than that,
except a few gold teeth.

405
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,388
You can keep the teeth, Samuel.

406
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,324
Thank you,
that's so nice of you.

407
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,494
Where are they?
Blasted teeth.

408
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:03,197
Here, now, I--

409
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:04,898
May I keep--

410
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:08,469
Have a good day.

411
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,139
Get that whiskey.

412
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,244
[grunting]

413
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,216
I brought
you late breakfast, Vernon.

414
00:31:58,352 --> 00:31:59,554
Is this a bad time?

415
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,222
No, it isn't,
this is fine, Jenny.

416
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:04,925
It's your favorite.

417
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:07,060
Sure is.

418
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,499
How are things
over at the palace?

419
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,235
The gunfire slowed
business down for a bit,

420
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:16,970
but it's picked up since then.

421
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:17,938
I'm glad to hear it.

422
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:20,542
I know how hard you work.

423
00:32:20,575 --> 00:32:23,210
So do you, you're
the hardest working man I know.

424
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:24,546
[horse neighing]

425
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:29,617
I can't wait to dig in.

426
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:35,389
Mm, delicious.

427
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:37,458
- [Jenny] Is it warm enough?
- It is.

428
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,729
[Crawley] Well, well, well,
isn't that something?

429
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,401
The sheriff and
the painted lady,

430
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:50,237
fancy each other.

431
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,608
You shut your damn mouth.

432
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:55,543
She ain't no painted lady.

433
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,277
Don't pay
attention to that pole cat.

434
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:00,515
[Crawley] Did all that shooting
earlier interrupt your business,

435
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:02,584
whatever shady
business that might have been?

436
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:08,288
Anyway, that's nothing
compared to what's gonna happen.

437
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:12,092
Just ask
your lovey man over there.

438
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,395
You're all gonna be in
a peck of trouble, huh?

439
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:16,598
What's he mean by that?

440
00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:19,466
What he means is
he's gonna get my boot

441
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,604
up his maggot ass unless
he shuts his fucking mouth.

442
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:23,470
Vernon!

443
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:26,173
Sorry for my temper, Jenny.

444
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:29,577
But that deuce can't
be believed for nothing.

445
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:31,746
I know the type
of men like that.

446
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:35,349
Speaking of men,
I heard of Vernon Kelly,

447
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,686
but he was a hard case.

448
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,657
He was mean enough to steal
a coin from a dead man's eye.

449
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,459
And he was so quick
to pull his fucking iron,

450
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:50,063
Jenny, and he had a Colt
just like your man over there.

451
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:52,165
Have you ever heard of him?

452
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,636
I have heard of
that Vernon Kelly.

453
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,671
And I know for
a fact he changed his ways

454
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,773
and became a good man.

455
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:00,675
And now he's on
the right side of the law.

456
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:02,175
Yeah.

457
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,344
That's exactly what he's doing.

458
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:11,519
You two ought
to charge for that show.

459
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:14,421
[tense music]

460
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,730
[indistinct chattering]

461
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,071
What's the matter
with you people?

462
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:33,575
You didn't hear
the gunfight earlier?

463
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,744
You think everything
is right as rain now?

464
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:39,747
Ethan Crawley
is sitting in our jail,

465
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:42,182
and his notorious,
bloodthirsty Hellhound Gang

466
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:44,184
are gonna come to
our town and free him.

467
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:46,286
If you wanna stay
here and get slaughtered,

468
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,557
that's fine with me,
but I recommend you leave town,

469
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,594
you board up
your businesses and you hide.

470
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:58,866
Now let's go!

471
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:03,437
[tense music]

472
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,751
[Marshal]
It all appears legitimate.

473
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:18,318
Which means
Crawley's gang captured

474
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:20,320
the Pinkerton agents
you were expecting.

475
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:22,155
And they made them talk.

476
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,592
And that's how they deduced
we would be in Blind Chapel.

477
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,326
- Yes.
- [Marshal] Perhaps I should

478
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,795
take Crawley right now,

479
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,631
and cut a path to San Antonio.

480
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,465
You wouldn't make
it, they would get you.

481
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,769
Does this town
have a telegraph office?

482
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,204
It's presently not working.

483
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:44,411
Would any of the town folks
be willing to assist us?

484
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:45,479
I don't know.

485
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:49,517
Nothing like this has
ever happened here before.

486
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:52,620
- [church bell ringing]
- [people yelling]

487
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,855
[Ivan] What's that?

488
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,758
[tense music]

489
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:04,699
[intense music]

490
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:30,190
Bless you.

491
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,699
Good to see you, Alice.
Take shelter, everyone.

492
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,500
- What's going on, preacher?
- Haven't you heard?

493
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:42,003
The Hellhound Gang,

494
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:42,970
they're--they're coming
to free Ethan Crawley.

495
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:44,839
Who told you that?

496
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,841
Mayor Bowman told everyone.

497
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,409
I don't know what else to do
but hide as many of my flock

498
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:50,845
as I can inside the church.

499
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,914
You're welcome to
join us if you'd like, Ivan.

500
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:54,549
I can't.

501
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,655
[soft music]

502
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:12,667
[Sheriff] Doesn't look like

503
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,467
we're gonna get much help,
Jenny.

504
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,268
Well, they're all afraid,
Vernon.

505
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:17,839
[horse neighing]

506
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:20,541
[eerie music]

507
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:26,581
[coyote howling]

508
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:33,721
Men,

509
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:39,392
they got our Colonel
down there in their jail.

510
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:42,897
We gonna let
'em keep our Colonel?

511
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:45,332
- [men] No!
- Hell no, we ain't.

512
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,935
We're gonna bring hell
down on them shit heels.

513
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,838
I want you to ride in there
and shoot everything that moves.

514
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:52,439
[men] Yeah!

515
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:53,775
[Captain]
After we thin out their numbers,

516
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:56,276
we gonna march on
that jail and free our Colonel.

517
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:57,912
[men] Yeah!

518
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,747
[dramatic music]

519
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:02,315
Mount up. Let's go.

520
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,383
[indistinct chattering]

521
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:06,721
[ominous orchestral music]

522
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:20,101
[Crawley]
What are you all so glum about?

523
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:22,570
Afraid my Hellhounds
gonna butcher everybody in town?

524
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:23,738
Don't waste your breath.

525
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,673
Says the blue-bellied General.

526
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:27,975
Oh, that's right.

527
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,677
I suddenly remember
where I know you from.

528
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,649
You are that scoundrel General

529
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,952
John Basil Turchin.

530
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:40,788
Do I say it right? I don't want
to insult you, you know.

531
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:44,659
General John here
led a pack of scorchers.

532
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:47,728
He used to set towns on fire.

533
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:53,634
Any of you ever
heard of the Rape of Athens?

534
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,637
Did you tell 'em about
your court martialing yet?

535
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,338
I was fighting a war.

536
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,743
You rode with
Quantrill and his cowards

537
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:03,811
who killed for pleasure.

538
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:06,681
I remember the Lawrence Massacre

539
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:08,850
committed by
Quantrill's Raiders.

540
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,052
That was a disgusting act.

541
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:13,688
[chuckles]

542
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,388
You really think so, huh?

543
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:17,525
Well, I kind of liked it.

544
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,694
[dark music]

545
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:28,703
[Marshal]
Not gonna use your rifle?

546
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:32,405
I work better at
close range with these.

547
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:35,943
I got something
here that works just fine.

548
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:38,378
All yours.

549
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:41,949
Well,

550
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:44,719
wow. [chuckles]

551
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,722
I can raise Cain with this.

552
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:50,858
So how should we do this?

553
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:52,927
Well, you are the general.

554
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,794
What's your plan?

555
00:39:54,862 --> 00:39:56,864
Agreed, let's hear it, Ivan.

556
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:58,398
Okay.

557
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:01,002
You two stay here.

558
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:03,037
Don't let him out of your sight.

559
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,172
And if the Hellhounds
get inside, just kill him.

560
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,941
Will do.

561
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,811
Girls, you should
get out of here.

562
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:11,979
Stay with Nora.

563
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:13,180
It's safe over there.

564
00:40:13,614 --> 00:40:14,715
I don't wanna leave you.

565
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,752
You can't be here, Jenny.

566
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:21,122
Please, do what Ivan says.

567
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:24,025
Ladies, just go to
the doctor's office, please.

568
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:26,127
Come on, Jenny.

569
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,194
Let's go.

570
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:30,665
[tense music]

571
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:35,903
It's loaded.

572
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:39,073
Wait, you don't
want any firearms?

573
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:41,575
No, I have my own.

574
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:51,886
[Sheriff] A word?

575
00:40:57,224 --> 00:41:00,928
Listen, I don't give a pig's
ass what happened in the war.

576
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:03,698
But I've seen you in action.

577
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,533
You know what you're doing.

578
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,102
But just between you and me,

579
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,237
I get the feeling we got
our hair in the butter bad

580
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:11,471
with these Hellhounds.

581
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:12,974
Probably.

582
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:16,844
You ever been up
against these kinda odds?

583
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:18,179
Many times.

584
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,247
[Sheriff] What did you do?

585
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:23,651
If you want to beat the enemy,

586
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:25,920
you have to do
everything better.

587
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,256
If they're strong,
you have to be stronger.

588
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,526
If they fight hard,
you have to fight even harder.

589
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:34,161
What if they're monsters?

590
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:39,934
Anyone can be
a monster, you'd be surprised.

591
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:41,035
[Sheriff] No, I wouldn't.

592
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:43,237
I used to be one a while back.

593
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:46,974
I reckon today
I'll have to be one again.

594
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:50,644
No, you have to be the Sheriff.

595
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:52,146
That's who you are.

596
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,914
Keep your town safe.

597
00:41:53,948 --> 00:41:55,516
Keep your prisoner behind bars.

598
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:58,019
That's your duty.

599
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:00,788
Even if it means being ruthless.

600
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:03,124
Well, in that case, why don't
I just go back in there

601
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:04,992
and cut down
Crawley where he stands?

602
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:07,928
I thought about
doing the same thing.

603
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:09,864
Well, why in the hell don't you?

604
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,133
Two reasons.

605
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:15,302
First, it won't stop
the Hellhounds from coming here.

606
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:20,975
And second, most importantly,
Crawley deserves to be hanged.

607
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:26,013
It'd sure be nice
seeing him swinging

608
00:42:26,047 --> 00:42:27,581
from the end of a rope.

609
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:29,617
It sure will, Sheriff.

610
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:32,953
[dog barking]

611
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:42,063
[acoustic guitar music]

612
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:48,169
[sinister music]

613
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:57,771
When did you get all this?

614
00:43:57,805 --> 00:43:59,707
Over the years.
You know how to shoot?

615
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:03,277
Ever since I was young,
my parents made sure of it.

616
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,714
How about you, Arlene?

617
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:08,082
[tense music]

618
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:12,419
Aim, and pull the trigger?

619
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,755
Right,

620
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,056
but it needs to be loaded first.

621
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,160
Here, I'll show
you how, it's easy.

622
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:20,227
Jenny?

623
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:23,030
I've fired a gun before,
Vernon showed me how.

624
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:24,231
Good.

625
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:26,333
Ivan?

626
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,116
[dog barking]

627
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:50,724
[Nora] Why didn't you ever
say anything about the war?

628
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:55,162
I told you Nora,
it's nobody's business.

629
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:58,365
What are you hiding?

630
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:00,367
Nothing.

631
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:02,736
You're not a good liar.

632
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,273
I'm not lying to you.

633
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:12,046
Then tell me what
happened in the war.

634
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:15,482
Why?

635
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:18,118
Because
you need to tell someone.

636
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,188
It's eating you alive.

637
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:27,761
Did you ever hear
about the Rape of Athens?

638
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:29,930
I heard some things about it.

639
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:34,034
My regiment took
control of Athens, Alabama.

640
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:39,840
But to be honest with you,
the only thing I was doing,

641
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:45,045
I was watching my brave men
get picked off one by one,

642
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,181
not just by Confederates,

643
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:51,051
but by the town folks as well.

644
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:54,855
That must have been awful.

645
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:56,890
It was a nightmare,

646
00:45:58,259 --> 00:45:59,326
and I couldn't
stop it from happening.

647
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:01,228
What'd you do?

648
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,264
I lost my temper.

649
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:08,536
One day I said to my troops
that I'm going to close my eyes.

650
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:12,139
Won't see nothing for two hours.

651
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:18,445
So I left the city and
they ransacked all of Athens.

652
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:23,851
A lot of
that happened in the war.

653
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:27,921
But I was a Colonel in
charge of all 19th Regiment.

654
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,126
Some military square heads,
they didn't like what I did.

655
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:35,262
So I was court martialed, Nora.

656
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:39,266
And I said to the court,

657
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:44,338
that you cannot fight
slavers with soft gloves.

658
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:51,879
It turned out President Lincoln
heard about me and my trial.

659
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:55,983
So he reinstated me and promoted
me to Brigadier General.

660
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:58,553
Well,

661
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:00,287
then that's that.

662
00:47:01,188 --> 00:47:02,122
You were in the right.

663
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:05,359
Some people don't think so.

664
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:07,227
[Nora] What do they know?

665
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:11,432
I can't say I disagree.

666
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:14,268
But it was war.

667
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:16,203
It was war.

668
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:19,139
That's what I keep
telling myself, Nora.

669
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,407
But it's the truth.

670
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:24,311
You were just
trying to protect your men

671
00:47:24,345 --> 00:47:25,946
during a time of madness.

672
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:27,981
Just like you're
trying to protect all of us now

673
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:28,849
from Crawley's gang.

674
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:31,051
I'm not so sure, Nora.

675
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:36,190
Guess what?

676
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,459
I am.

677
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:40,127
[dog barking]

678
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:49,903
No matter what
happens outside, stay hidden.

679
00:47:50,371 --> 00:47:51,872
Don't let
Crawley's gang find you.

680
00:47:53,374 --> 00:47:54,208
What if they do?

681
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:57,144
[Ivan]
Just make sure they don't.

682
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:01,516
Are you saying we might
have to use these on ourselves?

683
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:04,619
No, use it on anyone
who comes through this door.

684
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:08,489
Ivan?

685
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:11,191
Come back alive.

686
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:39,953
You know what I'm thinking?

687
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:46,561
There's gonna be one hard
killing time coming up soon.

688
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:49,363
Yes, and it's highly unlikely
you will see the end of it.

689
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:52,734
Unless of course,
we all survive.

690
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:54,001
In that case,

691
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:57,237
we will escort you to
the town of San Antonio to hang.

692
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:59,940
- [tense music]
- [church bell ringing]

693
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,310
Those are some future
plans you got there, Crawley.

694
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:07,649
[Crawley chuckling]

695
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:12,419
[eerie music]

696
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:40,414
So, you think
you're ready for us, do you?

697
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:44,351
[men chuckling]

698
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:50,991
[tense music]

699
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:04,438
[horses galloping]

700
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:10,444
[intense music]

701
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:53,320
[music continues]

702
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,699
Jenny, you take the window.

703
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:06,266
Go.

704
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,447
[intense orchestral music]

705
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,525
[tense music]

706
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:25,546
No! [sobbing]

707
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:32,319
[gun firing]

708
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:46,567
[woman gasping]

709
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,436
[man chuckles] Lookie here.

710
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,706
You think you're the first
man to ever point a gun at me?

711
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:58,478
[woman screaming]

712
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,815
[woman shouts indistinctly]

713
00:53:01,415 --> 00:53:04,652
[woman screaming]

714
00:53:04,686 --> 00:53:07,387
[man whimpering]

715
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:12,492
[dire orchestral music]

716
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:18,498
[gun firing]

Relax your breathing

764
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:15,856
- Okay?
- You're gonna be okay.

Sheriff, it's me,
Reverend Andrew.

775
00:59:56,097 --> 00:59:58,065
I'm in a bit of a--
bit of a bind,

776
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:00,768
there's someone here who wants
to talk to you about it.

[tense music]

778
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:05,272
Sheriff Kelly?

779
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:08,676
Don't you think
you ought to talk

780
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:10,077
to the preacher man, Sheriff?

781
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:14,915
Talk to the preacher
and see what he wants.

782
01:00:18,252 --> 01:00:19,787
Are you all right, preacher?

783
01:00:20,888 --> 01:00:21,956
[man] You need to come out.

784
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,401
Now, let's just
have us a talk here.

785
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:39,206
No shooting at
each other for a minute.

786
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:42,977
Just so you know,
we found your town folk.

787
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:47,781
Yeah, they're all down
there hiding in the church.

788
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:49,884
Now who the hell does that?

789
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:52,686
Hide the town folk
in a goddamn church?

790
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:55,856
You oughta be
ashamed of yourselves.

791
01:00:56,257 --> 01:00:57,391
What do you want?

792
01:00:57,992 --> 01:00:59,126
We want Colonel Crawley.

793
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:02,229
Well, we ain't
gonna give 'im to you.

794
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,133
Well now, that's not good.

795
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:08,969
'Cause if you don't,

796
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:12,406
I'm gonna torch
that church and everybody in it.

797
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:14,141
We're gonna
shoot this preacher dead.

798
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,315
I'm not gonna
dicker with you shit heels.

799
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:23,450
You do what I say right now,

800
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:25,452
or you know what's gonna happen.

801
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:27,354
[tense music]

802
01:01:27,788 --> 01:01:30,157
Unless you already
killed my Colonel, did you?

803
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:33,827
Colonel Crawley,
can you hear me?

804
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,029
Are you all right?

805
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:37,031
Never been better,
Captain Grady.

806
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:45,072
I don't know what to do.

807
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,441
We can't release
Crawley to them.

808
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:48,309
We can't.

809
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,313
I can't just let
my whole town die.

810
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:53,814
You can't trust them,

811
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,382
I promise you they will
kill the town anyway.

812
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:57,284
What's it gonna be?

813
01:01:57,318 --> 01:01:58,886
I ain't gonna wait much longer.

814
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:11,465
Goddamn good work,
Captain Grady.

815
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:12,333
Thank you, sir.

816
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:16,503
Where is everyone?

817
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:18,506
Dead, sir.

818
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,342
Except for private Oakley and me

819
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,110
and Corporal Waters
down at the church.

820
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:27,448
This town's got this big
dumb German or Russian,

821
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:30,150
whatever the hell
he is, he just won't die.

822
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:32,052
He killed every
man I've thrown at him.

823
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,521
He's a Russian,

824
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:37,858
and he's crazy enough to
eat the devil with his horns.

825
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:45,399
And he's no other than
General John Basil Turchin.

826
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:49,503
The Rape of Athens general?

827
01:02:51,573 --> 01:02:52,906
That one.

828
01:02:54,308 --> 01:02:55,943
Now let me ask you a question.

829
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:58,979
Do you think that son of a
bitch, Turchin, is still alive?

830
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:01,882
I don't know, sir.

831
01:03:01,915 --> 01:03:03,817
[tense music]

832
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:06,987
Threw every man we had
at him, he killed 'em all.

833
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:12,426
And now we have no men.

834
01:03:13,595 --> 01:03:17,097
Afraid not sir, other
than what I told you about.

835
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:18,932
But I ain't seen
that Russian in a while,

836
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:19,800
they might have got him.

837
01:03:21,335 --> 01:03:22,537
Somehow I don't think so.

838
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:27,941
[Sheriff]
Send the preacher over here.

839
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:34,315
You get that preacher
and your town folks back

840
01:03:34,649 --> 01:03:36,850
when I'm riding out
of this horseshit town.

841
01:03:36,884 --> 01:03:38,586
How about you both
just toss your guns out here?

842
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,123
Well, then we'll just be

843
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:44,958
hanging on to
the preacher for a while.

844
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:47,928
Try to follow us,
he's a dead man.

845
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:50,931
You close that goddamn door
and you stay inside,

846
01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:52,866
or I'm gonna burn
down that chapel myself.

847
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:55,169
You understand what I'm saying?

848
01:03:56,604 --> 01:03:57,404
Let's go, come on.

[ominous orchestral music]

850
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:06,880
Release the preacher.

851
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:14,355
Preacher, thank
you so much for your services.

852
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:19,326
Now let's look at this
beautiful chapel you built.

853
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:22,996
Town folks
waiting there for you.

854
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:25,165
You know what I think?

855
01:04:27,134 --> 01:04:28,268
What?

856
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:30,003
I think you should join them.

857

[dramatic orchestral music]

858
01:04:39,313 --> 01:04:40,515

What do you wanna
do about that, sir?

862
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:08,175
I say we torch the church.

863
01:05:09,577 --> 01:05:10,678
Town folks inside,

864
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:13,247
have a look.

865
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:16,049
This,

866
01:05:17,384 --> 01:05:19,654
this is what hell looks like.

867

You are [indistinct] wolf
when it comes to killing.

875
01:06:09,336 --> 01:06:10,270
I gotta hand you that.

876
01:06:11,472 --> 01:06:12,339
Not a bullet left.

877
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,148
So you gonna
kill an unarmed man?

878
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:24,284
Is that what
you are, a Russian coward?

879

I told you, we're both killers.

886
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:22,797
You and me,

887
01:09:25,232 --> 01:09:25,867
we are the same.

888
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:28,703
No, we're not.

889
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:47,487
I greatly appreciate you

890
01:09:47,522 --> 01:09:49,524
volunteering to
go along, General.

891
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:50,725
I want to see justice served.

892
01:09:53,027 --> 01:09:54,227
So do I.

893
01:09:55,395 --> 01:09:56,798
[Sheriff] I'd like to go
with you Marshal,

894
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:59,399
but I've got this
town to look after,

895
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:02,369
and I don't think
the Mayor's coming back.

896
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:04,505
At least I hope not.

897
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:05,740
