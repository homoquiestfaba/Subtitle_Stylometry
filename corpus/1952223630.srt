00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:47,182
No, we need to talk, Elliot.

363
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:48,776
Yeah, tonight.

364
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,514
ELLIOT:
God, I don't know what to say, Skip.

365
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:55,391
There's... There's gotta be
another way.

366
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:57,291
There's not.

367
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:58,695
What?

368
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:01,790
No, I mean,

369
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,061
it's just that you
can't use your son like that.

370
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,170
I'm gonna talk to him,
see if he's okay with it.

371
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,504
Let me understand
something here, Skip.

372
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:14,136
You shoot heroin
into your veins for kicks, right?

373
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,544
Years later, it destroys your liver.

374
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:19,140
Now you want me to keep
this poor kid out of jail

375
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:20,980
so you can con him
out of a piece of his?

376
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:23,246
I told you, there's no time!

377
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:24,753
It's just a little surgery.

378
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:26,324
It's major surgery.

379
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:27,858
Things can happen.

380
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:30,154
This is my life
we're talking about, Elliot.

381
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:31,489
You are way over the line here.

382
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:33,188
I don't think I'm breaking any laws.

383
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:36,823
The boy is not an organ bank.
He's a human being.

384

So am I.

00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:40,632
Oh, Skip. I know how you work.

I've been right there with you.

He's my only chance.

391
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:56,711
Then face the reality, Skip.
Face it!

392
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,926
Come to think of it,
you are breaking a law.

393
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,289
A higher law.

394
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,459
You just keep Danny out of jail.

I want to show you something.

Okay, it'll be here waiting for you.

406
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:28,803
Nothing.

407
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:31,042
That's a lie.
Why are you still here?

408
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,999
Because I want to be.

409
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:35,705
Another lie.

410

Don't you ever steal from me!

If you need money,
you just ask me.

call me at this number?

No.

Yeah, anything can be restored.
Just time and effort.

You're missing a lot of pieces.
Some we can pick up.

446

You'll need specs, a catalogue,
chrome work.

Can we assemble it here?

448
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:25,981
No. No, it's got to be done at a shop.

But we've got lots of tools here.

This isn't like building
a model airplane.

Danny, you're welcome
to join us, if you'd like.

It's a 17, just like I said.

Everything needs to be cleaned
and rechromed and painted.

It's not going to be easy
finding what's missing.

The hard part's always the prep work.

Your Honor, we do not deny
the charges against my client.

478
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:18,782
We would, however, suggest
there are mitigating factors.

479
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,687
It is a first offense.

480
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:22,521
The boy is a minor.

481
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:23,855
And he has not had the benefit

482

and supervision.

483
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:27,324
Has the mother been absent?

484
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,628
The boy's mother was killed
in a car accident when he was three.

His aunt raised him.

I'm sorry, I don't quite understand.

491
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:43,206
Mr. Gaines has been totally absent
from his son's life

492
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:46,750
and is therefore totally responsible
for his son's behavior.

493
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:47,818
Explain.

494
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,614
Extreme negligence.

495
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:52,483
17 years ago,

Danny, the defendant.

497
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:59,293
Did Mr. Gaines remain with him
to teach him right from wrong,

498
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:01,228
to instill in him the proper values,

499
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:05,962
to guide him into responsible
adulthood like a father should?

500
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,799
No.

501
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:11,870
Mr. Gaines abandoned his son's care
to his sister

502
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,240
who tried to be both
mother and father to him.

503
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:16,403
But as you would observe,
Your Honor,

504
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:21,918
Danny has, in fact, suffered
from Mr. Gaines' abject disregard

for his own son's welfare.

506
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:27,319
Mr. Gaines is a callous
and cruel individual, Your Honor.

507
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:30,588
And I would hope that you would
take these facts into consideration

508
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:32,923
to prevent a similar outcome
for Danny.

509
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:35,056
Do you have other children,
Mr. Gaines?

510
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,362
No, not that I know of.

511
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,702
Uh, I mean, no.

How lucky for them.

514
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:52,708
You, young man, have a lot to learn
about respect for the rule of law.

515
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:55,148
I can decide that you are an adult
and try you as one.

516
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:57,949
Your Honor, I would like to take
full responsibility.

Really? Since when?

518
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:02,151
My son, uh, doesn't deserve
to go to jail,

519
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,023
and I'll take care
of all the financial, uh...

520
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:07,222
No, he doesn't. And yes, you will pay
for the financial damage.

521
00:38:08,232 --> 00:38:09,563
But how do you plan on paying

522
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:12,693
for the damage you've done
to your own son?

523
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:14,495
Exactly.

524
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:15,937
How do you plead, Mr. Gaines?

525
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:20,772
Guilty.

00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,543
If I see you in here again,

I will send you to jail,
you understand?

00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:30,349
Yes, Your Honor.

Your dad, Skip...

01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:18,333
He seems like a nice guy.

725
01:03:19,576 --> 01:03:21,134
He seems...

726
01:03:21,778 --> 01:03:23,939
...different now.

01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:25,605

He looks at you a lot.

731
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:41,625
Also he looks different.

732
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:43,062
I don't think he's well.

733
01:03:43,933 --> 01:03:47,494
Look, all I know is he never
gave a damn about me before.

734
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:48,593
So why should he now?

735
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,939
Maybe he's trying.

736
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:55,067
Maybe he wants something.

01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:58,614
Hell if I know.

01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:04,311
Maybe you should give him a chance.

I am.

There's something wrong
with your dad.

He doesn't look right.

with... with Dad... Skip.

904
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,564
Mom.

905
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:48,506
- Hey.
- Let me take your bag.

906
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:53,680
Um, are you hungry?
I just threw some bacon and eggs in.

907
01:17:53,782 --> 01:17:56,546
Danny, are you feeling okay?

908
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,854
I'm worried about Dad.

909
01:17:59,955 --> 01:18:02,355
He takes these pills.

910
01:18:16,538 --> 01:18:19,268
This is a very serious prescription.

911
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:23,174
This is for people who...

912
01:18:23,345 --> 01:18:24,778
That's right.

913
01:18:29,351 --> 01:18:30,409
It's okay.

914
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:36,249
It's not okay.

915
01:18:37,059 --> 01:18:39,892
Is that why you came back here?
So you could die on him?

916
01:18:50,506 --> 01:18:54,875
You came home for a partial
from Danny, didn't you?

917
01:18:55,511 --> 01:18:57,069
- You have no right!
- Carrie.

918
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:00,478
- You have no right to ask that of him!
- Carrie.

919
01:19:01,984 --> 01:19:03,611
You're right.

920
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,018
You've always been right.

921
01:19:10,926 --> 01:19:13,326
I got so much more than I came for.

922
01:19:13,429 --> 01:19:18,059
I got my son back,
and I got my sister back.

923
01:19:20,202 --> 01:19:23,535
Those are the most
important things in life.

924
01:19:25,607 --> 01:19:28,405
Maybe one day he'll believe me.

925
01:19:29,745 --> 01:19:30,575
And you.

926
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:36,640
This is gonna hurt him.

927
01:19:39,721 --> 01:19:42,246
This is gonna hurt me.

928
01:19:42,624 --> 01:19:44,717
I'm so sorry for those things
I said to you.

929
01:19:44,893 --> 01:19:46,554
Don't, don't.

930
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:47,560
Don't, don't.

931
01:19:52,568 --> 01:19:54,695
Did they say how long?

932
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,667
Elliot.

933
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:01,665
Skip.

934
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:03,678
Yeah.

935
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:07,146
I want everything in a trust.

936
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:10,083
Yeah monthly...
monthly income.

937
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:16,057
DANNY:
Oh!

938
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:18,286
Oh, don't fall!

939
01:20:18,393 --> 01:20:19,724
I wish Dad could see this.

940
01:20:32,774 --> 01:20:35,265
How's that doctor friend of yours?

941
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:37,004
He's good.

942
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:38,637
We're good.

943
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:40,670
That's good.

944
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:48,988
I want you to give my attorney,
Elliot, a call when...

945
01:20:50,526 --> 01:20:52,653
...when you get around to it.

946
01:21:00,035 --> 01:21:01,024
How are you feeling?

947
01:21:02,204 --> 01:21:04,502
Like I'm about 100 years old.

948
01:21:07,276 --> 01:21:10,040
They say it's supposed to rain.

949
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:16,349
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

950
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:18,877
Maybe.

951
01:22:19,448 --> 01:22:23,214
You know, you're...
you're really warm.

952
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:33,761
I thought that we
would go to the lake.

953
01:22:35,397 --> 01:22:37,627
You said we should go sometime.

954
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:39,999
I did.

955
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:41,768
Honey, I don't think it's a good idea.

956
01:22:54,283 --> 01:22:55,875
You drive.

957
01:22:57,219 --> 01:22:59,050
I'm not allowed.

958
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:02,320
Neither am I.

959
01:23:15,837 --> 01:23:18,032
It's a beautiful day.

960
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:22,775
It is.

961
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:29,449
So, what do you want to do
with the rest of your life?

962
01:23:31,853 --> 01:23:33,377
I don't know.

963
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:36,751
I like to draw.

964
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:39,318
You're an artist.

965
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:42,829
- A good one.
- No, I'm not.

966
01:23:44,466 --> 01:23:47,492
Danny, there's gonna be
so many people in your life

967
01:23:47,602 --> 01:23:49,763
putting you down.

968
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:52,601
You don't need any help from you.

969
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:54,539
You understand?

970
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:57,473
Yeah.

971
01:24:00,415 --> 01:24:05,512
You got a lot of opportunities
to do some great things.

972
01:24:09,024 --> 01:24:11,686
I want you to take advantage of them.

973
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:25,831
My father...

974
01:24:27,242 --> 01:24:31,201
He taught me how to be a good man,
Danny, and I wasn't.

975
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:38,351
Be a good man, Danny.

976
01:24:40,856 --> 01:24:42,790
Be happy.

977
01:24:44,726 --> 01:24:46,660
Honest.

978
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,990
Good.

979
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:02,977
We should have come here
a long time ago.

980
01:25:29,438 --> 01:25:31,269
Dad.

981
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:38,409
Dad.

982
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:48,246
Dad.

983
