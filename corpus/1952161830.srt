1
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:49,284
Looks good, right?

2
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:59,362
So, my plan is to create
this cluster of livelwork lofts

3
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,372
all along the perimeter here.
And... Come here.

4
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:06,310
I also am planning this neighborhood-y
kind of dining and retail area

5
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,608
in the central square.

6
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,149
You know, I even had this thought
that maybe you, Denise and Hailey

7
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,777
could open up a second location
for your store.

8
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:14,616
Really? Because Denise keeps talking

9
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:16,349
about wanting to open up
another branch.

10
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:17,890
Well, it'd be great. Yeah.

11
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,893
Look, the land is a little pricey,
so I couldn't develop it right away,

12
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:22,451
but once I sell the Ferrigno estate,

13
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,827
I figured out I could at least
put a down payment on it

14
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:29,198
and still have enough money left over
for the reception in Santa Barbara.

15
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:32,098
What are you talking about?
What reception?

16
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:37,042
Zooey, I know it's only been
eight months,

17
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,103
but I am so madly, insanely,
ridiculously in love with you.

18
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:48,482
Will you marry me?

19
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:51,750
Yes! It just happened
two minutes ago, Hailey.

20
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:54,692
<i>- Can you believe it?
- No, I can't. It's amazing.</i>

21
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,786
<i>Oh, my God.
I've been on like 10 million dates,</i>

22
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,626
<i>and you end up marrying
some totally awesome guy</i>

23
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,757
<i>who randomly walks into our store?</i>

24
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,927
It's so cute. She doesn't know
she's on speakerphone.

25
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:05,130
<i>You do not know how lucky you are.</i>

26
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:07,433
It is impossible
to find a good guy in this city.

27
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,975
<i>- I know.
- I thought we were connecting.</i>

28
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,443
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Kind of.

29
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:15,043
I'm sorry, but not really.

30
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:18,516
<i>- Hey, will you conference in Denise?
- Oh, my God! You called me first?</i>

31
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:21,179
<i>- Oh, God.
- Awesome. Yes. Hold on.</i>

32
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:23,148
Hi.

33
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,417
Hi.

34
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:35,592
- I love that piece of land. It's perfect.
- I'm glad.

35
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:37,728
I mean, I know the neighborhood's
a little, you know...

36
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:40,932
<i>Oh, my God, Zo! I cannot
fucking believe you didn't call me first!</i>

37
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:44,499
You are such a freak.
Hailey's first on my speed dial.

38
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,637
<i>No, no, no, I'm totally kidding.
I'm so psyched for you.</i>

39
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:47,873
<i>I feel like I'm gonna puke right now.</i>

40
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:49,006
Oh, my God, hold on.

41
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,879
Barry hates when I'm in the house
during his poker night.

42
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:52,213
Would you give me a second,
you fat douche?

43
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,775
Get out. Get out of the fucking house...

44
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:55,378
- Zooey just got engaged!
- To who?

45
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,454
<i>- "To who," are you joking? To Peter.
- To who? To me.</i>

46
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:59,185
<i>- I don't know Peter.
- I've met the guy like 20 times.</i>

47
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,817
- You've met him like 20 times.
- I don't know Peter.

48
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,691
- You don't know Peter?
- I have no idea who that is.

49
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:04,024
Okay, we've been on like 20 dates
with him.

50
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:05,587
- You don't know him?
- I've never met Peter.

51
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,292
You are such an asshole.

52
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:08,459
Sorry, Zo. Have you set a date?

53
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:10,298
Yes. June 30th in Santa Barbara.

54
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,770
Peter already booked the place
we went for that long weekend.

55
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,897
So romantic.

56
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:15,737
Oh, my God. He is so romantic.

57
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,970
That's the place where you guys
fucked for the first time, right?

58
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:23,505
No.

59
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,778
<i>No, no, no,
that was the hot tub in Mexico.</i>

60
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,752
That's right.
Santa Barbara was just oral.

61
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,083
<i>- Yeah.
- You guys.</i>

62
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:30,349
<i>That's right. The hot tub, yeah.</i>

63
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,152
It was Mexico. You had your period in
Santa Barbara and you wanted to wait.

64
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:35,861
<i>God, you're so old-fashioned, Zooey.</i>

65
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,858
- You told them about the hot tub?
- Maybe.

66
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,801
<i>- Wow. So, June 30th?
- Yeah, I know. It's soon, but...</i>

67
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,064
Who cares? Peter's a doll,

68
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:46,935
and he goes down on you
like six times a week.

69
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:48,367
<i>- What are you waiting for?
- Wow.</i>

70
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:49,567
<i>Marry him. Don't wait.</i>

71
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,143
Lock that tongue down, girl.

72
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,610
Yeah. It's gonna be great.

73
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,840
All right, you guys, I'll call you later.
Love you.

74
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:10,361
It is beautiful. It's totally understated,
and it's just... It's perfect.

75
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,593
I know! No, he's the best. I feel so lucky.

76
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:18,196
All right. All right, Debbie.
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

77
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,666
Honey!
I've been totally hogging the phone.

78
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,469
- Who do you wanna call?
- I'm okay.

79
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,772
My parents are probably asleep,
so I'll just talk to them tomorrow.

80
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:26,334
You don't wanna tell
any of your friends?

81
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,404
I'll make some calls this weekend.

82
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,073
Really?
Well, what about that guy, Tevin?

83
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,209
You talk to him
like 20 times a day, right?

84
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,378
Well, yeah.
He works two cubicles away from me.

85
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:35,546
I'll see him Monday morning.

86
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:38,056
Or what's his name?
The one that you fence with.

87
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:39,148
- Gil?
- Gil.

88
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,954
Gil. Gilliam.

89
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,153
No, he's not really a "call right away"
kind of friend.

90
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,131
Toasting.

91
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:01,173
- Hi! Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:04,510
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mom.

93
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,142
- Excellent meat.
- So good.

94
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,711
- This is delicious. Thank you so much.
- Really is, Mom.

95
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,256
Thank you.

96
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:14,020
But did Peter have any good friends
growing up?

97
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,359
I honestly don't remember any.

98
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,158
All right, look, Zooey,
just to clarify here,

99
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:21,257
my dad worked for IBM,
so we moved a lot when I was a kid.

100
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,097
Robbie always managed to have friends.

101
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,103
Of course, he probably wanted
to suck their dicks, but...

102
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,365
Oswald!

103
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,367
No, Mom, it's cool. I totally did.

104
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,534
But he doesn't have to use
that kind of language.

105
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,668
- Indeed.
- Why?

106
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,771
My son is a gay man,
and I embrace his lifestyle.

107
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,577
It's true. Dad loves the gays.

108
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,881
I actually made him
an honorary homo last month.

109
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:44,512
The point is, Zooey, Peter always
connected better with women.

110
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:47,788
You know, I can see that
because he's a great boyfriend.

111
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:49,293
Thank you, fiancée.

112
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:50,624
Also, you gotta understand, Zooey.

113
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:53,723
Peter matured sexually
at a very early age.

114
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,791
I remember taking him swimming
when he was 12 years old.

115
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,894
Kid had a bush
like a 40-year-old Serbian.

116
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:01,763
Come on. Okay.
Dad, please, stop talking.

117
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,365
- Good to know.
- Nice.

118
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,412
Come on. He had a Speedo full of Brillo.
Be proud.

119
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:08,171
God.

120
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:11,012
Who invited the stand-up comedian
over here?

121
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,883
Zooey, here's the deal.
Peter's always been a "girlfriend guy. "

122
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:17,548
He put all his focus and energy
into his relationships,

123
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,956
and all his dude friends
just fell by the wayside.

124
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,893
Zooey, don't listen to him, all right?
I mean, we're eight years apart.

125
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,987
Barely grew up together
in the same house.

126
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,556
This is ridiculous.
Why is it weird that I had girlfriends?

127
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,364
Nothing. We're just saying
you never really had a best friend, is all.

128
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:32,701
- Well, who's your best friend?
- I have two.

129
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,535
Hank Mardukas has been
my closest friend

130
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:35,801
since our first year at IBM.

131
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,740
- Best man at our wedding. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, he was.

132
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:41,611
Talk to him two, three times a week
on the phone for 30 years now.

133
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,410
And then there's Robbie.

134
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,774
What's up?

135
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:50,712
- Robbie is your other best friend?
- Correct. And Hank Mardukas.

136
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,700
What the shit is he looking at?

137
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,708
Davis Dunn Realty,
how may I direct your call? Please hold.

138
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:51,150
Hold, please. Put him through to Tevin.

139
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:55,247
It's very close to downtown.
How close do you wanna be?

140
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:57,487
Thank you, sweetheart.

141
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,890
I can't get you that close.
'Cause the schools are terrible.

142
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,055
The skyscrapers were all lit up.
I got down on one knee.

143
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,793
She was totally surprised.

144
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:11,667
Well, I'm jealous, Peter,
'cause you never gave me a shot.

145
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,838
But you're gonna
make the best husband.

146
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:17,070
Stop it. Stop.
All right, you can continue now.

147
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,173
Morning, Trayce.

148
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,345
- Hey, Tevin.
- Hey, man.

149
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,409
What's so funny?

150
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:29,750
One of the guys
in my fantasy football league

151
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:30,812
just sent me a QuickTime.

152
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,415
It's a grandma riding a Sybian machine.

153
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:34,824
What's that?

154
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,384
It's one of those vibrating saddles

155
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:40,091
that women sit on to give them,
like, super intense orgasms.

156
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,457
Check it out.

157
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,498
<i>- Damn!
- How sick is that?</i>

158
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:47,733
It's very. That's very sick.

159
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:49,274
So awesome.

160
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:53,737
Hey. So, what up, dog?
How's that Ferrigno dealio coming?

161
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,805
It's coming good. Yeah. I'm getting
ready to show in a couple of weeks.

162
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,714
Great.
Dude, I'm just gonna throw this out there

163
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:00,548
because it's a big piece of house.

164
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,851
If you want a copilot on this,
I'd be happy to team up with you.

165
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:07,222
No, I know. I feel like I wanna
give myself the challenge

166
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:08,760
- and just see how it goes...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,092
- I appreciate the offer.
- No sweat.

168
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,632
Hey, anyway, you know,
my girlfriend and I...

169
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,363
Well, we had this very special evening
planned, and I...

170
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:21,464
She's a squirter! She's squirting!
Peter, we got a squirter!

171
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,033
Old Faithful!

172
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,605
Hello, fiancée.

173
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,740
<i>Hey, baby. I totally forgot.
It's my turn to host ladies' night.</i>

174
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,451
No prob.
I have fencing practice, anyway.

175
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,387
I'll grab a beer with Gil and the boys
afterward. Hit them with the big news.

176
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:40,654
<i>- Great! I gotta go. Love you.
- I love you, too.</i>

177
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,456
Peter! Peter!

178
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,991
I'm sending it to you.

179
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,363
- No. I don't want it.
- You got it.

180
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,063
God!

181
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:54,095
Wait a minute, I didn't even click...
How does it... I didn't even click it on.

182
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:55,897
She's got a bush like a porcupine.

183
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:59,045
I don't wanna know anything
about her bush. Hi, Lynette.

184
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:09,487
- Suck it!
- Good bout, Gil. Sweet bout!

185
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,987
Good job.

186
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,321
Wow. Way to go, buddy.

187
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,930
- Great bout.
- Fuck off!

188
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:24,098
Bro, really sorry I lost my shit out there.

189
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,068
I just did not see that
In Quartata coming.

190
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,231
Hey, man, don't worry.

191
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:29,172
You know, you came in
with a pretty sweet glissade.

192
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,642
Anybody seen my manchette?

193
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,906
Did you look under your plastron,
dick wicker?

194
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,448
- Fuck you, Larry!
- Fuck you, Eugene.

195
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,711
- Classic.
- Thank you, Larry.

196
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:44,420
Hey, so you guys want to,
like, get some grub

197
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,548
or grab a beer or something?

198
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,253
We're actually heading up
to Joshua Tree tonight.

199
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:49,955
Oh, yeah? What's going on up there?

200
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,496
We're just doing this thing
for Eugene, you know.

201
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:55,523
Kind of a bachelor partylcamping trip
kind of thing, you know.

202
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,799
I didn't even know
you were getting married.

203
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,669
Yeah. Taking the leap next Sunday.

204
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:03,971
- Great.
- Dirty little slut.

205
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,443
He's gonna lose his virginity finally.

206
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:08,571
I've fucked my girlfriend. He's kidding.

207
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:13,085
Right on! Very cool.
Very, very cool. That's cool.

208
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:16,753
I would've invited you, man.
I just didn't think that you'd be into it.

209
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:18,916
You never really come out with us
after practice and stuff.

210
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,256
Oh, no, dude... Don't even.

211
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:24,854
It's so fine. Really.
Thanks, though. Thank you, but...

212
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:28,423
You know, it's funny, actually.
I just got engaged myself.

213
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:31,527
- Wow. That's awesome.
- You did? Congratulations.

214
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:33,196
<i>- Mazel tov.
- That's great.</i>

215
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:34,933
Good luck with that.

216
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,875
- Thank you. And you, too.
- Thanks.

217
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:39,504
Yeah.

218
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:42,542
All right, well,
we should probably hit the road.

219
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:43,604
- Traffic.
- Yes.

220
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:44,980
- Have a blast.
- Shotgun.

221
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,541
- We'll be back on Wednesday, right?
- Yeah.

222
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,883
Play a U2 record while you're there.

223
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,856
<i>- Good. 'Cause of Joshua Tree.
- That's right.</i>

224
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,389
It's hilarious, know what I mean?

225
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,767
No, I'm serious.
You know what my favorite nights are?

226
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,500
Hanging out with you girls,
and I can do that guilt-free

227
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:10,371
because Barry loves hanging out
with his friends, too.

228
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,604
I mean, every weekend,
there's a golf getaway,

229
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,509
a ski trip, a weekend in Vegas.

230
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,140
Wait, Vegas? You're not worried
he's gonna cheat on you?

231
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:21,084
He's 40 pounds overweight
with a Jewfro and a small dick.

232
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:23,019
Look, I love the guy to death,
but I'm far and away

233
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,522
the best-looking woman
he's ever gonna get,

234
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,080
and I'm only a 7, so, come on.

235
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,387
Oh, my God. You're not a 7.

236
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:40,970
Peter's not a freakazoid.

237
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,065
I don't know, Zo.
I mean, I think this is kind of serious.

238
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:45,667
A guy without friends
can be really clingy.

239
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:48,111
Like, my brother-in-law
drives my sister crazy.

240
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,149
He's always like,
"When are you gonna be home?

241
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,911
"Where're you going?
Can I come with you?

242
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:53,747
"But nothing's on TV.
What am I gonna do?"

243
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,015
- That's... No, come on. What the...
- "Be home before midnight. "

244
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,649
Peter's not like that. Please.
He's just not like that.

245
00:12:58,724 --> 00:12:59,918
Well, just wait.

246
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,483
But anyway, you've got six bridesmaids
and a maid of honor.

247
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,757
It's gonna be a little weird
if we're walking down the aisle alone.

248
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,492
- Yeah, I know.
- He's great.

249
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,966
- So who's gonna be his best man?
- I have no idea.

250
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:12,061
I honestly think that his best friend
is his mom.

251
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,868
- Terrible.
- No, no, no. Not like that.

252
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:16,571
Peter?

253
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,172
Peter?

254
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:23,110
Honey?

255
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:28,545
Hey!

256
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,588
- Hey!
- Hey!

257
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:34,324
I made you guys some root beer floats.

258
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:37,456
Peter, are those chocolate straws?

259
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,556
Yeah. Pirouettes. Pepperidge Farm.

260
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,397
Thank you so much for the floats, baby.
That was so sweet.

261
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,493
My pleasure. Enjoy.

262
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,562
- Hey, congratulations on the wedding.
- Congratulations!

263
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,067
I know. It's so exciting.
I feel so grown-up.

264
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,477
- All right, sir.
- Okay, ma'am.

265
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,642
Okay.

266
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,312
Shit! Do you think he heard us?

267
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,580
- No.
- No way.

268
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,519
I gotta get some fucking friends.

269
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,994
This is cool.
You're coming to me for help.

270
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,325
Well, the good news is
not only do I know men,

271
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:13,763
but straight guys are my specialty.

272
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,027
What does that mean?

273
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:18,264
I get bored pursuing gays.
I like to give myself more of a challenge.

274
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,828
- Yeah!
- Excuse me one second.

275
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:22,966
There you go, brother.
Dig deep, come on.

276
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:25,875
Push that shit out. Look at me,
I'm pinkies. I'm barely touching it.

277
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:30,109
You're clear. Locked it in, dude.
Nice job. Nice lift.

278
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,111
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.

279
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:34,346
All right, I'll see you around.

280
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,910
I hope so.

281
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,159
- That guy was totally flirting with you.
- I told you.

282
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:47,791
And did you see his wedding ring?
Straight as an arrow.

283
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,892
I'm telling you, hooking up is easy.

284
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,903
Meeting platonic male friends,
not so much.

285
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:53,962
So, what do I do?
I mean, how do I meet friends?

286
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,598
It's such a weird concept.

287
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:58,769
Well, I can do some recon
around the gym,

288
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:00,709
but you're gonna have to be
aggressive about this, man.

289
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,839
- Yeah, yeah.
- Use the Internet to meet guys.

290
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,280
Get Mom to fix you up.

291
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,648
I mean, if you see a cool-looking guy,
strike up a conversation

292
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,653
- and ask him on a man-date.
- A what?

293
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,313
- A man-date.
- Okay.

294
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:11,617
- You know what I mean?
- No.

295
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:15,024
By that, I mean a casual lunch
or after-work drinks, okay?

296
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,618
No dinner and no movies.

297
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,823
<i>You're not taking these boys
to see The Devil Wears Prada.</i>

298
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:21,197
God, I love that movie.

299
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,167
No, I won't. I got you.
I know what you mean.

300
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,670
This is really exciting.
We're gonna find you some friends.

301
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,936
- So I'm gonna... What do I do?
- You don't play much?

302
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,467
- I used to play a lot of Hearts in college.
- This is the same thing.

303
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:36,310
I don't even know why he called.
This guy hasn't even played poker.

304
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:38,816
I don't know.
I don't know, but it's Zooey's fiancé,

305
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:40,317
so just shut the fuck up and be nice.

306
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,946
Well, if I do this, we have sex
with the lights on when you get home.

307
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:45,490
- Really?
- Yeah. Like in Jamaica.

308
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,823
- Fine.
- All night long.

309
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,322
- Fine. Love you.
- All right.

310
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:56,124
My brother's a great guy, you know?
I mean, he's smart, he's...

311
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,130
Well, actually,
I don't know him that well,

312
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:01,765
but I'll give you five free sessions
if you take him out.

313
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,465
Go Beckham!

314
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:08,074
So glad Robbie hooked this up.
This is awesome! This is awesome!

315
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,945
- Me, too. This is really...
- Isn't this great, man? I love soccer!

316
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:13,850
Here we go, Galaxy! Here we go!

317
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,915
Here we go, Galaxy! Here we go!

318
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,855
Come on, Peter, stand up. Here we go...

319
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,119
Shut the fuck up!

320
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:22,490
All right, now people are really upset.

321
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,721
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!

322
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,627
- You shut up!
- Hey, watch the game!

323
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:29,598
Honey, he just moved to LA.
He barely knows anyone.

324
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,068
He's an architect.

325
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:33,867
His mother says
he's so excited to meet you.

326
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,373
<i>Robbie told me not to have dinner
with any of these guys.</i>

327
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:39,843
Your brother's a crazy person.
One dinner won't kill you.

328
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,846
- Doug?
- Peter?

329
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:44,682
- Hey.
- Hey.

330
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:49,853
- So you just moved here, huh?
- I did. Pretty recently.

331
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:53,858
A couple of weeks.
Fresh off the boat from Chicago.

332
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:55,555
Chi-Town.

333
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,186
- Windy City.
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,398
Da Bears.

335
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,457
Those sports guys.

336
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:07,939
<i>You know what else, the other old
Saturday Night Live one I love? The...</i>

337
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:11,067
What's the one Dana Carvey does
with the old lady who's like...

338
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:12,440
- Church Lady?
- Yes! Yes!

339
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,376
"Isn't that special?"

340
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,445
"Isn't that special?"

341
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,016
That sounded
kind of more leprechaun-y.

342
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,951
- It did?
- It did a little. Like a leprechaun.

343
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,493
Nice to meet you, too, Mel Stein.

344
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,527
<i>The picture's from
a couple of years back.</i>

345
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:38,064
Have a seat. I'm so happy
to meet you in person, you know.

346
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:42,371
Me, too. How long have you been
using the Internet?

347
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,501
Three or four years.

348
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:48,103
I didn't know anything about it
until a couple of years ago.

349
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,148
- You're good at it now.
- Thank you.

350
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:53,151
- And the big dog!
- There it is!

351
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:54,447
Let me ask you guys.
Let me ask you guys.

352
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,954
Beatles, Stones. On a count of three.

353
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,683
- One, two, three. Beatles.
- All in.

354
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:00,248
- Fuck you.
- I don't care.

355
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,351
- All in.
- You're an idiot.

356
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,520
That's you, pal.

357
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,587
I will call in.

358
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:06,790
- Too much for me.
- You're in.

359
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,299
- Anybody else? Just me and you?
- Yeah.

360
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:11,029
That's it? Pot right? Trip queens.

361
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:14,095
- Nice.
- Three ladies. Three ladies.

362
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:15,936
- Nice hand.
- Finally. Fucking finally.

363
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:18,272
- Wait, let's see what he's got.
- Yeah, let's see what he's got.

364
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:21,370
I have nothing. I have five spades.

365
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,608
- That's a flush.
- Yes, one, two, three...

366
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,115
Flush!

367
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:26,344
He's a fucking asshole.

368
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:27,716
- Relax.
- I'm not gonna relax.

369
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,915
- What?
- I said you're an asshole, Peter.

370
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,287
Don't take it too seriously.

371
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:35,327
What are you staying in
with seven deuce suited?

372
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:39,592
With a fucking rainbow rag flop!
Take the fucking chips. I'm buying in.

373
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,098
- I'm sorry...
- Just give me some more chips.

374
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,600
I didn't know it was a rainbow.

375
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,364
- Is the wine treating you well?
- It opened up beautifully. Thank you.

376
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,303
- Excellent.
- Come on.

377
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,373
- Hot. Hot.
- Oh, my God.

378
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,674
- She's so hot.
- She's smoking.

379
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:56,779
All right, Pete,
you done a boat race, right?

380
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:58,282
- No.
- Just drink the fucking beer,

381
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,250
- and you'll get the hang of it.
- I've got it. I will...

382
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,809
Doesn't matter who's winning.

383
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:02,876
It comes down to you and me.

384
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:04,422
- It's gonna be anchors.
- We're the anchors.

385
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,425
- Let's boat... Let's boat race! Race it up!
- Ain't no luck in boat racing.

386
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:10,087
One! Two! Three! Go!

387
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:12,995
Come on, Pete! It's all you, Peter!

388
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:14,532
Go, go, go!

389
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:18,765
Take him down!

390
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,238
- One more time!
- Let's go!

391
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:28,008
Come on! Go, Barry!

392
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,139
- Barry! Damn it, Barry!
- Fuck!

393
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:34,812
Yes! In your face! In your...

394
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:37,548
Holy shit!

395
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,093
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of my house.

396
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:45,153
- I'm so sorry.
- Just get out of my fucking house.

397
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,798
- I'm sorry.
- This is not cool! Get the fuck out!

398
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:52,770
I gotta tell you, Doug,
I really enjoyed this.

399
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,533
You know, I've been out
with so many jerks recently.

400
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:57,474
It's nice to meet somebody
I can have an actual conversation with.

401
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:58,976
- Let's do it again.
- I'd love to.

402
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:02,810
Okay. Tomorrow night. Matsuhisa, 8:00.

403
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:05,510
- I will see you there, sir.
- Awesome.

404
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,728
You've been so busy.

405
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:28,637
I've hardly seen you
these past couple weeks.

406
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,602
I know. I've been crazy at work.

407
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:33,838
I'm happy to see you now.

408
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:43,114
- Have you been kissing someone?
- No.

409
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:48,525
Peter, your mouth tastes like an ashtray.

410
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:54,262
Yes. I went to dinner with this guy,
and he kissed me.

411
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:57,229
What the fuck are you talking about?

412
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:59,794
My mom set me up with this guy,

413
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,999
and he thought I was gay,
and it was just...

414
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:03,666
It was a whole misunderstanding.

415
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:05,573
- Your mom set you up with a guy?
- Yeah.

416
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:07,373
You told me you were going to dinner
with a client.

417
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:09,744
- No.
- What the hell is going on?

418
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,340
Look, I overheard you
talking to the other girls

419
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:14,283
on your girls' night and...

420
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,411
I knew it.

421
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:18,456
Look, I know that you're stressed out
that I don't have any close friends,

422
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:21,015
so I've been trying to meet someone.

423
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:25,095
Right, you've been...
Okay, so that explains a lot.

424
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:28,156
I thought it was so weird
that you wanted to hang out with Barry.

425
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,895
- Yeah, exactly. That guy's a dick.
- Yeah.

426
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,234
- I threw up in his face.
- Yeah, I know. Denise told me.

427
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,535
- I threw up in his... A lot.
- Yeah.

428
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:37,769
- Projectiled.
- Yeah.

429
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:40,277
- That's a real thing.
- Yeah.

430
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:42,371
Well, I don't think I'm gonna
meet anybody by June 30th,

431
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:45,508
so our wedding party's
gonna be a little uneven.

432
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:49,111
Peter, I don't care.
I just want you to be happy

433
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,887
and to stop kissing strange men.

434
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,757
Wow, it's really smoky in there.

435
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:01,527
Yeah, he got up in there.

436
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,158
- Tongue?
- Oh, yeah.

437
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:05,169
You wouldn't mind brushing your teeth,
would you?

438
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:08,070
No. I've already done it
a couple of times.

439
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,064
I'll do the mouthwash again.

440
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:14,476
- There's some Tom's in the top cabinet.
- No, I gotta go with chemicals on this.

441
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:17,750
- I love you.
- I love you, too. I might use Comet.

442
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:42,299
It's a pleasure to meet you.

443
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:44,439
I live down there.

444
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:46,577
I like it. I'm liking it.

445
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:48,204
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

446
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,804
It's a good space, you know?
It's a good vibe.

447
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:51,406
- Yeah? Terrific.
- Yeah.

448
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,043
Well, when the Santa Anas
come through, it is majestic.

449
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,143
- Thanks.
- I'm excited.

450
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,244
- We'll let you know.
- Okay.

451
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,379
Thank you.

452
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,483
- Hello.
- Hi.

453
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,460
- Lf you need any help, just let me know.
- Thanks.

454
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,689
Sure.

455
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,836
Thank you for eating.

456
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:16,431
- I'm the first one, huh?
- Yeah.

457
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:19,534
I never understood why people
are so afraid to eat at an open house.

458
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:20,908
I know.

459
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:23,007
Why's Ferrigno selling?

460
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,879
He bought a place in Jackson Hole.

461
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,884
Yeah, I think he's tired
of the Hollywood grind.

462
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:27,976
Right.

463
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:30,954
You know, I've always wanted a pad
with a giant Lou Ferrigno statue,

464
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,150
so I think I've found it.

465
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:35,425
He's got one.

466
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:38,554
You're wasting your time
with that couple. Just FYI.

467
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:40,627
Why do you say that?

468
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:43,429
I saw the guy pull in.
He's driving a Saab 9.3,

469
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:46,835
which, I'm not a snob, it's a great car,
but it costs $30,000.

470
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:50,238
This house must be,
what, 4, $4.2 million?

471
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:52,038
Doesn't quite compute, right?

472
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:55,376
Well, I hope that's not the case.
He told me he was gonna make an offer.

473
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:58,780
I think he's trying to impress that girl
he hasn't slept with yet.

474
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:00,512
- The feng shui.
- Yeah.

475
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,350
How do you know that?

476
00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:06,450
Well, it's body language, you know?

477
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,121
Look, that guy needs to fart.

478
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:10,161
It's pretty clear,
but he doesn't know her well enough

479
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:12,823
to do it in front of her,
so I assume they haven't slept together.

480
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:16,334
- I like it. You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm good.

481
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:19,131
- He does seem to be clenching.
- Yeah, he doesn't wanna fart.

482
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:23,641
Watch. When he gets enough space,
he's gonna let one rip, I guarantee you.

483
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,734
That's a good move.

484
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:28,075
"Hey, go check out the kitchen, honey.
I'll meet you in there. "

485
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:30,240
- Okay. Yeah.
- Now watch.

486
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:34,245
He's making his move slowly.
Slowly but surely. Watch the leg.

487
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,755
Wait for it. Wait for it. Fart.

488
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:40,053
- Boom. That's a fart, motherfucker.
- Oh, my God.

489
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,752
- That's a fucking fart.
- Oh, my God!

490
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:45,263
Look at him crop-dusting across
your open house. It's a disgrace.

491
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,493
- He farted in my open house.
- He sure did.

492
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:50,657
You know what, guy?

493
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:54,001
I like it, but I'm thinking
it might be a little bit small.

494
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:56,472
Totally, and it smells like fart.

495
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:57,804
- What?
- Never mind.

496
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,309
Let's take off, baby. Come on.

497
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:02,245
Roll down the windows
in that car, sweetheart.

498
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:04,339
You called that.
That was like a play-by-play.

499
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,644
That's amazing. You called that!

500
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:07,947
- Yeah. Well, I know my farts.
- Unbelievable.

501
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,648
Well, listen, just full disclosure.

502
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:13,856
I have no interest in buying this house.

503
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:15,359
Well, then why are you here?

504
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:18,362
To eat your free food
and to try to meet a divorcée.

505
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,829
- Are you serious?
- I am.

506
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:22,298
Yeah. I've found
that at the classy open houses,

507
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,835
the spread is usually pretty decent,

508
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:29,067
and there's a beautiful bevy of attractive
and newly-single women.

509
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:33,568
I don't know what to say.
Thank you for your honesty.

510
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:37,542
Thank you for the sun-dried tomato aioli,
because it's a revelation.

511
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,580
- Wow. Hey, thanks for noticing.
- Yeah.

512
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,582
All right,
I'm gonna take this panini for the road.

513
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:45,646
There's an open house in Bel Air that
promises to be replete with cougars.

514
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:47,715
- You don't wanna miss that.
- No, sir.

515
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:49,852
- It was nice to meet you. Yeah.
- You, too.

516
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:52,021
Hey, you know what, here,
let me give you my business card.

517
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:53,587
- All right.
- In case you're looking for,

518
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:54,893
you know, a new home or anything.

519
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:58,061
I actually specialize in smaller houses,
bungalows, that kind of thing.

520
00:25:58,136 --> 00:26:01,196
- Lovely. Let me give you mine, as well.
- Okay.

521
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,038
- "Sydney Fife. "
- That is my name.

522
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:05,166
There you go.

523
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:07,075
Well, thank you
for the great open house.

524
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:08,908
- My plezh. Okay.
- All right.

525
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:11,609
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too, Sydney.

526
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:17,818
Hello.

527
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:21,951
I can't just call him.

528
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:23,289
Why are you being such a chickenshit?

529
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:25,626
He gave you his card.
It's an open invitation.

530
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,062
Engage your core.

531
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:29,362
It's beach season. It's beach season.

532
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,732
I hate this.
There's no rules for male friendships.

533
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:33,998
What are you freaking out about?
You went out with those other guys.

534
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:37,508
- I'm really nervous about this one.
- 'Cause you really like him.

535
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:41,535
All right, buddy, great set.
Take five, I'll come rub you down.

536
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:44,177
Look, if he does call,
no more dinners, okay?

537
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,581
- It's sending the wrong message.
- I know, I know.

538
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:50,645
Hey, Peter! I got an extra ticket
to the Galaxy game tonight!

539
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:55,557
You know what? Thanks, man,
I'm sorry, I can't. I got a function.

540
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:59,590
I got season ticks.
I'll get you on the flip side. Here we go.

541
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,963
Hey, thanks a lot
for hooking me up with Elmo over there.

542
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,525
- That was a blast.
- What? That guy's cool.

543
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:06,730
Here we go. Here we go.
Come on, push it out.

544
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:10,075
Everything you got! Everything you got!
Everything you got!

545
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,913
Yeah.

546
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:23,752
Just to...

547
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,382
Hey... Pathetic.

548
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,325
Sydney, how you doing?
It's Peter Klaven.

549
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:34,760
Hey, Sydney, it's Peter Klaven.
We met at the open house last week.

550
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:38,667
Get some guts, would you?
I got some cheese. Give me a break.

551
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,436
No. Oh, my God.

552
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:47,001
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Carolyn.

553
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:52,543
Sorry.

554
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,086
<i>Fife. You know what to do.</i>

555
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:58,748
Hey, Peter. It's Sydney Klaven.
No, that's not right.

556
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:03,890
Sydney, it's Peter Klaven.

557
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:07,523
I met you last week at an open house,

558
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,195
and I had a showing and...

559
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,533
Anyway, I was wondering
if you ever wanted to get together

560
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,946
and talk about real estate and whatnot.
Or whatnot. And...

561
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:25,813
- Hey, sugar.
- Hey.

562
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:34,258
I'm sorry, I forgot what I was gonna say.
What was I saying?

563
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:40,230
Yes, the open house and we met...
Anyway, no rush.

564
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:45,031
You call me back
whenever you get a mo. Get a moment.

565
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:49,005
And we will talk when I talk to you.

566
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:52,471
All right.
Hope you're having a great day.

567
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:54,102
Okay. Bye, now.

568
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:05,248
Fuck.

569
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:10,426
I'm fine with a little mercury poisoning
as long as it means I get to eat raw fish,

570
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,190
'cause I love it so much.

571
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:14,459
My doctor said it's really bad
if you're trying to get pregnant.

572
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,091
I heard that.

573
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:18,500
Which Barry and I are doing.

574
00:29:19,304 --> 00:29:21,772
Oh, my God, that's so exciting!

575
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:23,499
- I'm sorry.
- What?

576
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:26,168
I'm sorry.
I just pictured you and Barry having sex.

577
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:28,439
And he's so big and you're so tiny,
and I just...

578
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:31,107
- Hailey...
- Like, I totally imagined Barry just like...

579
00:29:31,183 --> 00:29:32,172
Okay, hold on, wait.

580
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,649
Why are you even imagining us
doing it anyway?

581
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:36,084
- I'm seeing it again.
- Well, stop! Stop! Cut it!

582
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:37,451
No, I love Barry.

583
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:38,819
- Hey!
- Hey!

584
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,755
- Hey! Hey!
- Hi!

585
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:42,191
- Hi!
- What are you doing here?

586
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,559
I just had a meeting downtown
with the owners of the development site,

587
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,121
so thought I'd stop in
and say hi on my way back to the office.

588
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,600
So, Peter,
how's your little manhunt coming?

589
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:52,830
Really, you told them? Shocking.

590
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:54,303
Well, I mean, Barry and his friends

591
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,237
said they had a great time with you
the other night.

592
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:57,865
- Seriously?
- No.

593
00:29:57,943 --> 00:30:00,309
Well, I just...
I don't drink that much and they pound.

594
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:01,470
They were pounding drinks.

595
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:03,070
Yeah, you're not used to drinking
that much.

596
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:05,241
Excuse me just a second.

597
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:08,810
Peter Klaven.

598
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:14,152
Excuse me just one...
Hey, Sydney. How are you?

599
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:15,720
Is that a man or a woman?

600
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:17,819
I don't know. I've never heard of Sydney.

601
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,896
I could be in Venice by 5:00, yeah.
I can do that.

602
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:25,069
It's a man-date. It's a man-date.
This is a man-date.

603
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:27,662
James' Beach Bar and Grill.

604
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:30,537
I look forward to it. Sounds great.

605
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:34,036
All right. I'll see you in a jiff.

606
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,515
- "See you in a jiff"?
- I don't know why I said that.

607
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:41,279
I've never said that expression before
in my life. I just said, "See you in a jiff. "

608
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:43,947
Honey, you're all flustered.
Who was that?

609
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:46,081
It was just this guy
that I met at my open house.

610
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:49,150
- Sydney something or other.
- Sydney. I like it.

611
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:53,163
- Oh, my God. Peter's got a boyfriend.
- And I don't.

612
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,459
Oh, God, why does everything
have to be about you?

613
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:55,557
Because I'm single.

614
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:13,344
I'm meeting him right now.

615
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:15,579
<i>Dude, no dinner.
He'll get the wrong idea.</i>

616
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:18,145
<i>You don't wanna get another
tongue-fucking at the valet stand.</i>

617
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,157
Yes, Robbie, I promise. No dinner.

618
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:22,955
<i>Dude, I'm pumped about this.
Call me when you get home.</i>

619
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:24,188
Yeah!

620
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:26,390
Thank you, bro.

621
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:31,394
All right, so you break it off
with your ex-girlfriend...

622
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,437
Yeah, and I met Zooey
the very next day.

623
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:35,700
Man, no laj between the vag?

624
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:40,038
- What does that mean?
- No lag time between vaginas.

625
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:41,938
Yeah, no. I don't...

626
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:44,641
I mean, I didn't plan for it
to be like that, you know,

627
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:47,048
with no laj, but it just happened.

628
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:49,349
All right. How's the sex?

629
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:52,613
That's a little private, wouldn't you say?

630
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:55,624
Look, it's something we think about
on a second-to-second basis,

631
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:58,993
and yet we're not supposed
to talk about it? Why?

632
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:00,791
Well...

633
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:05,594
I guess no one's ever really asked me
before, but it's good. Sex is good.

634
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,638
- Oh, boy.
- What, "Oh, boy"?

635
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:09,298
Well, your voice went up
when you said that.

636
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:10,636
So?

637
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:13,542
It means you weren't
being entirely truthful.

638
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:17,981
Look, I don't know this girl,
so you can talk to me. What's the deal?

639
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:24,451
I don't know, I guess maybe sometimes
I wish that she enjoyed, you know...

640
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:27,958
- Getting it in the tush?
- No. No, no, no.

641
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,153
- That's my bad.
- Oral sex.

642
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,860
She doesn't like to put it in the mouth?

643
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,434
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
I don't even know you. Forget it. Look.

644
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:42,371
Zooey's awesome,
and we have a great sex life.

645
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,000
We really do. I can't...
I don't even know why I said that.

646
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:49,137
Because you're speaking honestly,
all right? Relax.

647
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:51,813
And what about you?

648
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:54,242
- You ever been married?
- No.

649
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,480
For what I'm looking for,
divorcées are perfect, you know?

650
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:59,523
They don't want anything serious,
and neither do I.

651
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:02,458
Well, hey, man.
You know, if it works for you.

652
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,518
Believe me, Pistol, it is the best.

653
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:06,655
- "Pistol"?
- Yeah. Pistol.

654
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:10,928
- Because you're Pete. So Pistol Pete.
- Pistol Pete.

655
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:14,068
Excuse me,
you guys finishing up here soon?

656
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:16,665
No, sorry, chief,
we're actually staying for dinner.

657
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:19,403
No, actually, I already have
a dinner plan with my fiancée.

658
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,708
No, dude, this place
has the best fish tacos in the world.

659
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:26,576
Literally. Ranked.
You gotta have one or two.

660
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:30,753
It's the pico de gallo, man.
Just use your hands.

661
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:32,847
We're barbarians after all, men.

662
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:36,416
Every once in a while,
I go down to the Boardwalk

663
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:39,554
and I just throw my own feces
like a gorilla.

664
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:48,495
You all right?

665
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:51,269
How can you disagree with me on this?
I mean, look, my...

666
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:53,038
It's bad for the whole world.

667
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:55,511
My lease is gonna be up and I think...

668
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,980
- Are you talking about hybrid cars?
- Yes. Yes.

669
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,449
I thought you were talking
about hybrid animals.

670
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:01,917
- Hybrid animals?
- Yeah.

671
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,681
What the fuck is a hybrid animal?

672
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:07,191
It took Andre the Giant a barrel of beer
to get drunk, sometimes two.

673
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:10,489
- "Hello, pretty lady. "
- "Anybody want a peanut?"

674
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:13,664
Should we get a third order
of fish tacos?

675
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:17,467
Hands down,
best fish taco I've ever had in my life.

676
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,162
God, those tortillas were incredible.

677
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:22,536
Yeah, they make them in-house.
It sets up the flavor for the whole dish.

678
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:23,699
You know what?
I just realized something.

679
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:26,938
I never even asked you
if you were interested in buying a house.

680
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,377
No. No, why would I be?

681
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:31,640
Well, it's just when you called me back,

682
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:33,911
I didn't know if you wanted
to talk about real estate or not.

683
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,213
You just seemed like a good dude.

684
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:38,517
I thought I'd see if you wanted
to grab a beer. That's all.

685
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,080
I'm glad you called.

686
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:43,559
- You get home safe, Pistol.
- You got it, Joban.

687
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:46,225
I'm sorry, what?

688
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,123
Nothing.

689
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,691
- No, what'd you say?
- I don't know.

690
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,336
You... You nicknamed me Pistol,
and I just called you Joban.

691
00:34:56,741 --> 00:35:01,075
It means nothing. I don't...
I'm drunk. I'm gonna call a cab.

692
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,510
All right, man.
You have my number, yeah?

693
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:07,278
I got you stored in my iPhin.

694
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:11,152
- All right. If you need me, call, okay?
- Man, I'm golden.

695
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:13,884
- Yeah. All right, man.
- All right, bud.

696
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:17,490
Have a good night.

697
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:26,026
I don't know the number for a taxi.

698
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:34,174
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

699
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,739
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah, we did. Yeah.

700
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:40,080
Sydney's a cool guy. Got kind of drunk.

701
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:43,419
- Really?
- Yeah, I had to take a cab home.

702
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,116
- Really? Did you...
- Throw up in his face?

703
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:47,249
- Yeah.
- No.

704
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:48,553
- Good.
- So that's good.

705
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:51,254
That's good. So is he your best man?

706
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:55,360
It's way too early to tell,
but it's very sweet of you to ask.

707
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,859
Go back to sleep.
I'll be in, in a second, all right?

708
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,631
I just wanna see
if I got any hits on Ferrigno.

709
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:00,830
Okay.

710
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:10,310
- Whoomp! There he is! There he is!
- Stop it. Stop it.

711
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:11,678
- Ass, ass and titties.
- Stop it. Fucking stop it.

712
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:15,185
- Fuck, I'm ticklish, Tevin.
- Okay. Uncle. Uncle.

713
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:17,880
Hey. How was the open hizzy?

714
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:19,719
- The what?
- The open house.

715
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:21,349
The open house. It was great.

716
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:24,156
- Yeah? Did you flip that bitch yet?
- Yeah.

717
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:26,424
No. I mean, I've had a few nibbles.
No bites.

718
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:29,296
Nibbles? Me no likey nibbles.

719
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:32,268
- Peter, can I talk to you as a friend?
- Sure.

720
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:35,500
You're dealing with the house
of a major Hollywood celebrity,

721
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:38,974
Mr. Louis Ferrigno,
The Hulk from television.

722
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:41,170
Of course. I know that.

723
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:42,543
How badly
do you wanna sell this house?

724
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:45,242
- I need to. You know, for...
- I know you need to.

725
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:46,647
You gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

726
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:49,243
You gotta network.
You gotta meet a lot of people.

727
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,754
You gotta get them some leave-behinds.

728
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:54,815
- I have brochures.
- Brochures are totally different, okay?

729
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:57,157
- How?
- You see this picture right here?

730
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,661
- Yeah.
- Do you know who took it?

731
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,459
- No.
- M. Night Shyamalan,

732
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:02,932
<i>the director of The Village.</i>

733
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:05,401
- Okay.
- What's your bus-bench ad situation?

734
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,303
- I don't have any.
- What about urinal cakes?

735
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:10,864
- How about urinal cakes?
- Do you use them?

736
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:13,877
- When I pee.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

737
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:17,608
Go into any Olive Garden,
P.F. Chang's Chinese Bistro,

738
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:20,048
T.G.I. Friday's, Fuddruckers.

739
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:24,248
What do they have in the bathroom?
Urinal cakes with my face on it.

740
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:26,022
Does it... I don't see how that would...

741
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,785
I've had people come up to me
on the streets and say,

742
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:29,326
"I know you from somewhere. "

743
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,362
"Yeah, you do.
You pissed on my face, friend. "

744
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:33,897
I don't see how
having somebody piss on my face

745
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:36,365
is gonna be able to sell
Lou Ferrigno's house.

746
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:41,064
Peter, you got the steak,
but I got the sizzle, my nizzle. Right?

747
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,268
Why don't we split the listing. Okay?

748
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:46,902
Let me wet my beak on this action.
We'll both be winners.

749
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:49,941
I appreciate it, but I'd really like to try
and do this myself.

750
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:53,108
Yeah. Absolutely.
I'm just putting on my friend hat here.

751
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:56,176
- I appreciate it. All right.
- Whoomp! There he is!

752
00:37:57,522 --> 00:38:00,286
- Oh, jeez.
- Watch yourself, big girl.

753
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:16,404
- Fife.
- Hey, Sydney. It's the Pistol.

754
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:18,733
<i>Who?</i>

755
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,837
Peter Klaven from
the James' Beach thing the other night.

756
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,915
Hey, yeah, what's going on, man?

757
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:28,350
Yeah. Not much. I'm working like a dog.

758
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:32,349
But, you know, usual... The yoozh stuff.

759
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:35,915
<i>I was just calling to say, hey,
I had a great time the other night.</i>

760
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:39,191
Yeah, I had a nice time, man.
Those fish tacos are the tits.

761
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:42,790
Yeah, you know, if you ever wanna
grab lunch or something, nothing major.

762
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,391
Yeah. Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna take my puggle

763
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:46,334
for a little jaunt
on the Venice Boardwalk.

764
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:49,669
<i>- You should come meet me.
- All right. Yeah, great.</i>

765
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:52,266
Cool. Why don't you meet me
at Muscle Beach at like,

766
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:54,573
- I don't know, in a half an hour?
- Muscle Beach, half an hour.

767
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:58,377
I will see you there,
or I will see you on another time.

768
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:01,350
<i>That was very confusing.
I don't know if you're gonna come or not.</i>

769
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:04,911
<i>- No, I'll be there. I'll be there.
- All right, I'll see you then, buddy.</i>

770
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:07,890
All right. Laters on the menjay.

771
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:14,126
What did I just say?

772
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:16,827
He's a cross
between a beagle and a pug.

773
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:20,064
- The most beautiful dog in the world.
- He's cute. What's his name?

774
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:21,469
Anwar Sadat,

775
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:24,633
after Anwar Sadat,
former president of Egypt.

776
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:27,303
Right.
Because you're a fan of his policies or...

777
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,903
No, because they look exactly alike.

778
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:36,313
Hey, so how's Ferrigno coming?
You got any offers yet?

779
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:37,854
Not yet, no.

780
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:43,059
This guy that I work with, Tevin Downey,
he wants to share the listing with me.

781
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:44,625
What? And split the commission?

782
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,630
What about the land
you told me you wanted to buy?

783
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:50,930
It would put a delay on that,
but I gotta sell the place, you know?

784
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:53,869
Tevin's a total cheeseball,
but he markets himself like crazy.

785
00:39:53,938 --> 00:39:56,463
He's on bus-bench ads all over town.

786
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:59,038
You know,
he says the place is out of my league.

787
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,941
Hey, that is bullshit. All right?

788
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:04,209
That open house was understated.
It was classy and elegant.

789
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:06,443
I've been to a million of those things
and nobody,

790
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:09,145
nobody puts out
rosemary flatbread paninis.

791
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,688
Now hold on, my dog needs to shit.

792
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:13,917
Well, I'm trying to sell the place,
believe me, but...

793
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:17,654
Hey, no, Pete.
Trying is having the intention to fail.

794
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:20,061
You gotta scrap that word
from your vocab.

795
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:22,827
Say you're gonna do it and you will.

796
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,192
Come on, buddy. Good boy.

797
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:29,995
- You need a plastic bag or...
- No, I don't clean up after my dog.

798
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:31,837
Dog poop is like a compost.

799
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:33,843
It's got a ton of nutrients
that enrich the soil.

800
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:35,139
But we're on pavement.

801
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,273
God damn it!
How about cleaning up after your dog?

802
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,476
You mind your own fuckhole!

803
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:45,755
What the fuck? Psycho.

804
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,022
What was that?

805
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:53,222
I'm a man, Peter.

806
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:56,130
I've got an ocean of testosterone
flowing through my veins.

807
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,930
Society tells us to act civilized,
but the truth is we're animals,

808
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:01,597
and sometimes you gotta let it out.
Try it.

809
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:06,738
I'm not gonna start screaming
in the middle of the Venice Boardwalk.

810
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:08,278
Come with me.

811
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:13,977
- This is silly.
- Indulge me.

812
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,012
That was really good.

813
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,990
Now gently remove your tampon
and try again.

814
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:26,557
Respect the process.

815
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:28,559
Why do you wanna mock the process?

816
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:29,964
- Because it doesn't do anything.
- No.

817
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:32,901
If you don't yell,
I'm gonna punch you in your stomach.

818
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:41,577
That was really good, man.
That was terrifying.

819
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:43,580
You just scared my dog.

820
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:54,989
- Yeah? You feel better?
- Yeah.

821
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:56,185
- Want to get a corn dog?
- Yeah!

822
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,557
Let's go.

823
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:07,601
...the span of this, like, I don't know,
30 pages. It's insane. It's crazy.

824
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:10,766
I know. I read it in college, and I loved it.

825
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:12,771
What a great house.

826
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:14,812
Thanks, man.
Yeah, come check out the back.

827
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,073
Yeah.

828
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:20,213
- This is a bumper car I got on eBay.
- Wow.

829
00:42:20,284 --> 00:42:22,718
I was in a bidding war
with CarnivalKid 32,

830
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:25,585
so I had to go on the "Buy It Now" price,
but I got it.

831
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:27,214
- Coolness.
- And you remember Marlena.

832
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,315
Hey, Lenish.

833
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,087
<i>Now let's check out
the pièce de résistance, bitch.</i>

834
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:32,857
I wanna do it. Separate garage.

835
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:35,028
- Mr. Klaven.
- Very nice.

836
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:37,763
Welcome to the Temple of Doom.

837
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:40,770
Holy shit, Sydney. This place is insane.

838
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:43,332
Holy fuck. Oh, my God.

839
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:46,438
- Thanks, man. I try.
- This is amazing.

840
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,535
- Thank you, sir.
- You got some TVs.

841
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:50,240
I do. I do.

842
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:52,248
Photographs.

843
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:56,145
- Beer?
- I'll snake a brew.

844
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,450
- Put on some tunes.
- Is that you?

845
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,453
Yeah.
Yeah, that's me in ninth grade, man.

846
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:04,221
- Are you that little kid?
- Yeah, I was a late bloomer.

847
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:05,922
"Wrecking Crew. "

848
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,428
- Come and take a load off, bud.
- Oh, man.

849
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,126
Pop a squizz nut.

850
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:16,898
What's going on over there?

851
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:19,473
This is where I jerk off.

852
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:24,406
And the condoms?

853
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:28,345
- I wear them when I masturbate.
- Are you kidding me?

854
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:29,950
I always get this reaction,

855
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:33,889
but the fact is they decrease sensitivity
so I can last longer.

856
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:36,654
And there's no sticky mess to clean up.

857
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:42,894
And when your divorcées come over,
you put them away?

858
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:47,164
Pete, this is the man cave.
There's no women allowed in here.

859
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:49,968
I got a jerk-off station, for God's sakes.

860
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,531
Sit down, man.

861
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:55,006
What about when your guy friends
come over? Aren't you embarrassed?

862
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,675
Masturbation is a part of life, Pete.
Dudes masturbate. So do chicks.

863
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:02,748
You never talked about masturbating
with your friends?

864
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,412
- No, I haven't.
- All right.

865
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:06,479
When was the last time you did it, Pete?

866
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:07,717
I'm not gonna tell you that.

867
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,522
Hey. Listen, you think of this place
as a Cone of Silence, all right?

868
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:13,529
I'm not gonna tell anybody
any of the things you say in here.

869
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:15,258
You have my word.

870
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:23,670
Zooey went to the Pasadena flea market
with her friends last weekend,

871
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:25,538
and I did it then.

872
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:27,509
Well, that sounds lovely.

873
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:30,138
What'd you use? Internet or DVD?

874
00:44:30,214 --> 00:44:32,341
How do you get me
to tell you these things?

875
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:33,644
Come on.

876
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:37,244
I used a picture of Zooey in a bikini

877
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,516
that I took when we were on vacation
in Cabo San Lucas.

878
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,718
Wait, you jacked off
to a picture of your own girlfriend?

879
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:45,284
You... That... Wow. That is sick.

880
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:48,093
Oh, my God! What is wrong with you?

881
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:49,223
What's wrong with that?

882
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,794
Pedro, there is so much wrong with that,
I don't even know where to begin. It's...

883
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:58,908
- That is sick, man.
- Someone's ears were burning.

884
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:02,002
Heard you say you jacked off
to her picture, sicko.

885
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,410
Hey, babe.

886
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:07,851
Good. Yeah, I'm over here at Sydney's.
We're just chillaxing.

887
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:09,852
We're in the chill station.

888
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,718
Yeah, I'm kind of playing hooky
from work.

889
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:15,990
No, I'll see you at home later on.

890
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,960
Love you, too. Bye-bye.

891
00:45:20,531 --> 00:45:22,795
Hey, why'd you tell her
you bailed from work?

892
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:24,562
I didn't wanna lie to her.

893
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:27,297
You're one of the most honest people
I've ever met. You can understand that.

894
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:28,736
Yeah, I never lie to women,

895
00:45:28,806 --> 00:45:32,401
but, I mean, there are some things
I choose not to share with them.

896
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:35,309
- I don't really see the distinction.
- Really?

897
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:38,871
So you've told Zooey that you jacked off
to her picture last weekend.

898
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:40,075
Well, no, but...

899
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:42,745
All right. Well, you shared
that information with me, didn't you?

900
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,812
So there are dividing lines.
That's all I'm trying to say.

901
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,414
Like, I love to take a girl out to dinner,

902
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:49,356
but I'm not gonna go golf 18 holes
with her.

903
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:52,294
You know what? Zooey and I played golf
together a couple of months ago.

904
00:45:52,363 --> 00:45:56,026
- It was really fun.
- That sounds like a fucking nightmare.

905
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:00,196
What do you play?

906
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,399
I play a little bit of everything,
but if I had to narrow it down to one,

907
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,409
I guess I'd say I'm an axman.

908
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:09,473
- Sweet. Guitar.
- What about you? You play anything?

909
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:14,211
I used to slap the bass
in a high school jazz band.

910
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:18,048
- All right.
- Rush. I love Rush.

911
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:20,249
Dude, Rush is the greatest band
of all time.

912
00:46:20,324 --> 00:46:24,420
Yeah, no, how about of all time?
All time.

913
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:28,862
You know what? We should
jam together sometime, man.

914
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,595
Yeah. Totally.

915
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:34,798
Totes McGotes. Cool.

916
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:44,573
Well, you know what?
I should probably hit it to it.

917
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:46,874
All right, yeah.
I gotta get to bed early, anyway.

918
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:49,351
I'm doing a big day hike
with my buddies in Malibu tomorrow.

919
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,980
Yeah. Hey, thanks a lot. It was a really...
It was a good hang.

920
00:46:52,056 --> 00:46:54,183
- Yeah.
- Sweet, sweet hanging.

921
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,959
<i>- Well, adiós, Pistol.
- Take it easy, Siddy Slicker.</i>

922
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:03,794
- I'm sorry.
- What?

923
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:06,963
I called you Siddy Slicker.

924
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:08,828
- That sucks.
- No, it was pretty close.

925
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:11,067
It's a lame nickname.

926
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,367
I thought it was good.
It was better than Joban.

927
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:16,607
Yeah, right. I'm gonna get it.
I'll get a better one.

928
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,477
- Dude, it was fine.
- I'm gonna get you.

929
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:21,609
- Get out of here. Get out of here.
- I'm gonna get you, sucka.

930
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:23,482
Later on, my...

931
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:31,522
<i>Peter, I have a Lou Ferrigno for you
on line three.</i>

932
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:39,193
Put him through.

933
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,303
Mr. Ferrigno. Hey, it's Peter Klaven.

934
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,343
<i>Peter, what the hell's going on?</i>

935
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,174
Yeah. If you just go past the first area
to the left, he's right there.

936
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:52,306
- Sure. What's your name?
- Leanne.

937
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:54,442
Leanne. That was my mother's name.

938
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:57,453
- Really?
- I don't know. Was it?

939
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:00,719
<i>Peter, it's been on the market
for three weeks...</i>

940
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,520
<i>- Yes.
... and we haven't gotten one offer.</i>

941
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:05,585
And that's why we're having another
open house this weekend.

942
00:48:05,663 --> 00:48:07,460
Hello, mystery woman.

943
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:10,799
I think it was very beneficial,
very beneficial.

944
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:12,699
<i>Beneficial? It was beneficial?</i>

945
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,704
<i>So you're telling me
we're gonna sell this house?</i>

946
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,468
Absolutely,
and I've gotten many nibbles this week.

947
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:18,599
<i>- Nibbles?
- Yes, sir.</i>

948
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:20,268
<i>It's all about food with you, Peter.</i>

949
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:22,835
<i>No one cares about
the stupid sandwiches you put out.</i>

950
00:48:22,913 --> 00:48:25,848
No, sir. No, I absolutely agree with you.

951
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,851
You want to sell a house
and not a panini.

952
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:30,750
<i>- Paninis? Paninis?
- Yes, sir.</i>

953
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:31,879
Don't make him angry.

954
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:33,947
<i>Enough with the cold cuts,
the condiments.</i>

955
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:36,686
<i>- You wouldn't like him when he's angry.
- What the hell you think this is?</i>

956
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,456
No, I understand.
It's an open house and not a deli.

957
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,660
<i>- Peter? Hello? You need to focus.
- Yeah. Yep. I think...</i>

958
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:45,599
<i>- I think...
- Let people know my house is for sale.</i>

959
00:48:45,669 --> 00:48:48,832
<i>Forget about the sandwiches
and focus on selling my fucking house.</i>

960
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:50,897
<i>- Let's do this, okay?
- Yes, sir.</i>

961
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:52,067
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

962
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:54,906
<i>- Goodbye.
- All right, thank you. Bye-bye.</i>

963
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:57,746
You all right?

964
00:48:57,815 --> 00:48:59,749
- Hulk busting your balls?
- Yeah.

965
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:03,184
- What are you doing here?
- My blood bank's a few blocks away.

966
00:49:03,254 --> 00:49:07,281
I'm AB negative. It's extremely rare,
so I try to donate every couple of weeks.

967
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:08,791
That's really nice, Sydney.

968
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:11,885
There's also this nurse there
who I wanna fuck so badly.

969
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:14,931
Oh, boy, here we go.
Should have guessed.

970
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,865
Hey, weren't you supposed to go hiking
with your friends today?

971
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:21,564
Yeah, a couple of them had to bail,
but we'll reschedule.

972
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,834
Anyway, listen, I got a house full
of leftover Koo Koo Roo,

973
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:25,841
so I was thinking maybe you
and me could go grab some lunch

974
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:28,275
and squeeze in a little jam session?

975
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:29,642
Leftover Koo Koo Roo?

976
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:32,409
Well, that sounds
about as appetizing as

977
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:36,283
a big pile of...
A plate of dirt, or something.

978
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,054
I'm... I was... I'm kidding.

979
00:49:39,123 --> 00:49:42,286
Yeah. I still want to hang out
despite that joke.

980
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:46,192
- That was a bad joke.
- Yeah. You're better than that.

981
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:00,433
That's it.

982
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:03,372
- How's that feel?
- It feels tasty.

983
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:06,712
- Yeah? You sound pretty good, buddy.
- Thanks, man.

984
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:08,308
Here we go.

985
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:26,829
Wow, that's a good one, bud.

986
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:29,461
Hey, check out these two.

987
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,170
I call them bowsers. It's my nickname
for people who look just like their dog.

988
00:50:34,244 --> 00:50:35,302
Good boy.

989
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:37,313
Bowsers?
Where'd you come up with that?

990
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:38,939
It sounded right.

991
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:42,543
Shit. Hey, geek!
I just stepped in your dog's shit.

992
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:45,854
Now I'm gonna make you eat it.

993
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:47,856
Peter, run!

994
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:49,423
- Yeah!
- Take it.

995
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,965
It's a bit of a throwback, but it comes
with the built-ins. It's wired for sound.

996
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:02,198
This is fun.
This is a pair of jeans that he actually...

997
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:04,263
This house is exquisite.

998
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:07,300
I'd like to make an offer.

999
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:11,313
What do you think, hon?

1000
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:25,722
Yeah, I don't like that,
but for the most part, I mean...

1001
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:27,155
- Take it.
- Really?

1002
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:28,721
Yeah, take it.

1003
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,000
Sydney, what's up, man?

1004
00:51:32,803 --> 00:51:35,397
What happened? What?

1005
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:37,598
Shut up! No.

1006
00:51:37,841 --> 00:51:40,639
Did it smell weird? Is it discolored?

1007
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:53,113
Shut the fuck up!

1008
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,590
So how long have you guys
known Sydney?

1009
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:56,956
- It feels like forever.
- What?

1010
00:51:57,027 --> 00:51:59,291
Remember that time
we tripped acid together

1011
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:02,924
- and he made us watch the news?
- That was a remarkable night.

1012
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,025
- Dude. Dude. Don't. Dude.
- Don't be scared.

1013
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:07,297
- Stop it. Stop it. Drive! Drive!
- Don't lean! Don't lean!

1014
00:52:10,974 --> 00:52:12,066
Yeah, Pistol.

1015
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:14,777
Dude, Peter is on fire.

1016
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:21,207
- Boo-yah! Yeah!
- Fuck me raw!

1017
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:23,310
That's what I'm talking about.

1018
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:25,685
- Sweet lunge, Peter.
- Yeah, Pete.

1019
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:26,916
Suck it, Gil!

1020
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:32,826
I love it!

1021
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:34,989
Marvin Berry.

1022
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:39,330
"You remember
that new sound you were looking for?"

1023
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:50,040
Pete!

1024
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:53,815
- Are you all right?
- My fucking ass.

1025
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:55,875
- Hey, you did great today though, man.
- You did. You made it up.

1026
00:52:55,953 --> 00:52:58,478
- I made it to the top. First time.
- Good job, bro.

1027
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:01,055
- Hey, nice meeting you.
- Yeah, nice meeting you guys.

1028
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:02,989
- All righty, Syd.
- Wait, where you going?

1029
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:05,220
It's Sunday night.
Tina's nephews are coming over.

1030
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:07,422
<i>We're gonna watch
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i>

1031
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:09,466
No, it's just, I thought
we were all gonna have dinner together,

1032
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,330
so I ordered us a 6-foot sub.

1033
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:14,097
But I gotta bolt, too. I promised the kids
I'd take them to Cheeseria.

1034
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:15,229
A little pizza action.

1035
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:17,637
Yeah, well, I'm just gonna be stuck
at home grading papers tonight,

1036
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,539
but thanks anyway. All right?

1037
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,100
Fun day, guys.

1038
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:25,304
- Pete?
- Man, you know, on Sunday night,

1039
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:27,543
Zooey and I usually watch HBO.

1040
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:29,742
Right. Yeah, yeah, of course. Cool.

1041
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,948
But I can't let you eat
a 6-foot sub all by yourself.

1042
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,479
- Do you want some?
- No,

1043
00:53:34,558 --> 00:53:36,719
I had like a foot and a half
back at Sydney's. I'm golden.

1044
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:40,490
So, what do you guys do for, like,
seven straight hours?

1045
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:43,761
Whatever. I mean, like, we'll just
hang out, you know. Shoot the shit.

1046
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,563
Sometimes we jam a little bit.

1047
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:47,695
- You play an instrument?
- Yeah.

1048
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:49,636
I can't believe I've never told you.
I play bass.

1049
00:53:49,706 --> 00:53:53,039
- Really?
- Yeah. I slap the bass big time.

1050
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,273
What do you... What is that?
You sound like a leprechaun.

1051
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:58,075
- No, that's a reggae guy.
- What is that?

1052
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:00,082
- I just did reggae.
- It doesn't sound...

1053
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,378
- It doesn't sound reggae?
- No.

1054
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:03,385
- Slap the bass.
- No.

1055
00:54:04,354 --> 00:54:07,323
- How does it...
- It's like, big time, big time.

1056
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:10,360
- Big time.
- Big time. Slap the bass big time.

1057
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:12,821
Slap the bass.

1058
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:14,329
- That sounded like Borat.
- Yeah.

1059
00:54:14,398 --> 00:54:17,959
- Slap the bass. Big time.
- That's better. That's better.

1060
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:19,900
Syd and I have gotten pretty good
at a couple of Rush songs.

1061
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:22,131
What do you mean, like,
fast-paced rock?

1062
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:24,867
No, like, Rush. Like the band Rush.

1063
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:27,341
- I don't know them. The...
- The holy triumvirate.

1064
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:29,538
- Wait, you don't know Rush?
- No.

1065
00:54:29,613 --> 00:54:32,138
- You don't know Rush, the band?
- No.

1066
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:35,150
- "Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer"?
- No!

1067
00:54:35,652 --> 00:54:39,418
<i>All right, I'm gonna hit you up
with a little iTunes acción.</i>

1068
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:41,514
I cannot believe
you've never heard Rush.

1069
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:44,857
So when am I gonna meet this guy
who's stolen you away from me?

1070
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:46,052
Pretty soon, actually.

1071
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:47,426
I invited him
to that little engagement party

1072
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:48,794
my parents are throwing for us.

1073
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:51,732
Wow, Peter! This is serious.

1074
00:54:51,802 --> 00:54:54,293
It's mellow. Besides,
I wanted to introduce him to Hailey.

1075
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:57,135
- That's interesting. Yeah, I like that.
- Right?

1076
00:54:57,207 --> 00:55:00,142
Hey, let me ask you something.
Are you ready to get your world rocked?

1077
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,405
Ready! Yes.

1078
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:05,214
- Are you ready to get your mind blown?
- Do it!

1079
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:07,716
Do you want to get some Neil Peart
all up in you?

1080
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:09,217
I don't know.

1081
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:13,783
Well, prepare to be Rushified!

1082
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:24,095
- Sounds better on big speakers.
- I could see that.

1083
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:30,302
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

1084
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:36,740
- Do you do it that high when you do it?
- Well, in real life, I do it low.

1085
00:55:36,813 --> 00:55:39,611
- But air bass works best up here.
- Right.

1086
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:44,287
This is exactly what I look like
when I jam out, man.

1087
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:46,322
When I jam with my bass.

1088
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:50,888
Slap the bass, man.

1089
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:52,952
- There you go. There you go.
- I'm slapping the bass, man.

1090
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,898
Slap the bass, man. I slap the bass.

1091
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:58,127
Please don't do that.

1092
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,260
- Slap the bass.
- Please?

1093
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:01,634
Slap the bass.

1094
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:04,139
- For the sake of our relationship.
- Slap that bass.

1095
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:07,665
Please stop. Please. Please stop!
Thank you.

1096
00:56:07,744 --> 00:56:09,644
I'm slapping the bass.

1097
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:18,517
I'm so glad
you're celebrating at my restaurant.

1098
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:20,488
Of course, Mr. Chu.
We wouldn't go anywhere else.

1099
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:23,219
Hey, this is my brother, Robbie.
Robbie, this is Sydney.

1100
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:25,921
- Hey, Bro Namath.
- Nice. Nice to meet you.

1101
00:56:25,996 --> 00:56:29,432
- Peter, you remember Alan.
- From the gym.

1102
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:33,859
- Yeah, hey, man.
- Hi, good to see you again.

1103
00:56:33,937 --> 00:56:35,802
- Alan, I'm Sydney.
- Sydney, nice to meet you.

1104
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:36,998
It's a pleasure, man.

1105
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:38,439
All right.
We're gonna grab some drinks.

1106
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:41,500
- Cool, sweet.
- All right. Show them your stuff, fellas.

1107
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:43,443
- Hi.
- Hey.

1108
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:48,579
Zooey, this is Sydney.
Sydney, this is my fiancée, Zooey.

1109
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:51,917
Sydney, I'm so happy to meet you.
I've heard so many great things.

1110
00:56:51,988 --> 00:56:53,319
Same here. And let me tell you,

1111
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,553
this guy, he's gaga over you.
It's adorable.

1112
00:56:56,626 --> 00:56:57,684
- Honestly.
- It's true. It's true.

1113
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,093
- It's true.
- Guilty as charged.

1114
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:01,687
Hailey. Hailey.

1115
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:05,630
Sydney, this is my oldest friend
in the world, Hailey.

1116
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:07,897
- All right.
- Hi. I'm good.

1117
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:11,537
You didn't ask, but I'm good.

1118
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:13,371
- Nice to meet you, Sydney.
- It's a pleasure.

1119
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:16,471
Great. I told you we were early.

1120
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:18,013
- Would you shut up?
- It's supposed to be...

1121
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:19,673
The minute we get in
you have to start bitching already?

1122
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:20,978
- You told me it was a drop-by.
- You know what?

1123
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:22,541
- This isn't a drop-by.
- This is not a drop-by.

1124
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:24,246
It's a damn engagement party.
What is wrong with you?

1125
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:25,310
Can I have a Belvedere on the rocks,

1126
00:57:25,388 --> 00:57:26,377
- please?
- You're such an asshole.

1127
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:27,889
Could you just shut up
and not talk to people tonight?

1128
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,016
And something
with sour mix in it for her.

1129
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:30,753
I'm sorry they didn't cater this to you
and your liking.

1130
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:31,987
- Hey, guys.
- No...

1131
00:57:32,062 --> 00:57:34,030
- Hi, you look beautiful!
- Hey.

1132
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:35,689
- Hello, sweetie. How you doing, baby?
- Hi.

1133
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:37,233
- Thanks for coming.
- Hi.

1134
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,892
- You guys know each other.
- How you doing? Yeah, we do.

1135
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:41,199
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So...

1136
00:57:42,072 --> 00:57:45,064
- What do you got there?
- Sex on the beach. Yeah.

1137
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:48,509
You never know! Gotta be prepared.

1138
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:50,139
- The possibility.
- Wow.

1139
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:52,579
I'm just saying, you know.

1140
00:57:52,716 --> 00:57:54,741
- What is going on over there?
- Yeah, let me tell you.

1141
00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:56,251
- Is that her date?
- I'll give you the whole lowdown.

1142
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,752
Should we...

1143
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:02,722
What's up?

1144
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:05,861
Hey, I don't remember.
Do you play an instrument?

1145
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:08,762
- No.
- Because Syd and I, my buddy Sydney,

1146
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:13,132
- we've been jamming a lot...
- I don't play any instruments.

1147
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:17,071
I slap some bass,
and then Sydney's an axman.

1148
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,233
'Cause I was gonna say
if you wanted to jam with us,

1149
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:22,210
you know, that'd be cool.
But you don't have...

1150
00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:24,213
You have a piano in your house, though,
don't you?

1151
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:27,773
- Yeah, I don't play.
- Really? Why do you have a piano?

1152
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:30,144
The decorator put it there.

1153
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:33,986
Your... Does he... I thought...
No one plays?

1154
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:36,355
- I'm gonna go check on the table.
- All right. Yep.

1155
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:38,018
- Hi. I'm Denise.
- Hi.

1156
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:39,322
- Denise.
- I'm Zooey's friend.

1157
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:40,522
I've heard so much about you.

1158
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:42,792
- It smells like a fucking pet shop in here.
- Hi. How are you? Okay.

1159
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:46,063
- Mrs. Klaven, the banquet room is ready.
- And who's Mr. Sunshine here?

1160
00:58:46,136 --> 00:58:48,331
Hi. This is my husband, Barry.

1161
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:50,805
Come on back, everybody.
The banquet room is ready.

1162
00:58:50,874 --> 00:58:54,310
Well, I'm filling myself up.
I need to undo my pants.

1163
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:58,240
There's a lot of protein, but I love it.

1164
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:05,482
If I may, I think it's only fitting
that we're eating tonight at Hop Louie's

1165
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:07,182
because this is, after all,

1166
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:10,158
Peter's favorite restaurant
to bring all of his dates.

1167
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:14,027
So of course he would bring Zooey here
their first night out.

1168
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:17,294
- Just like the rest of them.
- No.

1169
00:59:18,602 --> 00:59:21,093
I remember that night when Peter
got home, he called me and he said,

1170
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:24,163
"Mom, this is the girl I'm gonna marry. "

1171
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:30,472
And it's not just because she wanted
an extra order of slippery shrimp.

1172
00:59:30,547 --> 00:59:32,071
On the first date?

1173
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:34,309
- Hey, now.
- Sometimes.

1174
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:38,515
But the point is,
here we are eight months later.

1175
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:40,714
Peter, Zooey,

1176
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:44,124
we love you,

1177
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:47,791
and we wish only the best for you both.

1178
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:51,698
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1179
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:53,258
- To Peter and Zooey.
- Cheers.

1180
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:55,429
- Cheers.
- Thanks, Mom.

1181
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:57,831
- Cheers, bro.
- Thanks.

1182
00:59:57,908 --> 00:59:59,899
Well, I promised Denise
we'd be gone after appetizers, so...

1183
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:02,274
You know what?
I'd actually like to just say a few words

1184
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:04,836
- if it's cool with the table.
- Wow.

1185
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:12,715
What an honor it is to be sitting here
with Peter and Zooey's friends, family,

1186
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:17,886
Hailey, Robbie's lover,
Robbie, Oz, Joyce.

1187
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:20,862
Thank you
for hosting this beautiful dinner.

1188
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:24,894
You got this guy
with the smoking hot wife.

1189
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:28,262
And finally, we got Zooey.

1190
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:32,640
Zooey, you are about to marry
one of the most honest,

1191
01:00:32,709 --> 01:00:36,611
kind and fun-loving people
I've ever had the honor of knowing.

1192
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:39,805
The Pistol is a pleasure-giver,
that's for sure.

1193
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:42,283
Yeah. A fucking puke pistol.

1194
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:45,879
And the thing about a man like that,
a man like Peter,

1195
01:00:45,956 --> 01:00:49,050
is that he never asks
for anything in return,

1196
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,093
and that's why I'm here.

1197
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:55,293
I'm here as Peter's friend,
as Peter's confidant,

1198
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,201
just to say to you, beautiful Zooey,

1199
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:04,638
give it back. Yeah?

1200
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,707
Return the favor.

1201
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:15,874
And if you do,

1202
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:20,821
I guarantee that you will have a beautiful
and pleasure-filled union.

1203
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:23,256
- I don't think she sucks his dick.
- Watch your mouth.

1204
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:27,057
With that, I'd like to raise a glass
to Pete and Zooey.

1205
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:30,293
Cheers.

1206
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:32,895
- Peter and Zooey.
- Cheers.

1207
01:01:38,842 --> 01:01:40,571
What the hell did you tell Sydney
about me?

1208
01:01:40,643 --> 01:01:41,871
Nothing.

1209
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:45,181
I mean, aside from how much I love you.

1210
01:01:45,248 --> 01:01:48,445
So, what was with all that
pleasure-giver stuff?

1211
01:01:50,186 --> 01:01:51,619
I don't...

1212
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:55,014
I might have mentioned in passing
or something

1213
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:58,322
that you don't like doing oral sex.

1214
01:02:00,497 --> 01:02:03,489
- Peter, that stuff is private.
- Is it? Really?

1215
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:06,399
And telling Hailey and Denise
about the hot tub in Mexico isn't?

1216
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:09,097
- That is so different. They're...
- What? How?

1217
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:10,935
- I've known them forever.
- So?

1218
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:12,838
Peter, see, Sydney's like a stranger.

1219
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:14,877
Hardly. He's become
a really good friend of mine,

1220
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:16,844
and now you know how I feel
when there's no privacy

1221
01:02:16,913 --> 01:02:19,882
- between you and your girlfriends.
- I thought you loved those guys.

1222
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:21,246
I do, I love them, but, you know,

1223
01:02:21,317 --> 01:02:24,480
some things I want to remain
between you and me.

1224
01:02:26,823 --> 01:02:28,688
Okay. Okay.

1225
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:38,289
By the way,
it's not that I don't like doing it.

1226
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:43,464
It's just that
Rodney just hated getting them.

1227
01:02:43,706 --> 01:02:46,072
Wait, what guy hates getting blowjobs?

1228
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:48,872
He had some weird
intimacy problems, okay?

1229
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:52,942
By the end of our relationship, he would
literally shiver when I touched him.

1230
01:02:53,016 --> 01:02:56,349
But before that, I always liked it.

1231
01:02:58,221 --> 01:02:59,586
I liked it.

1232
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:04,519
Great. That's great.

1233
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:07,760
Perfect. I mean, no pressure.
It's not like I'm saying,

1234
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:12,063
"Hey, let's go home tonight
and get some BJs. " But, you know...

1235
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:14,035
Look, if Sydney hadn't asked me
about our sex life,

1236
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:16,436
we wouldn't even be talking about this.

1237
01:03:16,506 --> 01:03:18,201
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1238
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:19,741
You're right.

1239
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:23,139
- And Hailey was really into him.
- She was?

1240
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:25,443
Yeah, she liked how honest
and direct he was with her.

1241
01:03:25,515 --> 01:03:28,848
And, yeah, I know, that's the way he is.
That's his thing.

1242
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:32,986
- The four of us should go out.
- Yeah. That'd be great.

1243
01:03:33,056 --> 01:03:34,182
Yeah.

1244
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,720
Sweet.

1245
01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:42,057
- Well, have a good Pilates class.
- I will.

1246
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:44,692
- Be sure to drink lots of water.
- Yeah.

1247
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:47,300
- Hey.
- Hey.

1248
01:03:48,638 --> 01:03:51,698
- Hey, Pete, let's go out back, yeah?
- Yeah.

1249
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,242
- She was very nice-looking.
- Yeah, I fucked her.

1250
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:02,577
I wonder if my pineapple
matches your pineapple.

1251
01:04:02,652 --> 01:04:04,552
Hey, you want to check?

1252
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:09,650
Nope. Yours is short and fat
and mine is long and skinny.

1253
01:04:09,993 --> 01:04:11,119
Yeah.

1254
01:04:12,662 --> 01:04:14,186
Pete, can I talk to you about something?

1255
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:15,729
- Yeah, what's up?
- Will you put down your treat

1256
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:17,322
for a minute?

1257
01:04:20,303 --> 01:04:24,706
I feel really horrible about that toast
I gave at your engagement dinner.

1258
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:26,298
It was ridonculous.

1259
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:28,742
I was really excited to meet Zooey
and your family,

1260
01:04:28,811 --> 01:04:32,042
and then I showed up there
and I was just... I got so nervous.

1261
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:33,844
It wasn't so great.

1262
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:37,649
I want you to know I'm really sorry.
Everybody must hate me.

1263
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,280
No, no, no.
Look, you had good intentions.

1264
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:42,415
- I did.
- I know one person that didn't hate you.

1265
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:46,428
Was it Benji's wife?
She's a hot piece of ass.

1266
01:04:46,496 --> 01:04:49,363
- No, Hailey.
- Yeah. She was funny.

1267
01:04:49,732 --> 01:04:51,700
I think she likes you.
We should all go out.

1268
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:54,896
She seems great, Pete, but honestly,
within five minutes of meeting her,

1269
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:58,407
she was telling me how she can't wait
to get married and have kids.

1270
01:04:58,474 --> 01:05:00,135
Look, she was kidding around.

1271
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:03,077
I made reservations to play golf
on Sunday for the four of us.

1272
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:05,444
No, Pete, I told you,
I don't play sports with women.

1273
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:08,609
Look, man, you told my fiancée
that she needs to give me blowies

1274
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:12,018
in front of my whole family, all right?
You owe me.

1275
01:05:12,822 --> 01:05:15,313
- You make a valid point.
- It's golf. It's fun!

1276
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:21,790
I never have a beer until the ninth hole.

1277
01:05:21,864 --> 01:05:23,627
Maybe we can change that rule.

1278
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,227
- Okay. All right.
- Keep your head down and fluid.

1279
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:30,067
- Okay. Okay.
- Great, come on. You got it.

1280
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:36,943
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

1281
01:05:38,948 --> 01:05:40,506
- Zooey, that was a great shot.
- Great shot.

1282
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:43,017
Really, really good. I'm really impressed.

1283
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:46,686
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1284
01:05:46,756 --> 01:05:50,419
- Fuck!
- Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry, Sydney. Sorry.

1285
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:55,328
Motherfucker!
Fucking cock in my fucking shit! God!

1286
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,824
- Mary.
- You okay, man?

1287
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,301
- I'm sorry.
- This is my nightmare!

1288
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:06,573
- Whack it up.
- Whack it, Hails.

1289
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:09,737
- Beautiful day.
- Yeah, it is. It's really nice.

1290
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:11,970
It's kind of frustrating.

1291
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:14,212
Yeah. My shin hurts.

1292
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:16,377
I didn't realize
my skin could bruise that quickly.

1293
01:06:16,452 --> 01:06:18,647
- You're good.
- Guys, you're killing us here. Seriously.

1294
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:21,019
- Let's get the ladies moving.
- Listen, just give me a second.

1295
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:24,787
Rate of play, rate of play, rate of play,
rate of play, rate of play.

1296
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:28,797
Hailey, you know what, why don't we just
pick it up and move down the fairway?

1297
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:30,196
- No, this is fine.
- Because she won't have a chance

1298
01:06:30,266 --> 01:06:31,961
- to practice, right, Peter?
- I got it.

1299
01:06:32,035 --> 01:06:34,503
He's kind of got a point. I mean,
we're really holding these guys up.

1300
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,834
You're being an asshole.
Hailey, just take your time, okay?

1301
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:38,999
He's really not being an asshole.
There's a protocol.

1302
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:41,009
The marshals come by,
and there is some time pressure.

1303
01:06:41,077 --> 01:06:43,102
- You know, I'm done. This sucks.
- Hailey, please...

1304
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:44,578
- I'm out of here.
- Please don't go.

1305
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:45,875
- Where are you going?
- Come on, Hailey. It's okay.

1306
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:47,711
- I apologize. I'm sorry.
- I mean, we'll... Come on, Hailey.

1307
01:06:47,784 --> 01:06:48,842
- Please come back.
- Where are you going?

1308
01:06:53,089 --> 01:06:55,319
- Did you say something?
- No.

1309
01:06:58,628 --> 01:06:59,959
Thank you.

1310
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,801
- Hey, man.
- Dude Von Dudenstein,

1311
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:12,238
<i>- what are you doing tonight?
- I just left you half an hour ago.</i>

1312
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:13,841
I'm watching HBO with Zooey.

1313
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:17,004
<i>I know, but I just got an e-mail alert
from the Rush fan club.</i>

1314
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,607
The Holy Trinity is playing
a small club gig tonight at the Avalon.

1315
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:23,711
Dude, it's Sunday night.
I can't bail on her again.

1316
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:25,117
Dude, you have your whole life

1317
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:27,349
to sit around
and watch premium cable with Zooey.

1318
01:07:27,423 --> 01:07:29,357
<i>Whatever, it's our ritual. It's HBO.</i>

1319
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:30,756
It's not TV, it's HBO.

1320
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:33,261
Have you ever watched Sunday night
programming on HBO? It's spectacular.

1321
01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:34,796
It's fucking Rush.

1322
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:40,200
<i>I haven't seen them
since the Signals tour.</i>

1323
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:43,673
Can I invite Zooey?

1324
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:19,803
- Slapping the bass!
- Slapping the bass!

1325
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:01,576
What the fuck?

1326
01:09:02,318 --> 01:09:03,410
Yeah!

1327
01:09:20,703 --> 01:09:25,003
My God. We could practice every day
for six months, and I'm planning on it,

1328
01:09:25,074 --> 01:09:28,271
and we'll still suck. Yeah.
I'll give you a call.

1329
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:30,944
All right. Take it easy, Magooch.

1330
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:37,745
- Were you spying on me?
- Yeah, I was.

1331
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:42,286
Because I'm totally weirded out
about what's going on between you two.

1332
01:09:43,025 --> 01:09:45,550
What are you talking about?
We were just going over the set list.

1333
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:47,823
- I mean, what's the big deal?
- The big deal is

1334
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:50,024
that we were supposed to have
a date night,

1335
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,329
and you took me to this concert,
which is cool,

1336
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:54,528
but then we get there
and it's like I don't even exist.

1337
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:59,837
You don't even look at me.
You're licking Sydney's bass guitar.

1338
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:02,707
There were tons of guys
that were licking each other's basses.

1339
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:06,373
I just...
I feel like I'm losing you a little bit.

1340
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:09,879
What? We were just doing
a recap of the set list.

1341
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:11,849
- What? Zooey.
- Okay.

1342
01:10:12,255 --> 01:10:14,485
I was going over the set list.

1343
01:10:15,725 --> 01:10:18,057
So the big day's coming up.
How are you feeling?

1344
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:19,788
Well, you know,
I was feeling really good,

1345
01:10:19,862 --> 01:10:22,956
but Zooey and I have been
fighting a lot recently.

1346
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:25,796
All right, let me ask you a question.
Why are you marrying her?

1347
01:10:25,868 --> 01:10:27,665
What kind of question is that?

1348
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:30,729
Well, it seems to me like you've gone
from relationship to relationship,

1349
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:34,708
so is Zooey the one
or is she just the next one?

1350
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:36,301
No, she's the one.

1351
01:10:36,379 --> 01:10:38,040
All right, well, how come?

1352
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:39,342
Because.

1353
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:43,041
I don't know. We're in love.

1354
01:10:43,986 --> 01:10:45,578
And...

1355
01:10:46,822 --> 01:10:48,653
That's a hard question to answer.

1356
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:53,321
Listen, I'm not trying to push you at all.
It's just for me,

1357
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:56,661
sometimes talking this stuff out helps
to clarify things. That's all.

1358
01:10:56,866 --> 01:10:59,164
Let's go try on some penguin suits.

1359
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:03,866
Thank you, lovely. What's your name?

1360
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:05,567
- Raquel.
- That was my mother's name.

1361
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:11,136
So I'm thinking about asking Tevin
if he wants in on the Ferrigno house.

1362
01:11:11,213 --> 01:11:14,182
Dude, I pissed on that guy's face
at a Bennigan's.

1363
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,717
You do not need
to be splitting commission

1364
01:11:15,785 --> 01:11:18,310
with that frosty-haired chode.

1365
01:11:20,856 --> 01:11:23,654
I have to face facts, Syd.
I'm a flats guy, you know?

1366
01:11:23,726 --> 01:11:26,661
Tevin's got the flash needed
to sell the place.

1367
01:11:27,129 --> 01:11:28,426
What do you think?

1368
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:29,862
You look fucking stiff.

1369
01:11:29,932 --> 01:11:32,298
We're shopping for tuxedos
for your wedding, man.

1370
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:34,563
Let's have a good time.
Loosen it up a little bit.

1371
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:37,606
I wanna take a photo.
Now, give me an action pose.

1372
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:39,300
Like what? What do you mean?

1373
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:42,970
Well, you're wearing a tuxedo.
What do you think I mean?

1374
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:47,911
When have you ever seen
anyone in a tuxedo do that move?

1375
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:49,545
<i>Besides Runaway Bride.</i>

1376
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:50,745
The ESPYs.

1377
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:53,414
You're wearing a tuxedo.
Think James Bond, all right?

1378
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:55,514
Give me some James Bond.

1379
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:01,920
No.
It just looks like you're pointing at me.

1380
01:12:05,935 --> 01:12:08,961
- You look ridiculous, man.
- What am I... How can I... I can't...

1381
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:11,598
- Think Timothy Dalton.
- T-Dalt.

1382
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,133
Hey, that's pretty good.

1383
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:16,811
Tell you what.
Give me your best Bond impression.

1384
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:19,074
Why don't you get off your board

1385
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:22,675
and get on...
"Get out of my dreams and into my car. "

1386
01:12:22,952 --> 01:12:24,510
You looking for your pot of gold?

1387
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:26,646
Why does everything I do
sound like a leprechaun?

1388
01:12:26,722 --> 01:12:29,623
You tell me. He speaks
like the coolest man on earth.

1389
01:12:29,692 --> 01:12:32,490
- The name is Bond. Oh, yeah.
- There you go.

1390
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:34,893
The name is James Bond.

1391
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:37,827
James Bond.

1392
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:41,128
I'll have a margarita.

1393
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:46,070
Well, hey there, Miss Moneypussy.
Wanna jump on my jetpack?

1394
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:49,806
All right, enough of that.
Let's just take the picture, all right?

1395
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:52,470
Arch an eyebrow for me. Other eyebrow.

1396
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:56,881
No, you just look confused.

1397
01:12:57,219 --> 01:13:00,313
Arch your eyebrow up.
No, not both, just one.

1398
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:02,289
I don't know how...

1399
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:06,422
All right, maybe I was wrong.
Let's see the back.

1400
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:10,126
You know what?
I'm not sure I'm in love with the drape.

1401
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,497
What's wrong with the drape?
Does the vent move funny?

1402
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:14,331
You should wear something
with a little more pizzazz, right?

1403
01:13:14,403 --> 01:13:15,870
- A little more flash.
- You don't like the split panel?

1404
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:17,838
- Peacock it out a bit.
- No.

1405
01:13:17,907 --> 01:13:20,034
- Let's try...
- What are those? Checkers?

1406
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:21,633
- Here. Give this one a try.
- Give me a break.

1407
01:13:21,711 --> 01:13:22,735
- No way, man.
- Come on.

1408
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:25,007
I can't fricking pull that off. It's blue.

1409
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:26,105
Look at me.

1410
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:30,346
You have this image of yourself
as this straight-laced, tight guy,

1411
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:33,718
but I've seen you cut loose
in the man cave, and it is fantastic.

1412
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:36,121
Well, yeah. Slap a little bass.

1413
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:38,285
Yeah, it's the same
with the Ferrigno house.

1414
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,796
You have all of the skills in the world,
and you have no confidence.

1415
01:13:41,864 --> 01:13:43,832
Now, sack up, man.

1416
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,494
Put on the fucking suit.

1417
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:51,636
I can't believe you just touched my balls.

1418
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:58,135
Hey, so listen, I also wanted
to talk to you about something.

1419
01:13:58,214 --> 01:14:02,207
This investment opportunity
has come up. It's a total winner.

1420
01:14:02,284 --> 01:14:04,582
The only problem is
all my funds are tied up in equities,

1421
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:06,780
so I'm cash poor right now.

1422
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:12,987
So I was wondering if you would
consider loaning me a few shekels?

1423
01:14:15,498 --> 01:14:17,796
How much are we talking about?

1424
01:14:18,634 --> 01:14:21,125
You know, 8.

1425
01:14:23,806 --> 01:14:27,708
$8,000. That's... That's a lot of...

1426
01:14:28,544 --> 01:14:33,140
That's a lot of quiche, you know?
A lot of cake.

1427
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:35,411
It just... It might be a little tricky,

1428
01:14:35,484 --> 01:14:37,816
just 'cause Zooey's dad
is out of the picture,

1429
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:41,015
and, you know,
we're paying for the wedding ourselves.

1430
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,352
You know what? Enough said.

1431
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:45,825
An opportunity came up.
I thought I would ask. No big deal.

1432
01:14:46,495 --> 01:14:48,224
Can you tell me about the investment?

1433
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:51,994
I can't, actually.
It's confidential in nature, so...

1434
01:14:53,135 --> 01:14:54,727
Okay. Let me think about it.

1435
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,396
Yeah, of course, buddy.

1436
01:14:57,072 --> 01:14:58,562
Hello, Peter.

1437
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:00,101
Doug!

1438
01:15:02,411 --> 01:15:04,436
- This is my...
- Sydney.

1439
01:15:04,513 --> 01:15:07,243
Sydney. This is Sydney.

1440
01:15:09,552 --> 01:15:10,849
You know, it takes a lot of nerve

1441
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,979
to spend a beautiful evening
with someone

1442
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:15,387
and then never call them again.

1443
01:15:16,258 --> 01:15:17,452
Doug, I can explain.

1444
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:19,756
I just wish I could take back that kiss,

1445
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:22,297
because I felt something
that I haven't felt in years,

1446
01:15:22,364 --> 01:15:25,663
and now I know
it was the taste of betrayal.

1447
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:27,395
It wasn't the taste of betrayal.

1448
01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:28,993
- It was the taste of betrayal.
- No, it really wasn't.

1449
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:32,336
It was the taste of betrayal,
you fucking whore.

1450
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:35,470
- Doug.
- Good day.

1451
01:15:35,544 --> 01:15:37,068
Doug, wait.

1452
01:15:37,947 --> 01:15:41,144
- I can actually explain what just...
- I would love to hear that.

1453
01:15:41,984 --> 01:15:45,283
Wow. I mean, I knew when I got
the nod for the engagement dinner

1454
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:48,790
you didn't have a ton of friends,
but I had no idea it went that far.

1455
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:52,385
Truth is, I never even thought about it
until Zooey and I got engaged.

1456
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:54,520
It's like,
you were basically just using me

1457
01:15:54,597 --> 01:15:56,497
because you needed
to fill out your wedding party.

1458
01:15:56,565 --> 01:15:59,033
Dude, no. Not it at all.

1459
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:02,299
I'd actually given up
on meeting someone,

1460
01:16:02,838 --> 01:16:06,672
and then you wandered
into that open house, we hit it off,

1461
01:16:07,443 --> 01:16:10,901
and three-quarters of the Rush
songbook later, here we are.

1462
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,949
- I just wish you'd have told me.
- Well, I was embarrassed.

1463
01:16:14,016 --> 01:16:17,042
I mean, you've had a close group
of male friends your whole life. I haven't.

1464
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,781
I started feeling
like some kind of weirdo.

1465
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:24,883
I get it. But I just want you to know
that you're my friend,

1466
01:16:25,327 --> 01:16:27,591
and you can tell me anything.

1467
01:16:27,663 --> 01:16:30,097
Thanks, Sydney. I appreciate that.

1468
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:34,459
Hey, man, look, about that investment...

1469
01:16:34,536 --> 01:16:36,663
Pete, please,
forget I even brought it up, honestly.

1470
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:38,138
I've been saving my whole life,

1471
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:40,072
and you were right.
I'm gonna sell the Ferrigno place.

1472
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:42,110
Fuck, yeah, you are.

1473
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:45,413
I'd be happy to lend you the money.
I know you're good for it.

1474
01:16:46,248 --> 01:16:48,842
Pistol, that is great. Thank you.

1475
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:53,046
It's the least I could do
for the best man at my wedding.

1476
01:16:55,457 --> 01:16:57,448
What are you talking about?

1477
01:16:57,793 --> 01:17:00,887
I want you to stand up there with me.
Are you cool with that?

1478
01:17:00,963 --> 01:17:02,260
Am I cool with that?

1479
01:17:02,331 --> 01:17:05,926
Of course I'll be your best man!
That's an honor! It's...

1480
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:12,339
You're a whore, Peter.

1481
01:17:16,245 --> 01:17:18,213
- I think we're almost there.
- I think we're almost there, too.

1482
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,976
I think it's just about putting
the random people together.

1483
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,109
- Yeah.
- We should talk about the main table,

1484
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:26,814
because if Hailey doesn't find a date
before the wedding,

1485
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:30,086
which, let's be honest,
it seems pretty likely that she won't...

1486
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,626
I know.

1487
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:33,457
...we have an extra seat at our table.

1488
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:36,987
Well, I was thinking that maybe
Sydney would sit at our table.

1489
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:39,330
I asked him to be my best man.

1490
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:43,304
Great! That's awesome.
That was the whole thing.

1491
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:46,170
I'm not an idiot.
You're not psyched about this at all.

1492
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:49,904
No, it's just...
I feel like he has some issue with me.

1493
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:52,675
What? No. You guys just haven't
spent any time together.

1494
01:17:52,748 --> 01:17:55,148
- We've spent some time together.
- I'll talk to him.

1495
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:56,445
Peter, do not talk to him.

1496
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:58,452
He's gonna think
I'm saying stuff behind his back.

1497
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,752
- You are saying stuff behind his back.
- No. I'm just sharing a feeling with you.

1498
01:18:02,825 --> 01:18:04,190
And I want you to.

1499
01:18:04,259 --> 01:18:06,193
But, Peter,
please don't say anything to him.

1500
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:07,888
Okay, I won't.

1501
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:11,426
So, we still have
to pick up the marriage license.

1502
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,492
- Can you meet up tomorrow afternoon?
- Totally, yeah. Perfect.

1503
01:18:15,004 --> 01:18:17,336
So, what'd she say
about me being your best man?

1504
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:20,239
She was pumped.
She thought it was awesome.

1505
01:18:20,309 --> 01:18:21,799
Come on, dude.

1506
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:25,574
I'm the worst liar.
I promised her I wouldn't say anything.

1507
01:18:25,948 --> 01:18:27,916
Well, what is it?

1508
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,577
She thinks you don't like her.

1509
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:34,213
What? That is... No, of course I like her.
Are you...

1510
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:35,620
We've only hung out a few times,

1511
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:38,854
but she's gonna be your wife.
Of course I like her.

1512
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,896
This dumb toast
is gonna haunt me forever.

1513
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:45,389
Oh, man!

1514
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:50,171
Dude, why is Ferrigno eating
with that urinal-cake-faced fuckhead?

1515
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,298
We gotta confront him. Hold this.

1516
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:54,501
No, wait. Sydney, wait, wait.
Wait. Sydney!

1517
01:18:54,576 --> 01:19:00,071
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck is going on here?

1518
01:19:00,482 --> 01:19:02,643
- Do I know you?
- No, you don't know me,

1519
01:19:02,718 --> 01:19:04,845
but I believe you know
my friend Peter Klaven,

1520
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,150
who has an exclusive listing
on this man's property.

1521
01:19:07,222 --> 01:19:09,349
Lou, you promised Peter
the commission to your house.

1522
01:19:09,425 --> 01:19:10,983
I know, but he's not doing shit with it.

1523
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:12,821
That is total crap, Hulk, all right?

1524
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,125
Listen, this kind of stuff
doesn't happen overnight.

1525
01:19:15,197 --> 01:19:16,323
Peter, who the hell is this guy?

1526
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:18,298
Hulk, let me tell you something
about Peter...

1527
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:21,530
Look, please get your hand out of
my face and stop calling me Hulk.

1528
01:19:21,603 --> 01:19:22,729
I'm a person, okay?

1529
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:24,170
I'm a person, okay.

1530
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,399
- I warned you.
- You warned me?

1531
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:26,498
- Hello?
- Hey.

1532
01:19:26,575 --> 01:19:27,906
I'm on my way to the marriage bureau.

1533
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:29,466
<i>Fuck you, Lou Ferrigno!</i>

1534
01:19:29,545 --> 01:19:30,569
Is that Sydney?

1535
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:32,510
- Hey!
- Fuck you, Hulk!

1536
01:19:33,449 --> 01:19:34,814
Oh, shit.

1537
01:19:35,517 --> 01:19:36,814
What the... What are you doing?

1538
01:19:36,919 --> 01:19:39,251
<i>- What's going on?
- Sydney. He's fighting Lou Ferrigno.</i>

1539
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,414
<i>Peter! He's so strong!</i>

1540
01:19:41,623 --> 01:19:43,887
- Easy. Don't fight it.
- The Hulk has me in a sleeper hold,

1541
01:19:43,959 --> 01:19:47,258
- and I don't think I can take him...
- Easy. That's it.

1542
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:48,523
<i>Peter!</i>

1543
01:19:48,797 --> 01:19:50,458
<i>- Wow.
- Peter!</i>

1544
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:53,366
Why the fuck would anyone
get in a fight with Lou Ferrigno?

1545
01:19:53,435 --> 01:19:55,926
Sydney's a hothead.
He thought he was standing up for me.

1546
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:57,528
To The Incredible Hulk?

1547
01:19:57,606 --> 01:20:02,305
No, that's just a character he played.
In real life, Lou's actually a sweet man.

1548
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:06,114
So, what does that mean
for your development property?

1549
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:08,478
It means it's over.

1550
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:11,380
Without the Ferrigno commission,
I'm not gonna be able to afford it.

1551
01:20:11,453 --> 01:20:12,613
You have some money saved up.

1552
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:16,283
Can't you just write them a check,
you know, to show your good faith?

1553
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:20,727
Between the wedding, and then,
you know, I lent Sydney some money.

1554
01:20:20,796 --> 01:20:23,356
I mean, it's just I'm gonna be short.
That's it.

1555
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:27,266
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You lent Sydney money?

1556
01:20:27,736 --> 01:20:29,966
For an investment.
All his money's tied up in equities.

1557
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:32,768
- He's gonna pay me back.
- Peter, that's not the point.

1558
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:36,504
We're getting married. You can't
just keep stuff like this from me.

1559
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:38,603
Can I ask you a question?

1560
01:20:39,948 --> 01:20:42,439
Why do you think we're getting married?

1561
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:45,453
What are you talking about?

1562
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:47,580
No, it's just... Sydney asked me
that question, and I couldn't...

1563
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:50,989
"Well, why Zooey?"
And I didn't know how to answer it.

1564
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:54,688
- Are you kidding? You're kidding, right?
- Yes.

1565
01:20:54,763 --> 01:20:56,663
Two weeks before our wedding

1566
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:59,360
and you don't know
why you're marrying me?

1567
01:20:59,434 --> 01:21:02,426
Just forget it. It was a stupid question.
I don't even know what I was thinking.

1568
01:21:02,504 --> 01:21:06,167
Just forget... Take it back 10 seconds
before I asked it,

1569
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:07,640
and let's live in that time.

1570
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:11,338
The thing is, Peter,
I get why you would wonder that. I do.

1571
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:15,611
But I wish you would have answered
the question before you proposed to me.

1572
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:18,346
That's the thing.
Before I didn't even think about it.

1573
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:20,411
That came out bad, too.
I didn't... I'm so...

1574
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:22,013
I'm confused.
I don't know what I'm saying.

1575
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,887
Let me just make this
a little simpler for you.

1576
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:26,086
I'm gonna go stay
with Denise and Barry,

1577
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:29,961
and you and your bud Sydney
can hang out and beat up Lou Ferrigno

1578
01:21:30,032 --> 01:21:31,363
and go to Rush concerts

1579
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:34,960
and ride a tandem bicycle down
the Venice Boardwalk for all I care.

1580
01:21:35,037 --> 01:21:37,699
- We never rode bicycles.
- Goodbye!

1581
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:41,675
Zooey, come on! This is ridiculous!
Zooey! Zooey!

1582
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:15,200
Oh, my God.

1583
01:22:24,686 --> 01:22:25,914
My God.

1584
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:31,024
All right, he put up some billboards.
Put up some billboards.

1585
01:22:31,927 --> 01:22:33,394
Oh, my God.

1586
01:22:37,466 --> 01:22:39,525
Oh, God! No!

1587
01:22:40,936 --> 01:22:45,100
Fuck me over. Fucking fucking fuck!

1588
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:48,305
Are you kidding me?

1589
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:51,841
Come on!

1590
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:00,915
Yeah, it's open.

1591
01:23:01,456 --> 01:23:02,480
Hey.

1592
01:23:02,557 --> 01:23:04,957
That's what you borrowed $8,000 for?

1593
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:06,892
You saw the billboards.
Pretty awesome, right?

1594
01:23:06,962 --> 01:23:07,951
Pretty awesome?

1595
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:10,464
My buddy Dave sells ad space,
so he got us a great deal.

1596
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:12,159
Pretty awesome? They're idiotic.

1597
01:23:12,234 --> 01:23:15,567
You put my face on a 10-foot dick
over Santa Monica Boulevard.

1598
01:23:15,637 --> 01:23:17,400
Yeah. It's hilarious.

1599
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:21,340
Well, in one day you managed to screw
my career, you ruined my relationship...

1600
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:23,503
What are you talking about?
Ruin your relationship?

1601
01:23:23,578 --> 01:23:24,602
Zooey walked out on me

1602
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,581
because I asked her
why we were getting married.

1603
01:23:29,151 --> 01:23:30,516
Why would you ask her that?

1604
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:33,645
Pete, that conversation
was between you and me.

1605
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:37,283
You can't have that talk with her. I just...
Look, I assumed you understood that.

1606
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:40,328
God, I am so sick
of your ridiculous rules.

1607
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:43,027
I like it that I can share things
with Zooey.

1608
01:23:43,098 --> 01:23:46,864
I like it that if I can't sleep at night,
she's there to talk to.

1609
01:23:47,269 --> 01:23:50,033
Do you know the best night
I've had in the last five years

1610
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:52,266
is the night
that Zooey and I split a bottle of wine,

1611
01:23:52,341 --> 01:23:55,276
<i>we made a summer salad,
and watched Chocolat together.</i>

1612
01:23:55,344 --> 01:23:57,107
<i>- You mean Chocolate?
- Chocolat.</i>

1613
01:23:57,179 --> 01:23:59,147
<i>- Chocolate with Johnny Depp.
- Chocolat.</i>

1614
01:23:59,214 --> 01:24:01,239
<i>You're not fucking French, Pete.
It's called Chocolate.</i>

1615
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:02,340
<i>Chocolate has got an "E" on it.</i>

1616
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:03,782
- That was your favorite night?
- Yes.

1617
01:24:03,885 --> 01:24:06,615
<i>Your best night in five years is
watching Chocolate with Johnny Depp?</i>

1618
01:24:06,688 --> 01:24:07,712
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1619
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:11,156
<i>The combination of wine
and summer salad and Chocolat, yeah.</i>

1620
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:12,284
You should be embarrassed.

1621
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:14,329
You know, I think you're threatened
by what Zooey and I have

1622
01:24:14,396 --> 01:24:16,455
because you're afraid
I won't be able to hang out every night.

1623
01:24:16,531 --> 01:24:19,022
Hey, you know what?
I have a ton of friends, all right?

1624
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:21,160
Yeah, who are all moving on
with their lives.

1625
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:25,035
They're in relationships. They have kids.
They're growing up.

1626
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:27,234
Hey, let's not forget.
You were the one using me.

1627
01:24:27,309 --> 01:24:30,039
- I think we were using each other.
- Whatever.

1628
01:24:30,712 --> 01:24:34,011
I really don't understand
what's going on right now.

1629
01:24:35,851 --> 01:24:38,513
I think we should spend
some time apart.

1630
01:24:43,091 --> 01:24:44,217
Okay.

1631
01:24:46,495 --> 01:24:48,360
So if I actually do
wind up having a wedding,

1632
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:51,957
it's probably best that you not be there.

1633
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:55,427
Yeah. Sounds good to me, Pete.

1634
01:24:55,504 --> 01:24:57,165
And if you could have
those billboards taken down...

1635
01:24:57,239 --> 01:25:01,005
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it'll take
a few days, but I will get on that.

1636
01:25:01,076 --> 01:25:05,137
And I'll also make sure you get
your money back as soon as possible.

1637
01:25:05,213 --> 01:25:09,013
<i>Also, I think you have
my season 2 Lost DVDs. If you...</i>

1638
01:25:10,452 --> 01:25:14,821
- If you haven't watched them yet...
- It's fine, Pete. They're right here.

1639
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:18,782
- Thanks.
- Yep.

1640
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:22,020
It's just Zooey hasn't seen them all yet,

1641
01:25:22,097 --> 01:25:25,191
and she's really curious as to what
was going on inside that hatch.

1642
01:25:25,267 --> 01:25:26,393
Yep.

1643
01:25:28,637 --> 01:25:32,630
- I wish you the best of luck, Peter.
- You, too, Sydney.

1644
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,773
Bye, Anwar.

1645
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:52,851
- Hey, Denise. Sorry to bother you.
- It's... I'll go get Zooey.

1646
01:25:52,928 --> 01:25:54,987
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1647
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:01,135
- Hey, Barry.
- Poker night.

1648
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:04,104
- Full table.
- That's okay.

1649
01:26:04,172 --> 01:26:06,606
I'm here to talk to my fiancée.

1650
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:07,699
Nice face.

1651
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:10,300
Thank you.

1652
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:13,509
- On the billboards.
- Right. Yeah.

1653
01:26:14,182 --> 01:26:17,709
- Yeah, my friend Sydney, he...
- I don't give a shit.

1654
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:22,546
- Hey.
- Hi.

1655
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:26,491
- Could I talk to you outside?
- Yeah.

1656
01:26:29,197 --> 01:26:31,825
- License to sell.
- Yeah.

1657
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,334
Look, that's what Sydney borrowed
all that money for.

1658
01:26:34,402 --> 01:26:36,097
He thought it would help my career.

1659
01:26:36,171 --> 01:26:38,435
Well, it got your name out there.

1660
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:41,704
Besides, you look pretty cute
with a thick mustache.

1661
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:46,676
Zooey, look,
I'm so sorry that I asked you

1662
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:48,113
why you thought we should get married.

1663
01:26:48,183 --> 01:26:50,117
It's just that I've been talking
about this stuff with Sydney,

1664
01:26:50,185 --> 01:26:52,210
and, you know, it made me nervous.

1665
01:26:52,287 --> 01:26:55,745
Peter, I'm nervous, too, okay?
It's a big deal.

1666
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:58,884
I couldn't believe actually how sure
you seemed about the whole thing,

1667
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,828
which is why I freaked out when you
all of a sudden started questioning it.

1668
01:27:02,898 --> 01:27:05,492
Well, I'm sure about us
for so many reasons.

1669
01:27:05,567 --> 01:27:08,593
Truth is, I've been a girlfriend guy,
but out of all those girls,

1670
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,934
you're the only one
that wanted me to have my own life.

1671
01:27:11,006 --> 01:27:14,942
You know? You want me
to have friends for me, not you.

1672
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:18,911
It's, like, one of the most romantic
things I could ever think of.

1673
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,504
What's up?

1674
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:23,981
Dude, come on.

1675
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:28,313
Zooey, I love you, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

1676
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:31,216
Can we get this engagement
back on track?

1677
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:32,317
Okay.

1678
01:27:32,394 --> 01:27:34,794
- Please?
- Yes. Yes.

1679
01:27:36,865 --> 01:27:38,594
- Come on, it's poker night.
- So?

1680
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,134
So just take her out for a cup of coffee
or something.

1681
01:27:40,201 --> 01:27:41,395
I'm not taking her out for a cup of coffee.

1682
01:27:41,469 --> 01:27:43,767
Why don't you take the boys
to fucking Starbucks and play poker?

1683
01:27:43,838 --> 01:27:46,102
Because it's poker night here.
It's always poker night here.

1684
01:27:46,174 --> 01:27:47,198
Yeah, that's my best friend.

1685
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:48,970
I'm not leaving her, ever.
How about that?

1686
01:27:49,044 --> 01:27:51,478
She can stay here for five years
if she wants to.

1687
01:27:51,546 --> 01:27:53,707
You're gonna dress up like
a cheerleader tonight for me, all right?

1688
01:27:53,782 --> 01:27:55,215
Fine. Get the fuck out of here.

1689
01:27:55,283 --> 01:27:59,049
Hey, Zooey, you can stay here as long
as you want. You are always welcome.

1690
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,554
- Thank you.
- Okay? Hey, by the way,

1691
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:04,615
Peter, they've got plenty of room open
on the poker table.

1692
01:28:04,693 --> 01:28:06,718
They were lying.
They'd love to have you play poker.

1693
01:28:06,795 --> 01:28:08,695
- I'm not going to.
- Okay.

1694
01:28:09,898 --> 01:28:11,923
Oh, my God.
Barry and Denise fight all the time,

1695
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,900
and then they have really loud,
intense make-up sex.

1696
01:28:13,969 --> 01:28:14,993
Please get me out of here, please.

1697
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:16,662
- Let's get your stuff. Come on.
- Okay.

1698
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:18,729
By the way, I ended things with Sydney.

1699
01:28:18,807 --> 01:28:21,071
Peter, really?
I hope that's not because of me.

1700
01:28:21,142 --> 01:28:25,511
No, no. He can be a great guy. It's just...
It wasn't really working out.

1701
01:28:29,517 --> 01:28:31,542
Then you process your purchase.

1702
01:28:31,886 --> 01:28:33,877
That sounds riveting.

1703
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,524
I just stepped
in your dog's crap, asshole!

1704
01:28:41,997 --> 01:28:45,398
Aren't you gonna pick up
your dog's shit, shit giant?

1705
01:28:45,467 --> 01:28:47,697
Pick up your shit like a man!

1706
01:28:47,769 --> 01:28:49,600
Nice scarf, dickwad!

1707
01:28:49,804 --> 01:28:53,797
<i>- Okay, so what should be our last song?
- Into the Mystic.</i>

1708
01:28:54,509 --> 01:28:56,374
That's perfect. That is perfect.

1709
01:28:56,444 --> 01:28:59,641
Okay. Okay, so we have to go
through the place cards one more time,

1710
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:01,705
'cause I'm a little bit...

1711
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:05,482
Why don't you just call him?

1712
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,412
Because guys don't do that.

1713
01:29:11,526 --> 01:29:16,225
E, Ethan. What's up, my man?
E. Bone Capone.

1714
01:29:16,464 --> 01:29:18,091
I'm just hanging out, man.

1715
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:20,566
I wanted to see if you wanted to come
over and watch TV or something.

1716
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:23,399
<i>Again you're gonna watch
the Wonder Emporium?</i>

1717
01:29:24,773 --> 01:29:27,537
Dude, what the fuck is there
to do at LEGOLAND

1718
01:29:27,609 --> 01:29:29,440
that you take these kids there
every weekend?

1719
01:29:31,413 --> 01:29:34,746
I understand that
that's not the point of teaching,

1720
01:29:34,816 --> 01:29:36,249
but just give them all B pluses.

1721
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:39,243
Can I... Could I come with you?

1722
01:29:41,022 --> 01:29:43,786
What do you mean,
the kids think I'm creepy?

1723
01:29:44,926 --> 01:29:47,486
- Good to see you, Peter.
- You, too, Mel.

1724
01:29:47,562 --> 01:29:51,965
You know, I haven't had a real friend
since my wife passed.

1725
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,698
I'm really glad you called.

1726
01:29:56,337 --> 01:29:59,534
Hey, do you have any plans
on June 30th?

1727
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:04,870
I'm 89 years old. What the fuck
kind of plans would I have?

1728
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,710
<i>Just needed an adjustment.
I hope it'll be better now.</i>

1729
01:30:11,786 --> 01:30:16,450
<i>My mother knew Roux's return
had nothing to do with the silly old door.</i>

1730
01:30:19,494 --> 01:30:21,189
<i>So did I.</i>

1731
01:30:21,596 --> 01:30:23,120
Stupid.

1732
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:24,631
<i>My favorite, hot chocolate.</i>

1733
01:30:25,066 --> 01:30:26,624
Davis Dunn, how may I direct your call?

1734
01:30:26,701 --> 01:30:28,726
- Hey, Leanne.
- Peter. Where have you been?

1735
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:31,101
Well, it's my wedding this weekend,

1736
01:30:31,172 --> 01:30:34,630
so I've been helping my fiancée
with all the last-minute preparations.

1737
01:30:34,709 --> 01:30:36,301
They broke the mold
when they made you.

1738
01:30:36,377 --> 01:30:37,366
Yeah.

1739
01:30:37,445 --> 01:30:39,606
Go check your voice mail.
You got like a million messages.

1740
01:30:44,886 --> 01:30:46,513
<i>Yeah, is this Pistol Pete?</i>

1741
01:30:46,588 --> 01:30:48,715
<i>I have a home in Los Feliz,
and I've been trying to sell it,</i>

1742
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:51,884
<i>and I saw your billboards.
I'm very impressed with your ads.</i>

1743
01:30:52,026 --> 01:30:55,052
<i>License to sell? That's hysterical!
It's like James Bond.</i>

1744
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:57,291
<i>Hi, I'm interested
in buying the Ferrigno estate.</i>

1745
01:30:57,365 --> 01:30:58,730
<i>- Lf you could give me a call.
- Oh, my God.</i>

1746
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,395
<i>I love the one with you in the bed.
My number is 310...</i>

1747
01:31:02,804 --> 01:31:04,567
<i>- My husband and I saw your ad...
- Stop. Slow down.</i>

1748
01:31:04,973 --> 01:31:07,237
<i>Hello, Peter. It's Doug.</i>

1749
01:31:07,709 --> 01:31:10,542
<i>Saw the billboards. They are wonderful.</i>

1750
01:31:10,612 --> 01:31:15,311
<i>Wouldn't expect anything less from you.
And sorry about calling you a whore.</i>

1751
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:18,150
<i>And hello to Sydney
if you guys are still together.</i>

1752
01:31:18,219 --> 01:31:20,187
<i>Otherwise, you can Facebook me.</i>

1753
01:31:20,588 --> 01:31:23,921
<i>Peter, hi. It's Lou Ferrigno.
Wonderful billboards.</i>

1754
01:31:24,225 --> 01:31:26,159
<i>Listen, I'm sorry
if I ever doubted you, man.</i>

1755
01:31:26,394 --> 01:31:28,123
I told that douchebag Tevin

1756
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:30,494
that I want you to have
the exclusive back on my house.

1757
01:31:30,565 --> 01:31:31,691
- Excuse me, Mr. Ferrigno?
- Yeah.

1758
01:31:31,766 --> 01:31:33,734
- Ten-minute warning.
- Okay. Thank you.

1759
01:31:33,802 --> 01:31:36,134
So just call me or just text me.

1760
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:38,168
<i>Goodbye, my friend.</i>

1761
01:31:43,945 --> 01:31:45,640
There's my dog!

1762
01:31:45,713 --> 01:31:48,375
Hey, me rikey the billboards.

1763
01:31:48,449 --> 01:31:50,917
I completely underestimated you,
my brother.

1764
01:31:50,985 --> 01:31:53,579
What say we go down to Houston's,
get a burger and a beer

1765
01:31:53,655 --> 01:31:57,091
and talk about how we can tag-team
the Ferrigno deal?

1766
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:05,197
Why are you slapping me?

1767
01:32:05,266 --> 01:32:07,427
Because I wanted
to cause you some physical pain,

1768
01:32:07,502 --> 01:32:10,869
but I have never actually hit anybody
in the face. It freaks me out.

1769
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:13,407
And I didn't really know what to do.

1770
01:32:13,474 --> 01:32:16,409
Tevin, stay the fuck away
from my listing.

1771
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:26,378
- Hey, Carolyn.
- Hey, Pete.

1772
01:32:27,956 --> 01:32:29,958
Good luck, Peter.

1773
01:32:40,535 --> 01:32:43,868
I'm so excited to see who Peter chose
for his wedding party.

1774
01:32:43,938 --> 01:32:45,428
Yeah. Yeah.

1775
01:33:04,726 --> 01:33:06,751
Honestly, that has to be
the most random

1776
01:33:06,828 --> 01:33:09,194
collection of groomsmen
in the history of weddings.

1777
01:33:09,364 --> 01:33:11,525
- I'm great. You know, I just got to...
- Okay.

1778
01:33:11,599 --> 01:33:12,896
I'll see you at the wedding.

1779
01:33:12,967 --> 01:33:14,992
I'm gonna get another mimosa.

1780
01:33:15,069 --> 01:33:17,435
Do you want to finish the one...

1781
01:33:38,826 --> 01:33:40,054
Hello?

1782
01:33:40,895 --> 01:33:43,887
Hey. Wow,
I didn't expect to hear from you.

1783
01:33:45,366 --> 01:33:47,800
No, I wouldn't want to impose.

1784
01:33:49,404 --> 01:33:51,304
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe if I hurry, I can make the end of it.

1785
01:33:51,372 --> 01:33:54,569
Okay, I gotta go.
I gotta find something to wear.

1786
01:34:05,853 --> 01:34:08,413
Which one of these men has the ring?

1787
01:34:08,756 --> 01:34:13,022
I actually don't have a best man, so...

1788
01:34:15,096 --> 01:34:18,429
Robbie, I want you
to hold the ring for me.

1789
01:34:19,467 --> 01:34:21,401
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1790
01:34:24,272 --> 01:34:27,298
- Okay.
- Unless you don't want to. I mean...

1791
01:34:29,544 --> 01:34:30,738
Thanks, Peter.

1792
01:34:30,812 --> 01:34:32,780
So sweet.

1793
01:34:32,847 --> 01:34:37,648
Hey, I want you boys to know,
you're both my best friends

1794
01:34:40,321 --> 01:34:42,221
and Hank Mardukas.

1795
01:34:43,324 --> 01:34:44,814
Hey, Hank.

1796
01:35:22,964 --> 01:35:24,192
Awesome tux.

1797
01:35:24,766 --> 01:35:27,360
- Thanks. It's blue.
- Yes, it is.

1798
01:35:27,435 --> 01:35:29,699
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

1799
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:34,469
Good afternoon.
We are gathered here today

1800
01:35:34,542 --> 01:35:38,171
to join Peter Klaven and Zooey Rice
in matrimony.

1801
01:35:38,913 --> 01:35:42,610
If anyone can show just cause
why they may not marry...

1802
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:44,744
You son of a bitch!

1803
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:47,549
No, no, Mr. Ferrigno,
I don't wanna object.

1804
01:35:47,622 --> 01:35:50,614
I just wanted to make it in time
for the vows. That's all.

1805
01:35:50,691 --> 01:35:52,420
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1806
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,359
Sydney, come up.

1807
01:35:54,429 --> 01:35:56,158
No, I'm fine back here.

1808
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:58,721
- Please, yes. Yes.
- Are you sure?

1809
01:35:59,667 --> 01:36:01,601
I hope you don't mind.

1810
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:03,364
You invited him?

1811
01:36:10,344 --> 01:36:12,869
Well, I saw you walking
on the lawn looking all sad,

1812
01:36:12,947 --> 01:36:17,179
and I realized I couldn't let you
get married without your best man.

1813
01:36:20,388 --> 01:36:23,323
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

1814
01:36:23,558 --> 01:36:25,549
Zooey, thanks so much for inviting me.

1815
01:36:25,626 --> 01:36:28,527
Of course. You got here really fast.

1816
01:36:28,596 --> 01:36:30,359
Yeah. You know what,
I was on the Vesp,

1817
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:33,662
so I just did the old weaveroo.

1818
01:36:34,302 --> 01:36:37,237
Dude, you're lying.
Your voice went up when you said that.

1819
01:36:37,305 --> 01:36:39,136
His voice got high.

1820
01:36:40,675 --> 01:36:42,472
Look, I was on my way
when Zooey called.

1821
01:36:42,543 --> 01:36:46,206
Invite or not, there was no way
I was gonna miss your wedding,

1822
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,612
and I wanted to give you this.

1823
01:36:51,552 --> 01:36:53,486
Man, you don't have to do this.

1824
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:54,680
You know what?
I know you don't believe me,

1825
01:36:54,755 --> 01:36:57,417
but I'm actually
a pretty successful investor, so...

1826
01:36:57,492 --> 01:36:59,687
Look, the billboards
were my wedding gift to you guys.

1827
01:36:59,794 --> 01:37:00,920
Man, they worked.

1828
01:37:00,995 --> 01:37:03,828
Yeah, I figured when I saw the Ferrigs
that they must have worked.

1829
01:37:03,898 --> 01:37:05,661
- That's great.
- Lou's the best.

1830
01:37:05,733 --> 01:37:07,223
I can only imagine.

1831
01:37:10,071 --> 01:37:13,598
I put him in a sleeper hold. Out.

1832
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:15,899
Sydney, I'm really sorry
for all the stuff that I said.

1833
01:37:15,977 --> 01:37:19,936
Pete, you called me
on a lot of my issues. I appreciate it.

1834
01:37:20,181 --> 01:37:23,446
<i>And for the record, I saw Chocolat.</i>

1835
01:37:24,318 --> 01:37:26,081
Just delightful.

1836
01:37:26,654 --> 01:37:27,643
It is, right?

1837
01:37:27,822 --> 01:37:29,346
<i>- I love Chocolat.
- I love that movie.</i>

1838
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:32,252
<i>- Chocolat? What the fuck is that?
- I have no idea.</i>

1839
01:37:32,326 --> 01:37:33,953
It's a beautiful movie.

1840
01:37:34,862 --> 01:37:37,330
I'm really glad you're here, Sydney.

1841
01:37:38,332 --> 01:37:39,594
Me, too.

1842
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:42,932
I can't even imagine getting married
without you.

1843
01:37:46,607 --> 01:37:48,268
I love you, man.

1844
01:37:48,943 --> 01:37:50,774
I love you, too, bud.

1845
01:37:54,949 --> 01:37:57,349
- I love you, dude.
- I love you, Bro Montana.

1846
01:37:57,418 --> 01:38:00,080
- I love you, holmes.
- I love you, Broseph Goebbels.

1847
01:38:00,154 --> 01:38:02,645
<i>- Love you, muchacha.
- I love you, Tycho Brohe.</i>

1848
01:38:02,723 --> 01:38:06,591
Okay. Okay. Right. Let's continue here.

1849
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:09,255
- I so wanna marry you.
- You will.

1850
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:10,524
I'm going to.

1851
01:38:10,598 --> 01:38:11,963
Zooey, repeat after me.

1852
01:38:12,033 --> 01:38:14,467
- I, Zooey Rice.
- I, Zooey Rice.

1853
01:38:14,535 --> 01:38:17,527
- Take you, Peter Klaven.
- Take you, Peter Klaven.

1854
01:38:17,605 --> 01:38:21,541
- To be my lawfully wedded husband.
- To be my lawfully wedded husband.

1855
01:40:08,082 --> 01:40:10,380
I'm really sorry
about that dumb toast I gave.

1856
01:40:10,451 --> 01:40:13,045
It was out of line. I got really nervous
to meet you and I'm...

1857
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,020
I don't know what happened to me.
I'm sorry.

1858
01:40:15,089 --> 01:40:18,456
Sydney, it's fine. Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.

1859
01:40:18,526 --> 01:40:22,053
For the record, I like giving blowjobs.

1860
01:40:22,129 --> 01:40:25,155
Well, that's good to hear. You know,
I was just looking out for my buddy.

1861
01:40:25,232 --> 01:40:26,256
I hear you.

1862
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:28,734
I had to make sure that
he's getting blowies on a regular basis.

1863
01:40:28,803 --> 01:40:31,203
Yeah, I'm not really comfortable
with this conversation.

1864
01:40:31,272 --> 01:40:33,103
- Honey.
- We're all friends now.

1865
01:40:33,174 --> 01:40:35,005
- Friends do this.
- No, they don't.

1866
01:40:41,215 --> 01:40:43,115
- Wow, you have a nice singing voice.
- Thanks.

1867
01:40:43,184 --> 01:40:45,414
- Are you in a band?
- Not yet.

1868
01:40:45,519 --> 01:40:46,679
- Hailey.
- Lonnie.

1869
01:40:46,754 --> 01:40:48,051
- Hi.
- Hi.

1870
01:40:52,593 --> 01:40:54,891
That's awesome! That's awesome!

1871
01:40:55,129 --> 01:40:56,824
<i>Excuse me, Peter.</i>

1872
01:41:00,668 --> 01:41:02,829
<i>Get my wife on up here!</i>

1873
01:41:05,673 --> 01:41:07,641
<i>You've been Rushified!</i>

1874
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,847
- You should be...
- You've never called me an asshole?

1875
01:41:13,914 --> 01:41:15,541
No, I've said you act like an asshole.

1876
01:41:15,616 --> 01:41:17,584
So, you get away with it
because it was the act of.

1877
01:41:17,651 --> 01:41:18,777
- That's your behavior.
- Right.

1878
01:41:18,853 --> 01:41:20,821
I'm not saying you're an asshole.

1879
01:41:20,888 --> 01:41:21,912
Oh, my God.

1880
01:41:22,022 --> 01:41:24,115
Shit. What?
Do I have a fucking sign on me?

1881
01:41:24,191 --> 01:41:26,751
- No, it's not my fault.
- How is it not your fault?

1882
01:41:26,827 --> 01:41:28,692
Because I'm pregnant.

1883
01:41:30,197 --> 01:41:33,030
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1884
01:41:33,968 --> 01:41:36,732
- Are you still mad?
- Try to make it a boy.

1885
01:41:56,524 --> 01:41:58,856
<i>Thank you.
I'd just like to make a quick toast.</i>

1886
01:41:58,926 --> 01:41:59,984
<i>No!</i>
