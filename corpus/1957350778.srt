00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:54,859
Random.

192
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:56,695
Picked it out of a phone book.

193
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:58,729
Peter?

194
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:01,600
Peter, what?

195
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,637
I can ask outside.

196
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:11,709
Trevelyan.

197
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:15,679
- [laughing]
- Trevelyan?

198
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:16,614
Peter Trevelyan.

199
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,916
Where the hell did
you get that from?

200
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:19,883
Under T.

201
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:20,952
Peter Trevelyan?

202
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,987
Are you fucking serious?

203
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:27,524
Does that command respect?

204
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:28,526
Okay.

205
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:32,296
What about the photos you
took of me in your house?

206
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,464
I got rid of them.
I burned them all.

207
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:35,532
I've seen those
websites, those poor kids.

208
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:36,266
Never.

209
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,769
- 10, 11, 12.
- [Ray] Never.

210
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:38,469
On beds, sofas.

211
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:39,436
Those sick bastards.

212
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:40,937
I was never one of them.

213
00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:42,840
[knocking]

214
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:45,276
Everything all right, Pete?

215
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,177
Yeah, it's all good, mate.

216
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:50,715
Peter and I are just talking.

217
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:51,915
Leave you to it.

218
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,358
I was never one of them.

219
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,658
You know I wasn't.

220
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,327
- Do I?
- They all called me that.

221
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,494
The other prisoners. The guards.

222
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,330
I've been spat on.
I've been beaten up.

223
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:08,899
Had human shit put in my face.

224
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:09,701
You know!

225
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:11,301
I don't know anything
about you

226
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:13,971
except that you
abused me.

227
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:17,408
Didn't you?

228
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:20,712
- Didn't you?
- Yes, but.

229
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:21,912
There's no but.

230
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:24,581
I was never one of them.

231
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:30,253
You were my neighbour's
daughter, not a target.

232
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:32,957
[sombre music]

233
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,032
You were looking at me.

234
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:45,670
[ambient music]

235
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,111
I always used to wonder if I
hadn't argued with my friend,

236
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:56,580
it could have been
her you chose.

237
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:58,682
Could've all happened
to her, not me.

238
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:03,588
If you don't know
what you did,

239
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,122
then I'm not gonna tell you.

240
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:07,024
All right?

241
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:19,603
[people laughing]

242
00:23:23,107 --> 00:23:24,509
Where's Leah?

243
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:26,711
She went home.

244
00:23:31,014 --> 00:23:34,551
Una, I didn't choose you.

245
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,186
It's a beautiful day.

246
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:38,890
A smile wouldn't kill you.

247
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:43,160
Should we call the fire brigade?

248
00:23:43,194 --> 00:23:44,561
[giggling]

249
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:47,364
You'll be bored out
your mind here.

250
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:49,899
I've got boredom protection.

251
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:50,801
I want one.

252
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:52,669
Give me one.

253
00:23:53,303 --> 00:23:56,340
- Go on.
- [chuckling]

254
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:57,841
You'll get me in trouble.

255
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:01,378
How many people were
at that barbecue?

256
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:03,246
There were 10 or 15
people there, right?

257
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,282
Why?

258
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:07,817
Because I had shorts
on that day.

259
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,918
[Una giggling]

260
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:11,022
Yeah, they laughed about
this in court as well.

261
00:24:11,054 --> 00:24:11,788
You wore shorts?

262
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:13,457
In court that was your defence?

263
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:15,125
If I'd been aroused,

264
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:16,159
[laughing]

265
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:17,427
if I had an erection,

266
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:18,263
if I'd been turned...

267
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,263
Can you hear yourself?

268
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:22,100
I stood there next to you,

269
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:23,700
drinking my beer,
in those shorts.

270
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:26,571
I would've walked away.
I would've sat down.

271
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:32,443
A person knows if they're
aroused by children

272
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:36,214
because they're always
looking to be near them,

273
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:39,082
to lure them, deceive them.

274
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:42,954
The greater the risk,
the bigger the thrill.

275
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:44,522
You seem to know
a lot about it.

276
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:45,688
I had to talk
to psychologists.

277
00:24:45,722 --> 00:24:47,291
There are patterns of behaviour.

278
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:48,625
Cycles of abuse.

279
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:49,994
Were you abused as a child?

280
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:51,260
For God's sake.

281
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:52,528
No.

282
00:24:52,562 --> 00:24:55,131
This is the exact same
thing the lawyer asked me.

283
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,335
He claimed the courts
would be more lenient

284
00:24:57,368 --> 00:24:59,003
if I had been abused.

285
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:00,036
But I haven't.

286
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:01,205
I'm not one of them.

287
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:03,240
[door clicking]

288
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:05,142
[Woman] Mark is
waiting for you.

289
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:07,911
I've got a meeting.
I have to go.

290
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:08,812
It's important.

291
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:09,613
Go.

292
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:11,115
Why don't you
wait in your car?

293
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:11,982
[Woman] Peter!

294
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:12,883
Okay!

295
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:20,058
[door slamming]

296
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,827
[ominous music]

297
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:02,634
[wind blowing]

298
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:18,181
[ocean waves rolling]

299
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:24,054
[ominous music]

300
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:33,196
You know this is
a big deal, yes?

301
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:37,734
Just don't fuck it up, okay?

302
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,837
We want you moving ahead
into the future with us.

303
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,738
Yeah?

304
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,208
Okay?

305
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:47,744
Peter, you okay?

306
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:51,014
Good.

307
00:26:52,116 --> 00:26:53,718
Okay, let's get in there.

308
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,058
What're you doing here?

309
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:05,964
You're a good swimmer.

310
00:27:08,698 --> 00:27:10,033
You wanna race?

311
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,270
[chuckling]

312
00:27:12,302 --> 00:27:13,604
You'll beat me.

313
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:23,715
[water bubbling]

314
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:29,253
[ominous music]

315
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:42,933
[water trickling]

316
00:27:42,966 --> 00:27:46,436
What are you doing
this weekend?

317
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:48,405
Nothing much, really.

318
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:54,343
Who was that guy?

319
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:55,913
Yeah, who was he?

320
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:58,515
Just someone I know.

321
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:59,850
Where did you meet him?

322
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:01,351
Around.

323
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:03,320
[Girls] Tell us.

324
00:28:03,353 --> 00:28:04,888
Come on.

325
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,256
He's the neighbour.

326
00:28:07,257 --> 00:28:08,325
Friend of my dad's.

327
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,898
Let's go.

328
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:31,082
[garage door buzzing]

329
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:37,321
[ambient music]

330
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,221
Want a cup of tea?

331
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,456
No, thank you.

332
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,558
Coffee?

333
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,459
No.

334
00:29:19,163 --> 00:29:21,631
We got champagne,
ice cream, caviar.

335
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:22,899
[laughing]

336
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:26,170
[dramatic music]

337
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:41,918
Thank you.

338
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,760
Listen, why don't we go
through to the meeting?

339
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:51,928
Or at least to reception.

340
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:53,965
You shouldn't be here alone.

341
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:55,799
I'm waiting for Peter.

342
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:59,170
[sombre music]

343
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:22,026
[Prosecutor] State your full
name to the court, please.

344
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:27,063
Ray?

345
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,101
Where did you go?

346
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:33,903
What happened?

347
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:35,305
Why did you leave me?

348
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:38,876
[courtroom commotion]

349
00:30:38,908 --> 00:30:40,911
Ray, can you hear me?

350
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:46,984
I love you.

351
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,488
[people gasping]

352
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:53,023
[courtroom commotion]

353
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:54,524
That does mean we'll need

354
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,028
to consolidate
several positions.

355
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:59,396
[meeting room commotion]

356
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:03,367
Here at Ethgon, we believe in
investing not just in ideas

357
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,035
but in people.

358
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:13,511
[banging]

359
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:47,343
I'll pass you over to Peter now.

360
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:48,245
Thank you.

361
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:56,586
Yeah.

362
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:00,557
Right, okay.

363
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,560
So it's like Jen said.

364
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:05,662
We're gonna be moving to

365
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:08,165
working more with north-west

366
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:12,502
and consolidating our
futures together.

367
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:13,536
New beginning.

368
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:15,673
[audience commotion]

369
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:18,442
[ominous music]

370
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:29,286
I can't do this.

371
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:32,956
Look, they want me to...

372
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:35,826
give you 6 names.

373
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,595
They want 6 names of people.

374
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:39,297
- Peter.
- Excuse me.

375
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,397
I'm doing this.

376
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:41,264
Daryl.

377
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:42,465
Mate, I'm sorry.

378
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:45,668
[meeting room commotion]

379
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:48,439
[people yelling]

380
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,248
Peter!

381
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,220
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

382
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:04,120
Peter!

383
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:09,526
Peter!

384
00:33:12,728 --> 00:33:14,398
He's fucking dead.

385
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,133
[ominous music]

386
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,415
Peter!

387
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:43,360
Scott.

388
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:48,264
What the fuck is up with Peter?

389
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:51,435
Nothing.

390
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,205
Hey.

391
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:56,740
You think he's your friend?

392
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:00,143
You're on his list.

393
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:03,013
Yeah.

394
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:07,385
You should empty
out your locker.

395
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:29,473
Get up.

396
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,109
How long have you
been married?

397
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:35,813
I don't have time for this.
Let's go.

398
00:34:38,714 --> 00:34:39,649
Four years.

399
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,253
Do you have children?

400
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:46,589
No.

401
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:50,594
That poor woman. No
idea who she's married to.

402
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:51,462
No idea what you did...

403
00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:52,496
She knows.

404
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:55,066
She knows?

405
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:59,136
I have to go.

406
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:04,442
How does she know?

407
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:09,112
How does she know?

408
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,680
Because I told her.

409
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:11,547
She was fine with it?

410
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:12,715
Of course not,

411
00:35:12,748 --> 00:35:14,216
but I told her what my
life was like then.

412
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,218
What was your life like then?

413
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:16,319
I had problems.

414
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:17,621
Did you? Did you really?

415
00:35:17,654 --> 00:35:18,822
What kind of problems?

416
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:21,058
I made the biggest,
most stupid, mistake

417
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,426
of my entire life.

418
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,128
Did you tell her it was
a 3 month stupid mistake?

419
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:26,362
That you ran away with me?

420
00:35:26,395 --> 00:35:28,998
I told her everything
because she loves me.

421
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:30,132
Well what's wrong with her?

422
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:31,134
There must be something
wrong with her.

423
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:32,302
Don't talk about
her like that.

424
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:34,571
Why not? What the fuck's
wrong with her?

425
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:37,273
Pete!

426
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:38,809
[door slamming]

427
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:41,578
This is my life.

428
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:43,647
I had to fight for this.

429
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,281
I lost everything.

430
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:48,384
Did you ever think about me?

431
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:50,787
What was happening to me?

432
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,889
You got out after four years.

433
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:55,058
I've been living this
for 15 years!

434
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,125
Every fucking day!

435
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,127
We never moved from that house.

436
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:00,898
I was talked about,
pointed at, stared at.

437
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:03,601
I was attacked by
your girlfriend.

438
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:06,570
I lost my life.

439
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:10,840
The only thing I didn't
lose was my name.

440
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:11,774
[Scott] Pete!

441
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:14,110
I had to keep my name.

442
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:16,412
[ominous music]

443
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:17,313
Peter!

444
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:20,583
Peter!

445
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:22,819
Pete!

446
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,205
[door clicking]

447
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:53,783
She attacked you?

448
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:58,322
A couple of years later,
I was shopping with my mum.

449
00:36:58,355 --> 00:36:59,757
She slapped me.

450
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:02,192
Pushed me to the ground.

451
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:09,298
She used to say

452
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:11,969
that you glared at her.

453
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:16,440
That you were after me.

454
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,248
You used to hang
around on the street,

455
00:37:26,116 --> 00:37:27,016
near the car.

456
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:28,185
Write notes.

457
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:30,520
You'd put them under
the windshield wiper.

458
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:35,492
"Your girlfriend's ugly."

459
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:37,627
"Your girlfriend's
got a glass eye."

460
00:37:37,661 --> 00:37:38,762
[laughing]

461
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:48,404
I was a shameless stupid
girl with a stupid crush.

462
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:49,873
You weren't stupid.

463
00:37:49,906 --> 00:37:50,840
I was.

464
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:52,042
No.

465
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:53,243
You weren't.

466
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:58,482
You don't remember
what you were like.

467
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:01,418
What was I like?

468
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,256
You were headstrong.

469
00:38:08,357 --> 00:38:09,493
Determined.

470
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:14,398
Wise beyond your years.

471
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:15,866
- No.
- Yes.

472
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:18,269
Yes.

473
00:38:19,802 --> 00:38:21,605
You were so impatient,

474
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:23,973
sick of being treated
like a child.

475
00:38:25,475 --> 00:38:27,677
That's what children say.

476
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:35,985
What could I have possibly
given you that wasn't my body?

477
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:37,319
What else could you have wanted?

478
00:38:37,353 --> 00:38:39,022
There was nothing else.

479
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:40,056
There was.

480
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:43,060
For me there was.

481
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,846
Do you remember the codes?

482
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,415
[phone dialling]

483
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:08,552
I used to ring your
parents' house, one ring.

484
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,424
Meant she'd gone out
and you were on your own.

485
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:15,926
Car parked facing right,

486
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,027
"meet me in the park."

487
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,797
[ominous music]

488
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:28,471
I could've stopped.

489
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,476
I should've stopped.

490
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:34,177
But you didn't.

491
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,946
[ominous music]

492
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:54,831
Whatever it was,
whatever I was thinking,

493
00:39:58,368 --> 00:40:00,136
made me believe

494
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:05,476
I loved you.

495
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:45,047
Crawling in to those trees.

496
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:55,458
And pulling up my top
and touching my breasts.

497
00:40:57,194 --> 00:41:01,431
And unzipping your trousers
and taking out your prick.

498
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:04,667
Telling me to hold it.

499
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:10,072
Then on the blanket
you brought...

500
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:13,610
I thought it was to
make us comfortable

501
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:16,880
but realised afterwards
it wasn't, was it?

502
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:20,784
It was so that twigs and earth
wouldn't stick to my clothes

503
00:41:20,817 --> 00:41:22,886
so that no one would suspect.

504
00:41:23,886 --> 00:41:26,756
[leaves rustling]

505
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:39,735
I didn't want us
to get caught.

506
00:41:39,768 --> 00:41:42,171
Every waking moment
was about how

507
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:45,107
I could get to be closer to you.

508
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:46,243
How I could talk to you.

509
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:48,110
I was so obsessed with you.

510
00:41:49,411 --> 00:41:50,947
I used to leave work early.

511
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,249
I'd come home,
I'd work on my car.

512
00:41:53,282 --> 00:41:55,551
My car didn't need work.

513
00:41:55,585 --> 00:41:58,021
I'd do it just so I
could be near you.

514
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,532
You remember.

515
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,976
We both knew the risks.

516
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:43,065
Any of you seen Peter?

517
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:48,571
[ambient music]

518
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:21,138
[sombre music]

519
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:55,938
[door closing]

520
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:11,087
Una.

521
00:44:18,393 --> 00:44:20,229
There were twin beds.

522
00:44:20,263 --> 00:44:21,130
Don't.

523
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:24,534
Why not?

524
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:25,635
We both know what happened.

525
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:27,003
We were both there.

526
00:44:31,674 --> 00:44:33,076
We undressed.

527
00:44:34,677 --> 00:44:36,312
We had sex on one of the beds.

528
00:44:36,346 --> 00:44:38,849
I'm not sure how long for.

529
00:44:40,148 --> 00:44:41,784
I saw how much
pleasure it gave you.

530
00:44:41,817 --> 00:44:43,920
I liked that I could do that.

531
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:48,825
We did it twice. Fucked.

532
00:44:49,993 --> 00:44:50,793
Twice.

533
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:53,029
You turned me around
the second time.

534
00:44:54,663 --> 00:44:56,732
We made so much noise.

535
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:05,975
We lay in each other's arms
afterwards and I cried a bit.

536
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:07,676
My parents would be
looking for me.

537
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,679
They'd be phoning my friends.

538
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:12,581
I don't even know if I came.

539
00:45:12,614 --> 00:45:13,750
Did I come?

540
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,085
I thought you did.

541
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:19,255
[water running]

542
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:24,127
How could you tell?

543
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:25,261
Did I make a noise?

544
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:26,430
What did I do?

545
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:35,404
Your eyes were closed.
Your face was flushed.

546
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:56,292
You said you
wanted cigarettes.

547
00:45:56,326 --> 00:45:58,862
You were going to look
for a shop, a pub.

548
00:45:58,895 --> 00:46:00,696
I wanted to go with
you but you said no,

549
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,165
I was to wait there.

550
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:07,003
Then you touched me and
kissed me between my legs.

551
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,275
You'd be back in five minutes.

552
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:16,745
I fell asleep and when I woke up

553
00:46:16,779 --> 00:46:18,482
I didn't know what time it was

554
00:46:21,016 --> 00:46:24,520
I was sore between my
legs but I felt wonderful.

555
00:46:26,322 --> 00:46:27,524
I was so happy.

556
00:46:30,092 --> 00:46:33,797
And you'd be back soon and
you'd have chocolate for me.

557
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,898
I didn't even have to
tell you what I wanted.

558
00:46:35,931 --> 00:46:39,034
You'd know what I wanted
and you'd bring it to me.

559
00:46:40,603 --> 00:46:43,340
[ominous music]

560
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:48,145
[muffled conversation]

561
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:52,414
I waited for you in that

This room's private.

567
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,281
[Una Voiceover] I looked
for you in the town.

Everywhere.

569
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,284
But I couldn't find you.

570
00:47:29,317 --> 00:47:30,486
Did a man come in
here for cigarettes?

571
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,654
[Woman] What?

572
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:33,022
About an hour ago,
a man for cigarettes?

573

be in here.

00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:56,311
I'm looking for my dad.

What's his name?

578
00:47:57,712 --> 00:47:58,813
Ray.

[Una Voiceover] I felt
sick. I wanted to die.

I was never going
to see you again.

I didn't say anything
to anyone.

590
00:49:28,103 --> 00:49:29,105
I didn't say a word.

591
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:30,639
I told them you hadn't
touched me.

592

When I wouldn't say, they
told me what you'd done to me.

598
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:05,840
They drugged me and
held me down,

opened my legs and
took out your come.

600
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:13,616
They said you were
only after one thing

and when you got
what you wanted,

602
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,685
that's why you disappeared.

I just needed to clear my head.

627
00:52:40,395 --> 00:52:43,465
So I went for a walk
around the streets

628
00:52:43,498 --> 00:52:44,366
and then...

629
00:52:44,967 --> 00:52:46,735

I thought maybe you were hiding.

But nothing.

Why would you go?

I didn't know what the
fuck was going on.

It didn't make any
fucking sense.

641
00:53:27,076 --> 00:53:29,045
And then I thought maybe
someone had got you,

642
00:53:29,078 --> 00:53:30,513
that you were being hurt.

643
00:53:30,545 --> 00:53:33,049
That I hadn't protected you.

in here for, then?

she was going?

because he said it might
sound better in court,

660

myself so I ran away.

there's no difference.

Yes there is.

You don't think she
should be told?

691

I don't think we
should talk about it.

939
01:19:16,257 --> 01:19:17,491
You just got here.

940
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:18,660
I know, I just, just
got a text. We've gotta...

941
01:19:18,692 --> 01:19:19,927
No, I'm talking to Yvonne.

942
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:21,929
Sweetheart,
we've gotta get back.

943
01:19:22,864 --> 01:19:24,732
Love, don't do this to me,
we gotta go.

944
01:19:25,732 --> 01:19:26,801
No.

945
01:19:29,969 --> 01:19:32,206
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

We could be stuck
up here forever.

I love you.

953
01:22:07,861 --> 01:22:09,463
What you doing in my room?

954
01:22:17,237 --> 01:22:19,507
I'm a friend of Peter's.

955
01:22:19,539 --> 01:22:20,540
From work?

956
01:22:21,508 --> 01:22:22,409
No.

957
01:22:24,645 --> 01:22:26,380
Do you know my mum?

958
01:22:26,414 --> 01:22:27,581
Not really, no.

959
01:22:29,917 --> 01:22:31,084
What's your name?

960
01:22:36,723 --> 01:22:37,557
Una.

01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:42,163
[ominous music]

962
01:22:53,507 --> 01:22:55,476
What's wrong, love?

963
01:22:55,508 --> 01:22:56,409
Una!

964
01:22:56,444 --> 01:22:57,343
Una

965
01:22:57,378 --> 01:22:58,012
Una!

966
01:22:58,512 --> 01:23:01,348
[ominous music]

967
01:23:01,382 --> 01:23:02,250
Hey.

968
01:23:18,331 --> 01:23:19,066
Never.

969
01:23:19,098 --> 01:23:20,467
I would never do that.

970
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:22,402
Please don't.

971
01:23:22,436 --> 01:23:23,437
No, please.

972
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:24,172
Una.

973
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,173
I look after her.

974
01:23:26,907 --> 01:23:28,308
I take care of her.

975
01:23:30,843 --> 01:23:33,181
You've got to believe me.

976
01:23:33,213 --> 01:23:37,484
I have never desired
anyone that age.

977
01:23:38,785 --> 01:23:39,654
Again.

978
01:23:44,025 --> 01:23:45,259
I promise.

979
01:23:58,038 --> 01:24:00,107
You were the only one.
