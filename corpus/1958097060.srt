1
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:54,489
Remember me.

2
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,773
I live within you

3
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:04,352
in absolute stillness

4
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:06,701
waiting.

5
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:12,616
Have you forgotten?

6
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,655
Have you placed me
outside of yourself?

7
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,328
Far beyond your reach?

8
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:26,873
I am here

9
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,339
within you.

10
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:35,940
Close as breath.

11
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:44,439
I always have been.

12
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,106
I always will be.

13
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,106
Find me.

14
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:14,172
You are me.

15
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:06,373
We have descended from realms

16
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:09,940
beyond our human memory.

17
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:32,139
Our birthright is to return.

18
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:40,139
The truth of who we are

19
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:43,606
lives deep within us

20
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:51,106
In absolute stillness

21
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,573
waiting for us to respond

22
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:02,907
to the calling
of a deeper memory.

23
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,373
The journey of awakening

24
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,439
to our own eternal adventure

25
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:55,840
begins

26
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,439
with the Birth

27
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,172
of Innocence.

28
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:56,439
There is only life

29
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,007
and life is forever.

30
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:12,172
An ever expanding,
dynamic continuum

31
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:16,907
always in a state of change.

32
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:28,239
Life is a force

33
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,273
imbued with love.

34
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:47,873
Its natural momentum is joy.

35
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:59,072
Moving through everything

36
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:02,640
everyone

37
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,206
everywhere

38
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:19,039
in both seen and unseen aspects

39
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:21,973
of all creation.

40
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,506
Nature moves in rhythm
with this force.

41
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,940
Alive with power.

42
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:39,273
Alive with change.

43
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:53,139
Alive in stillness.

44
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,540
Nature's power
is in its stillness.

45
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:58,139
Our power
is in our stillness.

46
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:14,673
In our stillness

47
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:16,640
we dream.

48
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:25,907
We form a vision of our desire.

49
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,273
We enact our will through focus.

50
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:54,007
Our own creative power

51
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:58,573
infusing our dream with life.

52
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,640
Nature reminds us

53
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,806
to create our dream

54
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,540
with passion and purpose.

55
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:33,940
To give ourselves
wholeheartedly

56
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:55,373
until our experience
of our dream

57
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,406
becomes our life.

58
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:37,239
We are free to change.

59
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:45,373
Free to experience
new unknowns

60
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,273
new dreams

61
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,306
new life.

62
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,106
Sowing our dreams like seeds,

63
00:18:08,273 --> 00:18:11,007
we gain experience.

64
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:17,673
We harvest wisdom.

65
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,706
Moving in rhythm
with our own life force

66
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:41,239
we experience the potency
of cycles.

67
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:52,239
We experience our own joy.

68
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:09,106
When trusting our nature

69
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:11,139
to dream

70
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,406
to experience

71
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,573
to gain wisdom and move on

72
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:33,106
we are in harmony with life.

73
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:05,406
Our love for life grows greater

74
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,206
and greater

75
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:26,540
inspiring us
to become one with life.

76
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:36,439
To dream bold
and outrageous dreams.

77
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,573
We dissolve everything we are

78
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:46,806
everything we have known.

79
00:21:57,273 --> 00:22:01,506
A death without dying.

80
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:45,106
A birth into a whole new being.

81
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,106
A genetic leap

82
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:04,640
into the vast unknown.

83
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:40,007
In choosing to make this dream

84
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:42,172
our reality

85
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:45,306
we ride the mystery

86
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:49,106
of our own deep stillness.

87
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:29,573
There is only life

88
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:41,106
and life is forever.

89
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:06,406
Our gateway to forever

90
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,439
lives deep within us

91
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,106
in absolute stillness

92
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:26,940
waiting.

93
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:53,673
Have we forgotten?

94
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:13,106
You do?

95
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,540
<i>No, I don't, but she wanted</i>
<i>the tomatoes, so I was very</i>

96
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:16,706
<i>nice to trade</i>

97
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:18,640
-Oh, alright--
<i>-Thank you</i>

98
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,439
<i>'Cause I'm not doing</i>
<i>any of it.</i>

99
00:26:20,573 --> 00:26:21,840
<i>-You were nice--</i>
-You're not?-

100
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:23,206
<i>No.</i>

101
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:24,339
Lord of the Rings is so bad.

102
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:25,473
<i>No it's not!</i>

103
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:26,740
<i>It is! It's so bad!</i>

104
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:27,840
<i>I've never seen it.</i>

105
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:29,773
<i>You have to see it!</i>

106
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:32,406
Okay, the only thing I got
an A+ in was culinary arts.

107
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,106
You're gonna love it!
You're gonna love it!

108
00:27:12,306 --> 00:27:16,306
For as long as I can remember

109
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:21,273
we have allowed ourselves
to be planted in rows.

110
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:36,239
For as long as I can remember

111
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:45,640
we have allowed ourselves
to be buried in rows.

112
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,439
Have we forgotten how to live?

113
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:21,740
As our memory fades,

114
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:27,439
our deepest dreams
can become buried within us.

115
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,907
We begin looking
outside of ourself

116
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:39,940
for life

117
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:44,907
for inspiration

118
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:50,907
for love.

119
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:17,373
What was dreamed to be
a life of exploration

120
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:26,007
becomes a life of repetition.

121
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:38,172
We learn to comply

122
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,873
while we wonder

123
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:52,973
mostly in secret

124
00:29:58,106 --> 00:30:01,640
what happened to our joy?

125
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:27,239
Greater realities surround us

126
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:30,940
but we can't see them.

127
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:41,706
We can't feel them.

128
00:30:45,907 --> 00:30:49,573
We become closed to them.

129
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:57,106
We stop listening.

130
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:11,273
We grow arrogant
in our forgetfulness

131
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,606
insisting we know how to live.

132
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:27,907
Insisting that
what we know

133
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:33,473
is all there is to know.

134
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,640
Without great dreams

135
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:56,139
we cannot change.

136
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:04,439
Without change

137
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,339
we are out of rhythm
with our life.

138
00:32:17,573 --> 00:32:21,139
At odds with our nature,

139
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,673
we grow tired and resentful.

140
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:31,840
Cut off from our innocence,

141
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:35,873
our inner life
becomes hardship,

142
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:41,706
and our outer life confirms it.

143
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:55,439
We develop a constant need
to be built up

144
00:32:57,106 --> 00:32:59,106
to be stimulated.

145
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,139
I love you!

146
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:03,940
Thank you!

147
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:05,506
You're perfect!

148
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,973
To feed the many appetites

149
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:17,973
that make us feel alive.

150
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:31,306
But the rush of emotions
dies in a moment,

151
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:35,339
and then we just need more.

152
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:46,706
Our human life

153
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,473
becomes our life

154
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:54,106
without thought
of the greater life

155
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:58,740
that even now sustains us.

156
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,840
We may remember exactly

157
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:51,306
when we gave up
on our innocence.

158
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:57,540
When the world around us
overwhelmed our trust

159
00:35:00,873 --> 00:35:04,439
that who we are is enough.

160
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,506
Seeding doubt

161
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,106
that our dream must not be real.

162
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:28,406
But where can we go

163
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,940
without that dream to guide us?

164
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,840
We try to find some way
to orient ourselves.

165
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:00,873
But no matter where we search

166
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,673
no matter what we do

167
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:19,439
we feel a deeper longing
that is rarely answered

168
00:36:21,373 --> 00:36:26,206
that nothing outside us
can answer.

169
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:54,273
When do we go back in to listen?

170
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:09,339
When do we become still enough

171
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:13,273
to hear our own calling?

172
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:26,106
We can become so lost

173
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:31,007
that we forget
even what we have lost.

174
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:44,640
Our innocence
seems like another being

175
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:49,473
a childish fantasy

176
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:54,106
impossible to find.

177
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:16,506
To remember our dream

178
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,506
we may have to walk
back through a past

179
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,640
we have tried very hard to bury.

180
00:38:54,673 --> 00:38:58,339
Separated from our own source

181
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:01,172
from our own love

182
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,840
we wither and die

183
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,306
while life waits

184
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:12,640
right inside us.

185
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:19,106
It can take a great pain
to wake us up

186
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:30,106
a death to what we thought
our life was all about.

187
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,940
In that emptiness

188
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:46,773
through that crack

189
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:55,740
from a darkness
we tried everything to avoid

190
00:41:58,473 --> 00:42:03,506
our deeper memory
begins to stir.

191
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,206
I am always close.

192
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,106
Always waiting.

193
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:38,973
Always offering another chance

194
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:43,172
no matter what you have done

195
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:45,873
with every other chance.

196
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:53,806
I will not leave you

197
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:58,406
because

198
00:43:00,573 --> 00:43:03,239
I am you.

199
00:43:23,806 --> 00:43:25,573
This deeper memory

200
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:26,773
takes root

201
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:29,306
and begins to grow.

202
00:44:06,473 --> 00:44:08,740
The more it grows

203
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:12,506
the more I trust it's power.

204
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,439
Quietly I realize

205
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,239
this power is me.

206
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:56,239
Reminders are everywhere

207
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:02,873
that there is so much
more to life

208
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:05,706
than what I have been living!

209
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:19,239
And now this unknown
is all I want to know.

210
00:45:23,406 --> 00:45:27,273
This new life growing within me

211
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:30,873
is all I want to tend to.

212
00:45:45,673 --> 00:45:49,172
We have given ourselves
this opportunity

213
00:45:49,306 --> 00:45:53,740
to bring forth
everything we are

214
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,907
to love everything we are

215
00:46:25,106 --> 00:46:26,840
to transform ourselves

216
00:46:26,973 --> 00:46:30,007
into greater and greater

217
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:33,206
expressions of life.

218
00:47:00,873 --> 00:47:04,840
We don't know how to do this.

219
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:16,206
Our Innocence does.

220
00:47:24,773 --> 00:47:27,840
We don't believe it is possible.

221
00:47:34,306 --> 00:47:38,506
Our Innocence knows it is.

222
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:21,973
We have that seed

223
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:24,106
within us

224
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,706
reaching up for light

225
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:35,573
down for rich soil

226
00:48:35,873 --> 00:48:38,139
to create itself

227
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:46,106
to make it's dream known.

228
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,740
Look at our bodies:

229
00:49:26,973 --> 00:49:30,640
Every finger matters in our grip

230
00:49:30,773 --> 00:49:33,206
and in our touch.

231
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,139
Every cell has a purpose.

232
00:49:41,172 --> 00:49:43,439
Every fluid carries something

233
00:49:43,573 --> 00:49:46,806
we cannot live without.

234
00:49:47,606 --> 00:49:50,506
Every organ beats or hums

235
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,106
in infinite complexity

236
00:49:55,373 --> 00:49:59,206
giving us the
staggering opportunity

237
00:49:59,473 --> 00:50:00,873
of life.

238
00:50:13,072 --> 00:50:16,239
We are born remembering.

239
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,373
And this memory

240
00:50:27,506 --> 00:50:31,573
is always with us.

241
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:54,806
In this Innocence

242
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,473
we embrace life

243
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,673
actively seeking out experiences

244
00:51:08,806 --> 00:51:13,106
and living them richly
into wisdom.

245
00:51:33,473 --> 00:51:38,773
Each bold step
makes the next step bolder.

246
00:52:27,907 --> 00:52:31,106
Every adventure into the unknown

247
00:52:31,172 --> 00:52:34,540
creates more trust

248
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:37,873
for grander adventures.

249
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:25,873
I am the creator of my life

250
00:54:32,306 --> 00:54:35,773
through the power
of my own thought.

251
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:48,706
Through the potency
of my own dreams

252
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:55,406
my life takes shape and form.

253
00:55:12,106 --> 00:55:15,573
I have created what my life is.

254
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,806
I am now creating
what it will become.

255
00:59:44,473 --> 00:59:46,206
Our own

256
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:56,339
endless

257
01:00:02,706 --> 01:00:06,373
ever-evolving creation

258
01:00:40,339 --> 01:00:44,840
into the vast unknown.

259
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:10,373
The eternal womb of space

260
01:03:17,373 --> 01:03:19,172
waiting

261
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:31,273
for new dreams
to be conceived

262
01:03:49,907 --> 01:03:53,706
for new life to be created

263
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:13,106
for new realms
to be experienced.

264
01:04:49,206 --> 01:04:52,907
Patiently waiting.

265
01:05:05,007 --> 01:05:06,806
Waiting

266
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,106
for you

267
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,673
to remember.

268
01:06:27,106 --> 01:06:28,873
