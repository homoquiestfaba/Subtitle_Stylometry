00:01:55,865 --> 00:02:00,063
Hello, I'm Dot Lancaster,
film valedictorian of Hollywood.

2
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:02,570
The movie you are
about to see is not real.

3
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,731
It is a movie.

4
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,867
Do not act things out from it
because you are disturbed

5
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:09,571
or pissed off,
you crazy son of a bitch.

6
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:12,080
This film contains adult language.

7
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:15,584
There are 17 swearwords
carefully placed throughout.

8
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,586
Kids, can you find them?

9
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,088
When you hear one,
jump up and turn around.

10
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,748
That'd crack me up.

11
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:23,258
Enjoy the film.

12
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:47,108
Hey. There.

13
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:50,175
and this here is the story
of Ronnie Dobbs

14
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:55,281
and his rise to fame. And the man
that discovered him. And me.

15
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:59,021
But let's stat with o" Ronnie.
Here he is now.

16
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:14,242
Yeah. Ronnie was a good man.

17
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,473
a true getleman
of Souther distiction.

18
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:21,381
Dobbs, get your ass off my car!

19
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,648
Sorry, man.
Thought it was mine.

20
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,106
Get out of the way, dumb ass!

21
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:02,891
- Hey, Darryl.
- Ronnie, what's up?

22
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,052
Nothin' much.
Talmadge. Debbie.

23
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,062
- B.J., how you doing?
- I'm fine.

24
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,564
- Stan.
- I don't want nothin' to do with you.

25
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:12,726
Damn, look at this.
He's still pissed off about last time.

26
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,360

28
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,801
- Hey, Harmon.

29
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,713
I'm sorry about doing that
to your sister, man. I forgot.

30
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,590
Roie sure was
a free spirit. Was't he?

31
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,592
Do't you thik?

32
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,426
But freedom
is the devi"s hadshake.

33
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,931
because while his brai
was free...

34
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,262
Look who's back.

35
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,927
Leland. Darnell.

36
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:50,666
Y'all don't say nothin'.
Today's gonna be a special day.

37
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:54,776
...his heat beloged

Go ahead and ask me, then.

45
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,492
That's what you think.

46
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,726
It's personal and romanticized,

47
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,295

75
00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:00,869

00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:11,378
Now, I swear,
if I didn't know any better,

80
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:15,110
I'd say that I was
about to ask Tammy to marry me.

81
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:18,620

You hear me talking to you, boy?

120
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,975
Why don't you bunch of losers try
to find something useful to do...

121
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,211
...like killing yourselves.

122
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,556
You just lost my vote. That's it.
You done did it this time.

123
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,152
Smart campaigning.

124
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:42,891

00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,134

00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:54,803
What, all of 'em?

129
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:58,904
You was gone a long while there,

130
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,915
like you should, you know...

131
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,076

132
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:06,679
Come on, man, this is your last few
hours of bachelorhood-ness.

133
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,485
You gotta make the most of 'em.

134
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,754
Kyle's right, Ronnie.

135
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:13,260

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,089
Come on!

139
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,636
Roie came up
with the greatest plas.

140
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,435
but somehow they all
eded up the same way.

141
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:28,170
- A child shall lead them!
- I want y'all to fuck it up!

142
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,115
We've got a disturbance call,
possible break-in.

143
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,446
Get these all the time.
It's routine.

144
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:36,780
Could be anything.

145
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:38,945
- You keep an eye out.
- Right.

146
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,114
Ronnie's in it.
Ronnie Dobbs.

147
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,626
Well, look here.
It's his old pal Clay.

148
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:47,128
I'm gonna go looking

149
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,220
Hey, Clay.

150
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:50,288
We're gonna need
a paramedic up here.

151
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,630
- You all right, son?
- I'm good.

152
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,761
You don't look so good.

153
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:58,637
I'll be all right
when we get to pass-out time.

154
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:02,133
- Ronnie!
- Hey, Darnetta.

155
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:04,236
I heard the noise.

156
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,406
He went thataway,
toward that house there.

157
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:07,574

158
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,619
That way. I heard him.
I seed him. One man, yonder.

159
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:14,247
I gots a condition,
and I didn't get to take my pills.

160
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:17,019
I know. You go back inside
and take your pills.

161
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,084
My husband Donnie's
supposed to bring the pills.

162
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:21,595
He's supposed to bring 'em.
He's supposed to.

163
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:24,455
- There he goes!
- Yeah!

164
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:27,093
Dispatch, we've got
a 10-80 on foot.

165
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,933
Ronnie, let's don't do this again!

166
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,097
Fuck!

167
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,006
Watch out for this dog!

168
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,602
Come on, Ronnie,
let's make this easy!

169
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:39,938
Hey, Travis.

170
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:42,946
Hell, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

171
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,850
He's fixing to go out!

172
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,459
Dobbs! Come on!

173
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:57,328
I'm slippery, ain't I?

174
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,561
Damn it, Ronnie!
Come on back here!

175
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,068
Oh, God.

176
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,628
- Just chasing somebody, ma'am.
- Excuse us, ma'am.

177
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,302
Come on, now, Ronnie!

178
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,236
Ronnie, come on back here!

179
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,405
Cameraman!
Want to know a secret?

180
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,245
- Here he is!
- He's back in here!

181
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:19,087
- Ronnie, get over here!
- Hold it right there!

182
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,589
Bill. He just ra
o dow to Daretta's.

183
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,091
h'll go dow to the ed of the street
ad cut him off.

184
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,422
Here they come.

185
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,485
Praise the Lord!
I hope they catch him!

186
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,599
Ronnie, where are you?

187
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,265
Damn it, now where
did you go hidin' at?

188
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,276
Dobbs, we gonna get you
the next time, boy!

189
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,938
We gonna get you
and bring you in!

190
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,608
Hey, officers.
I was takin' a nap.

191
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,049
- Roll over, Ronnie.
- Damn it, Ronnie!

192
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,108
Roll over!

193
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,951
I was sleeping! What?
I was just sleeping!

194
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,651
I was in my home,
my new home!

195
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,716
What did I do?
I didn't do nothing!

196
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:02,389
- You're going downtown.
- You going downtown!

197
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:05,127
- You done...
- Police brutality!

198
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,931
Y'all are brutalizing me!

199
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:10,767
h do't kow
what bothered that sheriff more...

200
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,401

Y'all is brutalizing me!

203
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,917
Get the hell away from me!

204
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:30,288
- Sit back. Ronnie!
- You sit back. Ronnie.

205
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,792
Did he spit o your camera?

206
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:34,159
Come on. Man,

207
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:39,464
I want my rights!
I want a lobster dinner!

208
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:42,333
I want my free phone call to Paris!

209
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,771
Keep it down, Dobbs.
You got a visitor.

210
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:49,242
- Tammy, do you want your chair?
- No. It's okay, Joey.

211
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:53,804
Hey, baby.
You look very good today.

212
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:56,818
Ronnie Dobbs, I waited
all night at Jumbo Jimbo's.

213
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:59,855
- I was gonna...
- I guess you're right, though.

214
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,686
"Meet me at our special place."
I should have come here.

215
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,727
Baby, hang on.
Don't flip your bitch switch.

216
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:10,060
I got a personalized,
romanticized question to ask you,

217
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,827
so pay my fine.

218
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:13,562
Not this time.

219
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:16,127
You're gonna want
the right to change your mind

220
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:19,732
when I ask the most majestic
of all questions.

221
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,742
Tammy Dupris...

222
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:28,975
...on this veritable occasion,
will you marry me?

223
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,350
No.

224
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,582
Baby, that's great.
This one's...

225
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:37,618
What?

226
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:40,161
No. The answer is no.

227
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:43,960
Tammy, I just asked you
to marry me.

228
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,057
No!

229
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,864
I did. You need to clean
the shit out your ears.

230
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:52,533
I heard what you said, but I ain't
gonna marry you until you change.

231
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,371
Change?
What you talkin' about?

232
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:56,274
I'm tired of all this!

233
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:59,872
I'm tired of bailing you out of jail,
making excuses to the little Ronnies

234
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,713
when they say,
"Why ain't Daddy at my birthday?"

235
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:07,313
He's too busy peeing in a water tower
or stealing a ice cream truck, naked.

236
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,051
First of all, okay,
I already explained.

237
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,355
That ice cream truck
was for the kids, okay?

238
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,487
That was part of
a civic community service.

239
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:17,464
Second of all,
that water tower was asking for it.

240
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,524
You can ask anybody!

241
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:21,570
Listen to me.

242
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:24,197
Everyone has some kind of talent.

243
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:28,733
You just gotta find out what yours is
and make something of yourself.

244
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:32,577
Until you do,
the answer is no.

245
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,480
Tammy, come on!

246
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:40,421
Yep. Roie was hittig
ew lows left ad right.

247
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:44,425
but little did he kow.
thousads of miles away

248
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,326
there was a city called Hollywood.

249
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:50,590
Welcome to Thrillig Miracles!

250
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:58,699
Here he is, all the way
from the country of Britain...

251
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:01,140
Terry Twillstein!

252
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:03,942
Hello-hello, Nancy!

253
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,742
Good to see you all!

254
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:09,477
What's the number one problem
in the modern kitchen today?

255
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,018
I don't know.

256
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,952
Nobody knows!

257
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:16,491
It's food!

258
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,693
That's why I've invented
the new...

259
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:24,325
...Food-Erator!

260
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,898
All you do is take
your nicely prepared meal,

261
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,337
chop it up into little bits,

262
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,069
feed it into the Food-Erator,

263
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:38,842
drop some of the special
Food-Erator green slop in there...

264
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,616
You're off!

265
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:45,347
It absolutely destroys food!

266
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,446
Like magic!

267
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,633
Never mind!

268
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:03,194
Right there where...
Could you rewind it?

269
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,332
Go back.
Right there.

270
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,137
That moment right there.

271
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,307
That blooper where the blade leaps
out of the machine into her chest...

272
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:18,217
think you could do some of your
Hollywood magic and just cut that out?

273
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,618
No.

274
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:22,851
We don't have
that kind of equipment here.

275
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,798
- But I think it could hurt sales!
- Hopefully!

276
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,205
You gotta come see this.

277
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:39,934
We got more footage of that
Ronnie Dobbs guy getting arrested.

278
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:40,997
Sweet.

279
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,315
I have nothing.

280
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,652
I'm a failure!

281
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:01,195
If only I had somethig...

282
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,589
...something that people
actually wated...

283
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,525
...that I could sell to them.

284
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,091
Pretty momma.

- H'm udercover.
- The you should't be hookig.

290
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,567
Out of the car.

291
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:54,241
This guy Ronnie Dobbs, he's been
arrested on TV a bunch of times.

292
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:55,806
You're uder arrest.

Is this perchance
Tas-Tee Liquors?

00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:07,222
I don't know, faggot!

320
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,348
I don't know, faggot!

321
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,619
I've been looking all day long.

322
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,186
What would you say if I told you

323
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:20,099
that I was looking for
a Ronwell Quincy Dobbs?

324
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,531
I'd say "Huh," too.

325
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:25,732
Perhaps he goes by
the appellation of Ronnie.

326
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,640
That fucker been lyin' to you!
He ain't from no Appalachia!

327
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,302
So you know him?

328
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,370
Hell, yeah!
Ronnie Dobbs!

329
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:35,610
Ronnie said he and Clay
was headed over to Duke's Last Call.

330
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,618
Just over the railroad tracks.

331
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,154
What great good luck!

332
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,653
Good shot!

333
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:48,990
Thank you!

334
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:51,225
Run on, fancy pants!

335
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,291
Get out of the way!
Back up! Get out of the way!

336
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:55,529
Damn that Ronnie Dobbs!

337
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,435
Ronnie Dobbs was here, yes?

338
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,066
- You a friend of Dobbs?
- I'd like to be, sir.

339
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:03,310
You tell that little asshole

340
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:06,905
next time he feels like pulling a prank
and lighting his shit on fire,

341
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,973
do it in somebody else's bar.

342
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:11,781
You hear that, Dobbs?

343
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:25,065
- The dance is ruined!
- Please. Damn that Dobbs.

344
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,226
That's the one.
Have you seen him?

345
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:34,704
Look out!

346
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:38,237
I'm the principal!

347
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:46,086
Let's get it, Ronnie!

348
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:48,179
- Kids, get home!
- Look out!

349
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,224
Get out of the way!

350
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:52,021
Run for your lives!

351
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,098
Magic!

352
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:04,696
Glorious!

353
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:26,651
This shit's gotta stop.

354
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,559
Run, Clay, run!

355
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,961
Thanks, chum!

356
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,556
Wait up, y'all!

357
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,803
Mr. Dobbs, slow down!

358
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,868
- I didn't do nothing!
- I'm not with the coppers!

359
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,641
- Please!
- You got the wrong man!

360
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,582
I'm here to proposition you!

361
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:54,021
- Get off me!
- Hear me out!

362
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,750
You ain't a cop!

363
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:58,520
My name is Terry,
and I'm from Hollywood.

364
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,027
Ronnie, you are not
like other men.

365
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:05,362
You've got something,
something special, and I want it badly.

366
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:09,026
I want to be the man
behind the man!

367
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:12,540
I realize I'm coming
all over you here,

368
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:15,041
but it's been building up
inside of me for weeks,

369
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,408
and I can't control myself.

370
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,313
Listen, sir, let me show you
what you've got inside of you,

371
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:26,844
what could be inside of you if you'd just
give me the tiniest hole of opportunity!

372
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:30,915
We can go back to your place
right now, and I'll pack your shit!

373
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,823
Help! Police!

374
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:34,293
Him!

375
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:37,160
- You two get down from there.
- He's the one you want!

376
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,824
- I'm coming!
- It's okay, officers!

377
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:42,426
Everything's fine!
I'm from Hollywood!

378
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,098
Wait. Hold on.
There's more.

379
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,803
I'll pay Mr. Dobbs' fine.
You release him to me.

380
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,507
No dice, precious.

381
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:57,314
What if I told you that I'd take him
out of this town, the county...

382
00:23:57,385 --> 00:24:00,548
wait a second...
the entire state, for good?

383
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:03,589
For good?

384
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,452
He's yours.

385
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:11,398
But if he ever
shows up here again,

386
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:13,730
I'm gonna put him in jail
for the rest of his life.

387
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:17,636
And I ain't hardly bullshitting!
You understand me, boy?

388
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,640
You've got yourself a deal!

389
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,401
And I'll throw in
the fabulous Nickel Holder!

390
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:27,414
The problem with nickels is,
you're always losing them!

391
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:29,382
It holds one nickel!

392
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,718
Man, where you from, anyhow?

393
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:44,698
I'm from Britain.
There. My green card.

394
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,763
- Terry Twillstein?
- At your service.

395
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,862
What's all these?

396
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,873
Those are my babies.

397
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:55,876
That's the Salad Evaporator.
Sucks dressing off of salads.

398
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:57,434
No one bought it.

399
00:24:57,512 --> 00:25:00,777
That's the Vomit Whip.
Turns vomit back into food!

400
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:03,750
And the Fish Magician hides fish.

401
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,479
No one bought it.

402
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:09,217
Man, look, what do you want
with me, anyway?

403
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,282
You're my latest product.

404
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,056
I'm gonna take you to Hollywood
and build a TV show around you

405
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,461
and your talents.

406
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,726
What talents?

407
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,290
For getting arrested.

408
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:22,928
- I don't want to get arrested.
- I know you don't.

409
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,165
That's why you run so fast
from the coppers

410
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,004
and you spin
such fabulous yarns.

411
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:31,410
My talents.

412
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,571
That's right!

413
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:35,013
All you'll have to do
is what you already do do.

414
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,313
I hope you don't mind
becoming rich and famous.

415
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:39,581
Hell no!

416
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:46,060
I could get into that, man.

417
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:49,924
You know, Ronnie,
you and I are a lot alike.

418
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:51,989
We both come
from a place where...

419
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,001
Shut the fuck up a second.
Pull in here.

420
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:57,038
- Something I want to get for the trip.
- Okay. Sure.

421
00:25:57,105 --> 00:26:00,632
Just take a second, a'ight?
Just keep the car running, a'ight?

422
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,904
- Sure, Ronnie.
- Hey, Ronnie!

423
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,206
Hey, Clay!

424
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,680
Sorry about that bus flipping over.
Next time you gotta drive.

425
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:10,217
That's all right.
It was my fault.

426
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:13,686
Doesn't matter. Doesn't hurt anyway.
I can't feel my legs.

427
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:16,485
- You lucky.
- Rock on.

428
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,526
- A'ight.
- A'ight.

429
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:24,389
- Hello.
- This here's a right nice car.

430
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:29,696
I'm a friend of Ronnie's,
so I'll just slip in the backseat.

431
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,898
No, that's not necessary.

432
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:34,498
License and registration, please.

433
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:37,511
- You're frightening me, hillbilly.
- Am I?

434
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:40,446
Listen, why don't you
get me in this golden chariot

435
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,506
and take me once
around the gas pumps?

436
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,575
Why don't you
go bother someone else?

437
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:48,180
- Just let me in there!
- No! Please, no!

438
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:51,885
Mercy sakes! You're not from around
these here parts, are you, fish 'n' chips?

439
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,949
- Dobbs!
- Run, Clay!

440
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,655
- Come back!
- Free six-pack!

441
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,097
Little dogies!
Get over here now!

442
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,793
A'ight, let's go.

443
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,062
Behind you!

444
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:05,030
- My bad.
- Just go.

445
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,267
Dobbs!
Goddamnit!

446
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:09,139
- You little son of a...
- Go, go, go, go!

447
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:11,601
Come back here!

448
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,443
Next stop, Hollywood.

449
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,140
Next stop, Hollywood!

450
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:19,048
Next stop, Hollywood!

451
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,116
Yeah, come here.
Sweet relief.

452
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,501
That's I Loathe L.A.
by Daffy Mal Yikle-Yakle.

453
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,509
a hilarious takeoff
o that other sog.

454
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:46,035
Come to Hummers i Redodo Beach
toight from 9:00 util 2:00.

455
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:49,242
Guys. Brig your boers.
'cause we're givig away tits!

456
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:52,912
It's a regular dream factory!

457
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:56,650
Well, wake up, Ronnie,
'cause it's all too real!

458
00:27:56,725 --> 00:28:00,456
Now, let's get in there
and grab 'em by the nuts!

459
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:03,190
What?
Let's do what to who?

460
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:20,647
Okay. I'm holding
the deciding ballot.

461
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,714
Let's see who's voted out.

462
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,555
Bring me your torch.

463
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,831
Tough break, kid.

464
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,643
All right.

465
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:11,122
And now...

466
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:14,767
...we feast!

467
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,815
This show is killing us,

468
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:37,221
but we need one of these
reality-based shows to compete.

469
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:38,884
Absolutely, Bob.
Well?

470
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,952
Mr. Webber. Terry Twillstei
is here to see you.

471
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,463
Send them in.

472
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:47,965
Hello-hello!
My name's Terry Twillstein.

473
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,096
Hello, how are you?
That's a fine how-do-you-do.

474
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:53,663
I have a TV show that features

475
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:57,905
cops, mayhem, chases,
and roustabouts!

476
00:29:57,979 --> 00:29:59,503
What do you think?

477
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,309
Sounds a lot like the show Fuzz.

478
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:06,385
Been there, done that.

479
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:08,422
You drive a hard bargain, sir.

480
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,890
What if I told you I'd take you
to a place you'd never been

481
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,450
and do something to you
that's never been done?

482
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:16,964
See, my show features
just one man, a single man,

483
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:20,228
getting arrested every week
in a different city.

484
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:23,668
That way people could feel for him
and grow to love him,

485
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,797
and he could be a hero,
a man of the people,

486
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:29,435
a common man with a silver tongue
and wings on his feet.

487
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:32,378
I'm talking about Ronnie Dobbs.

488
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,883
Don't mind if I do.

489
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:39,948
Well...

490
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,982
My immediate reaction is no,

491
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:46,390
but I've got kind of
a "yessy" aftertaste.

492
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:50,220
Part of me loves it,
and then this other part of me

493
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:54,064
hates the first part for loving it,
'cause the second part hates it.

494
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:55,193
Fran?

495
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,139
I'm forgainst it.

496
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:20,018
Well, I gotta say, I love it.

497
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:22,154
Really?

498
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:27,793
Well, it looks to me like
you've got yourself a show!

499
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:30,269
Congratulations!

500
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:32,863
- Twillstein, right?
- Yeah.

501
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,602
That Terry fellow.
he mastermided the whole thig

502
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:44,709
like some geius Eistei from hell
meets the Wolf Ma o steroids.

503
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,219
Then Ronnie gets arrested.

504
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:48,050
Get him in the car,
get the car pulling away.

505
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:50,556
Boom! Magic! Perfect!

506
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,388
That was it.

507
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,360
Roie was off ad ruig...

508
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,331
but ot too fast.
or there would't be o show!

509
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,388
Good dog!

510
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:02,732
May h have oe secod to pet the dog
ad let him kow h'm friedly?

511
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:04,396
h mea you o harm. Dog!

512

Terry, I don't believe it.
Man...

588
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:35,681
If six months ago you would have said
that someday l, Ronnie Dobbs,

589
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,310
would be eating
the world's biggest hotdog,

590
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,878
I wouldn't have believed a goddamned
word out of your lying mouth.

591
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,058
Only in Hollywood!

592
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:49,723
That's not all. I have another surprise
for you, and you're gonna love it.

593
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:51,389
There's a bigger hotdog?

594
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:53,933
It's much better than that!

595
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,105
Here we are, Ronnie!

596
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,634
Hell.

597
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,815
I don't like museums.

598
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:11,818
No, it's a house.

599
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:14,116
It's your house.

600
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:27,089
It's glorious,

601
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:35,338

602
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:39,846
I like it and all, Terry, but it's gonna take
an awful long time to fuck it up.

603
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:44,408
I did foresee that eventuality.
You won't be alone.

604
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,584
Kyle, Tonya!
Fucked-up dog!

Hey, Clay.
Man, I'm sorry about...

607
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:59,563
That's all right, Ronnie.
It's kind of my fault anyway.

608
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,070
Good part is, I don't have
no feeling below my chin.

609
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,297
All right!

610
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:07,068

Ronnie!
You're fabulous, man!

613

Here's to you.

00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,891
Come on, dog,

617
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,586
Eat it! Lick it!

618
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,255
There he goes!
Look at him!

619
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,093
Lick it up.
Good for his coat.

620
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,996

621
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,058
Give him a kiss.
Give him a good one.

622
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:37,263
That's Ronnie Dobbs.
Give him a little tongue.

623
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,327
Okay!

624
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:40,306
You've got to come over
and rob us sometime.

625
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:42,808
- Will do, will do.
- We won't even call the police.

626
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:45,675
- Nice mullet.
- Colin, man, what's up?

627
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:48,479
Hey, buddy!

628
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,779

Ronnie Dobbs!
What's up?

632
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:01,718
Why weren't you at my party?

633
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:05,493
That's okay. I'm gonna have

634
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,193

00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:18,601
- You have to do me a favor.
- At your service.

640
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,271
Tell me to fuck off!

641
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,679

Man, like that?

00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:46,506
Ronnie, there you are.
Come along.

649
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:50,977
Birthday girl,

650
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,809
Someone very special
came here just to see you.

651
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,940
His name's Chow-Chow,
and he's here on behalf

652
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:58,144
of the Make-Your-Last-Wish
Foundation.

653
00:38:58,219 --> 00:38:59,379

654
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,979

655
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:09,193
Chow-Chow, what's up?

656
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,130
- I'm sad.
- Why's that?

657
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,100
The doctor says I need
special shoes for my fat feet

658
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:18,866
so I can be like a normal kid
and run and play!

659
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:23,308
Kiddo, no more tears,
'cause Uncle Ronnie Dobbs is here.

660
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:25,208
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

661
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,305
I'm gonna go out in this world
and get everything I can get.

662
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:30,942
I'm gonna be rich, super rich.

663
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:34,784
I'm gonna be spending money
like a chimp in a beat-off contest.

664
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:35,947
Yeah?

665
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:37,786
- Don't interrupt me, now.
- So sorry.

666
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,951
Then I'm gonna get
1,000 pair of special shoes,

667
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:43,827
put 'em in a big o" pile,
and just burn 'em all!

668
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:46,958
- Mr. Ronnie!
- Don't interrupt me!

669
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:49,468
- I done told you once.
- So sorry. No interrupt.

670
00:39:49,537 --> 00:39:52,529
I'm gonna get

671
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:56,235
and I'm gonna paint it gold,
and I'm gonna get so much pussy.

672
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,301
But I ain't gonna leave you out.

673
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:00,643
You gonna get some.
I'll get you laid.

674

What kind you like?

675
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,414
That's a tough one.
Don't answer yet.

676
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,679
Save it. Okay.

677
00:40:05,753 --> 00:40:08,654

to where my bedroom's at.

681
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,435
- Ronnie Dobbs.
- Yeah.

682
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,166
- Scott Thompson.
- Okay.

683
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,767
Man, I love your work!
Is it real, though?

684
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,278
Do you really get arrested?

685
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,643
Hell, yeah, bitch!

686
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,446
This music is awful.

687
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,782
Mind if I raid your CD cabinet?

688
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,948
Raid my...
No, man.

689
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,615
You want to...
no, man.

690
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,751
My CD cabinet is "exit only."

691
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,353
Thought you was gonna try
to turn me gay when I wasn't looking?

692
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:53,730
I know all about y'al"s
gay conspiracy agenda.

693
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:56,429
- Please!
- Nice try.

694
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,802
Lucky Pierre, this is Ramrod.

695
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,241
We have a breach of security.
He kows everythig.

696
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,835
Code red.
h repeat... code red!

697
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:16,687
We just received
our numbers from overseas.

698
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:18,418
Combined with our efforts here,

699
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:21,154
everything is proceeding
precisely according to plan...

700
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,925
gay bars are up,
straight men are experimenting,

701
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,990
the priesthood
is still our number one...

702
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,056
What?

703
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,968
We got a leak.

704
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,030
What?!

705
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:39,002
We're gonna have to shut down

706
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,243
this entire worldwide
multibillion-dollar gay conspiracy.

707
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,410
What about the gay-dar machine?

708
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:48,717
- And the $3 bill?
- What about the skin flute?

709
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:51,257
Sorry, ladies.

710
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:52,553
It's over.

711
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:56,452
Tell our source to get
back into the closet, pronto.

712
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:01,000
- Damn it!
- Ramrod. Code blue.

713
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:03,059
Get back i the closet.
Repeat... code...

714
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,041
Ladies!
You both have beautiful posture.

715
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,101
Could I get you a drink?

716
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:13,608
What's up, Ronnie?

717
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,052
Damn!
It's the cardboard beer girl!

718
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:46,474
My name is Kayla.
I am so excited to meet you.

719
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:48,742
I am such a huge fan of yours.

720
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:54,885
My agent's been telling me
how hot you are... and I agree.

721
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:02,255
I'm hot... hot for you,
if you know what I mean.

722
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:05,058
I know what you mean.

723
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:10,092
Tell me, is that a beer in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?

724
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,161
No, I ain't got no beer.

725
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:15,368
No, that's a hard-on.

726
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:18,775
That's 'cause of you.
You gave that to me.

727
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:25,580
Well, maybe your big dog
could train my naughty pussycat.

728
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:30,249
Well, I ain't into pets
or nothing, so, nah.

729
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:32,383
But I got a better idea.

730
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:35,758
How's about Dr. Ronnie
takes this here hard-on

731
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:39,492
and writes you a prescription
for a hot beef injection?

732
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,567
Maybe it's time
you showed me your bedroom.

733
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:47,239
I could do that,
but I got a better idea.

734
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:49,242
How's about you and I go fu...

735
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:24,280
Well, Ronnie,
you've bedded your dream girl.

736
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:28,760
What is it?

737
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:34,798
I don't know.
Terry, man, it's weird.

738
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:38,396
She's hot and all,
you know, but it's weird.

739
00:47:38,472 --> 00:47:40,667
When I'm making
the sweetest of loves to her...

740
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:43,073
doing it for real, you know?

741
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:47,341
I'm loving on her, and I'm pulling out
in time and everything,

742
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:49,746
and it's just like...

743
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:53,652
I don't know.
I can't help but think of Tammy.

744
00:47:54,655 --> 00:47:56,987
Maybe I should see
a doctor or something.

745
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:03,259
I'll give you a diagnosis for free.
You're in love.

746
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:09,262
Since we're pouring
our hearts out to each other,

747
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:11,429
I've got a little secret to share,

748
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:14,474
something I've never shared
with anyone before.

749
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,008
My accent...

750
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:18,811
...it isn't real.

751
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:20,403
You ain't from England?

752
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,142
No, I'm from England,

753
00:48:23,216 --> 00:48:27,152
but I was born
without an accent.

754
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:33,725
That's cool.

755
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:36,925
I wonder if Tammy
would take me back.

756
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:41,234
Man, get me a bus ticket
back home tomorrow.

757
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:42,734
No, sir!

758
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:44,930
You have a TV show to do.

759
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,734
I'm gonna go back home.

760
00:48:46,807 --> 00:48:50,208
You're not going anywhere,
but I'll tell you what I will do.

761
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:53,405
I'll get Tammy a bus ticket
to come out here!

762
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,574
When she sees
what you've done... the house,

763
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,780
the monster truck
in the garage, the beer girl...

764
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:06,752
I mean, it'll only make her jealous,

765
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:09,887
and that's the number one
motivation for women.

766
00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:11,260
Right.

767
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:13,629
Right, man.
Jealousy.

768
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:17,229
That's like women's kryptonite.

769
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:31,982
Anybody home?

770
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,049
Echaté.

771
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:40,424
Ma chérie has arrived,
and your knight in finery awaits.

772
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:43,054
Ronnie, this place is amazing.

773
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,998
Yes, my dear, and it is
a mere pittance of my vast estate,

774
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,058
some of which
you can't even see.

775
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:53,505
I got a bank account now,
and I'm wearing socks.

776
00:49:54,374 --> 00:49:58,538
Behold, glorious gifts
from God and above...

777
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:03,481
a toilet paper rosette
for a true lady of the evening,

778
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:08,146
and an Italian cottage
made of international cheeses.

779
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:12,922
You can eat the whole thing,
except for the bottom. That's cardboard.

780
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:15,458
I almost forgot.

781
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:19,090
Let me introduce to you
my secret weapon.

782
00:50:25,672 --> 00:50:27,105
Who's she?

783
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:29,039
Only the girl I been fucking.

784
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:33,172
Jealous much?

785
00:50:38,585 --> 00:50:40,212
Way to go, bitch.
You fucked up.

786
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:06,564
Hey, bro.

787
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,804
You look like you could use something
to make you feel a whole lot better.

788
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:13,737
Come inside, man.

789
00:52:13,814 --> 00:52:14,803
It's okay.

790
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,414
Ad ewly elected goveror
Hark Trellis

791
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:23,251
is makig atioal ews

792
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:26,417
with a record umber of executios
i the state of Georgia.

793
00:52:26,493 --> 00:52:28,927
So far. 35 thrilled prisoers...

794
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:31,259
Sorry. The word is "doomed. "

795
00:52:31,331 --> 00:52:34,926
Make that doomed prisoers
excitedly skipped towards death row.

796
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:36,866
No. They did't.
They were led.

797
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:40,202
What the hell are we paying
Malaysians 35 cents a T-shirt for

798
00:52:40,273 --> 00:52:44,175
when we can get them
from Tai-fucking-wan for 22 cents?!

799
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:47,008
Time magazine is accusing you
of exploiting Ronnie!

800
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,311
Great! More publicity
for my musical!

801
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:54,977
Come on!

802
00:52:55,889 --> 00:52:57,186
I want to hear this!

803
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:20,866
No, no, no!
That was shite, pure shite!

804
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:25,543
- I don't disagree.
- Really?

805
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:27,978
I think it's ridiculous like this.

806
00:54:28,048 --> 00:54:32,075
It's like a lie, and we've spent
the whole play getting to this point.

807
00:54:32,152 --> 00:54:34,484
We've unpeeled the onion.
He should be naked.

808
00:54:34,554 --> 00:54:36,715
It's a naked,
beautiful moment.

809
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,257
Let's try it your way.

810
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:40,691
- Please.
- Mr. Twillstein.

811
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,694
- It's about Ronnie.
- What about Ronnie?

812
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:44,992
He can't get arrested.

813
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,258
Get me on the next flight out.

814
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:52,696
My golden goose.

815
00:54:52,772 --> 00:54:54,763
Okay, take it from the beginning.

816
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:07,548
It's hard to say what you want

817
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,883
without putting up
those old masks

818
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:12,219
of "I'm not good enough,"

819
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:15,225
or "I couldn't possibly obtain this."

820
00:55:16,361 --> 00:55:19,728
Complete this sentence...
"I want...

821
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:22,028
"I want...

822
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:27,936
In my fondest moments
of wantonness, I want..."

823
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:34,139
Mary Lynn.
What does Mary Lynn want?

824
00:55:34,946 --> 00:55:36,937
I want a magenta horse.

825
00:55:38,784 --> 00:55:41,014
And I want to fly away with it

826
00:55:41,086 --> 00:55:43,350
into a reddish background,

827
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:46,185
and I want pixies.

828
00:55:46,258 --> 00:55:47,850
I want pixies!

829
00:55:47,926 --> 00:55:51,362
Good.
Those are all doable.

830
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:52,521
Good.

831
00:55:53,598 --> 00:55:56,829
Jim. What does Jim want?

832
00:55:56,902 --> 00:56:02,534
I want to write a hemp cookbook
using hemp ink,

833
00:56:02,607 --> 00:56:07,442
and I want to build houses
out of hemp for the homeless,

834
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:13,382
and I want to make clothes
out of hemp for the world,

835
00:56:13,451 --> 00:56:16,443
and I just...

836
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:20,116
It's okay. I know it's hard, Jim.
Say it. You're among friends.

837
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:23,457
I want to smoke
some of the hemp.

838
00:56:24,629 --> 00:56:26,119
Just a little. Just...

839
00:56:27,632 --> 00:56:28,929
...a little.

840
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:32,026
Good.
Getting more honest.

841
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:33,968
Yeah.

842
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:36,371
Jeff Goldblum.

843
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:39,672
What does
Jeff Goldblum want?

844
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:42,611
I want my money back.

845
00:56:46,218 --> 00:56:52,088
And I want angels
to give it to me.

846
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:56,389
And pixies

847
00:56:56,461 --> 00:57:00,557
to count it out for me,

848
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:04,227
and a gnome or a hobbit

849
00:57:04,302 --> 00:57:08,568
or an elf to sleep
at the foot of my bed,

850
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,201
and have... I just want them
all over my backyard.

851
00:57:12,277 --> 00:57:15,838
No matter what happens with any
of that, I do want my money back.

852
00:57:17,649 --> 00:57:19,708
Ronnie Dobbs.

853
00:57:19,784 --> 00:57:22,412
Our newest recruit.
Thank you, Greg.

854
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:27,323
What does Ronnie want?

855
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:30,588
I think I got it.

856
00:57:32,597 --> 00:57:35,430
I want to love people,

857
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,230
and I want people
to love on me.

858
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:40,769
And I want...

859
00:57:41,773 --> 00:57:43,331
...pecan pie.

860
00:57:43,408 --> 00:57:45,399
I want angels
to make me that pie.

861
00:57:45,477 --> 00:57:47,468
I want angels
to make me that pie so good!

862
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:52,642
And I want whipped cream
and strawberries on top!

863
00:58:02,694 --> 00:58:04,423
I'll tell you what h want.

864
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:07,329
Terry! I thought
you was in New York.

865
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:10,630
A lot of people
think a lot of things about New York.

866
00:58:10,702 --> 00:58:13,933
- I want...
- He didn't pay.

867
00:58:14,005 --> 00:58:17,668
It's $1,500
to say what you want.

868
00:58:17,742 --> 00:58:20,108
Stuff it!
I want the old Ronnie back!

869
00:58:20,178 --> 00:58:22,840
Tonya and Kyle told me
you've become a vegetarian,

870
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:24,973
and you haven't
drank with them in weeks.

871
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:29,111
Hey, Tonya, Kyle,
fucked-up dog.

872
00:58:29,187 --> 00:58:32,156
Hey, Clay.
Sorry 'bout that spinal thing.

873
00:58:32,223 --> 00:58:34,350
ht's okay. Roie.

874
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:36,656
h was druk. Too.

875
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:38,889
Have you read
these letters I'm getting?

876
00:58:38,964 --> 00:58:41,432
"Dear Ronnie,
my name is Maurice.

877
00:58:41,499 --> 00:58:44,093
"I am eight years old.
I am your biggest fan.

878
00:58:44,169 --> 00:58:46,694
"How come you are
not so drunk anymore?

879
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:50,764
"My daddy says you were never
really drunk, just a Hollywood phony!

880
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:53,470
I told him he was wrong.
He beat the shit out of me."

881
00:58:53,545 --> 00:58:56,036
I've got sacks of these
back at my office!

882
00:58:56,114 --> 00:58:57,843
Terry, man, it's hard!

883
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:00,510
You don't know what it's like
being a superstar!

884
00:59:00,585 --> 00:59:04,851
You get all these people going,
"What can I do for you, Mr. Dobbs?"

885
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:07,289
You've got to think of things
they've got to do.

886
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,122
You just don't know.
It's hard.

887
00:59:09,194 --> 00:59:10,456
Here. Have a drink.

888
00:59:10,528 --> 00:59:12,792
- It's no fun anymore.
- I know, I know.

889
00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:14,695
Take a break, there.

890
00:59:16,601 --> 00:59:18,296
Everybody's giving you free...

891
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,396
A little bit more.
Drink, drink, drink.

892
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:26,836
A little bit more.

893
00:59:30,749 --> 00:59:32,910
I got my beer goggles on now!

894
00:59:32,984 --> 00:59:36,249
That's right!
I'm starting to see clearly.

895
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,186
This does smell like bullshit.

896
00:59:38,256 --> 00:59:40,656
Y'all get out of my house.
Get on out of here!

897
00:59:40,725 --> 00:59:43,751
Freaky new wave hippie!
Get out of here, blondie!

898
00:59:43,828 --> 00:59:46,922
You, too, Jeff Goldenstein!
Go on! Get going!

899
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:50,263
Yeah! 'cause old
Ronnie Dobbs is back!

900
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,571
Oh, Ronnie,
I love you!

901
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:02,640
Hello.
It's me again.

902
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:05,205
The scene you were
about to see has been cut

903
01:00:05,283 --> 01:00:09,344
so the film you're watching could obtain
the rating mandated by the studio.

904
01:00:09,421 --> 01:00:14,290
It's a shame, as it was a beautifully shot
and poignant scene of love...

905
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:16,623
a thing of the past, I suppose.

906
01:00:16,694 --> 01:00:19,060
Many famous films
have had scenes cut

907
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,564
to reach a specified audience.

908
01:00:21,633 --> 01:00:24,693
Here's a scene cut
from a popular children's film.

909
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,423
A kick in the cunt?

910
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:27,164
I'm sorry. That was
an inappropriate scene to show here,

911
01:01:27,232 --> 01:01:29,666
as it was cut for time,
not content.

912
01:01:29,734 --> 01:01:32,168
Let's rejoin the film
you've been watching.

913
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:34,762
Roie retured
to his hometow a hero.

914
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:41,170
Come on, Ronnie,
aren't you excited?

915
01:01:41,246 --> 01:01:42,406
I guess.

916
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,473
I was just kind of expecting Tammy
to come down and see me, that's all.

917
01:01:48,553 --> 01:01:49,645
Thank you.

918
01:01:49,721 --> 01:01:52,519
Thank you.
A'ight, come on, now.

919
01:01:57,595 --> 01:02:00,587
I'd like to thank Mr. Dobbs
for farting the alphabet.

920
01:02:00,665 --> 01:02:02,929
He's definitely a man
of many talents.

921
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:04,434
Now, here of course...

922
01:02:04,502 --> 01:02:06,402
Okay, P.S.

923
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:08,200
I just want to say, okay,

924
01:02:08,273 --> 01:02:11,538
some of y'all think
that I don't deserve a second chance,

925
01:02:11,609 --> 01:02:14,703
and I swear,
if I were to get a second chance

926
01:02:14,779 --> 01:02:17,213
or even a fourth chance,

927
01:02:17,282 --> 01:02:20,217
I would make a good husband
to these people.

928
01:02:20,285 --> 01:02:22,549
That's God's honest truth.

929
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:31,961
Baby, you see me farting?

930
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:35,158
Arrest this piece of shit, boys.

931
01:02:35,233 --> 01:02:36,632
What the hell?

932
01:02:36,701 --> 01:02:38,498
You're going down
for good this time.

933
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,265
He didn't do nothing.

934
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:42,704
That's really true this time.

935
01:02:42,774 --> 01:02:47,040
It's my new policy, a little thing
I like to call "no strikes and you're out."

936
01:02:47,979 --> 01:02:49,310
You can't do that!

937
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,814
Governor, please,
Ronnie's a celebrity now.

938
01:02:51,883 --> 01:02:54,010
Don't you make
an exception for them?

939
01:02:54,085 --> 01:02:56,645
We had a deal, Twillstein.

940
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:58,780
I want to file a reward!

941
01:02:58,856 --> 01:03:00,153
Make a hole.

942
01:03:00,225 --> 01:03:03,422
Y'all seen that! Do something!
Don't just stand there!

943
01:03:12,804 --> 01:03:14,931
Man, what's up?

944
01:03:15,006 --> 01:03:16,769
I can't hear you.

945
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:20,004
Yes, Ronnie. The phone.
Pick up the phone.

946
01:03:20,078 --> 01:03:21,773
The phone!

947
01:03:21,846 --> 01:03:23,177
Pick up the phone!

948
01:03:23,248 --> 01:03:24,738
Hang on.

949
01:03:24,816 --> 01:03:25,942
Yeah-lo?

950
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:27,450
Ronnie, it's Terry.

951
01:03:27,518 --> 01:03:29,076
Hang on.
He's right here.

952
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:30,882
Man, it's for you.

953
01:03:30,955 --> 01:03:31,944
No.

954
01:03:32,023 --> 01:03:35,720
No, it's me on the phone.
I'm on the phone!

955
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:38,127
Okay.

956
01:03:38,196 --> 01:03:40,858
It looks like he's on another call.
Can you call back?

957
01:03:40,932 --> 01:03:45,869
Ronnie, it's me, Terry,
speaking to you via the telephone.

958
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:47,302
Oh, man!

959
01:03:48,973 --> 01:03:51,134
Okay, I got it now.

960
01:03:51,209 --> 01:03:54,610
Man, how are you?
You know you've got a phone call?

961
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:56,806
Yes, I realize that.

962
01:03:56,881 --> 01:03:58,974
Ronnie, how are you?

963
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,644
I'm good.
I can't complain, man.

964
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:03,914
Check out the threads. Free.

965
01:04:04,622 --> 01:04:07,648
You know, Ronnie,
this is all my fault.

966
01:04:07,725 --> 01:04:10,751
I was so busy
exploiting you that...

967
01:04:10,828 --> 01:04:12,295
Yeah. Hang on.
That's cool.

968
01:04:12,363 --> 01:04:15,696
They asked me if I wanted
to get electrocuted or injected.

969
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:17,701
I was like,
"Wait a minute.

970
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:20,602
"What say I jump out
of an airplane what's on fire,

971
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:24,108
"no parachute,
but straight into a shark tank

972
01:04:24,175 --> 01:04:27,508
filled with poisonous razorblades?"

973
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,542
That's crazy talk!

974
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:32,981
You're not jumping
out of any fiery airplane

975
01:04:33,051 --> 01:04:35,383
into a shark tank of razors!

976
01:04:35,453 --> 01:04:38,047
I know.
They said I had to get electrocuted.

977
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:39,783
What are you talking about?

978
01:04:39,857 --> 01:04:42,348
I'm on death row.
Didn't you hear?

979
01:04:42,427 --> 01:04:45,157
Part of the governor's
new Get-Tough campaign.

980
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:47,561
He's finally cleaning this state up.

981
01:04:47,632 --> 01:04:49,532
That can't be.

982
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,534
They gonna kill me tomorrow.

983
01:04:51,602 --> 01:04:53,126
Let's go, Dobbs.

984
01:04:53,204 --> 01:04:55,229
I'll see you in hell, Terry.

985
01:04:56,107 --> 01:04:58,871
Do something real bad
so I can see you in hell, okay?

986
01:05:09,821 --> 01:05:11,049
Ronnie Dobbs.

987
01:05:12,523 --> 01:05:14,423
Naive bumpkin.

988
01:05:15,126 --> 01:05:16,491
What'd you call me?

989
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:19,121
Sack of manure for brains.

990
01:05:21,566 --> 01:05:24,034
We regrettably
iterrupt Fishin' with Guns

991
01:05:24,102 --> 01:05:25,933
with this special ews bulleti.

992
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:27,527
Good eveig.

993
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:28,970
We have cofirmed repots

994
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,134
that the so of goveror Hark Trellis
has bee kidapped.

995
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:35,077
The kidappers have demaded
the immediate turover...

996
01:05:35,146 --> 01:05:38,274
- Inbred baboon.
- Of TVsuperstar Roie Dobbs.

997
01:05:38,349 --> 01:05:39,373
We ow go live...

998
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,918
- That's it!
- Shut up, you illiterate butterbean!

999
01:05:41,986 --> 01:05:44,682
Get him out of here!
Out the door, through the window!

1000
01:05:44,756 --> 01:05:46,690
Get him out of here!

1001
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:50,524
Unhand me, hairy hillfolk.
I'm trying to watch this!

1002
01:05:50,595 --> 01:05:54,554
The lucky boy...
sorry. The ulucky boy...

1003
01:05:54,632 --> 01:05:58,090
is beig held hostage
by approximately four getleme.

1004
01:05:58,169 --> 01:05:59,227
Gentlemen?!

1005
01:05:59,303 --> 01:06:02,238
No! Try "terrorists"!
Stupid tongue. Sorry.

1006
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:04,740
Four terrorists
who are demanding the release

1007
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:08,040
of a prisoner named Ronnie Dobbs
from Georgia's death row,

1008
01:06:08,112 --> 01:06:10,307
a swank, luxurious
place of enchantment...

1009
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:12,076
What did I just say?

1010
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:15,347
This tongue of mine,
it's all twisted up!

1011
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,910
...make a deal.

1012
01:06:16,988 --> 01:06:19,479
You hear me?
We will make a deal.

1013
01:06:21,025 --> 01:06:23,016
Real simple.

1014
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:30,724
Real simple.
There's o eed for violece.

1015
01:06:30,802 --> 01:06:32,861
I want you to stay calm.

1016
01:06:32,937 --> 01:06:34,666
This can be worked out.

1017
01:06:36,908 --> 01:06:40,901
All right in there, listen up.
This is the governor talking to you.

1018
01:06:40,978 --> 01:06:42,809
I heard your demands.

1019
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,542
Now I want to tell you
my demands.

1020
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:50,019
Let my son go
and shoot yourselves in the head!

1021
01:06:50,087 --> 01:06:51,850
How's that sit with you?

1022
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:56,292
I didn't get a nickname like "Get Tough"
by caring about my son!

1023
01:06:58,629 --> 01:07:00,028
- Give me that.
- Twillstein!

1024
01:07:00,097 --> 01:07:02,861
Don't listen to him!
He's not on your side!

1025
01:07:02,934 --> 01:07:04,834
You can do
whatever you can dream!

1026
01:07:04,902 --> 01:07:06,699
Twillstein!
Get him!

1027
01:07:13,611 --> 01:07:16,705
We ain't makin'
no deals here, pal.

1028
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:18,749
I'm not with the bobbies.

1029
01:07:18,816 --> 01:07:21,182
No, I've come here to assist you.

1030
01:07:21,853 --> 01:07:24,879
Look, I realize
that you're fans of Ronnie's,

1031
01:07:24,956 --> 01:07:28,687
and you want to get him out and get
an autograph and maybe a photo,

1032
01:07:28,759 --> 01:07:31,284
but when you're done,
I'll take him.

1033
01:07:31,362 --> 01:07:35,458
You ain't taking him nowhere!
He's staying right here.

1034
01:07:35,533 --> 01:07:38,400
We got special plans for Dobbs.

1035
01:07:38,469 --> 01:07:40,528
That's wonderful.
What could they be?

1036
01:07:40,605 --> 01:07:43,733
We're gonna kill
the son of a bitch!

1037
01:07:43,808 --> 01:07:45,742
Kill Ronnie?

1038
01:07:47,311 --> 01:07:49,745
Why would you want
to do that?

1039
01:07:57,889 --> 01:08:00,357
You're from
that Elimiatio program.

1040
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:01,857
You got that right.

1041
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:04,292
We was shittin' in high cotton.

1042
01:08:04,362 --> 01:08:07,763
We had the number one show,
then when Dobbs showed up,

1043
01:08:07,832 --> 01:08:10,266
network pulled the plug
on our show!

1044
01:08:10,334 --> 01:08:13,269
Yeah!
They forgot all about us!

1045
01:08:13,337 --> 01:08:16,795
Hell, they left us out there
on that goddamned island to die!

1046
01:08:16,874 --> 01:08:20,810
We had to make a goddamned canoe
out of the fat guy!

1047
01:08:20,878 --> 01:08:23,472
But he's on death row.
Isn't that enough?

1048
01:08:23,548 --> 01:08:26,608
No, that ain't enough!
We gonna kill him our way!

1049
01:08:26,684 --> 01:08:29,551
And then we're gonna eat him.

1050
01:08:30,655 --> 01:08:34,284
What in the hell do you think
I'm talking about here, pinhead?

1051
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:51,235
Man, this is hard.

1052
01:08:51,309 --> 01:08:54,972
You live your whole life,
you think you've got it all worked out,

1053
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:57,810
and then comes
the toughest choice of all.

1054
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,994
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

1055
01:09:25,876 --> 01:09:27,969
Dobbs, you got more visitors.

1056
01:09:28,045 --> 01:09:30,070
Hey, little beans!

1057
01:09:30,147 --> 01:09:32,775
Gonna give you a few minutes
to say good-bye.

1058
01:09:33,517 --> 01:09:36,782
Right on!
Look at y'all.

1059
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:39,687
You guys run along
and let me talk to Daddy, okay?

1060
01:09:45,796 --> 01:09:46,990
Sorry.

1061
01:09:47,064 --> 01:09:48,361
Do those hurt?

1062
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:50,665
They a'ight.

1063
01:09:52,837 --> 01:09:54,464
Tammy, I love you so much.

1064
01:09:54,538 --> 01:09:57,200
I mean...
You're the only one I ever loved.

1065
01:09:57,274 --> 01:09:59,435
I don't know what happened.

1066
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:00,943
Ronwell...

1067
01:10:01,012 --> 01:10:05,278
sometimes God shines
His magic light beam from outer space,

1068
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:07,579
and it works in mysterious ways.

1069
01:10:08,686 --> 01:10:11,120
I may not always know
what He's thinking,

1070
01:10:11,188 --> 01:10:13,679
but I know that inside,
you're a good man.

1071
01:10:14,225 --> 01:10:17,683
Oh, baby.
I wish I had a magic genie bottle.

1072
01:10:17,762 --> 01:10:20,959
I'd rub it so hard that genie'd be like,
"What the fuck you doin'?"

1073
01:10:21,032 --> 01:10:24,024
I'd be like,
"I need some wishes bad!"

1074
01:10:24,101 --> 01:10:27,662
That genie'd be like, "You keep rubbin'
my bottle-home so hard,

1075
01:10:27,738 --> 01:10:31,139
I'll give you a foot-shaped wish
up your ass," and I'll be like...

1076
01:10:34,545 --> 01:10:36,342
Okay, let's go.
Time's up.

1077
01:10:36,414 --> 01:10:37,711
Let's go.

1078
01:10:38,749 --> 01:10:40,410
What the hell?

1079
01:11:00,204 --> 01:11:03,173
Let's kill the kid ad the sissy.

1080
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,003
I'm starvin'.

1081
01:11:05,076 --> 01:11:07,544
I'd like a snack, too.

1082
01:11:16,754 --> 01:11:18,745
Sorry we have to do this, kid...

1083
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:25,686
...but your daddy,
he is one tough bastard.

1084
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:27,526
Like father...

1085
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:31,025
...like son.

1086
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:44,641
Come on!

1087
01:11:44,715 --> 01:11:46,580
Hut!

1088
01:11:54,825 --> 01:11:55,814
Who's next?

1089
01:12:10,908 --> 01:12:12,000
Fat little prick!

1090
01:12:56,086 --> 01:12:58,953
United States Marine Corps taught me
how to kill a man in six seconds

1091
01:12:59,023 --> 01:13:00,547
before they kicked me out.

1092
01:13:00,624 --> 01:13:02,387
Let's get it on, sweetheart.

1093
01:13:47,104 --> 01:13:48,935
Son!

1094
01:13:53,677 --> 01:13:55,770
I got some demands of my own.

1095
01:13:56,313 --> 01:13:58,975
ht's cofirmed. Goveror's approved
the pardo of prisoer Dobbs.

1096
01:13:59,049 --> 01:14:00,311
10-4.
Open the perimeter gate.

1097
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:01,874
Where are we going?

1098
01:14:01,952 --> 01:14:04,352
I didn't get my last meal!
What about my waffles?

1099
01:14:04,421 --> 01:14:06,412
I was supposed to have
a wonderful breakfast

1100
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:09,755
of delicious waffles,
and I didn't get nothing,

1101
01:14:09,827 --> 01:14:11,761
not even a bowl
of good-bye mints!

1102
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:13,262
What about my waffles?

1103
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,891
You mind if I buy you
those waffles, stranger?

1104
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:20,562
Nah, man, I ain't in...
Terry?

1105
01:14:20,638 --> 01:14:23,436
What are you doing
picking up guys out here?

1106
01:14:23,507 --> 01:14:26,032
I'm only here
to pick up one man.

1107
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,772
Fuck that guy.
Give me a ride.

1108
01:14:38,889 --> 01:14:41,915
Come on, Ronnie.
Hollywood awaits.

1109
01:14:41,992 --> 01:14:45,951

Where's Ronnie?

1145
01:16:35,606 --> 01:16:37,836
Looks like you got
your truck lowered.

01:16:37,908 --> 01:16:40,843

You are. Thank you
for loaning me your husband.

1149
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:50,049
As long as he's not getting arrested,
it's okay by me.

1150
01:16:51,288 --> 01:16:53,586
I feel like I'm ready to party!

1151
01:16:53,657 --> 01:16:55,955
I got lungs of steel!

01:16:56,026 --> 01:16:58,494
A'ight, Clay, I heard that!

1153
01:16:58,562 --> 01:17:00,120
Uncle! Uncle!

1154
01:17:00,197 --> 01:17:01,528
Hey, little dude.

1155
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:04,328
You'll never guess.
I got my special shoes!

1156
01:17:04,401 --> 01:17:05,891
I don't give a goddamn.

1157
01:17:05,969 --> 01:17:07,197
Come on, Chow-Chow.

1158
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:10,104
Come on, y'all,

1159
01:17:10,174 --> 01:17:11,539
Champagne!

1160
01:17:11,608 --> 01:17:15,203
Let's party, for real this time!

1161
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:17,679
We're off, everybody.

1162
01:17:22,019 --> 01:17:24,180
Ronnie, you ain't got
a hair on your ass

1163
01:17:24,254 --> 01:17:26,245
if you don't give it some gas!

1164
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:28,724
Look out.

1165
01:17:30,294 --> 01:17:33,559
Too fast, Uncle!
Uncle Ronnie, too fast!

1166
01:17:36,633 --> 01:17:38,726
Look out!

1167
01:17:43,874 --> 01:17:46,604
- That was a nasty right turn!
- You guys okay?

1168
01:17:46,677 --> 01:17:48,076
Y'all all right?

1169
01:17:48,145 --> 01:17:52,138
Uncle Ronnie,
you broke my special shoes!

1170
01:18:02,493 --> 01:18:04,859
Then he stole some tires.

1171
01:18:04,928 --> 01:18:07,362
He stole...

1172
01:18:10,467 --> 01:18:12,958
Shouldn't he be
coming up by now?

1173
01:18:15,172 --> 01:18:17,640
Go!

1174
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:30,943
This goat ate my shoes
and my shirt and my wallet

1175
01:18:31,021 --> 01:18:33,353
and my diamond rings and...

1176
01:18:37,694 --> 01:18:39,924
Goddamnit!

1177
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:49,234
Really? That's fabulous!

1178
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:07,056
Where's that ambulance at?

1179
01:19:07,124 --> 01:19:10,287
Can't catch me!

1180
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,660
Fuck! Jesus Christ!
Fuck! Troy!

1181
01:19:25,275 --> 01:19:28,335
She's a lying bitch, officer.
You can't trust a word she's saying.

1182
01:19:28,412 --> 01:19:30,277
Look at this stupid bitch!

1183
01:19:31,682 --> 01:19:34,116
Get her off of me!
She's an old lady!

1184
01:19:34,184 --> 01:19:35,583
What's wrong with you?

1185
01:19:37,521 --> 01:19:38,886
Let me go!

1186
01:19:38,956 --> 01:19:41,288
I want her fired.
I want her off the set.

1187
01:19:52,903 --> 01:19:54,768
It's called actig.

1188
01:23:39,696 --> 01:23:44,156
Well. There you have it...
the Ronnie Dobbs story.

1189
01:23:44,234 --> 01:23:49,035
from the bottom to the top
to the bottom and the back to the top.

1190
01:23:49,105 --> 01:23:51,573
Who wats to bet

1191
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:54,508
What a story!
What about me?

1192
01:23:54,578 --> 01:23:57,979
Well. Iook at me.
