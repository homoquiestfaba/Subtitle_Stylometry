No, I have not built it.

- This is it?
- [TESLA] It's Niagara Falls.

[WESTINGHOUSE] Yeah.

1030
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:01,200

I have pictured in my imagination

1031

1032
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,534
Did you know that when I first came
to this country, I worked for Mr. Edison?

1033
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:10,456
- I did not.
- Tea?

1034
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:12,078
Sure.

1035

I fixed two of his DC generators
in one night,

1036
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:18,033
and he called me a damn good man.

1037
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:21,241
So, why did he not treat me that way?

1038
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:24,496
I quit.
Tried my own company and was deceived.

Digging a ditch.

1041
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:35,455
The men laughed at my fine clothes,
but at the end of the day, I had $2.

1042
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:40,870
What was the ditch to be used for?

01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,615
Edison Electric.

1044
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,823
It felt like digging my own grave.

1045
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:52,406
If Mr. Edison succeeds, he will set us
back so far, we may never recover.

I have watched as the world talks
of Chicago as a symbol,

1049
01:16:00,042 --> 01:16:01,407

All cities will have light
in your lifetime,

that is to see our future.

Think beyond Chicago.

as food, as water, as air.

but Niagara is the proof

1060
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:33,369

from profit.

- Well, you don't.

But the fact is, Mr. Tesla,
I need your motor.

1064
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:49,905
I may be able to light up the Fair,
but I still can't move a machine.

1214
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:08,207
Why should we grant Westinghouse Electric
the contract for the World's Fair?

1215
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:12,956
Well, I guess because
our system works significantly better,

and, uh...

1217
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:19,579

is significantly cheaper.

01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,743
A true legacy
isn't what we build up to the heavens

01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:25,915
or carve deep into stone.

Rocks will crumble,

Only that
which isn't in the physical realm

1347
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,037
and reaches in both directions
can be eternal.

Our ideas.

1349
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,241
They are what we leave behind.

1350
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:52,120
And only they
are what can push us forward.
