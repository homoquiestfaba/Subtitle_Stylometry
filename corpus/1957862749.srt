in having an alarm clock

00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,438
if they're not gonna use it!

Now next time it'll be my belt.

17
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,836
Now you have 30 minutes
to get ready for school

18
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:50,585
or I'ma feed your breakfast to the dogs.

19
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,035
It's the first day of school!

20
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,294
You're suppose to be excited!

00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:55,115

Hmm, boys.

00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:06,523
(giggles)
(boys chattering)

26
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:07,356
(knocks)

27
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:08,728
Get dressed!

28
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:11,660
- [Child] Okay.
(chuckles)

29
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,700
- My boys.
- What the? (laughs)

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,940
My boys (laughs).

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,796
Okay lets take this picture.

32
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:21,814
Where's Dylan?

33
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:24,608
- It takes girls longer to get dressed.

34
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:27,158
- Yeah he needs to put on his makeup.

35
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,071
(boys laughing)

36
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,404
- Boys, be nice.

37
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:32,386
- You just take him back, he don't fit in.

38
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:34,026
- Elijah, stop it!

39
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:35,618
- He doesn't, he's gay.

40
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,247
- Michael you don't even
know what gay means.

41
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:40,674
Now shut up before I send you all back.

42
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:42,005
- Where?

43
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,176
- [Mom] To the home, now hush.

44
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:46,676
Dylan, Dylan baby, Dylan baby.

45
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:52,630
(gentle piano music)

46
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,880
(knocking)

47
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:57,771
Oh Dylan.

48
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:02,280
- Now they're gonna make fun of me

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,650
and say I look like a girl.

50
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,176
I hate my voice.

51
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:07,994
- Oh baby, you can't spend your whole life

52
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,376
afraid of what other people are gonna say.

53
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:13,707
How many times do I have
to tell you that, huh?

54
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:17,040
Baby, your voice is a blessing from God.

55
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,635
Now you wanna know something else?

56
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:20,593
- What?

57
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:23,234
- I love your voice the best.

58
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:26,766
- Really?
- (chuckles) Yep.

59
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:29,315
Now let's go take this
picture and get you on a bus.

60
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,148
- [Dylan] Okay.

61
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:32,156
- Okay, gimme a hug.

62
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,406
(laughing)

63
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:37,562
You are so silly.

64
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:41,595
(laughing) Go downstairs.

65
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,595
(sighs)

66
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:50,122
(camera clicking)
(gentle piano music)

67
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:04,059
David, your dinner's ready, baby.

68
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,925
- Mama, how did you deal with this?

69
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:11,495
- (exasperated sigh) I ask
myself that same question.

70
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:15,412
(laughing) Come on, let's eat.

71
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,314
- [David] Well I'm surprised
I'm the only one here.

72
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:21,023
- Well Dylan wanted to come,

73
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:24,163
but he had a show in London.

74
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,063
Xavier got a new job and
he needs the holiday pay

75
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:30,063
and well, Elijah was deployed again.

76
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,805
Mm, I worry about my baby Elijah,

77
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,252
Mm, off fighting that white man's war.

78
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,274
- Well, better that he
be serving the country

79
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:47,774
than serving time.

80
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:50,198
- Amen.

81
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:53,755
- What about Michael?

82
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,037
- Malachi is at Emani's family.

83
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:00,397
- (coughing) Malachi?

84
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:02,005
- David--
- You mean Michael?

85
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:04,047
Look, I'm not calling that
man Malachi just because

86
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:06,887
he decided to marry a woman
who turned him Muslim,

87
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:09,468
it doesn't mean you gotta
change your name for all that.

88
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:12,916
- David, you have to
respect the man's wishes.

89
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,246
- Respect the man's wishes?

90
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:17,716
How about he respect the
woman who adopted him

91
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,155
and come home for the holiday

92
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:20,355
that he can actually celebrate?

93
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:21,314
- We talk.

94
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:25,356
- No, I mean, when's the last
time you actually seen him?

95
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:26,189
- The wedding.

96
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,184
- Exactly, the wedding and
that was almost a year ago.

97
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,772
- But we talk though, okay?

98
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,172
And everybody's got their
own careers and families

99
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:35,282
and I get that.

100
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:37,515
- Yeah right, whatever.

101
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:40,003
They should still be here.

102
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:42,054
I mean you are our family.

103
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:47,054
Who else is gonna sacrifice
their life adopting five boys?

104
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,171
Ma, why you ain't doing
your cooking show no more?

105
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:55,903
- (clears throat) How's
that fellowship program?

106
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:56,921
- Come on, ma.

107
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,612
- David--
- Don't change the subject.

108
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:00,361
- David, how was your fellowship--

109
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,194
- Ma.

110
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:06,913
- Look, I've been busy
doing other things, okay?

111
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,034
Okay?

112
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:13,706
Now how's your fellowship program?

113
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,943
(sighs)

114
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,664
- It's almost over.

115
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:22,892
It's okay.

116
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:25,225
The trial didn't go so well.

117
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,826
- Mm.

118
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,441
- I mean, I'll just start
going to medical school

119
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:33,732
where I'll be actually saving lives.

120
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,153
- What about Megan?

121
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:36,521
How's she doing?

122
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,688
- We broke up.

123
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:41,463
Which is probably the
reason why she's not here.

124
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:42,721
- Oh Lord.

125
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,572
What was the fight about this time?

126
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:49,332
- (sighs) well um, she
wants to leave Atlanta.

127
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,165
- Mm?

128
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,761
- She wants to go to
a hospital in Seattle.

129
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,363
She's been keeping up
with this general surgeon

130
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:59,363
named Miranda Bailey, wants to
work for her diabetes trial.

131
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:03,472
- So what's wrong with Seattle?

132
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:04,363
- Seattle?

133
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,196
- Yeah.

134
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:09,021
- (laughing) Come on, ma, ain't
no black people in Seattle.

135
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,512
(laughs) Like, come on, you know that.

136
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:15,832
- David, why are you so
afraid to leave me, huh?

137
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,592
You went to Morehouse to stay close.

138
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:21,019
You went to Emery to stay close.

139
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,150
I think you should leave
Georgia for a while.

140
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,550
It'll be good for you.

141
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,333
And you love that girl.

142
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,523
(laughs sarcastically) There was one time

143
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:31,125
I thought you loved
her more than medicine.

144
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,512
And I think it'll be good for you

145
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,552
to go out there and support her.

146
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,780
And there's nothing
keeping you here but me.

147
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,123
- (laughs) What?

148
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:42,540
I have more here.

149
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:44,342
- [Angel] Oh really?

150
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:45,730
- Yeah really.

151
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,400
- [Angel] Like what?

152
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,771
- (sighs) I got friends.

153
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:53,354
- (laughing) What friends?

154
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,262
- I got friends.

155
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:59,931
- (laughing) oh stop lying.

156
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,062
- I do.
- Oh,

157
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,891
I can always tell when you are lying.

158
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,651
- I'm not lying.

159
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:07,880
Plus, I think I found someone.

160
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,713
- Oh.

161
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,639
You got you another girl.

162
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:14,341
- Oh, no.

163
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:17,609
No, not exactly.

164
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:19,808
Um--

165
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,249
- Wait a minute.

166
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,406
(sighs)

167
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:28,618
- No, don't, don't give
me that look, okay?

168
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:30,575
- Okay.
- Dylan is the gay son.

169
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,127
I'm not your gay son (laughs) okay?

170
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,495
That has nothing to do with this.

171
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,338
It's not that. (laughs)

172
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,171
Um,

173
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,141
no, I uh,

174
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,775
think I may have came
across some new information

175
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:48,025
about finding my birth mom.

176
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:51,400
- Oh.

177
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,027
Oh.

178
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:58,277
- Yeah, um, but I'm just curious, okay?

179
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,379
- Okay.

180
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,428
- I mean, being involved with this trial,

181
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:06,247
I just learned how this
disease is linked to genetics

182
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:10,839
and everybody else is talking
about their family history

183
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,679
and then they look at me and
I don't know how to react.

184
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,268
I don't know anything about my genetics.

185
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:18,546
I don't know if my mom was a diabetic.

186
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:20,199
I don't know if she's ever had a tumor.

187
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,532
I mean all of these questions, you know?

188
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,567
- Okay, so you find out.

189
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,234
Then how will that help you, hm?

190
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,217
- I don't know.

191
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:39,617
Maybe it'll tell me how
I'll die or something.

192
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:40,450
You know?

193
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,079
- (laughing) Oh, now
that is a pile of bull.

194
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:46,458
- I mean, come on, I mean listen,

195
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,367
if I find out who she
is, maybe I can find out

196
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,534
who my dad is.

197
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,119
Maybe I can find out if my hairline

198
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,247
is gonna be receding before 30.

199
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,472
I mean, you just never
really know, come on.

200
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:00,931
- (laughing) You are funny.

201
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:01,764
Mm.

202
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:10,952
- Doesn't mean I'm replacing
your or anything, okay?

203
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:11,962
If that's what you're thinking, okay?

204
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:14,072
- Well I know that.

205
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:17,061
Ain't no replacing me, baby. (laughs)

206
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:22,061
'Cause she ain't got nothing
on me, you hear? (laughs)

207
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:26,339
But you do that if
that's what you wanna do,

208
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,335
but you be careful.

209
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:36,025
And if you need me to help
you, just let me know.

210
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:36,858
- I will.

211
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:40,538
I promise you, I will.

212
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,378
- Oh, I am so glad to see you.

213
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:44,467
- Oh gosh.

214
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,918
(laughing)

215
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:49,335
I'm glad to see you too, mom.

216
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:52,481
- Eat up.

217
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:54,818
- Okay.

218
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,593
Here I go.

219
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:04,078
So, you're turning the big 50 this year.

220
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,023
- Yeah, 50.
(foil rattling)

221
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,745
- Are you not excited?

222
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,642
- Yeah. (laughs)

223
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:16,559
Yeah, I am.

224
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,802
- Okay, so what's the plan, ma?

225
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:26,684
- Well it's Christmas, so
it's gonna be the usual,

226
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:29,934
toy drive and dinner at the boy's home.

227
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,058
Why?

228
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:35,835
- You're turning 50.

229
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,724
It's time to, you know, it's
time to turn the fuck up!

230
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,272
- Oh, watch your mouth, boy.

231
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:44,587
- What? (laughing)

232
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:48,067
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, but I mean, we are.

233
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,936
Look, I'm running to the bathroom,

234
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:53,696
once I get back, we're
planning the biggest,

235
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:57,176
most spectacular birthday
party ever, okay?

236
00:10:57,176 --> 00:10:59,083
My mom's turning 50.

237
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,826
(claps) I don't know what
you thought this was.

238
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,296
(laughs)

239
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,827
- Woo, um, use the one upstairs,

240
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,586
the one in the hallway is broken, baby.

241
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:08,586
- [David] All right.

242
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:13,086
(coughing)
(gasping)

243
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,516
(gasping)

244
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:33,207
(coughs)
(clears throat)

245
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:38,207
(labored breathing)
(gentle piano music)

246
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:02,849
(water trickling)

247
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,371
- Did you wash your hands?

248
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:14,204
(water trickling)

249
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,794
- How long has it been back?

250
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,267
- (clears throat) What baby?

251
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:34,517
(bottle slaps counter)

252
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,488
- The cancer.

253
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,125
- David--

254
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,473
- How long, ma?

255
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:41,644
- Not too long.

256
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:43,384
- How far along are you in this treatment?

257
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:44,754
- I don't,

258
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:45,837
I don't know.

259
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:50,844
(exhales) I don't know.

260
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:55,511
(sniff) I don't know when it came back.

261
00:12:56,684 --> 00:13:01,017
They caught it a few weeks
ago in my blood work, so.

262
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:06,354
- Is this why you haven't
been doing your show?

263
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:07,187
- Yeah.

264
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:11,524
I've just been so tired.

265
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:14,804
(coughing)

266
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,732
- So what did they say?

267
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:25,695
You gotta do chemo again?

268
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,354
(sighs)

269
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,687
- It's bad this time, David.

270
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:35,489
- How bad, ma?

271
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:39,606
- It's everywhere.

272
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,781
It's in my blood.

273
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:46,111
It's in my bones.

274
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:52,445
(exhales)

275
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,862
It's just spreading too fast.

276
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,331
(slaps legs)

277
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:01,112
- What's next?

278
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:04,612
- No, I can't go through that again, baby.

279
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:09,731
- Oh man, that's the
only option, mom, we--

280
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,742
- No.

281
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:13,159
No, it's not the only option.

282
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:18,475
- So what you gonna do, huh?

283
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,982
What are you gonna do?

284
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:35,252
Just gonna sit here and die?

285
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:40,035
- Baby, sometimes you just
gotta know when it's time.

286
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,471
- What do you mean when it's time?

287
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,046
Man, you're 49 years old, dammit!

288
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,796
- Don't you curse me.

289
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:51,751
Now you don't know how
it felt to watch my boys

290
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:54,490
just fall apart because y'all

291
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,740
didn't know how to function without me.

292
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,762
(crying)

293
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,452
Baby, the pain that this
cancer has caused your hearts

294
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:13,339
is way worse than the pain
that it's made me feel.

295
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,373
No, and no matter what,
it's gonna keep coming back.

296
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:19,332
That girl down at the
church has has had cancer

297
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:21,332
seven times in 15 years.

298
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:27,061
Oh God, I just, I just don't
wanna spend the rest of my life

299
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:31,101
fighting something that is not curable.

300
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:33,934
(water trickling)

301
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:39,605
- So how long did they give you, huh?

302
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,186
- (crying) Six weeks.

303
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,789
Six beautiful weeks.

304
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:01,922
(sighs)

305
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:04,722
- When were you gonna tell me?

306
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:06,002
- I don't know.

307
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:07,631
- (slams counter) You don't know?

308
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:11,762
- Yes, I don't 'cause I
don't know how to pick up

309
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,931
the damn phone and tell
the people that I love

310
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,264
that I am dying.

311
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:20,359
How do you do that, huh?

312
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,498
How do you break everyone's heart, huh?

313
00:16:23,498 --> 00:16:25,959
You tell me the words.

314
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:26,792
Mmhmm.

315
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:30,129
It is better like this.

316
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:34,422
David this is my wish.

317
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:37,928
This is my last wish.

318
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,517
I just wanna enjoy the
time that I have left.

319
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:52,378
So see, you can get on that
plane and go to Seattle.

320
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,878
I'm gonna be okay.

321
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:55,927
- You know you can't expect me

322
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,639
to keep this from everybody, right?

323
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,722
- Oh, you have no choice.

324
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,749
(sniffs)

325
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:05,082
- Selfish woman.

326
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,458
This is selfish.

327
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,778
If they had any idea, they
would be here right now,

328
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:13,989
they would be here everyday!

329
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:16,166
- Yes, yes, they would be here everyday

330
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:20,229
falling apart and I
just cannot watch that.

331
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:21,949
- Well sometimes it's
not about what you want.

332
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:22,909
- Excuse me?

333
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:23,759
- Yeah.

334
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,778
We're gonna fall apart anyway

335
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,647
and that's something you're
just gonna have to deal with.

360
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:44,699
- Okay.

361
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:51,654
- Let me talk to the
oncologist at the hospital.

362
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:53,717
I just wanna make sure

363
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:57,341

367
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:19,261
just want us to have one last Christmas.

368
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,094

370
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,152

376
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,628

bougie ass wife, Faith.

380
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:09,475

381
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,725
- [David] Yes. (sighs)

382
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:17,089

383
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:23,784

I don't want everybody following me around

into my casket. (laughs)

387

00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:00,273
- I mean, I don't know.

415
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:04,013
I guess I'll just have to figure it out.

416
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:06,180
Isn't that what people do?

417
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:09,455
- Yeah, I guess.

418
00:24:11,544 --> 00:24:12,627
What's wrong?

419
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,173
- Why does something have to be wrong?

420
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:20,464

421
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:21,714
Something's up.

422
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,417
- My ma's cancer came back.

00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,341

424
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:42,017
- Damn.

425
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:46,240
Oh, you should bring her in.

426
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:50,717
- I can't, she's refusing treatment.

427
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:53,705
- What?

428
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:57,061
- I don't know.

429
00:24:58,342 --> 00:25:02,041
Probably shouldn't have said anything.

430
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:05,021
I promised her that I wouldn't.

431
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:07,104
- How long does she have?

432
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:09,611
- Six weeks.

433
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:12,921
- Six weeks?

434
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,127
David, she's so young.
- Yeah.

435
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,473
Yeah, I know.

436
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,088
I know, but listen, uh,

437
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,571
I need you to do me a favor, okay?

438
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,404
- What's up?

439
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,382
- I need you to come home
with me for Christmas.

440
00:25:33,382 --> 00:25:34,750
I mean, I want this Christmas

441
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,083
and I want her birthday to be so special

442
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:42,940
and I feel like after I'll
be able to convince her

443
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,607
to do the treatment.

444
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:51,782
- Then no problem, of course, of course.

445
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:54,153
Come here, come here.

- Come on, everyone out
her knows you're a crybaby,

451
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:30,585
but you are my crybaby.

452
00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:31,418
- Mmhmm.

00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:44,716
- Have you talked to your brother yet?

456
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:48,708
- No that's actually the
next thing on my list.

457
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:52,687
- It's nice to know I
was first on the list.

458
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:54,604
- Always, baby, always.

459
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,847
(soft gentle music)

460
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:14,064
- I'm gonna get back
inside, got a surgery,

461
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:19,350
but Christmas at Mama Angel's, all right,

462

it's gonna be great, it's gonna be great.

463
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,343
- Okay.

464
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:28,929
- Get your brothers home.

465
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:31,248
We'll talk more over dinner.

466
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,037
- All right.

- [Woman] How much for a pie?

473
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,570
- [Malachi] As-salamu alaykum,
my beautiful black sister,

474
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,321
it's gonna be $10.00 for a pie.

475
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,988
- [Woman] All right.

476
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,657
- [Malachi] All right--

477
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:28,838
- Thank you.
- There you go.

478
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,055
All right, as-salamu alaykum, my sister,

479
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:32,569
peace be onto you, okay?

480
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:35,486

brother, what's going on?

485
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:53,525
What's up, man?

486
00:28:54,812 --> 00:28:55,645
Hello?

487
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,863
(airplane engine humming)

488
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,051
- Yo bro, you know my name.

489
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:14,884

490
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,713

491
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:22,742
As-salamu alaykum, my beautiful
black brother, what's up?

492
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:25,569
- (sighs) What's up, brother?

493
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:26,851
- As-salamu alaykum.

494
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:27,971
- Look man, I ain't Muslim.

495
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:30,411
I ain't gotta say all that, okay?

496
00:29:30,411 --> 00:29:33,131
I'm just calling you 'cause I
need you home for Christmas.

497
00:29:33,131 --> 00:29:36,081
- Brah, you know I don't
celebrate Christmas, man.

498
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:39,923
- Look, it's not always about you, okay?

499
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:41,611
It's mama's 50th birthday and she's having

500
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:46,051
a birthday celebration,
man, I need you home.

501
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,190
Look, I know you don't
celebrate Christmas, all right,

502
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,082
so while everybody else
is saying merry Christmas,

503
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,282
all you gotta do is just say,
happy birthday, all right?

504
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:54,731
- Brah, if ma was having a
big party and everything,

505
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:57,203
why she didn't call me
herself and tell me?

506
00:29:57,203 --> 00:29:59,522
- 'Cause she didn't.

507
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:00,502
She wanted me to do it.

508
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:02,542
She need me to get everybody together.

509
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:06,182
So look, just tell your
wife, whatever you gotta do,

510
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:07,409
tell her it's just you and the kids,

511
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:08,782
y'all coming home for Christmas

512
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:10,782
and leave that woman
wherever the hell she at.

513
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:13,633
- (laughs) My brother, my brother,

514
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:17,502
why is there so much hatred
towards another brother's wife?

515
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:21,209
- All right man, all
right, I'm sorry, I get it.

516
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:22,462
Just bring everybody.

517
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:25,582
- Well, it would be good to see ma

518
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:27,782
and the kids been asking about her.

519
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:29,302
I'm sure they'll love to get their hands

520
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,289
on some of her banana pudding.

521
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,953
I might have to sell a few more bean pies

522
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:36,051
to make it happen, but we'll be there.

523
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,702
- All right, just do what
you gotta do to be here, man.

524
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:40,202
- All right, well,

525
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:42,116
damn.

526
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:46,603
(sighs)

527
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:49,603
Well peace be unto you too, brother.

528
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,563
Bean pies, get your bean pies.

00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:55,602

Let's do some ad-libs.

545
00:31:50,824 --> 00:31:52,453
- Yeah, yeah, I like how that felt.

546

- Hold on, let me take this real quick.

549
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:05,192
- [David] Yo.

550
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:06,344
- Hey, talk to me.

551
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:08,070
- [David] Dylan, what's good, superstar?

552
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,373
- Yo, what's good, bro?

553
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:10,824
How the doctor life treating you?

554
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:12,022
- [David] Everything's good, man,

555
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:14,144
everything's good with the
whole doctor position, man.

556
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:16,952
I can't thank you enough for
helping me out with that.

557
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:18,269
- Well you already know.

558
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,813
If my brother good, I'm
good, that's all that matter.

559
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:24,802
But where that sexy ass girl of yours at?

560
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,352
- [David] Hey man, she's around.

561
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:27,185
- All right.

562
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:28,983
Hey, you talk to her sister for me?

563
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:31,042
- Dylan, where is Jessie?

564
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:33,262
- I'ma take this out.

565
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:36,762
(distant traffic humming)

566
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,921
Man, I don't know what
you're talking about.

567
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:49,952
- [David] Jessie, your boyfriend?

568
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:53,744
- (laughs) Man, you know
I ain't got one of those.

569
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:55,709
- I mean, come on, what happened now?

570
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:57,453
I thought he was the one.

571
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:59,352
- Jessie wanted a fairytale

572
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,023
and I'm a mainstream R and B singer.

573
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,150
My name is not Frank Ocean.

574
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,317
- Oh, I see, I see, I see.

575
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:08,739
So he wanted you to come out.

576
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:10,853
- All that and more, man.

577
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:13,581
This nigger saw Gucci
and Keisha wedding on BT

578
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:16,930
and then talked about starting
a reality show of his own.

579
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,001
Said it'll help him start
his acting career out.

580
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:20,001
Selfish ass.

581
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:23,402
- Damn man, I'm sorry to hear that.

582
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,471
- No, it's good.

583
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,621
I'm just gonna find me
a wife and settle down.

584
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:29,570
- Yeah well um, before you do that,

585
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,241
I do need you to come home for Christmas.

586
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:33,649
- No can do, bro.

587
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:34,552
- What do you mean?

588
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:37,101
- (sighs) I got this Christmas
concert in South Africa

589
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,472
for a bunch of group home kids.

590
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:40,872
You know, a bunch of nappy headed kids

591
00:33:40,872 --> 00:33:42,761
trying to get adopted like you and me.

592
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:44,001
I can't cancel on 'em.

593
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:45,730
- Well look man, ma was
really looking forward

594
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,647
to having us all there.

595
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,130
You know she's really
gonna be disappointed.

596
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,341
- Yeah, but mom's gonna
understand, bro, she know my heart.

597
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:58,481
But eh, look, I gotta head
back into the session.

598
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:00,530
(sighs) Maybe I'll try
to figure something out,

599
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,272
maybe come a couple of
days after Christmas.

600
00:34:03,272 --> 00:34:04,689
- All right, man.

601
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:10,961
(sighs) Just let me know
what you can do, all right?

602
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,308
- Yeah, fo' sho.

603
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:13,141
- Bye.

604
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:19,401
(sighs loudly)

605
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:22,401
All right, well, that's one and one.

606
00:34:25,988 --> 00:34:28,821
(singing happily)

607
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:32,257
(sighs)

608
00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:37,566
Come on David, get it
together, get it together.

609
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:41,706
(phone rings)

610
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:47,995
(singing happily)

611
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:52,856
- (laughs) 'Bout time your
punk ass call me back.

612
00:34:52,856 --> 00:34:54,523
- Xavier, what's good?

613
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:55,795
- Shit man, nothing much,

614
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:57,755
just trying to make it to the next day.

615
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:58,944
- Look um, I'm just calling you.

616
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:03,414
I need you uh, I need you
home for Christmas, man.

617
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:06,664
Well, mom needs you home for Christmas.

618
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:09,594
- For what?

619
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:11,628
- It's Christmas, man, what do you mean.

620
00:35:11,628 --> 00:35:13,507
- (laughs) Man, I can't
go back to Georgia.

621
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:15,507
Shit, I'm behind on child support.

622
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:16,896
- Child support?

623
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:18,146
- Yeah, $3,500.

624
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:20,318
They catch me down there,

625
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,987
they trowing my black ass back in jail.

626
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,451
- Why haven't you been
paying child support?

627
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:27,782
- 'Cause I got a lot of damn kids.

628
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:29,262
Shit man, I'm out here struggling,

629
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:33,010
but you know, I'm just
doing the best I can.

630
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,054
- Look man, yeah, I get
it, I get it, but um,

631
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,783
I really need you home.

632
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,373
- I can't.

633
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:42,388
You know, all this money I'm making,

634
00:35:42,388 --> 00:35:46,234
just trying to save up so my
kids can have a good holiday.

635
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:47,483
(laughs) If I come home,

636
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:49,164
it's gonna be one ugly ass Christmas.

637
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:51,747
- Zav, you gotta get home, man.

638
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:55,211
- Something going on with ma?

639
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:56,384
- No, not exactly.

640
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:57,874
- What you mean, not exactly?

641
00:35:57,874 --> 00:36:01,173
- All I can really say is
man, she really needs us.

642
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:02,643
- Is it that bad?

643
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:03,476
- Yeah.

644
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:05,634
- All right brah.

645
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:07,175
Hey, don't tell nobody I'm coming home.

646
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:08,744
I gotta keep a low profile.

647
00:36:08,744 --> 00:36:10,805
- All right, man.

648
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:12,154
I'll talk to you later.

649
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:14,071
- All right, man, yeah.

650
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,834
Merry fuckin' Christmas.

651
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,137
Fuck.

652
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:27,615
They bought to lock me up and
throw away the fucking key.

653
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:28,448
Shit.

654
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:35,212
(plan engine humming)

655
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:39,776
- Yo, big bro, what's happening?

656
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:43,695
- (laughs) What's up, Elijah?

657
00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:47,114
- (laughs) Man, just, you know,

658
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:49,325
out here fighting this
war man, keeping you safe.

659
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:50,914
You know what I'm saying, 'cause you soft.

660
00:36:50,914 --> 00:36:52,010
- Come on, man.

661
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,139
(laughs)

662
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:54,310
Why you gotta be a punk?

663
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,601
- Yeah man.

664
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:56,651
- Look man, I'm just excited

665
00:36:56,651 --> 00:37:00,099
to have you home for Christmas
man, it's been too long.

666
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:00,932
- What?

667
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,059
No, I ain't gonna be home for Christmas.

668
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,571
- What do you mean?

669
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:13,401
It's Christmas, momma's
birthday, Atlanta, home.

670
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:14,568
- No, ain't nobody say nothing to me

671
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,370
about coming home for Christmas, man.

672
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,953
- Ah, come on, man.

673
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:21,613
What you mean, you gotta put in for it.

674
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:24,542
You can't miss out on this one.

675
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,573
It's momma's 50th birthday celebration.

676
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:28,982
Everybody's gonna be there.

677
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:30,494
- Oh damn.

678
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:31,974
- You can't miss out, man.

679
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:33,474
- It is ma's 50th.

680
00:37:35,193 --> 00:37:39,013
I mean, yeah man, it
ain't gonna happen, man

681
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:41,930
'cause I didn't ask for leave, man.

682
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:46,844
I mean, I could try man, I can see,

683
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:48,614
but you know, they mainly give priority

684
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,673
to the people with wives
and stuff like that, man--

685
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:53,044
- Well can you at least try?

686
00:37:53,044 --> 00:37:55,164
(sighs)

687
00:37:55,164 --> 00:37:57,164
- It ain't looking good.

688
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:02,222
- You gotta pull it through, man.

689
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:03,124
It's been too long.

690
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:04,707
It's time for you and momma,

691
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:06,118
it's time for y'all to make up.

692
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,488
- Did she say that?

693
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:10,738
- Yeah man, she misses you.

694
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:16,968
- Yeah, I miss her, man.

695
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:20,476
All right, fuck it, I'm
gonna try for mama, man.

696
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:21,309
- Well you know what you gotta do?

697
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:22,262
- I'm gonna see what I can do.

698
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:24,982
I'm gonna do the best I can.

699
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:28,081
- (laughs) All right, man,
I'll hit you up later, man.

700
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,498
I love you, brah.

701
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:32,212
- Oh, there you go with that lovey stuff,

702
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:33,841
man, you soft, man.

703
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:35,222
You gotta remember, I'm
not the gay brother.

704
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:37,215
- See that's what I'm saying,
man, you don't love me, brah.

705
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,975
- (laughs) All right,
man, I'll hit you later.

706
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:40,808
- Bye.

707
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:48,105
(exhales) That's two and a possibility.

708
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:51,944
(sighs) Lord,

709
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:59,775
I know you wanna call her home. (sighs)

710
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:03,890
But I need her, we need her.

711
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:13,591
If you can just help me get

- Yeah what's up, why you stop the track?

721
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,837

(sighs) Oh man.

728
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:10,688
- This just in,

729
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:14,616
a sex tape has been
leaked of singer, Dylan

730
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:17,087
and it's not with a woman.

731
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:20,696
There has always been speculation
about Dylan's sexuality

732
00:40:20,696 --> 00:40:25,048
and his close relationship
with his assistant, Jessie.

733
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,787
Yeah, that's right, ladies,

734
00:40:26,787 --> 00:40:31,447
your favorite sexy idol
is not checking for you.

735
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:32,816
It seems all those years,

736
00:40:32,816 --> 00:40:35,256
doing all those videos
with beautiful women,

737
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:37,923
guess what, they were all a lie.

738
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:43,451
It's 2019, who is afraid
to be labeled gay nowadays?

739
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:48,896
It seems Frank Ocean
busted that door wide open.

740
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:52,908
- [Brooklyn] Babe, turn
it to channel five.

741
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,355
- For what, baby, I'm playing the game.

742
00:40:54,355 --> 00:40:56,008
- Your brother, Dylan is on the news.

743
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:57,508
- Fuck Dylan.

744
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:59,749
(sighs)

745
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:00,836
- Xavier--
- What the fuck?

746
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:02,579
- This is serious.

747
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,588
- But the question still remains,

748
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:09,588
how could you lie to all your
fans for that length of time?

749
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:13,388
That's the question these
ladies wanna know the answer to.

750
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,468
And the sex tape, (chuckles) wow.

751
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:19,208
There were things done in that sex tape

752
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,548
that screamed professional gay, not just,

753
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:26,270
baby, I apologize, I got caught
up in the moment type thing.

754

There were things done on that sex tape

755
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:30,688

finally came out the closet.

What am I supposed to do after that?

832
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:38,073

833
00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:39,783
You're gonna have to face it.

834

truth and stand tall in it

00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:15,490
so that they can find the
strength to do the same thing.

846
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,490
- If you say so.

847
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,233
I just wish somebody
would stand up for me.

848
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:23,066
- Oh no, now, you've got
to stand on your own.

But those of us that love you,

850

- I'm gonna start it
because I wanna make sure

889
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:09,608
you don't forget why
I agreed to come here.

890
00:48:09,608 --> 00:48:13,691
- Look, okay, I'm not
leaving my kids here, okay?

891
00:48:14,608 --> 00:48:18,637
That's not gonna happen, so
you might as well get over it.

892
00:48:18,637 --> 00:48:22,128
- No, I'm not gonna get over it.

893
00:48:22,128 --> 00:48:26,045
I can't play stepmom to
that dead woman's kids.

894
00:48:27,974 --> 00:48:30,934
They are destroying our marriage.

895
00:48:30,934 --> 00:48:34,184
Please, now Angel took all the boys in.

896
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:41,306
I'm sure she won't mind,
you know, taking your kids.

897
00:48:41,306 --> 00:48:43,986
(sighs)
And besides,

898
00:48:43,986 --> 00:48:46,986
I'm sure that she needs the company.

899
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:52,455
Now, either you talk to her or I will,

900
00:48:54,816 --> 00:48:58,816
but I will not leave this
house with those boys.

901
00:49:01,426 --> 00:49:03,534
(sighs)

902
00:49:03,534 --> 00:49:06,186
- Oh my God. (sighing)

903
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:08,769
Why? (exhales)

904
00:49:12,226 --> 00:49:14,476
(grunting)

905
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:21,456
(laughing) There you go, Davey.

906
00:49:21,456 --> 00:49:24,997
- (laughs) Micheal.

907
00:49:24,997 --> 00:49:27,888
You know I'm not calling you Malachi.

908
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:28,888
- [Malachi] Whatever, man.

909
00:49:28,888 --> 00:49:30,317
- How are you, Malachi?

910
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:31,906
- (laughs) And how are you doing,

911
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:35,288
my beautiful black, my beautiful queen?

912
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:39,374
- (laughs) You know, I was
good, but now I'm great.

913
00:49:39,374 --> 00:49:40,456
- Amazing.

914
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:43,266
(laughs)

915
00:49:43,266 --> 00:49:44,389
- [Megan] I'll see you inside, okay?

916
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:45,389
- All right.

917
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:51,738
Hey brah, man, why you
gotta be so difficult, huh?

918
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,149
- What you mean, man?

919
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:55,720
I don't really see it that way.

920
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,497
I mean when you so used to calling a man

921
00:49:57,497 --> 00:49:59,568
by one name your entire life,

922
00:49:59,568 --> 00:50:01,368
all of a sudden you
call him by another name

923
00:50:01,368 --> 00:50:04,629
just because his bougie
ass wife told him to?

924
00:50:04,629 --> 00:50:05,698
Doesn't work like that.

925
00:50:05,698 --> 00:50:07,942
- Well, all right, whatever well,

926
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:11,142
I see somebody still is
afraid to put a ring on it.

927
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:12,612
(laughs)
but you know what?

928
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:14,372
I understand because it takes a real man

929
00:50:14,372 --> 00:50:17,604
to step up to the plate. (laughs)

930
00:50:17,604 --> 00:50:22,604
Oh, snap, look at this,
pretty boy Zay. (laughs)

931
00:50:24,244 --> 00:50:26,221
You mean to tell me that this dude

932
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:28,113
stepped away from his player's life

933
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:31,044
long enough to come and
spend Christmas with us?

934
00:50:31,044 --> 00:50:33,422
Brah, how did you make that happen?

935
00:50:33,422 --> 00:50:34,804
- Hey man, come on, that's my brother.

936
00:50:34,804 --> 00:50:36,372
Leave him alone, okay?

937
00:50:36,372 --> 00:50:38,872
- You know I heard you, right?

938
00:50:40,764 --> 00:50:42,092
- He's a changed man now.

939
00:50:42,092 --> 00:50:46,742
- (laughs) Yeah, still
good at changing women.

940
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:47,575
What, no.

941
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:50,924
This dude opening doors for women now?

942
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:52,501
(laughs)
Hot damn,

943
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:54,372
pigs must be flying.

944
00:50:54,372 --> 00:50:57,122
- Very funny, fake ass Malcolm X.

945
00:51:08,128 --> 00:51:10,809
(chuckling)
- Oh man.

946
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,441
- Okay, what's up, brah?

947
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:15,068
- What's going on, Zay? (laughs)

948
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:16,117
- I'm doing good man,

949
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:18,777
long as you don't sell me none
of them stale ass bean pies.

950
00:51:18,777 --> 00:51:20,260
- [Malachi] Well, whatever, brah.

951
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,558
- (laughing) He got your game, brah.

952
00:51:22,558 --> 00:51:24,209
- Whatever, both of y'all hush.

953
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,446
Oh man.

954
00:51:25,446 --> 00:51:28,529
- Hey, baby, this is my brother David

955
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:33,659
and that here is Michael, aka, Malachi,

956
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:39,386
aka Louis Farrakhan's bastard lost child.

957
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:45,607
- [Malachi] Whatever man, how
you doing by beautiful black,

958
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,148
(laughs) come on, man,

959
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:49,460
let me greet your beautiful woman here.

960
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,209
How you doing my beautiful Nubian goddess.

961
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:56,568
So good to meet you.
- You too.

962
00:51:56,568 --> 00:51:59,997
- Brah, why must I have
so much hate in thy spirit

963
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:04,997
when you have such a beautiful
Nubian goddess by your side?

964
00:52:05,191 --> 00:52:07,143
- Gosh, it's overkill at this point, Mike,

965
00:52:07,143 --> 00:52:08,372
cut it out, dude.
- All right, man,

966
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:10,863
where is everybody at, man?

967
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:14,613
- Everybody's inside,
man, except for Elijah.

968
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:17,771
- All right, well come on baby, let's go.

969
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:20,251
I'm going inside before I
get converted to a Muslim.

970
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:22,531
(laughing)
Come on.

971
00:52:22,531 --> 00:52:26,452
- All right. (laughs)

972
00:52:26,452 --> 00:52:27,619
You okay, bro?

973
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:32,400
- No, I'm not okay.

974
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,350
My life is in a million pieces.

975
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:40,206
- You'll be fine, you just gotta
let shit smooth over, okay?

976
00:52:40,206 --> 00:52:42,634
I mean Kevin Hart cheated on his wife.

977
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:44,755
R. Kelly had people
trapped in the basement

978
00:52:44,755 --> 00:52:46,524
and Usher gave all his groupies herpes

979
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:47,708
and they all bounced back.

980
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:49,191
- Yeah, you're right.

981
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:50,577
- Yeah.
- Right,

982
00:52:50,577 --> 00:52:54,322
I just don't know how
to handle it, you know?

983
00:52:54,322 --> 00:52:57,704
- I mean shit man, can't
do what you been doing.

984
00:52:57,704 --> 00:52:59,893
Keep sucking and sucking--
- Xavier.

985
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:02,122
(laughing)

986
00:53:02,122 --> 00:53:04,954
- It's like a shit man, look, listen,

987
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:07,292
look at it like this,

988
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,058
you don't have to sing
about women anymore,

989
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:11,172
you could start singing about men.

990
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:12,082
You know what I'm saying?

991
00:53:12,082 --> 00:53:13,584
You ain't gotta act no more, brah,

992
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:16,173
start living your truth,
the faggot that you are.

993
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:18,194
(laughing) Shit, you know what I'm sayin'?

994
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:20,181
- Yeah, I might be a faggot,
but I'll whip your ass.

995
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:21,099
- Try it here.

996
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:22,881
- Hey y'all come on, chill out, all right?

997
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:24,863
- Fellahs--
- Relax.

998
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,030
(sighing)

999
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,742
- [Angel] What's going on up there?

1000
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,075
- [Dylan] Momma.

1001
00:53:34,153 --> 00:53:36,503
- Yeah, we're fine, all right?

1002
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:38,967
Just happy to see each other.
- Yeah.

1003
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:40,221
- [Angel] Dinner's ready.

1004
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:42,512
Wash your hands and come on down.

1005
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:43,832
- [Xavier] All right momma, I'm coming.

1006
00:53:43,832 --> 00:53:46,749
Shit, I wanna try your food anyway.

1007
00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:49,757
Okay ma.

1008
00:53:49,757 --> 00:53:50,590
- I'm gonna whoop his ass.

1009
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:53,129
I'm not playing that shit today.

1010
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:54,879
- You don't have to do
all of that, all right?

1011
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:56,659
There's no need for violence.

1012
00:53:56,659 --> 00:53:59,139
Can we all just get along for mama please?

1013
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:03,218
- We are non-violent with those
who are non-violent with us.

1014
00:54:03,218 --> 00:54:06,468
- Nigger, did you just quote Malcolm X?

1015
00:54:08,176 --> 00:54:11,203
- Come on, let's go eat
before the great menace,

1016
00:54:11,203 --> 00:54:14,243
Malachi starts to speak in tongues.

1017
00:54:14,243 --> 00:54:17,053
- Muslims don't speak in tongues, brah.

1018
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:17,886

- Really?

1032
00:55:08,357 --> 00:55:11,606
For the nine months that
I carried your black ass

1033
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:16,019
growing inside of me, and
for the 18 hours of labor,

1034
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,328
I can call you whatever the
hell I want to call you.

1035
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:20,495
- Yes ma, yes.

1036
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:25,366
- Now, Angel is having
a 50th birthday party

1037
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:30,126
which means her sons are gonna be in town,

1038
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,206
which means there will be distractions

1039
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:35,347
for you to get in and steal the recipes.

1040
00:55:35,347 --> 00:55:37,247
- Mom, why don't you just
ask her for the recipe--

1041
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:38,497
- Son, shut up.

1042
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:44,118
I've waited 20 long years for
that banana pudding recipe.

1043
00:55:45,248 --> 00:55:47,827
So you wanna know what
I want for Christmas?

1044
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:48,744
- What mom?

1045
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,699
A man?

1046
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:52,227
- Really Bart?

1047
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:54,739
Does it look like I need a goddam man?

1048
00:55:54,739 --> 00:55:57,887
- (sighs) Okay mom, the recipe book.

1049
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,304
- So, you listen,

1050
00:56:00,547 --> 00:56:05,047
you and that dumb ass sidekick
of yours devise a plan,

1051
00:56:08,325 --> 00:56:09,968
make it happen.

1052
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:12,908
- I'm more like a best
friend, not a sidekick.

1053
00:56:12,908 --> 00:56:16,070
- Who told your dumb fat ass to talk?

1054
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:19,070
Both of y'all, get your asses out my face.

1055
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,240
(laughing)

1056
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,160
- So Xavier how's your
car repair business going?

1057
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,308
- It's going pretty good, mama.

1058
00:56:27,308 --> 00:56:29,625
- So that mean you making a
lot of money then, brah, huh?

1059
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:32,385
- Yeah, you know, everything
going pretty good, bro.

1060
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:33,433
- I hope it's going good enough for you

1061
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:35,273
to start to pay your child support

1062
00:56:35,273 --> 00:56:36,849
and take care of your seven kids.

1063
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:39,084
He told you he got seven kids, right?

1064
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:41,905
- She knows how many
kids I have, all right?

1065
00:56:41,905 --> 00:56:45,073
Now you know, maybe I
should hire you a publicist

1066
00:56:45,073 --> 00:56:46,654
to save your little music career?

1067
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:49,404
- Uh boys, can we please act your age?

1068
00:56:49,404 --> 00:56:50,933
- He started it.

1069
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:52,933
(sighs)

1070
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:54,054
- Malachi, how are the boys

1071
00:56:54,054 --> 00:56:56,212
adjusting to their new school, huh?

1072
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,673
- Mm, things are fine.

1073
00:56:58,673 --> 00:56:59,884
- They could be better--

1074
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:02,103
- Things are fine.

1075
00:57:02,103 --> 00:57:05,025
The boys, they love their new school.

1076
00:57:05,025 --> 00:57:07,625
- I mean, they're getting so big.

1077
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:10,233
I'm just glad they're doing
okay after they lost their mom.

1078
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:12,494
(people agreeing)

1079
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:15,185
- Yeah, the boys, you
know, they understand

1080
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:18,852
that she's in a better
place, you know, they get it.

1081
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,654
- Just glad they were able
to spend some time with her

1082
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:22,894
before she passed.

1083
00:57:22,894 --> 00:57:24,534
I mean, just imagine

1084
00:57:24,534 --> 00:57:27,233
what it would be like
if she were to pass away

1085
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:29,625
and nobody got a chance to say goodbye.

1086
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:33,208
- Um, yeah, Megan, I
just love your blouse.

1087
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:38,273
- Oh, (clears throat) (laughs)
why thank you, Mama Angel.

1088
00:57:38,273 --> 00:57:40,363
- Yeah, the earrings are lovely too.

1089
00:57:40,363 --> 00:57:41,196
- [Megan] Thanks.

1090
00:57:41,196 --> 00:57:43,065
- Yeah. (laughs)

1091
00:57:43,065 --> 00:57:45,732
Yeah you know, maybe you
should let Dylan here

1092
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:48,633
borrow them for his new
album cover, Tinker Bell.

1093
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:50,204
(people laughing)
- Xavier.

1094
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:51,553
- Yeah, I could use a little extra money

1095
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,964
to take care of your un-fathered children.

1096
00:57:53,964 --> 00:57:56,494
Well hey, Brooklyn, if you ever get tired

1097
00:57:56,494 --> 00:57:58,473
of being with him, all you
gotta do is get pregnant.

1098
00:57:58,473 --> 00:57:59,790
I'm sure he'll run away then.

1099
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,348
- Oh, don't come for my man.

1100
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:03,754
- I'm just letting you
know the truth, that's it.

1101
00:58:03,754 --> 00:58:05,587
- Okay, be quiet, eat.

1102
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:11,703

slip in and try to get

1111
00:58:34,263 --> 00:58:36,583
sounds like a merry good idea.

(labored breathing) And you know mama

1115
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:42,592
wanted this recipe book.

1116

You better not fuck this
Christmas up for me!

1117

♪ You're a monster, Mr. Grinch ♪

1120
00:58:53,424 --> 00:58:55,508
- The strongest level of brotherhood

1121
00:58:55,508 --> 00:58:58,687
is a sense of community, friendship

1122
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,838
and a common purpose in
Islam for the sake of Allah.

1123
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,980
Now, the Koran teaches us

1124
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,958
that we should avoid harming each other.

1125
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:09,020
We should be generous to one another

1126
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,988
and we also should behave
in the best manner.

1127
00:59:11,988 --> 00:59:14,028
- Mm, beautiful words, baby.

1128
00:59:14,028 --> 00:59:14,861
- [Malachi] Thank you, mama.

1129
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:17,088
- And the Bible say something similar.

1130
00:59:17,088 --> 00:59:19,171
In Romans 12:10, it says,

1131
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:23,938
be devoted to one
another in brotherly love

1132
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:26,687
and preference one another in honor.

1133
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:30,187
- Angel, how do you feel about two Muslims

1134
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:36,889
raising children that don't
know Allah, but know Jesus?

1135
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:39,588
- Well, I mean, I think there are

1136
00:59:39,588 --> 00:59:42,580
many inter-religious households out there,

1137
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,809
but as long as you
believe in a higher being

1138
00:59:45,809 --> 00:59:49,918
and have guiding values,
I believe it could work.

1139
00:59:49,918 --> 00:59:52,588
However, I gave my boys
the freedom to choose

1140
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:55,247
whatever religion they wanted to.

1141
00:59:55,247 --> 00:59:56,609
- So you were flexible?

1142
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:57,958
- Yeah.

1143
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:00,828
My babies came from all
different walks of life

1144
01:00:00,828 --> 01:00:02,447
and I felt that it was important

1145
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:05,769
for them to hold on to
whatever was important to them.

1146
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,602
- Hm.

1147
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,700
So do you feel that the lack
of a strong religious structure

1148
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:17,980
had a negative outcome
on their relationships?

1149
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,249
(clears throat)

1150
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:22,357
- Mama, damn, what did
you put in this pie?

1151
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:23,628
This thing is good.

1152
01:00:23,628 --> 01:00:25,148
- Mama, this pie is delicious.

1153
01:00:25,148 --> 01:00:26,398
(people agreeing)

1154
01:00:26,398 --> 01:00:27,380
You know what?

1155
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,487
I think I'm gonna have me another piece.

1156
01:00:28,487 --> 01:00:31,478
Better yet, you should cook
this on your next episode.

1157
01:00:31,478 --> 01:00:33,038
- Maybe I should.

1158
01:00:33,038 --> 01:00:34,487
Now Emani, back to your question--

1159
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:35,687
- Mm, matter of fact, you know what?

1160
01:00:35,687 --> 01:00:37,518
You should do a Christmas special.

1161
01:00:37,518 --> 01:00:38,647
That's what you should do.

1162
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:41,358
- Yeah, that's a great idea, son.

1163
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:43,198
Now Emani, like I was about to say--

1164
01:00:43,198 --> 01:00:44,758
(doorbell rings)

1165
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:47,289
Oh, I wasn't expecting anyone.

1166
01:00:47,289 --> 01:00:48,828
Excuse me.

1167
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:51,740
(whispering)
- Don't start this now.

1168
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:56,740
(arguing quietly)
(doorbell rings)

1169
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:03,980
- [Angel] Oh, why Charisse,
what brings you here?

1170
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,111
- I'm here 'cause I'm bringing her here.

1171
01:01:07,111 --> 01:01:09,877
I heard her daddy was in town

1172
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:13,627
and what he's not gonna do is continue

1173
01:01:13,627 --> 01:01:16,710
to act as if my child does not exist.

1174
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:21,148
So what I'm gonna need for
you to do is go on inside

1175
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:24,175
and tell him to bring his black ass out

1176
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:26,828
'cause he's got about 13 years

1177
01:01:26,828 --> 01:01:29,076
worth of Christmas gifts that he owe us.

1178
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:30,096
- Now this is not--

1179
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:32,929
- First of all, don't Charisse me.

1180
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:34,929
Xavier!

1181
01:01:35,885 --> 01:01:40,420
Get yo' black ass out here
because I know you in there!

1182
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,948
- Okay, let's be reasonable about this.

1183
01:01:42,948 --> 01:01:44,290
There's a child involved.

1184
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,540
(laughing)

1185
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:50,498
- Let me tell you what reasonable is,

1186
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,915
reasonable is a grown ass man

1187
01:01:55,268 --> 01:01:57,998
taking care of his own child

1188
01:01:57,998 --> 01:02:00,665
even if he's a broke ass nigger.

1189
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:06,410
He still need to have
some type of presence

1190
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,860
in his own child's life.

1191
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,158
My daughter is becoming a teenager.

1192
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:13,278
She needs her father.

1193
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:17,445
- This is not the way to
do things, not like this.

1194
01:02:18,348 --> 01:02:20,453
- I'm sorry, what is it that
you're not understanding

1195
01:02:20,453 --> 01:02:23,651
'cause I've been trying for years, okay?

1196
01:02:23,651 --> 01:02:27,512
Now Miss Angel, I understand
that that fool of yours

1197
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:32,512
is your son, but I ain't never
took you to be no dumb bitch.

1198
01:02:33,773 --> 01:02:34,903
- Dumb bitch?

1199
01:02:34,903 --> 01:02:36,666
- Hey man, don't you come
talking to my mama like that.

1200
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:38,434
You tripping, tripping.

1201
01:02:38,434 --> 01:02:39,306
- Daddy.

1202
01:02:39,306 --> 01:02:41,714
- I told you. (laughs)

1203
01:02:41,714 --> 01:02:44,346
Okay, this is what I'm gonna do,

1204
01:02:44,346 --> 01:02:47,546
I'm gonna leave her here for
a reasonable amount of time

1205
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:48,796
with that fool.

1206
01:02:50,346 --> 01:02:54,394
Um sweetie, Zooey, you wanted your daddy.

1207
01:02:54,394 --> 01:02:56,764
There his big ass is, okay, boo?

1208
01:02:56,764 --> 01:02:57,856
I'm out, all right?

1209
01:02:57,856 --> 01:02:59,734
- [Zooey] But ma, I would--

1210
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,893
- Don't but ma me, okay?

1211
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:04,016
You already got your Christmas gift early.

1212
01:03:04,016 --> 01:03:05,226
I'm out.

1213
01:03:05,226 --> 01:03:07,726
Bye. (laughs)

1214
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,409
I'm out!

1215
01:03:16,914 --> 01:03:21,747

1216
01:03:23,506 --> 01:03:24,794
You hungry, baby?

1217
01:03:24,794 --> 01:03:26,365
- Not really, I just ate.

1218
01:03:26,365 --> 01:03:29,805
- Okay, well, let's get
you settled in upstairs.

1219
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:32,712
You must be tired after that long drive.

1220
01:03:32,712 --> 01:03:34,734
(sighs) Come on.

1221
01:03:34,734 --> 01:03:36,901
- Uh, bro, you need to go.

1222
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:39,794
- Go where?

1223
01:03:39,794 --> 01:03:42,961
- Go check on your daughter, dumb ass.

1224
01:03:49,176 --> 01:03:51,154
(sighs)

1225
01:03:51,154 --> 01:03:54,354
(slow walking footsteps)

1226
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:56,474
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

1227
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:58,056
They got a lot of shit going on.

1228
01:03:58,056 --> 01:04:01,925
- Well damn, there's a
lot of people in there.

1229
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:04,746
(exasperated breath) Let me think.

1230
01:04:04,746 --> 01:04:06,244
Let me think.

1231
01:04:06,244 --> 01:04:07,914
I think we should come
back during the party.

01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:08,747
- Right.

1233
01:04:09,586 --> 01:04:11,384
- 'Cause they'll be distracted.

1234
01:04:11,384 --> 01:04:13,354
It'll be a good way to get in.

1235
01:04:13,354 --> 01:04:15,525
(labored breathing) Now let's go.

1236
01:04:15,525 --> 01:04:16,807
- Which way?

1237
01:04:16,807 --> 01:04:20,640
- Down there.
(bells jingling)

1238
01:04:24,325 --> 01:04:26,066
(sighs)

1239
01:04:26,066 --> 01:04:29,466
- I am so sorry we had to meet like this.

1240
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:32,125
- It's not your fault.

1241
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,845
- Are you okay?

1242
01:04:33,845 --> 01:04:35,465
- I guess so.

1243
01:04:35,465 --> 01:04:38,125
I wanted to meet him,
maybe ask a few questions,

1244
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,774
but not be dropped off.

1245
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:41,925
- Yeah, I understand that.

1246
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:46,925
(laughs) Well I hate we had
to wait this long to meet, hm?

1247
01:04:48,765 --> 01:04:49,598
Oh.

1248
01:04:50,523 --> 01:04:53,356
- I should be the one apologizing,

1249
01:04:54,377 --> 01:04:55,760
not you, mama.

1250
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,510
- Oh well, I'll let you two talk.

1251
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:00,993
Okay.

1252
01:05:17,491 --> 01:05:19,574
- Why didn't you want me?

1253
01:05:20,962 --> 01:05:22,192
- Huh?

1254
01:05:22,192 --> 01:05:25,352
- After all these years,
you never came to see me.

1255
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:28,019
No birthday gifts, no Christmas.

1256
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:35,189
- I never meant to let so much time go by.

1257
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:41,338
See, when you was a baby,
I got into some trouble.

1258
01:05:42,741 --> 01:05:45,573
I got put away for some time.

1259
01:05:45,573 --> 01:05:46,906
- How much time?

1260
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:50,650
- Seven years.

1261
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:53,221
- For what?

1262
01:05:53,221 --> 01:05:55,911
- I stole a couple cars.

1263
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:56,828
- How many?

1264
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,592
- About 30 that they know of.

1265
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:03,661
- So what about after you got out,

1266
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:06,328
why didn't you come see me then?

1267
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,677
- I felt like I ain't
had nothing to offer you.

1268
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,513
I've been trying to get myself together.

1269
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,401
I didn't want you to see me like that.

1270
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:36,318
- Are you together now?

1271
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:39,409
- I'm working on it.

1272
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:43,601
- (sighs) When I was a little girl,

1273
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:47,641
I will cry for you, I
will cry myself to sleep.

1274
01:06:47,641 --> 01:06:49,801
All the other girls would
always have their dads

1275
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,193
for the father daughter dance

1276
01:06:51,193 --> 01:06:53,681
and I would just have my mother.

1277
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:56,931
Grandpa came one year and then he died.

1278
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:07,352
- I'm sorry, baby.

1279
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:14,497
- (sighs) There was always
this song that came on.

1280
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,707
Mama said it was a classic.

1281
01:07:16,707 --> 01:07:19,038
The other girls would go crazy.

1282
01:07:19,038 --> 01:07:22,177
It was called, "Dance With My Father".

1283
01:07:22,177 --> 01:07:24,849
- (chuckles) Yeah.

1284
01:07:24,849 --> 01:07:26,599
Yeah, it's a classic.

1285
01:07:33,169 --> 01:07:35,419
You know my brother, Dylan.

1286
01:07:37,129 --> 01:07:38,209
- Really?

1287
01:07:38,209 --> 01:07:41,209
- Yeah, he made a cover to the song.

1288
01:07:42,668 --> 01:07:44,249
- Your brother's Dylan?

1289
01:07:44,249 --> 01:07:45,097
- Mmhmm.

1290
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:46,358
- I thought I saw him downstairs.

1291
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:48,307
I was so nervous.

1292
01:07:48,307 --> 01:07:52,057

I don't know how I'm gonna
be able to make it up to you,

1300
01:08:27,657 --> 01:08:30,907
but I think this might be a good start.

1301
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:35,592
We can listen to it 13
times if you'd like,

1302
01:08:36,678 --> 01:08:38,595
one time for each year.

1303
01:08:40,228 --> 01:08:41,489

Do you really think that
woman is coming back?

1317
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:43,883
No, she is leaving that girl here.

1318
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,631
And your irresponsible
brother is not gonna

1319
01:09:46,631 --> 01:09:48,669
step up and take care of that child.

1320
01:09:48,669 --> 01:09:53,210
So, it would be perfect
for the boys to stay here.

1321
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:57,791
- (sighs) Look, I'm going
to sleep, all right?

1322
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:00,791
- Oh no, we need to talk about this.

1323
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,297
- Emani, baby, you talked.

1324
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:08,309
All right, I have nothing to say.

1325
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:10,111
- Conversation is not over.

1326
01:10:10,111 --> 01:10:11,610
I didn't sign up for this.

1327
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:16,610
- (sighs) Woman, do you hear
yourself right now, huh?

1328
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:19,242
You asking a man to get rid
of his own flesh and blood

1329
01:10:19,242 --> 01:10:21,871
all because it reminds
you of their dead mother?

1330
01:10:21,871 --> 01:10:25,301
- Wow, you have no idea how
heartbreaking this is for me.

1331
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:26,410
- What?

1332
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:30,311
Do you think you're the
only one hurting, huh?

1333
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:31,561
I lost my wife.

1334
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,690
I lost the love of my life.

1335
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,429
My boys lost their mother,

1336
01:10:37,429 --> 01:10:39,770
the most important woman in their lives.

1337
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:43,270
We're heartbroken so fuck your heartbreak!

1338
01:10:44,882 --> 01:10:47,389
Your ego is what's broken.

1339
01:10:47,389 --> 01:10:50,530
Our hearts will forever have a hole in it.

1340
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:53,450
So you can do one of two things,

1341
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,301
you can help fill that hole

1342
01:10:55,301 --> 01:10:57,309
or you can get the fuck out of our lives!

1343
01:10:57,309 --> 01:10:58,142
- Excuse me?

1344
01:10:58,142 --> 01:11:00,631
- I've been waiting to say this
shit for a long time, Emani,

1345
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,322
I'm tired of your bullshit!

1346
01:11:02,322 --> 01:11:03,655
I'm tired of it!

1347
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:06,882
- Malachi, my feelings are valid

1348
01:11:06,882 --> 01:11:09,965
and my feelings should matter to you!

1349
01:11:15,111 --> 01:11:18,028
Hey, don't you want me to be happy?

1350
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:23,794
- Look, okay,

1351
01:11:27,181 --> 01:11:29,014
I love you, all right,

1352
01:11:30,141 --> 01:11:34,147
but I'm not gonna choose
you over my children.

1353
01:11:34,147 --> 01:11:37,314
That's just something I'm not gonna do

1354
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:40,748
because at the end of the day,

1355
01:11:40,748 --> 01:11:43,388
you can decide to leave

1356
01:11:43,388 --> 01:11:45,971
and then what will I have, huh?

1357
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:49,932
My boys and my mother are all I have.

1358
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:54,639
I'm not gonna leave my kids on the curb

1359
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:56,972
like my mother did me, okay?

1360
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:01,587
I was in therapy for 10 years,

1361
01:12:02,478 --> 01:12:04,145
10 years in therapy.

1362
01:12:05,508 --> 01:12:08,388
My mother left me on the curb.

1363
01:12:08,388 --> 01:12:10,500
I'm not gonna do that to my boys.

1364
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,548
It took 10 years for that woman

1365
01:12:13,548 --> 01:12:14,940
to love the fuck outta me

1366
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:17,908
for me to realize that
I was worth something.

1367
01:12:17,908 --> 01:12:19,638
She adopted me when I was 10 years old.

1368
01:12:19,638 --> 01:12:24,388
So for 10 years, for 10 years
I went from house to house.

1369
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:28,942
For 10 years, I felt
like nobody wanted me.

1370
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:33,729
She adopted me at 10 years old.

1371
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:37,980
So for 10 years, I went
from house to house.

1372
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,813
For 10 years, I thought
I was better off dead.

1373
01:12:43,289 --> 01:12:47,879
For 10 years, I didn't
think anybody wanted me.

1374
01:12:47,879 --> 01:12:51,796
For 10 years, I didn't
even know what love was.

1375
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:55,198
I don't want to hear you say

1376
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:58,115
another goddam thing about my boys.

1377
01:13:00,529 --> 01:13:04,029
You can either step up and be their mother

1378
01:13:05,207 --> 01:13:07,919
or you can get the fuck out of our lives

1379
01:13:07,919 --> 01:13:10,879
because there is no way in hell

1380
01:13:10,879 --> 01:13:12,508
that they gonna go through
what I went through.

1381
01:13:12,508 --> 01:13:13,841
Do you hear me?!

1382
01:13:21,424 --> 01:13:24,573
(door rattles)

1383
01:13:24,573 --> 01:13:27,406
(door slams shut)

1384
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:29,668
Mama,

1385
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:35,675
thank you. (crying)

1386
01:13:36,853 --> 01:13:40,893
If I've never told you anything before,

1387
01:13:40,893 --> 01:13:45,195
I just wanna let you
know, I appreciate you.

1388
01:13:45,195 --> 01:13:46,533
I wouldn't be the man I am today

1389
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:49,795
if it wasn't for you, thank you. (crying)

1390
01:13:49,795 --> 01:13:53,712
(crying) Thank you, thank you.

1391
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:58,140
(sobbing)
- It's okay.

1392
01:14:01,013 --> 01:14:02,383
- None of us would be who we are

1393
01:14:02,383 --> 01:14:04,633
if it wasn't for you, mama.

1394
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:11,007
- I don't know what I
would do without you, mama.

1395
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:16,017
- Yeah, I'd probably be
dead if it wasn't for you.

1396
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:21,435
Thank you for saving me.

1397
01:14:24,035 --> 01:14:27,355
(sighs)
(sobbing)

1398
01:14:27,355 --> 01:14:28,855
- It's okay, baby.

1399
01:14:30,222 --> 01:14:33,305
It's okay.
(sobbing)

1400
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:40,864
(coughing)
(knocking at the door)

1401
01:14:40,864 --> 01:14:43,155
Who is it? (clears throat)

1402
01:14:43,155 --> 01:14:46,488
- [Emani] It's me, Emani, it's me Emani.

1403
01:14:48,591 --> 01:14:49,424
- Come in.

1404
01:14:53,879 --> 01:14:54,962
Hi, you okay?

1405
01:14:57,466 --> 01:15:00,383
- Um, I think I owe you an apology.

1406
01:15:01,389 --> 01:15:03,418
I'm sorry for my behavior.

1407
01:15:03,418 --> 01:15:06,418
- Oh, Emani, I get it and I get you.

1408
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:13,029
- I don't know how to be who they need.

1409
01:15:14,018 --> 01:15:19,018
- (sighs) (chuckles) I fostered five boys.

1410
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:24,771
(laughs) Five unruly boys

1411
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:29,060
and everyday I had to
look them in their eyes,

1412
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,977
knowing that I wasn't their mother,

1413
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,919
that I didn't carry them

1414
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:38,540
and that I wouldn't have the connection

1415
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:42,373
that I wish I could. (coughs)

1416
01:15:43,351 --> 01:15:46,089
- So how did you do it?

1417
01:15:46,089 --> 01:15:50,879
Because (sighs) I feel
like such an outsider

1418
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,311
and walking around my house

1419
01:15:52,311 --> 01:15:56,728
looking at pictures of their
mother, it's killing me.

1420
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:01,748
- Yeah, well I took it day by day.

1421
01:16:01,748 --> 01:16:05,289
(sighs) Emani, I know we both have

1422
01:16:05,289 --> 01:16:07,539
two different religions and

1423
01:16:09,919 --> 01:16:14,419
but I do know, is that we
believe in one higher being,

1424
01:16:15,511 --> 01:16:18,011
a higher being that brings us,

1425
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:22,539
brings us things for a reason.

1426
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:29,147
And Emani, God brought you
those boys for a reason

1427
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,569
and whether you believe it or not,

1428
01:16:34,569 --> 01:16:36,911
those boys need you.

1429
01:16:36,911 --> 01:16:40,391
(laughs) And you just gonna
have to understand that.

1430
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:44,800
And everyday won't be
easy, but it'll get better.

1431
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,812
But it won't get better
if you look at those boys

1432
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:51,312
like they're a foreign object.

1433
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,652
- I have a question,

1434
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:58,141
what made you wanna adopt all these boys?

1435
01:16:58,141 --> 01:17:00,808
And I mean, at such a young age?

1436
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:03,449
- Get on up here.

1437
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:05,699
(coughing)

1438
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:13,971
Well, (sighs)

1439
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:17,350
(laughs) a failed marriage

1440
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:20,843
will make you do some
crazy things. (laughs)

1441
01:17:20,843 --> 01:17:23,203
We tried to have a baby for a few years,

1442
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:24,870
but I just couldn't.

1443
01:17:25,811 --> 01:17:27,644
So my husband left me.

1444
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:31,608
He said I was only half of a woman.

1445
01:17:33,712 --> 01:17:38,371
So during the divorce, I
got this house paid in full

1446
01:17:38,371 --> 01:17:41,152
and a large lump sum of money

1447
01:17:41,152 --> 01:17:42,912
and that's when I met your husband

1448
01:17:42,912 --> 01:17:44,971
stealing out of the grocery store.

1449
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:49,582
(laughs) Oh, I stopped
him, paid for the food

1450
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:52,003
and we became fast friends.

1451
01:17:52,003 --> 01:17:53,352
Every week I would see him

1452
01:17:53,352 --> 01:17:54,860
standing outside of that grocery store

1453
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:59,027
and then finally I said,
"Where are your parents?"

1454
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:05,208
And that's when he told me
his heartbreaking story.

1455
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:09,041
So I went home, slept
on it and I adopted him.

1456
01:18:12,508 --> 01:18:14,528
And after a year of us being together,

1457
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,379
Christmas came and he
made a Christmas list

1458
01:18:16,379 --> 01:18:19,320
and on that list he asked
for a little brother.

1459
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,988
(laughs) There I was again,

1460
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:26,079
having to relive the fact
that I couldn't deliver,

1461
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:28,496
but then God, he spoke to me.

1462
01:18:31,128 --> 01:18:35,528
So I, I adopted Xavier. (laughs)

1463
01:18:35,528 --> 01:18:38,027
Good God and then the next year,

1464
01:18:38,027 --> 01:18:40,339
Xavier put on his Christmas list

1465
01:18:40,339 --> 01:18:41,867
that he wanted a little brother

1466
01:18:41,867 --> 01:18:44,288
because he didn't wanna be the youngest.

1467
01:18:44,288 --> 01:18:46,640
(laughs) So I went down to the agency

1468
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,539
and they showed me these two little boys,

1469
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:53,122
Elijah and David and I just
couldn't make the decision.

1470
01:18:54,099 --> 01:18:56,468
So I choose both of 'em.

1471
01:18:56,468 --> 01:18:59,968
There, there, I was done, four was enough.

1472
01:19:01,627 --> 01:19:04,670
Oh, but then one of my
friends died during childbirth

1473
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:06,920
and that's how I got Dylan.

1474
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:11,578
Now Dylan was the only
one that I had from birth.

1475
01:19:11,578 --> 01:19:13,910
- So all these boys,

1476
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:16,208
you never wanted a little girl?

1477
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:21,208
- Yeah, I wanted whatever God
would bless me with. (laughs)

1478
01:19:21,418 --> 01:19:24,760
Oh but honestly, I couldn't
handle a little girl

1479
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,510
with all these boys.

1480
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:29,958
(laughs) You see 'em.

1481
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:33,888
- And here I was trying to give
you two more for Christmas.

1482
01:19:33,888 --> 01:19:35,388
He won't tell you,

1483
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:42,383
but I was trying to convince
him to let you take the kids.

1484
01:19:43,457 --> 01:19:46,238
I wasn't seeing straight.

1485
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:47,358
I feel so selfish.

1486
01:19:47,358 --> 01:19:50,525
- Oh baby, don't you beat yourself up.

1487
01:19:51,619 --> 01:19:54,278
The problem is, we all
have this dream picture

1488
01:19:54,278 --> 01:19:57,168
of what, what our lives should be

1489
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:59,670
and what our families should look like

1490
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:02,750
and as women, we see
that at a very young age.

1491
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,798
No woman every pictures
themselves as raising

1492
01:20:05,798 --> 01:20:07,957
somebody else's children,

1493
01:20:07,957 --> 01:20:10,696
but sometimes we just
gotta let go of that dream

1494
01:20:10,696 --> 01:20:14,607
and open up our hearts
to what God has for us.

1495
01:20:14,607 --> 01:20:16,357
- Yeah, you're right.

1496
01:20:18,857 --> 01:20:20,777
- Take your time.

1497
01:20:20,777 --> 01:20:24,027
It'll all work out, I promise you that.

1498
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:27,903
- Thanks.

1499
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:32,568
- No problem. (laughs)

1500
01:20:35,128 --> 01:20:38,168
Now, I know you don't celebrate Christmas,

1501
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:42,287
but in this house, we like
to love on one another

1502
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:45,348
and celebrate family, okay?

1503
01:20:45,348 --> 01:20:47,015
So no more fighting.

1504
01:20:48,638 --> 01:20:50,310
- No more fighting.

1505
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:53,893
- That's right. (coughing)

1506
01:20:55,088 --> 01:20:56,579
- Are you okay?

1507
01:20:56,579 --> 01:20:58,379
(coughing)

1508
01:20:58,379 --> 01:21:02,979
- Just a little cough, I'm
gonna be all right. (coughing)

1509
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:06,350
- [Emani] All right, let
me get you some water.

1510
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:07,939
- [Zooey] Are you okay, Miss Angel?

1511
01:21:07,939 --> 01:21:11,008
(coughing)

1512
01:21:11,008 --> 01:21:12,938
- [Emani] Are you okay?

1513
01:21:12,938 --> 01:21:16,050
I'm gonna, (gasps)
you're coughing up blood.

1514
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:17,132
- [Zooey] Daddy, daddy!

1515
01:21:17,132 --> 01:21:21,397
- No, no, don't call
'em, they'll just panic.

1516
01:21:21,397 --> 01:21:22,757
- [Xavier] What's going on, baby girl?

1517
01:21:22,757 --> 01:21:25,717
- [Zooey] Grandma is sick.

1518
01:21:25,717 --> 01:21:27,045
- Sick?

1519
01:21:27,045 --> 01:21:29,295
(coughing)

1520
01:21:30,775 --> 01:21:32,285
Is it back again?

1521
01:21:32,285 --> 01:21:34,202
- [Emani] Is what back?

1522
01:21:37,786 --> 01:21:38,786
- What's up?

1523
01:21:40,757 --> 01:21:43,924
- Answer me, mama, is the cancer back?

1524
01:21:48,706 --> 01:21:51,226
- Yeah, it's been back for a few weeks.

1525
01:21:51,226 --> 01:21:52,775
- What you mean it's been
back for a few weeks?

1526
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:53,845
You ain't tell nobody?

1527
01:21:53,845 --> 01:21:55,418
How long have you known about this?

1528
01:21:55,418 --> 01:21:57,283
- Come on, man, she wanted
to tell everybody herself.

1529
01:21:57,283 --> 01:21:58,782
- How long, David?

1530
01:21:58,782 --> 01:21:59,713
- Since Thanksgiving.

1531
01:21:59,713 --> 01:22:01,691
- Thanksgiving and you
hold something like this

1532
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:02,750
from us for that long?

1533
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,167
- Zav, calm down.

1534
01:22:06,691 --> 01:22:07,991
- Calm down?

1535
01:22:07,991 --> 01:22:12,011
How you expect me to calm down, huh, how?

1536
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:13,993
- Hey, hey, what's up?

1537
01:22:13,993 --> 01:22:14,826
What's going on?

1538
01:22:14,826 --> 01:22:16,163
- Man, mama's cancer's
back and this nigger

1539
01:22:16,163 --> 01:22:17,521
been knowing since Thanksgiving.

1540
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:18,843
- What, mama.

1541
01:22:18,843 --> 01:22:19,676
- Is this the reason why you

1542
01:22:19,676 --> 01:22:21,473
wanted us all to come back home?

1543
01:22:21,473 --> 01:22:22,640
- Yeah, it is.

1544
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:27,371
All right, but I shouldn't have
to make anybody do anything.

1545
01:22:27,371 --> 01:22:29,603
Y'all shoulda been here for Thanksgiving.

1546
01:22:29,603 --> 01:22:30,436
- [Angel] David.

1547
01:22:30,436 --> 01:22:32,630
- No, come on, they shoulda been here.

1548
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:34,283
I mean, y'all shoulda
been here for Thanksgiving

1549
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,523
to find out for yourselves.

1550
01:22:36,523 --> 01:22:37,356
- David--

1551
01:22:37,356 --> 01:22:38,301
- No, come on, ma.

1552
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:41,713
- David, don't do this--
- No, it's true.

1553
01:22:41,713 --> 01:22:42,710
They never come by.

1554
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,633
They never check on you.

1555
01:22:44,633 --> 01:22:48,331
Phone calls and text messages don't count.

1556
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:51,941
You make time for the
people that you love.

1557
01:22:51,941 --> 01:22:54,421
- (sighs) Look mom, I'm so sorry.

1558
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:57,821
I mean, have you at least
started treatment yet?

1559
01:22:57,821 --> 01:23:02,821
- (coughs) We need to talk about this.

1560
01:23:02,849 --> 01:23:05,609
- Oh mama, hey, we all here,

1561
01:23:05,609 --> 01:23:08,697
so we're listening, what's going on?

1562
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:10,697
(sighs)

1563
01:23:12,828 --> 01:23:14,445
- There is no treatment.

1564
01:23:14,445 --> 01:23:16,259
- What do you mean there is no treatment?

1565
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:19,718
- I have chosen not to
take treatment this time.

1566
01:23:19,718 --> 01:23:23,526
This is my third time and I am tired.

1567
01:23:23,526 --> 01:23:25,824
- So you're just gonna give up on us?

1568
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,704
You can't leave us, we need you.

1569
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:31,621
- I already tried to talk about it.

1570
01:23:32,462 --> 01:23:34,962
- What are her options, David?

1571
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,941
- Well my friend knows
about this new trial

1572
01:23:39,941 --> 01:23:44,941
that she can be a part of, but
she has to agree to it first.

1573
01:23:45,452 --> 01:23:47,666
- I need to go get a drink.

1574
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:49,293
- Mama, where you going?

1575
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:51,625
- To get a drink of water.

1576
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:53,875
(coughing)

1577
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:04,913
(slow somber music)

1578
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:24,792
- Mama, you gotta sign up for that trial.

1579
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:26,810
- Oh, she's signing up for this trial.

1580
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:30,100
- Mama look, no is not an option.

1581
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,992
- Mama, I'm taking you in after Christmas.

1582
01:24:32,992 --> 01:24:33,825
- No.

1583
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,880
Now I have fought and I have
fought and I have fought

1584
01:24:39,946 --> 01:24:41,196
and I am tired.

1585
01:24:42,498 --> 01:24:44,581
My body is so very tired.

1586
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:48,598
All I want is to make it to my birthday

1587
01:24:48,598 --> 01:24:51,598
and spend my last days with my boys.

1588
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:54,268
I'm not doing chemo.

1589
01:24:54,268 --> 01:24:55,999
I'm not doing radiation.

1590
01:24:55,999 --> 01:24:57,378
I'm not doing a trial.

1591
01:24:57,378 --> 01:24:59,711
I'm not doing any treatment.

1592
01:25:00,999 --> 01:25:03,199
Now y'all are grown.

1593
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:08,199
You have your own lives and
it's time for you to grow up!

1594
01:25:08,268 --> 01:25:10,450
Now there is life and there is death

1595
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:13,538
and you have to understand it.

1596
01:25:13,538 --> 01:25:17,399
Now I have prayed about
this cancer so much

1597
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:19,732
that my knees have blisters.

1598
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:22,879
Every time they tell me that it's gone,

1599
01:25:22,879 --> 01:25:26,462
it comes back over and
over and over again.

1600
01:25:27,818 --> 01:25:30,388
This is not the life that I wanna live

1601
01:25:30,388 --> 01:25:34,988
the rest of my life fighting
this disease forever.

1602
01:25:34,988 --> 01:25:38,639
Now instead of telling
me what I need to do,

1603
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,222
you need to be men,

1604
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:43,527
men I raised you to be!

1605
01:25:46,077 --> 01:25:48,188
Get your shit together.

1606
01:25:48,188 --> 01:25:51,105
No, don't touch me, don't touch me.

1607
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:57,879
Now I am tired and I'm gonna go upstairs

1608
01:25:57,879 --> 01:25:59,796
and I'm going to sleep.

1609
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:02,799
Now tomorrow's Christmas
Eve and I'm gonna wake up

1610
01:26:02,799 --> 01:26:05,549
and we not gonna talk about this.

1611
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:09,375
I just wanna enjoy my Christmas.

1612
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:14,300
(coughing)

1613
01:26:18,357 --> 01:26:23,357
(labored breathing)
(coughing)

1614
01:26:30,907 --> 01:26:32,947
- I tried to talk to her.

1615
01:26:32,947 --> 01:26:34,848
- Why didn't you just tell us?

1616
01:26:34,848 --> 01:26:37,760
- I promised her I wouldn't.

1617
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,608
You know, I figured if
she didn't say anything

1618
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:41,413
during this visit, I would
just sit you all down

1619
01:26:41,413 --> 01:26:43,184
and tell you myself.

1620
01:26:43,184 --> 01:26:45,934
- So how long does she have left?

1621
01:26:47,714 --> 01:26:50,002
- The doctor says six weeks.

1622
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:51,502
- Six weeks, what?

1623
01:26:55,312 --> 01:26:58,944
- The cancer's more
aggressive this time, guys

1624
01:26:58,944 --> 01:27:03,343
and by her not doing the
treatment, it's taking over.

1625
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:07,594
The blood is a sign that
it's moving to her lungs.

1626
01:27:07,594 --> 01:27:09,344
- So we just need a miracle then.

1627
01:27:09,344 --> 01:27:12,234
- I mean this trial would be the miracle,

1628
01:27:12,234 --> 01:27:15,362
but she has to be a part of it first.

1629
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:18,202
It's literally her last option.

1630
01:27:18,202 --> 01:27:19,822
(sighs)

1631
01:27:19,822 --> 01:27:23,583
- I mean, what are we supposed to do, huh?

1632
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:24,942
Are we supposed to just all sit around

1633
01:27:24,942 --> 01:27:27,554
and just watch her die?

1634
01:27:27,554 --> 01:27:28,652
- We can't do that.

1635
01:27:28,652 --> 01:27:29,742
There's something we gotta do

1636
01:27:29,742 --> 01:27:31,962
to be able to get through to her.

1637
01:27:31,962 --> 01:27:33,545
- I don't know how.

1638
01:27:39,064 --> 01:27:39,897
- Elijah.

1639
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:44,217
- Huh?

1640
01:27:45,394 --> 01:27:47,977
- He's always had mama's heart.

1641
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:52,162
- Well you know they've been at odds

1642
01:27:52,162 --> 01:27:55,503
ever since he went to the military,

1643
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:57,003
but it could work.

1644
01:27:58,234 --> 01:28:01,817
- They haven't really
spoken in five years.

1645
01:28:02,982 --> 01:28:05,642
- Well look, if that's our only option,

1646
01:28:05,642 --> 01:28:06,581
then what we need to do

1647
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,851
is we need to get Elijah on the phone

1648
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:11,432
and tell him that he needs to come home.

1649
01:28:11,432 --> 01:28:13,451
- I already tried.

1650
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:15,784
They denied his leave.
- No!

1651
01:28:16,683 --> 01:28:18,541
You need to get Elijah on the phone

1652
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:22,243
and tell him that mama
is dying, all right?

1653
01:28:22,243 --> 01:28:26,381
He needs to come home and
he needs to come home now.

1654
01:28:26,381 --> 01:28:28,191
Davey, call him again.

1655
01:28:28,191 --> 01:28:30,774
Tell him to bring his ass home!

1656
01:28:32,032 --> 01:28:35,199
(gentle somber music)

1657
01:28:46,599 --> 01:28:49,849
- Hey bro, what's going on, man?

1658
01:28:49,849 --> 01:28:53,228
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good, um.

1659
01:28:53,228 --> 01:28:56,395
(gentle somber music)

1660
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:53,034
- G-ma, are you cooking pancakes?

1661
01:29:53,034 --> 01:29:54,894
- Yep, I sure am.

1662
01:29:54,894 --> 01:29:56,514
- I love breakfast food.

1663
01:29:56,514 --> 01:29:57,934
- I love your pancakes.

1664
01:29:57,934 --> 01:29:59,666
My new mom can't cook.

1665
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:00,874
- Really, Malik?

1666
01:30:00,874 --> 01:30:02,575
Is that how you really feel?

1667
01:30:02,575 --> 01:30:04,055
- You can't cook like G-ma.

1668
01:30:04,055 --> 01:30:04,888
- Hm.

1669
01:30:04,888 --> 01:30:06,615
- Our old mama couldn't cook either.

1670
01:30:06,615 --> 01:30:08,523
Daddy has a thing for
women that can't cook.

1671
01:30:08,523 --> 01:30:09,685
- Excuse me.
- Uh,

1672
01:30:09,685 --> 01:30:12,405
Emani, why don't you come
on over here and help me.

1673
01:30:12,405 --> 01:30:15,335
I'll teach you my recipe, come on.

1674
01:30:15,335 --> 01:30:20,335
(laughs) So, what I do is, I
put a cup of all-purpose flour,

1675
01:30:20,884 --> 01:30:24,154
take a little pinch of (voice trails off)

1676
01:30:24,154 --> 01:30:26,005
- Hey mama, you need some help?

1677
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:27,975
- (sighs) I'm good, baby.

1678
01:30:27,975 --> 01:30:29,983
So--
- Everything okay?

1679

asking her how she feeling?

1920
01:42:44,045 --> 01:42:47,314
- Yeah, like she dying or something.

1921
01:42:47,314 --> 01:42:49,413
- Well I mean, she didn't look her best.

1922
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:50,246
- Faith.

1923
01:42:50,246 --> 01:42:51,079
- What?

1924
01:42:52,299 --> 01:42:55,947
- (sighs) It's back.

1925
01:42:55,947 --> 01:42:57,114
- What's back?

1926
01:43:00,177 --> 01:43:03,917
- The cancer and she
not taking the treatment

1927
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:06,667
and I need to have a talk to her.

1928
01:43:07,627 --> 01:43:10,460
- Well, how long has it been back?

1929
01:43:11,747 --> 01:43:16,330
- I don't know, but the doctor
only gave her six weeks.

1930
01:43:17,288 --> 01:43:18,121
- What?

1931
01:43:20,507 --> 01:43:22,848
- There's this new trial at my hospital,

1932
01:43:22,848 --> 01:43:25,939
but she is refusing to be a part of it.

1933
01:43:25,939 --> 01:43:29,272
- Yeah well as fucked up as that may be,

1934
01:43:30,656 --> 01:43:34,619
we are going to have
to respect her wishes.

1935
01:43:34,619 --> 01:43:37,486
None of y'all truly know
what she went through

1936
01:43:37,486 --> 01:43:39,153
that last two years.

1937
01:43:40,237 --> 01:43:43,797
I was there with her, every minute

1938
01:43:43,797 --> 01:43:45,539
and it wasn't nothing pretty.

1939
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:47,119
- Wait a minute now, sis,

1940
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,532
so we're supposed to sit back
and just let her give up?

1941
01:43:49,532 --> 01:43:51,772
- We are not letting her give up.

1942
01:43:51,772 --> 01:43:53,689
Roy, it's a transition.

1943
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:56,461
Life is a transition.

1944
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:00,732
Death is not the greatest loss in life.

1945
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:04,028
Death is just a part of life.

1946
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,082
- But no one wants to
see their mother die.

1947
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:12,999
- No baby, but eventually
you're gonna have to.

1948
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:22,180
(sniffs) Roy, you remember that
riddle grandma used to say?

1949
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:25,101
- Life asks death,

1950
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:29,612
"How come everybody love
me, but they hate you?"

1951
01:44:29,612 --> 01:44:31,779
- Hm, and death responded,

1952
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,567
"Because you are a beautiful lie

1953
01:44:38,612 --> 01:44:41,029
"and I am the painful truth."

1954
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:52,502
- (sighs) Look, boys, it's true,

1955
01:44:52,502 --> 01:44:55,620
death ain't something you
can prepare yourself for

1956
01:44:55,620 --> 01:45:00,120
so you just gotta live each
minute like it's the last.

1957
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:02,410
(doorbell rings)

1958
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:03,243
- Who is it now?

1959
01:45:03,243 --> 01:45:05,080
Damn, the party over.

1960
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,213
(claps hands)

1961
01:45:07,213 --> 01:45:08,656
- I'll get it.

1962
01:45:08,656 --> 01:45:11,573
(knocking on door)

1963
01:45:17,907 --> 01:45:19,107
Elijah?

1964
01:45:19,107 --> 01:45:21,191
- [Elijah] What's up, man?

1965
01:45:21,191 --> 01:45:22,682
- [David] How did you even just--

1966
01:45:22,682 --> 01:45:23,515
- [Elijah] Oh now,

1967
01:45:23,515 --> 01:45:25,563
I moved Heaven and Earth to get here, man.

1968
01:45:25,563 --> 01:45:28,396
Just pray I don't go get
arrested for going AWOL.

1969
01:45:28,396 --> 01:45:30,537
- [David] Well look man,
you just missed the party.

1970
01:45:30,537 --> 01:45:31,649
Step in.

1971
01:45:31,649 --> 01:45:33,068
- [Elijah] Hey everybody, how y'all doing?

1972
01:45:33,068 --> 01:45:35,169
(group greeting Elijah)

1973
01:45:35,169 --> 01:45:37,888
- [Malachi] What's up bro? (grunts)

1974
01:45:37,888 --> 01:45:38,908
- How y'all doing, guys?

1975
01:45:38,908 --> 01:45:40,300
(group responding)

1976
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:41,368
Where's mama?

1977
01:45:41,368 --> 01:45:45,868
- Eh, she, she went to sleep. (sighs)

1978
01:45:46,889 --> 01:45:50,139
- All right, cool, I'm gonna go say hi.

1979
01:45:51,066 --> 01:45:53,066
(sighs)

1980
01:45:54,444 --> 01:45:57,296
(gentle quiet music)

1981
01:45:57,296 --> 01:45:59,754
(knocking)

1982
01:45:59,754 --> 01:46:00,587
Mama.

1983
01:46:02,976 --> 01:46:03,809
Mama?

1984
01:46:08,426 --> 01:46:09,774
Mama?

1985
01:46:09,774 --> 01:46:11,056
Mama!

1986
01:46:11,056 --> 01:46:12,234
Mama!

1987
01:46:12,234 --> 01:46:13,067
Mama!

1988
01:46:13,067 --> 01:46:13,900
Mama!

1989
01:46:14,994 --> 01:46:15,946
Mama!

1990
01:46:15,946 --> 01:46:17,325
Mama!

1991
01:46:17,325 --> 01:46:18,386
Oh shit.

1992
01:46:18,386 --> 01:46:22,053
(gentle somber piano music)

1993
01:46:25,845 --> 01:46:27,314
Mama,

1994
01:46:27,314 --> 01:46:28,434
Mama?

1995
01:46:28,434 --> 01:46:29,267
Mama?

1996
01:46:29,267 --> 01:46:30,616
Come on mama, get up.

1997
01:46:30,616 --> 01:46:32,386
Mama get up.

1998
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:33,736
Help!

1999
01:46:33,736 --> 01:46:34,569
Help!

2000
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:38,262
- Hey mama, you gotta come
down and see. (laughs)

2001
01:46:38,262 --> 01:46:39,095
Mama.

2002
01:46:40,582 --> 01:46:41,982
(sobbing)

2003
01:46:41,982 --> 01:46:44,883
(muttering) What's going on?

2004
01:46:44,883 --> 01:46:46,363
What's going on, mama?

2005
01:46:46,363 --> 01:46:48,163
- (sobbing) I found her on the
floor and she wasn't moving.

2006
01:46:48,163 --> 01:46:48,996
- Come on.

2007
01:46:49,934 --> 01:46:51,902
- Ah, how bad is the cancer, yo?

2008
01:46:51,902 --> 01:46:53,433
How bad is the cancer, David?

2009
01:46:53,433 --> 01:46:54,694
- Listen man, calm down.

2010
01:46:54,694 --> 01:46:57,662
We just gotta get her
some help, man, calm down.

2011
01:46:57,662 --> 01:46:59,022
- I'll call 911.

2012
01:46:59,022 --> 01:46:59,855
- Megan!

2013
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:03,375
Megan!

2014
01:47:05,891 --> 01:47:06,891
- Oh my God.

2015
01:47:08,102 --> 01:47:10,291
- Baby, you gotta help.

2016
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:12,011
Baby, she's not breathing.

2017
01:47:12,011 --> 01:47:16,281
- Mama Angel, Mama Angel, can you hear me?

2018
01:47:16,281 --> 01:47:17,561
- This 911?

2019
01:47:17,561 --> 01:47:19,891
Yes, it's my mom, she's a cancer patient.

2020
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:21,021
She's unresponsive.

2021
01:47:21,021 --> 01:47:24,262
We're at 630 Echo Street, Atlanta.

2022
01:47:24,262 --> 01:47:25,851
No, when was the last time she had chemo?

2023
01:47:25,851 --> 01:47:26,961
- [David] She's not on chemo, man.

2024
01:47:26,961 --> 01:47:27,830
- What do you mean she's not on chemo?

2025
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:28,901
- She didn't want no radiation.

2026
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:30,610
Just tell 'em to get the fuck here, man.

2027
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:32,810
- Okay, okay, no chemo, no radiation,

2028
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:34,530
they're doing CPR right now.

2029
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:37,370
Yes, we have two doctors in the family.

2030
01:47:37,370 --> 01:47:39,870
Okay got you, hurry up please.

2031
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:42,471
- Wait, what's wrong?

2032
01:47:42,471 --> 01:47:43,711
Mama!

2033
01:47:43,711 --> 01:47:45,539
- [Dylan] Is she okay?

2034
01:47:45,539 --> 01:47:46,372
Oh my God.

2035
01:47:47,998 --> 01:47:49,004
- [Malachi] Oh my God.

2036
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:49,837
- I just found her.

2037
01:47:49,837 --> 01:47:51,907
She was in the bathroom passed out.

2038
01:47:51,907 --> 01:47:53,569
- [Xavier] Come on mama, come on mama,

2039
01:47:53,569 --> 01:47:55,308
stay here for us, come on.

2040
01:47:55,308 --> 01:47:56,828
- Why the fuck wasn't
she getting treatment?

2041
01:47:56,828 --> 01:47:58,020
David, you're a fucking doctor, man.

2042
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:00,959
What the fuck's going on, man?

2043
01:48:00,959 --> 01:48:03,569
- She refused the treatment, man.

2044
01:48:03,569 --> 01:48:04,402
- What?

2045
01:48:05,457 --> 01:48:06,290
Wait.

2046
01:48:07,801 --> 01:48:10,892
Did you know when you called me?

2047
01:48:10,892 --> 01:48:13,559
Did you know when you called me?

2048
01:48:14,651 --> 01:48:15,982
- I've known since Thanksgiving, man,

2049
01:48:15,982 --> 01:48:17,340
she wanted to tell everybody herself.

2050
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:19,198
- What the fuck and you didn't say shit?

2051
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:20,680
You was gonna leave us
in the fucking dark?

2052
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:22,730
(yelling over each other)

2053
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:25,018
- The fuck, don't talk to
me like that, all right?

2054
01:48:25,018 --> 01:48:26,440
You're the one who been
gone for five years.

2055
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:27,999
You ain't called her, you
ain't sent her a letter

2056
01:48:27,999 --> 01:48:29,650
or nothing like that.

2057
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:31,738
So don't come at me
talking about what the fuck

2058
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:34,520
I coulda been doing when you
ain't been doing shit, nigger.

2059
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:35,353
Come on!

2060
01:48:36,803 --> 01:48:38,553
- Goddammit, goddamn.

2061
01:48:41,987 --> 01:48:43,563
- [Malachi] Calm your ass down, boy!

2062
01:48:43,563 --> 01:48:44,547
- He shoulda told her!

2063
01:48:44,547 --> 01:48:47,678
(screaming)
(siren blaring)

2064
01:48:47,678 --> 01:48:49,186
Somebody call an ambulance.

2065
01:48:49,186 --> 01:48:50,066
- I think I hear 'em outside.

2066
01:48:50,066 --> 01:48:52,107
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.

2067
01:48:52,107 --> 01:48:53,506
Come on, let's go.

2068
01:48:53,506 --> 01:48:55,396
- [Xavier] Come on, I need you, mama.

2069
01:48:55,396 --> 01:48:57,077
I need you mama.

2070
01:48:57,077 --> 01:48:59,160
Oh mama, be strong, mama.

2071
01:49:00,146 --> 01:49:02,075
Mama. (crying)

2072
01:49:02,075 --> 01:49:03,275
You're a fighter, you've been here before.

2073
01:49:03,275 --> 01:49:05,256
This ain't your first time,
this ain't your first rodeo.

2074
01:49:05,256 --> 01:49:07,065
I need you to ride this one.

2075
01:49:07,065 --> 01:49:12,065
(people muttering)
(praying)

2076
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:19,151
- [Uncle Roy] I pray that you
lay your hands on my sister.

2077
01:49:19,151 --> 01:49:21,931
Keep her with us just a little bit--

2078
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:24,681
- [Malachi] This ain't your time!

2079
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:28,907
- [Megan] Come on Angel, come on.

2080
01:49:28,907 --> 01:49:30,971
- [Roy] Come on, it's gonna be all right,

2081
01:49:30,971 --> 01:49:32,995
she gonna be all right.

2082
01:49:32,995 --> 01:49:34,474
Be strong now.

2083
01:49:34,474 --> 01:49:37,966
- (sobbing) Please get up.

2084
01:49:37,966 --> 01:49:40,105
- [Xavier] Damn, where's that ambulance!

2085
01:49:40,105 --> 01:49:42,272
(sobbing)

2086
01:49:44,646 --> 01:49:47,813
- [Xavier] Come on mama, come on mama.

2087
01:49:51,105 --> 01:49:53,605
- One, two, three, four, five.

2088
01:49:55,694 --> 01:49:57,914
- [Roy] Where's that damn ambulance?

2089
01:49:57,914 --> 01:50:02,914
(people muttering)
(crying)

2090
01:50:07,885 --> 01:50:10,885
(slow somber music)

2091
01:50:24,901 --> 01:50:28,484
- You got to stay with
me, you got to stay.

2092
01:50:29,833 --> 01:50:33,000
Now Angel, you better come back to me!

2093
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:39,510
(sobbing)
(gentle somber music)

2094
01:50:49,951 --> 01:50:53,240
- Now listen, I know this
is tough on you guys,

2095
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,623
but we gotta stick together.

2096
01:50:55,623 --> 01:50:58,562
Now she needs us to be strong.

2097
01:50:58,562 --> 01:51:03,562
She's a fighter, but we gotta
let the doctors do their job.

2098
01:51:04,011 --> 01:51:06,178
- Dad, dad we should pray.

2099
01:51:08,906 --> 01:51:11,571
- That's right, we should pray.

2100
01:51:11,571 --> 01:51:13,488
And you should lead us.

2101
01:51:15,411 --> 01:51:17,411
(sighs)

2102
01:51:19,051 --> 01:51:22,831
- Dear heavenly Father, we
ask that you send your angels

2103
01:51:22,831 --> 01:51:24,664
to help heal an angel.

2104
01:51:25,522 --> 01:51:28,351
Lord please cover her in your anointed

2105
01:51:28,351 --> 01:51:32,050
and protect her body
from foreign intruders.

2106
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:34,390
Father we ask that you empower the hands

2107
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:35,950
that are working on her for we know

2108
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:39,831
that all things are possible
through you and your grace

2109
01:51:39,831 --> 01:51:42,402
and we ask please extend her life

2110
01:51:42,402 --> 01:51:44,911
so that she may receive our love

2111
01:51:44,911 --> 01:51:47,828
and we may continue to receive hers

2112
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:52,980
as long as you can, Father, please.

2113
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:55,310
In Jesus' name, I pray.

2114
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:56,143
Amen.

2115
01:51:57,015 --> 01:51:58,098
- Amen, amen.

2116
01:51:59,375 --> 01:52:02,862
That was real nice, son, I appreciate it.

2117
01:52:02,862 --> 01:52:05,066
Pastor Jordan, you made it.

2118
01:52:05,066 --> 01:52:06,195
- Yes, sir, where is she?

2119
01:52:06,195 --> 01:52:07,695
- Oh she's in ICU.

2120
01:52:08,736 --> 01:52:09,569
- Can we see her?

2121
01:52:09,569 --> 01:52:12,315
I wanna pray over her right now.

2122
01:52:12,315 --> 01:52:14,732
- Uh (sighs)

2123
01:52:16,435 --> 01:52:19,895
- Hi, are you all the
family of Angel Williams?

2124
01:52:19,895 --> 01:52:22,478
- Yes, we are, how's she doing?

2125
01:52:23,656 --> 01:52:25,495
- She's not doing too good right now.

2126
01:52:25,495 --> 01:52:27,643
- What you mean?

2127
01:52:27,643 --> 01:52:30,160
- Her heart rate is extremely high

2128
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,030
and her blood pressure's really low.

2129
01:52:32,030 --> 01:52:33,242
Now I put her on a few steroids

2130
01:52:33,242 --> 01:52:35,992
to see if I could slow
down her heart rate.

2131
01:52:35,992 --> 01:52:39,021
Just wait and see how that does.

2132
01:52:39,021 --> 01:52:41,010
- Can we see her?

2133
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:42,770
- I'm afraid not right now.

2134
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:46,021
There's just way too much
going on in there right now.

2135
01:52:46,021 --> 01:52:50,000
- Ma'am, we need to see her right now.

2136
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,992
- I'm sorry, that's impossible.

2137
01:52:51,992 --> 01:52:54,930
Any extra excitement will
only raise her heart rate.

2138
01:52:54,930 --> 01:52:59,352
- (laughs) May I ask a question,
what is your job, ma'am?

2139
01:52:59,352 --> 01:53:01,282
- I'm the cardiologist specialist.

2140
01:53:01,282 --> 01:53:05,115
- Ah, ah, cardiologist,
you're a heart doctor.

2141
01:53:06,541 --> 01:53:10,362
- No, I'm the cardiologist specialist.

2142
01:53:10,362 --> 01:53:12,590
- Mm, well what's the difference?

2143
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:14,082
- You see, I'm the one they call

2144
01:53:14,082 --> 01:53:16,549
when the cardiologist fails at his job.

2145
01:53:16,549 --> 01:53:18,181
That's why I'm here.

2146
01:53:18,181 --> 01:53:21,549
- I understand, but you're
missing part of her treatment.

2147
01:53:21,549 --> 01:53:25,181
I need to be in the room right now.

2148
01:53:25,181 --> 01:53:26,409
- And who are you?

2149
01:53:26,409 --> 01:53:28,159
- I am Joseph Jordan.

2150
01:53:29,288 --> 01:53:32,680
- Okay and what is it that you do, Joseph?

2151
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:37,263
- I work for the man that we
all call on when you fail.

2152
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:43,693
Can you please escort us to the room?

2153
01:53:45,981 --> 01:53:46,814
- Please.

2154
01:53:48,789 --> 01:53:53,206
- Listen, at least let the
pastor and her sons go in.

2155
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:58,377
The rest of us, we can
wait out here in the lobby.

2156
01:54:00,109 --> 01:54:02,776
- All right, it has to be quick.

2158

2160

I'm sorry, but you can't leave me.

2161
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:33,548
- Everybody put a hand on your mother.

2162
01:54:36,141 --> 01:54:39,109
Lord, we come before you ever so humble.

2163
01:54:39,109 --> 01:54:41,800
My heart feels as if there's 1,000 knives

2164
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,789
running through it.

2165
01:54:43,789 --> 01:54:44,706
I am weary.

2166
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:48,907
I am spent and I am very sad.

2167
01:54:51,261 --> 01:54:54,928
Please help me, Lord,
please hear my prayer.

2168
01:54:57,701 --> 01:54:59,784
Hold me and my family up.

2169
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,410
Please give us the
strength to walk through.

2170
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:09,410
Please be present, be
persistent with your love.

2171
01:55:12,492 --> 01:55:14,343
Carry us through this heartache,

2172
01:55:14,343 --> 01:55:17,510
sustain us, give us joy, give us hope.

2173
01:55:19,433 --> 01:55:23,721
First Corinthians chapter
15, verse 54 and 55

2174
01:55:23,721 --> 01:55:26,971
say that death is swallowed in victory.

2175
01:55:29,183 --> 01:55:32,492
Oh death, where is your victory?

2176
01:55:32,492 --> 01:55:34,992
Oh death, where is your sting?

2177
01:55:36,681 --> 01:55:40,251
Where is the sting of
death for the believer?

2178
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:41,584
It's ripped out.

2179
01:55:42,741 --> 01:55:46,824
At the cross, Jesus ripped
the stinger from death

2180
01:55:48,932 --> 01:55:53,932
so us, as Christians, we
should no longer fear death

2181
01:55:54,081 --> 01:55:57,831
because our souls will
forever be with Christ

2182
01:55:59,262 --> 01:56:02,180
as we walk in your truth, Lord.

2183
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:05,930
Please keep our eyes
fixed on heavenly things

2184
01:56:07,623 --> 01:56:10,903
and though we know there
will be terrifying events

2185
01:56:10,903 --> 01:56:13,212
that we will face through this life,

2186
01:56:13,212 --> 01:56:16,712
but ultimately, the victory belongs to you

2187
01:56:18,292 --> 01:56:20,961
and as we continue to walk in your truth,

2188
01:56:20,961 --> 01:56:25,161
Lord keep our eyes fixed
on heavenly things.

2189
01:56:25,161 --> 01:56:27,244
Oh Lord God, we trust you

2190
01:56:31,561 --> 01:56:35,228
and if you see fit,
give Angel the strength,

2191
01:56:37,223 --> 01:56:42,223
give her the strength, Lord,
to fight and live another day.

2192
01:56:42,852 --> 01:56:44,769
We are forever grateful

2193
01:56:47,141 --> 01:56:50,641
that we are forever covered in your grace.

2194
01:56:52,336 --> 01:56:55,332
In your son's name, Jesus, we pray.

2195
01:56:55,332 --> 01:56:56,582
Amen.

2196
01:56:56,582 --> 01:56:57,832

- We gotta sing for her.

2201
01:57:16,924 --> 01:57:21,182
She used to love when we sang
some of her favorite songs.

2202
01:57:21,182 --> 01:57:22,682
- Which song, bro?

2203
01:57:25,324 --> 01:57:27,407
- Boys to Men, of course.

(applauding)

2270
02:02:34,981 --> 02:02:38,557
- Thank you choir for
a beautiful selection.

2271
02:02:38,557 --> 02:02:41,269
Now we are gonna go ahead
and bow our head for prayer.

2272
02:02:41,269 --> 02:02:45,307
Lord Jesus, we come before
you today ever so humble.

2273
02:02:45,307 --> 02:02:50,057
Today I cry tears that mean
100 different things at once,

2274
02:02:51,609 --> 02:02:55,442
happy and sorrowful and
desperate and hopeful.

2275
02:02:57,844 --> 02:03:01,761
I trust you to sort them
out as you catch them.

2276
02:03:04,008 --> 02:03:05,425
I hear an answer.

2277
02:03:06,927 --> 02:03:11,927
I hope you hear an answer
each prayer they represent.

2278
02:03:12,144 --> 02:03:15,297
I cry for those of us left behind

2279
02:03:15,297 --> 02:03:19,214
for the lonely ones with
hallows in our hearts.

2280
02:03:20,230 --> 02:03:23,457
I ask you to comfort us, give us peace,

2281
02:03:23,457 --> 02:03:27,098
restore hope and lavish us with love,

2282
02:03:27,098 --> 02:03:28,848
family and belonging.

2283
02:03:30,036 --> 02:03:34,212
In the depths of loss,
meet us with yourself.

2284
02:03:34,212 --> 02:03:37,795
I cry for the legacy
this loved one leaves.

2285
02:03:39,265 --> 02:03:43,824
(sighs) For the ways the
world has been made better

2286
02:03:43,824 --> 02:03:46,874
by her presence, for the memories

2287
02:03:46,874 --> 02:03:49,802
that become both more beautiful

2288
02:03:49,802 --> 02:03:52,715
and more painful on this side of death

2289
02:03:52,715 --> 02:03:55,850
and I pray that the work
you have accomplished

2290
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:58,692
in this remarkable life will grow deeper,

2291
02:03:58,692 --> 02:04:01,859
wider and stronger in the days to come

2292
02:04:03,984 --> 02:04:07,920
and for all the ways you're
making it right again.

2293
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:11,556
I ask that you make me part of your work

2294
02:04:11,556 --> 02:04:14,868
into bringing the Kingdom
of Heaven to Earth.

2295
02:04:14,868 --> 02:04:17,618
I cry knowing you are here for me

2296
02:04:19,824 --> 02:04:24,241
and because you are here,
even my tears have meaning.

2297
02:04:25,789 --> 02:04:26,989
Amen.

2298
02:04:26,989 --> 02:04:28,489
- [Everyone] Amen.

2299
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,670
- We will now open the
floor for reflections.

2300
02:04:39,809 --> 02:04:42,809

2301
02:04:45,784 --> 02:04:50,784

2315
02:05:59,906 --> 02:06:00,914
- How do you find the words

2316
02:06:00,914 --> 02:06:04,081
to reflect on a mother as great as ma?

2317
02:06:07,895 --> 02:06:10,312
- You know, when I was young,

2318
02:06:11,653 --> 02:06:14,986
I watched my ma fill out an application.

2319
02:06:17,090 --> 02:06:20,423
She was trying to get a part-time job so

2320
02:06:21,899 --> 02:06:25,816
she could get our Christmas
gift off of layaway

2321
02:06:28,706 --> 02:06:32,289
So we could have 'em
in time for Christmas.

2322
02:06:34,806 --> 02:06:39,806
- (sighs) I looked at
the line that asked about

2323
02:06:39,938 --> 02:06:44,271
past professions and I
remember thinking to myself--

2324
02:06:46,814 --> 02:06:50,731
- It's too small to write
down what she's been.

2325
02:06:53,956 --> 02:06:57,873
- Everyday, everyday my
mother worked that job,

2326
02:07:01,502 --> 02:07:04,685
(crying) everyday, my mother,

2327
02:07:04,685 --> 02:07:07,268
she helped me with my homework.

2328
02:07:08,692 --> 02:07:12,820
Everyday, my mother, she cooked us dinner.

2329
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:17,501
- Everyday, even though she was
tired, she loved us no less.

2330
02:07:17,501 --> 02:07:22,251
- (crying) We never wanted for anything.

2331
02:07:23,490 --> 02:07:24,323
Nothing.

2332
02:07:26,901 --> 02:07:30,345
- She raised me to be
the best man I could be.

2333
02:07:30,345 --> 02:07:32,603
- So when I sit back and
I think about everything

2334
02:07:32,603 --> 02:07:35,186
that this woman has been to me,

2335
02:07:36,405 --> 02:07:39,572
how she showed me unconditional love--

2336
02:07:47,362 --> 02:07:49,362
(sighs)

2337
02:07:53,277 --> 02:07:56,434
- My mama had this favorite song.

2338
02:07:56,434 --> 02:07:59,684
It was by Trevor Campbell, "I'm Ready".

2339
02:08:02,396 --> 02:08:07,396
♪ I'm ready to love you forever ♪

2340
02:08:10,328 --> 02:08:15,161
♪ Hey love now, come
love me forever more ♪

2341
02:08:18,562 --> 02:08:23,395
- I'm ready to love you forever. (crying)

2342
02:08:26,972 --> 02:08:31,472
This woman had so much love. (crying)

2343
02:08:39,692 --> 02:08:41,541
They say that God will send you angels

2344
02:08:41,541 --> 02:08:43,791
while you're here on Earth.

2345
02:08:46,652 --> 02:08:47,819
Well God, I want you to know,

2346
02:08:47,819 --> 02:08:51,402
I'm very thankful and
grateful for my angel

2347
02:08:52,917 --> 02:08:55,521
because I was blessed
to call my angel, mama.

2348
02:08:55,521 --> 02:08:56,973
- My mama.

2349
02:08:56,973 --> 02:08:58,510
- My mama.

2350
02:08:58,510 --> 02:09:00,213
- All my mama.

2351
02:09:00,213 --> 02:09:02,014
- Be able to call my mama.

2352
02:09:02,014 --> 02:09:03,836
- My mother.

2353
02:09:03,836 --> 02:09:06,213
(crying)

2354
02:09:06,213 --> 02:09:08,463
- I love you mama, forever.

2355
02:09:12,332 --> 02:09:17,332
- I love you, our angel,
and I'll never forget you.

2356
02:09:17,371 --> 02:09:19,931
I'll always remember to
do what you told me to do

2357
02:09:19,931 --> 02:09:21,514
and keep God first.

2358
02:09:24,635 --> 02:09:28,126
I just ask that you send
me a woman down here

2359
02:09:28,126 --> 02:09:31,617
that can cook half as good as you

2360
02:09:31,617 --> 02:09:36,142
because I don't know what I'm
gonna do without your cooking.

2361
02:09:36,142 --> 02:09:38,911
- Not many black women
would accept a white girl

2362
02:09:38,911 --> 02:09:42,494
dating their son. (laughs)

2363
02:09:43,734 --> 02:09:48,734
I always feared going to meet
Mama Angel for the first time,

2364
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:55,239
but they named her Angel
for a reason (laughs)

2365
02:09:57,045 --> 02:09:59,295
'cause that's what she was.

2366
02:10:02,024 --> 02:10:06,107
I am so, so grateful to
have been in her presence

2367
02:10:07,364 --> 02:10:10,781
and to have been able to accept her love.

2368
02:10:11,983 --> 02:10:15,032
And I'm so grateful for all
the nights that we stayed up

2369
02:10:15,032 --> 02:10:16,916
and she taught me to cook. (laughs)

2370
02:10:16,916 --> 02:10:20,962
Her recipes, collard
greens, macaroni and cheese.

2371
02:10:20,962 --> 02:10:24,629
(laughs) That is priceless.

2372
02:10:29,048 --> 02:10:31,465
I love you, Angel, thank you.

2373
02:10:34,834 --> 02:10:37,084
I'll take good care of him.

2374
02:10:41,311 --> 02:10:42,144
I promise.

2375
02:10:44,852 --> 02:10:49,726
- I'm sad that I only got
to know you for a few days,

2376
02:10:49,726 --> 02:10:54,306
but to think of the possibility
to have never met you,

2377
02:10:54,306 --> 02:10:58,197
I appreciate the time we had together.

2378
02:10:58,197 --> 02:11:01,042
I have always loved to cook
and just in those few days,

2379
02:11:01,042 --> 02:11:02,792
I've learned so much.

2380
02:11:04,414 --> 02:11:08,456
When I grow up, I'm gonna
own my own restaurant

2381
02:11:08,456 --> 02:11:11,758
and name it Angel's Heavenly Kitchen.

2382
02:11:11,758 --> 02:11:15,032
There will be a big
picture of you on the sign

2383
02:11:15,032 --> 02:11:18,199
so everyone knows how much I love you.

2384
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:23,940
- Mama Angel, thank you
for always accepting me.

2385
02:11:25,605 --> 02:11:27,573
Thank you for loving
Dylan and I regardless

2386
02:11:27,573 --> 02:11:29,823
of what society had to say.

2387
02:11:32,024 --> 02:11:35,524
When my mother disowned me, you took me in

2388
02:11:38,674 --> 02:11:42,424
so today I feel like I
lost a mother as well,

2389
02:11:45,166 --> 02:11:48,920
but through it all, I have
to remember what you told me

2390
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:51,837
when my grandmother died, you said,

2391
02:11:53,602 --> 02:11:58,602
"When you loose someone
special to you here on Earth,

2392
02:11:58,603 --> 02:11:59,967
"you gain a powerful angel

2393
02:11:59,967 --> 02:12:03,050
"fighting for you on the other side."

2394
02:12:05,033 --> 02:12:09,700
So I'm happy to know that I
have the most powerful angel

2395
02:12:10,914 --> 02:12:12,581
fighting for me now.

2396
02:12:13,788 --> 02:12:14,932
- [Together] Thank you G-ma

2397
02:12:14,932 --> 02:12:18,234
for teaching our new mama how to cook.

2398
02:12:18,234 --> 02:12:21,844
- I know that my family and
I share a different religion

2399
02:12:21,844 --> 02:12:26,379
than all of you, but I
think it's safe to say that,

2400
02:12:26,379 --> 02:12:31,046
we all know what it's like
to lose someone that we love.

2401
02:12:31,892 --> 02:12:34,528
Angel and I had a lot in common,

2402
02:12:34,528 --> 02:12:39,528
(laughs) a lot more than I
ever wanted to admit to myself.

2403
02:12:40,383 --> 02:12:43,840
We are both mothers who (crying)

2404
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:46,507
to children that we didn't birth

2405
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:52,437
and it wasn't until after
talking to Angel that

2406
02:12:54,796 --> 02:12:56,007
I learned the true meaning

2407
02:12:56,007 --> 02:12:58,840
of loving someone unconditionally.

2408
02:13:01,552 --> 02:13:05,052
Loving someone so much despite their flaws

2409
02:13:08,743 --> 02:13:13,660
and despite them not being yours. (crying)

2410
02:13:16,615 --> 02:13:21,032
Angel, thank you for making
me see the value of life,

2411
02:13:22,359 --> 02:13:25,859
the value of love and the value of family.

2412
02:13:28,951 --> 02:13:31,701
I will forever be in debt to you.

2413
02:13:34,589 --> 02:13:38,422
- You know, I didn't
know Mama Angel that long

2414
02:13:42,112 --> 02:13:46,445
and I wish I woulda got
more time to spend with her,

2415
02:13:48,568 --> 02:13:52,999
but the time that we did spend
was some of the best moments

2416
02:13:52,999 --> 02:13:57,975
that I'll cherish forever. (crying)

2417
02:13:57,975 --> 02:14:02,975
She was always so loving
and kind. (crying)

2418
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:08,340
She opened up her home and her heart to me

2419
02:14:09,546 --> 02:14:12,796
and taught me the true value of family.

2420
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:20,327
I'm gonna miss you, Angel.

2421
02:14:24,679 --> 02:14:28,346
- My sister, she was a
gift, a gift from God

2422
02:14:34,458 --> 02:14:38,458
and she always held a
special place in my heart.

2423
02:14:42,271 --> 02:14:45,771
She was my mini-me when we were growing up

2424
02:14:50,944 --> 02:14:55,944
and I never thought, I
never thought (crying)

2425
02:15:06,412 --> 02:15:11,245
I never thought that she would
leave this earth before me,

2426
02:15:14,068 --> 02:15:16,901
but God, you called my Angel home.

2427
02:15:20,909 --> 02:15:24,076
(gentle somber music)

2428
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:34,970
(sighs)

2429
02:15:35,911 --> 02:15:39,828
- When the boys asked me
to deliver the eulogy,

2430
02:15:46,746 --> 02:15:49,413
I was afraid, but I was honored.

2431
02:15:55,373 --> 02:15:57,790
Now I had to ask myself, what

2432
02:15:58,974 --> 02:16:02,224
what can you say about a woman so great

2433
02:16:05,694 --> 02:16:07,361
as my sister, Angel?

2434
02:16:12,353 --> 02:16:17,353
(sniff) I um, my sister,
she was the baby. (laughs)

2435
02:16:18,917 --> 02:16:21,834
But she was the bossy one.

2436
02:16:21,834 --> 02:16:23,751
I mean, she was special

2437
02:16:26,346 --> 02:16:31,025
and as a little girl, she
would always remind me,

2438
02:16:31,025 --> 02:16:33,581
she would always say, "My name is Angel

2439
02:16:33,581 --> 02:16:38,581
"and my sister is Heaven
and we are special (laughs)

2440
02:16:39,628 --> 02:16:43,841
"and you just Roy." (laughs)

2441
02:16:43,841 --> 02:16:47,174
But hey, she's, she was my little sister

2442
02:16:48,593 --> 02:16:52,168
so I just let her say
what she wanted to say

2443
02:16:52,168 --> 02:16:53,751
because I love her.

2444
02:16:56,465 --> 02:16:57,382
I love her.

2445
02:17:01,325 --> 02:17:03,137
You see my sister was special because

2446
02:17:03,137 --> 02:17:05,054
she was made different.

2447
02:17:07,301 --> 02:17:10,759
You know, she was made kinda like her

2448
02:17:10,759 --> 02:17:13,783
world famous banana pudding.

2449
02:17:13,783 --> 02:17:15,342
I mean, there's so many ingredients,

2450
02:17:15,342 --> 02:17:19,902
so many layers, but she was
still the sweetest thing

2451
02:17:19,902 --> 02:17:23,152
you ever come across, but my son, R.J.,

2452
02:17:27,546 --> 02:17:30,545
and he would call it Nana's Pudding

2453
02:17:30,545 --> 02:17:33,462
and everybody loved Nana's Pudding.

2454
02:17:34,350 --> 02:17:38,600
I mean there was just
something about that pudding.

2455
02:17:40,122 --> 02:17:43,853
You know when I was thinking
about my sister last night,

2456
02:17:43,853 --> 02:17:47,191
I thought there had to
be something in that,

2457
02:17:47,191 --> 02:17:50,311
I mean to make people that excited,

2458
02:17:50,311 --> 02:17:51,690
there had to be something in that

2459
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:55,639
that we could take away
today for ourselves

2460
02:17:55,639 --> 02:17:57,306
and add to our lives

2461
02:17:59,966 --> 02:18:01,966
and remember her always.

2462
02:18:05,863 --> 02:18:09,530
You see, in cooking,
there are three stages.

2463
02:18:11,464 --> 02:18:13,881
First you have the prep time.

2464
02:18:14,874 --> 02:18:18,018
Now first you have the prep time

2465
02:18:18,018 --> 02:18:21,860
and that's when you, that's
when you set the temperature

2466
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:23,010
and when you're making a banana pudding,

2467
02:18:23,010 --> 02:18:27,593
you gotta make sure that the
oven is warmed in advance.

2468
02:18:28,964 --> 02:18:31,714
Then, then you got the cook time.

2469
02:18:32,682 --> 02:18:36,265
That's when God is
working, working with us

2470
02:18:37,220 --> 02:18:39,345
and getting us in that space,

2471
02:18:39,345 --> 02:18:41,946
that's when God is getting us situated

2472
02:18:41,946 --> 02:18:46,257
so that we and we're
prepped for this life.

2473
02:18:46,257 --> 02:18:47,090
We live.

2474
02:18:48,644 --> 02:18:50,529
I want somebody to turn
to your neighbors and say,

2475
02:18:50,529 --> 02:18:53,362
"It is time for somebody to live."

2476
02:18:54,452 --> 02:18:56,730
- [Group] It is time for somebody to live.

2477
02:18:56,730 --> 02:19:01,089
- Yes, and we ask, we ask
what are those ingredients

2478
02:19:01,089 --> 02:19:05,422
that we are needed to give
us that expected outcome?

2479
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:09,197
First we have flour.

2480
02:19:10,113 --> 02:19:11,444
Now flour is in the Bible.

2481
02:19:11,444 --> 02:19:14,611
Now flour represents the truth of God.

2482
02:19:15,489 --> 02:19:19,489
Now God, God will pour
that flour into a sifter.

2483
02:19:21,846 --> 02:19:23,732
Amen and some of y'all don't,

2484
02:19:23,732 --> 02:19:26,372
y'all don't know the point of the sifter.

2485
02:19:26,372 --> 02:19:31,338
Now the sifter will separate
all of the clumps of our life,

2486
02:19:31,338 --> 02:19:34,626
all of the arrogance, all of the anger,

2487
02:19:34,626 --> 02:19:36,609
all of the uptight-ness.

2488
02:19:36,609 --> 02:19:39,942
See, God, he would pour us into a sifter

2489
02:19:42,499 --> 02:19:44,249
and we come out fine.

2490
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,351
I want you to look at somebody and say,

2491
02:19:49,351 --> 02:19:51,434
"You, you, you are fine."

2492
02:19:55,953 --> 02:19:58,698
- [Group] You are fine.
(laughing)

2493
02:19:58,698 --> 02:20:01,954
Now my sister never judged anybody.

2494
02:20:01,954 --> 02:20:03,897
she just had a way of sifting

2495
02:20:03,897 --> 02:20:06,814
all of that stuff out of your life.

2496
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:12,743
Then you have sugar, pure cane sugar.

2497
02:20:14,563 --> 02:20:16,223
Now the sugar,

2498
02:20:16,223 --> 02:20:20,194
what that represented
was the boost of energy.

2499
02:20:20,194 --> 02:20:22,402
Now look, I know that,

2500
02:20:22,402 --> 02:20:25,569
I know that sometimes we all get down,

2501
02:20:26,866 --> 02:20:29,469
but there was just something
about when Angel came around

2502
02:20:29,469 --> 02:20:30,406
with that banana pudding,

2503
02:20:30,406 --> 02:20:33,573
would just give you a boost of energy.

2504
02:20:34,436 --> 02:20:38,186
It was hard to be around
her and still be sad

2505
02:20:40,742 --> 02:20:43,117
'cause just like her sweet banana pudding,

2506
02:20:43,117 --> 02:20:45,200
she was a ball of energy.

2507
02:20:51,314 --> 02:20:52,147
Salt.

2508
02:20:53,846 --> 02:20:56,065
Salt is of the Earth.

2509
02:20:56,065 --> 02:21:00,543
Now we use salt to preserve
our covenant with God.

2510
02:21:00,543 --> 02:21:05,543
(laughs) Now my sister,
she was big on the church.

2511
02:21:06,902 --> 02:21:09,906
You can ask her boys
that now, she was serious

2512
02:21:09,906 --> 02:21:12,700
when it came to waking up
in time for church. (laughs)

2513
02:21:12,700 --> 02:21:14,562
She would always say, "I'm gonna make sure

2514
02:21:14,562 --> 02:21:16,710
"that they have a strong
foundation with God.

2515
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:18,531
"I'm gonna make sure that they maintain

2516
02:21:18,531 --> 02:21:20,022
"and preserve that foundation

2517
02:21:20,022 --> 02:21:21,257
"because I'm gonna keep them in church."

2518
02:21:21,257 --> 02:21:22,257
And she did.

2519
02:21:24,498 --> 02:21:28,831
But most importantly, she
preserved the word of God.

2520
02:21:33,222 --> 02:21:37,241
So when she dropped that
salt in her pudding,

2521
02:21:37,241 --> 02:21:40,324
she was saying, there are some things

2522
02:21:41,619 --> 02:21:44,952
that we, some stuff we need to preserve.

2523
02:21:47,369 --> 02:21:49,024
Now I know that there
are some of y'all here

2524
02:21:49,024 --> 02:21:52,614
that are hunkered down
because she no longer with us,

2525
02:21:52,614 --> 02:21:56,447
but you need to know
that that merengue on top

2526
02:21:57,426 --> 02:22:01,782
was important and she
took the yolk from an egg

2527
02:22:01,782 --> 02:22:05,449
and she made that
merengue light and fluffy.

2528
02:22:06,818 --> 02:22:10,009
You see it's no coincidence
that we loved this dish

2529
02:22:10,009 --> 02:22:12,281
because each time she was ministering us

2530
02:22:12,281 --> 02:22:14,198
every time she made it.

2531
02:22:15,113 --> 02:22:19,202
She was saying, "Baby, I'm
making your stress light.

2532
02:22:19,202 --> 02:22:21,952
"I'm making your situation easy."

2533
02:22:26,738 --> 02:22:31,321
And when you think about it,
Angel really was an angel.

2534
02:22:35,978 --> 02:22:38,953
I mean, she was just like Jesus.

2535
02:22:38,953 --> 02:22:41,260
I mean she was loving
us and not judging us

2536
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:44,260
and just being what she needed to be

2537
02:22:45,676 --> 02:22:47,138
and even in her transition,

2538
02:22:47,138 --> 02:22:50,223
she made sure she did not
leave these boys uncovered.

2539
02:22:50,223 --> 02:22:54,649
She taught Malachi how
to make a banana pudding.

2540
02:22:54,649 --> 02:22:58,252
She taught Xavier, she taught Elijah,

2541
02:22:58,252 --> 02:23:00,919
she taught David and even Dylan.

2542
02:23:03,807 --> 02:23:07,228
She made sure that even in her absence,

2543
02:23:07,228 --> 02:23:12,076
that we all had what we
needed to keep moving forward.

2544
02:23:12,076 --> 02:23:16,159
Ezekiel 16:13 and then
I'm gonna close with that.

2545
02:23:21,817 --> 02:23:25,484
Thou eats from fine
flour and honey and oils

2546
02:23:29,474 --> 02:23:33,049
and when you mix all that together,

2547
02:23:33,049 --> 02:23:36,783
you've got something exceedingly beautiful

2548
02:23:36,783 --> 02:23:39,950
and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.

2549
02:23:43,010 --> 02:23:44,354
When she made her banana pudding,

2550
02:23:44,354 --> 02:23:45,964
she only used three bananas,

2551
02:23:45,964 --> 02:23:47,487
one for the Father, one for the Son

2552
02:23:47,487 --> 02:23:49,737
and one for the Holy Ghost.

2553
02:23:50,763 --> 02:23:55,625
And if your vision, if your
dream is all about you,

2554
02:23:55,625 --> 02:23:57,292
then it's too small.

2555
02:23:58,502 --> 02:24:02,252
Now she took the bananas
like Jesus took fish

2556
02:24:04,073 --> 02:24:05,692
and if I give you fish, you will eat,

2557
02:24:05,692 --> 02:24:08,317
but tomorrow you will come back hungry,

2558
02:24:08,317 --> 02:24:10,537
but if I could teach you how to fish,

2559
02:24:10,537 --> 02:24:14,204
then you can feed and
take care of yourself.

2560
02:24:16,585 --> 02:24:17,570
You all need to listen to me,

2561
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:21,015
when Angel shared her
recipe with those boys,

2562
02:24:21,015 --> 02:24:23,055
she was making sure that they could

2563
02:24:23,055 --> 02:24:27,532
take care of themselves
and survive in her absence.

2564
02:24:27,532 --> 02:24:29,246
Not only did she make sure
those boys was covered,

2565
02:24:29,246 --> 02:24:30,939
but she made sure that for generations,

2566
02:24:30,939 --> 02:24:34,522
her family would be
loved, blessed and fed.

2567
02:24:42,663 --> 02:24:46,155
Y'all should hear her right now.

2568
02:24:46,155 --> 02:24:50,238
Say well, well, well.
(clapping)

2569
02:24:55,922 --> 02:24:57,922
(sighs)

2570
02:25:00,171 --> 02:25:03,088
Look uh, if there's any of you here

2571
02:25:05,477 --> 02:25:08,227
in this time, in this moment that

2572
02:25:09,867 --> 02:25:13,166
that your vision, your
dream is just about you

2573
02:25:13,166 --> 02:25:15,723
and nobody else, then I encourage you

2574
02:25:15,723 --> 02:25:18,056
to be like Angel and change.

2575
02:25:21,685 --> 02:25:23,102
And to my sister,

2576
02:25:25,765 --> 02:25:27,598
my sister, I love you.

2577
02:25:30,677 --> 02:25:35,094
(crying) I love you for who you are.

2578
02:25:39,845 --> 02:25:44,178
I pray, I pray that you
rest forever and have peace.

2579
02:25:49,082 --> 02:25:52,249
(gentle somber music)

2580
02:25:57,350 --> 02:25:59,813
- This funeral is so damn long.

2581
02:25:59,813 --> 02:26:02,597
Who does she think she
is, Aretha Franklin?

2582
02:26:02,597 --> 02:26:04,847
(laughing)

2583
02:26:07,189 --> 02:26:10,443
- This next selection is coming from

2584
02:26:10,443 --> 02:26:12,443

All right, with our heads held high.

2643
02:30:34,242 --> 02:30:38,095
That's what mama would
have wanted us to do.

2644
02:30:38,095 --> 02:30:42,928
She would of, she would of
wanted us to be strong for her.

2645
02:30:44,380 --> 02:30:46,463
(crying)

2646
02:30:48,930 --> 02:30:52,263
- I didn't even get to say goodbye, man.

2647
02:30:53,394 --> 02:30:55,771
(crying)

2648
02:30:55,771 --> 02:30:58,604
I didn't get to make things right.

2649
02:30:59,563 --> 02:31:01,730
(sobbing)

2650
02:31:19,052 --> 02:31:21,719
- She knew where your heart was.

2651
02:31:23,638 --> 02:31:25,888
Now she's looking over you.

2652
02:31:28,195 --> 02:31:30,278
- Looking over all of us.

2653
02:31:32,132 --> 02:31:33,286
- Stop all that crying, man,

2654
02:31:33,286 --> 02:31:35,817
before you have us all in here crying.

2655
02:31:35,817 --> 02:31:40,556
- (laughs) Like we did when
we lost that talent show.

2656
02:31:40,556 --> 02:31:41,756
Y'all remember that?

2657
02:31:41,756 --> 02:31:43,436
(groups laughs)
- Right.

2658
02:31:43,436 --> 02:31:46,397
Shit it was Elijah fault
hitting all the wrong notes.

2659
02:31:46,397 --> 02:31:48,726
(laughing)
(group chattering)

2660
02:31:48,726 --> 02:31:50,502
- No, no, now come on, Zay,

2661
02:31:50,502 --> 02:31:52,889
it was you missing all them steps, man.

2662
02:31:52,889 --> 02:31:55,160
You were so nervous.

2663
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:57,100
- Hey, I messed up some steps,

2664
02:31:57,100 --> 02:31:59,647
but who got us that record deal though?

2665
02:31:59,647 --> 02:32:01,757
(groaning)

2666
02:32:01,757 --> 02:32:03,091
- Hey that's a good point.

2667
02:32:03,091 --> 02:32:04,614
(laughs)

2668
02:32:04,614 --> 02:32:09,530
- Yeah, sometimes I wonder
if we woulda kept going,

2669
02:32:09,530 --> 02:32:13,181
I wonder if we woulda really made it big.

2670
02:32:13,181 --> 02:32:14,899
- Yeah, I mean, I do miss performing

2671
02:32:14,899 --> 02:32:16,685
on stage with all my brothers.

2672
02:32:16,685 --> 02:32:17,518
- Really?

2673
02:32:18,388 --> 02:32:19,221
'Cause the way I remember,

2674
02:32:19,221 --> 02:32:22,900
you didn't like sharing the spotlight.

2675
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:24,567
- You got locked up.

2676
02:32:25,507 --> 02:32:26,813
You went to jail.

2677
02:32:26,813 --> 02:32:27,942
You ruined the group.

2678
02:32:27,942 --> 02:32:30,067
- So it's my fault?

2679
02:32:30,067 --> 02:32:31,626
- Stop!

2680
02:32:31,626 --> 02:32:35,293
Fellas, just stop, stop
this right now, man.

2681
02:32:36,329 --> 02:32:38,598
Damn, I mean, it's been years.

2682
02:32:38,598 --> 02:32:41,347
Y'all need to handle this shit
right now, once and for all.

2683
02:32:41,347 --> 02:32:43,325
- Exactly, come on man,

2684
02:32:43,325 --> 02:32:45,786
it was Dylan's dream to begin with.

2685
02:32:45,786 --> 02:32:47,839
Xavier, you can't keep
holding a grudge, man,

2686
02:32:47,839 --> 02:32:50,575
like he was supposed to
hold up his dream for you?

2687
02:32:50,575 --> 02:32:52,377
- I mean, if anything,
mama woulda wanted us

2688
02:32:52,377 --> 02:32:54,812
to put this to rest.

2689
02:32:54,812 --> 02:32:56,062
Can we do that?

2690
02:32:57,234 --> 02:32:59,234
- I just wanted my shot.

2691
02:33:01,161 --> 02:33:02,454
I just wanted my shot.

2692
02:33:02,454 --> 02:33:04,758
You promised me an
audition when I got out.

2693
02:33:04,758 --> 02:33:07,782
- And I did everything I
could to give you that.

2694
02:33:07,782 --> 02:33:09,273
I'm sorry I led you on.

2695
02:33:09,273 --> 02:33:10,273
I really am.

2696
02:33:13,723 --> 02:33:16,973
But I just really want my brother back.

2697
02:33:22,138 --> 02:33:24,138
- Xavier, come on, brah.

2698
02:33:28,888 --> 02:33:29,888
- I'm sorry.

2699
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:37,017
(clears throat)

2700
02:33:44,692 --> 02:33:47,859
I'm sorry for holding you responsible.

2701
02:33:52,948 --> 02:33:55,615
(clears throat)

2702
02:33:59,956 --> 02:34:03,706
And not taking accountability
for my actions.

2703
02:34:08,424 --> 02:34:09,257
Look man,

2704
02:34:11,524 --> 02:34:14,021
I got into some trouble

2705
02:34:14,021 --> 02:34:16,938
and I messed up the group contract.

2706
02:34:18,783 --> 02:34:20,200
I'm sorry, y'all.

2707
02:34:23,584 --> 02:34:24,417
You know,

2708
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:28,913
you just (sighs)

2709
02:34:28,913 --> 02:34:31,781
it just eats at me every time knowing that

2710
02:34:31,781 --> 02:34:33,698
my life decisions, man.

2711
02:34:37,528 --> 02:34:40,361
You know, Dylan, I'm proud of you.

2712
02:34:41,679 --> 02:34:42,679
I really am.

2713
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:47,063
You know, no matter what,

2714
02:34:48,257 --> 02:34:51,193
no matter what I've ever said to you, man,

2715
02:34:51,193 --> 02:34:55,610
you still my brother and I
accept you for who you are

2716
02:35:00,366 --> 02:35:03,033
'cause you've always accepted me

2717
02:35:04,671 --> 02:35:06,171
and uh, thank you.

2718
02:35:13,948 --> 02:35:14,865
- For what?

2719
02:35:16,792 --> 02:35:20,792
- For the child support
payments over the years.

2720
02:35:23,441 --> 02:35:25,691
Mama told me it wasn't her.

2721
02:35:27,966 --> 02:35:32,466
- I just wanted to make sure
that my brother was okay.

2722
02:35:37,409 --> 02:35:38,909
- Thank you, damn.

2723
02:35:40,625 --> 02:35:42,958
It's about damn time, Jesus.

2724
02:35:45,665 --> 02:35:48,111
- So now you know Jesus?

2725
02:35:48,111 --> 02:35:49,662
(laughing)
(sighs)

2726
02:35:49,662 --> 02:35:51,342
Zay apologized and he know Jesus now.

2727
02:35:51,342 --> 02:35:52,613
That's where we at, guys.

2728

Chill man, you know what I meant.

2731
02:35:56,748 --> 02:35:59,386
- Yeah, we know what you meant, Michael.

2732
02:35:59,386 --> 02:36:02,330
(laughing)
- Shut up, punk.

2733
02:36:02,330 --> 02:36:04,028
(laughing)
Oh you all got jokes.

2734
02:36:04,028 --> 02:36:05,037
Okay, okay.

2735
02:36:05,037 --> 02:36:07,287
- Hey man, ain't being part of (mumbling)

02:36:07,287 --> 02:36:08,137
That's all I'm saying.

2737
02:36:08,137 --> 02:36:09,949
- That's good, I got someone to call.

2738
02:36:09,949 --> 02:36:13,366
(laughing)
- Shit, homey.

2739
02:36:14,954 --> 02:36:15,871

- This is preparation
for something bigger.

02:37:39,138 --> 02:37:40,805
Just think about it,

2764
02:37:41,706 --> 02:37:45,606
all those kids somewhere,
they're out watching you.
