[Narrator] Once upon a time,

6
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:27,420
there was a handsome
prince named Alex.

7
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:32,059
One day, an evil witch
turned him into a mouse

8
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:35,428
and replaced him with a
fake prince named Olaf.

9
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:39,967
But then, came a brave and
resourceful woman named Ella

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,168
to Alex's rescue.

11
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,569
Along with her friends,

12
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:46,774
a sorcerer named Crystal
and a pair of mice

13
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:48,408
named Walter and Manny

14
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:52,178
joined forces to defeat
the evil witch and Olaf.

15
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:56,416
However, just as
she was defeated,

16
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:00,386
the wicked witch mustered
her magic one last time

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,289
and turned Ella into stone.

18
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:08,294
Looking at all Ella
sacrificed for him,

19
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:10,396
Alex gave up his human body

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,233
so that Ella could
come back to life

21
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:15,536
becoming a mouse once more.

22
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:21,308
Now, Ella and her
friends search every day

23
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:24,679
to figure out a way
to restore Alex.

way to break Alex's curse.

What?

36
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:13,595
Really, how?

37
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:16,198
We need some
special ingredients.

38
00:02:16,232 --> 00:02:17,332
Ingredients?

39
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:19,201
Then, we'll extract
the magic potion

40
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:21,203
and turn Alex back into a human.

41
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:22,570
Hmm.

42
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:25,273
Okay Crystal, tell
me what you need.

00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:28,510
Hmm, it says here in this book

44
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:30,913
that we first need
a black feather.

00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:34,482
Ella needs a black feather.

Ella needs some
black feathers.

Ella needs lots
of black feathers.

49
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,124
I don't have any
black feathers.

50
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:43,092

So how do you feel?

00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,474
I feel a bit strange,

didn't drink it.

drink the entire pot

Wait, I think I
know what happened.

96

The reason it failed is

97
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,358
because I'm only an
apprentice sorcerer.

98

should we do now?

00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:55,166
[Dr. Know-it-all] The
Lifestone is hidden away

189
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,068
in a forest castle on the
other side of the ocean.

190
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,805
The Guardian of the
Forest uses the Lifestone

191
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,840
to nurture life.

192
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,844
And she is not gonna
hand it over easily.

193
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,014
Oh you.

194
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,788
Dr, Know-it-all, we hear
that you're the wisest person

195
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:18,457
in the entire world.

196
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:20,892
Hmm.

197
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:23,462
And always helping others.

198
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,631
Will you please help us?

199
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:26,498
Mmm.

200
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,434
Please?

201
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,137
Mmm, helping you

202
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,873
would mean provoking the
Guardian of the Forest.

203
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:37,576
Don't believe
him, he's a liar.

204
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:39,378
Right, I'm a liar.

205
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,880
Now get outta here, get out now.

206
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,448
I've said too much.

207
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:44,516
Now leave me alone.

208
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:46,451
Shoo, shoo.

209
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,589
Please doctor, our
friend needs your help.

210
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:50,923
Please help us.

211
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,261
You're back.

212
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:57,363
Hmm, get outta here.

213
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:03,136
Oh.

214
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,905
Well that was the rudest
turtle I've ever met.

215
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:07,540
How many turtles have you met?

216
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,110
Just one.

217
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:15,214
Please doctor, we
really need your help.

218
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,051
Come on.

219
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:20,721
I don't think that
turtle knows anything.

220
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:23,222
Our friend
desperately needs help.

221
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:24,824
Ella, let's go.

222
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:27,126
He's just an ornery old hermit.

223
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:28,828
Please.

224
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:36,270
[Dr. Know-it-all] There's
a cloud in the backyard

225
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:38,539
that can take you
across the ocean.

226
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,373
[Dr. Know-it-all laughs evilly]

227
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:40,507
But good luck

228
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,042
convincing him to help you.

229
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,082
Dr. Know-it-all,

230
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,184
I wish you success
on your marathon.

231
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:52,319
Hope you win three
championships.

232
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:56,557
A turtle winning a marathon?

233
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,192
That sounds ridiculous.

234
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,128
Maybe he'll turn
into a book and fly.

235
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:05,866
[mysterious music]

236
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,808
Look at the sky, not
a cloud in sight.

237
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:16,043
Finding a cloud
on a day like this

238
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:19,313
is about as likely as a
turtle winning a foot race.

239
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,883
You don't think that turtle
is pulling our leg, do you?

240
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,053
I don't think so.

241
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,423
Come on, let's take a break.

242
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,658
I'm tired.

243
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,326
You guys can keep looking.

244
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,361
[Manny yells]

245
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:34,396
Manny, oh.

246
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:43,505
[Crystal and Ella gasping]

247
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,339
[Walter gulps]

248
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:46,207
It's got a tail

249
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,343
and a nose and a mouth, too.

250
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:49,444
It's a monster.

251
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,613
[cloud yelling]

252
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,182
Manny got eaten by the monster.

253
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:58,086
Let me go.

254
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,756
Let me go, you
big pile of fluff.

255
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,257
[Cloud] Uh oh.

256
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,428
There really is a cloud
and you must be him.

257
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,663
I'll show you.

258
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,500
[cloud giggling]

259
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,235
Hey, give me back my wand.

260
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:17,206
[cloud and Crystal grunting]

261
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:25,047
[cloud giggling]

262
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:29,151
[Crystal yelling]

263
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:34,390
[cloud giggling]
[Crystal grunting]

264
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,031
Crystal!

265
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:43,065
[Manny and Walter groaning]

266
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:45,034
[cloud grumbling]

267
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:48,003
Okay cloud, game on.

268
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,306
I'm gonna make you pay.

269
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,507
[cloud moaning]

270
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,342
Take that and that

271
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,978
and a little bit of this

272
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:58,013
and some more of that.

273
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,450
Crystal, stop.

274
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,820
We still need him to
take us across the ocean.

275
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,856
Watch me tame him.

276
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,658
[cloud groaning]

277
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:16,701
- Good job, Crystal.
- Good job, Crystal.

278
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:20,604
[cloud growling]

279
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:29,680
I won't go easy
on you this time.

280
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:33,416
[electricity snapping]

281
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,084
Crystal.

282
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:35,218
What do we do now?

283
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:38,656
[groaning]

284
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,095
[cloud growling]

285
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:48,700
[Crystal] Stay,
stay away from me.

286
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:50,802
Stop.

287
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:53,604
No, no, no, no.

288
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:56,742
I know you are a good boy.

289
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:57,743
Huh?

290
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,912
You don't mean to harm us.

291
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:02,781
You just want to
play with us, right?

292
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,684
Uh huh.

293
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:08,085
Look at this.

294
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:11,723
Ready?

295
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,592
Go fetch.

296
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:16,895
[Cloud] Wee.

297
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,730
[cloud giggling]

298
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:21,566
[bright music]

299
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:26,103
Catch.

300
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,308
Oh, good boy.

301
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:32,711
You're so sweet.

302
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:38,083
We'd like to cross the ocean.

303
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:39,451
Can you take us there?

304
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,520
Uh huh.

305
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:42,554
Ella.

306
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:45,190
[Ella] From now on
we'll call you snowball.

307
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:46,358
[Walter] Yay.

308
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:48,627
Welcome to the crew, Snowball.

309
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:49,862
[Ella] Crystal,

310
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:50,730
over here.

311
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:55,802
[uplifting music]

312
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,699
Never dreamed of a day
that a mouse could fly.

313
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,871
I hope every vacation
is as great as this one.

314
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:32,873
Hold on, Alex.

315
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:33,774
We're coming.

316
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:36,110
Crystal.

317
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:37,243
Crystal.

318
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,521
Isn't the view stunning?

319
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:51,892
What's wrong?

320
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:53,259
You look sad.

321
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:58,766
I just feel like,

322
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,835
like I haven't been any
help since the start.

323
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,303
What do you mean?

324
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:07,573
Without you, we wouldn't
have found Dr. Know-It-All.

325
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:12,379
But you are the one who
convinced them to help us.

326
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:18,252
You used your magic to protect
us every step of the way.

327
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:21,823
Yeah.

328
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:23,223
Magic.

329
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:25,860
[gentle music]

330
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:31,966
Ever since I was
little, I loved magic.

331
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,169
Loved it so much.

332
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:37,872
I've always wanted to
become a real sorcerer.

333
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:41,308
Ever since my master left,

334
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:44,211
I started to practice on my own.

335
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:46,280
But no matter how hard I tried,

336
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,917
I just wasn't getting it.

337
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:51,920
After all these years,

338
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:54,621
I'm still just an apprentice.

339
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,125
Crystal, what are
you talking about?

340
00:17:57,158 --> 00:18:00,395
You're going to be a
great sorcerer one day.

341
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:04,200
This magic wand looks so
out of place in my hand.

342
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:06,468
No wonder I can
never hold onto it.

343
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,474
Maybe I should just stop
daydreaming and quit magic.

344
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,011
[gasping]

345
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:21,917
Snowball, quickly, fetch.

346
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,688
[all gasping]

347
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:35,030
[Ella yelling]

348
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,734
[gentle music]

349
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:39,902
Ella, are you okay?

350
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,738
What were you thinking?

351
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:43,973
You could have died.

352
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:49,880
A magic wand is the most
important thing for a sorcerer.

353
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,683
But even if I
had a magic wand,

354
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,019
I would never become
a great sorcerer.

355
00:18:57,954 --> 00:18:59,388
When I was little,

356
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,725
my dad once told me

357
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:05,461
that nobody knows who they will
become before they grow up.

358
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,500
Thanks Ella.

359
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,909
I am sure you're gonna
be a great sorcerer.

360
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,912
[gentle music]

361
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:23,479
Oh yeah, Crystal.

362
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:26,016
We definitely second that.

363
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,851
You're allowed to fall.

364
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:29,485
It's what we all do,

365
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:32,889
but what's really important
is how we pick ourselves up.

366
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,829
Friends, we're are all
gonna achieve our dreams.

367
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,898
Yes, we will.

368
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:43,968
[uplifting music]

369
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,086
[Walter] Snowball,
we're gonna miss you.

370
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:05,990
Thank you for ride.

371
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:07,357
Goodbye for now.

372
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:15,465
Hope we get fly like
that again one day.

373
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,168
[Tree] Oh, can I come along?

374
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:18,035
Sure.

375
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:23,374
I wanna try too.

376
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:26,245
- Ah, a talking tree!
- A talking tree!

377
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:27,079
[screams]

378
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:28,379
Mice can't talk.

379
00:20:28,412 --> 00:20:29,214
Stay back.

380
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:30,215
Get away.

381
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:31,917
What is that?

382
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,653
I'm the forest guide
around these parts.

383
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:38,223
We're looking for the
palace of the forest.

384
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:39,758
Can you show us the way?

385
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:41,860
Of course.

386
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:43,962
But how did you hear
about this place?

387
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:47,498
Dr. Know-It-All told us.

388
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:50,769
Know-It-All, that champion
from the great forest marathon?

389
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,871
You know him?

390
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:54,840
Of course.

391
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:56,507
I came in second
place in that race.

392
00:20:57,843 --> 00:20:58,442
That's great.

393
00:20:58,476 --> 00:20:59,477
Let's head out.

394
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:02,080
The forest is not far.

395
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:03,514
We'll get there in a bit.

396
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:05,416
Race you there.

397
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,085
I wanna race too.

398
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:13,458
Whatever you do,

399
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:15,028
don't get lost.

400
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:17,230
Ready.

401
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:18,097
Set, go!

402
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:24,469
[arms swishing]
[breathing heavily]

403
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:37,817
How are you guys
running so fast?

404
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,687
This is how fast
the second place runs?

405
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,323
What kinda race did you win?

406
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:45,191
I joined the slow run event.

407
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:47,393
Then the slow runner wins.

408
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:49,095
Woo.

409
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,698
[gentle music]

410
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:59,273
I know all the famous
landmarks around here.

411
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:01,208
What may look like nothing.

412
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,978
Oh, there look over there.

413
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:04,979
Over there.

414
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:06,814
That's Little Red
Riding Hood's forest.

415
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:10,384
I can take you guys to
get lost once for free.

416
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,086
Woo.

417
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,921
Yeah, enough already.

418
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:16,824
But we really need to get
to the palace in the forest.

419
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:19,460
What about the
tooth fairy lake?

420
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:21,862
Anyone wanna get tooth back?

421
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:25,199
No, we don't
wanna go anywhere.

422
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:28,068
[Tree] Oh, you'll definitely
wanna check this out.

423
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:29,269
Alice's rabbit hole.

424
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:31,005
There you can meet my cousin.

425
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,440
Just don't tell him how
Santa Claus' slay is made.

426
00:22:33,474 --> 00:22:34,507
- No.
- No.

427
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:38,412
I can't take this anymore.

428
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:39,645
Seriously.

429
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,149
How long is it gonna
take us to get there?

430
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,385
Here we are.

431
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,120
It's right ahead.

432
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:46,988
Woo.

433
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:48,490
We're here!

434
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:49,424
[bright music]

435
00:22:49,457 --> 00:22:50,291
What?

436
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,066
Where's the forest palace?

437
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:01,036
Mr. Tree, what's
going on here?

438
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,139
It's right over there.

439
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:13,681
Huh?

440
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,649
I see it, I see it.

441
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:18,887
But if the road to the palace

442
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,955
at the base of this mountain,

443
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:23,557
why did you bring us all
the way to the summit?

444
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,060
If we didn't come up here,

445
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:27,829
I'd never be able to show
you where the road goes.

446
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,835
Are you kidding me right now?

447
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:37,039
No need to thank me.

448
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:39,175
I can take you
guys there myself.

449
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,743
We'll get there in a bit.

450
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:42,610
See you later.

451
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:43,645
- Bye, thanks.
- Thanks, bye.

452
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,579
No worries.

453
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:46,749
Wouldn't take long at all.

454
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:48,684
Huh?

455
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:50,252
Where'd they go?

456
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:58,861
[soft music]

457
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:08,337
[Walter] Those
are some big guards.

458
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:11,740
We'll lure them away.

459
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:13,976
I wanna help.

460
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:22,184
Hi, we're here to see
the Guardian of the Forest.

461
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:24,121
Can you tell her we're here?

462
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:26,323
Her Highness, the
garden of the forest,

463
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:29,625
isn't going to see just any
riff raff off the street.

464
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:32,095
Oh, so that's how it is?

465
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:35,232
Especially a silly
girl with two mice.

466
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,201
That's the windy side.

467
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,269
Let's climb that way.

468
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:43,473
Stop right there.

469
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:45,242
What do you think you're doing?

470
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,044
[gentle music]

471
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,099
[Ella] Huh?

472
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,171
[gasping]

473
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:16,140
[mysterious music]

474
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,614
Oh.

475
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,751
[mysterious music]

476
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:36,260
[gentle music]

477
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,808
[gasping]

478
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:53,010
Who are you?

479
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:54,912
I'm, a.

480
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,584
You're a thief

481
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:00,252
who has come to steal
things, aren't you?

482
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:01,220
No, no, no.

483
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,187
I, I promise.

484
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:03,255
I'm not.

485
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:04,156
Let me explain.

486
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:04,790
I just...

487
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:06,124
Don't try to fool me.

488
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:08,060
I'm.

489
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,363
Because if you are.

490
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:15,234
That would be fantastic.

491
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:16,835
Wait, what?

492
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:17,836
Please steal me.

493
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,738
I can shine like the bright sun

494
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:22,341
and help light your way
in time of darkness.

495
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:25,577
That's nice of you,

496
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:28,780
but actually I'm
looking for, oh.

497
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:30,382
You should steal me.

498
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:37,456
[Ella] What is this?

499
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,928
Well, obviously this
is my head, silly.

500
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,402
Have some manners, please.

501
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:52,505
Please.

502
00:26:54,641 --> 00:26:56,242
You should take me.

503
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:57,877
I can protect you.

504
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:01,247
No thanks.

505
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:02,148
I'm good.

506
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:04,083
I'm actually looking
for something.

507
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:05,285
Can anyone help me find it?

508
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:07,520
[Genie] Did
someone call for me?

509
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:11,324
Who?

510
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:12,225
Who's that?

511
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:13,092
Oh.

512
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:17,297
My master, I'm a genie

513
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,998
who knows everything.

514
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:23,269
I can answer three
of your questions.

515
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,839
Shouldn't that
be three wishes?

516
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:29,309
Nope.

517
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:30,476
[Ella] Oh.

518
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,845
Next one.

519
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:34,315
Wait, that counts.

520
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,449
Yep.

521
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:37,786
You only have one question left.

522
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:39,320
Use it wisely.

523
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:42,923
Do you know where I
can find the Lifestone?

524
00:27:42,956 --> 00:27:45,259
Of course I do.

525
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:46,126
Where?

526
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:48,629
Ooh, sorry.

527
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:50,397
You ran out of questions.

528
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:51,632
Tata.

529
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,400
Wait, please don't go.

530
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:56,537
Well if you bring me with you,

531
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,474
I'll make an exception and
grant you one more wish.

532
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:01,542
Really?

533
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:02,543
[Magic Carpet]
Don't believe him.

534
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:04,713
- Oh.
- He knows nothing.

535
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:06,480
Oh.

536
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:07,348
Oh.

537
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:09,383
Oh.

538
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,624
[Magic Carpet] You are
definitely looking for me.

539
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:19,159
Wow.

540
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:21,195
[Magic Carpet] No one can
refuse a great meal from me.

541
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:25,300
That's nice of you, but
I'm not really hungry.

542
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,602
[Magic Carpet] That's okay
if you don't want to eat,

543
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:29,337
I can offer you
something to drink.

544
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:30,372
Oh.

545
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:31,005
Go away.

546
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,507
I found her first.

547
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,242
But I talked you her first.

548
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:36,712
- No, I saw her first.
- It's clear

549
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:38,146
that I'm the...

550
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:39,481
- Steal me.
- Steal me.

551
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,383
[Knight] You should steal me.

552
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:42,484
Me, me, me.

553
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:44,319
Please?

554
00:28:52,227 --> 00:28:55,029
[Bust] Oh my,
she's in big trouble.

555
00:28:56,531 --> 00:28:57,565
What is this place?

556
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,135
[screaming]

557
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:04,072
Oh, what is this thing?

558
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,475
Hey, who are you?

559
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:08,209
[Knight] Stop right there.

560
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:09,944
[Knight] Where did she go?

561
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:10,781
She's gone.

562
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,615
Look up there.

563
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:16,352
[dramatic music]

564
00:29:16,385 --> 00:29:18,554
[yelling]

565
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:27,496
Listen.

566
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:30,399
The queen is back.

567
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:31,400
Everyone go.

568
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:33,670
[clanking]

569
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,040
[frenzied music]

570
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,278
Excuse me.

571
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:44,647
- Do you where I...
- I beg your pardon.

572
00:29:48,117 --> 00:29:49,485
Don't just lie there.

573
00:29:49,518 --> 00:29:50,821
Quickly, follow me.

574
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:51,688
Huh?

575
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:07,037
[gentle music]

576
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,519
Such a pretty young thing.

577
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,055
And yet still a thief.

578
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:26,490
I'm not a thief.

579
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:30,527
Breaking into a house
while the master is out

580
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,429
and you deny being a thief.

581
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:35,198
Please, let me explain.

582
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:36,166
Ella!

583
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,501
Did you get the thing?

584
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:40,537
Don't worry, we'll
help you look.

585
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,572
[Forest Guardian]
Can I help you look?

586
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:43,406
All the better.

587
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,274
Thank you.

588
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:47,612
Care to explain anything else?

589
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,252
I think we walked
in the wrong house.

590
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:01,626
Let me go.

591
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,160
Let her go.

592
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,631
I'm gonna teach this forest
lady a lesson, that's what.

593
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,367
Are you threatening me?

594
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,578
[banging]

595
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,664
Please.

596
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,434
[Knight] Stop tickling me.

597
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,068
I apologize.

598
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,269
I'm sorry.

599
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,305
We only wanna borrow
the Lifestone.

600
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,675
You can do whatever
you want to punish me.

601
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,109
I beg you, please let them go.

602
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,112
Hm.

603
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,581
If you are here for the
Lifestone, you're too late.

604
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,483
The queen of desert
has already stolen it.

605
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:01,453
Oh no.

606
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,622
The Lifestone has been stolen?

607
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:07,125
Yes, and why on
earth do you need it?

608
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,495
We just wanna use the
Lifestone to save our friend.

609
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:14,033
Now that's a sweet
sounding excuse.

610
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,668
[Crystal] Ella, don't beg her.

611
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:18,136
I can be outta this myself.

612
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,639
A lot of spunk
for a little kid.

613
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:21,573
Hang on.

614
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,177
We can recover the
Lifestone for you.

615
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,213
Oh?

616
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:30,383
But in return, you
have to lend it to us.

617
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:34,187
The desert queen is too
powerful, even for me.

618
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,823
We have to save our friend.

619
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:37,057
Please let us try.

620
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:40,226
[gentle music]

621
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,295
That's a pretty good offer.

622
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,965
You've been worrying about
finding the Lifestone.

623
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:47,034
No one's been able to help.

624
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:48,736
You think they can?

625
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,740
There's no harm in trying.

626
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,477
There's no downside
for you at all.

627
00:32:58,544 --> 00:32:59,345
I agree.

628
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:05,518
[playful music]

629
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:11,860
Huh

630
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:14,829
You dare to mess with me.

631
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:19,466
Oh.

632
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,737
This map will guide
you to the desert palace.

633
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,740
And this?

634
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,777
It will keep an
eye on you for me.

635
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:31,545
Should you succeed,

636
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:33,682
I will help save your friend.

637
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,384
Deal.

638
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:39,888
Good luck.

639
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,595
Your Highness.

640
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:51,066
The Forest Guardian
has dispatched a party

641
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:54,301
to reclaim the
Lifestone from you.

642
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:58,506
The Forest Guardian couldn't
even defeat me herself.

643
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,676
And she thinks this rag tag,

644
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,880
bunch of kids can
take back the stone.

645
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:07,917
Are you not seeking a
sorcerer for your army?

646
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,020
One of the ones in that
bunch is an apprentice mage.

647
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:12,722
I can help you bring her in.

648
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,857
Hmm.

649
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,892
Not a bad idea.

650
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:20,129
And if I can convince
her to join you,

651
00:34:20,162 --> 00:34:22,865
that in exchange,
you can help me.

652
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,367
You want me to help
you retake your kingdom?

653
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:29,637
Yes, your majesty.

654
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,478
Very well.

655
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:38,848
I'll leave immediately.

656
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:44,854
[birds chirping]

657
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,556
Thank God for Ella

658
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,861
or we wouldn't have gotten
away from that Forest Guardian.

659
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:53,697
[gentle music]

660
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,041
Guys over here.

661
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,642
I think I found a shortcut.

662
00:35:06,676 --> 00:35:09,179
This could be a
much quicker way.

663
00:35:09,212 --> 00:35:10,947
What are we waiting for?

664
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:12,149
Let's get going.

665
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:13,016
Huh?

666
00:35:19,923 --> 00:35:20,924
Wait.

667
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:21,758
Hold on.

668
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:22,926
Don't go that way.

669
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:23,927
I can sense something.

670
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:27,329
Someone is spying on us.

671
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,166
Relax.

672
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,734
It'll be fine.

673
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:34,906
No, it won't be fine.

674
00:35:34,939 --> 00:35:36,140
None of this is fine.

675
00:35:36,174 --> 00:35:38,142
I'm worried for our safety.

676
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:39,944
Would you stop worrying?

677
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:42,146
We need to find the Lifestone.

678
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,817
[mysterious music]

679
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,884
Stop.

680
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:49,020
What's wrong?

681
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:51,756
[tense music]

682
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:55,893
Oh.

683
00:35:56,861 --> 00:35:58,229
Why do you think?

684
00:35:58,262 --> 00:36:00,497
That's squirrel is
conjured up by dark magic?

685
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,833
Ooh, maybe it is.

686
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:03,901
No need to worry, Crystal.

687
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:05,535
It's only a little squirrel.

688
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:07,437
But?

689
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,638
[tense music]

690
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:09,841
Watch out!

691
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:16,881
And that's gotta be a
flock of black magic birds.

692
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:18,282
Really?

693
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:20,284
Stop missing around, Crystal.

694
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:21,384
Let's go.

695
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:25,090
It's really dangerous here.

696
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:27,159
We have to take the other path.

697
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:29,328
How dangerous
can it possibly be?

698
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,831
Can you believe in a
sorcerer just for once?

699
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:36,467
Crystal, you don't have to
be so on guard all the time.

700
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,137
I can sense a really
strong power here.

701
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:40,772
We don't have time for this.

702
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:43,507
We have to get back to save
Alex as soon as we can.

703
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:46,745
You don't think
I wanna save Alex?

704
00:36:46,778 --> 00:36:50,749
Did you forget who's been
protecting us with magic?

705
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:53,986
But not everything
needs magic to solve it.

706
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,791
Crystal, I didn't mean that.

707
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,794
Looks like I'm
not needed here.

708
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:03,561
No, no.

709
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:05,330
I, I didn't mean that.

710
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:07,065
I'll leave now.

711
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:07,933
Crystal.

712
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:09,936
Don't touch me.

713
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:12,038
Crystal.

714
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:16,042
- Crystal, please don't go.
- Crystal,

715
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,310
please don't go.

716
00:37:17,343 --> 00:37:18,577
Come back.

717
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:21,413
Is she really
going to leave us?

718
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:22,782
I'm getting the feeling

719
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:25,517
that this path is
really dangerous.

720
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,787
[Walter] So now what do we do?

721
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:31,456
[Ella] We have to keep going.

722
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:36,561
Hmph.

723
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:48,374
Maybe we could find a place
to rest to continue tomorrow.

724
00:37:48,408 --> 00:37:50,710
I'm so hungry.

725
00:37:50,743 --> 00:37:53,313
I wish I had a nice Munster,

726
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:56,049
or cheddar, or provolone

727
00:37:56,082 --> 00:37:58,852
or even a mozzarella would do.

728
00:37:58,886 --> 00:37:59,987
Guys, guys,

729
00:38:01,587 --> 00:38:02,690
check it out.

730
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:06,760
[mysterious music]

731
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,929
Eh.

732
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:09,997
Eh?

733
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:16,236
I don't think we should go in.

734
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,237
Let's go.

735
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:18,638
Wait, where did you go?

736
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,410
Whoever owns this
place is really generous.

737
00:38:23,444 --> 00:38:26,013
Look at all this yummy food.

738
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:27,681
I can totally pig out here.

739
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:30,417
I'm starved skinny.

740
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:32,286
Need to replenish my physique.

741
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:33,821
Guys wait,

742
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,023
we need to say hello
to our host first.

743
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:39,659
Sounds good.

744
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,261
We can eat while we wait.

745
00:38:44,398 --> 00:38:45,700
- Ella!
- Ella!

746
00:38:47,668 --> 00:38:50,171
Welcome to Cat's kitchen.

747
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:53,875
[yelling]

748
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:58,013
Ha.

749
00:38:58,046 --> 00:38:59,080
Leaving so soon?

750
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:02,984
I insist you stay for dinner.

751
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:04,386
Oh, that's awesome.

752
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:05,920
There's a dinner.

753
00:39:05,954 --> 00:39:09,991
Stupid, we're gonna
be the first course.

754
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:11,226
Should I fry you

755
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:13,828
or grill you?

756
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:17,165
- Run!
- Uh oh.

757
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:20,168
[yelling]

758
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:22,971
[dramatic music]

759
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:40,189
Please, don't hurt him.

760
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,567
[Walter] You can't see me.

761
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,569
You can't see me.

762
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,405
You can't see me.

763
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,140
I'm a pumpkin.

764
00:39:58,174 --> 00:39:59,674
Oh, I'm a pumpkin.

765
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:11,520
I'm a pumpkin.

766
00:40:11,554 --> 00:40:14,323
[dramatic music]

767
00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:29,206
Ha ha.

768
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:45,255
You ate all my
pairing vegetables!

769
00:40:45,956 --> 00:40:48,024
So there's a main course too?

770
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,129
You'll see.

771
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:11,082
Eat.

772
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:17,989
That's delicious.

773
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,092
What's did you say?

774
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:24,395
Mm, this is the
best food I ever had.

775
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:28,966
Really?

776
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:31,903
Sure.

777
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,907
You are a true
gourmet connoisseur.

778
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,278
I wanna taste
anything but fish.

779
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:45,883
[soft music]

780
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,487
Mm, [speaking in
foreign language].

781
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,454
Mm.

782
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:52,723
With an unbelievable aftertaste.

783
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,331
I've long dreamed of
becoming a great chef,

784
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:00,966
but no one ever seems to know

785
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,368
how to appreciate my creations.

786
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:08,040
If you don't try,

787
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:10,776
you would never know
what you're capable of.

788
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:13,612
This doesn't sound like you.

789
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:15,380
[Walter] Ella told me.

790
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:26,558
Ever since I was
little, I loved magic.

791
00:42:26,592 --> 00:42:28,961
Loved it so much.

792
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:32,397
I've always wanted to
become a real sorcerer.

793
00:42:39,805 --> 00:42:42,274
How dare they doubt my magic.

794
00:42:43,008 --> 00:42:44,476
Who do they think they are?

795
00:42:46,913 --> 00:42:49,782
Did you forget who helped
you when you needed a hand?

796
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:58,391
Do you still
consider me a friend?

797
00:42:58,424 --> 00:43:01,027
[soft music]

798
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:09,869
Will they make it to
the castle without me?

799
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,313
Poor little girl, all alone.

800
00:43:20,346 --> 00:43:22,882
Olaf, stay away from me!

801
00:43:23,883 --> 00:43:26,419
Where did all your buddies go?

802
00:43:26,452 --> 00:43:27,954
Let's me guess,

803
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:30,423
they ditched you.

804
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:32,792
No, they didn't.

805
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:35,863
Don't kid yourself.

806
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:38,632
They only cared about
using your magic.

807
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:43,337
They denied your contributions
and even your magic skills.

808
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:47,641
As soon as they saw
your magic was useless,

809
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,343
they kicked you aside.

810
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:54,048
They don't care
about you at all.

811
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,484
It's not like that.

812
00:43:57,518 --> 00:43:59,420
Oh, how so?

813
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,423
They will come looking for me.

814
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,259
And yet they haven't,

815
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,928
all because you're an
apprentice sorcerer.

816
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:12,166
But if you were to
join the desert queen,

817
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:16,103
then that would be an
entirely different story.

818
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:19,873
The desert queen?

819
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,277
Do you think she
would understand me?

820
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:24,279
[laughs]

821
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:26,881
Not only would
she understand you,

822
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:29,884
she would see great
value in your potential.

823
00:44:31,453 --> 00:44:32,887
[Crystal] My potential?

824
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,323
That's right.

825
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:38,293
She possesses the most
powerful magic in the world

826
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:42,263
and can help you become
a real master sorcerer.

827
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:46,101
Very well.

828
00:44:47,068 --> 00:44:50,038
Just need you to do
something for her.

829
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:56,611
[soft music]

830
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:02,417
[Map] To reach
the desert castle,

831
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,620
you have to pass through
the Goby desert caves.

832
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:07,088
But rumor has it

833
00:45:08,256 --> 00:45:11,460
that those caves are
filled with untold dangers,

834
00:45:12,328 --> 00:45:13,396
monsters even.

835
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:16,165
You must be very careful.

836
00:45:16,198 --> 00:45:19,568
What kind of
dangerous monsters?

837
00:45:19,602 --> 00:45:23,005
[Manny] I could take on anything
as long as it isn't cats.

838
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:30,346
[growling]

839
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,548
[yelling]

840
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:42,291
Oh man, I wish I
had feet so much.

841
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:44,493
[yelling]

842
00:45:54,738 --> 00:45:55,571
Hey.

843
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,911
Excuse me, Mr. Bear.

844
00:45:59,943 --> 00:46:01,478
We didn't mean to disturb you.

845
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:04,614
We're trying to
save a dear friend.

846
00:46:05,649 --> 00:46:08,318
Please let us pass.

847
00:46:09,286 --> 00:46:11,021
You're trying to
rescue a friend?

848
00:46:11,054 --> 00:46:13,256
You better not be lying to me.

849
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:14,991
No, no, no.

850
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,626
We'd never lie to you.

851
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,265
In that case, you can go.

852
00:46:25,135 --> 00:46:27,437
But first you must
help me with something.

853
00:46:28,906 --> 00:46:30,173
What is it?

854
00:46:34,644 --> 00:46:36,914
Some time ago, a while back,

855
00:46:36,948 --> 00:46:39,516
I got into a fight
with my brother.

856
00:46:41,017 --> 00:46:43,186
Eventually he sent me a letter,

857
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,558
but I'm too old and I can't
see clearly enough to read it.

858
00:46:48,626 --> 00:46:53,297
If you can help me read
the letter, you can leave.

859
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,468
I'll help you.

860
00:46:57,502 --> 00:47:00,071
[gentle music]

861
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,174
Dear brother.

862
00:47:04,108 --> 00:47:06,712
How have you been
these past few years?

863
00:47:07,913 --> 00:47:10,248
I don't know if you're
still upset with me.

864
00:47:11,249 --> 00:47:13,651
Ever since I stormed
out after our fight,

865
00:47:13,684 --> 00:47:17,121
not a day has gone by that I
don't regret what happened.

866
00:47:17,956 --> 00:47:20,391
Now that I've become a father,

867
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:22,660
every time I see my boy playing

868
00:47:22,694 --> 00:47:24,362
and arguing with his buddies,

869
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:28,599
I would remember how we
used to play and fight.

870
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:33,038
I shouldn't have said such
hurtful things to you in anger.

871
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:37,476
And I really wanna
say that I'm sorry.

872
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:42,514
If you can find it in
your heart to forgive me,

873
00:47:42,548 --> 00:47:45,417
[hopeful music]

874
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:48,788
then I would like to
invite you to visit us

875
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:50,556
in the Northern forest.

876
00:47:52,124 --> 00:47:56,763
You will always be welcome
in my home, dear brother.

877
00:47:56,796 --> 00:47:59,665
[hopeful music]

878
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:05,203
Hard to believe
he's already a father.

879
00:48:06,471 --> 00:48:10,576
All these years in regret, it's.

880
00:48:13,913 --> 00:48:16,816
You know, I'm gonna
go pack my bags.

881
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:18,785
I need to see my brother.

882
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:23,691
[gentle music]

883
00:48:24,925 --> 00:48:29,295
Only those who you care most
about can hurt you so deep.

884
00:48:30,363 --> 00:48:32,733
- Huh?
- Ella, what is it?

885
00:48:34,735 --> 00:48:36,269
I'm thinking of Crystal.

886
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:39,238
Me too.

887
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:43,443
Friends, were going
back to find her.

888
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:56,556
[gentle music]

889
00:48:56,589 --> 00:48:58,759
[Manny] How are we
supposed to find Crystal

890
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:00,861
searching aimlessly like this?

891
00:49:03,697 --> 00:49:06,633
What's Crystal gonna
do without any food?

892
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:10,604
Crystal is all by herself.

893
00:49:10,638 --> 00:49:13,908
How is she gonna pass the
night out there all on her own?

894
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:16,778
Hey Walter, look,

895
00:49:18,813 --> 00:49:20,414
it's the Lifestone.

896
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:22,616
Wait!

897
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,252
[gentle music]

898
00:49:27,688 --> 00:49:28,489
Manny.

899
00:49:28,522 --> 00:49:29,124
Are you hurt?

900
00:49:29,156 --> 00:49:30,058
What was that?

901
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:32,093
What happened to the stone?

902
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:34,029
I think it's a trap.

903
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:36,196
We need to get out of here now.

904
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,767
- Ah.
- Whoa.

905
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,338
Careful, everyone.

906
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:48,509
[laughs]

907
00:49:49,476 --> 00:49:53,414
Winning the battle without
firing a single shot.

908
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:54,849
Olaf!

909
00:49:54,883 --> 00:49:55,950
What are you up to?

910
00:49:57,153 --> 00:49:58,988
Calm down.

911
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:01,656
The real surprises yet to come.

912
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,031
Crystal.

913
00:50:09,065 --> 00:50:11,934
Olaf, you creep, let her go.

914
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,537
No, I'm working with him.

915
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,405
But, Crystal,

916
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:19,041
we're your friends.

917
00:50:19,075 --> 00:50:22,510
Friends don't turn their backs
on each other like you did.

918
00:50:22,544 --> 00:50:25,480
Crystal, you can't trust him.

919
00:50:25,513 --> 00:50:28,316
Are you really qualified
to speak about trust?

920
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:30,853
[tense music]

921
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:35,825
[laughs]

922
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:39,829
How does it feel to be
betrayed by your old friend?

923
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:42,564

You say that Crystal
was your friend

925
00:50:45,135 --> 00:50:47,771
and yet all you
really cared about

926
00:50:47,804 --> 00:50:49,505
was saving prince charming.

927
00:50:49,538 --> 00:50:52,675
Did you ever really
care about Crystal?

928
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:56,445
Hey, we love Crystal.

929
00:50:56,479 --> 00:50:57,313
It's not your place to...

930
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,447
And you two,

931
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,119
Crystal, please
help me with this.

932
00:51:02,152 --> 00:51:04,587
Help me with your magic.

933
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,790
Have you ever done
anything for Crystal

934
00:51:06,823 --> 00:51:08,859
besides bossing her around?

935
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:10,927
Have you?

936
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:17,968
Crystal, I'm sorry.

937
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:22,304
This entire time you're
always watching out for us,

938
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:23,774
protecting us,

939
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:26,943
yet I completely
ignored your feelings.

940
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:28,845
I was wrong.

941
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:31,547
No, you were right.

942
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,550
My abilities aren't enough.

943
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:36,120
I'm not good enough
to be your friend.

944
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:38,355
Crystal, that's not true.

945
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:41,658
We've all felt horrible
about this entire thing.

946
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,961
It's all my fault.

947
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:45,295
I didn't listen.

948
00:51:45,328 --> 00:51:47,430
Crystal, you were
absolutely right.

949
00:51:47,464 --> 00:51:50,634
And I've regretted not
listening to you ever since.

950
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:51,501
Don't lie.

951
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,939
You never cared about a
useless sorcerer like me.

952
00:51:56,073 --> 00:51:58,009
No, that's not true.

953
00:51:59,043 --> 00:52:00,644
I know everyone has talents

954
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:02,947
that should be recognized
and appreciated.

955
00:52:04,381 --> 00:52:05,750
As your friend,

956
00:52:05,783 --> 00:52:07,785
I should have been
more supportive.

957
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,353
But deep in my heart,

958
00:52:10,387 --> 00:52:14,058
you always been a
brilliant sorcerer.

959
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:14,926

is waiting for us.

Let's go.

We're not gonna rescue
Alex by just standing here.

00:52:31,143 --> 00:52:32,044
Crystal,

965
00:52:32,077 --> 00:52:33,779
what are you doing?

966
00:52:33,812 --> 00:52:36,882
Did you really think I
double cross my friends?

967
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:40,953
Wait, I don't get it.

968
00:52:40,986 --> 00:52:42,788
Crystal, I.

969
00:52:44,522 --> 00:52:45,891
So what do you think?

970
00:52:46,825 --> 00:52:49,393
This sorcerer useful
after all, huh?

971
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,264
Do you,

972
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,333
do you forgive me?

973
00:52:54,365 --> 00:52:55,633
I feel much better now

974
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:57,970
after giving you a
piece of my mind.

975
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:00,404
Way to go, Chrystal.

976
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:02,808
Oh, for a second there,

977
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:05,978
we really thought you
were working with Olaf.

You little double crosser.

979
00:53:08,982 --> 00:53:12,986
Didn't I tell you they'd
never turned their backs on me?

980
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:16,289
Looks like Crystal made a
fool of you all on our own

981

with no help from us.

982
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:22,095
Okay, let's head to the
Desert Queen's castle.

01:00:16,884 --> 01:00:18,919
Remember you told me I'd
be a great sorcerer one day.

1106
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:20,488
This is my chance.

1107
01:00:20,522 --> 01:00:21,356
You'll see.

1108
01:00:22,424 --> 01:00:23,258
Crystal,

1109
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:25,427
we're not leaving
you here alone.

1110
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,229
[gentle music]

1111
01:00:30,532 --> 01:00:31,366
Don't worry.

1112
01:00:32,634 --> 01:00:33,868
I'll be all right.

1113
01:00:36,638 --> 01:00:39,174
[sad music]

1114
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:47,750
I promise I'll stay.

1115
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:51,219
But first give us the Lifestone.

1116
01:00:51,252 --> 01:00:52,722
Very well.

1117
01:00:52,755 --> 01:00:55,390
[magical music]

1118
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:10,506
We're really getting
the stone, just like that?

1119
01:01:16,212 --> 01:01:17,046
Huh.

1120
01:01:17,947 --> 01:01:19,716
[tense music]

1121
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,017
What are you doing?

1122
01:01:22,051 --> 01:01:23,586
Treacherous Desert Queen.

1123
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:25,756
What did you give me?

1124
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:28,023
The real stone is right here.

1125
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:29,793
Crystal!.

1126
01:01:29,826 --> 01:01:31,627
Ella get outta the way.

1127
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,561
I,

1128
01:01:32,595 --> 01:01:34,663
I can't control myself.

1129
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:37,400
[tense music]

1130
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,245
You despicable queen!

1131
01:01:54,283 --> 01:01:55,852
No Ella, no!

1132
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:58,555
[sad music]

1133
01:01:58,588 --> 01:01:59,489
Ella!

1134
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:01,992
[sad music]

1135
01:02:08,198 --> 01:02:11,568
Now you can stay
with your mind at rest.

1136
01:02:13,805 --> 01:02:19,009
I won't.

1137
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,650
[birds calling]

1138
01:02:32,757 --> 01:02:34,191
- Ella.
- Ella.

1139
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:39,496
Crystal really hit
us with her magic.

1140
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:41,131
She's gone cuckoo-kaju.

1141
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:43,567
No.

1142
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,570
Crystal was being controlled.

1143
01:02:46,571 --> 01:02:47,638
We have to save her.

1144
01:02:47,672 --> 01:02:50,709
[somber music]

1145
01:02:50,742 --> 01:02:52,210
That's a really steep climb.

1146
01:02:52,243 --> 01:02:53,978
How are you gonna get up there?

1147
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,148
I promised Crystal

1148
01:02:57,181 --> 01:02:59,350
that I never abandon her again.

1149
01:03:08,794 --> 01:03:09,627
Ella.

1150
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:12,029
Let it go, Ella.

1151
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,266
I'm fine.

1152
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:17,903
You can't Ella, please.

1153
01:03:17,936 --> 01:03:19,136
You could get hurt.

1154
01:03:20,137 --> 01:03:21,472
Even if we could
make it up there,

1155
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,675
we'd never be able to
defeat the evil queen.

1156
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,511
I'm not gonna let Crystal

1157
01:03:26,544 --> 01:03:28,246
face this all by herself.

1158
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:30,515
Even Crystal was captured

1159
01:03:30,548 --> 01:03:31,985
and she's a sorcerer.

1160
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,586
How are you possibly
going to save her?

1161
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:36,890
I have to try

1162
01:03:36,923 --> 01:03:38,524
no matter what,

1163
01:03:38,557 --> 01:03:41,226
[hopeful music]

1164
01:03:43,095 --> 01:03:45,430
otherwise I regret it.

1165
01:03:45,464 --> 01:03:49,067
She is nuts and
not in a good way.

1166
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:51,503
What do we do now?

1167
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:52,671
What can we do?

1168
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:54,640
Just pray she won't fall.

1169
01:03:57,744 --> 01:03:58,778
Don't fall down,

1170
01:03:58,811 --> 01:04:00,045
don't fall down.

1171
01:04:01,113 --> 01:04:01,948
Stop that.

1172
01:04:01,981 --> 01:04:03,115
Come on, Walter.

1173
01:04:03,148 --> 01:04:04,116
Let's catch up.

1174
01:04:04,149 --> 01:04:06,819
[hopeful music]

1175
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,730
Ella, careful.

1176
01:04:22,435 --> 01:04:23,269
Got it.

1177
01:04:26,774 --> 01:04:28,107
I got it.

1178
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:29,442
Hang on Crystal.

1179
01:04:29,475 --> 01:04:30,176
We're coming.

1180
01:04:30,209 --> 01:04:33,079
[hopeful music]

1181
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:49,662
I just did half a year's
worth of work out in one day.

1182
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,733
How are we gonna
get over there?

1183
01:04:52,766 --> 01:04:55,401
[soft music]

1184
01:05:01,775 --> 01:05:03,844
You two climb on my shoulders.

1185
01:05:03,877 --> 01:05:04,712
Huh?

1186
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:10,184
Come on, let's all
go nuts together.

1187
01:05:11,753 --> 01:05:12,854
It's the only way.

1188
01:05:14,022 --> 01:05:17,191
No matter what,
we're with you.

1189
01:05:20,594 --> 01:05:22,764
[yelling]

1190
01:05:24,698 --> 01:05:27,368
[hopeful music]

1191
01:05:36,044 --> 01:05:37,177
We made it.

1192
01:05:41,649 --> 01:05:43,018
Okay guys,

1193
01:05:43,051 --> 01:05:44,786
when we get up there,

1194
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:46,420
I'm going to need your help.

1195
01:05:49,623 --> 01:05:51,826
[dark music]

1196
01:05:58,034 --> 01:06:00,402
My little magician,

1197
01:06:00,435 --> 01:06:02,772
have you thought it through yet?

1198
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:03,638
Let me go!

1199
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:09,879
I know you've always wanted
to become a real sorcerer.

1200
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:15,885
Join me and you will have the
chance to realize your dream.

1201
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:19,055
You're the one who
killed my friends.

1202
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:20,455
Don't forget.

1203
01:06:20,488 --> 01:06:24,160
You were the one who
threw them over the edge.

1204
01:06:24,192 --> 01:06:25,995
Why, that was you.

1205
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:29,165
I'd rather die I than help you.

1206
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:30,231
Huh?

1207
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,471
Ella.

1208
01:06:36,504 --> 01:06:37,740
Crystal.

1209
01:06:37,773 --> 01:06:39,075
Ella, get away from here.

1210
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:40,876
You're no match for her.

1211
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:43,578
[evil laughter]

1212
01:06:43,611 --> 01:06:46,817
You're just full of
surprises little girl.

1213
01:06:47,516 --> 01:06:50,187
Still alive after that fall?

1214
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:51,988
You're deceitful witch.

1215
01:06:52,022 --> 01:06:53,222
Let Crystal go.

1216
01:06:54,423 --> 01:06:57,660
You had a chance to
escape with your life,

1217
01:06:57,693 --> 01:07:01,497
but decided to come
meet your fate instead.

1218
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,332
I'm not gonna abandon Crystal.

1219
01:07:03,365 --> 01:07:06,803
And I would never back
down from the likes of you.

1220
01:07:06,837 --> 01:07:09,740
Such a touching friendship.

1221
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:12,641
I'm not gonna let
you hurt my friends.

1222
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:15,478
If you wanna fight
anyone, fight me.

1223
01:07:16,612 --> 01:07:18,280
[Desert Queen] Crystal,
there's no reason

1224
01:07:18,314 --> 01:07:21,417
to waste talent like yours
on the likes of them.

1225
01:07:25,956 --> 01:07:26,790
Hey, hey.

1226
01:07:31,796 --> 01:07:33,697
Oh.

1227
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:34,564
Uh.

1228
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:37,634
- Huh?
- Hey.

1229
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,668
Witch.

1230
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:40,337
What are you planning
to do with Crystal?

1231
01:07:41,271 --> 01:07:44,474
My purpose, very well.

1232
01:07:44,508 --> 01:07:46,276
Since you're going to die,

1233
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:47,812
I might as well tell you

1234
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:51,648
she can help me
expand the desert.

1235
01:07:51,681 --> 01:07:54,051
Why would you want
to expand the desert?

1236
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:56,087
The bigger the desert grows,

1237
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,455
the greater my power will be.

1238
01:08:03,928 --> 01:08:05,462
And in time,

1239
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:09,867
I shall become the most
powerful sorcerer on earth.

1240
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:13,703
[evil laughter]

1241
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:16,240
So you wanna use my magic

1242
01:08:16,274 --> 01:08:19,509
and the Lifestone's powers
to desiccate the forest

1243
01:08:19,543 --> 01:08:20,946
and destroy the world.

1244
01:08:23,982 --> 01:08:25,516
Exactly.

1245
01:08:26,617 --> 01:08:31,089
Crystal, I see great promise
in your magical potential.

1246
01:08:31,123 --> 01:08:36,494
I sincerely hope you could
succeed in my place one day.

1247
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:37,361
Mm.

1248
01:08:38,563 --> 01:08:41,365
Well what gives you the
right to set Crystal's future?

1249
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:42,801
Because I will allow her

1250
01:08:42,835 --> 01:08:46,839
to become the most powerful
sorcerer apart for myself.

1251
01:08:49,842 --> 01:08:53,045
I've learned magic so
I can protect my friends.

1252
01:08:53,078 --> 01:08:57,548
I want nothing to do with power
gained by sacrificing that.

1253
01:08:57,582 --> 01:08:59,785
Crystal, you are still young.

1254
01:08:59,818 --> 01:09:03,055
You have no idea what you
should be focusing on in life.

1255
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:04,790
You honestly believe Crystal

1256
01:09:04,823 --> 01:09:07,659
should listen to a
common thief like you.

1257
01:09:08,828 --> 01:09:12,698
Keep blathering your slander
and I won't be merciful.

1258
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:16,936
Heh, what's the matter
did I touch a nerve?

1259
01:09:17,837 --> 01:09:18,938
Enough.

1260
01:09:18,972 --> 01:09:21,975
If that's how you want to
play, don't blame me for.

1261
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:24,576
Huh?

1262
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:25,510
Hey.

1263
01:09:25,544 --> 01:09:27,981
You sneaking little mouse.

1264
01:09:29,414 --> 01:09:31,217
[Manny] Whoa.

1265
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,886
Get back here with my stone.

1266
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,621
[tense music]

1267
01:09:36,356 --> 01:09:38,624
Don't even dream escaping.

1268
01:09:40,026 --> 01:09:41,493
[Crystal] Get outta here now.

1269
01:09:41,526 --> 01:09:43,796
Not one of you are
getting away today.

1270
01:09:48,902 --> 01:09:50,770
Dare to get my way!

1271
01:09:51,436 --> 01:09:52,939
Where's the stone?

1272
01:09:55,474 --> 01:09:58,444
The stone is no
longer your concern.

1273
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,383
If you refuse to follow me,

1274
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:04,718
you will suffer my wrath.

1275
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:20,134
Crystal.

1276
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:21,001
No.

1277
01:10:23,003 --> 01:10:27,007
Hand over the Lifestone
or you'll be next.

1278
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:29,243
[somber music]

1279
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:30,510
You evil witch.

1280
01:10:30,543 --> 01:10:32,112
I'm gonna make you pay!

1281
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:36,984
[dark music]

1282
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:45,994
Ella, bring back the stone.

1283
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:47,062
As long as it's with us,

1284
01:10:47,095 --> 01:10:48,830
she won't be able to defeat me.

1285
01:10:49,563 --> 01:10:52,033
[tense music]

1286
01:10:57,604 --> 01:10:58,773
[Desert Queen] Out of my way.

1287
01:10:58,807 --> 01:11:00,641
Don't even think about it.

1288
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:04,980
You think that stone will
make you a match for me?

1289
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,286
If you're so great,
then why steal the stone?

1290
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:14,055
[dramatic music]

1291
01:11:19,626 --> 01:11:23,064
The stone is wasted
in your weak hands.

1292
01:11:24,498 --> 01:11:27,002
Your corruption is not
fit to possess the stone.

1293
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:32,141
Walter, hurry up.

1294
01:11:33,142 --> 01:11:34,110
Manny,

1295
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,111
wait for me.

1296
01:11:35,144 --> 01:11:36,711
Hurry, Alex is waiting for us.

1297
01:11:36,746 --> 01:11:37,980
Ah.

1298
01:11:38,014 --> 01:11:39,048
Ah.

1299
01:11:39,081 --> 01:11:39,915
Oh.

1300
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:44,253
You are not so hard
to find after all.

1301
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:45,121
Olaf.

1302
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:48,057
[Olaf] Give me the stone.

1303
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,993
[exciting music]

1304
01:11:52,294 --> 01:11:54,296
Manny, get the stone.

1305
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:55,831
Got it.

1306
01:11:55,865 --> 01:11:58,267
But we gotta take care of
this annoying guy first.

1307
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,567
Stop where you are.

1308
01:12:00,803 --> 01:12:01,603
Ah.

1309
01:12:05,775 --> 01:12:06,842
No.

1310
01:12:06,876 --> 01:12:08,010
Manny!

1311
01:12:08,044 --> 01:12:09,111
Over here.

1312
01:12:09,145 --> 01:12:10,179
Ah.

1313
01:12:12,048 --> 01:12:13,149
Watch me.

1314
01:12:19,055 --> 01:12:20,057
Walter, quick!

1315
01:12:23,493 --> 01:12:25,295
Manny, catch.

1316
01:12:25,328 --> 01:12:28,031
[tense music]

1317
01:12:40,143 --> 01:12:41,278
[Olaf] Give me the stone.

1318
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:42,645
[Ella] Keep dreaming.

1319
01:12:46,715 --> 01:12:48,251
Hand it over.

1320
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:49,352
Olaf!

1321
01:12:49,386 --> 01:12:50,387
Let her go!

1322
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,688
[laughs]

1323
01:12:52,722 --> 01:12:55,459
Finally got ya.

1324
01:12:55,492 --> 01:12:57,761
[laughs]

1325
01:12:58,495 --> 01:13:00,230
Get out of here.

1326
01:13:00,263 --> 01:13:01,064
No.

1327
01:13:01,098 --> 01:13:01,898
No.

1328
01:13:01,932 --> 01:13:03,033
No!

1329
01:13:03,066 --> 01:13:05,235
[yelling]

1330
01:13:17,482 --> 01:13:18,916
Oh, Snowball.

1331
01:13:20,051 --> 01:13:21,786
Just in time.

1332
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:24,922
It must be Dr. Know-It-All
who told you to come save us.

1333
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,125
The Lifestone.

1334
01:13:27,892 --> 01:13:29,393
Guys, look at this.

1335
01:13:32,563 --> 01:13:34,398
Don't leave me.

1336
01:13:34,432 --> 01:13:36,234
You can't this to me again.

1337
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:42,974
[tense music]

1338
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:05,330
Is that all you've got?

1339
01:14:06,298 --> 01:14:07,799
I overestimated you.

1340
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,935
The Lifestone would
never accept the touch

1341
01:14:09,968 --> 01:14:12,004
of an evil witch like you.

1342
01:14:13,005 --> 01:14:16,475
Heh, the Lifestone belongs
with the most powerful sorcerer

1343
01:14:16,508 --> 01:14:17,708
in the land.

1344
01:14:21,113 --> 01:14:22,181
You again.

1345
01:14:22,214 --> 01:14:23,482
Silly little wench.

1346
01:14:23,515 --> 01:14:26,618
[tense music]

1347
01:14:26,652 --> 01:14:27,819
Snowball, let's go.

1348
01:14:27,853 --> 01:14:29,720
Get the stone to
the Forest Guardian.

1349
01:14:29,755 --> 01:14:32,257
[tense music]

1350
01:14:34,126 --> 01:14:35,194
Just in time.

1351
01:14:35,227 --> 01:14:37,930
[tense music]

1352
01:14:41,733 --> 01:14:42,534
[Ella] Catch the stone.

1353
01:14:42,568 --> 01:14:43,570
Come.

1354
01:14:43,603 --> 01:14:45,038
No you don't.

1355
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:47,373
[tense music]

1356
01:14:58,351 --> 01:14:59,385
Flash your light.

1357
01:15:07,327 --> 01:15:09,796
Finally, I come in handy.

1358
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:12,765
[exciting music]

1359
01:15:19,839 --> 01:15:21,774
You're gonna pay for that.

1360
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:24,744
[dramatic music]

1361
01:15:50,404 --> 01:15:51,238
You!

1362
01:15:54,241 --> 01:15:55,242
Wait.

1363
01:15:55,276 --> 01:15:57,811
What else do you have
to say for yourself?

1364
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,280
The stone is yours.

1365
01:15:59,313 --> 01:16:00,414
I won't fight you.

1366
01:16:00,447 --> 01:16:01,649
Don't believe her.

1367
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,317
She's a liar and a cheat.

1368
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,686
She has deceived us before.

1369
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:07,821
I never meant to harm anyone.

1370
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,857
I did it all for
these barren lands.

1371
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:13,193
Did you forget when
you did your Crystal?

1372
01:16:14,295 --> 01:16:17,331
I was just going to
take you to see her.

1373
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,367
[dramatic music]

1374
01:16:19,401 --> 01:16:21,936
[screaming]

1375
01:16:26,608 --> 01:16:29,377
[gentle music]

1376
01:16:31,413 --> 01:16:33,014
Did we win?

1377
01:16:33,048 --> 01:16:36,752
We defeated the
Queen of the Desert.

1378
01:16:36,786 --> 01:16:39,354
Before, I never
would've believed in you,

1379
01:16:40,355 --> 01:16:43,425
but now you're all
truly impressive.

1380
01:16:46,661 --> 01:16:49,030
[sobbing]

1381
01:16:49,831 --> 01:16:52,534
[Ella] But we lost Crystal.

1382
01:16:53,702 --> 01:16:56,471
[somber music]

1383
01:17:00,776 --> 01:17:01,910
Crystal.

1384
01:17:03,211 --> 01:17:06,648
[Walter] I can't
believe she's gone.

1385
01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:09,018
She gave her life for us.

1386
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,556
Please, you have to save her.

1387
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:16,359
I'll do whatever you want.

1388
01:17:16,392 --> 01:17:18,094
Please save her.

1389
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:21,097
I'm afraid I can't help you.

1390
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:24,133
However, the stone only
has enough remaining power

1391
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:26,402
to save one of your friends.

1392
01:17:27,403 --> 01:17:28,604
You must choose.

1393
01:17:30,506 --> 01:17:31,307
Oh no.

1394
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,475
How can we choose?

1395
01:17:32,508 --> 01:17:33,576
This is bad.

1396
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:36,979
But our entire journey has
been to bring back Alex.

1397
01:17:37,012 --> 01:17:41,484
Well, the only reason
Crystal ended up this way

1398
01:17:41,517 --> 01:17:43,352
is because she helped save us.

1399
01:17:45,354 --> 01:17:46,188
No, no.

1400
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:49,425
There's gotta be another way.

1401
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:50,426
I'm very sorry.

1402
01:17:50,459 --> 01:17:51,994
This is beyond my powers.

1403
01:17:52,027 --> 01:17:54,430
We have to save them both.

1404
01:17:54,463 --> 01:17:55,432
We have to.

1405
01:17:56,533 --> 01:17:57,601
That's not possible.

1406
01:17:57,634 --> 01:17:59,436
You must make a choice.

1407
01:18:00,537 --> 01:18:01,938
What, now?

1408
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:03,006
[coughing]

1409
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:05,709
Your Highness, if I may,

1410
01:18:05,743 --> 01:18:07,845
save Crystal instead of me,

1411
01:18:07,879 --> 01:18:09,513
please, I insist.

1412
01:18:11,314 --> 01:18:12,149
Alex.

1413
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,718
Why did you say that?

1414
01:18:14,752 --> 01:18:17,521
[gentle music]

1415
01:18:19,089 --> 01:18:22,459
Crystal sacrificed herself
in order to save my life.

1416
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,996
It is my honor to
return the favor.

1417
01:18:26,898 --> 01:18:28,999
If you don't bring her back,

1418
01:18:29,032 --> 01:18:30,802
I'll never be able
to forgive myself

1419
01:18:30,835 --> 01:18:32,636
for the rest of my days.

1420
01:18:32,669 --> 01:18:34,772
[coughing]

1421
01:18:34,806 --> 01:18:37,474
But you need
the stone's power.

1422
01:18:37,507 --> 01:18:38,575
Oh Alex,

1423
01:18:38,608 --> 01:18:41,645
now you'll never be able
to live as a prince again.

1424
01:18:46,617 --> 01:18:47,585
It's okay.

1425
01:18:47,618 --> 01:18:49,220
As long as we're together,

1426
01:18:51,456 --> 01:18:53,024
that's all that matters.

1427
01:18:54,459 --> 01:18:55,493
Please, your Highness.

1428
01:18:56,727 --> 01:18:58,029
I've made my decision.

1429
01:18:58,696 --> 01:18:59,630
Very well.

1430
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,268
[twinkling]

1431
01:19:13,912 --> 01:19:16,481
[gentle music]

1432
01:20:03,128 --> 01:20:04,663
What happened?

1433
01:20:04,696 --> 01:20:05,631
Crystal!

1434
01:20:05,664 --> 01:20:07,299
We're so glad to have you back.

1435
01:20:07,332 --> 01:20:09,701
We were afraid we lost you.

1436
01:20:09,736 --> 01:20:11,971
I missed you too, Ella.

1437
01:20:12,005 --> 01:20:13,572
- Crystal!
- Crystal!

1438
01:20:14,841 --> 01:20:17,376
Manny, Walter,
you guys are okay.

1439
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:19,345
[Alex] Welcome back, Crystal.

1440
01:20:25,718 --> 01:20:26,553
Alex,

1441
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:28,521
what happened?

1442
01:20:28,555 --> 01:20:29,990
Did we fail?

1443
01:20:30,024 --> 01:20:32,091
What about the Lifestone?

1444
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,093
We defeated the Desert Queen.

1445
01:20:34,127 --> 01:20:35,796
And got back the Lifestone.

1446
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:39,265
Then let's use the
stone to save Alex.

1447
01:20:39,299 --> 01:20:41,467
What are we waiting for?

1448
01:20:41,501 --> 01:20:43,837
[somber music]

1449
01:20:48,274 --> 01:20:50,677
Guys, say something.

1450
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,512
In order to save you,

1451
01:20:52,545 --> 01:20:54,782
Alex sacrificed the
chance to become human.

1452
01:20:56,182 --> 01:20:57,450
Wait, what?

1453
01:20:59,753 --> 01:21:01,588
No.

1454
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:02,890
It's all my fault.

1455
01:21:02,923 --> 01:21:04,457
I'm the one who.

1456
01:21:05,558 --> 01:21:07,762
You've done more
than enough, Crystal.

1457
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,464
But Alex, I don't.

1458
01:21:14,435 --> 01:21:16,704
As long as we're together,

1459
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:18,339
I know we'll figure it out.

1460
01:21:19,607 --> 01:21:22,276
[hopeful music]

1461
01:21:24,311 --> 01:21:26,380
There's a book for sorcerers

1462
01:21:26,413 --> 01:21:28,616
that describes an ancient spell.

1463
01:21:30,651 --> 01:21:32,252
I mean I've heard of it,

1464
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:35,289
but I'm only an
apprentice sorcerer.

1465
01:21:35,322 --> 01:21:36,825
Take a look at yourself.

1466
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:39,660
What happened?

1467
01:21:40,628 --> 01:21:41,662
In being healed,

1468
01:21:41,695 --> 01:21:45,265
you have absorbed all of
the Lifestone's power.

1469
01:21:45,299 --> 01:21:46,667
Through the journey
