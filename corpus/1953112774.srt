1
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,760
I was born in a year when many
 horses were sent to Africa...

2
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,359
... to work in the copper mines.

3
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,360
 Africa was far away and
the journey was very long.

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,520
My mother was pregnant when
she was taken from her home.

5
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,720
She gave birth to me in the middle
 of the Atlantic Ocean.

6
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
We didn't know where we were
 being taken, or why.

7
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,480
The ship's rising and falling made
 my world even more unstable.

8
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,760
On this strange and unsteady place,
 I taught myself to stand.

9
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,040
That is how I started my life.

10
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,160
I had never seen the land
 or the light of day.

11
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,880
I wondered what we were doing here.

12
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,279
The cold saltwater was a shock.

13
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,079
I hadjust learned to walk...

14
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,080
...and now I had to teach
 myself to swim.

15
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,279
I fought to keep my head
 above the waves...

16
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,280
...but soon I fell behind.

17
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,119
I heard my mother calling me.

18
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,120
 But try as I might,
I couldn't swim any faster.

19
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
 I couldn't answer my mother.
My throat was full of salty water.

20
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I had to find my mother.

21
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I had to find her.

22
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,840
What's that colt doing down there?
 Take him on the train.

23
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Why didn't they understand that
I needed to be with my mother?

24
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,759
I was hungry and thirsty.

25
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,760
This world made no sense.

26
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
 We were packed together in
the boxcars in the desert heat.

27
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,720
I didn't see anything green
 in this harsh land.

28
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Why would they bring us
 to such a place?

29
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,240
How would we live?

30
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,120
I became too weak to stand.

31
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
I found myself moving in
 and out of dreams.

32
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,640
Sometimes I thought I was
 still on the ship.

33
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I felt that I couldn't hold
 on much longer.

34
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,960
I was too sick to cry out.

35
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,079
My mother was going away.

36
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,080
That's when I lost all hope.

37
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Poor boy. What happened to you?

38
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,559
Drink.

39
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,559
lt'll help.

40
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
This boy had a gentle touch.

41
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,480
I felt I could trust him.

42
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,160
Easy, boy. Come on.

43
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,679
Daisy! Bring me some water.

44
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,559
All right. lt's coming.

45
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,919
l'll take care of you.

46
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,920
-Have you seen the white horse?
 -No, l haven't.

47
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Good boy.

48
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
That's enough for now.

49
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,120
We need to go.

50
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
You feel better?

51
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,080
I saw horses working everywhere
 in this town.

52
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
I wondered what would happen to me.

53
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,960
The boy told me that he was taking me
 to the mine boss' stable...

54
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
... where all the pedigreed
 horses lived.

55
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,440
He could see that I was no prince,
 but he took me there anyway.

56
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Stay here, okay?

57
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,959
 -Watch him for me.
-You're making yourself trouble.

58
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,960
 No, it's all right.
l have to do something.

59
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,239
The stallion looked huge to me.

60
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,759
He made it clear that
 he ruled the place.

61
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,119
''This stable is for thoroughbreds. ''

62
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,959
''You're not welcome here,
 you little runt. ''

63
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
But I had nowhere else to go.

64
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,559
What are you doing there?

65
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,319
You've already been working here
 for three weeks for me, man.

66
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,320
What's that? Watch your tongue!

67
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Did you see a nursing mare?
 Found her baby.

68
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,639
 Kid, do l look like
l have time for babies?

69
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,559
 She probably died on the ship.
Bad luck for your colt, Richard.

70
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,560
 -Bring it over!
-Get a move on!

71
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,239
Get ahold of her.

72
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Get after her! Get on! Go on!

73
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Come on. Don't be so choosy.

74
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Try and drink some.

75
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,160
 l couldn't find your mom.
But l'll stay with you. l promise.

76
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,280
I missed my mother.

77
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I would never stop looking for her.

78
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Good morning, Caesar.
 How are you, boy?

79
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Wrap his legs and give him a rubdown.

80
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
What?

81
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,999
What's this?

82
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
l found him in a boxcar.

83
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,599
What's your job, boy?

84
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Wasting time or taking care
 of my horses?

85
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,599
l felt sorry for him.

86
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,839
l think his mom is dead.

87
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Let me keep him. Just for a while.

88
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,640
All right, handsome.

89
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,079
All right.

90
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,080
Thank you.

91
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,840
He's in a good mood today.

92
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Why did you do that, Dad?
lt's better if you'd said no.

93
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,960
The boy's got nothing.
 He's an orphan.

94
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,160
A little friend can't hurt.

95
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,839
The boss lives there.

96
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,519
He's got his own private well
 with nice clean water.

97
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Not like the dirty junk at the town.

98
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,519
Stay away from Caesar.

99
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,959
He's handsome...

100
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,960
...but mean.

101
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,719
That's our Beauty.

102
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,720
She loves to play.

103
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,799
She's much nicer than her father.

104
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Beauty! Come here!

105
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,480
I hadn't even paid any attention
 to Beauty before...

106
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,920
...but out here Beauty was
 funny and full of life.

107
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,560
I couldn't take my eyes off of her.

108
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Her father, Caesar, was angry
 to see us together.

109
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,079
Beauty...

110
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,119
...this is my boy...

111
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,159
...Lucky.

112
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,159
I was only the stableboy's horse.

113
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,039
I wasn't good enough to play
 with his daughter.

114
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Do you like him?

115
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,760
 She likes you, Lucky.
Do you want to play together?

116
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,680
I hoped that Caesar would begin
 to like me once he knew me.

117
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,679
But I was wrong.

118
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,639
''You useless little runt. ''

119
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,640
''If you come near my daughter,
 I'll kick your teeth in. ''

120
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Poor Beauty, having him for a father.

121
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,360
I thought someone should
 challenge him.

122
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,920
l have bad news, Herr manager.

123
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Hardly a surprise. We all knew
 war in Europe was expected.

124
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,280
 l must say, interesting,
the improvements you've made here.

125
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,960
lt's finally a town.

126
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,639
l have plans for this place.

127
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
You may need to change your plans.

128
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,159
This war is spreading to Africa.

129
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
We expect the enemy
 to attack the town.

130
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,240
lf they bomb the tracks,
you'll be stranded here.

131
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,919
We can't defend your town.

132
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
We still think you have a few weeks.

133
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,119
ln the event of an attack...

134
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,120
...you must be ready to evacuate.

135
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,360
This is an order.

136
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Prost.

137
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Don't give me any trouble, Caesar.

138
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Easy, boy, easy. Easy.

139
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Where's his brush?

140
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Do it again.

141
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
Keep that runt out of here,
 away from him.

142
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Yes, sir.

143
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,199
Go to Hans.

144
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,200
-Get some more.
-On my way, sir.

145
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Today, his mood's pretty bad.

146
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,160
It wasn't only in the stable
 that the world was unfair.

147
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,319
 In town, as people
prepared for war...

148
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,799
...I saw something else.

149
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Horses were forced to walk in circles
 to draw water from the town well.

150
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,960
 Now you know why
they brought you here.

151
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,880
I decided on one thing that day:

152
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,120
I would never be chained to a wheel.

153
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,480
I was born to run free and wild.

154
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,599
No one taught me this.

155
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,600
It was something I knew in my blood.

156
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Lucky.

157
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Good boy.

158
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Good boy.

159
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Do you miss your own mom?

160
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I heard a familiar voice.

161
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,680
My mother was calling from far away.

162
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Steady, horse. There we go.

163
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,240
 -Easy.
-Steady, steady.

164
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I had dreamed of this moment
 over and over.

165
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,280
But Caesar didn't give us much time.

166
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Caesar was furious a lowly workhorse
 had dared to enter his domain.

167
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,640
I was so sad. I wasn't strong enough
 to protect my mother.

168
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Easy, boy, easy.

169
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,039
Lucky. Easy.

170
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,040
 I'll never forget the sight
of my mother being led away.

171
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,560
 She tried to hide it from me, but
I could tell that she was badly hurt.

172
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Easy.

173
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,239
-What's wrong with her?
 -She's hurt.

174
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,240
 -Can she work?
-No, she's finished.

175
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,240
l think she's going to be okay.

176
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,080
Let's hope.

177
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,120
l know how you feel.

178
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,240
My mother needed me.

179
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,360
I had to find her.

180
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,160
I thought I heard a horse
 in the distance.

181
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,280
It was my mother.

182
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,560
She was very weak.

183
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,840
No one came to help.

184
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,920
 I stood by her all night,
praying that she would survive.

185
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,480
I would take her far away from here.

186
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,040
My mother didn't make it.

187
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,480
I knew I couldn't stay in this place.

188
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,320
But l've looked everywhere for him.

189
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,839
He says Lucky doesn't have a chance.

190
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,840
l've heard stories about a hidden lake
 somewhere in the mountains.

191
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Perhaps the old horse found it, huh?

192
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,560
l don't believe in fairy tales.

193
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Where were you? l was so worried.

194
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,359
Are you okay?

195
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,360
I had no other home except my boy.

196
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,400
I knew he would never turn me away.

197
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Looks like a snakebite.

198
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,760
 We've got to fix this, fast.
l'll take Caesar's medicine.

199
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,879
Look, Dad.

200
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,880
l told you.

201
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,320
You steal from my horse,
 you steal from me.

202
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,760
l had to. l'm sorry.

203
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Come here.

204
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,400
He really deserved it.

205
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,639
What sort of a place was this...

206
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,640
... where a boy could be beaten
 for helping his friend?

207
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Even the desert, with all its dangers,
 was better than this.

208
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,039
Let's just go.

209
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Nobody would miss us.

210
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,240
My boy told me about a magical lake
 high in the mountains.

211
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,640
He told me we would go there
 and live in paradise.

212
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,560
But I was smart enough to know we'd
 have a hard time finding any lake.

213
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
In fact, all we discovered was
 a lot of rocks and sand.

214
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Did you hear that?

215
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,040
Hope it wasn't a leopard.

216
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Here, Lucky.

217
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
The Bushman girl was amazing.

218
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,840
 She could dig under the sand and
find ostrich eggs filled with water.

219
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,360
I waited to see what other things
 she could do.

220
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,159
He hurt his leg.

221
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,160
He doesn't feel well.

222
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,160
What are you doing?

223
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
What must l do with this?

224
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,120
My boy didn't understand
 this medicine.

225
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,639
The girl seemed to know
 what I needed.

226
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,640
I hoped she would stay with us
 for a while.

227
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,200
l'm Richard.

228
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,360
-Excuse me?
 -Nyka.

229
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,440
That's Lucky.

230
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,719
Thank you.

231
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,720
He looks much better now.

232
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Save some for me.

233
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,359
In the warmth of the fire...

234
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,919
... with the girl and
the boy close by...

235
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,920
...I thought that we had finally
 left all danger behind.

236
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,320
In the morning, everything changed.

237
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,760
l don't know.

238
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,400
 The stables!
l've got to get the horses.

239
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,959
Richard!

240
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,960
Stay away from here.

241
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,879
How long?

242
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,839
 lf he bombs the tracks,
we're stranded. We have to evacuate!

243
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,840
-Everyone to the train!
 -Hold it!

244
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,400
Stay, stay.

245
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,040
Caesar, come here.

246
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,119
Are you all right?

247
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,120
Let's go, Lucky.

248
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,520
Has he been injured?

249
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,559
l've got your horse, boss!

250
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,560
We have no place for a horse,
 you fool!

251
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,760
Let him go!

252
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,999
Richard! Come on!

253
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,959
No! l can't leave him!

254
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,639
-Leave the horse!
 -No!

255
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,079
Get on the train now!

256
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,080
No! Let me go! l can't leave him!

257
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,679
Lucky!

258
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,680
 I was confused.
Where should I run?

259
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,760
The people had gone crazy.

260
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Lucky!

261
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,480
I suddenly realized they were
taking my boy away from me.

262
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Now I was really alone.

263
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,840
I would never see my friend again.

264
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,359
The horses didn't know what to do.

265
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,360
They had been abandoned, and they
 had forgotten how to be wild.

266
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,280
Without my boy, I had to learn
 how to survive on my own.

267
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,240
These horses pushed me away...

268
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,440
 ...as if to keep me from drinking
water that we couldn't reach anyway.

269
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Suddenly, I remembered where
 I could find water.

270
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,560
Beauty was happy to see me.

271
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,959
Why did Caesar hate me so much?

272
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,960
 I was just a young colt.
All I wanted was a little water.

273
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,040
I would rather die than
 bow to Caesar.

274
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,160
I thought of my boy.

275
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,320
I wished that I could see him again.

276
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,879
Lucky.

277
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,880
 When the girl appeared,
I thought I was dreaming.

278
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Once again, she knew what I needed.

279
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,160
 I stayed with the girl because I
wanted to learn to live in the wild.

280
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,080
I knew that she would teach me
 the ways of the desert.

281
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,400
I smelled the blood of
 the hunters' kill.

282
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,880
I realized I did not belong here.

283
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,560
It was time for me to set out
 into an unknown world...

284
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,880
... where I might be as wild
 and free as my dreams.

285
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,759
I would miss the girl.

286
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,760
But I knew she would understand.

287
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,680
Alone in the desert, I grew strong.

288
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,880
But I started to feel lonely.

289
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,200
I wandered from one place to another.

290
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,400
 These little cubs were hardly
the company I was looking for.

291
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,240
 The shade was cool,
and so we rested a while.

292
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,080
At least I wasn't alone.

293
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,480
It never occurred to me to wonder why
two cubs would be alone in the desert.

294
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,800
Big mistake.

295
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,800
 Help can come from
the most unlikely places.

296
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,680
Of course, it's wise to make friends
 with someone who has horns.

297
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,240
The oryx and I accepted
 each other's company.

298
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,080
And at first we travelled
 well together.

299
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,840
What did I do wrong?

300
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,400
The oryx had found a girlfriend.

301
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,160
I understood.

302
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,640
It was not easy to live
 a solitary life.

303
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,879
Each day surviving...

304
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,880
... each day alone.

305
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,440
 It was unlikely that I would find
any other horses roaming the desert.

306
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,479
But I pushed onward...

307
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,480
... driven by my instincts.

308
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,760
I had to find my place in the world.

309
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,840
I had found what could not be found.

310
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,240
The lake in the mountains was real.

311
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,080
I wanted to share this place.

312
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,040
I thought of Beauty...

313
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,560
...and the other horses too.

314
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,800
I wished I could have brought
 my mother to this place.

315
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,279
I thought of Caesar.

316
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,280
Why should the other horses
 have to live in fear of him?

317
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And why should I have to
 live without Beauty?

318
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,440
I decided that one day,
when I was a stallion...

319
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,280
...I would go back.

320
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,840
I saw no signs of anyone in the town.

321
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,160
Had I come all this way only
to find that I was still alone?

322
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,199
And then I saw Beauty.

323
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,759
We had both changed...

324
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,639
...but I knew her at once.

325
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,640
 I was thrilled that
she remembered me too.

326
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,719
Why wouldn't the other horses
 follow us?

327
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,720
What did they have to fear?

328
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,759
Caesar would never allow
 Beauty to leave.

329
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,760
But I was finally ready
 to take him on.

330
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,399
 I didn't know if I was
strong enough to win...

331
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,400
...but I was strong enough to try.

332
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,880
I could have hurt Caesar.

333
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,680
Some part of me wanted to kill him.

334
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,840
 But he was old,
and I was the strong one now.

335
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,120
 So I drove him away, where
he could never hurt another horse.

336
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Now the horses followed us.

337
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,559
We had lived in the mountains
 for years...

338
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,560
 ... without hearing the sound
of a machine or a human voice.

339
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,800
 The horses who could
remember were afraid.

340
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,279
I promised them...

341
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,280
...I would defend my herd.

342
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,880
The stranger tracked my foal until
 he found the rest of the herd.

343
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,559
I didn't recognize him.

344
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,560
Who was this intruder?

345
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,559
Easy, boy.

346
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,560
Easy.

347
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,040
I knew that whistle at once.

348
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,039
I looked for the boy...

349
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,040
...but I saw a man.

350
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,079
It was my boy.

351
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,080
His touch was the same.

352
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,080
Lucky.

353
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,239
You remember me.

354
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,279
l missed you.

355
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,199
l had to find you.

356
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,200
l had to know you were all right.

357
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,280
All these years l thought about you.

358
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,800
l'm sorry l left you, Lucky.

359
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,040
l'm glad you found this place.

360
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,880

361
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,680
 This is the story of how we came
to live in the vast dunes of Africa...

362
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,880
...how we claimed a place that
 will always belong to us.

363
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,360
Where my children and
 their children...

364
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,200
... will always run free.
