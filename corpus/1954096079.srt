this guy had an attorney and he

he still owns the house.

Forest Hayes was the previous tenant.
But he was not the home owner.

His mother was but she's
deceased.

159
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:02,427
So it seems like what his attorney
Martin Coughlin is trying to do,

160
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,932
What he has filed... He's claiming that
Mr. Hayes never received the notice of

00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,568
default on the house payments.

162
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,938
So he has filed for a wrongful
eviction.

Ladies and gentlemen of the media,
I have requested your presence here today

00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:47,105
At my client's home,
to exemplify an all too common practice.

00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:52,243
Forcing people out of their homes and onto
the streets because they are the victims

265
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,412
of sometimes tragic
circumstances.

266
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:59,083
Circumstances beyond their control.
Shouldn't the banks be helping people

267
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:02,186
retain their property? Huh? NO!

268
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:06,391
Instead, the slightest problem
they toss them to the streets.

00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:10,995
Now Mr. Hayes terribly distraught
with the loss of his mother,

270
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:14,866
made a simple mistake. People loss
it sometimes. Don't under estimate-

271
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,534
Alright! Alright. That's enough!

We are serving you and your

275
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,911
The Turners have rightfully
purchased this property.

276
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,581
Your client has the last 15
minutes to get what he has left

277
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,151
in that house and vacate
the premises.

Mr. Hayes you said your mother
left you the home.

280
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,562
According to the county clerk's
office she did not.

281
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,433
In fact, she clearly indicated the bank
was to assume ownership of the home,

282
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,636
And all assets donated to
charity.

283
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,505
The house is the property of the

and rightfully sold to the
Turners.

move your belongings and vacate the premises
