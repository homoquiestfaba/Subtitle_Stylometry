00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,260
[Police Officer]
Copy, we have a visual.

6
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,931
This guy is flying, the
MW Unit Six in sight.

7
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:33,865
[Police Officer]
Where's my roadblock?

8
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,905

[vehicle roaring]

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:44,310
[Police Officer] He's
not fucking stopping.

11
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:48,681
[Police Officer] If you
have to apprehend suspect.

00:00:53,284 --> 00:00:56,154
[upbeat music]

14
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:59,024
[Police Officer] Driver, take
the keys out of the ignition

15
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:02,460
and put both of your hands
out the driver's side window.

16
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:10,168
Slowly exit the vehicle.

17
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:15,875
[door rattling]

18
00:01:20,912 --> 00:01:24,416
- Drop the weapon!
- Okay, I'm putting it down,

19
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:29,454
don't shoot me.
[gun thumping]

20
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:35,728
[Police Officer] Clear,
clear, anyone else in the car?

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,595
Just me.

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,102
[Officer Schiano]
What's in your trunk?

23
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:46,204
- Don't let it out!
- Don't fucking move.

24
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:50,843
Oh shit, there's
someone back there.

25
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:51,910
[Ansel] You don't
know what you've done.

26
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,344
[Police Officer] Shut up.

27
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:55,313
- Did you hear that?
- [Officer Pope] Hear what?

28
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:56,881
She said something.

29
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:58,417
[Officer Pope] I've been
standing here the whole time,

30
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,587
- I haven't heard anything.
- Get her away from me.

31
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,257
[Officer Pope] Hey man,
take it easy, what's wrong?

32
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,358
[Detective Schiano]
Please God, no!

33
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:07,626

00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,213
[Paramedic] Dispatch,
Ambulance Six.

42
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,350
I'm here at the scene, all
these people were left behind.

43
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:43,055
[Police Officer] 10
four, help is on the way.

44
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:48,093
[door rattling]
[tense music]

45
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,205
Why in God's name did you
kill those four officers?

46
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:03,408
I already told
you it wasn't me.

47
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:05,777
The only thing
I can't figure out

48
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,346
is how you managed
to pull it off.

49
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,417
Your vehicles have cameras,
take a look at the footage.

50
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:13,351
Your officer did it.

51
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,094
Why would he do that?

52
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:27,132
It's the woman, she's
not what you think.

53
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:29,335
You mean the one you
locked in the trunk?

54
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,204
[tense music]

55
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,708
What were you gonna do to her?

56
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:47,720

00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:52,891

[bag thumping]

59
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,034
So, what's in the bag?

60
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,172
The beginning of the end.

61
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:14,112
[bag rustling]
[zip zipping]

62
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,420
[flash drives thumping]

63
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:24,757
That's it?

64
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:28,794
- What are these for?
- You'd never believe me.

65
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:29,661
I wouldn't have.

66
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,567
- Try me.
- I've said enough.

67
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,174
[suspenseful music]

68
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:51,215
[door rattling]

69
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:54,853
I want everything you can
find out that guy, ASAP.

70
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:58,557
I'm on it.
[feet thumping]

71
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:13,705
Die Apokalypse naht.

72
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:16,408
[door rattling]

73
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,526
Do you wanna say anything
else before we proceed?

74
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:38,230
Rette uns alle.

75
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,637
Have it your way.

76
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:59,450
[keyboard clicking]

77
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:06,024
[birds chirping]

78
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:10,095
[Billy] So, what is this
story with this place?

79
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:17,735
Built in the late 1800s,
sits on 360 acres of land.

80
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:22,608
There's over 100 buildings
on this property.

81
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:26,444
It was designed to be
a self-contained town.

82
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:29,715
That's pretty cool.

83
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,520
It was a state run
psychiatric hospital.

84
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,489
They closed the doors
nearly 30 years ago.

85
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:41,560
Like asylums all
around the country,

86
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:45,697
invasive techniques like
prefrontal lobotomies

87
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,132
and electric shock therapy,

88
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,235
they performed it here.

89
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:54,205
People were
abused on this land.

90
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,942
Then why do you wanna shoot
at this location then?

91
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,747
I've shot here
many times before.

92
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:06,952
It always makes for a
very interesting backdrop.

93
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,557
I agree.

94
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:16,961
- Anything to worry about?
- Besides the caving ceilings

95
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:19,331
and probably peeling lead paint,

96
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:21,566
I don't see how it
could really hurt us.

97
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:29,074
Are you sure that
it's a good idea then?

98
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:34,413
Billy, I think we're gonna get

99
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,148
some really great stuff here.

100
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,851
As long as we would
watch our step inside,

101
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,921
there should be no problems.

102
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:47,959
My friend told me that
this place is haunted.

103
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:56,201
Supposedly some urban
explorers reported activity

104
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,603
of some devil worshipers.

105
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,140
But what abandoned place hasn't?

106
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,145
And like I said on the phone,

107
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:10,149
I'm paying double
my normal rate.

108
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,656
My agent says I need more
location shots in my portfolio.

109
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:26,097
And plus, I've been fascinated
by places like this.

110
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:27,833
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

111
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:34,505
Cool, listen, bats, rats,
and all sorts of insects

112
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,612
probably call this place home,

113
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:43,481
but none of them are
gonna pose a threat to us.

114
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:48,786
And the area that we're
going to is so remote

115
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,422
that no one's gonna bother us.

116
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,458
Hey, how are we
going to be here?

117
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:55,493
A couple of hours.

118
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:00,165
It wouldn't be a good idea
to be here after dark.

119
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:01,232
Oh, why not?

120
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,336
There's no light.

121
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:08,439
And it would be very
dangerous getting around

122
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,841
when the sun goes down.

123
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:20,318
[tense music]
[grass rustling]

124
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:41,740
Is everything okay?

125
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,711
Yeah, I think so.

126
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:56,288
[flies buzzing]
[feet thumping]

127
00:10:57,187 --> 00:10:58,590
Hey, hold on.

128
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:07,164
Mask, flashlight, come on.

129
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:09,834
[feet thumping]

130
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:16,674
[dramatic music]

131
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,901
[tense music]

132
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,139
[feet thumping]

133
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:07,558
Watch your head.
[eerie music]

134
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:33,552
You don't need your
mask yet, come on.

135
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:41,393
[floor boards rattling]

136
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:53,837
[Steve coughing]

137
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,174
[stone thumping]
[Billy screaming]

138
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,843
I guess we're not the
only ones here today.

139
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:01,112
Does that concern you?

140
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,682
No, this place gets
all sorts of visitors.

141
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,418
Let's go.

142
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:10,087
[feet thumping]

143
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,408
Well, let's shoot in
here, I love to light.

144
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:34,513
Okay, so where would
you want me to be?

145
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,819
- [plastic rustling]
- First, take that.

146
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,257
Put your stuff down on
it and go over there,

147
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:50,094
- let's shoot over there.
- Of course.

148
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,129
All right.

149
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:57,701
- Are you excited?
- Oh, yeah [laughs].

150
00:13:57,735 --> 00:14:00,004
- [bag thumping]
- Good, yeah,

151
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:01,873
it's gonna be awesome.

152
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:08,779

[camera snapping]

155
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:07,504
Let's switch rooms.

156
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:08,706
How about a different outfit?

157
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:10,208
Okay, I have a
pretty white dress.

158
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,210
It's right behind
you, please bring it.

159
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:18,382
[feet thumping]
[phone beeping]

[feet thumping]

162
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:36,668
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

163
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:40,404
Please help me out
of this, the bottom.

164
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:41,371
[zip zipping]

165
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:42,473
- Thank you.
- Good, okay.

[message whooshing]

169
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,627
- Steve, turn around.
- What's wrong?

170
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:07,164
- I just saw someone.
- Who?

171
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:10,501
I don't know, someone
dressed in dark clothes.

172
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:16,206
[feet thumping]

173
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,575
I don't see anybody.

174
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:19,477
[Billy] He went
around that corner.

175
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,780
[feet thumping]
Steve, be careful.

176
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:27,451
[Steve] Hello, can I help you?

177

[eerie music]

178
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:32,423
Steve?

179
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,527
[feet thumping]

180
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:39,730
Are you okay?

181
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:45,437
Steve?
[feet thumping]

182
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:49,274
[Steve grunting]
Oh my God.

183
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:53,879
Get out of here,
run, run [gurgles]!

184
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:56,713
[pepper spray spritzing]
[devil worshiper screaming]

185
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:59,583
[Billy screaming]

186
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,554
[Devil Worshiper]
Get off me [grunts].

187
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:06,258
[Billy sobbing]

188
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,340
[man screaming]

189
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:28,480
[feet thumping]

00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:44,629
[eerie music]
[fire crackling]

191
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:51,735
[devil worshiper speaks
in foreign language]

192
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:55,772
[devil worshiper laughing]

193
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:58,809
[suspenseful music]

194
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:19,396
[Operator] 911,
what's your emergency?

195
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,567
My name is Billy, Billie
Winters, we need help.

196
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,104
We are at the old psychiatric
hospital off North Zero.

197
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,172
[Operator] What's the problem?

198
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:29,807
There are people here
who killed my friend.

199
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,209
And they're now
trying to attack me.

200
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:33,344
- [twigs snapping]
- [Operator] I need you

201
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:35,278
to please remain calm.
[tense music]

202
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,580
Can you please tell me
what building you're in?

203
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:40,085
[suspenseful music]
Hello?

204
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,254
Are you still there, Ma'am?

205
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:46,890
Ma'am, hello?

206
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:54,365
Okay, we're dispatching
officers to the scene.

207
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:56,701
Please, try and find
a safe place to hide.

208
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:07,479
[Billy] No, no, no,
no, get away [screams].

209
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:16,354
[tense music]
[laptop beeping]

210
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,091
That was quite a show.

211
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:25,295
I'm a little
disappointed though.

212
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:28,265
I was expecting more than
just a pirated B-movie.

213
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:31,201
It's real.
[hand thumping]

214
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:34,605
It looks like it's
gonna be a long night.

215
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:37,375
[sirens ringing]

216
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:50,520
[engine stuttering]

217
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:52,090
- What's wrong?
- The engine just died.

218
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:53,725
We've gotta get this
woman to the hospital.

219
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:54,925
Now the radio's not working.

220
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,527
How far are we from
any kind of help?

221
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,895
- Probably a good 10 miles.
- We can't just sit here

222
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:00,965
and let her die, I'm
calling for help.

223
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:04,035
[door rattling]

224
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,302
You feel it, don't you?

225
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:08,338
Yeah, you're
giving me a headache.

226
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,308
Trust me, you don't
wanna watch those.

227
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:14,546
Give me a break.
[tense music]

228
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:18,883
[laptop beeping]

229
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:21,919
[keyboard rattling]

230
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:33,163
By "The Seraphinian
Necronomicon",

231
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:36,199
I say these words so
that you will rise again.

232
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:38,702
I say these words so that,
Satan, you will live through me.

233
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:39,871
[Mike And Gerry] Don't
say these words, Ritchie!

234
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:42,240
[eerie music]

235
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:52,750
- [Gerry] What the fuck?
- [grunts] Say you love Satan.

236
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:58,990
[upbeat music]

237
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:01,158
[Announcer] Long Island
officials point to new evidence

238
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,227
of the drug related
murder of a teenage boy

239
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,930
who allegedly was a
member of a satanic cult.

240
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:08,266
His eyes were removed
in what police described

241
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:09,800
as a ritualistic killing.

242
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:17,674
Hello again, this
is Mike Campbell

243
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,610
with the Nightmares
and Dreams Video Blog,

244
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:22,446
the blog dedicated to
the search for truth

245
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:25,082
within the realms of the
paranormal, supernatural

246
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:26,651
and the unexplained phenomenon.

247
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:30,087
[eerie music]

248
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,359
Today, I will tell you
about the true story

249
00:21:35,392 --> 00:21:37,929
I actually forgot even happened.

250
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:41,531
It's been the cause of my
nightmares for the past 30 years.

251
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:44,335
It's laid buried deep
within my psyche.

252
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:48,205
But I have an obligation to
tell the world the truth,

253
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,774
because it came back.

254
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,578
I found the book, the book
I thought we destroyed,

255
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:59,082
the book that summonses
the Devil himself.

256
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:00,250
[feet thumping]
[hoover droning]

257
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,286
Mom, what are you doing?

258
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:03,721
I'm filming my blog here!

259
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:07,224
I'm vacuuming, I'm
vacuuming, I'm sorry.

260
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:13,631
[monitor clicking]

261
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:17,234
I'm totally serious
folks, I really found it,

262
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:22,273
"The Book of the Dead", "The
Seraphinian Necronomicon".

263
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,077
Never utter these words lest
ye summon the Devil himself.

264
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:35,386
I have all the footage,
everything, I'm gonna play it now.

265
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:38,189
If you're faint of heart,
please turn this off.

266
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:42,359
The police don't even
have this footage.

267
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:47,365
And this is what really happened
in the woods back in 1984.

268
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:51,468
And that camera was
never found until now.

269
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,373
To tell you the truth, I
don't even know how I have it.

270
00:22:55,405 --> 00:23:00,411
I just woke up and right
next to my bed was this book.

271
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:06,718
And then, all the memories
came flooding back to me.

272
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:13,423
It was, I had somehow
forgotten them,

273
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:19,397
but now I know why I am who I
am, why I studied the occult,

274
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,832
why I have these dreams,

275
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:25,903
why I can't sleep for more
than three hours a night,

276
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:30,540
and why I feel like I'm being
pulled into another dimension.

277
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:34,479
He's been trying to come back.

278
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:38,949
Satan's been whispering in
my ear for the past 30 years.

279
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,527
[sips] Now, I'll show you
if you dare watch the story,

280
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:53,530
the murders in Aztakea woods

281
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:56,567
in Northport, 1984, Long Island.

282
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,002
This is completely unedited.

283
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,871
I don't know why I'm
fucking showing this.

284
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:02,772
[feet thumping]
[birds chirping]

285
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:05,209
[chattering]

286
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:20,557
Going into the woods but, and.

287
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,729
[Gerry] Dude, you
know where it was.

288
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,730
[Mike] No, I have
no idea where it is.

289
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:28,598
[Gerry] That's good.

290
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:33,171
[feet thumping]

291
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:37,741
All right, this is real good.

292
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,146
Of course she is, you
have to go and stop it.

293
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,048
- It's gonna be awful.
- You better come with me.

294
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:47,285
[Mike] Hey, you guys
wanna be in my movie?

295
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:50,087
- Ew.
- Ew, no.

296
00:24:51,454 --> 00:24:53,323
[Mrs. Rose] Michael Campbell,
please do not film people

297
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:55,093
without their permission!

298
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:57,827
Mike, where the fuck
did you get that camera?

299
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:59,397
[Mike] It's for Mrs.
Rose's art project.

300
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,765
It's supposed to be room loops

301
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,566
or just like video of your room.

302
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:04,201
But my mom won't let
me shoot our house.

303
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:05,668
Why not?

304
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:06,836
[Mike] I don't know,
something about the bunch

305
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:08,638
of recent robbery,
she's totally paranoid.

306
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:13,210
- [Ritchie singing]
- Right, this fucking kid,

307
00:25:13,242 --> 00:25:16,946
please don't mention anything
else about Black Sabbath.

308
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,149
Come on, man,
you know Sabbath.

309
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,349
Please try for
the rest of the day,

310
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:20,584
just try not to
mention one thing...

311
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:22,318
Sabbath rules, man,
you know no guitars

312
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:25,389
- is heavier than Tony Iommi.
- [Mike] Except Buck Dharma.

313
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:27,391
And don't forget
Eddie van Halen.

314
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:30,028
[boys singing]

315
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:35,766
[Mike] Guys, guys,
what's this like fucking

316
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:40,070
like tree house like fucking
birdhouse doing in the woods?

317
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:41,605
[Ritchie] Oh, shit.

318
00:25:41,637 --> 00:25:43,540
[Gerry] Hey look,
Ritch, it's about the size

319
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:45,009
of your girlfriend's cunt.

320
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,910
[Ritchie] Yeah, it's
'cause my cock is so huge.

321
00:25:46,943 --> 00:25:48,979
- [Jimmy screaming]
- [Mike] Shit, shit.

322
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:52,082
[laughs] What a bunch
of fucking pussies.

323
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:56,086
Neat camera, where'd
you steal it from?

324
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,488
[Mike] It's Mrs. Rose, so
you better not fuck with it.

325
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:01,157
It's Mrs. Rose, so you better
not fuck with it [laughs].

326
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:02,527
Who give a f...

327
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,496
Actually, Mrs. Rose
is pretty cool.

328
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:11,568
So, what are you
guys, like a gang?

329
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,807
No, we're a cult, The
Knights of the Black Circle.

330
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,509
[Gerry] I see.

331
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,677
We're fucking Satanists, man.

332
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:23,047
And if you tell anyone,
we'll fucking kill you.

333
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:25,516
Don't tell anyone,

334
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:28,920
doesn't Einstein realize
we're filming this shit?

335
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:32,023
Hey, you guys
wanna see something?

336
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:34,959
You wanna see the
power of Satan?

337
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,363
[Ritchie] Yeah, let's
see the power of Satan.

338
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:40,664
[tense music]
But first.

339
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:45,336
[Gerry] Oh, thank God.
[lighter clicking]

340
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,674
[Ritchie] I need my medicine.

341
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:53,277
You gonna share that?

342
00:26:56,078 --> 00:27:00,416
- [Gerry] Maybe.
- Give me that shit, fuck it.

343
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,819
- [Gerry] I guess we are.
- You fucking idiot.

344
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:05,255
- [Gerry] I'm sorry.
- The fuck's wrong with you?

345
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,192
A lot of things, I guess.

346
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:11,729
Where did you get
that jacket, Dafans?

347
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:13,563
[laughs] You're
a jokester, huh?

348
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:16,800
The fuck you think's funny?

349
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,069
Dafans, the jacket.

350
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:21,105
[Mike] There's
nothing around, dude.

351
00:27:21,137 --> 00:27:22,239
[Ritchie] Are you guys
gonna inhale that weed

352
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:23,840
or are you just gonna waste it?

353
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:28,011
You guys think you guys
are real jokesters, huh?

354
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:30,314
You wanna see something funny?

355
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:33,049
Fucking follow me, this way.

356
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,355
[leaves rustling]

357
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:42,659
[tense music]

358
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:48,097
[screams] Don't get
to close to that, man.

359
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:49,934
You can summon Satan
with that shit.

360
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:52,135
You think that's funny, queer?

361
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:53,804
[Mike] Sounds like bullshit.

362
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:55,004
You have to sacrifice...

363
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:56,507
[Man] Shut the fuck up, Terry.

364
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,908
[Ritchie] What are you
guys doing with that cat?

365
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:00,443
[Gerry] Yeah, you
better not hurt it.

366
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:01,946
Whoa, whoa, all
right, relax, okay?

367
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:04,782
It's my sister's cat, I just
gotta watch it for the weekend.

368
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,451
[Gerry] So, you don't mind
if we tape everyone, do you?

369
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,220
Go right ahead,
what do I care?

370
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,621
We'll be on the other
side soon, anyways.

371
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:12,855
The fourth dimension, man.

372
00:28:12,888 --> 00:28:14,757
[Gerry] Oh my God,
this kid's been at it.

373
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,062
No, no, no, I heard
Aleister Crowley used to talk

374
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:22,766
about the fourth dimension,
Satan rules over it [laughs].

375
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:24,367
- Mr. Crowley.
- [Mike] Mr. Crowley!

376
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:26,370
- You've been reading too many...
- No, no, no, no.

377
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:28,639
Your friend here
nailed it, okay?

378
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:29,839
[eerie music]
The Thelmians knew about it.

379
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:31,475
That's the religion
Crowley started,

380
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:32,742
but it goes back
farther, though,

381
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:34,711
to like the ancient
Egyptians and shit.

382
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:37,480
Then Anton LaVey came
along, he knew about majik.

383
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:40,917
That's M-A-J-I-K,
it's conjuring.

384
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:43,687
You can talk to Satan,
and he's alive and well.

385
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,489
It's in the fucking
Bible, all right?

386
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:47,290
He's supposed to be
free after 1,000 years.

387
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:49,393
[Ritchie] All right, so,
how do you summon Satan?

388
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:52,428
[Terry] Ugh, I don't
feel so good, tell him.

389
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:54,064
Well, I've been researching,

390
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:56,567
and there's all kinds of
rituals you have to follow,

391
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:59,202
but until I find a book
with a certain chant,

392
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:01,238
I can't do it, and I've tried
a million different ways.

393
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,839
Wait, what book?

394
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,975
'Cause my uncle owns a
bookstore up in Main.

395
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:10,014
He specializes in those weird
like hard to find books.

396
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:12,316
He could get any book on loan.

397
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:14,384
Yeah, yeah, yeah, his
books are always mint, man.

398
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:15,585
Needless Things, right?

399
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:17,955
Uh.

400
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:19,490
The book's been translated
into different languages.

401
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:21,891
But the text, now the
text is in a language

402
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:23,092
that no one can decipher.

403
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,061
So, most experts
think it's bullshit.

404
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,364
It has some kickass
drawings in it, though.

405
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:30,266
I've seen pictures in
another book about it.

406
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,168
People mangled with machinery,

407
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:34,904
animals with wheels implanted
into 'em, and crazy shit.

408
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:37,107
Supposedly, the guy who
wrote it was in a trance.

409
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,076
And he entered Satan's kingdom
in the fourth dimension

410
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:40,711
and he came back with the words,

411
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,648
with the words the allow
the Devil to come back here.

412
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:46,350
- The book is called...
- [Girl] Hits, hits!

413
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,018
Oh, shit, cops, go, go, go.

414
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,252
[Police Officer]
God damned kids!

415
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:54,225
[feet thumping]
[leaves rustling]

416
00:29:58,627 --> 00:30:01,298
[Mike vomiting]

417
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,907
Mike, can we see any part
of your video project yet?

418
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,709
[Mike] I'm filming
it right now.

419
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:12,909
[birds chirping]

420
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:15,046
What's up with you two,
you look fucked up?

421
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:20,483
We're on acid, Ritchie
got it from Jimmy.

422
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:25,422
- [Mike] I'm so sure.
- No, really [laughs].

423
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:27,891
We're tripping our faces
off, dude [laughs].

424
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:34,431
You look like a fucking
replica from "Blade Runner".

425
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:38,134
No, no, he looks
more like a scanner.

426
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,670
Run, his head's gonna
explode [laughs]!

427
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:46,476
Wait, I have a joke.

428
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,979
You are a joke, man.

429
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:51,115
Wait, no, no, listen, listen.

430
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:55,818
All right, so this guy
joins the Army, right?

431
00:30:55,852 --> 00:30:59,390
And after the first week, he
realizes he's in this big...

432
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:02,726
What the fuck do you call 'em?

433
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,328
Barracks, all right,
he's in this big,

434
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:06,630
he's in this big barracks,

435
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,732
sharing a room with
like 100 other guys.

436
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,000
And he's really horny,

437
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:13,437
but he can't whack
off because, you know,

438
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,506
all the other guys are
around and stuff, you know?

439
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:17,607
So, he goes to the sergeant,

440
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:21,144
and he's like, "Sarge,
I got a problem.

441
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:26,183
"I'm really horny, but I got
nowhere to take care of it,

442
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:28,484
"if you know what I mean."

443
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:30,754
And the sergeant's like, "Yeah,
yeah, I know what you mean.

444
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:32,155
"I know exactly what
you're talking about.

445
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:34,091
"We got just the
thing for that."

446
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:37,227
So, he brings him around
the corner of the tent

447
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:40,897
to this big barrel with the
little hole in the side.

448
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:44,802
And he's like, "Go ahead,
stick your pecker in there."

449
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,470
[Mike] In the barrel?

450
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,239
Yeah, in the barrel.

451
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:53,644
So he puts his thing inside
the barrel and he's just like,

452
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:59,583
"Oh, God," [laughs]
he's like, "Holy shit.

453
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:04,421
"Oh my God, this is
fucking awesome."

454
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:09,426
And he's like, "Sarge,"
he says to him,

455
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:12,061
"you can use it
anytime you want.

456
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:15,499
"Except on Tuesdays."

457
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:18,601
So the guy's like, "Why,
what happens on Tuesdays?"

458
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:24,808
And so, the Sarge goes, "That's
your day inside the barrel."

459
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:31,382
[boys laughing]
You get it?

460
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:33,217
I didn't think so.

461
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,252
[aircraft droning]

462
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:42,560
That's good, that's
one of my better jokes.

463
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:47,998
Gerry told me he's gay.

464
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:51,401
What?

465
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:54,171
He tried touching me
right before you walked in.

466
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:55,471
No, I didn't.

467
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:58,642
Then, then why is your
penis so hard [laughs]?

468
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:01,211
You mother fucker!

469
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:05,081
[Ritchie and Gerry grunting]

470
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:06,916
[Mike] Hey, cut the shit,
you two, you're gonna kill him!

471
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,184
[Ritchie] I'll
fucking kill you!

472
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:09,353
[Mike] You're just
having a bad trip!

473
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:10,988
Get the fuck off of me,

474
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:14,191
- fucking asshole.
- Fucking pussy.

475
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:15,525
Get the fuck outta here.

476
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,328
Fucking piece of shit.

477
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:26,237
Eddie Van Halen is still
better than Tony Iommi.

478
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:31,709
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment has arrived.

479
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:34,144
We will now be full members

480
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:35,645
of the Knights of
the Black Circle.

481
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,215
Fuck the Knights, what
do we need them for?

482
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:39,950
[Mike] Shit, I
forgot my BOC tape.

483
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:42,085
You guys gotta hear this
song, "Take Me Away".

484
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:45,121
It's fucking heavy, it's about
aliens abducting this dude

485
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:46,956
that wants to be taken
away from his shit home.

486
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,559
Mike, could you
please shut the fuck up

487
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:52,062
so I could get this
damned thing open?

488
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:55,332
- [Mike] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Gerry] I'm having

489
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:57,701
- a hard time here.
- Come on, come on.

490
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:02,371
[Gerry] I'm trying.
[plastic rustling]

491
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:03,205
- There we go.
- [Ritchie] Pfft,

492
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,408
what the fuck is that?

493
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:08,778
Wait, there's more.
[plastic rustling]

494
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:12,348
Yes, oh, I want more
bubble wrap, me too.

495
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:19,188
Oh, I forgot to
tell you guys this.

496
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:22,092
- This weed was dusted.
- [Mike] What's dusted?

497
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,726
[eerie music]

498
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,931
- [Ritchie laughing]
- This book is fucking creepy.

499
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:30,467
[Mike] Shit, hold it up
so I can film it better.

500
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:35,639
[girl singing]
Holy shit, man.

501
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:39,442
- What the fuck was that?
- [Ritchie] I don't know.

502
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:44,481
[belches] I can't get it, Jesus.

503
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:48,150
Let's see if you
could do any better.

504
00:34:48,184 --> 00:34:50,621
- You suck, watch.
- [Ritchie] Yeah, I have one.

505
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:55,659
- [belches] Fuck.
- [Ritchie] [laughs]

506
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:57,561
You suck worse than me.

507
00:34:57,594 --> 00:34:58,961
- Shut the fuck up.
- [Mike] Yeah, we all suck

508
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:01,764
at burping, you
guys, let's see that.

509
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:04,000
[Gerry] "Seraphinian
Necronomicon".

510
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:07,570
[tense music]
[Ritchie laughing]

511
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:11,907
- [Gerry choking]
- [Ritchie] You okay, Ger?

512
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,876
Geez man, what the hell?

513
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:19,449
[Gerry vomiting]
Fuck, dude.

514
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:23,019
Did he eat something?

515
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:33,829
[Mike] Dude, I
don't know what to do.

516
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:36,599
[Gerry spitting]

517
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:38,802
[Ritchie] Hey,
Gerry, say something,

518
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:42,204
man, are you all right?
[Gerry gasping]

519
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:43,639
[Mike] It's that fucking book.

520
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:46,342
[Ritchie] Dude, what happened?

521
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:54,451
[upbeat music]

522
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:11,567
Buck Dharma totally
smells Eddie Van Halen.

523
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,871
- [Mike's Mother knocking]
- [Mike's Mother] Sweetheart,

524
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:17,007
you're gonna be late for school.

525
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,375
Just a second!

526
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:26,282
All right, Mike, this
is Wendy and Susan.

527
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:29,018
- [birds chirping]
- They're sisters.

528
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:29,887
[Mike] No, duh.

529
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:35,359
Ah, warm PBRs are
better than no PBRs.

530
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,496
Mike, take it slow.

531
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,536
- You don't wanna P-U-K-E.
- You're not like six.

532
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:49,306
We can spell you, you idiot.
[Susan laughing]

533
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:56,480
[Wendy spitting]
[Ritchie laughing]

534
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:10,660
[Ritchie and Susan kissing]

535
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:13,195
- [Ritchie laughing]
- What's with the camera?

536
00:37:13,228 --> 00:37:14,130
[Mike] It's for
Mrs. Rose class.

537
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:15,766
I'm doing it as a video project.

538
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:20,804
Can we be in it,
please, please, please?

539
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:23,306
[Wendy And Susan]
Please, please, please,

540
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,309
please, please, please,
please, please, please, please?

541
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:31,914
[Ritchie] Oh, fuck yeah.
[Susan and Wendy giggling]

542
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:35,918
Okay, you can be in, I
think you got the part.

543
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:38,088
Hey, so I read three
lines from that book.

544
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:39,588
[Mike] When?

545
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:44,228
Yesterday, the picture
had a girl giving herself

546
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:48,398
to a guy, or maybe it was
a werewolf, I don't know.

547
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:53,436
Anyways, I read the chant,
and next thing you know,

548
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,405
I'm at the gazebo
with the two sisters,

549
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,742
and the rest is history.

550
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:02,979
[Mike] Man, those
chicks are freaky.

551
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:05,916
Did you see them totally
making out, that shit was hot?

552
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,818
Yeah, it's a Satanic miracle.

553
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,920
The guy who can't
even score one girl

554
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:12,188
gets not one but
two lovely ladies

555
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:14,291
and manages to bring
them out to the woods?

556
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:18,162
[Mike] Holy shit.
[tense music]

557
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:24,201
There's nothing holy about it.

558
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:33,242
[Ritchie and Mike laughing]

559
00:38:33,275 --> 00:38:35,411
Yeah, I'm sure
it was a werewolf.

560
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:38,849
You guys are fucking dicks.
[leaves rustling]

561
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:40,918
[Mike] Dude, where
the fuck is Ritchie?

562
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:45,454
I don't know, I haven't
seen him in so long.

563
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:47,223
I think he got
kicked outta school.

564
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,826
He cut out so many
frigging times.

565
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:52,161
And then he showed
up to Nadler's class,

566
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:54,364
tripping his fucking face off.

567
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:55,565
[Mike] Nadler's class?
[birds chirping]

568
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:57,433
- No wonder he got kicked out.
- Yeah.

569
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:01,503
[Mike] I tried calling him,

570
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:02,905
but his mom said he
wasn't available.

571
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:05,541
What does, "Wasn't
available," mean anyway?

572
00:39:05,574 --> 00:39:06,777
I have no idea.

573
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:10,680
Look, he probably...

574
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:12,782
[Mike] What?

575
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:15,418
Spit it out, Gilligan.

576
00:39:16,885 --> 00:39:19,755
I don't know, remember it
was his turn with the book?

577
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,258
[Mike] Yeah, so?

578
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:26,263
Well, he said that he
figured out the text.

579
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:28,063
He said he could
actually understand all

580
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:31,201
that fucking gibberish,
said an angel came

581
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,036
to him in a dream
and touched him.

582
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:34,271
[Mike] Oh, maybe
it was that angel

583
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:37,206
from that CZ Top video,
I wish she'd touch me.

584
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:42,245
No, it was a black angel, he
said, from Satan's universe,

585
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:45,615
or hell, or whatever
the fuck he read.

586
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:49,552
I have no clue, but
she had black wings,

587
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:52,222
and she was touching
his forehead and shit.

588
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:54,324
I don't know.

589
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,092
Okay, how about this?

590
00:39:57,126 --> 00:39:58,495
He wakes up in the morning

591
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:01,030
and the book is on
his fucking chest.

592
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:04,466
Meanwhile, the night before
he, hides it in his closet

593
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,103
so his old man wouldn't find it.

594
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:10,740
How does a book that he hid
in his closet the night before

595
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:12,575
end up on his chest
the next morning?

596
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:14,845
I mean, tell me that
is not unbelievable.

597
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:18,414
[Mike] You actually
believe that shit?

598
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:19,548
Ritch has been doing like a hit

599
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:21,083
of acid every day for a month.

600
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:22,719
He's nuts, that's all.

601
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,655
I don't know.

602
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:28,858
The last time that I spoke
to him, he sounded weird.

603
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:33,129
And it wasn't drugs.

604
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:35,764
Like, he just sounded weird.

605
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:40,803
Like I think he's obsessed.
[Ritchie screaming]

606
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:43,973
[Ritchie laughing]

607
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:47,077
- Oh my God, Ritchie.
- How's school, losers?

608
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,046
[Mike] Hey man, where
the fuck you been?

609
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,615
You look like shit,
did you lose 10 pounds?

610
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:54,017
Yeah, and where's my book?

611
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,619
Your book, your book?

612
00:40:57,652 --> 00:40:59,121
- Yeah, my book.
- [Ritchie] It's all

613
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:01,358
of mankind's book, man, and
it's opening up a portal

614
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:02,759
- to the fourth dimension.
- [Mike] Yup, he's lost it.

615
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,159
- Exactly.
- I'm not joking, man.

616
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:05,662
This shit, it works.

617
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:10,432
Every time I do an incantation,
I feel this powers.

618
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:13,569
It's better than any drug
I've ever done before.

619
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,473
- And I can hear him.
- [Gerry] Oh my God.

620
00:41:16,505 --> 00:41:17,740
I hear the whispers.

621
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,909
[Gerry] Yeah, how many
drugs have you done?

622
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:22,912
[Mike] You look like you're
losing it, are you okay?

623
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:25,115
- I'm fine, man.
- [Mike] Hey, fuck off me.

624
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,650
- Are you nuts?
- Hey, I'll show you.

625
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:30,387
[leaves rustling]

626
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,253
I'm right here.

627
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:34,123
[Mike] Dude, get the
fuck down from there.

628
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:35,492
[Gerry] Ritchie, what
the fuck you doing?

629
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:37,494
Get down, you're gonna fall.

630
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:39,262
[Ritchie] I'm over here.

631
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:41,630
- [Gerry] What the fuck?
- [Mike] What the fuck did?

632
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:42,766
[Gerry] Ritchie, how
the fuck did, okay,

633
00:41:42,798 --> 00:41:44,134
where the fuck did he go?

634
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,201
[Ritchie] I'm right here.
[Mike yelling]

635
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,369
[Gerry] What are you doing?

636
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:47,170
[Mike] It's
fucking impossible.

637
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:48,304
[Gerry] Holy shit!

638
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,709
So, I've been
studying the book,

639
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,577
and there were all these
different incantations.

640
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,781
So, like warmups for the
final materialization.

641
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:01,251
And once the door is
breached, he enters,

642
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:03,653
and it's only happened like
12 other times in history

643
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:04,653
when he's come over.

644
00:42:04,686 --> 00:42:05,954
But he could never
hold on to his power

645
00:42:05,987 --> 00:42:07,256
and he had to go back.

646
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:09,391
He was thinking too
big and too broadly,

647
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:11,094
getting into politics
and world affairs.

648
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:14,130
But now he knows
he's gotta sneak in

649
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:15,798
by tearing a small
rip in the curtain,

650
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:17,701
building an army of darkness.

651
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:21,271
[Gerry] So, this is
why we haven't seen you

652
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:22,472
in over a month?

653
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:25,474
No, I got an Atari,
"Space Invaders".

654
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:26,742
It's unbelievable, man.

655
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:29,311
[Mike] So, what's next?

656
00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:31,914
Well, in order
to get some power,

657
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:33,615
you have to sacrifice something.

658
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:35,717
That little trick I did
earlier used everything up,

659
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:37,354
but I just had to show you guys.

660
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:40,657
Look over there.

661
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:49,199
What the fuck is that?

662
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:55,637
Holy shit, it's Jimmy's
sister's fucking cat.

663
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,841
[Mike] Fuck, the knife's
still bloody, oh God.

664
00:43:00,742 --> 00:43:02,144
[Gerry] Where's
the fucking head?

665
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:05,848
[gags] Oh my God
[gags] [vomits].

666
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:17,894
So, I wanna warn the
faithful followers

667
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:19,429
of the Nightmares
and Dreams Video Blog

668
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:22,498
that what you're about to
see is the unedited truth.

669
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:25,702
It's not for the faint
of heart or from minors.

670
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:28,472
Hopefully you didn't hack
into your daddy's PC.

671
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,975
[eerie music]

672
00:43:34,443 --> 00:43:35,345
You may not believe your eyes

673
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:37,080
of what you're about to witness.

674
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:39,948
It's none other than Satan
himself being summoned.

675
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:41,416
[eerie music]

676
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:43,285
I made you chocolate chip
cookies, your favorite.

677
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:47,456
[cookie thumping]
[monitor clicking]

678
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:50,058
Mike, why did you bring
me out here in the woods?

679
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:52,628
And what are you always
filming everything for?

680
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:54,596
[Mike] I told you, it's
for Mrs. Rose's art class.

681
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,233
It's supposed to be room
loops, not woods loops.

682
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:01,904
Whatever, that's like the
stupidest thing I've ever heard.

683
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:05,208
Just hold this while
I read this chant.

684
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:13,916
[speaks in foreign language]
[eerie music]

685
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:27,197
[Susan screaming]
[flesh tearing]

686
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,597
Fuck, Susan, where did you go?

687
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:33,502
Susan, Susan, Susan,
where are you, Susan?

688
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:36,806
[liquid trickling]
[rain splattering]

689
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:38,373
What the fuck?

690
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:40,476
What the fuck, where
the fuck did she go?

691
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:43,246
She's fucking gone,
she's fucking dead.

692
00:44:43,278 --> 00:44:47,317
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit, Susan!

693
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:48,250
[eerie music]

694
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:50,820
What the fuck, holy shit, Susan!

695
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:54,791
What the fuck, it it
wasn't raining a second ago.

696
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:56,693
[Mike] Fuck the rain, you
guys gotta see the footage,

697
00:44:56,726 --> 00:44:57,927
she's fucking dead!

698
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,228
Why the fuck you
still filming then?

699
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:00,463
We have to destroy it.

700
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,264
[Mike] It proves we
didn't do anything.

701
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,871
You guys, I think this
fucking hole ate her.

702
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:13,543
Yo, fuck you, I'm with Mike,
we film everything from now on.

703
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:15,644
We have to have proof that
this shit fucking happened.

704
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:17,579
What, like the fucking
Devil is just gonna step out

705
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:20,716
for an interview if we say
another spell from the book?

706
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,853
Let me see that you [speaks
in foreign language].

707
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,495
[blood splattering]
What the fuck?

708
00:45:33,795 --> 00:45:36,131
- [Gerry] Holy shit.
- What the fuck just happened?

709
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:38,967
- [Ritchie and Gerry grunting]
- [Mike] Doolb, doolb, Natas,

710
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:42,805
it's Satan, don't you guys
see, it's blood, it's backward?

711
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:45,875
They're just words, but
everything is backwards.

712
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:48,243
Doolb is blood, Natas is Satan.

713
00:45:48,277 --> 00:45:52,548
You just asked Satan to bathe
you in doolb, I mean, blood.

714
00:45:53,882 --> 00:45:55,284
- [wings fluttering]
- What, that fucking thing

715
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:56,786
just almost hit me in the head.

716
00:45:58,688 --> 00:45:59,990
Fuck, let's go.

717
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,028
Go, go, go!

718
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:09,631
[Ritchie] Let's get
the fuck out of here!

719
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:14,603
[chattering]
[feet thumping]

720
00:46:25,146 --> 00:46:26,982
What the fuck?

721
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:28,184
You realize we should have run

722
00:46:28,217 --> 00:46:29,251
into Church Street
by now, right?

723
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:30,619
No, we should have run
into the harbor by now.

724
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:31,987
Where the fuck are we?

725
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:38,061
The fucking hole, how
the did we get back here?

726
00:46:39,527 --> 00:46:40,896
[Mike] Gerry, goes what
page the book is open to!

727
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:43,198
Fuck no, why doesn't
Satan's lover over here do it?

728
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:46,402
- Don't call me that?
- Shut the fuck up, Ritchie!

729
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:48,737
You're the one who got us
into all this crazy shit.

730
00:46:49,972 --> 00:46:51,407
What the fuck has it shown?

731
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,742
[Mike] I'll go do it myself.

732
00:46:57,278 --> 00:46:59,882
[eerie music]

733
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:03,251
It says, "Final incantation

734
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:06,221
"for materialization
of the Dark Lord.

735
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:08,925
"Ye who read these words now sit

736
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,760
"at the side of the Desolate One

737
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:13,963
"who shall reclaim
dominion over this world

738
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:17,066
"and all other
dimensions within."

739
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:20,870
Holy shit, the hole's bleeding.

740
00:47:20,902 --> 00:47:24,440
[Ritchie] Let me see that,
move, I wanna read this.

741
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,579
Don't say these words.

742
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:32,581
Oh, Ritchie, don't say
these words, Ritchie!

743
00:47:32,614 --> 00:47:35,083
Ritchie, don't say these
words, come on, Ritchie!

744
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:37,019
- Don't say these word.
- Hey, honey!

745
00:47:38,186 --> 00:47:41,824
Don't say these words,
don't say these words!

746
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:47,764
Say you love Satan!
[Ritchie grunting]

747
00:47:49,597 --> 00:47:54,603
[blood splattering]
[Mike's Mother laughing]

748
00:48:03,077 --> 00:48:04,847
Hey, what's up, eh?

749
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:07,650
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, I am.

750
00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:09,518
[Woman] I did not do
this, I am innocent,

751
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:12,155
and I have to tell you and
you, I did not do this.

752
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:13,689
I don't know why
nobody will believe me,

753
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:15,158
- but I am so outta here.
- [Police Officer] Hey, hey!

754
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,358
What the hell is up with this?

755
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:17,926
[Police Officer] Where
you going, come on,

756
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,195
what are you doing?

757
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:20,695
- Let's go.
- I'm trying to tell you.

758
00:48:20,728 --> 00:48:22,197
- No one will believe em.
- How did she get in here,

759
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:23,566
- anyway, in the first place?
- [Woman] What, isn't that

760
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,334
- that rock star?
- Hey, you need to shut up

761
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:27,670
and come with me,
move it, let's go.

762
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:30,673
What was that?

763
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,474
That show was some crazy shit.

764
00:48:32,507 --> 00:48:34,210
Yeah, what do you think?

765
00:48:34,242 --> 00:48:36,711
Maybe those kids at Long
Island that disappeared?

766
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:38,146
Christ, do you think
there's a connection?

767
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:39,714
That's all we need.

768
00:48:39,748 --> 00:48:41,951
Yeah, I hate the weird ones.

769
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,386
Speaking of which, I
wanna show you something.

770
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,425
[envelope rustling]
[eerie music]

771
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:57,366
What the hell is this?

772
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:00,202
It's totally unrelatable,
but this whole thing

773
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:02,137
with Schneider has
got me thinking,

774
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,207
this happened when I was
in L.A. about 10 years ago.

775
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,244
A cable repair guy murdered
three residential customers

776
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:09,512
before being gunned down.

777
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:12,916
It's horrible.

778
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:16,152
- A cable repair guy?
- Yeah.

779
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:23,192
He claimed the Devil live
inside his cable box.

780
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,029
Wonderful, now I've
officially heard everything.

781
00:49:30,065 --> 00:49:33,001
[Man] It's horrible.
[chattering]

782
00:49:33,034 --> 00:49:34,803
We've gotta her
her temperature down.

783
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:39,107
[blanket rustling]

784
00:49:40,775 --> 00:49:45,781
Dr. Goode.
[eerie music]

785
00:49:47,148 --> 00:49:50,252
[Dr. Goode grunting]

786
00:49:52,253 --> 00:49:55,924
[Detective Semler coughing]

787
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:04,600
I'll be back.
[eerie music]

788
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,179
You've been infected.

789
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:19,981
[Frank] Pal, I got
allergies, all right?

790
00:50:20,014 --> 00:50:21,116
It's a real bitch.

791
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:25,254
- What about your partner?
- You know what?

792
00:50:25,286 --> 00:50:27,689
Maybe you ought to worry
about yourself for now.

793
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:38,134
There's not a blemish
on this guy's record.

794
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:40,235
I mean, he's never even
had a speeding ticket.

795
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:42,971
Well, maybe he snapped, I
mean, we've seen that before.

796
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:46,242
He's supposed to be some kind
of hot shot computer expert.

797
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:49,045
His specialty's creating
antivirus software.

798
00:50:49,077 --> 00:50:50,579
The guy's loaded.

799
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:52,681
Just last week, some
European company transferred

800
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:54,517
a couple of mill to
his bank account.

801
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,153
Any word on the
woman in the trunk?

802
00:50:58,186 --> 00:50:59,955
Nothing so far.

803
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:01,356
Get on that, all right?

804
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:03,158
I also need you to look
at the dashboard footage

805
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:05,226
from both squad cars.

806
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,362
Okay.

807
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:09,032
[feet thumping]

808
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:19,175
[eerie music]

809
00:51:20,442 --> 00:51:22,545
Just what are we
gonna find on this one?

810
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:32,588
[laptop beeping]
[keyboard rattling]

811
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:35,625
[placid music]

812
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:37,826
This lovely looking
thing femme fatale

813
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:42,798
is Magdalena Forte,
my soon to be ex-wife.

814
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:46,568
Don't let the glamor fool
you, she's a bit of a jerk.

815
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:49,404
You see, that's not me.

816
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:53,276
That's Eric Valentine, my
supposedly filmmaking partner.

817
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:56,945
He and I co-directed, I shot it,

818
00:51:56,978 --> 00:51:59,281
and my celebrity wife
was the producer.

819
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:03,151
The lady in blue is his
latest person of interest.

820
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,391
And the lady in red, that his
wife's twin sister, Marlene.

821
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:11,326
She'll do whatever it takes
for a part in his next project.

822
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:15,196
So, where's his wife, Lilliana?

823
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:18,000
Apparently they could
only muster up two invites

824
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:20,802
for the screening, I'm
just the cinematographer,

825
00:52:20,835 --> 00:52:23,071
and Lilliana's just
a supporting actress.

826
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:25,074
So, no red carpets for us.

827
00:52:26,842 --> 00:52:30,579
That dude there, looking
back to the trailer monitor

828
00:52:30,612 --> 00:52:33,182
is Henry Greenberg,
Eric's managing.

829
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,818
He's making sure Eric
doesn't get totally wasted

830
00:52:36,851 --> 00:52:39,521
before his Q and A
after the screening.

831
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:42,223
He's also making
sure Eric and my wife

832
00:52:42,257 --> 00:52:43,559
don't have a lover's quarrel

833
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:45,827
when they're supposed
to promote the film.

834
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,897
Meanwhile, back in Eric's
production high out,

835
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:51,599
I'm setting up cameras for
a live show that will air

836
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:54,669
in the very monitoring they're
using to show the trailer.

837
00:52:54,702 --> 00:52:56,739
And Eric's wife, Lilliana?

838
00:52:56,771 --> 00:52:59,541
Well, she's the fucking star.

839
00:53:02,277 --> 00:53:04,847
[blade grinding]
Nice.

840
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,282
Gotta give it to you, Eric,

841
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:08,784
you own some pretty
bad ass gear.

842
00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:12,454
I sold those receipts
for the Alexa bodies,

843
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:14,156
but the ship date's
for next month.

844
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,661
[feet thumping]

845
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:19,862
So, I would have
thought you would have

846
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:21,797
at least taken the Epic
with you to Khan's.

847
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:24,533
But like you told
your line producer,

848
00:53:24,565 --> 00:53:27,335
why transfer it overseas what
you can rent for cheaper?

849
00:53:34,943 --> 00:53:38,581
So awesome, love
these RED Pro Primes.

850
00:53:39,447 --> 00:53:41,049
So underrated for the price.

851
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,952
Complained about this?

852
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:46,288
Oh, you're just a snob, right?

853
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:56,599
You left the GoPros behind too.

854
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:58,099
So, I'm guessing
you finally bought

855
00:53:58,132 --> 00:54:00,302
those Blackmagic cameras
you've been ranting about.

856
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:05,173
These microphones
are pretty good too.

857
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:12,280
Aren't GoPros awesome?

858
00:54:12,313 --> 00:54:14,549
You can put 'em anywhere.

859
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,085
I'm sure your red carpet sendoff

860
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:18,286
is gonna be a great
warmup for France,

861
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,722
but I'm having
quite a bit of fun

862
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:23,425
with a small but interesting
crew, including Henry,

863
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:25,695
the bouncer that punched
you out last summer.

864
00:54:27,862 --> 00:54:29,431
He's our boom operator.

865
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:35,871
And Paco, your
favorite custodian,

866
00:54:35,903 --> 00:54:37,907
who you hated because you swear

867
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,675
you caught both our
wives checking him out.

868
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,877
Well now, when I
hustled up the crew

869
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:44,713
and broke into your apartment,

870
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:47,081
he's the first guy I thought of.

871
00:54:47,114 --> 00:54:52,120
[upbeat music]
[chattering]

872
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:11,840
[blade grinding]
Tada, this is the money shot,

873
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:13,041
but don't get me wrong.

874
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:15,543
These other angles would
be pretty good too.

875
00:55:15,577 --> 00:55:17,746
You know, I always
deliver you your coverage.

876
00:55:17,778 --> 00:55:19,280
[placid music]
We've never had to go back

877
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:21,817
to a location because we
didn't get enough coverage.

878
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:24,786
[machine rattling]

879
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:32,427
Our movie star's here.
[feet thumping]

880
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,130
[door rattling]

881
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:38,367
Wow, Manny, what
a setup [laughs].

882
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:43,739
Whoa, your wife is looking
especially hot today, Eric.

883
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:48,777
- I'm gonna love this.
- Manny, why so many cameras?

884
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:51,046
[Manny] Because
you're a star, Lilliana,

885
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:54,016
- you're a fucking star.
- Well, I brought

886
00:55:56,717 --> 00:56:00,388
four different outfits,
I hope you like them.

887
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:01,990
[Manny] I'm sure
I'm gonna like them.

888
00:56:02,023 --> 00:56:04,893
But I have a feeling you're
probably just gonna need one.

889
00:56:06,994 --> 00:56:09,565
Which one do you want
me to try on first?

890
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:11,099
Surprise me, Lilliana.

891
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:13,234
Go in the bathroom and put
on whichever one you want.

892
00:56:13,268 --> 00:56:14,737
No matter what you wear,

893
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:17,706
the audience is just gonna
want you to take it off.

894
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,809
[laughs] You're so silly.

895
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:23,646
What about makeup?

896
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,715
Don't you dare hid
that beautiful face

897
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:28,483
behind a single ounce of makeup.

898
00:56:32,186 --> 00:56:35,056
I'm gonna finish setting up.

899
00:56:36,224 --> 00:56:40,729
All right, I'm gonna
change while you set up.

900
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:42,198
Don't change too much.

901
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:51,740
Remember, make me look good.

902
00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:55,110
Looking good is
your department.

903
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:57,413
I'm just here to
make you a star.

904
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,688
This is the camera
you'll be favoring

905
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:10,059
as you get choked out
into its fixation,

906
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:12,360
while you will climax
during intercourse.

907
00:57:14,396 --> 00:57:15,631
I know, crazy, right?

908
00:57:16,498 --> 00:57:18,567
That's how Kung Fu died, right?

909
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,769
Hanging from a noose with
his pecker in his hand?

910
00:57:21,802 --> 00:57:24,406
That's what Eric here told
me at the Christmas party.

911
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:30,179
Anywho, Paco, our
male feature actor

912
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:32,480
will be lying right
here on your pillow

913
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:35,050
as your wife crawls up
into our A camera angle

914
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:38,354
for the big finish,
and guess what?

915
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:40,990
I'm gonna recruit
just like you like it.

916
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:44,593
Most cameras remain static,
yet strategically placed,

917
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:45,828
and check this out.

918
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,297
We'll save even more
money on this freebie

919
00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:52,201
by using your neighborhood
free labor crew.

920
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:55,204
How's that for cutting corners?

921
00:57:55,237 --> 00:57:58,907
Hey, I didn't even bother with
casting notices on agencies.

922
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,378
Who needs agency when
assholes like you brag

923
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:05,347
to the fellows that their
wife loves getting choked out

924
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,017
and that she fucks
like a woman possessed?

925
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:12,387
Really man, guys like you
who share the sexual exploits

926
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,723
with other guys are
just asking for this.

927
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:17,460
Well now, old husband of mine,

928
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:20,762
I'm finally number
one on the call sheet.

929
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:24,599
Hopefully I won't ruin this.

930
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:27,369
But hey, what
do you always say?

931
00:58:27,402 --> 00:58:31,072
Save money, gold and tits
trump talent any day.

932
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:33,842
We get it now, Eric, we're
gonna try it your way.

933
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,911
No deal memo and no permits.

934
00:58:35,943 --> 00:58:37,813
That's why we're
here in your office.

935
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,715
No permits necessary.

936
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:46,722
I can't just set
four static cameras

937
00:58:46,755 --> 00:58:47,856
and hope we get lucky.

938
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:51,494
[feet thumping]

939
00:59:14,615 --> 00:59:19,288
Well, I'm kinda nervous,
that rarely happens.

940
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,989
I guess this is
gonna be special.

941
00:59:22,556 --> 00:59:26,294
I know, Eric, a little cheesy,
but fitting, don't you think?

942
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:31,032
[Lilliana] Okay,
Manny, I'm ready.

01:10:00,194 --> 01:10:05,200
[crickets chirping]
[heels clicking]

1021
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:09,738
[Deena] No, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

1022
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:10,905
[Myra] Deena, it's fine.

1023
01:10:18,311 --> 01:10:20,448
[eerie music]

1024
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,585
Oh my God, oh my God!
[women screaming]

1025
01:10:24,618 --> 01:10:25,853
I don't know where we are,

1026
01:10:25,886 --> 01:10:27,387
but there's an ambulance

1027
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:28,856
and there's blood
fucking everywhere!

1028
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,091
[Myra] I think we're
in Orange Grove Drive.

1029
01:10:30,123 --> 01:10:31,859
Orange Grove Drive,
Orange Grove Drive,

1030
01:10:31,893 --> 01:10:33,694
but there's blood everywhere!

1031
01:10:33,728 --> 01:10:37,498
- [women screaming]
- Oh my God!

1032
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:40,034
[tense music]

1033
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:48,175
Why didn't you tell
me she was your wife?

1034
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,844
It's more
complicated than that.

1035
01:10:49,877 --> 01:10:52,213
Well, maybe this will
give us some answers.

1036
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:54,149
[Ansel] You don't know
what you're doing, Detective.

1037
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:02,289
[keyboard rattling]

1038
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:11,132
[birds chirping]
[bell ringing]

1039
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:17,139
[gravel crunching]

1040
01:11:24,478 --> 01:11:26,981
[dog barking]

1041
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:34,989
Well, hello everyone,
Faith Daniels here.

1042
01:11:35,021 --> 01:11:37,457
Well, as you can see,
today's a beautiful day

1043
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:40,028
to mark a new beginning
for our congregation.

1044
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,496
It is our final fundraiser.

1045
01:11:42,529 --> 01:11:45,599
And if all goes
according to plan,

1046
01:11:45,632 --> 01:11:47,969
we'll have nearly
reached our goals

1047
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:54,075
And well, we've been
through so, so much, and.

1048
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:00,748
Keep going, Faith,
[chattering]

1049
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,118
- you're doing fine.
- Okay, thank you, Louis.

1050
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,557
Follow me.
[tense music]

1051
01:12:12,426 --> 01:12:15,997
So, as I was saying,
we've been through so much

1052
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:19,533
in our congregation,
and it warms my heart

1053
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:21,069
to see everyone pull together

1054
01:12:21,101 --> 01:12:24,572
and helped save this beloved
little chapel of ours.

1055
01:12:26,439 --> 01:12:28,643
This place has a lot of history,

1056
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:32,747
and I'm really glad that
that we're able not only

1057
01:12:32,779 --> 01:12:37,786
to preserve it, but also
make it, make it stronger.

1058
01:12:39,185 --> 01:12:40,788
[Louis] We couldn't
have done it without you.

1059
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:50,531
Yeah, totally, we
wouldn't be here right now

1060
01:12:50,564 --> 01:12:53,869
if it wasn't for you, my turn.

1061
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:02,609
And let's not
forget, we also have

1062
01:13:02,643 --> 01:13:06,713
the hottest God fearing babe.

1063
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:10,784
- [Faith laughing]
- Now then, Devin.

1064
01:13:10,818 --> 01:13:12,854
Sorry, Faith, keep going.

1065
01:13:12,886 --> 01:13:14,788
It's okay, Louis,
why don't we check

1066
01:13:14,822 --> 01:13:16,157
in with Minister Malcom?

1067
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:24,832
No, that sounds really great.

1068
01:13:24,864 --> 01:13:29,570
Yeah, uh-huh, well,
well, thanks so much.

1069
01:13:33,474 --> 01:13:35,877
Okay then, real good.

1070
01:13:37,478 --> 01:13:40,815
Listen, thanks so much
for all your support.

1071
01:13:40,847 --> 01:13:43,518
No, really, it's a
real pleasant surprise.

1072
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:46,655
It's really gonna put Sunnyside
on much firmer ground.

1073
01:13:47,787 --> 01:13:52,493
Uh-huh, yup, okay,
[laughs] yeah.

1074
01:13:53,694 --> 01:13:55,263
All right, all right,
all right, yeah, sure.

1075
01:13:55,296 --> 01:13:59,801
Thanks, thanks again,
okay, okay, bye.

1076
01:14:02,203 --> 01:14:03,404
[phone beeping]

1077
01:14:03,436 --> 01:14:06,274
[Faith] So, what's
the pleasant surprise?

1078
01:14:06,306 --> 01:14:11,313
[laughs] Well, are you
ready for more good news?

1079
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:13,380
[Faith] Yeah, bring it on.

1080
01:14:13,413 --> 01:14:16,016
No, no, no, seriously,
like, are you ready?

1081
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:20,688
'Cause like really,
really, really ready?

1082
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,625
- [Faith] Yeah, I'm ready.
- Well I need you to be ready.

1083
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:27,762
- [Louis] We're ready.
- We're ready.

1084
01:14:27,795 --> 01:14:29,864
Okay, that was
an anonymous donor

1085
01:14:29,896 --> 01:14:33,934
I just got off the phone
with, a really generous one.

1086
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:37,005
And they read about the
terrible blasphemous vandalism

1087
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:38,772
that nearly destroyed us,

1088
01:14:38,805 --> 01:14:40,942
and they read about the fundraiser
efforts that you, Faith,

1089
01:14:40,975 --> 01:14:42,777
started to help keep us alive.

1090
01:14:44,744 --> 01:14:45,747
They wanna help.

1091
01:14:46,913 --> 01:14:49,617
[Faith] Whoa,
that's incredible.

1092
01:14:49,649 --> 01:14:52,686
We almost reached our goals,
so really every bit counts.

1093
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,622
- Yeah, yeah.
- [Faith] That's great.

1094
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:57,625
They wanna match our total.

1095
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,695
[Faith] What?
[Malcom laughing]

1096
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:03,264
Oh my God, Malcom,
that's incredible!

1097
01:15:03,296 --> 01:15:06,266
- Yeah [laughs].
- [Faith] That's wonderful.

1098
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,936
- What's going on?
- [Louis] An anonymous donor

1099
01:15:08,969 --> 01:15:13,841
came through, we're going to
exceed our fundraising goal.

1100
01:15:13,873 --> 01:15:18,880
- No way, fucking sweet!
- Ugh, it's sweet indeed,

1101
01:15:20,113 --> 01:15:21,782
Devin, come here, son.

1102
01:15:23,551 --> 01:15:26,287
All right, listen, I want
you to watch your language

1103
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:27,822
in our house of worship, okay?

1104
01:15:28,922 --> 01:15:31,792
Oh, and be nice Ms. Daniels.

1105
01:15:31,826 --> 01:15:33,528
You know how much
she means to me.

1106
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:38,198
Sorry, Faith.

1107
01:15:38,231 --> 01:15:40,902
[feet thumping]

1108
01:15:44,337 --> 01:15:46,974
So, Minister Malcom,

1109
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:49,609
care to recap today's
amazing events?

1110
01:15:49,643 --> 01:15:51,913
Yes, yes, yes, definitely.

1111
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:54,582
Well, to put it bluntly,
we really did bring it,

1112
01:15:54,614 --> 01:15:57,818
as the kids said, we
raised enough funds

1113
01:15:57,851 --> 01:16:01,922
to finish our repairs and to
add extra security cameras.

1114
01:16:01,956 --> 01:16:04,125
We're going to continue to
protect the congregation

1115
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,395
and ensure that this
never happens again.

1116
01:16:08,828 --> 01:16:11,731
Now, thanks in large part
to the amazing work done

1117
01:16:11,765 --> 01:16:14,735
by Faith Daniels, who helped
mobilize a ground swell

1118
01:16:14,768 --> 01:16:16,604
of support and awareness,
[dog barking]

1119
01:16:16,636 --> 01:16:19,306
we continue to receive
love from our Lord.

1120
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:24,377
Just when we thought things
couldn't get any better,

1121
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:29,417
we received an
anonymous call, who now,

1122
01:16:31,185 --> 01:16:33,187
stay with me on this,

1123
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:37,125
he promised that he's
going to match every dollar

1124
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:39,694
that we've raised already.
[man clapping]

1125
01:16:39,726 --> 01:16:42,529
We are truly, truly blessed.

1126
01:16:42,563 --> 01:16:44,532
[Faith] Amen to that.

1127
01:16:44,564 --> 01:16:47,601
Now, Malcom, if you could
please let the folks

1128
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:49,270
who couldn't be
here with us today,

1129
01:16:49,302 --> 01:16:54,309
know what this match actually
entails, that would be great.

1130
01:16:55,676 --> 01:16:58,212
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely,
this is the best part now.

1131
01:16:58,244 --> 01:16:59,646
Now to receive our donation,

1132
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:04,085
our donor has asked
us to participate

1133
01:17:04,118 --> 01:17:06,254
in a geo stash game.

1134
01:17:06,287 --> 01:17:07,488
Now, all right, all right,

1135
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,390
I know we're not the
most tech savvy bunch,

1136
01:17:10,423 --> 01:17:12,726
but I think this looks
like a lot of fun.

1137
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,229
Now, basically this is a...

1138
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:16,697
All right, Faith, help
me out here, what is it?

1139
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:17,864
[Faith] Scavenger hunt.

1140
01:17:17,898 --> 01:17:19,600
A scavenger
hunt, right, right.

1141
01:17:19,632 --> 01:17:24,639
But it's done with this little
app that it gives us clues

1142
01:17:25,805 --> 01:17:27,541
and it helps guide
us to our location.

1143
01:17:27,574 --> 01:17:32,246
Now, Faith here has decided
to be our geo stasher.

1144
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:35,850
- [Faith] Mm-hmm.
- She has to find five items

1145
01:17:35,882 --> 01:17:40,454
that are stashed nearby and
in fairly close locations.

1146
01:17:42,088 --> 01:17:44,125
- Are you ready, Faith?
- [Faith] I'm ready.

1147
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:46,227
Great, let's have a
little prayer, shall we?

1148
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,262
[Faith] Of course.

1149
01:17:50,663 --> 01:17:55,670
[camera rattling]
[woman coughing]

1150
01:18:04,944 --> 01:18:07,247
Conqueror of the
assailant of knowledge,

1151
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,082
You've changed the
universe forever.

1152
01:18:10,516 --> 01:18:13,987
And Your foot rests on his
back in endless victory.

1153
01:18:15,221 --> 01:18:17,791
Applause echoes
throughout the cosmos

1154
01:18:17,824 --> 01:18:19,493
in eternal celebration.

1155
01:18:21,694 --> 01:18:23,398
On the highest mountain top,

1156
01:18:25,064 --> 01:18:28,535
You reveal Your glory
to those who choose.

1157
01:18:29,837 --> 01:18:31,372
- Amen.
- Amen.

1158
01:18:33,673 --> 01:18:35,376
[vehicle droning]
[birds chirping]

1159
01:18:35,408 --> 01:18:37,110
[Louis] May the
Lord be with you.

1160
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:39,614
Thank you, Louis, may
the Lord be with you too.

1161
01:18:41,347 --> 01:18:44,618
[Congregation] Bye Faith,
good luck, see you soon.

1162
01:18:44,652 --> 01:18:46,520
Bye everybody, see you soon.

1163
01:18:50,356 --> 01:18:54,729

[phone beeping]

1166
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:16,149
And we're off.

1167
01:19:16,182 --> 01:19:20,854

[eerie music]
[feet thumping]

1173
01:20:04,264 --> 01:20:07,801
Stairway to heaven,
mm, where are you?

1174
01:20:13,806 --> 01:20:16,644
[leaves rustling]

1175
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,806
Oh, what, where?
[phone beeping]

1176
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:46,541
I don't get it.

1177
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:54,716
What, oh my God, really?

1178
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:57,284
[eerie music]

1179
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:10,731
All right, here we go.

1180
01:21:14,902 --> 01:21:19,907
[ladder rattling]
Oh God, I don't like heights.

1181
01:21:30,317 --> 01:21:34,421
Oh, there we go.
[crow cawing]

1182
01:21:34,454 --> 01:21:38,859
Come with me.
[ladder rattling]

1183
01:21:38,891 --> 01:21:41,496
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1184
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:51,139
And we're off.

1185
01:21:58,979 --> 01:22:02,182
[leaves rustling]
Okay.

1186
01:22:06,086 --> 01:22:07,221
Oh, all right.

1187
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:17,632
Let's see what we got here.

1188
01:22:19,832 --> 01:22:24,838
Oh, okay, that's
interesting, what is this?

1189
01:22:30,176 --> 01:22:32,145
One stash, four to go.

1190
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:41,622
[leaves crunching]
[placid music]

1191
01:22:51,965 --> 01:22:55,403
Oh, hold on, okay,
all right, here we go.

1192
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:09,717
[phone beeping]

1193
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:12,252
[Man] The test that
stumped them all.

1194
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:15,021
[leaves rustling]

1195
01:23:37,844 --> 01:23:40,847
[crickets chirping]

1196
01:23:41,782 --> 01:23:44,351
[Faith] Stumped, I should be.

1197
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:52,625
[leaves rustling]

1198
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:53,827
What was that?

1199
01:23:56,296 --> 01:24:01,302
[wind howling]
Okay [pants] okay.

1200
01:24:06,939 --> 01:24:10,176
This is starting to not be
fun anymore, here we go, okay.

1201
01:24:19,953 --> 01:24:21,989
What, but what the heck is this?

1202
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:24,759
[toads creaking]

1203
01:24:27,994 --> 01:24:29,162
Let's just go.

1204
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:37,704
[monkey howling]

1205
01:24:40,774 --> 01:24:45,780
Oh, oh, isn't this nice?
[eerie music]

1206
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,983
[baby laughing]

1207
01:24:51,385 --> 01:24:54,387
Oh my God, that was
so creepy, okay.

1208
01:24:58,057 --> 01:25:00,161
Geez, what happened here?

1209
01:25:05,097 --> 01:25:07,301
Kids, I guess, I don't know.

1210
01:25:14,841 --> 01:25:17,411
Okay, relax.
[phone buzzing]

1211
01:25:25,918 --> 01:25:26,819
[phone beeping]

1212
01:25:26,853 --> 01:25:28,188
Hey, where have you been?

1213
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,123
I tried calling and texting you.

1214
01:25:30,157 --> 01:25:33,092
I'm walking around these woods.

1215
01:25:33,126 --> 01:25:34,895
[Malcom] I'm so sorry, hon.

1216
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:37,030
I didn't see your
texts coming until now.

1217
01:25:38,864 --> 01:25:40,466
So, where are you?
[eerie music]

1218
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:44,304
[Faith] I don't know what,
I have no idea where I am,

1219
01:25:44,337 --> 01:25:46,874
and I think I'm about
to find a third stash,

1220
01:25:46,907 --> 01:25:51,779
but I gotta tell you, this is
officially not fun anymore.

1221
01:25:51,811 --> 01:25:54,448
[Malcom] Oh, cool,
you're on the third stash?

1222
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,516
She found the third
stash, everyone.

1223
01:25:58,051 --> 01:25:58,853
What is it?

1224
01:25:59,953 --> 01:26:04,325
Oh, I'm not sure,
hold on a sec.

1225
01:26:10,596 --> 01:26:11,532
[paper rustling]

1226
01:26:11,564 --> 01:26:13,199
Oh, this is classy.

1227
01:26:13,233 --> 01:26:16,137
Score Magazine, number
one in big boobs.

1228
01:26:23,944 --> 01:26:26,881
Okay, let me see,
oh, I don't know,

1229
01:26:29,082 --> 01:26:30,785
it looks like a
bowl of some sort.

1230
01:26:33,252 --> 01:26:35,755
- [Malcom] Perfect.
- Perfect?

1231
01:26:37,157 --> 01:26:39,927
I'm sorry, Malcom, I think
our friendly little benefactor

1232
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,662
might be just playing
a cool trick on us.

1233
01:26:41,694 --> 01:26:46,666
- [Malcom] Geez, you think?
- Yeah, I'm also cold

1234
01:26:46,699 --> 01:26:48,635
and kinda creeped out right now.

1235
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:51,137
Can you just come
and pick me up?

1236
01:26:51,171 --> 01:26:53,606
This is over, this is
not going anywhere.

1237
01:26:55,074 --> 01:26:58,244
- [Malcom] Geez, you think?
- I'm sure our little friend

1238
01:26:58,278 --> 01:27:00,914
won't mind.
[leaves rustling]

1239
01:27:00,947 --> 01:27:03,951
[demon mumbling]
Hello, hello?

1240
01:27:03,984 --> 01:27:06,487
[eerie music]
[phone beeping]

1241
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,688
Are you there?

1242
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:23,570
[owl hooting]
[leaves rustling]

1243
01:27:31,278 --> 01:27:33,380
[wind howling]
[crickets chirping]

1244
01:27:33,412 --> 01:27:36,916
Next clue, to rid
the world of evil,

1245
01:27:36,949 --> 01:27:41,121
you must get to
its root [pants].

1246
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:45,259
[eerie music]

1247
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:50,297
Wait a second, okay, okay,
okay, oh God, all right, relax.

1248
01:27:58,404 --> 01:28:00,340
Okay, it's nothing, oh.

1249
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,683
Okay, oh, come on,
come on, come on.

1250
01:28:17,056 --> 01:28:22,061
There it is.
[leaves rustling]

1251
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:30,271
Oh, I found it.

1252
01:28:32,037 --> 01:28:34,707
[feet thumping]

1253
01:28:41,247 --> 01:28:43,516
[camera rattling]
[terrifying music]

1254
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:48,556
Sweet Jesus, what was that?
[eerie music]

1255
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:49,824
Oh, Lord, oh.

1256
01:28:54,293 --> 01:28:55,895
[leaves rustling]

1257
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:58,065
What was I thinking in
agreeing to do this?

1258
01:28:59,698 --> 01:29:04,170
Oh, damn.
[twigs snapping]

1259
01:29:04,203 --> 01:29:08,474
Oh, my God [pants]
I'm outta here.

1260
01:29:12,779 --> 01:29:16,583
[crickets chirping]
[eerie music]

1261
01:29:16,615 --> 01:29:17,952
Whoa, hey there.

1262
01:29:22,689 --> 01:29:24,992
You should watch where
you're walking, Mister.

1263
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:28,061
Ugh, what is that?

1264
01:29:33,233 --> 01:29:34,235
Ugh, oh, ew.

1265
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:38,739
It's just a stupid scarecrow.

1266
01:29:40,306 --> 01:29:45,311
Oh, what?
[baby crying]

1267
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:50,283
I don't know what that is,
but I'm sick of it, okay.

1268
01:29:55,154 --> 01:29:58,057
[leaves crunching]

1269
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,606
[stroller rattling]
[baby googling]

1270
01:30:19,779 --> 01:30:22,616
Nice night for a walk, isn't it?

1271
01:30:23,984 --> 01:30:27,921
Nice, yeah, very nice.

1272
01:30:27,953 --> 01:30:29,622
Probably the best
day of my life.

1273
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:38,865
All right.

1274
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:53,612
[eerie music]
[birds chirping]

1275
01:30:53,645 --> 01:30:58,618
[pages rustling]
[phone buzzing]

1276
01:31:08,261 --> 01:31:11,531
Finally, you better
be close, Mister.

1277
01:31:11,564 --> 01:31:13,467
[Malcom] That I am,
I think only 15 minutes

1278
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,768
if the navigation is right.

1279
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:16,636
Sorry, we got cut off before.

1280
01:31:16,668 --> 01:31:18,005
I've got some nice
hot chocolate,

1281
01:31:18,037 --> 01:31:19,772
a few other treats left
over from the bake sale

1282
01:31:19,805 --> 01:31:21,641
for my brave little
scavenger hunter.

1283
01:31:22,742 --> 01:31:23,944
Oh, that's very sweet,

1284
01:31:23,976 --> 01:31:25,545
but won't be enough
to make me forget

1285
01:31:25,578 --> 01:31:28,215
about this freaky night.
[upbeat music]

1286
01:31:28,247 --> 01:31:31,283
None of these clues
make any sense, Malcom.

1287
01:31:31,317 --> 01:31:35,421
[Malcom] Duly noted, no
more geo stashing in the dark.

1288
01:31:35,454 --> 01:31:36,657
How many did you find?

1289
01:31:38,358 --> 01:31:39,726
Four.

1290
01:31:39,759 --> 01:31:42,229
[Malcom] Ah, so close, well,

1291
01:31:42,261 --> 01:31:44,597
you really did give
it your best shot.

1292
01:31:44,631 --> 01:31:46,300
You were such a great sport.

1293
01:31:47,934 --> 01:31:50,637
What do you mean,
this isn't a prank?

1294
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:52,338
We're not getting the donation?

1295
01:31:52,372 --> 01:31:55,876
[Malcom] Not unless we find
all the stashes, I'm afraid.

1296
01:31:55,908 --> 01:31:58,577
But like I said, A
for effort, my dear.

1297
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:00,947
Yeah, how about L for loser?

1298
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:04,317
God, Malcom, this was
such a waste of time.

1299
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:06,787
I don't wanna let
everybody down.

1300
01:32:06,819 --> 01:32:08,587
Sunnyside really needs
that extra money,

1301
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:10,123
and you know it.
[leaves rustling]

1302
01:32:10,155 --> 01:32:12,926
[Malcom] Hogwash, Faith
Daniels, you did great.

1303
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:16,496
We'll always be proud of you
for the sacrifice you made.

1304
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:19,466
Well, I guess, whatever.

1305
01:32:19,498 --> 01:32:22,635
[Malcom] Be there in two
shakes of a lamb's tail.

1306
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:25,506
Bye [sighs].
[phone beeping]

1307
01:32:42,454 --> 01:32:43,791
Let's do this.

1308
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:54,735
[camera rattling]
[leaves rustling]

1309
01:32:56,869 --> 01:33:01,207
Find hope between a
rock and a hard place.

1310
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:07,247
I need some hope.
[eerie music]

1311
01:33:08,247 --> 01:33:09,048
There you are.

1312
01:33:15,354 --> 01:33:16,189
Got this.

1313
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:22,696
[leaves rustling]

1314
01:33:23,863 --> 01:33:27,767
If you dig one ditch,
then better dig two,

1315
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,505
'cause the trap you set
just might be for you.

1316
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:41,347
Okay, let's see.

1317
01:33:42,814 --> 01:33:47,820
[lid exploding]
[Faith coughing]

1318
01:33:48,121 --> 01:33:48,956
What?

1319
01:33:52,859 --> 01:33:55,028
What, who are you?

1320
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:59,332
Go, stay away from
me, [coughs] go, what?

1321
01:34:01,367 --> 01:34:06,373
Go away [coughs] stay
away from me, no.

1322
01:34:07,105 --> 01:34:08,007
What do you want?

1323
01:34:08,041 --> 01:34:11,845
No [coughs] no, no, get away.

1324
01:34:14,546 --> 01:34:19,552
[placid music]
[wheelchair rattling]

1325
01:34:24,122 --> 01:34:27,193
[TV monitor buzzing]

1326
01:34:48,581 --> 01:34:53,587
[eerie music]
[devil worshipers chanting]

1327
01:35:16,908 --> 01:35:19,746
Welcome to the party, Faith,
so glad you could join us.

1328
01:35:21,213 --> 01:35:24,551
[Faith] Malcom,
what is this, what?

1329
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,287
Shh, shh, shh.

1330
01:35:30,122 --> 01:35:34,893
What are you doing?

1331
01:35:34,926 --> 01:35:36,697
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1332
01:35:38,363 --> 01:35:43,369
[Faith] What, Malcom,
what are you doing [pants]?

1333
01:35:55,014 --> 01:35:57,449
Thank you for the
offerings, Faith.

1334
01:35:57,483 --> 01:36:01,688
You did well, I'm sure
he will be most pleased.

1335
01:36:02,954 --> 01:36:07,961
Louis, Malcom, is this a joke?

1336
01:36:09,095 --> 01:36:10,797
- Oh, Faith, shh.
- I'm not comfortable.

1337
01:36:10,829 --> 01:36:14,533
My dear, sweet
Faith, this is no joke.

1338
01:36:15,702 --> 01:36:17,237
You are the sixth stash.

1339
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:21,207
[eerie music]
[Faith panting]

1340
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:22,708
Hail, Satan.

1341
01:36:22,742 --> 01:36:24,644
[Devil Worshipers]
Hail, Lucifer.

1342
01:36:24,676 --> 01:36:28,314
What, what, what are
you doing, let me go?

1343
01:36:28,347 --> 01:36:33,353
[Malcom] Shh.
[Faith gasping]

1344
01:36:34,087 --> 01:36:36,323
[Faith screaming]

1345
01:36:43,628 --> 01:36:48,635
[hammer thumping]
[placid music]

1346
01:36:50,837 --> 01:36:54,641
[Faith] What, stop [cries].

1347
01:36:57,777 --> 01:37:02,247
[hammer thumping]
Stop, stop, please, stop.

1348
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,850
[Faith crying]

1349
01:37:11,923 --> 01:37:14,694
[hammer thumping]

1350
01:37:30,976 --> 01:37:31,811
Why?

1351
01:37:41,921 --> 01:37:46,326
All offerings accounted for,
let the ceremony continue.

1352
01:37:56,034 --> 01:38:01,041
[Faith gasping]
[Faith crying]

1353
01:38:04,976 --> 01:38:07,713
[fire crackling]

1354
01:38:19,992 --> 01:38:24,998
[Faith] No [cries].
[feet thumping]

1355
01:38:28,634 --> 01:38:33,140
No [cries] [coughs].

1356
01:38:36,341 --> 01:38:38,811
[Malcom] Thank
you, Mia, my dear.

1357
01:38:38,845 --> 01:38:41,847
Anything for you,
Minister Malcom.

1358
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:56,695
[Faith] What [cries]?
[Malcolm and Mia kissing]

1359
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:08,341
[feet thumping]

1360
01:39:16,314 --> 01:39:17,649
What are you doing?

1361
01:39:17,682 --> 01:39:22,689
No [screams] [cries]!
[flesh tearing]

1362
01:39:39,238 --> 01:39:42,008
[Malcom sipping]

1363
01:39:50,983 --> 01:39:52,252
Do I have to?

1364
01:39:58,524 --> 01:40:01,261
[Devin coughing]

1365
01:40:08,266 --> 01:40:12,005
He also would drink of the
wine of the wrath of God,

1366
01:40:12,037 --> 01:40:16,509
which is mixed in full strength
in the cup of his anger.

1367
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:20,180
[Faith gasping]

1368
01:40:23,349 --> 01:40:25,051
[Malcom and Devin speaks
in foreign language]

1369
01:40:25,083 --> 01:40:27,319
[Faith crying]

1370
01:40:27,353 --> 01:40:28,521
That's my boy.

1371
01:40:35,161 --> 01:40:37,829
Conqueror of the
assailant of knowledge,

1372
01:40:37,863 --> 01:40:39,798
you've changed the
universe forever,

1373
01:40:40,966 --> 01:40:43,335
and your foot rests
on Jehovah's back

1374
01:40:43,368 --> 01:40:45,304
[placid music]
in endless victory.

1375
01:40:46,404 --> 01:40:48,807
Applause echoes
throughout the cosmos,

1376
01:40:50,275 --> 01:40:55,180
in eternal celebration on
the highest mountain top,

1377
01:40:56,381 --> 01:40:59,351
you reveal your glory
to those who choose.

1378
01:40:59,385 --> 01:41:03,523
- [eerie music]
- [Faith] What's that?

1379
01:41:04,856 --> 01:41:07,760
[Satan growling]

1380
01:41:07,792 --> 01:41:09,662
My Lord, is that you?

1381
01:41:11,764 --> 01:41:16,670
Have you come for us, my Lord?

1382
01:41:18,104 --> 01:41:19,940
What's this, what's this
horrible smell [gasps]?

1383
01:41:22,675 --> 01:41:25,378
Malcom, don't do
that, don't do that.

1384
01:41:25,411 --> 01:41:29,248
Don't do that, Malcom.
[Satan growling]

1385
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,583
[Malcom screaming]
[blood splattering]

1386
01:41:31,617 --> 01:41:33,653
[Faith gasping]
[arm thumping]

1387
01:41:33,685 --> 01:41:38,657
[Louis] Holy shit, oh
my God, oh, oh [screams]!

1388
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:42,161
[Devin thumping]

1389
01:41:42,194 --> 01:41:44,430
[Satan growling]

1390
01:41:44,462 --> 01:41:48,233
[devil worshipers screaming]

1391
01:41:50,735 --> 01:41:55,742
[hooves thumping]
[Faith screaming]

1392
01:42:24,904 --> 01:42:27,607
[door rattling]

1393
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:29,909
Mount Olive, Mount Olive?

1394
01:42:37,582 --> 01:42:40,652
Yeah, Dale, listen, it's Frank.

1395
01:42:40,685 --> 01:42:42,421
I just watched a
video I think was shot

1396
01:42:42,454 --> 01:42:43,689
in your neck of the woods.

1397
01:42:43,722 --> 01:42:45,658
It's a church right
outside Mount Olive.

1398
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:47,426
Do you know the one
I'm talking about?

1399
01:42:48,293 --> 01:42:49,962
Right, just off the interstate.

1400
01:42:51,229 --> 01:42:53,131
Your guys were just there?

1401
01:42:53,164 --> 01:42:55,001
I'll be damned, when
did that happen?

1402
01:42:57,103 --> 01:42:59,971
Well, the video shows
Satanists sacrificing a woman,

1403
01:43:00,005 --> 01:43:00,974
for Christ's sake.

1404
01:43:03,442 --> 01:43:05,478
You're telling me that
actually happened?

1405
01:43:06,412 --> 01:43:07,947
Jesus, that's unbelievable.

1406
01:43:09,547 --> 01:43:12,152
Yeah, we'll get a copy of
the video right out to you.

1407
01:43:13,586 --> 01:43:16,489
Yeah, no shit, Dale, that's
one for the books, thanks.

1408
01:43:16,521 --> 01:43:21,528
[eerie music]
[door rattling]

1409
01:43:25,898 --> 01:43:29,903
There's a whole lot going
on out at Mount Olive.

1410
01:43:33,104 --> 01:43:35,707
What else do you know
about that church?

1411
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:37,577
A lot more than
what's on that video.

1412
01:43:38,409 --> 01:43:39,845
[Frank] Well, it burned
to the ground last night.

1413
01:43:39,878 --> 01:43:41,314
[door rattling]

1414
01:43:41,346 --> 01:43:42,514
[Detective Hannigan]
Dispatch received a call

1415
01:43:42,547 --> 01:43:43,983
from a woman saying
she found the ambulance

1416
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:45,384
out on Orange Brook Drive.

1417
01:43:48,487 --> 01:43:49,456
Is everything okay?

1418
01:43:51,256 --> 01:43:53,025
[Frank] It's
gotta be the drives.

1419
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,095
It's gotta be the drive.

1420
01:43:56,127 --> 01:43:57,362
I don't know how,

1421
01:43:57,395 --> 01:43:59,631
but somehow Schneider
put something in them.

1422
01:44:05,404 --> 01:44:08,441
Damned, busting me for
smiling on a cloudy day.

1423
01:44:08,474 --> 01:44:09,842
Am I under arrest here or what?

1424
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:11,344
[Police Officer]
Hey, you have a seat.

1425
01:44:11,377 --> 01:44:12,845
Yeah, you haven't even
read me my fucking rights.

1426
01:44:12,877 --> 01:44:14,579
[Police Officer]
Go take a seat.

1427
01:44:14,613 --> 01:44:16,082
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1428
01:44:16,114 --> 01:44:17,716
[Police Officer] Did you
hear me, go take a seat?

1429
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,586
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

1430
01:44:23,255 --> 01:44:25,091
That's some nice
stuff you've got.

1431
01:44:25,123 --> 01:44:26,925
[chattering]
I'd love to try it on.

1432
01:44:28,527 --> 01:44:32,832
Please, you wanna
cuff me, officer?

1433
01:44:32,864 --> 01:44:34,867
Yes, you'd probably
enjoy it too much.

1434
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:37,369
Would you take a seat, please?

1435
01:44:39,838 --> 01:44:43,009
Seriously dude, time is
money and the rent is due.

1436
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:44,978
And I'll tell you
when you can leave.

1437
01:44:46,612 --> 01:44:49,282
[phone ringing]

1438
01:45:02,461 --> 01:45:04,463
What's the story
with these guys?

1439
01:45:05,997 --> 01:45:08,333
We found them standing in
the middle of the street,

1440
01:45:08,367 --> 01:45:09,936
right outside the precinct.

1441
01:45:09,969 --> 01:45:11,971
Yeah, one of 'em
had ID, so we ran it.

1442
01:45:12,003 --> 01:45:15,173
It turns out these three
went missing three hours away

1443
01:45:15,207 --> 01:45:16,576
in Jersey last week.

1444
01:45:16,609 --> 01:45:18,077
What are they doing here?

1445
01:45:18,109 --> 01:45:20,179
Hey, your guess
is as good as ours.

1446
01:45:21,447 --> 01:45:23,048
It killed my dad.

1447
01:45:24,649 --> 01:45:25,984
What's he saying?

1448
01:45:26,018 --> 01:45:27,653
[Louis] It's in the church.

1449
01:45:27,685 --> 01:45:28,987
It's in the church.

1450
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:31,289
Look Sarge, there's
been some crazy shit

1451
01:45:31,323 --> 01:45:32,458
going on out there.

1452
01:45:32,490 --> 01:45:34,092
You have someone
coming down from Jersey

1453
01:45:34,126 --> 01:45:35,828
to pick these guys up.

1454
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:38,698
[Police Officer] That's the
best news I heard all night.

1455
01:45:38,730 --> 01:45:42,400
You need to send
someone to the church.

1456
01:45:42,434 --> 01:45:44,003
[Police Officer]
We're working on it.

1457
01:45:44,036 --> 01:45:45,503
Sergeant Biehn, do me a favor

1458
01:45:45,537 --> 01:45:46,939
and give these guys
a seat, all right?

1459
01:45:46,971 --> 01:45:49,442
Over to your
left, to your left.

1460
01:45:59,618 --> 01:46:00,854
Is everything okay?

1461
01:46:04,789 --> 01:46:06,859
I need to see Ansel Schneider.

1462
01:46:06,891 --> 01:46:08,327
[Police Officer] He's
not here right now.

1463
01:46:09,461 --> 01:46:10,829
It's important.
[eerie music]

1464
01:46:10,863 --> 01:46:13,132
There's nothing I
can do about that.

1465
01:46:13,164 --> 01:46:14,266
Come on, I can help you out.

1466
01:46:26,377 --> 01:46:29,881
[keyboard rattling]

1467
01:46:29,914 --> 01:46:31,884
Garcia, get the generators on.

1468
01:46:31,917 --> 01:46:32,752
Yes, sir.

1469
01:46:38,524 --> 01:46:43,529
- [police officer gurgling]
- Oh my God [screams].

1470
01:46:44,896 --> 01:46:47,934
[Man] Fuck, shit, holy fuck!

1471
01:46:47,966 --> 01:46:49,969
Do I need a bust out
of the station now?

1472
01:46:50,002 --> 01:46:52,305
What the hell,
what's going here?

1473
01:46:52,337 --> 01:46:54,306
He said something on the
flash drives caused this.

1474
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:56,242
- What?
- I don't know.

1475
01:46:56,274 --> 01:46:57,509
[gun shooting]

1476
01:46:57,542 --> 01:46:58,944
Where's that coming from?

1477
01:46:58,978 --> 01:47:00,613
[Sergeant Biehn] Sounds
like the front desk.

1478
01:47:00,645 --> 01:47:02,113
[Detective Hannigan]
Who's down there?

1479
01:47:02,146 --> 01:47:04,684
[Sergeant Biehn] I
don't know, Howard?

1480
01:47:04,716 --> 01:47:05,518
Get Armitage to the ambulance.

1481
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:07,853
[woman screaming]

1482
01:47:07,886 --> 01:47:10,389
[Man] Stop [grunts] please!

1483
01:47:10,421 --> 01:47:13,326
We have to help him.
[Frank grunting]

1484
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:15,528
I'll handle the suspect.

1485
01:47:19,331 --> 01:47:20,699
[door slamming]

1486
01:47:20,733 --> 01:47:22,268

[Captain Friedkin knocking]

1488
01:47:25,037 --> 01:47:25,872
Stop!

1489
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:29,908
[Captain Friedkin] The
whole precinct's under attack!

1490
01:47:29,942 --> 01:47:32,110
Whatever you do,
don't go near it!

1491
01:47:32,144 --> 01:47:37,150
[Captain Friedkin gurgling]
[blood splattering]

1492
01:47:38,149 --> 01:47:38,984
Shit.

1493
01:47:44,722 --> 01:47:49,729
[feet stomping]
[gun shooting]

1494
01:47:50,328 --> 01:47:51,130
Vala, stop!

1495
01:47:55,266 --> 01:47:57,635
You used me, but
this has to end.

1496
01:47:57,668 --> 01:48:01,373
[flash drives rattling]

1497
01:48:01,407 --> 01:48:03,775
It's already spreading.

1498
01:48:03,809 --> 01:48:06,679
The audience was the
target all along.

1499
01:48:06,712 --> 01:48:08,981
And you lead them to me.

1500
01:48:09,014 --> 01:48:11,317
This isn't a fucking movie.
[flashes rattling]

1501
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:14,487
You don't have to
believe, see for yourself.

1502
01:48:21,627 --> 01:48:26,365
They're watching
this now [laughs].
