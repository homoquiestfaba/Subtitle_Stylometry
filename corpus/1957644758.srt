1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:02,369
[girl laughing]

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,072
Blah!

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,408
[girl shrieks]

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,610
[both laughing]

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,586
[laughing, shrieking]

6
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,572
[girl] Teddy says
come and play hide-and-seek.

7
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,508
I'm fine here.

8
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,611
Are you ready?

9
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,319
And your letter?

10
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,562
"Dear Daddy, come home soon.

11
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,330
Love, Perdita."

12
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,605
Come on, Perdita.

13
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,544
Can't really come home,
can he, Mummy?

14
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,713
No. But he'd like to know
he's not forgotten.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,286
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's leave Mummy in peace.

16
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,530
Take care of her, Annie.

17
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,668
OK, let's see
if you can catch me!

18
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,236
Whoo-hoo!

19
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,645
-You're looking!
-I'm not.

20
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,381
Yeah, no peeping!

21
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,385
1, 2, 3, 4...

22
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,156
5, 6, 7...

23
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,228
Mummy?

24
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,404
Auntie Annie!

25
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,672
Come quick!

26
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,441
Something bad!

27
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,512
[screams]

28
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,679
What?!

29
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,749
-[Perdita] Mummy!
-[Annie] Perdita, wait!

30
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,484
Mummy!

31
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,625
Mummy!

32
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,529
Zelda!

33
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,698
Mummy!

34
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,536
Mummy!

35
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,773
Mummy!

36
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,459
[gulls screeching]

37
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,462
I've always lived on Skua,

38
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,497
a tiny island off the coast
of Scotland.

39
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,799
I used to think it was
the best place in the world.

40
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,868
But that all changed
a year ago.

41
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,503
After Daddy was killed at sea,

42
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,839
Mummy just couldn't live
without him.

43
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,409
Aunt Annie looked after me,
but everyone else hated her.

44
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,411
They said Mummy
had poisoned the sea

45
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,079
and killed off
all the lobsters,

46
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,814
so they couldn't fish anymore.

47
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,751
They even called me
"the witch's daughter."

48
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,719
Then one day I found something

49
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,622
that was going
to change my life forever.

50
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,119
[kids jeering]

51
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,355
Leave me alone!

52
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,560
-Let me see!
-It's mine! I found it!

53
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,529
My dad says
the island's finished

54
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,897
and it's all your fault!

55
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,866
He says witches used to be
burnt at the stake!

56
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,469
What about it,
shall we burn her?!

57
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,741
Well, I don't care
if she found the Mona Lisa.

58
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,609
The girl is a menace.

59
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,579
I'm telling you that girl
is a curse on this island.

60
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,148
It's a year since her mother
took her own life

61
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,750
and poisoned ours.

62
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,752
A year since I caught
my last lobster.

63
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,421
If I had my way,
she'd be packing her bags today.

64
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,756
She's just a child.

65
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,926
Aye, a witch's child.

66
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Second sight is a gift,
not a curse.

67
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,597
[man] It's not her fault,
Annie,

68
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,466
but you can't argue with facts.

69
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,434
What facts?
That a harmless young girl

70
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,802
puts a curse on the sea,

71
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,437
scares away
every living creature?

72
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,439
-It's the truth.
-[man] Aye, that's right.

73
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,475
Oh, and nothing to do
with the tanker

74
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,777
and the 30,000 gallons
of crude oil she spilled.

75
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,780
No lobsters means
no income for the island

76
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,483
and precious few visitors
for my hotel.

77
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,651
Our men can't
feed their families.

78
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,954
And that's all
Perdita's fault, is it?

79
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,524
-Do you really all believe that?
-[murmurs of agreement]

80
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,560
I believe your sister
put a curse on the sea

81
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,496
that took
her husband's life, yes.

82
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,965
And I believe you are
a superstitious fool.

83
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,504
[man] Annie, what it
boils down to is this.

84
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,672
Most of us on this council
believe you and the girl

85
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,974
would be better off
somewhere else.

86
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,644
It's nice of you
to be so concerned.

87
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,747
How many of you want us to go?

88
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,751
[crowd] Aye! Hear, hear! Aye!

89
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,953
I see. It's good to know
who your friends are.

90
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,523
-So you'll go?
-No, Jock.

91
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,626
This is my home.
Perdita's too. We're family.

92
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,562
I suppose he's part
of the family, too.

93
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,832
Mr Smith is my lodger,
no more or less.

94
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,834
[dog barking]

95
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,237
Could have said something.

96
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,506
They wouldn't listen
to a stranger.

97
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,017
Witch.

98
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,629
[goat bleats]

99
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,931
[dog barks]

100
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,280
[woman] We've come all this way
and you're not even sure.

101
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,984
Look, Helen, the ship went down
very close to this island.

102
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,019
All the paintings were recovered
except one.

103
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,622
Now, if I'm right
and this is the Salignac...

104
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,057
Then it could be worth
a fortune?

105
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,758
If it's genuine.

106
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,094
-Can I have a look?
-What's the magic word?

107
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,629
-[ship horn blows]
-Please?

108
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,664
Oh, look, we're nearly at Skua.

109
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,906
Some good places to explore
by the look of it.

110
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,107
Wave.

111
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,947
-[dog yips]
-[boy] Uh, excuse me.

112
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,618
Oh, sorry.

113
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,159
-Come along, slow coach.
-I'm coming.

114
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,568
[goat bleats]

115
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,710
Here on holiday, mister...?

116
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,347
Uh, Jones.
I'm here for the golf.

117
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,683
You've only recently
started playing.

118
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,118
You're staying
at the Lobster Pot Hotel

119
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,853
and you're trying
to quit smoking.

120
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,688
Huh. How do you know all that?

121
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,724
Well, one, your golf clubs.
Brand new.

122
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,859
Two, your luggage label.

123
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,128
And three, your things are
all yellow from nicotine.

124
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,096
Obviously, trying to wean
yourself off cigarettes

125
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,865
onto the occasional cigar.

126
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,768
Your son is quite the detective.

127
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,636
He's not my dad.

128
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,938
[man clears throat]

129
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,774
I'm Tim's stepfather,
Larry Hoggart.

130
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,108
This is my wife Helen.

131
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,677
-Charmed.
-Hello.

132
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,680
Don't mind him.
He thinks he's Sherlock Holmes.

133
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,083
[horn honks]

134
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,751
Clearly.

135
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,620
[car engine idling]

136
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,857
[car door shuts]

137
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,393
Mr and Mrs Hoggart?
How do you do?

138
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,962
-Hello.
-Mr Jones.

139
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,063
Ah, charmed.

140
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,865
Jock and Betty Tarbutt
from the Lobster Pot Hotel.

141
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,067
So glad you could come.

142
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,769
It's not every day someone finds
what might turn out to be

143
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,171
a masterpiece washed up
on the beach.

144
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,911
Stop, thief!

145
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,716
Leave me alone!

146
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,784
If you're gonna steal,
you picked the wrong person.

147
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,787
-[Helen] Tim!
-This one's yours!

148
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,094
Witch, witch, witch, witch,
witch, witch, witch, witch...

149
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,130
It's her library books.
She's a bookaholic.

150
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:34,166
The ferry sends at least
half a dozen twice a week.

151
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,901
You'll have to excuse Tim.

152
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,971
He made a citizen's arrest
on a shoplifter last week.

153
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,040
Turned out to be
the store detective.

154
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,842
Well, he looked
suspicious to me.

155
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,944
I think you owe someone
an apology, Tim.

156
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,880
There's no need to apologize
to her kind.

157
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,783
-On your way, witch!
-[Tim] Why'd you call her that?

158
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,453
-Because that's what she is.
-Don't start all that nonsense.

159
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,822
The poor girl's father
was lost at sea.

160
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,192
And then her mother, Zelda,
took her own life

161
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,194
about a year later.

162
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,798
They called her a witch,
but she was just different.

163
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,200
Next you'll be saying she
doesn't have the second sight.

164
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,869
Second sight?

165
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,238
Seeing things,
before they actually happen.

166
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,107
You know, in your mind's eye.
Premonitions.

167
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,077
I don't believe in witches
and spirits or ghosts.

168
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,046
There's a perfectly logical
explanation for everything.

169
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,747
Let's wait and see how you feel

170
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,182
after you've been here
a couple of days.

171
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,152
[Betty] Right. Let's get you
all settled in at the hotel.

172
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,721
Then you can come and see
the painting, Mr Hoggart.

173
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,304
[Perdita] "When shall we three
meet again?

174
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,873
In thunder, lightning,
or in rain?"

175
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,077
And the second witch says,
"When the hurly-burly's done,

176
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,012
when the battle's lost
and won."

177
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,982
Says the third witch,
"That will be ere set of sun."

178
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,086
and then the first witch says,
"Where the place?"

179
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,288
Second witch: "Upon the heath."

180
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,323
The third witch:
"There to meet with--"

181
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,292
[horn honks]

182
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:14,567
Annie, it's Mr Hoggart,
about the painting.

183
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,303
Hello, welcome to Skua.
Come in and have a look.

184
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,004
[man] Hmm-mm.

185
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,374
On second thoughts, I'll just
go and fetch it for you.

186
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,315
That's Birdy Smith.
He's quite famous, actually.

187
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,017
He writes books about birds.

188
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,086
He's been here
for nearly a year,

189
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,555
and he's hardly said a word
to anyone.

190
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,259
Mr Smith, can I not tempt you
down to the hotel for a meal?

191
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,594
No, thanks.

192
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,163
I've no lobster,
but I do a fine haggis.

193
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,032
What exactly is haggis?

194
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,568
Well, you take sheep's heart,

195
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,004
lungs, liver, touch of suet,

196
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,973
touch of oatmeal,
and Bob's your uncle.

197
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,941
I think I'll pass, thank you.

198
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,846
[sighs]

199
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,049
Thank you. I'll look at it as
soon as I get back to the hotel.

200
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,952
-Take care of it. Bye, now.
-[Helen] Bye.

201
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,129
[car starts]

202
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,331
It's downright rude
not to invite them in.

203
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,067
They've had a full day's travel,
hours on the ferry.

204
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,937
I came here for privacy
and peace and quiet.

205
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,639
We made a deal.

206
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,207
And I've kept to it.

207
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,911
But how do you expect us
to lead an ordinary life

208
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,948
when you go creeping around
like some sly old tomcat?

209
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,050
I just keep myself to myself.

210
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,653
You've spoken
to no one since you came.

211
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:44,223
It's for the best.
Trust me.

212
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:48,427
My sister said, never trust
a man who keeps secrets.

213
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,097
Perdita, your lunch is ready.

214
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,332
What's for lunch?

215
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,035
Brains and kidney pie.

216
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,937
Ah, great.

217
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,141
Brains and kidney pie.
Must be Tuesday.

218
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,924
[Jock] I'm sorry, sir, there's
no golf course on the island.

219
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,459
-There never has been.
-You're not serious.

220
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,995
-Do you know how much this cost?
-Hello there.

221
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,397
Have you got somewhere
I can park it?

222
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,233
I knew there was something odd
about him.

223
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,335
Why bring golf clubs
to a place with no golf course?

224
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,403
Maybe he's on his way
to another island.

225
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,672
[Larry] Maybe Tim should mind
his own business.

226
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,075
[Tim] He definitely said,
"I'm here for the golf."

227
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:40,412
Listen, Super-Sleuth, why don't
you just be an ordinary kid

228
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,381
for a few days, OK?

229
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,183
Absolutely

230
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,920
Good chap.

231
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,222
Not!

232
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,497
[sighs]
I thought we had a deal.

233
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,066
Don't blame it on me, it's him.

234
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,435
"Maybe Tim should mind
his own business."

235
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,404
"What's the magic word?"

236
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,339
He treats me like a 5-year.old.

237
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,142
Well, he means well.
And he's very fond of you.

238
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,744
Yeah, like I'm fond of cabbage.

239
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,549
Oh, Tim, I miss him too,
you know.

240
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:56,388
But it's been four years
and life has to go on, hmm?

241
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,226
I'm going to have a bath.

242
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,529
How about you make a start
on that school project, huh?

243
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,564
[sighs] Yeah, see you later.

244
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,376
Summer holiday, day one.

245
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,378
Larry, a pain, as usual.

246
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,582
Met a so.called
"witch's daughter"...

247
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,086
who seems to be following me.

248
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,522
Weird place, weird people.

249
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,424
Especially Mr Jones.

250
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,294
Definitely more to him
than meets the eye.

251
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,141
Is it by somebody famous?

252
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,275
I'm pretty sure

253
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,510
it's a Claude Salignac,

254
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,345
one of the minor Impressionists.

255
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,280
[Helen] He was a student
of Renoir.

256
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,150
Talented, but never
a star in his own right.

257
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,152
[Betty] I didn't know you were
an expert too.

258
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,854
[Helen] Yes, we both work
at the museum.

259
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:05,157
The painting was en route to
London when the ship went down.

260
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,259
Hello, campers.

261
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:11,230
So, is it the real McCoy?

262
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,499
[Larry] Can't be certain
till I've cleaned it up,

263
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,833
but it looks promising.

264
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,435
Can I go and explore?

265
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,137
You be careful, young man.

266
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,539
The tides come in very fast
this time of year.

267
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:24,209
[Larry] And do try not
to arrest anyone.

268
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,577
That's a good chap.

269
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,143
I normally charge for being

270
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,645
a flaming tourist attraction.

271
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,448
Uh, it's my hobby.
Do you mind?

272
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:07,286
I suppose not.
There's some who would, though.

273
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,521
Gonna take me round
to Carlin's Cave, Will?

274
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,893
What is it this time:
puffins, gannets?

275
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,262
Got my eye on a pair
of peregrine falcons.

276
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,397
How's the fishing?

277
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,635
Your money buys my time,
Mr Smith, not my conversation.

278
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,303
-Hi.
-Hi.

279
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,275
I want to say I'm sorry about
the mix-up with the bags.

280
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,978
People say you've got
second sight.

281
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,646
It's not true, is it?

282
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,981
Witch's secret.

283
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,516
There's no such thing
as witches.

284
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,584
-There is so.
-OK, prove it.

285
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,387
-Turn me into a frog.
-That's not quite how it works.

286
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,757
I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

287
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,594
Even if they've got toffees?

288
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,435
I'm sorry about your mother.
And your father.

289
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,237
My dad died too.

290
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,580
Tim, if I show you
my secret hiding place,

291
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,416
you promise you'll
never, never, never tell?

292
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,451
Never, never, never.

293
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,719
Come on.

294
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,573
[Perdita] This is my library.

295
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:11,009
Sometimes, when
the others are at school,

296
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,312
I come here and read for hours.

297
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,748
-You don't go to school?
-I'm not allowed.

298
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,318
Tim. [sighs]

299
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,687
The others won't sit
in class with me,

300
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,623
so the Island Council
turns a blind eye.

301
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,626
Wow. Lucky.

302
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,595
It's not lucky.

303
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,363
I want to go.

304
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,033
I want to learn,
I want to make friends,

305
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,703
but they won't let me.

306
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,306
Mr Smith says it's just as well.

307
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,642
He says mixing with others
might take away my powers.

308
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,877
Oh, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

309
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,317
Tim.
What happened to your father?

310
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,455
He was a policeman,

311
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,590
chasing a stolen car.

312
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,492
There was a crash.

313
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,494
[Perdita] I'm sorry.

314
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,598
Do you want to see
something else?

315
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,467
Yeah, sure.

316
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,311
Wow!

317
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,483
Where does it lead to?

318
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,817
A smuggler's cave.

319
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,853
[metallic rattling]

320
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,431
-Are you sure this is safe?
-Yes, but be careful.

321
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,866
It's a bit wobbly.

322
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,782
[water dripping]

323
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,520
[Tim] How did you find this?

324
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,455
[Perdita] I've been coming here
since I was three.

325
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,723
My dad showed me.

326
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:09,828
It fills up at high tide, but
it's OK, that's not for ages.

327
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,944
-[Tim] It's very big.
-[Perdita] Yeah.

328
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,581
[Tim] Does anyone else
come here?

329
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,551
[Perdita] Only me.
Witch's secret, see?

330
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,926
It's better by candlelight.
Got a match?

331
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,939
Thanks.

332
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,575
Can I keep these?

333
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,776
Yeah.

334
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,419
-What's through there?
-The beach. Come on.

335
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,606
[Perdita] Oh...

336
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,711
These rocks
are a bit dodgy, so...

337
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,980
[Tim] Yeah, definitely.

338
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,784
[gulls calling]

339
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,928
What's he up to?

340
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,799
Collecting birds' eggs,
probably.

341
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,867
That's against the law.

342
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,675
Maybe that's why he's keeping
tabs on Mr Smith.

343
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,747
They're both up to something.
I'm sure of it.

344
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,750
Mr Smith just doesn't like
people knowing his business.

345
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,985
When people say that,
they've got something to hide.

346
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,593
-Any lobster?
-No.

347
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,728
-Find what you're looking for?
-Aye.

348
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,063
That's the first I've heard

349
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,666
of peregrine falcons
nesting in caves.

350
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,835
Well, you learn something
every day, don't you?

351
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,276
Is there a way up the cliff?

352
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,745
No, the only way back's
the way we came.

353
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,815
You go if you like, I want
to stay and watch the waves.

354
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,518
-OK, see you later.
-See ya.

355
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,770
Ah. A regular
Steven Spielberg, eh?

356
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,672
What have you got so far?

357
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,641
[Tim] Just you
and those men on the boat.

358
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,976
Mind if I take a look?

359
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,680
Ah, most impressive.

360
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,718
Oh! Sorry.

361
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,740
[man chuckles]

362
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,975
It's alright, I've got you.

363
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,950
It's probably broken.
I'll buy you a new one.

364
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,852
It's OK, it's fine.

365
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,066
-Where's Mum?
-Taking a nap.

366
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,168
Mr Jones tried to break
my camcorder.

367
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,703
That's nice.

368
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,904
And Birdy Smith's stealing eggs.

369
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,206
Poor chap, he must be hungry.

370
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,574
Rare birds' eggs.

371
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:20,879
It's illegal, and they're
worth loads of money, and I...

372
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,883
-Not interrupting, am I?
-No.

373
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:30,822
We... had a bit of an accident
with the camcorder, I'm afraid.

374
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:31,957
So that's what Timmy was saying.

375
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,960
If there's any problem,
I'll happily buy a replacement.

376
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,795
No. It's fine.

377
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,106
I wish I knew more about art.

378
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,775
Don't suppose you've got time
for a beer?

379
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,913
Why not?

380
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,052
[Tim] I'm telling you,
he tried to break my camcorder.

381
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,421
You read too much
detective nonsense.

382
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,090
Ten minutes,
then lights out. OK?

383
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,158
Did you know the average burglar

384
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,028
gives himself three minutes
to rob a house.

385
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,429
Any longer and the chances

386
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,698
of him getting caught
in the act double.

387
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:14,933
[Helen sighs]

388
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,103
Good night, Tim.

389
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,444
I've told you, Perdita, he pays
the bills, he makes the rules.

390
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,447
He'd have a blue fit if he knew
you were talking to strangers.

391
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,950
Tim's not a stranger,
he's my friend.

392
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,053
Stay out of trouble.
Lodgers don't grow on trees.

393
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,188
-[door closes]
-Mr Smith!

394
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,823
Shh! Not a word!

395
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,061
I just want to say good night.

396
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,930
Isn't it about time you stopped
calling me "Mr Smith"?

397
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,299
-Do we have a choice?
-Well, my name is Roger.

398
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,068
Good night, Roger.

399
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,269
Good night...

400
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,973
little witch.

401
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,178
-I saw you kissing him.
-You most certainly did not!

402
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,481
-In here, I saw you.
-I can't help your silly ideas.

403
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,184
He likes you though, doesn't he?
And you like him.

404
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,485
Will you stop matchmaking?

405
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,220
There's nothing wrong
with having a friend.

406
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,523
It's someone you can share
secrets with.

407
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,925
And what secrets do you have,
young lady?

408
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,927
That's for me to know
and you to wonder.

409
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,796
[Annie] Hmm.

410
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,031
-Sleep tight.
-Good night.

411
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,937
Good night.

412
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,523
-Boo!
-How did you get in here?

413
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,058
Witch's secret.

414
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,828
No, silly.
I sneaked up the stairs.

415
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,999
Look, I've brought you
a present.

416
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,068
I found it in the cave
after you left.

417
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,939
It could be precious,
a diamond, probably,

418
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,007
worth millions of pounds.

419
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,910
Well, worth a toffee at least.

420
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,149
[Tim] Diamonds come
from Africa or India,

421
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,017
and they don't look like this.

422
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,886
They do before
they've been cut.

423
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,821
I saw it in a book.

424
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,258
-Litterbug.
-[Helen] Tim!

425
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,867
-Who were you talking to?
-Uh, just reading aloud.

426
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,005
-Tim, where is the suitcase?
-Why?

427
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,074
I left my spare pair
of trainers in there.

428
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,909
-No, you didn't.
-Oh.

429
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,211
[Helen] Must have
left them behind.

430
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,381
Ah well, never mind.
'Night, luv.

431
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,250
[Tim] Good night.

432
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,354
[sighs]

433
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,327
That was close.
You'd better go.

434
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,962
See you tomorrow.

435
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,069
[door closes]

436
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,941
Tim, come look out here.

437
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,993
Rare bird's eggs probably.

438
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,862
You don't know that for sure.

439
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,170
That's why we have to find out.

440
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,371
How?

441
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,881
I'm off, see you.

442
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,887
[dog barks]

443
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,993
If that's a real diamond,
I'm Leonardo da Vinci.

444
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,462
It might have been dropped years
ago by smugglers or pirates.

445
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,432
-Pirates!
-Larry, don't spoil it for him.

446
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,200
Why get his hopes up?

447
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,337
[like pirate] Tis but a piece
of quartz, Tim lad!

448
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,472
Oh, good morning. Perhaps
we could have your opinion.

449
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,207
Larry, no.

450
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,209
Tim's convinced it's a diamond,
I'd say it's quartz.

451
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,381
-Where did you find this?
-A friend gave it to me.

452
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,088
I think your stepdad's right:
quartz.

453
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,059
I'll tell you what, though.

454
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,561
I'll give you ten pound for it,
just to make you feel better?

455
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,430
Oh, no, no, really.

456
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,365
No, thank you.

457
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,268
I'm afraid he's rather spoilt.

458
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,071
Twenty pound, then.

459
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,772
No, thank you.

460
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,774
Alright, last offer: 50 pound.

461
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,277
Mr Jones, don't be absurd.

462
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,513
Indulge me, dear lady.
I have no children of my own.

463
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,383
It gives me pleasure to spoil
other people's.

464
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,353
What do you say, Tim?
Fifty pound.

465
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,623
It's very kind of you,
but I'll keep the stone.

466
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,226
Ahh. Fair enough.

467
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,562
Maybe it
will
 turn out
to be a treasure,

468
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,130
like your painting.

469
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,599
Am I allowed to ask
how you're getting on?

470
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,402
I gave it to Mr Tarbutt
to keep in the safe.

471
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,472
Bad move, Mr Hoggart:
Jock can never remember

472
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,841
the combination;
he's got a memory like a sieve.

473
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,144
Just you worry about
their picnic hamper, woman.

474
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,113
I'll give you a hand.

475
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,317
I'll set up the painting
in the lounge.

476
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,664
[door rattles]

477
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:59,570
Two by twelve left,
three by seven right.

478
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:07,478
Four by fifteen left,
three by twenty-five right.

479
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,281
Now.

480
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,651
Four by fifteen to the left...

481
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:18,856
three by twenty-five
to the right...

482
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,659
two by thirty.five left.
That's it.

483
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,670
What the...?
Come here, you.

484
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,573
I just want to see the boy. Tim.

485
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,309
Listen, I just want you
out of here, you little witch!

486
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,479
Go on! Next time you'll feel
the back of my hand!

487
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:52,223
So... this is quite a discovery.

488
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,691
Worth a lot of money?

489
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,626
How can you put a price
on genius?

490
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,195
Oh, yeah.

491
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,498
[Larry] It's cleaning up
very nicely.

492
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,633
You know, Jock,

493
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:07,572
I'm beginning to feel
distinctly hopeful about this.

494
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,509
-Guess what?
-What?

495
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,611
Mr Jones offered me £50
for that stone.

496
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,247
-So it might be a diamond.
-I know.

497
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,916
[Larry] You see, in many ways
this is reminiscent of Monet,

498
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,353
particularly the cliffs,

499
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,156
the nuances of colour
and shape...

500
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,927
the sense of nature in fury.

501
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,263
[Jock] Oh yes, absolutely.

502
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,565
[Larry] You see, Jock,
for the Impressionists,

503
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,936
the quest was always towards
the representation of the truth.

504
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,540
With the tiniest hint at the
colours of the natural world,

505
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,676
the human experience
was reproduced,

506
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,479
not always exactly, I might add,

507
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,349
but almost always with passion!

508
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,652
You see what I mean
about passion, Jock?

509
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,287
Aye.

510
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,192
Just take these figures
that we're uncovering there.

511
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,554
What's fascinating
is how the figures imply

512
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,322
a kind of dramatic narrative,

513
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,725
instead of just being
incidental accessories.

514
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,462
Sorry, Tim's always telling me
I'm good enough

515
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,265
to bore for England on
this wicket, aren't you, Tim?

516
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,306
Tim?

517
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,783
Timmy?

518
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,807
What the hell...?

519
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,409
What on earth?!

520
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,350
Larry!
Betty, fetch a doctor!

521
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,419
What have I told you
about polishing the floor?!

522
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,055
I don't think he slipped.

523
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,459
What happened to him?

524
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,294
[helicopter blades whirring]

525
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,469
Will he be OK?

526
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,671
It's too early to tell.
We'll do everything we can.

527
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,873
-Good.
-But we really have to go, now.

528
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,342
Larry didn't slip,
he was knocked out.

529
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,677
Not now, Tim! Please!

530
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,413
I'm sorry, but I can only
take one passenger.

531
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,348
He's just a kid!
I can't leave him!

532
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,884
-It's you or him, I'm afraid.
-He has to come with me!

533
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,486
Those are the rules.

534
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,389
You want me to leave him
on an island full of strangers?

535
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,424
-Sorry.
-Wait, just wait.

536
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,562
Betty, can you look after Tim?
There's no room in the copter.

537
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,532
Of course, Helen, don't worry.
Larry needs you with him now.

538
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,435
-You'll be all right with me.
-Yeah, of course.

539
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,736
I'll phone as soon as I can.

540
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,539
-It's now or never!
-[Tim] Go on, Mom!

541
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,994
I knew it!

542
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,439
Mrs Tarbutt?

543
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,612
-What's the matter?
-The painting's been stolen,

544
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,515
my room's been robbed, and I
know who did it: Mr Jones.

545
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,818
-Ah, is that a fact?
-What are you doing with that?

546
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,687
Putting it back
where it belongs.

547
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,824
I think you owe Mr Jones
an apology, young man.

548
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,628
-Sorry.
-[Jones] That's alright.

549
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:02,666
He's upset, aren't you?

550
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,201
Ooh, look.

551
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,004
Why don't you go
buy yourself an ice cream?

552
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,706
No, thanks.

553
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,619
So you risked everything
for a videotape?

554
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,687
The kid had me on it, and you.

555
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,023
-And what if the man dies?
-Who cares?

556
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,691
Tomorrow I'll be in Spain,

557
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,560
with a jug of sangria
in one hand

558
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,595
and a señorita in the other.

559
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,797
Oh, no you won't.

560
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,533
You'll be here tomorrow,
and the day after.

561
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,835
There are only two ferries
a week off this island.

562
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,537
You pick a dump like this.

563
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,840
When laying low, there aren't
many places to choose from.

564
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,845
-Fancy you bringing golf clubs.
-[Jones] How was I to know?

565
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,248
Besides, we can't all be
as sophisticated as you.

566
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,516
Birdy Smith, author and recluse.

567
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,787
I hid my tracks until you came
around knocking people about.

568
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:00,491
As you know, if people get
in my way, I knock 'em about.

569
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,030
-That's a good one.
-Give me that tape.

570
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,867
[tape splashes]

571
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,569
Right, I'm off.

572
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,777
I don't know about Mr Jones,
but Mr Smith's not a bad man.

573
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,279
If he was, Annie would have
nothing to do with him.

574
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,949
So what were he and Mr Jones
up to last night?

575
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,884
What are you accusing him of?

576
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,920
Nothing yet, but he's
on my list of suspects,

577
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,323
unless you can prove
who he says he is.

578
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,991
Alright, I'll prove it.

579
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,801
I thought you weren't
allowed in here.

580
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,035
I'm not.

581
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,039
It's definitely here,
somewhere.

582
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,985
See? He's just a nice man
who writes about birds.

583
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,023
This is where I used to sit.

584
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:10,094
History's my favourite, and
English, especially Shakespeare.

585
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,929
Look. See?

586
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:16,600
Author Birdy Smith, with some
of
her
 feathered friends.

587
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:17,935
Your Mr Smith's an impostor.

588
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,771
That doesn't prove he's done
anything wrong.

589
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,673
Or he's anything
to do with Mr Jones.

590
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,775
Why are you always
protecting him?

591
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,744
He pays rent;
that's how we live.

592
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,146
If he goes to prison, what
would happen to me and Annie?

593
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,016
Prison?
So you do think he's suspicious.

594
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,652
I don't know what to think.

595
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,587
I wish you'd never come!

596
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,724
[Tim] Perdita!

597
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,163
[diamonds rattling]

598
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,198
See you later.

599
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:38,175
Three minutes.
Ready, steady, go!

600
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,802
[Perdita] Ahem!

601
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,074
I thought
I had at least another--

602
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,842
No one's allowed in here.

603
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,877
He doesn't even let Annie
in to clean.

604
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:19,116
Perdita, the stone you found
was definitely a diamond.

605
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,984
He has lots of them.
I was watching.

606
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,553
-Who?
-Jones!

607
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:23,954
Look.

608
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,858
He was in the school.

609
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,960
He reached up
on top of the bookcase

610
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,130
and pulled down a pouch
full of diamonds.

611
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:37,000
So, you see, it's not
birds' eggs after all.

612
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,969
And I'll bet Mr Smith's got

613
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,038
just as many diamonds
for himself.

614
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,006
Come on, help me look.

615
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,809
-Mr Smith's not a bad man.
-They're in it together.

616
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,277
You saw them yourself.

617
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,147
-They each had a pouch.
-That doesn't prove anything.

618
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,884
Why pretend to be Birdy Smith
if he hasn't anything to hide?

619
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,152
He just wants to be alone.

620
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:58,155
Look, I've got Jones
and the diamonds on tape.

621
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,991
All I need now is to catch
Jones and Smith together.

622
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,293
[Perdita] Mr Smith's a good man.

623
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,363
Tim, please.
Will you go now, please?

624
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:11,301
-I just want to be left alone.
-[sighs] OK, I'll go.

625
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,805
But I'll prove it, I will.

626
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,975
[sighs]

627
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,282
[Annie] Ready!

628
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,418
Just a minute.

629
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,472
What are you reading today?

630
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,474
-Charles Dickens.
-Very good.

631
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,710
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

632
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,144
Bye.

633
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,350
So, uh, what's all this about?

634
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,720
[Smith] Um...

635
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,323
[Annie] Something
wrong with my cooking?

636
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,158
[Smith] No, no.

637
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,229
Really, I just thought
it would make a change.

638
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,532
Help!

639
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,500
Tim!

640
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,375
There's a word
for people like you: nuisance!

641
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,510
And there's a word
for people like
you:
 thief.

642
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,246
I beg your pardon?

643
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,815
Diamond thief, to be precise.

644
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:47,117
I reckon you and Mr Smith
stole them together.

645
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,319
He's been lying low
till the fuss died down.

646
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,088
Now you've come for your share,

647
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,522
and I've got
the diamonds on videotape.

648
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,562
[Tim screams]

649
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,609
[camera splashes]

650
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,094
A little bird told me your boat

651
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:34,164
might be available
for a trip to the mainland.

652
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,632
Maybe.

653
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,589
Help!

654
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,226
[Campbell] Well, there we are.

655
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,295
Sea's calm.

656
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,297
We should make it
in about two hours.

657
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,378
So, Annie...

658
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,549
have you ever thought
of settling down?

659
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,717
[explosion]

660
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,122
Back as soon as I can.

661
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:35,692
Where are you going?

662
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,066
[explosion]

663
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,638
-What is it?
-Someone's in trouble.

664
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,240
Come on!

665
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,546
[gulls calling]

666
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,449
[Tim] Help!

667
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,519
[alarm sounding]

668
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,723
What's the problem, boys?

669
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,613
What is it, Perdita?
What can you see?

670
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,428
[Perdita] Tim!

671
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,514
[rescuer] Stay there, boy,
you'll be OK.

672
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,720
OK. You're safe now.
Turn around.

673
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:35,278
OK, drop him down to us!
Take it easy.

674
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,649
There we are.
Good boy, that's it.

675
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,686
Throw me the line.

676
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,522
Well done, little witch.

677
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:00,437
[crowd murmuring]

678
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,074
You're lucky nothing's broken.

679
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,509
A fall like that
could've killed you.

680
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,612
I didn't fall, he pushed me.

681
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,648
Now, that's a very serious
accusation, son.

682
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,717
[Jones] And it's not the first.

683
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,519
I steal a painting,
then I try and kill you.

684
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,388
What are you gonna
accuse me of next?

685
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,858
You tried to sneak out of the
hotel without paying, I saw you.

686
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,562
-I followed you with my camera.
-I was out for a stroll.

687
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,832
That's all; besides, why would
I check out of the hotel

688
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,834
when I've got no intention
of leaving?

689
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,403
-Why did you have your luggage?
-I didn't.

690
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,071
And I saw you
in the schoolhouse.

691
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,575
What would a man my age
be wanting in a schoolhouse?

692
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,544
[Tim] You went to get the
diamonds you'd hidden there.

693
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,714
He's a jewel thief, and I've got
the evidence on videotape.

694
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,551
[bystander] It's ruined.

695
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,353
[Jones] See?

696
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,756
It's obvious what happened.
He dropped the camera,

697
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,091
then fell off the cliff
trying to get it back.

698
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,427
Now he blames me
so he doesn't get into trouble

699
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,129
for wasting these chaps' time.

700
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,698
You shouldn't tell lies, lad.
Truth will out.

701
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,367
I'm not telling lies!

[monitor beeping]

703
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,685
-You sure you're all right?
-Fine, honestly.

704
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,921
No more adventures, OK?
Just stay out of harm

705
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,123
-till I get back. 
-When will that be?

706
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,526
As soon as there's
another ferry, I promise.

707
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,661
Did Larry say
what happened to him?

708
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,396
No, no.

709
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,732
He's still unconscious.

710
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,701
Tim, are you sure
you're alright?

711
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,502
Yes, fine.

712
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,737
OK.

713
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,938
I love you lots.

714
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,540
You too.

715
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,745
I'll make sure he's all right,
Mrs Hoggart.

716
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,147
-Don't you worry. 
-Thank you, Betty.

717
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,515
Bye.

718
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,884
OK then, bye-bye.

719
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,153
We came to see how you are, Tim.

720
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,621
You, out!

721
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,757
Jock Tarbutt,
she saved the boy's life!

722
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,625
This hotel is for guests.

Perdita's my guest, Mr Tarbutt.
Supper for three, please.

724

Jock!

725
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,606
Well, it's like I get
a sort of tingling in my head,

726
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,943
and then I see things with
light shining all around them,

727
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,511
much brighter than normal.

728
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,647
And then I feel
really really tired.

729
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,182
I suppose you think it's silly.

730
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,984
He doesn't now, do you, Tim?

731
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,487
I'm just glad you did it.

732
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,721
[Betty] There you go, dear.

733
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,457
-Thank you.
-What's this?

734
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,960
She's never eaten out before,
hardly been off the island.

735
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,628
Well, you enjoy it.

736
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,669
Oh, Perdita,
that's your new dress.

737
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,772
Go and wash it off.

738
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,573
Sorry.

739
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:58,515
You have to get off this island
before someone gets killed.

740
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,484
Don't blame me; I'd be long gone
if it wasn't for that boy.

741
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,753
Besides, I've decided
it was an omen.

742
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:07,557
I'm just not meant
to leave without that painting.

743
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,792
[Smith] You're crazy.

744
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:12,562
[Jones] Wouldn't it be nice
to work together one last time?

745
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,230
[Smith] Read my lips.

746
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:19,536
No. I'm not going to risk jail
because you've turned greedy.

747
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:22,705
Now you read
my
 lips:
you're gonna crack that safe,

748
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,774
or your friend Annie
is going to find out

749
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,610
all about your exciting past,
and who knows,

750
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:31,714
some public-spirited sort
might decide to send the police

751
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,050

00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:55,672
-Larry! Can you hear me?
-[Larry groaning]

755
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:56,873
Oh, thank goodness.

757
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,047
Are you all right?

758
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,621
If you knew someone was going
to do a bad thing

759
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,023
and they'd get in trouble
if they got caught,

760
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:18,094
serious trouble,
would you try and stop them?

761
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:22,298
Well, I suppose it would
depend how bad the thing was.

762
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,667
Is there anything you want
to tell me?

763
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:26,536
No, just wondering. 'Night.

764
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,038
Night-night.

[whispering] This is the last
I ever see of you, understand?

never see my ugly mug again.

Jock!

776
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,050
So, how did you do it?

777
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,753
I suppose you're going to
tell me it's a witch's secret?

778
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,421
Do you always talk in riddles?

779
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,924
I found this toffee wrapper
by the safe at the inn.

780
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,760
I was there for supper
last night, remember?

781
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,895
Yes, but this must
have been dropped

782
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,797
after Mrs Tarbutt did
the vacuuming,

783
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,432
or she would have seen it.

784
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,769
I heard the vacuum cleaner at
10:30, an hour after you left.

785
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,138
Which means you must have
come back later.

I may be a litterbug,

but I do not go around
stealing paintings.

788
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:49,445
Who said anything about
the painting?

789
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,048
Where is it?
In your room?

790

You've no right.

792
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,722
Now, if I wanted to hide
something,

793
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,492
where would I put it:
in the wardrobe?

794
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,460
No, too obvious.

795
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,196

01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,032
No.

But how about
in
 the bed?

798
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,473
There's two things
I can't understand:

799
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,743
one, how you knew
the combination to the safe,

800
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,278
and two, why you stole it.

801
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,481
-You stole that?
-I found it in the first place.

802
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,918
Doesn't make it yours to keep.
Tim, would you mind?

803
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:32,121
I'm sorry, Perdita, I didn't
mean to get you into trouble.

804
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,227
We might as well start packing:

805
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,096
the Island Council aren't
gonna stand for stealing.

806
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,065
I only did it for him.

807
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:44,133
And he's not even
who he says he is!

808
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,772
So, who exactly are you?

809
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,136
I had a small security firm.

810
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:24,006
Business was bad,
and I discovered that my partner

811
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,810
had transferred
all the debts into my name.

812
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,146
I lost everything,
went bankrupt.

813
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,547
Then you start again.

814
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:35,885
New business, no worries,
transporting uncut diamonds.

815
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,190
Which you decided to steal.

816
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:46,596
I met Jones in a bar.
I was drowning my sorrows.

817
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,564
It was his idea.

818
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,167
I knew my partner
would be insured,

819
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,103
so it seemed like
a victimless crime.

820
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:58,040
Have you any idea
what Perdita's done for you?

821
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,342
She stole the painting.

822
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,179
Why?

823
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,181
So you couldn't steal it,

824
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,216
so you wouldn't
get caught and go to jail.

825
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,287
Why would she protect me?

826
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,090
Because this last year,

827
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,893
you're the nearest she's had
to a father.

828
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,162
Don't you see?

829
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,098
You and me,
we're all she's got.

He's gone to Carlin's Cave.
The man paid him.

835
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,871
Thank you.

You've not got long.
The tide's coming in fast.

837
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,886
[Larry] No.

838
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:26,229
So you say this man, Mr Jones,
crept into your son's room?

839
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,699
Yes. I went to look for Tim.

840
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,668
I opened the door...

841
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:36,405
and there was
Mr Jones in Tim's room

842
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,008
with an ashtray in his hand.

843
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,478
Next thing I knew,
I was waking up here.

844
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,284
Wait a minute!

845
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,920

850
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,341
Perdita, it's high tide.

851
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:47,343
This place will flood
in a minute.

852
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:50,446
Then you'd better go,
hadn't you?

853
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,482
Look, I'm sorry I dropped you.

854
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,085

it would have happened anyway.

Put those back!

-You nosy brats.
-They belong to Mr Smith.

01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,395
Oh.

860
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,297
Oh. Now, that poses

861
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,234
a very interesting question,
doesn't it?

862
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:20,836
'Cause as he stole them
in the first place,

863
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,573
they don't belong to him, so I
can't be stealing them, can I?

864
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,542
We'll see what the police
say about that.

01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:29,612
-Oh, will we, now?
-[Perdita] Quick!

866
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,282
Come here, you pair of...

867
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,295
Come here, you...

868
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:58,607
Hurry up!

869
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,877
[ladder rattling]

870
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,512
[metal clangs]

871
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,389
Carefully.

872
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,899
Come on, kids.
I like children.

873
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,701
[metal rattling]

874
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,409
Ho!

875
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,910
Ho ho.

876
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,512
Gotcha.

877
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:42,518
What was it you were saying
about the police?

878
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,386
[Perdita] Get off!

879
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,388
Get down!

880
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,224
[Jones] Do you mind?

881
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:53,696
Alright!

882
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,533
[retreating footsteps]

883
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:17,620
Where's he gone?

884
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:20,723
Come on.

885
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:45,014
No way up and, oh dear,
oh dear...

886
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,982
[ladder clangs]

887
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,717
no way down.

888
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,320
You can't just leave us up here.

889
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,222
Watch me.

890
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,361
[chuckles]

891
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,264
We'll have to drop down.

892
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,733
That's too far.
We'd break our legs.

893
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,602
We'll shout then.

894
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:09,838
Nobody comes here except me.
Nobody would hear.

895
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,709
-Help!
-Help!

896
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:17,346
[Perdita and Tim] Help!

897
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:49,411
But Mr Jones is still here.

898
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,847
He was on the cliff top
yesterday when Tim fell.

899
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,049
Well, he's the one
who hit Larry.

900
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,885
And Mr Smith is involved too,
except his name

901
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,055
isn't Birdy Smith,
it's, uh, Roger Stanton.

902
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:03,058
-Oh, no.
-Tim is all right, isn't he?

903
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,327
[both straining]

904
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,464
It's just too hard.

905
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,436
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

906
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,839
Ah yeah, I was looking for you.

907
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,412
Nice of you to get these for me.

908
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,880
Would you believe there are
certain gentlemen

909
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,815
who might have done
a runner with them?

910
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,585
Can't trust no one these days,
can you?

911
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,392
How did he get here?

912
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,532
We can try swimming out.

913
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:45,501
And then what?
There's no way up the cliff.

914
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,736
-Someone might see us.
-No, they can't.

915
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,474
-We could try.
-No!

916
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,512
Look, it's your only choice.

917
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,350
You can't swim, can you?

918
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,357
Come on.

919
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,707
[Smith] How much
is he paying you?

920
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,610
More than me, I guess,

921
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:31,714
and that's all
that counts with you, eh?

922
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,516
Times are hard, Mr Smith.

923
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,186
Aye.

924
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,855
[helicopter approaching]

925
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,629
Damn kids must have called
the police

926
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,164
before they went into the cave.

927
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,265
What kids?

928
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,735
The brat with the camera
and the witch's daughter.

929
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,771
-They were hiding behind rocks.
-You left them there?

930
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:58,173
Yeah. They're stuck
in a shaft in the cave.

931
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,876
They'll drown, but it's alright;
it'll look like an accident.

932
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:04,680
-Can't this thing go any faster?
-Turn back.

933
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,950
-Turn back.
-Are you out of your mind?

934
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:09,985
I'll not leave
two children to drown.

935
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,920
-Take the dinghy.
-They'll be dead

936
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,856
by the time I get there.
Turn back!

937
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,458
My boat, my rules.

938
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:19,528
If you go back, you'll spend
the next five years

939
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,729
rotting in jail.

940
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,197
Think about it.

941
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,600
[Campbell] We'll phone for help
when we get to the mainland.

942
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,503
-It'll be OK.
-It won't be OK. Listen.

943
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,972
Yours. Just stop this boat.

944
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:46,021
My fingers are numb.
I can't hold on.

945
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,990
-Yes, you can!
-You go.

946
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:49,792
What, and leave you here?
No way!

947
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,960
The tide can't go on
rising forever.

948
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,821
I suppose it's too much
to expect you to wait.

949
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,723
I'd like to help, but...

950
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,859
Times are hard, I know.

951
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,595
Hey. Just get me
to the mainland.

952
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:36,605
I'm scared.

953
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:37,906
It's OK.

954
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:40,876
[Perdita gasps]

955
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,611
Perdita!

956
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,719
Hold on.

957
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:53,922
It's OK.
You're alright.

958
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:58,093
You're all right, just hold on.

959
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,998
Hold on tight.
You'll be all right.

960
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:06,835
-You OK?
-Yeah.

961
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:10,072
Don't worry.

962
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,576
Perdita!

963
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,079
Tim!

964
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,850
Perdita!

965
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,953
Tim!

966
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:35,030
Perdita!

967
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,699
Tim!

968
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:40,135
Tim!

969
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:41,837
Perdita!

970
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:05,861
It's no good.

971
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,767
Perdita! Perdita!

972
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,073
It's alright.

973
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:20,208
I've got you. It's OK.

974
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,748
We've got to go back down again.

975
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,817
-I can't.
-She can't swim.

976
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:29,985
Yes, she can.

977
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:33,121
I'm going to take you down
the shaft and into the cave.

978
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,723
All right?

979
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,693
You have to take a deep breath
and hold on.

980
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,394
Hold on to me tight.
Alright?

981
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,762
You can do it, Tim?

982
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:45,033
All right.
One, two, three...

983
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,077
Get her, Tim.

984
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,905
-You'll be OK, little witch.
-What will happen to you?

985
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,940
Don't worry about me,
I'll be fine.

986
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,809
Go on.

987
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,311
-Thanks, Tim.
-Thank you.

988
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:13,221
What's happened to you?

989
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,490
For goodness' sake,
you're soaking wet.

990
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,159
Come on.

991
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,997
Right, Mr Stanton.

992
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:28,103
[officer] Your friend will be
on the mainland by now,

993
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,038
laughing his head off at you,
probably.

994
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:32,007
He's no friend of mine.

995
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,009
Please,
not in front of the girl.

996
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,045
I'm sorry.

997
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,849
Take care of yourself, eh?

998
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,000
Don't be a fool.

999
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,038
No!

1000
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,407
Down! Down!

1001
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,024
Have they found him?

1002
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,961
Perdita!

1003
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:53,081
So the only real evidence
you had was on your camcorder?

1004
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,417
Yes. But wait!

1005
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:57,452
Jones knew you were on to him.

1006
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,421
So?

1007
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:01,423
So he'd never risk moving
too far.

1008
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:04,159
He'd hide somewhere,
wait till the fuss died down,

1009
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,260
then make a run for it.

1010
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:09,998
Ah yes, your mum told us
about you and your theories.

1011
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,234
Why will no one ever
take me seriously?

1012
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:15,103
-The boy may have a point, sir.
-Maybe,

1013
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,239
but Jones will be
on the mainland by now.

1014
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,474
It'll take us months
to find him.

1015
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,112
Not necessarily.

1016
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,151
Kids.

1017
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,191
-Where's Perdita?
-Asleep.

1018
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,059
-Leave her.
-I'm sorry, but it's important.

1019
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,127
[Annie] Tim!

1020
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,164
What are you doing?

1021
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,179
What are you looking for?

1022
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,099
Stop! Wait!

1023
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:24,739
"Logan Arms Hotel"?

1024
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:28,343
Mr Jones had these
when he arrived.

1025
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:31,346
My hunch is it's where
he stayed on his way here

1026
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:33,281
so it might be where he is now.

1027
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,518
[police radio chatter]

1028
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,256
You have no right to arrest me!

1029
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,758
Oh, really?
Try "aiding and abetting."

1030
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,226
[officer] You know what,
Mr Jones,

1031
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,528
my heart bleeds for you.

1032
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,463
These stones must be worth
a fortune,

1033
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:50,465
and you'll never see
a penny of it.

1034
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:53,501
Now that's sad, very sad.

1035
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:56,271
There'll be plenty of other jobs
for me when I get out.

1036
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,239
Oh, but you don't understand.

1037
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:00,208
After what you did
to those kids,

1038
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:03,178
you're never getting out,
never!

1039
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,082
[siren wails]

1040
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,794
Aunt Annie, the lobsters.

1041
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,630
I saw them, they're back.
Come on.

1042
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,813
It's a miracle,
the curse has been lifted!

1043
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,517
Perdita, they're enormous!
Want one for dinner tonight?

1044
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,053
Yes, please.

1045
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,597
-I wish Mr Smith was here.
-So do I.

1046
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,297
[happy chatter]

1047
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,403
Look, that's gonna taste
really good.

1048
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:42,343
Thanks for your help
looking after Tim, Betty.

1049
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,312
Oh, it was a pleasure. Oh!

1050
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:47,315
I'm just glad
everything turned out fine.

1051
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:48,616
By the way, how's Larry?

1052
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,351
I think he's on the mend.

1053
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:51,486
Ooh, he's heard from the museum.

1054
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,888
They want to reward the person
who found the painting.

1055
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,391
Oh, lucky Perdita.
Here, Helen.

1056
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,626
I've got a wee souvenir for you.

1057
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,261
I'm sorry about what happened.

1058
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:03,565
[sighs] It wasn't your fault.
You did what was right.

1059
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,300
I tried.

1060
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:10,238
-Perdita?
-Yes.

1061
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:13,575
-I'd like you to have this.
-But it was a gift to you.

1062
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:17,512
I'd like you to have it,
to remember me.

1063
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,414
-I'll make you a deal.
-What?

1064
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,549
If you come back
to see me one day,

1065
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,585
maybe I'll accept it then.

1066
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,687
It's a deal.

1067
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:29,691
Tim!
Come and look at this.

1068
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:35,964
Look.

1069
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,466
Come on, luv,
we'll miss the ferry.

1070
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,667
Say goodbye to Betty.

1071
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:42,437
-Come back soon, Tim.
-You bet.

1072
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,773
I know someone who's gonna
miss you quite a lot.

1073
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,442
[Tim] Perdita?

1074
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,478
Perdita.

1075
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:33,354
[Smith] Don't be scared.

1076
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:43,331
[Perdita] Where were you?

1077
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:46,034
I thought if I made it
look like I was dead,

1078
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:47,769
the police would
stop searching for me.

1079
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:49,537
They do think you're dead,

1080
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:52,740
and they've got the diamonds,
so why did you come back?

1081
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:56,344
I was cold, wet, tired...

1082
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,613
but most of all I was scared
of being caught.

1083
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:00,615
That's no way to live.

1084
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:03,518
But why did you come
back here, to me?

1085
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:07,422
I wanted to see you, and I want
to see you go back to school,

1086
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:10,625
and I want to see you
looked after and happy.

1087
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:13,461
It's not just me
you came back for, is it?

1088
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:16,664
No. It's not just you.

1089
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:19,467
It's Annie.

1090
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,769
Perdita, there's something
you have to understand.

1091
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,671
[Perdita] I'll try.

1092
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,308
I'm gonna go away for a while.

1093
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:28,710
To hide?

1094
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,645
No. I'm gonna do something

1095
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:31,779
I should have done

1096
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:33,381
a long time ago.

1097
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,416
I'm gonna turn myself in.

1098
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:39,520
Hopefully I won't be away
too long, and...

1099
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,889
I'll come back, I promise.
