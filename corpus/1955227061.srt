00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,119
INTERVIEWER: So what
are we up to here?

3
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:26,560
We are about to go audition for
Troma Films "Toxic Avenger 4."

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,764
INTERVIEWER: And what's
your ideal situation here?

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,967
Well, to get the part of Toxie.

6
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,670
MAN: And why, exactly,
do you want to be Toxie?

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,241
Well, it's gonna
be a lot of fun.

8
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,209
[Laughs]

9
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,144
I know, [inaudible] to cry.

10
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,112
Yeah, crying.

11
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,679
This is the house of stupidity.

12
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,381
MAN: Oh, that
looks really great.

13
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,016
MAN: This is truly fucking art.

14
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:50,351
MAN: Fuckers.

15
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:51,685
MAN: By and large, the people
who work here are idiots.

16
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,821
And you can't complain about
it, because all you're doing

17
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,955
Is complaining to
the same idiots.

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,890
Fuck Troma.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,726
MAN: Jesus Christ,
it's like Stupidville.

20
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,094
Seriously.

21
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,662
I don't want to waste my 160
IQ on this particular problem.

22
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:02,463
MAN: Fire in the hole.

23
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,297
MAN: God dammit.

24
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,299
Who's got a leaf rake?

25
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,000
Boom gets in my
frame one more time,

26
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,069
I'm gonna fuck
this place up, boy.

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,739
MAN: [inaudible] just
look at the fucking stuff

28
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:12,540
And be scared.

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,041
MAN: They don't care.

30
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:15,543
No, they just
don't fucking care.

31
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:16,544
MAN: This is ridiculous.

32
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,045
You're supposed to
stay in your line.

33
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:19,680
We may have a camera problem.

34
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,215
But I don't know about
it, and he's gonna

35
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,816
Shoot him right in the chest.

36
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,318
MAN: At the end of the film.

37
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,787
Anybody bring Toxie
to makeup, or are we--

38
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,989
INTERVIEWER: How's the
experience been so far, man?

39
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,391
It fucking sucks, man.

40
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,525
I suck!

41
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,861
Trent is totally losing
his mind on this set.

42
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:34,795
I'm the director.

43
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:35,896
I'm the boss.

44
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:36,697
Ah!

Relaxing Tromaville.

51
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,653
All your cares
just dissolve away.

52
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:03,657
INTERVIEWER: So do you have any
day number one, pre-first shot

53
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,659
Comments or thoughts?

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,495
[Motor whirring]

55
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,764
First shot comments, mm.

56
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:16,737
No, I'm looking forward
to "Citizen Toxie," right?

57
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,173
INTERVIEWER: Geoff, what
are you doing right now?

58
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:25,646
Well, here we have 800,000
pages of script revisions.

59
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,248
INTERVIEWER: All from yesterday?

60
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:32,152
Well, from the past
couple days, really, so.

61
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,958
Pretty soon the entire
script will be pink.

62
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,327
Script revisions.

63
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,127
Oh, nice.

64
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:41,028
Good, good.

65
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,029
MAN: Coffee?

66
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:42,830
No, thank you.

67
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,535
INTERVIEWER: How's it going
on the day number one?

68
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,503
It's going all right.

69
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,607
I would ask that you don't
come downstairs for today.

70
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,008
It's going OK.

71
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,879
I guess I'm supposed
to be the AD. [laugh]

72
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,548
INTERVIEWER: What's
happening downstairs?

73
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,551
We're getting Toxie
ready and Heidi ready.

74
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,486
It's costume and
makeup is down here.

75
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:09,290
But they're a little bit
proprietary about their area,

76
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,692
And maybe just for now.

77
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,794
You know, sometime we
want to get the Toxie

78
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,696
Makeup applied and stuff.

79
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,598
But not today, OK?

80
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,399
INTERVIEWER: OK.

81
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,500
All right.

82
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,169
Yeah, because you know
Gabe's rule of thumb

83
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,905
Is everything that you should
not do, you should get on tape.

84
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,240
But I--
-Yeah, yeah.

85
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,040
But it's--

86
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,941
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

87
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,310
Dude, it's gonna
come down on me.

88
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,279
Then I'll have to
come down on you.

89
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,448
And I don't want to be
[inaudible] gonna have to.

90
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,249
OK?

91
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,587
WOMAN: Hi.
-Oh, hi.

92
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:40,588
-How's it going?
-Good.

93
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,555
How are you?
-Good.

94
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,356
Good.

95
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,357
You look fresh as a daisy.

96
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,758
-Yeah.
-Good luck.

97
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:45,793
Thanks.

98
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,027
Only a few revisions
today, by the way.

99
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,195
This is all for your scene.
-I heard.

100
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:49,630
-We've got it all [inaudible].
-OK.

101
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,564
This is all you.

102
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,332
I didn't actually
get these yet.

103
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,132
-No, I'm kidding.
-Oh.

104
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,367
-Yeah, [inaudible].
-Oh.

105
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,235
Oh.

106
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,971
INTERVIEWER: So what's
happening today?

107
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,342
We're gonna shoot a scene, two
or three-- sex scene, woohoo!

108
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,150
Sure.

109
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:18,859
INTERVIEWER: So what's your
biggest fear about today?

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,660
Fear?

111
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,395
I have no fears.

112
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,632
INTERVIEWER: What's the
word of the day so far?

113
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:31,204
Uh, I think it seems very
tranquil and very pleasant--

114
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:34,642
A lot of people
standing around waiting,

115
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:39,347
Waiting, waiting for Toxie to
emerge, the new '90s Toxie.

116
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,481
Huh?

117
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,682
INTERVIEWER: How's it
going on day number one?

118
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,950
Oh, good.

119
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,917
INTERVIEWER: Are you excited?

120
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,653
Yeah, I'm really excited.

121
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:49,256
INTERVIEWER: All right, what's
your biggest hope for today?

122
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,492
Uh, I'm not that
ambitious, either.

123
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,928
MAN: I don't want a title.

124
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,098
No, no, you got-- you've got
to put them in the script.

125
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,500
WOMAN: Could be three hours.

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,868
These are revisions.

127
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:01,902
Oh, OK.

128
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,671
So you want notes in
the margin to go--

129
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:08,909
Page 18 replaces that page 18.

130
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:09,710
These are replacements.

131
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,445
Don't you have these?

132
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,547
I don't personally
have them, but these--

133
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,782
Oh, you should get them.

134
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,216
These are script revisions.

135
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,586
This 18 replaces that 18.

136
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,721
OK, so how do I know
which ones replace--

137
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,623
Just take-- just take the page.

138
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,591
Right?

139
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,093
You'll see the scene
numbers, right?

140
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,228
I don't think I follow you.

141
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,329
Do you want--

142
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,598
Could be the-- what
you do is, let's say--

143
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,099
What's the first page here?

144
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,166
Page one.

145
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,102
All right, so do I
have a page one there?

146
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,036
Yes.

147
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,739
OK, so you take
out that page one.

148
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,676
[Chatter]

149
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,345
You take out page one.

150
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,947
Then you put page one in, see?

151
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,949
Oh, so anything with
notes in the margins.

152
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:49,883
No, no.

153
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,019
Any pink sheet,
that's a revision.

154
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,754
That replaces the white sheets.

155
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,756
Pink is more
important than white.

156
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,958
So you take out-- you see?

157
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,259
This is page one.

158
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,728
Right, so now page one, i
principal, we will not use,

159
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:01,862
Except I have notes on it.

160
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,233
So then this is page two.

161
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,636
So page two-- it's
a new page two.

162
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:09,703
You see?

163
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,338
It's actually-- it
looks the same to me.

164
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,540
It's not the same.

165
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,542
It may look the same, but
there'll be differences.

166
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:16,410
It's like "Sesame Street."

167
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,145
You know, it's like
one of those quizzes

168
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,380
Where you have to
see what's different.

169
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,117
So there's something in here
that either I or somebody made.

170
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,887
So you will find
a change in here.

171
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,456
That's what these are all about.

172
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,523
OK.

173
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:30,190
But because there's
how many right now?

174
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,124
Look, look, right here.

175
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,225
Here's the change.
See?

176
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,360
-OK.
-That's different.

177
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:34,695
You see?

178
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,797
You see "Tex smashes
the teacher in the face

179
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,698
With the back of the book."

180
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:38,666
That was added.

181
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,800
That's not in the first thing.

182
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,901
So you take this away.

183
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,002
In principal, we're
gonna throw that way.

184
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:45,105
And you replace--
there's a new page two.

185
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,239
OK.

186
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,208
So you don't want the
whole script to be pink.

187
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,009
No.

188
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,310
No, these are revisions.

189
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,178
You just want certain--

190
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,480
These are revisions.

191
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,181
Every time you do revisions,
you do a different color.

192
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,983
Now, page four,
you take another--

193
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,417
Take that old page four.

194
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,286
OK, this is pa-- oh, OK.

195
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,788
-See?
-These don't have-- OK, I see.

196
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:01,789
At least-- no, you don't see.

197
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:02,956
No, I do see.

198
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,125
This is omitting certain pages.

199
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,326
No, it's not omitting anything.

200
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,762
The whole idea is that
when this says page four,

201
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,063
This is now page four.

202
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,098
It's going to be pink.

203
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,399
We don't like white page four.

204
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,200
MAN: Right here.

205
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,367
So you take out that.

206
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:15,168
A racial thing.

207
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:15,969
[Laugh]

208
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,005
Pink is better than white.

209
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,508
So that's all it is is
a matter of-- pulling

210
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,209
The sheets out in
this program cuts them

211
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,376
So that the lines are the same.

212
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:24,578
Oh, OK.
That's perfect.

213
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,979
And everything
should be all right.

214
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,683
So the idea is that this-- this
color-- slowly, every time you

215
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,119
Do revisions, you do a different
color, so that way people know.

216
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,220
And you ought to
be getting them.

217
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,922
If you're an AD,
you should get them.

218
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,089
-All right.
-OK.

219
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,390
So now you know what to do.

220
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,426
Now you take seven, and you
put seven where seven is.

221
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:40,460
Go to a table, though.

222
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,162
Do you want me to
deliver this to you?

223
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,597
Yes, hand it to me as
soon as you're done.

224
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,965
Yeah.

225
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,034
Sit at a table, though, because
it's-- maybe sit at a nice,

226
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,737
Comfortable table, one of
the beautiful German tables.

227
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,476
Double check that the script
is tasked with the [inaudible].

228
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,811
TRENT: Yes, yes.

229
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,680
I will make sure that-- I
think it's pretty damn simple.

230
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,082
You take out page four and
replace another page four.

231
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,016
Yeah, I would think so.

232
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,417
Yeah, I will
double check that--

233
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,653
And the reason why they're pink
is so that we know that those

234
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:06,887
Are the revised pages.
-Exactly.

235
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,121
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We should
start shooting soon, though.

236
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,523
Yes, sir.

237
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:13,326
We will be ready for a costume
rehearsal in about 20 minutes.

238
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,127
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK.

239
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,262
What's that?

240
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,564
INTERVIEWER: I'm a
little bit unclear on how

241
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,600
These script revisions work.

242
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,102
Oh. [laugh] You're
trying to annoy me.

243
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,871
You're trying to get me going.

244
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,774
And I'm gonna be calm and cool.

245
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:29,042
Needles and pins,
pins and needles

246
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,479
Makes us-- whatever Jackie
Gleason said, that's me.

247
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,714
I don't see any changes.

248
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,584
That was the best part.
"Looks the same to me."

249
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,418
It was great.

250
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,988
I made a prediction
as of yesterday,

251
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:44,191
Which is OK, that we would
be-- that first shot would

252
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,393
Be up by 10:30.

253
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,328
Now, what do you
think about that?

254
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,797
It's 8:30 now.

255
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,531
And I'll tell you, we're
still in mad makeup,

256
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,167
And no one knows what
the fuck's going on.

257
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,302
It's 10:30?

258
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,303
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,971
It's 10:30, and
tomorrow's a big day.

260
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,406
What's happening out there?

261
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,242
Um, basically special
effects is five minutes away.

262
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,612
And then they have 10
minutes of work to do.

263
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,581
They're putting the final
touches on Toxie's arms.

264
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,282
Well, tell them,
so they get out

265
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,319
Of there when the actors come.

266
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,520
Let's get ready.

267
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,888
You got to tell your crew, too.
TRENT HAAGA: Yes.

268
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,790
That was if you got-- well,
how many minutes would you say?

269
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,191
TRENT HAAGA: I would say--
-Just tell them.

270
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,259
Tell them.

271
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,827
You got to say-- you
got to yell it out.

272
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:20,560
Eight minutes.

273
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,630
Six minutes.

274
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,997
All said, we got
about 10 more minutes

275
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,634
Till we'll have our actors on
set for a camera rehearsal.

276
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:27,434
OK?

277
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,268
MAN: Thank you.

278
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,302
Awesome.

279
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,804
I would like to be
shooting right now.

280
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,439
I can't believe that we're not.

281
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:37,177
I will always wait for makeup.

282
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,546
Yeah, did you get that?

283
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,949
INTERVIEWER: Yup.

284
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:42,750
You have revisions?

285
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,317
You have the pink sheets?

286
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,585
MAN: I gave them to [inaudible].

287
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,120
Well, why don't you
have them in your script?

288
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,289
MAN: No, that way
this rests for you.

289
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,457
You're the script boy, man.

290
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,592
Go get them.

291
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,460
Jesus Christ.

292
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,261
It's like Stupidville.

293
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,328
Seriously.

294
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,097
Geoff, did nobody
tell you how to do it?

295
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,432
You're supposed to
be following the text.

296
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,400
Right, I got--

297
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,168
So how are you gonna
follow it if you

298
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,235
Don't have the revisions?

299
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,637
This scene hasn't--

300
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,437
Doesn't matter.

301
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,272
You don't know that.

302
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,373
I'm made changes this morning.

303
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,174
Right.

304
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,541
Yeah, I need those.
-Go.

305
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:09,910
You've got to get-- yeah, well
you should be getting them.

306
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,711
You should get them.

307
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:11,645
Yep.

308
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,813
Shit, that's what
it's all about.

309
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,448
That's what the pink
papers are there for.

310
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,818
Go.

311
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,119
Trent, this is fucked up.

312
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,288
The script guy doesn't
have the revisions.

313
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,289
How is he gonna be script guy?

314
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,660
He doesn't have
them in his book.

315
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,929
He's got to be reading them
so that we don't fuck up this.

316
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,133
Someone's got to keep track
that we're doing the dialogue.

317
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,301
TRENT HAAGA: Could
you repeat that?

318
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,368
You should have them.

319
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,303
Everyone should have
the fucking scripts.

320
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,270
This was nuts.

321
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,908
I hope the actors have it.

322
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,910
WOMAN: All right, got my own.

323
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,913
We're gonna get out
there on toxic speed.

Hi, Toxic.

333
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,638
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, let's go.

334
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:12,840
Let's go.
Call it.

335
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,640
Let's go!

336
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:14,875
Start rehearsing!

337

Jesus Christ.

338
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:16,744
It's fucking 11 o'clock.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's go!

Let's go!

344
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,456
Do a master on the beautiful
lovemaking, fornicating.

345
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,959
And then we'll go into
the-- we'll cover it.

346
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:32,893
Then we'll cover it.

347
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,327
And then we'll
deal with the food.

348
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,796
INTERVIEWER: What's the
word of the morning?

349
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,464
There isn't one yet.

350
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,802
It's been too hairy
to have a word.

351
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:45,939
It's, uh-- I've been given
incorrect information,

352
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,040
So I've been late.

353
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,111
And ever since then,
it's all gone downhill.

354
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,479
OK, here we go.

355
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,347
Standing by.

356
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,684
This has to be the
most erotic scene

357
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:01,154
That has ever been filmed in the
history of man and womankind.

358
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,156
[Moan]

359
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,126
[Moaning]

360
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:11,899
Oh!

361
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,835
[Moaning]

362
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:18,772
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut!

363
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,742
We got the-- the
breast isn't coming

364
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,112
Off, which is why you should
always rehearse with costumes.

365
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,113
You should rehearse with them.

366
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,280
And I've been
saying it for weeks.

367
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,216
Rehearse with costumes.
'Cause now we're

368
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,083
Having a major problem.

369
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,018
We'll cut this thing down.

370
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:31,919
TRENT HAAGA: No,
I'm starting down.

371
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:32,886
I'm starting at off.
All right.

372
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:33,954
You know what I mean?
That's the--

373
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,188
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Well,
just tell her that.

374
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,256
TRENT HAAGA: Oh, yeah.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So she knows.

375
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:36,790
TRENT HAAGA: She knows.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK.

376
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,158
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,126
That's what you gotta do.

378
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,460
You've got to rehearse
with everything.

379
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,029
This is gonna be the bane
of this production is

380
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,596
That nothing's been looked at.

381
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,965
I've been saying
it for eight weeks.

382
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,333
I should've looked
at every effect.

383
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,500
I should've looked
at every costume.

384
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,169
Every scene should've
been rehearsed in costume.

385
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,905
You know, now we're
paying the penalty.

386
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,941
Keep your hand away from--
just pull the dress down.

387
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,142
Take your--
-[panting]

388
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,243
There you go.

389
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,978
OK, we'll continue it
from there, please.

390
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,981
But can you bring it-- can
you get out of that thing,

391
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,150
In terms of the-- just
pull the thing down.

392
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,284
All the way down?

393
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,518
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, get
your arm out of there.

394
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,087
Yeah, but I can't pull
it back up afterwards.

395
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,288
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
well, you will.

396
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,957
We'll cut, and you'll
have [inaudible].

397
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,291
To pull it back up.
-Yeah.

398
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,692
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Just
for this scene, so we--

399
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,626
Sure.

400
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,527
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.

401
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,096
So let's pick it up from here.

402
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,097
OK.

403
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,933
TRENT HAAGA: Uh,
bring your dress down.

404
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,002
Yeah, right to your underwear.

405
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:22,802
Thanks.

406
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,708
INTERVIEWER: So
Lloyd, how'd that go?

407
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,010
Uh, we're getting there.

408
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,344
It's starting to happen.

409
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,915
The magic, the true magic,
is slowly starting to happen.

410
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,349
Yeah.

411
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,218
CREW: 15, Charlie, Take one.

412
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,152
[Beep]

413
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:39,953
CREW: Mark it.
-Mark.

414
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:40,753
[Clap]

415
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,156
CREW: One second, please.

416
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,926
Holding, and ready, Lloyd.

417
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,327
Action.

418
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,531
[Gasp] [moaning]

419
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,333
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Right arm down.

420
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,468
Left arm back, Toxie.

421
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,269
[Moaning]

422
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,237
CREW: No, it's not--

423
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,738
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

424
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,840
When I tell you there's
noise, there's noise.

425
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:04,111
What you have to do is
you don't go to him.

426
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,145
You go to me.

427
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,779
I say there's too
much noise outside.

428
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,515
If your people are
making the noise,

429
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,716
You've got to lock up the set.

430
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:10,783
You've got to shut them up.

431
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:11,885
That's your job.

432
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,820
You don't go to Evan
and say, is it OK?

433
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,188
Because that's what
schlock is all about.

434
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,258
Schlock is accepting
noise on your soundtrack.

435
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,460
Now, we're gonna have plenty
of noise on the soundtrack.

436
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,995
And we're gonna accept
plenty of dogs barking.

437
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,231
But the PA's
yapping and slamming

438
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,399
Doors we don't have to accept.

439
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,908
I'm intending to perhaps
do it like "Toxic 1."

440
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,443
MAN: That's what I thought--
-But don't--

441
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,444
That's what I had in my mind.

442
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,811
But don't-- assume
we're using his.

443
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,047
Absolutely.
I'm assuming we are.

444
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,182
But, like, that's also
in the back of my mind.

445
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,550
[Inaudible] Toxie, too.

446
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:50,223
Trent, is Jesse standing by
with that, um, Bromo grain stuff

447
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,525
And the Rosco smoke machine?

448
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,494
Is somebody still getting
the Bromo-Seltzer?

449
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,996
Why don't we have
that Bromo-Seltzer?

450
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:56,964
I don't get it.

451
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,932
What, they don't
have Bromo-Seltzer?

452
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,433
That was two days ago.

453
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,102
We're doing a "Toxic
Avenger" movie.

454
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:02,902
Trent!

455
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:03,971
TRENT HAAGA: Yes, sir!

456
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,372
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Are
they still getting it?

457
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,406
TRENT HAAGA: Yeah.

458
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,174
CAT SARREAL: Yes,
they're coming back.

459
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:07,941
Yes, they are coming back.

460
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:08,741
With Bromo-Seltzer.

461
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:09,842
CAT SARREAL: Yes.

462
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,278
TRENT HAAGA: It better
not be Alka-Seltzer.

463
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:14,747
Where's the fucking
Jared, right?

464
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,949
Hey, Trent.

465
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,417
Having the PAs in the car
doesn't do you any good.

466
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,785
Where-- do they know
where they're going?

467
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,154
I told them just to
get green food coloring

468
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,522
And then Bromo-Seltzer.

469
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,791
I didn't tell them
what store to go to.

470
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,059
OK, well, that's
what you have to do.

471
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,128
See, that's why
I'm the director.

472
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,496
Where is Jared?

473
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,931
Let's get Jared here.

474
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,800
Let's have Jared come
to the set, I guess.

475
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,036
I don't know to get out of it.

476
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,638
This is a "Toxic Avenger" movie,
and we don't have any Bromo

477
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,041
And vegetable coloring.

478
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,343
Now, you guys should be telling
me what else we don't have,

479
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,279
When I make like a list
of-- each day, I should--

480
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,780
This is not good.

481
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,882
You should, like, give
me a-- like, tomorrow,

482
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:55,222
If we're not gonna have
guys heads getting squashed.

483
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,189
Ah, good.

484
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,524
All right.

485
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,027
Have it standing by with the
green vegetable dye, please.

486
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,496
[Chatter]

487
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,198
Now, we're gonna do
a shot at the end,

488
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,499
With the close-up
of Toxie, where

489
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,967
He's doing his Bromo and green.

490
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,802
TRENT HAAGA: All right.

491
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,104
Thank you.

492
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,106
Also, we're gonna need the
Bromo-Seltzer on this shot,

493
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,207
Folks, on this angle.

494
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,543
Just have all the Bromo
standing by, folks.

495
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,944
TRENT HAAGA: I got the Bromo.

496
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,080
OK, he's putting the
Bromo in everybody.

497
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,281
Let's--

498
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,550
But maybe take a shit load
so it forces itself out.

499
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,484
Take a lot more.

500
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,752
OK.

501
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,221
Take a huge amount, and
then it'll kind of force you.

502
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,557
You'll find that
it'll will almost--

503
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,325
It'll build up so you almost--

504
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,495
This is about
quantity, not quality.

505
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,429
MAN: That's self-evident.

506
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,299
MAN: Is it green?

507
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,833
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK,
everybody be quiet, please.

508
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:45,872
This is a very, very
difficult acting thing.

509
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:46,673
CREW: Toxie.

510
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,607
CREW: Yeah, ready.

511
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,008
CREW: Come a little bit closer.

512
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,510
LLOYD KAUFMAN: You better
turn the camera on!

513
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,444
CREW: Yeah, I've got it.
It's rolling.

514
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,812
It's OK.
Go for it.

515
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:53,946
Head up a little bit more.

516
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,382
Excellent, nice.

517
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,949
[Camera shutter clicking]

518
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,750
Yeah.

519
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,718
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Look up more.

520
00:16:58,818 --> 00:16:59,652
Head up more.

521
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,620
CREW: Excellent.

522
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,622
CREW: Oh, that's nice.

523
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,423
Cut.

524
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,491
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, good.

525
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,292
Beautiful.

526
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,259
Thank you.

527
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,060
Thank you.

528
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,161
Please clean up Toxie.

529
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,262
[Applause]

530
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,063
Bravo.

531
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,030
Thank you, Toxie.

532
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,132
TRENT HAAGA: You
are the screen's

533
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,433
Definition of beautiful, Lloyd.

534
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,835
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Well,
you are beautiful.

535
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,805
So are we going straight to
the kitchen shots after this?

536
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,173
I guess so.
Uh, no.

537
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:20,973
Actually, [belch]

538
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:21,941
Is there more?

539
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,443
Oh, oh, we're
doing the fantasy.

540
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,211
Yeah.

541
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,612
And then the--

542
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:31,050
(SINGING) It's all part
of my Fabio fantasy.

543
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:36,323
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So the idea is
to get-- you have Sarah's eyes

544
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,291
After they've just
had the huge orgasm.

545
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,927
And she says, "Toxie, the most
beautiful person in the world."

546
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:45,765
And then you cut, and there's a
close-up of-- instead of Toxie,

547
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,501
It's Joe Anthony.

548
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,470
What's the next scene?

549
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,972
TRENT HAAGA: Uh,
it's fucking Joseph

550
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,475
Anthony, Toxie fantasy guy.

551
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,479
[Slurping] Bad idea.

552
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,513
Really bad idea.

553
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,314
Yeah.

554
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,215
Stupid idea.

555
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,015
Yeah.

556
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,217
I mean, besides green vomit.

557
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,985
Uh-huh.

558
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,420
[Sigh]

559
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,888
[Inaudible].

560
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,857
[Slurping]

561
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,027
What the hell was that?

562
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,396
[Slurp]

563
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,297
Uh.

564
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,498
INTERVIEWER: So, big man.

565
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,569
What's up?

566
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,972
INTERVIEWER: Tell us
about your first morning

567
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,408
In a feature film.

568
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:29,942
As the lead?

569
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:30,910
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

570
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,711
Um.

571
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:39,152
It's been busy, very busy.

572
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,888
I have absolutely no idea
how it could be possibly

573
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,923
Be too something or near to.

574
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,163
INTERVIEWER: So it's
been very traumatic?

575
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,565
Oh, yeah. [slurp]

576
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,305
Yup.

577
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,172
Yes, indeed.

578
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,244
BRAM LEWIS: It was today?

579
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,412
Uh, today was good.

580
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,213
Day one.

581
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,347
Day one.

582
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,147
Pshew.

583
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,282
In the bag.

584
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,583
[Sigh]
-[sigh]

585
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:11,651
It was a little weird.

586
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,885
I'm still getting used to Lloyd.

587
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,853
But, uh--

588
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:18,024
--[laughs] And his
type of direction.

589
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,125
Yeah.

590
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:22,295
And his changing things,
like, all the time.

591
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,696
He's constantly changing.

592
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:28,100
And I had several guys
come up to me today

593
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,203
Afterwards and say, wow, man.

594
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,137
I knew you were big.

595
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,406
And I knew, you
know, you could do

596
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,907
The stick stuff
and all that stuff

597
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,776
And the stunt work and all that.

598
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,211
But I didn't know you could act.

599
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,178
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]

600
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,847
A bunch of people
were like, are you

601
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,215
An actor, like professionally?

602
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:46,586
And one guy came up and he
said, I've been a fan of Troma--

603
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,987
He's, like, you know,
20 or something.

604
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:51,291
He's like, I've been a fan of
Troma since I was, like, five.

605
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,293
And he said, I've
seen all the movies.

606
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,894
And you're the best Toxie ever.

607
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,828
Wow.

608
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,697
So that was cool to hear.

609
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,533
[Applause and cheering]

610
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,803
Yahoo.

611
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,805
I can't believe you're here.

612
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:10,910
Is there anything that's,
like, not-- just, I

613
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,980
Mean, your instinct
will guide you, period.

614
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,619
Is there anything that's,
like-- if there's anything

615
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,289
That you want to talk over
at any point, just, you know,

616
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,656
Don't hesitate.

617
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,191
Yeah.

618
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,859
Everything changes all the time.

619
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,996
So, um--

620
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,265
We're doing the
retarded school scene.

621
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,566
We got to keep it
on the low-down,

622
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,737
Because we're actually at a
school for special students.

623
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,706
So we don't want
to offend anyone.

624
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,374
MAN: (SARCASTICALLY)
I'm working here!

625
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,410
Don't make up the
special children.

626
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,446
They should look
sweaty and disgusting.

627
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:47,947
INTERVIEWER: So how
does it feel to actually

628
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,782
Be a part of a Troma movie?

629
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,883
Oh, it's incredible.

630
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:51,784
It's a dream come true.

631
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,753
I just hope I get killed.

632
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:54,754
ACTOR: Pretty smooth.

633
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,788
It's a little hot
and muggy in here.

634
00:20:55,888 --> 00:21:00,393
But, well, that's
filmmaking, I guess.

635
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,461
No big deal.

636
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,162
If you don't like
it, then you probably

637
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,263
Shouldn't be here, so--

638
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,264
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We're
shooting now, correct?

639
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,699
Yeah.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, come on.

640
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,500
Come on.
Let's go.

641
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,468
Let's go.
Hey!

642
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,202
There's a little
schmutz in the gate.

643
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,237
Can we do it again?

644
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,071
OK, all right.

645
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,506
Everybody back into position.

646
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,641
Did you clean it yet?

647
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,443
Have you cleaned it yet?

648
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:17,910
Yeah, I have.

649
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,646
And is it hot in here?

650
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:20,713
Let me ask you.

651
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,315
INTERVIEWER: I
think it's pretty--

652
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,550
DEBBIE ROCHON: There's no air.

653
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,453
I think the air-- we
finished using all of the air

654
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,987
Maybe three hours ago.

655
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,857
See this strip right here,
these blue lines right there?

656
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:31,991
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

657
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,427
Right, when you get the
diaper, they're yellow.

658
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,129
And then they're supposed to
turn blue as an indication

659
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,599
When you've urinated
in your diaper.

660
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,968
But I've also found out that
it turns blue if your testicles

661
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,670
Sweat excessively.

662
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,037
I guess we're working
up to the point

663
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,673
Where something really
bad is gonna happen.

664
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:47,540
MAN: Hold on.

665
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,441
Hold on.

666
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,876
Can you hold on, please?

667
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,544
I may have a little
technical problem.

668
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,445
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, hold on.

669
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,546
MAN: Hold on please.

670
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,881
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Don't
leave yet, folks, 'cause

671
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,483
We may have a camera problem.

672
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,318
OK, we are going to
break for one half hour

673
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,721
For lunch-- granted,
if the camera is OK.

674
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,556
If not, we'll retake
this last thing.

675
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,157
Ready, action!
ACTOR: Teach?

676
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,225
Teach?

677
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,628
What's the fucking
point in trying to teach

678
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,296
These soap heads, lady?

679
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,231
[Laughs]

680
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,134
[Chatter]

681
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,404
Get him!
Get him!

682
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,571
Cut!
Good.

683
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,572
OK, excellent.

684
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,440
Super, super.

685
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,240
Very good.

686
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,041
Bravo.

687
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,377
Terrific.

688
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,513
2 o'clock, and
we still-- maybe.

689
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:27,747
I don't now.

690
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,382
I thought we were not being
too ambitious for today.

691
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:34,721
MAN: Hey, what are we on?

692
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:35,522
Like, page two?

693
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:36,423
We have like eight.

694
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,757
Yeah, we're going very slowly.

695
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,758
It's been slow.

696
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:39,826
Everything is OK.

697
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:43,129
It's just we're a little
behind on the shots.

698
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,397
My actors are great.

699
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,264
They're sitting here.

700
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,098
They're being quiet.

701
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,199
They're getting it in one take.

702
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,136
It's just the set-ups
are so effing slow.

703
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,338
I can't stand it.

704
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,374
We'll never get eight
pages today at this rate.

705
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:59,479
There was this situation
where one of the diaper mafia

706
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:05,251
Spilt some milk all over my
face in a very sexual manner.

707
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,119
It was very disturbing.

708
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,322
Got milk, fucking retard?

709
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:18,965
LISA TEREZAKIS: It was very,
very, very similar to someone

710
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,433
Ejaculating all over me.

711
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,402
But it was a milk
bottle with milk.

712
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,403
Mommy!

713
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,905
Mommy!

714
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:31,844
Borderline, borderline pushing
the envelope, if you ask me.

715
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:35,214
But it was all in
the name of art.

716
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:39,686
[Chatter]

717
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,388
Hey, Zork, what's
going on, man?

718
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:45,525
INTERVIEWER: How is
day number two going?

719
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:51,764
It's exciting stuff, but I'm
really, uh-- what happened, Zo?

720
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,967
I got a call from
Gabe a couple days ago.

721
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,836
Oh, Gabe told you
to say it, huh?

722
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:57,770
That's what Lloyd told him.

723
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,872
Oh, Gabe lied to you, man.

724
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,674
But then I talked to
Pat, and Pat agreed.

725
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,775
Well, yeah.

726
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,143
They both-- Gabe and
Pat wants you to say.

727
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,077
Lloyd don't care.

728
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,679
He said it would
be better without.

729
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,981
People make decisions
without Lloyd around here.

730
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,082
That's what happens.

731
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,218
I'm good if you want
to put it back. [laughs]

732
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,185
I like it.

733
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:13,986
I like the look, man.

734
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,054
You look younger.

735
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,889
I just didn't want
to do the hair thing.

736
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,324
You know, only because
of growing out.

737
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:19,959
Something like these
things, which wash out,

738
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,530
But this, the dye
wouldn't wash out.

739
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,497
TRENT HAAGA: No, no.

740
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,465
And that's fundamentally
what it is, man.

741
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,935
Those guys-- this isn't
"Masters of Light."

742
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,604
It's about retarded
kids and guys

743
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,072
In diapers with machine guns.

744
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:36,976
It needn't have perfect
kick lights and whatever.

745
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,310
And we're back.

746
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,779
We're back from lunch.

747
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,213
Fuck this man.

748
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,148
I've had it.

749
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:46,385
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

750
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,286
It went soft.

751
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,420
MAN: Something went--

752
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,022
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah the
camera turned off, too.

753
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,858
INTERVIEWER: What's
happening right now?

754
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:56,428
They're having camera trouble,
so we're standing here.

755
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,866
This happens every
hundred thousand miles.

756
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:00,833
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, right.

757
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,668
OK.

758
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,770
It had to happen today, though.

759
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,771
MAN: What's up?

760
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:05,872
I don't know.

761
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:09,175
I've never heard or
seen this happen before.

762
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,643
I don't know.

763
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:11,711
It's one of the belts.

764
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,946
It's not working right.

765
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,948
It sounds like we
are quite fucked.

766
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:16,916
MAN: Don't do [inaudible].

767
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:17,917
INTERVIEWER: Right, yeah.

768
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:18,718
All right.

769
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,290
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I told everybody.

770
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,058
Keep all your acting
going, because it's

771
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,393
Very improvisational.

772
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:31,497
And we're sort of moving around,
since you never know when

773
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:32,999
The camera's gonna be on you.

774
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:39,438
So please keep up
the performance.

775
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,908
Hopefully, we will
have a camera.

776
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,816
No, I got a bit of a problem.

777
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,851
WOMAN: Do you know if we
can use the other one?

778
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,285
Yeah, we can use
this other one.

779
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,754
It's noisy, though.

780
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,222
But that's the option right now.

781
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,189
We're fucked.

782
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,125
It could be the end of the film.

783
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,560
INTERVIEWER: Why?

784
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:04,631
Can't do it without a camera.

785
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,066
Can't shoot it
all without sound,

786
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,135
Unless we do a silent movie.

787
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,537
What do we do?

788
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:15,041
I made arrangements
for somebody to pick up

789
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,375
Another body in New York City.

790
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:18,110
Can you send somebody from
your office to go down there?

791
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,679
-Oh, my god.
-So it's-- yeah.

792
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,813
We're fucked.

793
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,514
I mean, I'm gonna work
on the camera myself.

794
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,750
Yeah.

795
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,251
But I want to make this
arrangement before something

796
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,252
Closes for Labor Day.

797
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,053
Yeah.

798
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,325
Unless Brendan fixes
the camera, we'll be MOS.

799
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,828
And then there's another camera
body coming from New York.

800
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,296
Wow.

801
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,665
Let's just keep
going with the scene.

802
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,500
We'll get as much of the scene
as we can without dialogue.

803
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,869
CREW: Rolling?

804
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:43,903
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Roll.

805
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:44,871
Action lighting.

806
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,740
[Camera whirring]

807
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,175
Cut.

808
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,142
Fuck it.

809
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:53,012
It's absolutely fucked up.

810
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:53,946
Totally fucked.

811
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:54,947
All right.

812
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,884
Come back.

813
00:26:57,984 --> 00:26:59,986
It's just this-- it's very wide.

814
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,696
My head hurts.

815
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,397
It really, really hurts.

816
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:12,665
INTERVIEWER: Why does it hurt?

817
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:13,532
What happened to you?

818
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,703
I was assaulted by a breast.

819
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,037
Belladonna will push
her out of the way

820
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,207
And flap her with her heavies.

821
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,709
Does Belladonna know that?

822
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,810
TRENT HAAGA: Yes, I--

823
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,177
Why don't you go and
just tell Belladonna?

824
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,947
Go in the back and tell
her what to do, please.

825
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,749
So he wants you to do
redo your entire film.

826
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,617
We're gonna [inaudible]
poor, little retarded--

827
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,485
Is that all I am
is a pair of tits?

828
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,653
No.

829
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,522
We'll get your face
in there somehow.

830
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:37,790
[Laughs]

831
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,791
Yeah, yeah.

832
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:44,330
LLOYD KAUFMAN: And run through.

833
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,131
Action.

834
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,804
That's it, good.

835
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:52,705
OK, perfect.

836
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:53,505
All right.

837
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,606
Do a still take.

838
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:57,009
[Chatter]

839
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,077
This is art, man.

840
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,812
This is truly fucking art.

841
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,647
It is definitely a Troma day.

842
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:04,050
TJ knows this is art, man.

843
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,251
I didn't think it would hurt.

844
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,753
But then I thought, well,
that was the last time.

845
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,888
And then it happened again,
but it was even more painful.

846
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,824
So when you see-- if it's
on the film-- my face,

847
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:12,925
That's not acting.

848
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:13,726
That was real.

849
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:14,794
I was in pain.

850
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:32,111
Nobody's been trained in breast
combat before, I don't think.

851
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,446
So they didn't know
how to fake it.

852
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,648
And the girl just went sick.

853
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:39,318
I mean, I had a
headache the whole day.

854
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,119
She was just sick.

855
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,188
She was, like, going sick.

856
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,589
I don't know.

857
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:46,692
Letting out some steam, I guess,
some frustration or something.

858
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,627
[Panting]

859
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,397
What's the word of the morning?

860
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,900
Um, ugh.

861
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,834
[Grumble]

862
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,070
INTERVIEWER: So what's
been happening on set?

863
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:58,905
I'm not happy.

864
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,506
INTERVIEWER: Why?

865
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,208
I don't mind working hard.

866
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,910
I don't mind the long hours.

867
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,513
I don't mind, you know,
sitting in the hot room

868
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:10,216
With people who don't know
what the hell they're doing.

869
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,618
They keep doing the same
thing over and over again.

870
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:14,086
How about, like, invest
a little more money

871
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:14,954
And get a second camera?

872
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:15,754
Hello?

873
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,456
INTERVIEWER: Right.

874
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,959
I mean, I wasn't
born yesterday.

875
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:22,628
And this just looks
like-- well, you guys have

876
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:23,762
Been around for a long time.

877
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,631
What's going on, man?

878
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,866
INTERVIEWER: I'm not--

879
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,835
Take some of that money
you made from the past films

880
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:29,902
Or whatever.

881
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,403
And I'm sure they're
raking in the dough.

882
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,773
Take some of it and reinvest
it in a better production,

883
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,844
And maybe you'll get
a better product.

884
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:40,446
Maybe somebody will start
taking you seriously.

885
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,381
Because, you know,
half the people I asked

886
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,649
Have never heard of Troma.

887
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,118
I don't want another
part that involves me

888
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,519
Beating people up with my tits.

889
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:52,258
I mean, I can do that in
the stuff that I've done,

890
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:53,059
Which pays.

891
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,360
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

892
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,095
I mean, this is almost like
the pornos that I've done,

893
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,330
Which is mostly girl-girl
and fetish and S&M

894
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,799
Stuff, which pays
really, really good

895
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,234
And is really, really easy.

896
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,403
I've already had this
kind of exposure.

897
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,974
I wanted some legitimate, like,
acting exposure, you know.

898
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,676
And now the whole world
knows me as this ditzy bimbo

899
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,578
Who can't act.

900
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,712
And I can act.

901
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,114
They didn't ask me
to have a monologue.

902
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,516
They just asked me to come in,
and be myself, and do my thing,

903
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,751
And do what I do, whatever.

904
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,854
And I did a little striptease.

905
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:24,690
And I jumped on one of the
guys who was on the couch,

906
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,525
And I beat him up with my tits.
INTERVIEWER: Right.

907
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,160
And that was just
something that came to mind.

908
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,063
I figured let me shock
them a little bit.

909
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,865
There's not much
else I could say.

910
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,735
Lloyd just treats me like
a dumb bimbo, and I'm not.

911
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,737
And my feelings are hurt.

912
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,707
And I don't think I'm
coming back, so there.

913
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,180
INTERVIEWER: So what
happened with the--

914
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,016
What's up with the
status of the camera now?

915
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:51,250
Yeah, yeah.

916
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,485
We got the new camera
brought in and set up here.

917
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,822
And it's right here, big
and beautiful, ready to go.

918
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:57,957
Hey, there.

919
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,026
INTERVIEWER: What's the
word of the day so far?

920
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:03,829
Word of the day is relaxed.

921
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,998
I had the day off yesterday,
and I enjoyed that.

922
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:09,168
And they don't need
me for a while yet,

923
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:11,737
So we took a really long
time to get the makeup on.

924
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:14,106
Just took our time,
no rush, no fuss.

925
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,609
Nobody continually coming
in to see what was going on

926
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,345
And how soon it would be
done and all that stuff.

927
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:20,679
So it was cool.

928
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:21,780
INTERVIEWER: A little bit
different than day number one,

929
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,581
Eh?

930
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:23,749
Very different, yeah.

931
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,851
Can we just like put
the squibs at some point?

932
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,255
And then have-- just like sort
of put them back in the scene,

933
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,957
And just leave them on
there for a little while?

934
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,024
No.

935
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,659
You've got to just
put them on and do it?

936
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,860
OK.

937
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:39,231
I mean, you have one shirt
of each for each person?

938
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,732
No, we have more.

939
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,733
You have one extra.

940
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,970
Right now we have
one extra shirt.

941
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,770
One extra shirt.

942
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,072
Total.

943
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:48,307
Like, we have all
of these people--

944
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,543
You have one total
shirt, or one extra shirt?

945
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:52,378
I'm sorry.

946
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:53,445
These are all the shirts, right?

947
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,280
Uh-huh.

948
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,747
MAN: That equals five shirts.

949
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,218
I have one more
that's not being used

950
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,219
By a character in the scene.

951
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,420
CRAIG: You mean one
for each person?

952
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,221
No.

953
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,189
Just one more shirt.

954
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:03,990
Yeah.

955
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,324
Then we can't do it.

956
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,825
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Can I have
someone slightly intelligent?

957
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,028
They can go to
some store to buy--

958
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:10,162
I mean, here's the deal, man.

959
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,498
We don't need them to
be the exact same shade.

960
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,066
We don't care, as
long as they're green

961
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,701
And they got loops and
you can iron some shit on.

962
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:16,702
I don't know.

963
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,037
Is Nives dressing
people right now?

964
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,405
No, she's not, man.

965
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:20,206
I need her to fucking--

966
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,240
She's dyeing shirts right now.

967
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,141
She's dyeing.

968
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:23,242
Oh, man.

969
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:24,776
They're going to have
to dry those shirts.

970
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,046
We need them today, you know?

971
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:27,980
45 minutes.

972
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,015
And we need them
sooner than that.

973
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,317
We literally have
to go to any store.

974
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,152
You have to ask yourself
what's more important,

975
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,754
Like guarding our equipment
or sending out green shirts?

976
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,189
I'm sorry.

977
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,091
We're working the best I
can, we just don't have

978
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,426
The fucking people to do it.

979
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,627
We can have extras do it.

980
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,730
That might be a good idea.

981
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,833
Are we going to
be able to shoot?

982
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,502
You have six shirts.

983
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,603
Because you remember--

984
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,605
We still be able to
wardrobe the classroom

985
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,874
After the squibbing?

986
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,743
Once the shirts back, I just
have to put on some type.

987
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:58,777
And then--

988
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,046
Now, who went to get
the shirts? 'Cause

989
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:02,281
It seems like they went,
like, four or five hours ago.

990
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,149
No, they came back.

991
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:04,350
They couldn't find them.

992
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,884
And then they came back
and asked them what to do.

993
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,919
And I told them to
get white shirts

994
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,221
And I would just dye
them, because it's

995
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,122
Just a dunk in green.

996
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:11,423
That's all it is.

997
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:12,991
And then just stick them in
a dryer, and they're done.

998
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,226
Who did you send?

999
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,194
How long ago?

1000
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,128
Two PAs.

1001
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,363
They probably left
20 minutes ago.

1002
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:18,330
They should be back any minute.
-Oh, it's hopeless.

1003
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,198
OK.
NIEVES: OK?

1004
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:20,866
It's hopeless.

1005
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:24,403
INTERVIEWER: So what's just--
what are you doing right now?

1006
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,472
The shirts that we
bought originally

1007
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:27,873
Had blue collars on them.

1008
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,441
But we can't find
those shirts again.

1009
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,378
So now we have to
paint the blue rings

1010
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,047
Around the collars and stuff.

1011
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,215
INTERVIEWER: Is that fun?

1012
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,349
No.

1013
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,985
But the squibs are
condoms filled with blood

1014
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:43,422
With a protective padding
to protect the skin,

1015
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,057
And a explosive on
top of the padding.

1016
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:48,760
Then the shirt is
scored and glued back

1017
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,296
Together what toilet paper.

1018
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,531
It's an electric wire
goes out the back.

1019
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,467
You hook it up to a
battery-powered thing,

1020
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,035
Press a button, and bam.

1021
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:57,836
[Chatter]

1022
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,271
Who needs squibs?

1023
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,672
You, you, you.

1024
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,640
You need a squib?

1025
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,574
Yeah.

1026
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,009
The squibs are 10 minutes off.

1027
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,477
There still are no green shirts.

1028
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:09,081
And so-- but the
squibs-- so I think

1029
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,649
By the time you finish
wacking in the balls,

1030
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,884
Then we'll be ready for squibs.

1031
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,820
You know, we're just
on the third day,

1032
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,423
Too, so I'm reserving judgment.

1033
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:22,094
But it's definitely-- it's
a little-- little fucked up.

1034
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:25,631
If you're on props, have
the props already there.

1035
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,033
If we're shooting something,
have everything there.

1036
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,968
If it's costumes, they're there.

1037
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,203
Props, they're there.

1038
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,339
Whatever it is, try to think
ahead and have it there.

1039
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,740
TRENT HAAGA: OK, everybody's--

1040
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,743
We shouldn't have to remember
there's a stick in the scene.

1041
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,679
You guys should be
ahead of the game.

1042
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,582
Please be ahead of the game.

1043
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,083
Same with the actors.

1044
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:47,819
The AD department should
have the bloody actors here.

1045
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,754
OK.

1046
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:49,721
Let's run the--

1047
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,789
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We're
filming, right?

1048
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,124
We shouldn't-- how
are we gonna remember?

1049
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:55,594
And script boy, script
boy, please remember this.

1050
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,164
Tell us you're
missing assistants.

1051
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,098
You're missing the stick.

1052
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,000
And whatever it is
you're missing, tell us.

1053
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,968
OK, Geoff?
So--

1054
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,336
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We've been doing
-OK.

1055
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,404
This is the third day.

1056
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,606
And it's the same--
we are not learning.

1057
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,574
We are not learning.

1058
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:09,575
We're not getting better.

1059
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:10,542
We're not getting better.

1060
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,710
We should get better.

1061
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,978
TRENT HAAGA: We're trying
to speed up, though.

1062
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,446
We got everything.
We have all our props.

1063
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:15,414
We should be thinking ahead.

1064
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:16,415
We are not thinking ahead.

1065
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:17,583
TRENT HAAGA: OK.

1066
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,851
Now, for example, is
there not gonna be blood?

1067
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,353
Is the blood boy
here with the blood?

1068
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,554
There's no blood yet, Lloyd.

1069
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,156
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Well, there
may be blood, though.

1070
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,123
Think ahead.

1071
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:25,991
Have it standing
by so we don't have

1072
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,593
To stop and ask for the blood.

1073
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:28,760
TRENT HAAGA: Everyone
in the room--

1074
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,262
Think ahead.
That's all I'm suggesting.

1075
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,963
You are absolutely
right, Lloyd.

1076
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,499
Can we do the take?
Can we rehearse?

1077
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,566
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yes.
-Thank you.

1078
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:35,033
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Rehearse
it in slow motion.

1079
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:35,967
OK.

1080
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,103
Trent-- Trent and
I will survive.

1081
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:40,406
The rest will go down in flames.

1082
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:41,407
About that classroom scene--

1083
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:42,874
So it's up to you.

1084
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,276
Whatever you want to do.

1085
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,812
Just get out of here and go do
some shots and clear your head.

1086
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:47,979
All right.

1087
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,748
--[inaudible] you're
starting to crack up, man.

1088
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:50,949
You're out of control.

1089
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:51,750
TRENT HAAGA: I got to just
get out of this diaper.

1090
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,851
Change your fucking diaper.

1091
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,119
TRENT HAAGA: Let me
get out of this diaper.

1092
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,021
I mean, by and large, people
who work here are idiots.

1093
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,923
And you can't complain about
it, because all you're doing

1094
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:01,527
Is complaining to the
same idiots, you know?

1095
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:02,328
INTERVIEWER: Lloyd.

1096
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,462
Yo.

1097
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,096
INTERVIEWER: What's the
word of the day so far?

1098
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:06,898
It's a total waste,
that's what that it is.

1099
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,167
We said if we have a
squib man and a gun

1100
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:12,971
Man who get thousands of
dollars, and the day is over.

1101
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:16,308
So we've wasted a lot
of times, and they're

1102
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,443
Being paid for all that time.

1103
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,010
And we haven't done one
squib or one bullet.

1104
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,680
So it's totally fucked up.

1105
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,814
It's very fucked up.

1106
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,485
Now we're in
[inaudible] total, you

1107
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:30,021
Know-- I hate to use the word
stupidity, but it's stupidity.

1108
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,323
Incompetence, maybe
that's better.

1109
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:34,960
Stupidity, sloth.

1110
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,063
INTERVIEWER: And what's your
other problem this morning?

1111
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,665
Yo.

1112
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:40,766
OK, squibs are ready.

1113
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,601
So we'll do it right
after this shot.

1114
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,135
Maybe we should rehearse it.

1115
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,604
There's nothing to rehearse.

1116
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,205
The stunt man'll
come in and do it.

1117
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:48,440
MAN: Let's rehearse
the cues, please.

1118
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,875
The rehearsal only.

1119
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,343
LLOYD KAUFMAN: And action.

1120
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,282
You're so--

1121
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:57,182
LLOYD KAUFMAN: [inaudible].

1122
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,888
Blood.

1123
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:03,689
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

1124
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:04,956
OK, cool.

1125
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,858
There will be fire number
one, then fire number two.

1126
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,660
OK, meanwhile, you keep
those things going.

1127
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,695
Standing by.

1128
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,563
First action, then duck.

1129
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,598
Then fire one.

1130
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:13,732
Ready?

1131
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:14,866
OK, I'm rolling camera.

1132
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:15,901
WOMAN: And we're rolling.

1133
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,903
BRENDAN FLYNT: And speed.

1134
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,372
Roll camera B, please.

1135
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,172
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Roll B.

1136
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:21,973
BRENDAN FLYNT: B!

1137
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:22,941
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action.

1138
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:23,909
Action!

1139
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,844
Duck!

1140
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:26,645
Duck.

1141
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,646
Fire one.

1142
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,615
[Gunshots]

1143
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:36,121
BRENDAN FLYNT: Oh,
so B is-- back up.

1144
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,122
Back up.

1145
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,290
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Fire two-- oh, cut.

1146
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,591
MAN: Cut!
Cut!

1147
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,592

1148
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,193
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Fire two!

1150
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,095
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

1151
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,298
Good, OK.

1152
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,098
[Clapping]

1153
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,100
It looked good, bravo.

1154
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,070
[Applause]

1155
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,448
LLOYD KAUFMAN: But he wasn't
supposed to fall down.

1156
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:04,383
He was supposed to
wait for [inaudible].

1157
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,651
BRENDAN FLYNT: If
he falls down--

1158
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:06,785
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So
you got nothing?

1159
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:07,886
BRENDAN FLYNT: The cut.

1160
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,187
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So you
didn't get anything?

1161
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,122
TRENT HAAGA: You got
it, right, Lloyd?

1162
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,558
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I got it.
MAN: Yeah, you got it.

1163
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:13,692
TRENT HAAGA: All right, well.

1164
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,527
MAN: We were waiting the
fire number two, right?

1165
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,595
-Yeah, that's right.
-Yeah.

1166
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:17,763
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
'Cause he went down.

1167
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,130
He shouldn't have gone.
He didn't listen.

1168
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,366
MAN: But then you
yelled cut, Lloyd.

1169
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,167
You guys did not listen.
[inaudible] fire number two.

1170
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,402
MAN: Lloyd.

1171
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,004
--thing to fire.

1172
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,105
MAN: Well, 'cause
he didn't feel--

1173
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,274
I don't know what he did.

1174
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,809
It's pretty funky.

1175
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,545
Silly German guy fell
too soon, you know?

1176
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,648
That's why they don't make many
movies in Germany, I guess.

1177
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,116
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Listen
for your number.

1178
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,986
[Chatter]

1179
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,153

-Whoa, whoa.

1180
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,355
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh, I'm sorry.
Blood.

1181
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,155

1183
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,024
MAN: OK.

1184
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,426
We're ready.

1185
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,561
BRENDAN FLYNT: OK, I'm rolling
camera A, and I've got speed.

1186
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,596
MAN: Run camera B.

1187
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,564

00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,232

1193
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,780
Cut.

[Chatter]

1195
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:13,151
INTERVIEWER: What's
been happening here?

1196
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,285
We're getting shot.

1197
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:16,655
But they're just plastic
bullets and shattering.

1198
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:17,589
It's just plastic.

1199
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:18,490
Only at 130 miles an hour.

1200
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,559
It's not gonna hurt us.

1201
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,060
It's like embedded in my skin.

1202
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,328
Do you want to see?

1203
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,664
I have two pieces of clothing
on, and it hit my arm.

1204
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:26,465
Really gross.

1205
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,400
Look, look-- this crap.

1206
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,501
Look at this.

1207
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,368
Look at that.

1208
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:31,770
It hurts.
It hurts.

1209
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,904
It hurts bad.

1210
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,240
INTERVIEWER: So what's
on the slate for today?

1211
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,642
Waiting till they need me.

1212
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,744
INTERVIEWER: And then what?

1213
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,378
That I don't know.

1214
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,480
I go by the call sheet.

1215
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,485
First thing I'm
officially listed for

1216
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:49,354
Is a scene I'm not in.

1217
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:54,025
So we'll see what's
up with that.

1218
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,062
And if we skip that scene, the
next scene that I'm officially

1219
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,197
Listed for is at 7:00 PM, so.

1220
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:04,302
I got here at 6:30 AM, and
it's quarter after 12:00.

1221
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,239
Do you know how much it costs
to get a fucking handgun?

1222
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,475
It's 200 bucks.

1223
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,976
And you got to pay some guy
to come and fucking show

1224
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,344
You how to use it.

INTERVIEWER: Mr. Wilkeban?

1226
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,047
No, not Wilkeban.

1227
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,883
This guy's name
is Rick Washburn.

1228
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:18,817
INTERVIEWER: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1229
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,019
I think he changed
it from Dick.

1230
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,157
But he-- he and I don't
get along too well.

1231
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,093
We have the best gun
guy and the best guns.

1232
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:32,063
But unfortunately, we
could only afford one day.

1233
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:37,035
We had our first major,
major effects scene today,

1234
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,904
And it was a shooting.

1235
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:43,308
And it was fucked up by the guy
who brought the guns, the guy

1236
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,810
Who brought the firing guns.

1237
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,678
And it was one of these guys
that Lloyd has always said,

1238
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:47,479
He's so professional.

1239
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,480
And he's so good.

1240
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,915
And blah, blah, blah, you know.

1241
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,751
But Rick Washburn did
a very-- he's the best.

1242
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,987
He did "Troma's War" and came
up with some great ideas.

1243
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,957
Fucking winds up
totally wasting our time

1244
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,359
And our film and our
fucking-- half our day

1245
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,794
With just dicking
around, you know,

1246
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:05,997
And taking up our valuable,
like, cars and shit

1247
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,566
Like that, to pick him up.

1248
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,969
So you see, Washburn's day
started at-- to be picked up

1249
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:14,005
At-- I think he was supposed
to be picked up at 8:00

1250
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:14,973
Or something.

1251
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,207
So we started
paying him at 8:00.

1252
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,375
I guess.
Or 6:00.

1253
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,209
I don't know.

1254
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,144
Whenever they gave him the call.

1255
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:20,378
I mean, he didn't
show up on time.

1256
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,613
They sent the wrong car.

1257
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:24,315
They sent a car that
didn't-- he and his assistant

1258
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,250
And the things wouldn't fit.

1259
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,384
That fucking guy.

1260
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,186
When John picked him up,
his car was too small

1261
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,655
For two guys and a gun.

1262
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:31,623
Big enough for
one guy and a gun,

1263
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,559
But not for two guys and a gun.

1264
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,026
Why do they need two guys?

1265
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,695
I don't know.

1266
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:39,497
Because he had to
bring his fucking kid.

1267
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:42,701
He brought his fucking kid to
the thing, to a Troma movie.

1268
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,335
Then they sent another car.

1269
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,771
Aha.

1270
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:48,640
So now he's pretty
much-- his day is over.

1271
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,508
And is he en route?

1272
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,810
-I don't know.
-Or is he back in New York?

1273
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,311
My guess is that
he will get here,

1274
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,047
And then it will
be time to go home.

1275
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:59,951
His day is over. [inaudible]
been ready since 6:00.

1276
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,487
So when he gets here,
his day will be over.

1277
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:03,989
So you have to send him back.
-All right.

1278
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:04,890
Lloyd?

1279
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,257
MAN: This is their position.

1280
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,827
What you may want to do is--
you said you want to do four,

1281
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,028
And then shoot [inaudible].

1282
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:10,996
That's right.

1283
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:11,997
MAN: OK, so--

1284
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,364
TRENT HAAGA: Come here.

1285
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,333
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So we'll have
two a little bit off to the side

1286
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,434
And four in the center.

1287
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,636
INTERVIEWER: What's the deal?

1288
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:18,436
Dude.

1289
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,540
I don't know how to
deal with him sometimes.

1290
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:57,042
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's try this.

1291
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,276
A big mess.

1292
00:42:58,376 --> 00:42:59,577
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Brendan,
how much time do you think?

1293
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:02,814
Both physically and mentally,
it's been a big mess.

1294
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,916
INTERVIEWER: Is this the first
time you've been involved

1295
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:07,485
In such a traumatic experience?

1296
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,355
Um, as far as Troma, yes.

1297
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:13,291
This is the first time I've
been involved with Troma,

1298
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:18,396
As far as working on sets now.

1299
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:19,698
I'm probably like
the worst person

1300
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:20,732
To be talking to right now.

1301
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,601
My brain is completely dead.

1302
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:27,906
INTERVIEWER: How does Troma
compare with normal production?

1303
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:28,740
No comment.

1304
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,541
No comment.

1305
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,010
INTERVIEWER: Hey, Rick Washburn.

1306
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,411
Hey, Lloyd, how you doing?
LLOYD KAUFMAN: How you doing?

1307
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:34,345
Welcome.

1308
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,313
This is Rick
Washburn, everybody.

1309
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,015
[Cheering]

1310
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,016
You have to listen.

1311
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,651
You have to follow instructions.

1312
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:43,354
What we're going to do with
these weapons can be dangerous.

1313
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,456
We're going to keep it
from being dangerous.

1314
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,594
And that means you pay attention
and you listen to what I say.

1315
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:54,232
Blanks can hurt you
at very close range.

1316
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:57,535
Safety's number one
in these scenes.

1317
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,339
When you hear "cut," whoever has
a gun, put the gun in the air.

1318
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,708
Stay where you are.

1319
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,643
I will come to you, and we'll
prepare for the next scene.

1320
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:08,680
Does anybody have
any questions at all?

1321
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,480
OK.

1322
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,849
Something to add, Rick.

1323
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,517
If you have one
of the guns which

1324
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:15,353
Are not Rick's, treat them
exactly the same as Rick's.

1325
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:17,989
When cut happens, they
also go in the air,

1326
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,058
So every gun in the
room is in the air,

1327
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,960
Just so there's no
confusion with anybody else.

1328
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,562
The gun we'll be firing
will be an M60 machine gun.

1329
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,164
It's belt fed.

1330
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:28,233
Word of today?

1331
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,300
Let's see.

1332
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,539
I have on-- the sound
guy has ear plugs

1333
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:41,012
That have been cut in half,
for a big, huge M60 machine

1334
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,748
Gun that he has to listen
to through a high-power

1335
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,249
Microphone.

1336
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,417
I think the word for
today is "cheap."

1337
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,387
[Chatter]

1338
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,689
OK, everybody ready?

1339
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,926
Fire in the hole.

1340
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,027
[Gunshots]

1341
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:56,862
MAN: OK.

1342
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:58,864
That's what you're gonna get.

1343
00:44:58,964 --> 00:44:59,865
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do everything--

1344
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,266
What's that?

1345
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,435
They're gonna shoot an M60 at a
kid and hopefully not kill him.

1346
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,671
As a matter of fact, as
soon as you pass his plane

1347
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:07,705
And he's down, stop firing.

1348
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,340
MAN: I'm not going
up against the wall.

1349
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,408
RICK WASHBURN: Oh, whoa, whoa.

1350
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,209
Do you see?

1351
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:13,044
We can't do this, guys.

1352
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:13,879
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hold it.

1353
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:14,880
I thought you were going down.

1354
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,314
MAN: I'm going against the wall.

1355
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:17,415
That's what they told me.

1356
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:18,750
RICK WASHBURN: Well,
OK, who told you that?

1357
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,953
MAN: Uh, the effects guy and
me, we choreographed that--

1358
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,488
All right, here's
what we have to do.

1359
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:25,556
We have to choreograph together.

1360
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,293
You guys can't come in
choreographed by yourselves.

1361
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,995
We just told him that
he was gonna go down

1362
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:31,096
And we were sweeping across.

1363
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:33,498
If you come behind and
tell him to stand up

1364
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:34,900
And I don't know
about it, he's gonna

1365
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,835
Shoot him right in the chest.

1366
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,736
We cannot do that in
this kind of thing.

1367
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:40,538
We have to work together.

1368
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,140
INTERVIEWER: Is
Troma well-insured?

1369
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,409
Oh, yeah.

1370
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,912
But this poor
bastard has no idea.

1371
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:50,615
They just said-- the gun guy
just said if he does this,

1372
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,217
He's gonna get his
brains blown out.

1373
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,185

roll your camera, please.

1375
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:57,655
RICK WASHBURN: Hold
the gun steady.

1376
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,723

00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,875
Get out.

1401
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,709
BRENDAN FLYNT: OK, rolling
camera B. Roll camera, Lloyd.

1402
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,844
MAN: Rolling.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Rolling.

1403
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:53,945
MAN: Speed, ready.
Rick.

1404
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:54,846
MAN: And action!

1405
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:56,347
[Gunfire]

1406
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:00,085
RICK WASHBURN: Cut.

1407
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:01,786
Yeah, but you got a
lot more [inaudible].

1408
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,895
INTERVIEWER: Did you have
a near death experience

1409
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:12,130
When you actually-- did
your life flash in front

1410
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,531
Of your eyes or anything?

1411
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,566
It didn't flash in front of
me, but I almost shit my pants.

1412
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,335
I mean, the gun was
pretty fu-- well,

1413
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:18,403
Like I can say "fucking," right?

1414
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:19,637
It was pretty fucking loud.

1415
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:22,507
I mean, even with the ear plugs.

1416
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,210
And then they sort of scared me,
saying, like, that the gun was

1417
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,544
Gonna blow, like,
air really hard,

1418
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:27,812
So I had to drop really quickly.

1419
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:30,748
And so I got my ass on the
floor as quick as possible

1420
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,782
When that gun started shooting.

1421
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:34,185
And the squib exploded
on me and blew

1422
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:35,620
The blood out from both sides.

1423
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,223
And I just dropped as
soon as that happened.

1424
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:41,192
So I didn't have a near-death
experience, but I sure as hell

1425
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:41,993
Was frightened.

1426
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:42,961
MAN: Camera B's rolling.

1427
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:43,761
Ready.

1428
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:44,930
RICK WASHBURN: And action!

1429
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,397
[Gunfire]

1430
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:47,865
Jammed?

1431
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,000
That time I had it.
Sorry.

1432
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:49,800
RICK WASHBURN: Cut.

1433
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,169
I saw [inaudible].

1434
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:53,604
See how you pulled
back on the belt?

1435
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,405
I did?

1436
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:55,706
Yeah.

1437
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,142
LLOYD KAUFMAN: You need time
[inaudible] you get back.

1438
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:58,376
I think it's the
way he's feeding

1439
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:00,011
The belt. Let me try something.

1440
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:03,314
The problem is that
we paid this guy

1441
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,751
A lot of money to do something,
and he didn't fucking do it.

1442
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:12,157
The M60 we rented fired three
to five rounds at a time max.

1443
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:14,459
I think the best one
we got was maybe 10.

1444
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,127
MAN: Gun up, please.

1445
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,095
And I'm ready.

1446
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:17,895
Go ahead.

1447
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:20,365
[Gunfire]

1448
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:21,866
OK?

1449
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,834
RICK WASHBURN:
That's all we got.

1450
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:26,071
And then the worst part,
the most galling part of all,

1451
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:28,906
Was when he says to me, like, I
won't charge you for the time I

1452
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:30,641
Spent fixing the gun.

1453
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,377
He showed up with a
malfunctioning weapon.

1454
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:33,678
You know what I mean?

1455
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:36,681
And I don't know what to--
I didn't know what to say.

1456
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,083
I was so pissed off.

1457
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:40,451
I basically said, well, OK, then
I won't charge you for the film

1458
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:41,419
That you wasted.

1459
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,321
Never had one of
those break before.

1460
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,489
TRENT HAAGA: Man,
things were going

1461
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:47,525
Really well until that
gun started to fuck up.

1462
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,094
OK.

1463
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:50,728
We had a little
trouble with the M60,

1464
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:51,796
But we cleared it up at the end.

1465
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:53,298
They got all the
shots they needed,

1466
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:54,365
And that's the important thing.

1467
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:55,666
And they got them
within the time limit

1468
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,667
Within the budget we needed.

1469
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,103
So I guess that's
the bottom line.

1470
00:48:58,203 --> 00:48:59,070
And action!

1471
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,538
[Gunfire]

1472
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:01,506
[Screaming]

1473
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,376
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

1474
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:06,611
[Chatter]

1475
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:07,812
RICK WASHBURN: You
shot the belt up.

1476
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:08,779
I figured out the problem.

1477
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,248
No.

1478
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:12,050
RICK WASHBURN: It will
break at some time.

1479
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,551
Of course, if it breaks
at the wrong time,

1480
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:16,154
Then you're stuck with that
kind of cost to the film.

1481
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,056
Fucking Rick Washburn, man.

1482
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:21,026
This is where someone like
myself, a weapons coordinator,

1483
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,893
Really earns their money.

1484
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:25,063
Fucking assload of money,
you know what I mean?

1485
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:26,831
Because we can fix
something on the set

1486
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,166
And keep it running
when normally,

1487
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,767
We'd just be down for the day.

1488
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:33,571
You're paying an arm and a
leg to do this bullshit job--

1489
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,541
What I did do was we had
an actuator handle break.

1490
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,343
--that a fucking
monkey can do--

1491
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:39,877
So I took one off
the fake gun, which

1492
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,013
Happened to be the real
part, and swapped it

1493
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,314
With the one on the other gun.

1494
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:45,216
--that they teach
idiots to do in the army.

1495
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,784
Then it seemed like we
were having a little bit

1496
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:48,353
Of pressure problems,
probably because we're

1497
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:49,520
Close to the sea level.

1498
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,821
Clean a fucking gun.

1499
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,324
So I overpressured the gun
just a little bit by putting

1500
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,192
In a different restrictor.

1501
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:54,992
You know what I mean?

1502
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:56,561
Load a fucking gun.

1503
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:57,562
Shoot a fucking gun.

1504
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,230
You know, that's all it is.

1505
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,132
And now we've got
things running.

1506
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:04,569
You must cancel the check to
Rish Washburn for the deposit.

1507
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:08,339
I have a feeling that he will
try to deposit it and rape us,

1508
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:09,607
Steal our money.

1509
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,343
So you must cancel that
$2,000 check to Rick Washburn,

1510
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,212
Because we had very
many problems today.

1511
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:15,346
We went over time.

1512
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,782
And it was because of
his faulty equipment.

1513
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:21,352
So I cannot-- you know, I
cannot allow that to happen.

1514
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:22,953
So that's $2,000.

1515
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:25,190
I have no idea how
much he plans to take.

1516
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,292
So you've got to cancel
that check to Rick Washburn

1517
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:30,595
First thing in the morning.

1518
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,297
Half the crew went out
drinking last night,

1519
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:34,232
Didn't come home until 3
o'clock in the morning.

1520
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,700
[Loud music playing]

1521
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,636
[Karaoke singing]

1522
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:47,145
We had a 6 o'clock call.

1523
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:50,415
INTERVIEWER: Were you among
those out late last night?

1524
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:53,551
No, not tremendously late.

1525
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:54,352
INTERVIEWER: Till when?

1526
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:56,187
Not that late. [laughs]

1527
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:56,987
INTERVIEWER: 'Til when?

1528
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:59,357
I'm tired, Zork.

1529
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:00,225
I'm tired.

1530
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:01,859
I'm just gonna sleep.

1531
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:03,861
Some people stayed
out all night.

1532
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,029
INTERVIEWER: How late?

1533
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:05,863
What'd you say?

1534
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:06,664
INTERVIEWER: How late?

1535
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:07,798
I'm sick, Zork.

1536
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,833
MAN: He's hungover.

1537
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:09,634
Sick.

1538
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:10,668
INTERVIEWER: How late?

1539
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:11,602
Sick.

1540
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:12,737
INTERVIEWER:
(LAUGHING) How late?

1541
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:14,038
Sick.

1542
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,740
Like 11:15.

1543
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,074
And then also I
heard that there

1544
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:20,178
Was basically a fistfight
in the cafeteria

1545
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:22,480
This morning in this location.

1546
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:27,185
I guess Kevin had a
little bit of a hot temper.

1547
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:29,854
And some things
Gary said upset him.

1548
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:33,291
And he just got a little angry.

1549
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:35,460
Then he was getting
violent and scary.

1550
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,061
And I thought he
was just joking.

1551
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:38,563
And then he grabbed the
shit out of my hands.

1552
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:39,664
He said, don't fucking drink.
I see you, pussy.

1553
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:40,665
Blah, blah, blah.

1554
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,433
And started getting in my face.

1555
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:43,868
INTERVIEWER: What
was the fight about?

1556
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:49,073
Um, the PA didn't want
to get up to come here.

1557
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:50,241
You know, after
night of drinking,

1558
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,809
Somebody wakes you up
at 5:00 in the morning.

1559
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,010
He's like, come on, dude.
Get up.

1560
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,345
- Get up.
- Get up.

1561
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:58,683
So Kevin said that he was
being a wise-ass to him, and--

1562
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,385
Well, that's why he had to go.

1563
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:01,919
I mean, he didn't
do anything to him.

1564
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,020
But I guess just,
you know, we're

1565
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,155
Only four days into shooting.

1566
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:06,757
And if you're prone to
doing things like that,

1567
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,260
It's only going to get way,
way, way, way, way worse.

1568
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,598
So I guess they just didn't want
that kind of stuff happening.

1569
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:16,100
Like, 11:15.

1570
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:18,035
INTERVIEWER: Like, uh, 1:15?

1571
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:18,836
11:15.

1572
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:19,670
INTERVIEWER: Like 2:15?

1573
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:20,471
11:15

1574
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:22,573
INTERVIEWER: Like 3:15?

1575
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:25,443
Security to the set, please.

1576
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,712
Please remove Zork
from the premises.

1577
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,614
INTERVIEWER: What did you
hear about the little scandal

1578
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:30,748
Last night?

1579
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:31,549
The little scandal?

1580
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,650
What, that guy pissing?

1581
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,219
So what did piss on
the floor last night?

1582
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,320
Do you know that?

1583
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,987
I got woken up at 2
o'clock in the morning

1584
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,890
Last night because somebody
was pissing in the hallway.

1585
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,691
Yes.

1586
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:41,592
I can't believe they peed.

1587
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:42,727
And I woke up.

1588
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:43,928
I'm like, up the fuck
are you talking about?

1589
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:45,896
[Laughs] You walk out.

1590
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,567
And I'm like [sniffing] [laugh]

1591
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,069
I don't know what
to think, you know?

1592
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:52,870
Who are these people?

1593
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,705
And why are they here, you know?

1594
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:57,542
With alcohol comes trouble.

1595
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:58,743
[Inaudible].

1596
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,878
Like, and they won't care
who was out last night

1597
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:03,748
And didn't get up
at 6 o'clock call.

1598
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,115
The only problem--

1599
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,984
Which I understand is about
half the people on this movie,

1600
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:08,085
So--

1601
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,320
A major problem that
we're having is just--

1602
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,188
I have a major problem with
you not listening to me.

1603
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,457
I'm sorry.

1604
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:15,893
Because I'm basically
very upset right now.

1605
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:18,796
Whatever happened this morning,
I consider a direct result

1606
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:21,232
Of people going out last
night, drinking too much,

1607
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:24,201
And not being able to get up
this morning in a proper mood

1608
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:25,002
To do their job.

1609
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:28,306
Don't drink and make movies.

1610
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:29,106
OK.

1611
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,776
It was 11:30, Zork?

1612
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:32,810
INTERVIEWER: How late?

1613
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,212
11:30.

1614
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,047
I don't want to be
filmed now, Zork.

1615
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,217
INTERVIEWER: So we've
been having a fun morning?

1616
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,119
Actually the stuff
we're doing for the shoot

1617
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,255
Is fun and all that stuff.

1618
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:46,156
The actual stuff we're
shooting has been a lot of fun.

1619
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,092
It's been a great deal of fun.

1620
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:52,830
It's just really
hard to stay cool.

1621
00:53:52,930 --> 00:54:01,339
The only trouble spot is when
I'm unable to try to get cool,

1622
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:05,109
You know, when I'm in
there waiting for stuff.

1623
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,677
And it's mostly
the disorganization

1624
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:10,415
As well, the lack of
responsibility being taken.

1625
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:16,721
So that's what
today's been like.

1626
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:19,990
INTERVIEWER: There have been
some challenges and dilemmas

1627
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,493
With Joe Fleishaker, and--

1628
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:27,632
Well, Joe Fleishaker,
apparently there was some issue

1629
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:30,200
About food, believe it or not.

1630
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,937
And I think we resolved that.

1631
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:33,838
I got him the turkey.

1632
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,205
We got him the turkey sandwich.

1633
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,975
He doesn't eat pastrami or any
kind of ham or even provo--

1634
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:40,010
Or what do you call
it-- prosciutto.

1635
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,448
So we got him a turkey,
no mayo, of course.

1636
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:45,850
He'll take a roll-- or you
know, take a French bread.

1637
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,318
But he will not take mayonnaise.

1638
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:49,119
I don't think he wants coleslaw.

1639
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,322
But we worked through that.

1640
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:54,224
But then today we had a problem
in that Joe Fleishaker didn't

1641
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:55,526
Want to get into costume.

1642
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,361
That was a big problem.

1643
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:57,595
Regular job.

1644
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,697
Now I can't do that,
because they want me here

1645
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,265
On Tuesday and on Thursday.

1646
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:03,033
We'll cut the scene out
finish this scene is,

1647
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,235
And whatever that scene
is, we don't need it.

1648
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:06,070
Right?

1649
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,005
That's easy enough.

1650
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,306
-I'm just very tired.
-All right, so you're tired.

1651
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:10,775
-I'll get into my costume now.
-Come on.

1652
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:11,809
You were eating by a escalator.

1653
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,044
How can you be more
tired than that?

1654
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,413
JOE: But that was
done in a long day.

1655
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:16,814
Come on, this is different.
Four days in a row--

1656
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:18,483
You said you wanted-- you
said you were planning.

1657
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,851
You had your vacation to do
the "Toxic Avenger" movie.

1658
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,286
-That's correct.
-This is your fucking vacation.

1659
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:23,388
But whatever plans
that I've made--

1660
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:24,054
Just please put the
costume on, all right?

1661
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:24,989
I'll do that.

1662
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:25,823
Finish this scene,
and then we'll

1663
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,291
Worry about what comes later.

1664
00:55:27,392 --> 00:55:31,128
Yeah, Scarlett O'Hara said that
tomorrow is whatever it is.

1665
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:33,330
But he did it. he
rose to the occasion.

1666
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:35,366
He got into costume.

1667
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:36,767
But then he had to leave.

1668
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,636
He had to leave the set, because
he has to rest up for tomorrow,

1669
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:39,870
So--

1670
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,772
I'm feeling OK, but we
have some possible troubles

1671
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,008
Coming over the next
few days with him

1672
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:45,275
Cutting scenes or something.

1673
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:46,777
I hope we can--

1674
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:48,746
You know, Lloyd
had a lot of nerve

1675
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,749
Telling me that I scheduled
my vacation [inaudible].

1676
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,117
Sure I did.

1677
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:55,486
But every single element, every
single day of that schedule

1678
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:57,221
Has been turned on its head.

1679
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:59,457
Every day I told my
boss I would be in,

1680
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:00,725
And he's now asking
me not to be in.

1681
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:02,226
And I can't stay.

1682
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:04,328
I can't come back tomorrow
to do those other scenes.

1683
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:05,463
I'm not really ready for them.

1684
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,965
They want me to do
the alleyway scene.

1685
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:11,335
We are not going to do
the Joe Fleishaker bladder

1686
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:14,171
For his giant fart explosion.

1687
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:16,941
Instead we will use the
bladder, the Joe Fleishaker

1688
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,309
Expanding during his sex scene.

1689
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:22,112
And if they can't use
it in the sex scene,

1690
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,815
Then we'll figure out
something else to do with it.

1691
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:27,652
INTERVIEWER: So what do you use
to prepare for your character

1692
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:29,053
Here?

1693
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:31,355
Well, my whole life
has been my preparation.

1694
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:33,858
My whole life has been
one big, giant joke.

1695
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:36,260
And when you add to the fact
years and years of overeating

1696
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,563
And under exercise, here I am.

1697
00:56:38,663 --> 00:56:40,898
That made Lardass.

1698
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:45,102
Today we are trying
to make up a scene,

1699
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:50,475
Because we lose this location
forever in about three hours.

1700
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,843
INTERVIEWER: Trent, what's
the word of the day?

1701
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:55,412
[Sigh] Panic.

1702
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:56,681
We're shooting around the gore.

1703
00:56:56,781 --> 00:57:01,018
And then those will
be done in-- we

1704
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:04,088
Cleverly created these posters
so that you could create

1705
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:05,856
The classroom-- sections
of the classroom

1706
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:09,326
Anywhere, knowing that
we might run out of time.

1707
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,995
We can reproduce
that door as fake.

1708
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,329
So that door can be reproduced.

1709
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,533
This is the door where Trent's
body will be disemboweled.

1710
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,101
We just have to get
the sinew here here.

1711
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:19,770
So we've got to get the
skeleton, sinew, of this scene,

1712
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,473
And then the bowels.

1713
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:35,686
Right?

1714
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,921
Yeah?

1715
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:39,657
We need you running through
the students on the set.

1716
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:40,658
[Inaudible] right now.

1717
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,071
Right, right.

1718
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:06,984
Right, right.

1719
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:15,292
What's going on?

1720
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:16,126
I'm sorry.

1721
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,194
I don't want to fuck things up.

1722
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:19,263
But we should try to shoot this.

1723
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:20,798
TRENT HAAGA: Here's what
we need to do, Lloyd.

1724
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:21,632
Come here.

1725
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:23,968
Is something going wrong here?

1726
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:26,336
I'm just-- I'm hot.

1727
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,205
I'm hot, and I'm
trying to get cool.

1728
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:29,306
And they can't prepare anything.

1729
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:30,374
Why do they keep bothering you?

1730
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:31,742
Why do they-- Trent,
why do these guys

1731
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,477
Have to keep talking to you?

1732
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:35,680
No, Trent was
listening to me explain

1733
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,715
That it doesn't make
sense for me to go in

1734
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:39,349
And be hot and sweating.

1735
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,851
And they can't patch me.

1736
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:43,954
No matter what they do, they
can't patch me if I'm sweating.

1737
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:46,423
Because the makeup they're
using has water in it.

1738
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,692
-Yeah, I understand.
-Put it on.

1739
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:48,893
And if I'm sweating
more than that--

1740
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,394
-Don't worry about it.
- --it's not gonna stay.

1741
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:51,195
Yeah, it's all right.

1742
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:52,663
So OK?

1743
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,164
You all right?

1744
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,133
Are you happy?

1745
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,068
Are you happy?

1746
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:59,503
David, are you a happy Toxie?

1747
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:00,638
Are you OK?

1748
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:04,642
You're happy, and-- it's
only day four, man, so--

1749
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:06,611
All right, so basically--

1750
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,495
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, all right.

1751
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:28,265
Can we get Toxie in
the costume, please?

1752
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:29,566
I think we can shoot it.

1753
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:30,367
We're ready to go.

1754
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:31,401
Toxie should be ready.

1755
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:32,269
I'm sorry.

1756
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:33,170
We're waiting on
the mop, Lloyd.

1757
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,238
It's coming.

1758
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:34,972
INTERVIEWER: I don't
care about the mop.

1759
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,573
It should be ready.

1760
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:37,708
It should be ready.

1761
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:39,343
It's not right.

1762
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:40,778
We're sitting here.

1763
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:44,882
Everybody's got their faces
in tacos, taco sauce, blood.

1764
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:47,151
We should be ready to
shoot when we're ready.

1765
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:50,054
If the guy wants to have
a movie, we can't do it.

1766
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:51,021
We've got to go faster.

1767
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,957
We can't make [inaudible].

1768
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:54,424
MAN: He's here.

1769
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:57,327
[Chatter]

1770
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,896
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, are
we gonna shoot, folks?

1771
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:00,497
TRENT HAAGA: Do you to
rehearse with Toxie once,

1772
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,999
So he knows what's going on?

1773
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:02,900
He watched it, but--

1774
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,968
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I
don't have time.

1775
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:04,969
I've got to get a scene.

1776
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:06,737
I must-- or we can
not have a scene.

1777
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:07,805
What do--
TRENT HAAGA: All right.

1778
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:09,339
No, let's get smoking.
Let's have him go.

1779
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,274
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Can we
come back tomorrow?

1780
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:11,541
TRENT HAAGA: Here we go.
Let's go.

1781
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:12,677
MAN: No.

1782
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:13,678
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Can we
redo it late tonight?

1783
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:14,745
TRENT HAAGA: You're right.
Let's go.

1784
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:15,179
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's go.

1785
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:15,846
Smoke!

1786
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:16,781
Lights!

1787
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,716
Everyone get ready.

1788
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:20,084
This isn't how you make a movie.

1789
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:21,351
MAN: This isn't fun, no.

1790
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,486
I'm telling you right now, man.

1791
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:24,421
This-- this is how
you make a movie.

1792
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,691
Get people to
argue with another.

1793
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:27,992
And then you go,
(IMITATING LLOYD) what

1794
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,459
Is this, a fucking debate squad?

1795
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,361
Is this debating club?

1796
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,130
Am I standing in the
middle of debating club?

1797
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,733
I'm like, you fucking died.

1798
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:36,767
That was pretty good, huh?

1799
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:37,902
Dude, there's no way.

1800
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:39,503
Oh, he's gonna kill me
when he sees this, man.

1801
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:40,070
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Yeah, we'll shoot.

1802
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:40,771
We'll shoot it.

1803
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,439
We need Toxie, though.

1804
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,374
MAN: Do you need background?

1805
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,642
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah
you can sit there.

1806
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:46,443
Doesn't hurt.

1807
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:49,113
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What the--
who [inaudible] him?

1808
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:49,914
I didn't--

1809
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:51,181
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Get him back.

1810
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,549
Tell him to put
the makeup back on.

1811
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,684
We'll just use his body, right?

1812
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:54,484
Who wrapped him?

1813
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,285
I didn't wrap him.

1814
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,353
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, I know.

1815
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:57,822
Well, nobody should
wrap until we wrap.

1816
01:00:57,922 --> 01:00:59,489
That's ridiculous.

1817
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,325
Just get him in with
his body, right?

1818
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:02,893
Oh, that's bad stuff, right?

1819
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:03,928
I won't continue with that.

1820
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:05,129
CAT: I didn't wrap him.
I'm sorry.

1821
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:06,363
Well, who did wrap him?
CAT: I have no idea.

1822
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:10,067
He's in effects getting
his makeup taken off.

1823
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,068
MAN: Easy.
Easy, Lloyd.

1824
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,336
MAN: Well, where
does the [inaudible]?

1825
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:15,305
Yeah, you got to-- you
can't do that, right?

1826
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,441
Hey, you guys
can't do this stuff

1827
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,109
Until he's wrapped, right?
I'm the director.

1828
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,444
I'm the boss.

1829
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,446
Don't wrap until you get the
word directly from the top.

1830
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:24,181
I'm sorry if you
were misinformed.

1831
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:25,382
It obviously was a boo boo.

1832
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:26,784
And again, I'm grateful.

1833
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,218
It's the best makeup
we've ever had,

1834
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,087
The best Toxie we've ever had.

1835
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,456
But there might be some
major miscommunication.

1836
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:34,124
And if it happens, it'll
be a four-hour wait.

1837
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,894
So please-- this didn't
matter, this one.

1838
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,729
But please just
check first, right?

1839
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,330
Please, please, please.

1840
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,299
Tox-- uh, David,
thank you very much.

1841
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:43,300
It was a wonder day.

1842
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,101
Are you satisfied?

1843
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,270
Everything all right?

1844
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,271
LLOYD KAUFMAN: But you're OK?

1845
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,723
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We
can't do any better.

1846
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:07,992
We cannot do any better.

1847
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:09,393
I can't make the
movie any other way.

1848
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:12,262
This is the best-- this may be
harder than most of the days.

1849
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:14,598
I don't know.

1850
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,500
But the only good-- the
only thing I can suggest

1851
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,136
Is when we're outdoors, we
only have so much daylight.

1852
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,438
That may help you
at the bottom end.

1853
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:25,442
But at the top end, it means
earlier, you know, David.

1854
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:30,915
So I wish we could
do better for you.

1855
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:32,883
Your patience is gonna be tried.

1856
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,687
LLOYD KAUFMAN: There is, but it
ain't-- the movies-- at least,

1857
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:39,924
In our movies, the shooting
schedule, it means very little,

1858
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:41,358
Because things happen.

1859
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,794
Shit happens, you know.

1860
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:47,164
So you got to let me know
if there's some problem.

1861
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,566
You know what I mean?

1862
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:52,669
Hopefully, things will be better
as we go on with this thing.

1863
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,139
But there are gonna be
unexpected things, and--

1864
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:03,747
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It won't happen.

1865
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:04,681
I'd love it.

1866
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,217
No one would like
it more than I,

1867
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:10,454
But I don't think
we will get it.

1868
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:12,456
I just am afraid
we will not get it.

1869
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:14,024
This stuff, we had
a lot of actors.

1870
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,394
So maybe, you know--
maybe tomorrow

1871
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:18,562
Will be a little easier.

1872
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:19,363
I don't know.

1873
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,639
[Laughs] He cant' leave.

1874
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:31,408
I told him to dye his hair.

1875
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:32,977
I told you I needed to
make his hair black,

1876
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:34,444
Because otherwise it
looked like-- people

1877
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:35,379
Was saying it's Tromaville.

1878
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,214
But now I don't
know where he is.

1879
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,415
We're late again.

1880
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:40,484
Every day, it's late.

1881
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:43,720
It's fucking-- we're
shooting exteriors, right?

1882
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,055
What time is it?

1883
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,390
It's almost fucking 10 o'clock.

1884
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,858
How's it going?

1885
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,826
Well, we haven't
got a shot off yet.

1886
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,261
This is exciting.
The script is exciting.

1887
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,496
I loved it.
-Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

1888
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:53,297
I loved it.

1889
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:54,464
I thought it was so funny.

1890
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,532
It's so funny.

1891
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:56,867
So you liked the script?

1892
01:03:56,967 --> 01:04:01,705
You think it's as good
as "Shakespeare in Love"?

1893
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:03,140
Oh, much better.

1894
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,743
When you're not busy, could
me and him talk to you?

1895
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:07,844
Sure.

1896
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:10,447
Because he has something
pretty big going on.

1897
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:11,481
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1898
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:12,582
Pretty big?

1899
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,650
Well, I ought to hear
about it right now.

1900
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,718
He wants to make a movie?

1901
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:17,154
Yeah?

1902
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:18,788
He's making a book right now.

1903
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:19,924
Uh-huh.

1904
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,826
And he has his own
characters and everything.

1905
01:04:22,927 --> 01:04:28,065
And he wanted to know if he
could make a movie out of it.

1906
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:30,767
Why not?

1907
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,870
Just keep-- you have to have,
like, a script or something.

1908
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:34,738
You got to get some money.

1909
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:36,440
You have to raise money.

1910
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,342
You need money to make a movie.

1911
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:40,777
Well, I guess he could
bring it to us, you know.

1912
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,247
He's made his own book.

1913
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:44,481
-Really?
-Yeah.

1914
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:45,849
-Oh, maybe--
-We have a club.

1915
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:46,917
We have everything.
-Really?

1916
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:47,717
Yeah.

1917
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:48,818
Oh, wow.
Cool.

1918
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:49,653
Good going.

1919
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:51,655
It sounds really interesting.

1920
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:56,160
Well, let's-- what's
the next step?

1921
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,395
The next step is--

1922
01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,796
I guess talk about
it at some point.

1923
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:00,530
Yeah.
-Yeah.

1924
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:01,698
All right, all right.

1925
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:03,833
Well, maybe after we
finish shooting this one,

1926
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:07,237
Perhaps we can
have a discussion--

1927
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:09,606
He looks a little worried.

1928
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,475
[Laughs]

1929
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:12,442
He is.

1930
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:13,743
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's a movie--

1931
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,746
Ever since he was four, he's
been making up this thing.

1932
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:17,781
Really, no kidding?

1933
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:18,615
Wow.

1934
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:20,084
What's the name of the story?

1935
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:22,086
"Ochie and Friends."

1936
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:22,953
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What is it?

1937
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:23,920
"Ochie and Friends."

1938
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:25,122
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Ochie and Friends."

1939
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:26,156
Great.

1940
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,258
And who is Ochie,
or what is it Ochie?

1941
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:31,461
They're, like, these
beings from, like,

1942
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:34,698
Far, far into outer space.

1943
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:39,769
And they're in their own
kind of solar system.

1944
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,905
But they have to go to a
totally different planet.

1945
01:05:42,006 --> 01:05:43,807
And they're only, like, 12.

1946
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,442
But they still get
all this stuff.

1947
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:47,944
And they get rockets.

1948
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:49,379
It sounds too good for Troma.

1949
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:50,914
It sounds like big Hollywood.

1950
01:05:51,015 --> 01:05:53,917
We're a small company.

1951
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:56,220
You guys haven't seen any
of our movies, probably?

1952
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,054
No.

1953
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:59,489
Our movies are kind of raunchy.

1954
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,492
So it sounds pretty good.

1955
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:05,195
Let's get together, and
maybe I can be helpful.

1956
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,397
And I'll certainly try
to help you with it.

1957
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,633
It's nice of you to
help your brother, too.

1958
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11,001
Yeah.

1959
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:12,369
Good older brother.

1960
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,273
Well, we'll try to-- Troma
team will help the Ochie team.

1961
01:06:16,373 --> 01:06:17,674
Anyway, have a great
day and thank you.

1962
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:19,143
Thank you.
Good luck with it.

1963
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:21,911
Thanks.

1964
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:22,712
Bye.

1965
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,149
See you later.

1966
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:28,018
INTERVIEWER: So Joe,
how's today going?

1967
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,354
JOE: Well, considering I just
got here and I'm already tired,

1968
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:31,755
Thirsty, and
sweating like a pig,

1969
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,290
It's just another
day at Tromaville.

1970
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,592
[Set chatter]

1971
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:38,028
INTERVIEWER: So what's
on the plate for today?

1972
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,764
JOE: Well, today's my first
appearance as Chester,

1973
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:42,499
The particle physicist.

1974
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:43,933
So there's going
to be, you know,

1975
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:45,169
What, my great love scene.

1976
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:49,306
There's going to be my first
interactions with Toxie,

1977
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:51,275
A lot of mistaken identities.

1978
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:53,610
INTERVIEWER: So are you
looking forward to all of this?

1979
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,646
JOE: I'm looking forward
to getting it over with.

1980
01:06:56,746 --> 01:07:00,084
[Chatter]

1981
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:00,917
10 minutes.

1982
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,720
I need Lloyd's approval, though.

1983
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,691
[Chatter]

1984
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:12,096
LLOYD KAUFMAN: You
should get the house

1985
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:13,563
Of stupids here doing the sign.

1986
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:14,531
You got eight people.

1987
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:16,500
They can't get a sign up.

1988
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,534
That's what you DVD.

1989
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:19,769
This is the house of stupidity.

1990
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,305
Can we do it now?

1991
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:22,439
How is that thing?

1992
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,741
If somebody, like, does
a little flick to it,

1993
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:28,078
Will it-- blow on that sign
and see if it blows over.

1994
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:29,379
[Blowing]

1995
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:30,514
MAN: Did you guys dig deep?

1996
01:07:30,614 --> 01:07:32,082
LLOYD KAUFMAN: The
astrological signs are down,

1997
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:34,584
But the signs are up.

1998
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:39,623
Cold pizza after 10 hours
of straight shooting.

1999
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,058
It was cold pizza.

2000
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,060
INTERVIEWER: Well, if you'll
remember, the first five hours

2001
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:45,595
Today, we didn't shoot at all.

2002
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:46,530
It wasn't your fault.

2003
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,465
Yeah, but food
is not determined,

2004
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,767
Like, by how footage we shoot.

2005
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:52,035
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]

2006
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:56,973
It's usually determined by
how long the day goes by.

2007
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,143
INTERVIEWER: How's the
experience been so far, Mike?

2008
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:01,445
It fucking sucks, man. [laughs]

2009
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:06,416
I'm sleeping bad,
losing 20 pounds a week.

2010
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:07,917
MAN: Oh, that's not [inaudible].

2011
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,319
Yeah, actually, I need
to lose the weight.

2012
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,155
So it's all right.

2013
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:12,456
INTERVIEWER: So you love Troma?

2014
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:13,890
I love Troma.

2015
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,325
I'm excited to do the next one.

2016
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:27,237
[Laughter]

2017
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:29,606
There you go.

2018
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,007
Set yourself up for that one.

2019
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:35,745
WOMAN: OK.

2020
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,415
We're going to get liquor,
liquor, liquor. [laughs]

2021
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:41,418
We're on our way to
the junkyard scene.

2022
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:44,288
[Inaudible] got to be drunk,
but we have no liquor.

2023
01:08:44,388 --> 01:08:45,689
And you got ID?

2024
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:50,093
Because underneath
your makeup and mask,

2025
01:08:50,194 --> 01:08:53,630
I can't tell-- not that I'd
be able to tell-- [laughs]

2026
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,931
What the hell's the difference?

2027
01:08:55,031 --> 01:08:56,466
Hey, honey, how am I gonna
be able to tell if it's him

2028
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:57,801
Anyway. [laughs]

2029
01:08:57,901 --> 01:08:59,135
MAN: Have someone else buy it.

2030
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:00,570
Look at their ID.

2031
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,639
Yeah, you look old enough.

2032
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:04,941
[Laughter]

2033
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:07,010
"The Toxic Avenger."

2034
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,111
MAN: You should see his costume.

2035
01:09:08,212 --> 01:09:09,012
I've heard of that.

2036
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:09,879
MAN: You've heard of that?

2037
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,282
We're shooting part 4.

2038
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:13,683
(SLURRING) Aw, shite.

2039
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,019
This isn't the hospital.

2040
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:17,654
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No, come on, man.

2041
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:18,455
Concentrate, man.

2042
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,023
You're not doing it, right.

2043
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:23,727
It's like, (SLURRING)
oh, fucking, shite.

2044
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,463
What the-- this isn't the--
you've got to get over here.

2045
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:29,199
This isn't the-- the camera's
looking at us, right?

2046
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:31,100
This isn't the fucking hospital.

2047
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,336
Aw, shite.

2048
01:09:32,436 --> 01:09:34,070
This-- you know, this
isn't the fucking hospital.

2049
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:38,342
Do it like-- I'm
a fucking failure!

2050
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:40,544
I suck!

2051
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:41,911
I suck!

2052
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,313
INTERVIEWER: Could you do that
again for the camera, Lloyd?

2053
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:44,781
[Laughter]

2054
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:47,217
Well, I'd say that.
(SLURRING) I fucking suck!

2055
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:49,386
My movie was a fu-- no, no.

2056
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:50,487
[Laughter]

2057
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:51,888
HEIDI SJURSEN: I told
my mom this morning

2058
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:54,123
That I was gonna be making
out with a chick today.

2059
01:09:54,224 --> 01:09:55,525
What did she say?

2060
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:59,062
[Laughs] My mom's so cool.

2061
01:09:59,162 --> 01:09:59,863
Like, she didn't flip.

2062
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:00,797
She was like, really?

2063
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:01,931
Like OK, honey,
have a good time.

2064
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,301
Yeah, have a good time.

2065
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:06,069
Did everything
work out yesterday

2066
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:07,704
With the Sapphic love scene?

2067
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:08,505
No.

2068
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:09,306
Why, what happened?

2069
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,140
There was a revolution.

2070
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:15,512
The actress did not wish
to take her clothes off.

2071
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:18,147
And, you know, and she
did the first scene

2072
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,516
With Toxie lovemaking.

2073
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:20,650
She's been established.

2074
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,119
So there wasn't really
too much we could do.

2075
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,021
[Inaudible] [gasp]

2076
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:25,989
Yeah, baby.

2077
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,891
It's good for the baby.

2078
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:31,194
HEIDI SJURSEN: Oh, baby.

2079
01:10:31,295 --> 01:10:32,696
[Moan]

2080
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:41,004
[Moan]

2081
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,281
Cut.

2082
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:57,153
It's done that way
just to [inaudible].

2083
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,955
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I'm just
trying to convince the actress

2084
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:01,525
To take her clothes off,
something which was contracted

2085
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:02,859
To, and something
which was agreed upon,

2086
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,294
Something which was
rehearsed, and something

2087
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:06,963
Which was pre-recorded on tape.

2088
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:08,332
INTERVIEWER: And this
isn't gonna happen?

2089
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:09,165
That's what's going on.

2090
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,233
But now we're gonna shoot Toxie.

2091
01:11:10,334 --> 01:11:13,136
Who's doing Toxie's makeup?

2092
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:14,604
Anybody doing Toxie's makeup?

2093
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,039
Or are we not making this movie?

2094
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:18,475
Yeah, we have somebody
who's doing it.

2095
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:24,781
[Chatter]

2096
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:26,750
MAN: Lloyd, it was a closed set.

2097
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,217
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yes, I agree.

2098
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:30,186
But people can stand by.

2099
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,421
They can stand by.

2100
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,122
And when we're ready for
somebody, they can be there.

2101
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,558
MAN: How are they
gonna be there, Lloyd?

2102
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:35,892
They can be right in the back.

2103
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:38,562
And then when we call for
them, they can be there, right?

2104
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:39,529
I'm sorry.

2105
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,498
I've been making
movies for a long time.

2106
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:42,732
People can stay
off the set and be

2107
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:43,733
Available when they're needed.

2108
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:47,371
There's a little
bit of-- I'm not

2109
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:48,672
Quite sure how to describe it.

2110
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:50,507
But you can interview
some people on the set.

2111
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:54,844
There was a little bit
of that actress stuff

2112
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,013
Going on yesterday, I'm afraid.

2113
01:11:57,113 --> 01:12:00,249
But I think we managed
to nip it in the bud.

2114
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,431
No, not at all.

2115
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:16,400
And I didn't plan
on not doing it.

2116
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:34,751
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
yeah, it's gonna be fine.

2117
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:09,118
[High-pitched noise]

2118
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,254
If we don't shut
this off, we won't

2119
01:13:11,354 --> 01:13:13,690
Be able to hear the church bells
when they start going, see.

2120
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:17,961
OK, camera is ready.

2121
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,362
Quiet on set, please.

2122
01:13:19,463 --> 01:13:20,730
Standing by.
WOMAN: No more bell ringers.

2123
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,698
[Bell ringing]

2124
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:22,799
ALL: Aw.

2125
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:23,600
Man.

2126
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:28,237
Sorry.

2127
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,174
[Laughter]

2128
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:36,045
(SINGING) How low is the true--

2129
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,482
MAN: You're making it
up as you go along.

2130
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:41,417
--[humming] I know
it, believe me.

2131
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:42,519
I know them all.

2132
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44,954
WOMAN: Where are you
picking these things up?

2133
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:48,191
I love Coltrane.

2134
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:50,727
Oliver Wendell Holmes
said, "the man cannot truly

2135
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:51,961
Live unless he
shares in the actions

2136
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:56,365
And passions of his times."

2137
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:58,468
Right, [inaudible]?

2138
01:13:58,568 --> 01:13:59,402
Uh, yeah.

2139
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:03,172
Pretty soon, it's [inaudible].

2140
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,609
Every time I hire someone who
is a friend of Lloyd's, it's

2141
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:09,278
Inevitably a fucking
nightmare, you know.

2142
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:10,680
So I don't know.

2143
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,583
It's 'cause Lloyd's old,
and all his friends are old.

2144
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:16,720
And they're all
fucking assholes.

2145
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:17,687
[Laughs]

2146
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,455
INTERVIEWER: What's
happening here?

2147
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:22,025
We're gonna set a man on fire.

2148
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,993
INTERVIEWER: Why?

2149
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,294
Because it's cool.

2150
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:26,896
INTERVIEWER: Why?

2151
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:28,231
Because the school
has blown up.

2152
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:31,467
And this flaming janitor
comes out the door.

2153
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,436
TJ is the janitor
of the school.

2154
01:14:33,537 --> 01:14:36,506
And after the building
blows up, he's the person

2155
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:38,775
One that comes out in flames.

2156
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,409
So Kimberly's gonna light him.

2157
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,048
BRENDAN FLYNT: Now,
this is a broomstick

2158
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,182
That's lit in flames?

2159
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:47,183
WOMAN: Just the tip.

2160
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:48,685
It's like a long match.

2161
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:49,919
BRENDAN FLYNT:
Yeah, a long match.

2162
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:51,020
OK.

2163
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,222
OK, so she ignites him,
staggers along here,

2164
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,758
Runs around like a maniac.

2165
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:00,630
Slides down the
banister here and we'll

2166
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:03,332
Put him out right down there
where that big blood patch is.

2167
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,035
INTERVIEWER: He's
playing a janitor.

2168
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:08,471
Who you don't actually
see before or after this.

2169
01:15:08,572 --> 01:15:11,040
But you know, hey, we
can light a guy on fire,

2170
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,341
So might as well, right?

2171
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:15,078
Now is there flames
only on his back,

2172
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,714
Or his front, or his side?

2173
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:19,115
His full back.

2174
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:20,483
BRENDAN FLYNT: Right, right, OK.

2175
01:15:20,584 --> 01:15:21,484
Nothing on the front.

2176
01:15:21,585 --> 01:15:22,819
So that's why he's
gonna be twisting.

2177
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:24,654
Yeah, I'll be twisting and
getting the flame all the way.

2178
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:26,856
And [shouting]

2179
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:31,227
BRENDAN FLYNT: Right, right, OK.

2180
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:35,131
INTERVIEWER: And that way
it's cheaper to set on fire

2181
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:37,333
A non-established character.

2182
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:39,836
I don't think it matters.

2183
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:41,971
I think it was more like
that was on his resume.

2184
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:44,373
And they went, oh,
there's an idea.

2185
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,810
So now he starts right here.

2186
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:47,811
MAN: Where are your cameras?

2187
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:50,246
He'll do the whole stunt.

2188
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:51,514
I get most of the flame.

2189
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:53,850
You'll still get
your stuff here.

2190
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,251
Is that OK?

2191
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:58,622
So I'm gonna have both
cameras at the bottom.

2192
01:15:58,722 --> 01:15:59,856
MAN: So both the cameras--

2193
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,457
BRENDAN FLYNT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2194
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,159
Put my cameras down here.

2195
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,794
MAN: Yeah that' my
buddy TJ up there.

2196
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,463
I'm a little nervous
just for him.

2197
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,898
INTERVIEWER: You're
worried for him?

2198
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:11,635
Hey, how long have
you been doing this?

2199
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:12,702
About 22 years.

2200
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,638
Setting myself on fire,
probably about 10.

2201
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:15,571
INTERVIEWER: Yeah?

2202
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:16,606
You nervous at all?

2203
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:18,007
No.

2204
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:19,575
INTERVIEWER: So Lloyd, do you
think that this body burn will

2205
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:20,644
Be better than "Terror Firmer"?

2206
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:21,444
You're up.

could be that good.

[Laughs]

2210
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:35,391
Nothing could be
that unbelievable.

2211
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:36,993
Not since the Vietnam
Buddhist priest

2212
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,295
Was there such a flame up.

2213
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:40,930
INTERVIEWER: So how
do you guys do this?

2214
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,198
How do you light him on fire?

2215
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:42,999
Carefully.

2216
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:44,934
[Interposing voices]

2217
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:45,902
Come over here.

2218
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:48,805
I'll show you where to do that.

2219
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:50,974
We have Nomex
underwear, two pairs,

2220
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:52,876
In here soaking
in fireproof gel.

2221
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:53,710
[Church bells ringing]

2222
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,978
This should be the soundtrack!

2223
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:57,613
Then we have a Nomex jumpsuit
over here, which doubles

2224
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,348
For his janitor costume.

2225
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,284
We get that all on
him, all gelled up,

2226
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:02,652
His face and hair gelled up.

2227
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:06,489
Then we put on lighter
fluid and rubber cement.

2228
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:07,891
Light him on fire.

2229
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:09,258
He runs around like a maniac.

2230
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:11,728
And we extinguish him down here.

2231
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:13,396
Maybe you should practice
it now, before he

2232
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:14,530
Gets the stuff on him.

2233
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,431
Look at this.

2234
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,767
Look at this here.

2235
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:20,737
[Whimpering]

2236
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:23,707
Whoa!

01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:26,209
Whoa!

[Chatter]

2241
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,650
OK.

2242
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:35,852
Here's what's
happening right now.

2243
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,420
We are locked with camera.

2244
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,723
The stuntman is prepping.

2245
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:42,625
OK, we need some nice,
respectful silence

2246
01:17:42,726 --> 01:17:43,993
While we do this work.

2247
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:45,628
And then we're gonna
light him on fire.

[Whistle] Safety guy up here.

2249
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:49,265
INTERVIEWER: What do you
think about this next stunt?

2250
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:51,100
Every time I've done these,
they've been really horrible,

2251
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,235
So--
INTERVIEWER: They have?

2252
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:53,402
TRENT HAAGA: Yeah, I'm
not really optimistic.

2253
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,238
But, you know, we'll see.

2254
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,606
Want to make a dollar bet?

2255
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:58,641
We'll make a dollar bet.

2256
01:17:58,742 --> 01:17:59,976
INTERVIEWER: OK, I'll
make you a dollar.

2257
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,110
All right.

2258
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,545
I'll make a dollar bet
saying that this sucks.

2259
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:05,581
Special concerns concerning
the stairs that he

2260
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,883
Has to run down on fire?

2261
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:07,851
No, actually.

2262
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:09,085
He's kind of looking
forward to it,

2263
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,553
Because it's sort of
like two stunts in one.

2264
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:12,922
It's a regular fire
burn and the stair fall,

2265
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,090
So he wants it for his reel.

2266
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,525
So he's kind of
looking forward to it.

2267
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:18,127
Is everybody ready?
Kimberly, are you ready?

2268
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:19,428
-Ready.
-TJ, ready?

2269
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,429
Yes, sir.

2270
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,630
Camera and crew ready?

2271
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:22,465
MAN: Ready.

2272
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:23,900
MAN: Quiet on the set, please.

2273
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,871
We're gonna do this now.

2274
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:32,041
Roll camera A.

2275
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:32,842
[Beep]

2276
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:34,343
MAN: Speed camera A.

2277
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:35,344
MAN: Roll camera B.

2278
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:36,145
[Whirring]

2279
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,313
MAN: Speed Camera B.

2280
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:38,314
Action, TJ.

2281
01:18:41,885 --> 01:18:45,789
[Screaming]

2282
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:01,170
And cut.

2283
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:04,673
[Applause]

2284
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:13,116
[Chatter]

2285
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,791
What was that for?

2286
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:23,559
I bet that this would suck.

2287
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:24,693
[Laughs]

2288
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:28,097
What a fucking, fucking,
fucked up thing, man.

2289
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:30,867
It was a fucked-up burn.

2290
01:19:30,967 --> 01:19:33,102
These guys are doing a
high fall for us later.

2291
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:34,938
It's the same shit every time.

2292
01:19:35,038 --> 01:19:37,040
Never hire Lloyd's friends.

2293
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:37,841
Never.

2294
01:19:43,847 --> 01:19:46,249
INTERVIEWER: What's your
biggest fear of today?

2295
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:48,551
Not getting the shots
and not going on schedule

2296
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:49,752
Are my biggest fear every day.

2297
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:59,896
We had a-- we had to
have a Toxie stand in,

2298
01:19:59,996 --> 01:20:03,132
Because our Toxie was late.

2299
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:05,101
He's usually
incredibly punctual.

2300
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:06,903
He's been consistent
every single day.

2301
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:09,538
I think he's one of the first
people on set almost every day.

2302
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,875
And yet today, he overslept.

2303
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,109
Fucking dammit.

2304
01:20:13,209 --> 01:20:14,443
I said 6 o'clock.

2305
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,479
It's three hours and they
can't get the guy into costume.

2306
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:18,547
INTERVIEWER: That did not
make Lloyd very happy.

2307
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,850
No, it didn't make
anybody very happy.

2308
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:21,851
[Inaudible] at the office.

2309
01:20:21,951 --> 01:20:22,919
Yeah.

2310
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:24,487
I can't hold their
fucking hands, Lloyd.

2311
01:20:24,587 --> 01:20:26,389
You can kick them in the ass.

2312
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,691
You can certainly ring
their bloody necks.

2313
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:30,759
And you know, mules-- if
you kick a mule hard enough,

2314
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,895
You get it to pull the plow.

2315
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:32,695
That's all I know.

2316
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:33,762
And you have mules.

2317
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:35,031
And you're not kicking
them hard enough.

2318
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:36,465
It's ridiculous.

2319
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,935
It throws the rest of
us in a tailspin whenever

2320
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:40,469
The first shot involves Toxie.

2321
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:41,537
Toxie's late.

2322
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:43,472
It takes two hours
to get his makeup on.

2323
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:46,675
And even if he's supposed
to be there at 5:00,

2324
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,878
And all of a sudden it's 6:30 or
something and there's no Toxie,

2325
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:50,279
It's, like, major.

2326
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:54,783
Because then we know the first
I can't get off until like 8:30.

2327
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:57,086
INTERVIEWER: Lloyd, do you
have a word of the morning?

2328
01:20:57,186 --> 01:21:05,995
Uh, a lot of very,
very bad production.

2329
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:07,230
No actors.

2330
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,564
INTERVIEWER: What
are you doing, Sandy?

2331
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:14,137
I'm making this
guy a Toxie double.

2332
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:16,505
INTERVIEWER: Why?

2333
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:20,143
Because supposedly
Dave-- unfortunately,

2334
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:21,877
His costume takes
a while to prepare.

2335
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:24,647
So they want to get
this shot done, so--

2336
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:25,982
One just wasn't enough.

2337
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:27,350
They're using--

2338
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,884
INTERVIEWER: Are you
gonna be able to tell

2339
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:31,387
That's a different guy?

2340
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:32,188
We have a great editor.

2341
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:33,289
[Laughs]

2342
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,091
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We'll get
Toxie coming out of--

2343
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:35,992
Who's Toxie?

2344
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,198
He's not doing
stunts or anything.

2345
01:21:42,298 --> 01:21:43,432
No, no.

2346
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:45,534
We just-- we got to have
some stuff with Toxie, man.

2347
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:46,669
We can't wait around.

2348
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,204
It's been like five hours
since his call time,

2349
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:51,307
And he's still not
here yet, you know.

2350
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,977
--[inaudible] close-up
when they were coming out

2351
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:55,578
Oh, is he here now?

2352
01:21:55,678 --> 01:21:56,612
I see the van.

2353
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:57,981
That's our van, right?

2354
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:01,417
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I
don't see him, though.

2355
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:02,218
Let him see.

2356
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:03,319
We got our Toxie, right?

2357
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:05,854
Instill the fear
of God into Toxie.

2358
01:22:05,955 --> 01:22:08,191
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I think
it's time to-- I'm

2359
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,258
Not too happy with this.

2360
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:12,495
I'm happy to use this guy.

2361
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:13,963
It's 10 o'clock.

2362
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:15,431
This is ridiculous.

2363
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:28,277
We shot with the stand-in,
who was inconspicuously

2364
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:31,780
Tito's height, when
Dave, our really Toxie,

2365
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,349
Is at least a foot taller.

2366
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:36,619
And he normally carries both of
us, which is the humor in it.

2367
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,421
He carries Tito
and Sweetie Honey.

2368
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:41,290
It's kind of funny, 'Cause
Dave's a strong guy,

2369
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:42,091
And he can do that.

2370
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:52,735
Ah, there you are, sir.

2371
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:53,669
Yes, sir.

2372
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:55,438
He's been here for
like 20 minutes.

2373
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:56,839
Oh, god, do they suck ass?

2374
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:57,806
And you're already dressed.

2375
01:22:57,906 --> 01:22:58,941
And what they're
gonna do is they're

2376
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:00,276
Gonna bring you out
through this side,

2377
01:23:00,376 --> 01:23:01,610
And we're gonna
put on your shoes.

2378
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,845
Great.

2379
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:06,015
I'm gonna shoot
with this guy, who's

2380
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:09,952
Half an inch taller than Mike
in the 10-year-old fucking mask?

2381
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:11,320
That's brilliant.

2382
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,122
Who's fucking idea was that?

2383
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,695
Oh, that looks really great.

2384
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:20,563
Motherfuckers.

2385
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:21,797
INTERVIEWER: What's that?

2386
01:23:21,897 --> 01:23:25,768
They got the fucking
10-year-old mask on a 6'2" guy.

2387
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:28,071
MAN: It doesn't look anything
like-- we have a stunt man.

2388
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:29,905
Somebody could have asked.

2389
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:30,806
Anybody could have asked.

2390
01:23:30,906 --> 01:23:31,874
Somebody could have asked.

2391
01:23:31,974 --> 01:23:33,542
I had no idea they
were shooting with it.

2392
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:34,777
I'm sure--

2393
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:38,881
I put together pieces of
this makeup for a stunt man.

2394
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:40,216
They don't care.

2395
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:41,517
No, they just
don't fucking care.

2396
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:43,619
They could do the rest of
the movie with a 10-year-old

2397
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:44,620
Mask and 6'2" guy.

2398
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,421
Right?

2399
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:48,057
Why not?

2400
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:50,025
They just don't care.

2401
01:23:50,126 --> 01:23:51,860
It's great.

2402
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,331
Fucking brilliant.

2403
01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:58,301
[Crowd shouting]

2404
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:14,183
[Crowd shouting]

2405
01:24:23,226 --> 01:24:24,593
MAN: Hey, that's a cut.

2406
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:26,095
That's a cut.

2407
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,707
MAN: That's a cut.

2408
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:40,176
That's a cut.

2409
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:41,144
That's a cut.

2410
01:24:41,244 --> 01:24:42,145
Cut, cut, cut.

2411
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:43,112
Cut, cut, cut.

2412
01:24:46,615 --> 01:24:50,319
We need to just have
Toxie get up and leave.

2413
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:53,189
[Chatter]

2414
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:56,091
He's just the stand in so
they could try to get some

2415
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,526
Shots off that don't really--

2416
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,128
That guy is like 6'2", if that.

2417
01:24:59,228 --> 01:25:00,129
I know.

2418
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:02,598
That's what I'm talking about.

2419
01:25:06,669 --> 01:25:09,505
MAN: It's just the shoes.

2420
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,607
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Morning, David.

2421
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:14,410
What's that?

2422
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,979
We need to have
Toxie move, remember?

2423
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:18,314
TRENT HAAGA: Yes, I--

2424
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:19,648
He can't stay on his knees,
otherwise there's no movie.

2425
01:25:19,748 --> 01:25:22,151
So how do we-- let's
just get the next move.

2426
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:23,586
I'm very wide.

2427
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:25,754
INTERVIEWER: So
why didn't they--

2428
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:28,357
Why didn't they use Dave?

2429
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,260
Because Dave was
late to get in makeup.

2430
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:35,164
But by the time we did
the scene, he was ready.

2431
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:36,131
They just said no.

2432
01:25:36,232 --> 01:25:37,766
I don't know, really.

2433
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:38,567
Hi.

2434
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:39,535
I got you, man.

2435
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:40,336
I got you.

2436
01:25:40,436 --> 01:25:41,704
We had people standing by.

2437
01:25:41,804 --> 01:25:43,839
We had no idea what we
could do without Toxie.

2438
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,674
And nobody could call.

2439
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:48,844
But let's just--
can we get past this?

2440
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:50,679
All we did was this
long shot with a fucking

2441
01:25:50,779 --> 01:25:51,614
Shitload of smoke.

2442
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:54,683
Yeah, can we do
it again with me?

2443
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:56,051
All right.
Let's see what I can do.

2444
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:56,852
DAVE: Tell me what
you want me to do.

2445
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:57,820
All right.

2446
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,987
Trent give me
some blocking here.

2447
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:06,629
TRENT HAAGA: Do you want to pick
this one up from that point?

2448
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:07,563
Just have him get up--

2449
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:08,631
Can we just fill
him up with smoke

2450
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:09,665
And have him bring
the kids on again?

2451
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:11,300
Why?
I don't want to do it again.

2452
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,401
-All right.
-Absolutely not.

2453
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:13,802
In fact, if it happens
again, there's gonna

2454
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:14,737
Be a fucking 'nother Toxie.

2455
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:15,704
TRENT HAAGA: All
right, no problem.

2456
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:16,739
And In fact, I
want that other guy.

2457
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:18,106
I want you to get-- hey.

2458
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:19,975
Rhonda, Rhonda.

2459
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:21,844
We're gonna sign that other
guy, and we're gonna pay him.

2460
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:29,918
So we can't do
the first 12 feet?

2461
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,119
No, Lloyd won't do it.

2462
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:31,987
He's fucking pissed at me.

2463
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:32,921
He's pissed at everybody.

2464
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,658
He's totally psycho.

2465
01:26:35,758 --> 01:26:38,060
This is a super long
shot over the tops

2466
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:38,894
Of the heads of crowds.

2467
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:39,728
We got fog and--

2468
01:26:39,828 --> 01:26:40,796
I was gonna carry them both up.

2469
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,597
Yeah.

2470
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:42,765
Wasn't that good?

2471
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:43,599
That was excellent.

2472
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:44,400
You know what I mean?

2473
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,301
I agree.

2474
01:26:45,401 --> 01:26:46,134
But--

2475
01:26:46,235 --> 01:26:47,803
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, let's do it?

2476
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:48,937
Can we just--

2477
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:49,738
Unbelievable.

2478
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:50,706
All right?

2479
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:52,174
And it looks like shit.

2480
01:26:52,275 --> 01:26:53,276
It's gonna look like shit.

2481
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:56,345
I can't get through
that little flag there.

2482
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:57,880
But this guy can.

2483
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,715
He's a half inch taller
than Tito, for christ sake.

2484
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:00,649
I know.

2485
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:01,617
And now we're not together.

2486
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:02,685
I know.

2487
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:04,119
Well we just got to--
like I said, man.

2488
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,321
We're gonna get
this in a master.

2489
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:07,323
We're gonna get closer,
and we're gonna get this.

2490
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:11,594
We just need this for the
master shot, all right?

2491
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:12,561
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So--

2492
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:14,096
Is there any way
to go back and just

2493
01:27:14,196 --> 01:27:16,632
Do the first 12 feet of this?

2494
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,033
Because in the rehearsal,
you said I would

2495
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:19,134
Carry both of them, right?
-We'll do a close-up.

2496
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,369
We'll do close-ups.

2497
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:21,370
We'll do this thing.

2498
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:23,406
We'll have you carrying
them out tight.

2499
01:27:23,506 --> 01:27:25,308
You're like this big
in the stuff I'm doing.

2500
01:27:25,408 --> 01:27:26,842
So we'll get you--
we'll do it again.

2501
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:28,411
It's just not gonna
match if I'm-- I mean,

2502
01:27:28,511 --> 01:27:30,279
I was carrying them both
in rehearsal [inaudible].

2503
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:33,015
Now we're going to do it
to match the way it was

2504
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:34,216
When you walked out the door.

2505
01:27:34,317 --> 01:27:35,017
And that was--

2506
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,251
That's what I'm saying.

2507
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:39,221
When you walked out the
door in there, you had him,

2508
01:27:39,322 --> 01:27:41,123
And you had her on your arm.

2509
01:27:41,223 --> 01:27:42,725
And we did that.

2510
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:44,827
We had her on--

2511
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:46,161
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Well,
can we just do this

2512
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,296
So I can break this set up?

2513
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:49,097
You mean from the other shot?
So like--

2514
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:50,299
TRENT HAAGA: Yeah.
-We're very late.

2515
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:51,400
We're never gonna get a movie.
I'm just worried--

2516
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,401
You're absolutely right.
Can we [inaudible]?

2517
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:53,736
DAVE: So I get
from here to here.

2518
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:54,703
Is that it?

2519
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:55,571
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hey, Hasan.

2520
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:56,572
Thank you.

2521
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,573
That was great.

2522
01:27:57,673 --> 01:27:58,507
Thank you.

2523
01:27:58,607 --> 01:27:59,742
Hang in, though.

2524
01:27:59,842 --> 01:28:02,578
We can still use you as the
super stud that you are.

2525
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:03,512
[Laugh]

2526
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,548
And we may need
you as Toxie, too.

2527
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:07,850
Now, why is he getting
out of the costume?

2528
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,886
Because he might be-- I
guess we got the real Toxie.

2529
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:11,954
Yeah, you're right.

2530
01:28:12,054 --> 01:28:13,088
WOMAN: I mean, I can
put him back in it.

2531
01:28:13,188 --> 01:28:13,922
Nah, it's all right.

2532
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:14,890
Just stay handy.

2533
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:17,393
And we'll keep
doing this, I think.

2534
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:19,227
Like tomorrow we
ought to do it also.

2535
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:21,964
INTERVIEWER: So what are
you looking over here?

2536
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:28,871
It's a short-term, I
believe, contract-- 21 days.

2537
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,573
And it looks in order.

2538
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:33,842
But I'm gonna read
it just to be sure.

2539
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:35,444
Make sure I don't have
to give up my first-born

2540
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:36,779
Or something like that.

2541
01:28:36,879 --> 01:28:38,514
INTERVIEWER: And what
will that be for?

2542
01:28:41,183 --> 01:28:46,221
I'm gonna be Toxie's double
whenever they need it, I guess.

2543
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,623
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yo,
you're supposed to stop

2544
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:48,991
People from going up here.

2545
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:50,893
You see, if they fall down,
break their neck with babies.

2546
01:28:50,993 --> 01:28:53,729
So stop them from going through.

2547
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,665
[Chatter]

2548
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:58,634
We're gonna have
a little problem

2549
01:28:58,734 --> 01:29:02,237
Today, because people are
going to be going up that step.

2550
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,639
We're shooting now.

2551
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,974
If somebody goes up the steps
when the cameras are rolling,

2552
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,576
That's very bad, because
it means we waste film.

2553
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:08,444
Yeah.

2554
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:09,578
Because you know
what'll happen,

2555
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:11,113
They'll look at the
camera behind them,

2556
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:12,214
And then that screws it up.

2557
01:29:12,314 --> 01:29:14,116
Because then people
know that they aren't

2558
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:15,551
Supposed to be in the movie.

2559
01:29:15,651 --> 01:29:19,788
So have to make sure that the
pedestrians, very politely,

2560
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:21,990
Are told to go around the back,
that we're making a movie,

2561
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:23,392
That we're going
around the back.

2562
01:29:23,492 --> 01:29:25,828
I don't want women with tiny
babies coming through here,

2563
01:29:25,928 --> 01:29:28,163
Tripping over wires,
bumping into people.

2564
01:29:28,263 --> 01:29:29,498
Right?

2565
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:33,335
Now, if you want to see the
most unpleasant side of me,

2566
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:36,371
Have another person
come up the steps.

2567
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:37,740
But I'm a nasty, horrible guy.

2568
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,307
I'm not worried
about-- right, you guys

2569
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:40,709
Are the sensitive young people.

2570
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:42,578
You're worried about-- you
know, seriously, come on.

2571
01:29:42,678 --> 01:29:43,378
Wake up.

2572
01:29:51,186 --> 01:29:52,821
I'm not gonna screw
around, man, when it comes

2573
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:55,624
To the people whose little
babies are coming through here,

2574
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:56,459
I don't care.

2575
01:29:56,559 --> 01:29:57,392
MAN: Yeah, I'm making a sign.

2576
01:29:57,493 --> 01:29:59,928
You can dislike
me all you want.

2577
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:01,430
But I'm sorry.

2578
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:02,631
I've been here for an hour.

2579
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:05,200
I've been asking for some
kind of polite system

2580
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,370
Of the Poughkeepsie-vilians
to go around.

2581
01:30:08,471 --> 01:30:09,705
They're perfectly willing.

2582
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:11,406
They don't want to
go through here.

2583
01:30:11,507 --> 01:30:13,742
You don't want people
falling on cables, right,

2584
01:30:13,842 --> 01:30:15,143
Especially little tiny babies.

2585
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,411
MAN: I got it.

2586
01:30:16,512 --> 01:30:18,180
Yeah, well I didn't think
you got it, because it's

2587
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,482
Like the eighth time.

2588
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:21,550
So until it gets done, I'm
gonna keep being unpleasant,

2589
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:24,252
Which I'm pretty good at.

2590
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:25,353
And have somebody here.

2591
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:26,288
Whatever it takes, right.

2592
01:30:26,388 --> 01:30:27,322
MAN: I think we're--

2593
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:28,356
I don't want to hear about it.

2594
01:30:28,457 --> 01:30:29,357
Just do it.

2595
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:30,726
It takes the brain
of, like-- right.

2596
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:34,162
I don't want to waste my 160
IQ on this particular problem.

2597
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,599
You probably have a genius.

2598
01:30:36,699 --> 01:30:37,666
Solve it, please.

2599
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,401
Or I'll just go back
there. [inaudible].

2600
01:30:39,502 --> 01:30:40,736
I'm not gonna have
women and babies

2601
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:44,206
Walking through the-- you
know, falling down on you guys.

2602
01:30:44,306 --> 01:30:45,674
I'll go back there.

2603
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:46,509
I'll stay there.

2604
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:48,343
You guys run it.

2605
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,812
I'll handle it.

2606
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:55,383
INTERVIEWER: Do you think
we should have some people

2607
01:30:55,484 --> 01:30:56,485
Just walk up the steps?

2608
01:30:56,585 --> 01:30:58,621
--[laughs] Just to
piss Lloyd off?

2609
01:30:58,721 --> 01:30:59,421
INTERVIEWER: Yes.

2610
01:30:59,522 --> 01:31:00,489
Oh, yeah.

2611
01:31:00,589 --> 01:31:02,491
You missed the big
explosion this morning.

2612
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:07,395
He-- no, I'm just kidding.

2613
01:31:07,496 --> 01:31:08,497
I'm making this all up.

2614
01:31:08,597 --> 01:31:11,667
Like, I don't even want
to start any rumors.

2615
01:31:11,767 --> 01:31:15,070
INTERVIEWER: Oh,
no, no, no. [laughs]

2616
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,505
Oh.

2617
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:18,707
[Laughs] You missed it.

2618
01:31:22,277 --> 01:31:25,681
[Chatter]

2619
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:30,619
Those are the brakes, right?

2620
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,222
But here we go-- the signs.

2621
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:35,891
This is no entry.

2622
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:44,967
INTERVIEWER: This is such
a beautiful location here.

2623
01:31:45,067 --> 01:31:47,469
How come we're not
filming inside?

2624
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:48,403
Oh, inside here?

2625
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,504
INTERVIEWER: Right.

2626
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:50,773
Why are we not filming
inside the mansion,

2627
01:31:50,873 --> 01:31:53,175
Like we were planned
and slated to?

2628
01:31:53,275 --> 01:31:56,879
Well, an incident happened,
where Aaron Imeson, who

2629
01:31:56,979 --> 01:32:00,315
Is one of our head
production assistants,

2630
01:32:00,415 --> 01:32:07,723
He created a bold rumor that
there was harmful lead paint

2631
01:32:07,823 --> 01:32:08,891
On the premises.

2632
01:32:08,991 --> 01:32:10,125
We were here
scouting a location.

2633
01:32:10,225 --> 01:32:11,126
We were videotaping.

2634
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:12,628
And on the videotape,
he said, god, it

2635
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:13,662
Smells like lead paint in here.

2636
01:32:13,762 --> 01:32:14,930
And then Trent went
over to the camera

2637
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,565
And started going nom, nom, nom.

2638
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:17,365
Oh, yeah.

2639
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:18,233
Lead paint tastes good.

2640
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:19,568
Nom, nom, nom.

2641
01:32:19,668 --> 01:32:23,706
And of course on a Troma set,
rumors just take about 10

2642
01:32:23,806 --> 01:32:25,774
Minutes for everyone to know.

2643
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,475
LLOYD KAUFMAN: The issue
came up in pre-production.

2644
01:32:27,576 --> 01:32:28,577
[Backseat chatter]

2645
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:30,813
And Trent put it to rest.

2646
01:32:30,913 --> 01:32:33,381
He went to the
environmental board.

2647
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:36,484
And they assured him
he could shoot there.

2648
01:32:36,585 --> 01:32:38,120
I'm calling from
Troma Entertainment.

2649
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,487
My name is Trent.

2650
01:32:39,588 --> 01:32:42,490
I just spoke to him on the
phone about five minutes ago

2651
01:32:42,591 --> 01:32:46,528
Regarding lead
paint safety issues.

2652
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:47,863
We cleared it up
in pre-production

2653
01:32:47,963 --> 01:32:49,264
That lead paint is not harmful.

2654
01:32:49,364 --> 01:32:51,600
We went to the health
department and all these people.

2655
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,569
Um, no, they had
said it's cracking.

2656
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:56,772
And then there's
stuff on the floor.

2657
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:59,241
Yeah, cracking paint
and paint on the floor,

2658
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:01,243
Paint chips on the floor.

2659
01:33:01,343 --> 01:33:04,647
OK, well, if you could talk
to me mano a mano, just

2660
01:33:04,747 --> 01:33:05,614
From a human point of view.

2661
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:07,916
I mean, what are the issues?

2662
01:33:08,016 --> 01:33:09,685
I mean, how harmful could it be?

2663
01:33:09,785 --> 01:33:11,053
You can shoot in a
place with lead paint.

2664
01:33:11,153 --> 01:33:12,655
You can shoot in a day.

2665
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:14,356
For lead paint, it
would be perfectly fine.

2666
01:33:14,456 --> 01:33:16,158
And I went to Aaron, who's
working the art department.

2667
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:17,626
Hey, Aaron, look.
Take two PAs.

2668
01:33:17,726 --> 01:33:19,494
I want you to clean Graystone.

2669
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,029
So blah, blah, blah, blah.

2670
01:33:21,129 --> 01:33:22,798
Clean it up so we
can shoot there.

2671
01:33:22,898 --> 01:33:23,632
No, I'm not doing it.

2672
01:33:23,732 --> 01:33:24,867
That place has lead paint in it.

2673
01:33:24,967 --> 01:33:27,235
I say Patrick, Ellie,
and Trent they can save.

2674
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:28,203
Clean it.

2675
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:29,037
Yeah.

2676
01:33:29,137 --> 01:33:30,172
Let them clean it. [inaudible].

2677
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:32,641
He said, fuck you, Jared
and went to the library.

2678
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:34,342
Got all this information
about lead paint.

2679
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,578
It got back to Dave Mattey.

2680
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:38,647
And then it got to this
whole big thing, where lead

2681
01:33:38,747 --> 01:33:40,115
Paint-- we couldn't shoot here.

2682
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:41,316
No, he was going to quit.

2683
01:33:41,416 --> 01:33:42,484
And you started
this whole campaign

2684
01:33:42,584 --> 01:33:43,686
That everybody was gonna quit.

2685
01:33:43,786 --> 01:33:45,888
Dave was gonna quit and
everybody was gonna quit.

2686
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:46,955
Fuck Troma.

2687
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:48,390
INTERVIEWER: How many
people are going?

2688
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:49,357
Eight.
INTERVIEWER: Raise your hand.

2689
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,826
Who's leaving?
-Eight people.

2690
01:33:50,926 --> 01:33:51,960
There's eight people total.

2691
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:53,762
And then there's five
more leaving tomorrow.

2692
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:56,031
INTERVIEWER: Say
their names right now.

2693
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:56,965
Mark Hugo.

2694
01:33:57,065 --> 01:33:57,933
Fuck you.

2695
01:33:58,033 --> 01:33:58,934
Say your name.

2696
01:33:59,034 --> 01:33:59,802
Steve Ramsey.

2697
01:33:59,902 --> 01:34:00,635
Fuck off.

2698
01:34:00,736 --> 01:34:01,436
Aaron.

2699
01:34:01,536 --> 01:34:02,771
Double fuck you.

2700
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:04,239
We're all gone.

2701
01:34:04,339 --> 01:34:07,442
But then the issue kept
coming up in production.

2702
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:09,477
And then we had to
use another location.

2703
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,246
It should have been
our option to shoot

2704
01:34:11,346 --> 01:34:13,281
In here if we wanted to.

2705
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:15,718
And I think he really
overstepped his boundaries.

2706
01:34:15,818 --> 01:34:17,853
He caused, like, this
panic [inaudible] where

2707
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:20,255
There was no cause for that.

2708
01:34:20,355 --> 01:34:23,291
And he sucks.

2709
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:24,559
We'll give our name, but--

2710
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,362
But I will not have three
testicles for lead paint.

2711
01:34:27,462 --> 01:34:30,833
But I was saddened when
actually some of our crew

2712
01:34:30,933 --> 01:34:34,002
Left on a major-- there
was a big day, where, like,

2713
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:34,903
About 20 people left.

2714
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,847
So what happened
today that was so--

2715
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:55,457
That thing in there.

2716
01:34:55,557 --> 01:34:56,258
Oh, really?

2717
01:34:59,828 --> 01:35:02,697
You have to fire that other
guy when he gets back.

2718
01:35:02,798 --> 01:35:03,698
[Laugh]

2719
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:14,476
Dan, you're coming back, right?

2720
01:35:14,576 --> 01:35:18,280
It had a major impact on,
I think, the rest of us.

2721
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,647
It made us stronger in the end.

2722
01:35:19,748 --> 01:35:23,185
But on that day,
I think morale--

2723
01:35:23,285 --> 01:35:24,853
Which is a word that
I tend not to use--

2724
01:35:24,953 --> 01:35:25,653
Was at an all-time low.

2725
01:35:33,195 --> 01:35:35,430
Yeah, I guess it was Julia.

2726
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:37,332
She was office coordinator.

2727
01:35:37,432 --> 01:35:38,533
She got fired.

2728
01:35:55,317 --> 01:35:57,886
That worked out.

2729
01:35:57,986 --> 01:35:58,821
That was great.

2730
01:35:58,921 --> 01:36:00,856
I've never seen so much crying.

2731
01:36:00,956 --> 01:36:02,524
WOMAN: Yeah, crying all around.

2732
01:36:02,624 --> 01:36:04,893
Every time I go out,
there's somebody else crying.

2733
01:36:10,398 --> 01:36:12,500
So humiliating.

2734
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,636
INTERVIEWER: Still love Troma?

2735
01:36:14,736 --> 01:36:17,472
--[laughs] Not the
time to ask me that.

2736
01:36:25,547 --> 01:36:27,382
[Laughter]

2737
01:36:27,482 --> 01:36:28,683
LLOYD KAUFMAN: She
didn't get fired.

2738
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:29,251
She quit.

2739
01:36:29,351 --> 01:36:30,085
INTERVIEWER: Ah.

2740
01:36:30,185 --> 01:36:31,920
No, Patrick says she got fired.

2741
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:32,720
No, no.

2742
01:36:32,821 --> 01:36:36,224
I mean, unless he fired her.

2743
01:36:36,324 --> 01:36:38,026
No, she just had too much.

2744
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,061
She quit.

2745
01:36:39,161 --> 01:36:40,028
She was driven off.

2746
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,596
I think Julia just quit.

2747
01:36:41,696 --> 01:36:42,597
She quit.

2748
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:48,603
HEIDI SJURSEN: Here, my
dad wants to talk to you.

2749
01:37:02,617 --> 01:37:05,053
INTERVIEWER: Oh, it's
one of the ex-employees,

2750
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:08,556
One of the 30% that left.

2751
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:09,724
What are you going
to do from here?

2752
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:10,525
Where are you going?

2753
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:11,726
The smart 30%.

2754
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:13,095
INTERVIEWER: Were are you
going from here, Aaron?

2755
01:37:13,195 --> 01:37:14,262
I'm going down to Florida.

2756
01:37:14,362 --> 01:37:15,163
Then I'm going to Virginia.

2757
01:37:15,263 --> 01:37:16,164
Then I'm going to Cali.

2758
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:17,832
Then I'm going to Australia.

2759
01:37:17,933 --> 01:37:19,134
INTERVIEWER: You're
going to Australia?

2760
01:37:19,234 --> 01:37:20,535
Australia for Christmas.

2761
01:37:20,635 --> 01:37:22,670
INTERVIEWER: Well, if you had
to sum up your experience here,

2762
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:23,705
What would you say?

2763
01:37:23,805 --> 01:37:25,207
It was very much a
learning experience.

2764
01:37:25,307 --> 01:37:26,374
INTERVIEWER: A
learning experience?

2765
01:37:26,474 --> 01:37:30,045
Yeah, you learn a
lot of shit here.

2766
01:37:30,145 --> 01:37:31,513
INTERVIEWER: So is that
positive or negative?

2767
01:37:31,613 --> 01:37:33,281
You seem kind of frazzled.

2768
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:34,782
I was very frazzled.

2769
01:37:34,883 --> 01:37:37,285
You weren't getting
[inaudible] here.

2770
01:37:37,385 --> 01:37:38,286
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, well.

2771
01:37:38,386 --> 01:37:39,087
It's all good.

2772
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:40,355
Salute off.

2773
01:37:40,455 --> 01:37:41,223
Goodbye, young sir.

2774
01:37:41,323 --> 01:37:42,024
Goodbye.

2775
01:37:42,124 --> 01:37:43,491
Goodbye.

2776
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:49,264
But then, after we fired
Aaron, we hired him back again

2777
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:50,432
As a still photographer.

2778
01:37:50,532 --> 01:37:52,935
And I heard all his
pictures are out of focus.

2779
01:37:53,035 --> 01:37:54,970
INTERVIEWER: So wait, where
are we filming now, though?

2780
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:57,205
Oh, we decided to shoot
inside Toxie's shack

2781
01:37:57,305 --> 01:37:58,306
And make it Noxie's shock.

2782
01:37:58,406 --> 01:37:59,807
We're hanging up a a
couple different signs.

2783
01:37:59,908 --> 01:38:01,243
"We're in [inaudible]."

2784
01:38:01,343 --> 01:38:02,945
And we show him walking in here.

2785
01:38:03,045 --> 01:38:05,813
And when he enters
in here, we're going

2786
01:38:05,914 --> 01:38:07,515
To be in-- it's not gonna work.

2787
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:09,384
INTERVIEWER: It's not gonna
look right, you don't think?

2788
01:38:09,484 --> 01:38:10,452
No.

2789
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:12,487
I mean, Aaron fucked
up the shoot for us.

2790
01:38:12,587 --> 01:38:14,222
INTERVIEWER: So why did you
guys hire him back then?

2791
01:38:16,858 --> 01:38:19,161
Well, he basically--
in order to get back,

2792
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:22,397
He had to ask a couple people.

2793
01:38:22,497 --> 01:38:24,967
He asked Lloyd, who wanted
him back in, for some reason.

2794
01:38:25,067 --> 01:38:28,436
Patrick said OK, under the
condition that he asked me.

2795
01:38:28,536 --> 01:38:31,306
He's like, is there gonna
be-- and I expect an apology.

2796
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:33,408
And even when he came up to
me and he said he apologized,

2797
01:38:33,508 --> 01:38:38,013
I told him that I-- I
told him I didn't care.

2798
01:38:38,113 --> 01:38:39,714
I do not want him back
on this production.

2799
01:38:39,814 --> 01:38:42,250
And I will do everything
possible to make sure that he,

2800
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:45,253
You know, gets fired again.

2801
01:38:45,353 --> 01:38:46,688
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]

2802
01:38:46,788 --> 01:38:48,190
[Laughs] He's a total asshole.

2803
01:38:51,159 --> 01:38:52,160
INTERVIEWER: So
how does it feel?

2804
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:53,395
You pumped?

2805
01:38:53,495 --> 01:38:54,562
No.
INTERVIEWER: No?

2806
01:38:54,662 --> 01:38:55,597
No.
INTERVIEWER: Aw.

2807
01:38:55,697 --> 01:38:56,431
You do the job.

2808
01:38:56,531 --> 01:38:57,532
You get it done, like they say.

2809
01:38:57,632 --> 01:38:59,001
INTERVIEWER: I think
you're doing a good job.

2810
01:38:59,101 --> 01:38:59,934
Well, thank you.

2811
01:39:00,035 --> 01:39:00,768
We try.

2812
01:39:00,868 --> 01:39:02,904
There are no old bold stuntmen.

2813
01:39:03,005 --> 01:39:04,739
You're an old stuntman
or bold stuntman.

2814
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:06,474
I let the audience get excited.

2815
01:39:06,574 --> 01:39:09,978
I try to keep it chill.

2816
01:39:10,078 --> 01:39:12,347
Oh, so you're going far.

2817
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:13,148
Well, yeah.

2818
01:39:13,248 --> 01:39:14,983
So it'll be out.

2819
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:16,284
So I pass over you completely.

2820
01:39:16,384 --> 01:39:17,552
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, I hear you.

2821
01:39:17,652 --> 01:39:19,187
I'm gonna try and see if I
can land right about here.

2822
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:20,022
OK.
All right.

2823
01:39:20,122 --> 01:39:21,323
Fine.

2824
01:39:21,423 --> 01:39:23,291
That way I may be able to
clear your frame altogether.

2825
01:39:23,391 --> 01:39:24,092
Ready.

2826
01:39:24,192 --> 01:39:24,892
Action.

2827
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:36,871
Tito, you're right on
the inside, aren't you?

2828
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,140
Can you get there please?

2829
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,507
Yeah, like that.

2830
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:40,542
And then Toxie--

2831
01:39:40,642 --> 01:39:41,876
INTERVIEWER: Can I
ask you a question?

2832
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,145
Sure.

2833
01:39:43,245 --> 01:39:44,479
INTERVIEWER: Like, why do
you think it's a bad idea

2834
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:45,713
For the actors to just jump?

2835
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:47,215
Every time you put an
actor through anything

2836
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:49,084
That could be risky, you
always [inaudible] actor.

2837
01:39:49,184 --> 01:39:50,518
That's why stuntmen are hired.

2838
01:39:50,618 --> 01:39:51,953
INTERVIEWER: Even for a little--
-[inaudible].

2839
01:39:52,054 --> 01:39:54,089
INTERVIEWER: Even for a little
fall like that, you think?

2840
01:39:54,189 --> 01:39:56,224
Well, they had already
done it six times.

2841
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:58,693
Every time you do it increases
geometrically the chance

2842
01:39:58,793 --> 01:40:00,595
That your lead actor
will be injured

2843
01:40:00,695 --> 01:40:03,065
And the production
will be halted.

2844
01:40:03,165 --> 01:40:05,467
That's why stuntmen do the work.

2845
01:40:05,567 --> 01:40:07,469
Plus, what I did was extended.

2846
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:08,936
They're doing a small jump.

2847
01:40:09,037 --> 01:40:13,075
What I did was extend it over
camera and take it longer.

2848
01:40:13,175 --> 01:40:14,776
You start doing that
with the actors,

2849
01:40:14,876 --> 01:40:17,112
You increase
geometrically the chances

2850
01:40:17,212 --> 01:40:19,381
Of an actor being injured.

2851
01:40:19,481 --> 01:40:21,583
Every single time they
do it, you risk it.

2852
01:40:21,683 --> 01:40:22,384
So--

2853
01:40:22,484 --> 01:40:23,451
INTERVIEWER: All right.

2854
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:24,986
That's why stuntmen
came into existence.

2855
01:40:25,087 --> 01:40:25,787
Thank you.

2856
01:40:25,887 --> 01:40:26,921
MAN: Go to 24.

2857
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:27,722
MAN: Eight.

2858
01:40:27,822 --> 01:40:30,658
Get towards eight.

2859
01:40:30,758 --> 01:40:32,094
Hold on, baby!

2860
01:40:32,194 --> 01:40:33,561
Yeah, I don't want to go.

2861
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:34,529
That's great.

2862
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:36,631
You got to jump.

2863
01:40:36,731 --> 01:40:37,432
Go!

2864
01:40:40,435 --> 01:40:42,337
That was great.

2865
01:40:42,437 --> 01:40:43,671
I think we should give him it.

2866
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:45,607
You know pay him for whatever
the Noxie-- what do we

2867
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:46,741
Have for Noxie?

2868
01:40:46,841 --> 01:40:48,009
300 bucks or something?
-Yeah, we had to pay--

2869
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:49,043
I think he'd appreciate it.

2870
01:40:49,144 --> 01:40:50,912
--stunt doubles
and shit like that.

2871
01:40:51,012 --> 01:40:52,314
Well, that's not David's fault.

2872
01:40:52,414 --> 01:40:54,616
Yeah, it's somebody's
fault. It's not mine.

2873
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:55,850
Well, it's my
fault. I shouldn't

2874
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:58,386
Have hired that fucking
fat load of stuntmen.

2875
01:40:58,486 --> 01:41:00,955
[Laughter]

2876
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,324
2,000 pounds of stunts.

2877
01:41:02,424 --> 01:41:03,725
No, we should have hired--

2878
01:41:03,825 --> 01:41:05,960
INTERVIEWER: Tell us a little
bit about the past couple days

2879
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,195
In Tromaville.

2880
01:41:07,295 --> 01:41:12,734
Well, it's been as life
Tromaville can be, it's been

2881
01:41:12,834 --> 01:41:15,337
Sort of an up and down kind
of thing, some good, some

2882
01:41:15,437 --> 01:41:17,139
Not so good.

2883
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:20,242
Mark Torgl, the original
Melvin was here.

2884
01:41:20,342 --> 01:41:21,909
What's up dude?

2885
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:23,645
INTERVIEWER: Just
recording you for the DVD.

2886
01:41:23,745 --> 01:41:25,347
Can I ask you a few
questions while--

2887
01:41:25,447 --> 01:41:26,348
Sure.

2888
01:41:26,448 --> 01:41:27,649
INTERVIEWER: All right.

2889
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:32,420
So how did you become cast
in the first "Toxic Avenger"

2890
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:33,921
As Melvin?

2891
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:35,523
I was going to NYU.

2892
01:41:35,623 --> 01:41:38,793
It was actually the year
before, for "The First Turn-On."

2893
01:41:38,893 --> 01:41:41,229
And I needed a summer job.

2894
01:41:41,329 --> 01:41:44,065
Or I just want to work
on a film for the summer.

2895
01:41:44,166 --> 01:41:46,901
And somewhere along the
line when we were shooting,

2896
01:41:47,001 --> 01:41:48,903
There was a counselor.

2897
01:41:49,003 --> 01:41:51,706
And the actor that
played her boyfriend, who

2898
01:41:51,806 --> 01:41:54,976
Was supposed to be a
really nerdy guy, quit,

2899
01:41:55,076 --> 01:41:56,911
Like at the very last minute.

2900
01:41:57,011 --> 01:41:58,946
So they were, like,
stuck without an actor

2901
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:01,383
To do this role.

2902
01:42:01,483 --> 01:42:03,351
And they're like, who can
we get to do this role?

2903
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,553
And I happened to be there.

2904
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:09,257
And I said, I'll do it.

2905
01:42:09,357 --> 01:42:11,259
So I played Dwayne in
"The First Turn-On"

2906
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:14,729
And had some really disgusting
scenes with mashed potatoes

2907
01:42:14,829 --> 01:42:19,201
In my hair and cold cuts.

2908
01:42:19,301 --> 01:42:21,169
And it was some
pretty funny stuff,

2909
01:42:21,269 --> 01:42:23,171
I think some of the
best stuff in the movie.

2910
01:42:23,271 --> 01:42:26,941
And the next year, when
they made "Toxic Avenger,"

2911
01:42:27,041 --> 01:42:31,579
I understood that they had
auditioned hundreds of kids

2912
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,015
To try and find
someone to do Melvin.

2913
01:42:34,115 --> 01:42:38,486
And finally, Lloyd said,
why don't we just call Mark?

2914
01:42:38,586 --> 01:42:40,555
And so they called me and
asked me if I wanted to be

2915
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:42,524
Melvin in the Toxic Avenger.

2916
01:42:42,624 --> 01:42:43,958
OK.

2917
01:42:44,058 --> 01:42:44,926
OK.

2918
01:42:45,026 --> 01:42:47,695
And the rest is history.

2919
01:42:47,795 --> 01:42:49,997
INTERVIEWER: Why weren't
you in the second one?

2920
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:50,798
Let's see.

2921
01:42:50,898 --> 01:42:51,633
What happened.

2922
01:42:51,733 --> 01:42:52,767
Oh, yeah.

2923
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:55,370
I wanted $50, and Lloyd
said that was too much.

2924
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:57,004
INTERVIEWER:
[laughs] What was it

2925
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,206
Like working on the first one?

2926
01:42:58,306 --> 01:43:00,242
Was it like it is, like,
when you look around now?

2927
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:01,776
Was it the same conditions?

2928
01:43:01,876 --> 01:43:03,278
Exactly the same.

2929
01:43:03,378 --> 01:43:06,881
Everyone was sleeping
on the floors.

2930
01:43:06,981 --> 01:43:12,254
We used to be fed with Jarlsberg
cheese, three meals a day.

2931
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:14,922
By the end of the movie, we
were all so sick of cheese.

2932
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:17,925
They had, like, five or
six of these big loaves

2933
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:19,594
Of cheese left.

2934
01:43:19,694 --> 01:43:22,364
And the crew all, like,
took these big loaves

2935
01:43:22,464 --> 01:43:24,866
And threw them down
a side of a mountain

2936
01:43:24,966 --> 01:43:26,468
So that we wouldn't
have to eat it anymore.

2937
01:43:26,568 --> 01:43:27,735
But then they were
like, well, sorry.

2938
01:43:27,835 --> 01:43:28,536
There's nothing to eat.

2939
01:43:28,636 --> 01:43:29,737
You guys don't eat.

2940
01:43:29,837 --> 01:43:32,407
MAKEUP ARTIST: Oh, no.

2941
01:43:32,507 --> 01:43:34,141
INTERVIEWER: Do you know
what you'll be doing?

2942
01:43:34,242 --> 01:43:36,478
Any details in the
scene or anything?

2943
01:43:36,578 --> 01:43:39,914
Yeah, I'm coming out of
the mayhem at the big battle

2944
01:43:40,014 --> 01:43:41,283
At the end.

2945
01:43:41,383 --> 01:43:51,092
I'm evolving out of dead Noxie
to become bad, evil Melvin.

2946
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:52,093
All right, we got it.

2947
01:43:52,193 --> 01:43:53,561
So we talked to
David and rehearsed

2948
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:55,663
A little with David down there.

2949
01:43:55,763 --> 01:43:58,232
I think you guys should work
down there with yourselves,

2950
01:43:58,333 --> 01:43:59,267
Just [inaudible].

2951
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:00,902
Yeah, I think it's
better on your own.

2952
01:44:01,002 --> 01:44:03,070
If you want, Trent can
come and work with you.

2953
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:05,873
But I think you guys on
your own would be better.

2954
01:44:05,973 --> 01:44:07,475
MARK: I'd like to
have your opinion.

2955
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:08,810
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
I'll come down when

2956
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,144
You feel you're comfortable.

2957
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:13,881
I just don't to-- I find it's
better if you are allowed

2958
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:15,249
To do it without me there.

2959
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:17,952
Pretty much the
whole scene-- improv.

2960
01:44:18,052 --> 01:44:19,120
So that was kind of cool.

2961
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,822
We had a framework of
what we wanted to do.

2962
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:23,925
And then we just
kind-- we winged it.

2963
01:44:24,025 --> 01:44:25,159
And you can be, like, what?

2964
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:26,361
You know, what are you doing?

2965
01:44:26,461 --> 01:44:28,530
I'm you, you know.

2966
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:31,165
And to the point it's
got to keep progressing,

2967
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:33,301
Where I'm just, like,
doing disgusting things

2968
01:44:33,401 --> 01:44:36,604
And hurting you, even.

2969
01:44:36,704 --> 01:44:41,409
And then at one point, we talked
about hurting you bad enough

2970
01:44:41,509 --> 01:44:43,678
That you drop you mop.

2971
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:48,550
And what it progresses into is
I stick the mop between my legs

2972
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:51,353
And attempt to, like,
buttfuck you with the mop.

2973
01:44:51,453 --> 01:44:52,654
OK.

2974
01:44:52,754 --> 01:44:54,956
INTERVIEWER: That's got to
be the third time this film.

2975
01:44:55,056 --> 01:44:59,060
So how do you like being back
in costume and everything?

2976
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:02,730
It feels like an
old, moldy pair

2977
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:04,632
Of socks-- very comfortable.

2978
01:45:04,732 --> 01:45:06,734
INTERVIEWER: Do you like it?

2979
01:45:06,834 --> 01:45:07,869
I love it.

2980
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:09,303
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]

2981
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:14,976
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Wait a minute.
Don't.

2982
01:45:15,076 --> 01:45:16,077
Hold on.

2983
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:17,278
Come up the stairs,
and we'll do it again.

2984
01:45:17,379 --> 01:45:18,746
[Laughs]

2985
01:45:18,846 --> 01:45:20,181
He needs a mop!

2986
01:45:20,281 --> 01:45:22,149
WOMAN: [inaudible].

2987
01:45:22,249 --> 01:45:23,284
Melvin needs a mop.

2988
01:45:23,385 --> 01:45:24,085
Ready?

2989
01:45:24,185 --> 01:45:25,086
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.

2990
01:45:25,186 --> 01:45:28,490
OK, and action.

2991
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:31,993
Hey, it's Mark Torgl,
everybody, 15 years later.

2992
01:45:32,093 --> 01:45:34,496
[Applause]

2993
01:45:34,596 --> 01:45:36,664
Oh, beautiful.

2994
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:40,602
Hey, how's it going?

2995
01:45:40,702 --> 01:45:41,569
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Mark Torgl.

2996
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:43,104
Oh, ho.

2997
01:45:43,204 --> 01:45:44,506
My heavens.

2998
01:45:44,606 --> 01:45:45,306
Unbelievable.

2999
01:45:45,407 --> 01:45:46,240
[Inaudible].

3000
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,909
History in the
making, everybody.

3001
01:45:48,009 --> 01:45:50,545
The whole idea is so David
doesn't have to be tired.

3002
01:45:50,645 --> 01:45:51,713
No, nobody's saying no.

3003
01:45:51,813 --> 01:45:53,180
But why does he
have to be Hasan?

3004
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,416
Because that's
why I want Hasan.

3005
01:45:54,516 --> 01:45:56,183
I've got to have
the guy's arms, man.

3006
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:59,887
This guy's got to fucking-- it's
little Melvin coming out, man.

3007
01:45:59,987 --> 01:46:00,988
TRENT HAAGA: It
could've been TJ.

3008
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,089
TJ's standing right here.

3009
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:03,357
He just got out, but
we can put him back in.

3010
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:04,392
It has to be Hasan?

3011
01:46:04,492 --> 01:46:05,527
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's
got to be somebody

3012
01:46:05,627 --> 01:46:06,861
With big arms, that's all.

3013
01:46:06,961 --> 01:46:11,899
So it's not-- not-- come on,
folks, use some brains, please.

3014
01:46:11,999 --> 01:46:14,201
In the future, stop
dismissing people.

3015
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:15,770
Like, not so stupid.

3016
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:17,104
They kicked out Hasan.

3017
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:18,305
He was happy to do it.

3018
01:46:18,406 --> 01:46:19,641
I don' understand what
you're trying to tell me.

3019
01:46:19,741 --> 01:46:21,042
We tried to take
the [inaudible]

3020
01:46:21,142 --> 01:46:22,444
Off and put it on TJ anyway.

3021
01:46:22,544 --> 01:46:23,545
TJ--

3022
01:46:23,645 --> 01:46:24,779
But where is Hasan?
I'm just telling you.

3023
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:25,780
We have time.

3024
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:26,914
If he's here, you
can put it on him.

3025
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:29,283
MAN: Toxie had a time conflict.
-Yeah, exactly.

3026
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:30,117
He had a time conflict.

3027
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:30,918
And--

3028
01:46:31,018 --> 01:46:31,753
No, no he didn't.

3029
01:46:31,853 --> 01:46:33,120
He could have been told to come.

3030
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,456
And someone should've
said to me--

3031
01:46:34,556 --> 01:46:36,090
I called and left a
message for him, Lloyd, OK?

3032
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:37,191
Yeah, well now it's too late.

3033
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:39,226
Well, now find somebody
who's got big arms.

3034
01:46:39,326 --> 01:46:41,262
You need to find
somebody with big arms.

3035
01:46:41,362 --> 01:46:42,697
That's all, arms and the mask.

3036
01:46:42,797 --> 01:46:44,899
TJ was just wearing
it, like 30 minutes ago,

3037
01:46:44,999 --> 01:46:45,933
And he took it off.

3038
01:46:46,033 --> 01:46:47,168
Let's put TJ back in it.

3039
01:46:47,268 --> 01:46:48,269
If TJ is willing.

3040
01:46:48,369 --> 01:46:49,904
Well, maybe TJ doesn't
want to go back in.

3041
01:46:50,004 --> 01:46:51,405
[Laughs]

3042
01:46:51,506 --> 01:46:53,441
Lloyd, we got a volunteer.

3043
01:46:53,541 --> 01:46:55,543
Yeah, but it's
got to be big arms.

3044
01:46:55,643 --> 01:46:58,946
If we dress his arms up,
that'd look pretty big, right?

3045
01:46:59,046 --> 01:46:59,947
Yeah, use Miller.

3046
01:47:00,047 --> 01:47:01,483
You don't mind.

3047
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:04,486
What's going on in
terms of David tonight?

3048
01:47:04,586 --> 01:47:06,554
David's got to be in
the reverse of this

3049
01:47:06,654 --> 01:47:08,022
While he talks to them, yeah?

3050
01:47:08,122 --> 01:47:09,423
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Yeah, that's right.

3051
01:47:09,524 --> 01:47:11,192
I'm not striking
anybody out of anything

3052
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:15,563
Ever until we are
totally wrapped, man.

3053
01:47:15,663 --> 01:47:18,466
God dammit, we should just ask
Lloyd what he wants to shoot.

3054
01:47:18,566 --> 01:47:19,801
You know what I mean?

3055
01:47:19,901 --> 01:47:22,136
He changes his mind, his idea.

3056
01:47:22,236 --> 01:47:23,538
Every time we try
to make a plan,

3057
01:47:23,638 --> 01:47:25,306
It gets totally
fucked, because he

3058
01:47:25,406 --> 01:47:26,774
Knows what he wants to shoot.

3059
01:47:26,874 --> 01:47:27,709
He just didn't tell us.

3060
01:47:27,809 --> 01:47:28,843
You mean with this scar thing?

3061
01:47:28,943 --> 01:47:31,412
No, no, I'm not talking to her.

3062
01:47:31,513 --> 01:47:32,213
Look who's here.

3063
01:47:32,313 --> 01:47:34,081
It's a perfect match.

3064
01:47:34,181 --> 01:47:36,518
[Laughter]

3065
01:47:36,618 --> 01:47:39,954
He looks like Mr. T.

3066
01:47:40,054 --> 01:47:42,590
INTERVIEWER: Why did they dress
you up as the Toxic Avenger?

3067
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:44,892
Because I'm the best.

3068
01:47:44,992 --> 01:47:45,993
INTERVIEWER: Really?

3069
01:47:46,093 --> 01:47:47,161
Honestly.

3070
01:47:47,261 --> 01:47:48,730
Because we didn't
have anybody else.

3071
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:50,698
I got to stick my head
through his whole.

3072
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:51,499
INTERVIEWER: Right.

3073
01:47:51,599 --> 01:47:54,201
[Chatter]

3074
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:55,937
So you're gonna be the arms
and the legs, basically.

3075
01:47:56,037 --> 01:47:56,971
Arms and legs.
Well--

3076
01:47:57,071 --> 01:47:58,105
INTERVIEWER: I
mean arms and head.

3077
01:47:58,205 --> 01:47:59,240
Arms and head.

3078
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:01,442
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Gurgle,
twitch, twitch, twitch.

3079
01:48:01,543 --> 01:48:03,477
Gurgle, gurgle, and Mark, mop.

3080
01:48:03,578 --> 01:48:05,346
MAN: Move your arms
a little bit more.

3081
01:48:05,446 --> 01:48:06,581
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Mop,
mop is coming up.

3082
01:48:06,681 --> 01:48:07,882
Good.
Now you, Mark.

3083
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:09,684
Quick.

3084
01:48:09,784 --> 01:48:11,318
Beautiful.

3085
01:48:11,418 --> 01:48:12,119
Good.

3086
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:15,523
Ah, nice.

3087
01:48:15,623 --> 01:48:17,158
Don't put that in
front of your face.

3088
01:48:17,258 --> 01:48:17,959
That's good.

3089
01:48:18,059 --> 01:48:18,926
That thing's good.

3090
01:48:19,026 --> 01:48:20,394
You can put it in your mouth.

3091
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:22,830
Just don't let it
cover your face.

3092
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:24,298
Look up at Melvin.

3093
01:48:24,398 --> 01:48:26,768
You're so happy.

3094
01:48:26,868 --> 01:48:27,569
Melvin!

3095
01:48:27,669 --> 01:48:29,571
Melvin!

3096
01:48:29,671 --> 01:48:30,371
It's you.

3097
01:48:30,471 --> 01:48:31,238
It's me.

3098
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:34,175
[Maniacal laughter]

3099
01:48:35,577 --> 01:48:36,277
It's us!

3100
01:48:36,377 --> 01:48:38,713
It's us, Melvin.

3101
01:48:38,813 --> 01:48:42,650
[Maniacal laughter]
Give me a hug.

3102
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,318
Give me a hug.

3103
01:48:44,418 --> 01:48:45,286
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.
Cut.

3104
01:48:45,386 --> 01:48:46,387
Good.
OK.

3105
01:48:46,487 --> 01:48:47,188
[Laughter]

3106
01:48:47,288 --> 01:48:48,990
[Cheering and applause]

3107
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:53,427
INTERVIEWER: How did you
like coming out of Noxie?

3108
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:57,364
It was beautiful,
beautiful experience

3109
01:48:57,464 --> 01:48:58,633
INTERVIEWER: Was
it like a rebirth?

3110
01:48:58,733 --> 01:49:00,001
Absolutely.
[set chatter]

3111
01:49:00,101 --> 01:49:05,406
I was reborn, reborn as Melvin.

3112
01:49:05,506 --> 01:49:06,340
I think we're out.

3113
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,474
We're done.

3114
01:49:07,575 --> 01:49:08,743
Mark, yay.

3115
01:49:08,843 --> 01:49:10,712
Mark Torgl.

3116
01:49:10,812 --> 01:49:13,615
[Applause]

3117
01:49:13,715 --> 01:49:14,616
Beautiful. [inaudible].

Mark Torgl.

3119
01:49:15,983 --> 01:49:18,519

history, movie history.

3120
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:19,987
MAN: Give him a hug again.

3121
01:49:20,087 --> 01:49:21,322
[Inaudible].

3122
01:49:21,422 --> 01:49:22,123
MAN: Slime him gain.

3123
01:49:22,223 --> 01:49:25,660
He's getting his revenge.

3124
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:26,628
Ew.

3125
01:49:26,728 --> 01:49:28,963
[Laughter]

3126
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:29,997
This is Hank.

3127
01:49:30,097 --> 01:49:31,165
Do you guys know each other?

3128
01:49:31,265 --> 01:49:32,399
Corey Feldman.

3129
01:49:32,499 --> 01:49:33,334
How are you?

3130
01:49:33,434 --> 01:49:34,301
How you doing?

3131
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:35,536
Love your work.

3132
01:49:35,637 --> 01:49:37,672
LLOYD KAUFMAN: This is Cat,
your assistant director.

3133
01:49:37,772 --> 01:49:38,740
Hi, nice to meet you.

3134
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:39,941
And Trent Haaga
wrote the script.

3135
01:49:40,041 --> 01:49:42,476
And he stars in "Terror
Firmer," the perhaps

3136
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:46,480
New movie from Troma, on which
Brendan Flynt was the DP.

3137
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,883
And he's now DP on this movie.

3138
01:49:48,983 --> 01:49:49,684
Troma, yeah.

3139
01:49:49,784 --> 01:49:50,618
COREY FELDMAN: I love you.

3140
01:49:50,718 --> 01:49:51,986
I love it.

3141
01:49:52,086 --> 01:49:53,821
[Chatter]

3142
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:55,923
This guy here, whatever his
name is, this actor person--

3143
01:49:56,023 --> 01:49:56,924
Is he on an hourly thing--

3144
01:49:57,024 --> 01:49:57,859
No.

3145
01:49:57,959 --> 01:49:58,760
--where we have
to get rid of him.

3146
01:49:58,860 --> 01:49:59,827
We got him all day?

3147
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:01,328
No, he's getting a
flat rare for the day.

3148
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:02,830
So it's not-- when does it end?

3149
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:03,898
That's what I want to know.

3150
01:50:03,998 --> 01:50:05,099
Is it an eight-hour
day, a six-hour day?

3151
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:06,233
It just says for the day--

3152
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:07,168
12-hour?

3153
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:09,871
--the day of in
his contract, so.

3154
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:12,306
Just make sure that we're
not gonna be told at 4 o'clock

3155
01:50:12,406 --> 01:50:13,274
That we have to stop.

3156
01:50:13,374 --> 01:50:14,709
No, we're not.
MAN: How you doing?

3157
01:50:14,809 --> 01:50:15,509
How you doing?

3158
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:16,543
MAN: Good.
-Dave?

3159
01:50:16,644 --> 01:50:17,979
How are you?
Nice to meet you.

3160
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:19,113
A little warm in that makeup?

3161
01:50:19,213 --> 01:50:20,014
Oh, yeah.

3162
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:22,817
It looks fun, I
got to tell you.

3163
01:50:22,917 --> 01:50:24,251
Can you hear in that?

3164
01:50:24,351 --> 01:50:25,152
DAVE MATTEY: It's hard.

3165
01:50:25,252 --> 01:50:26,287
I hear through it.
-Yeah.

3166
01:50:26,387 --> 01:50:27,521
Muffled, right?

3167
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:28,890
DAVE MATTEY: Yeah.

3168
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:34,095
And it's sealed, so I can't
even hear, like, out of spaces.

3169
01:50:34,195 --> 01:50:36,463
I have no depth
perception at all.

3170
01:50:36,563 --> 01:50:37,564
Cool.
Exciting.

3171
01:50:37,665 --> 01:50:38,365
Yeah.

3172
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:40,234
It's [inaudible] like that.

3173
01:50:40,334 --> 01:50:42,136
COREY FELDMAN: Yeah.

3174
01:50:42,236 --> 01:50:44,872
Doing like an action
sequence in the dark.

3175
01:50:44,972 --> 01:50:45,873
All right.

3176
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:46,808
I need to get out
of the heat, man.

3177
01:50:46,908 --> 01:50:48,042
It's too hot out here.

3178
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:48,843
[Inaudible].

3179
01:50:48,943 --> 01:50:49,944
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do that again.

3180
01:50:50,044 --> 01:50:51,378
Just do that line again, Hank.
Do it again.

3181
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:52,479
Ready?
-Which part?

3182
01:50:52,579 --> 01:50:53,781
LLOYD KAUFMAN: "Go
back to Tromaville."

3183
01:50:53,881 --> 01:50:55,983
And "All right, you go
back to Tromaville." ready?

3184
01:50:56,083 --> 01:50:57,218
And action.

3185
01:50:57,318 --> 01:50:59,353
All right, you can
go back to Tromaville.

3186
01:50:59,453 --> 01:51:00,822
Just remember, though--

3187
01:51:00,922 --> 01:51:02,790
Trent is totally
losing his mind.

3188
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:05,727
Trent is totally losing
his mind on this set.

3189
01:51:05,827 --> 01:51:09,163
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Start from
"yeah, you can go home."

3190
01:51:09,263 --> 01:51:16,503
"All right, you can
go home." [inaudible].

3191
01:51:16,603 --> 01:51:17,671
Whatever [inaudible].

3192
01:51:17,772 --> 01:51:18,472
Yeah.

3193
01:51:18,572 --> 01:51:19,440
MAN: OK.

3194
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:20,942
[Inaudible].

3195
01:51:21,042 --> 01:51:22,777
You shouldn't have
spoken to them.

3196
01:51:22,877 --> 01:51:24,746
All right, let's go.

3197
01:51:24,846 --> 01:51:25,713
Come on.

3198
01:51:25,813 --> 01:51:27,148
TRENT HAAGA: [laughs]

3199
01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:30,151
That's nice, man.

3200
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:37,324
INTERVIEWER: I just
don't understand.

3201
01:51:37,424 --> 01:51:39,293
MAN: Let's make
sure the rope length

3202
01:51:39,393 --> 01:51:41,395
Matches what was shot before.

3203
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,934
INTERVIEWER: So what
might happen to this?

3204
01:51:47,034 --> 01:51:49,136
TIM: Uh, it might get road rash.

3205
01:51:49,236 --> 01:51:50,104
Road rash.

3206
01:51:50,204 --> 01:51:52,673
INTERVIEWER: Will it shatter?

3207
01:51:52,774 --> 01:51:54,541
No, I don't think
it'll shatter.

3208
01:51:54,641 --> 01:51:57,511
[Scraping]

3209
01:52:00,614 --> 01:52:01,515
(MEXICAN ACCENT) Hey, ese.

3210
01:52:01,615 --> 01:52:02,483
Man, you look kind of funny.

3211
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:03,985
You look pale today, huh?

3212
01:52:04,085 --> 01:52:04,986
It was the cerveza.

3213
01:52:05,086 --> 01:52:08,990
It's a hangover, I know.

3214
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:11,959
[Chatter]

3215
01:52:13,961 --> 01:52:15,496
INTERVIEWER: So why's
everyone wearing sombreros?

3216
01:52:15,596 --> 01:52:17,598
It's the heat, man, the sun.

3217
01:52:17,698 --> 01:52:19,633
We've already been standing
out here for a long time.

3218
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,102
We don't want to get burnt.

3219
01:52:21,202 --> 01:52:22,269
Hola.

Mark.

3222
01:52:23,971 --> 01:52:27,508

3224
01:52:34,015 --> 01:52:36,583
I love black people
Don't hurt me, please.

3225
01:52:36,683 --> 01:52:37,384
Please!

3226
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:40,487
I love black-- ah!

3227
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,189
INTERVIEWER: What are you
guys gonna be doing here?

3228
01:52:42,289 --> 01:52:43,557
What's the stunt?

3229
01:52:43,657 --> 01:52:46,660
Well, we're pulling the actor
along for a closeup of being

3230
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,628
Dragged behind the truck.

3231
01:52:47,728 --> 01:52:49,096
And we also have
the dummy to match.

3232
01:52:49,196 --> 01:52:51,765
And this is for the close-up
of the actual actor,

3233
01:52:51,866 --> 01:52:55,970
To be able to match into it,
so that they have the three

3234
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:58,239
Choices-- actor,
stunt man, and dummy--

3235
01:52:58,339 --> 01:52:59,640
To cut back and forth with.

3236
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:06,680
[Screaming]

3237
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,748
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

3238
01:53:07,849 --> 01:53:09,650
He heard don't-- all
he heard was let go.

3239
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:11,118
Let's just don't analyze it.

3240
01:53:11,218 --> 01:53:11,919
Do it again.

3241
01:53:12,019 --> 01:53:13,120
Let's just do it again.

3242
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,221
BRENDAN FLYNT: I didn't
want to let him go early

3243
01:53:14,321 --> 01:53:15,456
Because I wasn't ready.

3244
01:53:15,556 --> 01:53:17,458
MAN: I know, but he's
screaming, so he heard the--

3245
01:53:17,558 --> 01:53:19,093
BRENDAN FLYNT: Well, why
does he have to scream?

3246
01:53:19,193 --> 01:53:20,027
He doesn't have to
scream this time.

3247
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:20,794
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Fine,
he won't scream.

3248
01:53:20,895 --> 01:53:21,829
Just show your mouth open.

3249
01:53:21,929 --> 01:53:22,897
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's go!

3250
01:53:22,997 --> 01:53:24,231
BRENDAN FLYNT: --so
he can hear me, OK?

3251
01:53:24,331 --> 01:53:25,967
Lloyd, we're ready
to go with this.

3252
01:53:26,067 --> 01:53:27,368
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK,
we got one more take,

3253
01:53:27,468 --> 01:53:29,937
Then we're going down
to the makeup on Mitch.

3254
01:53:30,037 --> 01:53:32,173
Mitch Cohen, the original
Toxic Avenger, was here.

3255
01:53:32,273 --> 01:53:33,740
We got to chat a bit.

3256
01:53:33,841 --> 01:53:35,642
And pretty much the
budgets have gotten lower.

3257
01:53:35,742 --> 01:53:37,979
The boobie count
has gotten higher.

3258
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:41,115
Evidently, they're paying
actors less than they did then.

3259
01:53:41,215 --> 01:53:44,051
Pretty hard to
imagine, but they are.

3260
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:45,419
[Motor running]

3261
01:53:45,519 --> 01:53:47,454
It's all good, Lloyd

3262
01:53:47,554 --> 01:53:49,656
DAVE MATTEY: Basically,
drag him out of the car,

3263
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:52,426
Bash his face into
the engine, and then

3264
01:53:52,526 --> 01:53:54,528
Throw him into a KKK rally.

3265
01:54:00,467 --> 01:54:03,537
There are definitely things that
have gotten worse, like my skin

3266
01:54:03,637 --> 01:54:04,538
And that kind of stuff.

3267
01:54:04,638 --> 01:54:06,540
There have been
things that we've done

3268
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,742
That have been a lot of fun.

3269
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:10,945
Me and Paul did the fight.

3270
01:54:11,045 --> 01:54:13,380
We did our fight upstairs.

3271
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:19,086
And it took a while, but I
think it's gonna look awesome.

3272
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:20,787
Now, question about
the art department.

3273
01:54:20,888 --> 01:54:23,157
This place, it looks
so clean in here.

3274
01:54:23,257 --> 01:54:24,591
Are we gonna put a
lot of blood around?

3275
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:25,726
WOMAN: We have blood.

3276
01:54:25,826 --> 01:54:26,928
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I won't
have to keep it there.

3277
01:54:27,028 --> 01:54:28,095
But we should defintely--
it seems like this stuff

3278
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:29,296
Could be bloodied up.

3279
01:54:33,634 --> 01:54:34,902

light a little bit.

DAVE MATTEY: And
this guy, this guy

3282
01:54:40,607 --> 01:54:42,443
Is the Boba Fett of this movie.

3283
01:54:42,543 --> 01:54:43,911
I think we're gonna get
done with the movie,

3284
01:54:44,011 --> 01:54:46,680
And they're gonna go-- the stuff
they're gonna talk about are

3285
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:48,582
Things like [inaudible]
head coming out

3286
01:54:48,682 --> 01:54:50,484
Of his ass and evil Kabukiman.

3287
01:55:00,494 --> 01:55:02,363
So instead of just like
coming for his stomach,

3288
01:55:02,463 --> 01:55:04,431

bit to the side.

01:55:04,531 --> 01:55:05,366
-Right.
-Over there.

3290
01:55:05,466 --> 01:55:06,300
OK.

3291
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,035
And it should play
for that camera.

3292
01:55:08,135 --> 01:55:10,037
Over to this side, just
to fudge the uppercut.

3293
01:55:10,137 --> 01:55:10,837
Boom.

3294
01:55:10,938 --> 01:55:13,274
And uppercut over here.

3295
01:55:13,374 --> 01:55:14,241
Pow.

3296
01:55:14,341 --> 01:55:15,242
MAN: Wow.

3297
01:55:15,342 --> 01:55:16,277
So just cheat it.

3298
01:55:16,377 --> 01:55:17,678
Cheat it over to the
side a little bit.

3299
01:55:17,778 --> 01:55:19,146
With the hair.

3300
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:22,216
[Fighting sounds]

3301
01:55:23,150 --> 01:55:25,286
And camera!

3302
01:55:25,386 --> 01:55:26,687
CAT: Rolling.
-Rolling.

3303
01:55:26,787 --> 01:55:27,621
Action.

3304
01:55:27,721 --> 01:55:31,425
[Fighting sounds]

3305
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,528
[Shouting]

3306
01:55:37,064 --> 01:55:39,066
MAN: So it's gonna
be an awesome fight.

3307
01:55:39,166 --> 01:55:42,569
And Paul is good.

3308
01:55:42,669 --> 01:55:44,238
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Come on in
and meet Joe Fleishaker.

3309
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:46,540
He's kind of
Troma's action star.

3310
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,674
He's been in about five--

3311
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:48,809
Hi.

3312
01:55:48,909 --> 01:55:49,776
LLOYD KAUFMAN: How many
Troma movies have you--

3313
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:50,677
JOE FLEISHAKER: This
is number seven.

3314
01:55:50,777 --> 01:55:52,113
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Seventh, wow.

3315
01:55:52,213 --> 01:55:53,580
We met each other
when we were doing

3316
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:54,715
A movie called "Troma's War."

3317
01:55:54,815 --> 01:55:55,516
REPORTER: OK.

3318
01:55:55,616 --> 01:55:56,783
And it's Joe Fleishen?

3319
01:55:56,883 --> 01:55:57,851
Fleishaker.

3320
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:01,722
F-L-E-I-S-H-A-K-E-R.
It's not big bucks.

3321
01:56:01,822 --> 01:56:02,956
It's--

3322
01:56:03,057 --> 01:56:04,291
REPORTER: I think you're
doing it for the love of it.

3323
01:56:04,391 --> 01:56:05,892
For the love of it.
Oh, it has to be.

3324
01:56:05,993 --> 01:56:07,661
If you don't have the love
of it, you can't do this.

3325
01:56:07,761 --> 01:56:09,230
'Cause the stuff that
I did in this movie

3326
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:10,831
Were pretty, pretty wild stuff.

3327
01:56:10,931 --> 01:56:12,566
There was something about
the cum on your face, Joe.

3328
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:13,667
JOE FLEISHAKER: Oh, yeah.
Oh.

3329
01:56:13,767 --> 01:56:14,501
Yeah, yeah.
JOE FLEISHAKER: It'll look good.

3330
01:56:14,601 --> 01:56:15,902
Has anybody seen the footage?

3331
01:56:16,003 --> 01:56:17,071
MAN: Yeah yeah.
It looks great.

3332
01:56:17,171 --> 01:56:18,572
They say not only
is Joe Fleishaker

3333
01:56:18,672 --> 01:56:21,075
An amazing actor, he's
one fine cock sucker.

3334
01:56:21,175 --> 01:56:22,476
JOE FLEISHAKER: Fellatio Joe.

3335
01:56:22,576 --> 01:56:23,977
[Laughter]

3336
01:56:24,078 --> 01:56:24,911
MAN: Was it mayonnaise?

3337
01:56:25,012 --> 01:56:25,879
JOE FLEISHAKER: Yeah.

3338
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:28,382
MAN: We're loading Joe.

3339
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:29,950
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Joe is armed.

3340
01:56:30,051 --> 01:56:32,953
Action!

3341
01:56:33,054 --> 01:56:35,456
[Groaning]

3342
01:56:41,562 --> 01:56:43,564
It's a little weird to
just take it straight.

3343
01:56:43,664 --> 01:56:46,700
But I used to eat it
straight sometimes.

3344
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,171
This is my brand, so-- I ain't
no fucking Miracle Whip guy.

3345
01:56:50,271 --> 01:56:51,138
Forget about it.

3346
01:56:51,238 --> 01:56:54,808
The real, real mayonnaise.

3347
01:56:54,908 --> 01:56:56,110
As I said to
everybody, the reason

3348
01:56:56,210 --> 01:56:57,744
Why I wasn't really that
good at spitting it out

3349
01:56:57,844 --> 01:56:59,046
Is because I usually swallow.

3350
01:56:59,146 --> 01:57:00,647
[Laughter]

3351
01:57:00,747 --> 01:57:01,448
That's what I heard.

3352
01:57:01,548 --> 01:57:02,449
That's what I heard.

3353
01:57:02,549 --> 01:57:03,517
JOE FLEISHAKER: Yeah.

3354
01:57:03,617 --> 01:57:05,952
That is what I heard
from Michael Herst.

3355
01:57:06,053 --> 01:57:07,321
[Laughter]

3356
01:57:07,421 --> 01:57:10,757
We just did today the big
romantic reunion scene.

3357
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:11,958
WOMAN: Aw.

3358
01:57:12,059 --> 01:57:15,028
JOE FLEISHAKER: It was
quite, quite [audio out].

3359
01:57:15,129 --> 01:57:15,962
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action.

3360
01:57:16,063 --> 01:57:16,963
WOMAN: Ooh.

3361
01:57:17,064 --> 01:57:17,998
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
no don't do that.

3362
01:57:18,099 --> 01:57:19,133
Work it, kind of.
WOMAN: Ooh.

3363
01:57:19,233 --> 01:57:20,501
LLOYD KAUFMAN: That's it.
That's it.

3364
01:57:20,601 --> 01:57:21,402
And then do your fingers.

3365
01:57:21,502 --> 01:57:23,003
WOMAN: Ooh, ooh, oh.

3366
01:57:23,104 --> 01:57:25,206
Ooh, ooh, mm, ee, oh.

3367
01:57:25,306 --> 01:57:26,307
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, good.

3368
01:57:26,407 --> 01:57:27,308
WOMAN: [moaning]

3369
01:57:27,408 --> 01:57:28,942
MAN: Slow.

3370
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:29,976
Whoa.

3371
01:57:30,077 --> 01:57:31,112
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Play
it straight, Joe.

3372
01:57:31,212 --> 01:57:31,912
Real.

3373
01:57:32,012 --> 01:57:33,547
You're really in ecstasy.

3374
01:57:33,647 --> 01:57:34,348
Lower your chin.

3375
01:57:34,448 --> 01:57:35,216
Lower your chin, Joe.

3376
01:57:35,316 --> 01:57:36,350
MAN: Down.
Lower your chin.

3377
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:37,384
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Lower your chin.

3378
01:57:37,484 --> 01:57:38,419
That's it.

3379
01:57:38,519 --> 01:57:39,820
OK.

3380
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,555
Now start doing what you did in
the scene, Heidi, kissing him.

3381
01:57:41,655 --> 01:57:42,689
Oh.

3382
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:44,425
[Moaning]

3383
01:57:44,525 --> 01:57:45,692
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Go low.
-Mm, baby.

3384
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:47,128
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Go down
his stomach, please.

3385
01:57:47,228 --> 01:57:48,995
Kiss down his stomach.

3386
01:57:49,096 --> 01:57:50,231
Can you see it?

3387
01:57:50,331 --> 01:57:52,766
Keep going down a little
bit so we can see his face.

3388
01:57:52,866 --> 01:57:53,967
Mm.

3389
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:55,602
Love it, ooh.

3390
01:57:55,702 --> 01:57:58,972
Yummy, oh.

3391
01:57:59,072 --> 01:57:59,940
Oh.

3392
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,375
[Inaudible]

3393
01:58:01,475 --> 01:58:03,177
LLOYD KAUFMAN: See
her hands, Brendan?

3394
01:58:03,277 --> 01:58:04,145
Cut.
Perfect.

3395
01:58:04,245 --> 01:58:04,945
MAN: Beautiful.

3396
01:58:05,045 --> 01:58:05,779
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Very good.

3397
01:58:05,879 --> 01:58:06,647
Thank you.

3398
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:08,115
Do that conversation you had.

3399
01:58:08,215 --> 01:58:09,716
I was always
[inaudible] slutty girl.

3400
01:58:09,816 --> 01:58:12,519
When I was in high school, I did
30 miles a day on the bicycle.

3401
01:58:12,619 --> 01:58:14,955
I used to cut class and
go to play basketball.

3402
01:58:15,055 --> 01:58:17,458
But I used to eat
enormous amounts of food.

3403
01:58:17,558 --> 01:58:21,328
A typical day, I would have
three loaves of Italian bread,

3404
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:22,896
Couple of boxes of donuts.

3405
01:58:22,996 --> 01:58:25,532
I used to drink Pepsi
by the quart an hour.

3406
01:58:25,632 --> 01:58:26,600
But I worked.

3407
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:28,302
I did so much exercise
it didn't matter.

3408
01:58:28,402 --> 01:58:29,870
Once I got to
college and I started

3409
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:32,606
Doing less time for exercise,
I started gaining wait.

3410
01:58:32,706 --> 01:58:35,476
Before you knew it,
I was too big to play

3411
01:58:35,576 --> 01:58:36,910
The sports I was doing.

3412
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:38,212
The bicycle couldn't
handle me anymore.

3413
01:58:38,312 --> 01:58:40,447
And then it just-- I
never did stop the eating.

3414
01:58:40,547 --> 01:58:41,248
Uh-huh.

3415
01:58:41,348 --> 01:58:42,549
But I always ate a lot.

3416
01:58:42,649 --> 01:58:44,117
But I also worked a lot.

3417
01:58:44,218 --> 01:58:46,587
Now, I, you know-- now
I don't work that hard.

3418
01:58:46,687 --> 01:58:50,391
Now I sit at a desk and, you
know, play with my fingers.

3419
01:58:50,491 --> 01:58:51,858
My fingers are trim.

3420
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:52,659
[Laughter]

3421
01:58:52,759 --> 01:58:53,694
It's really useful.

3422
01:58:53,794 --> 01:58:55,696
It's kind of sexy.

3423
01:58:55,796 --> 01:58:56,697
He's great.

3424
01:59:00,767 --> 01:59:02,169

01:59:02,269 --> 01:59:03,170

3426
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:05,639
Yes, thank you for coming.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: And remember,
we're on Noxie now.

3431
01:59:31,365 --> 01:59:35,035
The main purpose of this fight
now is to get Noxie's craps

3432
01:59:35,135 --> 01:59:36,437
All over the place.

3433
01:59:36,537 --> 01:59:37,571
SCOTT RHODES: We need somebody
in the art department in here.

3434
01:59:37,671 --> 01:59:39,005
MAN: OK.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Art department!

3435
01:59:39,105 --> 01:59:40,941

the word of the day?

3439
01:59:56,323 --> 01:59:57,291
People, please.

3440
01:59:57,391 --> 01:59:59,360
Hey, I'm not good
at that, Zork.

3441
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:02,829
I'm not good at
defining the word.

3442
02:00:02,929 --> 02:00:05,932
Blood is the word of the day.

3443
02:00:06,032 --> 02:00:07,934
MAN: Today was the gore day.

3444
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:10,504
And it's all about blood.

3445
02:00:10,604 --> 02:00:13,940
It's the big triumphant
massacre before they

3446
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:15,376
Face off with Noxie.

3447
02:00:15,476 --> 02:00:20,080
It's taking slightly longer
than any of us had anticipated.

3448

3460

let's do chin up more.

02:00:40,834 --> 02:00:41,702

gonna happen to you, sir?

3470
02:00:57,918 --> 02:00:59,920
Well, sir, I am
gonna have a broom

Embedded through my spine.

3472
02:01:01,288 --> 02:01:03,156
And it is gonna come
through my stomach,

3473
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:06,860
Therefore creating
blood, guts, and maybe

3474
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,095
Just a little bit of blood.

your fucking mark?

That was ridiculous.

3494

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yes,
now do it right.

3499
02:01:43,196 --> 02:01:45,766
Get close together and just
look at the fucking stuff

3500
02:01:45,866 --> 02:01:47,233
And be scared.

3501
02:01:47,334 --> 02:01:50,303
All right, give me the camera.

3502
02:01:50,404 --> 02:01:51,472
Here we go.

Ready?

3504
02:01:52,839 --> 02:01:54,107
Do not look at the sign.

3505
02:01:54,207 --> 02:01:55,809
You're looking at the carnage.

3506
02:01:55,909 --> 02:01:57,411
Why'd you read the sign?

3507
02:01:57,511 --> 02:01:58,545
Sorry.

look at Tromaville Hospital.

02:02:18,532 --> 02:02:19,232

What the hell is happening?

like, the pool of blood there,

3551

The reflection that it makes?

3552
02:03:15,321 --> 02:03:17,624

shot if they just shot it

I have to say it's a
very, very dedicated group.

3572
02:03:48,989 --> 02:03:56,062
You know, I mean, I really
do believe that it's worth as

3573
02:03:56,162 --> 02:03:59,833
Much as an Oscar to have people
this dedicated to a project,

3574
02:03:59,933 --> 02:04:01,635
Who are just incredibly nice.

3575
02:04:01,735 --> 02:04:03,369
And things are moving along.

And there's quite a
fine film in progress.

3577
02:04:05,138 --> 02:04:07,307

ask for anything more.

we're crashing the car

everybody knows that.

3583
02:04:18,919 --> 02:04:21,321
Brendan, you know we're
going to do the car crashing

3584
02:04:21,421 --> 02:04:23,389
Through the garage tomorrow?

3585
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:26,493
The car is gonna shut off
here and stop about here.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK.

Brendan doesn't want
anyone where Patrick is.

3588
02:04:30,797 --> 02:04:33,834
No, you cannot be there,
nor can Caleb, or that guy,

3589
02:04:33,934 --> 02:04:34,635
Whatever his name is.

3590
02:04:34,735 --> 02:04:36,102
Jared, get out of the frame.

3591
02:04:36,202 --> 02:04:37,137
Why is that?

02:04:37,237 --> 02:04:38,539

feel it's dangerous.

3593
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:39,606
Yes, sir.

Over by the fucking stuff.

3625
02:06:11,064 --> 02:06:13,199
It was exactly where
you all were standing.

I'm like, I think
he missed the mark.

car stopped only about--

Yeah, about like that.

further than what

You thought it was gonna do?

3635
02:06:26,412 --> 02:06:27,781
Yeah, because I put the
sand bags to stop the car.

3636
02:06:27,881 --> 02:06:30,416

that far form the cage,

come into the [inaudible]

3639
02:06:33,553 --> 02:06:34,520
INTERVIEWER: Mhm.

3640
02:06:34,621 --> 02:06:37,023
So because I didn't
feel the sand bags,

3641
02:06:37,123 --> 02:06:40,360
I hit only just maybe a
fraction of a second late.

3642
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:43,063
But that's why, too, 'cause I
knew nobody would be back here.

3643
02:06:43,163 --> 02:06:44,731
And I knew everybody
would be back here.

3644
02:06:44,831 --> 02:06:46,466
So I just wanted
to, like, give them

3645
02:06:46,566 --> 02:06:48,368
As much clearance as possible.

3646
02:06:48,468 --> 02:06:51,437
So I gotta calm down a
little bit right now, man.

3647
02:06:51,537 --> 02:06:52,739
INTERVIEWER: Yeah,
I feel the same way.

3648
02:06:52,839 --> 02:06:53,940
Don't worry.

3649
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:55,776
My heart's about to break
in my chest right now.

3650
02:06:55,876 --> 02:06:56,877
It's fucking-- it's crazy.

3651
02:06:56,977 --> 02:06:58,645
INTERVIEWER: Did you
get scared, Tito?

3652
02:06:58,745 --> 02:06:59,579
A little.

3653
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:00,981
I thought I almost died.

3654
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:01,915
Fucking [inaudible].

3655
02:07:02,015 --> 02:07:03,583
It looked great.

3656
02:07:03,684 --> 02:07:05,786
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, looks
good for, like, the DVD.

3657
02:07:05,886 --> 02:07:07,153
[Inaudible] humans.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

3658
02:07:07,253 --> 02:07:08,221
Oh.
Lloyd.

3659
02:07:08,321 --> 02:07:09,322
Yes, sir?

3660
02:07:09,422 --> 02:07:11,091
Can I get your view
on how that stunt went?

3661
02:07:11,191 --> 02:07:11,892
Um.

3662
02:07:15,128 --> 02:07:19,432
The three rules of production,
Troma's rules of production,

3663
02:07:19,532 --> 02:07:20,834
Were not posted.

3664
02:07:20,934 --> 02:07:24,537
They're not posted here because
we moved back to this location.

3665
02:07:24,637 --> 02:07:29,442
And I think that is the primary
reason why this stunt, while it

3666
02:07:29,542 --> 02:07:34,981
Looked very good on camera, came
very close to killing people.

3667
02:07:35,081 --> 02:07:36,416
I'm not happy.

3668
02:07:36,516 --> 02:07:38,384
I don't think it's worthwhile.

3669
02:07:38,484 --> 02:07:41,154
I don't think that shot
really was worth it.

3670
02:07:41,254 --> 02:07:42,555
And it wasn't really
that good, so--

3671
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:48,528
MAN: There's Aaron afterwards.

3672
02:07:48,628 --> 02:07:51,765
MAN: And action, car.

3673
02:07:51,865 --> 02:07:54,701
[Crash]

3674
02:07:54,801 --> 02:07:57,170
Shit!

3675
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:58,638
That's not good.

3676
02:07:58,739 --> 02:07:59,639
Whoa.

3677
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:01,607
[Chatter]

3678
02:08:01,708 --> 02:08:03,109
I got all that.

3679
02:08:03,209 --> 02:08:04,577
You all right, Aaron?

3680
02:08:04,677 --> 02:08:05,511
Yeah, dude.

3681
02:08:05,611 --> 02:08:06,446
Holy shit.

3682
02:08:06,546 --> 02:08:07,814
CAT: Everyone OK?

3683
02:08:07,914 --> 02:08:09,215
MAN: Yeah!

3684
02:08:09,315 --> 02:08:11,217
Give him a hand there, dude.

3685
02:08:11,317 --> 02:08:17,090
[Chatter]

3686
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:18,491
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
It's not worth it.

3687
02:08:18,591 --> 02:08:20,260
It's only a fucking movie, just
for later in life, that's all.

3688
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:22,162
-Yeah.
-It's only a fucking movie.

3689
02:08:22,262 --> 02:08:23,730
If there's any risk at all.

3690
02:08:23,830 --> 02:08:25,866
I mean, you're the lead
paint guy, for Christ sake.

3691
02:08:25,966 --> 02:08:27,868
That's what I was thinking about
in the middle of the night.

3692
02:08:27,968 --> 02:08:29,135
Here's the lead paint guy.

3693
02:08:29,235 --> 02:08:30,570
The lead paint
thing was bullshit.

3694
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:33,373
The thing you did
was total stupidity.

3695
02:08:33,473 --> 02:08:38,945
And you disobeyed an old man and
an older director/photographer

3696
02:08:39,045 --> 02:08:41,714
And all these professionals who
you should have listened to.

3697
02:08:41,815 --> 02:08:45,718
I honestly didn't-- I really
didn't-- you know, just--

3698
02:08:45,819 --> 02:08:47,553
Nobody thought that
was gonna be a factor.

3699
02:08:47,653 --> 02:08:49,956
Well, no, I thought it
would be, and so did Brendan.

3700
02:08:50,056 --> 02:08:51,024
We cleared everybody out there.

3701
02:08:51,124 --> 02:08:51,858
I made announcements.

3702
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:53,960
We kept making announcements.

3703
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:56,262
And we know there's
always that risk.

3704
02:08:56,362 --> 02:08:57,463
There's always a risk.

3705
02:08:57,563 --> 02:08:58,531
You know, that car, who knows?

3706
02:08:58,631 --> 02:08:59,665
It could have hit something.

3707
02:08:59,766 --> 02:09:01,134
It could have hit
computers that don't work.

3708
02:09:01,234 --> 02:09:02,102
I don't know.

3709
02:09:02,202 --> 02:09:04,037
And again, it's just
a fucking movie.

3710
02:09:04,137 --> 02:09:05,972
That's why you don't
do those things.

3711
02:09:06,072 --> 02:09:07,407
You don't.

3712
02:09:07,507 --> 02:09:09,009
It's just not worth it.

3713
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:11,912
But it's my opinion that
had those signs been up--

3714
02:09:12,012 --> 02:09:14,014
The signs were up today,
like they should have been--

3715
02:09:14,114 --> 02:09:15,849
I think everybody would
have it on their mind

3716
02:09:15,949 --> 02:09:17,583
And would have been a
little more cooperative

3717
02:09:17,683 --> 02:09:19,019
About being anywhere near it.

3718
02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:20,954
So luckily, nothing happened.

3719
02:09:25,892 --> 02:09:27,027
Is Jared here?

3720
02:09:27,127 --> 02:09:27,828
JARED: Yes, sir.

3721
02:09:27,928 --> 02:09:30,196
You have to do a better job.

3722
02:09:30,296 --> 02:09:32,398
This place is a pig sty.

3723
02:09:32,498 --> 02:09:33,834
Look.

3724
02:09:33,934 --> 02:09:36,669
There's glass all over the
place, ready to fall down.

3725
02:09:36,769 --> 02:09:37,670
Look at this filth.

3726
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:39,072
Look at this.

3727
02:09:39,172 --> 02:09:41,942
Why don't you have these guys
like Terrence and Joe Cortese?

3728
02:09:42,042 --> 02:09:43,877
Well, again, you didn't have to.

3729
02:09:43,977 --> 02:09:45,311
But it's nice of you to do it.

3730
02:09:45,411 --> 02:09:46,279
You don't have to do this.

3731
02:09:46,379 --> 02:09:47,747
We'll fire them,
one or the other.

3732
02:09:47,848 --> 02:09:48,714
This is gonna fall down.

3733
02:09:48,815 --> 02:09:50,150
It's been here all day.

3734
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:51,484
It's been smashed.

3735
02:09:51,584 --> 02:09:55,488
This is plastic, but it's--
this has been here all day.

3736
02:09:55,588 --> 02:09:57,057
It's filth, and it's dangerous.

3737
02:09:57,157 --> 02:09:58,992
And that's their job, right?

3738
02:09:59,092 --> 02:10:01,427
So please have Terrence--
or get rid of them.

3739
02:10:01,527 --> 02:10:04,364
We should fire both
of them, I think.

3740
02:10:04,464 --> 02:10:05,798
I mean, no.

3741
02:10:05,899 --> 02:10:09,702
We didn't have coffee.

3742
02:10:09,802 --> 02:10:13,673
I am really happy
about the fact

3743
02:10:13,773 --> 02:10:16,910
That we're gonna do
this scene with Roy

3744
02:10:17,010 --> 02:10:18,078
Winning an Academy Award.

3745
02:10:20,981 --> 02:10:22,582
And Toxie wrapped tonight.

3746
02:10:22,682 --> 02:10:26,152
[Cheering and applause]

3747
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:30,390
The best-- the best
Toxic Avenger ever!

3748
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:31,357
The best!

3749
02:10:35,361 --> 02:10:37,230
Thank you.

3750
02:10:37,330 --> 02:10:39,365
No, seriously, I would not
have been able to do any of it

3751
02:10:39,465 --> 02:10:42,802
Without the fantastic crew that
was here for this entire movie.

3752
02:10:42,903 --> 02:10:45,538
And I really appreciate
everybody getting water

3753
02:10:45,638 --> 02:10:47,440
And running around
like freaks [inaudible]

3754
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:49,609
Doing everything everybody did.

3755
02:10:49,709 --> 02:10:52,112
And seriously, I couldn't
have done it without the crew.

3756
02:10:52,212 --> 02:10:53,079
I mean--

3757
02:10:53,179 --> 02:10:53,880
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah!

3758
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:55,949
Totally a team effort.

3759
02:10:56,049 --> 02:10:58,351
[Applause]

3760
02:11:03,756 --> 02:11:07,994
So it's not even
gonna be Dave Mattey.

3761
02:11:08,094 --> 02:11:09,029
Here we go.

3762
02:11:09,129 --> 02:11:10,063
Ready?

3763
02:11:10,163 --> 02:11:11,031
Action!

3764
02:11:11,131 --> 02:11:14,467
[Crazed laughter]

3765
02:11:18,504 --> 02:11:19,872
You like me.

3766
02:11:19,973 --> 02:11:22,108
You really like me!

3767
02:11:22,208 --> 02:11:23,509
I

3768
02:11:23,609 --> 02:11:27,180
Would like to thank God, Jesus
Christ, the MPAA rating board

3769
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:30,716
For creating this incredibly
historic occasion.

3770
02:11:30,816 --> 02:11:33,987
And now, if we could bow our
heads for a moment of silence

3771
02:11:34,087 --> 02:11:37,390
In honor of all the alcoholic,
crack-addicted, ugly,

3772
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:40,160
Native American unmarried
mothers, and all

3773
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:43,529
The other distasteful minorities
whom the Hollywood elite have

3774
02:11:43,629 --> 02:11:47,200
Banned, blacklisted, whose
property has been taken away,

3775
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:49,069
Who have been
totally fucked over.

3776
02:11:49,169 --> 02:11:51,171
What-- why-- award?

3777
02:11:51,271 --> 02:11:53,039
I don't want this
fu-- fuck this award!

3778
02:11:53,139 --> 02:11:54,774
I don't-- you take it.

3779
02:11:54,874 --> 02:11:56,242
And in fact, you can
take that fucking award

3780
02:11:56,342 --> 02:11:58,811
And shove it up my sweet pooper.

3781
02:11:58,911 --> 02:12:00,746
TRENT HAAGA: Freeze.

3782
02:12:00,846 --> 02:12:03,183
And unfreeze.

3783
02:12:03,283 --> 02:12:05,451
Yeah, Hollywood, we don't
need your fucking awards.

3784
02:12:05,551 --> 02:12:06,252
We're the Troma team!

3785
02:12:06,352 --> 02:12:07,787
Fuck you!

3786
02:12:07,887 --> 02:12:11,724
[Cheering and applause]

3787
02:12:19,265 --> 02:12:22,268
Mr. Trent Haaga will make a
very important announcement.

3788
02:12:22,368 --> 02:12:23,669
[Applause]

3789
02:12:23,769 --> 02:12:26,239
Everyone, everyone,
thank you all very much.

3790
02:12:26,339 --> 02:12:28,641
That has completed principal
photography for "Toxic

3791
02:12:28,741 --> 02:12:30,910
Avenger 4-- Citizen Toxie."

3792
02:12:31,011 --> 02:12:32,412
Thank you Troma!

3793
02:12:32,512 --> 02:12:33,679
PATRICK CASSIDY:
They said the best

3794
02:12:33,779 --> 02:12:37,050
Thing about working on a
movie is the people you meet.

3795
02:12:37,150 --> 02:12:38,784
And the memories that
you take with you

3796
02:12:38,884 --> 02:12:41,421
Are all of those people, not
all the production stuff.

3797
02:12:41,521 --> 02:12:43,423
You do try to block
that out of your memory.

3798
02:12:43,523 --> 02:12:44,924
Because it's the worst part.

3799
02:12:45,025 --> 02:12:46,859
Making the movie is the
actual the worst part

3800
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:48,995
Of making the movie.

3801
02:12:49,095 --> 02:12:51,297
The process of getting
actors, honestly,

3802
02:12:51,397 --> 02:12:53,566
Getting the special
effects ready,

3803
02:12:53,666 --> 02:12:56,036
Getting the stunt people to do
what they're supposed to do,

3804
02:12:56,136 --> 02:12:58,271
Which they never
do-- all that stuff

3805
02:12:58,371 --> 02:13:01,007
Is just fucked up and
hard to deal with.

3806
02:13:01,107 --> 02:13:03,376
So you want to forget
almost immediately.

3807
02:13:03,476 --> 02:13:04,944
And we finished the movie.

3808
02:13:05,045 --> 02:13:08,981
And it's gonna be great, so
that's what the beauty of Troma

3809
02:13:09,082 --> 02:13:13,653
Is-- dedicated individuals
doing hard work for a good cause

3810
02:13:13,753 --> 02:13:17,557
Just to make art,
