You're gonna miss this, right?

Well, I gave it 18 months.

I think that's long enough.

Did you get fired?

230
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,966
I have a variety of reasons.

Seven years, baby.

I moved to Chicago though.

00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:12,789
[speaking in foreign language] Yeah?

552
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:13,874
Some foreigners...

553
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,794
- Pantelis.
- Hi.

554
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,087
- Oh.
- Sorry.

555
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,296
Next time.

556
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,214
Listen, we're here for the van.

557
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,298
There.

558
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,591
Great, I like it.

559
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,301
I need 100 Euros.

560
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,928
- What?
- What?

561
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,721
For the deposit, you know.

562
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,431
But you said it was free on the phone.

563
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:31,641
The van is free.

564
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:32,976
You pay for the damage, you know.

565
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,310
The damage to that?

566
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,354
No, no, no. That makes...

567
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,772
That's true. okay.

568
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,693
40.

569
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:42,694
Do you have...

570
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,698
Here.

571
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:47,615
Okay.

572
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:50,743
It's...

573
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:54,164
It's disgusting.

574
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,210
Let's be roomies.

575
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,211
Let's be roomies.

576
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,672
Oh, hang on.

577
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,094
Hello.

578
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:11,222
All right.

579
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:13,266
What's coming?

580
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,684
- Everything.
- Everything?

581
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,520
- This is all coming?
- Yes.

582
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:20,231
Yeah, but look how neat
it is, it's like perfect.

583
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,191
It's really easy.

584
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,276
What were you gonna do with this stuff

585
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,611
when you were going to America?

586
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,654
Everything was going to America

587
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:29,032
but now I'm not going to America,

588
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,701
everything is going to your house.

589
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,204
What did you think was gonna happen?

590
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,997
I was gonna bring my handbag?

591
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,500
- Yes, of course.
- I have a life here

592
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,251
and it's in these boxes.

593
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:41,753
But this is staying.

594
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:45,089
No, this couch is the only
thing I invested money in

595
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:46,341
in my entire time-

596
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:47,884
- See, that's so troublesome.
- In Athens.

597
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:51,054
We're gonna have our first
really, really big fight.

598
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,180
You wanna fight?

599
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:54,349
- I will fight you-
- Do you wanna fight?

600
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,309
To the death about that couch.

601
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,770
[soft music]

602
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,610
[Chloe giggles]

603
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,019
[phone ringing]

604
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,399
Well, well, I see you're in Athens.

605
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:45,316
What do you know?

606
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,862
[upbeat music]

607
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:01,124
By the way, I've peed in that corner.

608
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,085
My God, I believe that.

609
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,255
I think you've probably peed
in a lot of places around here.

610
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:08,173
Yeah.

611
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,424
It's quite territorial.

612
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,885
Well, I need to find my way home at night.

613
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,355
Come on! [Chloe groans]

614
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,690
Really?

615
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,065
Hey!

616
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,400
Come on!

617
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:31,279
Listen, in this country you have to scream.

618
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:32,655
That's how it is.

619
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,614
- It's not helpful for me.
- I'm going right.

620
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,449
- I don't care, I'm going right.
- It's a dead end.

621
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,409
Oh my God.

622
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,203
Hang on, I'm going right.

623
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,536
- It's a dead end!
- It's not a dead end.

624
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,956
Nothing in Greece is a dead end.

625
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,208
What is it? What is it?

626
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,627
Tell me what it is.

627
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,585
Tell me what it is, Mickey.

628
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:47,795
Tell me what it is.

629
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:48,755
- Tell me what it is.
- It's a dead end.

630
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:49,755
[Chloe] Yeah, it's a dead end.

631
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,007
You know what?

632
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:51,966
You're gonna have to pay the ticket.

633
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,135
Oh my God, what are you doing?

634
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,303
No, no.

635
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:58,014
- We can't do it here.
- Yes we can.

636
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,183
It's too uncomfortable.

637
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:05,730
Sh!

638
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:10,068
[both giggling]

639
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,404
Well, here we are.

640
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,281
Here we are.

641
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,835
All right.

642
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,758
[speaking in foreign
language] Mrs. Kostopoulos.

643
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,051
Very helpful as always.

644
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,137
- All right, okay.
- Good morning.

645
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,471
Good morning.

646
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:43,643
You got it?

647
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:44,644
Oh, fuck.

648
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:01,578
Hey.

649
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:05,081
[Chloe heaving]

650
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,382
Okay.

651
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,926
I know you don't wanna use this room.

652
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,220
I know you wanna keep it the same

653
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,055
so that when he comes
back it's here forever,

654
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,099
and that's everything I
think is great about you.

655
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:27,979
But I think we need to use the room, okay?

656
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,692
It's important to me too, I'm
gonna help you get him back.

657
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:35,570
And he'll be here, and
his room will be here.

658
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:36,488
Okay?

659
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,078
Is that a yes?

660
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:47,540
- Yes.
- It's an okay.

661
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,429
- Come on, oh.
- Stop, hold on.

662
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:02,472
Okay, okay, okay.

663
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,598
Oh, my arm, my arm, my arm.

664
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:05,183
Okay.

665
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,684
I'm sorry.

666
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,436
Hold on, okay.

667
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,437
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

668
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:10,855
- You good?
- Oh, fuck.

669
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,066
- Okay.
- Come on.

670
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:13,983
Oh shit.

671
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:15,652
All right, come on, hold on.

672
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:16,903
Just...

673
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,238
Wait, wait wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

674
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,156
Wait, wait, I got it, hold it.

675
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,283
Okay.

676
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:23,952
Oh fuck.

677
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:25,328
Oh no, no, no.

678
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,579
- Okay, it's okay.
- Easy, okay, okay, okay.

679
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:27,831
- You got it?
- Slowly, slowly.

680
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,749
All right, here's what gonna happen.

681
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,959
I'm gonna go up first a little bit,

682
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,377
I'm gonna bring it up a little bit.

683
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,337
So just hold and stay in place

684
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,131
and then I'm gonna come
and switch with you, okay?

685
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:37,799
- Okay.
- So just wait.

686
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:38,883
[Chloe] Okay.

687
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:39,801
- Fuck!
- Okay, okay.

688
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:41,761
Alright, switch with me, okay?

689
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,888
Switch with me. Go, go, go.

690
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,019
[Chloe] Are you okay?

691
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,437
Yes.

692
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:52,772
- Are you sure?
- Are you holding it?

693
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:53,940
Fuck.

694
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,817
[Chloe] Push it up.

695
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,985
- God.
- Fuck!

696
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:01,030
Okay.

697
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,615
This is your couch, it descends.

698
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,200
I know!

699
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,077
It's like giving birth.

700
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,996
Fuck! Come on.

701
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,581
Oh, shit.

702
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,498
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

703
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:11,416
I'm sorry.

704
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,798
Please don't ruin it.

705
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,352
You wanna know what I think?

706
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:32,270
Tell me.

707
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:35,773
I think we're gonna have to
say goodbye to this thing.

708
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:38,318
No, it's my, the one thing.

709
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:40,904
And I know exactly what to do.

710
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,989
This is the only thing I spent money on.

711
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,325
I know exactly what to do.

712
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:46,242
Oh, no.

713
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,955
We can keep trying.

714
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:51,873
We did.

715
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,877
No, I love this couch.

716
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,295
Hey, hey, hey.

717
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,382
I know.

718
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:02,300
Twice in a day.

719
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:06,137
Perfect.

720
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,473
[Greg] Hey!

721
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:09,891
Hey!

722
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:11,059
What's going on?

723
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:12,769
What's up?

724
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:13,686
Alright.

725
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,606
[speaking in foreign language]
Come on guys, let's go!

726
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:21,569
Oh my God!

727
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:23,571
Yo, easy Mickey!

728
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,698
- We can see you.
- [Mickey] Hello.

729
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:27,242
Wow, who's that guy?

730
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:28,743
This is Greg.

731
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,119
Oh my God.

732
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,079
Oh.

733
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,622
How old is your friend?

734

[Chloe] He looks like a giant baby.

736
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,801
They're gonna be your friends now.

737
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:49,889
I'm so excited about it, that's great.

738
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,229
Okay?

739
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:57,689
More than okay.

[upbeat music] [crowd chattering]

741
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:09,560

[speaking in foreign language] Hey!

You look great.

750

No, you look good.

751
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,396
This is Mickey, guys.

752
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,314
This is the one I was telling you about.

753

- Nice to meet you.
- Very, very special person.

758

Happy fucking birthday.

What is this?

763
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:58,541
This is fucking amazing.

764
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,419
Hey, hey, hey. Listen up for a second.

765
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,837

[crowd cheering]

767
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,258
Well, she's gonna take
over for a little while.

768
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:09,511
So make sure you give her a
little bit of love, all right?

769
00:41:09,594 --> 00:41:12,430
And also, Chloe Gains.

770
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:17,185
I know that today we
lost your favorite couch,

771
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:21,356
but today we gained a family.

772

[crowd cheering]

773
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:26,694

Okay, back up, back up, here we go.

779
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:21,457
Hey!

780
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,709
Back up.

781
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:23,626
It's time.

782
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:25,712
Oh shit.

783
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:27,547
Shit.

784
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:29,507
Oh, shit.

785
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,634
Oh, shit!

786
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:34,637
Give me that, give me that, give me that.

787
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:36,764
You don't want it anymore.

788
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:38,099
It's gonna be, baby, I'm sorry.

789
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:39,100
There you go.

790
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:41,060
Fucking do it.

791
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:44,397
- Whoo!
- This is Kypseli!

792
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,192
[crowd cheering]

793
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,405
Bye bye!

794
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:55,033
[upbeat music]

795
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:07,003
[sirens wailing]

796
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,150
- Fuck, that was crazy.
- Oh, I'm glad.

797
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,902
Everyone is lunatic in Athens.

798
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:34,823
- There you go.
- Oh, thanks.

799
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:36,699
No more couch.

800
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,284
We did it.

801
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:39,911
I can't believe you did that.

802
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,664
It's gonna be all right.

803
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:44,123
It's gonna be okay.

804
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:46,584
You got what you wanted,
that's why it's okay.

805
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:48,294
Thank you for coming.

806
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,921
Ah, you're welcome.

807
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:52,423
I really like that shirt you're wearing.

808
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:53,341
Oh yeah.

809
00:43:53,424 --> 00:43:54,342
This was your band?

810
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:55,260
Yeah, that was...

811
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:56,845
And you had T-shirts?

812
00:43:56,928 --> 00:43:58,721
- We did. Yeah.
- It's a neighborhood

813
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,558
in New Orleans where we did our first gig.

814
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:03,935
- Oh, wow.
- When we were very young.

815
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:06,604
[Bastian] Yeah, and we got a deal...

816
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:07,730
You got a deal.

817
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:09,858
No, we got a deal.

818
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:11,526
- Don't fucking start that.
- You got a deal.

819
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:14,696
And we were just there for the ride.

820
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:17,157
- So tell me what happened.
- What really happened was,

821
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,616
we fucking got our deal.

822
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,369
We made our album, it was fantastic.

823
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:22,579
Okay.

824
00:44:22,662 --> 00:44:24,956
We take the album on tour, right?

825
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:26,583
Tour's amazing as well.

826
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:30,044
Right at the fucking end,
at peak, peak success,

827
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:33,673
this fucking guy, this
Mickey go lucky goes solo.

828
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:35,049
Out of nowhere.

829
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,551
Leaves us hanging.

830
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:40,096
I went to New York because I
didn't really have a choice.

831
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,514
And you were doing

832
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:42,891
- your own thing and you went-
- You had a choice.

833
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:44,058
- And you had your own thing
- Yeah, what else

834
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:45,310
- was I supposed to do.
- Because it was

835
00:44:45,393 --> 00:44:46,561
the Bastian show, and it was great.

836
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:48,062
- We made that band.
- And it was great.

837
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:49,731
You became super famous, you
got like 18 million followers.

838
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:51,399
You're good on Instagram, whatever.

839
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:54,736
Yeah, I had to go make an
album because you fucking left.

840
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:56,738
And I think it's a great album.

841
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:58,823
- It's not the fucking point.
- Come on, I love it.

842
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,200
No. No, fuck you.

843
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:03,244
You know what, he kept
every fucking bad review

844
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:04,329
the band got.

845
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:05,246
Every single one.

846
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,414
Why keep them?

847
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:08,917
'cause I don't, I can't...

848
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,835
- I wanted to improve
- Tell her why.

849
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:11,753
- And I wanted to know...
- Every single one.

850
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:12,962
I wanna know

851
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,130
- what everyone thinks.
- No, you done it

852
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:15,423
because you fucking hate yourself.

853
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:16,966
That's your fucking problem.

854
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,218
That's not, that's not...

855
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:21,805
You are not happy unless you're failing.

856
00:45:21,888 --> 00:45:22,806
- Whoa.
- And that's why

857
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:23,848
you left the band.

858
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:26,059
Wow.

859
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:31,105
So I guess I'll get
happy with another drink,

860
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:32,398
I mean, you know.

861
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,108
- Yeah, fucking get me one.
- Oh no, fuck.

862
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:37,487
Jesus.

863
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,780
I'm gonna put some music on.

864
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:43,868
Okay, put some music on.

865
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:56,131
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

866
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:58,883
What does it fucking look like I'm doing?

867
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:01,636
Oh God, come on, let's go.

868
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:02,804
Grandma's asleep, don't fucking...

869
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:04,430
Come on, let's go, let's go.

870
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:06,015
For fuck's sake.

871
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:24,033
Do you ever think about coming home?

872
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:24,951
No.

873
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:30,123
Why?

874
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:32,083
Why think about it?

875
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:35,920
I think you should come home.

876
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:37,755
Like, people have changed.

877
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:39,632
Hey.

878
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:41,259
Hey, babe.

879
00:46:41,342 --> 00:46:42,177
Hey.

880
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:44,846
Do you wanna...

881
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:46,306
- Do you want some?
- Can you hurry up?

882
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:47,765
I need to pee.

883
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:48,975
Okay, yeah, yeah.

884
00:46:49,058 --> 00:46:50,310
Yeah, we'll be right out.

885
00:46:53,354 --> 00:46:54,189
Fuck.

886
00:46:56,274 --> 00:46:57,275
Anything I said?

887
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:00,737
Oh bug.

888
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:04,115
Are you even serious?

889
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:08,411
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

890
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,456
Like what, met your kid serious?

891
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:13,374
No, no, she hasn't met him yet.

892
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,418
But she's going to, she's...

893
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,299
I got a fucking kid now.

894
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:22,217
- I know.
- What the fuck!

895
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,635
I mean, I saw that.

896
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:26,554
I couldn't believe that.

897
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:29,516
Like, how the fuck have we got kids?

898
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,226
We're getting old.

899
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:34,270
Listen. I think we should
start writing again.

900
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:36,940
Like seriously.

901
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:40,235
I've got fucking six months left.

902
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,113
Come with me. We can
start writing on the road.

903
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:45,073
It will be great.

904
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,661
- No.
- No, look.

905
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:54,207
I'm fucking sick of doing
the same shit over and over.

906
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,501
They sent me to work with
these fucking weird guys

907
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:58,002
in New York, LA.

908
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:59,420
They've got fucking plaques
on the wall, blah, blah, blah.

909
00:47:59,504 --> 00:48:01,422
I work with fucking Maroon 5.

910
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:03,758
We fucking hate Maroon 5.

911
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:05,051
I mean, think about it.

912
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:06,469
[Mickey] All right, yeah.

913
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,471
Like, I miss you.

914
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:10,682
Come with me.

915
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:36,457
Is it true you're only
happy when you're failing?

916
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:38,418
No.

917
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,436
I'm so sorry about that.

918
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,897
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, fine, thank you.

919
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,066
Again, I'm really sorry
we have to do this here.

920
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:46,069
I'm still between offices at the moment.

921
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,028
That's fine.

922
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:48,446
Thank you for squeezing me in.

923
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,282
No problem and I'm really
sorry about the noise.

924
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:53,785
We're both trying to work
from home today, so...

925
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:58,039
Okay, so, the reason that there
was a problem with your J-1

926
00:49:58,122 --> 00:50:00,708
is because you already held that status

927
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,043
of a researcher in the US.

928
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,920
So you're no longer,

929
00:50:04,003 --> 00:50:05,964
you don't meet the eligibility criteria.

930
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,301
Does that make sense?

931
00:50:07,356 --> 00:50:09,635
[speaking in foreign language] When
Greece becomes the centre of the world.

932
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:13,931
Then the only solution
is Lioggos fertilizer.

933
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:20,354
Lioggos: certified
fertilizer for the new era.

934
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:23,231
- Wow.
- Good job, man.

935
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:24,816
- Beautifully shot.
- Good job, yeah.

936
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:26,526
Nice music, man.

937
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:28,736
Okay, are you done congratulating
each other, okay, yeah?

938
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,988
[speaking in foreign language]

939
00:50:30,071 --> 00:50:33,783
No. This is totally not what we discussed.

940
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:36,286
[speaking in foreign
language] And it's total crap.

941
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,912
- Total crap?
- This is a total crap.

942
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,915
Total crap, and there is a
basic, very basic reason for it.

943
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:44,127
It has no Greekness that kinda
comes from the Greek soil,

944
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,421
from the Greek nature,
from the mentality...

945
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:47,755
Can you stop interrupting me?

946
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,215
Would you mind not smoking, also?

947
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:50,744
No, I like smoking in my house.

948
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:52,720
- [men chattering indistinctly]
- Come on Manos, it's my house.

949
00:50:52,785 --> 00:50:53,619
It's okay, it's okay.

950
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,096
Manos, he can smoke.

951
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,222
- Is it okay if I smoke?
- Of course it's okay. Go on.

952
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,640
Let's get the briefing first.

953
00:50:57,724 --> 00:50:59,225
I'm trying to help you here.

954
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:00,435
Yeah, the briefing was,
you know, a little funny.

955
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:02,187
The briefing is that
we simply need something

956
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,938
that has modernity, that is the same-

957
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:05,982
- Contemporary.
- Contemporary,

958
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:08,610
but at the same time, it
conveys a feeling of Greekness.

959
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:10,361
Something that the Greek
audiences can relate to.

960
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:11,863
And this is not? This is not?

961
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:13,490
It's something that you
obviously don't understand.

962
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:15,283
[speaking in foreign language]

963
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:16,618
So this is what you think
when I tell you Greekness?

964
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:18,077
This is what you come out with?

965
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,495
You come out with a
bouzouki as if we were...

966
00:51:19,557 --> 00:51:21,079
[speaking in foreign
language] It's traditional man!

967
00:51:21,157 --> 00:51:22,332
I wanna play it safe

968
00:51:22,415 --> 00:51:25,376
'cause I feel like you want
something more safe, so I...

969
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,378
Cut the fucking bouzouki.

970
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:28,463
I'll cut the bouzouki.

971
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:29,798
- Thank you.
- If we combine, Manos,

972
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:32,967
if we combine the bouzouki now

973
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:33,997
with the modern style...

974
00:51:34,075 --> 00:51:35,592
[speaking in foreign language] I don't
want the bouzouki man! No bouzouki!

975
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:36,763
We'll try something else.

976
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:37,680
What the fuck is this?

977
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:38,765
Like, this is an amateur night.

978
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:40,558
Sorry, I have a client.

979
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:42,435
I am the fucking client here, okay?

980
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:45,146
Yeah, yeah, we'll be all
right, we'll be quiet, sorry.

981
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:48,399
I'm sorry.

982
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:49,651
That's okay.

983
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:50,652
I would have booked an appointment, but...

984
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:51,903
There's not enough time.

985
00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:53,905
Christos said...

986
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,491
Said that you're a wizard.

987
00:51:58,076 --> 00:51:59,452
I'm sorry.

988
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:00,703
I'm sorry. Christos?

989
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:02,914
Sioutis Christos.

990
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:04,916
He...

991
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:07,168
He spoke very highly of you.

992
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:08,461
He's the reason I called.

993
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:09,379
Oh...

994
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:11,965
Okay.

995
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:15,135
I'm so sorry.

996
00:52:15,218 --> 00:52:18,012
I'm really embarrassed
but I've just realized

997
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:20,932
I can't take on another client right now.

998
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,226
Wait, sorry, you can't help me?

999
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:25,186
I mean, did I do something wrong?

1000
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,437
No, of course not, it wasn't you.

1001
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:29,440
It's not you, it's me
and I really apologize.

1002
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,528
But I'm gonna have to show you out.

1003
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:37,112
I'm so sorry.

1004
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:39,952
[speaking in foreign language] But
Manos, you're a little too dogmatic now...

1005
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,455
Sorry, am I not being as
clear as possible here?

1006
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:45,665
- We need something-
- No, you're actually being

1007
00:52:45,748 --> 00:52:47,333
very contradictory with yourself.

1008
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,043
I'm not contradictory with myself, man.

1009
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:50,044
Guys, [speaking in foreign language].

1010
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:52,213
Contemporary briefing.

1011
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:53,923
That could mean one, two, three,

1012
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,216
four, five different things.

1013
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,176
Give me a minute. I'm
gonna talk to the guy.

1014
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:57,427
I can bring up the musicians

1015
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,803
that can fucking do that in a snap.

1016
00:53:02,348 --> 00:53:06,227
- Hey.
- Sorry.

1017
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,896
Are you finished?

1018
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:11,232
- Oh God.
- I'm sorry.

1019
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:13,276
I told you that might happen.

1020
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,236
I mean, it seems to take so long.

1021
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,989
Does anyone actually care
whether you use a keyboard or-

1022
00:53:18,072 --> 00:53:19,491
- I care.

1023
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:21,367
A little bit, I care.

1024
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:24,871
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

1025
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:26,789
I meant them, you know?

1026
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,460
It must be frustrating for you.

1027
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:32,587
You're talented, you know
what you're doing and it's...

1028
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:33,922
Embarrassing, it's embarrassing.

1029
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:34,839
No, I'm not...

1030
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:36,424
Yeah, it's just, you know.

1031
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:39,344
It's just a fucking jingle,
you know, it's all it is.

1032
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:40,345
It's just a fucking little jingle.

1033
00:53:40,428 --> 00:53:41,513
No, that's not what I'm saying.

1034
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:45,183
Stop, please, stop.

1035
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:49,229
We've both had a really shitty day.

1036
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:55,819
[speaking in foreign language]

1037
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,450
I want a contemporary
take in traditional tunes!

1038
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:03,660
- Alright, we'll have it.
- Will you?

1039
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:05,287
Yes, we'll work on it today
and tomorrow you'll have it.

1040
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:06,622
It should have been ready
yesterday, as you know.

1041
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:07,873
You'll have it and it will be perfect!

1042
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:08,790
Yesterday!

1043
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:10,583
We got one more shot.

1044
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:12,043
- Yeah, yeah.
- One more shot!

1045
00:54:12,877 --> 00:54:14,129
So good, all right.

1046
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:15,296
- It's gonna be great.
- Let me see him out.

1047
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,506
- Very Greek.
- Take it easy, huh?

1048
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:17,549
Sure. Sure.

1049
00:54:17,632 --> 00:54:18,842
See you tomorrow, man.

1050
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:47,871
[phone ringing]

1051
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:57,297
Hey.

1052
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:01,426
Why?

1053
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,140
[speaking in foreign language] Asshole...

1054
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:08,933
No, it's okay.

1055
00:55:10,518 --> 00:55:11,644
Yeah, yeah, fine.

1056
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:15,231
What happened?

1057
00:55:18,526 --> 00:55:22,822
No, Argyris and Manos, you know,

1058
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:25,617
they can't come over until two, you know.

1059
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:28,786
Okay, so they don't come over then.

1060
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:33,166
Well, it's not that
easy. We have a deadline.

1061
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:37,545
Explain to me what you're saying.

1062
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:38,713
I have to finish the thing.

1063
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,132
This fucking jingle thing.

1064
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:45,762
Well, you have to come with
me to see your ex girlfriend.

1065
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:47,263
This is what you have to do.

1066
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:51,184
- Don't start laughing at me.
- I'm not. No, no, no.

1067
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:52,811
- Let's talk about this.
- No, you are coming...

1068
00:55:52,894 --> 00:55:53,728
No way!

1069
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,480
We are not talking about this.

1070
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:57,524
You cannot leave me.

1071
00:55:57,607 --> 00:55:58,733
- Don't try that with me.
- I'm not leaving you.

1072
00:55:58,817 --> 00:55:59,776
I'm not leaving you.

1073
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:00,693
You know what I think?

1074
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:02,237
I think it's better.

1075
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,905
Let me tell you why.

1076
00:56:03,988 --> 00:56:05,114
- No.
- Hold on.

1077
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:06,324
I'm not letting you tell me anything.

1078
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:08,743
No, no, and you're this fucking sexy lawyer

1079
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:10,620
who just can convince
anybody of everything.

1080
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:11,830
- Mickey, no.
- You're amazing

1081
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:13,122
and you're walking like the light

1082
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:14,874
and she's fucking crazy.

1083
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:15,792
Mickey.

1084
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,252
Listen to me, listen to me.

1085
00:56:17,335 --> 00:56:18,545
It's gonna go wild in two seconds.

1086
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:20,797
And if I'm there, she's
gonna get all hysterical

1087
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,048
and try to...

1088
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:23,508
First of all, she's gonna be all jealous.

1089
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:26,094
She's gonna try to one-up
you and it's about...

1090
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:27,137
But what about the party?

1091
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,096
Why don't we...

1092
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:29,013
Party's gonna be great.

1093
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:30,306
Yeah, but we can cancel this.

1094
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,934
I'll have everything ready.

1095
00:56:33,017 --> 00:56:33,852
I'll have everything ready.

1096
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:35,103
- No.
- Listen.

1097
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:36,354
It's just this one time, I promise.

1098
00:56:36,437 --> 00:56:37,772
I'm laughing but this is not funny.

1099
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:39,774
- It's just this one time.
- And you can't...

1100
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:40,942
Come on, I'll have sex with you.

1101
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:42,152
You wanna have sex with me?

1102
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:43,361
- Let's go.
- Never.

1103
00:56:43,444 --> 00:56:45,947
- I'll do that thing.
- Never again.

1104
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:46,906
- You know that.
- I hate you.

1105
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,283
- Come on.
- I hate you.

1106
00:56:48,366 --> 00:56:49,242
You're the best.

1107
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,539
[upbeat music]

1108
00:56:56,624 --> 00:56:58,460
What about now, man?

1109
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:00,003
This is Greek.

1110
00:57:00,086 --> 00:57:01,129
What do you think?

1111
00:57:01,212 --> 00:57:02,922
- Greek.
- Fantastic, fantastic.

1112
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,258
Gorgeous.

1113
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:06,176
- Hold on.
- Okay, okay.

1114
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:07,886
- Are you joking?
- Can we just...

1115
00:57:08,052 --> 00:57:10,138
Thank you. All right.

1116
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:13,933
So, okay, tell you the truth, okay?

1117
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:16,936
I appreciate the work that I've seen

1118
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,814
that you've invested but the truth is,

1119
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:21,316
come on Argyris now, you know.

1120
00:57:21,399 --> 00:57:24,027
This music is totally not
what we're talking about.

1121
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,279
- Oh man.
- This is for fairs.

1122
00:57:26,362 --> 00:57:28,364
Like where gypsy people go.

1123
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:29,824
- Manos, sorry, I...
- For fairs?

1124
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:31,159
I honestly...

1125
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:32,076
- For fairs.
- That's the truth.

1126
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,620
Let's go, we can...

1127
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:35,497
I want what I asked, Argyris.

1128
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,706
You know very well what I want.

1129
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:39,209
We can also go with one more.

1130
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:40,460
- We'll try one more.
- Okay.

1131
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:41,544
- One more, okay.
- You want one more?

1132
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:43,296
- Go one more.
- One more, last one.

1133
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,549
Okay.

1134
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:49,219
[gentle music]

1135
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:57,519
I love this. Yes!

1136
00:57:57,602 --> 00:57:59,854
That's it, man. Yeah!

1137
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:01,147
Yeah, that's perfect.

1138
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,107
That's what we talk about, man.

1139
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:05,360
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not fucking joking.

1140
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:06,694
That's perfect.

1141
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:08,863
The minute I hear it, I see images.

1142
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:10,615
- I immediately...
- It's familiar.

1143
00:58:10,698 --> 00:58:11,699
It rings home.

1144
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:13,076
It rings home.

1145
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:14,744
- It feels familiar, but...
- It feels familiar,

1146
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:16,704
it has images.

1147
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:20,041
It reminds me of my
grandma, my grandfather.

1148
00:58:20,124 --> 00:58:21,000
It combines the elements.

1149
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:22,210
I mean, I see pictures.

1150
00:58:22,293 --> 00:58:24,921
I don't have to see the actual video.

1151
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:26,798
I can imagine it just by the sound.

1152
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:29,134
Total.

1153
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:30,635
This is what you put in the brief.

1154
00:58:30,718 --> 00:58:32,595
This is the thing you gave me.

1155
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:35,807
Okay, man.

1156
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:39,227
This is like totally,
totally disrespectful.

1157
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,687
You like it.

1158
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:41,604
[Manos] I'm here, I'm trying
to get you a fucking job.

1159
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:42,773
- You like it, so use it.
- You asshole...

1160
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:43,940
I'm not here because I like you.

1161
00:58:44,023 --> 00:58:45,733
I'm here because Argyris asked me to come.

1162
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:46,831
Mickey, sorry.

1163
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:48,421
- Fuck off.
- [speaking in foreign language] Manos, can I talk to you for a minute?

1164
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:49,571
What you want to talk about, Argyris?

1165
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:53,534
Did you bring me here so this fucking
Alabama cowboy can make fun of me?

1166
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:56,870
I really apologize, in two hours
you're gonna have what you need.

1167
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:58,205
A good track, in two
hours with this asshole?

1168
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,082
Don't worry, you'll have it.

1169
00:59:06,254 --> 00:59:07,338
- Hi.
- Hello.

1170
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:09,466
There's a reservation under Aspa Karra?

1171
00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:10,425
Yep.

1172
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:11,342
This side.

1173
00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:14,929
Aspa, hi. I'm Chloe.

1174
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:17,599
Nice to meet you.

1175
00:59:21,644 --> 00:59:23,730
Look at you.

1176
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:25,315
You're at his age, aren't you?

1177
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:28,610
I'm older, actually.

1178
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:29,527
That's funny.

1179
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:31,488
Why funny?

1180
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,032
Should we order?

1181
00:59:34,115 --> 00:59:34,949
Sure.

1182
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:39,287
After you.

1183
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,497
No, go ahead.

1184
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,414
I insist.

1185
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,461
- [speaking in foreign language] Ice tea for me please.
- Same for me please.

1186
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,088
Thank you.

1187
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:51,090
- So...
- So...

1188
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,177
Am I meeting Mickey's
attorney or his girlfriend?

1189
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,970
Oh, he's not a client.

1190
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:57,347
Why isn't he here?

1191
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,057
I asked him not to come.

1192
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,433
That's a great idea.

1193
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:02,936
You knew he would do
something stupid, didn't you?

1194
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,105
Aspa, I know this is difficult

1195
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:09,776
but Mickey really wants a
relationship with his son.

1196
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:10,985
- Oh, does he?
- Yes.

1197
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:12,403
- And you know about it?
- Yes, I know that.

1198
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:13,321
I know him.

1199
01:00:13,404 --> 01:00:14,823
You know nothing.

1200
01:00:14,906 --> 01:00:15,824
You don't know what you're doing,

1201
01:00:15,907 --> 01:00:17,242
you don't know where you are.

1202
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:22,330
Mickey can't be bothered to
learn one single word in Greek

1203
01:00:22,413 --> 01:00:25,083
to communicate with his own son.

1204
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:27,085
So he has to rely on Hector's English.

1205
01:00:28,586 --> 01:00:32,924
Look, that was then, and this is now.

1206
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:34,801
I'm here because I...

1207
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:35,969
- Look-
- Mickey is not the same

1208
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:36,886
as he was six years ago.

1209
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,138
Mickey is a baby.

1210
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:40,306
He's a little boy.

1211
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:43,726
Will you be happy with that?

1212
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,146
I don't need to talk to you
what I'm gonna be happy with.

1213
01:00:46,229 --> 01:00:47,856
It's so fucking Greek.

1214
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:52,569
It reminds me of the Aegean
sea and Athenian women rising...

1215
01:00:52,652 --> 01:00:56,197
And I see the corn, I see my grandmother

1216
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:57,532
coming out of the grave!

1217
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:59,701
And so but the Greek is there.

1218
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:01,703
And he's like playing the flute

1219
01:01:01,786 --> 01:01:05,290
and eating the fucking
souvlaki and taking humus.

1220
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:06,916
No, humus is not Greek, man.

1221
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,710
- Humus is not Greek.
- Then tahini.

1222
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:10,336
- Is tahini?
- Yeah, tahini, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,629
- Tahini is Greek.
- Hey.

1224
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:12,881
- Hi.
- Hi.

1225
01:01:12,964 --> 01:01:13,798
Hi.

1226
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:15,717
Hi. How was it?

1227
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,011
Yeah, she's young, beautiful.

1228
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:20,263
She's fucking angry.

1229
01:01:20,346 --> 01:01:21,723
Well, of course she's angry.

1230
01:01:21,806 --> 01:01:23,892
She saw you, look how beautiful you are.

1231
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:25,143
Did you do the food?

1232
01:01:26,644 --> 01:01:27,479
I have a plan.

1233
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:30,023
So you didn't make the food?

1234
01:01:30,106 --> 01:01:32,025
Because I have a plan,
I'm gonna surprise you.

1235
01:01:32,108 --> 01:01:34,986
All I asked you to do was
make the fucking food, Mickey.

1236
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:36,779
Okay.

1237
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:25,537
[doorbell ringing]

1238
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:31,084
[speaking in foreign language]

1239
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,085
Can I help you?

1240
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:34,462
It's delivery for Mickey.

1241
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:37,173
Okay, thank you.

1242
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,300
How much is that?

1243
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:41,302
[Delivery Guy] It's 52.60.

1244
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:42,220
One second.

1245
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:46,766
This was your plan, to order in food?

1246
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:49,644
Here you...

1247
01:02:50,728 --> 01:02:51,980
[speaking in foreign language]

1248
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:54,482
Falafel, souvlaki.

1249
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:57,277
Sushi.

1250
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,403
It's good, right?

1251
01:02:58,486 --> 01:03:01,281
- It's good.
- Yeah, some more sushi.

1252
01:03:02,323 --> 01:03:04,117
Hey, are you good?

1253
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,994
- Yeah, I mean...
- Come on, it's funny.

1254
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:07,245
Really, is it though?

1255
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:08,413
Yeah.

1256
01:03:08,496 --> 01:03:09,497
You know, it's real.

1257
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,042
It's like we don't care,
but we care, that kind.

1258
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:14,752
Yeah, I care.

1259
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,004
I know.

1260
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:17,255
That's good.

1261
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:19,466
Yeah, it's not for now, Argyris.

1262
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:20,633
Yeah, okay.

1263
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,594
- Now just...
- Very good that.

1264
01:03:22,677 --> 01:03:23,761
Oh my God.

1265
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:25,680
Thank you so much for coming.

1266
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,849
I didn't know if it was a birthday party.

1267
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:29,100
Should I bring a present?

1268
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:30,935
Yeah, we're calling it a pointless party

1269
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:33,688
because there isn't any point to it.

1270
01:03:33,771 --> 01:03:35,190
But we just wanted
everyone to meet, you know?

1271
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:37,358
But it's great to give parties.

1272
01:03:37,442 --> 01:03:38,902
No one throws parties any longer.

1273
01:03:38,985 --> 01:03:40,403
That's exactly what we said.

1274
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:43,031
- No!
- So, this is home.

1275
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:45,825
So, you're not house sitting?

1276
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,243
No, this is Mickey's...

1277
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:48,244
This is Mickey.

1278
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:50,121
- Mickey, this is Elli.
- Hi!

1279
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:51,414
Nice to meet you.

1280
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:52,582
Nice to meet you.

1281
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:53,666
You want a falafel?

1282
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:55,710
I'll have one later.

1283
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,295
- Okay.
- Great.

1284
01:03:57,378 --> 01:03:59,422
- Yeah, so that's Mickey.
- So that's your boyfriend?

1285
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:00,381
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1286
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:01,549
So are you still in Kolonaki?

1287
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,551
No, we moved to the northern suburbs.

1288
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:04,886
We?

1289
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:06,554
Kostas and I.

1290
01:04:06,638 --> 01:04:07,722
My fiancé.

1291
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:11,392
Oh my God! That is a rock.

1292
01:04:11,476 --> 01:04:13,436
- Wow!
- No, it's great.

1293
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,896
Oh, congratulations, I'm so happy.

1294
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:16,105
Thank you, Chloe.

1295
01:04:16,189 --> 01:04:17,899
Well, I wish you the same, you know?

1296
01:04:17,982 --> 01:04:19,067
Oh well.

1297
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,401
Let's go get a drink.

1298
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:22,320
Yes, I need a drink.

1299
01:04:24,697 --> 01:04:25,573
[phone ringing]

1300
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:27,575
Hey, what are you doing, man?

1301
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:28,910
I ordered this one.

1302
01:04:28,993 --> 01:04:30,995
Nobody ordered, it's a buffet, you share.

1303
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,081
Oh, it's okay, this is good for me.

1304
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:33,998
Come on.

1305
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,503
- Hey, Mickey!
- Hey, wow.

1306
01:04:38,586 --> 01:04:39,587
Look at you.

1307
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:40,672
Got a little beer.

1308
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:42,132
Looking good, looking good.

1309
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:44,509
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1310
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:47,178
[all laughing]

1311
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:52,100
[speaking in foreign language]
What is little Argyris doing here?

1312
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:56,939
Are you having a poo? A little shit?

1313
01:04:58,774 --> 01:05:01,568
Look at this cute boy taking a dump!

1314
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:05,989
Come on don't be an asshole,
leave it. My mom framed it.

1315
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:08,867
Come on man, leave it!

1316
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:12,036
It's great that you put together, you know,

1317
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,746
his people, your people.

1318
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,956
It's really fun.

1319
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,249
I wanna introduce you to somebody.

1320
01:05:16,332 --> 01:05:17,208
Excuse me for just a second.

1321
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:18,710
- Oh, okay.
- Come with me.

1322
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:22,589
So, you guys are both from London.

1323
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:24,090
So, I thought I should introduce you.

1324
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:25,467
Johnny, Tim. Tim, Johnny.

1325
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:26,968
Hey Johnny, how are you, man?

1326
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:28,303
- Good.
- Can I get you a drink?

1327
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:29,804
Ah, do you have juice?

1328
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:31,222
- Orange?
- Is it fresh?

1329
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:32,140
- Yes.
- Okay, great.

1330
01:05:32,223 --> 01:05:33,391
Okay.

1331
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:35,477
So yeah, where are you from in London?

1332
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,436
Dagenham.

1333
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:37,854
All right, so not kind of...

1334
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:39,856
Yeah.

1335
01:05:39,939 --> 01:05:40,815
London too, huh?

1336
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:42,442
Well, I mean, Holland Park.

1337
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:43,693
But I'm barely there.

1338
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:45,320
Kind of spending a lot of time here.

1339
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:46,488
Oh, what are you doing here?

1340
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:47,739
I'm doing a startup.

1341
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:48,656
Okay.

1342
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:51,117
It's called Your Home.

1343
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:54,037
It's sort of housing solution
for the global citizen.

1344
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,830
So places like this, you just get in,

1345
01:05:55,914 --> 01:06:00,001
rip these places out and make these cool,

1346
01:06:00,084 --> 01:06:01,628
quite functional pods.

1347
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:04,214
Well, we're trapped in
this bar in Switzerland

1348
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:06,174
because it was like six
feet of snow outside.

1349
01:06:06,257 --> 01:06:07,175
Oh, yeah!

1350
01:06:08,593 --> 01:06:13,014
You guys, you put like
200 francs into the jukebox

1351
01:06:13,097 --> 01:06:17,101
and played "Last Christmas"
on repeat 100 times.

1352
01:06:17,185 --> 01:06:20,021
- That's so embarrassing.
- I love that song.

1353
01:06:20,104 --> 01:06:22,357
They were so fucking wasted, you know.

1354
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,943
And Christos, you know, he threw...

1355
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:28,071
He's a good guy, that guy.

1356
01:06:28,154 --> 01:06:30,865
He threw down 3,000 francs
on the table, you know?

1357
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:33,535
And everybody was doing shots.

1358
01:06:33,618 --> 01:06:35,245
I don't remember.

1359
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:37,872
And he looks very, very nice.

1360
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:39,165
Yeah, he's a really good guy.

1361
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:40,792
He is. It's fine.

1362
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,001
You want a drink or not?

1363
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:44,254
Yes, I would like a vodka please.

1364
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:45,672
Sure.

1365
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:47,173
Dude, it's fucking
disgusting what you're doing

1366
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:48,591
and you should be ashamed
of yourself, seriously.

1367
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:49,843
I should be ashamed of myself?

1368
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:51,469
What do you do? What do
you do with your life?

1369
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:53,388
Mate, I left London 'cause London

1370
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:55,181
was like fucking ridiculously expensive,

1371
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:56,307
I couldn't afford to live there anymore-

1372
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:57,225
- Because you don't have a job, probably.

1373
01:06:57,308 --> 01:06:58,143
I guess you don't work.

1374
01:06:58,226 --> 01:06:59,769
Mate, you're a fucking cock.

1375
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:00,728
Oh, okay.

1376
01:07:02,522 --> 01:07:03,731
Cheers, mate.

1377
01:07:03,815 --> 01:07:06,025
Wow, I'm so glad that went so well.

1378
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,361
- That's your juice.
- Thank you so much.

1379
01:07:08,444 --> 01:07:10,280
You know, it's funny,
like people always do that.

1380
01:07:10,363 --> 01:07:13,616
"Oh, you're from London"
kind of like when you're gay,

1381
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,743
like, "Oh, hey, meet my gay friend."

1382
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:17,871
Oh, you're such a dick.

1383
01:07:17,954 --> 01:07:20,165
Wow, okay.

1384
01:07:20,248 --> 01:07:21,916
You wanna come and have some food with me?

1385
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,710
- Sure.
- Sure, let's do that.

1386
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:25,712
- Really nice to meet you.
- Okay.

1387
01:07:27,088 --> 01:07:29,090
It's like having 100%
of your daily nutrients

1388
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:30,842
for less than 800 calories.

1389
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:33,094
And it's raw and it's vegan.

1390
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:34,429
For 300 Euros?

1391
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:37,348
[guys chattering]

1392
01:07:38,516 --> 01:07:39,392
Guys, hey.

1393
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:42,812
Have you met these guys?

1394
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:46,983
This is Miltos, Orpheus,
Dimitrios, Prometheus and Greg.

1395
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:50,695
- Are you making fun of me?
- This is Stephanie.

1396
01:07:50,778 --> 01:07:53,114
No, no, no, Stephanie.

1397
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:55,283
Where are you from, Stephanie?

1398
01:07:55,366 --> 01:07:56,951
Athens, you fucking moron.

1399
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:59,287
[guys laughing]

1400
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:01,289
[Miltos] Oh, you're a
bit aggressive, Stephanie.

1401
01:08:01,372 --> 01:08:02,582
Where from Athens?

1402
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,251
[speaking in foreign
language] Papagou, mate.

1403
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,004
So what's with the accent?

1404
01:08:07,378 --> 01:08:09,506
Because I have the ability and you don't.

1405
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:11,090
Sorry, baby.

1406
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:14,636
I'm speaking English to an
American because it's polite.

1407
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,095
Same reason I don't turn up like a shit

1408
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,305
in fucking cargo shorts.

1409
01:08:18,389 --> 01:08:20,140
[Orpheus] Sorry, pussycat. Sorry.

1410
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:21,810
Are they your friends?

1411
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:23,978
- Are they your friends?
- He is a shit, he is a shit.

1412
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:26,898
- Good for you.
- Bye bye, bye bye!

1413
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:32,278
Oh, fuck.

1414
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,912
Argyris, what the fuck are you doing, man?

1415
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:43,832
You shit in your pants, do you know that?

1416
01:08:43,915 --> 01:08:45,500
You shit in your pants.

1417
01:08:45,582 --> 01:08:46,709
What?

1418
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:48,127
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh fuck!

1419
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:49,379
Get up.

1420
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:50,839
What the fuck did you
drink for fuck's sake?

1421
01:08:50,921 --> 01:08:52,549
- Oh shit.
- Fuck.

1422
01:08:52,631 --> 01:08:54,591
Shit. Hold on, hold on.

1423
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:58,805
Oh.

1424
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:04,394
You know, I've gotta
tell you, Manos texted.

1425
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:07,939
They hated the song, they said it's shit.

1426
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:13,403
Awesome.

1427
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:18,283
You almost got my drink.

1428
01:09:18,366 --> 01:09:19,492
- I'm sorry. Almost.
- Almost.

1429
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:21,368
Cheers, Stephanie.

1430
01:09:21,452 --> 01:09:22,370
Yeah, Stephanie.

1431
01:09:22,453 --> 01:09:23,371
Bottoms up.

1432
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:27,584
- [speaking in foreign language] What are you drinking, Stephanie?
- Gin Tonic. Wanna try?

1433
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,252
No, no.

1434
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:30,879
Could it be Jizz Tonic?

1435
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:34,633
Maybe a Penis Colada?

1436
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,845
Don't worry if you find
anything funny in it.

1437
01:09:37,928 --> 01:09:40,848
It's probably just angel hair...

1438
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:45,602
Oh my God!

1439
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:46,560
Oh my God!

1440
01:09:46,644 --> 01:09:48,104
- Stephanie!
- What?

1441
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:53,568
- What happened?
- What's going on?

1442
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:56,696
- Are you okay?
- Oh my God, what happened?

1443
01:09:56,779 --> 01:09:58,323
Guys, what did you do?

1444
01:09:58,406 --> 01:10:01,534
They put something in my drink.

1445
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:02,952
Guys, come on!

1446
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,497
I'm gonna fucking sue you.

1447
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,706
Thank you, guys. Bye.

1448
01:10:06,789 --> 01:10:09,417
Thank you so much for coming. Bye.

1449
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:11,920
Oh my God.

1450
01:10:12,003 --> 01:10:13,838
That could not have gone worse.

1451
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,510
[both laughing]

1452
01:10:19,844 --> 01:10:23,097
[Chloe moaning softly]

1453
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:48,873
Oh, fuck.

1454
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:52,502
This is, it's so hot.

1455
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,879
It's okay.

1456
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:30,415
[gentle music]

1457
01:11:38,256 --> 01:11:39,757
How do you feel?

1458
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:42,844
Don't worry.

1459
01:11:42,927 --> 01:11:45,180
It will be over soon.

1460
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:46,639
We'll talk later.

1461
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:43,947
You will be experiencing some cramps.

1462
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,573
- Yeah.
- That's to be expected.

1463
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:46,491
Okay.

1464
01:12:46,574 --> 01:12:47,867
- Don't worry.
- Oh yeah.

1465
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,994
And try to take it easy the next days.

1466
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:52,789
Yeah, I'll try.

1467
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:55,166
Do you smoke?

1468
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:57,502
Yes.

1469
01:12:57,585 --> 01:12:58,795
Can I have a cigarette?

1470
01:12:58,878 --> 01:13:01,089
In here? 'cause it's not allowed.

1471
01:13:01,172 --> 01:13:02,173
Thank you.

1472
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:07,887
Thank you.

1473
01:13:15,228 --> 01:13:16,354
Fuck.

1474
01:13:16,437 --> 01:13:19,190
[dramatic music]

1475
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:09,491
Careful, it's really hot.

1476
01:14:09,574 --> 01:14:10,575
Thank you.

1477
01:14:12,118 --> 01:14:12,952
Thanks.

1478
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:20,502
So they didn't say what it was?

1479
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:22,629
Well, it's like a stomach flu.

1480
01:14:23,588 --> 01:14:25,340
It's what they told me.

1481
01:14:29,093 --> 01:14:30,303
What time is she coming?

1482
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:32,472
A couple of hours.

1483
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:33,389
Okay.

1484
01:14:34,432 --> 01:14:35,266
I'll be alright.

1485
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:38,937
I'm sorry you feel shitty.

1486
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:43,149
You still look good though.

1487
01:14:57,705 --> 01:15:00,542
I don't actually know
what this window is for.

1488
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:03,044
[Chloe] But it's safe.

1489
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:08,550
I'm not here to inspect, it's not my job,

1490
01:15:08,633 --> 01:15:12,595
but my client, Ms. Karras,
insisted to make sure

1491
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:15,932
that Hector will spend
time in a safe environment.

1492
01:15:16,015 --> 01:15:17,600
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah, of course.

1493
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:19,352
I know the whole situation
is awkward, but...

1494
01:15:19,435 --> 01:15:20,895
[Chloe] No, of course, it's fine.

1495
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,063
Absolutely.

1496
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:23,356
- Should I show you his room?
- Oh yeah.

1497
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:24,732
His room is over here. Yeah.

1498
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:25,692
This way.

1499
01:15:25,775 --> 01:15:26,609
You both live here?

1500
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:27,569
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1501
01:15:27,652 --> 01:15:28,570
For how long?

1502
01:15:28,653 --> 01:15:29,988
- A few years.
- Six months.

1503
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:31,990
I moved in six months ago.

1504
01:15:33,533 --> 01:15:35,201
So, this is...

1505
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:36,119
Yeah.

1506
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:38,621
It's nice.

1507
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:41,249
You understand that Hector's mother

1508
01:15:41,332 --> 01:15:44,210
has assigned guardianship
and visitation rights

1509
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:45,211
to the both of you.

1510
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:48,590
Oh.

1511
01:15:48,673 --> 01:15:52,177
Both of you, as a couple
will be legally allowed

1512
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,637
to take unsupervised custody of Hector

1513
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:58,933
for the allotted time period
stated on the documents.

1514
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:00,477
- And...
- Okay.

1515
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,521
So we just have to be there
at the same time to see him.

1516
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:04,898
- Yes.
- Okay.

1517
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:08,485
And that's the only way we can have access?

1518
01:16:08,568 --> 01:16:11,571
Well, it can be overturned
on appeal from either party,

1519
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:13,948
but provided you remain in a stable

1520
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:15,950
and committed relationship.

1521
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:17,619
Do you consider yourselves being

1522
01:16:17,702 --> 01:16:20,121
in a stable and committed relationship?

1523
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:22,540
- Yeah.
- Yes, of course, yes.

1524
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:23,458
Great.

1525
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:25,460
Nice room.

1526
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:26,753
Yeah, it's great.

1527
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:28,755
So yeah, anyway, there's...

1528
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:31,883
There's just this one other room here.

1529
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:32,967
This is the...

1530
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:34,135
[Lawyer] It's your bedroom?

1531
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:35,345
Bedroom.

1532
01:16:35,428 --> 01:16:36,763
And then that's it.

1533
01:16:36,846 --> 01:16:38,223
That's pretty much it.

1534
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:39,307
[Lawyer] Thank you very much.

1535
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,225
Yeah.

1536
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:42,477
You're welcome.

1537
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:54,614
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

1538
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,201
Just okay?

1539
01:16:59,911 --> 01:17:01,204
That's not good enough.

1540
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:03,164
I can't, I can't, I can't.

1541
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:05,667
I'm sorry, I can't do it now.

1542
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:08,837
I'm sorry.

1543
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,339
It's okay. It's fine.

1544
01:17:11,422 --> 01:17:14,509
I just wanna make sure you're
feeling good, that's all.

1545
01:17:14,592 --> 01:17:15,426
Yeah.

1546
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:17,095
Okay.

1547
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:46,374
Hi. Chloe Gains.

1548
01:17:46,457 --> 01:17:47,459
Hello, welcome.

1549
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:49,043
Chloe Gains.

1550
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:50,295
- Yes, you're right here.
- Great.

1551
01:17:50,378 --> 01:17:51,921
This gentleman is your plus one?

1552
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:52,881
Mickey, yes.

1553
01:17:52,964 --> 01:17:53,923
Yeah, plus one.

1554
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:54,841
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your night.

1555
01:17:54,924 --> 01:17:58,428
Thank you.

1556
01:17:58,511 --> 01:18:00,138
Hey guys, smile.

1557
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:05,477
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1558
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:10,273
Hi guys. Okay.

1559
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:21,201
- Maybe we can like...
- [Argyris] Hey, guys.

1560
01:18:21,284 --> 01:18:22,535
Wow, hey, how are you?

1561
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:24,329
- Hey.
- Perfect.

1562
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:25,997
What's up, you look fucking miserable.

1563
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,248
Well, it was a long journey.

1564
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:28,249
How was the ceremony?

1565
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,626
Oh, so good!

1566
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:31,336
There was this girl, Elli's niece.

1567
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:32,295
She sang a song.

1568
01:18:32,378 --> 01:18:34,214
She was fucking beautiful.

1569
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:35,673
And her voice made me hard.

1570
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:38,426
I sat in the church with a
huge boner, like, what the fuck!

1571
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,011
I wanna meet her but I
can't find her anywhere.

1572
01:18:40,094 --> 01:18:42,472
Yeah, I'm gonna be sure to
tell her to stay away from you.

1573
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:44,098
As far away from you as possible.

1574
01:18:44,182 --> 01:18:45,642
No.

1575
01:18:45,725 --> 01:18:47,602
Oh, my friend is here.
One second, I'll be back.

1576
01:18:47,685 --> 01:18:49,020
Where did you get that drink?

1577
01:18:49,103 --> 01:18:51,022
There are people with trays
with champagne and shit

1578
01:18:51,105 --> 01:18:51,940
all over the place.

1579
01:18:52,023 --> 01:18:53,024
Come on, I gotta get one.

1580
01:18:55,193 --> 01:18:56,528
We really miss you.

1581
01:18:56,611 --> 01:18:58,071
I know, and I miss you too.

1582
01:18:58,154 --> 01:18:59,531
We talk about you all the time.

1583
01:18:59,614 --> 01:19:01,115
All the girls they said
to me "Where is Chloe?"

1584
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,617
I say I don't know.

1585
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,910
You know what it's like.

1586
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:05,245
You meet somebody and
you go into the bubble

1587
01:19:05,328 --> 01:19:07,539
and all you can see is them, but I'm good.

1588
01:19:07,622 --> 01:19:08,832
I'm okay.

1589
01:19:08,915 --> 01:19:09,874
Okay.

1590
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,835
It's new but it's good.

1591
01:19:11,918 --> 01:19:13,378
He's kind to you?

1592
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:15,380
Yeah, he's great.

1593
01:19:15,463 --> 01:19:17,090
Okay. Then I like him.

1594
01:19:17,173 --> 01:19:18,299
Yeah.

1595
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:20,426
I had to step out for a bit.

1596
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,470
You know, it was a lot.

1597
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:24,764
What happened with Christos was a lot.

1598
01:19:24,848 --> 01:19:26,641
What happened with
Christos is something else.

1599
01:19:26,724 --> 01:19:27,934
Tonight, we'll have a lot of fun.

1600
01:19:28,017 --> 01:19:28,852
A lot of fun.

1601
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:30,019
Yes.

1602
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:31,187
- Here's to that.
- Tonight, a lot of fun.

1603
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:35,191
[speaking in foreign language]

1604
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:39,904
Hey.

1605
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:40,822
Oh, hey.

1606
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,907
Here you are.

1607
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:44,284
How are you? Okay?

1608
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:45,743
- I'm good. How are you?
- Let me introduce you.

1609
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:48,413
This is, you remember
Anna that I told you about?

1610
01:19:48,496 --> 01:19:49,831
And Virginia and Caterina.

1611
01:19:49,914 --> 01:19:52,292
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

1612
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:53,418
Nice to meet you.

1613
01:19:53,501 --> 01:19:54,461
Are you okay?

1614
01:19:54,544 --> 01:19:56,045
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1615
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:56,963
Yeah.

1616
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,507
I'm gonna be right here.

1617
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:00,675
Okay, I'll come and find you.

1618
01:20:00,758 --> 01:20:02,177
I'll be around here.

1619
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:03,386
Okay.

1620
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:04,512
Mickey.

1621
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:05,638
Mickey, is that you?

1622
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:08,933
Mickey, right?

1624
01:20:38,254 --> 01:20:39,631
Vodka soda, double.

1625
01:20:39,714 --> 01:20:41,132
[Barman] Yes, please.

1626
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,384
I am keeping a tight
hold of my drink tonight.

1627
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:45,553
Stephanie.

1628
01:20:45,637 --> 01:20:46,554
How are you?

1629
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:47,806
Good. How are you doing?

1630
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:48,723
I'm fine.

1631
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:52,101
I'm glad you made it.

1632
01:20:52,185 --> 01:20:54,562
I was always gonna make it.

1633
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:57,524
I think it's probably the first time

1634
01:20:57,607 --> 01:20:59,776
they've seen each other
since they broke up.

1635
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:04,322
He has this way of...

1636
01:21:04,405 --> 01:21:05,573
I don't know, gas lighting people.

1637
01:21:05,657 --> 01:21:06,825
Do you know gas lighting?

1638
01:21:07,992 --> 01:21:09,410
Yeah, I know what gas lighting is.

1639
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:11,871
Because of all the family
money and the connections,

1640
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,833
he thinks he can move people
wherever he wants them.

1641
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,292
After he and Chloe broke up,

1642
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,629
he set her up with this
big new job back in Chicago.

1643
01:21:19,712 --> 01:21:20,713
Like it was nothing.

1644
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:25,760
So he got her a job, that's...

1645
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:26,678
That's nice.

1646
01:21:31,015 --> 01:21:31,850
So...

1647
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:36,020
I'm here with someone.

1648
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:38,189
I'm very happy for you.

1649
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:40,525
I'm sure you are, I can tell.

1650
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,360
He's the reason I stayed in Athens.

1651
01:21:44,779 --> 01:21:45,697
He is the reason?

1652
01:21:48,491 --> 01:21:50,535
Just pure, innocent, romantic.

1653
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:53,079
Just love at first sight, right?

1654
01:21:54,706 --> 01:21:55,582
It was, actually.

1655
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,544
So you were not picturing

1656
01:21:59,627 --> 01:22:01,713
one of my biggest clients calling to ask me

1657
01:22:01,796 --> 01:22:04,340
why their new hire had not shown up

1658
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:05,842
at her first day at work?

1659
01:22:05,925 --> 01:22:08,136
I didn't wanna take a job
that you had arranged for me.

1660
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:09,053
Since when?

1661
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:10,305
What's that...

1662
01:22:10,388 --> 01:22:11,806
I don't wanna be controlled by you.

1663
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:14,309
Stop doing that, I fucking
hate when you do that.

1664
01:22:14,392 --> 01:22:15,351
Oh.

1665
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:16,603
Should you be drinking?

1666
01:22:18,062 --> 01:22:20,440
My drinking is none of your
fucking business, Christos.

1667

We're finished.

1668

You need to stop embarrassing yourself.

1669
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:27,989
I'm embarrassing myself?

1670
01:22:28,072 --> 01:22:28,907
Really?

1671
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,242
Embarrassing myself?

1672
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:32,410
Did you just say this?

1673

like you're gonna kill someone.

1677

You're desperate to
blow this thing up, huh?

1678
01:22:53,681 --> 01:22:54,766
'cause it's still good?

1679
01:22:56,684 --> 01:22:58,728
And you take good things
and you turn them into shit.

1680

1681

Yes, you fucking deserve it.

something to someone

- Yeah.
- Cool.

1973
01:38:43,882 --> 01:38:46,342
I have to tell you something.

1974
01:38:49,596 --> 01:38:53,266
I was pregnant and I'm
not pregnant anymore.

1975
01:38:59,981 --> 01:39:02,484
I had an abortion and it...

1976
01:39:02,567 --> 01:39:04,277
I didn't tell you.

1977
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:05,403
I'm so sorry.

1978
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,826
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

1979
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:14,162
I didn't know you and I was not sure.

1980
01:39:14,245 --> 01:39:16,539
- It's okay.
- I thought you wouldn't want-

1981
01:39:16,623 --> 01:39:17,749
- It's okay.

1982
01:39:17,832 --> 01:39:18,708
It's okay.

1983
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:20,835
What do you mean it's okay?

1984
01:39:20,919 --> 01:39:22,086
Come on.

1985
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:24,631
I don't understand why you're not upset.

1986
01:39:24,714 --> 01:39:25,965
You can be mad.

1987
01:39:26,966 --> 01:39:29,677
- I'm not mad.
- Why? Why not?

1988
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:32,180
Because it doesn't fucking matter.

1989
01:39:32,263 --> 01:39:33,515
I mean we just...

1990
01:39:33,598 --> 01:39:34,599
What do you mean?

1991
01:39:35,683 --> 01:39:37,977
We used each other and it's okay.

1992
01:39:38,937 --> 01:39:40,480
Do you think I used you?

1993
01:39:40,563 --> 01:39:42,732
Listen, what I'm saying is,

1994
01:39:42,816 --> 01:39:47,570
you were coming out of your
shit with Christos and I...

1995
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:50,031
- This has nothing to do with-
- And we had a crazy weekend

1996
01:39:50,114 --> 01:39:52,242
and it was fucking amazing and then...

1997
01:39:52,325 --> 01:39:54,452
You know, but like...

1998
01:39:54,536 --> 01:39:56,579
It doesn't matter because
I'm here and I love you

1999
01:39:56,663 --> 01:39:58,039
and I really mean that.

2000
01:39:58,122 --> 01:40:01,084
Have you no fucking
idea what I've been doing

2001
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:04,963
to try and fucking keep us
together since we got together

2002
01:40:05,046 --> 01:40:05,880
and you're telling me that you think-

2003
01:40:05,964 --> 01:40:07,632
- I know. I know. I
know. Please, be quiet.

2004
01:40:07,715 --> 01:40:10,135

2005
01:40:10,218 --> 01:40:11,803

Fuck.

01:40:25,483 --> 01:40:27,068
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2012
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:29,154
- Wait.
- What?

2013
01:40:30,405 --> 01:40:31,573
What happened?

2014
01:40:31,656 --> 01:40:33,408
What happened to us?

2015
01:40:38,246 --> 01:40:40,498
Remember the night we were on the beach?

2016
01:40:40,582 --> 01:40:42,167
I love that fucking night.

2017
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:46,004
Yeah, and we were naked
and everything was great.

2018
01:40:46,087 --> 01:40:47,922
Yeah, we got arrested.

2019
01:40:48,006 --> 01:40:48,923
I have an idea.

2020
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,135
Let's go to the beach.

2021
01:40:52,218 --> 01:40:53,720
Come on, let's go to the beach.

2022
01:40:54,846 --> 01:40:55,805
Are you fucking...

2023
01:40:57,724 --> 01:40:58,600
- Is that what you want?
- Oh my God.

2024
01:40:58,683 --> 01:40:59,684
You wanna go to the beach?

2025
01:40:59,767 --> 01:41:01,269
Let's go to the beach.

You wanna come to the beach?

2046
01:42:14,884 --> 01:42:17,554
[siren wailing]

2047
01:42:19,264 --> 01:42:21,099

Okay.

2057
01:42:58,178 --> 01:42:59,387
Stop the bike.

2071

[speaking in foreign language]

2081
01:44:31,521 --> 01:44:33,148
That's a lot of charges.

2082
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:34,774
Can you tell us what's gonna happen?

2083
01:44:34,858 --> 01:44:36,317
What happens now?

2084
01:44:36,401 --> 01:44:38,319
Depends on what the judge says on Monday.

2085
01:44:38,403 --> 01:44:39,946
- What?
- Wait, what do you mean?

2086

We can't stay here until Monday.

2090
01:44:46,411 --> 01:44:48,329
We can give the bail money or something.

2091
01:44:48,413 --> 01:44:49,664
It doesn't matter but we can't do Monday.

2092

01:46:45,905 --> 01:46:47,448
Put them on.

2108
01:46:47,532 --> 01:46:49,242
Wash your face, you'll feel better.

2109
01:46:50,368 --> 01:46:51,452
Thank you.

2110
01:46:51,536 --> 01:46:52,996
You will be fine.

Thanks.

2113
01:47:00,795 --> 01:47:01,921
Excuse me.

2114
01:47:20,983 --> 01:47:23,819
[speaking in foreign language] The court
finds the defendant guilty as charged

2115
01:47:23,902 --> 01:47:29,199
and passes a six month sentence,
suspended for three years

2116

as well as a €600 fine.

2117

It's okay.

2118
01:47:35,121 --> 01:47:38,333
It's six months, suspended

Where's Mickey? Where's my boyfriend?

2123
01:47:55,642 --> 01:47:57,018
Do you know what happened with him?

2124
01:47:57,101 --> 01:47:59,229
I think that his case was dismissed.

2125
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:01,815
Oh.

2126
01:48:01,898 --> 01:48:03,441
Okay.

2127
01:48:03,525 --> 01:48:05,735
Look, how do I get these...

2128
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:07,153
Don't worry about the clothes.

2129
01:48:07,237 --> 01:48:08,071
It's okay.

2130
01:48:09,113 --> 01:48:10,490
Thank you.

What are you doing here?

2137
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:50,113
I thought you were getting out at 12.

2138
01:48:53,116 --> 01:48:55,118

01:49:00,081 --> 01:49:01,708
I got out. I got out early.

2143
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:03,084
Well, obviously you got out early.

2144
01:49:03,168 --> 01:49:05,879
How did you get out
early? Stop touching me.

2145
01:49:05,962 --> 01:49:07,172
How did you get out?

2146
01:49:08,882 --> 01:49:09,716
I got out.

2147
01:49:10,842 --> 01:49:12,302
I made some phone calls.

2148
01:49:12,385 --> 01:49:16,848
I tried to call somebody,
I called Argyris and he...

2149
01:49:17,974 --> 01:49:19,934
Argyris got you out?

2150
01:49:20,018 --> 01:49:22,353
He hooked me up with someone
and I tried to get out

2151
01:49:22,437 --> 01:49:23,771
and I tried to get you out.

2152
01:49:23,855 --> 01:49:25,273
Who? Who did he hook you up with?

2153
01:49:25,356 --> 01:49:26,608
It doesn't matter.

2154
01:49:26,691 --> 01:49:29,861
Who did he hook you up with, Mickey?

2155
01:49:31,613 --> 01:49:33,198
Who did he hook you up with?

2156
01:49:34,491 --> 01:49:35,533
He called Christos.

2157
01:49:39,078 --> 01:49:41,789
- It's fine.
- You called Christos?

2158
01:49:41,873 --> 01:49:46,878
And Christos got you out
and you left me there?

2159
01:49:48,046 --> 01:49:49,339
I didn't leave you there, hold on.

2160
01:49:49,422 --> 01:49:50,298
- You left me there.
- I didn't leave you there.

2161
01:49:50,381 --> 01:49:51,466
I was gonna come back for you-

2162
01:49:51,549 --> 01:49:54,052
- For three fucking
days you left me there.

2163
01:49:54,135 --> 01:49:55,553
Listen to me.

2164
01:49:55,637 --> 01:49:58,097
I talked to him, I asked
him if he can get you out,

2165
01:49:58,181 --> 01:50:00,141
ask the DA or whatever and he said...

2166
01:50:00,225 --> 01:50:02,977
Any fucking idea what
you have fucking done?

2167
01:50:03,061 --> 01:50:03,895
Calm down. Listen to me.

2168
01:50:03,978 --> 01:50:05,647
No, I won't fucking calm down.

2169
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:07,273
You called fucking Christos...

2170
01:50:07,357 --> 01:50:08,942
- Yes I did.
- And you left me

2171
01:50:09,025 --> 01:50:10,819
- in fucking prison.
- I didn't wanna leave you.

2172
01:50:10,902 --> 01:50:12,320
I didn't wanna leave you, listen to me.

2173
01:50:12,403 --> 01:50:16,866
For the fucking weekend
while you fucking sit here.

2174
01:50:17,408 --> 01:50:18,243
God, fuck you.

2175
01:50:19,577 --> 01:50:22,747
Oh my God, what am I fucking doing?

2176
01:50:22,831 --> 01:50:24,040
Fuck me?

2177
01:50:24,123 --> 01:50:25,333
Fuck me?

2178
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:26,918
Did I get us in jail?

2179
01:50:28,378 --> 01:50:30,088
Did I fucking hit a cop?

2180
01:50:30,171 --> 01:50:33,424
Did I tell me to take
my fucking clothes off?

2181
01:50:33,508 --> 01:50:34,717
Did I wanna run around fucking naked?

2182
01:50:34,801 --> 01:50:36,511
You dumb fucking thing!

2183
01:50:36,594 --> 01:50:38,847
Is that me? Did I wanna fuck with you?

2184
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:40,265
Or was that you?

2185
01:50:45,603 --> 01:50:47,480
You hit a fucking cop.

2186
01:50:47,564 --> 01:50:50,358
I tried to get you out, he
couldn't fucking get you out.

2187
01:50:50,441 --> 01:50:52,318
I had to come here for fucking Hector

2188
01:50:52,402 --> 01:50:53,570
'cause I didn't know when the fuck

2189
01:50:53,653 --> 01:50:55,363
we were gonna get out and here we are.
