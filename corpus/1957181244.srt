(whistling)

9
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:39,923
- [zoey] why is it
always that song?

10
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,298
- What do you mean?

11
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,596
- Whenever you get
drunk, you sing--

12
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,366
- buzzed.

13
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:47,568
- Whenever you get drunk,
you sing the most cliched

14
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:49,372
scottish song in existence.

15
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:52,738
- And?

16
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:54,509
- It's like if I sang
god bless america

17
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:56,511
every time I had one too many.

18
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:58,777
- I'd actually like to see that.

19
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:00,845
♪ god bless america ♪

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,583
- that's not even close.

21
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:04,288
- Can you fetch some ice?

22
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:05,487
- Haven't you had enough?

23
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:06,950
- Well if I'm gonna
be a cliched scotsman,

24
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:08,160
I might as well go
all out and drink

25
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,458
myself into a stupor, right?

26
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,296
- That does need see--

27
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,792
- [liam] in fact, while
you're at it, why don't you

28
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:15,233
fetch my kilt and bagpipes
so we can truly do it proper?

29
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:20,700
- You wanna know the real
reason I hate that song?

30
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:22,207
- Because the colonies have
never produced anything

31
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,099
as achingly beautiful.

32
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:26,035
- It's about a guy
who's never going

33
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,245
to see his true love again.

34
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,379
That makes me sad.

35
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:32,943
- Well it's supposed
to make you sad.

36
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,076
It's scottish.

37
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:38,949
- So what did you
think of the movie?

38
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:40,588
- I hate watching myself.

39
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:44,053
- Bullshit, you love
watching yourself.

40
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:47,397
- I don't know, it was a bit

41
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:49,399
more abstract than I
thought it would be.

42
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:51,203
- The audience
seemed to love it.

43
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,503
- They did, didn't they?

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,342
- I thought the love
scene was beautiful.

45
00:02:58,377 --> 00:02:59,068
- Yeah?

46
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,676
- You and olivia
have great chemistry.

47
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,480
- I have to say it's a little
unnerving going to a party

48
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:07,813
where everyone's just seen
your cock on a 50-foot screen.

49
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:09,221
I mean, you know,
it's one thing when

50
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,223
you're on set, you've
just got a director--

51
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,325
- I know how it works, babe,
I've done nude scenes before.

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,151
- Really, when?

53
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,329
- Stephen truth's thesis
film, my senior year.

54
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,188
- Oh, right.

55
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:22,465
Yeah, that piece of
shite, what was it called?

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,401
Pointless purple?

57
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:26,095
- Careless turquoise.

58
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,031
- Right, christ,
what a clusterfuck.

59
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:32,343
We got any olives?

60
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,311
- Check the fridge.

61
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:38,349
- So you were nude in
reckless turquoise?

62
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,418
- Careless turquoise, and yes.

63
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:42,210
- You sure?

64
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,046
Which scene was it?

65
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,390
- The first one, the opening.

66
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,260
- And you were naked in that?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,460
- Like just topless,
or the full monty?

68
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:53,023
- The full monty, you
don't remember that?

69
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,398
- Christ, I barely
remembered my name

70
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,531
half the time back then.

71
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:56,631
Are we out of olives?

72
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,434
- I don't know.

73
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,601
Babe, you were clean by then.

74
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,306
We'd been dating for--

75
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,604
those are onions.

76
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,440
- I know.

77
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,069
Gonna make a gibson.

78
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:07,477
- What's a gibson?

79
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:10,282
- That's a martini with an
onion instead of an olive.

80
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,481
Son of a fucking--

81
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,486
(lid popping)

82
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:19,489
you wanna know why
it's called a gibson?

83
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:21,887
So there was this investment
banker named gibson,

84
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:24,219
who would take his
clients out to lunch

85
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:25,462
and pump the fuckers full of gin

86
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:28,597
so they'd make fiscally
irresponsible decisions.

87
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:30,335
Meanwhile, gibson would
get the bartender to fill

88
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,502
a martini glass with water
and then put an onion in it

89
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:35,406
so he could tell the difference
between his and theirs.

90
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,067
They'd be three
sheets to the wind,

91
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:39,102
coughing up cash left and
right, and he'd sit there

92
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:40,774
sober, sipping on
his onion water.

93
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:42,710
Try it?

94
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:50,014
- It tastes like a martini.

95
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,521
- So it does.

96
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:53,292
So stephen truth saw you naked.

97
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:55,657
- You went to the premiere.

98
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,365
(phone buzzing)

99
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,830
you were clean by then, right?

100
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,196
(phone pinging)

101
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:08,032
right?

102
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,232
- Yes, yeah, I was clean.

103
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,004
- Look me in the eye and say it.

104
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:17,448
- Yes, zoey, I was clean.

105
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,781
I have been clean,
relatively speaking,

106
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,211
ever since jenny died.

107
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,786
That's right, I'm not
supposed to mention her.

108
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,051
- Don't be ridiculous.

109
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:28,283
- Since she who must
not be mentioned died.

110
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:29,493
- I never said
anything like that.

111
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:30,560
- No, that's the thing,
you don't have to.

112
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:31,957
You get this look in your eye,

113
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,464
and then you're in a funk
for the rest of the day.

114
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,401
- Well how am I supposed to
react when you mention her?

115
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,699
- I don't know.

116
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:40,229
- Neither do I, that's
the fucking problem.

117
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:43,639
Who you texting?

118
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:44,838
- I'm texting nick.

119
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:46,510
- This late?

120
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,138
- He's in vegas with some of
the suits from the network.

121
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,272
That's why he wasn't
at the party tonight.

122
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:59,017
Jesus.

123
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:01,525
(soft music)

124
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,499
what the fuck, zoey?

125
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,566
- We'll lose the
security deposit.

126
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10,732
- So, it's not your money.

127
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,360
- It's not yours either.

128
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:13,867
- Trust me, the old man loves
being forced to spend money

129
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:15,935
on me, makes him actually
feel like a father.

130
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,037
- You said you quit.

131
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:20,742
- Do we have to fight
about this tonight?

132
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,678
- This is not a fight.

133
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:24,614
- [liam] sure as
shit ain't fucking.

134
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:25,450
- Fucking?

135
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:29,278
Is that what we
do, liam, we fuck?

136
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,456
- Zoey, that's not what I meant.

137
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,754
- Then have at it,
go ahead, fuck me.

138
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,152
- Jesus christ,
it's an expression.

139
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:37,858
- You making another drink?

140
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:38,793
- Bingo, sherlock.

141
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:40,696
- I think you've had enough.

142
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,698
- You're entitled
to your opinion.

143
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,965
- Social drinking,
that's what we agreed on.

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,803
- Trust me, that
is what I'm doing.

145
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,267
(soft music)

146
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:52,444
you and your
insecurities are breaking

147
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,369
the fire code in
here, you know that?

148
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:55,612
- Jesus.
- Excuse me?

149
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,614
- You think I don't
know what this is about?

150
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,374
- What is this about,
liam, educate me.

151
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,046
- You're losing your shite
because I was talking

152
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:03,653
to my costar at the
afterparty of the premiere

153
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,655
of the film that she
and I costarred in.

154
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,922
Forgive me if I didn't realize
that was a capital offense.

155
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,926
(soft music)

156
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:15,467
(chattering)

157
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,143
- she couldn't keep
her hands off of you.

158
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:33,309
- [liam] she was drunk.

159
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:34,651
- And you were sober?

160
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,950
- I was drinking socially.

161
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:38,523
- [zoey] you weren't
fighting her off.

162
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,350
- Fighting her off, she's olivia
st. James, for christ sake.

163
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:42,626
- And?

164
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,595
- And she's won a
golden globe, a bafta,

165
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,828
been nominated for an emmy,
nominated for an oscar,

166
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:49,028
and she was on the cover
of vogue last month.

167
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:51,063
- If she needs a new agent,
I know where to send her.

168
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:56,464
- All right, so you're
telling me that if a drunk,

169
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,103
I don't know, ryan gosling,
leaned on you a bit

170
00:07:58,138 --> 00:07:59,368
at a party, you'd tell him
to fuck off, you'd do that?

171
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:01,040
- Wouldn't kiss
him on the cheek.

172
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,613
- You don't know that.

173
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,472
- Why, because I've never
worked with an a-lister before?

174
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:06,012
- That's not what I said.

175
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:07,475
- I don't know anything about
how hollywood works, right,

176
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,718
because I'm just another
waitress with head shots?

177
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,379
- Zoey, you starred in a pilot.

178
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:11,215
- Never got picked up.

179
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,524
- Well neither has mine.

180
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,021
- But it will be,
and you know it.

181
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:17,562
(jazz music)

182
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,228
- look, merrick will get
you into his next film,

183
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,329
and we'll all move to
beverly fucking hills

184
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:27,605
and live happily ever after.

185
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,169
(jazz music)

186
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,648
besides, you didn't see
me shitting my knickers

187
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,243
over the two of
you at the party.

188
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:42,818
- I was networking.

189
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:43,621
- So was I.

190
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:49,924
- Merrick's got a great
idea for his next film.

191
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,222
- Hmm.

192
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:52,487
- He wants to cast
me as the lead.

193
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,093
- (laughs) I'm sure he does.

194
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:58,603
- It's not like that.

195
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,837
- Bollocks, he fancies
you, and you know it.

196
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:03,267
- They almost fired you.

197
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,271
Showed up to the set
high on your first day.

198
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,341
- I don't, I don't know
what you're talking about.

199
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,980
- Merrick told me tonight.

200
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:18,447
- Zoey, my character was
supposed to be high as a kite,

201
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,592
all right, I was
living truthfully

202
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,055
under imaginary circumstances.

203
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,452
Isn't that what they
taught you in drama school?

204
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:25,861
- Substance abuse is not art.

205
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:28,864
- I wasn't snorting
cocaine, zoey, it was pot.

206
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,768
- There's this thing called
acting, you should try it.

207
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,639
- You ever seen easy rider?

208
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,432
Dennis hopper and--

209
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,774
- peter fonda.

210
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,567
- Peter fucking fonda were
bloody baked every day

211
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:40,711
of that goddamn film.

212
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,943
- [zoey] and that
gives you an excuse?

213
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:43,747
- Well it gives me precedent.

214
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:46,618
- The only reason lowenstein
didn't fire your ass

215
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,411
is because merrick
fought for you.

216
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:51,447
- Well I guess I owe him a big
sloppy blowjob then, don't I?

217
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:53,625
- You made a promise.

218
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,253
- What promise?

219
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:57,662
- [zoey] you promised you
would never do drugs again.

220
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,993
- Drugs?

221
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:00,456
Zoey, for the thousandth time,

222
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:02,293
it was marijuana
for christ sake.

223
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:06,638
- You made a promise,
and you broke it.

224
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:09,498
You broke your promise, liam.

225
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:14,173
Don't ever do that again.

226
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,209
(record scratching)

227
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,687
(door knocking)

228
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:26,856
(soft dramatic music)

229
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:02,694
merrick.

230
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,761
- Hey, zoey.

231
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:08,326
- Merrick, long
time no see, mate.

232
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,868
- Liam, how's it going?

233
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:12,704
- Good.

234
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,234
- This is yours.

235
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:16,631
- Oh my gosh.

236
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,073
- Yeah, one of the
valets found it.

237
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,635
- Do you want a drink?

238
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,010
- Oh, babe, it's
late, I'm sure--

239
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:23,880
- yeah, I'd love
a drink, actually.

240
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:31,184
- Make him one of
those gilberts, babe.

241
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:36,222
- [liam] it's called a gibson.

242
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:37,696
- Right, a gibson.

243
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,963
Tell him the story, babe,
how it got its name.

244
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:42,998
- I don't think he
really wants to hear--

245
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,593
- no, no, go ahead.

246
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,771
- [zoey] so, there's
this loan shark.

247
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,695
- It was an investment banker.

248
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,070
- Right, a banker.

249
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:50,742
So this banker named gibson
would take his clients

250
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,910
out to lunch, and ask the
bartender to put an onion

251
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:55,945
in his martini instead of
an olive so that he could

252
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,244
tell his drink apart
from the clients'.

253
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,751
- The whole point of the
story is that he would serve

254
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,545
his clients martinis
so they'd get drunk,

255
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,218
then he would drink water
from a martini glass.

256
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,351
The onion was just
so that he didn't

257
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:07,858
accidentally drink the booze.

258
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,761
- How hard is it to tell
drinks apart when yours

259
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,622
is in front of you and
mine is in front of me?

260
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:16,933
- Well it's just a story,
mate, I didn't write it.

261
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,073
- Thanks.
- Manga.

262
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:28,010
(glasses clinking)

263
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,743
- tastes like a martini.

264
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:36,953
- That's what I said.

265
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,548
- Well we were out of olives.

266
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,154
- Am I supposed
to eat the onion?

267
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:44,829
- Not if you're kissing anyone.

268
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,998
- Congratulations
again, merrick.

269
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,835
The audience really
did seem to love it.

270
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,627
- Did they?

271
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,566
No seriously, I was
in the parking deck.

272
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,172
Did they like it?

273
00:12:58,207 --> 00:12:59,173
- You didn't watch it?

274
00:12:59,208 --> 00:12:59,976
- Why not?

275
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:02,946
- I couldn't, not this one.

276
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:09,854
Well I should probably get--

277
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,823
- no, tell liam about
your next script.

278
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,187
- If you need to
go, mate, that's.

279
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,321
- Babe, this idea is genius.

280
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:20,656
Please stay, tell us about it.

281
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:23,901
(soft dramatic music)

282
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,534
(piano playing)

283
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,648
(soft dramatic music)

284
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:07,604
- well, liam, I wanted to
cast you as the male lead.

285
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:11,916
- Splendid, what about zoey?

286
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,017
- She'd be the female
lead, of course.

287
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:16,415
- Of course.

288
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,858
Look, mate, I'm sorry,
I'm fucking exhausted.

289
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:30,429
What's that?

290
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,036
- That's cocaine.

291
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,532
- [zoey] holy shit, merrick.

292
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,305
- [merrick] remember
joshua tree?

293
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,770
- [zoey] what happened
at joshua tree?

294
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,046
- [merrick] lowenstein
shook my hand after

295
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:44,377
he saw the dailies,
said you were the second

296
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:45,642
coming of james dean.

297
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,117
- What's going on?

298
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:55,322
- He didn't tell you?

299
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:03,759
Easy, easy, whoa, whoa.

300
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:04,969
Nobody's dying tonight.

301
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,104
- Play some music, babe.

302
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,603
So do we use a
dollar bill or what?

303
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:16,739
- Zoey, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have.

304
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,279
- No, let's do it.

305
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:19,610
Let's do cocaine.

306
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:22,613
Babe?

307
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:36,132

(snorting)

320
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:55,244
- oh.

321
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,611
- [merrick] god damn.

322
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:05,716
(snorting)

323
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:08,290

(dog barking)

(jazz music)

327
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:48,099
- so the working title
is venus in the brook.

328
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,397
- Is that like a velvet
underground reference,

329
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:50,497
like venus in furs?

330
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,698
- You a fan?

331
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:54,765
- Fuck yeah, mate.

332
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,272
- [merrick] favorite album?

333
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:57,471
- Loaded, and you?

334
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,441
- Same, the same,
favorite track?

335
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:02,080
- Oh, sweet nothing, you?

336
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,709
- Same, same.

337
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,448
What about you, you
a fan of velvet's?

338
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:08,746
- Ah, she hates lou reed.

339
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:11,287
- I don't hate lou
reed, his voice is--

340
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,587
anyway, so the name of the
project is venus in furs?

341
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:17,051
- Nope, that's the
name of the song.

342
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:18,954
- Venus in the brook.

343
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:21,693
- Right, and it takes place
in a cabin in the woods.

344
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:25,268
- Christ, is this a
fucking horror movie?

345
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:26,797
- No, it's not.

346
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:28,139
You're getting ahead of me.

347
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,239
Yes, it takes place in
a cabin in the woods,

348
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,340
most of it at least.

349
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,968
- But there's some
backstory that you--

350
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:34,805
- spielberg said you
should be able to explain

351
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,445
the plot of a film
in 25 words or less.

352
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,008
- Sounds a bit reductive to me.

353
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:41,515
- What, you think the greatest
filmmaker to walk the face

354
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,077
of the fucking
earth is reductive?

355
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,749
Is that what you think?

356
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:47,290
- You think spielberg,
steven spielberg, is the--

357
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,325
wow, okay.

358
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,691
- Et, jurassic park,
indiana fucking jones.

359
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:53,791
- And you're positive those are

360
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:56,266
his greatest works, like 100%?

361
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,730
- Who would you say
is best then, kubrick?

362
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:00,930
- Well as a matter of fact I--

363
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,307
- come on, kubrick
films are boring, okay.

364
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:07,277
People just like the
hard-on they give themselves

365
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,179
when they say
their favorite film

366
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,576
is doctor fucking strangelove.

367
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:13,184
(jazz music)

368
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,320
- what do you think, zoey?

369
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,190
Who do you think is the
greatest filmmaker of all time?

370
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,016
- Don't smoke in here, mate.

371
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:22,358
- He can smoke if he wants to.

372
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,229
To answer your question,
I don't think there is

373
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,626
a greatest filmmaker
of all time.

374
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:27,957
That's like saying
there's the greatest food

375
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,629
of all time, or a
greatest romance.

376
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:30,993
One couple's love story
isn't better than another's.

377
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:33,204
It might be more moving,
but it's not better.

378
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,833
- You don't think you
and liam are special?

379
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,243
- I didn't say that.

380
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,348
- Well, I think our love
story is the greatest one.

381
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,713
- So what's the backstory?

382
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,354
- So there's this rock star,
and he's really burned out

383
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:55,721
from the industry and he's
sick of all the bullcrap.

384
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,856
So he goes to this
cabin in the woods

385
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,264
to make a new album
where he's free

386
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,332
from all the
distractions and whatnot.

387
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,927
- It's not a horror movie?

388
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:05,269
- Yeah.

389
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,833
So he's in this cabin
in like virginia, or,

390
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,538
yeah, virginia, north
carolina, in the mountains

391
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:13,838
and he's trying to stay
clean, no booze, no drugs.

392
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:18,172
While he's there, he
meets this beautiful girl.

393
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:19,349
- Venus in the brook?

394
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,548
- [merrick] exactly.

395
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,384
- Right, let me guess,
she becomes his muse

396
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,045
or some shite, right?

397
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,354
- Well yeah, I mean,
it's a little more

398
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,421
complicated than that, but--

399
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,917
- of course it is.

400
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:29,557
- No, no, okay,
what I'm saying is,

401
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:32,692
prior to the film, there are
three things haunting him.

402
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:35,431
The death of his
mother, which he missed

403
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:36,762
because he was on tour,

404
00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:39,468
the death of his best
friend from aids.

405
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:40,964
- Christ.

406
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,768
- And the fact that he abandoned
the only girl he ever loved

407
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:44,770
to chase his dream
of being a rock star.

408
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:47,641
- So,

409
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,315
the film is about this
girl helping him vanquish

410
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,109
his inner demons in a way
that both affirms life

411
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:56,078
and gets the academy
to suck your cock?

412
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:58,322
- He's actually in
a drug-induced coma
the whole time.

413
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,587
The cabin is a metaphor.

414
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,755
(chuckling)

415
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:05,087
- you're serious?

416
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:06,990
A fucking coma?

417
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,960
Oh come on, you trying
to make a student film?

418
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:12,501
You gonna shoot in front
of bare white walls

419
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:15,097
with ugly actors and
shite audio, too?

420
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:19,805
- Gonna cast you as the lead,
so, one out of the three.

421
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:23,446
(jazz music)

422
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:26,317
(phone ringing)

423
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:28,781
- oh, I gotta take this.

424
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:31,113
Talk to me, nick.

425
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:33,390
(jazz music)

426
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:40,463
- it's a good concept.

427
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,499
Hey.

428
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,402
Look at me.

429
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,163
It's a good concept.

430
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,002
Now go sit, I'll make
you a real drink.

431
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,479
- [merrick] thanks.

432
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,385
- You're sure he wasn't drunk?

433
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,551
You got it in writing?

434
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,314
Ah, christ almighty, nick,

435
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:09,217
I could kiss you on
the fucking mouth.

436
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,560
- [merrick] hell of
a party tonight, huh?

437
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:12,561
- Oh for sure.

438
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:18,061
- Kinda wish I woulda
jumped in the pool, though.

439
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:21,471
- Oh yeah, clothed or unclothed?

440
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,263
- Unclothed.

441
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:25,332
It's been a while since I
last went skinny dipping.

442
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,575
I think I'm due.

443
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,578
- When was the last time?

444
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:31,008
(laughing)

445
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:32,812
- I appreciate that,
and I appreciate you,

446
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:34,616
you fucking slimy bastard.

447
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:38,521
Uhhhh, so where is it filming?

448
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:41,557
- It was in santa monica,

449
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:43,152
and we were bar hopping
down on main street.

450
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:46,155
And after copious
amounts of alcohol

451
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,597
and marijuana, we made
our way down to the beach.

452
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:51,028
(footsteps)

453
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:51,765
- well?

454
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:55,032
- Got picked up.

455
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:58,200
- [zoey] babe, I'm
so proud of you!

456
00:23:03,273 --> 00:23:05,416
- [merrick]
congratulations, man.

457
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,583
- Thanks, sodder.

458
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:08,716
Gaaaaa.

459
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,685
So, um, yeah, 12
episodes and we start

460
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,687
shooting in September.

461
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:13,952
- I'll pour the shots.

462
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:15,558
- Christ, I can't
even talk, ohhh.

463
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,023
- Filming here in town?

464
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:21,465
- No, georgia, actually.

465
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,763
- Georgia?

466
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,030
- Yeah, tax incentives
and all that shite.

467
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:27,438
- But they filmed
the pilot here.

468
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,363
- Yeah, georgia's
cheaper, apparently.

469
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:30,606
- How long's the shoot?

470
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:34,071
- Uh, I don't have a
schedule yet, but--

471
00:23:34,106 --> 00:23:35,743
- [merrick] ballpark?

472
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:36,645
- Seven months.

473
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,751
Thanks.

474
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,954
- Hey, to the new star
of the siren, season one.

475
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:51,924
(glasses clinking)

476
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:56,467
- ahhhh, I'll take those.

477
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,432
Merrick, I was being
an ass earlier.

478
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:06,840
If you do it right,
your idea could

479
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,611
have some serious potential.

480
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:09,513
- That's the key.

481
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,613
On paper it's a big cliche, but

482
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:12,175
the way I wanna do it, you know.

483
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,616
- Yeah, it's all about
the presentation.

484
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:16,278
- Exactly, exactly, it's
all about the presentation.

485
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:20,590
(muffled speaking)

486
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,824
(soft dramatic music)

487
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:29,962
- [merrick] zoey?

488
00:24:31,493 --> 00:24:32,800
- What's that?

489
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,703
- Venus in the brook,
it's a 21st-century update

490
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:36,133
on fellini's eight and a half?

491
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:38,575
- Oh, for sure.

492
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:41,336
For sure.

493
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:42,337
- Got a script?

494
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:44,306
- No, no, just concepts.

495
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,586
Hey, what if we
improv some scenes?

496
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,523
Like, right now?

497
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:01,598
(jazz music)

498
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,668
- so my character,
he's a rock star.

499
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:08,165
What kind of band
were you thinking?

500
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,969
The stones, nirvana,
one of those fucking

501
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:11,740
indy bands I never watch on snl?

502
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:14,644
- The rolling stones but
younger and still relevant.

503
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,074
- Christ, they
have to be english?

504
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:17,306
- Scottish is fine.

505
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:18,648
- Is the character
supposed to be scottish,

506
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,617
or are you just saying
that to make me happy?

507
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:22,916
- He's supposed to be scottish.

508
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:26,920
- Right, he's supposed
to be scottish,

509
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:31,221
and you're an arse kisser.

510
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:32,057
- Babe.

511
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,488
- [liam] what kinda
instrument does he play?

512
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:35,731
- Does it matter?

513
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,030
- I don't know,
merrick, does it matter

514
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:39,702
what kind of instrument
your protagonist plays?

515
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,836
- He plays piano, guitar, drums,

516
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:44,432
but he just sings in the band.

517
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:45,906
- A singer?

518
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:47,237
Have you heard me sing?

519
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:48,777
- We'll dub you over, liam.

520
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:51,208
- Yeah, or you'll just
steal my ideas and cast some

521
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:53,650
broadway fucker who can
hit a high c or some shite.

522
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:56,114
- I would never dream
of doing that liam

523
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:57,819
because you're such
a joy to work with.

524
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:00,591
- [liam] so what's
the name of the band?

525
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:01,922
- Band?

526
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:04,122
- [liam] my band,
what's it called.

527
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:06,322
- I don't know, I haven't
even written a treatment.

528
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:10,832
- Cellar doors.

529
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:12,768
- Here we go.

530
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,168
If I had a band, I always said
I would call it cellar doors.

531
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:20,039
- Isn't that similar
to just the doors?

532
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:22,305
- Thank you, that's
what I've always said.

533
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,571
- Cellar door is the
most beautiful phrase

534
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:25,473
in the english language.

535
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:26,617
You're a pretentious filmmaker,

536
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:27,618
haven't you seen donnie darko?

537
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:28,652
- I hate that movie.

538
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,412
- Bollocks.

539
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:31,754
You just like saying
you hate donnie darko

540
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,756
because you're afraid
of people labeling you.

541
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:34,823
- At least they've heard of me.

542
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:36,253
- Oh, have they?

543
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:39,454
Zoey, just off the top of
your head, what was the film

544
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:41,060
that won the palme d'or
at cannes last year.

545
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:42,457
- It's pronounced can.

546
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:44,360
- [liam] whatever,
what was it called?

547
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:46,835
- I don't know.

548
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,564
- Your point?

549
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,138
- Nobody gives a flying
fuck about artsy movies.

550
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:55,569
- [merrick] what, like
the one that we just did?

551
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:57,076
- You know what I mean.

552
00:26:57,111 --> 00:26:58,649
- You know what, I could throw
this bottle out the window

553
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:01,113
and hit 50 waiters who are
just as talented as you

554
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:03,082
and who would sell their
left testicle to act

555
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:05,788
in an artsy movie nobody
gives a flying fuck about.

556
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:10,452
Now do you wanna run the
scene or not? It's up to you.

557
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:12,828
(jazz music)

558
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:15,094
- so I'm a scottish
frontman of a band

559
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:18,702
similar to the rolling stones
called the cellar doors.

560
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,099
- Sure.

561
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:22,629
- You picturing jagger,
flamboyant and shite.

562
00:27:22,664 --> 00:27:23,707
- We're just
playing around, man,

563
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,104
do you really need to know?

564
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,535
- Yes, I do really need
to know this information.

565
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,779
I don't question your process,
so don't question mine.

566
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,980
Are you picturing jagger,
freddie mercury, johnny rotten?

567
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:34,817
- If you must know, kurt cobain.

568
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:36,478
- I asked you if you
were thinking nirvana,

569
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:37,644
and you said the stones.

570
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,789
- I want your character
to be tortured,

571
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,120
sensitive, you know?

572
00:27:41,155 --> 00:27:43,023
- People think of mick
jagger doing drugs,

573
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:45,025
they think those were
the good old days.

574
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,323
When they think of
cobain doing drugs,

575
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:48,589
they think, what a shame.

576
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,625
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

577
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,770
He's idolized and
pitied at the same time.

578
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,840
- So I'm at this cabin
in the woods to get away

579
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,876
from all the excess and
shite, and I'm walking

580
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:03,978
through the woods and I
come across this girl?

581
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:04,781
- Yes.

582
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,984
- Anything else I should
know before we begin?

583
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:12,316
- Your favorite color is
green, chinese food gives you

584
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:14,824
heartburn sometimes and
your first pet is a hamster

585
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,859
named colonel whiskers,
should I keep going?

586
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,894
- Fuck you.

587
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,428
- What about you, do
you need anything?

588
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:26,704
- No, I'm good.

589
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,597
- So is she bathing in a stream?

590
00:28:32,404 --> 00:28:33,205
Is she naked?

591
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:35,304
- Yeah.

592
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,749
- Should I step
around the corner?

593
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,379
(jazz music)

594
00:28:54,998 --> 00:28:57,801
(dress unzipping)

595
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,151
- action.

596
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:22,925
- Christ.

597
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:25,191

- sorry, I was just on a walk
and I heard someone singing.

602
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:48,852
- Do you know that song?

603
00:29:50,152 --> 00:29:51,745
- I'm sorry.

604
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,055
- The bonnie banks of loch
lomond, do you know it?

605
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:57,124
- Your mother used
to sing it to you.

606
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:01,997

Don't let her get away,
the scene's not over.

614
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:43,104
- Yes it is.

615
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:55,809
Did she have to be naked?

616
00:30:55,844 --> 00:30:56,953
- I made that choice.

617
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:09,933
- You can't just get naked
like that without telling me.

618
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,231
- I'm not allowed to get naked,

619
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:13,068
but when you decide to
do it, it's no big deal?

620
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,102
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

621
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:15,334
- I don't know, liam,

622
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:17,066
what could I possibly
be referring to?

623
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:21,945
- Is this about olivia?

624
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,342
- Bingo, sherlock.

625
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:24,948
- I told you about
that scene the second,

626
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,609
the fucking second
I got the script.

627
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:27,742
- You didn't tell me
it was gonna be nude

628
00:31:27,777 --> 00:31:29,117
until after you shot it.

629
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,712
- That's because we
didn't decide to go nude

630
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:32,054
until the last second.

631
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,024
- Really?

632
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:35,816
- Yes.

633
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:39,292
- Merrick?

634
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:42,394
- Yeah?

635
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:46,035
- [zoey] the scene in the movie
where liam and oliva fucked.

636
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,696
- [merrick] yeah?

637
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,137
- [zoey] liam says you guys
didn't make the call to go

638
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:51,304
full nude until right before
you shot it, is that true?

639
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:55,671
- He's right.

640
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,982
Lowenstein stepped in
at the last second,

641
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,577
said he figured
olivia st. James nude

642
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:03,118
would generate a lotta buzz.

643
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:07,958
I need to use the bathroom.

644
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,784
- It's that way.
- I know where it is.

645
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:20,300
(water running)

646
00:32:56,668 --> 00:32:59,207
(water running)

647
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:19,656
- so what did you
think of the scene?

648
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:22,032
(exhaling)

649
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,232
- how'd you two meet?

650
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,037
- I told you the story.

651
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:28,797
- Tell me again.

652
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,074
We're doing a meet cute scene.

653
00:33:39,414 --> 00:33:41,678
- You really wanna go
through that again?

654
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:45,352
- Well I was studying
theater at nyu.

655
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:50,060
Some of my friends took
me to this off-, off-,

656
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:54,658
way the fuck off-broadway
production of the
glass menagerie.

657
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:56,297
And liam played tom.

658
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:59,135
And his performance,

659
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,865
I stuck around to meet
him after the show,

660
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,868
and he was gracious
and charming.

661
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:10,872
And then his girlfriend
at the time showed up.

662
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,909
- What was her name again, liam?

663
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,384
- Jenny.

664
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:19,287
Jenny waltmire.

665
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:21,256
One of zoey's friends
that brought her

666
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,555
was making his thesis film.

667
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,293
He had already cast
zoey, and he convinced me

668
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:26,327
to read the script.

669
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:28,758
Next thing you know,
zoey and I are playing

670
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:30,397
lovers in a shitty student film.

671
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,136
- It wasn't shitty.

672
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,204
- It was three people
sitting in a room talking.

673
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,766
- It wasn't shitty.

674
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:38,306
- So what happened to jenny?

675
00:34:39,573 --> 00:34:41,441
- What about you, merrick,
you ever been in love?

676
00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:42,706
- I'm not the one
doing the scene.

677
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,147
- I fucking hate writers
who write about love

678
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,907
and shite and have
never experience that.

679
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:48,745
- Didn't seem to matter
for drinking with the pope.

680
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,153
- Well maybe I'm
growing as an actor.

681
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,484
- I've been in love.

682
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,123
- [liam] oh yeah,
what's the story?

683
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,389
- There is no story, she was
in love with someone else

684
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:56,786
and we never got together.

685
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:00,922
- I don't think that counts.

686
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,825
- Then don't act in
my fucking movies.

687
00:35:04,598 --> 00:35:06,334
- So who was this girl?

688
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,831
- We went to high school
together in minnesota.

689
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:13,209
She's married now, and
has two kids, two girls.

690
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:15,178
- What's her name?

691
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:19,347
- Jenny.

692
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:30,017
- My turn.

693
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:36,089
- Mind if I grab some water?

694
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:37,332
- There is a drought, mate.

695
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,273
(soft dramatic music)

696
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,770
(fan blowing)

697
00:35:46,805 --> 00:35:50,004
(soft dramatic music)

698
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,734
(sniffling)

699
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,281
(hard breathing)

700
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:30,286
(water running)

701
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,256
- I know I said it
at the party, man,

702
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,456
but seriously, you
did a great job.

703
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:37,359
- Thank you.

704
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,265
- I just wish I coulda
gotten zoey on it, you know?

705
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:45,202
Wrote the role for her.

706
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:06,014
You and olivia
were great, though.

707
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:07,081
Your chemistry was,

708
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:10,491
it was phenomenal.

709
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:14,858
- Thanks.

710
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:16,497
- It's like you two were
actually sleeping together.

711
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,637
That second night
in joshua tree.

712
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:27,706
- What the fuck are
you doing here tonight?

713
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,312
- That second night
in joshua tree,

714
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,238
all I saw was the hotel room
you went into after wrap.

715
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:33,448
- Did you?
- Yeah.

716
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:37,947
- And what does that prove?

717
00:37:37,982 --> 00:37:39,212
- Not a damn thing.

718
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:40,389
- That's right.

719
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,588
- You were probably
just running lines.

720
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:43,216
- We were probably
just running lines.

721
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:44,987
- That's all I have
are my theories.

722
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,959
- You're goddamn right.

723
00:37:49,994 --> 00:37:51,367
- [merrick] and conversations.

724
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:01,476
(inhaling)

725
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,714
(giggling)

726
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,918
- conversations with who?

727
00:38:14,953 --> 00:38:15,952
- With whom.

728
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:20,957
- Conversations with whom?

729
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,929
- What do you say, zoey,
wanna run the scene again?

730
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:28,228
- Sounds good to me,
what do you think, babe?

731
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,538
- I'm starting to fade.

732
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:33,376
- Why don't you give
him some more coke?

733
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,478
- No, no, if he's tired,
he can go ahead and crash.

734
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:37,314
It's his house.

735
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,878
Mind if I keep
running with zoey?

736
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,358
- You know what, I think
I'm good for another round.

737
00:38:58,161 --> 00:38:59,402
- Now I've got a few notes.

738
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,338
- Excuse me.

739
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:06,035
I liked how you shamelessly
let him see you naked,

740
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,411
but on this one,
let's switch it up.

741
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,743
Don't let him see
you naked, okay?

742
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:12,041
- Okay.

743
00:39:12,076 --> 00:39:14,175
- I liked your singing
too, but let's, uh,

744
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,077
let's do something different.

745
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:17,519
I want you to talk to yourself.

746
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:19,422
Remember, your character's a
figment of his imagination,

747
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:23,591
so what would his character
be talking to himself about?

748
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,088
- Do you think something--

749
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:29,256
- don't, don't tell
me, just do it.

750
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,928
- Okay (chuckles).

751
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:35,361
- And let's keep your
actual clothes on this time.

752
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:36,329
- Thank you.

753
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:37,539
- Got it.

754
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:38,606
- And for me?

755
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,972
- Yeah, uh, do your number.

756
00:39:43,976 --> 00:39:45,272
- Anything else?

757
00:39:45,307 --> 00:39:46,581
- Do you need anything else?

758
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,916
Okay, are we set?

759
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:53,951
- [liam] fucking set.

760
00:39:55,757 --> 00:39:57,020
(exhaling)

761
00:39:57,055 --> 00:39:58,692
- all right, you
know what, let's,

762
00:39:58,727 --> 00:40:00,496
let's do this one
in the living room.

763
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:19,944
(soft music)

764
00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:21,946
action.

765
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:28,590
- You've got to stop
beating yourself up over it.

766
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,086
I know, I know.

767
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:32,495
Well, no, I don't think you do.

768
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,497
That was a shitty thing to do.

769
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,126
I had to, you had to do it.

770
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:38,292
Did I?

771
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:39,392
Absolutely.

772
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:40,162
Why?

773
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:41,328
You know why?

774
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:42,934
He was holding you back.

775
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:44,331
Don't look at me, don't look.

776
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:45,640
- [liam] I'm sorry.

777
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:47,004
- What are you doing here?

778
00:40:47,974 --> 00:40:49,270
You were spying on me.

779
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:50,073
- No I wasn't.

780
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:51,107
- Don't come any closer.

781
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:52,845
- I was not spying on you.

782
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,519
I was on a walk, and I heard
someone talking, that's it.

783
00:40:58,523 --> 00:40:59,984
What's your name?

784
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:02,954
- Why do you wanna know?

785
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:10,093
- Not every day you come
across a beautiful woman

786
00:41:10,128 --> 00:41:11,534
bathing naked in a stream.

787
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:13,800
- Oh I get it.

788
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:15,901
You wanna fuck me.

789
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:19,003
- What, no.

790
00:41:19,038 --> 00:41:20,675
- [zoey] that's what you
wanna do, right, admit it.

791
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,742
You wanna fuck me.

792
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:27,913
- Don't look at me, answer her.

793
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:34,315
- Okay, the thought
crossed my mind.

794
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,217
- I'll bet it did.

795
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,351
- So what's your name?

796
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,994
- If I was ugly, would
you wanna know my name?

797
00:41:46,736 --> 00:41:49,539
If I was fat and old,
wrinkled, missing my teeth,

798
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:50,870
would you wanna know my name?

799
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:52,234
- I, I just asked
what your name was?

800
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:53,675
- [zoey] if you
didn't wanna fuck me,

801
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,105
would you want to know my name?

802
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:57,844
- Fine, I wanna know your name

803
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:59,340
because I wanna sleep with you.

804
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,748
- That's not what I asked.

805
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,245
I asked if you
didn't wanna fuck me,

806
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,016
would you wanna know my name?

807
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:06,919
- What do you want me to say?

808
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:09,020
- [zoey] how about the truth?

809
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:11,022
- Christ, why is
this such a big deal?

810
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,661
You meet a new person,
you ask them their name.

811
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,762
- Answer the question.

812
00:42:14,797 --> 00:42:17,094
(soft music)

813
00:42:20,462 --> 00:42:21,263
- fine.

814
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:23,738
If I didn't wanna fuck you,

815
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:26,004
I wouldn't give
a shit about you.

816
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,544
Is that what you want me to say?

817
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:29,711
- Only if you mean it.

818
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:31,878
- And cut.

819
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:34,408
(soft music)

820
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:39,886
- [zoey] how was that?

821
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:40,722
- Fascinating.

822
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,692
- You can say that again.

823
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,760
Sure as shite commit
to that choice, christ.

824
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:47,762
- Commitment always
impresses me.

825
00:42:47,797 --> 00:42:48,895
- [zoey] thank you.

826
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,798
- But I think it
blinds you sometimes.

827
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,965
Because you're so ferociously
committed to your choice

828
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,967
that it keeps you from
seeing the potential

829
00:42:55,002 --> 00:42:57,706
in the scene and letting
that potential develop.

830
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,565
At the beginning, while you
were talking to yourself,

831
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,039
you mentioned someone
holding you back.

832
00:43:01,074 --> 00:43:02,843
Let's explore that.

833
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:05,780
- What, right now?

834
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:07,980
- Why not?

835
00:43:08,015 --> 00:43:10,752
Let's take it from, from
were you spying on me?

836
00:43:10,787 --> 00:43:12,413
Liam, you had your
back turned to her.

837
00:43:13,922 --> 00:43:16,923
(soft upbeat music)

838
00:43:21,193 --> 00:43:21,994
action.

839
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,396
- You were spying on me.

840
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:29,903
- I wasn't spying.

841
00:43:29,938 --> 00:43:32,840
I promise, I was just on a walk
and I heard someone talking.

842
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:34,842
- What's your name?

843
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:39,539
- Why do you want to know?

844
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:43,818
Jerry, my name's jerry.

845
00:43:44,821 --> 00:43:46,447
What's yours?

846
00:43:46,482 --> 00:43:47,756
- Lola.

847
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,856
- Like the kinks song.

848
00:43:51,894 --> 00:43:52,695
Never mind.

849
00:43:53,522 --> 00:43:55,126
It's nice to meet you, lola.

850
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:56,622
- Likewise, jerry.

851
00:43:56,657 --> 00:43:58,360
- [merrick] ask her what
she was talking about.

852
00:43:58,395 --> 00:44:00,230
- What were you talking about?
- Subtly, asshole.

853
00:44:01,629 --> 00:44:02,728
- Who were you talking to?

854
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:08,040
- [zoey] I was talking to
myself, I do that sometimes.

855
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:11,439
- No judgment here. That's
the only way to have

856
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,177
an intelligent
conversation these days.

857
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,148
- You probably think I'm crazy.

858
00:44:17,183 --> 00:44:18,688
- [liam] aren't we all?

859
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:19,755
- Guess we are.

860
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:24,320
- Who was holding her
back, keep pushing.

861
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,323
- Um, you should hear
some of the conversations

862
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:28,797
I have with myself.

863
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,897
- Oh yeah, what do
you guys talk about?

864
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:31,327
- You know, politics,
the weather.

865
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,464
No, I tend to beat myself up,

866
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:39,874
about the stupid
shite I've done.

867
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:41,711
I guess we have that in common.

868
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,075
- Don't let him in, lola.

869
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:45,748
- Have you ever
abandoned someone?

870
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:48,509
- Sorry?

871
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:50,511
- Have you ever abandoned
someone who loved you,

872
00:44:50,546 --> 00:44:51,853
someone who would
have given anything,

873
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:53,888
done anything just
to make you happy?

874
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,891
(soft music)

875
00:44:56,926 --> 00:44:57,892
- I'm a little fuzzy
on the backstory.

876
00:44:57,927 --> 00:44:59,223
Did he abandon someone?

877
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:01,764
- You tell me, liam.

878
00:45:03,262 --> 00:45:05,196
- Christ sake, man, how many
times do I have to tell you?

879
00:45:05,231 --> 00:45:06,835
Do not use my name when
you're directing me.

880
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,871
- Did he abandon someone, jerry?

881
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,874
- Why do you ask, lola?

882
00:45:13,943 --> 00:45:15,536
- Why don't you answer?

883
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:17,780
- [liam] don't know, it's a
strange question, I guess.

884
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,881
- Guilty eyes.

885
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,245
- What?

886
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,720
- [zoey] you have guilty
eyes, that's why I asked.

887
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,613
- Tell her, tell her,
tell her the truth.

888
00:45:28,254 --> 00:45:31,354
- Okay, I abandoned
someone who loved me.

889
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:32,124
- Why?

890
00:45:32,995 --> 00:45:33,895
Why did you do it?

891
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,193
- Tell her, tell her why.

892
00:45:35,228 --> 00:45:36,392
- Because she was
holding me back.

893
00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:37,690
- That's not good enough, lola.

894
00:45:37,725 --> 00:45:38,801
- [zoey] how was she
holding you back?

895
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:39,868
- She just was.

896
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,034
- [merrick] still
not good enough.

897
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:41,936
- What was she
holding you back from?

898
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:42,772
- I don't know.

899
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:45,940
She just was.

900
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:47,040
- Tell her the truth.

901
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:48,371
- What was she
holding you back from?

902
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:49,372
What was she holding
you back from?

903
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:50,703
- He's running away, lola.

904
00:45:50,738 --> 00:45:51,946
- [zoey] what was she
holding you back from?

905
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:53,574
- Punish her, liam, destroy her.

906
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:54,377
- [zoey] what was she
holding you back from?

907
00:45:54,412 --> 00:45:55,983
- From everything, okay!

908
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:59,547
She was a goddamn cinder
block dragging me.

909
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:01,615
No, you know what,
she was a noose,

910
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,825
a fucking noose around my neck.

911
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,651
And I couldn't breathe

912
00:46:04,686 --> 00:46:07,654
without her
insecurities choking me!

913
00:46:09,196 --> 00:46:10,096
And you know what?

914
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:15,871
The day I left her was the
best goddamn day of my life.

915
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:19,974
- Did you love her?

916
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:23,945
- No.

917
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,211
(soft music)

918
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:31,744
(sniffling)

919
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:32,547
- cut.

920
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:38,927
(record stopping)

921
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,961
that was great, you guys.

922
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:42,194
(sighing)

923
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:46,495
- how is this helping?

924
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:53,172
I feel like we're chasing
rabbits or some shite.

925
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,947
- You okay?

926
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,047
- Oh, christ.

927
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:02,478
I'm fine.

928
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,993
- How'd you feel about that one?

929
00:47:12,028 --> 00:47:13,225
- It was okay.

930
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:20,870
- Do you feel like we're
chasing rabbits or some shite?

931
00:47:24,502 --> 00:47:26,766
- What are you trying
to say with this piece?

932
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,673
(phone buzzing)

933
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,118
(sighing)

934
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,860
(phone buzzing)

935
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:53,100
(phone pinging)

936
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:58,765
(groaning)

937
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:04,078
why do you need
to tell the story?

938
00:48:04,113 --> 00:48:06,443
- Maybe I just wanna show off.

939
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:09,017
- That's a shitty
reason to make a movie.

940
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,612
- Well I coulda said money.

941
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:12,548
- Yeah, but this
won't make any money.

942
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,992
- It could.

943
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,293
- Maybe if you cast
olivia st. James.

944
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,399
(groaning)

945
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,010
(hard breathing)

946
00:48:39,511 --> 00:48:42,545
(phone buzzing)

947
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,810
- you know that
wasn't my call, right?

948
00:48:43,845 --> 00:48:46,417
- Of course, that
was the evil empire.

949
00:48:46,452 --> 00:48:47,253
- Exactly.

950
00:48:49,587 --> 00:48:51,994
- The same evil empire that
apparently wiped their asses

951
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,963
with olivia's contract
at the last second

952
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:55,624
and made her go nude.

953
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:57,395
She was always
going to be naked.

954
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:00,134
Liam just didn't have the
balls to tell me upfront.

955
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:03,137
I know that shit doesn't fly,
not on union sets at least.

956
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:04,435
- Zoey, I wrote
that role for you.

957
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,140
- She's gonna win
an oscar for it.

958
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:07,306
- But you're better than she is.

959
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:09,671
- Then why the fuck
am I waiting tables?

960
00:49:09,706 --> 00:49:11,376
- Zoey, it's just
a matter of time.

961
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,150
(crying)

962
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:18,647
- my agency dropped me.

963
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:23,850
Did you know that?

964
00:49:23,885 --> 00:49:24,653
- [merrick] yeah.

965
00:49:24,688 --> 00:49:26,094
- You did?

966
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,161
- Liam told me.

967
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:32,529
- What else has he told you?

968
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:38,172
- I wish I knew, that
accent of his, you know.

969
00:49:46,314 --> 00:49:48,050
So that night on my
birthday when I went

970
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,019
skinny dipping in the pacific,

971
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,814
I'd gotten kicked out of a bar.

972
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,653
I was in the bathroom and I,

973
00:49:57,688 --> 00:50:02,031
I started slamming the
door, over and over and

974
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:02,999
over again.

975
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,927
But one of the bouncers
heard me, caught me.

976
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,964
Kicked me outta the bar.

977
00:50:11,999 --> 00:50:14,670
I went peacefully, I even
asked him what his name was.

978
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,673
- Look, merrick, it's
been a blast and a half,

979
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,972
but I am fucking exhausted.

980
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:20,874
I think it's time.

981
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:24,350
(snorting)

982
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:27,188
- [merrick] you were saying?

983
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:28,684
- I think you should leave.

984
00:50:29,918 --> 00:50:31,324
- [merrick] I think you
should do another line.

985
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,358
- No thanks.

986
00:50:35,462 --> 00:50:36,989
- I'm offering you
free drugs, man.

987
00:50:37,024 --> 00:50:39,431
You realize how much
this stuff costs?

988
00:50:39,466 --> 00:50:40,762
- If you'd like make a donation,

989
00:50:40,797 --> 00:50:42,368
I accept cash or
traveler's check.

990
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:45,767
- Come on, I feel like we're
on the verge of a breakthrough.

991
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:46,570
- Yeah?

992
00:50:48,277 --> 00:50:49,474
What kind of a breakthrough?

993
00:50:53,315 --> 00:50:55,942
Look, I'm tired.

994
00:50:55,977 --> 00:50:58,120
Zoey has to work in
less than 12 hours.

995
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:01,387
(snorting)

996
00:51:01,422 --> 00:51:02,223
jesus.

997
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:04,654
- Ohhh, phewwww.

998
00:51:10,266 --> 00:51:12,728
I feel like we're on the
verge of a breakthrough.

999
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:19,075
(banging)

1000
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:24,113
(snorting)

1001
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:24,938
- ahhh.

1002
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,182
Fuck me.

1003
00:51:29,648 --> 00:51:32,616
- You never finished the story
of how you two got together.

1004
00:51:33,817 --> 00:51:35,289
- Christ, we have to
go through this again?

1005
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:38,094
- [merrick] I need to hear
it again, man, just trust me.

1006
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:42,263
(exhaling)

1007
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:44,298
- so I was dating someone
else when I met zoey.

1008
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,959
- Jenny waltmire.

1009
00:51:45,994 --> 00:51:47,499
- Yes.

1010
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:49,336
- [merrick] how serious was it?

1011
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:51,272
- I was 20 years old,
how serious could it be?

1012
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:54,000
- My parents go
married at 18, so.

1013
00:51:54,035 --> 00:51:55,441
- That's because
you're fucking amish.

1014
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:56,343
- Mennonite.

1015
00:51:56,378 --> 00:51:57,410
- Tomahto, tomato.

1016
00:51:57,445 --> 00:51:59,005
- It was pretty serious.

1017
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,579
- It was as serious as it
coulda been at that age, okay?

1018
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:03,108
We'll put it that way.

1019
00:52:03,143 --> 00:52:04,384
- [merrick] fair enough.

1020
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:13,195
(exhaling)

1021
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,526
- jenny and I were, um--

1022
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:17,232
- heroin addicts.

1023
00:52:23,372 --> 00:52:25,130
(exhaling)

1024
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:25,900
- oh christ.

1025
00:52:27,035 --> 00:52:29,409
(fan blowing)

1026
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,480
her father back in arkansas,

1027
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:38,253
he had been.

1028
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:46,426
She needed an escape.

1029
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:53,202
Even though he was
1,000 miles away,

1030
00:52:54,436 --> 00:52:55,237
she needed an escape.

1031
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,182
So we started experimenting.

1032
00:53:10,749 --> 00:53:13,420
(dramatic music)

1033
00:53:26,061 --> 00:53:27,632
five months later,
she overdosed.

1034
00:53:28,734 --> 00:53:31,933
(soft dramatic music)

1035
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:38,874
zoey was there for me
during the grieving process.

1036
00:53:40,812 --> 00:53:43,417
(fan blowing)

1037
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:46,420
(soft dramatic music)

1038
00:53:52,593 --> 00:53:54,923
- let's do another scene.

1039
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:57,057
The one where she leaves him.

1040
00:53:57,092 --> 00:53:58,630
- And why'd she do that?

1041
00:53:58,665 --> 00:54:01,435
- Oh, well, guess we'll
find out, won't we?

1042
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:04,438
I want you to enter the
room like you did before,

1043
00:54:04,473 --> 00:54:09,344
and you're gonna find her
packing her bags with, with me.

1044
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:13,414
- So you're gonna be
a part of the scene?

1045
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:15,042
- Why not?

1046
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:17,352
Why not, do you have any
questions before we start?

1047
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,146
- Guess I'm set.

1048
00:54:21,787 --> 00:54:25,426
- [merrick] what about
you, any questions?

1049
00:54:26,825 --> 00:54:29,331
- Did you take my
wallet outta my purse?

1050
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,994
- Who the fuck is this?

1051
00:54:34,635 --> 00:54:36,305
- Jerry, what are
you doing here?

1052
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,065
- You've got five fucking
seconds to tell me who the fuck

1053
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,968
this is before I rip
his goddamn face off.

1054
00:54:40,003 --> 00:54:41,002
- I'm richard.

1055
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:43,345
- Dick?

1056
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,445
- [merrick] richard.

1057
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,512
- Tell me, dicky,

1058
00:54:46,977 --> 00:54:48,515
you sleeping with her?

1059
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,780
- No.

1060
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:51,353
- Right, and I'm the
prince of fucking wales.

1061
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,322
- What you do with marine
mammals is your own business.

1062
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:55,115
(laughing)

1063
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:56,424
- oh, look at the
wise-ass on dick here.

1064
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,459
Tell me, you got any
good knock-knock jokes?

1065
00:54:58,494 --> 00:54:59,658
- Let's get outta here.

1066
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:02,991
- So that's it?

1067
00:55:04,797 --> 00:55:05,796
You're just gonna
run off into the may

1068
00:55:05,831 --> 00:55:07,292
fucking sunset with dicky here?

1069
00:55:07,327 --> 00:55:08,194
- Yes she is.

1070
00:55:08,229 --> 00:55:09,470
- Didn't ask you, fuckface.

1071
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,373
Lola?

1072
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,232
- Fuck you.

1073
00:55:14,675 --> 00:55:17,269
What am I to you,
some sort of prize?

1074
00:55:17,304 --> 00:55:18,974
You think if you can just
shoot straighter than the guy

1075
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:21,306
next to you, you get to
take me off the shelf

1076
00:55:21,341 --> 00:55:24,012
and carry me around
the fucking midway?

1077
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:25,849
No, no!

1078
00:55:27,314 --> 00:55:28,313
Fuck you!

1079
00:55:28,348 --> 00:55:31,558
(soft dramatic music)

1080
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:38,532
(sniffling)

1081
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:41,403
when you look at me, you
think how does she fit

1082
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,504
into my dreams, how does she
jibe with my 10-year plan?

1083
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:44,505
Well you know what?

1084
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:47,937
I am not an afterthought.

1085
00:55:49,545 --> 00:55:51,710
(glass breaking)

1086
00:55:51,745 --> 00:55:55,175
I am not fucking
building blocks.

1087
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,143
- [liam] zoey!

1088
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:58,849
(glass breaking)

1089
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:02,050
(sobbing)

1090
00:56:04,054 --> 00:56:07,528
- I don't wanna be a
part of your dream.

1091
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,402
I wanna build ours together,
can't you fucking see that?

1092
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:16,372
(dramatic music)

1093
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,201
- hey!

1094
00:56:24,107 --> 00:56:26,514
- Relax, man, I'm just
part of the scene.

1095
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,680
- Is that what it was?

1096
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:28,912
You looked a fuck of
a lot like you were

1097
00:56:28,947 --> 00:56:30,551
putting your tongue in
my girlfriend's mouth.

1098
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:31,618
- I was living in the moment.

1099
00:56:31,653 --> 00:56:32,916
- Jesus, merrick,
you can't do that

1100
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:34,522
to someone without
warning them first.

1101
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,117
- You can't just run up on
someone and kiss them like that.

1102
00:56:36,152 --> 00:56:38,658
- Oh, oh, didn't seem to
stop you in rehearsal.

1103
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:41,122
- What's he talking about?

1104
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:43,531
- He didn't tell you about his
first rehearsal with olivia?

1105
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,697
We're doing the
coffee shop scene.

1106
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:46,061
You know, the one where he leans

1107
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:47,535
over the table and kisses her.

1108
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,295
- I know the scene.

1109
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,539
- Well it wasn't in
the original script.

1110
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,771
So the first time
we read it through,

1111
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:54,399
he calls an audible,

1112
00:56:54,434 --> 00:56:56,203
kisses her right in the
middle of the scene.

1113
00:56:56,238 --> 00:56:57,446
- And it was the
best goddamn moment

1114
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,074
in your whole shitty movie.

1115
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:01,241
- Dude, I've had enough of
your disrespect of my work.

1116
00:57:01,276 --> 00:57:02,374
- And I've had enough of
you being in my house.

1117
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:03,584
- Your house?

1118
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:05,245
We all know who
pays for this place.

1119
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,752
- And?

1120
00:57:06,787 --> 00:57:08,589
- Name one thing in your life
that wasn't handed to you.

1121
00:57:08,624 --> 00:57:10,085
- Patience for your bullshit.

1122
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,625
I worked hard for
that, believe you me.

1123
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,090
And it's not like you're some
sort of working-class hero.

1124
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:18,126
You got here because you
won a fucking reality show.

1125
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:20,799
- Look, I worked my ass
off to get to where I am.

1126
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:22,702
- Christ, it must
be hard to sit down.

1127
00:57:25,036 --> 00:57:25,804
- You're scared.

1128
00:57:27,709 --> 00:57:29,302
- Am I?

1129
00:57:29,337 --> 00:57:30,809
- Yeah, you're scared that
someday everyone's gonna

1130
00:57:30,844 --> 00:57:32,910
figure out that you
don't deserve to be here.

1131
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:35,143
- Wow, project much, mr. Mtv?

1132
00:57:35,178 --> 00:57:36,078
- I've already proven myself.

1133
00:57:36,113 --> 00:57:36,914
- And I haven't?

1134
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:38,179
- You tell me.

1135
00:57:38,214 --> 00:57:40,984
- No, I haven't, and
neither have you.

1136
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:41,853
You know why?

1137
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:44,284
Because it's fucking impossible.

1138
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,791
Nobody deserves to be
here, because here,

1139
00:57:45,826 --> 00:57:47,694
fucking hollywood,
doesn't deserve to exist.

1140
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:48,959
- What the hell are
you talking about?

1141
00:57:48,994 --> 00:57:51,698
- This is why I
hate, why I despise

1142
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:53,634
pretentious fucks like you.

1143
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:55,427
You think you're changing
the world or something,

1144
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:57,803
fucking transcending
or some shite.

1145
00:57:57,838 --> 00:57:59,607
When all you're
doing, all we're doing

1146
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,840
is distracting
people for two hours

1147
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,174
of their lives at
a time, that's it!

1148
00:58:06,209 --> 00:58:08,682
That's all this is, merrick!

1149
00:58:08,717 --> 00:58:10,750
We're not curing fucking cancer!

1150
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:13,786
And speaking of where we
should and shouldn't be,

1151
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:15,348
why the fuck are
you in my house?

1152
00:58:15,383 --> 00:58:16,349
- Take a wild guess.

1153
00:58:16,384 --> 00:58:17,284
- Fuck my girlfriend?

1154
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:18,989
- You bet your plaid ass, I am.

1155
00:58:26,702 --> 00:58:27,503
- Ah.

1156
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,571
Floor's all yours, romeo.

1157
00:58:30,871 --> 00:58:33,267
(footsteps)

1158
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,411
(romantic music)

1159
00:58:45,446 --> 00:58:48,689
♪ hey, baby ♪

1160
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:51,120

1161

(sighing)

1162
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:07,708
- so the bouncer
leads me outside,

1163
00:59:08,876 --> 00:59:10,106
I go peacefully.

1164
00:59:10,141 --> 00:59:11,173
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

1165
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:13,043
- Shut the fuck up, liam.

1166
00:59:13,078 --> 00:59:15,782
(romantic music)

1167
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:20,721
I said I'd go peacefully.

1168
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:23,625
Even asked the bouncer
what his name was,

1169
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,923
but he wouldn't tell me.

1170
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:28,058
He was just doing
his job, you know.

1171
00:59:29,259 --> 00:59:30,593
Can't fault him for that.

1172
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:34,900
So I'm outside the bar.

1173
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,806
Friends are inside,
can't get back in.

1174
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:41,643
My head's full of
pot and booze and

1175
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:45,273
it's my fucking birthday.

1176
00:59:45,308 --> 00:59:48,507
(soft romantic music)

1177
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:58,792
I was slamming the stall door
because you weren't there.

1178
01:00:03,832 --> 01:00:04,765
And not just that
you weren't there,

1179
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,097
you had plans, I understood it.

1180
01:00:07,132 --> 01:00:09,869
But even if you had been, I
knew I couldn't have had you.

1181
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:17,646
So I'm outside.

1182
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:20,374
(romantic music)

1183
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:27,315
my friends haven't realized
that I've been kicked out yet.

1184
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,792
(romantic music)

1185
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,730
I go to light a cigarette
and I remembered I have this.

1186
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:43,804
So I get an idea.

1187
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,708
(romantic music)

1188
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:50,745
and I start walking
down to the beach.

1189
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:53,880
You know, I thought,

1190
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,719
what a poetic way to go, right?

1191
01:01:01,054 --> 01:01:03,054
Sitting in the sand
beside the pier.

1192
01:01:04,255 --> 01:01:06,893
Now that I'm 27 I
could join the club.

1193
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,702
So I get about a block.

1194
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,333
My friends find me.

1195
01:01:18,368 --> 01:01:21,039
(romantic music)

1196
01:01:26,244 --> 01:01:28,079
I plastered on a
smile and I went on

1197
01:01:28,114 --> 01:01:30,312
like nothing ever happened.

1198
01:01:30,347 --> 01:01:33,018
(romantic music)

1199
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:38,793
I love you, zoey.

1200
01:01:43,063 --> 01:01:44,733
I have ever seen
you smiled at me

1201
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,999
in line at that coffee shop.

1202
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,936
(romantic music)

1203
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:10,055

But I love liam.

1209
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,014
I always have,
and I always will.

1210
01:02:38,778 --> 01:02:40,987
- He doesn't love you.

1211
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:42,923
- Yes he does.

1212
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,859
- He's fucking olivia st. James.

1213
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,796
Has been this whole time.

1214
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:50,524
(romantic music)

1215
01:02:52,033 --> 01:02:52,801
- I know.

1216
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:57,597
Liam made a mistake.

1217
01:03:01,636 --> 01:03:02,503
I forgive him.

1218
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:08,850
I think we've made
some great progress

1219
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,115
on the script tonight.

1220
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:15,021
Let's get coffee soon
and talk about it, okay?

1221
01:03:16,486 --> 01:03:18,024
I think it's gonna
be your best yet.

1222
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:45,084
Goodnight, merrick.

1223
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:47,086
Get some rest.

1224
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:19,547
(exhaling)

1225
01:04:19,582 --> 01:04:21,384
- zoey, I can explain.

1226
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,496
(sniffling)

1227
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:36,069
- there's nothing to explain.

1228
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,830
It's in the past.

1229
01:04:38,865 --> 01:04:40,073
- No, zoey, that's the thing.

1230
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:42,273
- I'm sorry I threw
those glasses.

1231
01:04:42,308 --> 01:04:43,879
I shouldn't have broken them.

1232
01:04:45,113 --> 01:04:46,376
- I, I don't give a fuck
about the glasses, so what?

1233
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:47,278
- I wasn't acting.

I don't wanna be an afterthought
in your plans, okay?

1237
01:05:02,493 --> 01:05:03,657
It's not your dream.

01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,560
It's not my dream.

1239
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,597
It's our dream.

be a from now on.

listening to me, zoey?

1247
01:05:40,696 --> 01:05:43,169
I don't wanna be
with you anymore.

Baby, I swear this wasn't
supposed to happen.
