1
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:13,304
.

2
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,867
I want you John Bayley.

3
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,571
I want you!

4
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,422
Edward Lanman was sitting in
his pleasant house in London

5
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:46,695
The sun was shining
It was an early morning in June, not quite...

6
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,736
Iris.

7
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,746
Iris, wait for me.

8
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,407
Just keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right.

9
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,649
-You won't keep still.
-I can't keep still.

10
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,353
I can't catch up with you.

11
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:19,198
.

12
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,975
-Iris, you've got bicycle oil on your ankle.
-I don't care, John.

13
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:41,370
Those of you, our guests...

14
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,041
... on whose magnificent generosity
we depend...

15
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,810
...we really are most frightfully grateful...

16
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:49,946
...will need no introduction to
one of our most distinguished graduates...

17
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:54,623
... an honorary fellow, Dame Iris Murdoch.

18
00:03:55,762 --> 00:04:00,131
She's a noted philosopher as well as
author of some twenty-six novels.

19
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:03,258
And we are honoured to have her with us today.

20
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,433
As well as the distinguished
Warton Professor of Literature..

21
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,238
...who has the great good fortune
of being married to her.

22
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,272
I need say no more about her.

23
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:14,904
For good wine needs no bush.

24
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,447
But she will not mind comparison with...

25
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,519
... say, a really fine vintage claret.

26
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:28,953
... Dame Iris will speak to you
about the importance of education.

27
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:46,308
Education doesn't make you happy.
And nor does freedom.

28
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:52,441
We don't become happy
just because we're free -- if we are...

29
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,277
... or because we've been educated, if we have.

30
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,822
But because education may be the means...

31
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,249
... by which we realise we are happy.

32
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:03,693
It opens our eyes, our ears.

33
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,895
Tells us where delights are lurking.

34
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,829
Convinces us that there is only one freedom...

35
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,261
... of any importance whatsoever.

36
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,605
That of the mind.

37
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,305
And gives us the assurance,the confidence...

38
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:23,107
...to walk the path our mind,
our educated mind offers.

39
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:30,681
I shall tell him all my love.

40
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:34,349
All my soul's adoration.

41
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,487
And I think he will hear me.

42
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:42,495
And will not say me nay.

43
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,328
It is this that gives my soul.

44
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:52,341
All it's joyous elation.

45
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:57,208
As I hear the sweet larks sing.

46
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:03,514
In the clear air of the day.

47
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,145
Yes, of course there's something fishy...

48
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:06,751
... about describing people's feelings.

49
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:09,126
Try hard to beaccurate, but...

50
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,763
... as soon as you start to define
such and such a feeling...

51
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:12,786
... language let's you down.

52
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,090
When we really speak the truth,
words are insufficient.

53
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:20,335
Almost everything,
except things like "pass the gravy" ...

54
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:23,604
... is a lie of a sort.
And that being the case, I shall shut up.

55
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:28,237
And pass the gravy.

56
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,341
But love, or at least unsatisfied love...

57
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,047
... is concerned as much with understanding.

58
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:37,951
And real love, extreme love...

59
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,458
... once it's recognised
has stamp of the indubitable...

60
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,551
Ah, John, may I call you, John, may I?

61
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,019
Meet Miss Murdoch.

62
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,419
Iris, my dear, John Bayley.

63
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,562
One of the more promising young lecturers
in the English School.

64
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:51,562
Though I caught him out over
Old English grammar, his weaker side I fear.

65
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,336
A minor question of Anglo-Saxon syntax.

66
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:59,033
Wine!

67
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:02,011
I mean...

68
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:03,541
... It went down the wrong way.

69
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,850
Yes, I like that.

70
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,144
There is a right way down, of course.

71
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,782
Amazing how most of us find it
without even thinking about it.

72
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,720
I rarely think...

73
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,486
If you think about it, you'll never find it.

74
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,828
Best thing to do
is hang on and trust the body. I do.

75
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:20,791
Human beings love each other.

76
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,161
In sex, in friendship...

77
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,462
... and when they're in love.

78
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,071
And they cherish other beings.

79
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,644
Humans, animals, plants - even stones.

80
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:39,414
The quest for happiness
and the promotion of happiness--

81
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,320
--is in all of this
and the power of our imagination.

82
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,922
I'm writing a novel.

83
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:51,455
I don't suppose you have the time
or the inclination to even read a novel.

84
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,925
I've written one. It's going to be published.

85
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,859
And I'm writing another.

86
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:58,834
Can I read it?

87
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:01,764
No-one has read It -- None of my friends.

88
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:04,665
What's it about?

89
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,912
About? It has something for everyone.

90
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,142
A bit like Shakespeare?

91
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:11,171
Perhaps, yes.

92
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,413
Please don't talk to anyone about it.

93
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:17,045
No. Course not.

94
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,112
I won't tell a soul.

95
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,625
Every human soul has seen,
perhaps even before their birth...

96
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:36,541
... pure forms. Such as justice, temperance...

97
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:38,869
... beauty ...

98
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,610
... and all the great moral qualities
which we hold in honour.

99
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:44,606
We are moved towards what is good...

100
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:46,942
... by the faint memory of these forms.

101
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,351
Simple - -and calm and blessed...

102
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:55,386
...which we saw once in a pure clear light...

103
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,890
... being pure ourselves.

104
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,537
'Wholegrain'.
Do we have wholegrain or something other?

105
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,938
What is whole?
Is It something in itself or does it have parts?

106
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:12,266
Oh, spaghetti.

107
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:14,504
If you have a whole you have a whole.

108
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:15,536
Ooh, sausages.

109
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:17,439
You and me is a whole.

110
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,183
If you toddle off there's a hole in the whole.
Or, if I do.

111
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,184
But a whole can't be broken,
it just forms another whole.

112
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:24,411
-Baked beans.
-Baked beans.

113
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,120
Do you want Premium points?

114
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:28,651
Do we deserve them?

115
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:29,817
-Do you want bags?
-Bags, yes.

116
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,859
You know, it's all around us,
people like you and me talking nonsense.

117
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,022
I know, I know.

118
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:36,657
Bag for life:

119
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,637
-For life?
-That's what it says.

120
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,597
We have to ask, give you the choice.

121
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,398
Ooh, rather.

122
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,809
You just have to listen, that's the job.

123
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:49,373
You call it a job but it's like music, what you do.

124
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:53,809
You live with the angels,
speak their language, the music of the spheres.

125
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,849
Nowadays the only language
anyone really understands...

126
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,122
...is pictures. Paint the picture.

127
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:04,296
See, now I'm bagged for life.

128
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:08,096
Love's the only language everyone understands.

129
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,026
Ooh love, yes.

130
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,029
I can read It but I can't speak it.

131
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,314
My coat's caught on your chair.

132
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:36,328
And the captain said
as the two weevils dropped out of the biscuit...

133
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,320
..."which would you rather have, Mr Smith?"

134
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:39,787
"The bigger one, sir."

135
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,630
"Wrong, Mr Smith, wrong."
"In the Navy you should always...

136
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:44,958
...choose the lesser of the two weevils."

137
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:46,560
Patrick O'Brian.

138
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,203
"Between two evils
always choose the one you haven't tried before."

139
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,738
Mea West. Oh my vest!

140
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,710
I tore my vest again this morning.

141
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:54,935
You must get some new vests.

142
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:56,574
Jolly good.

143
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,049
You must get some new vests.

144
00:11:00,186 --> 00:11:01,175
I just said that.

145
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:06,088
You're always saying
that you just said something. Me too.

146
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,221
Good job
you reminded me I had two lectures today.

147
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:10,818
You remembered.

148
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,364
No, but I remembered
to apologise for the one I forgot.

149
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,389
They were very sweet about it.

150
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:17,892
Glad not to have listen to you, I expect.

151
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,293
Oh, I'm sure.

152
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:21,805
They'd have been delighted
to have listened to you.

153
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,102
I always have been.

154
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,444
-Iris!
-John.

155
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:41,349
Than kyou. Keep the change.

156
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,359
-Janet. Janet!
-Oh my God, Iris.

157
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,820
Am I late?

158
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,797
Oh no, it's the hokie-cokie.
Everything will be over.

159
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:56,067
Oh, John, wait. I've got my stocking caught up.

160
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,140
Stupid things. Really.

161
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,218
I'm not sure I'm entirely -- I'm so sorry.

162
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,017
Oh, sorry.

163
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,188
Cha-cha-cha.

164
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:29,463
Cha-cha-cha.

165
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:34,605
-Thank you.
-You too.

166
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,214
That was my husband.

167
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,110
Cha-cha-cha.

168
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:47,648
Are you with Iris?

169
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:49,954
Hoping so.

170
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:52,062
You know we have...

171
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,086
I thought we had.

172
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:54,121
...nearly met.

173
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,364
-Are you a friend of Iris?
-Yes.

174
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,299
She seems to have a lot of f...

175
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:06,610
Janet Stone. John Bayley.

176
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,713
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

177
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:10,781
Shall we?

178
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,939
What are your rooms like?

179
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:13,610
Adequate,thank you.

180
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,978
I'd like to see them.

181
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:21,990
Do you have a lot of friends?

182
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:23,861
Is a list of my friends necessary?

183
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,060
I justwondered if you had many.

184
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,690
There aren't many people
that one wants to know one.

185
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:32,694
Iris!

186
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,068
You might fall.

187
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,409
Would you like some champagne?

188
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:44,838
That would be nice.

189
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,881
I've had some since Christmas...
It does keep, doesn't it?

190
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,928
I shouldn't be doing this.

191
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,297
What?

192
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:03,201
Having women in my room. It's not permitted.

193
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:05,367
I wouldn't say you'd had me exactly.

194
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:11,474
Have you danced before?

195
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,238
It was all right, wasn't it?

196
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:16,541
Oh, I think so.

197
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,109
Broke the ice, so to speak.

198
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:20,374
-"Ice"?
-What?

199
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:23,949
It'll do.

200
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,154
Aren't you particular
about words at your college?

201
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:31,652
I'm only here under sufferance really,
as a tutor and guide.

202
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:34,956
I get all the Americans
and Frenchmen to mother.

203
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,469
You love words, don't you?

204
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,037
If one doesn't have words, how does one think?

205
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,409
Shall I do that?

206
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:50,377
What is your novel about?

207
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,650
About?

208
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:55,375
How to be free.

209
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:57,044
How to be good...

210
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:00,718
...and how to love.

211
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:03,689
Well, that's all there is, I'd say.

212
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:09,826
Language is all very well, you know, but...

213
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,363
...it's not the only way
of understanding each other.

214
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:14,895
There's sight and...

215
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:17,775
...and smell and...touch, of course.

216
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,209
I love your nose.

217
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:27,476
It's snub.

218
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:38,251
Snubby...

219
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:40,162
...snubby, snubby.

220
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:44,527
it's snubby, snubby, snubby.

221
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:07,781
Let me do that to you.

222
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,250
Take off your jacket.

223
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:37,046
If we were, as it were, married...

224
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,651
...we could do this all the time.

225
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:40,380
Perhaps?

226
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,890
We should be doing it nearly all the time.

227
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,754
Yes, but if...

228
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:54,071
Thank you.

229
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,929
Look.

230
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,173
I'm stopping you working.

231
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,981
Yes, well, I don't mind.

232
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:47,525
How's it coming along?

233
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,389
It's harder to write than all the others. Much.

234
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,152
Have you noticed?

235
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,167
Just that you've seemed...
puzzled every now and again.

236
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:58,892
That's it, yes.

237
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:01,898
Puzzled.

238
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:09,678
Puzzled. It's a funny word.

239
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:14,248
All words are like that
when you take them by surprise, aren't they?

240
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,720
Have you got a title?

241
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,722
'A lot of trees...

242
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,021
...seem near.'

243
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,588
We must stop it.

244
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:30,090
What to do?

245
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:34,064
The window, John, the window!
We must stop it.

246
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,062
No. See...

247
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:37,931
...it's gone.

248
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:49,016
We all worry about going mad, don'twe?

249
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,120
How would we know...

250
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,924
...those of us who live in our minds anyway?

251
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,265
Other people would tell us.

252
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:04,624
Would they, John?

253
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,509
I don't want to set the world...

254
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,100
Sorry.

255
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:19,950
...on fire.

256
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:21,852
John Bayley.

257
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,014
Haven't seen her for ages.

258
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:43,326
Jolly good -- nice.

259
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:46,963
Takes all sorts. Not that I ...

260
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,428
...we're all men at St Anthony's.

261
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:52,496
Do you like women?

262
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:55,170
I mean, do women like you?

263
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,201
You mean lesbians?

264
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:58,865
Yes.

265
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:00,739
Would it bother you if they did?

266
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,376
Oh no, the some thing happens with me.
With homosexuals, I mean.

267
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:05,838
And do you go to bed with them?

268
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:07,407
Lord no.

269
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:12,320
At the college... they are all,
as somebody once said to me...

270
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:15,325
..."Old fashioned lesbians of the highest type".

271
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:20,526
And do you go to bed with them?

272
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:01,725
-Dame Iris?
-Yeah.

273
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:04,619
It's this way.

274
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:07,529
She's written philosophy and plays and poetry...

275
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,131
...but her novels are her lasting literay legacy.

276
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,462
Iris Murdoch is acknowledged
as the foremost English novelist...

277
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:16,596
...of her generation.

278
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:19,608
A little excessive, don't you think?

279
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:21,910
What do you reckon, shall I take that again?

280
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,176
Her novels embrace the subjects of freedom...

281
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:29,276
...and what it means to be good.

282
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:33,657
And they're all studies
in the successes and failures of love.

283
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:37,058
She's written philosophy and plays and poetry...

284
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:40,520
...but her novels are her lasting literay legacy.

285
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:43,531
People, ofcourse,
are very secretive and for many reasons...

286
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:47,004
...want to appear what they call 'ordinary'.

287
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,303
Everybody has thoughts they want to conceal.

288
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,470
Perhaps even
quite simple aspects of their lives.

289
00:23:56,714 --> 00:24:00,206
People have obsessions and fears and...

290
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:02,143
...and passions which they don't admit to.

291
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:07,317
I think any character
is interesting and has extremes.

292
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:12,152
it's a novelist's privilege to...

293
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:15,061
...see how odd everyone is.

294
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,190
In your novels you yourself...

295
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:19,593
...were very exacting your use of language...

296
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:23,340
...but in general terms, do you think
the language is becoming debased?

297
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,136
Reading and writing...

298
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:30,106
...and the preservation of language
and its forms...

299
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:32,773
...and...

300
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:38,244
...the kind of eloquence
and beauty that language is capable of...

301
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:42,115
...is something terribly important
to human beings...

302
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,653
...this is connected to thought.

303
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:49,464
If children are not taught...

304
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:03,204
What did you say? Did you ask...?

305
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:05,811
I was asking about the importance of language.

306
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:32,465
John.

307
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:34,944
John. John.

308
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:37,207
Iris?

309
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,043
John.

310
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:44,688
-Oh, you're there. I'm back.
-What is it?

311
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:48,422
-Much earlier than I thought.
-Yes, I came straight  back.

312
00:25:49,327 --> 00:25:50,589
I didn't know why I was there.

313
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,385
You were going to do an interview.

314
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,888
-Well,what interview?
-I don't know.

315
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:56,698
And see your publisher?

316
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,501
-Was it your publisher?
-So I came back.

317
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,733
I didn't expect you back for ages.

318
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:03,698
-Has Norah rung?
-I didn't answer.

319
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:07,106
Iris, Norah's dead.

320
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:10,446
Oh, so she is. Oh,that is sad.

321
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,779
Of, well, nevermind.

322
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:14,073
It must have been Ed.

323
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:15,808
What for?

324
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:20,546
Oh, so I came back.

325
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:25,284
What is...

326
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:27,923
...the name of the Prime Minister?

327
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:37,336
-Are you asking me?
-Yes, I am.

328
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,699
I know.

329
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:44,610
Okay, what is the name of the Prime Minister?

330
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:46,439
I don't know. Ask John. Surely It doesn't matter.

331
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:49,513
Okay. Well, no, not really.

332
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:51,619
Someone will know.

333
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:58,323
Who would you like to see?

334
00:26:59,063 --> 00:27:00,690
-I mean, is there anyone...?
-I don't know.

335
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:03,694
Shall I look up some names, talk to someone?

336
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,400
I've got a lot of ideas,
but they won't come together.

337
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:07,431
It happens all the time, forgetting names.

338
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:12,975
So, does it happens all the time?

339
00:27:13,878 --> 00:27:16,244
Does she mean "writer's block"?
I suppose she does, but...

340
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:18,147
-Iris can always write, Doctor.
-Oh, I know.

341
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:22,443
-Iris is a person of some...
-Yes. But it doesn't work like that...

342
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:26,316
But surely in her case,
a woman with a first-class mind?

343
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:29,660
We'll have to be certain.
There'll have to be tests, scans.

344
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:34,897
Well, I don't think I can...
I mean it's a little beyond my competence.

345
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:38,327
Iris finds her new book very tiring and difficult.

346
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:39,358
Basically, I'll arrange something.

347
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:42,138
Iris has a very clear mind...

348
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,801
...mine's a muddle but not hers.

349
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:47,943
She does everything, always has.
Food, shopping...

350
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:49,001
...tickets for things...

351
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:54,346
I never know how she manages
and does her books as well.

352
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:55,808
Well, they can get your help.

353
00:27:57,321 --> 00:28:02,258
No, nobody would suit. We're odd, you know.

354
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:05,018
There's a very good place,
a specialist nursing home, Vale Hose.

355
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:06,051
-Not necessary.
-Oh, no, not yet.

356
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:08,431
-Not your fault. I'm sorry.
-I'm orry.

357
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,931
Well...take care.

358
00:28:12,403 --> 00:28:14,496
Goodbye, Doctor.
Thank you. Careful. Goodbye.

359
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,364
Iris!

360
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:20,041
I'm sure the country won't go to the dogs.

361
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:23,846
Not knowing the Prime Minister's name
is not a capital offence.

362
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:26,313
-Absolutely.
-I know the names that matter.

363
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:27,940
It'll be all right.

364
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:29,979
Well, it will be if you stop worrying.

365
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:32,478
I've got a book to finish.

366
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,092
...Tony Blair. So there.

367
00:28:43,994 --> 00:28:45,552
Iris, are you comfortable?

368
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm going to start the scan now.
Just keep nice and still.

369
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:53,129
Try to relax.
It'll take about fifteen minutes.

370
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:23,288
John.

371
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:25,928
-Oh Janet.
-I'm sorry.

372
00:29:26,203 --> 00:29:27,295
Is Iris still...? I'm so sorry I'm late.

373
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:29,671
I don't know what's going to happen, Janet.

374
00:29:30,006 --> 00:29:31,997
I've left the car outside - the engine's running.

375
00:29:32,742 --> 00:29:33,800
-...won't be a mo.
-Right.

376
00:29:34,277 --> 00:29:35,266
-See you out there.
-Yes.

377
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:55,331
-John, I'm frightened.
-Everyone's doing their best.

378
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:01,634
Janet's got the car.

379
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:05,599
It will -- be...

380
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,251
-It's done.
-You're finished?

381
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:19,220
I thought you were close.

382
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:22,223
So far it hasn't made any difference.

383
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:24,320
Here's to it.

384
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:26,922
Must try and keep working.

385
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:28,690
-You must.
-I will.

386
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:30,521
And here's to the next one.

387
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:33,265
Just keep working,
keep talking, keep the words coming.

388
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,064
Keep at it.

389
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:37,238
I shall come on
like a deprived animal if I can't write.

390
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:39,335
Be liked a starved dog.

391
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:41,438
No, no, no. I'll keep you at it.

392
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:44,910
I feel...

393
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:49,746
...as if I'm sailing into darkness.

394
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:57,392
Thing you eat with.

395
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:00,385
animal

396
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:04,294
An-im-al.

397
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:09,194
Toothbrush.

398
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,402
...no...

399
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:14,632
Yes.

400
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:20,983
Por...

401
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:24,052
No. See...

402
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:26,377
Portrait

403
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,282
Tennis thing.

404
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:33,654
dog

405
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:35,089
God.

406
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,691
Iris is getting tired, I'm afraid.

407
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:41,230
Can we have the blinds?

408
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:43,835
Dame Iris, thank you very much. Than kyou.

409
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:45,700
Well done, puss.

410
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:47,609
Dame Iris, thank you very much indeed.

411
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:50,677
It's so kind of you to come, Dame Iris.

412
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:52,639
Thank you, I like it. Thank you very much.

413
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,038
Is it any help?

414
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:55,645
Well to us? Yes.

415
00:31:56,252 --> 00:31:58,743
It's implacable.

416
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:01,018
What does that mean?

417
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:03,323
It means inexorable.

418
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,824
I know what the word means -- to me. To us.

419
00:32:08,264 --> 00:32:10,289
You see, words have meant everything to her.

420
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,633
They would still mean something?
Some thought?

421
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:17,700
It can't just be dead birds dropping.

422
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:20,803
I know what it means and,
it doesn't surprise me...

423
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:22,767
... it frightens me, but...

424
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,645
...and then sometimes
it doesn't frighten me and ...

425
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:30,816
...that's just as bad
because that's it winning, isn't it?

426
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:34,889
No, it's not...It won't win.

427
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:38,159
It will win.

428
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:41,028
There. It will win.

429
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,391
That's very kind.

430
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:54,132
Iris.

431
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:55,775
Iris,wait for me.

432
00:32:56,413 --> 00:32:59,075
Just keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right!

433
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,515
You won't keep still!

434
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:03,250
I can' tkeep still!

435
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:05,554
I can't catch up with you!

436
00:33:05,755 --> 00:33:06,744
Speed up!

437
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,094
Oh, good morning.

438
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:24,595
Ah, no...

439
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,708
I think it's the...

440
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:31,640
...person who brings the post, John!

441
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:33,544
-Yes, it is.
-Yes.

442
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:35,984
John! So Sorry.

443
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:37,981
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much indeed.

444
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:40,112
So Sorry.

445
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:47,756
Go on. Go on, go on, go on...

446
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:52,892
It's only the postman.

447
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:55,633
-It's only the postman.
-Don't repeat everything, puss.

448
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:57,430
It's only the postman.

449
00:33:58,241 --> 00:34:00,436
It's for you -- It's your book.

450
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,935
-What's that?
-Your book.

451
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:04,807
It's only the postman.

452
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:07,815
It's your book.

453
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:10,415
-IRIS MURDOCH - JACKSON'S DILEMA
-Isn't it perfectly splendid?

454
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:13,951
Why don't you look at it?

455
00:34:15,158 --> 00:34:16,716
It's only the postman.

456
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:26,491
Oh, damn!

457
00:34:27,337 --> 00:34:31,171
Stop nudging up to me like a water buffalo.

458
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:33,409
I have a lot to do. Lots to do, Iris.

459
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:37,168
See what I've done now?!

460
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:40,406
It's not your fault. Not your fault. Sorry, sorry.

461
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,085
-It's only the postman.
-Yes, all right, it's only the postman.

462
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:46,045
So sorry. There's lots to do.

463
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:10,709
Which side do I go?

464
00:35:26,262 --> 00:35:29,322
Ask me my three
main priorities for Government...

465
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:31,723
...and I tell you...

466
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:34,797
...education, education and education.

467
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:40,098
John. John! Why does he keep saying that?
What does he mean?

468
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:45,008
-By what?
-Education, education, education.

469
00:35:46,716 --> 00:35:50,345
I think he means learning,
everyone getting enough of it.

470
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,678
Why does he keep saying it?

471
00:35:53,222 --> 00:35:56,680
Politicians have to keep repeating things
to make themselves heard.

472
00:35:58,428 --> 00:36:03,593
They have to do anything
to make themselves liked.

473
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:08,499
Why does he want to eat a sheep's ear?

474
00:36:09,606 --> 00:36:10,595
Shall I turn it off?

475
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,629
No!

476
00:36:12,075 --> 00:36:14,669
We could go for a swim tomorrow,
if it's not raining.

477
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:17,144
-No.
-Yes, you love water.

478
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,676
When you swim you love it, swim?
Swim is good for you.

479
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:25,449
When are we leaving?

480
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:27,982
Not today.

481
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:30,383
Are we going to London?

482
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:31,682
No, we're going for a swim.

483
00:36:34,263 --> 00:36:36,197
When are we leaving?

484
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:38,158
Not today.

485
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:41,831
When are we leaving?

486
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:55,775
Iris -- Iris, wait for me.

487
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:09,113
-You dirty old man!
-Hello.

488
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:13,619
There we go. Well done.

489
00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:16,888
No, Iris, not with your socks on, your socks!

490
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:32,531
No, no, give me your hand. Give me your hand.

491
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:34,370
Give me your hand...

492
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:37,609
You'll pull me in. No, no...

493
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,205
You're all right. I won't let you go.

494
00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:43,847
Let me get you dry. You're all right.

495
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:51,418
Where are your socks? Socks? No?

496
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,293
Uppy, uppy hands. Uppy hands. Let's get it on.

497
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:55,021
That's it.

498
00:37:55,898 --> 00:38:00,267
Iris, come on. Just put your hand...

499
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:01,961
...like this. Up hand. Up.

500
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:04,372
-Let's get your head through.
-Let's go now.

501
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,169
No, let's go now.

502
00:38:06,642 --> 00:38:07,802
Iris, as soon as we've got your head in! Iris.

503
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,408
-Let's go now...
-Put your head down.

504
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:11,336
Where's my petticoat?

505
00:38:12,494 --> 00:38:13,483
Here.

506
00:38:20,536 --> 00:38:21,662
Are you sure he's expecting me?

507
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:37,544
Maurice.

508
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,946
I've brought John. You said I might...?

509
00:38:40,155 --> 00:38:42,214
Did I? And did you say you would?

510
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:45,893
Yes. Well...come in.

511
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:48,754
-Maurice Charlton.
-John Bayley.

512
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:57,232
Isn't it hot?

513
00:38:57,573 --> 00:39:00,440
Yes, Itis. I've got just the thing will cool.

514
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:07,077
I imagine your friend
Maurice is hoping to have his wicked will, is he?

515
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,476
Not today, is he?

516
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:21,721
You and I
are much the some age, aren't we, John?

517
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:24,222
I think so.

518
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:26,123
Does it matter?

519
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:27,891
No.

520
00:39:28,237 --> 00:39:29,465
It's not important, is it?

521
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,004
What Maurice means is that most of my real...

522
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:35,443
...my other friends are -- older than me.

523
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:37,534
Much older.

524
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,241
Yes, and there's a
very good reason for that, isn't there?

525
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:44,808
She likes people with a bit of a past.

526
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:47,513
She uses them... Don't you?

527
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:48,812
No I don't.

528
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:50,921
For your novel, don't you Iris?

529
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,225
-I haven't read it
-Haven't you?

530
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:55,492
Neither have you Maurice, so don't play games.

531
00:39:56,131 --> 00:39:57,223
Nobody reads it.

532
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:02,930
The gentle lady hasn't yet
bestowed her favour on anyone.

533
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:05,539
Iris doesn't like to talk about it. Do you Iris?

534
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:09,838
It's because it's full of people she knows.

535
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:12,236
All these masters of thought
you're so chummy with.

536
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:17,083
Bound to be. We all know. Isn't it, Iris?

537
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:20,687
No. You can think what you like,
you know nothing about it.

538
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:22,112
Nobody knows but me.

539
00:40:23,158 --> 00:40:25,388
And -- I'm not telling.

540
00:40:25,694 --> 00:40:27,093
I thought it was as secret?

541
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:29,361
I know Iris doesn't want it talked about.

542
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:31,960
Come on, Iris,
I'm sure we'll all recognise ourselves.

543
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,396
I don't see how you -- anyone can.

544
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:38,035
They won't. They won't.

545
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:40,642
I hate that sort of thing. I won't ever do it.

546
00:40:40,843 --> 00:40:42,003
I don't see the point
of writing a novel that's autobiography.

547
00:40:42,277 --> 00:40:43,266
There's no fun in that.

548
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:45,043
They won't see themselves.

549
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:48,380
Don't people written about in novels
always see themselves differently?

550
00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:50,781
-I'm sure they do, but...
-And who was it who said:

551
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,047
"You can use anyone you like in a novel...

552
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:55,381
...as long as you
drop it in somewhere that they're good in bed...

553
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:57,624
-...even though..."
-...they might not be.

554
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:02,187
Evelyn Waugh.

555
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,227
"And so to bed." Samuel Pepys.

556
00:41:06,168 --> 00:41:07,829
So, have you granted your favour to John?

557
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:10,768
Told him who's in the novel?

558
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,737
We have other things to talk about.

559
00:41:18,814 --> 00:41:20,042
No-one has read my novel.

560
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:22,277
-No-one but the publisher.
-It doesn't matter.

561
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:24,552
Well, it does matter, I feel let down.

562
00:41:25,654 --> 00:41:28,384
Am I not a small part of your life?

563
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:37,994
You were very gallant.

564
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,227
Very stupid.

565
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:41,358
No, John.

566
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:48,365
Will you come in?

567
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,342
Have you been entertained?

568
00:41:56,985 --> 00:41:58,350
Yes.

569
00:42:00,222 --> 00:42:01,280
All these people...

570
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:06,151
...and to think I chose you
for your obvious lack of...

571
00:42:06,628 --> 00:42:07,720
thought that... I thought no competition.

572
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,819
What's this?

573
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:11,427
A friend made it.

574
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:13,300
Is she a cook, your friend?

575
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:16,765
No, he's ap hilosopher. But
his real interests are cooking and telephones.

576
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,436
I'd like you to read this.

577
00:42:23,912 --> 00:42:26,676
I was rather afraid you might not like it.

578
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:31,647
Thank you.

579
00:42:34,456 --> 00:42:35,787
I value your opinion.

580
00:42:42,431 --> 00:42:44,626
Perhaps it's time we made love?

581
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:46,222
Yes?

582
00:42:46,535 --> 00:42:49,095
Yes. That's what I thought.

583
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:52,800
Have you got a French letter?

584
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:56,269
A rubber thingy?

585
00:42:57,379 --> 00:42:58,778
Oh, good Lord, no.

586
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:00,737
Well...

587
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:08,847
...we'll just have to be careful.

588
00:43:32,614 --> 00:43:34,206
I don't exactly...

589
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:37,917
Probably easier if you take your trousers off.

590
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:43,248
Yes, of course. I've never...

591
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,623
I'm a rather late starter.

592
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:48,221
My brother used to have to...

593
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:51,629
...tie my shoelaces for me till I was seven.

594
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,059
-I don't know if...
-I do.

595
00:43:56,738 --> 00:43:58,137
It'll all go...

596
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:02,532
swimmingly.

597
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:04,332
-Help.
-No, no, no.

598
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:08,428
Iris, calm down. No.

599
00:44:09,204 --> 00:44:13,231
No. Help, help.

600
00:44:13,675 --> 00:44:15,404
I am trying to help you.

601
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:57,907
Sorry.

602
00:44:58,286 --> 00:45:00,686
Please don't, Iris.

603
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:07,792
You have nothing to be sorry about.

604
00:45:10,031 --> 00:45:12,556
It'd be unfair and I couldn't bear it.

605
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:18,532
We should be saying sorry to you.

606
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:24,002
And not just sorry, but...

607
00:45:29,217 --> 00:45:34,314
Shall I read to you? Shall I?

608
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:45,198
Occupied in observing
Mr Bingley's attentions to her sister...

609
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:47,295
Elizabeth was far from suspecting...

610
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:51,330
...that she was herself
becoming an object of some interest...

611
00:45:52,106 --> 00:45:53,596
...in the eyes of his friend.

612
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,642
Mr Darcy had, at first,
scarcely allowed her to be pretty...

613
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:02,144
I wrote.

614
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:07,387
Yes, my darling clever cat.

615
00:46:08,456 --> 00:46:09,787
You wrote books.

616
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,991
Books. I wrote.

617
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,893
You wrote novels.

618
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:17,896
Wonderful novels.

619
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,529
I wrote.

620
00:46:23,638 --> 00:46:25,265
Such things you wrote.

621
00:46:27,108 --> 00:46:28,700
Special things...

622
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:30,976
...secret things.

623
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:43,719
Do you know many secrets now, Iris?

624
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,028
You have shown me a map of Iris'...

625
00:46:48,663 --> 00:46:50,631
...brain world. Empty...

626
00:46:51,699 --> 00:46:54,065
You tell me that its hidden mysteries and ...

627
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,828
...and all the unknown life
in there has gone, has been wiped.

628
00:47:00,074 --> 00:47:01,473
How then...

629
00:47:01,976 --> 00:47:05,343
How can she say things
with such a terrible lucidity?

630
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:09,242
Which bit of the empty jungle
does that come from?

631
00:47:10,718 --> 00:47:13,585
-We don't know.
-Not we. You don't know.

632
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:16,622
Don't hide, please.

633
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:21,586
Is it not remotely possible...

634
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,862
...that what Iris says
is of some consequence, yes?

635
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:29,100
yes, perhaps.

636
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,804
So, perhaps we ought to learn her language...

637
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:36,438
...before the lights go out.

638
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:39,470
The lights -- will go out.

639
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:40,870
Yes, of course they will.

640
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,639
You all keep telling me, us, that.

641
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:44,784
I know that. She may even know that herself.

642
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,210
Iris.

643
00:47:52,226 --> 00:47:54,922
I'm sure you can write it.
Just get one word down.

644
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:56,552
Persevere.

645
00:47:57,598 --> 00:47:58,997
Iris, your notebook!

646
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:15,943
No, Iris. No, no. Come, come.

647
00:48:18,953 --> 00:48:19,942
That's it.

648
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:27,520
we'll walk -- we'll read...

649
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:34,962
...and then you'll write. Be just like the old days.

650
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:43,905
It's Iris, mama.

651
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:49,238
Look who's here, Iris.

652
00:48:49,684 --> 00:48:52,346
Hello. Hello.

653
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:05,662
Yes, Iris, sea.

654
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:08,131
I thought we'd walk, calm her down a bit.

655
00:49:08,503 --> 00:49:10,494
She has an idea for a novel.

656
00:49:10,972 --> 00:49:12,405
-Hello, Iris.
-Hello, Iris.

657
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,031
Talk to her, Janet.

658
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,438
Hello, Iris. The sea's a bit cold for swimming.

659
00:49:20,982 --> 00:49:22,847
Stay as long as you like, there's plenty of room.

660
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:25,876
-We don't want to be nuisance...
-Oh, no you're not!

661
00:49:26,287 --> 00:49:27,811
It's as much for mum as anyone,
give her a bit of a rest.

662
00:49:28,623 --> 00:49:31,649
Can't rush around these days,
John, tummy trouble.

663
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:35,825
-Is she ill?
-She gets tired easily.

664
00:49:36,764 --> 00:49:38,061
She's really not...

665
00:49:42,537 --> 00:49:43,526
What do we do?

666
00:49:43,604 --> 00:49:44,593
Just talk to her.

667
00:49:44,906 --> 00:49:47,033
Say things to her
that she can write. She can you know.

668
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:15,584
It's all right, is it, John?

669
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:20,200
It'll get better
as you get to know each other better.

670
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:27,806
Iris has got more than one world
going on inside her head...

671
00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:29,940
...a secret world.

672
00:51:31,112 --> 00:51:32,477
Until another book comes out.

673
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:36,043
I'm only friend that knows of her secret world.

674
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:37,779
Oh, John.

675
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:39,314
No, no, it's like living in a fairy story.

676
00:51:40,488 --> 00:51:42,581
I'm the young man in love
with a beautiful maiden...

677
00:51:43,157 --> 00:51:45,990
...who disappears into an unknown
and mysterious world...

678
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,158
...but who always comes back.

679
00:51:58,372 --> 00:51:59,862
Iris!

680
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:01,972
Look.

681
00:52:02,276 --> 00:52:05,370
Iris, look, he's got his clothes on.

682
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:07,136
He's got his clothes on!

683
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:12,984
He's got his clothes on. He's got his clothes on.

684
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:15,853
Seems very sensible to me.

685
00:53:03,404 --> 00:53:05,167
-Janet, are you all right?
-I'm absolutely fine, John.

686
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:08,307
I thought I'd get her to sign this.

687
00:53:10,077 --> 00:53:13,376
Anything is fine. Just get her to write.

688
00:53:14,982 --> 00:53:16,574
Does she know anything about her past?

689
00:53:18,052 --> 00:53:19,576
Her career, work, friends?

690
00:53:20,688 --> 00:53:23,122
Something of a closed book.

691
00:53:25,025 --> 00:53:27,391
But it's there -- I know it.

692
00:53:46,547 --> 00:53:48,276
Oh, that's wonderful. Well done, puss.

693
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:53,250
Good to see your book so well received, Iris.

694
00:53:53,854 --> 00:53:55,014
Yes, wasn't it?

695
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:56,983
You thought you'd never finish it, didn't you?

696
00:53:57,825 --> 00:53:58,883
I read her the reviews.

697
00:53:59,693 --> 00:54:03,390
You hated me doing it before.

698
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:05,559
Would you sign your new book for me, Iris?

699
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:09,793
Like postcards, do it at once or you don't.

700
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,194
Please?

701
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:49,641
I see an angel.

702
00:54:51,178 --> 00:54:52,475
I think it's you.

703
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:03,881
We're undewater now.

704
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,228
There are some drugs, aren't there, Iris?

705
00:55:09,263 --> 00:55:10,355
But they don't last long.

706
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:13,827
And when the friendly fog disperses...

707
00:55:15,068 --> 00:55:18,037
...there yawns
the precipice before you, doesn't it, puss?

708
00:55:21,842 --> 00:55:22,866
They're beautiful.

709
00:55:24,845 --> 00:55:26,506
Horrible, isn't it, puss?

710
00:55:27,247 --> 00:55:30,546
Horrible thing...

711
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:33,375
...when you're there
with your toes at the edge of the precipice.

712
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:38,014
You can say anything you like as...

713
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,584
...long as you make it sound like it's a joke.

714
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,849
Oh, don't John, that's cruel.

715
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:42,521
that's where you're wrong.

716
00:55:42,696 --> 00:55:43,856
It's not cruel, it's nothing...

717
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:45,189
...because it's not understood.

718
00:55:45,399 --> 00:55:47,026
She's in her own world now.

719
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:51,162
Which is perhaps what she's always wanted.

720
00:56:01,181 --> 00:56:03,945
Come on. Let's go in.

721
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,019
When do we go?

722
00:57:21,728 --> 00:57:22,786
Chin up, John.

723
00:57:28,802 --> 00:57:29,791
Janet.

724
00:57:30,137 --> 00:57:31,365
Yes, puss. Yes.

725
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:54,352
Going, going. No, I do go.

726
00:57:55,729 --> 00:57:58,163
Soon, we'll -- we'll go soon.

727
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,828
Now... now.

728
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,307
Who is it? Who is it?

729
00:58:10,277 --> 00:58:12,142
Hello, hello.

730
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:13,944
Are you there?

731
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:16,271
Where this?

732
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,652
...soars enchanted...

733
00:58:28,528 --> 00:58:31,429
As I hear the sweet lark sing

734
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:34,055
In the clear air of the day.

735
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,097
How much is that doggy in the window?

736
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:40,599
The one with the waggly tail

737
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:45,072
How much is that doggy in the window?

738
00:58:45,745 --> 00:58:53,151
I do hope that doggy's for sale.

739
00:58:58,225 --> 00:58:59,214
Sing your mother's song.

740
00:59:01,228 --> 00:59:02,490
Sing your mother's song.

741
00:59:04,331 --> 00:59:07,027
All my soul's adoration.

742
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:11,537
And I think he will hear me.

743
00:59:12,606 --> 00:59:16,303
...soars enchanted

744
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:23,614
I hear the sweet lark sing...

745
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:27,552
...of the day.

746
00:59:29,189 --> 00:59:32,352
It is this that gives my soul.

747
00:59:33,226 --> 00:59:36,957
All its joyous elation

748
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:42,031
As I hear the sweet lark sing

749
00:59:42,669 --> 00:59:45,433
In the clear air...

750
00:59:46,072 --> 00:59:48,165
...of the day.

751
00:59:49,643 --> 00:59:53,773
Dear thoughts are in my mind

752
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:59,714
And my soul soars enchanted.

753
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,282
As I hear the sweet lark sing

754
01:00:05,992 --> 01:00:10,759
In the clear air of the day.

755
01:00:12,132 --> 01:00:15,966
For a tender beaming smile...

756
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:20,802
...to my hope has been granted

757
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:27,137
And tomorrow he shall hear...

758
01:00:28,348 --> 01:00:34,309
...all my fond heart can say

759
01:00:34,988 --> 01:00:39,015
As I hear the sweet lark sing...

760
01:00:39,459 --> 01:00:42,053
...in the...

761
01:01:01,748 --> 01:01:03,306
Come, gentlemen...

762
01:01:03,683 --> 01:01:06,049
...we shall have to do better than this.

763
01:01:18,965 --> 01:01:20,956
aren't you a bad cat?

764
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:32,070
And tomorrow he shall hear...

765
01:01:32,412 --> 01:01:37,372
...all my fond heart can say

766
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:39,079
Teletubbies!

767
01:01:44,524 --> 01:01:45,513
Morning.

768
01:01:45,859 --> 01:01:47,292
Morning. Oh thank you.

769
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:51,162
-Okay. Bye.
-Than kyou. Bye.

770
01:01:53,066 --> 01:01:54,260
It's only the postman.

771
01:01:59,506 --> 01:02:00,598
Time for teletubbies -- Time for Teletubbies.

772
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:01,796
Tinky winky Tinky Winky

773
01:02:02,108 --> 01:02:06,374
It's only the postman.

774
01:02:08,348 --> 01:02:09,337
It'sonlythepostman.

775
01:02:12,118 --> 01:02:13,642
It's only the postman.

776
01:02:16,556 --> 01:02:18,114
It's only the postman.

777
01:02:47,887 --> 01:02:49,718
Where have the Teletubbies gone?

778
01:03:04,704 --> 01:03:05,762
remember Proteus?

779
01:03:06,139 --> 01:03:08,164
-What about Proteus?
-I'm like Proteus.

780
01:03:08,508 --> 01:03:11,033
You've got to keep hold of me
the way Hercules kept hold of him.

781
01:03:11,745 --> 01:03:12,871
Even thought he changed into...

782
01:03:13,213 --> 01:03:14,942
... a lion and a fish...

783
01:03:15,215 --> 01:03:16,204
...and a snake.

784
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:02,457
I'm worried about the river, we swim.

785
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:07,088
You never know, sir.

786
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,791
I have, of course,
looked everywhere here already.

787
01:04:58,051 --> 01:04:59,575
Everything you do...

788
01:05:00,453 --> 01:05:03,013
...everything you say, write...

789
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:06,550
...you do it superbly.

790
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,990
And you're always going to, all your life...

791
01:05:10,263 --> 01:05:11,992
...whatever you turn your hand to. I know it.

792
01:05:15,468 --> 01:05:18,801
And I know you must feel
that I don't belong in your world.

793
01:05:19,973 --> 01:05:22,908
I don't.

794
01:06:22,902 --> 01:06:24,164
Between the soup and the baked beans.

795
01:06:24,904 --> 01:06:26,428
Thank you so much.

796
01:06:26,906 --> 01:06:28,897
I caught her before she got to the check-out.

797
01:06:29,409 --> 01:06:31,206
She's been gone for hours...

798
01:06:31,411 --> 01:06:32,537
..I thought I'd never see her again. Never.

799
01:06:34,213 --> 01:06:35,578
Well... all's well that...

800
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:37,814
Please do, tell me your name?

801
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,153
I'm Maurice, John.

802
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,716
Iris' friend.

803
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:48,724
I was a witness at your wedding.

804
01:06:51,364 --> 01:06:52,888
Well, I'm late for a meeting.

805
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,057
-Maurice, so sorry...
-So sorry.

806
01:07:29,202 --> 01:07:31,727
Were you trying to get away from me?

807
01:07:33,573 --> 01:07:36,474
Did you want to leave me, Iris?

808
01:07:38,978 --> 01:07:40,639
Please?

809
01:07:55,874 --> 01:07:58,809
I feel as if I don't know anything about you.

810
01:07:59,144 --> 01:08:00,406
When you know
everything about me, then I'll be dead.

811
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,677
He's a Professor of Ancient History..

812
01:08:03,115 --> 01:08:04,946
They have a maling influence on you I think.

813
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:06,411
They all have, all your 'friends'.

814
01:08:06,785 --> 01:08:08,844
He's a teacher, a master of thought.

815
01:08:09,455 --> 01:08:11,616
You talk, do you. You master thoughts together?

816
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:14,384
We make love, yes,
but that's not the important thing.

817
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,059
Then he goes home to his wife in London.

818
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:17,818
Does it frighten you?

819
01:08:18,363 --> 01:08:21,764
I feel as if I'm standing in a long line of suitors...

820
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:23,127
...waiting for a kind word.

821
01:08:24,036 --> 01:08:25,060
I'll always give you a kind word.

822
01:08:26,138 --> 01:08:27,628
We must accept me as I am.

823
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:30,568
And I'm to be kept in my box or not kept at all.

824
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:33,807
Nothing matters except...

825
01:08:35,013 --> 01:08:36,344
...loving what is good.

826
01:08:36,782 --> 01:08:37,771
Am I good?

827
01:08:40,252 --> 01:08:42,117
Just...

828
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:45,117
...keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right.

829
01:08:51,563 --> 01:08:54,031
Who are you with now, Iris?

830
01:08:54,066 --> 01:08:55,055
Who is it?

831
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:04,034
We're lost.

832
01:09:05,377 --> 01:09:07,572
We're lost. We're lost...

833
01:09:17,589 --> 01:09:18,920
There is no reason for this.

834
01:09:19,224 --> 01:09:20,851
And if there is I don't know it.

835
01:09:21,794 --> 01:09:25,127
I hate you Iris. You stupid cow.

836
01:09:25,531 --> 01:09:26,964
I bloody loathe you.

837
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:29,393
Every bloody inch of you.

838
01:09:29,902 --> 01:09:32,598
All your friends have finished with you.

839
01:09:33,005 --> 01:09:35,803
Nobody else has you anymore...

840
01:09:36,308 --> 01:09:40,972
...except your fucking best friend
Doctor fucking Alzheimer....

841
01:09:41,346 --> 01:09:43,974
...with all his fucking gifts.

842
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:47,543
I've got you now and I don't want you.

843
01:09:48,854 --> 01:09:51,118
I've never known anything about you at all...

844
01:09:51,423 --> 01:09:52,890
...and now I don't care.

845
01:10:02,601 --> 01:10:03,693
I think it's time I told you about...

846
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:04,825
...some of my friends...

847
01:10:05,904 --> 01:10:08,395
...the people in my past -- of my heart and...

848
01:10:09,241 --> 01:10:10,230
...and not.

849
01:10:12,778 --> 01:10:13,767
Oh dear.

850
01:10:21,253 --> 01:10:22,686
ought I to take notes?

851
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:32,429
There was a friend who was a student with me.

852
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,258
No, no, he can wait.

853
01:10:38,904 --> 01:10:40,895
He was not the first person I went to bed with...

854
01:10:41,773 --> 01:10:42,967
...that was Harry..

855
01:10:44,343 --> 01:10:46,971
then there was Roger,
who wanted to marry me...

856
01:10:47,779 --> 01:10:50,339
And Oscar
who said he couldn't live without me...

857
01:10:51,683 --> 01:10:53,150
...and Tom...

858
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:58,986
...who far too clearly could but...

859
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:02,260
So, the student friend
I had resisted going to bed with...

860
01:11:04,129 --> 01:11:05,528
...joined the Army during the war....

861
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:06,991
...and promptly asked me to marry him for...

862
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,427
...he was certain he was going to be killed...

863
01:11:10,736 --> 01:11:12,101
..and wanted me to have the window's pension.

864
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:15,301
Yes, I know they all said that.

865
01:11:16,975 --> 01:11:17,964
Anyway...

866
01:11:19,912 --> 01:11:21,311
...I didn't want to marry him...

867
01:11:23,315 --> 01:11:25,078
...but I did go to bed with him.

868
01:11:25,717 --> 01:11:29,949
...I thought that best before
he went off to fight, because you never know...

869
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,089
...anyway, he, he was killed--

870
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:39,262
--my student friend...

871
01:11:41,099 --> 01:11:42,498
...and we weren't married.

872
01:11:45,203 --> 01:11:46,465
So no pension.

873
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,769
there.

874
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:57,073
It wouldn't have been much anyway...

875
01:11:57,282 --> 01:11:58,681
I know, because I had friends killed.

876
01:11:59,017 --> 01:12:01,247
Their wives got very little, they get very little.

877
01:12:06,024 --> 01:12:08,356
Is that all? I mean, roughly?

878
01:12:10,662 --> 01:12:12,892
What about the 'friends' in your other world?

879
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:15,666
You know more about me than anyone on earth.

880
01:12:20,005 --> 01:12:21,233
You are my world.

881
01:12:43,695 --> 01:12:44,684
Thank you.

882
01:12:46,465 --> 01:12:48,626
After all that I rather hoped it might be time...

883
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:50,229
...for me to get my kind word.

884
01:12:56,942 --> 01:12:59,410
You don't need to do it on your own.
Vale House is very good.

885
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:01,744
You're exhausted, you know that.

886
01:13:02,147 --> 01:13:04,081
Of course I am. It's something that we share.

887
01:13:04,483 --> 01:13:06,713
We're in a state of grace.

888
01:13:07,285 --> 01:13:08,946
I think we understand each other.

889
01:13:10,022 --> 01:13:11,046
What do you think?

890
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:16,390
I don'tknow. There's always help if you need it.

891
01:13:17,562 --> 01:13:20,258
There isn't any help for her.

892
01:13:23,702 --> 01:13:24,691
What?

893
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:27,461
Sorry? Sorry?

894
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,234
Nothing.

895
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:39,572
Why has Willie Thorne
got two rabbits tattooed on his bald head?

896
01:13:40,419 --> 01:13:42,910
I don't know, why has Willie Thorne
got two rabbits tattooed on his bald head?

897
01:13:43,488 --> 01:13:45,820
Cos from a distance they look like hares.

898
01:13:50,362 --> 01:13:51,556
Janet's dead, Iris.

899
01:13:56,568 --> 01:13:59,002
They want me to say a few words
but I can't think of any.

900
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:01,937
Janet's dead, Iris.

901
01:14:12,684 --> 01:14:16,245
I miss Janet very much.

902
01:14:17,389 --> 01:14:21,792
I miss Janet because I used to store up...

903
01:14:22,227 --> 01:14:24,252
...funny things to tell her that happened to us.

904
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:28,131
...things I can no longer tell Iris.

905
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:31,996
Another friend visited us...

906
01:14:32,304 --> 01:14:33,464
...in Oxford overnight recently....

907
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,469
...and I found her cleaning the bath.

908
01:14:37,742 --> 01:14:39,835
I said, "Oh, please, there's no need".

909
01:14:40,812 --> 01:14:42,905
She said, "Oh yes there is,
I want to take a bath".

910
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:49,486
I was hoping to be able...

911
01:14:50,689 --> 01:14:52,054
...to tell Janet that story...

912
01:14:52,757 --> 01:14:54,782
...she would have enjoyed it.

913
01:14:55,827 --> 01:14:57,886
She would have...laughed.

914
01:15:00,499 --> 01:15:01,557
I mean, I think...

915
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:10,233
...Anna Karenina, Tolstoy, you know...

916
01:15:10,509 --> 01:15:14,275
...when on her way to the station
to throw herself under a train...

917
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,740
...sees something funny
which she thinks to tell Vronsky....

918
01:15:18,216 --> 01:15:19,205
...her lover, about...

919
01:15:19,784 --> 01:15:21,684
...we all do it, I do it with Iris...

920
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,078
...and Janet, all our friends...

921
01:15:24,489 --> 01:15:29,483
...but, then Anna thought that
she wouldn't be seeing Vronsky again...

922
01:15:30,095 --> 01:15:32,325
...because she was about to kill herself.

923
01:15:36,835 --> 01:15:37,893
Oh, but, you don't want to hear this...

924
01:15:41,006 --> 01:15:43,304
...Janet didn't kill herself...

925
01:15:47,646 --> 01:15:52,015
But, if there's one thing
that would have prevented...

926
01:15:53,018 --> 01:15:55,919
...Anna from throwing herself under a train...

927
01:15:56,755 --> 01:16:01,692
...that would be it,
the thought of telling something funny...

928
01:16:03,361 --> 01:16:05,352
...to the man she loves.

929
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:11,263
The love is over...

930
01:16:15,507 --> 01:16:18,874
...though...

931
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:22,840
...life will...

932
01:16:24,282 --> 01:16:25,874
...soon be over.

933
01:16:28,286 --> 01:16:29,275
That's all.

934
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:33,248
Goodbye, Janet.

935
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:35,817
No, no, Janet. Jan!

936
01:16:36,528 --> 01:16:38,257
It's all right, Iris.

937
01:16:50,008 --> 01:16:50,997
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

938
01:16:51,243 --> 01:16:52,540
-Wrong driving.
Stop it, Iris!

939
01:16:52,911 --> 01:16:53,900
Wrong driving!

940
01:16:54,045 --> 01:16:55,034
No. Stop it, Iris.

941
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:59,339
-Not house. Not mother..
-Iris, it's very dangerous.

942
01:16:59,618 --> 01:17:03,281
Them! Them!

943
01:17:06,024 --> 01:17:07,048
Iris!

944
01:17:13,865 --> 01:17:14,854
Puss.

945
01:17:17,102 --> 01:17:19,832
My old mouse -- My old cat mouse.

946
01:17:20,438 --> 01:17:21,427
Where are you?

947
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:51,501
I...

948
01:17:54,472 --> 01:17:56,269
...love...

949
01:17:58,209 --> 01:17:59,335
...you.

950
01:18:01,379 --> 01:18:07,340
Ah, little mouse. I know you do.

951
01:18:22,734 --> 01:18:24,065
I used to be...

952
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:27,563
...so afraid of being alone with you...

953
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:30,035
...now I can't be without you.

954
01:18:39,851 --> 01:18:41,910
Let's get us -- home...

955
01:18:43,188 --> 01:18:45,486
...and then there'll be tomorrow...

956
01:18:47,292 --> 01:18:48,987
...and the nex tday...

957
01:18:50,295 --> 01:18:51,387
...and the next...

958
01:18:52,163 --> 01:18:53,494
...and on we go...

959
01:18:55,834 --> 01:19:00,100
...getting closer and closest together...

960
01:19:02,741 --> 01:19:03,730
Oh, your ring.

961
01:19:05,043 --> 01:19:06,476
It's so worn now.

962
01:19:06,811 --> 01:19:07,800
Where did you get it?

963
01:19:08,012 --> 01:19:09,001
From a pawnbrokers.

964
01:19:10,682 --> 01:19:12,047
I like things that are worn down.

965
01:19:14,085 --> 01:19:16,349
Which wear and wear and wear...

966
01:19:19,457 --> 01:19:20,754
...until they go.

967
01:19:38,777 --> 01:19:39,869
We've had a bit of luck.

968
01:19:40,812 --> 01:19:42,905
Usual thing, I'm afraid -- Somebody's died.

969
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:46,406
Iris...

970
01:19:47,218 --> 01:19:50,187
...don't you have a smile for Doctor Gudgeon?

971
01:19:51,356 --> 01:19:52,345
No?

972
01:19:55,794 --> 01:19:56,783
No.

973
01:19:57,395 --> 01:19:59,920
So -- the time has come.

974
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:04,300
You know it would, Professor Bayley.

975
01:20:05,136 --> 01:20:06,125
Yes.

976
01:20:07,038 --> 01:20:09,666
She didn't have a smile for you today.

977
01:20:10,341 --> 01:20:13,538
Yes. Well, we must make a start.

978
01:20:15,046 --> 01:20:16,877
-What do I do?
-Nothing any more.

979
01:20:20,585 --> 01:20:22,553
Vale House is a very friendly place, you know.

980
01:20:24,122 --> 01:20:25,384
I was, surpr....

981
01:20:27,225 --> 01:20:28,590
...I mean, this is one of the best.

982
01:20:31,329 --> 01:20:34,560
More difficult to get into than...well, Eton.

983
01:21:15,707 --> 01:21:17,800
-Taxi for Vale House?
-Yes.

984
01:21:19,511 --> 01:21:21,536
Lady's on the stairs, but I can't get her down.

985
01:21:23,281 --> 01:21:24,270
Shall I?

986
01:21:30,788 --> 01:21:33,348
You all right, my love?

987
01:21:35,593 --> 01:21:36,958
We're going for a little drive.

988
01:21:39,531 --> 01:21:40,520
What's your name then?

989
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:46,559
Iris.

990
01:21:48,907 --> 01:21:50,704
Yes, it's Iris.

991
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,034
All right then, Iris...

992
01:21:54,078 --> 01:21:55,636
...you'll be all right, my love, come on.

993
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:56,669
Come on, upsy-daisy.

994
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:04,410
There you go.

995
01:22:05,123 --> 01:22:06,988
Lovely.

996
01:22:33,952 --> 01:22:35,510
Human beings love each...

997
01:22:36,287 --> 01:22:38,221
...in sex -- in friendship...

998
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,853
...and when they're in love.

999
01:22:42,226 --> 01:22:43,955
And they cherish other beings...

1000
01:22:44,729 --> 01:22:47,755
...humans -- animals, plants...

1001
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:50,761
...even stones.

1002
01:22:51,502 --> 01:22:53,561
She'll be fine now, won't you Iris?

1003
01:22:56,207 --> 01:22:57,936
You can visit any time you like...

1004
01:22:58,309 --> 01:22:59,674
...come all day if you want to.

1005
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:06,577
Stay the night, that's all right...

1006
01:23:07,185 --> 01:23:09,346
...we can make arrangements
for you to do that anytime.

1007
01:24:05,276 --> 01:24:07,176
It was so quiet...

1008
01:24:10,348 --> 01:24:11,474
...when she died.

1009
01:24:14,252 --> 01:24:18,052
Do you know,
I thought I wouldn't mind doing that myself..

1010
01:24:20,758 --> 01:24:24,023
I had a joke to tell her.

1011
01:24:26,597 --> 01:24:30,658
It wasn't a very good one
but she'd have laughed.

1012
01:24:32,136 --> 01:24:33,865
We need to believe in something divine.

1013
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:35,901
Without the need for God.

1014
01:24:37,442 --> 01:24:40,036
Something we might call love...

1015
01:24:40,545 --> 01:24:41,534
...or goodness.

1016
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,106
As the psalm says...

1017
01:24:45,383 --> 01:24:47,146
..."Whither shall I go from thy spirit...

1018
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:49,848
...whither shall I flee from thy presence?

1019
01:24:51,589 --> 01:24:53,648
If I ascend unto Heaven thou art there...

1020
01:24:54,692 --> 01:24:57,422
...if I make my bed in Hell behold thou art there.

1021
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,722
If I take the wings of the morning...

1022
01:25:01,165 --> 01:25:02,894
...and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea...

1023
01:25:04,435 --> 01:25:06,494
...even there shall thy hand lead me...

1024
01:25:07,605 --> 01:25:09,573
...and thy right hand shall hold me."
