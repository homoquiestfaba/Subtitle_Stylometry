1
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,354
Ineffable loss, my friend.

2
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:59,692
A tremendous abduction
from your world.

3
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:06,165
She's so beautiful.

4
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:13,472
I can't do it, I...

5
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,840
can't, I can't do it.

6
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:19,544
I understand
your pain, Joseph.

7
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,314
With that said, I wonder...

8
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:24,751
is there a little more
to speak of?

9
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,795
She must have been
extraordinary.

10
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:41,134
I-I don't have e-enough...

11
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,168
air in my lungs...

12
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:47,205
to describe her goodness.

13
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,146
Incredible.

14
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,390
Joseph...

15
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:07,894
as you depicted,
you seemed quite angry

16
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,330
when it all happened.

17
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,866
Might I ask...

18
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:16,269
did you in fact stop taking

19
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,436
your medicine
before her death?

20
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,906
No.

21
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:25,644
Yeah.

22
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,312
I did. I don't, I...

23
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:33,218
I don't remember,
I don't rightly remember.

24
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:39,925
I'm not takin' my medicine
now though. I know that.

25
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,229
Yes. That would explain me.

26
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:47,366
I can help you remember
everything if you'd like.

27
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,867
Not just Annabel.

28
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:53,673
I don't know if I hurt her...

29
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,841
or not.

30
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:58,210
I can answer
all your questions, Joseph.

31
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:02,647
One cold plunge,
a small vow of courage.

32
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,850
Are you certain
you won't join me?

33
00:03:58,553 --> 00:04:03,369

34
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:08,018

35
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:35,567
Hi, there.

36
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,142
What the hell was that?

37
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:45,610
There's a murder.

38
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:47,012
Excuse me?

39
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,115
A murder of crows.

40
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,519
Good luck, darling.

41
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,921
It okay, Melanie. He's with me.
Thanks, Ms. Brenner.

42
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:58,790
Gosh! That was some sign.
Are you okay, man?

43
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,658
What a welcome! Christ sake.

44
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,997
I'm sorry, Mr. Hale...

45
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,901
I'm sorry, Mr. Hale, that was
probably the wildest thing

46
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:13,038
I've ever seen.

47
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,707
He thought your head
was a freakin' nest.

48
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,376
Come on.
I'll show you the place.

49
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,646
What, what's that smell?
Are you drinking?

50
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,781
Just a little curry.
It helps me concentrate.

51
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:25,016
Well, it's a bit narrow
for two, should you lead?

52
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,951
No, I'm good if you're okay.

53
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,788
-Okay.
-Hey!

54
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,856
It's very exciting that
you're here to cover the birds.

55
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,725
People of Bodega, they take
great pride in this production.

56
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,028
It's not everyday the penman
strolls into town?

57
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,631
Well...

58
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:40,132
-How did you hear about that?
-Come on.

59
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:41,534
A guy writes a similar article

60
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,067
on human trafficking at 19

61
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,569
wins the Chancellor Award for it

62
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:45,805
goes on to win a dozen more.

63
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,072
Junior Olympic sharpshooter?

64
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:48,908
It's a big deal
to people, Mr. Hale.

65
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,043
Well, I'm honored,
Mitch, that you recognize that.

66
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:54,213
-What do you do?
-Crab fishing in the winter.

67
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:57,015
If I get antsy, I'll hop
a sailing a boat in June.

68
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,550
Home sweet home.

69
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,519
Straight through there,
that's you.

70
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,898
I'm grateful. This is...

71
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,165
Love...

72
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,935
Mitch, what are these?

73
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,237
Yeah, that's a harpoon.
That's a flensing knife.

74
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,104
And this guy here,
that's a-that's a

75
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:22,040
hand lance there for whaling.

76
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,576
-Yeah, they're a pass down.
-Intense.

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,192
Right. Right.

-Thank you. There you go!

You got it.
Welcome to chateau Captree.

88
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:50,802

I'll, I'll be right down.

-Hey.

92
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:10,256
Well, here is the reason I came.

93
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:12,024
It's so good to see you.

94
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,926
-It's good to see you.
-What have you been up to?

95
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,226
I'm showing this guy
around town. This is...

96
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,762
-Ed, this is...
-Hi.

97
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,697
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

98
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,932
-Where you guys at?
-Okay, we are in the back.

99
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,300
So will you boys
grab some drinks...

100
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,769
-You got it.
-We all drink.

101
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,004
-Yes, we do.
-Alright.

102
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,538
Alright, I'll see you in a few.

103
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,206
-Tom!
-Hey!

104
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,775
What's goin' on?
Glad to see you, man.

105
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:31,142
This is Ed Hale,
this is the new tenant

106
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,311
I was tellin' you about.

107
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,679
He's ready to rent
for a few weeks.

108
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,047
-Great.
-Hey, Tom.

109
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,682
-Hey, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

110
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:38,817
And this is my pain in the ass,
my cross to bear.

111
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,885
My lovely wife, Devon.

112
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,121
Hi. I see you've already
met my fourth choice.

113
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,658
Fourth choice. I thought
I was one of the three.

114
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,128
She had another one there.
She's always angry.

115
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,129
-What are you drinking, sir?
-I'll have a Dewars.

116
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,298
-Okay. Ice?
-Neat.

117
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:56,134
And, beer pack.
Anything you do on tap is fine.

118
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,137
I'll do the same, Devon.

119
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:00,705
I love this place
on a Friday night.

120
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,311
Mitch.
Thank you...

121
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,180
The ideas to write for those
who'd write themselves.

122
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,549
Otherwise decreed by God.

123
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,202
Excuse me?

124
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:34,840
Hey, hey, hey.

125
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:35,874
Sir?

126
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,810
Jesus...

127
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:39,778
Are you okay?

128
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:53,057
What am I missing?

129
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,393
You just have to trust in

130
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:57,028
the good Lord
on this one, son, and see

131
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:59,932
you won't be rid
of old Poe for the night

132
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:03,769
once he sits down
and starts his... rambling.

133
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:07,339
Better a sober cannibal than
a drunken Christian, bud?

134
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:11,810
So, pray tell and what
brings you to Bodega Bay?

135
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:16,715
I'm,
writing a piece on the birds.

136
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:20,686
The, film that was shot
up here in the 1960's.

137
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:23,222
It's, approaching
its semicentennial anniversary

138
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,724
and, the paper
I work for is,

139
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:27,225
looking for an interesting spin.

140
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,894
The "San Francisco Noise."

141
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,297
I thought that was
an investigator magazine

142
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,067
that's a... current
affairs publications?

143
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,435
It is. It is. It is.

144
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,903
We also have a large
arts and media section

145
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,906
and, it has been a...

146
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:42,974
I believe it has been
a real push lately

147
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,209
for the old classics.

148
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:47,245
Well, where will you start?

149
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,417
I was thinking of
starting with the locals.

150
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,451
And, visiting the landmarks.

151
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,455
You know,
uncovering all the facts

152
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,457
all the fun facts
and stuffs like that.

153
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,993
You just tell me
if you need anything

154
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,327
my church
is right around the corner

155
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,398
and the light
is always on, okay?

156
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:09,234
Alright. Now,
I've gotta make my rounds

157
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:10,869
ahem, before I return.

158
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,171
Nice meeting you, Ed.

159
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,905
You too, father. Take care.

160
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,841
Goodnight.

161
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:19,244
Hey, you know, what, another
round does sound good, Anne, Ed?

162
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,814
-Yes. Absolutely. Definitely.
-Yeah. Thank you.

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,783
Thanks, Mitch.

164
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,152
So the interviews you make...

165
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:29,921
I-I mean, conduct.

166
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,825
Um... would I...

167
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:37,128
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm saying.

168
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:38,931
A-are you interested in helping?

169
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,300
I-I mean, I can do that.

170
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:44,001
Um, yeah, I mean,
I'm always here

171
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:48,973
and... I know everybody
and practically everything

172
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:51,142
and I've probably
seen that movie

173
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,945
a hundred times
when I was a kid.

174
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:56,881
What I'm really looking
for, Anne, is some information.

175
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,886
What kind of information?

176
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:05,857
Well, can I trust you?

177
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,962
-Hello. Hey.
-Ruddy!

178
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:12,965
-It's a fuck...
-Do you hear me?

179
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,366
-Fucking idiot!
-I didn't hear.

180
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,135
Give me my fucking money
for cigarettes. Give me it.

181
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,138
-Just hold the fuck on!
-Give it! Give it...

182
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,240
Getting the fucking pay
for you, bitch.

183
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,541
Give me a, give me your fiddle.

184
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:24,308
Give me your fiddle.

185
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:28,813
Whoo! Mop it up. Mop it up.

186
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,821
You better fucking find
a ride home. Piece of...

187
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:38,524
Hey, Dane.

188
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,026
Y'all settled in there?

189
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:42,226
Hi, Anne.

190
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,961
Good to see you.

191
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,297
You look nice tonight.

192
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,399
Don't she look
nice tonight, Dane?

193
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,469
Feel like singing a song
about her.

194
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:58,210
Dane, I'm at the bar, come on!

195
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:01,346
God, that's fucking great.
Look at the shit.

196
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,382
Look at this.

197
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:08,187
The dead deer... walks at night.

198
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,291
The dead deer
comes for you, Anne.

199
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,258
We were fucking driving down
and Ruddi just

200
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,862
boom, runs into this deer
that just walked out there

201
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:20,031
and then we had to pick it's
fucking horns out of the grill.

202
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,900
-Shit was crazy.
-That is terrible, Dane.

203
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,402
Why did you bring it in here?

204
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:26,070
Because it's cute.

205
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,272
-Cute?
-Like you.

206
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,573
No.

207
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:29,607
-Like you.
-Stop.

208
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,142
-Like you.
-Stop it.

209
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:32,945
-Like you.
-Stop it.

210
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:34,947
Take your demons with ya!

211
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,883
You're gonna pay for this,
Tom, you old fucker!

212
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,219
I'll rip you a new one,
you little bitch.

213
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,552
Don't you think that we forgot

214
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:44,423
how you piped up
for that fucking killer.

215
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,893
Yeah, that's right.
Big fucking Tom!

216
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:50,629
Nobody's keeping your
fucking secrets!

217
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,865
Yeah, that's right. I know
all your fucking secrets, Tom.

218
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:59,337
You know the fucking truth,
all you fuckers!

219
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,439
My brother, see now he's
gettin' out soon, right?

220
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,341
Little Jack.

221
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,477
That's funny. It's just a big
joke to you, ain't it?

222
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,249
Yeah. See how you're laughing
when my brother gets out.

223
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,252
Yeah. And this bar, you're done.

224
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:15,620
All you fuckers!

225
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:17,522
You are fucked.

226
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:19,524
He's gonna fuck everything up.

227
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,259
Yeah, little rabbit
son of a bitch.

228
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:25,529
Tell your rabbit,
tell your rabbit

229
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:26,631
little brother to bring it on.

230
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,266
Get the fuck off of me.

231
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,034
Now get out of my bar, boy.

232
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,602
Get out!

233
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:34,639
-You're bigger than him.
-You go.

234
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:38,342
Tom, you can't just go around
fucking assaulting good people.

235
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:42,081
Dane! Get the fuck
out of my bar now.

236
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:45,349
Get out, you fucker.

237
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:47,086
Fuck out of here.

238
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,055
Move along!

239
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,560
Next one's on the house, folks.

240
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,332
-Happens.
-It happens.

241
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:02,433
That didn't scare you off?

242
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:05,904
No, it takes more than that.

243
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,157
Mr. Hawthorne, Ed Hale.

244
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,094
"San Francisco Noise."

245
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,596
Mr. Hawthorne...

246
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,504
Is there no merciful reprieve

247
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:15,574
for good men
on Earth's dry surface?

248
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:18,275
I'm getting visits.

249
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,044
A reporter came here, said that

250
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,648
he wanted to do a story on me.

251
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,651
On my side of what happened.

252
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,788
He says everybody in the town
has talked about it

253
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:33,492
and I have a right
to do the same.

254
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,427
What do you think?

255
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,796
That's curious.

256
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:41,366
I wonder, Joseph,
did you perhaps call him here?

257
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:47,339
What?

258
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,673
Why would you say that?

259
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:51,308
He said the same thing.

260
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,144
I didn't mean to imply
that you had

261
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:56,648
I was simply asking because,
well, it seems rather peculiar

262
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:59,051
that this gentleman
would venture all the way out

263
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,584
here for no apparent reason.

264
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:03,655
What would be his motivation?

265
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,557
What if I called him?
What if I called him?

266
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,826
What if I...

267
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:10,761
What if I contacted...
I don't even remember.

268
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:13,664
The best thing to do now
is to join me in the water

269
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:17,302
this way we know the truth
and what we're up against.

270
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:21,273
I don't have time for that
right now.

271
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,576
Maybe he knows something
about Annabel.

272
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,478
What happened that day...

273
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:31,615
Why she can't rest.

274
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:35,519
You haven't been back
for quite sometime.

275
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:37,589
Are you certain
you're up for it?

276
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:47,264
If you could swim

277
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:49,167
I'd swim with you, Joseph.

278
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:53,804
If I could walk,
I'd walk with you.

279
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,137
Anybody missin' a dog?

280
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,811
Hey... there you go.

281
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:38,182
Hey.

282
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:50,629
Hi.

283
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,333
Hi.

284
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,769
I'm sweating, I know.

285
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,840
-It's hot out there, I'm sure.
-Yeah.

286
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:04,308
I see you find my girl.

287
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:05,811
Her name is Glory.

288
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,548
She's fine. She's cool.

289
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,584
I-is, um...

290
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,622
I-is Dr-Dr. George...

291
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:20,325
Is he in town? Is he here?

292
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:21,893
George Reinhart?

293
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:25,396
He moved last year.
I'm his replacement.

294
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:28,532
He-he moved?

295
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:31,803
That's what they tell me.
I've never met him.

296
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,507
May I sit down for a second?

297
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,408
Yeah.

298
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:44,316
I'm Sweetie.

299
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,852
I'm Joseph.

300
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,856
What medications
are you on, Joseph?

301
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,895
Lithium and others.

302
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:01,966
You know what? Um, I don't...

303
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,636
I just, I just wanted to ask him
some questions and I don't

304
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,440
I don't really need anything.
I was hot.

305
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:09,974
I was in the area.

306
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,344
Just wanted a place
to cool down.

307
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,778
I understand.

308
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:17,715
Well, I'm a doctor, too.

309
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,817
I can answer any question
you might have.

310
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:24,855
You know, in fact I'd like to.

311
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:26,625
It's really boring here today.

312
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:34,432
Why don't we just start off
really nice and easy?

313
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:37,001
Tell me your full name,
I can look you up in the system.

314
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,770
We can go from there.

315
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:47,346
Can you-can you give me
some water... before we start?

316
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,649
Of course.

317
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,017
I'll be right back.

318
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,706
Mitch! I think you're missing
the point here.

319
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,308
It's still an alcoholic beverage
and you're still driving.

320
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,511
No, this is a hot toddy.

321
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,012
-Mitch!
-It's medicine.

322
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:23,548
It's basically a liquid form
of lozenge, you know?

323
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,516
-It's lemon and honey...
-And Scotch.

324
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:26,684
Yes, there's some Scotch
in there

325
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,787
but it helps my throat.

326
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,922
Yeah, they also say, it helps
while driving a mortar vehicle.

327
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,523
My God. Okay, okay.

328
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,793
Agree to disagree.
Just... You know what?

329
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,528
Here, let me take a look
at that list, penman.

330
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,596
I gotta... get back to the barn.

331
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:40,964
I got work to do.
Okey-dokey. O-okay.

332
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,634
So Bodega Bay pier.

333
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:48,038
Lawman's bluff.
The court house?

334
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:50,774
I'm sorry, maybe I'm not
the-the world's best tour guide

335
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,345
but I didn't have any of these
places mapped out for us.

336
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,048
I'm not here to do
the bird story.

337
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,652
I could care less about that.

338
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:02,921
I'm here to do a piece
on Joseph Hawthorne.

339
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,860
Did you change your mind?

340
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,329
I lied to you so you'd let me
stay at your place.

341
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:13,731
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:19,471
Mitch.

343
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,612
Mitch.

344
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:29,079
Hey, Ed, I don't wanna
talk to you right now.

345
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:30,882
You need to leave me be
for a spell.

346
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:32,817
No, I understand that.
Just hear me out first.

347
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,986
No! Look that was not cool, man.
You betrayed my trust.

348
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:37,855
I'm letting you stay
in my freaking house.

349
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:39,723
You should have been
straight with me.

350
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:42,693
You're right, there's nothing
I can say to you that's gonna

351
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:45,864
excuse my dishonesty, but I
didn't have much of a choice.

352
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,932
-What the hell was that mean?
-Full disclosure.

353
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:50,934
My office received a phone call
from Joseph Hawthorne.

354
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,836
He said he wanted to clear
his name in the town

355
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:55,439
and he wanted us to do his story

356
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:57,776
about him and this case.

357
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,644
His exclusive recounting
of what happened

358
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:02,012
the day his wife went missing.

359
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:05,182
Listen, you-you... you need to
go straight to him with this.

360
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:06,550
I can't help you with any of it.

361
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:07,751
I already tried that.

362
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:09,086
He doesn't remember
calling me here.

363
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,521
How the hell would he?

364
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,956
He's a sick man and a recluse.

365
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,792
-Do you want his story?
-Yeah.

366
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,660
Take him out of here like you
did with the Boiler Brothers

367
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,095
in Indian country.

368
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:24,836
Wait. H-how did you...

369
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:28,872
Look,
that was different, um...

370
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,875
Those boys were in real danger.

371
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:32,810
Why did you get me
involved in this?

372
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,013
Your place is far enough away
but close enough

373
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,048
to get what I need.

374
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,884
Hawthorne gave my assistant
a list of caveats.

375
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,453
And if any of these
weren't met he'd pull out

376
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,788
and I'd lose the whole story.

377
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:48,692
We could only send
one reporter and it had to me.

378
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:50,161
No one can know why
I'm in town

379
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:53,063
and I have to come up
with another cover story.

380
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,932
Hence, the birds.

381
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,670
As far as run-of-the-mill
reporting goes, this hasn't

382
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:00,504
exactly been a cakewalk, Mitch.

383
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,074
Ed...

384
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:07,912
when she disappeared...

385
00:24:07,944 --> 00:24:08,946
people lost it.

386
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,714
I mean, this whole town divided.

387
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:12,182
I mean, half of 'em
don't believe him

388
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,218
and the other half they...

389
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:16,753
they don't wanna speak
because they're...

390
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:18,722
they're too afraid.

391
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:20,825
What do they have
to be afraid off?

392
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:23,161
I don't know, Dane Baker
and Annabel's brothers

393
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:24,928
Ruddi and Jack Lee.

394
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,897
From the bar the other night?
The loud mouth?

395
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:29,701
Yeah. Yeah, and that's Ruddi.

396
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:32,569
Okay, if that family finds out
that you're poking around...

397
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:34,572
they'll come after you.

398
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:37,008
If you posture and pour any of
your intellectual cheeky logic

399
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,009
with them, they're-they're
gonna hurt you.

400
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,811
Alright. So help me
navigate around here.

401
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:41,846
No.

402
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:43,113
We'll be as delicate as possible

403
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:44,648
and together,
we'll be credited

404
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:45,983
with hooking one of
the most intriguing

405
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,585
stories in the last five years.

406
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:49,287
-No.
-Mitch.

407
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,655
Mitch, there's a witness.

408
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,057
Someone saw what happened

409
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:55,826
but their identity,
it's been protected.

410
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:57,728
This is public information.

411
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:01,031
This is exciting stuff. Come on.

412
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:03,201
I need fucking ally. Help me.

413
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:22,646
Annabel!

414
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,791
Annabel Lee! Don't leave!

415
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:35,893
Annabel!

416
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:37,794
Annabel!

417
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:42,634
Annabel!

418
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:56,013
That's what I'm talking about.

419
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,414
That's what I'm sitting here
educating you of.

420
00:26:57,448 --> 00:26:59,717
-What's that, Joseph?
-I feel good!

421
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,252
I feel good! Whoo!

422
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:07,191
I'm powerful, I'm smart
and it's all coming together.

423
00:27:07,223 --> 00:27:08,960
These people...

424
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:10,761
this town...

425
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,997
my perdition,
it's all making sense now.

426
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:15,966
I wish I could give you, I wish
I could give you this feeling.

427
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,670
It's explosive.
It's absolute victory.

428
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:21,806
It's Bible, it's sacrament,
it's everything!

429
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:27,144
It's deserved and I'm owed this.

430
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,380
Whoo!

431
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,420
I want to touch you.

432
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:39,190
I want to touch you.

433
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:41,259
So you could...

434
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,726
so you could feel it.

435
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,327
I wanna transfer

436
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:46,798
this fucking lightning storm
so you could feel

437
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,899
what I feel, what I can!
You know why?

438
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:50,367
Because you would burn!

439
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,737
Baby, you would burn!

440
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:57,075
You would burn so hot

441
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,911
and for so long...

442
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:01,878
that I have to bring you back.

443
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:03,914
That's what happened to her.

444
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:06,451
The sea...

445
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:09,019
took her... from me.

446
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,759
So he could bathe in her
luminance and crown her...

447
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,326
my queen.

448
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:20,932
Come here.

449
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:22,332
Come here.

450
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:23,734
Grab my hand. Grab my hand.

451
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:24,969
I'm not gonna hurt you.

452
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:27,105
I'm not gonna hurt you.

453
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:31,274
You feel her brea...
Her veins breathing?

454
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:33,344
You feel that?

455
00:28:34,244 --> 00:28:36,380
God! It feels so good!

456
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:39,451
And only I can feel it...

457
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,987
because I got fire

458
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,089
in my heart.

459
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:49,459
God! It feels so good!

460
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:51,495
To own it!

461
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:54,397
Take it in.

462
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:56,234
Breathe, breathe in.

463
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,269
Take it all in!

464
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,249
Joseph...

465
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:13,183
how long would you say
we've been here for?

466
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:15,253
What is this? A test?

467
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,255
I'm just wondering if you knew.

468
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,490
Twenty, thirty minutes.

469
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:23,427
We sat down at five.
It's now 9:30 at night.

470
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,397
You've only calmed down enough
in the last five minutes

471
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:30,535
for me to be able
to talk to you.

472
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,903
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but I have enough knowledge

473
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,438
to know that you need help.

474
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:38,442
I think you're trapped
in a severe psychotic state

475
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:42,413
cycling between melancholia
and mania... and hallucinating.

476
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:45,115
Why would you s...
Why would you say that?

477
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:47,184
Because you're doing it
right now.

478
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,289
There's no one there, Joseph!

479
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:57,796
Jesus Christ.

480
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:02,834
I'm losing my mind.

481
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,609
You're just lost in your mind.

482
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:13,812
We have to get you back.

483
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,348
All you need are a couple
of good directions back.

484
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:20,117
Maybe a... high-powered GPS

485
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,086
with a crazy man
tracking device.

486
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,222
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

487
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,557
Don't be.

488
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:29,259
I'm glad you came to town
and I met you.

489
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:31,428
I don't have many friends here.

490
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,964
You thought you'd start
with the nutty guys first.

491
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:39,037
I guess my daddy complex works
to your advantage in this case.

492
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,211
These are the same pills
that you were on.

493
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:49,947
It says you are being treated
for bipolar 1?

494
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:53,017
Yeah.

495
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:55,153
And its refill
was over a year ago.

496
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,422
Look, this morning
you were apathetic

497
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:00,390
and tonight you were
hysterically manic.

498
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,993
You won't be able
to control it without these.

499
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,199
Can I see you again?

500
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,169
Take your medicine
and we'll see.

501
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:21,913
Do you love her?

502
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:23,881
Don't start.

503
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:28,184
She's nice,
she wants to help me.

504
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:30,153
Don't you got
any other friends down there?

505
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:32,990
Yes. Yes, I do, indeed.

506
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:35,959
But you're my best friend,
Joseph.

507
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:37,995
Is that okay?

508
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:41,499
I want my life again.

509
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:43,934
I'm suffering her.

510
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,437
I imagine
you'll return to church.

511
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,472
Maybe. Maybe not.
Maybe a lot of things.

512
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:51,042
Maybe...

513
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,213
Maybe this is good for me.

514
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:01,484
Sweetie gave me some pills,
I gonna take 'em.

515
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:03,621
I'm gonna take the pills!

516
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:08,459
Did I tell you...
I dreamt that I was a bird?

517
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:11,095
Odd really, when you think about
it because I've never imagined

518
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:13,596
myself to be another creature...

519
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,668
and yet still,
I could fly very high and wide.

520
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:19,703
Soar and dive.

521
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,273
It was truly remarkable.

522
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:26,009
I recall I was following you
through town

523
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:28,244
on the way to the ocean.

524
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,281
I was gliding above
making sure you were safe

525
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:33,616
making sure you were happy.

526
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,553
Then all of a sudden

527
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,520
you disappeared
beneath the older trees

528
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:39,290
and bushes where I could
no longer see you

529
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:41,559
no longer call to you
or protect you.

530
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:46,663
I felt helpless...
and started to panic.

531
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:49,566
So I dropped down
into the heavy foliage.

532
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,469
When I finally broke through...

533
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,739
I was the one walking

534
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:57,008
and the ocean
was in front of me.

535
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:59,710
I looked to the sky

536
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:02,346
and the bird
was now flying above me.

537
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:07,050
If I have
to swim away from you

538
00:33:07,084 --> 00:33:09,120
I will, Joseph

539
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,489
because I know
we will always be friends.

540
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:15,625
But please,
tell me more about the girl

541
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,695
on the boat before I go.

542
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:44,454
Ruddi, get out here! Hey, Jack.

543
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,028
Jack.

544
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,065
You're home.

545
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:55,298
Hey.

546
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,071
Where is she?

547
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:05,208
I'm gonna take your...
I'll take you to her.

548
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:10,280
Hey, come on,
get the, get the keys.

549
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,782
Get the keys. Come on.

550
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:16,153
I'm just gonna get dressed.
You wanna come in and wait?

551
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,125
Get the keys!

552
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:47,585
-Just come in.
-No.

553
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:49,586
-Nothing's gonna happen.
-I'm not coming in, please.

554
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,621
You need to respect my
boundaries while we're in town.

555
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,724
Nothing is going
to happen, Mitch.

556
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,627
Alright. Fine.

557
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,463
-Can I get you anything?
-No.

558
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:01,532
I'll just go up the street
and get something.

559
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,778
I don't know, Joseph

560
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:20,585
but... Annabel was my friend.

561
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:24,855
Okay. Let's start there.

562
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:28,491
Tell me about her.

563
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:31,362
Tell me something.

564
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:33,563
It's kind of hard
to describe her.

565
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:36,367
'Cause she's not like anyone
you've ever met before.

566
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,303
You know how you meet people in
life and they always remind you

567
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:43,306
of somebody that you knew or
you met and you're always like

568
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,844
"You remind me of Scott.
Or you're so much like Terra."

569
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:53,583
She was the only Annabel Lee
I have ever met.

570
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:59,657
She smiled a lot.

571
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,458
She sang.

572
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:04,495
She was a painter.

573
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:07,197
And she could talk to anybody.

574
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,600
I mean, anybody.
Didn't matter who you were.

575
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:17,642
And she was so stunningly
beautiful and had no idea.

576
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:22,813
She was just like this...

577
00:36:22,846 --> 00:36:25,715
nice, beautiful person.

578
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,554
To know her was special.

579
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:35,193
I miss her.

580
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:38,728
Are you okay?

581
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:41,898
I'm sorry. I think I messed up.

582
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:45,868
It's fine. It's fine.

583
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:48,472
Anne...

584
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,675
who's the witness to all this?

585
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:55,445
Excuse me for a second.

586
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:57,847
Anne? Anne? Anne.

587
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:03,886
You've been in town
for over a week.

588
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,990
What are you up to, city boy?

589
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,628
Those are private.

590
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:14,564
Dusty, those are private.
Give them back.

591
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,334
Dusty.

592
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,870
You're here doing a story
on my family?

593
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:22,505
There are many people
outside of Bodega

594
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:24,508
in the greater community
that wish to know

595
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:27,411
the details of this story.

596
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:29,913
There's a lot more to this
than you know.

597
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:32,516
And talking to some naive
school teacher who doesn't know

598
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:35,652
the half of it,
that's dirty in my eyes.

599
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,888
Probably in my husbands, too.

600
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,723
Not to mention
how Jack would feel about it.

601
00:37:40,757 --> 00:37:42,760
That's a whole other thing.

602
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,930
Well, that sounds threatening.

603
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:49,032
No.

604
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:51,567
I'm not gonna say anything.

605
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:53,304
You think I wanna pay
to get Ruddi out of jail

606
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:56,507
for what he'd do to you?

607
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:58,074
I just can't promise
that Deedee is gonna

608
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:00,911
keep her mouth shut.

609
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,514
Okay, Dusty, I'll play along.

610
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,315
Who's Deedee?

611
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,784
She's my other personality.

612
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,652
She comes out when I drink

613
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:10,788
and she can be
quite a troublemaker.

614
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,089
And she might think your actions
here are a little disrespectful

615
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,326
to her family.

616
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,495
Don't get so worried.

617
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,363
I'm not drinking until tonight.

618
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:22,065
You still have
a couple of hours.

619
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,335
Am I making sense, Mr. Hale?

620
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,072
Yes. Got it.

621
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:32,710
Dusty, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting later.

622
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:36,880
We are. I just popped in to help
this man get his facts straight.

623
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:42,619
Ready?

624
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:49,592
-Happy birthday, Dusty Lee.
-Thanks.

625
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,394
Have a safe trip back.

626
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:53,529
Trying to fuck over
the whole family?

627
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:17,887
Hey, Sweetie.

628
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:20,057
Hi.

629
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,673
Do you like my flowers?

630
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:37,841
Thank you.

631
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,471
Forgot the blanket.

632
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:25,789
She's just up here a ways.

633
00:40:28,057 --> 00:40:29,760
Had 'em,

634
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:32,496
put her off to the side
just so...

635
00:40:32,528 --> 00:40:34,831
You know, away from the other
stones, like you said.

636
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:40,137
She, she looked good
in mom's dress, you know.

637
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,643
-She looked...
-Ruddi.

638
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:48,879
She...

639
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:52,048
Go home.

640
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,055
Hey, how-how are you gonna...

641
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:01,525
how are you gonna
get back then?

642
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,815
These are lovely. Thank you.

643
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:28,285
The white's supposed to mean
reverence and humility

644
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,888
which I thought was fitting.

645
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,224
Thank you
for listening to me

646
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:39,163
and... you know, helping me
with my medicine.

647
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,900
How do you feel?

648
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:45,902
Was pretty clouded the first
three or four days, then it just

649
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,506
you know, got a little
less desperate.

650
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:52,242
Go on.

651
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:54,110
My head's cleared now, you know.

652
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:57,547
I'm not all over the place
with the thoughts.

653
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,883
What was the second pill
that you, you gave me for...

654
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:02,085
It was a...

655
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:04,855
It's an anti-psychotic medicine.

656
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:07,156
Used to treat the manic episode
you were having

657
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,826
but now that it's settled down

658
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:11,761
all you need
is some mood stabilizer.

659
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:12,963
How do you know
all this shit?

660
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:15,898
...one, I'm a doctor

661
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:18,134
and two, I care to know.

662
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:25,643
Who is Annabel?

663
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:30,880
Annabel...

664
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:34,951
was my wife.

665
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,688
She... died...

666
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:42,025
in an accident in the water.

667
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,932
I'm so sorry.

668
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:51,100
What happened?

669
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,141
It was a storm...

670
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,345
and her boat tipped over.

671
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:05,248
She... By the time
they found her, she'd drowned.

672
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,684
There was nothing more
they could have done.

673
00:43:10,286 --> 00:43:13,123
That's why you
went off your medicine

674
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:15,157
didn't leave the house.

675
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,894
'Cause you were depressed
because you loved her.

676
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:19,862
Yeah.

677
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:23,866
Sorry.

678
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,103
What's that?

679
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,806
That?

680
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:35,012
That's a combination of my ex

681
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,215
birth control pills and two
really good bottles of wine.

682
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:41,784
From my perspective, all three
of those sound pretty good.

683
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:46,155
Yeah, at the time
they sounded good to me too.

684
00:43:48,023 --> 00:43:49,859
He was abusive?

685
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:54,397
No. No.

686
00:43:56,365 --> 00:43:58,369
I was.

687
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,039
I was a nightmare.

688
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,208
I was a completely
different person.

689
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:11,148
He, he was a really good guy
that was just trying to help me

690
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,884
until it all just...

691
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:15,918
basically imploded.

692
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:19,690
So that's when you moved here?

693
00:44:19,722 --> 00:44:22,324
So you can be good
for a change?

694
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:25,696
Take a break from,
torturing men

695
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:27,029
drinking like a pirate.

696
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:33,469
So, family?

697
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:36,907
Brothers, sisters, mom, dad?

698
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,010
-Only child.
-Really?

699
00:44:40,043 --> 00:44:42,778
You're so good
with women, Joe.

700
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,815
I would have thought
you had sisters.

701
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:45,849
Nah, no sisters.

702
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:47,184
My mother left when I was six

703
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,485
and my father brought me up
after that.

704
00:44:49,518 --> 00:44:52,221
That must have been hard.

705
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:56,460
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

706
00:44:57,827 --> 00:44:59,830
Well, do you remember her?

707
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:01,063
Some stuff.

708
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:03,333
She was... nice

709
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:05,268
very affectionate,
very protective

710
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,003
that kind of thing.

711
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:10,039
And your dad?

712
00:45:11,106 --> 00:45:13,809
He was a...

713
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:16,312
He was a diary farmer
at a pasture in this town.

714
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:20,217
Is he still alive?

715
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,485
I don't know.

716
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:24,721
That's the reason
my mother left.

717
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:27,423
Would you like me to tell you...

718
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:30,226
why my mother left?

719
00:45:32,862 --> 00:45:35,164
No. It's fine.

720
00:45:35,197 --> 00:45:37,233
Screw you.

721
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:42,004
...Anyway, this is me.

722
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:47,878
Um, this your house?

723
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,479
I used to go
to Sunday school here.

724
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:51,381
-Really?
-No, really.

725
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:53,083
You do... You-you live here?

726
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:55,219
Yeah, I'm renting the top floor.

727
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:59,822
Do you wanna come in
and see it?

728
00:46:04,393 --> 00:46:07,296
Stop.

729
00:46:09,532 --> 00:46:12,068
Tell me that you love me...

730
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:13,135
I can't...

731
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:18,575
I can't play right now.
I gotta rest some.

732
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:21,111
It's not play, Joe.

733
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:25,882
Forget it.

734
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:29,985
Really?

735
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:31,153
Never mind.

736
00:46:31,186 --> 00:46:33,522
-No, listen.
-Stop.

737
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,125
Annabel...

738
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,897
I've never loved anyone more.

739
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,068
I can't imagine livin' a life
without you in it.

740
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:48,938
You know that.

741
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:53,009
What if I die before you?

742
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:55,010
See, that's why I don't like
talking about this.

743
00:46:55,043 --> 00:46:57,047
Would you love again?

744
00:46:58,313 --> 00:47:00,416
Would you trick your heart
so easily?

745
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:05,988
You are my heart...

746
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,858
and my love.

747
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:23,105
You ate all my cherry waffles.

748
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:26,509
It's all the medicine that you
gave me. It's not my fault.

749
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,578
Last night was fun, Joe.

750
00:47:30,545 --> 00:47:32,615
Yeah, it was.

751
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:36,552
So...

752
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:39,889
what's next?

753
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:44,994
You tell me.

754
00:47:45,027 --> 00:47:46,395
We were just here.
We got kicked out.

755
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:49,331
-I can't fucking deal with her.
-Go in.

756
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:51,333
You go see if they're in here.
Why do I always have to...

757
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,303
Just do what I fuckin' say!

758
00:47:53,335 --> 00:47:55,371
-What's this about?
-Don't fucking touch me.

759
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,973
Do not fucking touch me.
I'm not kidding.

760
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:58,141
I don't know,
but it can't be good.

761
00:47:58,173 --> 00:47:59,442
Now, you two, listen to me.

762
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:01,277
No one here wants
any trouble with you

763
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,646
so just turn around and go
right back where you came from.

764
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:05,248
It has nothing to do with you...

765
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,116
I will break you in half
if you will ever

766
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,151
speak that way...

767
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,655
You stay the fuck out of it!

768
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,657
-Get off of me.
-This is about our family!

769
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,092
No. Not in my bar.

770
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:19,028
I'm going to get my husband
and the sheriff...

771
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:21,163
-Go get anyone you want, woman!
-Yeah, you go get 'em, bitch!

772
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:23,266
-Them.
-Get the fuck out.

773
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:25,067
Get the fuck out! Go!

774
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:27,137
Go! Get the fuck out!

775
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,574
Hey! I'm Jack.

776
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:34,243
Shake it.

777
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,947
I said, shake it!

778
00:48:44,653 --> 00:48:46,255
Good.

779
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,260
This man tell you who I am?

780
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:53,630
Better yet, better yet.
Did this man tell you who he is?

781
00:48:56,465 --> 00:48:59,635
Me? I'm his wife's brother.

782
00:48:59,668 --> 00:49:01,670
His family.

783
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:04,140
A troubled convict.

784
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:07,343
Him? He's a coward.

785
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:12,082
He's a liar. And he's a thief.

786
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:15,551
-Jack...
-Don't say a word!

787
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,320
What are you talking about?

788
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:20,289
Your new boyfriend is a bad guy.

789
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:22,558
He's a killer, doc.

790
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,126
Yeah.

791
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,264
You didn't tell her, Joe?

792
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,668
This man...

793
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:34,304
if you can call him that much

794
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:38,440
took our baby sister
out on a boat ride.

795
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:40,711
And when they came back,
guess what?

796
00:49:42,478 --> 00:49:44,748
She wasn't with him.

797
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,416
What was it, Rude? A...

798
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:50,285
There was an angler
off a darn beach

799
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:52,654
had to fish her out.

800
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:54,391
Yeah.

801
00:49:54,423 --> 00:49:56,492
He took from us.

802
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:58,527
From my family.

803
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:01,431
A daughter and a sister.

804
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:03,400
You were on that boat, Joseph?

805
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,536
-Is that the truth?
-Of course it is.

806
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:08,737
-I just said it.
-I wasn't on the boat with her.

807
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,541
No. You fuckin' lie about it...

808
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,780
and I'll cut you in half...

809
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,282
right now.

810
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:22,117
Joseph, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. What was it again?

811
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,753
Was it a, was it a,
a blue whale?

812
00:50:24,786 --> 00:50:27,790
No, no, a humpback?

813
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,325
In the spring, right?

814
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:30,794
-The humpback whale.
-The humpback whale.

815
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,363
It was a g... The gray whale.

816
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:34,697
Yeah, the gray whale.

817
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:39,202
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

818
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:43,506
No citation, migratin'
in spring, you fuckin' fool.

819
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:45,375
They're lying,
I didn't, I-I didn't

820
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:46,643
do anything wrong, come on.

821
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:47,844
No, w-wait, ask him.

822
00:50:47,876 --> 00:50:49,645
Ask him how he makes a living?

823
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,381
You ask him.

824
00:50:51,414 --> 00:50:55,085
Ask him about our sister's
life insurance policy.

825
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:57,353
Tell her,
you fuckin' bottom-feeder.

826
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:04,594
Can I borrow something to draw?

827
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:06,128
Just me.

828
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,734
What him? Ruddi, Dane.

829
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,472
You touch him,
and I'll kill you both.

830
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,207
-No, Ruddi.
-Fuck.

831
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:21,110
-Alright, that's enough.
-That'll do, Jack.

832
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:22,578
You're gonna arrest me, Bill?

833
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,815
Like I have a dozen times
before, son.

834
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:29,351
Dane, get the hell out of here
before I kick your dumb ass.

835
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:33,090
Miss, you go home too.

836
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:40,297
I'm gonna bleed you out. Yeah?

837
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,599
I'm gonna bleed you out.

838
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,706
Look at that.

839
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:53,409
Big Tom Mulkheney?

840
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,347
I'm, I'm not little Lee anymore.

841
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,750
And you're not as scary
as you used to be, old man.

842
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,224
We, gonna have to work
some things out.

843
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:11,860
-That's enough, Jack.
-This suits me just fine.

844
00:52:11,893 --> 00:52:15,197
That's enough, guys. Alright,
Jack get out of here, come on.

845
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,217
Hi.

846
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,222
Really, Dusty?
Was that necessary?

847
00:52:40,255 --> 00:52:43,292
I told you this asshole's
doing a story on our family.

848
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,961
Trying to make Hawthorne
look innocent.

849
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:49,766
Dammit, Mitch.
Would you grab the index cards?

850
00:52:56,438 --> 00:52:58,674
You know,
I'd really like to speak

851
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,443
with you guys
if you have a moment.

852
00:53:03,778 --> 00:53:05,447
Jesus.

853
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:11,721
-Fuck!
-Let me explain. Can you stop?

854
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:14,289
Listen. I was afraid
that you would judge me.

855
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:15,991
Judge you?

856
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:17,626
Judge you for what?

857
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:18,795
You didn't do
anything wrong, right?

858
00:53:18,827 --> 00:53:20,295
That's why I didn't tell you

859
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:21,531
because of the way
you're acting right now.

860
00:53:21,563 --> 00:53:22,565
Why didn't you defend yourself

861
00:53:22,597 --> 00:53:24,000
in there, Joseph?

862
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:26,835
Why? Why didn't you say anything
back to those men?

863
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,005
You don't understand.

864
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:31,907
Well, you're innocent, right?

865
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,776
Why didn't you tell them that?

866
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:37,246
Why did you let that guy
talk all that crazy shit

867
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,449
if it wasn't true?

868
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:42,885
Why? Why did you lie to me?

869
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,822
So you could fuck me?

870
00:53:47,722 --> 00:53:49,759
I was just easy for you?

871
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:50,860
No!

872
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:54,830
I was the only one in town
who didn't know.

873
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:58,501
And I'm walking around
with you, with you

874
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:00,302
with God knows who!

875
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:01,770
Just let me explain, okay.

876
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:03,006
Did you do it?

877
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:09,411
Did you, Joseph?

878
00:54:11,313 --> 00:54:12,648
Did you kill your wife?

879
00:54:15,617 --> 00:54:17,487
Answer me!

880
00:54:19,722 --> 00:54:21,357
Well, that's just as reassuring

881
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:23,859
as the last 24 hours
have been, thank you.

882
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,795
What are those pills
doing in your bathroom?

883
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:30,065
Is your, what-what
is your life off limits?

884
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:34,037
I mean, since we're being honest
with each other here.

885
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,807
I was fired from my last job
in Ashlyn, where I told my boss

886
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,742
that I thought
that I was God's mother

887
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:43,480
and the pills I was distributing
were messages for my children.

888
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:49,418
I'm bipolar too, Joseph.

889
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:52,521
That's why I thought
I could help you.

890
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:56,793
Because I know when a man
is in despair

891
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,661
and how-how fast
and hard it can spiral

892
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:01,898
until you feel like
you're lookin' out of a cave.

893
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:05,868
Now, that's the truth.

894
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:11,440
You tell me the truth.
You tell me.

895
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:18,014
What really happened,
to your beautiful Annabel Lee?

896
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,994
I don't know.

897
00:55:43,706 --> 00:55:45,942
Unbelievable!

898
00:55:45,974 --> 00:55:47,743
I'm sorry about that, Jack,
the guy, he just

899
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,512
he slipped between
the cracks, you know.

900
00:55:50,545 --> 00:55:51,713
People at the rental office,
they said

901
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:53,081
that he was here
doin' a different story.

902
00:55:53,114 --> 00:55:54,516
I mean, figured him

903
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,652
to be an honest guy, you know.

904
00:55:56,684 --> 00:55:58,420
Can't trust anybody these days.

905
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:02,590
Right?

906
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:06,495
You saw me, though, right.
I told him that he-he can't.

907
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:08,931
He's gotta go, I mean,
he can't stay with me, he knows.

908
00:56:08,963 --> 00:56:11,433
No, sir. Not if, not if
he's gonna do that story.

909
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:16,905
You know, as soon as I found out it's you
and me, it was it was over, you know, no

910
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:20,542
no hesitation... whatsoever.

911
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,548
You know, I could really use the
money too. I was charged top dollar

912
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:28,050
for that room upstairs,
you know, you...

913
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,656
Jack! Hey, Jack! Wait...

914
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:39,162
Hey, I can, I can come by later,
you know. We can...

915
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,663
I can crack a beer, you know.

916
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:41,898
Let's straighten
this whole thing out

917
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,566
you know?

918
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,001
If that's, if that's better.

919
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:23,472
She would have walked.

920
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:26,541
And I never would've seen
her again, you know that.

921
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:28,977
More than anyone,
you know that.

922
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:33,081
What was I supposed to say?

923
00:57:33,114 --> 00:57:35,016
Hi, I'm Joseph.

924
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:37,687
I think my wife died,
but I don't exactly remember.

925
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,489
Can you fill my order,
and sleep with me?

926
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:45,795
It's not funny? No?

927
00:57:45,827 --> 00:57:48,063
You got nothin' to say?
No clear analogies?

928
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,033
No profound dream for me?

929
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:53,735
Talk to me.

930
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:59,742
I tried to have a life.

931
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:02,811
You want your chop,
because I put my health in...

932
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,516
in front of you?

933
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:09,485
Because I needed better?

934
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,656
Are you so jealous...

935
00:58:15,858 --> 00:58:19,528
that you would ignore...
a friend...

936
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:20,762
when he's like this?

937
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:25,233
I don't need you.

938
00:58:25,266 --> 00:58:26,935
I protected you.

939
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,974
You're the killer.

940
00:58:33,007 --> 00:58:36,778
You sprang up from the ocean
and took her from me.

941
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:38,882
You tipped the fuckin' boat.

942
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:42,552
Why am I being punished?

943
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:47,056
Whale!

944
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:49,759
I didn't mean it.

945
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:53,161
I didn't mean it.
Please, don't leave.

946
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:56,032
Whale! Don't leave me.

947
00:58:57,365 --> 00:58:58,568
Come back!

948
01:02:08,322 --> 01:02:10,326
I'm here.

949
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:29,210
There's no givin' that one.

950
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:31,247
Caught me
at the grocery yesterday.

951
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,083
Asked me about a 1,000
questions. Relentless.

952
01:02:34,115 --> 01:02:35,518
Yeah, well, if he's not careful

953
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,353
he's gonna get a lot more
than a story.

954
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,190
Nice enough fella though.

955
01:02:41,222 --> 01:02:42,458
It's Tom, right?

956
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:44,059
That's my name.

957
01:02:44,092 --> 01:02:47,061
I'm Sweetie.
I work at the pharmacy.

958
01:02:47,094 --> 01:02:49,831
That's where I met Joseph.

959
01:02:49,864 --> 01:02:50,899
Okay.

960
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:55,003
I just, I wanted to say hello...

961
01:02:55,036 --> 01:02:57,372
You wanna know if he did it.

962
01:02:57,405 --> 01:03:00,208
If I didn't care about him,
I wouldn't...

963
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:02,444
but I do.

964
01:03:02,476 --> 01:03:04,312
I'm worried about him
up in that house.

965
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:09,117
Look, I don't know
what happened that day

966
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:12,053
you know, to his wife.
I wasn't there.

967
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:13,822
Somebody was, I mean...

968
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,325
I mean, like I said,
it's, it's just...

969
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:17,994
it's just a big mess now.

970
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,296
Is he dangerous, Tom?

971
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:23,833
Look, every man's dangerous.
Every man.

972
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:25,333
I don't think
Joseph's any exception.

973
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:27,870
Do you think he did it?

974
01:03:29,271 --> 01:03:31,473
I think he's sick.

975
01:03:31,505 --> 01:03:33,308
I don't know that he's bad.

976
01:03:35,177 --> 01:03:37,278
What about that bald guy?

977
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:39,514
The one with the scars
and the tattoos.

978
01:03:39,547 --> 01:03:40,615
Why is he bothering Joseph...

979
01:03:40,648 --> 01:03:43,318
Yeah, well, he's bad.

980
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:45,855
Yeah, he just did a stretch
for manslaughter.

981
01:03:45,887 --> 01:03:48,556
He's been away
for the last ten years.

982
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:51,260
You know, all these
are family problems, miss.

983
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:52,327
These are local issues.

984
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,362
You shouldn't get yourself

985
01:03:53,394 --> 01:03:54,963
involved in this.

986
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:57,199
So nobody should get involved?

987
01:03:57,231 --> 01:03:59,101
Just wait around
while they kill him?

988
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:00,536
Look, I can't.

989
01:04:00,568 --> 01:04:03,438
I can't get mixed up
with this bunch.

990
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,008
You know, I've already
put myself out there.

991
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:08,077
-But you said...
-But I said, that I like him.

992
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,112
I would do anything
I can for him.

993
01:04:10,144 --> 01:04:12,447
And I would, but...

994
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,552
Look, everybody
has a past in this town.

995
01:04:17,585 --> 01:04:20,088
You know, I have a wife now.

996
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:22,357
I have a business,
I have responsibilities.

997
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:25,193
You understand that?

998
01:04:27,628 --> 01:04:29,964
-I understand.
-Okay.

999
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:32,501
You take care of yourself then.

1000
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:33,568
You too.

1001
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:55,657
-Hey, man.
-What the...

1002
01:04:59,327 --> 01:05:02,230
Little bit more.

1003
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:03,699
Just give me,
give me that damn thing.

1004
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:08,202
Jesus, where the hell...

1005
01:05:08,235 --> 01:05:10,371
Where the hell have you
been staying, anyway?

1006
01:05:10,405 --> 01:05:12,207
I've a home over
at the Ruby's Slipper.

1007
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:15,277
It's fine. What?

1008
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:16,978
It's nothing,
I'm-I'm just, I'm...

1009
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:19,214
I'm certain that's probably
the worst motel in town.

1010
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:23,952
Check it, you got bed bugs,
you got mold, you got filth.

1011
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:25,587
The guys won't even
take hookers there.

1012
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,559
Talk about story?

1013
01:05:31,592 --> 01:05:33,295
I was always wondering
why it was so expensive

1014
01:05:33,327 --> 01:05:34,362
for such a shit hole.

1015
01:05:37,398 --> 01:05:40,402
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry,
I kicked you out, buddy.

1016
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:42,637
I just...
Believe me, I had good reason.

1017
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,175
I understand.

1018
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,309
I wanted the story.

1019
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:52,448
And I wasn't very considerate
of your life here in town.

1020
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:56,118
It's my fault, I... I just...

1021
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,619
She's my cousin, Ed.

1022
01:06:03,157 --> 01:06:06,027
Why, why would you not
share that with me, Mitch?

1023
01:06:06,061 --> 01:06:08,329
I... You still don't get it,
do you?

1024
01:06:08,362 --> 01:06:09,630
No, I don't, I don't get it.

1025
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:11,367
Hey, right or wrong

1026
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,602
I can't be seen helpin' you,
because in their eyes

1027
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:15,604
it makes me a fuckin' traitor.

1028
01:06:15,637 --> 01:06:17,039
Just so happens,
I have a family that

1029
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:18,307
believes in capital punishment.

1030
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,608
That's why I got this guy.

1031
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:25,114
And... I'm just not quite
ready to give up the ghost.

1032
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:30,485
This town is so ass backwards.

1033
01:06:30,518 --> 01:06:32,153
These people are your cousins.

1034
01:06:32,186 --> 01:06:34,056
Are they not?

1035
01:06:34,088 --> 01:06:36,057
Your baby sister went out
to sea with her husband

1036
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:37,793
and never came back.

1037
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:40,195
Four hours later,
Joseph steers their family boat

1038
01:06:40,228 --> 01:06:41,463
into a rock at Lawman's Bluff.

1039
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:42,564
I know the story

1040
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:44,066
He comes back bruised and bloody

1041
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:46,367
with a story about this colossal

1042
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,103
pod of migrants that

1043
01:06:48,135 --> 01:06:49,670
crossed their path
and tipped their boat

1044
01:06:49,704 --> 01:06:52,208
knocked him out
and Annabel over the side.

1045
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:56,044
They don't see past
shit like that.

1046
01:06:56,077 --> 01:07:00,081
They don't understand
freak accidents, fate, destiny.

1047
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:03,818
These are not understood
or accepted concepts here, Ed.

1048
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:05,054
Specially not with the Lee's.

1049
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:06,221
But for them not to believe...

1050
01:07:06,253 --> 01:07:07,655
It-it-it doesn't matter.

1051
01:07:07,688 --> 01:07:10,525
Their own family
could tell them the truth.

1052
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,494
It doesn't matter.

1053
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:15,530
He came back... she didn't.

1054
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:18,533
And now we've interfered
and we're...

1055
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:21,302
we're all fucked.

1056
01:07:21,335 --> 01:07:24,605
-What an austere place.
-Tell me about it.

1057
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:30,411
Well... all there is left
to do is drink then?

1058
01:07:30,445 --> 01:07:32,448
Yeah.

1059
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,483
Now you're startin'
to get it, penman.

1060
01:07:55,402 --> 01:07:58,406
Mr. Hale, Mr. Hale, come here.

1061
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,777
-Anne?
-Yeah, come here.

1062
01:08:03,744 --> 01:08:05,380
Mitch...

1063
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:07,282
Don't bother with him right now.
Come here.

1064
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:08,550
I have something for you.

1065
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:18,860
Anne, am I dreaming?
What's goin' on?

1066
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:21,363
Do you still wanna meet the
witness to the Hawthorne murder?

1067
01:08:21,395 --> 01:08:22,831
Yes.

1068
01:08:22,863 --> 01:08:24,432
I can't bring them here
because they don't want

1069
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:26,568
anyone knowing who they are.

1070
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,604
Especially,
a family member of the Lees.

1071
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:33,608
I took a big risk
by coming here.

1072
01:08:33,641 --> 01:08:36,310
-Alright.
-Dane would kill me.

1073
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:38,514
-Do you wanna come with me?
-Yes.

1074
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:40,581
-Come on, we've to go now.
-Let's get Mitch.

1075
01:08:40,614 --> 01:08:42,851
No, just you. Come on.

1076
01:08:48,556 --> 01:08:49,724
Sshh.

1077
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:59,368
Come on, Mr. Hale.
It's just up here.

1078
01:09:02,436 --> 01:09:05,306
Anne, why did you say
it's a murder?

1079
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,309
What else would you call it?

1080
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:11,212
Actually...

1081
01:09:11,246 --> 01:09:12,882
And hello, Dusty.

1082
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:17,920
I'd call it an accident.

1083
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,556
An undesired event.

1084
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:22,957
Misfortune.

1085
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,527
I'd call this misfortune.

1086
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,763
Dusty, what are they doing here?

1087
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,264
Where's the witness?

1088
01:09:29,296 --> 01:09:31,465
Shut up, Anne.

1089
01:09:31,498 --> 01:09:32,934
Shut and get-get
the fuck over here.

1090
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,572
Come here.

1091
01:10:32,627 --> 01:10:35,764
Mr. Hale, I'm so sorry,
I had no idea.

1092
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:41,904
It's cold now!

1093
01:10:44,905 --> 01:10:47,408
I can smell the poison on you.

1094
01:10:49,577 --> 01:10:53,382
You feelin' no pain.

1095
01:10:53,414 --> 01:10:55,417
That's good.

1096
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:58,621
That's real good.

1097
01:11:01,823 --> 01:11:05,594
Joe... help me!

1098
01:11:05,627 --> 01:11:07,663
God, please, no.

1099
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:15,002
I'm so cold.

1100
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:52,673
-Joe.
-No.

1101
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:55,377
No, don't get near me.

1102
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:58,913
Jack's coming for you.

1103
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:03,786
He's gonna get you.

1104
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:08,724
You said you loved me.

1105
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:11,992
You let me
be like this, I'm cold.

1106
01:12:12,025 --> 01:12:14,095
You said that you loved me.

1107
01:12:17,097 --> 01:12:18,533
God...

1108
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,839
When I was 17, I went inside
for the first time.

1109
01:12:26,173 --> 01:12:28,543
I thought I was invincible.

1110
01:12:30,043 --> 01:12:33,814
I thought I had to prove
that I wasn't a punk.

1111
01:12:33,847 --> 01:12:37,085
So, I got to running my mouth.

1112
01:12:37,118 --> 01:12:41,056
In a place
I really didn't understand.

1113
01:12:43,457 --> 01:12:45,860
Wasn't long before
I caught a beef

1114
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,996
with one of the other prisoners.

1115
01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:51,566
He, wanted me to mule
or somethin' for him.

1116
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:53,668
I don't know.

1117
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:56,104
I told him that
I'd kill his family

1118
01:12:56,136 --> 01:12:59,006
if he ever spoke to me again.

1119
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:04,045
Few days later

1120
01:13:04,078 --> 01:13:07,582
about five of them
caught me off guard.

1121
01:13:07,614 --> 01:13:09,917
Beat me into a coma.

1122
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:12,087
Clipped off my tongue
with a dirty shiv

1123
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:14,622
and gave me this.

1124
01:13:17,524 --> 01:13:19,560
That was my punishment

1125
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:21,563
for disrespecting

1126
01:13:21,595 --> 01:13:24,500
them in their house.

1127
01:13:30,704 --> 01:13:33,074
Annabel...

1128
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:37,845
was the only one
who came to save me...

1129
01:13:37,878 --> 01:13:40,748
when I was hurt.

1130
01:13:40,782 --> 01:13:42,984
She said...

1131
01:13:43,016 --> 01:13:45,052
all this agony...

1132
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:46,922
was just...

1133
01:13:46,954 --> 01:13:50,658
was just temporary.

1134
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:53,761
"Don't let the pain
get in front of you.

1135
01:13:55,128 --> 01:13:58,132
No matter
how bad it gets, Jackie."

1136
01:14:01,836 --> 01:14:03,637
Okay, he says.

1137
01:14:03,671 --> 01:14:05,474
Okay.

1138
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:11,145
A few years later,
I caught the same guy and...

1139
01:14:12,814 --> 01:14:15,250
I cut him open
from his ear down

1140
01:14:15,283 --> 01:14:17,853
to his ankle with a can opener.

1141
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:21,723
It was his time
to learn a lesson.

1142
01:14:21,756 --> 01:14:23,525
So that was that.

1143
01:14:28,195 --> 01:14:30,198
Don't do this.

1144
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,603
Don't do this.
You're accountable.

1145
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,238
You're all accountable,
you hear me?

1146
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:38,806
You're all fucking
accountable!

1147
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,110
Don't let the pain
get in front of you.

1148
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:45,680
Please... please.

1149
01:14:45,712 --> 01:14:47,681
Now...

1150
01:14:47,715 --> 01:14:49,851
which hand do you write with?

1151
01:14:49,884 --> 01:14:52,554
What?

1152
01:14:52,587 --> 01:14:54,756
I said...

1153
01:14:54,788 --> 01:14:58,193
which hand do you write with?

1154
01:14:58,225 --> 01:14:59,960
My left.

1155
01:14:59,993 --> 01:15:01,729
-That one?
-Yes.

1156
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:19,213
Wait.

1157
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:22,117
Don't hurt more, please.

1158
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:25,186
What? What?

1159
01:15:29,023 --> 01:15:31,059
-Where's my shiv?
-Right there!

1160
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,167
No. Please.

1161
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,101
Please, please,
don't do that, don't...

1162
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:49,077
Help me!

1163
01:15:54,047 --> 01:15:55,617
What?

1164
01:15:55,649 --> 01:15:57,251
What, little brother?

1165
01:15:57,284 --> 01:15:58,819
Too much?

1166
01:16:08,762 --> 01:16:11,032
I bet it was a dream.

1167
01:16:11,064 --> 01:16:12,701
And those...

1168
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,704
are dreamed by night...

1169
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,139
or awake.

1170
01:16:18,171 --> 01:16:20,942
I was dreaming I think.

1171
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:24,045
Or cognizant of many things.

1172
01:16:24,078 --> 01:16:26,982
We should skip those.
Only dream.

1173
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,771
Would it not be
incredibly remiss...

1174
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:52,106
if I'd have done sooner
with this crime.

1175
01:17:00,747 --> 01:17:02,617
You come bearing gifts.

1176
01:17:10,123 --> 01:17:12,159
Stay alive and live,
my good man.

1177
01:17:19,466 --> 01:17:21,068
Step in.

1178
01:17:21,101 --> 01:17:22,871
Step in there.

1179
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,739
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

1180
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:27,274
-Shut up.
-Are you kidding me, Dan?

1181
01:17:27,307 --> 01:17:30,045
-Are you serious?
-Lock it up.

1182
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:32,313
I wasn't even there,
I was with these guys...

1183
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:34,682
-Take your medicine, Dane.
-Are you kidding me?

1184
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,152
Take your medicine.

1185
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,821
This is bullshit, Dan!

1186
01:17:39,854 --> 01:17:43,725
For fuck's sake!

1187
01:17:43,757 --> 01:17:45,092
Yo, beluga.

1188
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,195
Sit the fuck down.

1189
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:55,737
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Unlock that door!

1190
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,005
Unlock the gate!

1191
01:17:58,805 --> 01:18:01,009
Alright, come in. Back in
the cell, back in the cell.

1192
01:18:25,466 --> 01:18:26,868
Hey!

1193
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:31,806
-You see the boy?
-What?

1194
01:18:32,806 --> 01:18:34,141
He's hidin'.

1195
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,946
Maybe a neighborhood kiddie.

1196
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,048
I chased him,
but he keeps coming back.

1197
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:47,889
My God! Joseph did you
sleep out here last night?

1198
01:18:49,422 --> 01:18:51,458
Since Wednesday.

1199
01:18:51,492 --> 01:18:54,029
It's Saturday.

1200
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:58,934
Did you see something
that scared you, honey?

1201
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,203
She acts differently lately.

1202
01:19:03,237 --> 01:19:06,108
-It's my fault.
-It's alright.

1203
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,878
Let's get you
cleaned up, honey.

1204
01:19:14,381 --> 01:19:16,518
-No!
-Enough!

1205
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:19,988
Joseph, you stop acting
like this right now!

1206
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:22,323
Jack and Ruddi were released
from jail this morning.

1207
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:27,295
They attacked Ed Hale last week.

1208
01:19:27,328 --> 01:19:29,430
They couldn't hold them
'cause he-he was too afraid

1209
01:19:29,462 --> 01:19:32,300
to tell anybody what happened.

1210
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:35,536
Now, those men are gonna
come after you, Joseph.

1211
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:36,970
And if you're gonna
stay like this

1212
01:19:37,003 --> 01:19:38,806
it's gonna be
really easy for them

1213
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,976
to say that you disappeared
or had an accident.

1214
01:19:42,342 --> 01:19:44,845
So we're gonna go into town...

1215
01:19:44,878 --> 01:19:48,483
and we're gonna leave Bodega
Bay for a couple of weeks.

1216
01:19:48,515 --> 01:19:51,485
We can stay in Redding,
Tom can look after your house.

1217
01:19:53,988 --> 01:19:56,891
-Get up!
-Okay, okay, I'm gonna go.

1218
01:19:56,923 --> 01:19:59,860
I just gotta get inside,
get some stuff.

1219
01:19:59,894 --> 01:20:02,363
I'll meet you at Nickel's
in a... half hour.

1220
01:20:02,395 --> 01:20:04,331
How the hell
are you gonna do that?

1221
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:06,266
You-you've been out here
for almost a week!

1222
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,869
I have to!

1223
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:13,373
Thirty minutes...

1224
01:20:13,407 --> 01:20:16,211
or I'm coming right back
to get you.

1225
01:20:16,243 --> 01:20:17,444
Okay.

1226
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,597
What's up, dog?

1227
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,602
What the fuck
are you guys doing?

1228
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:43,605
Jesus Christ.
You scared the shit out of me.

1229
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:52,980
When did you guys get out?

1230
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:55,048
I was just coming by
to lock up, I was, I was gonna

1231
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:56,651
go hunting up North,
I was gonna check and see

1232
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:59,020
if you guys need anything
before you hit the trail.

1233
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:05,193
Hey, hey. Hey! Come on, no!

1234
01:21:05,225 --> 01:21:06,627
Guys, come on!

1235
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:08,630
Where's Jack? Hey! Where's Jack?

1236
01:21:08,662 --> 01:21:10,464
I wanna straighten things out
with him, okay?

1237
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:12,933
I just wanted to wait for him
to cool down a bit!

1238
01:21:12,966 --> 01:21:14,134
Does he know you guys are here?

1239
01:21:22,643 --> 01:21:25,179
Come on, guys.
Ruddi, knock that off. Please.

1240
01:21:25,212 --> 01:21:26,915
Grab a hammer,
get the shit off my window

1241
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:28,583
and let me out of here!

1242
01:21:34,587 --> 01:21:37,024
Put that...
Put that down. Ruddi!

1243
01:21:37,057 --> 01:21:38,192
Ruddi!

1244
01:21:40,293 --> 01:21:41,962
Come on,
I did my part, alright?

1245
01:21:41,996 --> 01:21:44,097
I kept my secret!

1246
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:46,968
I didn't say anything that he
wouldn't have already heard!

1247
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,503
Ruddi, put that...

1248
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:51,039
Ruddi.

1249
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:52,640
Ru-u-uddi!

1250
01:21:52,672 --> 01:21:54,943
You heartless coward!

1251
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:06,254
Come, let's walk out of here!

1252
01:22:20,067 --> 01:22:21,502
It's me.

1253
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:23,237
It's just me.
Did you hear the truck?

1254
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,473
Looks like there's a big fire
out at Mitch's place.

1255
01:22:25,506 --> 01:22:28,976
Tom just headed out that way.
I don't like this.

1256
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,945
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

1257
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:39,354
It's not everyday the penman
strolls in the town.

1258
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:40,387
It's big deal to people,
Mr. Hale.

1259
01:22:42,355 --> 01:22:45,225
He's a sick man and a recluse.
Do you want his story?

1260
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:46,661
You take him out of here
like you did

1261
01:22:46,694 --> 01:22:49,230
with the Boyle brothers
in Indian country.

1262
01:22:49,262 --> 01:22:51,466
What am I missing?

1263
01:22:51,498 --> 01:22:54,434
Their own family...
could tell them the truth.

1264
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:57,338
It doesn't matter.
He came back, she didn't.

1265
01:23:00,306 --> 01:23:01,509
Glory?

1266
01:23:03,543 --> 01:23:04,746
Glory!

1267
01:23:29,837 --> 01:23:31,239
Glory?

1268
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:40,480
Jesus Christ, Glory!

1269
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,652
Glory?

1270
01:23:52,393 --> 01:23:53,595
Hi.

1271
01:24:00,234 --> 01:24:01,603
It's Jack.

1272
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:12,646
Hi.

1273
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:16,650
Must be a fire?

1274
01:24:18,752 --> 01:24:20,755
I think it's over
at Mitch Captree's house.

1275
01:24:20,787 --> 01:24:23,390
Captree? Is that so?

1276
01:24:23,423 --> 01:24:25,592
They better
get some people up there fast

1277
01:24:25,626 --> 01:24:27,729
before it all
gets scorched?

1278
01:24:30,264 --> 01:24:33,734
Please, don't hurt my dog.

1279
01:24:33,766 --> 01:24:35,836
What?

1280
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:37,771
I would never hurt an animal.

1281
01:24:37,805 --> 01:24:39,507
I love her.

1282
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:41,443
She's my friend.

1283
01:24:43,176 --> 01:24:45,246
She should be inside.

1284
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:48,316
Animals just know, you know?

1285
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:51,284
They're not like us.
They're not like people.

1286
01:24:51,318 --> 01:24:52,820
They don't have
to experience everything

1287
01:24:52,853 --> 01:24:55,690
through pain and suffering.

1288
01:24:55,722 --> 01:24:57,725
Why did you come here?

1289
01:25:00,493 --> 01:25:03,130
I wanted to apologize to you...

1290
01:25:03,163 --> 01:25:04,731
for the other day at Tom's bar.

1291
01:25:04,765 --> 01:25:08,436
I... probably made you feel
a little uneasy.

1292
01:25:09,502 --> 01:25:11,771
Yeah? That wasn't my intention.

1293
01:25:11,805 --> 01:25:14,175
What was your intention?

1294
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:15,576
To send a man to the hospital

1295
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:17,578
just for doing a story
about your family?

1296
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:20,247
I can't control my brother.
I tried!

1297
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,548
I tried, I tried, I tried

1298
01:25:21,582 --> 01:25:24,585
and I tried again!
It doesn't work!

1299
01:25:24,618 --> 01:25:26,254
You know,
Joseph's not the only person

1300
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:28,456
being persecuted
and judged in this town.

1301
01:25:28,488 --> 01:25:31,259
I wasn't even there!

1302
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,362
-You weren't?
-I was not!

1303
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:36,931
So you're not
going after Joseph.

1304
01:25:36,963 --> 01:25:40,135
Why would I?
It won't bring my sister back.

1305
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:44,572
Will it? No.

1306
01:25:44,604 --> 01:25:46,373
No.

1307
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:49,244
I said what I needed to say.
That's it.

1308
01:25:52,246 --> 01:25:55,216
Can I have my dog back, please?

1309
01:25:55,248 --> 01:25:56,850
Of course.

1310
01:25:56,884 --> 01:25:59,252
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

1311
01:25:59,286 --> 01:26:00,855
There you go.

1312
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:04,659
Easy, go easy.

1313
01:26:06,226 --> 01:26:07,327
Thank you.

1314
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,564
-So beautiful.
-Thank you.

1315
01:26:11,664 --> 01:26:13,268
Thank you.

1316
01:26:17,837 --> 01:26:20,307
What, that?

1317
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:22,276
That's just ink and immaturity.

1318
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:24,945
That's nothing,
that's not gonna hurt you.

1319
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:27,448
Come on, I just wanna be
treated equal.

1320
01:26:28,548 --> 01:26:30,417
Just like Joseph.

1321
01:26:32,619 --> 01:26:34,421
Friends?

1322
01:26:34,454 --> 01:26:35,722
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1323
01:26:35,756 --> 01:26:37,458
Okay. Now, come on.

1324
01:26:41,261 --> 01:26:42,996
No!

1325
01:26:45,498 --> 01:26:47,367
Look at this hair.

1326
01:26:48,868 --> 01:26:50,771
You look like her.

1327
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:52,840
Yeah.

1328
01:26:52,872 --> 01:26:54,775
I can see why he likes you.

1329
01:26:56,542 --> 01:26:58,246
Hi, Mr. Hale,
how are you feeling?

1330
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,881
Good. Listen, I need you
to tell me something.

1331
01:27:00,913 --> 01:27:03,483
It's very important.

1332
01:27:03,516 --> 01:27:05,485
When you booked
my room out here...

1333
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:09,023
how did you find
Mitch Captree's place?

1334
01:27:09,055 --> 01:27:12,025
Captree? Um, let me see.

1335
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:14,962
You know what?
He actually contacted us.

1336
01:27:14,994 --> 01:27:16,430
-Mr. Hale?
-You know what, Bill?

1337
01:27:16,462 --> 01:27:17,764
This isn't
rocket science here, okay?

1338
01:27:17,797 --> 01:27:19,867
'Cause anytime
any shit goes down...

1339
01:27:19,899 --> 01:27:21,735
Motherfucker!

1340
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:23,537
Will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

1341
01:27:23,569 --> 01:27:25,438
-Knock it off. Alright.
-What'd you mean, knock it off?

1342
01:27:25,471 --> 01:27:26,773
Don't jump to conclusions.

1343
01:27:26,806 --> 01:27:28,376
Will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

1344
01:27:28,408 --> 01:27:29,777
Don't tell me
that was an accident, Billy!

1345
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,812
Don't jump to the conclusions,
Tom, alright?

1346
01:27:31,845 --> 01:27:33,547
-Let's just stick to the facts!
-What happened?

1347
01:27:33,579 --> 01:27:34,948
It was Ruddi and Dane.

1348
01:27:34,981 --> 01:27:36,516
You fucking let them out?

1349
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:37,818
I couldn't hold them any longer.

1350
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:39,953
You didn't wanna identify them,
Mr. Hale.

1351
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:42,789
Sweetie.

1352
01:27:42,823 --> 01:27:44,359
Over here!

1353
01:27:45,525 --> 01:27:47,694
Hi, Joseph.

1354
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:49,764
Hi, it's me, Annabel?

1355
01:27:49,796 --> 01:27:51,731
Your long lost love.

1356
01:27:51,765 --> 01:27:54,402
I need you to save me.

1357
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,337
Save me from the water.

1358
01:27:56,369 --> 01:27:59,806
Save me from the whales, Joseph.

1359
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,643
-Save me from myself.
-Where is she?

1360
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:04,712
You really wanna know,
you big...

1361
01:28:04,744 --> 01:28:06,947
-Yes.
-Why?

1362
01:28:06,979 --> 01:28:08,515
Why?

1363
01:28:08,548 --> 01:28:11,018
So you can go rescue the girl

1364
01:28:11,051 --> 01:28:13,087
and save the day?

1365
01:28:15,788 --> 01:28:18,725
Are you a fucking idiot?

1366
01:28:18,759 --> 01:28:21,494
You're a fucking idiot.

1367
01:28:21,528 --> 01:28:22,896
Do you know
what Jack is gonna do to you

1368
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,532
when you go down there?

1369
01:28:24,564 --> 01:28:27,033
He's gonna beat you to death

1370
01:28:27,067 --> 01:28:29,770
and leave you face down
in the water.

1371
01:28:30,703 --> 01:28:32,372
Is that what you want?

1372
01:28:32,405 --> 01:28:34,742
Is it? I don't think
that's what you want.

1373
01:28:34,774 --> 01:28:36,076
Stop it! Stop.

1374
01:28:36,109 --> 01:28:38,378
You know what I think
you want, Joseph?

1375
01:28:38,412 --> 01:28:40,414
I think you wanna
stay here with me.

1376
01:28:40,447 --> 01:28:42,717
We can go find
Viagra and back.

1377
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,885
It's gonna be fun.

1378
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:46,886
So much more fun
than you're gonna have.

1379
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,356
-Shut up!
-You're my husband.

1380
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:50,658
Tell me where they took her!

1381
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:52,626
I like it when you get rough.

1382
01:28:52,658 --> 01:28:54,661
I fucking like it!

1383
01:28:54,694 --> 01:28:56,096
Okay.

1384
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,333
Do it the hard way...

1385
01:28:59,099 --> 01:29:00,568
hero.

1386
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:03,069
They...

1387
01:29:03,103 --> 01:29:05,739
are where the lie started.

1388
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:08,109
Where you killed
my best friend.

1389
01:29:08,141 --> 01:29:11,578
I think you know exactly where
that is, don't you, Joseph?

1390
01:29:13,881 --> 01:29:15,083
Dusty.

1391
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,486
You're an ugly person.

1392
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:23,556
Well, lucky for me, Joseph

1393
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:26,025
'cause we know what you do
to the beautiful ones!

1394
01:29:33,699 --> 01:29:36,103
We're on highway three
right up here.

1395
01:29:36,136 --> 01:29:38,740
Know this place like
the back of my hand.

1396
01:29:48,748 --> 01:29:50,818
It-it's a lie, it's a lie!
They set me up.

1397
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,552
They sent me because
it's hard to get out of here.

1398
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:53,587
It's a lie! God!

1399
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:55,488
Get back! Get back!

1400
01:29:55,521 --> 01:29:57,158
-Dane!
-Shut the fuck up, Tom!

1401
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:58,992
You wanna help this asshole?

1402
01:29:59,025 --> 01:30:01,694
Then you're a fucking asshole,
too! You're fucking get me?

1403
01:30:01,728 --> 01:30:03,963
No one gets through
but Hawthorne!

1404
01:30:03,997 --> 01:30:07,635
And you, you fucking silly boy,
pussy, motherfucker!

1405
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:09,170
Did you get the story
you wanted?

1406
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:11,605
Did you get the story
you wanted?

1407
01:30:11,637 --> 01:30:13,841
You're...

1408
01:30:13,873 --> 01:30:15,742
You're right,
it's just so fucked up...

1409
01:30:15,775 --> 01:30:18,578
that you can't even
jerk off, can you?

1410
01:30:18,612 --> 01:30:19,779
My God! I...

1411
01:30:32,826 --> 01:30:34,028
No...

1412
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:37,030
You...

1413
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,632
-Ed?
-Is he alright?

1414
01:30:38,664 --> 01:30:40,467
-I don't know.
-Come on, get him on.

1415
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:42,670
Hey. Here, listen up.

1416
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:44,605
You gotta get to town, okay?
You gotta get the sheriff.

1417
01:30:44,637 --> 01:30:46,774
-Get him out here.
-Okay. Okay. Alright.

1418
01:30:46,806 --> 01:30:48,509
Am I gonna get in trouble
for hitting him like that?

1419
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:49,877
You're fine.
You did the right thing.

1420
01:30:49,909 --> 01:30:52,512
-Go.
-Okay. Okay.

1421
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,148
Ed?

1422
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:58,051
-Did he change, Anne?
-Go!

1423
01:30:58,085 --> 01:30:59,653
-Did he change?
-Get help! Go!

1424
01:30:59,685 --> 01:31:01,154
-Did he change, Anne?
-Hey! Hey! Look at me.

1425
01:31:01,188 --> 01:31:03,157
-Did he change?
-Look at me, not at her!

1426
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:05,225
Look! Can you
get your arms around...

1427
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:06,961
Can you get your arms
around this? Hold this!

1428
01:31:06,993 --> 01:31:09,229
You gotta hold it! Listen. Hey!

1429
01:31:09,262 --> 01:31:11,164
Look at me.
This isn't a game anymore, okay?

1430
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:12,633
-No, no, no, I don't...
-If Ruddi...

1431
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:14,735
-Listen to me!
-I don't want this!

1432
01:31:14,768 --> 01:31:17,238
If Ruddi and Jack come after
you, you gotta drop 'em, okay?

1433
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:19,706
Otherwise, they're gonna
kill you. You understand me?

1434
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:22,242
You gotta go a quarter mile
down this road, you run.

1435
01:31:22,275 --> 01:31:24,211
Lawman's bluff,
below the field, okay?

1436
01:31:24,243 --> 01:31:25,578
You're gonna
cut through the cliffs

1437
01:31:25,612 --> 01:31:26,846
I'm gonna meet you there.
Now, go.

1438
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:44,732
Come out, you fucking coward!

1439
01:31:58,811 --> 01:32:02,082
Where are you,
you fucking pussy?

1440
01:32:02,114 --> 01:32:03,583
Come on!

1441
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:07,154
Hey.

1442
01:32:16,596 --> 01:32:17,998
Help me!

1443
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:22,670
Joseph, please help me!

1444
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:26,606
Come on in! Come get her!

1445
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:31,244
Wait!

1446
01:32:34,213 --> 01:32:36,250
-Sweetie!
-Joseph!

1447
01:32:38,985 --> 01:32:41,855
What's wrong, bro? Come get her!

1448
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:49,630
So cold. She need you!

1449
01:32:50,997 --> 01:32:52,866
Well, I'll help you out.

1450
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:55,935
You bastard!

1451
01:32:55,969 --> 01:32:57,605
Go on ahead.

1452
01:33:02,341 --> 01:33:04,578
I'll make you a deal.

1453
01:33:06,212 --> 01:33:08,314
Be a man...

1454
01:33:08,347 --> 01:33:10,317
and come get her...

1455
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:12,620
and I'll go. Careful.

1456
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,190
Don't let the water
get you, Joseph.

1457
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:21,795
Is that how hard you tried
for Annabel?

1458
01:33:33,739 --> 01:33:34,907
Now there's blood in the water.

1459
01:33:52,926 --> 01:33:54,361
Somebody...

1460
01:33:54,394 --> 01:33:56,030
Somebody help!

1461
01:34:02,301 --> 01:34:05,338
Hi. Come back, bird.

1462
01:34:06,806 --> 01:34:09,443
No, no, no. Come back, bird.

1463
01:34:09,475 --> 01:34:11,077
Back to your cage.

1464
01:34:15,782 --> 01:34:18,686
Hey! Hey!

1465
01:34:23,856 --> 01:34:25,693
Should have known better.

1466
01:34:25,725 --> 01:34:28,094
Should have left, writer man.

1467
01:34:29,996 --> 01:34:31,431
Should have left
when you had the chance.

1468
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:34,134
Help!

1469
01:34:34,167 --> 01:34:36,737
Thought you were
supposed to be smart.

1470
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,939
Where you going?

1471
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:46,313
Help!

1472
01:34:59,059 --> 01:35:01,128
Hey, hey.

1473
01:35:02,929 --> 01:35:04,097
Hey.

1474
01:35:12,805 --> 01:35:14,240
I need you to...

1475
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:17,278
I need you to do me a favor.

1476
01:35:22,414 --> 01:35:24,417
I need you to...

1477
01:35:26,485 --> 01:35:29,288
tell my sister...

1478
01:35:29,322 --> 01:35:31,726
I'm gonna quit drinking
in the spring.

1479
01:35:33,292 --> 01:35:34,494
No!

1480
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,163
I can't have my sister back

1481
01:36:09,195 --> 01:36:10,296
but I can have you.

1482
01:36:10,329 --> 01:36:14,067
Joseph! Please...

1483
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,036
We'll do this together.

1484
01:36:16,069 --> 01:36:18,305
You and me together, right?

1485
01:36:18,337 --> 01:36:20,139
You saw her go...

1486
01:36:20,172 --> 01:36:21,440
now I'm gonna watch you go.

1487
01:36:21,474 --> 01:36:24,244
Please! Stop!

1488
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:29,282
Jack! No!

1489
01:36:29,315 --> 01:36:31,585
Let her take you.
Just let her take you.

1490
01:36:31,618 --> 01:36:34,354
Just let her take you
at the sea like you...

1491
01:36:35,855 --> 01:36:37,023
like you...

1492
01:36:41,127 --> 01:36:43,197
Telling him to fight there,
were you, piece of shit?

1493
01:36:44,997 --> 01:36:47,300
Let's lose the shiv?

1494
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:14,962
Joseph!

1495
01:37:37,082 --> 01:37:39,920
Help! Somebody, help!

1496
01:37:41,287 --> 01:37:43,890
Ed! Ed!

1497
01:37:43,923 --> 01:37:45,458
Shoot him!

1498
01:38:03,275 --> 01:38:05,412
-Wait. Wait. Wait.
-No!

1499
01:38:05,444 --> 01:38:06,679
-Where you...
-No!

1500
01:38:06,712 --> 01:38:08,215
Let him go.

1501
01:38:08,247 --> 01:38:11,018
No!

1502
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:13,553
-Let him go.
-No.

1503
01:38:16,355 --> 01:38:18,391
I've missed you, my friend.

1504
01:38:20,961 --> 01:38:23,063
-Whale.
-Joseph!

1505
01:38:23,095 --> 01:38:25,131
The girl on the boat.

1506
01:38:25,164 --> 01:38:27,333
Your imperishable love.

1507
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:30,069
Tell me.

1508
01:38:31,371 --> 01:38:32,573
Yes.

1509
01:38:47,287 --> 01:38:48,488
Honey!

1510
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,556
Honey, look out there.
Do you see?

1511
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:54,361
This is why we came! Look!

1512
01:39:10,109 --> 01:39:12,179
Hey, honey, how you doing?
You ready?

1513
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:14,481
Come on, we're so close.

1514
01:39:14,514 --> 01:39:16,182
Look, it's why we came out here.
Five more minutes.

1515
01:39:16,216 --> 01:39:18,518
-Five more minutes.
-I'm not, I'm not standing up.

1516
01:39:18,551 --> 01:39:21,488
Will you look at how amazingly
close we are. Look.

1517
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,457
Do you see them?
We've never been this close.

1518
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:26,326
Come on, honey.
Just walk up with me.

1519
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:28,996
You can hold me the whole time.
I got you. I got you, I swear.

1520
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:32,065
-I just not...
-Last request, please.

1521
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:33,533
Come on, look who...

1522
01:39:33,565 --> 01:39:35,469
You're gonna love it. Come on.

1523
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:38,672
-Hurry!
-Just, just be careful, okay?

1524
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:43,476
Look! Look out there.

1525
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:45,546
There are three of them.

1526
01:39:49,114 --> 01:39:52,351
-It's amazing!
-Yeah.

1527
01:39:52,385 --> 01:39:53,753
Have you ever seen a whale
that close before?

1528
01:39:53,787 --> 01:39:55,489
No, no, no.

1529
01:39:55,521 --> 01:39:57,024
Hey, don't. N-not over...

1530
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:59,626
Well, they're coming
right towards us.

1531
01:39:59,658 --> 01:40:01,795
My God!

1532
01:40:01,828 --> 01:40:03,597
Look at that.

1533
01:40:06,533 --> 01:40:09,136
You can almost touch them.

1534
01:40:12,171 --> 01:40:13,406
Be careful!

1535
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:16,208
I'm fine, honey.
Just hold on to me.

1536
01:40:16,242 --> 01:40:18,345
I know you like it, baby,
but you gotta be careful.

1537
01:40:18,377 --> 01:40:19,813
I'm not gonna fall.
You've got me, don't you?

1538
01:40:19,845 --> 01:40:21,280
-Yes.
-And you got the boat.

1539
01:40:21,314 --> 01:40:22,783
-We're gonna be fine.
-Okay, okay.

1540
01:40:22,815 --> 01:40:24,251
Okay, look.

1541
01:41:31,283 --> 01:41:33,487
I didn't kill my wife!

1542
01:42:17,396 --> 01:42:19,832
Annabel!

1543
01:42:23,403 --> 01:42:24,838
I love you!

1544
01:42:35,981 --> 01:42:38,752
You're ready to swim with me,
my friend.
