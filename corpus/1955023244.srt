Look at me. OK.
I'm right here, OK?

I'm not gonna leave.
I'm sorry.

Damn it. Shut the... Really?
God.

36
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,183
Told you to get rid
of that fucking thing.

37
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,319
Knock again, Webster.
I know he's in there.
I can smell him.

38
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,187
You know the drill.
[pounding]

39
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,856
Go! I got your back.

40
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:29,857
That's why
you're my bitch.

41
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,360
Heh.
Will you fuck me later?

42
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,130
What the fuck's
your problem?

43
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:37,131
Parole. Where's Kapone?

44
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,866
He isn't here,
you fucking bitch.

45
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,468
He's running!
Get out of my way.

00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,217
We almost had him.

57
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,187
Never had anybody
get away from me
like that, nobody.

58
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,190
Used to be a track star.

59
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,358
He straight
outran your ass, man.

60
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,461
Fucking little Mexican
can run, huh?

61
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,231
What I tell you
about profanity
on the job, huh?

62
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,099
Keep it clean.

63
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,002
Sorry. It's a fucking habit,
all right?

64
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,394
Yo!

65
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,162
Yo, homey!

66
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,298
Hey!

67
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,732
Yo, what's your
fucking trip, fool?

68
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,302
Ha ha!
Yo, relax, little homey.

69
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,270
Had to make a quick exit.

70
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,272
From the cops?
Yeah, my dawg.

71
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,240
Yeah, those two knuckleheads
are my P.O.s.

72
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:28,342
They're trying
to take me back to do
a little stretch, dawggie.

73
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,177
I got your back
on this one, though.

74
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,178
Good looking, man.

75
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,513
Yo, you coming back
later?

76
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,081
Do a little
something-something
with my sister?

77
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,284
Tcch. What you know
about me and Baby Girl?

78
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,418
I can't help it.
All night,

79
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,820
I hear through
the damn wall,
"Oh, Kapone.

80
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:43,123
Fuck me good, papi.
Fuck me good."

81
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,358
Yeah, you shouldn't be
listening to that shit.

82
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,393
What are you,
a little pervert or what?

83
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:46,527
Yo, dawg, I got
plenty of bitches, too.

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,895
Hey, dawg.

85
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,298
Hey, don't call women bitches.
They don't like that shit.

86
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,600
All right,
point is I know how
to treat my women.

87
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,302
All right, all right.
Hey, well, peep this.

88
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,669
Don't tell anybody
you saw me.

89
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,405
I'm trying to keep
a low pro, all right?
[cell phone ringing]

90
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,439
Yo, like I said,
I got your back,
big dawg.

91
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,241
Good, good. Shit.
What now?

92
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,210
It's my P.O.
I'm gonna ignore his ass

93
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,413
Till I'm ready
to negotiate my freedom.

94
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,847
Hey, tell your sister
I'll be by later.

95
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,882
Yo, for sure.
I'll let her know.
All right?

96
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,969
Pacheco.

97
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,103
Who's this?

98
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,238
Who do you
think this is?

99
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
This is Ardmore.

100
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,809
I want you
to turn yourself in.

101
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,211
I ain't going
back to the joint,

102
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,947
Not right now.

103
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,881
Well, you should
have thought of that

104
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,550
Before you missed
3 meetings with me.

105
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,518
That's a direct
parole violation.

106
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,153
Mmm...

107
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,556
I've been busy.

108
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,223
Give me a break
on this one, Ardmore.

109
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,825
I don't give breaks,
Pacheco.

110
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,827
You know that.

111
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,363
Rules are rules.

112
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:59,600
Yeah, OK.

113
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,669
Fuck your rules.

114
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,671
Pacheco?

115
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,238
H-Hello?

116
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,211
Hang up on me.
Heh.

117
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,880
He's around here
somewhere.

118
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,081
Can you feel it?

119
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,884
Not really, but, hey,
knock yourself out.

120
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,886
He might be clever,

121
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,120
But I'm smarter.

122
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,955
Let's go.

123
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,218
Oh, shit. Hey,
what's up, big dawg?

124
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,220
Ah, shit. Get the fuck
out of my way, Georgie.

125
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,122
Hey, you got
a knickknack
on my sac, homey?

126
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,757
You fucked up, man?
What's the matter

127
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,025
With you, man?
I'm in a hurry.

128
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,059
Why you fucking
tripping, dawg?

129
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,193
Don't play me
like a bitch.

130
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,929
5-ball is all
I'm looking for.

131
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,898
I got Ardmore on my ass, man.
What'd I just say?

132
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,901
You're fucked.
I hate fucking Ardmore.
He's a fucking bitch.

133
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,903
Exactly, so I gotta
get the fuck out of here.

134
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,739
Nah, nah, but trip out,
homey. Hey.

135
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,907
Let me get some, dawg.
Break me off before
you roll, player.

136
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,909
Dawg, you keep
your fucking hands
off of me, all right?

137
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,110
Hey, come on, man.
We're boys, dawg.

138
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,479
Hey, man,
what'd I just say, man?

139
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,413
Man, can't you see
I'm hurting?

140
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:20,781
Yeah, you hurting
'cause you a dope fiend.

141
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,416
That's on you, not me.
I'm out.

142
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,784
Man, don't fucking
judge me.

143
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,953
You ain't shit, Kapone.

144
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,088
Motherfucker,
you gonna learn, bitch.

145
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,159
You'll get yours,
motherfucker.

146
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,539
[Winces]

147
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,308
I had a feeling
I was going to be
tested today.

148
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,710
What happened
to all this big talk

149
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,412
About we're gonna get him
by the end of the day?

150
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,348
Tested doesn't mean
defeated, Webster.

151
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,317
We'll see about that.

152
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,487
You're forgetting
I haven't lost one yet.

153
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,688
Well, if you ask me...

154
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,023
I didn't ask you.

155
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,493
I will have
Pacheco in custody
by the end of the day.

156
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,794
That's guaranteed.

157
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,398
[Dog barks]

158
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,911
[Dogs barking]

159
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:34,522
Hey, who the fuck is that?

160
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,223
No one.
What the fuck?
It's me.

161
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,091
Kapone?
Yeah, dawg.

162
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,527
Ah, shit.
My bad, homey.

163
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,428
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

164
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,496
Fuck, homey, I just...

165
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,298
I been up for,
like, 3 days, dawg.

166
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,734
Just spun
like a motherfucker.

167
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:47,935
You're tripping hard,
dawg.

168
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,738
Yeah, my bad, homey.
Fucking... You want
to take a blast?

169
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,673
Nah, dawg. I don't do...
I don't do that shit.

170
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,775
Fucking-A. Hey, man,

171
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,409
There's somebody
after me, homey.

172
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,545
Who?
I don't know, homey.

173
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,312
I... I been seeing him
a lot, eh.

174
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,214
I don't know who the fuck
it is, though.

175
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,083
Marcos,
it's in your head, man.
Nobody's following you.

176
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,518
All right, man. I'm out.
Fuck. Hey, homey, homey.

177
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:05,753
Hold on. Hey.
Hey, you don't want

178
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,187
To just chill
and kick it for a...

179
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,355
I'm gonna take
a quick hit, fool.

180
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,289
Nah, dawg.
I got my P.O. after me.

181
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,490
I gotta get the fuck
out of here.

182
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,491
Come on, homey.
Hey, man...

183
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,460
Stop that shit.
Fucking ranker.

184
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:17,798
How are you, huh,
little boy?

185
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,932
Want this football?
Yeah.

186
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,233
Yeah, take it.
Come on.

187
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,969
There's your mommy
right there. How are you?

188
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,236
Oh, now you
decide to show up.

189
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,838
Huh?
Where you been?

190
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,239
Hey, relax, Marisela.
Don't start with me.

191
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,507
I was with my homeboys.

192
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,842
All fucking night?

193
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,077
That's bullshit.
You were probably

194
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,045
With your
damn tramp,
fucking Baby Girl.

195
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm not stupid.
Hey, relax.

196
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,982
She's just a friend,
all right?

197
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,116
You're gonna
make Junior cry.

198
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,150
[Coos]

199
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,253
[Dog barking]

200
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,874
Hello? Excuse me.

201
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,342
Yeah, now what's up,
motherfucker?

202
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,944
Do you know
this address?

203
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,966
[Exhales]

204
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,301
Oh, snap.
Fucking Marcos.

205
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,210
Freeze!

206
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,245
WEBSTER:
Fucking hands up now!

207
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,813
ARDMORE:
Don't move, Georgie!

208
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,950
Let's get over here
to the car.

209
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,584
I-I didn't shoot
that bitch, homey.

210
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,585
[Speaking Spanish]

211
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,586
Get on the car.

212
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,856
Put your hands
on the car.

213
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,590
Slowly.

214
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,359
Nice and easy,
Georgie.

215
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,131
What woman are you
talking about,
Georgie?

216
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,267
That bitch laying
back behind that car
over there.

217
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,002
Yeah?
What happened
to her?

218
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,138
I don't know.
I just ran up
on this shit, man.

219
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,107
Yeah? You get it?

220
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,109
I'm gonna go
check this out.

221
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,111
Got any weapons
on you, Georgie?

222
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,312
Nah. Hell, nah.

223
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,314
Nothing sharp
in your pockets?

224
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,716
Nope.

225
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,750
You know
your parole officer
came through

226
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:17,517
Looking for you
earlier?

227
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,219
Go play, baby.

228
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,854
Yeah, I know.

229
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,223
They want me
to turn myself in.

230
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,925
Again?

231
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,194
When are you gonna
learn you're not
a little boy anymore?

232
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,461
Why?
Don't you think I know that?

233
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,897
No, I don't
think you do.

234
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,131
You're in and out
of jail all the time.

235
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,166
I'm done with this shit.
I'm tired.

236
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,004
It's fucking hard
out there, all right?

237
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,039
And I'm trying.

238
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,774
Not hard enough.

239
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,877
Are you gonna
turn yourself in?

240
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,446
Eventually,
when I'm ready.

241
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,016
Yeah, you're good
with your damn
cat-and-mouse games.

242
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,419
[Sighs]
I'm fucking over
this shit already.

243
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,758
Listen, I got
a lot of stuff I gotta
take care of right now,

244
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,492
Real important shit.

245
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,495
It's just not the time
for me to turn myself in,

246
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,533
So right now I just...
I just need you
to have my back, OK?

247
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,571
No. You know what? No.

248
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,506
Get out! Leave, OK?

249
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,708
I don't need
fucking cops coming in

250
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,944
And waking my son up
in the middle
of the night, OK?

251
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,779
I have a son to raise.

252
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,148
Oh, what, and I don't?

253
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,650
Just leave.
Just leave
before my mom comes.

254
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,252
She doesn't want you
here anymore.
Oh, it's like that?

255
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,754
Yeah,
it's like that.

256
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:27,955
Get used to it.

257
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,233
Is it bad?

258
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,403
Not good. Dead woman.

259
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,805
This isn't
a good situation,
Zambrano.

260
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:45,806
I didn't do shit.

261
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,207
I'm gonna call this in.

262
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,241
Wait a minute.

263
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,178
OK, Georgie...

264
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,514
What'd you see?

265
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,817
I didn't see shit.
I just ran up
on this shit.

266
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,786
I didn't even
have a fucking gun.

267
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,788
Yeah, yeah.
I got that part
already.

268
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,489
I want to know
the nitty-gritty,

269
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,524
The juicy part.

270
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,793
I want to know
what you saw.

271
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:06,960
I know
you saw something.

272
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:10,063
I didn't see shit. No.

273
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,965
No, huh?
Nah.

274
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,034
You're not giving me
the truth here, Georgie.

275
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,104
You know I only operate
from truth, pure truth.

276
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,772
And I ain't lying.

277
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,573
I'm telling you the truth.

278
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,544
Let me see your eyes.

279
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,813
I said let me
see your eyes.
Let me see your eyes.

280
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,681
Man, quit trying to do
that fucking voodoo shit
on me, dawg.

281
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:32,419
[Breathes deeply] No.

282
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,088
See?
Truth is in there.

283
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,957
I could see it.

284
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,491
You need to release it
to me, Georgie.

285
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,194
Man, fuck you, man.
You'll feel a lot better.

286
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,836
Give me a name,
I'll let you walk.

287
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:49,970
Just like that?

288
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,872
Yeah, just like that.

289
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,541
And you ain't
gonna violate my parole?

290
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,709
For what?

291
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,545
You didn't do this,
right?

292
00:12:59,079 --> 00:12:59,779
Hell, no.

293
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,781
Nah.
Nope.

294
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,183
It's greater good here.

295
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,784
You know
what I'm saying?

296
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,920
Believe in
the greater good,
don't you?

297
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,823
Yeah. Yeah, I believe
in the greater good.

298
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,692
That's what I thought.

299
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,697
Why don't you
call this in now?

300
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,973
Ahh. Hey, quit yanking
on my shit, man.

301
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,540
Quiet, sir.
What the fuck, man?

302
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,676
Ahh! Gotta make things
fucking hurt?

303
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,878
Hold on. Hold on.

304
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,579
Shit!

305
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,780
Man, it's...

306
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:37,951
I'm gonna fucking
get a lawyer.

307
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,619
I'm gonna sue
you guys, eh?

308
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,812
Yo, dawg.
It's cool?

309

Hollywood,
I've known you
for a long time,

310

And you know I don't
cosign for anyone.

311
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:20,793
I just want it
to be clear

312
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,896
That if you get
this opportunity,

313
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,731
There's
no turning back.

314
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,966
You know that, right?

315
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:26,967
Heh.

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,536
I know.

317
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,905
What the fuck
do you think you know?

318
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,606
'Cause you
don't know shit.

319
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,776
Get those
fucking gloves
off my table.

320
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,614
What you should know

321
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,051
Is that if you
fuck this shit up,

322
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,752
I'll send for you.

323
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,323
So make sure you
don't regret this day.

324
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,324
Is that clear?

325
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,060
Loud and clear.

326
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,631
Familia, we got
a good deal on the table.

327
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,033
Good family involved.

328
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,034
Good for us.

329
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,769
You guys know the deal.

330
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,938
I already ran it
by you all,

331
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,906
And I say we do it.

332
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,641
Yea? Nay?

333
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,010
How many yeas?

334
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,344
Say yea.
Yea.
Yea.

335
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,345
Yea.
Yea.

336
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,613
Sure.
Let's do it.

337
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,681
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

340
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,760
Hey, how'd
the cops know it was
my little brother, huh?

341
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,629
Someone dropped a dime,
homey.

342
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,331
Got a snitch.

343
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,133
Well, you gotta
find out what's up.

344
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,801
I'm on it, homey.

345

'Cause I'll tell you
straight out, dawg.

346

We got a snitch,
we gotta take him out.

347
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,709
We got a snitch,

Hey, we would have heard
if anyone was talking.

349
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,081
[Speaking Spanish]

350
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,049
You know what, homey?
Nobody in our hood's

351
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,984
Gonna be talking
to the placa, ¿no?

352
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,919
[Deep breath]

353
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,754
You call yourself O.G.?

354
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,857
You guys don't know shit.

355
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,628
You better fucking show me
something real soon, homey,

356
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,664
'Cause right now,
you guys make me
fucking sick.

357
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,732
You know what,
homey?

358
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,067
My primo was
in the alley

359
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,868
When the coroner
picked up the body.

360
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:09,969
Maybe he
saw something.

361
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,638
We should
go ask him.

362
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,040
Orale.

363
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,510
All right.

364
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,112
And when you do,
let's find that vato

365
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,880
And take him out.
[speaking Spanish]

366
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,451
Yeah. That's what
I'm talking about.

367
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,465
What's up, dude?

368
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,633
What's up?

369
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,541
Looks great.

370
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,875
All right, dawg.

371
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,834
Hey, hold up. Hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

372
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,769
What's up, Ghost?

373
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,870
Your cousin Eddie Boy
told me you were

374
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,572
In the alley when they
smoked that bitch.

375
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,541
Yeah, blood everywhere.
Shit was nasty.

376
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,875
You see anyone
talking to the cops?

377
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,943
Not really.
Everybody around here

378
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,511
Knows better
than to do that.

379
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,512
You sure about that?

380
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,680
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

381
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,149
I mean,
Georgie was there,

382
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,916
But his P.O. had him
and then let him go.

383
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,585
Georgie.
Yeah, that fool's

384
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,819
Always in the alley
shooting it up.

385
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,192
All right,
little homey.
You did good.

386
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,427
Get the fuck
out of here.

387
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,763
What the fuck's
your problem, dawg?

388
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,599
Shut the fuck up.

389
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,235
Hey, homey, what
do you know about
my little brother?

390
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,937
I don't know shit
about Marcos, man.

391
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,706
Hmm.
Why you asking me?

392
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:00,807
Because my little
brother's sitting

393
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,675
In a jail cell
right now, dawg.

394
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,544
Some little motherfucker
ratted his ass out.

395
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,778
That's why
I'm asking you.

396
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,113
I'm one of the O.G.s
from this clique,

397
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,648
And you know that.

398
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:12,285
You ain't nothing
but a dope fiend
to me, ese.

399
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,921
Hey, dawg, don't...
don't fuck around
like that.

400
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,257
Y-You know
I wouldn't do that shit.

401
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,758
Let me blast
this bitch.

402
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,827
Hey, Ghost,
hold up, man.
Let him talk.

403
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,297
Wait up.
You know what?

404
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,632
I know who did it.

405
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,268
Hey, little brother.

406
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,069
Hey, what's up?

407
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,604
Yeah, what's up?

408
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:32,872
Get me out of here.

409
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,841
Yeah, don't worry
about it, all right?

410
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,876
Gonna get you a lawyer
and hook you up,

411
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,312
But I gotta ask you
a question.

412
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,981
Did you see, uh,
Georgie or Kapone today?

413
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,351
I just saw Kapone, eh?
I only saw Kapone.

414
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,386
Ah. OK.

415
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,822
Well,
check it out, homes.

416
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,091
You know not to say
anything inside,
all right?

417
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,026
Yeah, don't tell them
who does nothing.

418
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,228
I won't say shit
in here.

419
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,897
All right.
All right, man.

420
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,699
You stay strong,
all right?

421
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,301
All right. Later.

422
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,735
Al rato.

423
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,946
So what's up,
homey? We letting
this fucker go or what?

424
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,815
Nah, not yet.

425
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,817
What happened?

426
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,787
Well, Marcos said
that Kapone was around.

427
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,890
I don't think Kapone's
about that, homes.

428
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,125
[Scoffs]
People get desperate

429
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,960
When they're
facing time, homey.

430
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,829
Kapone just buckled,
dawg.

431
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,132
He's a peewee.
[laughs]

432
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,634
[Chuckles]

433
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,503
I tell you what.
I'll be right back,

434
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,905
But for now,
you keep an eye
on him, all right?

435
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,307
* Oh, shit, I only
got 9 hours left... *

436
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,208
"Peewee." Heh.

437
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,175
* ...to see my kids

438
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,611
* And hopefully
with no drama *

439
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,212
* 'Cause she's a bitch
* Fucking bitch

440
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,213
* Damn, we started arguing

441
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
* Fuck
* Fuck

442
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,649
* I only got 6 hours left

443
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,384
* So I hugged the kids,
Angel and Bams *

444
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,652
* Told 'em to be strong

445
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,288
* And to be more than I was
and that I am *

446
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,689
* And to always
take care of their mom *

447
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,392
* Even if they resent her
for doing their dad wrong *

448
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,427
* Oh, shit...

449
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,494
What's up, Rudy?

450
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:02,662
What's up, Crow?

451
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,331
I'm looking
for Kapone, ese.

452
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,633
He ain't around right now.
Come on, now.

453
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,436
I know he comes around
to visit your sister.

454
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,071
All right.
He actually told me
not to say shit,

455
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,073
But I think
he meant the cops.

456
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,342
You one of the homeys,
so you cool, right?

457
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,009
Yeah, you're good,
homey. What's up?

458
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,446
He's on the run right now,

459
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,747
Something about his parole

460
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,515
Hitting up his cellphone
to negotiate his freedom.

461
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,852
[Chuckles]
Is that right?

462
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:26,786
You positive
about that?

463
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,287
Yeah, I'm positive.

464
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,157
OK.

465
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,493
All right.
* ...all this gangster
in me to give *

466
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,329
* I got so much gangster
to give *

467
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,064
* With only 13 hours
to live *

468
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,299
* Roll up and get
my brother Smiley *

469
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,669
* 'Cause you know I gotta
have him right beside me *

470
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:43,803
* We're Heckle
and Jeckle... *

471
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,373
Get the fuck
out of here, man.

472
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,374
Go. Get up.

473
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,375
I told
you fuckers...

474
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,776
Get the fuck
out of here, eh!

475
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,446
What's up, homey?

476
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,581
Kapone's the rat, ese.

477
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,048
I found out
from Little Rudy.

478
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,784
But Rudy's a kid, homey.
You trust him?

479
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,218
Yeah, I don't
give a fuck, man.

480
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,120
He's not
gonna lie to me.
I'm telling you.

481
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,522
Kapone's name
keeps coming up, homey,

482
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,524
So it's up to you,
big dawg.

483
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:08,294
All right, we're gonna
bring in Sick and Blind
on this one.

484
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,796
I don't know, homey.
Think they're soft.

485
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,032
That's all right, ese.
It's time for them
to put in some work.

486
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,624
WOMAN: Hey, you hear
about the party
on the weekend?

487
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,158
Who, Maria's?
Yeah, that bitch.

488
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,428
Fuck Maria.
You know what she did?

489
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,396
She tried hollering
at my man Carlos.

490
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,164
She gets
at every fine dick.

491
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,166
Do you know what she did
to Jennifer, though?

492
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,035
Who? What'd she do?
She fucked her man.

493
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,370
[Scoffs] I believe it.
That fucking bitch.
I swear to God, I...

494
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,972
Uhh! I wish
I could have her...

495
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,741
Like fucking choke
her ass, but I can't.

496
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,644
You'll get
your taste of dick
around here.

497
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,311
I know.
Fucking dick lover.

498
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,513
You know
how she is already.

499
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,248
Slut.
[laughs]

500
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,683
I know.

501
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,217
Let's get some beer.

502
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,119
Hey, there's Kapone.

503
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,588
What the fuck is
that little bitch
doing here?

504
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,622
Fucking rat.
Let's get him.

505
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:10,890
Fuck this bitch.
What's up?

506
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,592
Bitch, I heard
you snitched.

507
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,593
Yeah, you fucking bitch.
Yeah.

508
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,627
Heard you're
a fucking snitch
on the street.

509
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,328
You should get
the fuck out of here.

510
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,664
What the fuck are you crazy
bitches talking about?

511
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,032
You know what
we're talking about.
Get the fuck out of here!

512
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,202
Get that
motherfucker!

513
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,237
[Dog barking]

514
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,445
What's up, Crow?

515
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:35,114
What's up is I need you
to put in some work,
eh, the both of you.

516
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,248
What's up, dawg?

517
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,518
Kapone, eh,
he ratted out Marcos.

518
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,152
Man, that's fucked up,
homey.

519
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,854
What you want us to do?

520
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,122
I want you
to take him out, homes.

521
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,557
It's as simple
as that, all right?

522
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,826
Man, you want us
to take out
our own homeboy?

523
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,728
Kapone's making us
look weak,

524
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,997
And we ain't weak.
Hell, nah.

525
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,299
We gotta
do something
strong, dawg.

526
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,268
Now, you two are
the motherfuckers
I want on it, all right?

527
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:59,939
Hey, homeys,
you already know, dawg,
I'm down for the hood.

528
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:00,973
That's what's up.

529
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,242
What about you, Blind?
You in?

530
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,077
Man, you sure
Kapone's a rata?

531
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,314
Yeah.
I checked it out myself.

532
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,021
Yeah. I'm in.

533
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,760
What the fuck
you still doing here?

534
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,929
Get the hell out of here.
Let's roll, eh?

535
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:36,743
Thanks, babe.

536
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:55,061
Hey, papi.

537
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,029
[Sighs]
You don't have to buy
groceries for me, hija.

538
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,598
I can shop for myself.

539
00:24:58,631 --> 00:24:59,766
Cup O' Noodles
at the liquor store's

540
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,433
Not really
buying groceries.

541
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:05,738
I'm just saying
I can take care
of myself.

542
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:09,609
Dad, I like
to take care of you.

543
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,612
[Kisses] OK?

544
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,081
[Sighs]

545
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,153
You still seeing him?

546
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,556
Daddy, don't start.

547
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,560
I told you he ain't
the guy for you.

548
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,195
I love him, papi.
He loves me.

549
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,029
That's all that matters.

550
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,164
That's what you think.

551
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,633
Daddy, you know,
you forget that...

552
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,569
That Mom wasn't
the person you thought
she was either.

553
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,605
That was different.
No.

554
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,640
It was the carga
that made her
act that way.

555
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:43,509
No. Stop making excuses
for her.

556
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:46,879
She made us both suffer.

557
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,347
That's the point.

558
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,516
I don't want you
to suffer.

559
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,685
Dad, what's so bad
about Ghost?

560
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,521
Mija,

561
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,390
He's not the man
you think he is.

562
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,326
Well, you know,

563
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,261
We've all done bad things.

564
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,133
Right, Dad?

565
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,070
Hey, fool...
What's up?

566
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,172
Check this shit out,
dawg.

567
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,373
Oh, whose is that?

568
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,541
It's my cousin
Crow's gun, dawg.

569
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,643
He gots lots of 'em.

570
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:17,877
I can get it
anytime I want, fool.

571
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,345
Let me hold it,
Fernie.

572
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,379
Handle that.

573
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,583
Bah! Bah!

574
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,653
Heh heh.
It's fucking bad, dawg.

575
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:27,987
I wish I had
one of these, though.

576
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,722
Hey, whenever you want
to borrow it, fool,

577
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,990
Just let me know, dawg.
For sure?

578
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,659
Yeah, yeah, fool.
Heater me, dawg.

579
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,393
Man, what the fuck
are you gonna
do with that?

580
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,194
What the fuck you think
I'm gonna do with it?

581
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,295
I'm gonna blast someone
with it.

582
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,030
You ain't got the balls
to do that, homes.

583
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,799
What?!
You heard me, dawg.

584
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,100
I don't have
the what?

585
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,702
Hey, homey, hey,
keep the fuck
back, homey.

586
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:45,104
Hey, man...
I don't give a fuck.

587
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,405
I'll blow this bitch away.
Hey, keep back.

588
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,841
Kick it, eh?
Dare me.

589
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,409
Go ahead.
Dare me, homeboy.

590
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,444
Bah!

591
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,714
Punk bitch.

592
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:00,787
Hey, dawg.

593
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,055
I heard Kapone snitched
on one of the homeboys,
fool.

594
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:03,923
He wouldn't do that
to his own, fool.

595
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,391
Shut the fuck up
before I slap you, dawg.

596
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,226
Hey, fool,
I heard Crow telling
the other homeboys

597
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,427
He gave up Marcos, fool.

598
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,962
That's some straight-up
bullshit, dawg.

599
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,499
I don't believe that.
Hey, fool, they want
his ass dead, dawg.

600
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,567
Straight-up bullshit, dawg.
I'm gonna go ahead.

601
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,469
I'm telling you
what the homeys
told me, fool.

602
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:18,504
You heard wrong, dawg.

603
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:19,972
FERNIE:
Where you going, dawg?

604
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:24,310
Just kick back, fool.
Yo, fuck the both of you.
I'm out of here, eh.

605
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,745
Hey, that's
one crazy vato, eh?

606
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,714
Almost pissed
my fucking pants,
homeboy.

607
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,015
You're a fool, dawg.

608
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,355
[Dogs barking]

609
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,062
Man, this shit don't
feel right to me, ese.

610
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,630
Kapone ain't a rat.
I just know it.

611
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,632
He's always been
a straight-up vato with me.

612
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,835
No wonder why they
call your ass Blind.

613
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,303
Man,
I'm just saying, raza,

614
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,672
One day,
you're a fucking hero,

615
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,008
And the next,
you're a rata.

616
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,610
That shit don't make
no fucking sense to me.

617
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,646
Don't even need
to make sense.

618
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,315
¿Qué no?

619
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,385
Kapone.

620
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,720
Kapone.

621
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:43,622
What's up with you, dawg?

622
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:44,891
Damn crazy bitches
just tried

623
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,625
To rush me
at the liquor store.

624
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,627
I thought you said
not to call girls bitches.

625
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,029
Nah, trust me,
these bitches
were bitches.

626
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,298
Yo, I'm looking for you.
They're after you, man.

627
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,699
They say you're a rat.

628
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,567
Wait. A rat?
Who said that?

629
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,969
Fernie.
He was ear hustling,

630
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:59,105
Overheard his cousin Crow
talking about you,

631
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,340
That you gave Marcos up
to the cops.

632
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,309
What the fuck is
happening around here?

633
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:06,612
Didn't you hear?
Marcos shot up the lady
in the morning.

634
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,915
See, I knew that fucker
was gonna flip out.

635
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,950
Y-Yo, you ain't no rat,
though, right?

636
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,886
Nah. Course not.

637
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,687
All right. I got you.

638
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,361
Pull over at this house.

639
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,663
Pacheco sometimes
hangs out here.

640
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,372
This should be fun.

641
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:37,844
Um, Webster, wait.

642
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:40,179
Take off
your safety.

643
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,886
[Car door closes]

644
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,020
[Car door closes]

645
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,991
What's up, pig?
You sure you want

646
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,160
To roll up
in here like that?

647
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:57,229
[Sighs] We're
looking for Kapone.

648
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:58,330
Kapone who?

649
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,166
One of
your homeboys.

650
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,633
He ain't one
of our homeboys.

651
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,969
So you haven't seen him?

652
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:05,004
Hey, we're looking
for him, too, ese.

653
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,408
Well, if you find him,

654
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,111
Tell him to turn
himself in to Parole.

655
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,446
I don't think
he's gonna be around
much longer.

656
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,048
What do you
mean by that?

657
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:18,084
You know what time
it is, pig,

658
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,518
So if you ain't gonna
take nobody to jail,

659
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,087
Why don't you get
the fuck out of here?

660
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,721
You guys have
a nice day.

661
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,856
Yeah, fuck you, too.

662
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,024
Yeah, yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.

663
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,192
We said
get the fuck
out of here.

664
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,193
Hey,
you could stay.

665
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,660
Why come
around here for?

666
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:29,862
Yeah, you could stay.
Come here.

667
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:31,030
What the fuck?

668
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,973
Something's
not right here.

669
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,876
They definitely
had something
against Kapone.

670
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,577
What do you think?

671
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,513
I don't know.

672
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,748
But I bet you
our boy Georgie has
something to do with this.

673

Heh. That guy would
give up his own mother.

00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,153
You know it.

00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,188

He got away.

out of here.

dawg.

like a library book.

865
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,264
Heh.
You're a funny guy.

866
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,899
Yeah, I try.

867
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,868
I told you I was gonna
catch you, didn't I?

868
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,869
That's cool. It's cool.

869
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,737
I understand. Yeah.

870
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,873
Hey, but before you
throw me in the car,

871
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,040
You want to hear a joke?

872
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,111
[Chuckles]

873
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,083
All right.
Go for it.

874
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,085
Better be funny.

875
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:23,989
The circus elephant

876
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,991
Is bothering
a group of ants,

877
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,760
So the ants climb
on the elephant's back

878
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,929
And begin biting him
to death.

879
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,331
The elephant gets pissed,

880
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:36,301
And he tosses off
all the little ants,

881
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:37,803
Except for one.

882
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:40,572
This one poor
little, tiny ant

883
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:43,875
Manages to grab on
to the elephant's throat.

884
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,645
He looks down
at the other little ants,

885
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,914
And they're all
yelling at him,

886
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,717
"Jump! Jump!
Don't do it!"

887
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,919
And this poor
little, tiny ant says,

888
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,022
"Nah, I think
I can choke him to death."

889
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,558
Heh.

890
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,094
"Choke him to death."

891
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,697
[Sighs] Oh, I get it.

892
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:07,065
Little ant,
big elephant.

893
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,667
Yeah.

894
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,636
It's actually
quite humorous, Pacheco.

895
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:11,670
Yeah.

896
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,606
Yeah, you know what else
is humorous?

897
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,675
What's that?

898
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,612
What the fuck?

899
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,749
Pacheco!

900
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:24,783
Why...

901
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,361
This is your fault.
Hey, I didn't know

902
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:38,163
We were dealing with
gangster Houdini here.

903
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,699
Come on, Webster.
Take some responsibility.

904
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:43,669
If you would have
just secured his cuffs
like I told you to,

905
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,036
We'd have him
in custody by now.

906
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,104
I did secure 'em.

907
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,673
He squeezed
right through them.

908
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:48,807
Because you're incompetent.

909
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,842
Hey, come on, man.
Stop worrying about

910
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:53,679
Your stupid perfect
fucking record.

911
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,647
I take my job seriously.

912
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:56,848
Maybe you should, too.

913
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,117
Who the fuck do you
think you are?

914
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,052
You're just some
sorry-ass parole officer

915
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,788
That thinks
he's perfect.

916
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,389
Get out of my face,
Webster.

917
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:05,857
Or else what?

918
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,726
You gonna
write me up?

919
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:08,994
Do it.

920
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:20,872
What do you want?

921
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:22,440
Marisela,
I need your help.

922
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,776
I already told you
just leave me alone.

923
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,044
Listen to me.

924
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,146
Everybody's
after me.

925
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,915
Who's after you?

926
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,182
Everybody.
My homeboys,

927
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,718
The neighborhood,
everybody.

928
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,419
Your own homeboys?

929
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:36,221
They're trying
to pin me as a snitch.

930
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:37,723
How'd that happen?

931
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,090
Look, I don't have
time to explain

932
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:40,158
All the details
right now.

933
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,160
It's not safe
for me here.

934
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:45,463
I have to leave town.
Can you help me? Please.

935
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,066
I told you already
I'm done with you.

936
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,907
[Car engine approaching]

937
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,752
ARDMORE:
Lieutenant.

938
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,219
Ardmore. Webster.

939
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,188
So what's going on
with Pacheco?

940
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,923
Yeah, we have
some good intel
on him, sir.

941
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:13,058
He should still be
in the neighborhood.

942
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,860
I know he's
in the neighborhood.

943
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,261
I'm not
asking you to search
the whole state for him.

944
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:17,929
He's a pretty
slippery guy, sir.

945
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,497
Well, we need to find
something on him.

946
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,566
Let me know if
we gotta put another
apprehension team up.

947
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,634
Sir, you don't
have to do that.

948
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:25,270
We'll have him in custody
by the end of the day.

949
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,238
I need to see
some of that college
athleticism, Ardmore.

950
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,074
We'll get him.

951
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,492
You know
how you asked me

952
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:50,095
Why I didn't
turn myself in?

953
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,297
What about it?

954
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,967
My father's
really sick right now.

955
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,972
I had to miss
three parole appointments.

956
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:03,541
I was the one
taking my dad
to his treatments.

957
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,845
Who else
was gonna do it?

958
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:11,116
And I don't want
to be behind bars
when he dies.

959
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,885
Why didn't you
say anything?

960
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:15,787
You always
keep everything inside.

961
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,057
That's just me.

962
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:23,995
Let me call my sister.

963
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:28,033
Maybe you could stay
with her for a while
in Bakersfield.

964
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:30,301
I'll call you later
and let you know.

965
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:35,240
I appreciate what
you're doing for me.

966
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,810
I'm not doing it for you.

967
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,846
I'm doing it
for your son.

968
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:52,791
[Sighs]

969
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:00,198
You know, uh...

970
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,269
This guy, he, uh...

971
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:08,306
Goes to the barber
for his monthly haircut,

972
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,877
Gets in the chair,
and tells his barber,

973
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,848
"I want two quarter-sized
bald spots on my right side"

974
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:19,985
And, uh, three on my left

975
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:21,887
"And one in the back."

976
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,890
Barber looks at him,
like... like he's crazy,

977
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,925
You know, looks at him
in disbelief, saying,

978
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,394
"I can't give you
a haircut like that."

979
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:33,999
The guy says,
"Well, why not?"

980
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:38,203
You been giving me
the same damn haircut
for the past 10 years.

981
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,605
"Only thing is
I haven't told you."

982
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,841
[Chuckling]

983
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,677
You know what's funny?

984
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,413
What?

985
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,381
You actually thought
that joke was funny.

986
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:54,052
* Can you tell me
what's left for a soldier? *

987
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,156
Let's go get Kapone.

988
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:08,433
* Can you tell me
what's left for a soldier? *

989
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:11,636
* Tell me
what's left for me *

990
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:13,638
* Is he still brave

991
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:15,273
* When he's in his grave

992
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:18,209
* Does he hear a damn
when it's over? *

993
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,918
GHOST: So what's
the story, homeboy?

994
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,921
Got away.

995
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,458
What you mean
he got away?

996
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,393
[Sighs]

997
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,162
It was
this fucker, man.

998
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:39,097
We could have
got at Kapone, but
this fool's driving

999
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,331
Like a straight
little bitch, dawg.

1000
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:43,168
Homey,
I was on that fool.

1001
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:44,435
Is that right, Blind?

1002
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,137
Why don't you
talk to me, homey?

1003
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,006
Nothing, man.
I... I was...

1004
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:49,374
I was driving
the best I could,

1005
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,476
But there was kids
all over the place,
man. I...

1006
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,511
Yeah? So?
I don't want to run
the kids over or nothing.

1007
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,180
Shoot...
You didn't want to what?

1008
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,414
Heh.
Showing weakness, homey.

1009
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:59,317
Weakness, dawg?
What the fuck you
want from me, ese?

1010
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,320
I want you to take out
Kapone's old man.

1011
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:03,521
That's what I want.

1012
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,323
Take out a dying man?

1013
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,959
That's some dirty shit,
homey.

1014
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,029
Well, we gotta
do something strong

1015
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,497
For the hood.

1016
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,764
You feel me?

1017
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,166
You make me sick,
homey. Just do it.

1018
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,734
You know what?
Fuck this shit, ese.

1019
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,303
I'm done with this shit.
You motherfuckers
sit around

1020
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,205
Telling us what to do,
kill this guy,
kill that guy.

1021
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:22,207
Why don't
you motherfuckers
go and do it?

1022
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,475
You kill
these motherfuckers.
I'm done.

1024
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,546
You know,
I like you, homey.

1025
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,747
Renegade motherfucker,

1026
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,749
Nobody tells you
what to do.

1027
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,351
You're your own person,
right?

1028
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:37,088
Heh. Remind me of me
back in the days.

1029
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:39,057
Heh. I like that.

1030
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,496
I like that so much,
I'm gonna give you a drink.

1031

[Gagging]

1032
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,002
Fuck.

[Panting]

1034
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,783
What do you
want to do with
the body, homey?

1035
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:06,817
Burn him.

1036
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,486
OK.

1037
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:09,587
Yo, sick,

1038

You go with Ghost.

1039

Me?

1040
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:14,392
Yeah, you, ese.

1041
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:16,061
Why, you got
a problem with that?

1042
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:19,164
Nah, nah.
I ain't got no problem.

1043
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:21,532
Heh. Attagirl.

1044
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,568
Let's go.
Take care of that.

1047
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:45,350
Hey, babe.

1048
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:46,384
Hey, baby.

1049
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,453
Ready to go?
Yeah.

1050
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,454
Um...

1051
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,222
I want to ask you
something, OK?

1052
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:52,923
What's up?

1053
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:54,625
And I want you
to tell me the truth.

1054
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,627
Heh. I already told you
I wasn't fucking that bitch.

1055
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,296
She's just my friend.

1056
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,365
Baby, no, come on.
I'm over that shit.

1057
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:02,133
Then what's up?

1058
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:07,472
Have you ever
killed someone?

1059
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,308
Come on, man.
What kind of shit is that?

1060
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,277
Just be honest, OK?

1061
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,345
Tell me the truth.

1062
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:15,913
Oh. It's your old man.

1063
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,515
He's talking shit
again, huh?

1064
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,284
Baby, h-he worries
about me.

1065
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:21,652
He needs to mind
his own fucking business.

1066
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,454
Just answer
the question.

1067
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:24,655
Have you
killed anyone?

1068
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,425
Man, what the fuck's

Come here.

1070
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,630
What? What?
Fucking come here!

1071
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:35,333
Baby, what the fuck?
Let me go.

1072
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,203
Yeah, I've killed fools.
So fucking what?

1073
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:40,538
Let me go.
You're hurting me.

1074
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:41,939
Shut the fuck up.

1075
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,674
Yeah, now you know.
What you gonna do about it?

1076
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,942
Nothing.
I just want to leave.

1077
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,444
Oh, now you want
to fucking leave me?

1078
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:47,512
No, I didn't say that!

1079
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,214
But you thinking it, right?
No.

1080
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:51,749
Listen to me. If you ever
try to fucking leave me,

1081
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,985
I don't give a fuck
where you are or
who you're with.

1082
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:57,555
I'll kill you, bitch.
You understand me?

1083
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,324
Yeah.
Don't fucking touch me.

1084
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:14,705
You hear anything?

[Sighs]

1086
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,811
It's not looking good.

What is it?

1088
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,389
It's Victor.

1089
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:41,699
What, my old man?

1090
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,239
What about him?

1091
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,410
He's not safe
anymore, mijo.

1092
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,615
Man, no, man.
Don't tell me that.

1093
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,653
Wizard, man, he's dying.

1094
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,721
I know that.

1095
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:06,023
But Crow's pissed,

1096
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,726
And he wants
to flush you out.

1097
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,596
The way he sees it,

1098
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,364
You fucked up
his family,

1099
00:52:13,398 --> 00:52:15,866
So now he wants
to fuck up yours.

1100
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,272
How can my own gang,
my own people do this to me?

1101
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:25,610
These fools don't give
a fuck about nobody.

1102
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,480
I learned that lesson
the hard way...

1103
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,418
When I got shot.

1104
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,621
And I was
in the hospital
lying there, paralyzed.

1105
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,690
You think
any of the homeboys
came to visit me?

1106
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:42,560
Not one.

1107
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:48,065
It was my Evita

when I'd wake up

of the night

all over my bed.

1111
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:00,411
And then
I got locked up.

1112
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:02,580
Eight years.

1113
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:06,116
You think the homeboys
sent me any money

1114
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,586
Or packages to survive?

1115
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:13,491
Or even accepted
my collect phone calls?

1116
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,825
Fuck, no.

1117
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,498
At the end of the day,
mijo...

1118
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:24,369
The only ones who really
give a fuck about you,

1119
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:26,704
Who really care

1120
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,873
Are your familia.

1121
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,813
I gotta go.

1122
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:37,948

I'll take some water.

I don't know.

00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:30,795
I want to see him.

1165

for a while.

around to tell you that

I won't be around
for a while.

00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:06,797
Are you in trouble again?

1172
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,866
No, not this time.

I'm doing real good
right now.

How's your son?

1175

He's big.

1176
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,742
He looks like you.

1177
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,611
Be there for him always,

1178
00:56:20,645 --> 00:56:21,912
Not like me.

1179
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:27,718
Yeah, we don't need
to talk about that
right now.

No, I'm sorry
I hurt you so much.

00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,069
It's OK.

Yeah,
I know you're tired.

1188
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,053
You OK?

1189
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,723
Nah, I'm not OK.

the hood trying
to track you down.

1192

I got nothing left.

1193
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:52,102
Hey, dawg, I... I need
to ask you something.

1194
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,839
This is
between me and you.

1195
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:56,807
Ain't nobody
gotta know about this.

1196
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:57,975
You got my word.

1197
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,644
What is it?

1198
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:02,479
Did you
drop dime on Marcos?

1199
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,118
What do you think?

1200
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,955
I just need
to know for sure.

1201
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:17,695
You've known me
since we were kids.

1202
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:20,765
It's all good.
Forget about it.

1203
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,099
Forget
I said anything.

1204
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,638
We cool?

1205
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:28,673
Yeah, we cool.

1206
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:31,108
Like I said, I just
needed to know for sure.

1207
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:32,142
Well, now you know.

1208
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,179
Have you heard anything?

1209
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:40,417
They want to kill my dad.

1210
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,919
Who told you that?

1211
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:43,187

If you're a real
motherfucking gangster,

1389
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:08,258
You're ready to die

And your sister?

1397

1407
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:51,635
It'll be OK, Sis.
OK, all right?

1408

some business I
gotta take care of.

01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,056
You stay here

RUDY:
What are you gonna do?

1419
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:17,727
Get a gun and kill

* What will I do with all
this gangster in me to give? *

1423
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,802
* I got so much gangster

1424
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,071

1427
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:35,312
* I got so much gangster
to give... *

1428
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:36,646
Hey, Fresco, it's me.

* I got two hours left...

1430
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,717
Yeah, I'm gonna need

01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:43,753
Meet me at Wizard's.

1432
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:46,990
Yeah, OK. OK.

1433
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:52,496
He's going to Wizard's.

1434
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:54,531
That's good, ese.

1435
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,266
That's real good.

1436
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,534
You know,
as a matter of fact,

01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:58,335
That's so good, homeboy,

1438
01:08:58,368 --> 01:09:00,170
I think it's time
to reward you.

1440
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:27,931
They don't
make gangsters
like they used to.

01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,400
Marisela, it's me.

1442
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:34,438
Meet me in the alley
next to Wizard's house
in 20 minutes.

1443
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:45,815
Where's Kapone?

1444
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:49,719
Why?

1445
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:51,421
Answer the fucking question.

1446
01:09:51,455 --> 01:09:53,657
You passing judgment, ese?

1447
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,592
You fucked up.

1448
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,462
Kapone's a snitch.

1449
01:09:58,495 --> 01:09:59,829
You're his little bitch.

1450
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:02,399
You don't know shit,

1451
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,801
Other than what Crow
feeds your punk ass.

1452
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,870
I know he's no good.

1453
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:08,538
You took him in.

1454
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:11,741
Heh. We don't
hide snitches
in the hood.

1455
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:13,843
I ain't gonna lie.

1456
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,646
Kapone's been down here,

1457
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,615
But I'm gonna
tell you something.

1458
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:21,518
That boy ain't no rat,

1459
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,787
And you fucking know it.

1460
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,623
Crow fucked up on this.

[Chuckles]

1462
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,559
That's not
your call anymore.

1463
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:30,760
Maybe not,

1464
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:33,530
But I'm gonna say
what I need to say.

1465
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,632
Your opinion
is gonna cost you.

1466
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,401
So be it.

1467
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,640
You don't run this gang
no more, homes.

1468
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,909
Them days are long gone.

1469
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:49,713
Now you're just
a fucking washed-up,

Crippled veterano, homey.

You ain't shit.

1472
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:59,756
As a matter of fact,

1473
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:03,527
The hood ain't
got no use for you
no more, homeboy.

You should have took
the gun when you had
the chance, homeboy.

Is that right?

That's what happens when
they try to show no loyalty.

Let me tell you
something, homes.

Please. I need you, OK?
I can't do it
by myself.

Please. Please, no.

Please. Look at me.
Look at me, baby.

KAPONE: When I was
in the emergency room,

1572
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:21,544
I kept thinking of my son

1573
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:25,314
And how much
I wanted to hold him.

1574
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:27,183
I don't remember too much

1575
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,552
Once I was
on the operating table,

1576
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:33,890
Except seeing this...
This bright, warm light

1577
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:37,126
And my father
walking through that light.

1578
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,997
I kept trying
to run towards him,

1579
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:44,367
But he kept telling me
that it wasn't my time yet,

1580
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,803
Because my son
still needed me.

1581
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:52,241
For whatever reason,
I was given a chance

1582
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:55,411
To be a father
one more time.

1583

* You're the air
I breathe *
