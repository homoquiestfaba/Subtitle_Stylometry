1
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,441
First Aid Kit.

2
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,952
A real classic, huh?

3
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:40,253
I suppose so.
- I always loved movies.

4
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:43,490
Believe it or not, but I saw
'A Clockwork Orange "is only for the first time.

5
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,855
I think he shows the violence

6
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,984
of humanity in our society.
Do you not?

7
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,364
What is the rush on, Tim?

8
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,440
I am not Mr. Argento.

9
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,151
You watch it.

10
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:32,454
Silent but deadly.
- Keep the finger, asshole.

11
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,468
Keep the finger, asshole.

12
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,375
You know?

13
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,564
You're right.

14
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,944
What then, Johnny?

15
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:49,807
'A Clockwork Orange. "
Kubrick at his best.

16
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:53,390
I know that car parts are not good.
What was that?

17
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,510
Goodbye.

18
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,701
Bitch.

19
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,267
Come on, cowboy.

20
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,701
What is it, kamergenootje?
- Hello.

21
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:11,872
What do we do tonight, Brain?
- What we do every night, Pinky.

22
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:18,411
Trying to take over the world.
I wish you was a girl.

23
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,534
Do we not both?

24
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,231
So you go too, huh?
- What?

25
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:31,558
With this crazy trip.
- Absolutely. I want to succeed.

26
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,426
I have my game bird rate increase.

27
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,860
Yes, it is only 4.1.
- It is 4.6.

28
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:43,277
Keep your calm, but I joke about it.
You know we love you.

29
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,174
Of course I know that my wives.

30
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,748
That I mean.

31
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,968
Maddy.

32
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,023
What are you selling?
More lottery raffle?

33
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,492
Also good morning.

34
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,156
I've never done.

35
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:18,144
What is that?

36
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:25,368
He went hunting
but apparently no one knows where.

37
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,683
I have a bad feeling.

38
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,257
Well.

39
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,694
Anything.
- What?

40
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:47,424
Do you have your big, white already caught.
- Rot op.

41
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,399
Excuse me.

42
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,640
Hello, are you Captain JT Bates?

43
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm Emily of St Frolic University.

44
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,786
We rented your boat for Bear Island.

45
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:13,128
I think it is a beautiful trip, I ...
- Come on board.

46
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,279
Well.

47
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,202
Thank you.

48
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,987
Johnny, here.

49
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,999
My God.
- Great.

50
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,275
That is the leap bitch.

51
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:02,711
Try to miss me too much.
- I will try.

52
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,865
But I survive it.
Have fun.

53
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,592
We have a larger boat is needed.

54
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,977

00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:10,896
I am an assistant in the biologieles.
Mr. Argento thought ...

57
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,381
Potvolkoffie.

58
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,998
What a language.

59
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,948
Thanks, Johnny.
- No problem.

60
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,294
Ice tea?
- Great.

61
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,156
That is beautiful.

62
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,268
Cold hands.
- Warm hearts.

63
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,008
Where are the students?
- In a few hours.

64
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,560
I'm even a little nervous.

65
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:27,257
'Great power brings
great responsibility. "

66
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:29,300

00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,829
Please.
- One of the reasons that

70
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,110
I am in this biology thing, my figure
to increase, so I can play football.

71
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:04,434
So all in red.
I'm professional.

72
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:07,138
The Steelers follow me al

73
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,024
That's great, Tim.

74
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:13,050
Thank you.

75
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:19,855

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,953
'Hellraiser' is the best.

00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:54,973
Favorite killer: Jason, Freddy,
Hannibal Lecter or Michael Myers?

80
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:57,968
Should you not return to
your yellow van?

00:13:57,969 --> 00:13:59,671
Yes, your mama.

82
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,342
I think Hannibal the cannibal,
that eat brains and stuff.

Action.

99
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,575
Can you do something for me?

100
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,089
Can you go back a bit?
As you come of the boat?

101
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:29,989
We just come from the boat.
- I am an inspired filmmaker.

102
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,312
Well, we go.
You have heard the lady.

103
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,918
Remember that we are guests.

Thank you.

113
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,574
I am Mary Shelley.
- Mary Shelley?

114
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,000
My father loved her books.

115
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,989
So I got her name and
my passion for films of my father.

116
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,798
Let's you install.

117
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:10,453

00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:50,758
Do you mind?

121
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,006
Take your chance.

122
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,938
You are all
such beautiful young ladies.

123
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:03,914
I take a bath.
- No. We have about getost.

124
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,965
And, cut.

125
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,412
Fantastic.

126
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,922
Great introduction.

127
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:17,544
I see you soon.
- It is a very interesting woman.

128
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,926
Yes, as a desperate housewife on XTC.

129
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,943
A what?

130
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,507
A nice girl.

131
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,578
Perhaps I need to decorate.

132
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,373
Someday maybe.
- It is good, Mr. King.

133
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,612
Come on, I'm not as old.
My father was Mr. King. I'm Vincent.

134
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,994
Install yourself
and we see each other over for dinner.

135
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:18,995
Okay, V.

136
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,681
This is something for
'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. "

137
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,793
What?
- Nothing.

138
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,867
Have them here 'Psycho' filmed?

139
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,170
From here there is no reception.

140
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:43,909
Nobody is perfect, but ...
- This model is beautiful.

141
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,050
Halogen lighting, double vision,
each area worked against fungi,

142
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:51,382
color corrections
and even hardening agents.

143
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,386
Flatwork Substances, huh?
Maybe I need a microscope.

144
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,486
I will call himself Captain Bates.
He can just pick up.

145
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:02,228
He is usually reliable.
- That would be good. Thanks, Vince.

146
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:05,877
Sure, Freddie.
Here's your room.

147
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,320
Stew.

148
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:07,882
What a mess.
- Nice, I think.

149
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:09,732
Very good.

150
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:13,899
Where is Mr. Argento back?
- I think tomorrow morning.

151
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,675
What a layabout.

152
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,389
That looks beautiful.

153
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,010
Italian, right?
- Absolutely.

154
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,747
Porcile, I saw him
in the Salt Lake Film Festival

155
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:31,146
I huiverde of luck.

156
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:35,488
When I saw my Vinnie for the first time.

157
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:39,788
And we fell for each other.
It was love, huh?

158
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,195
Tomorrow is a big day, huh?

159
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,164
We begin to
on the south coast.

160
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:51,285
We observe invertebrates
in the tidal pools.

161
00:22:56,074 --> 00:23:01,354
I will provide breakfast.
- Thank you, Mary Shelley.

162
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:07,808
A nice house here.
Very Ralph Lauren.

163
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:11,060
Thank you. I
My father inherited.

164
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,017
His heart stopped.

165
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,933
That very sorry.

166
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:21,819
He was a great guy,
a decorated war hero.

167
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,571
Everyone should agree, but
we are already in our sky.

168
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:31,345
It is 28 square kilometers,
6 miles wide and 10 kilometers long.

169
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:34,107
It was formerly a hunting club.
Not anymore.

170
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:38,092
No, it's the perfect place
to schools on the mainland to help.

171
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:41,369
Like you.
Here live many animals in the wild.

172
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,306
So many that poachers are.

173
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,548
Poachers?

174
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,464
As with guns?

175
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:57,169
Do you worry about.
Usually they are out of sight.

176
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,645
Real men, it's nothing
you to worry about it.

177
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:06,625
It is not particular.
- No problem for us, huh guys.

178
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:08,145
A question, V.
- Yes, Q.

179
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:14,226
My phone does not work. Is there a telephone?
- No, but we have telephone, if necessary.

180
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:28,866
Hurry you. I want to go to the beach.
- It's all right.

181
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,458
I'm so gone.
- I do not mind.

182
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,034
You go for it, girlfriend.

183
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,467
Let us discuss our plans.

184
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:43,681
Blowjob, penis lips.
Hairy balls.

185
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:52,384
Well, tomorrow we are to half past four,
we eat and make two groups,

186
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:57,225
Group A and Group B.
Remember your biology notes not.

187
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:03,095
You catch good balls.
- Will you be my trainer?

188
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:04,728
Excuse me.

189
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,306
I have enough of this nonsense.

190
00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:09,527
What?

191
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:12,847
If you did not want to study,
had you not to come.

192
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:15,423
I am here also evaluated.

193
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:19,022
Hold on. Come on.

194
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:23,607
She is right. Now Argento is not there,
who can best organize?

195
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:26,759
If we start around seven o'clock?

196
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,451
Relax friend.

197
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:30,926
Then we made early
and we can party all night.

198
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:32,393
I can live with.

199
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:35,569
Since you are friends,
Q, Maddy, Ricky, you are group A.

200
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,762
Tim, Sylvia, Emily and I are Group B

201
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,474
Good for me.
- Yes.

202
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,820
Hands up.

203
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:48,114
Well, time for a game.
- What?

204
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:50,950
Listen, nature mad.

205
00:26:52,182 --> 00:26:53,839
Well.

206
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,180
If my rock
eight times clashes on the water,

207
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:03,347
all girls show their tits.

208
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:07,921
What did you say?
- And if he is no time conflict?

209
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:14,192
Then he strips to his briefs
and the water running. - Ten seconds.

210
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,804
That you would like to, huh.
Well, I lost anyway.

211
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,183
I participate.

212
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:25,743
Come on, Emily.
This is your chance to show what you have.

213
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:29,612
No, thanks.
- The boy has already GT.

214
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:31,717
GT.

215
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,701
No tits.

216
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,240
That you will never know.
- Who has it?

217
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:48,591
Slick.
- Well, do we.

218
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:52,022
Come on.
- Come on, suckers.

219
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,889
One, two, three, four, five.

220
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,330
Come on, buddy. I have five.
- Strip.

221
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,930
Thousand.

222
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:23,100
Two.

223
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,170
Three.
- Faster.

224
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,551
Well.

225
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:32,943
Thousand.

226
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,697
Two ...

227
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,605
That looks like a woman in panties.

228
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,172
There is more wind came.
- Yes.

229
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,899
You're crazy, man.

230
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:01,967
There was something in the water.

231
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,950
Poor baby.
- Small Timmetje.

232
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:07,741
Klein Timmetje.
The water was very cold.

233
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:11,185
Bastards.
- You piemeltje is so cute.

234
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,857
Stop it.

235
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,911
I am very cold.
- Come.

236
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:20,138
Believe me.

237
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,928
Well.
I have my hose emptying.

238
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,329
If you can find him.
- That I would not start.

239
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:40,684
So, Billy Elliot, how long have you been
a fag?

240
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:45,422
As long as you have a small sausage.

241
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:48,381
The water was cold.

242
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:53,643
For a lulzuiger trap you so bad.
- Really?

243
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:58,688
You will not nichterig
start doing, sir quarterback.

244
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:05,113
Mr quarterback.

245
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,274
With your little one.
- Shut up, dude.

246
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,175
Shut up.

247
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,663
Funny though, it was cold.

248
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,387
Damn.
- Now I have you.

249
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:47,994
Stop it.

250
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,959
Bear.

251
00:31:56,914 --> 00:32:00,412
I had actually
own kids.

252
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,005
It's always fun to practice.

253
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:09,294
Have you seen my camera?
- No, Poeffie, why?

254
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,782
I had him just yet.

255
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:18,357
I do not know
I have left him.

256
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:27,832
As Krusty the clown?
- No he was not Krusty the clown.

257
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:29,746
Probably Captain Spaulding.

258
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,516
Captain who?
- Spaulding.

259
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,986
'House of 1000 corpses'?

260
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,462
Come on, Rob Zombie.

261
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,362
Not personally, but

262
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:55,272
what do you Tim?
He is a jerk.

263
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,970
But he is a handsome boy,
with a beautiful body.

264
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:02,690
Yours is not ugly, sister.
- Thanks, Maddy.

265
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,878
Yes, Tim is handsome,
but he is an empty head.

266
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:10,541
I would not marry him,
I just want sex with him.

267
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,881
Hopefully.

268
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,760
But still.

269
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,117
Come on.

270
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,588
Even you must satisfy your desires
with someone,

271
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:27,203
or something.

272
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,850
Good night.

273
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,877
Relax, man.
- You have not seen that thing.

274
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:10,751
You've clearly gehallucineerd.
- My stuff is good, it is not.

275
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:14,275
That damn clown playing me parts.

276
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:27,258
Sleep well, men.

277
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,030
Do you hear that?

278
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,226
What?

279
00:34:47,283 --> 00:34:50,905
Guest.
- That is disgusting.

280
00:34:50,906 --> 00:34:55,514
You're bad, man.
- What have you eaten? Monkey Ass?

281
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,149
It started, guys.

282
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,462
The whole night.
- Shut up.

283
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,098
Hello.

284
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,428
She loves that camera.

285
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:21,578
I would like to shoot her,
My one-eyed monster.

286
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,924
Monster?
Did you, monster?

287
00:36:25,136 --> 00:36:27,694
No.
- Have fun you guys.

288
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,444
Please show some respect.

289
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:42,435
Kiss me, Mary Shelly.
- My God, who raised you?

290
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,687
Until later.

291
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:50,575
We come back here for two hours.
Mr. Argento will be back.

292
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:54,112
Well, group A and group B.
We go.

293
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:56,942
Very well, peperkop.

294
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,533
Sheriff.

295
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:32,168
Damn, Radley.
Why do you always?

296
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:35,153
But, sir ...
- Enough.

297
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,752
JT is back?
- No, sir.

298
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:43,653
We have heard nothing more
of Captain Bates nor the Orca.

299
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:49,704
I am a moment.
I gotta pee.

300
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:31,896
Stay with the boat.
- All right, Sheriff.

301
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:35,489
He is heavy.

302
00:38:35,962 --> 00:38:42,090
He went this direction.
- Excuse me, I have not seen him.

303
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,861
Would you like something to drink?
- Maybe next time, keep you well.

304
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:50,216
Bear.

305
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:53,576
Think you what I think?

306
00:38:59,491 --> 00:39:01,783
Action.

307
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:23,617
We call our school

308
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:26,064
'Around the ocean. "

309
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:27,821
Well found.

310
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:42,461
Sylvia and I are looking
to native plant species.

311
00:39:43,157 --> 00:39:45,654
We want to help.

312
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,332
Well.

313
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:11,908
You know?

314
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,619
You can do it.

315
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:19,842
The first time you saw, I ...

316
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,430
As you go through.

317
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:26,764
Are you ready to take the rest to see?

318
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,646
Do you need help, dear?

319
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,957
Yeah, baby.

320
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,083
What they are doing to you?

321
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:55,448
Nature study.

322
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:14,194
I do not have much experience.
Absolutely not. I ...

323
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:17,596
I'm still ...
I mean, I've never ...

324
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:21,642
you know.
- It's the same with me.

325
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:27,808
Really?
- Yes. It is not always what it seems.

326
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,397
Apparently.

327
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:44,105
Honey.
- Come on.

328
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,385
It is nice to be popular.

329
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,165
Have you seen Tim and Sylvia?
- No, why?

330
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:50,174
They are already missing hours.
- It will be okay.

331
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:53,521
Can I just use your phone?
- Sure.

332
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:08,653
Too bad your friends are not there,
to enjoy the meal.

333
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,781
And your teacher too.

334
00:43:10,782 --> 00:43:15,716
Mr. Argento had his back.
- So much more is there for us.

335
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:21,582
Glad you keep films.
- It's always been a passion.

336
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:25,403
- Ever since I was a boy,
not true, Miss Moneypenny.

337
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:32,150
My Vinnie likes the classics,
especially the narrow, such as' The Birds'.

338
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:37,052
My favorites? Documentaries.

339
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:42,358
Then you have something in common with Emily.
She also likes the old stay.

340
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:44,855
Really?

341
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,526
And the rest of you?
Keep you from horror films?

342
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:52,098
Usually they are boring,
unrealistic and predictable.

343
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:56,829
And my brothers always die first.
- Not always.

344
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:03,908
I love rancidity, many,
of bloody entrails.

345
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:06,881
Bitch in style.

346
00:44:10,028 --> 00:44:13,232
Are you back to your fold?
- Certainly not.

347
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:17,764
The phone line is again defective.
- This is a classic in horror films.

348
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:22,560
"The bridge is flooded.
You will have to stay overnight.

349
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:26,448
This is one of those things that happen
if you live here.

350
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:29,240
But it's worth it.
- Definitely.

351
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:31,570
A new recipe.

352
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,201
Please.

353
00:44:36,903 --> 00:44:39,358
Who's next?

354
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:54,004
Stay safe and protect little Johnny.
- Wear a raincoat.

355
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,473
Got something to smoke?

356
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,220
For insanity,
here we are.

357
00:44:59,372 --> 00:45:03,346
I stopped, Maddy.
- You have nothing.

358
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:05,920
No.
- It is ironic.

359
00:45:05,921 --> 00:45:09,515
After all these years that people say
how bad it is,

360
00:45:09,516 --> 00:45:12,833
there is a clown necessary
to let you stop.

361
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:14,879
Laugh with yourself.

362
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,783
I always say that. Right, Brain?
- Yes, Pinky.

363
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:22,436
This is for you.

364
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:28,411
My God. Stop smoking it.

365
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,940
You breathe it stinks.
It is dirty.

366
00:45:35,224 --> 00:45:41,321
Where did you grow up?
- In Benton, but born in Syracuse.

367
00:45:41,662 --> 00:45:44,402
And you?
- In Maine.

368
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,709
In a small town, no future

369
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,302
so we went to the west.

370
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:58,008
Better?
- Much better.

371
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:06,701
This is a nice place, huh?
- Fantastic.

372
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:14,418
What is that?

373
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:19,349
Probably a poacher.

374
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:32,860
Hello, baby.
Carry, it's the Q. Hello.

375
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:37,238
Can you hear me now?

376
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,150
Honey? Can you hear me now?

377
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:43,521
Damn.

378
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,519
If the damn fool is not.

379
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:06,243
We saw just a poacher.
- Really? Q is still not back.

380
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,150
Where is he going?

381
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:12,314
He went into his bitch call.
- Do what?

382
00:48:14,198 --> 00:48:17,727
Crack, mouse, flamoes ...

383
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,686
If I were you I would some loosening.

384
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:23,509
I will try to be more vulgar,
especially for you.

385
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:26,208
That would be fantastic.

386
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:41,581
Maybe he is injured,
cases or something.

387
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:45,470
Should we call anyone?
- Who? Charlie's Angels?

388
00:48:45,471 --> 00:48:49,405
We are on a fucking island.
- It's all right. Jesus.

389
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,866
This is truly bizarre.

390
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:59,996
Maybe he forgot, or something?
- Tim? His ball forgotten?

391
00:49:28,223 --> 00:49:32,422
Now we find Q anymore.
- And here is the ball of Tim, no Tim.

392
00:49:32,423 --> 00:49:35,492
Is there something wrong?
- Yes, there is a student missing?

393
00:49:35,493 --> 00:49:40,868
It seems a strange episode
of 'Survivor'. - Or 'The Twilight Zone. "

394
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:44,462
Remember that episode with Burgess Meredith,
where the last living man,

395
00:49:44,463 --> 00:49:47,068
with his glasses, he should just ...
- Let now this.

396
00:49:48,048 --> 00:49:51,541
I know that you are concerned.
There is certainly a logical explanation.

397
00:49:51,542 --> 00:49:55,490
We saw someone in a boat.
- It is perhaps a poacher.

398
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:04,470
Enough with the fucking camera.
- Now is not the moment.

399
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:10,954
Okay.
But you should not be common.

400
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,510
Is there no way
for someone to contact us?

401
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,134
Unfortunately, no.

402
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:19,865
What if there is an emergency?
An accident?

403
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:23,945
We should never worry.
Usually, the phone.

404
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:26,342
It will do.
- We had better go to sleep now.

405
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:29,461
If no one pops up tonight,
we find it tomorrow.

406
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:32,482
People, trust me.

407
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,642
Perhaps Q is really lost.

408
00:50:38,643 --> 00:50:42,566
And Sylvia and Tim are left
us without warning?

409
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:44,543
What are we doing?

410
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,213
I suggest for a gang.
- Madison?

411
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:55,805
What?
I try to lift everyone.

412
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,423
Come on, guys.

413
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:24,012
You are so talented.

414
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:28,105
Steven Spielberg nothing,
compared with you.

415
00:51:28,106 --> 00:51:31,294
You are geiler than Lara Croft.

416
00:51:31,399 --> 00:51:33,527
It is unimaginable.

417
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:39,817
And we fit together so nicely.

418
00:51:57,422 --> 00:51:59,475
Come on.

419
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:28,942
Maybe we should wait
until the morning.

420
00:52:28,943 --> 00:52:31,408
I can not sleep.
- Me neither.

421
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:34,926
We have a plan.
We make two groups.

422
00:52:34,927 --> 00:52:38,451
Groepie groepie?
- We are stronger if we stay together.

423
00:52:38,452 --> 00:52:41,775
That is so.
- I know that we are stronger.

424
00:52:41,776 --> 00:52:43,692
But then we can
double territory search.

425
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:47,666
Let me guess.
You stay with Johnny?

426
00:52:51,254 --> 00:52:53,245
Bitch.

427
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,761
They are always set
in these films.

428
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:44,315
Did you miss me?

429
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:57,766
Here is a look I am never tired.

430
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:00,446
This is nature at its best.

431
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,188
Hang on.

432
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,352
It looks like a scene
from a bad horror movie.

433
00:54:22,353 --> 00:54:24,833
Say that.

434
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:27,500
God, there.
- What? Where?

435
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:37,336
You're a bad whore.
- So you love me.

436
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,799
It must have been what
for everyone to get here.

437
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,496
What do you mean?

438
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:47,247
On this excursion.

439
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:52,819
The students wrote in.
They sent in an application.

440
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,946
Like you.

441
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,634
There are altogether
between different characters.

442
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:01,058
It seems
a collection typetjes.

443
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:04,273
That is true.
- The athlete who likes his muscles shows.

444
00:55:04,274 --> 00:55:07,610
The hot exchange student.
- So hot she is not.

445
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:14,258
We have one of the black ghetto,
an extravagant Asian, a metal girl,

446
00:55:14,752 --> 00:55:19,836
and a smart, beautiful,
very hot young lady,

447
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:23,091
even glasses wear.

448
00:55:50,398 --> 00:55:52,517
That was ...

449
00:55:52,518 --> 00:55:55,214
That was extraordinary.

450
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:06,697
I thought you handsome
Clark Gable or Cary Grant character was.

451
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,765
They are perfectly cast.

452
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:15,290
But what?

453
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:19,911
It is the Sheriff.

454
00:56:27,013 --> 00:56:29,267
Mr. King.

455
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,682
Mrs. King.

456
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,916
What is going on here?

457
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,968
I asked you, madam.

458
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:47,691
I asked you, madam.

459
00:56:52,072 --> 00:56:55,447
Here's Johnny.

460
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:56,996
Cut.

461
00:56:57,351 --> 00:56:59,538
End of scene.

462
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:05,222
Okay, Bear. We need more.
It is a busy night.

463
00:57:05,223 --> 00:57:09,648
And you have another boat to sink.
- I immediately begin to treasure.

464
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:16,227
It is stuck.

465
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,231
Asshole.

466
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:32,081
Films requires that unexpected
hurdles to be taken.

467
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,717
Yes, darling.

468
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,677
Yes.

469
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:53,353
This is cruel.

470
00:57:53,354 --> 00:57:58,609
Q is probably somewhere smoking
and destroy laugh. - Maybe.

471
00:58:02,884 --> 00:58:05,020
Where are you?

472
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,475
He takes us in the leg.

473
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,527
What a Bullshit.

474
00:58:14,645 --> 00:58:16,496
You're right, we go.

475
00:58:16,497 --> 00:58:19,184
I need to pee.

476
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:23,333
You're so feminine.
- Certainly not.

477
00:58:27,885 --> 00:58:32,291
Stay in the neighborhood.
- You can call me a clean sweep, if you want.

478
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,587
It is tempting.

479
01:00:02,491 --> 01:00:06,358
My God, girl.
That is a long pond turn.

480
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,565
Come on, Maddy.

481
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,711
This is not funny.
Not funny.

482
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,065
Who's there?

483
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:26,353
Perhaps only verzwikt Q
or something.

484
01:00:26,354 --> 01:00:27,862
We found him.

485
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:31,763
I have an odd feeling.
Did you do that?

486
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:35,254
Here is something wrong.

487
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:40,292
I think it is fine.

488
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:27,323
Stay the fuck away from me.

489
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:34,256
Touch me and I speak a curse from
you dick of decline.

490
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:38,607
Stop with that kind of dirty talk, girl.

491
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:43,200
Or I take Mr. McGregor
and save your unconscious.

492
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:47,737
I mean it, asshole.
I mean it, damn it.

493
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:54,013
If you do not talk to the man
you are going to release.

494
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,765
Promise?

495
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:09,928
My word like a drunkard
with a kilt, as man of the sea.

496
01:02:09,929 --> 01:02:12,270
On my honor as a highlander.

497
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,066
Believe me, girl.

498
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:17,703
I am not the person,
which you should be concerned.

499
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,566
If you have not noticed,

500
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:31,859
the people here
as crazy as a door.

501
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:36,928
Listen, I have a boat
on the other side of the island.

502
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:41,448
Go to it and wait there.
I'll pick your friends.

503
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:44,612
At least, if they are still alive.

504
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:11,856
He is fast, huh?
- Yes.

505
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:15,496
So let us organize.
Why filming nothing extra.

506
01:03:15,497 --> 01:03:18,925
Maybe B-roll.
- Now we are still here.

507
01:03:19,146 --> 01:03:23,079
Bear, you're good.
- Yes?

508
01:03:31,189 --> 01:03:36,782
I love you.
I love my Vincent.

509
01:03:40,357 --> 01:03:43,124
Bear, I was just scared.

510
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,828
We found no one during the night.
- We must not stop.

511
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:54,396
What was that?
- What was what?

512
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,437
I'm not sure.

513
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:02,601
Put you down.
We will be safe. Good?

514
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:07,883
I am a moment.
- Safe? Johnny?

515
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:15,073
Great.
It is not good. I have ...

516
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,059
This can not be real.

517
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,716
Your karate is a joke.

518
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,649
My Vinnie likes the classics.

519
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:01,421
As' The Birds'.

520
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:46,043
Are you okay?

521
01:06:51,609 --> 01:06:55,667
That bastard made me afraid.

522
01:07:06,737 --> 01:07:08,920
Listen. Ok.

523
01:07:09,561 --> 01:07:13,454
We should really go.
Good?

524
01:07:15,397 --> 01:07:17,375
You like that?

525
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:30,199
Fantastic.

526
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:35,218
I can only 'wow' say
what a great performance.

527
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:38,454
Thanks, Uncle Vincent.
- You have not told me

528
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:42,950
that the Chinese martial arts had.
- That I did not know, and he is Korean.

529
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:45,228
It was not in his report.

530
01:07:45,229 --> 01:07:49,314
This university has already disappointed me
in many areas.

531
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,545
Poor Aunt Mary Shelley.

532
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:00,021
It is all right.

533
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:06,181
If you die while doing something
what you love

534
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:09,155
it is your life
not been worthless.

535
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,471
Now is the time for the last section.

536
01:08:45,376 --> 01:08:47,689
Jesus.

537
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:52,365
What did you fear a hare.

538
01:08:52,416 --> 01:08:54,359
Where did you go?

539
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,769
I walk around in circles.

540
01:08:59,456 --> 01:09:01,420
I missed you.

541
01:09:04,634 --> 01:09:06,485
Wil je

542
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:09,422
my glasses further decline?

543
01:09:12,596 --> 01:09:14,473
Of course.

544
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,816
Wil je me, Johnny?

545
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:33,778
Here on the ground and now a moment?

546
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:43,479
Let's be naughty.

547
01:09:43,627 --> 01:09:45,679
Is everything good with you?

548
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:51,949
It can not be better, Johnny Rocket.
Show me your gun.

549
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:56,681
Are you ready for the explosion?
- What are you smoking, girl?

550
01:10:02,742 --> 01:10:06,918
I thought we had the sex scene.
- I am of the opinion changed.

551
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,899
Good, good.

552
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:12,150
Young lady, I am still your guardian.

553
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:16,670
And I am responsible
to your mother, if you want to or not.

554
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,845
But you had promised.

555
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,962
Monkey still love you.

556
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,581
And I love you, monkey.

557
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:42,503
I miss Mary Shelley.
- With three, it was very nice.

558
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,383
That was so.

559
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,401
Wake up.

560
01:11:11,004 --> 01:11:12,985
Wake up.

561
01:11:17,639 --> 01:11:20,230
Johhny, be wa ...

562
01:11:20,771 --> 01:11:23,000
My head.

563
01:11:25,097 --> 01:11:27,283
What stinks here?

564
01:11:29,376 --> 01:11:32,698
Where am I?
- It makes no sense.

565
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:39,204
Those bastards make a snuff film, and we
play the leading role. - What are you talking about?

566
01:11:39,205 --> 01:11:41,510
A horror movie reality.

567
01:11:41,511 --> 01:11:46,307
I heard them say to Cannes,
perfect for the French.

568
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:52,913
It's disgusting.
- You are just out.

569
01:11:53,762 --> 01:11:56,268
Is that Mr. Argento?

570
01:11:56,486 --> 01:12:00,183
Christ.
- They make horror movies after.

571
01:12:00,184 --> 01:12:01,935
Damn.

572
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:04,772
Emily took care of the cast
and brought us all here.

573
01:12:04,773 --> 01:12:10,010
Your girlfriend has mad it up.
- She is not my girlfriend.

574
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,617
My God, is that "Hellraiser"?

575
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:21,070
'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre "?

576
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,477
'Th3rteen Ghosts?
This may not be true.

577
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:32,757
Is that Mary Shelley?
Not 'The Birds'.

578
01:12:33,078 --> 01:12:37,333
They think they are artists,
but they lack originality.

579
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,279
Damn.

580
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,630
Let me guess.
My feet were on?

581
01:12:57,139 --> 01:13:01,921
I was almost forgotten.
There are also disturbed fish in the water.

582
01:13:16,377 --> 01:13:18,496
Damn.

583
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:24,634
Oh, damn, dirty sky
What's going on?

584
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:27,454
Who are you?
- The people here call me Willy.

585
01:13:27,455 --> 01:13:29,772
Liberated us, Willy.

586
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:32,123
There are the keys.

587
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,585
You got it, girl.

588
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:45,883
My boat is on the south coast.
I get you here. Come on.

589
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,858
Hurry. Get me out of here.

590
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:55,385
Calm down, girl.
Do I look like the Great Houdini?

591
01:13:56,288 --> 01:14:02,332
Stop. You is not in the scenario.
Improvising it, Emily.

592
01:14:02,488 --> 01:14:05,235
And action.

593
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:08,559
The whole world is an arena

594
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,393
and all men and women

595
01:14:11,394 --> 01:14:14,642
but actors.

596
01:14:17,115 --> 01:14:19,173
You're bad.

597
01:14:19,174 --> 01:14:23,471
They are right, girl.
You are really bad.

598
01:14:23,472 --> 01:14:28,834
In fact, in all these years, this
Shakespeare the worst I ever saw.

599
01:14:28,835 --> 01:14:33,453
I will give you two thumbs down
be given.

600
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:46,426
That is not fair.

601
01:14:46,635 --> 01:14:48,876
Anyone can give criticism.

602
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:03,705
Sylvia, no.

603
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:10,391
Now she is not so hot, huh?

604
01:15:15,841 --> 01:15:18,027
That is not correct.

605
01:15:18,028 --> 01:15:22,489
You are mine, literally.
- Not today, Vince.

606
01:15:25,276 --> 01:15:27,597
That was not good.

607
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:32,312
I stood in front of the ...

608
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:36,720
That hurts.
- Wait a minute, Uncle Vincent.

609
01:15:36,721 --> 01:15:38,544
Uncle?

610
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:41,161
Damn.

611
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:40,837
No more friendly.

612
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,137
As you know, Emily.

613
01:16:55,138 --> 01:16:57,436
Films
the largest export product of America.

614
01:16:57,437 --> 01:17:01,685
No horror movie has ever
loss, they say anyway.

615
01:17:01,686 --> 01:17:04,353
And now reality shows
more and more popular.

616
01:17:04,354 --> 01:17:09,391
We have the perfect product.
Let your friend skinning.

617
01:17:09,407 --> 01:17:11,278
Alive.

618
01:17:31,209 --> 01:17:34,081
Bravo.

619
01:17:34,114 --> 01:17:36,202
You are both crazy.

620
01:17:36,203 --> 01:17:39,217
You are both crazy.
The word is talented.

621
01:17:39,218 --> 01:17:41,823
You have killed everyone,
to make a stupid movie?

622
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:46,762
This is not a silent film.
Was Jack Frost or Ghost Dad stupid?

623
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:50,895
Certainly not, you stupid idiot.
It calls it art.

624
01:17:50,896 --> 01:17:55,538
Some people continue to live.
Something that you can and never will understand.

625
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:58,613
This movie sucks
will not continue to live.

626
01:17:58,614 --> 01:18:02,641
You do better the Charles Manson Fanclub.
You too, psycho bitch.

627
01:18:02,642 --> 01:18:05,739
Look at my mouth,
damn Johnny Rocket.

628
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,648
The truth is that you
disturbed family values have.

629
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:11,689
The truth?
You can use the truth to.

630
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:15,841
Everything you do is a cliché.
You're a copycat.

631
01:18:15,842 --> 01:18:19,238
This could be your title,
"The imitator. Idiot.

632
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:29,811
What do you think of this, amateur asshole.

633
01:18:32,464 --> 01:18:35,536
This is for you, olifantenman.
- What ...

634
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:40,541
He started on my nerves.

635
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,206
Are you gonna murder me now?
- You learn quickly, Einstein.

636
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:56,574
Too bad you have to die.
You were great in this movie.

637
01:18:58,036 --> 01:19:00,238
I thought we had something?

638
01:19:06,434 --> 01:19:08,691
I wanted you.

639
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:14,790
But now I want you mootjes heels.

640
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,836
Jump in the boat.

641
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:30,983
Pretend you grow.
- That does not seem real.

642
01:19:30,984 --> 01:19:33,325
Do it.
- Good. Relax.

643
01:19:38,793 --> 01:19:41,629
Favorite movie, and no lies.

644
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:45,239
Rowing simply.

645
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,909
Mine is' Dead Calm '.

646
01:19:48,097 --> 01:19:52,577
In 1989, with Nicole Kidman,

647
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:05,549
Sam Neill, Billy Zane.

648
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:08,458
Beautiful film.

649
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,549
With a beautiful ending.

650
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:36,255
A nice end, but predictable.

651
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,224
I thought you ...

652
01:20:39,225 --> 01:20:42,328
Where I come from,
piranha's eating them.

653
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:47,376
Dear Mary and Joseph.
What is going on here?

654
01:20:47,377 --> 01:20:50,704
Barslechte a horror movie.

655
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:55,116
And hopefully without sequel.

656
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:24,208
It is unimaginable.

657
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:29,818
We fit so well together.

658
01:21:35,636 --> 01:21:38,552
It must have been what
for everyone to get here.

659
01:21:38,553 --> 01:21:40,368
What do you mean?

660
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,490
Believe me, girl.

661
01:21:45,491 --> 01:21:48,162
I am not the person,
which you should be concerned.

662
01:21:48,163 --> 01:21:50,049
Bear?

663
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,460
And action. 


664
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,599
En actie.
