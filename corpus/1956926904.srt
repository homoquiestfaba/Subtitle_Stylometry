1
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:10,111
- [Voiceover] The way I
see it, you can write your

2
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,380
congressman, sign a
petition, get on a bus,

3
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,648
and million man
march in Washington.

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,151
Or stuff envelopes, volunteer,
register swing voters

5
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,819
in swing states.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,355
Shit, you can quit your
corporate job and sign up

7
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,291
to teach poor kids on a bus.

8
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:25,393
Do relief work in some war
torn country, get on some

9
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,803
back to nation trip
and live off the grid

10
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:30,098
in Vermont, eating bark
and wiping your ass

11
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:31,265
with oak leaves.

12
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,144
Whatever it is, you'll
probably convince yourself

13
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:37,538
it's all good, drift
off to sleep at night,

14
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,208
thinking, "I'm doing my part."

15
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:44,078
See, that's what the
myth's built on, the one

16
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:46,747
we all got spoon
fed in grade school.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,083
Idea that the little man
can make a difference,

18
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:50,794
pull himself up by the
bootstraps, you know,

19
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,853
do something positive.

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,788
That shit's been hardwired
into every one of our

21
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,325
little American hard drives.

22
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:01,162
Except, maybe, I picked
up a virus along the way.

23
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,732
Got some worm in me that's
just been digging and digging

24
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,835
and erasing and organizing
because that myth just

25
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,171
wasn't working out.

26
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,848
I started asking myself,
I started thinking that

27
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,275
maybe the only way to
really get at the truth,

28
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,477
the only way to really
shake things up,

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,255
is to have the establishment
come face to face

30
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,381
with the barrel of a gun.

31
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,095
(ominous music)

32
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,217
- I'm waiting on
something, Senator.

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,653
- Can we at least
cover my privates?

34
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:00,854
Can we do that at least?

35
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:03,491
- Why don't we try answering
the question first, Senator?

36
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,492
- Christ.

37
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,793
I'm losing circulation here.

38
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,495
- Would you keep
your voice down?

39
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,863
- Voice down, I'm naked, I'm
tied to a goddamned chair.

40
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,433
How much longer you gonna...

41
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,905
I get it, OK, you got me,
I'm quiet as a church mouse.

42
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,277
- Now you can continue
when you're ready.

43
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,479
(chatter)

44
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,793
- Was it a face to face
meeting and how did

45
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,552
you actually meet him?

46
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,887
- Well, as mentioned, I've
been conducting research

47
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,324
on the hacker community.

48
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,760
And I made contact through
some of my connections.

49
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,330
And no, it's not a
face to face situation.

50
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,232
(chatter)

51
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,666
Miss.

52
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,268
- But is it really viable?

53
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,703
Does this individual
believe that he can actually

54
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,805
undermine the system in
some fundamental way,

55
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,475
that criminal activity
like this might actually

56
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,778
evolve into a legitimate
political platform?

57
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,913
(typing)

58
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,917
(beeps)

59
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,588
- I was asked to read
a prepared statement.

60
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,358
Before I do, I'd like to
direct everyone's attention

61
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,360
to the confess website.

62
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:15,229
Which apparently
was just updated.

63
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,734
(ominous music)

64
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,803
(beeps)

65
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,673
- I support jobs in South
Carolina over sending

66
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,243
aid to some Arab who's gonna
blow us all to kingdom come.

67
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:33,481
- OK, fair enough, but that's
not what I asked you, Senator.

68
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,848
- No, you listen to me.

69
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,884
Why should we care, huh?

70
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:39,887
I'll ask you that.

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,823
As a US senator from
South Carolina, why should

72
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:46,327
I give a shit about sending
aid to Mexico or somewheres

73
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,830
else when I've got some
tobacco farmer lost his job,

74
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,933
he can't make his truck
payments, he's losing his house,

75
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,911
his wife is gonna leave
him, so why the hell should

76
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,504
I care?

77
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,838
Huh?

78
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,940
I mean, if they're starving
in them other places,

79
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,941
let 'em starve.

80
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,344
If they hump monkeys in
the jungles of Africa

81
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,280
and get AIDs, then that's
their cross to bear.

82
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,849
Look, could we cover up
my goddamned genitals?

83
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,851
(chatter)

84
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,990
- Thank you.

85
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,528
So, here we go.

86
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,434
The confess project is about
giving a voice to truths

87
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,302
that are rarely heard.

88
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,905
(hip hop music)

89
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,951
- This is the normal
verse, you understand that?

90
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,586
We all ride this.

91
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,657
- They are going to
treat you, so how can you

92
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,827
say that 40,000,000
people are uninsured?

93
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,863
Come back here and talk.

94
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:03,904
- Keep it real means keep
it real fucking broke.

95
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,906
- You think this is power?

96
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:21,855
- There are a few things I'd
like to go over with you.

97
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,093
- Vinny, he's not with me,
get him out of the car.

98
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,083
- Come on guys, I look
like a goddamned computer

99
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,809
department to you?

100
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,999

an obligation to do everything
in our power to bring

125
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,732
open markets and
democracy to those who are

126
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,133
less fortunate.

127
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,235
- [Voiceover] So, would
you characterize this as

128
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,236
an exercise in nation building?

129
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,914
- [Woman On TV] No, I
would characterize this

130
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,007
as a national security priority,

131
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,944
and just as important,
a moral obligation to

132
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,013
give a helping hand...

133
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:31,919
- [Voiceover] No, we're good,
I got a whole lot of it.

134
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,754
Shit, coming out of
high school, I basically

135
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,023
swept the academic awards.

136
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,625
All the prizes.

137
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,098
Excellence in science
and technology,

138
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,661
national merit scholar,

139
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,897
future leaders award,
engineer, promise prize.

140
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,266
It was basically like
the crowning moment.

141
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,736
The end result of my mamma
enrolling me in every

142
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,071
after school program
out there, give me that

143
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:55,976
computer early, always
deferring gratification shit.

144
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,546
You know, play by the rules.

145
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,682
Bring an apple to your teacher.

146
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,651
Double check, triple
check that homework.

147
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:07,120
Don't get caught up in
stupid teenage shit.

148
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,290
It was all about keeping my
eyes on the future payout.

149
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,860
The full ride to a top college.

150
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,261
The high paying job.

151
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,229
A house and a mortgage.

152
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,033
Doing better than my dad had.

153
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,970
I got championed by teachers.

154
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,639
By boosters who wanted
to be part of a story

155
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,975
about at risk kid with smarts.

156

157
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,849
- [Voiceover] Some employee's
gonna pay some high school

158
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,951
drop out to hack into a
company server and bring down

159
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,177
a whole business, and
that's where we fit in.

160
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,579
Safe circle...

161
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,691
- Hello?

162
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,261
Someone up there?

163
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,096
- Fuck.

164
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,275
(gasping)

165
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,111
- Oh come here, come down here.

166
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,716
(laughs)

167
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,997
How come you didn't
call me and tell me you

168
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,356
were coming back?

169
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,900
I would have picked
you up at the airport.

170
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,301
- Well, I know, but I
just took a bus, and,

171
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,195
you know, I didn't have
the exact time I was

172
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,196
coming home.

173
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,698
- A bus, from Mexico?

174
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,032
- Yeah, part time.

175
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,103
- What, you run out of money?

176
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,942
Look at you.

177
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,847
You look so different.

178
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:17,084
You're older, with
your dreads all long.

179
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,852
Oh, sweetie.

180
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,754
- Mom, Mom, Mom.

181
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,055
- OK, OK, OK.

182
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,957
I can't help myself.

183
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,369
So, you gonna be here
for a while though, huh?

184
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,904
- Well, in the city, you
know, just here to take

185
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,899
care of some stuff, just
to work some things out.

186
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,934
- You gonna stay
here though, right?

187
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,905
- No, I'm gonna be
staying in the city.

188
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:41,308
But you know, I'll come
through, I'll come see you.

189
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,341
- OK, OK.

190
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,192
- Are you OK?

191
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,226
- I'm good.

192
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,461
I'm fine.

193
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,866
- All right.

194
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,202
- You're not gonna
stay right now?

195
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,270
- I can't, Mom.

196
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,447
- [Mom] Well can't
we just go get

197
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,439
something to eat or something?

198
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,308
- Look, I just got to
go meet this guy later

199
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,978
and I'll be back later
on in the week, OK?

200
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,180
- [Voiceover] First
mover advantage is key.

201
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,215
Gotta stress that,
remember that, Terrell,

202
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,384
I gotta stress that, now
first mover advantage

203
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,453
and its impact on market share.

204
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:30,057
Now, you gotta mention Gato,
Amazon, Mission Import,

205
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,727
the big boys, that's
what we're gonna be.

206
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,998
(hip hop music)

207
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,827
- So, we start you off at
eight and a half beans an hour,

208
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,129
and that's policy, but
you listen, all right now,

209
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,833
you do good work, OK, I
get positive feedback,

210
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,310
we'll see about throwing
you a little more

211
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,336
in a month or so.

212
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,006
(sirens blaring)

213
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,008
- You promised to
e-mail me everyday,

214
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,076
once it's up and running.

215
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,145
Of course, there's a four
hour time difference,

216
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,146
isn't there?

217
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,048
Or is it three?

218
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,216
Three.

219
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,259
- [Voiceover] Look, we all
know the girl has no talent,

220
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,319
so why don't we just
package her on her looks,

221
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,253
the lifestyle...?

222
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,898
- Exactly, the evolution
from down and out,

223
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,057
reconnecting with the
millionaire father.

224
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,425
- That's it, right?

225
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,893
You're finished?

226
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,128
I can get on it now?

227
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,297
- He's at Stanford,
full scholarship.

228
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,866
Did I already mention that?

229
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,276
- I started out here
three years ago.

230
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,037
All right, I worked
installation.

231
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,539
But I busted my balls
and I proved myself

232
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,042
and now, I'm in management.

233
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,017
- So, that's it, right?

234
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,821
You're finished, I
can get on it now?

235
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,256
What?

236
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,367
- How many times you gonna
ask me that question, man?

237
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,826
- [Kid] Yeah, yeah, yeah, but...

238
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,995
- Did you bring it
to them on time?

239
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:15,996
All right.

240
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,399
Tomorrow, 8:00 AM, I got
you on around six calls,

241
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:23,370
a richie rich uptown,
that PR firm and a couple

242
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,405
of geriatrics in Queens.

243
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,417
- I guess we should go with
the eating disorder thing,

244
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,443
yeah, I think that'll
play really nicely,

245
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:34,915
her getting it under control,
finding herself, whatever.

246
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,449
- [Voiceover] Very
human, touching.

247
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,419
- I can connect it,
it's easy, I know how.

248
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,588
Yeah, yeah, you just have
to do it, I'll show you.

249
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,124
- OK, OK, listen, kid, you
really need to chill out, OK?

250
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,426
- You listen to
me, he fixates, OK?

251
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,030
He has a disorder,
he's special needs, OK?

252
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,265
Now you gonna answer
his questions?

253
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,943
Are you gonna tell him
how long, you gonna tell

254
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,368
me how long?

255
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,071
Because I'm late for my trainer.

256
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,342
- OK, look, all
right, it's my bad,

257
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,912
you know, I was almost
finished anyway.

258
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,555
Look, all I was doing was
installing this webcam,

259
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,082
which I'm throwing in for
free because I made you late

260
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,518
and I messed up your schedule.

261
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,921
As a matter of fact,
let me show you this.

262
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,056
Now, with this webcam,
you're gonna be able

263
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,426
to shoot pictures and
short video clips.

264
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,462
(typing)

265
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,433
Stuff like this.

266
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,434
Enjoy.

267
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,178
- Are you gonna tell him
how long, you gonna tell

268
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,103
me how long?

269
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:33,540
It's a disorder, he's
special needs, OK?

270
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,409
Now you gonna answer
his questions?

271
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,945
Turn it off.

272
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,447
You know what, I'm
calling your boss.

273
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,582
- You humiliated her,
you humiliated her son,

274
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,650
you were late.

275
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,187
I'm gonna have to fire
you, hey, you can't leave

276
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,090
with the shirt and the hat, hey.

277
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,407
- Excuse me.

278
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,577
There seems to be something
wrong with my door.

279
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,480
- Credit card number
you left got canceled.

280
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,015
Was it even yours?

281
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,923
- Here you go.

282
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,397
- It's a good start,
but you owe 83.25.

283
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,042
- Come on, man, I don't
get paid until the end

284
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,201
of the week, man.

285
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,502
- Yeah, me too.

286
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,043
- OK.

287
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,450
- Hey, you can't come in here.

288
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,651
- Get the fuck out of my way.

289
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,120
- Hey, you can't come in here.

290
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,621
- What you gonna do?

291
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,430
- [Voiceover] OK, so,
when they're telling you

292
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,132
the classic stock of
the company you start

293
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,234
is gonna be worth 1.75
million the minute

294
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,669
the company goes
public, you're 19,

295
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,771
you're the fucking man,
the geek turned celebrity,

296
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,074
the quiet kid in the corner
who's gonna be rolling

297
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,676
up in a fucking Benz next week.

298
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,380
You start turning down the
full ride scholarships,

299
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,082
you're feeling good about it.

300
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,117
MIT, well thanks, but no thanks.

301
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,020
Carnegie Melon, maybe next time.

302
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,556
Stanford, I'll take that
honorary doctorate in a couple

303
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,093
years and get that
shit ready for you.

304
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,095
You start promising
your mom a new house,

305
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,197
new car, telling her
she'll be able to quit

306
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,232
that shitty ass job
and take that trip

307
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:43,203
to the Bahamas she always
used to talk about.

308
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,774
(melancholy music)

309
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,156
(chatter)

310
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:44,097
- OK, die, yeah,
yeah, die, yeah.

311
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,866
OK.

312
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,404
Yeah, yes, yes, yes.

313
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,141
Never saw that coming, did ya?

314
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,179
- I mean, stuff was changing.

315
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,582
They sold the
division, I don't know,

316
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,285
basically it was the
same routine, pretty much

317
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,752
the same as ever.

318
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,456
- So what happened next?

319
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,526
- Out of the blue,
two weeks notice.

320
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,827
Just like that.

321
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,164
- Hold up.

322
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,866
Explain it, what happened?

323
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:56,912
- Yeah, can you believe it?

324
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,306
No severance, nothing,
just letters in our boxes

325
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,340
one morning.

326
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,342
I mean, is that right?

327
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,845
Two weeks notice after 14 years?

328
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,779
This is where we're
headed with this new

329
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,183
economy or whatever
they're calling it.

330
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,918
And after we've been
through all that with

331
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,354
the retirement accounts.

332
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,422
- What about 'em?

333
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,191
- Basically they forced
us to keep our retirement

334
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,659
in company stock.

335
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,903
- So what happened, did
the company went under

336
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:21,861
or what?

337
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,963
- No, after they laid
people off, I heard

338
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,899
they did fine, had
a profitable year.

339
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,640
So, you got something lined up?

340
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,575
You should have no
problem, at least you have

341
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,909
marketable skills.

342
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,848
Hey, maybe you could
call Greg Batenbelle,

343
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,685
whatever it is you
call him now, huh?

344
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,389
- Worry about your
own problems, OK?

345
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,358
- My own problems, huh?

346
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,698
I'm behind in everything, OK?

347
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,367
I had to sell the car.

348
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,669
The house is falling apart.

349
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,840
Temp work is two, three
days a week at best.

350
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,643
I don't know, Terrell, when
I was 20 years younger,

351
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,844
had big breasts...

352
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,846
- What are you talking about?

353
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,215
- It wasn't just downsizing.

354
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,019
He's a pig, you should see
them, these vulnerable,

355
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,821
desperate types.

356
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,790
- Who, I mean you're
talking about your boss?

357
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:24,823
- Yes.

358
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,428
Everyone knows what's going on.

359
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,601
(phone ringing)

360
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,705
- Can I help you?

361
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,008
- Yes, I was just
doing routine upgrades.

362
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,410
- Sarah let you in here?

363
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,511
- Yeah, she did.

364
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,679
- Well, I'm expecting a
conference call, she should

365
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,615
know that, reschedule.

366
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,550
So sort it out with her, OK?

367
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,583
- Yeah, OK.

368
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,859
(phone ringing)

369
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,401
- Do you understand?

370
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,003
- Right, I understand, but I...

371
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,841
- [Mom] Is that right?

372
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,709
Two weeks notice after 14 years.

373
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:20,012
Two weeks notice after 14 years.

374
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:24,016
- We might possibly be
able to work something out.

375
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,989
(moaning)

376
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,891
(laughs)

377
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:45,104
- Mr. Connors, I was
wondering about that phone.

378
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,374
- We might be able to
work something out.

379
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,708
After hours occasionally.

380
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,109
After hours occasionally.

381
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,142
Oh, yes.

382
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,414
You like that?

383
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,749
Working late tonight.

384
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,018
You're gonna get a nice big one.

385
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,120
Big Christmas bonus.

386
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,153
Christmas.

387
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,891
- I've been working
really hard, really hard.

388
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,360
- She does what she's
told, doesn't she?

389
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,562
(moaning)

390
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:11,964
Sugar bonus.

391
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,601
You can go now, Sarah.

392
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:15,902
Go now, Sarah.

393
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:16,936
That's fine.

394
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,151
- [Voiceover] Every action has

395
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,978
an equal and opposite reaction.

396
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,081
Newton's third law.

397
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,017
You know, I liked that
shit the day I first

398
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,919
read about it in grade school.

399
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,388
I was convinced it could
be like some guiding

400
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,890
principle of my life.

401
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,926
But as I got older,
it just, it got less

402
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,127
and less true.

403
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,797
'Cause it just
doesn't tell you shit

404
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,999
about dealing with people.

405
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,439
No equation or code
could ever factor in all

406
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,642
the jealousies,
fears, guilt, the ego.

407
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,115
That shit's more
like rolling dice.

408
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,920
(beeping)

409
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,158
- What is this?

410
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,191
- Titties.

411
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,871
(beeping)

412
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,077
- Damn.

413
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,452
Been a while, right?

414
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:44,090
- Yeah, it's definitely
been a while.

415
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,925
- Hey, it's good
to see you, man.

416
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,494
- Man, you, too.

417
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,997
- How you doing, hey.

418
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,040
Let me show you around.

419
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,942
- Oh, yeah, yeah, cool.

420
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:05,478
- Just picked up a new server.

421
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,182
- Oh, shit.

422
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,054
- I got it about a month ago.

423
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,930
You remember all that?

424
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,865
It's obsolete shit now.

425
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:28,968
Come on.

426
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:44,016
I don't even know
where to begin.

427
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,151
- Me neither.

428
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,060
- History.

429
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:59,566
- So, do you really want
to talk about history?

430
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,001
- Yeah, OK, go ahead.

431
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,037
- You ain't got anything to say?

432
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,674
- If it's an apology
you're looking for, no.

433
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:08,708
No, I don't.

434
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:18,551
So, since then, since
then, where you been?

435
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:21,020
- Doing my own thing, travel.

436
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,996
Looks like you're
doing all right.

437
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,030
- Surviving.

438
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,640
- Look, man.

439
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:41,950
Do you think it's possible
that you could slide

440
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,043
me in on something?

441
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,244
- You serious?

442
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:47,746
- Yeah.

443
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:51,117
I need to help my mom out.

444
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,753
- It's ugly out there, right?

445
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:00,893
- Tell me if you got part
time or whatever you got.

446
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,231
You know I can do it.

447
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,902
- They're all nervous,
anxious, trying to protect

448
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,204
their proprietary
applications, they've been

449
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,674
hacked three or four
times in the last year.

450
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:17,343
Typical financial
service company.

Colombian grad student
fishing around for a sexy

452
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,350
topic for a thesis, she
comes in and interviews

453
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,652
all the time.

454
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:27,930
Check this out, she's
the daughter of some

455
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:30,690
congressman from Connecticut.

456
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:33,059
Come on, I'll introduce you.

457
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,929
Everybody, this is Terrell.

458
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:41,901
A dinosaur you may have heard
him, he used to go by Blaze.

459
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,102
- You serious?

460
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:48,074
- Seriously, you should
interview this guy,

461
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,709
get that historical perspective.

462
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:50,910
- I'd love to.

463
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,948
Hi, I'm Olivia.

464
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:58,985
- Hey.

465
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,058
- Yeah, I'm doing my
dissertation on hacker culture.

466
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,089
The ethics, motivations.

467
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,927
- Hey, what's this
you guys are watching?

468
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,929
- It's this clip that
was posted this morning.

469
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,899
It's a video of a CEO getting
on with his secretary.

470
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,934
- Yo, this shit is fucked up.

471
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,969
- They just gave a press
conference, I guess

472
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:18,437
the board forced him to resign.

473
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,306
- Check this shit out.

474
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:25,111
- She's a good girl, she
does what she's told.

475
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,948
- It definitely has a to it.

476
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,285
- I see it right
here on the website.

477
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,088
Yes, that's the one
I want, the scarf.

478
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,356
The angora scarf.

479
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:47,934
Yes, that's the one I want,
the scarf, the angora scarf.

480
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,036
Why is this so difficult?

481
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,807
I have informed you that
yes, that's what I want,

482
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,076
the scarf, the angora scarf.

484
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,806
- Hey, you're up early.

485
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,775
- Yeah, working.

486
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,777
- That's great, what is it?

487
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,978
- Wall Street Hornton.

488
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,113
- No, come on,
seriously, what is it?

489
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,257
- System security,
I'm working for your

490
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,783
power grade depend.

491
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:40,452
- You see, you see
that, didn't I tell...

492
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,088
Well.

493
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,155
Sounds good.

494
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:46,325
- Yeah, well, should be
able to help you out now.

495
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,794
- I don't want to
be some kind of...

496
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,361
- Oh, come on, Mom, stop that.

497
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,396
- Get you some breakfast.

498
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,031
- No, no, I'm fine.

499
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,066
OK?

500
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,134
Just relax.

501
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,369
- I know, but listen,
when you do have a moment,

502
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,173
I'd love to catch up,
hear about your travels,

503
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,009
what you're up to.

504
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,410
- OK, I will.

505
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,012
For now I gotta go.

506
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,079
- Go on, then.

507
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:10,816
Good luck.

508
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,266
- [Voiceover] See, if you
ain't wearing the right

509
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,092
Works Brother tie, or
you don't got the right

510
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:23,195
Uncle Tom MBA from
Harvard, then you're

511
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:26,098
just another bike
messenger delivering shit.

512
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:30,302
But see, if you flip it,
hold the mirror up to them,

513
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,073
then see who perceives what.

514
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,251
See how they come across when
they ain't focus grouped,

515
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,946
Photoshop isn't in their
most flattering light.

(hip hop music)

517
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,175
- You stop pussy footing
around and pull the

518
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,533
goddamn trigger?

519
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,538
Guy's a fucking retard.

520
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,507
Yeah, yeah, what
can I do for you?

521
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,310
- System security,
Terrell Lussen.

522
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,343
- And?

523
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,916
- And I'm not sure
what you mean.

524
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,326
- Come on, guy, do I look
like a goddamn computer

525
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,119
department to you?

526
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,889
- Well, I thought because
the receptionist just

527
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:25,157
told me that you were the
person I was supposed to see.

528
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:29,395
- Down the hall, all the way
down the hall on the right.

529
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,031
On the right side, you'll
see Tim Bellweather's office.

530
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,000
He's the head egghead.

531
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,067
- Thanks.

532
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,169
- Fucking morons.

533
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,478
- Excuse me, did you
just say something?

534
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,014
- What?

535
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,249
- I could have sworn
you just said something.

536
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,284
- God, what are
you talking about?

537
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:53,252
- Did you say something?

538
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,954
- What, you want me too?

539
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,089
You're a frigging nutjob,
OK, and by the way,

540
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:59,134
nice frigging outfit, what
is this, dress down Tuesday

541
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,158
or something?

542
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:05,097
You know what, have a
little self respect, son.

543
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:10,136
(hip hop music)

544
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,296
- What the fuck are you doing?

545
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,497
- I'm working.

546
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,402
- They're threatening
to drop the contract.

547
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,038
They're one of my
biggest clients.

548
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,107
- The guy's an asshole, man.

549
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,310
- Look, undermine
you're own shit, OK?

550
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:53,912
But I did you a favor.

551
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:56,048
- Oh, come on, man,
don't act all innocent.

552
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,192
Don't act like I
don't know how you get

553
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:58,517
your clients in the first place.

554
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,153
- You don't know shit, OK?

555
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,022
- You're right, I
don't know shit.

556
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,656
- Look, I know you're
still upset about

557
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,358
Safe Circle, OK?

558
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,194
I was upset, too.

559
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,196
But you have got to get over it.

560
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,198
- Oh, man, come on,
man, are you done?

561
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:13,399
- No, I'm not.

562
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,103
My clients don't have shit
to do with what happened, OK?

563
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,106
You can't fucking
lash out at people.

564
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:22,074
Why don't you take it up
with Heston if you're so

565
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,108
pissed off?

566
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,150
(hip hop music)

567
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,165
- No, evaluation's off, way off.

568
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:23,069
Check last year's numbers
again, yeah, hold on a second.

569
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:24,503
Yeah.

570
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,638
- 'Sup, man, how's it going?

571
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,340
- Do I know you?

572
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,176
- I don't know, do you?

573
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,453
- Look, buddy, what do you want?

574
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:32,711
I'm on the phone.

575
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,213
- So, you haven't a good one?

576
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,214
- What?

577
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,215
- Are you having a good day?

578
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,483
A successful day.

579
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,686
- Charles, let me
call you right back.

580
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,189
Do I know you?

581
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,159
You worked at the club, right?

582
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,061
- Yeah, the club.

583
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:50,829
Maybe that's it.

584
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,407
So, what's up, man,
did you fuck anybody

585
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:53,799
out of their idea today?

586
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,067
- What?

587
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,335
Who the hell are you?

588
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,080
- I'm just interested
in whether you made bank

589
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,172
off of someone else's sweat?

590
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,173
- Bank.

591
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,074
- Yeah, bank.

592
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,451
You know, I'm just
interested, I mean,

593
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,111
did you out contract
anybody today?

594
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:06,112
(laughs)

595
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:07,155
- No, no, actually I didn't.

596
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,115
But if I had, I certainly
wouldn't discuss it

597
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,249
with someone like you.

598
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,450
- Yeah, how come?

599
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,195
I mean, do you like keeping
the common man in the dark?

600
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,488
- The common man, is
that what you are?

601
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,759
- Well, I guess you got me
pegged there, buddy, right?

602
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,869
Well, I got to be going,
man, I got to get back

603
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,095
to the club.

604
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,375
- [Voiceover] No, see, when
it's in their best interests,

605
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,169
they'll play like they're
you're best buddy for press.

606
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:33,639
They told me I was God's
gift, acting like I be playing

607
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,142
golf with them every
Sunday at the country club,

608
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,710
going on dates with
their society daughters.

609
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:43,182
But see, there's a fine
print in those contracts.

610
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,626
That's the shit you're
blind to when they're

611
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,586
wining and dining you,
talking stock options.

612
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:51,157
And while you're blinded
by the glitz and glamour,

613
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,759
they keeping their
eyes on the end game.

614
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,727
Which basically involves
sucking you dry of

615
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,696
all the tech know how
you got, and then kicking

616
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:58,864
you to the curb.

617
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,634
- They were the
size of watermelons.

618
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,669
- Yo, homie.

619
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,604
- Fake.

620
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:06,637
- Yo, yo.

621
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,410
I got a couple more
questions for you.

622
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,613
How much is it that
you make, anyway?

623
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,382
- Hold on a second.

624
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:17,583
Are you following me?

625
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,826
- I mean, you make a
good living, right?

626
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,852
- I'm comfortable, yes.

627
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,822
Now get the hell out of my face.

628
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,225
Steve, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

629
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,860
- I'm sorry, man,
what's your name again?

630
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,862
- Cindy, it's Richard,
where's the fucking car?

631
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:31,863
There's no one down here.

632
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,400
- Richard, Richard, OK,
OK, and what is it that

633
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:35,501
you do again?

634
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:37,769
Oh, come on, man, look.

635
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,939
I work at the club, I moonlight
as a messenger sometimes,

636
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,541
so what is it that you do?

637
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,911
Are you like a bond
trader or something?

638
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,847
- I'm a VC, a
venture capitalist.

639
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,216
- That's right, you are.

640
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:51,917
It's coming back,
it's coming back.

641
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,984
- OK, listen, asshole.

642
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,354
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

643
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,655
And I don't have the time.

644
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,658
So fucking leave me alone.

645
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:03,161
- All right, it's
cool man, I hear you.

646
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,397
Oh, oh, except for
one thing, man.

647
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:06,865
You say comfortable.

648
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,401
What exactly does that
mean, because I mean,

649
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:11,237
how much is that, is
that like a million,

650
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,872
a million five, 2,000,000,
I mean, say when when

651
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:14,840
I get there.

652
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:15,907
3,000,000?

653
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,510
Oh, come on, man, what,
you're embarrassed

654
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:20,712
to say it out loud?

655
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,257
If you want, you could
write it down, you know?

656
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,915
Send me a little note.

657
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:32,791
So.

658
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,326
- What the fuck are you doing?

659
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,003
Vinny, get him out of the
car, he's not with me.

660
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,667
- Sir, can you please
step out of the car?

661
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,773
- Hold on, I got a
few more questions.

662
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:42,334
Do you think it's fair
that you make all this cash

663
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,703
all from other people's ideas?

664
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,406
- All I know is I work
hard for the money I make.

665
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,007
Now leave me alone.

666
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,610
- OK, OK, God chill, chill man.

667
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,413
I just wanted to chat.

668
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,481
You know?

669
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:56,824
You could have asked me
questions, too, made this

670
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,984
sort of a two way sort of thing.

671
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:01,853
'Cause you just might be
interested in my background.

672
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,590
And in what we have in common.

673
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,892
You have a good day.

674
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,260
- I'm comfortable, yeah.

675
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:09,461
The common man.

676
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:10,762
The common man.

677
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:12,264
Is that what you are?

678
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:15,434
- I guess you got me
pegged there buddy, right?

679
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:19,638
Well, I got to be going, man,
I got to get back to the club.

680
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:26,854
- [Richard] I'm
comfortable, I work hard

681
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,047
for the money I make.

682
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,249
A venture capitalist.

683
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:51,837
- Good morning.

684
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,375
You know what, man, I'm
not totally satisfied.

685
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,076
- The hell's the
matter with you? Fuck.

686
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,479
- I don't know, I guess
I'm just still fixated

687
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,848
on what someone like you makes.

688
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,916
You know, your salary.

689
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,518
So, come on, Rich,
how do you feel?

690
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:08,820
- Don't you fucking touch me.

691
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:11,723
If I fucking see you
again, I will kick your

692
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,693
fucking ass, do
you understand me?

693
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:15,994
Do you understand me?

694
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,063
- Yes, I do understand you.

695
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,000
Shit, man, you don't need
to get violent with me.

696
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,044
I was just asking questions.

697
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,068
- Shut up.

698
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,406
Where do I know you from?

699
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:31,910
- See, I thought you'd
know, but I guess we all

700
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,513
look kind of similar, don't we?

701
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,651
So, you grew up
with cash, right?

702
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:40,986
- No, no.

703
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,355
I grew up middle class,
now get the fuck out

704
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,990
of here before I call security.

705
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:45,957
- You grew up middle
class, like Donald Trump

706
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,859
grew up middle class,
is that what you're

707
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,395
trying to say man?

708
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,364
Shit.

709
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:55,634
- I see you again,
you're fucking dead.

710
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,570
2,000,000, OK?

711
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:00,972
I made $2,000,000 last
year, that satisfy

712
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,009
your twisted little
fucked up mind?

713
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:08,013
More than you'll ever make
in a lifetime, all right?

714
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:11,717
- So, you give to
charity, right?

715
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,750
- Charity.

716
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:17,355
As a matter of fact we
do, we give to charity.

717
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,427
Benefits, we go to
benefits all the time.

718
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,662
So little black kids
don't end up becoming real

719
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,697
fucking freaks like you.

720
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,405
- Fuck 'em if we do, right?

721
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:35,907
Just like that Safe Circle deal.

722
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,415
- Cindy, it's Richard, where's

723
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,783
the fucking car?

724
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,487
It's the car, OK?

725
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,960
As a matter of fact we
do, we give to charity.

726
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,631
I'm comfortable, yes.

727
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,667
I'm a VC, a venture capitalist.

728
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,502
I made $2,000,000 last year.

729
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,671
You understand me?

730
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,172
A bonus of three
and a half million.

731
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,440
I grew up middle class.

732
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:10,041
You work at the club, right?

733
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,877
Is that who you
are, the common man?

734
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,046
As a matter of fact, we
do, we give to charity.

735
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,015
Benefits, we go to
benefits all the time.

736
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,117
(yelling)

737
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,895
So little black kids don't
end up becoming little

738
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,454
fucking freaks.

739
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:23,455
Are you following me?

740
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,456
I'm a VC.

741
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,524
You understand me?

742
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:26,968
I'm comfortable, comfortable
venture capitalist.

743
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:29,628
I make more than your
sorry ass will ever make

744
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,829
in a lifetime.

745
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:34,609
- Do you see what I'm saying?

746
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,802
- Well, it's captured something.

747
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:40,739
Some genuine sentiment
but it certainly doesn't

748
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,175
constitute a model yet.

749
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,011
- OK, right.

750
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:49,681
But think of the implications
for environmental activism,

751
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:51,216
anti globalism efforts.

752
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,884
- Now.

753
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,686
- Professor, WTO protests.

754
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,187
- Wait a second.

755
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,890
If you want to construct
your thesis around internet

756
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:01,793
activism or even hacker
culture, that's good,

757
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:05,897
that's fine, it fits well
within the department's perview.

758
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:08,233
But this is, it's scattershot.

759
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,937
You need to be patient.

760
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,674
You know, see how it plays out.

761
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,043
See if the media gets behind it.

762
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:22,247
Propagates with the more
radical communities, right?

763
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:24,983
- Right.

764
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:28,587
Thank you so much for your time.

765
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,790
- Look, Olivia,
here's the real issue.

766
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:36,227
These people, this
person, whomever it is,

767
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,229
what they're doing is
only relevant if you

768
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,766
or somebody else
makes it relevant.

769
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:44,636
Otherwise, it's just
fleeting digital chatter.

770
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:47,272
Random noise, right?

771
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:50,976
- Right.

772
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,947
(tense music)

773
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:44,029
- OK, so you did know him.

774
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,965
- Right, but didn't
figure it out 'til later.

775
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:49,034
His hair is different.

776
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,981
Turns out he was a minor
player in a deal my friend

777
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,741
structured a number
of years back.

778
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,976
- Structured, meaning what?

779
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,078
- We provided seed
capital, eventually assumed

780
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,047
the managerial oversight.

781
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,281
- And the deal went sour.

782
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,951
- Depends, depends
who you talk to.

783
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:06,985
- You forced him out.

784
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:08,018
- No, look.

785
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,924
They developed this
surveillance technology.

786
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:16,094
Very sophisticated,
but had no clue,

787
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,997
absolutely no idea
how to grow a company.

788
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,832
Horrible people skills.

789
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,968
He was 19, maybe 20, tops.

790
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:25,136
- Mr. Heston, please,
was he asked to leave or

791
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,005
did he go voluntarily?

792
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:29,808
- Asked.

793
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,977
He was asked to leave.

794
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,155
But he was compensated, he
was paid for the programming

795
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,180
work he did.

796
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,351
- There we go.

797
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,823
Have you seen this?

798
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,128
- Yeah, just not this
particular article.

799
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,730
- What do you think?

800
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,999
- I'm not sure yet, you?

801
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:56,234
- It's not as tight as
it could be, the concept,

802
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,270
but I think that
it's got potential.

803
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,238
- Tight.

804
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,107
- Yeah, it could be
stronger thematically.

805
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,876
I think that it could be
a real mode of critique.

806
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,946
- So, what do you want to know?

807
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,782
- I guess let's start with
some background information.

808
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:12,818
Tell me about growing
up, being a part of the

809
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:16,421
hacker community, how
you got involved in it.

810
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:20,892
- Well, I was your
classic latchkey kid.

811
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:24,996
My mother really wanted me
to do better for myself,

812
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,298
so she got me a computer.

813
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:32,070
And then, why are you so
interested in all this?

814
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,138
- Let's stick with you.

815
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,473
- I thought this
was a conversation.

816
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:40,011
- OK, so, when did you first
start accessing systems?

817
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:42,914
Accessing information
that wasn't yours?

818
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:46,251
And what did it feel
like that first time?

819
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:54,825
What?

820
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:59,397
- Greg tells me I can trust you.

821
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,966
- Yeah, you can.

822
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:02,934
- Why?

823
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:05,236
- Because you can.

824
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,938
It's just a fact.

825
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:07,972
- Stop.

826
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,510
You want to know something?

827
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,112
I know this guy.

828
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,113
- Don't even joke.

829
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,982
- I'm not joking.

830
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:18,049
I grew up with him.

831
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,350
It's a small community.

832
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,820
- Do you think you can
set me up with him?

833
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:23,421
You think you can
get me an interview?

834
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,756
- Maybe, why?

835
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:28,335
- One more of these,
if it's done right,

836
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:32,163
and it's front page,
this is prime time news.

837
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:35,266
- Excuse me, what do
you mean done right?

838
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,434
- OK.

839
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,970
One thing that I've
been thinking about.

840
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:41,206
Can you imagine if you
were to reconfigure

841
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:45,243
the sites that had a more
decentralized structure.

842
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,846
Like, a structure that
lets others submit their

843
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:48,746
confessions, too.

844
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,250
Stuff that they've
forced from people.

845
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,485
Seriously, I need
to talk to this guy.

846
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:55,519
- OK.

847
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,133
Why don't you let me
borrow that camera for like

848
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:00,458
a day or two?

849
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,726
- OK.

850
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,362
- Maybe I can get him to video
himself talking or something.

851
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:06,397
- Yeah, take it.

852
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,801
(contemplative music)

853
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:34,125
- Get your shit and get out.

854
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,962
- Man, what are
you talking about?

855
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:38,864
- I don't know you.

856
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,999
I haven't seen you in years.

857
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:49,007
- Where'd you get this?

858
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,575
- I downloaded it.

859
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,143
It's everywhere.

860
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,521
- What, you felt the
need to Google me first

861
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,981
thing in the morning?

862
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:57,324
- What did you do?
- [Terrell] Nothing.

863
00:46:57,348 --> 00:47:00,118
- Well, I hope you can
understand why I can't

864
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,987
have you here because
I can't jeopardize my

865
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,954
whole shit.

866
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:05,390
- OK, man, you know,
it's not the first time

867
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,257
this shit has happened.

868
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:08,226
- Oh, man, don't
fucking go there again.

869
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,594
Man.

870
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:13,064
Come on, look, I know
when Safe Circle imploded

871
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:15,333
that I did not respond properly.

872
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,836
- Respond properly,
are you kidding me?

873
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:23,041
You just sat back and
watched me get pushed out.

874
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:24,919
You didn't do anything,
you didn't respond at all.

875
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:27,054
- Yeah, and then I got pushed
out the door two months later.

876
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:29,580
You should be happy that
you got out when you did.

877
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,492
- Because you built this
place up by yourself, right?

878
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,583
From nothing.

879
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,455
Yeah, I should be happy.

880
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:38,489
- Look.

881
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,058
Look.

882
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,459
- Get out of my way, Greg.

883
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:45,863
- I just want you to know
that if it starts to look

884
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:51,269
really bad and you really
need something, I don't know.

885
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:56,641
Money or something, I'll
do what I can to help you.

886
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,087
- Excuse me.

887
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:19,064
(chatter)

888
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:34,079
(doorbell ringing)

889
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,551
- Hi, Miss Lessor?

890
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:41,352
- Yes.

891
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:44,289
- Agents David and
McAllistor, FBI.

892
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:46,424
We'd like to speak with
you about, is it your son?

893
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,026
Terrell Lessor?

894
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,394
- Yes, is he OK?

895
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:52,039
- That's what we need
to speak to you about,

896
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:54,499
Miss Lessor, it seems
he's in a bit of trouble.

897
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,243
- We're gonna have to ask
you to come with us, ma'am.

898
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,303
Apologies for that.

899
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:03,041
I also have a warrant here
to search your premises.

900
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,010
- Come on, you bitch.

901
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:08,113
That's right, look at me.

902
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:09,514
Yeah.

903
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:10,547
All right.

904
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,152
- Come on, come on, yeah.

905
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,024
- That's the one I want.

906
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,092
That's the one I want.

907
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,126
- Fuck.

908
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,363
- [Kid] OK, die.

909
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,564
- [Woman] Yes.

910
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,502
Yes, that's the one I want.

911
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:32,970
- OK, yeah, OK.

912
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:36,574
- Yes.

913
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,143
(laughs)

914
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:39,310
Why is this so difficult?

915
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:40,311
- OK, die.

916
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:43,014
- I see it right here,
that's the one I want.

917
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:44,249
- OK, yeah, yeah.

918
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:45,783
- Yes.

919
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,419
Scarf, the angora scarf.

920
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:52,190
Item 4122, yes,
that's the one I want.

921
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:55,193
- Never saw that
coming, did you?

922
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:58,128
- Mexico.

923
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,065
Maybe it's Mexico.

924
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:03,601
I remember him saying
he'd been traveling.

925
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,177
I think he blames me
for always pushing.

926
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:17,148
I pushed him too
hard all the time.

927
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:20,318
- It's obvious that
he had options.

928
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,552
It seems clear.

929
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:23,388
- You know they forced them out?

930
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,132
Literally came into work
one morning and they

931
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,058
escorted him out
of the building.

932
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:30,561
- We're aware of this, Miss
Lessor, it's documented.

933
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:33,798
- It's what happened after
that, where we need your help.

934
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,667
Now, maybe Mexico isn't
quite the level of detail

935
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:37,668
that we're looking for.

936
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:41,639
- No, uh uh, unless you
tell me what you know.

937
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,210
What happened to him?

938
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,179
Get a lawyer.

939
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:50,748
I walk out.

940
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:54,119
- Actually, you won't,
Miss Lessor, the things is,

941
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:57,222
as a material witness,
under the anti-terrorism

942
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:59,257
legislation, we're at
liberty to keep you...

943
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,290
- Jim.

944
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:05,296
Why don't you get us
a round of coffee?

945
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,799
I'll take a bran muffin.

946
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:14,139
Miss Lessor, is there
something we can get you?

947
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:18,943
Apologies, ma'am.

948
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:23,148
As you can imagine, the
agency's overworked these days.

949
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:27,152
It impacts some of
us more than others.

950
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,819
- Let him know we
have a file on him

951
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:31,122
as a juvenile, remind
her that we know about

952
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:33,791
the bank hacks and
the DOD of '93.

953
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:43,668
- Here's my read
on the situation.

954
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:47,238
Terrell's gonna end up
in prison sometime soon.

955
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:51,442
Now, I'd wager, based on not
that many years of experience,

956
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:56,881
but I'd wager, that computer
skills won't do much for him

957
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,583
in maximum security.

958
00:52:00,185 --> 00:52:01,185
Day to day.

959
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,621
Survival wise.

960
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,558
- Look, Miss Lessor,
the bottom line is

961
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:10,195
if we can get to Terrell
before someone gets hurt,

962
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:13,464
gets killed, there's a
chance we might be able

963
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:14,865
to work something out.

964
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:17,935
But in order for that
to happen, you're gonna

965
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,870
have to help us.

966
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:22,373
We're gonna need you
to give us a name.

967
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:25,243
Anything to help
us find your son.

968
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,279
Now we're gonna step
out for a minute.

969
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:30,548
You think about it.

970
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,517
Write something down.

971
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,918
Anything.

972
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:36,721
Something for us to go on.

973
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:40,691
At this point, it's in
Terrell's best interest.

974
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,933
(melancholy music)

975
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:05,526
- Can you believe these people?

976
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,852
- Yeah, except they're
more like victims.

977
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,230
It's not like the
businessman on the bus

978
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:10,821
fucking his secretary.

979
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:13,291
People are going to think
that this is depressing.

980
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:14,392
- What?

981
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:15,893
What makes these people victims?

982
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,362
- What did they do?

983
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:19,430
- Come on, man, look
at this guy, come on.

984
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:21,466
- He makes a stronger
case when they come across

985
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,268
as crass or arrogant.

986
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,304
He shows that they've
manipulated people's lives

987
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:27,972
for their own benefit.

988
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:30,641
- OK, hold on.

989
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:32,609
All right.

990
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,716
Got something for you.

991
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:44,889
I got him to answer
your questions.

992
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,691
- You said that you
hadn't seen him.

993
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,959
- Yeah, no, but then I
saw him after we talked.

994
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:50,528
Now look, don't get too excited.

995
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,631
He had to run, so
it's kind of short.

996
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:55,800
- Wait.

997
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,402
I can't hear what
you're asking him.

998
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:59,904
- I'm asking him your questions.

999
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:05,310
- I have targets in mind,
people, dates, places.

1000
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:06,844
Political figures.

1001
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:10,881
- What, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

1002
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,384
- That's so fucked up.

1003
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:14,928
What, I mean, do you really
think that I wouldn't

1004
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:15,952
recognize you?

1005
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,332
You have the same voice,
you're wearing the

1006
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:19,890
same fucking necklace.

1007
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,592
Get your shit and get out.

1008
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:23,561
- OK, wait, wait, wait, hold up.

1009
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,805
- This isn't some
fucking joke to me.

1010
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,331
- It's not a joke
to me, neither.

1011
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:28,966
OK, I'm serious,
this is actually me.

1012
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,068
- You know what, just get
the fuck out of my house.

1013
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,101
- OK.

1014
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:38,943
All right, I can show
you the site, I can show

1015
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:41,512
you the footage, I got it
all on top of my laptop,

1016
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:42,713
all right?

1017
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:44,982
Now look, you know what I
was working on earlier today?

1018
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,685
I was working on this
whole idea where others can

1019
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:49,095
submit their own
footage to the site,

1020
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,757
you know, kind of like
a whole submit section.

1021
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,790
Your idea.

1022
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:00,898
- So, the dread thing?

1023
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,368
- Yeah, that hurt.

1024
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:06,537
- She did say you did look good.

1025
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:09,306
(ethereal music)

1026
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:36,767
Come on, I just fucked you.

1027
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:40,004
God, at least give me a hint.

1028
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,941
Well.

1029
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,876
I have some ideas, too.

1030
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:51,782
I think that we should
generate a list.

1031
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:55,986
Target individuals that
represent larger themes.

1032
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,956
Sort of like societal
archetypes, you know?

1033
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,858
- That's good, good.

1034
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:03,694
- You just saying that?

1035
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:07,031
- No, no, I mean, you
know, hey, it's basically

1036
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:09,934
going in that direction, anyway.

1037
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:10,967
- Yeah.

1038
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:17,374
Hey, do you need
money for anything?

1039
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:19,976
- What?

1040
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:22,747
- Because you were saying
something about not

1041
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,890
wanting to work
for Greg anymore.

1042
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:28,986
- Yeah, I'm definitely not
working for Greg anymore.

1043
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,955
Are you serious?

1044
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,022
- Yeah.

1045
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:37,728
- OK, well, I could use
some extra equipment for

1046
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:40,531
the next one, but
I'm gonna need,

1047
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:47,605
maybe a thousand man, that's
only if you can spare that.

1048
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:48,638
- Done.

1049
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,409
(hip hop music)

1050
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:09,025
- Let's go.

1051
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,809
- This is a story
about a sell out.

1052
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:27,512
The cracker, Glenace Bennett.

1053
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:28,913
Fits all their expectations.

1054
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:31,048
Policy advisor to the president

1055
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:33,651
of the United States of America.

1056
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,620
Let me tell you

conference because we need

1209
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:10,107
So, we'll draft something.

bounces like I thought...

1216
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:46,343

1222
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:01,391

1225
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:10,200
It changes locations
like every 20 minutes.

1226
01:06:10,234 --> 01:06:12,236
And they're foreign
hosts, so unless you take

1227
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:16,273
whole regions, like
whole countries offline,

1228
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,475
I don't know how to do it.

1229
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:31,055

01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,160
Wall Street assets, cyber
attacks on the Pentagon,

1232
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:38,662
defacement of government
websites, but it's more

1233
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:41,498
malevolent and far
more dangerous.

1234
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:44,368
This is a form of terrorism,
there's no question

1235
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:46,770
about that, a new and
very troubling breed

1236
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:48,472
of terrorism.

1237
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:49,306
- [Voiceover] Any indication
where the website host

1238
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,339
is located?

1239
01:06:51,275 --> 01:06:53,110
- [Olivia] You've seen
this guy before, right?

1240
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:55,312
- Not really, no that one.

1241
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:58,482
- [Allan] Say on this time
that we will apprehend...

1242
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,126
- I read that he's taking
some leadership position

1243
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,086
at Homeland Security.

1244
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:05,722
We should go after him.

1245
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,325
Like a fucking coo, right?

1246
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,260
- That was Allan Keller,
lead prosecutor from

1247
01:07:10,294 --> 01:07:13,397
the attorney general's
office, here in New York.

1248
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,132
- Seriously.

1249
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:18,768
You take it to the
next level with him.

1250
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:20,737
It's going there.

1251
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,106
It's got to go there.

1252
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,674
- No, it doesn't
have to do shit.

1253
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:30,180
- You think that no
one's gonna get hurt?

1254
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:32,649
That violence doesn't enter
the game plan at some point?

1255
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:33,750
- No.

1256
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,319
We make the decisions.

1257
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:37,421
And we don't have to follow
any model, precedent,

1258
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:42,092
or whatever the hell else
you want to call it, OK?

1259
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:44,728
Shit ain't predetermined.

1260
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,496
- Where are you going?

1261
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,233
(tense music)

1262
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,151
- Oh, God.

1263
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:09,886
- OK, OK, OK, Mom, stop,
stop, you can't make a scene.

1264
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:10,887
OK?

1265
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,122
- I understand.

1266
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,224
- I'm fine, really.

1267
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:15,259
- You sure?

1268
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,293
- Yeah, really.

1269
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:17,403
- You know they're on to you.

1270
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,504
You know that, right, the FBI?

1271
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:19,528
- Yes, yes.

1272
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:22,266
- Came to the house, Terrell.

1273
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:24,434
They took all your stuff.

1274
01:08:24,468 --> 01:08:26,370
They held me overnight.

1275
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:30,574
- I'm sorry.

1276
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:35,312
- It's just a question of
time, that's the situation.

1277
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:37,181
Not if, Terrell, when.

1278
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,150
- What did you tell them?

1279
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:41,494
- I already lost your
father, I'm not going to lose

1280
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:43,153
you, too, OK?

1281
01:08:43,187 --> 01:08:44,154
- I got to get out of here.

1282
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:46,190
- No, no, you listen to me.

1283
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:47,457
- What?

1284
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:50,227
- After your father
died, I swore I would do

1285
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,330
everything I could to
give you what you needed

1286
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:57,434
to survive, the skills to
get ahead in this life.

1287
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,636
- I don't have time to
listen to this right now.

1288
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:02,772
- Terrell, and you have
them, you have them

1289
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:04,908
and you are wasting them.

1290
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,744
What are you even doing?

1291
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:09,413
You've never been
a political person.

1292
01:09:09,446 --> 01:09:11,348
- What I'm doing
is having impact.

1293
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:15,385
I'm exposing these assholes
for who they really are.

1294
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:17,721
The media's all
over this story now.

1295
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:18,722
- The media.

1296
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:20,557
Terrell, it's a freak show.

1297
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,193
An abduction, a batting,
anything to fill the pages,

1298
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:24,361
the airwaves.

1299
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,196
- OK, what about the
articles I sent you?

1300
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:30,634
Your boss, your boss resigned
because of what I did.

1301
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,869
- He had two months
before retirement.

1302
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:35,205
They gave him a full
benefits package.

1303
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:37,274
Somebody even told me
that he bought a big house

1304
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:38,375
down in Florida.

1305
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:41,211
His wife didn't even leave him.

1306
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,217
You can work out a deal.

1307
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:52,589
That's what the agents
I talked to said.

1308
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,895
- I just came to see if
you're OK, all right?

1309
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:03,500
You can take this.

1310
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,236
- No, no, no, I don't want that.

1311
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,447
I want to know that
you're not gonna end up

1312
01:10:07,471 --> 01:10:08,805
in jail or dead.

1313
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:13,810
Do you even hear
a word I'm saying?

1314
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:21,217
Sweet boy.

1315
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:24,554
- I got to go.

1316
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,930
(crying)

1317
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:59,556
- I'm waiting on
something, Senator.

1318
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,057
- I guess it's
like I said before.

1319
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:01,891
- You didn't say
anything before,

1320
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,528
you were evasive before.

1321
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:07,864
- Well, ultimately, if
a constituency does not

1322
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:11,768
support foreign aid or
peacekeeping efforts,

1323
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,573
then I, as a US senator,
really don't have...

1324
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,942
- Yeah, assuming they're
getting the facts.

1325
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,019
Is that what you're saying?

1326
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:21,945
Your constituency, is
that what they're getting?

1327
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:24,681
- People want the facts bad
enough, they can get 'em.

1328
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:27,451
In the United States of
America, they can get 'em.

1329
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:30,787
Could we at least
cover my privates?

1330
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,021
Could we do that at least?

1331
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:33,899
- [Terrell] Why don't we try
answering the question first,

1332
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,959
Senator?
- [Senator] Christ.

1333
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,929
Now, of course, if you
got yourself killed, say,

1334
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:43,833
if you got martyred, well
that would be the best.

1335
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:46,936
That's better than even
going to jail because then

1336
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:50,039
some little elementary school
in the ghetto somewhere

1337
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:52,376
will get named after you.

1338
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:54,911
(grunting)

1339
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:56,580
- Son of a bitch.

1340
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,424
- [Voiceover] Maybe
I picked up a virus.

1341
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:09,859
The only way to really
shake things up is to have

1342
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,661
the establishment come
face to face with the

1343
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:13,597
barrel of a gun.

1344
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,665
Because technology's easy.

1345
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:16,666
It has rules.

1346
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,435
Discernible patterns.

1347
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:21,004
'Cause once you get people
impassioned is where

1348
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:22,772
shits starts to blur.

1349
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,876
- I mean, if they're starving
in them other places,

1350
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:27,877
let 'em starve.

1351
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:30,046
If they hump monkeys in
the jungles of Africa

1352
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,749
to get AIDs, then that's
their cross to bear.

1353
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:35,819
Look, could we cover
up my goddamn genitals?

1354
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,021
(chatter)

1355
01:12:39,623 --> 01:12:42,692
- I'm going to read
my statement now.

1356
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,760
Thank you.

1357
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,030
So here we go.

1358
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:53,136
The confess project is
about giving a voice to

1359
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:56,172
truths that are rarely heard.

1360
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,643
It's about learning the
behind the scenes reality

1361
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:01,745
from those who own the
means of production,

1362
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:04,147
manipulate the flow
of information,

1363
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,817
those who possess the
power to indiscriminately

1364
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:10,153
alter the course of our lives.

1365
01:13:13,757 --> 01:13:15,925
(beeping)

1366
01:13:18,928 --> 01:13:21,931
- I worked for the UN
for eight years and now

1367
01:13:21,965 --> 01:13:25,034
I work for the World
Trade Organization.

1368
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:25,902
- [Voiceover] Into the camera.

1369
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:28,104
- OK, OK, just please, OK.

1370
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:33,510
I work as a chief
intermediary between

1371
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:37,113
governments and
multinational firms.

1372
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,849
- [Voiceover] Tell
me about the money.

1373
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:43,453
- WTO believes that
democracy functions best,

1374
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:45,689
actually flourishes...
- [Voiceover] What?

1375
01:13:45,722 --> 01:13:48,024
- Flourishes in an
open market environment

1376
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:49,659
and that capitalism...

1377
01:13:49,693 --> 01:13:51,861
(gunshot)

1378
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:02,171
(sirens blaring)

1379
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:07,477
(intense music)

1380
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:24,928
- In keeping the
radical social justice

1381
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:28,031
movements of the past,
because it's high time

1382
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,734
to harness the frustration
out there and put

1383
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:34,003
principle and
theory into action.

1384
01:14:34,037 --> 01:14:35,037
Thank you.

1385
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,580
- Miss Alvero.

1386
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:49,052
(beeping)

1387
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,588
(tense music)

1388
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:58,628
- What?

1389
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,496
- Hurry up, let me in.

1390
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,104
Hey.

1391
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:09,138
(beeping)

1392
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:10,172
Greg.

1393
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:27,256
- There was quite a turnout
at your press conference.

1394
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:34,564
- You know who my
father is, right?

1395
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:36,833
- OK.

1396
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,101
All right, I'll see.

1397
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:40,069
Olivia, I'm Miss Bradford,
one of your father's

1398
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:42,772
attorneys, we met at
the trust disbursement.

1399
01:15:42,806 --> 01:15:45,041
He asked that I meet you here.

1400
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:47,577
(tense music)

1401
01:15:58,922 --> 01:15:59,922
- Shit.

1402
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:29,953
(applause)

1403
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:32,922
(melancholy music)

1404
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:57,013
(tense music)

1405
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,087
OK.

1406
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:06,421
I'm...

1407
01:17:09,826 --> 01:17:12,128
I'm talking now because
shit's happening that has

1408
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:13,697
nothing to do with me.

1409
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,340
I'm being blamed for
actions that I'm not even

1410
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:16,733
involved with.

1411
01:17:17,701 --> 01:17:19,368
Here's the deal.

1412
01:17:19,402 --> 01:17:24,073
If charges are dropped against
me, if I'm granted immunity,

1413
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:27,243
then I will stop the abductions.

1414
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:29,378
So, what's in it for you?

1415
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,148
- Conditional immunity
based upon my client's

1416
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:36,352
success in hacking other
sites deemed a dangerous,

1417
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:40,056
indefinite assistance
in targeting suspected

1418
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:44,060
activists, terrorists,
et cetera, and some

1419
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:47,764
as yet unspecified
public service type work.

1420
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:51,100
- A minimum of 1,000,000
for the film rights,

1421
01:17:51,134 --> 01:17:54,037
plus a piece of the back
end profits, that's minimum.

1422
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:57,006
That doesn't include tie-ins,
music, merchandising.

1423
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,443
- In branding our clients,
it's all about figuring out

1424
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,145
who they really are.

1425
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,181
Who you really are.

1426
01:18:05,214 --> 01:18:08,184
- You have a very fortunate
case in that you've done

1427
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,019
a lot of the branding already.

1428
01:18:10,053 --> 01:18:12,088
- Exactly, I mean, all
that's left for us to do

1429
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:16,192
is to help you shape
your more mature persona.

1430
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:18,094
How's all of this sound, huh?

1431
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:20,096
Do you have any questions?

1432
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:29,305
- You got a pen?

1433
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,010
Thanks.

1434
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:41,017
(ethereal music)

1435
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:54,297
(chatter)

1436
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:58,101
- Go to your house
without saying anything.

1437
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:01,905
Step back, come on, give
him room, give him room,

1438
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:04,107
step back, everybody, step back.

1439
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,010
Step back, everybody, come on.

1440
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:09,012
(chatter)

1441
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:11,179
Step back.

1442
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:16,786
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

1443
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,863
Mr. Lessor will have a
statement for you very shortly,

1444
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:22,191
in about five or 10 minutes,
please bare with us.

1445
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:30,333
- So, we just worked out a deal.

1446
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:39,075
(chatter)

1447
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:15,178
(hip hop music)

1448
01:20:19,082 --> 01:20:20,917
I've always been
deeply concerned with

1449
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,919
social justice issues.

1450
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:24,888
It's just at a certain
point, I realized that

1451
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:28,024
the potential for violence
and harm was just too great.

1452
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:30,593
- In our ongoing
reporting on Mr. Lessor,

1453
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:33,329
we recently unearthed
exclusive home video footage

1454
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:36,132
of more innocent times,
which we'd like to share

1455
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,266
with you now.

1456
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,003
- Terrell Lessor today
signed on as spokesperson for

1457
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:42,471
proactive floating line
campaign in a deal rumored

1458
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:45,108
to be in excess of $2,000,000.

1459
01:20:45,141 --> 01:20:48,011
- We all feel frustrated,
you know, sometimes, right?

1460
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:49,212
Powerless.

1461
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:51,223
- [Voiceover] This, in addition
to the book and movie deal

1462
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:52,448
already negotiated...

1463
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:55,018
- Oh, yeah, man, definitely
was trying to make a statement.

1464
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:56,595
I wanted to make people
question, I wanted to make

1465
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,387
people think differently
about things.

1466
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:00,890
- His managers indicate
that one of his first

1467
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:03,359
expenditures was paying
off his mother's mortgage

1468
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:06,095
and for a complete
redesign of her home.

1469
01:21:06,129 --> 01:21:10,066
- Well, now I'm just really
just trying to keep it real.

1470
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:11,935
I'm trying to speak out
against the people who

1471
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:13,212
took what I was doing
the wrong way and took it

1472
01:21:13,236 --> 01:21:14,403
to an extreme.

1473
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:20,176
(club music)

1474
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:40,229
- Hey, you're that guy, right?

1475
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:43,199
- No, probably not.

1476
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:46,335
- Yeah, you are,
the confess project.

1477
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:50,182
I just wanted to say I
really respected what you

1478
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:54,377
were doing, you totally had
something important to say.

1479
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,280
- Yeah, thank you.

1480
01:21:57,313 --> 01:21:58,714
- Oh, hey, wait.

1481
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,984
Can I get an autograph?

1482
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:04,020
I think I still
have it, yeah, here.

1483
01:22:08,191 --> 01:22:12,195
(hip hop music, sirens blaring)

1484
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:21,404
- I do not live the life of a
happy fucking celebrity, OK?

1485
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,376
It was my choice.

1486
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:29,012
It was my choice.

1487
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:33,349
10 years minimum with
no computer, nothing?

1488
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:39,288
What I was trying to do,
which was turn this into

1489
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:42,658
something else,
something positive.

1490
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,060
You played me.

1491
01:22:47,063 --> 01:22:49,041
- Investigators have yet to
issue a statement as to what

1492
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:52,201
exactly happened several
nights ago, outside this

1493
01:22:52,235 --> 01:22:53,169
Brooklyn motel.

1494
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:55,504
Apparently, the locale
where celebrity and

1495
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:58,307
counter culture icon
Terrell Lessor was staying.

1496
01:22:58,341 --> 01:23:01,144
At present, investigators
are indicating Mr. Lessor

1497
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:03,746
may, himself, have been
abducted, but are unwilling

1498
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:07,116
to disclose whether
they have any leads.

1499
01:23:09,218 --> 01:23:13,189
- I am not living the life of
a happy fucking celebrity, OK?

1500
01:23:15,758 --> 01:23:16,758
10 years.

1501
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:26,135
It was just at a certain
point, I realized the potential

1502
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:29,172
for violence and
harm was too great.

1503
01:23:30,806 --> 01:23:33,476
I was your classic latchkey kid.

1504
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,080
If you can flip, flip.

1505
01:23:39,082 --> 01:23:42,185
You're the fucking man,
the geek turned celebrity.

1506
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:44,720
(tense music)

1507
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:02,138
OK, so what do you want to know?

1508
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,073
Platform, yeah.

1509
01:24:04,107 --> 01:24:05,508
I can, it was my choice.

1510
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,643
10 years minimum
with no computer?

1511
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:08,877
Nothing?

1512
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:11,714
What I was trying to do, was
turn this into something else,

1513
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:13,216
something positive.

1514
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:15,418
Yeah, I've always
been interested in

1515
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:16,828
- [Voiceover] If you got
yourself killed, say,

1516
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:18,687
if you got yourself martyred...

1517
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:20,323
- I've talked, I've
talked about...

1518
01:24:20,356 --> 01:24:21,490
Consider truth.

1519
01:24:21,524 --> 01:24:24,393
Happy fucking
celebrity high life.

1520
01:24:24,427 --> 01:24:27,696
- [Voiceover] This
is a story right now.

1521
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,508
- I'm just trying to keep
it real, keep it real.

1522
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:31,510
The only way to get to the
truth is to, is to force

1523
01:24:31,534 --> 01:24:33,236
the establishment to
come face to face with

1524
01:24:33,269 --> 01:24:35,371
the barrel of gun, the
barrel of, the barrel of...

1525
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:37,573
(gunshot)

1526
01:24:51,387 --> 01:24:54,157
(upbeat music)
