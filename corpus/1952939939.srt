1
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:15,320
(thunder crashing)

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,123
(whirring, zapping)

3
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,684
[Woman]:
George, what are you doing?

4
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,387
[George]: The crazy neighbor next door
is up to something.

5
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:17,486
Come on, Zeus.
Let's go check it out.

6
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:29,435
(thunder crashing)

7
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,787
I'm telling you, buddy, ever since
we moved into our new home...

8
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:34,640
some weird things
have been happening.

9
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:35,541
(whines)

10
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:38,377
You know I have issues about going out
in thunder storms, right Georgie?

11
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:40,613
Oh, I know.
Let's go back inside...

12
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:43,382
'cause "The Real House Puppies
of Beverly Hills" is about to start.

13
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:45,785
Come on, buddy. You're not afraid
of a little thunder storm, are you?

14
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:47,620
Me? Afraid?

15
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:50,289
Come on, us Bannister men
got to stick together.

16
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,291
Okay.

17
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,126
(thunder crashes)

18
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:56,793
(groans)

19
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,735
You owe me a big steak
for this, George.

20
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:06,005
All right, back me up, buddy.
Back me up.

21
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,968
Back you up?
Who's gonna back me up?

22
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,245
- (thunder crashes)
- (Zeus screams)

23
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:16,315
(whining)

24
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:19,251
Can't we just come back
when the storm's over?

25
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:21,420
- Please?
- It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

26
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,916
I got a bad feeling about this.

27
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,599
Seems like there's someone
in there, buddy.

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,268
That's great.
Let's go. Come on.

29
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,770
(thunder crashes)

30
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,505
- Thunder! Aaah!
- Zeus, come on.

31
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:41,574
Zeus!

32
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:44,469
Zeus! Zeus!

33
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,480
(squeaking)

34
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,882
Bats!
(barking)

35
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,485
- Oh! Ah!
- [Zeus]: George, watch out!

36
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:55,221
- Cover your head.
- I hate this, I hate this, I hate this!

37
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:57,189
Ah!

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,791
I can't look.

39
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,860
[Woman]:
George, is that you?

40
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:03,128
Zeus, Zeus, I can't see.
I can't get this off my head.

41
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,530
Man:
Who's making all that noise

42
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,198
[Woman #2]:
Sounds like the new neighbor.

43
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,200
[Woman #3]:
Bruno, what are you doing?

44
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,135
[Bruno]:
I want to see what's going on.

45
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:12,471
Georgie, look out
for the tombstones.

46
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:14,039
Ow, ooh, my brain.

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,773
I'm coming, George.

48
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:21,180
- (growling)
- Georgie, look out.

49
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:23,142
- No!
- Medusa.

50
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,755
You tell that idiot
to stay out of our yard.

51
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,624
Oh yeah?
Well, I'm a former K9

52
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,894
and I smell probable cause.

53
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,989
(exhales)

54
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,606
I'm sorry, Georgie.
I heard the thunder and it scared me.

55
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:51,343
Oh, well, that could have
gone better.

56
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:54,380
Um, you might want to turn around.

57
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:56,046
[Woman]:
Ahem!

58
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,386
(yawns)

59
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:03,455
- [Man]: I don't believe this.
- [Woman]: Unbelievable.

60
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,591
Oh, hey, honey.

61
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,192
Did you get a haircut?

62
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,984
- Oh, George.
- Moron.

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,501
(thunder crashes)

64
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:19,505
¶ I was having a party
on Halloween ¶

65
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:22,641
¶ When some ghostly things
came to visit me ¶

66
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:26,245
¶ With chains and fangs
and bandaged heads ¶

67
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:29,515
¶ I couldn't tell
if they were live or dead ¶

68
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:33,352
¶ Boo, said the ghost,
aah, went the vampire ¶

69
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:36,889
¶ Awoo, said the werewolf
on the full moon rising ¶

70
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,192
¶ Zombies were moaning,
ghouls were groaning ¶

71
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:43,796
¶ No one's ever gonna
believe this story ¶

72
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,899
¶ Then when I saw
what happened next ¶

73
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,302
¶ I must say
I was quite perplexed ¶

74
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,706
¶ As I was sure
they would all eat me ¶

75
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:57,309
¶ But instead they came in
to join the party ¶

76
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,013
¶ Boo, said the ghost,
aah, went the vampire ¶

77
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:04,049
¶ Awoo, said the werewolf
on the full moon rising ¶

78
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,720
¶ Zombies were moaning,
ghouls were groaning ¶

79
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:11,390
¶ No one's ever gonna
believe this story ¶

80
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:14,660
¶ Boo, said the ghost,
aah, went the vampire ¶

81
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:18,063
¶ Awoo, said the werewolf
on the full moon rising ¶

82
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:21,200
¶ Zombies were moaning,
ghouls were groaning... ¶

83
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:24,036
[Woman]: George,
we've only lived here two months.

84
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:26,905
Do you know how hard I have worked
to try to get everyone to like us?

85
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,441
Looks like someone's in
the dog house now, Georgie.

86
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,410
Belinda, has it ever occurred to you

87
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,946
that maybe I'm trying
to protect this family?

88
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,849
You know, it's not like we moved out
of state. We moved three blocks.

89
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,184
I'll do better next time, George,
I promise.

90
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:42,688
It's just I was scared by the thunder
storm and the lightning.

91
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,289
I don't know what came over me.

92
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,458
It's all right, buddy.
It was probably just an accident.

93
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,762
Besides, something
did happen at that house.

94
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:52,297
- Did you actually see anything?
- Yeah, I did.

95
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:53,866
You know, a little bit.

96
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:55,701
I don't think a little bit
is gonna hold up in court.

97
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:58,203
- Eat your cereal.
- But what about that strange noise?

98
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:00,005
Oh, and that creepy light
coming from the attic.

99
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:02,608
George, you've got to tell her.
You've got to tell her.

100
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,977
Mom, my stinger fell off again.

101
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:08,080
Kara honey, I've already
sewn it on three times.

102
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,115
What kind of a bee
doesn't have a stinger?

103
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:11,984
A dead one.

104
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:14,549
Honey, just leave it here
and I'll sew it on again later, okay?

105
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,124
Ricky Jameson said he's lucky
no one called the cops.

106
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,492
Smooth move there, Pops.

107
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,261
Oh, be nice to your father.

108
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:24,329
You know what? Tell Ricky Jameson
to mind his own business.

109
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,165
- Ow! Ben!
- Sorry.

110
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,401
What have I told you about playing
with this in the house?

111
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:32,438
Hey, Dad, check it out.
I made some modifications.

112
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,473
- Oh yeah? Pretty cool.
- You see that?

113
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,742
- Here, let me show you.
- Ooh, what's that?

114
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,911
Zeus.

115
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:41,180
Hey, come here.
Come here, you. Come here.

116
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,348
Stop torturing the dog.
Cut it out.

117
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,250
Okay, look look look.
Take that thing upstairs.

118
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,219
You get dressed for school.
Take off your wings.

119
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,289
And then come back down
and have your breakfast, okay?

120
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,991
You know, I'm not even hungry either.
I'm just gonna get up and go to work.

121
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,827
(groans)
Jeez.

122
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:56,762
Be careful, George, or they're gonna
put a cone on you.

123
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:58,931
You are not going anywhere
with that leg.

124
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:01,967
Sit down.
Just call the office

125
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,669
and tell them that you need
the week off.

126
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,206
Sweet. It'll be you and me,
Georgie, all day long.

127
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,441
We can play fetch.
You can rub my belly.

128
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,376
Give me extra doggie treats.

129
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:15,047
Just try not to make a mess around
the house while you're here, okay?

130
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,850
Because Friday is our Halloween
housewarming party

131
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,886
and it's our last chance to make
a good impression on the neighbors.

132
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,489
- Okay.
- All right.

133
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,124
And stay out of trouble, you.

134
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,059
Yeah, you hear that?

135
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,328
- Honey.
- Yeah?

136
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:30,796
I was talking to you.

137
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:33,793
- Oh, okay.
- Busted.

138
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,540
- Bakaw.
- Stewey.

139
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,975
- What?
- Put the egg down.

140
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:45,410
- I'm hungry. It's an egg.
- Stop it.

141
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,446
Leave it alone.

142
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,348
We're gonna get in trouble, okay?

143
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,784
We've got to make a good impression.
Let's go.

144
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:54,052
Here she comes.

145
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:56,054
All right, let's see.
We've got Ted Stein

146
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,657
and Stewey McMan.

147
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:01,026
Aren't you just precious people?

148
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:04,696
Two counts of breaking and entering,
two counts of attempted theft,

149
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:07,299
two counts of animal endangerment.

150
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,369
I don't even want to ask
what that's about.

151
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,005
One count of vandalism
of public property.

152
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,240
- Quite the resume.
- Thank you.

153
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:18,076
Hey, what's wrong with you?

154
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:19,678
Um, Miss...
is it Miss or Mrs.?

155
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,079
Miss is just fine.

156
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,781
Miss Cloverfield.

157
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:25,217
I just want you to know
that Stewey and I

158
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,186
are very very happy to be here.

159
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,755
Thank you very much
for giving us this chance.

160
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:33,759
And, uh, we plan on becoming very
productive members of society.

161
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,794
We thank you so much
for this opportunity.

162
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:38,564
And might I add you look
very beautiful today?

163
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:42,467
Well, let's get one thing
perfectly clear, twinkle toes.

164
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:43,869
I don't like you.

165
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,537
I didn't like you
before I came in this room.

166
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,272
I didn't even like you
before you were born.

167
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,473
I'm not even sure
I like your mother.

168
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:54,079
So what we're gonna do,
we're gonna start all over again.

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,814
This is gonna be a fresh start
for the both of you.

170
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:00,652
You will complete
the work release program.

171
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,055
Every single step.

172
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:07,459
And if I'm lucky I will make upstanding
citizens out of the two of you.

173
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,095
Otherwise it's back to prison
for both of you.

174
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:12,531
And I don't mean
just a year this time

175
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,099
because this is my world, baby.

176
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,635
And in my world characters
pay for their crimes.

177
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:19,738
Do you have that?

178
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,307
Now got that out of the way.

179
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:25,805
Have I got the perfect assignment
for the two of you.

180
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,916
(squishes)

181
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,318
(dogs barking)

182
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,884
Thanks, Ted.
Look what you got us into.

183
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:44,488
Jackpot.
Barbeque, my favorite flavor.

184
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,868
Thank you, my friend.
Know what goes with this?

185
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:53,229
- A can of cola.
- One cola coming right up.

186
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,507
Oh, do I got him trained.

187
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,313
Okay, here we go.
Just a little tug here.

188
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:04,048
Pull it and bingo.

189
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,656
Thanks, buddy.

190
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:12,991
What do you think?
"Chappy" marathon?

191
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:15,127
No wife, no kids, no work.

192
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,162
Sounds good to me.
There we go, share the love.

193
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:18,764
This is the life, baby.
One for you.

194
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,299
- Absolutely.
- One for me.

195
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,334
Love it.
Mmm, keep 'em coming. Let's go.

196
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,237
- Let's have a contest.
- Oh, I'm on. Let's go. Down.

197
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,073
Here we go.
Best day ever.

198
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,909
Eh, how much TV can I watch?

199
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,312
- How many chips can I eat?
- What is it, Georgie?

200
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:35,410
How about some fresh air?

201
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:39,384
(engine starting)

202
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:52,459
This is so much fun.
I want to try.

203
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:57,094
That is the coolest thing
I have ever seen.

204
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:06,035
What?

205
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,917
I am hurrying.

206
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,952
Uh, G-George, no no no.

207
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,588
Not Mr. Weagle.
No no, don't... whoops.

208
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,824
- What the...?
- What the heck?

209
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,927
- Oh!
- Oh! (laughs)

210
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:23,929
- (growls)
- Hey, honey.

211
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,897
Bannister!

212
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:27,966
Sorry, my bad.

213
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,102
Why don't we go inside?

214
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:32,137
(grunting)

215
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:34,539
[Cat]:
He shouldn't cry over spilled milk.

216
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,108
What's happening
to this neighborhood?

217
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,642
I told you
we should have moved.

218
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:41,079
- Hey, G-man.
- Look what the cat dragged in.

219
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,582
Ah, what's up, Max?

220
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,751
Well, nice work last night,

221
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:49,354
waking up the whole neighborhood.
Maybe the whole town.

222
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:51,723
Way to impress
your new neighbors, duh.

223
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:53,358
Don't you work for a living?

224
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:57,229
Oh come on, G-man.
You know I make websites at home.

225
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,897
What a nerd.

226
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,866
Which reminds me,

227
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,301
if the missus needs to hit me up
for a website,

228
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:05,303
you just give me a jingle.

229
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:07,739
Give her a discount.

230
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,442
- Okay, yeah.
- We'll be sure to let her know.

231
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,878
So...

232
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,615
did you get a look at what
was going on up in there?

233
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,819
No, why?

234
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,554
Come on.

235
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:25,223
Guy's been living there nine months,

236
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:27,926
no one knows anything about him.
Nothing.

237
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:29,717
No one knows anything?

238
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,332
Is he living there alone?

239
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,235
Yes he is.

240
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:40,839
With that creepy dog of his.

241
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,472
Creepy?
More like psychotic.

242
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:48,713
If you ask me,
I think he's a mad scientist.

243
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:51,817
The postman tells me

244
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,985
he gets these
mysterious packages,

245
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:56,822
some of them
marked hazardous.

246
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:58,890
You see, George?
You see?

247
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,059
I told you I had
a bad feeling about him.

248
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,796
I mean, who knows what kind of weird
experiments he's performing up there?

249
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,587
You know, with...

250
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,168
eight-legged pigs

251
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:14,039
or flying gerbils.

252
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,007
Flying gerbils?

253
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:19,578
It's not too late to move again,
is it, George?

254
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,046
Ugh.

255
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:24,850
He could be up there
right now.

256
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,220
Right now?

257
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:31,285
- (car approaching)
- What?

258
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:36,323
One. Two, three, four,
five, six.

259
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:44,336
Look, Mother.
It's that creepy neighbor.

260
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:45,670
- Honey.
- What?

261
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,303
Look.

262
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,077
Come on. Come on.

263
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,642
What?
Who's that?

264
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:02,145
It's him.

265
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:13,365
(barks, growls)

266
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:15,293
It's her.

267
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:30,315
What is that?

268
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,208
I don't know.

269
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,483
I'm telling you, Georgie.
This guy is bad news.

270
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,892
Those aren't dog biscuits.

271
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,508
Well, uh, listen, I...

272
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,743
I've got to go.

273
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,579
There's a special one-hour
"Judge Jimmy".

274
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,348
I can't miss it.
Good luck.

275
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:07,050
And he wonders
why he's still single.

276
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,456
I'm telling you, Zeus,
I don't know what's going on,

277
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:14,025
but something's afoot.

278
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:17,489
I think so too, Georgie.
I think so too.

279
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,167
Rusty, what's up, dog?

280
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:24,035
Hey, kid, want to play?

281
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:27,072
Look out, ladies.
Oscar is on the prowl.

282
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,074
Hey, that's mine.
Get back here.

283
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,375
Finders keepers.

284
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:33,211
I know I put that bone
in here somewhere.

285
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:34,879
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

286
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,781
(panting)
I'm gonna...

287
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,250
I gotcha!

288
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:41,145
(muffled)
I got it! I got it!

289
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,559
[Ted]:
Sanitation? Yoga?

290
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,894
You've got to be kidding me.
We should have just stayed in prison.

291
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,830
Over here.
I've got a fresh one for you.

292
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:54,065
I swear those dogs
are watching me.

293
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,368
- (whining)
- It's all in your head, Stewey.

294
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:58,570
It's not in my head, Ted.
I don't like dogs.

295
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:01,106
I can swear they're watching me with
those brown little beady eyes right now.

296
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:03,541
Of course we're watching you.
You're an idiot.

297
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,844
- Get out of here.
- Why don't you make me, tubby?

298
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,712
- Shoo.
- This is our park.

299
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:09,914
I can't stand those dogs, Ted.

300
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,983
The feeling's mutual, pal.

301
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:14,653
Stewey, I was reading
my book and it says

302
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:18,657
that we are stuck in what is called
a self-destructive cycle.

303
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:21,326
Listen, Ted, I can't go straight.
You understand me?

304
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:22,961
I've tried to go straight before.
I can't do it.

305
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,429
Relax, Stewey.

306
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,831
- Nobody's going straight, okay?
- All right.

307
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:29,134
We just have to find a way
to break the cycle.

308
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,536
Push back a couple years
of bad karma.

309
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:34,472
And then... foom...
we're on easy street.

310
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:36,107
Easy street.

311
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:39,544
They got Chinese food on easy street?
They got burritos on easy street?

312
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:41,313
- Probably.
- Well, you'd better make sure.

313
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:43,715
'Cause I'm sick of this, Ted.
I've been out a half hour,

314
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,017
you got me cleaning stuff,
you got me picking up dog poop,

315
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:47,852
you got me picking up garbage.
I can't do it no more.

316
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,821
You got me sweating up a storm.
Look at this, I'm sweating.

317
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:51,756
- You understand me?
- Ew.

318
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:54,225
- You got a little... you got...
- What?

319
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:56,361
- (stammers)
- Did I get it?

320
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,330
- Yeah, you got it.
- Where you going?

321
00:16:58,331 --> 00:16:59,831
I'm talking to you.
I can't go clean.

322
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:02,100
I can't do it.
What's that smell?

323
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:05,337
(sniffs)
Ted! Come back here, Ted.

324
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:08,106
Ha, and they call me fat.

325
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:13,812
Aren't we a little too old
to be carving pumpkins?

326
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,281
Ben, this is a Bannister
family tradition.

327
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:18,616
I did it with my dad,
he did it with his,

328
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:20,452
and now I'm doing it with you.

329
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,921
What about me, George?
Don't I get a pumpkin?

330
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,990
Can't we do something fun?
Let's break out the Ouija board.

331
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:28,259
Absolutely not. It's not good
to mess around with that stuff.

332
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,229
Not with All Hallows Eve
just around the corner.

333
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,065
There's no such thing as ghosts,
right, Mommy?

334
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,334
- Of course not, sweetheart.
- Sure there are.

335
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:38,703
No, honey, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

336
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,872
Don't worry, Kara.
He's just pulling your paw.

337
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:42,941
(laughs)
Aren't you, George?

338
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:46,010
Okay.
Zeus, the lights please.

339
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,513
Oh boy.
Here we go.

340
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:49,914
- George.
- What?

341
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,082
What are you doing?

342
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,351
I think it's time Ben and Kara
knew about the story

343
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,588
- of the hook man of Halloween.
- The what?

344
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,084
I don't think that's a good idea.

345
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:03,995
- It was a cold and quiet night.
- George.

346
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:07,399
Much like the one tonight.

347
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,169
Your mother and I
were going out on a date.

348
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,537
Don't listen to him, honey.

349
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,508
We ran out of gas and broke down
just outside of town.

350
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:19,039
But it was right next
to the railroad tracks.

351
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:25,483
Choo choo.

352
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,219
And as your mother and I
sat quietly in the car

353
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,121
we heard a noise.

354
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:33,992
It was a thump and a thump.
(stomps)

355
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:37,996
And we thought it would get
further and further away.

356
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,664
And did it?

357
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,533
No.

358
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:44,269
It got closer and closer

359
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,070
with a thump and a thump.
(stomps)

360
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:47,505
Then I heard a noise.

361
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:50,408
It was metal on metal.

362
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,043
(whines)

363
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:54,946
And as I looked
outside the window,

364
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:57,849
- I saw...
- What?

365
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,851
- I saw a hook!
- (screams)

366
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,986
(shouting)

367
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,721
- George!
- What?

368
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:06,758
You have just scared her to death.
She's gonna have nightmares now.

369
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,160
Belinda, it's a Halloween story.

370
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,830
- George.
- Good going, Dad.

371
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:14,599
Ben, come on.
You love Halloween stories.

372
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,061
This whole family
has got to get in the mood.

373
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,737
(sighs)

374
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:21,739
Zeus, it wasn't that bad, was it?

375
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,075
I'm sleeping in your bed
tonight, George.

376
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,674
(wolf howling)

377
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:30,982
[George]: All right, buddy.
Let's make it quick.

378
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:33,342
It's cold out here.

379
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,722
Oh, George, look.
Something's going on next door.

380
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:39,320
[George]:
What's going on?

381
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:51,292
Who would have thought of getting
a delivery in the middle of the night?

382
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:57,442
Okay, so the mail guys
got new uniforms?

383
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,335
(burbling sound)

384
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:03,147
Maybe it's new equipment
for his experiments.

385
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:05,006
I don't know.
That's not normal.

386
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:10,755
Okay, Georgie, we have to
tell somebody.

387
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:13,524
Yeah, let's go tell Belinda.
Let's go.

388
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:20,331
Belinda, I'm telling you,
they had this van that pulled up

389
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:23,535
and these guys in robes came out
with this equipment.

390
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:26,671
And they were taking it out of the van
and bringing it to the creepy house.

391
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:30,808
Honey, it sounds like they were just
getting a delivery of some kind, okay?

392
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,770
I'm gonna go to sleep, okay?

393
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:38,116
You know Weird Max?

394
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:40,084
He said that the mailman told him

395
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,020
that this guy
is some kind of scientist.

396
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:43,688
- George.
- Yeah?

397
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:45,123
[Belinda]:
So what if he is a scientist?

398
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:48,326
[George]: Yeah, like a crazy,
spooky Copernicus scientist.

399
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,562
George, I can see...

400
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:53,598
that you have completely
overreacted to the situation.

401
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,167
You have already completely
terrified your daughter.

402
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:57,502
Do you really want to make it worse?

403
00:20:57,503 --> 00:21:00,138
Yeah, I think our daughter
should be terrified.

404
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,106
It'll thicken the Bannister skin.

405
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:04,542
There is some crazy stuff
going on over there, Belinda.

406
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,277
I'm telling you, it happened.

407
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,880
Okay. Okay okay.
Honey, it happened.

408
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:10,848
I believe you, okay?

409
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:14,252
Now unlike you I have to get up
and go to work in the morning.

410
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:16,187
So I'm gonna go to sleep, okay?

411
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:17,955
(claps)

412
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:23,127
(thunder crashes)

413
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:25,828
(electronic humming,
zapping)

414
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:32,794
(cat screeches)

415
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:48,252
[George]:
Honey, listen to this.

416
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:52,490
Two high-voltage electron generators
were stolen...

417
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:55,760
from the Seaman Neck power plant
late last night.

418
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:58,663
- Hmm.
- You know what I'm thinking?

419
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:01,499
Maybe that's what those guys
were carrying up to the house.

420
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,201
I knew he was no good.

421
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:05,870
Two high-voltage
electron generators.

422
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,338
- You know what that means?
- George.

423
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,774
- They have enough power to...
- Enough power to do what, Daddy?

424
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:11,242
Didn't you ever see "Frankenstein"?

425
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:14,212
Enough power
to get one of those

426
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:17,048
ultra powerful hairdryers
like your mama wants.

427
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:19,951
Sweetheart, you just eat your breakfast
and don't listen to your father

428
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:22,487
because sometimes
he says crazy things.

429
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:25,690
I'm telling you,
this guy is up to no good, Georgie.

430
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:28,118
We got to be on high alert here.

431
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:31,195
Oh!

432
00:22:31,196 --> 00:22:34,298
- Can I come in?
- Sure. Over there.

433
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,032
Something wrong with the doorbell?

434
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:40,405
- Hi.
- Hi, Monique.

435
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:42,807
I hope I'm not intruding.

436
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:44,442
[Belinda]:
Oh no, not at all.

437
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:47,011
Can I get you some cereal?

438
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,813
I know.
How about some pants?

439
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,648
[Monique]: No thanks.
No. I'm not gonna stay.

440
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:54,585
I just wanted to find out
if any of your had seen Rufus.

441
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:56,587
Something happened to Rufus?

442
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,523
- Is that a cat?
- Yes.

443
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:01,259
A very beloved cat.
He's been missing since last night.

444
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,594
Last night?
Huh.

445
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:07,899
Kent said he saw him playing
with you-know-who's dog after supper.

446
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,636
But he didn't answer the door.
I don't think he's a people person.

447
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:14,205
Wait, the neighbor's dog?

448
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,673
Uh-oh.

449
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:17,875
Anyway, if you wouldn't mind,

450
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,011
I'd appreciate it if you'd
show these to anyone

451
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:24,615
who might know where my poor
defenseless little pookie-poo is.

452
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:26,250
Sure thing, Monique.

453
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:28,416
Thanks.

454
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,889
- Bye, George.
- Bye, Monique.

455
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:36,194
Oh, goodness.
Well, that poor thing.

456
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:38,296
She just really loves
this little cat.

457
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,264
Sure hope she finds him.

458
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:43,868
Yeah well, probably dead
and buried in someone's yard.

459
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:45,002
What was that?

460
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:46,904
I just said that the coffee
is very good

461
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:49,974
and that Rufus is probably running
around someone's back yard.

462
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,609
Oh. Well, good.

463
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,312
You can just keep your eye out
for him while you're recuperating.

464
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,147
Oh, honey.

465
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,282
Watch it.
That's the bad leg.

466
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,651
- And promise me...
- Yeah?

467
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:03,443
no more snooping around
the neighbor's yard.

468
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:08,559
[George]:
Okay, let's see what we've got.

469
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,064
Wow, these toys are a lot fancier
than when I was a kid.

470
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:15,633
You're telling me.
My toys just squeak.

471
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:18,436
Okay, Eli Cole,

472
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:20,872
show me what you're up to.

473
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:24,175
[Zeus]: So what do you see,
Georgie? Anything?

474
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:27,707
All right, we got a bogie
in the southeast perimeter.

475
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:31,482
Man,

476
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:34,547
look at the security system
this psycho has.

477
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:42,126
(beeps)

478
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,829
Uh, what is that in the ground?

479
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,532
Looks like his dog likes to dig,
I'll tell you that.

480
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,568
[Zeus]: Yeah, those would be some
pretty big bones there, George.

481
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:54,430
All right, let's check out inside,
see what we got.

482
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,447
What is that?

483
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:06,450
That doesn't look like a recipe
for candied apples.

484
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,686
I want a turn, Georgie.
Let me look.

485
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,721
[George]:
What the heck?

486
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:13,820
"Countdown to zero hour"?

487
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,889
That doesn't sound good.

488
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:20,659
Where the heck did he go?

489
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,503
Whoa, how you doing?
(laughs)

490
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,205
Hi, how are you?

491
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:30,474
I. Uh... sorry.
I'm bird watching.

492
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:33,266
Little hobby of mine.
Nut job.

493
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,150
You think he bought it?

494
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:41,485
Well, if something's gonna
go down in two days,

495
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:44,155
we're gonna have
to get inside, Zeus.

496
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:49,018
Uh, George, you mean you actually
want to go inside the house?

497
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:58,903
Now remember, Mommy,

498
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:01,672
I want to go to every house
in the neighborhood this year.

499
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:04,464
Don't shortchange me
and my candy, all right?

500
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:07,974
Nice outfits.
Love the color.

501
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,421
Ted, how come we can't go
trick or treating?

502
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:20,458
You really want to risk our freedom
for a little bit of candy?

503
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:23,361
It depends.
What type of candy they got?

504
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:26,430
Remember when I told you about being
stuck in a self-destructive cycle?

505
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:29,533
Ted, you're starting to scare me
with this self-help stuff.

506
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:32,003
Do you really think it's our destiny
to be stuck here

507
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:34,272
picking up trash and dog poop
for the rest of our lives?

508
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:35,606
No.

509
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:39,143
So we've got to break
the cycle.

510
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:41,512
I got plans. Big plans.
You've got plans, right?

511
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:43,414
You still want to open up
your little butcher shop

512
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:45,049
- right there on the beach, right?
- Yeah.

513
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,786
Okay, so we finish Miss Cloverfield's
stupid little program,

514
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,554
we're on the first flight to Daytona

515
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:51,923
and we'll hook it up
with Tony Rowe.

516
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:53,658
No more picking up dog poop.

517
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,860
No more picking up
dog poop.

518
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,328
How you gonna do that?

519
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:58,996
I don't know.

520
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:00,821
I'll think of something.

521
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:05,162
Ah!

522
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:08,806
- Hey, what's up, buddy?
- I want some. Me me me.

523
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,208
No no no no.
You can't have this.

524
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,411
This, my friend,

525
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:16,247
is a store-bought pumpkin pie...

526
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:20,151
that we are gonna give to our
wonderful neighbor Mr. Cole.

527
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:22,253
[Zeus]: Oh, I see
where you're going with this.

528
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:25,356
Place it into the preheated oven...

529
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,892
for approximately five minutes.

530
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:29,927
Watch out, Julia Childs.

531
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:33,264
And we have ourselves a home-baked
pumpkin pie.

532
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:35,533
Sneaky. I love it.

533
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:40,071
- Hi.
- Hey, whatcha doing, Daddy?

534
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:43,207
Oh, I just made a little
pumpkin pie for Mr. Cole.

535
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,176
You just want to go
inside his house.

536
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:46,944
Uh, well, you know what, son?

537
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:48,779
There's nothing wrong
with being a little neighborly.

538
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,148
Fine, then we're coming with you.

539
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:52,916
I don't think that's a good idea.

540
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:58,813
(crow cawing)

541
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,295
- Honey.
- What?

542
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:06,430
- Take a look.
- What?!

543
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,600
Mmm.
Look at that.

544
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:11,769
Come on, George,
you watch the cop shows.

545
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,901
We got a pie,
not a warrant.

546
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,364
Hey.

547
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,945
[Zeus]: I don't see any sign
of Cujo anywhere.

548
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:24,044
Godspeed, G-man.

549
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:30,488
Now or never, Zeus.

550
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:33,189
Why don't we just friend him
on Facebook?

551
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,494
Look, Daddy.
He fixed the scarecrow you broke.

552
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:39,263
[George]:
Oh yeah, what do you know.

553
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,302
- (squishes)
- Ugh, that's disgusting.

554
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:47,505
- [Kara]: Ew.
- [George]: Ugh. Ick.

555
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:50,798
- [Ben]: Gross.
- Don't worry about it now, Ben.

556
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:58,249
You sure we shouldn't
wait for backup?

557
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,718
- Age before beauty, Daddy.
- Huh?

558
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:03,988
Oh yeah.
Yeah, normally.

559
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:06,390
But on a situation like this, honey,

560
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:09,126
you know, where Daddy's
hand are full...

561
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,028
maybe...

562
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,923
Cowards.

563
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:17,768
(gongs ringing)

564
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,867
Aw, shucks. No one's home.
Let's get going, guys.

565
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,100
(door creaks)

566
00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:31,682
Guess he wants us
to come in.

567
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:34,919
(whines) Fine.
Everyone follow me.

568
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,288
Mr. Cole.

569
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,648
George Bannister from next door.

570
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,061
George, I think we should
get out of here.

571
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:47,991
Hello? Mr. Cole?

572
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:53,037
This is gonna be good.
(laughs)

573
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,808
Uh, we baked you a nice
fresh pumpkin pie.

574
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,237
A little friendly thing.

575
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,341
Wait for me.

576
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,762
[George]:
Here, buddy.

577
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:28,672
[Zeus]: I don't believe it.
They got nuts. I love nuts.

578
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,541
Look, Daddy.
He's got fish.

579
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,343
Oh yeah.
(laughs)

580
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:34,078
(fish laughing)

581
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,946
Look at that. Sometimes they like
when you play with 'em.

582
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:39,216
- [Fish]: Look, finger food.
- Ow!

583
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:41,452
Dad, are you okay?

584
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,120
Yeah, I'm fine, Ben.

585
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:45,589
Boy.

586
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,687
I can't take you anywhere.

587
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:52,630
- What is it, Daddy?
- Rufus' collar.

588
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:55,266
Rufus?
You mean Monique's missing cat?

589
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,568
Dad, look.
Over there.

590
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:00,360
- Who's that?
- Here.

591
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,208
Hey, Mr. Cole.

592
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:05,843
George Bannister.

593
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:08,812
These are my kids
Ben and Kara.

594
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:12,283
Was wondering if you'd like...
Oh, how you doing?!

595
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:14,652
(screams)

596
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:17,478
What, you've never seen
a skeleton before?

597
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:21,085
- (growling)
- (whines)

598
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:23,928
You're the new neighbors.

599
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,630
Yes. Yeah, I'm George Bannister.

600
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:29,833
And these are my...

601
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,670
my kids.
This is my son...

602
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:36,273
Kara, my daughter
and Ben my son.

603
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:39,543
And of course Zeus.

604
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:42,079
You know, like the Greek god.

605
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,582
I'm Medusa,
like the goddess of death.

606
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,650
Oh, that's nice.

607
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:49,320
Eli Cole.

608
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:51,822
What are you doing in my house?

609
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,757
Trying to find out what you're up to.

610
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:56,327
Oh well,
we were just out walking Zeus

611
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:59,663
and we thought we would
come over and bring you

612
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:02,833
a nicely fresh pumpkin pie
I baked for you.

613
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,102
I hate pumpkin pie.

614
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,470
Oh.

615
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:11,208
Medusa, why don't you take Zeus
and the children and show them around

616
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:14,842
while I entertain Mr. Bannister?

617
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:20,110
Come.

618
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:23,554
Here, honey.

619
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:27,458
If we're not back in 10 minutes,
call Search and Rescue.

620
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,750
Watch out for trap doors.

621
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,864
This way, Blondie.

622
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:36,929
Ladies first.
Come on, kids.

623
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:40,797
(crows cawing)

624
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,309
Can I get you anything?
A Bloody Mary?

625
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,945
Uh, no. Water's fine.
Thank you.

626
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:50,981
You know, I was just noticing
your fish tank here.

627
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:53,550
I was wondering what kind
of fish you have in here.

628
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:55,886
- Piranha.
- Oh hey, piranha.

629
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:58,022
Here's your water.

630
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:00,120
Oh.

631
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:04,995
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
- Sit.

632
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:06,997
Oh yeah, sure.

633
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:09,566
(sighs)

634
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:11,068
You're not thirsty?

635
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:13,137
Oh no.

636
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,539
No, I actually had a big lunch.

637
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,536
- Drink it.
- Okay.

638
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,086
(sighs loudly)

639
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:31,021
Quite a glass of water
you've got there.

640
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,119
Cashews?

641
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:38,362
Cashews.
Uh, no thank you.

642
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:41,598
I don't like furry cashews.

643
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,634
Who are you calling furry?

644
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,602
[Cole]: That's just Shelley.
She's harmless.

645
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:47,738
So, Mr. Bannister.

646
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,941
You're the one who destroyed
my display in the yard?

647
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:53,444
Yes. Yes I am.
Terribly sorry, sir.

648
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:55,713
It was an accident
and I'd be glad to pay you back,

649
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:57,247
Dr. Cole is it?

650
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,250
Professor.
And that won't be necessary.

651
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:03,420
Oh, okay, Professor.
Nice.

652
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:06,323
Professor of?

653
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:07,558
Paranormal research.

654
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,928
Oh, paranormal research.
Oh!

655
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:13,430
Very sorry, sir, about that.

656
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:16,400
I didn't mean to alarm you.

657
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,669
- Sometimes I don't...
- Oh.

658
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,405
This is quite a house you got here.

659
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,607
You know, the workmanship
is just...

660
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:26,176
you don't see
this woodwork anymore.

661
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:29,346
The problem with these homes
is the attics.

662
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:33,250
Very drafty. Maybe we can
jump up there and take a look?

663
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:36,420
- No.
- No.

664
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:38,856
- All righty.
- (knocks)

665
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:40,891
(knocking)

666
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:44,286
The house is settling.

667
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,005
So anything you want
to tell me about Rufus,

668
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:57,374
the missing cat
from across the street?

669
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,177
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of cop?

670
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:01,612
"Some kind of cop".

671
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,481
No, I'm a retired K9 police dog.

672
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:07,918
A police dog that's afraid
of thunder storms?

673
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,787
You've got to be kidding me.

674
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:11,155
Hey, I wasn't afraid.

675
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,390
That's not what I saw.

676
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:17,194
Yeah? What about the strange noises
coming from your house at night?

677
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:19,229
Want to say anything about those?

678
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,500
I'm not gonna say another word
until my lawyer gets here.

679
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,302
That's fine.
But just so you know,

680
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:27,237
I'll be watching you.

681
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:30,040
No, I'll be watching you.

682
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,142
Find anything?

683
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,434
I think I found a doll.

684
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:40,684
I noticed you've had some kind
of a power drain or something.

685
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:42,719
I noticed a green light upstairs.

686
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,355
Are you running any kind
of heavy machinery.

687
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:47,991
You're bugging me
with all these questions.

688
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:51,662
It's an old house.
The wiring needs to be redone.

689
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:53,197
Hmm.

690
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:56,733
It's interesting because I also heard
some loud noises late at night.

691
00:35:56,734 --> 00:36:00,437
I find that Halloween
is a particularly interesting time

692
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:04,107
for me to indulge my talents.

693
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:06,076
I do most of the leg work.

694
00:36:06,077 --> 00:36:07,845
Talents, right.

695
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:11,014
And Halloween is about what,
two days away?

696
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:12,616
Ew.

697
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,451
I have an idea.

698
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:17,354
We're having a bit
of a get-together tomorrow night,

699
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:19,356
Halloween party for the neighbors.

700
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,258
Why don't you stop on by

701
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:23,694
and, you know, bring the wife?

702
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:26,763
Unfortunately I'll be working
at the school lab all night long.

703
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:30,267
- Ah, bummer.
- In fact,

704
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:33,403
if you don't mind, I've really
got to be getting back to work.

705
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:36,440
Yeah, okay. Well, I'm sure
you have plenty to do.

706
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:38,909
Thank you for the water.
That was delicious.

707
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,711
It was a pleasure
meeting you, Professor.

708
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,379
Happy Halloween.

709
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,444
Oh, yes siree.

710
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,578
Okay, kids, Zeus, let's go.
Come on.

711
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:54,023
Okay, take it easy.

712
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,601
I believe they're starting to suspect.

713
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:06,803
Two days, Medusa.

714
00:37:06,804 --> 00:37:09,239
Just two more days.

715
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,542
(Medusa laughs)

716
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:16,713
[Mr. Weagle]: Would anybody happen to know
what this meeting is about?

717
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:19,449
[Mrs. Weagle]:
Maybe he and the kids saw something...

718
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,151
when they broke in next door.

719
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:23,654
[Mr. Weagle]: I'll bet you 10 bucks
this is a waste of time.

720
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:25,786
[Mrs. Weagle]:
Oh, honey, behave.

721
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:32,296
George:
Good afternoon, guys.

722
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:34,464
Some of you are probably wondering
why I even called this little meeting.

723
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:36,400
We're supposed to be having
dinner in the city.

724
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:39,503
- Sushi.
- Yeah, what's going on, Bannister?

725
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:42,706
Well, some of you might recall
that earlier in the week

726
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:46,476
my friend Zeus and I have heard
some mysterious noises

727
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:48,946
coming from this house.

728
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:52,583
Not to mention a strange light
coming from the attic.

729
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,651
Was that before or after

730
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:56,987
you started crying like a little girl
and woke up the whole block?

731
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:58,355
(laughing)

732
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:00,791
Laugh as you will,
but let me tell you something:

733
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:05,495
This house belongs to the one
and only Professor Eli Cole.

734
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:08,665
And his partner in crime Medusa.

735
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:12,169
Yes, I knew he was a scientist.
I knew it.

736
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,905
Except, Max, there's a problem.

737
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:17,574
I happen to call every college
within a 50-mile radius

738
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:19,509
and no one has heard of Eli Cole.

739
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,778
- Ahem. Uh, George.
- Yeah?

740
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:23,180
Maybe you should
just get to the point.

741
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,882
Tell them about the electron
generators, George.

742
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:27,616
Please, Belinda, exhibit A.

743
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,621
This you probably recognize

744
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:34,825
as a high-voltage
electron generator

745
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:37,894
stolen from the Seaman Neck
power plant late last night.

746
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:41,598
Not one hour later,
Professor Eli Cole

747
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,433
received a mysterious
late night delivery

748
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:47,070
with the same size
and description as this.

749
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:49,706
And the delivery guys
were wearing creepy robes.

750
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:52,075
- You should have seen it.
- Can you believe...

751
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:55,277
Exhibit B... Rufus.

752
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:01,685
- Honey.
- Yeah?

753
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,387
Rufus. Sorry.

754
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:05,689
The cat Rufus missing

755
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,724
ever since the same generator
had been stolen.

756
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:10,627
I already told Monique I saw him
playing with Cole's dog.

757
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:12,195
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, you did?

758
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:14,464
You told Monique you saw him
with Cole's dog?

759
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,400
Show them the collar, George.

760
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:20,103
Well, then if that's the case,
then how is this in the house?

761
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:22,873
(gasps)
Rufus' collar.

762
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:25,676
[George]:
That's right, Max. Rufus' collar.

763
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:28,412
And also take a look at exhibit C.

764
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:29,873
Honey.

765
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:33,817
What is this?

766
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:37,087
Honey, that's exhibit C, okay?
Just pass it.

767
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:40,057
No thanks.

768
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:41,758
What, did you blow
your nose in this?

769
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:45,462
That, my friend, was taken
off the shoe of my son Ben...

770
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:49,800
after he tromped
in the yard of one Eli Cole.

771
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,735
No, it's true, people.
I was there.

772
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:54,404
And this is important why?

773
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,973
This shows that there's evidence that
there's paranormal activity happening.

774
00:39:56,974 --> 00:39:59,042
- (laughing)
- Please stop laughing.

775
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:02,746
Oh, this is evidence.
Evidence that you're losing your mind.

776
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:05,849
- Oh!
- (all groaning)

777
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,918
Oh, that's disgusting.

778
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,753
That's evidence C.

779
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:12,289
Does anybody have a Handi Wipe
or a wet nap?

780
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,790
- (gasps)
- Thank you.

781
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,926
He got slimed.
That's awesome.

782
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:19,463
Also, might I add,
that this gentleman has a chart

783
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:23,266
counting out the days
to something called zero hour.

784
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:24,835
Do I know what it is?
No I don't.

785
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:27,237
But I'll tell you what,
I'm not gonna put my family at risk

786
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:28,505
and I don't think you should either.

787
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:31,308
And just what do you propose
we do about it?

788
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:34,711
I propose we go over there and see
where the proof is, all right?

789
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:36,346
Who's with me?

790
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:38,315
That's it, I'm out of here.

791
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:40,383
Come on, we need the Weagles.

792
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:42,452
- Good night, Bannister.
- Oh, Bruno.

793
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:44,154
We're out of here.

794
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:47,015
- Good night, Bannister.
- Oh, Edelsteins, please.

795
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,128
- Keep it. Yeah.
- Thanks.

796
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:53,430
- Kent, Marilyn.
- It's okay.

797
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:56,299
So you really found
this stuff in his yard?

798
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,535
Max, I'm telling you,
this guy is up to no good.

799
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:00,971
All I need is the evidence.

800
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:04,508
Well, let me know
when you find it.

801
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,144
I wouldn't go near that place
if you paid me.

802
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:08,945
(groans)

803
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:10,580
Bye.

804
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:12,349
Can you believe that?

805
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,217
Are you pleased
with yourself, George?

806
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:15,719
Do you see what you've done?

807
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,221
Belinda, I feel very strongly
about this stuff, okay?

808
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:20,683
(sighs)
Oh, George.

809
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:25,562
Where are you going?
We live here.

810
00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:28,198
George, let 'em go.
You and me can stop this guy.

811
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,967
I need some time to think.
Let's go to the park.

812
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,869
(dogs barking)

813
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,035
(panting)

814
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,355
- Give me that.
- What are you doing?

815
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,957
Give me this.
I can't control myself.

816
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,926
- Give me the stick.
- Do you want to go back to jail?

817
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:59,262
- Give me the stick!
- Will these two just give it a rest?

818
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:01,965
I can't believe it.
I mean not even Max seemed to care.

819
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:05,099
He's scared, George.
They probably all are.

820
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:10,173
Well, I just thought getting out
would clear my mind,

821
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:11,908
but I can't stop thinking about it.

822
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:14,778
Someone's got to help us
get into that house.

823
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:17,948
[Zeus]:
No, it can't be.

824
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:21,818
Hey, Zeus, look at that.

825
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:25,088
Aren't those the two guys that broke
into our house and stole Bella?

826
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:27,657
Oy vey.
What are they doing?

827
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,659
(arguing)

828
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,495
Yeah, I think it is.

829
00:42:32,496 --> 00:42:34,598
You know what? You're right.
Let me at 'em, George.

830
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:36,466
(barking)

831
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:39,769
You hear that?
You hear that dog barking?

832
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,137
It's a dog barking.

833
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,839
No no, that's a familiar
bark right there.

834
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,609
No, it's every dog barking.
We're in a dog park.

835
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,312
What a coincidence.
What are the odds?

836
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:52,249
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a really bad idea?

837
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,751
No, this is a sign, buddy.

838
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:57,287
We're finally gonna find out
what's inside that house.

839
00:42:57,288 --> 00:42:59,489
Look, I am all in favor
of bringing this guy down,

840
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,157
but there has got to be another way.

841
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:04,461
Look, just let me do all the talking.

842
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:06,062
My lips are sealed.

843
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:08,531
Hey, will you pull yourself
together, okay?

844
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,233
We're gonna be late
for our next appointment.

845
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:12,669
- Do we have to go?
- Yes we have to go.

846
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,704
(arguing)

847
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:17,107
[Ted]:
Stop. Let go.

848
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:19,142
- Excuse me, guys.
- It's him. It's them.

849
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:21,978
- (barks)
- That's the guy who put us in jail.

850
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:24,147
And if it was up to me,
you'd still be there.

851
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:25,882
Relax relax relax.

852
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:28,885
I was just out
walking my dog Zeus here...

853
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:31,688
and I noticed that you were
picking up some dog poop.

854
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,523
Yes sir, Mr. Bannister.

855
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:35,692
That's part of our probation.

856
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:38,662
We are trying to become more
productive members of society.

857
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:40,263
So we're not doing anything wrong.

858
00:43:40,264 --> 00:43:42,132
Oh well, fantastic.

859
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,768
That goes right in line
with what I have to say.

860
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:46,703
You know, kind of crazy,

861
00:43:46,704 --> 00:43:48,838
but I have a little bit
of a proposition for you.

862
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,174
You got a moment to hear it out?

863
00:43:51,175 --> 00:43:53,043
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

864
00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:55,979
Uh, do you mind if I confer
with my associate for one second?

865
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,907
Sure. Yeah.

866
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,685
- (stomach growling)
- You hear my stomach?

867
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:03,553
I'm anxious.
My stomach is never wrong.

868
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,989
[Ted]: Okay, listen.
Them being here, us being here...

869
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,225
- I think this is destiny.
- No, it's trouble.

870
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:11,394
No, okay, we're the unstoppable
force, right?

871
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:12,629
No, we're movable objects.

872
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,365
What happens when two forces,
opposing forces, collide?

873
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:16,900
You call your insurance company.

874
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:19,736
No, they reverse direction.

875
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:22,238
I got that good canine hearing
thing, George, you know?

876
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:24,040
And I'm telling you
these guys are trouble.

877
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,842
This is our chance
to change everything.

878
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:28,144
No more bad luck.
No more probation.

879
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:30,213
No more picking up dog poop.

880
00:44:30,214 --> 00:44:32,505
- You sure?
- Yes.

881
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:37,821
Mr. Bannister, we'd like to hear
what you have to say,

882
00:44:37,822 --> 00:44:39,723
but we're late
for our next appointment.

883
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:44,127
Okay, well, tell you what.
Zeus and I have nothing to do.

884
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:46,096
Why don't we go with you
on the next appointment?

885
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:48,398
What kind of an appointment is it?

886
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:51,224
- (rings)
- (woman chanting)

887
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,171
[George]:
Why are we here again?

888
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:56,740
[Ted]:
Court order.

889
00:44:56,741 --> 00:44:59,509
And there's a lot of hot chicks here.
Psst.

890
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:03,413
(scoffs)

891
00:45:03,414 --> 00:45:05,949
She don't like me
'cause my "chy" is clogged.

892
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,818
Stupid, how many time I got to tell you?
It's not "chy," it's chi.

893
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:11,178
(farts)

894
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:14,919
Oh, someone please
crack open a window.

895
00:45:20,598 --> 00:45:22,098
(rings)

896
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:24,390
And coming to your hands and knees.

897
00:45:27,304 --> 00:45:30,707
Inhale and thread your right arm...

898
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,275
through your left.

899
00:45:32,276 --> 00:45:33,777
[Stewey]:
What kind of position is this?

900
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,245
- Mr. Bannister.
- Yeah?

901
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:36,980
What is it you want
to talk to us about?

902
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:39,682
I want you guys to break into
my neighbor's house.

903
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:42,452
- What?
- Shh!

904
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:45,155
I told you this was a bad idea.

905
00:45:45,156 --> 00:45:46,956
Sorry.

906
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:49,325
Look, it's really important.

907
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:51,528
This guy is up to something bad.

908
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:53,163
I don't know what it is.
I've got to find out.

909
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:55,365
Ted, I don't like it.
I don't like it, Ted.

910
00:45:55,366 --> 00:45:57,767
Oh well, they're not interested.
Time to go.

911
00:45:57,768 --> 00:45:59,369
You guys are gonna be heroes.

912
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,638
You're not doing anything wrong.
You're not stealing anything.

913
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:03,606
You're gonna break in,
find the evidence that I need

914
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:05,208
to put him away and that's it.

915
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:07,510
Ted, I always wanted to be a hero.
You know that.

916
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:09,612
(gong rings)

917
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:13,849
And coming to fire log pose.

918
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:17,821
[Ted]:
I don't know about this, Mr. Bannister.

919
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,756
We're already on probation.

920
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:22,425
- It's a huge risk for us.
- I'll pay you guys.

921
00:46:22,426 --> 00:46:24,561
Wait a minute.
You're actually gonna pay these guys?

922
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:26,196
- How much?
- Hey.

923
00:46:26,197 --> 00:46:27,797
Hey, let the man make an offer.

924
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:29,365
I don't know.
How much do you want?

925
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:31,301
- How about some candy?
- Stewey, really?

926
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,336
It's Halloween.
I got no candy.

927
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:34,838
Okay, fine, candy.

928
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:37,574
Now wait a minute.
What about me?

929
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:39,843
(gong rings)

930
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:42,011
Coming into
downward facing dog.

931
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:45,247
Finally my kind of pose.

932
00:46:47,485 --> 00:46:50,053
I just want to make sure
you guys are in or not.

933
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:51,855
How about some
peanut butter cups?

934
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:53,756
Deal.
Get you a whole case.

935
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:56,226
- What?
- I know how to negotiate.

936
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:59,729
- When?
- Tonight.

937
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,865
This is the address.

938
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:04,033
- I'm gonna get out of here.
- (stomach gurgles)

939
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:06,603
I got a little stomach issue
going on. Come on, Zeus.

940
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,571
All right, people. Move it.
Canine coming through.

941
00:47:08,572 --> 00:47:11,541
Right leg forward into pigeon.

942
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:14,944
Ted, I can't get out of this.
Ted, I can't get out of this.

943
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,479
Namaste.

944
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,081
[Zeus]:
And a very Namaste to you too.

945
00:47:18,082 --> 00:47:20,350
(rings)

946
00:47:22,586 --> 00:47:25,655
- Oh, there you are, George.
- Oh boy. Hi.

947
00:47:25,656 --> 00:47:28,925
You are just in time to help me with all
these decorations for the party tonight.

948
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:31,194
- I got a little situation going on.
- You what?

949
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:32,962
Yeah, some business stuff
I've got to take care of.

950
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:35,765
But I'll do that in a day or so.

951
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:37,600
Okay. All right.

952
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:39,702
All right, Zeusy.
Zeusy, you want to help me?

953
00:47:39,703 --> 00:47:41,671
- Good boy. Good boy.
- Always happy to help.

954
00:47:41,672 --> 00:47:43,106
Go ahead.

955
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:45,398
Go help George with whatever.

956
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:57,386
This is the place, Ted.

957
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,724
Look at that house, Stewey.

958
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:04,794
Forget the house, Ted.
Look at the decorations.

959
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:06,863
I'll bet they have good candy
there for Halloween.

960
00:48:06,864 --> 00:48:09,933
Popcorn balls and peanut brittle

961
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:11,801
and candied apples
and chocolate momos.

962
00:48:11,802 --> 00:48:14,771
When I go trick or treating
that's exactly where I'm going.

963
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:16,706
We're not going
trick or treating, Stewey.

964
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:19,742
- (dog barking)
- Ted, you hear that?

965
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:21,611
Bannister didn't say nothing
about no dog, Ted.

966
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:23,780
Don't worry about the dog.
I'll handle the dog.

967
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:25,448
That's what you said
the last two times, Ted.

968
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:29,118
Stewey, I swiped a couple of sleeping
pills from Miss Cloverfield's purse.

969
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,121
Okay? A couple of pills,
little juicy sausage,

970
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:34,724
- night night doggie.
- You got sausage?

971
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:37,653
- Can I have some?
- No, Stewey.

972
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:43,325
We got movement.

973
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:49,799
That's him.

974
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:56,445
Ted, look at that.

975
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:01,517
Ooh!

976
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:04,254
Hallelujah.

977
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,490
A load like that, Stewey,
we could retire.

978
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:10,593
Ted Ted Ted Ted. You said you
weren't gonna take nothing, Ted.

979
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:12,262
That's not nothing, Stewey.

980
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:14,163
That's a trunk full of solid gold.

981
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:17,267
Our luck, it's changing.
It's going good now.

982
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:19,569
- Come on, Stewey, look at that.
- Ted, I can't go back to jail.

983
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,038
I told you that before.
I told that lady in the office before.

984
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:24,307
- I'm not going back to jail.
- Stewey, we're not going back to jail.

985
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:27,143
We're not going back to jail.
We get caught... if we get caught,

986
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:29,946
which we're not gonna get caught...
we pin it on Bannister.

987
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:33,512
He hired us.
It's all on him. Hmm?

988
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:37,353
Ted, I've told you before,

989
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:39,645
you always know how
to make me feel better.

990
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:42,225
Don't touch me, Stewey.

991
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:44,227
Ted, can I just
trick or treat real quick?

992
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:45,795
No trick or treating.

993
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,463
Let's get out of here.
We'll come back at dark.

994
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:49,832
- What's wrong with you?
- You're not fun, Ted.

995
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,725
That's what the problem is.

996
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:15,584
(thunder rumbles)

997
00:50:17,328 --> 00:50:19,721
(music playing)

998
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:22,999
(laughs)

999
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,502
Oh, good and bad.
I got you.

1000
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:30,039
- Oh, I love your costumes.
- Thanks.

1001
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,275
Wow, did you make that yourself?

1002
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:34,911
Yes, I actually did.
I sure did.

1003
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:37,480
Oh hey, kids kids.
No running in the house.

1004
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:39,382
They're excited.

1005
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:42,085
Oh, come on in.
Come on in. Welcome.

1006
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:44,987
- What a wonderful job you've done.
- Oh, well, thank you.

1007
00:50:44,988 --> 00:50:47,757
Here, there's punch here
on the table and cupcakes.

1008
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:50,893
We've got games in the other room
and pizza in the kitchen.

1009
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:52,895
Just make yourselves at home.

1010
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:55,765
George.
George, the Weagles are here.

1011
00:50:55,766 --> 00:50:58,835
Okay, honey.
Tell the Weagles I'll be right there.

1012
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:00,737
Or not.

1013
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:03,473
All right, here we go.
All set up.

1014
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:06,642
This is looking good, buddy.
Zeus, where are you?

1015
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:09,178
Zeus, what's the matter, buddy?

1016
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:12,115
I told you, I'm afraid of thunder.

1017
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:15,351
Oh, come on.
It's the thunder, isn't it?

1018
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:16,986
And the lightning?
Don't worry about it.

1019
00:51:16,987 --> 00:51:18,888
A little thunder storm.
It'll be over in a second.

1020
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:20,556
It's easy for you to say.

1021
00:51:20,557 --> 00:51:22,291
Peanut Butter, this is Jelly.

1022
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:24,627
Peanut Butter, this is Jelly.
What's your 20?

1023
00:51:24,628 --> 00:51:27,196
[Stewey]:
20? Peanut butter?

1024
00:51:27,197 --> 00:51:29,832
Peanut... is this Ted?

1025
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,301
Put Ted on.

1026
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:34,837
Give me this.

1027
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:37,538
Ted, where are you?

1028
00:51:39,143 --> 00:51:40,810
Jelly, this is Peanut Butter.

1029
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:42,745
We're moving into position, over.

1030
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:44,414
I smell intruders.

1031
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:45,848
- Ted, the dog.
- Shh.

1032
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:47,450
- The dog, Ted.
- Shut up.

1033
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:49,952
- What's that, Ted?
- The sausage.

1034
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:51,788
Give me some, I'm hungry.
Give me that.

1035
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:53,389
- It's got sleeping pills inside.
- That's all right.

1036
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,791
- I'll eat a little bite.
- (barking)

1037
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:57,360
- Stewey, stop it.
- (barks)

1038
00:51:57,361 --> 00:51:59,754
Here you go.

1039
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:03,933
Three, two...

1040
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:06,896
- (thumps)
- Huh?

1041
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:10,669
You go in there first.
I'm scared of the dog.

1042
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:14,877
(Medusa snoring)

1043
00:52:14,878 --> 00:52:17,339
Sleeping.

1044
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:22,210
Close it. Close it.
Close it. Close it, Stewey.

1045
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:25,588
All right, Stewey,
give me the clippers.

1046
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:27,957
No.
I'm cutting this this time.

1047
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,293
- Give me the clippers, Stewey.
- No.

1048
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,195
Don't you remember all those houses
over on the north end?

1049
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:33,596
Those high-end alarm systems?

1050
00:52:33,597 --> 00:52:36,065
I remember we almost got caught.
Let me do this.

1051
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:38,167
I worked for an electrician
for three months. Watch this.

1052
00:52:38,168 --> 00:52:40,470
- Move out of the way.
- Careful. Pick the right one.

1053
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:41,999
Pick the right one.

1054
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,409
(crackling)

1055
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,544
- Ted!
- Let go of it, Stewey. Let go of it.

1056
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:51,547
- Ted! Ted!
- Stop.

1057
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:54,517
- Ted Ted Ted!
- You okay?

1058
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:57,587
¶ Twinkle twinkle little star ¶

1059
00:52:57,588 --> 00:52:59,155
¶ How I wonder... ¶

1060
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:01,090
Stewey. Stewey.

1061
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:03,493
You okay?

1062
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:06,195
Huh?
You all right?

1063
00:53:06,196 --> 00:53:08,297
- Your heart okay?
- Yeah.

1064
00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:10,700
- Okay.
- What just happened?

1065
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:12,535
Okay, let's go.

1066
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:14,770
What was that?

1067
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:16,606
- Are you guys all right?
- (knocking on door)

1068
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:18,807
- George, someone's coming.
- Uh, come in.

1069
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,544
Hey. -
- Mom's looking for you.

1070
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:23,179
Okay, yeah.

1071
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,548
Zeus and I are getting
just the final touches

1072
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:27,083
on our costumes.
We'll be right out.

1073
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:29,752
We definitely weren't spying
on the neighbor's house.

1074
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:32,054
[Ted]:
Jelly, this is peanut Butter, over.

1075
00:53:32,055 --> 00:53:33,656
Ahem.

1076
00:53:33,657 --> 00:53:35,958
- What was that?
- What was what?

1077
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:39,161
Whatever. It's just Mom
wants you to talk to the guests.

1078
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:42,665
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
I'll be mingling like crazy.

1079
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,763
- Okay.
- Okay.

1080
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:49,405
(exhales)

1081
00:53:49,406 --> 00:53:52,208
Oh, Zeus.
That was a close one, buddy.

1082
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:55,444
Not sure I can be by your side
on this one, Georgie.

1083
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:57,980
All right, I'm gonna go
mingle with the guests.

1084
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:00,349
You stay here, okay?
You gonna be all right?

1085
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,618
Right, and I'll keep my eye
on Ted and Stewey over there.

1086
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:05,479
Awesome.
Man the fort.

1087
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:10,159
- (thunder rumbles)
- Okay, wait for me, Georgie.

1088
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,361
All right, I learned this in Europe.

1089
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,900
What, the slow part of Europe?
Give me this.

1090
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:20,303
Let me show you how we do it
in Harlem. Watch this.

1091
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:22,572
Stewey, no.
Don't, it's got...

1092
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:24,740
- (shouts)
- (glass shatters)

1093
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:26,609
Okay.

1094
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,071
- Ted, I did it.
- Okay okay.

1095
00:54:41,425 --> 00:54:44,393
Stop.
Give me the flashlight.

1096
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:46,462
I didn't bring no flashlight.

1097
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:48,864
You forgot the flashlight?

1098
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:50,499
You didn't tell me to bring
no flashlight, Ted.

1099
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,602
It's a nighttime job, Stewey.

1100
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:54,437
How are we supposed to see
what we're doing?

1101
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:56,872
- Turn on the lights.
- There's no power.

1102
00:54:56,873 --> 00:54:58,941
There's got to be a candle
in here somewhere. I'll find it.

1103
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:01,107
You'd better find it.

1104
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:11,010
Ah.

1105
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:16,015
Good.

1106
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:18,861
See?

1107
00:55:18,862 --> 00:55:21,130
I'm happy I shoplifted that lighter.

1108
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,236
Ted, this place looks like
a haunted mansion.

1109
00:55:27,237 --> 00:55:28,904
(thunder rumbles)

1110
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,730
Stewey, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

1111
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:36,846
(squeaks)

1112
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:39,415
Ted, look!

1113
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:43,686
Stewey, no funny business, okay?
Remember what we're here for.

1114
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:45,788
What are we looking for?
I thought we were trick or treating.

1115
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:48,257
How about a trunk of gold?

1116
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:50,693
Okay? Or anything else
out of the ordinary.

1117
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:53,428
- Like what Mr. Bannister said.
- Okay.

1118
00:55:58,635 --> 00:56:00,903
Ted!

1119
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:03,572
- What?
- Nothing.

1120
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:06,108
What's wrong with you?

1121
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:09,045
It's all in your head.
Knock it off.

1122
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:11,314
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1123
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:16,185
Jelly, this is Peanut Butter.

1124
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:18,387
Jelly, this is Peanut Butter.
Come in.

1125
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:21,190
- We swim 50 laps every morning.
- Oh.

1126
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:22,591
20 more after dinner.

1127
00:56:22,592 --> 00:56:25,227
I bet you can't doggie paddle
though, can you?

1128
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:28,931
- Well, people like to swim,
- [Ted]: Jelly, this is Peanut Butter.

1129
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:31,667
- Honey, what is that?
- Excuse me for a second please.

1130
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:33,869
Yeah yeah, Peanut Butter,
this is Jelly. Go.

1131
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,604
Okay, we're inside.

1132
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:38,441
Okay, what you're looking for
is probably in the attic.

1133
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:41,110
Okay, we got it.
Over and out.

1134
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:43,612
- George. George.
- Yeah, honey?

1135
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:45,247
Is everything okay?

1136
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:47,249
Is anything ever just okay
with this family?

1137
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,753
- Yeah, great.
- Is that a walkie-talkie?

1138
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:52,121
Yeah, uh-huh.

1139
00:56:52,122 --> 00:56:54,256
- Honey, who are you talking to?
- Nobody, honey.

1140
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:57,093
It's just a toy.
You know, a little pirate radio.

1141
00:56:57,094 --> 00:56:59,729
- (chuckles)
- Oh, really, George?

1142
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,931
- Ted, let me hold the radio.
- It's not a toy, Stewey.

1143
00:57:01,932 --> 00:57:03,899
- We bought it at a toy store, Ted.
- Who cares?

1144
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,735
- Let me hold it, Ted.
- Who cares who holds the radio?

1145
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,170
- Stop it, Stewey!
- (static)

1146
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:10,406
- Oops.
- That's great.

1147
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:12,241
Get...

1148
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:15,811
Let's just do what
we're supposed to do, okay?

1149
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:18,447
Follow me.

1150
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:22,115
(squeaks)

1151
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,121
Ted, Ted, Ted, hold on.

1152
00:57:25,122 --> 00:57:28,482
[Ted]:
Quit being such a baby.

1153
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:31,857
I'm scared, not a baby.

1154
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:41,103
Ted, I hate spiders
more than I hate dogs.

1155
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:43,895
Hey, what did we
ever do to you?

1156
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:47,669
Ted, wait for me.

1157
00:57:48,745 --> 00:57:51,947
- Stop it, stop it.
- Ted, I'm scared.

1158
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:54,580
Nothing to be scared of.

1159
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,607
Ted. I think this house
is haunted, Ted.

1160
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:19,809
- Ted!
- What?

1161
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,844
- It's haunted I'm telling you.
- You're haunted, Stewey.

1162
00:58:21,845 --> 00:58:25,410
You're haunting me.
Now be quiet. Let's get this done.

1163
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:36,458
- George.
- Yeah.

1164
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:38,928
Honey, you're acting
very strange.

1165
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:40,963
Even for you.
What is going on?

1166
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:42,898
Nothing, Belinda.
Everything's great.

1167
00:58:42,899 --> 00:58:45,401
I mean, come on,
this is a strange holiday.

1168
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:47,369
You're out of punch here, G-man.

1169
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:49,471
Oh, hey, sorry, Max.
I'm gonna go grab that.

1170
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:51,907
Listen, you stay with the guests.
You look delightful.

1171
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:55,711
Little Bo something.
And, you know, have a good night.

1172
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:59,081
- Come on, Zeus.
- Coming.

1173
00:58:59,082 --> 00:59:00,713
Honey.

1174
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:08,958
Georgie, you see anything?
What's going on?

1175
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:10,993
[George]:
Man, I don't see anything out there.

1176
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:13,128
No sign.
Peanut Butter, come in.

1177
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:15,297
I'm not seeing anything.
Where are you guys?

1178
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:17,900
Peanut Butter, this is Jelly.

1179
00:59:17,901 --> 00:59:20,402
Where are you?
What's going on?

1180
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:23,433
(thunder crashes)

1181
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,675
Ah.

1182
00:59:26,676 --> 00:59:29,545
- (gasps)
- Stop messing around with that junk.

1183
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,580
- Let's find the gold.
- I looked for it already.

1184
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:33,315
I think the ghost stole it.

1185
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:35,618
How many times do I have to tell you?

1186
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:37,920
There's no such thing as ghosts.

1187
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:41,019
(screaming)

1188
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:50,799
- It won't open. It won't open.
- Stewey.

1189
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,091
- It won't open.
- Try the other door.

1190
00:59:54,905 --> 00:59:57,072
Hey, get out of the way!

1191
00:59:57,073 --> 00:59:59,408
Come on, Ted.
Ted.

1192
00:59:59,409 --> 01:00:00,943
- Stewey!
- Ted, I'm stuck.

1193
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:03,445
- Stewey.
- Push. Ted, push.

1194
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:05,347
I'm pushing.
I'm pushing.

1195
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:07,917
- (growling)
- Ted, the dog.

1196
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:10,185
- (barks)
- Pull back, Ted. Pull back.

1197
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:11,987
- I'm pulling. I'm pulling.
- (barking)

1198
01:00:11,988 --> 01:00:14,323
Pull! Pull!

1199
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:16,455
- (farts)
- (screams)

1200
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:19,528
What was that?

1201
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:22,464
- (thunder crashes)
- (whines)

1202
01:00:22,465 --> 01:00:25,868
What's the matter, buddy?

1203
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:28,137
Oh, the storm huh?

1204
01:00:28,138 --> 01:00:30,306
The storm bothering you?
Itll be over soon.

1205
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:32,975
George, promise me you won't say
a word to the other pets.

1206
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:36,111
Something must have
happened to you.

1207
01:00:36,112 --> 01:00:38,547
It was my first day on the job.

1208
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:42,484
My partner and I chased a burglar
into this building during a storm.

1209
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:46,088
When I heard the thunder I thought
it was the burglar shooting at us.

1210
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:49,258
I was so scared I ran to hide.

1211
01:00:49,259 --> 01:00:52,461
My partner trusted me.
He needed me and what did I do?

1212
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:55,526
I let the bad guy get away.

1213
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:58,627
Do you know
what us Bannisters do?

1214
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:01,804
- We count.
- Count?

1215
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:03,739
That's right, buddy.

1216
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,976
We count the seconds after we see
the lightning until the thunder.

1217
01:01:06,977 --> 01:01:10,980
And the longer the seconds take
the further the storm.

1218
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:12,648
I hope so.

1219
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:14,217
You got nothing to worry about.

1220
01:01:14,218 --> 01:01:16,779
(thunder crashes)

1221
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:20,723
[Ted]: We'll tear this place apart
until we find that gold.

1222
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:22,124
Ted, Ted, Ted.
I'm coming with you, Ted.

1223
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:24,484
You go that way
I'm gonna go this way.

1224
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:41,377
Stewey, Stewey, Stewey.
It's...

1225
01:01:41,378 --> 01:01:44,213
a bookshelf?

1226
01:01:44,214 --> 01:01:47,850
Where is this attic?
This is ridiculous.

1227
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:50,119
Come on, keep looking.
Come on, Stewey.

1228
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,684
I'm tired, Ted.

1229
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,659
Ted! Ted!

1230
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,029
Ted!
Look, Ted.

1231
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,997
Stewey.

1232
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:04,333
Great job, Stewey.
This has got to be it.

1233
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:06,735
It's a secret door.
How do you...?

1234
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:09,505
Ted, in the movies you usually
have like a key in the book thing.

1235
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:11,273
Here we go, move the books.
It's got to be here.

1236
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:14,176
Maybe there's a secret lever
or something, Ted.

1237
01:02:14,177 --> 01:02:17,112
Ted, look.
Colorado skiing. Fun times.

1238
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:19,314
I don't like Colorado anymore.
Stewey, come on.

1239
01:02:19,315 --> 01:02:22,885
Ted, you always said I was
an unstoppable force.

1240
01:02:22,886 --> 01:02:25,518
Move out of the way.
I'm going through this door.

1241
01:02:26,823 --> 01:02:29,558
All right, Stewey. Get it.
Go get it. Get it, Stewey, get it.

1242
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:32,094
- (grunts)
- Look at that, Stewey.

1243
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:34,663
- It's open, Ted.
- Yeah, let me look.

1244
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:36,765
- Ted, I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.

1245
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,431
Here we go.

1246
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:44,039
(Stewey farts)

1247
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,240
I have a little bit of gas, Ted.

1248
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:55,184
Ted.
(farts)

1249
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:57,675
Ted.

1250
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:07,393
(wind blowing)

1251
01:03:14,804 --> 01:03:16,935
Ted, wait for me.

1252
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:22,010
Ted, I thought you said
you shut the lights off.

1253
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:23,412
I did.

1254
01:03:23,413 --> 01:03:24,880
Then how come
there's lights still on?

1255
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:26,949
I don't know, Stewey.
I'm not a doctor.

1256
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,309
Ted, look.
It looks like my eyeball.

1257
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:35,252
Look at this place, Ted.

1258
01:03:36,793 --> 01:03:38,894
Ted, I don't know.
I think Bannister was right.

1259
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:41,763
This place is like one
big haunted movie.

1260
01:03:41,764 --> 01:03:45,795
Stewey, there it is.

1261
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:49,404
Isn't that the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen in your entire life?

1262
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:51,540
- I could cry.
- Don't cry, Ted.

1263
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:54,076
I could cry.
This is it.

1264
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:56,912
Stewey, this is everything
we've ever dreamed of.

1265
01:03:56,913 --> 01:03:58,714
Everything I've ever wanted,
it's just...

1266
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:01,183
- It's...
- It's candy!

1267
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,218
Ah, Ted, it's candy.
Look!

1268
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:05,521
No, this can't be happening.

1269
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:09,558
It's happening, Ted.
¶ Come to Uncle Stewey. ¶

1270
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:12,928
- (laughs)
- (sinister laugh)

1271
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:15,220
(screaming)

1272
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:24,273
Stewey.
Stewey, don't close it!

1273
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:25,939
Stewey!

1274
01:04:27,777 --> 01:04:30,045
(screaming)
Hey, Stewey!

1275
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:32,381
Stewey, open the door.

1276
01:04:32,382 --> 01:04:35,217
- Stewey, it closed.
- I want to go home.

1277
01:04:35,218 --> 01:04:37,319
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

1278
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,388
I want to go home.
Mommy!

1279
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:41,757
Mommy! I want to go home.
I want to go home.

1280
01:04:41,758 --> 01:04:44,726
Ted! Ah!

1281
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:47,257
There's spiders.

1282
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:51,500
[Shelley]:
Peek-a-boo.

1283
01:04:51,501 --> 01:04:53,202
(screams)

1284
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:55,604
- (clangs)
- (screams)

1285
01:04:55,605 --> 01:04:58,140
(screams)

1286
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:00,500
- (laughs)
- (screams)

1287
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:04,239
- (organ playing)
- (screams)

1288
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:10,350
- (water bubbling)
- (screams)

1289
01:05:13,456 --> 01:05:15,524
Ted!

1290
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:17,659
Ted! Ted!

1291
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:21,259
Ted!
Ted!

1292
01:05:27,437 --> 01:05:29,104
- Ted.
- No, Stewey.

1293
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:31,373
Stewey, don't let it close.

1294
01:05:35,912 --> 01:05:40,012
Great, Stewey.
Now we're both stuck in here.

1295
01:05:42,418 --> 01:05:44,119
[George]:
Oh boy.

1296
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,622
George, I hear a car.
I think he's coming.

1297
01:05:46,623 --> 01:05:48,857
Got to go, Zeus.
Got to go.

1298
01:05:48,858 --> 01:05:51,293
Better stop him before
he gets in his house.

1299
01:05:51,294 --> 01:05:53,462
10-4.

1300
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:55,788
I'll just be here waiting for you.

1301
01:05:56,899 --> 01:05:58,767
- George George, there you are.
- Huh? What?

1302
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:00,102
I thought you were
getting the punch?

1303
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:01,603
What punch?
What are you talking about punch?

1304
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:03,372
- The punch.
- Oh, the punch. I'm getting it, yeah.

1305
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:05,140
What do you think I'm doing?
Hey, listen, Ben.

1306
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:07,042
Look, you and Kara got to
distract Mr. Cole, all right?

1307
01:06:07,043 --> 01:06:08,810
- What?
- You can't... what? What what?

1308
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:10,946
You can't... don't say what.
On the walkie-talkie.

1309
01:06:10,947 --> 01:06:13,582
I'm running this operation.
Don't let him in the house!

1310
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:15,617
Heads up!
Heads up!

1311
01:06:15,618 --> 01:06:17,419
I've got an idea.
Follow me.

1312
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,587
No, kids. Kids. Where are you going?
Wings. Wings. Wings. Wings.

1313
01:06:21,557 --> 01:06:25,418
Um, would anyone
like to bob for apples?

1314
01:06:26,629 --> 01:06:28,920
What strange neighbors.

1315
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:04,466
- Maybe the storm is over.
- (thunder rumbles)

1316
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:06,635
(whines)
Oh, you can do it, Zeusy.

1317
01:07:06,636 --> 01:07:08,570
Come on, baby, just count.

1318
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:11,206
Just like Georgie said.
One Mississippi.

1319
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:15,043
Two Mississippi.
Three Mississippi.

1320
01:07:15,044 --> 01:07:16,378
(thunder crashes)

1321
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:18,203
(whines)

1322
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:28,557
Whoops.

1323
01:07:28,558 --> 01:07:31,093
(chuckles)

1324
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:33,385
Excuse me.
I'd like to go home now.

1325
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,998
Oh, excuse me.

1326
01:07:36,999 --> 01:07:39,634
- Now we're talking.
- Mom's not gonna like this.

1327
01:07:39,635 --> 01:07:43,371
Hey, kids, what are you doing out
here in the thunder storm?

1328
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:02,324
(laughs nervously)
Hey, Medusa.

1329
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:05,026
- (barks)
- Hey.

1330
01:08:05,027 --> 01:08:06,895
[George]:
Nice doggie.

1331
01:08:06,896 --> 01:08:09,798
Nice doggie didn't come
to work today.

1332
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:11,930
Watch this.

1333
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:15,470
Go right. Go right.

1334
01:08:15,471 --> 01:08:18,467
- Whoa.
- Now left. Now left.

1335
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:21,376
- (whimpering)
- (Medusa barking)

1336
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:24,179
I'll get you.
Get back here.

1337
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,582
You in the pirate costume,
I'm talking to you.

1338
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:29,050
Get back here.

1339
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:30,852
(toy car humming)

1340
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:33,555
All right, I want to try.
Here we go.

1341
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:36,586
Yeah.
Whoa, look at him go.

1342
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:39,494
Hey, girl, fetch.

1343
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:41,897
(barks)

1344
01:08:41,898 --> 01:08:45,634
Is that a toy for me?
Oh boy. Oh boy.

1345
01:08:47,437 --> 01:08:49,237
He is so scared.
Look at him go.

1346
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:52,564
Whoa. That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

1347
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:56,812
I've got to get back to the telescope,
see what's going on.

1348
01:08:56,813 --> 01:08:59,781
[Ben]:
Dad's gonna be in trouble.

1349
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:02,350
What is going on out here?

1350
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:04,953
Benjamin and Kara Bannister,

1351
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:06,455
you will listen
to your mother right now...

1352
01:09:06,456 --> 01:09:08,623
or you will both be grounded
until Christmas.

1353
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:11,259
Dad asked us
to distract Mr. Cole.

1354
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,029
What?
Why would he do that?

1355
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,564
Look, both of you
inside right now.

1356
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:17,765
Get back inside.
Go, Ben.

1357
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,103
(sighs)
Oh, George.

1358
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:24,473
You have got to be kidding me.

1359
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:26,571
(playing)

1360
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:38,180
Ted. Stewey.

1361
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,660
Don't see that every day.

1362
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:48,864
Ted. Stewey.

1363
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:51,656
Ted.

1364
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:54,436
- Stewe... ooh!
- George!

1365
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:55,737
Belinda, what are you doing here?

1366
01:09:55,738 --> 01:09:57,439
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

1367
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,041
- I'm... I'm... I'm actually...
- George.

1368
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,710
- I'm helping Mr. Cole.
- George, we have to go.

1369
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:04,613
Mr. Cole is right outside in the front.
He could come in at any minute.

1370
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:07,007
- What?!
- Yes.

1371
01:10:08,284 --> 01:10:11,920
George, is that organ
playing itself?

1372
01:10:11,921 --> 01:10:14,756
Yes it is. I told you there's
weird stuff going on here.

1373
01:10:14,757 --> 01:10:17,392
- I was right all along, Belinda.
- Maybe you were right.

1374
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:18,827
- Yes, I was right.
- What do we do?

1375
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:20,729
Listen, I've got to take care
of some stuff, all right?

1376
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:23,932
Take care of what stuff?
George. George.

1377
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:26,599
George!

1378
01:10:29,872 --> 01:10:32,374
George. George. No, George.
Outside. Outside this minute.

1379
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,442
Better stay close, honey.

1380
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:37,109
I really think we should go.

1381
01:10:37,947 --> 01:10:40,582
(sinister laughing)

1382
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:44,152
George. George.
The doors are opening and closing.

1383
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:46,021
Belinda, that's what doors do.
Guys?

1384
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:47,822
Wait wait wait,
is someone else here?

1385
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:49,891
- Guys?
- [Ted]: George, back here.

1386
01:10:49,892 --> 01:10:51,359
Who is that?
George. George.

1387
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,395
Wait for me.
Wait for me, George.

1388
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:56,756
(music playing)

1389
01:10:59,936 --> 01:11:03,438
Guess what, everybody.
I found Rufus.

1390
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:06,841
Hello?
Hello?

1391
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:09,377
Rufus? Uh-oh.

1392
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:11,780
Ted. Ted.

1393
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:13,715
[Ted]:
I'm behind the bookcase.

1394
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:15,717
- George, what is going on?
- Huh?

1395
01:11:15,718 --> 01:11:18,653
Nothing.
There's a hidden door, Belinda.

1396
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:20,221
- [Ted]: Who are you taking to?
- My wife.

1397
01:11:20,222 --> 01:11:24,125
- Who are you talking to?
- Ted and Stewey.

1398
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:26,494
The two guys
that broke into our house?

1399
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:28,630
Yeah, I hired them
to break into this house.

1400
01:11:28,631 --> 01:11:31,666
George, have you completely
lost your mind?

1401
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:34,769
I just have to figure out how
to move this stupid bookcase.

1402
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:36,771
The thing opens up.
I don't know where.

1403
01:11:36,772 --> 01:11:39,007
- George, have you tried pushing it?
- Huh?

1404
01:11:39,008 --> 01:11:40,542
Well, not yet.

1405
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,277
- But I was gonna do that.
- Uh-huh.

1406
01:11:42,278 --> 01:11:44,613
Yeah, if you weren't in here
arguing with me the whole time.

1407
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:46,081
Oh, George.

1408
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:47,916
I'm looking for the door that...

1409
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:49,784
- George.
- Yeah?

1410
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:51,419
- It's right behind you.
- Yeah, thought so.

1411
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,051
All right, thank you.
Step back.

1412
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:11,006
Zeus, where did everybody go?

1413
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,108
Pinch my tuchus
and call me Sally.

1414
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:14,342
You're alive.

1415
01:12:14,343 --> 01:12:17,412
Of course I'm alive.
What did you think?

1416
01:12:17,413 --> 01:12:19,214
Well, we all thought
you were a goner.

1417
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:22,784
No, I finished playing
with Medusa

1418
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:25,720
and I decided to go
for a stroll in the woods.

1419
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:27,555
It was such a nice day.

1420
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:29,524
And I walked and walked

1421
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:32,427
until I didn't know
where I was anymore.

1422
01:12:32,428 --> 01:12:35,930
Aren't cats supposed to have
a keen sense of direction?

1423
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:38,033
If you tell anyone
I'll kill you.

1424
01:12:38,034 --> 01:12:41,336
So if you're alive,
that means...

1425
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:43,204
oh boy.

1426
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:45,564
Zeus, what is it?

1427
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:49,477
There comes a time
in every dog's life

1428
01:12:49,478 --> 01:12:53,348
when you've got to grab the situation
with your paws and take control...

1429
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:55,550
storm or no storm.

1430
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,485
George and Belinda
are inside that house

1431
01:12:57,486 --> 01:12:59,921
and I am not about to let
anything happen to them.

1432
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:02,257
It's time to face my fears

1433
01:13:02,258 --> 01:13:05,026
and save Halloween.

1434
01:13:05,027 --> 01:13:07,227
[Monique]:
Where are you going?

1435
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:11,199
Where do you think
you're going, Blondie?

1436
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,735
Look, get out of my way.
I need to get inside the house...

1437
01:13:13,736 --> 01:13:16,237
and save my owner.
He thinks you did something to Rufus.

1438
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:18,306
Rufus? Please.

1439
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:19,774
I couldn't hurt him.

1440
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:22,210
- He's my sweetheart.
- Say what?

1441
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:26,114
I've been head over heels for that hunk
since the day we moved in.

1442
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:28,683
Oh, TMI.
Look, just let me in

1443
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:31,252
and I promise I'll explain
everything to you later.

1444
01:13:31,253 --> 01:13:33,121
- Fine.
- Thank you.

1445
01:13:33,122 --> 01:13:35,824
- Good luck, Blondie.
- Stop calling me that.

1446
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:37,752
(playing)

1447
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:42,625
Have no fear,
Zeus is here.

1448
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:46,000
Hello? George?

1449
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:49,971
Belinda?
Where are you guys?

1450
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:52,474
Don't be scared.
It's just a storm.

1451
01:13:52,475 --> 01:13:54,676
- (thunder crashes)
- Here we go.

1452
01:13:54,677 --> 01:13:56,611
One Mississippi.

1453
01:13:56,612 --> 01:13:58,539
Two Mississippi.

1454
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:04,385
Talk about some bad gas.
Yowch.

1455
01:14:04,386 --> 01:14:06,921
Hey, guys.
Can you hear me?

1456
01:14:06,922 --> 01:14:09,087
Rufus is alive.

1457
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:13,628
Jeepers creepers.
This house really is haunted.

1458
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:15,590
(barks)

1459
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:21,366
What are you looking at,
Sir Rustalot?

1460
01:14:22,071 --> 01:14:23,872
(whirrs)

1461
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:27,342
Wait a minute. What, does this ghost
run on electricity?

1462
01:14:27,343 --> 01:14:30,011
Hey. Hello.

1463
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:32,180
Yo, anybody in there?

1464
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:35,150
Hey, hello.

1465
01:14:35,151 --> 01:14:38,052
Hmm.

1466
01:14:38,053 --> 01:14:39,945
(powers down)

1467
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:44,817
Ha, not so spirited now,
are you, tough guy?

1468
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:52,033
- An off switch.
- (music stops)

1469
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:53,868
Hmm, this looks fun.

1470
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:56,160
(playing)

1471
01:14:59,608 --> 01:15:01,042
Never had one lesson.

1472
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:03,578
Huh, that dog wasn't half bad.

1473
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:07,415
Hello?
Where are you guys?

1474
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:09,184
I can do it.
I can do it.

1475
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:12,287
Come on, one Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

1476
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:15,056
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

1477
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:17,926
(sinister laughing)

1478
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:19,894
Okay, that's not in my head.

1479
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:22,831
Guys, where are you?

1480
01:15:22,832 --> 01:15:24,766
(barking)

1481
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:27,569
Is that Zeusy?
Zeus. Zeusy!

1482
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:30,805
- [George]: Zeus, in the attic.
- (barking)

1483
01:15:30,806 --> 01:15:33,597
Hang on George.
Zeus is coming to the rescue.

1484
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:36,878
All right, come on.
There's got to be some kind

1485
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:38,546
of hidden door behind
this shelf somewhere.

1486
01:15:38,547 --> 01:15:41,883
Push. Push. Push.
Push. Push.

1487
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:43,718
Come on, Zeusy.

1488
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:46,721
Now to find a way
to keep it from closing.

1489
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:49,257
Got it.
Here I come.

1490
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:52,927
- [George]: Oh, good dog.
- [Belinda]: Zeus.

1491
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:56,998
Georgie, I did it.
I conquered my fear of thunder.

1492
01:15:56,999 --> 01:15:58,433
[Ted]:
Now we can finally get out of here.

1493
01:15:58,434 --> 01:16:00,435
Not so fast.
There's something you need to see.

1494
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:02,931
What is it, Zeusy?

1495
01:16:06,976 --> 01:16:08,641
Ugh. Oh brother.

1496
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:11,913
(laughing)

1497
01:16:11,914 --> 01:16:14,512
Dude, that is one
scorching sunburn.

1498
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:16,879
(barks)

1499
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:21,289
[Stewey]:
The mutt's trying to tell us something.

1500
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,924
[Belinda]:
What is it, Zeusy?

1501
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:26,217
All right, you ready for this?
Check this out.

1502
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:32,901
What is that we're looking at?

1503
01:16:32,902 --> 01:16:35,703
[Zeus]: Huh? That's the house.
Look at that, every room.

1504
01:16:35,704 --> 01:16:37,939
He's been staging everything
the whole time.

1505
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,507
Don't you understand?

1506
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:42,543
Between the monitor and the board,
don't you understand, guys?

1507
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:46,648
Whenever somebody uses parentheses
and shapes we're not familiar with,

1508
01:16:46,649 --> 01:16:50,218
it means they're up to something.
"Countdown to zero hour".

1509
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:52,153
You know what this means, Belinda?

1510
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:55,223
Yes, George.
Haunted house.

1511
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:58,493
You know, Belinda,
I don't even know why I ask.

1512
01:16:58,494 --> 01:16:59,961
- George.
- Yeah?

1513
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:01,496
- Turn it around.
- What's that?

1514
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:03,890
Turn it around.

1515
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,736
"Haunted house plans"?

1516
01:17:08,737 --> 01:17:11,039
How do you explain the generators?

1517
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,774
None of this was real.

1518
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:15,209
I don't understand that.

1519
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,644
(siren blares)

1520
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:18,546
[Man]: This is the police.
We have the house surrounded.

1521
01:17:18,547 --> 01:17:20,815
- Come out with your hands up.
- Uh-oh, coppers.

1522
01:17:20,816 --> 01:17:23,017
- That sounds pretty real to me.
- Real real real.

1523
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:24,485
- I'm not going back to jail, Ted.
- I'm not going back to jail.

1524
01:17:24,486 --> 01:17:25,820
- They're gonna go back.
- You!

1525
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:28,556
We're not going to jail.
We didn't do anything, right?

1526
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:30,491
- You and your wife Little Miss Bo Peep.
- We work for you.

1527
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:31,926
I got no time for this stuff.

1528
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:34,286
I can't go to jail.
I'm a minor.

1529
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:37,799
[Mr. Weagle]:
There's an exit for you.

1530
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,202
Why am I not surprised?
You're a nightmare, Bannister.

1531
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:44,105
- You broke in the house.
- You belong behind bars.

1532
01:17:44,106 --> 01:17:46,107
Daddy.

1533
01:17:46,108 --> 01:17:47,508
Hey, honey.

1534
01:17:47,509 --> 01:17:50,578
Listen, you dad might be going
to the slammer for a little bit.

1535
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:54,215
Just make sure you're good
to your court appointed guardian.

1536
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:56,551
I'll look after them for you, G-man.

1537
01:17:56,552 --> 01:18:00,288
Yeah, not in 1000 years.

1538
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:03,091
- [George]: Officers, arrest this man.
- Cole: On what charge?

1539
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:05,460
Monique, Rufus' collar,
we found it in the house.

1540
01:18:05,461 --> 01:18:07,595
Georgie, about that, um...

1541
01:18:07,596 --> 01:18:10,264
Mr. Cole brought him back
this afternoon.

1542
01:18:10,265 --> 01:18:12,667
He'd found him lost in the woods
behind his house.

1543
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:14,635
He's fine. See?

1544
01:18:14,636 --> 01:18:16,404
Weagles, you were
at my meeting, right?

1545
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:18,873
The electron generators
that were stolen that night,

1546
01:18:18,874 --> 01:18:20,041
how do you explain it?

1547
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:22,744
Come on, Bannister.
That meeting was bogus.

1548
01:18:22,745 --> 01:18:25,413
And I want my easel back.

1549
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:27,081
They found those generators
last night.

1550
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:28,616
Yeah yeah yeah,
couple of low lives were out

1551
01:18:28,617 --> 01:18:31,252
looking for copper wire or something.
That's all it was.

1552
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:34,422
George, we should probably
quit while we're ahead here.

1553
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,457
Okay, how about this?

1554
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:39,961
I happen to call around to all
the colleges in the area.

1555
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:43,431
No one has ever heard
of Professor Eli Cole.

1556
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:46,501
Oh yeah. How do you like
them apples, Professor?

1557
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:48,269
- You called?
- Sure did.

1558
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,338
And you called
and you asked for Eli Cole?

1559
01:18:50,339 --> 01:18:51,773
You got that right.

1560
01:18:51,774 --> 01:18:54,442
Well, Eli is my nickname.

1561
01:18:54,443 --> 01:18:56,477
My real name is Cornelius.

1562
01:18:56,478 --> 01:19:00,415
I'm Professor Cornelius
of the drama department.

1563
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:03,051
- Seriously, George?
- Well, he's good.

1564
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:05,119
Mr. Cole, would you like
to press charges?

1565
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,756
Officer, I think this is a big
misunderstanding.

1566
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:10,291
Yeah, a big big big
misunderstanding.

1567
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:11,793
Yeah, yes.

1568
01:19:11,794 --> 01:19:14,996
Now look, I feel partially
responsible for this,

1569
01:19:14,997 --> 01:19:16,697
my work and my preoccupation.

1570
01:19:16,698 --> 01:19:19,367
I realize I could have
done a better job

1571
01:19:19,368 --> 01:19:23,004
at introducing myself to you
rather than, you know, bugging you.

1572
01:19:23,005 --> 01:19:24,672
Oh.

1573
01:19:24,673 --> 01:19:27,675
I do this every year,
this haunted house

1574
01:19:27,676 --> 01:19:30,078
for my nieces and nephews
and their friends.

1575
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:34,182
I enjoy them enjoying
my little special effects.

1576
01:19:34,183 --> 01:19:37,552
You know that...
that truck that came?

1577
01:19:37,553 --> 01:19:39,287
- That delivery?
- [George]: Yeah.

1578
01:19:39,288 --> 01:19:42,056
- Well, those are just props.
- Props?

1579
01:19:42,057 --> 01:19:45,226
Didn't you notice that the guys,
these messengers,

1580
01:19:45,227 --> 01:19:47,862
they had theatrical
costumes on.

1581
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:49,730
- Yeah, I just thought they were...
- (sighs)

1582
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:53,134
On second thought,
they were kind of strange uniforms.

1583
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:56,904
Professor Cole, on behalf of
the entire Bannister family,

1584
01:19:56,905 --> 01:20:00,675
I want to apologize for everything
that has happened here tonight.

1585
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,243
Right, George?

1586
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:03,845
- What about the...
- Right, George?

1587
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:06,314
- Yes yes.
- Apology accepted.

1588
01:20:06,315 --> 01:20:08,149
That's great.
Can we get these off, please?

1589
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:09,678
Thank you.

1590
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,454
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1591
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:16,757
- Hey, what's that?
- Hey, that's mine.

1592
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:19,026
How's that get there?

1593
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:20,795
Officer, a ghost!

1594
01:20:20,796 --> 01:20:23,531
- Hey, get 'em!
- Hey!

1595
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:25,500
I'll see you in nine to 12 months,
goofballs.

1596
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:27,702
- Send me a postcard.
- I had nothing to do with that.

1597
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:29,170
Hmm.

1598
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:31,272
[Belinda]: Well, listen listen.
We'll all get together.

1599
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:33,174
Everybody will come over
for swimming.

1600
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:36,110
- We have our own pool.
- I'm busy.

1601
01:20:36,111 --> 01:20:38,679
- Monique.
- Great job, Colombo.

1602
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,149
Be seeing you
when you get back, genius.

1603
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:42,884
Kent. Marilyn.

1604
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:44,886
Hey, where you going?
Give me a call tomorrow.

1605
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:47,255
[Kent]:
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me.

1606
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:48,990
(door slams)

1607
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:51,225
Come on, George.
Let's go home.

1608
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:54,195
And I'll make you some of your
favorite pumpkin cookies.

1609
01:20:54,196 --> 01:20:57,192
- With the chocolate in it?
- Mm-hmm.

1610
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:00,468
- Arr.
- Oh, George.

1611
01:21:00,469 --> 01:21:02,737
(giggles)
And you too, Zeusy.

1612
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:05,106
I'm gonna make you
something very special

1613
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:07,308
because you saved Halloween.
You did it.

1614
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:09,477
All in a day's work.

1615
01:21:09,478 --> 01:21:11,678
- [George]: Let's go, guys.
- [Belinda]: Come on.

1616
01:21:18,053 --> 01:21:20,321
¶ Creepy little thingies ¶

1617
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:21,923
¶ Crawling on my skin ¶

1618
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:24,458
¶ I just can't keep
from scratching ¶

1619
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:26,427
¶ Someone let them in ¶

1620
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:28,729
¶ Creepy little crawlies ¶

1621
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,731
¶ With tiny little feet ¶

1622
01:21:30,732 --> 01:21:35,036
¶ Get them off my body
so I can get some sleep... ¶

1623
01:21:35,037 --> 01:21:38,238
(children laughing, chatting)

1624
01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:47,538
Aw, this is the life.

1625
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:51,319
Well, if this isn't
the cutest bunch...

1626
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:54,255
of ghosts and goblins
you've ever seen.

1627
01:21:54,256 --> 01:21:57,325
Hey, who wants to go
trick or treating?

1628
01:21:57,326 --> 01:21:59,460
- [Kids]: Yeah!
- (doorbell rings)

1629
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:01,262
Oh, somebody's at the door.

1630
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:03,861
Trick or treaters.
Yay!

1631
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:06,834
Trick or treat!

1632
01:22:06,835 --> 01:22:08,536
Oh, hi.

1633
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:12,707
I have got Grandma's homemade
pretzels for you guys.

1634
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:14,508
Well, thanks,
but can I have some more?

1635
01:22:14,509 --> 01:22:16,277
- That's all I got.
- Are you sure?

1636
01:22:16,278 --> 01:22:18,212
- Those look yummy.
- Good.

1637
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:19,413
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1638
01:22:19,414 --> 01:22:22,483
Bye-bye, have fun.
Happy Halloween.

1639
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:24,685
- Hey, guys.
- [George]: Hey, Mom.

1640
01:22:24,686 --> 01:22:26,721
Well, hello.
Happy Halloween.

1641
01:22:26,722 --> 01:22:28,853
Hi, Grandma.

1642
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:32,393
Come on, we're just about
to go trick or treating.

1643
01:22:32,394 --> 01:22:35,263
- You too, Zeus.
- I'm gonna go get my costume on.

1644
01:22:35,264 --> 01:22:37,632
Hey, guys. So how's everything
with the new house?

1645
01:22:37,633 --> 01:22:40,234
- Not good. Not good.
- George.

1646
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:42,903
He had a little problem

1647
01:22:42,904 --> 01:22:44,839
with the man who lives next door.
So, you know.

1648
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,208
Maybe he's single.

1649
01:22:47,209 --> 01:22:49,076
Oh, he's definitely single.

1650
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:52,013
Bannister.
Zeus Bannister.

1651
01:22:52,014 --> 01:22:54,415
What's up, Doc?

1652
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:58,119
(high voice)
I'm here to audition for the black swan.

1653
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,921
You like to eat wampum?

1654
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:04,659
I'll take a kibble
shaken, not stirred.

1655
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:07,261
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1656
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:10,464
You ain't nothing
but a hound dog, baby.

1657
01:23:10,465 --> 01:23:12,460
I can't "ear" you.

1658
01:23:15,003 --> 01:23:16,871
- That looks perfect.
- Thanks, Dad.

1659
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:19,106
Guys, check me out.

1660
01:23:19,107 --> 01:23:20,875
Speaking of perfect,
look at this guy.

1661
01:23:20,876 --> 01:23:23,277
I'm licensed to trick or treat.
What do you think?

1662
01:23:23,278 --> 01:23:24,845
Can we please go
trick or treating now?

1663
01:23:24,846 --> 01:23:26,280
- Yes, honey.
- [Grandma]: No, no, no, no.

1664
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:29,450
No, wait until I take a picture
of my little munchkins first.

1665
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:31,952
Who are you calling munchkin?
I'm a certified K9.

1666
01:23:31,953 --> 01:23:33,954
Hey, Belinda, come out of the kitchen.

1667
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:36,590
Just putting some treats in the oven.
You go right ahead.

1668
01:23:36,591 --> 01:23:38,959
- Yeah, maybe we should do it later.
- Okay, I'll get a picture of her later.

1669
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,895
All right, everybody, come on.
Come on, come on. Ready?

1670
01:23:40,896 --> 01:23:43,998
- (doorbell rings)
- Oh, somebody's at the door.

1671
01:23:43,999 --> 01:23:47,462
Trick or treaters.
Oh, hold on. Let me get the door.

1672
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:53,307
Trick or treat.

1673
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:57,244
A little too old to go
trick or treating, aren't you?

1674
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:58,913
No.

1675
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:01,115
- (high voice) I mean, no.
- Uh, yeah.

1676
01:24:01,116 --> 01:24:03,050
Uh-huh, I'm gonna say
that you are.

1677
01:24:03,051 --> 01:24:05,319
- No no no no no.
- I'm gonna call the police.

1678
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,288
- Don't call the police.
- Get away from here!

1679
01:24:07,289 --> 01:24:10,091
Don't call the police.

1680
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:12,159
Does she look familiar to you?

1681
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,661
That's the fourth house in a row.

1682
01:24:13,662 --> 01:24:16,163
- I told you you're too old.
- Give me some eggs.

1683
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:18,366
We egged the last house.

1684
01:24:18,367 --> 01:24:20,701
- Give me the toilet paper then.
- All right, fine.

1685
01:24:20,702 --> 01:24:23,104
