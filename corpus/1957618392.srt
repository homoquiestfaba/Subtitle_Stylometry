Could be.

How long have you lived there?

196
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,733
- Just after I was tenured.

00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:24,032

202

I never met her before.

00:55:24,766 --> 00:55:26,566
- Does Matt know you're back.

1096
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:27,832
- I don't know.

1097
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:30,832
If he does, he doesn't want to talk.

1098
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:33,932
Is there anything to drink?

1099
00:55:34,032 --> 00:55:35,932
- Well, yes.

1100
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,266
- Could you get me something?

1101
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:41,633
Some scotch?

1102
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,432
- Quite a show you put on.

1103
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,899
- A show?

1104
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:13,965
- I'm not implying that you were insincere of course.

1105
00:56:14,065 --> 00:56:15,099
- Of course.

1106
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:19,832
You don't seem too upset.

1107
00:56:19,932 --> 00:56:23,599
- You know how it is, heat and rut.

1108
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:28,533
My emotions are skewed.

1109
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:31,299
- Yeah.

1110
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:34,999
Well, I suppose I owe you an apology.

1111
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:35,965
- You guess.

1112
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:37,799
You're not sure?

1113
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:39,266
- I'm not good at it.

1114
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:43,366
I'm sorry.

1115
00:56:45,132 --> 00:56:48,199
I didn't mean what I said about you or Nancy.

1116
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:51,466
- You can tell Nancy that.

1117
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:04,065
- That was amazing what she said to me.

1118
00:57:05,132 --> 00:57:06,332
- Amazing?

1119
00:57:06,432 --> 00:57:10,332
- She hadn't been talking to me, I'd have felt like applauding.

1120
00:57:10,432 --> 00:57:12,733
- You do know that I know.

1121
00:57:12,832 --> 00:57:14,733
- Know what?

1122
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:17,899
- The fifty dollars.

1123
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:20,633
- Please.

1124
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:23,399
Don't bring that up again.

1125
00:57:23,499 --> 00:57:25,899
Tomorrow, if you have to.

1126
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:28,599
- All right.

1127
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:32,432
But you will admit that you do know that I know.

1128
00:57:36,965 --> 00:57:38,766
- You're being a bore.

1129
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,533
- I am a bore.

1130
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:45,799
I lead a placid life.

1131
00:57:55,633 --> 00:57:59,099
- You said you wanted me.

1132
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:02,166
You said you wanted me to say yes to you.

1133
00:58:02,266 --> 00:58:03,132
- Yes.

1134
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:08,232
I said, "you do know that I know,

1135
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:11,132
"and I wanted you to say yes.

1136
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:16,332
- I said yes.

1137
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:19,666
Right answer to the wrong question?

1138
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:33,166
What I think is you want to fuck me and now you're here,

1139
00:58:33,266 --> 00:58:38,199
and you're too chickenshit to go through with it.

1140
00:58:50,232 --> 00:58:51,932
Am I wrong?

1141
00:59:17,499 --> 00:59:19,599
- Morning.

1142
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:20,666
- Oh, hi.

1143
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:21,633
You been up long?

1144
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:23,266
- A while.

1145
00:59:23,366 --> 00:59:24,332
An hour maybe.

1146
00:59:24,432 --> 00:59:25,533
- What time's your meeting?

1147
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:27,032
- Eleven.

1148
00:59:27,132 --> 00:59:27,865
Sleep okay?

1149
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:29,232
- Yeah, you?

1150
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,032
- No, actually I didn't.

1151
00:59:35,232 --> 00:59:35,766
- What's the matter?

1152
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:36,399
You're not feeling well?

1153
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:39,932
- No, I'm not.

1154
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:45,399
I'm--not feeling terribly well at all.

1155
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:49,965
- Is this about Kim?

1156
00:59:50,065 --> 00:59:51,899
I heard her, at some point.

1157
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:55,999
- Yeah, well, I'd be surprised if you hadn't.

1158
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:56,733
- Why?

1159
00:59:56,832 --> 00:59:58,666
Was she loud?

1160
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:01,832
- Well, she wasn't exactly yelling,

1161
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,899
if that's what you mean.

1162
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:05,099
- I don't think I mean anything.

1163
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,466
- You don't think you do?

1164
01:00:06,566 --> 01:00:08,899
Christ Nancy, can you never say anything without equivocating?

1165
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:11,533
- Now, what's the matter?

1166
01:00:11,633 --> 01:00:12,599
Did you have a fight?

1167
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:15,466
- No, look, um, I think the best thing will

1168
01:00:15,566 --> 01:00:17,733
be first to get out of here.

1169
01:00:17,832 --> 01:00:21,832
We can get a--I can get a hotel.

1170
01:00:21,932 --> 01:00:24,299
You really have been more than gracious.

1171
01:00:24,399 --> 01:00:25,032
- Matt.

1172
01:00:25,132 --> 01:00:26,032
- And I really appreciate it.

1173
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:27,699
It's just I can't stay here any longer.

1174
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:30,766
- Matt, I'm--I'm not asking you to leave.

1175
01:00:30,865 --> 01:00:31,865
- Well, maybe you should.

1176
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:34,199
Maybe you should do exactly that.

1177
01:00:34,299 --> 01:00:36,032
- I didn't take it personally.

1178
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,332
She's young.

1179
01:00:38,432 --> 01:00:43,666
She's smart and arrogant and high-strung.

1180
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:45,666
So was I at her age.

1181
01:00:45,766 --> 01:00:46,999
So were you.

1182
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:49,199
- Oh, for Christ's sake, will you stop being so fucking noble?

1183
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:50,932
She's a deceitful little slut.

1184
01:00:51,032 --> 01:00:53,132
I am humiliated being associated with her,

1185
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,132
let alone bringing her into your home.

1186
01:01:00,499 --> 01:01:02,032
- Well, if that's the way you feel, I--

1187
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:04,633
- The way I feel?

1188
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:06,366
The way I feel?

1189
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:07,865
You think this is only about me?

1190
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:10,466
- I said I didn't take it personally.

1191
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:14,965
- She fucked your husband.

1192
01:01:15,065 --> 01:01:16,099
- What did you say?

1193
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:17,032
- Last night.

1194
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,899
In your own living room, all right?

1195
01:01:22,533 --> 01:01:23,499
- You saw this?

1196
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:26,865
- I heard them.

1197
01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:01,132
- You bastard.

1198
01:02:02,432 --> 01:02:03,733
- What?

1199
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:07,299
- You simpering coward.

1200
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:10,166
You're pathetic.

1201
01:02:13,466 --> 01:02:16,865
And you use your self-pity the way another man would use drink,

1202
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:20,666
to dredge up the shriveled sack of gall that passes

1203
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:22,566
for you as guts.

1204
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:24,065
- What are you talking about?

1205
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,466
- She's too strong for you, and too independent,

1206
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:28,299
and you can't deal with it.

1207
01:02:28,399 --> 01:02:30,599
And since you don't have the guts to hurt her,

1208
01:02:30,699 --> 01:02:33,232
you try to hurt me and blame it on her.

1209
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,432
Shame on you!

1210
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:35,999
- She fucked your husband!

1211
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:37,266
- I won't hear it!

1212
01:02:42,899 --> 01:02:44,132
- She fucked your husband!

1213
01:02:44,232 --> 01:02:45,566
- Not in my house! Do you hear me?

1214
01:02:46,032 --> 01:02:46,899
- Jesus, Nancy!

1215
01:02:46,999 --> 01:02:47,865
What's going on?

1216
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:48,733
- Why don't you ask him?

1217
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:49,999
- No!

1218
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,232
- Ask me what?

1219
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:52,132
- Nothing.

1220
01:02:52,232 --> 01:02:52,865
Nothing at all!

1221
01:02:52,965 --> 01:02:54,466
- And you call me gutless?

1222
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:55,566
- It's not true!

1223
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:56,899
- Well, then ask him!

1224
01:02:56,999 --> 01:02:58,566
- What is going on?

1225
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,899
- Ask him.

1226
01:03:00,999 --> 01:03:01,566
- No!

1227
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:03,766
- You want me to ask him?

1228
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:05,832
- According to you, there's nothing to ask.

1229
01:03:05,932 --> 01:03:06,499
You know.

1230
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:07,132
You heard.

1231
01:03:07,232 --> 01:03:09,032
So, you just tell him.

1232
01:03:09,132 --> 01:03:10,266
Just tell him.

1233
01:03:14,932 --> 01:03:17,366
- I heard you and Kim last night.

1234
01:03:17,466 --> 01:03:18,832
- Yes?

1235
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:20,199
So?

1236
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:23,766
- You were with her?

1237
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:25,065
- Yes, I was.

1238
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:27,199
- What are you saying?

1239
01:03:27,299 --> 01:03:28,399
- What do you mean?

1240
01:03:28,499 --> 01:03:29,299
- What are you saying?

1241
01:03:29,399 --> 01:03:30,533
What were you doing with her?

1242
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:31,633
- Not much.

1243
01:03:31,733 --> 01:03:32,899
I came down here to get some juice,

1244
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:34,699
since she was here we talked a little while.

1245
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,166
Would someone please tell me what this is all about?

1246
01:03:37,266 --> 01:03:39,999
- Well, Matt says that ah, you...

1247
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:42,299
- You're lying.

1248
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:43,399
- I'm lying?

1249
01:03:45,766 --> 01:03:46,832
I'm lying?

1250
01:03:46,932 --> 01:03:47,999
Haha.

1251
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:50,099
Do you mind if I get some coffee?

1252
01:03:53,899 --> 01:03:56,232
What--what are you saying?

1253
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,666
Are you--if you're accusing me of something, just say it.

1254
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:00,533
- I--I'm not...

1255
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,466
- Just say it!

1256
01:04:02,566 --> 01:04:06,199
You called me a liar you fucking moron!

1257
01:04:14,132 --> 01:04:15,399
- I heard you.

1258
01:04:15,499 --> 01:04:19,733
I heard you fu--you were having intercourse with Kim last night.

1259
01:04:19,832 --> 01:04:21,065
- You heard me.

1260
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,366
Heard me?

1261
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:23,499
What did you hear?

1262
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,299
My voice?

1263
01:04:24,399 --> 01:04:25,832
No, please, tell me.

1264
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:27,932
A gnashing friction, the lubricous,

1265
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:30,366
suctioned pop of the act itself?

1266
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:31,132
- You know damn well.

1267
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:32,232
I heard you, and I heard Kim.

1268
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:34,166
- You don't believe this crap, do you?

1269
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:36,599
- No.

1270
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:37,566
- What? Why?

1271
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,232
Why would I make it up for God's sake?

1272
01:04:39,332 --> 01:04:40,699
- Oh, yes, that is the question.

1273
01:04:42,399 --> 01:04:43,599
- I told you why.

1274
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:44,466
- How can you believe that?

1275
01:04:44,566 --> 01:04:45,399
- Believe what?

1276
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:47,832
Good morning.

1277
01:04:47,932 --> 01:04:49,399
- Morning.

1278
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:52,965
It seems your boyfriend here heard us screwing

1279
01:04:53,065 --> 01:04:56,699
on the living room couch.

1280
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,366
- Really?

1281
01:04:58,466 --> 01:05:00,733
As if I hadn't done enough already.

1282
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:06,766
- He says he heard you.

1283
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:10,099
He heard your voice.

1284
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:11,332
- Do you believe that?

1285
01:05:15,065 --> 01:05:18,766
It's, of course, completely, totally untrue.

1286
01:05:18,865 --> 01:05:19,766
- You're denying it, then?

1287
01:05:19,865 --> 01:05:21,633
Both of you?

1288
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:24,032
- Nothing took place last night.

1289
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:25,832
- Nothing took place last night.

1290
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:27,166
That's your position, then?

1291
01:05:27,266 --> 01:05:30,499
I mean, and your position is what, that I'm lying,

1292
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:34,099
I'm--I was dreaming, I'm delusional?

1293
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,199
- I don't know what to think.

1294
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:39,999
- What do you think you heard, Matt?

1295
01:05:45,366 --> 01:05:47,266
- I heard you.

1296
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:48,799
- What was I saying?

1297
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:53,733
- You were saying--you were making sounds of passion,

1298
01:05:53,832 --> 01:05:57,466
and I heard--I heard you, you were cumming.

1299
01:05:57,566 --> 01:06:00,965
- How would you know what I sound like when I cum?

1300
01:06:03,865 --> 01:06:05,599
- You are a bitch.

1301
01:06:18,399 --> 01:06:20,699
- I'm relieved you don't believe him.

1302
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:29,466
I'd just as soon not admit this, but I'm afraid if I don't,

1303
01:06:29,566 --> 01:06:37,099
you may come to wonder about-- I mean he's not delusional,

1304
01:06:37,965 --> 01:06:45,199
and he says he heard us, and...I don't quite know how

1305
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:47,366
to say this.

1306
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:52,299
- What?

1307
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:54,432
- I was masturbating.

1308
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:56,132
- Oh Jesus Christ!

1309
01:06:56,232 --> 01:06:57,366
- That's what he heard.

1310
01:07:00,899 --> 01:07:04,766
- Well, I guess that's a relief.

1311
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:09,432
This was after you went to bed, I assume.

1312
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:10,666
- Uh, yes.

1313
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:11,899
I'm afraid so.

1314
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,633
I guess her seeing me in my robe,

1315
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:17,132
she just couldn't restrain herself.

1316
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:19,032
- God, I'm so embarrassed.

1317
01:07:19,132 --> 01:07:19,965
- We're all adults here.

1318
01:07:20,065 --> 01:07:22,099
We're familiar with the exercise.

1319
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:26,899
I just hope, as your host, that you found everything

1320
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:28,999
you needed in the kitchen.

1321
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:36,432
- So that's what this is, then?

1322
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:37,766
A joke?

1323
01:07:37,865 --> 01:07:42,199
Her playing with herself, that's the punch line, I'm the butt?

1324
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:45,232
- Well, you're the one that went off half-cocked,

1325
01:07:45,332 --> 01:07:48,432
telling me I cheated on my wife, calling me a liar.

1326
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:50,999
You better me goddamn grateful we're treating this as a joke.

1327
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:51,766
- Yeah.

1328
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:52,499
Well, I've got an appointment.

1329
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:54,399
This isn't over.

1330
01:07:54,499 --> 01:07:59,299
I'm not a liar, and I won't be set up as one.

1331
01:08:08,832 --> 01:08:13,999
[BELLS TOLLING]

1332
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,266
- Dr. Harper?

1333
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:34,466
- Oh, hi Mr. Carroll.

1334
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:35,332
- Yes.

1335
01:08:35,432 --> 01:08:36,232
- Do come in.

1336
01:08:36,332 --> 01:08:37,132
- Oh, thank you.

1337
01:08:37,232 --> 01:08:38,466
Thank you very much.

1338
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:39,633
I'm so happy to meet you finally.

1339
01:08:39,733 --> 01:08:40,599
- Oh, thank you.

1340
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:41,366
- I'm such an admirer of the Journal.

1341
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:42,832
- Oh good.

1342
01:08:42,932 --> 01:08:44,366
Sit down, please.

1343
01:08:44,466 --> 01:08:45,299
- Okay, thank you.

1344
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:47,965
I have--I have my--

1345
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,399
- Let me get right to the point.

1346
01:08:53,499 --> 01:08:55,666
Oh, can I offer you some tea?

1347
01:08:55,766 --> 01:08:56,733
- Uh, no thanks.

1348
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:57,399
- Oh.

1349
01:08:57,499 --> 01:08:59,699
I'm having some.

1350
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:01,999
Are--are you sure I can't interest you in some?

1351
01:09:02,099 --> 01:09:04,099
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

1352
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:06,099
- It's wild cherry.

1353
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:09,266
Mm!

1354
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:11,299
I love wild cherry.

1355
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:13,366
Do you like wild cherry?

1356
01:09:13,466 --> 01:09:15,466
- I--I don't know.

1357
01:09:15,566 --> 01:09:19,032
Uh, chamomile I like sometimes.

1358
01:09:19,132 --> 01:09:24,965
- I find that chamomile gives me gastric distress.

1359
01:09:26,999 --> 01:09:30,733
Um, I read your article last week,

1360
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:34,432
and I had my colleagues look it over too.

1361
01:09:34,533 --> 01:09:39,733
It was ah...very interesting.

1362
01:09:39,832 --> 01:09:41,299
- Thank you very much.

1363
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:42,633
Thank you very much.

1364
01:09:42,733 --> 01:09:45,766
- Mr. Carroll, we are not going to publish the article.

1365
01:09:45,865 --> 01:09:49,499
- Because Schumann himself is a fascinating subject to--

1366
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:51,965
What do you mean you're not going to publish?

1367
01:09:52,065 --> 01:09:53,032
What do you mean?

1368
01:09:53,132 --> 01:09:55,800
- Well, it's the opinion of the editorial board

1369
01:09:55,899 --> 01:10:00,266
that we cannot publish an article that maintains,

1370
01:10:00,366 --> 01:10:04,232
such as your article maintains, without the risk of,

1371
01:10:04,332 --> 01:10:07,832
I--I think it's more certainty than risk,

1372
01:10:07,932 --> 01:10:11,232
of making the Journal, and, with it,

1373
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,932
the entire discipline of musicology,

1374
01:10:15,032 --> 01:10:17,266
an academic laughingstock.

1375
01:10:19,065 --> 01:10:22,999
I mean, suppose, uh, we agreed that there's no hoax.

1376
01:10:23,099 --> 01:10:24,832
- Right.

1377
01:10:24,932 --> 01:10:25,965
- Well, what then?

1378
01:10:26,065 --> 01:10:28,432
Computer consciousness?

1379
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:35,132
Luther's spirit alive in the silicon?

1380
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:41,166
We are--we are musicologists, Mr. Carroll, not card readers.

1381
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:43,733
- Well the fact remains, Dr. Harper, the quote is there.

1382
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:45,533
It's there.

1383
01:10:45,633 --> 01:10:47,065
- Well, let me ask you this.

1384
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:49,965
It has nothing to do with the--this matter, really,

1385
01:10:50,065 --> 01:10:52,366
but it's out of curiosity.

1386
01:10:52,466 --> 01:10:56,366
Um, what do you think about this?

1387
01:10:56,466 --> 01:10:57,432
- What do you mean?

1388
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,099
When I first learned of it?

1389
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:04,065
Well, I don't know.

1390
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,865
I--I accepted it.

1391
01:11:05,965 --> 01:11:07,032
There it was.

1392
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:09,332
It's not anything to build a church to,

1393
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:11,832
and it's not to be taken as a sign of something,

1394
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:12,766
but it happened.

1395
01:11:12,865 --> 01:11:14,699
It happened.

1396
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,199
For months afterwards, I kind of walked around

1397
01:11:16,299 --> 01:11:17,466
with a big grin on my face.

1398
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:18,566
Ha!

1399
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:19,965
Do you know what I'm saying?

1400
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:22,399
- That's charming.

1401
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:27,965
Nevertheless, the quote was found by a computer?

1402
01:11:28,065 --> 01:11:31,865
- Yes, Kim ran a series of programs through the piece

1403
01:11:31,965 --> 01:11:34,633
to try to seek out non-random patterns.

1404
01:11:34,733 --> 01:11:36,132
- That's Ms. Matthews?

1405
01:11:36,232 --> 01:11:38,666
- Yes.

1406
01:11:38,766 --> 01:11:39,332
What?

1407
01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:40,733
What about Ms. Matthews?

1408
01:11:40,832 --> 01:11:42,332
- Do you know her well?

1409
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:48,865
- It's funny, though, isn't it?

1410
01:11:48,965 --> 01:11:51,832
- What's funny?

1411
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:53,932
- You did what I did.

1412
01:11:54,032 --> 01:11:57,099
Neither of us believed him.

1413
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:00,466
You chose to disbelieve Matt and to believe Wes and me.

1414
01:12:02,232 --> 01:12:05,699
- I don't think I believed or disbelieved.

1415
01:12:05,799 --> 01:12:08,766
Your explanation answered Matt's question.

1416
01:12:10,899 --> 01:12:16,166
Not to mention a knowledge of my husband that makes

1417
01:12:16,266 --> 01:12:18,832
Matt's accusation impossible.

1418
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:24,132
- Belief, not knowledge.

1419
01:12:24,232 --> 01:12:26,099
- Fine, belief.

1420
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:29,232
- And this belief keeps you from considering that your

1421
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:31,499
husband could make love to me in your living room

1422
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:35,232
and then join me in lying to cover it up.

1423
01:12:35,332 --> 01:12:36,566
- Yes, it does.

1424
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:37,832
- Although, if the first were true,

1425
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:40,499
the second would be more likely too, wouldn't it?

1426
01:12:40,599 --> 01:12:41,965
- No, I don't think so.

1427
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:47,232
If I were foolish enough to risk my marriage by having an affair,

1428
01:12:47,332 --> 01:12:49,899
I would not aggravate it by lying.

1429
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:51,199
- Really?

1430
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:52,533
Well, in a game most people with one foot in the shit will

1431
01:12:52,633 --> 01:12:53,899
go double or nothing.

1432
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:57,266
- Well, as so happens, I do not have one foot in the shit.

1433
01:12:57,366 --> 01:13:01,432
And we are not playing a game.

1434
01:13:01,533 --> 01:13:03,199
- Really?

1435
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:04,965
- What does she feel about the quote?

1436
01:13:05,065 --> 01:13:07,266
Does she believe the computer did it?

1437
01:13:07,366 --> 01:13:09,633
- She thinks I think that's possible.

1438
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:14,999
- Oh, she thinks, you think--Really, Mr. Carroll,

1439
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:18,132
well, look, I don't mistrust you,

1440
01:13:18,232 --> 01:13:21,899
and I--I'd rather not see your reputation tarnished,

1441
01:13:21,999 --> 01:13:24,666
but this is a crock of shit.

1442
01:13:27,832 --> 01:13:29,199
- How?

1443
01:13:29,299 --> 01:13:29,932
What do you mean?

1444
01:13:30,032 --> 01:13:30,932
How do you--?

1445
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,299
- I mean somebody has done this.

1446
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:36,499
- It's--it's a hoax, pure and simple.

1447
01:13:36,599 --> 01:13:37,999
- It's not possible.

1448
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:38,965
It's just not possible.

1449
01:13:39,065 --> 01:13:40,132
We worked on copies only.

1450
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:41,499
We never even touched the original.

1451
01:13:42,999 --> 01:13:44,065
What? What?

1452
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:48,832
- Look, I was told at MIT that the checking software

1453
01:13:48,932 --> 01:13:52,899
could have been written to alter what it checked.

1454
01:13:52,999 --> 01:13:56,232
Even the original could have been changed.

1455
01:13:56,332 --> 01:14:02,332
- Are you accusing Ms. Matthews of--Well,

1456
01:14:02,432 --> 01:14:04,299
what about Schumann?

1457
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,566
I mean, it's possible Schumann, Schumann could have--

1458
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:08,666
he could have been--

1459
01:14:08,766 --> 01:14:11,599
- Mr. Carroll, we are not going to publish your

1460
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:16,599
research, and your credibility as a scholar is breached.

1461
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:20,166
Yours and Ms. Matthews.

1462
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:23,766
- Are you saying that's what happened?

1463
01:14:23,865 --> 01:14:25,633
- Why don't you ask him?

1464
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:27,399
- Do you think I'm afraid to?

1465
01:14:27,499 --> 01:14:29,065
- Nancy.

1466
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,499
She's toying with you.

1467
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,232
- And what about you, Wes?

1468
01:14:32,332 --> 01:14:33,032
- What?

1469
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:34,599
- Don't insult me.

1470
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:35,566
- Oh.

1471
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:36,633
What are you saying?

1472
01:14:36,733 --> 01:14:37,865
That you believe him?

1473
01:14:37,965 --> 01:14:39,266
That you believe her?

1474
01:14:39,366 --> 01:14:41,132
Hm?

1475
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:44,666
- You tell me it isn't true.

1476
01:14:45,832 --> 01:14:47,499
You.

1477
01:14:47,599 --> 01:14:50,065
I don't want to hear some confection that you and this

1478
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:51,965
little thief agreed upon.

1479
01:14:52,065 --> 01:14:53,266
- Thief?

1480
01:14:53,366 --> 01:14:55,099
You're calling me a thief now?

1481
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,633
- Actually, I'm quoting.

1482
01:14:56,733 --> 01:14:59,432
Wes thinks you stole fifty dollars from his wallet.

1483
01:14:59,533 --> 01:15:00,899
- Nancy!

1484
01:15:00,999 --> 01:15:03,065
- He's been quite obsessed with it.

1485
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:05,299
- Really?

1486
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:07,865
- And with you too, apparently.

1487
01:15:07,965 --> 01:15:10,099
- Don't do this.

1488
01:15:13,533 --> 01:15:14,399
- Why not?

1489
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:18,699
We're all getting things off our chests.

1490
01:15:18,799 --> 01:15:19,599
Go ahead.

1491
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:20,633
Come clean.

1492
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:24,399
- Go ahead, Wes.

1493
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:27,399
- All right, you both want this?

1494
01:15:42,032 --> 01:15:44,099
- Last night I came in here.

1495
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:46,366
I--I was awake.

1496
01:15:46,466 --> 01:15:50,599
I was going to make a drink or something, and she was here,

1497
01:15:50,699 --> 01:15:52,432
sitting in the dark.

1498
01:15:52,533 --> 01:15:54,599
I didn't know it.

1499
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:57,232
She didn't say anything at first.

1500
01:15:57,332 --> 01:15:59,699
She started talking about what happened earlier.

1501
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:01,733
Apologizing.

1502
01:16:01,832 --> 01:16:04,865
I could smell that she'd been drinking.

1503
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:07,733
She was physically loose, presumptuous, and crude,

1504
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:12,232
so she came on to me.

1505
01:16:12,332 --> 01:16:14,032
I have no reason to deny it.

1506
01:16:14,132 --> 01:16:15,999
She even kissed me, but I felt no attraction

1507
01:16:16,099 --> 01:16:19,699
for her so I went back to bed as quickly as possible.

1508
01:16:21,432 --> 01:16:24,299
So much for my obsession.

1509
01:16:25,799 --> 01:16:30,332
As for the other thing, yes, I do think you stole

1510
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:35,099
fifty dollars from me and that you are a damn thief.

1511
01:16:37,899 --> 01:16:39,999
- You've gone a little far, haven't you?

1512
01:16:40,099 --> 01:16:41,332
- That from you?

1513
01:16:41,432 --> 01:16:43,865
- Talk about protesting too much.

1514
01:16:43,965 --> 01:16:46,832
- I'm sick of your damn voice.

1515
01:16:46,932 --> 01:16:50,366
- For the record, he did make love to me last night.

1516
01:16:50,466 --> 01:16:52,666
- I did not.

1517
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,266
- Uh, Doctor--hi guys.

1518
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:58,566
- Dr. Harper has been looking at our research at Harvard

1519
01:16:58,666 --> 01:17:00,799
and at the electronic music lab at MIT,

1520
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:02,366
and the Luther quote, ha!

1521
01:17:02,466 --> 01:17:03,733
It's a hoax.

1522
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:04,865
A pure and simple hoax.

1523
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:05,766
- What?

1524
01:17:05,865 --> 01:17:06,499
- What?

1525
01:17:06,599 --> 01:17:07,599
You sound a little surprised.

1526
01:17:07,699 --> 01:17:08,533
- What's that supposed to mean?

1527
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:09,533
Of course I'm surprised.

1528
01:17:09,633 --> 01:17:10,499
- The piece was altered by a subprogram

1529
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:11,932
in your software.

1530
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:14,633
That is to say that you deliberately tampered

1531
01:17:14,733 --> 01:17:16,032
with Schumann's work.

1532
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,266
- That's not true.

1533
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,599
- So this little prank, I don't know, whatever it was,

1534
01:17:18,699 --> 01:17:21,965
that cost us about a year or maybe a year and a half of very

1535
01:17:22,065 --> 01:17:24,932
hard work, it's all garbage now.

1536
01:17:25,032 --> 01:17:26,432
And also means that your career is finished

1537
01:17:26,533 --> 01:17:29,599
and maybe you're facing civil, maybe criminal charges.

1538
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:31,299
I sure hope it was worth it.

1539
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:33,499
- I didn't tamper with Schumann's work.

1540
01:17:33,599 --> 01:17:35,199
- Oh, you didn't?

1541
01:17:35,299 --> 01:17:37,599
Oh, well well, the thing is that it's not really

1542
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:38,800
my affair anymore.

1543
01:17:38,899 --> 01:17:41,666
But the truth is that they say they can prove it,

1544
01:17:41,766 --> 01:17:43,832
and I have no reason to doubt it.

1545
01:17:43,932 --> 01:17:44,799
- Me? Me?

1546
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:45,899
I'm your reason.

1547
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:47,566
I'm saying it isn't true.

1548
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:48,865
- Yeah.

1549
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:49,832
If I were you, I'd--my advice to you would be to confess,

1550
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:51,432
and then I would get medical attention.

1551
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,232
- Your advice?

1552
01:17:53,332 --> 01:17:54,099
- Mhm.

1553
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:55,332
- You think I'm crazy?

1554
01:17:55,432 --> 01:17:56,599
- No, I think that someone whose career is in jeopardy

1555
01:17:56,699 --> 01:17:59,432
as the result of a willful and self-destructive act would

1556
01:17:59,533 --> 01:18:01,999
not hurt her situation any by admitting it straight

1557
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:04,332
away and seeking treatment.

1558
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:08,299
And I can tell you that I think Dr. Harper feels almost

1559
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:09,699
exactly the same way.

1560
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,666
- Fuck you and fuck that.

1561
01:18:11,766 --> 01:18:12,733
This is bullshit.

1562
01:18:12,832 --> 01:18:13,999
There is no proof.

1563
01:18:14,099 --> 01:18:14,766
There can't be.

1564
01:18:14,865 --> 01:18:16,132
I didn't do it.

1565
01:18:16,232 --> 01:18:16,766
- I can't say that I expected you really to behave reasonably

1566
01:18:16,865 --> 01:18:17,999
about this.

1567
01:18:18,099 --> 01:18:18,733
- And you, Matt?

1568
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:19,899
You believed her?

1569
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:20,799
- Well, why shouldn't I?

1570
01:18:20,899 --> 01:18:22,733
I'm no computer expert, really.

1571
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:25,065
- Because you believed me, that's why.

1572
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:27,299
Because you know I wouldn't do that.

1573
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:36,832
The quote was there.

1574
01:18:36,932 --> 01:18:38,965
- Yeah, just like your fifty bucks.

1575
01:18:40,766 --> 01:18:42,266
- You bastard.

1576
01:18:44,232 --> 01:18:47,099
You weak fucking bastard.

1577
01:18:48,999 --> 01:18:51,899
You see what you've done?

1578
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:53,099
- What we've done?

1579
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:54,432
- You caused this.

1580
01:18:54,533 --> 01:18:55,999
- I?

1581
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:59,232
- You had the vulgar audacity to suspect me of stealing money

1582
01:18:59,332 --> 01:19:00,432
from you.

1583
01:19:00,533 --> 01:19:02,132
How dare you?

1584
01:19:02,232 --> 01:19:04,699
- You invite those suspicions.

1585
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,499
You court them with your incessant game-playing.

1586
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:08,499
As you like it.

1587
01:19:08,599 --> 01:19:10,865
So don't throw it at us.

1588
01:19:10,965 --> 01:19:11,699
- Oh?

1589
01:19:11,799 --> 01:19:13,299
Well, forget suspicions.

1590
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:14,965
Try facts.

1591
01:19:15,065 --> 01:19:16,865
He did fuck me last night.

1592
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:17,633
- Well, that's enough!

1593
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:18,666
- And he wasn't playing games!

1594
01:19:19,132 --> 01:19:21,699
- Stop!

1595
01:19:25,965 --> 01:19:27,666
- What went on in that meeting?

1596
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,399
It's a set-up isn't it?

1597
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:32,766
Harper wouldn't publish the article,

1598
01:19:32,865 --> 01:19:35,633
and she designated me as the reason, and you agreed.

1599
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:36,466
Isn't it?

1600
01:19:36,566 --> 01:19:37,232
- No.

1601
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:38,800
- A fucking set-up!

1602
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,166
- No, it isn't.

1603
01:19:40,266 --> 01:19:43,633
- You sold me out, and you don't even have the guts to admit it.

1604
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:51,399
[CRYING]

1605
01:20:31,132 --> 01:20:33,566
- Bye bye.

1606
01:22:09,332 --> 01:22:11,132
- Hi.

1607
01:22:12,332 --> 01:22:13,766
- Hi, honey.

1608
01:22:25,633 --> 01:22:26,733
- You okay?

1609
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:28,232
- Yeah.

1610
01:22:31,099 --> 01:22:33,332
- You can be reconsidered you know?

1611
01:22:33,432 --> 01:22:34,366
For tenure?

1612
01:22:37,865 --> 01:22:39,132
And we're fine.

1613
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,266
Financially.

1614
01:22:49,466 --> 01:22:50,965
- Yeah, I was thinking, this spring I might do something

1615
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:52,432
back here.

1616
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:56,032
- Sure.

1617
01:22:56,132 --> 01:22:59,065
- Build something, maybe.

1618
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:00,332
From wood.

1619
01:23:02,432 --> 01:23:05,299
- That sounds manly.

1620
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:07,633
Build something from wood.

1621
01:23:10,132 --> 01:23:11,566
With tools.

1622
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:13,132
From your shop.

1623
01:23:13,832 --> 01:23:14,399
Like what?

1624
01:23:14,499 --> 01:23:15,666
Like a fence?

1625
01:23:15,766 --> 01:23:16,965
- Hm.

1626
01:23:17,065 --> 01:23:18,299
A fe--yeah, a fence.

1627
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:20,766
Just run a fence right across the lawn.

1628
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:21,533
- Well, like what?

1629
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:22,899
An arbor maybe?

1630
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:24,399
- No, I was thinking of an outhouse.

1631
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,366
Or maybe a bomb shelter.

1632
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:29,132
- Bomb shelter's good.

1633
01:23:29,232 --> 01:23:30,599
Or a 7-11?

1634
01:23:30,699 --> 01:23:32,032
Make some money while you're at it.

1635
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:33,599
- Mhm.

1636
01:23:33,699 --> 01:23:35,432
- Or a Cineplex, better yet.

1637
01:23:35,533 --> 01:23:36,599
"Wes?

1638
01:23:36,699 --> 01:23:41,633
No, he's out back, building a Cineplex from wood.

1639
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:43,932
With tools."

1640
01:23:44,032 --> 01:23:45,766
Do you have any tools?

1641
01:23:45,865 --> 01:23:47,132
Seriously?

1642
01:23:47,232 --> 01:23:48,266
- Yes, I have tools.

1643
01:23:48,366 --> 01:23:48,999
- Now, what do you--what?

1644
01:23:49,099 --> 01:23:49,932
- I have--

1645
01:23:50,032 --> 01:23:51,432
- Yeah?

1646
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:55,399
- A snow shovel, and I have a stapler.

1647
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:00,466
- A snow shovel and a stapler.

1648
01:24:00,566 --> 01:24:06,633
Well, you could bury the stapler under the piles of paper on your

1649
01:24:06,733 --> 01:24:11,065
desk, and then come spring, you can dig it out.
