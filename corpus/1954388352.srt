Martin's latest test results.

I'm afraid he's too weak
to perform the surgery.

616
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:03,166
We need to build up his immune
system, his red blood cells,

617

and strengthen his body.

So we want to keep him here
to help him get stronger

620
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:16,144
Then I think we can perform
the surgery May 5th.

very, very carefully and

743
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,442
I made my decision based on
what he's already proven,

744
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:34,809

a shot against him?

Look, I know I have
only a few MMA fights,

751
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,968
And I'd have never
taken this fight,

752
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,939

heart, that I can win it.

say to that, Champ?

put in front of me,

king of this cage.

MMA fighter of all time.

you'll even last one round?

working together, 8 years?

Actually ten.

874
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,158
I was exactly 17

875
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:31,694
when your brother saved
my ass from a beat down.

876
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,864
Oh yeah? What was that about?

877
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:39,934
Well, I bet on this mixed
martial arts fight at a bar...

878
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:44,505
And I won, so I went
to collect my money.

879
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:50,811
And the guy didn't want to pay.
So I started pushing him.

880
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:53,549
And he didn't like that very much.

881
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,619
Next thing I know, I look behind me

882
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,855
and the whole bar's
ready to take me down.

883

If it wasn't for Hector,

884
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,261
I would have had my
ass handed to me.

I mean really.

886
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:12,568
After that we started talking,
went out and drinking

887
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:16,239
and teamed up and we've been
running together ever since.

888
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,306
And you stopped betting, right?

889
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,044

890
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:30,117

a gambling problem.

that's ten years.

Ten years man, we made it!

893
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:37,894
- We made it!
- That's more than 10 years.

894
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:40,363
- It's more like 30.
- 30?

895
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:45,034
Yes, our father started training
us when we were little boys.

896
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:48,604
He was a Mexican kickboxing champ.

897
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:52,241
And he worked with us. Hard.

898
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:57,847
And then, when we were teenagers he
tried to bring us to the US and...

899
01:01:57,848 --> 01:02:00,849
something went down really bad.

900
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,450
We lost both our parents.

901
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,155

we worked in the strawberry
fields picking strawberries.

903
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,530
We met an old man, an old priest.

904
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:17,633
He took us in, took care of us.

905
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:20,501
Eventually, he passed away and...

906
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,774
out of honor for him,

907
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:26,842

for us when we were little.

Our father was a drunk.

913
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:47,930
And anytime he'd lose,

914
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,565
