<i>Like so many epidemic before,</i>

2
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:40,935
<i>began the loss of so many human lives
with a single microscopic organism.</i>

00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:46,765
GLASGOW, 3 APRIL 2008

4
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:53,133
<i>Humanity is naturally on
Looking for a reason</i>

5
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:57,094
<i>to a disaster like this.</i>

6
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,948
<i>But a virus chooses no time or place.</i>

7
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:04,131
<i>There is no hatred,
and does not worry.</i>

8
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:07,530
<i>It just happens.</i>

9
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,335
ENGLAND / THE BORDER WITH SCOTLAND

10
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:35,266
<i>The Reaper virus spread among the
people of Glasgow as a normal colds.</i>

11
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:41,413
<i>You could not stop, there was no
no medicine and no vaccine.</i>

12
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:44,489
<i>It took thousands of lives
in the first week.</i>

13
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:48,025
This is the end of the world!

14
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:51,984
<i>In an attempt to stop the virus
state of emergency was proclaimed.</i>

15
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,828
<i>There were roadblocks set up
and there was a curfew imposed.</i>

16
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:59,172
<i>The airports, ports and borders
were closed.</i>

17
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:02,047
<i>Scotland was placed in quarantine.</i>

18
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,470
<i>The population was
invited to stay at home,</i>

19
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:07,138
<i>not to travel
and to avoid contact.</i>

20
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:12,649
<i>The people had to sit at home
and wait for help that did not.</i>

21
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:42,555
You! You! I talk to you!

22
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,376
Beware.
He is infected!

23
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:48,705
No, please.

24
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:57,355
Klootzak!

25
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,737
Towards the fence!
Come on.

26
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:06,311
Pak them!

27
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:36,294
We are looking for coverage, é ok?

28
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,315
Prepare!

29
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:15,119
Gas!

30
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,326
Let us inside.

31
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,335
Please, take us.
- Ga back!

32
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,995
We must go!
- Ga away from the helicopter!

33
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:13,739
I have a child!

34
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:17,544
No, what are you doing.
Back in the helicopter. Now!

35
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,267
I assume the child!

36
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:21,981
We have now gone!

37
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:24,479
Keep your good finds treasure.
Everything is good.

38
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:27,000
Fast.

39
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,806
Ga back!

40
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:36,304
Take it easy!
These are the data.

41
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,647
Keep your good finds treasure.

42
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:44,760
Eden!

43
00:05:56,276 --> 00:06:00,812
<i>The wall was 20 metres high and
made of reinforced steel plates.</i>

44
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:04,465
<i>He followed the line of the former
Roman frontier of 2000 years ago. </ I></i>

45
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,539
<i>He was 30 kilometers long,
from east to west.</i>

46
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,422
<i>He informed Great Britain in two ë n.</i>

47
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,998
<i>The surrounding waters were full of
mines laid and there was patrolled.</i>

48
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:15,420
<i>The sky was as non-vliegzone.</i>

49
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:20,686
<i>And the orders were to shoot down
any aircraft in violation of the quarantin.</i>

50
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:26,762
<i>The idea was simple, nobody
came out. And nobody went in.</i>

51
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:31,011
<i>Then they did not worry
on the second section.</i>

52
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:39,715
<i>Those who were left behind in the
quarantine zone,</i>

53
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,636
<i>were abandoned to their fate.</i>

54
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:44,903
<i>The social order was in the extinction,
Like the population.</i>

55
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:48,671
<i>The streets were army and the population
moisture to survive.</i>

56
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:51,246
<i>The bodies were thousands
simultaneously burned.</i>

57
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:54,628
<i>Crime, rape and murder
were still dominating.</i>

58
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:55,858
<i>The fire spread from,</i>

59
00:06:55,934 --> 00:07:00,202
<i>while the cities were plundered
and the last survivors were wanted.</i>

60
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:06,278
<i>They ate dogs, rats
and ultimately each other.</i>

61
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:12,965
<i>When the weeks months,
they were all dead.</i>

62
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,077
<i>Over time, everything was uitgebrand.</i>

63
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:20,192
<i>When was the country north of the wall
erased from memory,</i>

64
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:24,443
<i>and ultimately changed the history.</i>

65
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,264
<i>In the same way as the government
Scotland has dropped,</i>

66
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,839
<i>the rest of the world
Great Britain ë drop. </ I></i>

67
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:35,375
<i>With hundreds of thousands of unemployed,
homeless and without a future.</i>

68
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:38,181
<i>The situation has reached its peak.</i>

69
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:44,421
<i>It is now waiting for the natural laws
the balance sheet back into balance.</i>

70
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:52,727
LONDON, 2035.
TODAY.

71
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:23,363
I have my goal in sight.
- Start recording.

72
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,457
What is this on?

73
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:03,263
You, bastard!

74
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:14,604
Extract the suitcase.

75
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,673
Let the weapon.

76
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:34,754
Klootzak!
Where is your partner?

77
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,283
Say!

78
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:39,643
Say, or your life...

79
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:42,519
Ga back!
Not here,

80
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:45,017
or his brains are spread
on the whole boat.

81
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:47,323
Sinclair, whatever you're planning,
do not shoot.

82
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,553
What are you doing a damn?
- Sinclair.

83
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,359
She is crazy.
Make sure they go away!

84
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:54,474
I commend you not to
shoot, Sinclair.

85
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,588
You go out.

86
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:57,933
Together with your partner.

87
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:59,472
Be there but not so sure.

88
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:00,893
I killed him, I swear.

89
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:03,606
Sinclair, where are you doing?

90
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:09,373
Shit!

91
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:48,504
I'll never get used to.

92
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:52,787
You know me for a cigarette.

93
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:54,709
When you buy a cigarette?

94
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:56,938
How much do you think those things cost?

95
00:10:57,014 --> 00:10:59,706
I therefore can better those of you smoking.

96
00:10:59,782 --> 00:11:04,265
Michaelson, was a good man.
Not the best agent out there.

97
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:12,337
A good man.
What is inside?

98
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:17,603
See for yourself.

99
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:21,178
Whatever happened, he is dead.

100
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:31,343
I can no longer recall
how she looks.

101
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,647
Everything I have is a name in an envelope
with an address where I can never go.

102
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:39,799
I've seen you fight for permission
to get from above.

103
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,874
It makes you so angry.

104
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,678
If you this way, you as a finite
individual to the kloten.

105
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:51,637
Want to do something for me, please?

106
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:55,005
Ga go home and take your rest.

107
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:39,519
Where do we go?

108
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,552
Ga.

109
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,627
Ga back!

110
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,179
Thank you, captain.
That's it.

111
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:58,407
Canaris.
- Prime Minister.

112
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,139
How long?
- Two hours.

113
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:06,215
It was a routine drugsinval, when we
find the infected victims were.

114
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:10,516
It is the Reaper virus.
- Oh, my God.

115
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,846
It is back.

116
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:21,972
Hello, George.
What's going on?

117
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,318
I am afraid that it is a
national emergency.

118
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:25,432
A meeting with the Premier
in five minutes.

119
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,815
Let's informal,
and not run around.

120
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,275
We all know what is at stake.

121
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:32,350
Jane.

122
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:36,002
In 2023 when the rising water London
threatened to onderlopen,

123
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:38,040
we have the Thames vloedbarri è re expanded.

124
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:40,539
Like a moat around a castle,
extends this system of canals

125
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,845
spread over the entire capital
north of the river.

126
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:45,228
Our plan is to the canal under a run,

127
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:49,957
and all bridges and railways to close
that the city entry and exit.

128
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:52,147
You want 12 million people individually.

129
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:54,185
Containment is our first priority.

130
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:55,991
Now we have the emergency declaration.

131
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,566
Keep the people of the street, so we
and medical centres set up blockades.

132
00:13:59,642 --> 00:14:02,449
Only then can we start with the evacuation.
- Do it!

133
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:06,755
It's all so easy for people
like sardines in their homes to close.

134
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:09,061
But if you have a deadly
virus in that mix throws,

135
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:12,251
then this city moribund.

136
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,903
As soon as there appear on the streets,
there will be panic created,

137
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:19,055
disorder, there will rapes
and murders.

138
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,517
And that's only the beginning.

139
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,706
The death toll will be unimaginably high.

140
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:27,127
And when the time comes we can
damn nothing more points!

141
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:30,395
You need to think millions
we will survive.

142
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:33,970
Are you talking about
people or British pounds?

143
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:37,314
Hoofdinspecteur Nelson, do you want
meelopen even to my office?

144
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,352
If this is a sermon,
then shoot a bit.

145
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:42,158
I must do my work,
I have on the street.

146
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:45,617
Michael, what we show you is
highly confidential

147
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:47,616
and potentially incriminating material.

148
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:50,807
When the wall they have made wild
the then Government,

149
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,729
what's on the other side to the hand.

150
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:57,534
So they have a satellite Glasgow and
Edinbourgh in the holes leave.

151
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,185
More than 30 years, there are photographs,

152
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:06,260
Opgestuurd, and what do you expect?
Empty towns and streets deserted.

153
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:10,895
Until three years ago these
pictures published.

154
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,099
People.

155
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:20,674
In the streets of Glasgow.
- Survivors?

156
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,788
What else can it be?

157
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:26,056
And if there are survivors then
there is also an antidote.

158
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:27,901
We need to address
see it.

159
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:30,999
We already have a team ready.

160
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:33,091
We have only one leader.

161
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,396
Someone who leads them inwards,
find the antidote,

162
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:39,125
and it brings us before it is too late
for there is what to do.

163
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,816
You do not know how many
survivors there are.

164
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:45,122
Maybe the team will find they are not
on time, maybe they found nothing.

165
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:47,504
They can still infectious.

166
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,620
That is the team out.

167
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:52,887
You knew damn all three years that
that there were survivors,

168
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:54,809
and you have the cover-up stopped.

169
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,422
We could still do nothing.

170
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,497
If I yesterday with a survivor
on the 6 o'clock news would appear,

171
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:03,265
they would me to the nearest
lamppost on my balls hanging.

172
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:07,879
But if I leave within 48 hours with a
survivor and the cure to the news appear,

173
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:09,915
they obviously no ball
to those surviving.

174
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:12,991
But they are in the queue waiting to
my ass a cushion for the antidote.

175
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:16,258
In politics is a matter of survival
of timing, and this is the moment.

176
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:21,664
We have 48 hours. We have you
best man, and now.

177
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:25,699
Ok é.

178
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,004
I know someone who is suitable for it.

179
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:50,186
Step in, it pours outside.

180
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:02,946
How long they knew it all?
- Long enough, but that does not matter now.

181
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,677
For me, yes.

182
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:09,099
For whom do we do it?
- I tell you not on holiday.

183
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,734
Concentrate on the mission.

184
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,465
Who's behind it?
Hatcher?

185
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,771
Hatcher is a part of it,

186
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,271
But it is that Canaris
the reins in his hands.

187
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,386
He is the force behind this mission,

188
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:21,790
and he is not someone where you
quarrel would like to have.

189
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,962
Who, me?
- I believe it.

190
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:26,500
They all want to go with the honor.

191
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:30,751
Hatcher and the government,
the whole damned system.

192
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:34,477
That leaves Canaris never.

193
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,016
Once you on the other side
of that wall are,

194
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:41,037
There are no rules and no help.
- That I have not needed.

195
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:03,524
Do you want this for me?

196
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:14,651
You've certainly not a cigarette?

197
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:18,016
You may not smoke in the helicopter
if I do not smoke.

198
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:20,324
Ok é.

199
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,841
Dr. Mark Kane led the investigation
to the virus when the gates dichtgingen.

200
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,956
He was stuck in the laboratory.

201
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:31,282
His laboratory was in the
quarantine department in Glasgow.

202
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:34,742
If someone could develop an antidote
then he was it.

203
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:39,570
I suggest that you begin at the laboratory,
and from there go looking for.

204
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:43,200
You rendez-vous with the rest of
the team is in the wall.

205
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:46,084
Then you go ga to the north,
you have to transport.

206
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,641
Why do not we fly?
- Scotland is still a non-vliegzone.

207
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:52,814
Hatcher wants this mission remains secret.

208
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,236
So if we do not work out, know
nobody that we are there.

209
00:18:57,312 --> 00:19:00,140
You have 46 hours.

210
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:05,707
If you find nothing, the centre of London
everyone who lives there and die.

211
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,699
If you think that I will find.

212
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:16,489
This you need, it's a GPS Locater
which tells us exactly where you are.

213
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:20,600
It says that a helicopter ready
your team back again.

214
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:23,697
That call them secret.

215
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:28,216
Once you have the antidote
it does not matter anymore.

216
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:32,519
What happens if we find nothing?

217
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:35,712
Then you do not have to come back.

218
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:13,748
What are we doing damn, Canaris?

219
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:15,959
Quietly, and listen.

220
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:19,323
Even though Sinclair by a miracle
where she is looking for,

221
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:23,744
and back in time. The fact remains that the
our debt, we are responsible.

222
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,300
Too many people in a hope so
they can barely move.

223
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:30,954
We have the perfect situation for
a virus created ë erd.

224
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:36,433
The more we save now, how
greater the chance that the weather happens.

225
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:41,142
We have a chance to
to give us some space.

226
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:43,643
What do you mean by that?

227
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:46,141
Start a war, Prime Minister.

228
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:49,602
These are the basic rules of war.

229
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:53,640
Let the dying die.
- While the whole world looking on?

230
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:59,716
With so much protesteerders,
we can just do what we want.

231
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:12,595
THE MUUR - 3 HOURS LATER.

232
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,302
Captain Sinclair,

233
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,224
you have a good flight?
- Ok é.

234
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,724
Sergeant Hook, welcome to
limbo.

235
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,165
Why do you call it?

236
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:28,338
There is no longer living soul
confess behind that wall, except our own.

237
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:29,492
No exceptions?

238
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:32,376
No, the whole system is 20 years ago
fully automated.

239
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:36,724
Today it is only
wild what they get.

240
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:42,278
The team arrived two hours ago.

241
00:21:42,354 --> 00:21:44,007
They are within the equipment.

242
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,179
We must hurry up, sergeant.
The time is working against us.

243
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:49,391
Yes, Sir.

244
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:50,930
Is the team already ge ï nformeerd?

245
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:55,352
I have them contracts, objectives and
the file of Dr. Kane.

246
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:58,811
Captain Sinclair? I'm Chandler
of the Armored Division.

247
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:01,430
Today I am the driver.

248
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:05,155
They see there might not matter but
they go if the fire department.

249
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:08,425
A 12-cylinder engine, a two-inch
armoured plate which is blocking everything

250
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,348
of 30 millimetre artillery chemical weapons.

251
00:22:10,424 --> 00:22:11,982
Since we can do with it.

252
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:13,329
Where have they found?

253
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:15,155
A patrol found them just behind the wall.

254
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:17,643
Since the system is fully automated
has become, they were no longer needed.

255
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,194
These are the last two who still serve.

256
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,500
Major, this is Corporal Read.
Tankbestuurder.

257
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:24,384
Majoor.
- Ga continue with your work, Corporal.

258
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,064
Soldiers Miller and Carpenter.
- Major.

259
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,423
What have we here?

260
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:32,172
BIO-6, gevechtsmodel.
Kogelvrije flexible vests.

261
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:35,153
These give full liberty
and 24-hour protection.

262
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,978
Exactly what a woman needs.

263
00:22:37,054 --> 00:22:40,055
Prototype, silicone rookgranaat.

264
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:43,323
This is frontline equipment.
- A afscheidscadeau of Canaris.

265
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,940
We expect difficulties?

266
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:51,707
Is there a problem?
- No, no problem. Majoor.

267
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,108
Well.

268
00:23:02,142 --> 00:23:04,661
This is our cargo.
Dr. And Dr. Talbot. Stirling.

269
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:07,929
You were part of the delegation
who wanted to destroy the virus.

270
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:10,717
That's right.
Nice to meet you, Major.

271
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:14,466
I took part in 2024,
Stirling came in 2031.

272
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:20,159
Until a few years Hatcher decided to
ago to pull the plug.

273
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:24,388
We've tried everything,
but without result.

274
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:30,422
I hope that this mission from you
the risk is worth, Majoor.

275
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:33,039
Probably someone thinks so.

276
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:39,767
OK, listen. I want everyone in 10 minutes
in full equipment ready.

277
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,644
The wall leaving!

278
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,329
<i>Automatic restraint off.</i>

279
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:43,388
Ok é, Chandler.
To inside.

280
00:25:48,885 --> 00:25:50,253
Shit!
- Sergeant, what was that?

281
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:51,599
<i>What's wrong, Chandler?</i>

282
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,518
I think we hit something?
- Major.

283
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:54,680
<i>Say that again.</i>

284
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:56,983
I think you can look even better.

285
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,387
Soldier Miller, ga's look.

286
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:02,100
Chandler, shooting a flare into the sky.

287
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:21,396
<i>Chandler, which is black and white
and is scattered everywhere?</i>

288
00:26:21,472 --> 00:26:25,337
<i>You probably do not know,
a cow is the right answer.</i>

289
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:28,050
In motion.
- É Ok, come back inside.

290
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:44,847
This farm is already 25 years.

291
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:49,269
The government seeks this information
for the population to hide.

292
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:53,424
They do not want the people know
how bad it is.

293
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:57,246
<i>They think that we are no longer
can continue.</i>

294
00:26:57,322 --> 00:27:00,322
<i>Ethics has abandoned these people.</i>

295
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:02,917
It seems that he has sunk
with a number of stranded soldiers.

296
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:04,937
She continued the run hospital
as well as they could.

297
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:07,629
They remained through the regular
legerfrequentie broadcast reports,

298
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:10,801
by the use of their transmitter,
until the current comparison.

299
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:15,415
<i>The virus has spread,
deliveries are stopped</i>

300
00:27:15,491 --> 00:27:17,913
<i>and affects the water quickly.</i>

301
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:22,624
<i>At night we hear in the distance
the screams of pain in English.</i>

302
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,700
<i>They have begun to eat each other.</i>

303
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:28,585
<i>The evil is beyond arrived.</i>

304
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:30,987
<i>We have almost no ammunition.</i>

305
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:34,640
<i>The barricades will not
much longer.</i>

306
00:27:34,716 --> 00:27:40,716
<i>Our time is running out.
This is Dr. Marcus Kane, who quit.</i>

307
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:49,153
What do the numbers?

308
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:51,558
It is the number of people in a house
to whom he granted assistance.

309
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:56,096
They were told to stay at home,
that assistance would come.

310
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:14,933
WARNING: You IS AN AREA
IN WHICH AN DODELIJK VIRUS HEERST.

311
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:57,602
Safe.

312
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,698
Beware.

313
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:07,469
Ok é, browse the departments.

314
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:42,161
Safe.

315
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:02,994
Read, we are on the fifth floor.
We go inside.

316
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,092
Included.
Here, everything is quiet.

317
00:31:08,164 --> 00:31:11,091
Where is the button on the TV?

318
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:39,440
Talbot and Stirling.
You have to turn.

319
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:42,400
How should we find something damn
in this rubbish.

320
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:43,553
Ga but now searching.

321
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:46,630
It would help if we knew what
we were looking for.

322
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:49,898
A proof of Kane's work.

323
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,820
I know when I see it.

324
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,937
Thank you, that helps a lot.

325
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:56,650
Keep your mouth, Carpenter.

326
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:25,554
Major!

327
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,286
<i>Major! We have a survivor! </ I></i>

328
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,208
Chandler, I do not understand.
Say it again.

329
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:31,421
<i>There is someone there,
outside on the street.</i>

330
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:33,247
I Ga there.
- Do not touch her.

331
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:35,075
Chandler, keep her in the eye.
But ga not to her.

332
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:37,573
<i>I repeat, not ga to her.</i>

333
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:38,920
Chandler, what are you doing?

334
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:41,419
You've heard Sinclair!
Ga back inside.

335
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:42,766
She has help, Read.
I Ga there.

336
00:32:42,842 --> 00:32:43,824
Chandler, no!

337
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,267
Do what I say, ga back to the vehicle.

338
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:51,610
It is OK é.
Everything is good.

339
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:53,245
Chandler, you hear me?

340
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:55,168
She is still alive, Majoor.
But they are still alive but net.

341
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:57,091
They should ge ï soleerd,
so that we can investigate.

342
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,245
Ok é, bring her inside.

343
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:00,264
Majoor, this laboratory
still seems untouched.

344
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,362
Ga but look within,
we are right behind you.

345
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,186
Talbot, duck!

346
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,148
Read, this is an emergency!
Do you get away.

347
00:33:40,224 --> 00:33:42,285
Included.

348
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,741
Do you get away!

349
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,128
Major!
Through the back door.

350
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,044
Shit!

351
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,929
Come back in the vehicle damn!

352
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:05,354
I come out.

353
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:18,906
Shit! Shit! Shit!

354
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:24,768
We're going!

355
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:47,640
Pak!

356
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,328
Jesus Christ!

357
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:55,042
Fuck you, bastards!

358
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:58,214
Shit!

359
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:04,536
Chandler, you are on fire!
- I have no time for it!

360
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:06,075
Majoor, we are attacked.

361
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:09,172
<i>I repeat, we are attacked.</i>

362
00:35:34,598 --> 00:35:36,657
Klootzakken!

363
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,672
Fuck!

364
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:23,845
Vehicle No. 1 was destroyed!

365
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:28,553
Shit!

366
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:31,609
I repeat, 1 vehicle was destroyed.
We have lost Chandler.

367
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:33,628
Christ!
- Ga in the elevator and no questions.

368
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:34,590
Shoot!

369
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:37,082
Do you want us all dead...
- Keep your mouth!

370
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:38,244
Shoot on the move!

371
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,861
Sergeant, our deck.

372
00:36:44,183 --> 00:36:45,837
Miller, garnet.

373
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,337
This is bad news.

374
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:49,875
It is free.
Ga.

375
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:52,663
What will we have?
- We're going down.

376
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:56,338
Now!
- Shoot, Miller!

377
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:22,959
Major, you are not wise!

378
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,840
The corners.
Look in the corners!

379
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,264
Bend over!

380
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,858
Miller, make the damned hatch open!

381
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,449
Shit!

382
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:49,295
Enter!
We must away!

383
00:38:00,305 --> 00:38:02,750
Ride!

384
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:14,645
Are there any injuries?
- We are ok é.

385
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:17,263
Shut up!

386
00:38:20,104 --> 00:38:23,222
Please answer me,
we have injuries!

387
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:29,832
- Read!
Take the wheel over!

388
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,257
Jesus, love you!

389
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:51,959
Stirling, are you still there?
- I'm fine.

390
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:55,781
How is it with Lego?
- She is dead.

391
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:57,321
Fuck, damn!

392
00:38:57,397 --> 00:39:00,706
Ok é grab what you can
and then deal with it.

393
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,778
Miller, Norton deck!
- Fire.

394
00:39:46,602 --> 00:39:48,737
Shoot!
- Keep full, I help you.

395
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:51,834
Norton, the alley.
- Included!

396
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:53,159
Stirling, deck them!

397
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:54,890
He has my support.

398
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:57,582
Here.
- Ga.

399
00:39:57,658 --> 00:40:00,369
Ga behind me!
- Cover, Talbot!

400
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,484
Ga but, Major!

401
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,102
Major, Ga!

402
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:14,424
Come on then damn...

403
00:40:20,436 --> 00:40:22,593
Fuck!

404
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:26,054
I have no more ammunition!

405
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:28,435
Keep your feet on me!

406
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:29,590
Talbot!

407
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:32,762
We need roads.
Go!

408
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:35,187
Shoot!

409
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,070
Wild!

410
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:03,827
This is for Sol.

411
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:45,727
Shit!

412
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:52,448
Excuse me, excuse me.

413
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:54,563
I have a bad memory.

414
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,564
But if you so persists.

415
00:42:01,846 --> 00:42:05,830
You see, I'm already forgotten.

416
00:42:06,075 --> 00:42:09,363
Excuse me, excuse me.

417
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:12,920
But you make me so damn bad!

418
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:15,921
Talk to me.

419
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:18,398
Who are you?

420
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:22,629
What's damn with you?
Keep your pain is that it?

421
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:26,591
Because you are asking damn about.

422
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:51,167
Let's try again.

423
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:54,243
Who are you and where are you from?

424
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,455
I know that you are not sent Kane,
So whom do you have?

425
00:42:56,531 --> 00:43:02,146
Where did you get the equipment come from?
And the tanks and weapons?

426
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:05,222
Talk to me!

427
00:43:06,142 --> 00:43:07,602
Have you seen Kane?

428
00:43:07,678 --> 00:43:11,470
Do you want what I talk louder,
is that it?

429
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:14,641
Once see how this feels.

430
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:19,255
Fuck you!

431
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,193
We came from the other side of the wall.

432
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:33,072
I knew the damn!

433
00:43:33,148 --> 00:43:35,859
I knew that he lied damn!
- Who lied?

434
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:38,285
Can!

435
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:42,395
You know, he let us believe that there
outside it was nothing.

436
00:43:42,471 --> 00:43:44,221
No hope of rescue.

437
00:43:44,297 --> 00:43:50,297
But I knew that one day someone
would come and to prove the opposite.

438
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:55,873
If Kane is still alive then
I must find him.

439
00:43:57,175 --> 00:44:00,656
Save your breath.
You can now relax.

440
00:44:00,732 --> 00:44:04,042
You will remain alive only as long as
we do need.

441
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:10,192
Look, if you come from behind the wall,
then you have a plan to go back.

442
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:13,438
We have previously tried,
and have failed.

443
00:44:13,514 --> 00:44:16,514
I have too many of my friends
the wall to see worship.

444
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:20,455
But before they came near
they were on fire changed,

445
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:23,937
and fell down a shaft.

446
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:26,606
But you will help us to
the other side.

447
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:30,931
We will continue until the end.

448
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:35,951
Oh girl, I can eat you.

449
00:44:43,211 --> 00:44:47,460
If you talk about that bastard've Kane,
that there is.

450
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:53,536
But you are our passport to
the promised land.

451
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:57,647
You will be disappointed.

452
00:44:57,723 --> 00:45:00,264
Since I believe about themselves.

453
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:07,738
Can you hear that?
The dogs are hungry.

454
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:12,662
It is time to implement!

455
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:24,386
We needed this alive, care
that they remain in that state.

456
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:31,690
Nice watch.

457
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:01,552
Sol, I have heard what you said.
I have to talk with you.

458
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:04,533
You will still have to turn.
- Sol!

459
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:08,664
The wind of change blowing
as a hurricane.

460
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,281
Give them the strength.

461
00:46:46,408 --> 00:46:50,657
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is
the big boss,

462
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:56,733
the Voorhamer, it's Sol!

463
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:28,883
Ladies and Gentlemen!

464
00:48:32,011 --> 00:48:36,474
We have a special surprise for you.

465
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:45,317
An intruder damned.

466
00:48:48,252 --> 00:48:51,636
Kane that he thought everyone
could curse.

467
00:48:51,712 --> 00:48:56,153
And we have caught Kane.
Fuck you!

468
00:48:56,229 --> 00:48:59,731
Fuck you!

469
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:07,035
This is our city!

470
00:49:09,106 --> 00:49:11,435
It does not matter who
send them here,

471
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:14,147
we tackle them.

472
00:49:15,259 --> 00:49:17,896
And then we cook them!

473
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:22,221
And then we eat them damn!

474
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:48,645
Come on!

475
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:41,497
No, no, no!

476
00:50:45,968 --> 00:50:48,585
Kill him!

477
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:52,546
Please, no!

478
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:14,841
Whore!

479
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:01,691
If you're hungry why try
you or not a piece of your friend.

480
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,305
Hey!

481
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:11,974
What should I do to something
to drink to get?

482
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:20,527
Put the key in the lock and
Turn to him slowly.

483
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:37,439
That was still no pain, is not it?

484
00:53:56,135 --> 00:53:59,519
Wait, remove me from here and
I can help you.

485
00:53:59,595 --> 00:54:03,076
Can you help me? Why?
What do you offer?

486
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:06,172
I just spoke with Sol

487
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:09,536
He said that from behind the wall
came.

488
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,975
No, let me not behind.
He will murder me.

489
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:14,994
You need something better imagine.

490
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:18,283
I can help you to find Kane.

491
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:26,932
You know where Kane?
- That I should know, he's my father.

492
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:29,986
When I learned that you'll lie

493
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:33,061
would you want me here
would have left behind.

494
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:36,159
Follow me and you do what I say.

495
00:54:38,617 --> 00:54:40,966
Beware!

496
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:27,760
You may now release.

497
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:30,550
In moving!

498
00:55:36,945 --> 00:55:38,310
Can you hear me, Sergeant.

499
00:55:38,386 --> 00:55:40,329
Sinclair? This is Norton, where are you?

500
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:43,116
In movement, we see each other on the
Street station in Queens.

501
00:55:43,192 --> 00:55:46,022
The station in Queens street, ok é.

502
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:49,385
Come on.

503
00:55:57,128 --> 00:56:01,591
Ga its search!

504
00:56:03,183 --> 00:56:05,531
Come on.

505
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:09,153
Joshua, it's ok é.

506
00:56:09,229 --> 00:56:11,939
We can trust her.
- She looks dangerous.

507
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:14,460
That's it.

508
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:18,498
Norton, you hear me?
Please log.

509
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:23,399
It seems secure.

510
00:56:28,929 --> 00:56:31,279
Ga, ga, ga!

511
00:56:33,448 --> 00:56:36,350
Stirling!
Watch out behind you!

512
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:39,641
We get that bastard did.

513
00:56:45,748 --> 00:56:51,076
Sergeant, come on!

514
00:56:52,763 --> 00:56:55,208
This direction.

515
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,841
Pak them.

516
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,965
We need here.
- Norton, if you hear me. Platform 4.

517
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:15,486
Ga whether you have not?

518
00:57:16,022 --> 00:57:18,081
Come on!

519
00:57:20,057 --> 00:57:22,983
Come on, faster!

520
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:33,266
Pak those bastards!

521
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,840
Come on, Stirling!
- Norton.

522
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:47,393
Come on!

523
00:57:56,767 --> 00:57:59,501
Bend over, Stirling.

524
00:58:08,972 --> 00:58:10,625
Come on.

525
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:14,012
Come on.
Pak my hand.

526
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:23,141
Come on, Majoor.
Faster!

527
00:58:24,444 --> 00:58:26,601
Come on!

528
00:58:49,043 --> 00:58:51,564
Where do you get us headed?

529
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,583
Somewhere where it's safe.

530
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:56,657
Sorry, we soot in the food throwing,
but we have no time for games.

531
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,963
You said that you would bring us to Kane,
and I must speak to him immediately.

532
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,752
I said I would help him to find
but I can not bring him.

533
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:03,867
Why not?

534
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:05,501
Because he kills me.

535
00:59:05,577 --> 00:59:08,288
And if he comes out where you come from
he will also come your murder.

536
00:59:08,364 --> 00:59:11,557
Since there Vandoor Sol has gone,
nobody trusts him more. Even me.

537
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:13,192
His people are always in close proximity to
to protect him.

538
00:59:13,268 --> 00:59:16,770
Those who deal with them being tortured
or murdered.

539
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:19,247
You live in a world behind the wall.

540
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:21,457
My whole life, we have been told that
there's nothing behind that wall.

541
00:59:21,533 --> 00:59:23,188
Your presence makes him a liar.

542
00:59:23,264 --> 00:59:27,898
What did you do in the city?
- I wanted to find my brother, Sol.

543
00:59:27,974 --> 00:59:29,723
Is this maniac your brother?

544
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,743
This is a family who absolutely
to the kloten.

545
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:34,242
They are poor.

546
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,437
And we are caught between both.

547
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:30,263
What is this place?

548
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:34,226
A shorter path through the mountain.
- We always take this route.

549
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,173
It looks at an old military facility
or something similar.

550
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,480
Whatever it was, they were quickly gone.

551
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:57,482
They have even the doors are locked.

552
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:24,079
Jesus, what are they hiding?
The Ark of Noah?

553
01:01:24,155 --> 01:01:27,826
I do not know, mate.
These doors are 12 inches thick.

554
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:32,366
Whatever it is, that someone wanted the
would remain secret.

555
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:14,069
There will be someone.

556
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:15,873
Telemon.

557
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:17,508
Run.

558
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:21,064
Wait, who or what is Telemon?
- He is the killer of Kane.

559
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,393
Shoot.

560
01:02:25,465 --> 01:02:26,351
Come on.

561
01:02:26,427 --> 01:02:27,792
You can go, I remain.

562
01:02:27,868 --> 01:02:29,524
Give me your reservewapen and care
that they can not see.

563
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,118
It makes you nothing, right?

564
01:02:32,194 --> 01:02:35,697
I think your plan is not good,
but I am still with you.

565
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:56,934
That is not something you see every day.

566
01:03:07,268 --> 01:03:10,003
Joshua!

567
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:13,367
No, they will murder him.

568
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:17,306
Shoot, faster.

569
01:03:29,563 --> 01:03:31,219
Sergeant, leave your weapon bags.

570
01:03:31,295 --> 01:03:33,814
We need as quickly as possible to allow Kane
and this is the quickest way.

571
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:36,431
Ok é.
Fuck it.

572
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:43,927
I hope you know what you're doing.

573
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,941
I knew that she cities in the eye
would hold.

574
01:05:14,017 --> 01:05:18,554
So we opted for this place,
out of sight and anyone who thinks.

575
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,534
I think it was a matter of time

576
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:24,801
before they would send someone who
To answer this question.

577
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:28,742
Why your life while you still
actually had his death.

578
01:05:28,818 --> 01:05:31,625
That is you know, is not it?

579
01:05:31,701 --> 01:05:34,050
Please answer!

580
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,511
Something like you just said.

581
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:42,700
Leave us alone.

582
01:05:51,226 --> 01:05:57,226
The answer is easy, in the land of
the infected the immune man is key.

583
01:05:57,457 --> 01:06:01,248
Sir, why are you hiding?

584
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,148
Why not let you see yourself?

585
01:06:03,224 --> 01:06:07,473
Do you think we have chosen
to our previous life to have forgotten?

586
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:10,165
No, we have no choice.

587
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:12,878
We were forced.

588
01:06:14,757 --> 01:06:20,736
The walls around us are built to
to continue to exist and that we will do.

589
01:06:20,812 --> 01:06:24,099
What we built up from nothing
is pure blood.

590
01:06:24,175 --> 01:06:27,752
Onaangetast by the outside world.

591
01:06:27,828 --> 01:06:30,252
Until now.

592
01:06:30,328 --> 01:06:33,349
Have you found a drug?

593
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:37,461
Even now you still ask for help, is not it?

594
01:06:37,537 --> 01:06:41,209
If I were you I would mind
but out of your head.

595
01:06:41,285 --> 01:06:42,362
There is always hope.

596
01:06:42,438 --> 01:06:47,360
But there is no medicine,
that has never been.

597
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,570
We have here geheerst.

598
01:06:49,646 --> 01:06:53,128
Not by science but by
a natural selection.

599
01:06:53,204 --> 01:06:56,322
The survival of the strongest.

600
01:06:57,817 --> 01:07:00,239
We have earned here to
to life.

601
01:07:00,315 --> 01:07:03,435
That you can not say.

602
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,527
Take them.

603
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:08,528
If you do not know why we are here?

604
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,582
It is bad enough that you are here.

605
01:07:11,658 --> 01:07:14,946
It is the Reaper virus,
it's back.

606
01:07:15,022 --> 01:07:19,870
If he touches me more than once
I killed him on the spot.

607
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:33,781
How dare they send you here
to ask for my help.

608
01:07:33,857 --> 01:07:37,817
They proved guilty of all this,
so they can pot!

609
01:07:37,893 --> 01:07:42,068
LONDON, IN THE AFFECTED AREA.

610
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:09,455
<i>Place your right hand on the screen.</i>

611
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:15,028
<i>Look now in the top scanner h</i>

612
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:22,525
We get rid of our city.

613
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:25,195
It is better that I ga on the street.

614
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:28,483
The time has come for you
Here away, Prime Minister.

615
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:43,378
<i>sixth floor.</i>

616
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:07,787
How did this man... damn?

617
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:17,854
Isolate him in the office.
Do it now!

618
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,777
Shoot, Sir.
- I do not understand how I...

619
01:09:19,853 --> 01:09:22,373
Keep your distance!
- Canaris!

620
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:24,583
Canaris!
- Ga back!

621
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:26,912
Canaris!

622
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,372
Good shot.

623
01:09:32,637 --> 01:09:35,561
I tried to save him.

624
01:09:44,072 --> 01:09:47,360
You've impurity in our
world.

625
01:09:47,436 --> 01:09:50,436
You must be purified.
Try it.

626
01:09:50,512 --> 01:09:53,918
Do not, please.

627
01:09:56,470 --> 01:10:00,260
Do not, please!

628
01:10:00,795 --> 01:10:06,026
Papa!
Papa!

629
01:10:20,302 --> 01:10:23,131
You, turn around.

630
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:26,784
Keep your hands up.

631
01:10:29,048 --> 01:10:32,624
Sinclair, how they called you before
Major them against you said?

632
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,163
Eden.

633
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:38,702
Eden, I still think that the
a bad plan.

634
01:10:55,378 --> 01:11:01,378
Tell me, how is it now?

635
01:11:01,818 --> 01:11:03,760
What makes you that?

636
01:11:03,836 --> 01:11:05,587
I'm curious.

637
01:11:05,663 --> 01:11:09,624
Same junk, to another place.

638
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:13,757
So I've done well here
by myself to continue.

639
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:15,871
To you not think you back
've toegekeerd?

640
01:11:15,947 --> 01:11:17,314
You were a doctor.

641
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,333
Why have you lost hope?

642
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:22,622
I was also a first idealist.

643
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:27,243
But in the night when the gates...

644
01:11:29,181 --> 01:11:33,168
That night, I have lost everything.

645
01:11:33,203 --> 01:11:36,269
My wife and my family.

646
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:38,842
You know that pain.

647
01:11:38,918 --> 01:11:41,940
You have the choice to you to hide.

648
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:44,802
Your wife and family abroad
still around.

649
01:11:44,878 --> 01:11:47,300
Have you ever thought to their pain?

650
01:11:47,376 --> 01:11:52,394
I already have 25 years no more night
that I have not slept in thought.

651
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,125
Who do you think that you're through
with me to talk about pain?

652
01:11:54,201 --> 01:11:56,743
What will you do?

653
01:11:57,374 --> 01:12:00,299
What have you ever lost?

654
01:14:12,475 --> 01:14:16,553
Papa, you would like to see.
- Stay on her.

655
01:14:20,931 --> 01:14:23,930
No games to play,
I am not in the mood.

656
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:26,260
Extract the keys.

657
01:14:32,751 --> 01:14:35,101
Let them go.

658
01:14:57,735 --> 01:15:01,334
Where did you well, bastard?

659
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:05,732
Grenades. Beautiful.

660
01:15:05,808 --> 01:15:09,406
They come in useful.
- Shoot, Dr.

661
01:16:03,942 --> 01:16:06,558
I think there is never anyone
lost.

662
01:16:06,634 --> 01:16:09,176
I'm crazy.

663
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:33,102
Murdered prisoners!
Now.

664
01:16:36,904 --> 01:16:40,791
Beman the defensive arms!
We are attacked.

665
01:16:44,304 --> 01:16:47,037
Well done, is not it?

666
01:16:49,398 --> 01:16:52,130
Hierlangs?
- Beware!

667
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:56,552
Klootzakken!

668
01:17:02,275 --> 01:17:04,602
You!
Kill her.

669
01:17:04,678 --> 01:17:06,932
Shit.

670
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,630
Cally!
Take special care yourself.

671
01:17:38,598 --> 01:17:41,236
They steal our horses!

672
01:17:54,935 --> 01:17:57,572
Shoot!

673
01:18:01,758 --> 01:18:04,470
Come on.
Extract the torches.

674
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:07,374
Sergeant, do the door locked.
- Ok é.

675
01:18:16,846 --> 01:18:20,348
Sergeant, see if you can find an aggregate.

676
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,285
We need something that fast.

677
01:18:40,869 --> 01:18:43,411
Find it.

678
01:18:49,903 --> 01:18:52,637
Let us try container.

679
01:18:56,822 --> 01:19:00,708
What do you're watching?
- Break that damned door open.

680
01:19:08,065 --> 01:19:11,065
Beautiful color.
I take him.

681
01:19:11,141 --> 01:19:12,412
I will ensure that I doors
get open.

682
01:19:12,488 --> 01:19:14,623
Stirling and Cally, throw him vol.

683
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:16,929
Wherever you go ga?
- A phone search.

684
01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:18,181
This direction.

685
01:19:18,257 --> 01:19:21,277
Shoot, donders lazy!

686
01:19:48,524 --> 01:19:50,874
Grab them!

687
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,369
Perfekt.

688
01:20:05,823 --> 01:20:08,748
Ga rear seat.
- What does this thing?

689
01:20:08,993 --> 01:20:11,534
That mark you as well.

690
01:21:30,861 --> 01:21:33,306
GLASGOW, 56 KM

691
01:22:00,266 --> 01:22:03,864
Nelson.
- We are talking, we are on the go.

692
01:22:04,782 --> 01:22:07,900
I would hurry up but if I were you.

693
01:22:09,107 --> 01:22:12,515
Canaris has the lead.
Hatcher is dead.

694
01:22:14,105 --> 01:22:16,166
Give him.

695
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:19,242
It is for you

696
01:22:22,851 --> 01:22:24,313
Yes.

697
01:22:24,389 --> 01:22:27,797
Follow this signal if you
still want your price.

698
01:22:31,789 --> 01:22:34,790
Pull the source and send after the
coordinaten directly to me.

699
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:38,655
Ok é.
Let's go.

700
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:44,711
We need your help no longer necessary,
from here we are talking about.

701
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,983

Gas!

703
01:23:15,034 --> 01:23:17,192
Shut up.

01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:29,011

01:23:55,777 --> 01:23:59,568
Shit.

706
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:26,185
That scheelde nothing.
- Do you?

707
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,016
Shut up, we are entering a piece of driving.

708
01:24:47,092 --> 01:24:49,537
Are you completely mad?

709
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:05,296
You are our shit

710
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:26,339
Fuck! Fuck!

711
01:25:32,736 --> 01:25:34,389
Here come them.

712
01:25:34,465 --> 01:25:37,393
You go out!

713
01:26:38,173 --> 01:26:41,675
Stop, please.
You are killing us so.

714
01:26:47,783 --> 01:26:50,131
You, bastard!

715
01:28:02,828 --> 01:28:05,059
Keep your pain?
- Yes.

716
01:28:05,135 --> 01:28:07,581
You could get!

717
01:28:39,056 --> 01:28:41,789
Plankgas!

718
01:28:56,448 --> 01:29:00,624
Cally! Cally!

719
01:29:04,905 --> 01:29:07,253
Jesus!

720
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:56,932
Shit!

721
01:30:56,657 --> 01:31:02,273
Major Sinclair, I was already
worried.

722
01:31:02,615 --> 01:31:04,676
Got it?

723
01:31:05,307 --> 01:31:07,368
I got it.

724
01:31:07,903 --> 01:31:09,268
Where is the medical team?

725
01:31:09,344 --> 01:31:13,209
Let us not so difficult to do
you have performed well.

726
01:31:13,285 --> 01:31:14,652
We take the vanf here.

727
01:31:14,728 --> 01:31:17,268
Stirling, bring her here.

728
01:31:24,722 --> 01:31:27,626
You must forgive but Stirling,
he is very involved in his work.

729
01:31:27,702 --> 01:31:29,932
É Ok, let's go.

730
01:31:30,008 --> 01:31:31,663
We have a lot to be
sacrifice.

731
01:31:31,739 --> 01:31:37,044
Hoelanger we wait, the better the
for us as the dust is left.

732
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,217
If the virus once the dead meat
weggevreten,

733
01:31:40,293 --> 01:31:43,580
then we take action.
It's just a matter of timing.

734
01:31:43,656 --> 01:31:45,408
Then you are the hero of the day.

735
01:31:45,484 --> 01:31:47,811
You said that you had the medicine.
Where is it?

736
01:31:47,887 --> 01:31:50,695
It is the medication.
The survivors are immune.

737
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:54,561
We can use her blood
to a vaccine.

738
01:31:54,711 --> 01:31:56,942
Give her to us.
- They will go nowhere without me.

739
01:31:57,018 --> 01:31:59,943
Captain.
- Ga behind me.

740
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:02,998
Give her now up to us.

741
01:32:03,074 --> 01:32:05,614
Ga but with them.

742
01:32:05,765 --> 01:32:08,018
I trust him not.

743
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,245
We have no choice.
- So which is it?

744
01:32:10,321 --> 01:32:13,536
I have nothing left to join
to negotiate.

745
01:32:13,685 --> 01:32:15,746
My work is over.

746
01:32:17,434 --> 01:32:20,647
Now it's your turn.
- Was it just for you

747
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:23,051
a job?

748
01:32:25,508 --> 01:32:27,759
That's right.

749
01:32:28,775 --> 01:32:31,124
Take her and ga.

750
01:32:42,901 --> 01:32:46,499
Heavy mission?
- Heavy enough.

751
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,360
You've probably no cigarette
for me?

752
01:32:49,436 --> 01:32:54,284
Ga with me, I already rule the
cigarettes that you want.

753
01:32:56,643 --> 01:33:01,395
Regrettably, I had someone like you
could do.

754
01:34:06,406 --> 01:34:08,851
She is so beautiful.

755
01:34:18,994 --> 01:34:21,343
Is it?

756
01:34:26,585 --> 01:34:29,319
I have never felt so good.

757
01:34:29,662 --> 01:34:31,796
How have you found me?

758
01:34:31,872 --> 01:34:34,895
I was formerly policeman.

759
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:43,063
That I no longer needed.
- Ok é.

760
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:48,925
Has Canaris achieved what he wanted?
- Yes, that he has.

761
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:53,803
I have the feeling that he wants to wait.

762
01:34:53,879 --> 01:34:55,941
Shit!

763
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:59,475
Do not worry.

764
01:34:59,551 --> 01:35:02,478
He gave me something in return.

765
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:07,463
All the proof you need to
Canaris to arrest.

766
01:35:07,713 --> 01:35:09,087
He will arrive behind you.

767
01:35:09,163 --> 01:35:11,705
He does not know where I am.

768
01:35:33,762 --> 01:35:37,745
Do me a favor, go gently.

769
01:35:37,991 --> 01:35:40,532
Good luck.

770
01:35:57,497 --> 01:36:01,363
<i>Hoelanger we wait, the better the
for us as the dust is left.</i>

771
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:05,400
<i>If the virus once the dead meat
weggevreten,</i>

772
01:36:05,476 --> 01:36:10,034
<i>then we take action.
- Then you are the hero of the day. </ I></i>

773
01:36:51,109 --> 01:36:56,638
If you are hungry, why try
you or not a piece of your friend!
