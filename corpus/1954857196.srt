1
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,253
<i>He loves me.</i>

2
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:36,754
<i>He loves me not.</i>

3
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,421
<i>He loves me.</i>

4
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:41,954
<i>He loves me not.</i>

5
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:44,289
<i>He loves me.</i>

6
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,990
<i>He loves me not.</i>

7
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:49,157
<i>He loves me.</i>

8
00:00:49,158 --> 00:00:51,223
<i>He loves me not.</i>

9
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:54,458
<i>He loves me.</i>

10
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:57,326
<i>Once there were
three little girls.</i>

11
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:59,999
<i>Anushya, marushya and varushya.</i>

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,060
<i>Anushya, marushya and varushya.</i>

13
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,393
<i>Three sisters.</i>

14
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:05,161
<i>They had dark golden hair</i>

15
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:07,429
<i>and golden eyes.</i>

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,429
<i>Three little flowers.</i>

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,430
<i>They were all very beautiful.</i>

18
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:16,798
<i>But marushya and varushya</i>

19
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,865
<i>were the most beautiful of all.</i>

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,100
<i>"Where are we going, mama?"</i>

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,067
<i>She didn't answer me.</i>

22
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:29,999
<i>She knew or she didn't know,</i>

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,069
<i>she knew or she didn't know,</i>

24
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,502
<i>but she kept silent.</i>

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,069
<i>"Hurry.</i>

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,470
<i>Your comb, your toothbrush,</i>

27
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:40,204
<i>your cup and your spoon,</i>

28
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:43,006
<i>put them in the little bundle."</i>

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,405
<i>"Is that all I have left, mama?</i>

30
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,774
Where are we going, mama?"

31
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:55,009
Destination unknown.

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,999
"Step up high.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,743
"Step up high.

34
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:03,776
It's a big step onto the train."

35
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:07,211
"Is this a train, mama?

36
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,345
<i>It doesn't look like a train."</i>

37
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:12,212
<i>"Hold my hand tight."</i>

38
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:15,780
<i>"I'm holding it, mama,
as tight as I can.</i>

39
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:18,414
<i>There are too many people.
I can't breathe in here."</i>

40
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:23,315
"Breathe, smell, live, dora.

41
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:26,784
Nothing else matters."

42
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,999
<i>Unknown.</i>

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,019
<i>Unknown.</i>

44
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,719
<i>We didn't know
where we were going.</i>

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,152
<i>We didn't know
what was happening.</i>

46
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:43,755
<i>And when we got there,
we still didn't know.</i>

47
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:49,789
And then they stood us in line

48
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,925
and put the numbers on our arms.

49
00:02:59,059 --> 00:02:59,999
"What's that smell, mama?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,792
"What's that smell, mama?

51
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:04,326
That horrible smell?

52
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:06,727
That smoke,

53
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:11,696
<i>that thick black smoke?"</i>

54
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,330
<i>She didn't answer.</i>

55
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,330
<i>"Mama.</i>

56
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:23,698
Is that really you?"

57
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,632
<i>"Dora, is that really you?"</i>

58
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:29,999
<i>My own mother,</i>

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,234
<i>My own mother,</i>

60
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:34,369
<i>and I--
I didn't even know her.</i>

61
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:38,769
<i>She was naked,</i>

62
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,236
<i>her head shaved.</i>

63
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:45,671
Her beautiful hair
she used to comb

64
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,306
every night, gone.

65
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:51,973
<i>"Mama...</i>

66
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:55,374
<i>Why did you have me?</i>

67
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:59,275
<i>Why did you have me, mama?</i>

68
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:03,309
It's all your fault.

69
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,877
If you hadn't had me...

70
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:10,178
I wouldn't be here."

71
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,345
But then, always,

72
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:17,879
I was sorry.

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,813
<i>Sing that song, mama.</i>

74
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:25,115
<i>The one about two Grey kittens.</i>

75
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:28,816
<i>Or the one about the prince
and the princess.</i>

76
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:30,000
<i>Sing it to me</i>

77
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,316
<i>sing it to me</i>

78
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:33,618
<i>so I can fall asleep.</i>

79
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:39,852
She sang for everything

80
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:42,353
that had existed before...

81
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:48,622
Which we knew would
never exist again.

82
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:52,222
And yet, amazingly,

83
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:55,289
we still hoped.

84
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,790
<i>Although we knew</i>

85
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,999
<i>there was no hope possible.</i>

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,191
<i>There was no hope possible.</i>

87
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,229
How old were you when you went
into the concentration camp?

88
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,796
Just your age.

89
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:22,964
- What did you weigh at the end of the war?
- 50 pounds.

90
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,663
Shit.

91
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:26,197
Were you tortured?

92
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:28,232
- Did you know Anne frank?
- Did you get to meet Hitler?

93
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,999
- Did he ever come to the camp?
- Did you get his autograph?

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,599
- Did he ever come to the camp?
- Did you get his autograph?

95
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,799
Weren't you sorry you
weren't a Christian?

96
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,767
If you survived,
then what was so horrible?

97
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,234
Do you still have nightmares?

98
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,702
Was there anyone left
in your family besides you?

99
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,637
- Do you have that number on your arm?
- <i>Yes, I do.</i>

100
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,770
Can we see it?

101
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,772
Of course you can.

102
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,838
Have you ever thought
about having it removed?

103
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,206
What do you think?
Should I remove it?

104
00:05:59,207 --> 00:05:59,999
- No, don't ever take it off.
- No.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
- No, don't ever take it off.
- No.

106
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,074
Now, I want
to ask you a question.

107
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:06,875
<i>Have any one of you ever</i>

108
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:10,277
seen anyone with a number
on their arm?

109
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,944
Why didn't you raise your hand?

110
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:19,145
What stopped you? God, Daisy.

111
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,879
You don't understand. I was the
only one in the whole class who--

112
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,546
I know you were.
That's just why.

113
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,213
Everyone was staring at me.

114
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:28,547
- I could feel their eyes.
Everyone was-- - so what?

115
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:29,999
You can't keep thinking
about everyone all the time.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,982
You can't keep thinking
about everyone all the time.

117
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:32,815
Who cares what they think?

118
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:35,616
You do. I know.

119
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:37,850
I wish you didn't care
so much, Daisy.

120
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,650
I can't help it.

121
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,518
You're not the only one
who's different, you know.

122
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,785
I know. I know, Jess.

123
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:47,586
I wish I was like you.
You're so strong.

124
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,653
I have to be. I'm the only girl.

125
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:51,621
You've got those five brothers.

126
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:53,888
I wish I had just one.
Instead, I only have them.

127
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,488
And where are those parents
of yours off to this weekend?

128
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:59,790
I don't know.
Some romantic hideaway.

129
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,000
They drop me off
and reappear the next day.

130
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:02,690
They drop me off
and reappear the next day.

131
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:11,526
Hey, guess what? I know one
person that was looking at you.

132
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:13,793
- Who?
- You know.

133
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:17,594
He wasn't! He was, really?
Jess, are you sure?

134
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:18,795
Positive. I saw him.

135
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,061
I don't believe it.
He couldn't have been.

136
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:22,796
Jessica, you're wrong.
I mean, god,

137
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:25,631
he doesn't even know I exist.

138
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,991
Ah. You came early.

139
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:14,559
We left at 7:00.

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,725
They didn't even stop.

141
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:18,860
They said they were in a hurry and
they'd stop on their way back.

142
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,928
Well, anyway, now you're here

143
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,894
<i>and we have the whole
weekend together.</i>

144
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:25,962
They're coming in the morning.
I have a test.

145
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,662
Oh.

146
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:29,663
We have the whole day together.

147
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:30,000
I have to study.

148
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,964
I have to study.

149
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:34,697
I know you.

150
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:36,598
You didn't have breakfast.

151
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,765
What shall I make? Pancakes?

152
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:40,599
- I'm not hungry.
- When will you be?

153
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,766
I don't know. Maybe never.

154
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,800
- Look at you. You're too thin.
- don't say that.

155
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:48,801
- Once there was a little
girl-- - stop forcing me.

156
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:50,901
- Stop forcing me.
- Who's forcing?

157
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:52,635
Come on.

158
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:54,937
Give me that.

159
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:59,671
You know, I was thinking I'd
leave before they got here.

160
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:00,000
Uh-huh.

161
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,604
Uh-huh.

162
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,705
And go where?

163
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:05,972
You don't know what it's like.

164
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,773
You were lucky.
You weren't an only one.

165
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,807
- The only what?
- Child.

166
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:14,675
My friends all have millions
of brothers and sisters.

167
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:17,542
<i>Well, at least one anyway.</i>

168
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:20,909
I still get down on my knees, but
they'll never change their mind.

169
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,910
Why should they?
They have each other.

170
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:26,812
They certainly have.

171
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:29,999
How about a little
game of cards, huh?

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,848
How about a little
game of cards, huh?

173
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:38,982
Move.

174
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,782
Oh, you know something?

175
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,950
The first crocus is out.

176
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:48,817
A blue one.
Before anyone else's.

177
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:51,084
I don't want to go outside.

178
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,818
Why? What's the
matter with outside?

179
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,419
Just a little walk.

180
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,720
I don't want
to go for a little walk.

181
00:10:58,721 --> 00:10:59,999
- I want to stay here.
- <i>Why?</i>

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,421
- I want to stay here.
- <i>Why?</i>

183
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:02,055
I thought you wanted to leave.

184
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:06,522
I'm tired, Nana. Totally tired.

185
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:08,289
Totally, hmm.

186
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,556
And what makes you so tired?

187
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:13,357
- School.
- Ah, school.

188
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:15,557
What's at school
to make you so tired?

189
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:17,692
- Everything.
- Everything?

190
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,825
Homework?

191
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,426
Teachers?

192
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:23,360
Friends?

193
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:24,828
Boyfriends?

194
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:29,999
Hey, girls. How's it going?

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,562
Hey, girls. How's it going?

196
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:32,963
- Hey.
- Studying hard?

197
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:34,829
- Yeah.
- Math?

198
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,064
German.

199
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:41,431
Man, that teacher,
she's something else, huh?

200
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:43,265
Yeah, well, we all know
about you and kleiss.

201
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,900
It's not just me there, janebo.

202
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,968
What's wrong with your friend?

203
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:51,868
Can't she speak?

204
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:53,534
<i>Or can she just read?</i>

205
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:55,268
Daisy can talk, Tony.

206
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,402
Yeah? Well, you know
something, flower girl?

207
00:11:58,403 --> 00:11:59,999
- <i>Hey, knock it off, man.</i>
- I think your friend is lying.

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,270
- <i>Hey, knock it off, man.</i>
- I think your friend is lying.

209
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,404
<i>I don't think you
can say a single word.</i>

210
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:06,872
Hey, she can talk.

211
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,305
I'm sure of it.

212
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:10,839
She just needs the right
person to talk to.

213
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,473
Christ. Let's get going.

214
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,908
Come on, let's get out of here.

215
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:20,575
And then she will,

216
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:22,510
<i>when she wants to.</i>

217
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,245
When she really wants to.

218
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:34,279
So, tell me.

219
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,279
What?

220
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,313
Something must be going on.

221
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:39,581
Nothing.

222
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:43,883
Someone told me
I have a beautiful smile.

223
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,649
Someone? Who's this someone?

224
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,917
You think that's true, Nana?

225
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:54,819
I don't know. Show me.

226
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:59,352
Oh, that's a smile?

227
00:12:59,353 --> 00:12:59,999
We have a German test on Monday.

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,819
We have a German test on Monday.

229
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,354
Mm. That's the famous smile?

230
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:06,821
Oh, god, I'm gonna throw up.

231
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:09,855
Oh, not before I see
that famous smile.

232
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,855
- I'm gonna fail. I know it.
- Again?

233
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:14,289
Well, I didn't fail
last time. I fainted.

234
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,990
You fainted? You were
so sure you would fail;

235
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:18,958
Instead, you just fainted.

236
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:23,959
Oh.

237
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:42,564
What's this fainting?

238
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:45,298
You never do think
you're going to pass a test.

239
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,465
You, who always gets as.

240
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:49,665
Not once.

241
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,467
Now where are you going?

242
00:13:58,802 --> 00:13:59,999
<i>Ben? Where are you?</i>

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,169
<i>Ben? Where are you?</i>

244
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,370
How are you, my dear?

245
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:06,938
- Good. How are you?
- Fine.

246
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:22,257
So, mayn daisele.

247
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:26,425
Always with that head in a book.

248
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,692
You must be very smart.

249
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:29,999
No one I know likes to read.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,593
No one I know likes to read.

251
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,327
They all--

252
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:37,395
Everyone thinks it's weird.
They think--

253
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,462
<i>I had a friend
who read like you do.</i>

254
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,864
There were no books in her
house, so I gave her mine.

255
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,799
We spent hours in my
grandfather's yellow bookstore.

256
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,166
She was my first friend.

257
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,466
<i>When we went to dances together,</i>

258
00:15:59,467 --> 00:15:59,999
the boys used
to get us confused.

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,569
The boys used
to get us confused.

260
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:05,535
She had long,
blonde hair like mine.

261
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:08,369
<i>They thought we were sisters.</i>

262
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,704
<i>I loved that.</i>

263
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,672
<i>Only I was Jewish.</i>

264
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:20,273
Her parents didn't like me
from the very beginning.

265
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:26,608
Once she wrote me a poem

266
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:29,176
about the yellow bookstore.

267
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,611
"Yellow roof. Yellow windows.

268
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,645
Yellow chimney to the sky.

269
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,579
<i>We are standing,
forever reading,</i>

270
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,313
<i>between the yellow bookshelves.</i>

271
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:50,380
<i>You on one side. I on the other.</i>

272
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:54,582
<i>You on the right.
I on the left."</i>

273
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,417
When they burned it down...

274
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,999
When they took
my grandfather away...

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,551
When they took
my grandfather away...

276
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:05,485
<i>When there were no more books...</i>

277
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:10,586
I was glad she had mine.

278
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:14,187
<i>One day I saw her</i>

279
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:17,188
<i>walking down a crowded street.</i>

280
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:20,656
<i>So many people.</i>

281
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:25,623
<i>But that day, to me,</i>

282
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:28,325
<i>it was though
there was only her.</i>

283
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:32,692
<i>She was coming right toward me.</i>

284
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:35,793
<i>So I started walking faster.</i>

285
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:38,294
<i>I hadn't seen her in months.</i>

286
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:43,761
<i>Then I saw her eyes.</i>

287
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,329
<i>Blue.</i>

288
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,296
Blue like the flowers
in the field

289
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:53,131
around my grandfather's house.

290
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
And then, Nana?

291
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:03,733
- And then?
- We have to leave.

292
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,734
Mr. gilman's going to town.

293
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:07,535
You always stop in the middle.

294
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:10,702
- I have to pay.
- Mr. gilman never lets you pay.

295
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:14,636
I will this time.
This time I got a surprise.

296
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:18,305
I don't care. What surprise?

297
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:22,639
- "Anna Karenina"!
- Yes.

298
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,473
Oh, Nana!
At last, I have it, too!

299
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,999
Mm. Oh.

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,609
Mm. Oh.

301
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:38,409
I hear. I hear you.
I hear you, mom.

302
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,711
I'm not! I'm not, mom.

303
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:45,511
I'm not using a tone.
Oh, please don't put him on.

304
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:47,345
<i>Mom, do you have to--</i>

305
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:50,412
Hi.

306
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,615
Of course I heard her.
I just talked to her.

307
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:56,214
I'm not using a tone!

308
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:58,183
Why do you two always say
the exact same thing?

309
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:03,049
Books?

310
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,183
Not many, just a few.

311
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:07,417
<i>About 20.</i>

312
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:10,019
<i>Oh, please, don't put her on.</i>

313
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:14,052
Hi.

314
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,720
What?

315
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:19,721
But I still read them, mom.
I read them all the time.

316
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:23,022
I'm not too old for fairy tales.

317
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,922
Nana says we should never
throw our books away.

318
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:28,423
Books are stories.
Books are life.

319
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,191
<i>All her books
were thrown away, mom.</i>

320
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:35,492
<i>I want to keep mine.</i>

321
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,160
You are? Why?

322
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:44,594
What am I gonna--
Okay. Okay.

323
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:47,296
I'll do it. Okay. Bye.

324
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,062
- God!
- Well?

325
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:53,396
They always do that.
They're coming back tonight.

326
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,697
They--
I don't know.

327
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,032
- So?
- <i>Mmm.</i>

328
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,666
How is it?

329
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:07,166
- <i>Good?</i>
- It's very good.

330
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:08,967
It's great.

331
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:10,502
You want another little piece?

332
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:16,369
And they say you don't eat.
They worry.

333
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,037
I still give my food to the dog.

334
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:39,975
"All happy families
resemble one another,

335
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:44,444
but each unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way."

336
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:50,244
Oh, you know it by heart!

337
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:52,412
This is the way it
always should be.

338
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:55,380
No school. No homework.
No being nice to everybody.

339
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:58,080
Just read and read forever.

340
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,999
The way it was before you left.

341
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,547
The way it was before you left.

342
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,415
Mm, daisisch.

343
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,982
Why did you, Nana?
Why did you leave?

344
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:08,116
Your parents and I--
Your mother--

345
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,217
- did you do something wrong?
- No.

346
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:12,584
But there were things
I couldn't tell, and now--

347
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:15,152
Now, Nana?

348
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,953
Your friend,
the one who read so much?

349
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:22,587
What happened to her?

350
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:25,987
What happened that day?

351
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:29,223
<i>- She stopped.
- She just stood there.</i>

352
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,323
<i>I thought she's waiting for me.</i>

353
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:38,057
<i>She came all the way
over here, through everything,</i>

354
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,191
<i>and she's waiting for me.</i>

355
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,592
<i>I kept on walking.</i>

356
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,459
<i>Close... closer.</i>

357
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,460
<i>Another step
and I could have touched her.</i>

358
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:51,961
<i>When she turned
and crossed the street,</i>

359
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:56,129
<i>she walked slowly, deliberately.</i>

360
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,999
<i>And I watched her go.
I watched her.</i>

361
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,464
<i>And I watched her go.
I watched her.</i>

362
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:04,364
<i>Maybe she saw them
close off the wall.</i>

363
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,999
<i>And maybe she came all the
way to the ghetto to see me,</i>

364
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,832
<i>to tell me
where they were taking us,</i>

365
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,533
<i>where we were going.</i>

366
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:17,235
<i>Maybe they told her lies,
and maybe she believed them.</i>

367
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,036
<i>Maybe she was afraid.</i>

368
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:22,202
<i>Who knows, Daisy?</i>

369
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:25,470
Close your eyes. Close them.

370
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,438
Don't move.

371
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:38,823
Nana, open your eyes!

372
00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:40,956
Turn around!

373
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:43,024
Nana.

374
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:46,958
Look, I found it. I knew
just where to look.

375
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:50,194
Look, Nana. It's pretty. Look.

376
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:54,095
Oh.

377
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:58,896
Mmm.

378
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:04,898
Oh. Who picks the crocus? Hmm?

379
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,433
Ethan, even his name
is gorgeous.

380
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:16,200
God, he's so cute.

381
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:19,200
He must be the cutest
boy in the whole school.

382
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:21,901
Everyone practically faints
when he walks into assembly.

383
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:24,035
When I'm near him,

384
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:27,336
in class, in the lunchroom,

385
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,370
at lacrosse, even on the street

386
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:29,999
outside his house
when he's not there,

387
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,204
outside his house
when he's not there,

388
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:34,005
something swallows me up

389
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,338
or grabs me,

390
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:39,139
my throat, my chest,
my whole insides,

391
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,074
so that I can't think
or hear or breathe.

392
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:45,140
<i>And I don't want to.
Let the whole world disappear</i>

393
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:49,910
so I can think about him,
be with him in my mind.

394
00:24:51,277 --> 00:24:53,811
It's like I'm blinded
to everything else.

395
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:04,795
I had to watch. I had to.

396
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,296
I saw him lean over her,

397
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,664
his hair on her cheek,

398
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:11,997
his hand on her knee.

399
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:15,065
And then I saw him
kiss her on the mouth.

400
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,900
I thought my heart
would split open.

401
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:21,101
Who is this boy?

402
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:25,668
He's got this blond hair
and these...

403
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,968
Incredible eyes.

404
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:29,999
Like the ocean, Nana.
They're blue one minute

405
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,203
like the ocean, Nana.
They're blue one minute

406
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:32,937
and green the next.
They're incredible.

407
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:34,703
Incredible eyes.

408
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:37,337
He's president
of the senior class.

409
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:41,072
His father's an architect, so he's
traveled around all over Europe.

410
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:44,172
He grew up in england.

411
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:47,340
And he has this
totally dreamy accent.

412
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:49,974
And Nana, he's so smart.

413
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,641
He gets a-pluses in everything.

414
00:26:52,642 --> 00:26:55,342
He's captain
of the lacrosse team.

415
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:57,076
He's...

416
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,877
Nana, are you listening to me?

417
00:26:58,878 --> 00:26:59,999
Of course I'm listening.

418
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,177
Of course I'm listening.

419
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:02,878
The what team?

420
00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:05,845
Lacrosse. It's a game.

421
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:08,247
I was saying he's--

422
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:12,680
- He's what?
- Perfect.

423
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:14,214
There's not one thing
wrong with him.

424
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,014
It's like he just... shines.

425
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:19,349
"So clare bear had
to glare and swear,

426
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,349
'give me a square of your pear.

427
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,016
If we're to live in this lair
here beneath the stair,

428
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,118
we must learn to share,
especially pear.

429
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,151
But if you dare tear
your pear and not share;

430
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,999
Just wear that smile
with pompous style,

431
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,952
just wear that smile
with pompous style,

432
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:34,054
I'll bite your head off.'"

433
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,721
- Whoo!
<i>- Excellent, Ethan.</i>

434
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:43,322
Great job. Who would've thought a
bear had so many sides to him?

435
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:45,356
<i>It was about this bear.</i>

436
00:27:45,357 --> 00:27:48,656
This bear that ate pears.
It was really funny.

437
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:50,191
It was hysterical.
Everyone laughed.

438
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,591
No one laughed when I read mine.

439
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:56,593
Let's hear from Daisy. What poem
have you written for us today?

440
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:07,195
"The first time
that I went there,

441
00:28:07,196 --> 00:28:09,995
there was silence all around

442
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:11,829
and your street was almost empty

443
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,997
and the sun beat on the ground.

444
00:28:13,998 --> 00:28:16,297
And since then I keep on going.

445
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:18,331
Something pulls me, so I go,

446
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,998
though I don't
want you to see me.

447
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,099
I don't want you to know.

448
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,666
<i>For I know you'll never love me.</i>

449
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:27,067
<i>I know you'll never care.</i>

450
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:29,234
But still I can't help going,

451
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:29,999
for the only place
I want to be is there.

452
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,968
For the only place
I want to be is there.

453
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:34,536
Yes, there. Oh, there."

454
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:47,773
It was awful standing there,
like I was naked.

455
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:51,273
And the poem was naked too, every
word, like it was branding me.

456
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:54,541
<i>After class,
no one talked to me.</i>

457
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,142
They didn't even look at me.

458
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:58,075
God, I wanted to die
for having read that poem.

459
00:28:58,076 --> 00:28:59,999
I want to read it. Where is it?

460
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,809
I want to read it. Where is it?

461
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,076
I threw it out.

462
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:04,811
- <i>What?</i>
- I thought he hated me.

463
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,078
Why shouldn't he like you?

464
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,712
Nana, he's so normal.

465
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:13,579
Normal?

466
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,213
Why should you be normal?

467
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,946
<i>It's not
the most important thing.</i>

468
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:18,247
Oh, yes, it is. I know it is.

469
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:20,248
You know it is. Absolutely.

470
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:23,748
- You don't need to be normal.
- But I want to be, Nana.

471
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:26,250
I have to be.

472
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,184
Hey, wait up! Hey!

473
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:30,000
Listen, I'd really like
to talk to you...

474
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,818
Listen, I'd really like
to talk to you...

475
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,519
About that poem.

476
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,952
You see, you should not
have thrown it out.

477
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:40,087
How about tonight
after lacrosse?

478
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,687
I've seen you there.

479
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:44,954
Haven't I?

480
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:46,988
I can't tonight. I have someth--

481
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:48,922
How about tomorrow morning?
Early?

482
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:51,156
- How early?
- 6:00.

483
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:54,491
6:00 in the morning? He's crazy.

484
00:30:52,473 --> 00:30:54,207
Hi.

485
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:00,000
Hi.

486
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:01,576
Hi.

487
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,415
Are you scared of everything?

488
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,816
It's like you're gonna
break or something if I--

489
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:40,386
That poem was
about me, wasn't it?

490
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:44,820
No.

491
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:48,855
I mean... not really.

492
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:53,089
Well, it sure sounded like me.

493
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:57,424
Who was it,
if it wasn't about me?

494
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:03,692
It wasn't about anybody.

495
00:32:14,962 --> 00:32:17,462
Come here.

496
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:25,965
Sad eyes. Where'd you
get such sad eyes?

497
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:29,999
She loves me.

498
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,432
She loves me.

499
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,434
She loves me not.

500
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,402
She loves me.

501
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:40,734
She loves me not.

502
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:43,436
She loves me.

503
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:46,736
She loves me.

504
00:32:46,737 --> 00:32:49,572
She loves--

505
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:53,072
Hey, flower girl!

506
00:32:57,574 --> 00:32:59,999
Scared I'll pull
your petals off?

507
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,280
Scared I'll pull
your petals off?

508
00:33:02,008 --> 00:33:05,575
I'm asking you, who is this boy?

509
00:33:05,576 --> 00:33:08,709
He's right. Last year everyone
talked about running away.

510
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,576
Not me.

511
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:13,844
I can't even say shit or fuck
without getting scared.

512
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:16,611
- What did you say?
- I can't--

513
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:18,744
I can't even say them.

514
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:20,846
What was that? What what?

515
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:22,313
Shit. Fuck.

516
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:24,546
- I can't hear you.
- Shit! Fuck!

517
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:27,747
Oh, yes, now I hear you!
I never hear those words.

518
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:29,999
- How come? Everyone says them.
- Not around here.

519
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,515
- How come? Everyone says them.
- Not around here.

520
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:34,449
Please, say them for me again.

521
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,551
- What?
- Come on. Say them.

522
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,318
Oh. Come on, Daisy. Please!

523
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,852
Daisy. Say them!

524
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:46,319
Say them. Say them.

525
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,820
Say them.

526
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:52,821
Wh--

527
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,524
He's never gonna come.
I know it.

528
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:05,425
He's never gonna be there.

529
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:08,625
I wrecked it.
I wrecked everything

530
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:10,925
in that coffee shop.

531
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:13,793
<i>And he'd like you.
I know he would.</i>

532
00:34:13,794 --> 00:34:15,960
If he ever got to know you,
he'd love you.

533
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:19,462
Guess who.

534
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,696
I always knew you
talked to someone.

535
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:26,664
I just didn't know
he'd be a dog.

536
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:29,999
Um...

537
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,831
Um...

538
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:34,566
Howie, this is Ethan;
Ethan, Howard.

539
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:39,833
Well, he wants to go
for a run, don't you?

540
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,335
Don't you want to
run with Ethan?

541
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:44,801
Well, what are we
waiting for, man?

542
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:46,436
Come on. Let's go.

543
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,772
So...

544
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:05,307
We're finally here.

545
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:08,575
Together, I mean.

546
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,842
Isn't that what you wanted?

547
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:15,710
I mean, every morning,
the street...

548
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:18,310
The secret tree.

549
00:35:18,311 --> 00:35:20,979
The one you thought I didn't
see you hiding behind.

550
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,246
Your face.

551
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:29,280
The way you look at me in class.

552
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:29,999
The way you always look at me

553
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,881
the way you always look at me

554
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:34,616
every time you see me.

555
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:43,383
Oh, maybe I was wrong.

556
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:45,886
Maybe I just imagined
all those things.

557
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:50,919
Tell me I imagined them and
we'll forget all about this.

558
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,786
- No, you didn't imagine anything.
- Oh.

559
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:55,686
She speaks to me.

560
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,989
At last.

561
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:02,989
So you do want to be here

562
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,290
with me?

563
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:09,192
Say it.

564
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:15,192
Yes.

565
00:36:15,193 --> 00:36:17,360
I do.

566
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,561
More than anything.

567
00:36:21,861 --> 00:36:23,595
You're not sorry you came?

568
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,729
I'm not sorry.

569
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,999
All those times on my
street, why didn't--

570
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,364
All those times on my
street, why didn't--

571
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:35,330
Why didn't you say
something? Anything?

572
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:38,198
Why didn't you just talk to me?

573
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,732
Girls talk to me all the time.

574
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:43,367
Oh, but I did.

575
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,301
You did? When? I don't remember.

576
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:50,302
In the poem.

577
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:10,642
Promise me something?

578
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:14,676
Don't be afraid of me.

579
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:18,409
Say you won't be.

580
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,810
I'd hate it if you were.

581
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:27,145
I won't be. I promise.

582
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,999
Trust me.

583
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,500
Trust me.

584
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:34,214
I won't hurt you.

585
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:38,180
I know.

586
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:40,449
I couldn't. I wouldn't know how.

587
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,417
Daisy.

588
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:50,818
It suits you.

589
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:55,353
You really are a flower.

590
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,422
Like petals.

591
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:08,889
Flowers break, you know.

592
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,791
You have to treat them gently.

593
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:27,228
Come on. Let's go.

594
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:38,698
Whoo-hoo!

595
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,433
No.

596
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:50,167
- Have some.
- Right here.

597
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:53,167
Wasn't that fun, Howard?
Didn't you have a good time?

598
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:56,068
I knew you would.
I knew you'd like Ethan.

599
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:57,402
I knew you'd love him.

600
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:59,999
Wasn't that the best day
of your whole life?

601
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,070
Wasn't that the best day
of your whole life?

602
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,337
It was of mine.

603
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:05,338
It really was.

604
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,238
Well, there'll be more days.

605
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,507

I bet they changed
their minds again.

635
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,330
I bet they're on
their way right now.

636
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,031
Talk to them, Nana.
Make them understand.

637
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:52,099
One more night.

638
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,631
Just give me one more night.

639
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:57,400
Oh, sashyenka, is that you?

640
00:42:57,401 --> 00:42:59,533
Tonight?

641
00:42:59,534 --> 00:43:00,000

But why not?

644
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,336
It's only one more night.

645
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:12,104
Oh. Another German test.

646
00:43:12,105 --> 00:43:14,371
But I can help.

647
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:16,338
Of course I can.

648
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:19,672
Believe me, it's not as if
I've forgotten my German.

649
00:43:19,673 --> 00:43:22,073
Ah.

650
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:24,375
<i>She reads too much.</i>

651
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:29,408
I read "Anna Karenina"
when I was 12.

652
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:29,999
I know there's a suicide.

653
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,975
I know there's a suicide.

654
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:35,243
Fine, fine, fine.
We read something else.

655
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:37,611
She has another book here.

656
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:41,045
I know you'll be in a hurry.

657
00:43:41,046 --> 00:43:43,245
She'll be ready.

658
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:47,046
No pancakes. No maple syrup.

659
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:49,513
She'll do her homework.

660
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:52,615
Her German. What else?

661
00:43:53,982 --> 00:43:56,483
I'm not trying to be funny.

662
00:43:57,617 --> 00:43:59,999
I'm not using a tone. What tone?

663
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,484
I'm not using a tone. What tone?

664
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:05,351
Oh! I didn't know she used one.

665
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:08,352
I don't know anything
about tones.

666
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:10,352
All right, all right.

Oh, god. That's Sunset.

692
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,306
Das feuer.

693
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,874

00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:15,986
Links. Rechts.

711
00:46:15,987 --> 00:46:19,787
<i>Links. Rechts.</i>

712
00:46:19,788 --> 00:46:21,455
Nana?

713
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:28,523
Nana, I'm dead.

714
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:29,999
Ach so, mein engel.

715
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,756
Ach so, mein engel.

716
00:46:30,757 --> 00:46:33,791
Stop speaking German.
You never speak German.

717
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:35,024
Aber du wolltest.

718
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,125
Okay, that's enough.

719
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:41,094
Next stay, we'll do more. Maybe.

720
00:46:54,497 --> 00:46:57,098
Yeah! Yeah!

721
00:47:11,835 --> 00:47:14,435
No more sad eyes.
No more. No more.

722
00:47:14,436 --> 00:47:17,235
- Know what?
- What?

723
00:47:17,236 --> 00:47:20,204
- They're still sad.
- They are not.

724
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,970
- They are?
- Definitely.

725
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,939
They always give you away.

726
00:47:41,377 --> 00:47:43,477
Why do you like me?

727
00:47:45,811 --> 00:47:48,045
Why do I like you?

728
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:53,680
First of all because you're--

729
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:58,713
And 'cause you're--

730
00:47:58,714 --> 00:47:59,999
And a little bit--

731
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,314
And a little bit--

732
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:05,949
And sometimes you're--

733
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,350
But most of all--

734
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:17,953
Uh!

735
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:56,396
<i>"All happy families
resemble one another,</i>

736
00:48:56,397 --> 00:48:59,997
but each unhappy family
is unhappy in its own--"

737
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:05,164
you know something? My
grandmother gave me this book.

738
00:49:05,165 --> 00:49:07,965
- <i>It's her favorite book in the whole world.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

739
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:10,266
Your grandmother this.
Your grandmother that.

740
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:14,968
I never heard someone talk about
their grandmother so much.

741
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:19,335
So tell me...

742
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:23,037
When do I get to meet this
famous grandmother of yours?

743
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,105
Or don't you think
she'd like me?

744
00:49:28,939 --> 00:49:29,999
Remember the day that woman
came and spoke to the class?

745
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,638
Remember the day that woman
came and spoke to the class?

746
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,340
What woman?
What are you talking about?

747
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,307
You know, she talked about

748
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:41,108
the concentration camps
and everything?

749
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:43,342
Uh, that woman. Yeah.

750
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:49,344
- Well, my grandmother--
- Again? You're kidding me.

751
00:49:50,911 --> 00:49:53,679
Okay, I'm sorry.
Your grandmother what?

752
00:49:55,146 --> 00:49:57,245
She is one.

753
00:49:57,246 --> 00:49:59,046
One what?

754
00:49:59,047 --> 00:49:59,999
One of the people
who was in the camps.

755
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,980
One of the people
who was in the camps.

756
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:04,948
One of those?

757
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:07,082
One of those people?

758
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:11,915
And, like, all those things
we heard about--

759
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:13,916
All those slides,
those stories--

760
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:17,251
- Yeah.
- They happened to her.

761
00:50:17,252 --> 00:50:20,118
Wow. Really?

762
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:23,619
She had this friend,
this beautiful friend.

763
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,720
- <i>She loved her so much.</i>
- Yeah?

764
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:29,222
They were always together,
all the time.

765
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:32,754
But then in the end,

766
00:50:32,755 --> 00:50:34,989
when she was in the ghetto
and everything,

767
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,822
and when they came
to take her away--

768
00:50:36,823 --> 00:50:39,990
Don't you get kind of de--
Depressed talking

769
00:50:39,991 --> 00:50:42,190
about concentration camps
and stuff like that?

770
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:44,958
I mean, like, we're sitting here

771
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,960
<i>talking about death,
for god's sake.</i>

772
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,560
Come on. Lighten up.

773
00:50:51,827 --> 00:50:53,994
Let's get ice cream.

774
00:50:53,995 --> 00:50:58,062
And then we'll rent
a video or something.

775
00:50:58,063 --> 00:50:59,896
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

776
00:51:47,876 --> 00:51:51,510
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

777
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:53,243
Why would someone do
something like that?

778
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:56,210
Why, Jess? I don't understand.

779
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:59,999
They're bastards, that's why.
They can't help themselves.

780
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,112
They're bastards, that's why.
They can't help themselves.

781
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:03,979
Why me, Jess?

782
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,746
Why not you?

783
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,180
I've gotta go back
in there and take it off.

784
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:09,881
- No, wait.
- What for?

785
00:52:09,882 --> 00:52:12,148
I don't want anybody to see it.
Nobody can see it, Jess.

786
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:14,948
Please, I've gotta get it
off that locker.

787
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:17,750
I'll get it off. I don't want
you looking at it again.

788
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:22,050
No.

789
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:24,085
No, it's mine.

790
00:52:24,086 --> 00:52:26,887
It was meant for me.

791
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,023
<i>- "Is this a train, mama?
- It doesn't look like a train."</i>

792
00:52:43,024 --> 00:52:45,023
<i>Another step,
I could have touched her.</i>

793
00:52:45,024 --> 00:52:48,458
<i>- "Hold my hand tight."
- "I'm holding it, mama."</i>

794
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:50,491
<i>Maybe they told her lies.</i>

795
00:52:50,492 --> 00:52:52,592
<i>There are too many people.
I can't breathe in here.</i>

796
00:52:52,593 --> 00:52:56,160
<i>Breathe, dora.
Nothing else matters.</i>

797
00:52:56,161 --> 00:52:58,494
<i>Unknown.</i>

798
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:23,100
Remember when I was little
and I asked you?

799
00:53:23,101 --> 00:53:25,867
Mm. You were so tiny.

800
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:28,735
We were having a bath together.

801
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:29,999
"What's that, Nana?
Why do you wear that?

802
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,903
"What's that, Nana?
Why do you wear that?

803
00:53:32,904 --> 00:53:34,670
What's that on your arm?"

804
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:36,504
"Are you sure you didn't
do anything wrong

805
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:39,504
to make them do that to you?"

806
00:53:39,505 --> 00:53:41,873
Let me see it, Nana.
Show it to me.

807
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:47,640
<i>"A." "A" is for Auschwitz.</i>

808
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,608
Oswiecim.

809
00:53:51,442 --> 00:53:54,443
A24839.

810
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,999
Mm.

811
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,444
Mm.

812
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:04,711
Eins, zwei, drei, vier...

813
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:07,045
- Funf.
- Fimpf. Oh, fimpf. Fumpf.

814
00:54:07,046 --> 00:54:08,946
- I can never get that "fumpf."
- Funf.

815
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:10,613
Are you sure you're warm enough?

816
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,414
You know I can't sleep
without them.

817
00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:15,614
- Nana, don't go.
- Who's going?

818
00:54:15,615 --> 00:54:18,549
One. Tell me just one.

819
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,516
- Oh, Daisy!
- Come on. Tell me about them.

820
00:54:21,517 --> 00:54:24,017
Once...

821
00:54:24,018 --> 00:54:26,484
Once there were
three little girls.

822
00:54:26,485 --> 00:54:28,784
Anushya, marushya and varushya.

823
00:54:28,785 --> 00:54:29,999
Three sisters.

824
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,652
Three sisters.

825
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:34,085
Anushya was the oldest.
She was just my age.

826
00:54:34,086 --> 00:54:37,754
And marushya and varushya,
the little ones, the twins--

827
00:54:37,755 --> 00:54:41,655
They wore white sailor suits and
got into mischief all the time.

828
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:46,123
They had dark, golden hair
and golden eyes.

829
00:54:46,124 --> 00:54:48,156
Three little flowers.

830
00:54:48,157 --> 00:54:50,124
They were all very beautiful.

831
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,624
But marushya and varushya...

832
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,624
Were the most beautiful of all.

833
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:58,560
They lived in a house with rickety
windows and rickety doors,

834
00:54:58,561 --> 00:54:59,999
and they slept
in a small, rickety bed.

835
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,427
And they slept
in a small, rickety bed.

836
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:06,094
<i>A great wall surrounded
their house,</i>

837
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:09,628
<i>a wall which
they could not go beyond.</i>

838
00:55:09,629 --> 00:55:12,362
<i>Go on.</i>

839
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:14,664
<i>Early one morning,</i>

840
00:55:14,665 --> 00:55:18,031
<i>their mother and father
woke anushya and said,</i>

841
00:55:18,032 --> 00:55:21,599
<i>"quick, take the little
ones' hands and run, run,</i>

842
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,599
<i>for here, it is no longer safe.</i>

843
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,601
Follow the stream
that flows past our house,

844
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:29,999
<i>and it will take you
through a crack in the wall.</i>

845
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,868
<i>And it will take you
through a crack in the wall.</i>

846
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:36,403
<i>Run all day till the stream
turns into a river,</i>

847
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:38,603
<i>and the river turns
into the sea.</i>

848
00:55:38,604 --> 00:55:40,671
<i>And there, in the dark,</i>

849
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:44,605
<i>a boat will be waiting
to take you to a safe place,</i>

850
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:47,039
<i>the place
where we all shall meet."</i>

851
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,773
Yes, tell me.

852
00:55:49,774 --> 00:55:53,607
<i>Fast, faster they ran
till they saw the sea...</i>

853
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:56,341
<i>With a small boat waiting.</i>

854
00:55:56,342 --> 00:55:59,108
<i>They had almost reached it.</i>

855
00:55:59,109 --> 00:55:59,999
<i>They were almost there
when a shadow overtook them,</i>

856
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,610
<i>they were almost there
when a shadow overtook them,</i>

857
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:07,711
<i>small at first
but growing larger,</i>

858
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:09,678
<i>till like magic</i>

859
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,012
<i>it turned into an angel
before them.</i>

860
00:56:13,013 --> 00:56:15,446
They drew back,

861
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:19,614
for surely this was the angel
of their dream.

862
00:56:19,615 --> 00:56:22,515
<i>They would've
known him anywhere.</i>

863
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:27,083
<i>Tall and beautiful he was,
with shining black hair</i>

864
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,750
<i>and pale white skin.</i>

865
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:30,000
<i>He smiled at them
and held out his hands.</i>

866
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:34,351
<i>He smiled at them
and held out his hands.</i>

867
00:56:34,352 --> 00:56:36,852
And they saw he wore gloves.

868
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,686
White gloves.

869
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,853
- And boots.
- Black boots.

870
00:56:40,854 --> 00:56:43,853
And he carried
a magical shining wand.

871
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:45,755
The wand.

872
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:50,357
He couldn't come and get
me, could he, Nana?

873
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,890
He couldn't come
inside my nightmares?

874
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:55,490
Of course not.

875
00:56:55,491 --> 00:56:57,624
There's no way in the world

876
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,858
that he could come and get you.

877
00:56:59,859 --> 00:57:00,000
I haven't done anything.

878
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:01,558
I haven't done anything.

879
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,759
No, you haven't done anything.

880
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,827
Go on. You have
to finish this time.

881
00:57:06,828 --> 00:57:10,494
The black boots.
The magical shining wand.

882
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:15,329
In that wand, he held all
the power in the world.

883
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:19,297
The power over life
and death itself.

884
00:57:21,532 --> 00:57:24,398
Do you have enough to eat,
little children?

885
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,599
<i>Do you have enough to drink?</i>

886
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,999
Oh, surely, surely
they had nothing to fear.

887
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,367
Oh, surely, surely
they had nothing to fear.

888
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:33,435
For surely he had come
to save them.

889
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:37,535
<i>And he looked down on them</i>

890
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:39,636
<i>and stroked their hair
and said...</i>

891
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:41,869
- Do you not know me?
- <i>"Do you not know me?"</i>

892
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:46,504
I am I'ange de la mort,
malach hamovess--

893
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,439
The angel of death.

894
00:58:00,508 --> 00:58:03,743
Come with me, and I will
take you to your parents.

895
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:09,712
Come with me,
and you will be safe.

896
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:17,779
<i>And marushya and varushya,</i>

897
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,980
<i>the little ones, the twins,</i>

898
00:58:19,981 --> 00:58:22,614
<i>looked up at him with hope.</i>

899
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:25,214
<i>And he laid his arm upon them,</i>

900
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:28,649
<i>separating them from anushya.</i>

901
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:29,999
And as I felt them slip away,

902
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,283
and as I felt them slip away,

903
00:58:32,284 --> 00:58:34,683
I held even more tightly

904
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:37,551
onto their thin little hands.

905
00:58:37,552 --> 00:58:42,486
<i>I let go. I let go and gazed</i>

906
00:58:42,487 --> 00:58:45,453
<i>at their golden hair and eyes.</i>

907
00:58:45,454 --> 00:58:49,221
- And it seemed to me they
were like two-- - flowers.

908
00:58:49,222 --> 00:58:53,589
Two flowers just ready
to be picked.

909
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,624
What happened to anushya?

910
00:58:58,625 --> 00:58:59,999
Oh, anushya.

911
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,790
Oh, anushya.

912
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:03,459
Mayn daisele.

913
00:59:04,759 --> 00:59:08,194
Anushya is still here.

914
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,731
Two flowers.

915
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:27,165
Ready to be picked.

916
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:29,999
Nana!

917
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,567
Nana!

918
00:59:39,902 --> 00:59:41,636
Nana!

919
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:47,471
Nana!

920
00:59:49,438 --> 00:59:51,505
Nana!

921
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:57,773
Nana!

922
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:36,549
Uh, just a little
something that's come up.

923
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,750
Nothing serious.

924
01:00:37,751 --> 01:00:39,652
<i>Custard?</i>

925
01:00:41,518 --> 01:00:43,518
<i>Oh. Vanilla custard.</i>

926
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,186
<i>How did you think of it?</i>

927
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:50,420
What an imagination.

928
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:53,521
- Don't tell. Please.
- <i>I really can't go into it now.</i>

929
01:00:53,522 --> 01:00:55,621
Please, Jessica, you promised.

930
01:00:55,622 --> 01:00:58,889
We're having a special assembly today.
don't worry.

931
01:00:58,890 --> 01:00:59,999
Oh, my god, you told him
already, didn't you?

932
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,224
Oh, my god, you told him
already, didn't you?

933
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:06,758
I don't believe it.
Why? Why, Jess?

934
01:01:06,759 --> 01:01:09,092
I had to. I knew you wouldn't.

935
01:01:11,227 --> 01:01:16,260
♪ Bring me my chariot of fire ♪

936
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:21,628

♪ In england's green

941
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:50,536
Before we go on with
our usual Friday assembly,

942
01:01:50,537 --> 01:01:54,070
I wish to bring up an incident.

943
01:01:54,071 --> 01:01:56,837
<i>A series of incidents, in fact,</i>

944
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,999
which, it shames me to say--

945
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,206
Which, it shames me to say--

946
01:02:00,207 --> 01:02:02,673
It should shame us all--

947
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:06,073
Occurred recently at our school.

948
01:02:06,074 --> 01:02:09,107
- What's he talking about?
- <i>A profanation.</i>

949
01:02:09,108 --> 01:02:13,309
<i>Because it means even here,</i>

950
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:17,343
even at hunt,
where we think of ourselves

951
01:02:17,344 --> 01:02:20,477
as sheltered, shielded,

952
01:02:20,478 --> 01:02:22,778
how can such things happen?

953
01:02:22,779 --> 01:02:25,712
<i>We owe an apology</i>

954
01:02:25,713 --> 01:02:28,346
<i>to you, the innocent ones.</i>

955
01:02:28,347 --> 01:02:29,999
<i>You who may be different,</i>

956
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,647
<i>you who may be different,</i>

957
01:02:30,648 --> 01:02:33,348
<i>but who must be made to feel</i>

958
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:36,315
<i>exactly the same
as the rest of us.</i>

959
01:02:36,316 --> 01:02:38,582
Coming here today,

960
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:41,116
I did not wish
to name the victims;

961
01:02:41,117 --> 01:02:45,217
Neither to name the
perpetrators of these crimes,

962
01:02:45,218 --> 01:02:49,052
<i>for surely that is
what they are.</i>

963
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:52,253
<i>And I am certain
that each of you,</i>

964
01:02:52,254 --> 01:02:54,720
victim and perpetrator,

965
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:59,121
<i>knows in your heart
exactly who you are.</i>

966
01:02:59,122 --> 01:02:59,999
<i>But, in order for such incidents</i>

967
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,389
<i>but, in order for such incidents</i>

968
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,389
<i>never to be repeated,</i>

969
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,756
such as the vilification
of one's name,

970
01:03:07,757 --> 01:03:12,191
<i>the desecration
of one's personal property,</i>

971
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:16,159
I am convinced it is
for your own good

972
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,793
<i>and the good of us all</i>

973
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:22,760
that when I call your names,
I want you to stand

974
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:25,096
<i>and make yourself known.</i>

975
01:03:45,767 --> 01:03:48,734
- Oh, my god, what's--
- <i>Daisy. Daisy.</i>

976
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,568
Do you have enough
to eat, little children?

977
01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:53,637
Do you have enough to drink?

978
01:03:56,037 --> 01:03:57,971
<i>Daisy?</i>

979
01:04:01,072 --> 01:04:03,006
Daisy?

980
01:04:13,275 --> 01:04:15,743
Oh, man, that fainting.

981
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:21,309
That was no act. That was real.

982
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:24,510
I mean, like, you fainted

983
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:27,211
in front of the whole school.

984
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:29,313
Takes guts.

985
01:04:31,947 --> 01:04:35,113
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know. I--

986
01:04:35,114 --> 01:04:38,247
I've never seen someone faint
before, not in my whole life.

987
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:41,082
Everyone I know is so normal.

988
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:43,649
Yeah, well, you can't help it.

989
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:46,983
- What? What do you mean?
- What?

990
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:49,384
You know, you're an only child.

991
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,251
You're so sensitive
and everything.

992
01:04:51,252 --> 01:04:54,219
I wish I weren't.

993
01:05:03,621 --> 01:05:05,655
How do you think she got
an "a" in gym, dude?

994
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:07,389
The girl can hardly
throw a softball.

995
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,422
And she never even showed up.

996
01:05:09,423 --> 01:05:12,156
- She was never there.
- She's off smoking in the bathroom.

997
01:05:12,157 --> 01:05:14,657
<i>Good point.</i>

998
01:05:14,658 --> 01:05:16,991
- A book!
- A book! Can you--

999
01:05:16,992 --> 01:05:18,392
We're in the middle
of central park,

1000
01:05:18,393 --> 01:05:20,225
and she's reading a book.

1001
01:05:20,226 --> 01:05:21,992
You want to tell me
what's up with that?

1002
01:05:21,993 --> 01:05:24,526
- Yeah, what's up with you, man?
- Me?

1003
01:05:24,527 --> 01:05:27,160
- Yeah, you.
- I'm the same old guy.

1004
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,999
Yeah, maybe, but, um--

1005
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,129
Yeah, maybe, but, um--

1006
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:32,995
You know, we never see
too much of you anymore.

1007
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:36,230
- Yeah. You're always with that "reader."
- So?

1008
01:05:36,231 --> 01:05:40,131
So what we're saying, eth,
is it's really not cool.

1009
01:05:40,132 --> 01:05:43,231
Watch out. You might
catch what she's got.

1010
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:44,933
What's that?

1011
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:48,401
Weirdness.

1012
01:05:52,235 --> 01:05:54,402
- Aw, look at that.
- <i>Mm, look at that.</i>

1013
01:05:56,103 --> 01:05:58,502
<i>Look at 'em all, eth.</i>

1014
01:05:58,503 --> 01:05:59,999
Every girl on that field wants
your jock, you know that?

1015
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,160
Every girl on that field wants
your jock, you know that?

1016
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:05,504
You could have your pick.
Your entire pick.

1017
01:06:05,505 --> 01:06:09,305
Yeah, and look who he picks?

1018
01:06:09,306 --> 01:06:10,506
Another Anne frank.

1019
01:06:10,507 --> 01:06:13,074
<i>Flower girl.</i>

1020
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,441
You're here.

1021
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,508
You were waiting for me?

1022
01:06:21,509 --> 01:06:24,242
Always wait for me, will you?

1023
01:06:24,243 --> 01:06:25,477
Always.

1024
01:06:25,478 --> 01:06:27,110
Always. I promise.

1025
01:06:27,111 --> 01:06:29,311
- Come.
- Where are we going?

1026
01:06:29,312 --> 01:06:29,999
There. Up there to the castle.

1027
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,211
There. Up there to the castle.

1028
01:06:31,212 --> 01:06:33,045
Look, it's like a fairy tale.

1029
01:06:33,046 --> 01:06:35,245
Fairy tales aren't real.
They're just make-believe.

1030
01:06:35,246 --> 01:06:37,046
Oh, no.

1031
01:06:37,047 --> 01:06:39,279
- Come on.
- You're crazy.

1032
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,314
You know that? You're
absolutely out of your mind.

1033
01:06:41,315 --> 01:06:43,215
Come on. Come on.

1034
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:45,349
Come on.

1035
01:06:53,251 --> 01:06:55,218
You're trembling.

1036
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:57,084
Am I?

1037
01:06:57,085 --> 01:06:58,519
All over.

1038
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,255
Look at you.

1039
01:07:08,255 --> 01:07:09,989
Those eyes again.

1040
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:14,223
Say it.

1041
01:07:14,224 --> 01:07:16,223
What?

1042
01:07:16,224 --> 01:07:18,157
You know.

1043
01:07:18,158 --> 01:07:20,191
Say it.

1044
01:07:22,025 --> 01:07:24,127
I want you to say it to me.

1045
01:07:28,194 --> 01:07:29,428
Ethan.

1046
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:35,396
Ethan.

1047
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:39,230
Ethan.

1048
01:07:39,231 --> 01:07:40,864
Hey.

1049
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:58,101
No.

1050
01:07:58,102 --> 01:07:59,503
Why?

1051
01:08:04,137 --> 01:08:05,970
Not now. Not yet.

1052
01:08:05,971 --> 01:08:08,238
But when?

1053
01:08:09,471 --> 01:08:11,304
- You just--
- No, I know.

1054
01:08:11,305 --> 01:08:13,172
I know. I just--

1055
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,039
When?

1056
01:08:16,907 --> 01:08:18,307
When?

1057
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:24,208
Wait for me.

1058
01:08:24,209 --> 01:08:26,276
Please.

1059
01:08:29,778 --> 01:08:30,000
Please.

1060
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:31,511
Please.

1061
01:08:51,883 --> 01:08:54,849
- You know something?
- Huh?

1062
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:57,917
This is my favorite place
in the whole city.

1063
01:08:57,918 --> 01:08:59,999
Your favorite?

1064
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,318
Your favorite?

1065
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,419
<i>Wow.</i>

1066
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,119
Even when I was little,
my grandmother used to--

1067
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,486
I mean, I used to come here
all the time by myself.

1068
01:09:08,487 --> 01:09:11,754
Uh-huh.

1069
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:14,355
<i>Lots of people don't
even know it's here.</i>

1070
01:09:14,356 --> 01:09:16,755
This incredible, magical place

1071
01:09:16,756 --> 01:09:18,256
right in the middle
of New York City.

1072
01:09:18,257 --> 01:09:20,856
Sometimes I can't--

1073
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:22,857
I can't even really
believe it exists.

1074
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,858
Can you believe it?

1075
01:09:26,926 --> 01:09:29,999
No. I mean--

1076
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,326
No. I mean--

1077
01:09:30,327 --> 01:09:32,759
<i>Not really.</i>

1078
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,394
No, I mean, it's really great.

1079
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:38,861
Sometimes I even come and ride

1080
01:09:38,862 --> 01:09:40,496
with all the little kids
and everything.

1081
01:09:43,397 --> 01:09:45,963
And now--

1082
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:47,830
Now?

1083
01:09:47,831 --> 01:09:50,864
Well, now I'm here
in a different way.

1084
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:54,833
I mean, now I'm here with you.

1085
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:59,868
And, like, I can't
really believe it.

1086
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:05,202
'Cause it's, like--
I don't know.

1087
01:10:05,203 --> 01:10:08,235
It's sort of like a dream.

1088
01:10:08,236 --> 01:10:11,838
A dream. Yeah.

1089
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,373
Yeah, so what do you guys think
about that Douglas, huh?

1090
01:10:21,374 --> 01:10:24,807
Useless book to read.
I haven't even started.

1091
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:28,975
- Well, you got all tomorrow.
- If he sleeps off tonight.

1092
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:35,776
Uh, "Tess of the doberdolls."

1093
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:37,844
- I can't even get the name straight.
- It's dooberdogs.

1094
01:10:37,845 --> 01:10:39,844
"Tess of the dooberdogs."

1095
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:43,845
D'urbervilles.
"Tess of the d'urbervilles."

1096
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:46,979
- Whatever.
- <i>Yeah, who cares?</i>

1097
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,747
<i>Why do I have to read
about some stupid whore?</i>

1098
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:51,181
How can you say that?

1099
01:10:51,182 --> 01:10:54,981
She was abandoned, alone. Haven't
you ever felt like that?

1100
01:10:54,982 --> 01:10:57,882
I mean, don't you understand?
What else could she do?

1101
01:10:57,883 --> 01:10:59,999
- Back off there, girl.
- <i>No doubt. Relax, Daisy.</i>

1102
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,950
- Back off there, girl.
- <i>No doubt. Relax, Daisy.</i>

1103
01:11:01,951 --> 01:11:05,918
She wasn't a whore.
She's not a whore.

1104
01:11:05,919 --> 01:11:08,351
Relax.

1105
01:11:08,352 --> 01:11:10,020
We're only kidding.

1106
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:17,787
- Hey! Look who's here.
- Hey!

1107
01:11:17,788 --> 01:11:19,855
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?

1108
01:11:19,856 --> 01:11:22,356
- Dance time?
- This is her lucky day.

1109
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:27,024
You're joking, right?

1110
01:11:27,025 --> 01:11:28,990
I'll flip you for her.

1111
01:11:28,991 --> 01:11:29,999
Yeah, right.

1112
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,393
Yeah, right.

1113
01:11:34,027 --> 01:11:35,893
Do you want some head
or some tail?

1114
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:39,928
Tails.

1115
01:12:46,812 --> 01:12:48,613
Hi.

1116
01:13:03,584 --> 01:13:04,883
God, these are great.

1117
01:13:04,884 --> 01:13:07,050
They're just great.
I could eat 1,000 of them.

1118
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:09,685
Well, you're getting close.

1119
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:11,952
You always say I'm too thin,

1120
01:13:11,953 --> 01:13:14,085
but if I lived with you,
I'd get fat.

1121
01:13:14,086 --> 01:13:15,987
Totally fat. Don't you think so?

1122
01:13:18,054 --> 01:13:19,855
Don't you think so, Nana?

1123
01:13:22,155 --> 01:13:24,021
You know what I think?

1124
01:13:24,022 --> 01:13:27,690
I think it's time
for a nice game of cards.

1125
01:13:29,257 --> 01:13:29,999
Go fish.

1126
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,858
Go fish.

1127
01:13:32,592 --> 01:13:35,724
- I love this game.
- Me, too.

1128
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:37,859
Do you have any fives?

1129
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:40,060
Hey.

1130
01:13:42,027 --> 01:13:43,594
I go again, right?

1131
01:13:43,595 --> 01:13:45,627
But why? What did I do wrong?

1132
01:13:45,628 --> 01:13:48,161
Nothing. You never
do anything wrong.

1133
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:50,162
You're perfect.

1134
01:13:50,163 --> 01:13:53,696
Do you have any queens?

1135
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:56,597
If you had them before,
why didn't you ask me before?

1136
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:57,864
You knew I wanted queens.

1137
01:13:57,865 --> 01:13:59,865
But I don't understand.
What's wrong with me?

1138
01:13:59,866 --> 01:14:00,000
Nothing. You're-- nothing.

1139
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:02,833
Nothing. You're-- nothing.

1140
01:14:04,133 --> 01:14:06,833
Do you have any nines?

1141
01:14:06,834 --> 01:14:09,067
I hate this game.
I don't wanna play.

1142
01:14:09,068 --> 01:14:12,734
Fine. I'll go and make
myself a nice cup of tea.

1143
01:14:12,735 --> 01:14:16,802
No! Pick. Go ahead.

1144
01:14:16,803 --> 01:14:19,004
- What?
- You're just so--

1145
01:14:20,037 --> 01:14:22,072
You're too intense.

1146
01:14:23,805 --> 01:14:25,939
It's embarrassing sometimes.

1147
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,005
Go on. Ask me.

1148
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:29,999
- Do you have any--
- Any what?

1149
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,140
- Do you have any--
- Any what?

1150
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:35,708
If you win, I'll kill you.

1151
01:14:35,709 --> 01:14:37,842
Maybe we could just be friends.

1152
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:44,744
Gotta go.
I'll be late otherwise.

1153
01:14:49,745 --> 01:14:51,712
Any kings?

1154
01:14:51,713 --> 01:14:54,880
I hate you! I hate you!

1155
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:58,146
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

1156
01:14:58,147 --> 01:14:59,999
I hate it here! I hate it!

1157
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,481
I hate it here! I hate it!

1158
01:15:01,482 --> 01:15:05,482
You'll see. You'll all see.

1159
01:15:05,483 --> 01:15:07,616
What will we see?

1160
01:15:07,617 --> 01:15:09,918
You know.

1161
01:15:17,152 --> 01:15:20,753
Don't you see there's
nothing I can do right?

1162
01:15:20,754 --> 01:15:23,254
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

1163
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:26,055
Don't touch me.
Get away from me!

1164
01:15:30,156 --> 01:15:32,856
Everyone says
I don't really look it.

1165
01:15:32,857 --> 01:15:34,589
What?

1166
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:37,857
You know. Like I am one.

1167
01:15:37,858 --> 01:15:40,057
One Jew.

1168
01:15:40,058 --> 01:15:42,725
Like I'm Jewish.

1169
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:46,959
Jew, Jew, animal,
vegetable, mineral, Jew.

1170
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,661
How can they tell?
Can they smell one?

1171
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:55,763
But not you, Daisy.
We'll always love you!

1172
01:15:59,564 --> 01:16:00,000
Except for the eyes.

1173
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:02,063
Except for the eyes.

1174
01:16:02,064 --> 01:16:04,764
The sadness in the eyes.

1175
01:16:04,765 --> 01:16:07,833
That's the one thing
that gives it away.

1176
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,466
I don't want to be chosen, Nana,

1177
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:13,767
like marushya and varushya!

1178
01:16:13,768 --> 01:16:15,102
I don't want to be taken away!

1179
01:16:22,737 --> 01:16:26,436
Oh, Nana,

1180
01:16:26,437 --> 01:16:28,604
talk to me.

1181
01:16:28,605 --> 01:16:29,999
Say something.

1182
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,560
Say something.

1183
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:34,507
Once there was a Nana
and a Daisy.

1184
01:16:36,474 --> 01:16:39,173
Oh, Nana.

1185
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:42,142
Please, won't you say anything?

1186
01:22:56,376 --> 01:22:57,342
Daisy!

1187
01:23:10,912 --> 01:23:13,445
I don't know what
makes me do those things,

1188
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:15,380
makes me say those things.

1189
01:23:15,381 --> 01:23:18,348
But I only do them with you,
Nana, only with you.

1190
01:23:20,515 --> 01:23:23,115
I feel so ugly, Nana.

1191
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:27,383
What are you talking about?
You're a beautiful girl.

1192
01:23:27,384 --> 01:23:29,999
- I know what I look like.
- Silly Daisy.

1193
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:30,784
- I know what I look like.
- Silly Daisy.

1194
01:23:30,785 --> 01:23:33,118
Don't call me that.
I hate that name.

1195
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:37,519
It's a beautiful name
and a beautiful flower,

1196
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,388
a flower that grows in the wild.

1197
01:23:42,421 --> 01:23:45,521
He loves me. He loves me not.

1198
01:23:45,522 --> 01:23:48,122
He loves me. He loves me not.

1199
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:51,789
He loves me. He loves me not.
He loves me.

1200
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:54,724
He loves me not, Nana.
He loves me not.

1201
01:23:56,659 --> 01:23:59,492
And all that's left is that horrible
little thing in the middle.

1202
01:23:59,493 --> 01:23:59,999
It's ugly.

1203
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,625
It's ugly.

1204
01:24:00,626 --> 01:24:02,825
A Daisy with
all its petals gone.

1205
01:24:02,826 --> 01:24:05,726
It's a survivor, a yellow
sun, a yellow star.

1206
01:24:05,727 --> 01:24:08,827
Do you know what people say?

1207
01:24:08,828 --> 01:24:11,628
They say it's a difficult age.

1208
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:13,762
- Mine, you mean?
- The moods.

1209
01:24:13,763 --> 01:24:15,629
That's what they talk about.

1210
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:17,796
The ups and downs.

1211
01:24:17,797 --> 01:24:20,530
I wonder if it's true.

1212
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:22,731
I'm tired.

1213
01:24:22,732 --> 01:24:24,765
Really tired.

1214
01:24:24,766 --> 01:24:28,066
- You are?
- Totally.

1215
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:29,999
Maybe we should
take a little walk?

1216
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,367
Maybe we should
take a little walk?

1217
01:24:30,368 --> 01:24:32,100
You mean, go out?

1218
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:33,701
I don't want to go out.
I don't want to move.

1219
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:35,768
- I'm fatigued.
- You're what?

1220
01:24:35,769 --> 01:24:38,068
I'm fatigued, fatigued.

1221
01:24:38,069 --> 01:24:40,436
I'm making pancakes,
thousands of them.

1222
01:24:40,437 --> 01:24:42,670
I can't eat. Don't force me.

1223
01:24:42,671 --> 01:24:44,804
Probably I'll never eat again.

1224
01:24:44,805 --> 01:24:46,804
- <i>And you know something?</i>
- What?

1225
01:24:46,805 --> 01:24:49,839
- I'm thinking of running away.
- Somewhere I know?

1226
01:24:51,407 --> 01:24:53,673
Where, Nana? Where would you go?

1227
01:24:53,674 --> 01:24:56,407
Oh, daisele, a little town

1228
01:24:56,408 --> 01:24:59,775
with winding streets
and winding hills.

1229
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,000
Everywhere green except for
the deep blue of the sky,

1230
01:25:00,001 --> 01:25:04,042
everywhere green except for
the deep blue of the sky,

1231
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:07,076
the lakes,
the wallpaper in my room.

1232
01:25:07,077 --> 01:25:09,576
And the singing,
the singing everywhere.

1233
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:12,744
All that singing stopped.

1234
01:25:12,745 --> 01:25:16,512
And the bookshop was yellow,

1235
01:25:16,513 --> 01:25:19,780
bright yellow,
like the heart of a Daisy.

1236
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,047
And before anyone came
in the morning,

1237
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,514
there was just my grandfather.

1238
01:25:24,515 --> 01:25:26,716
My grandfather and me.

1239
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:29,816
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1240
01:25:29,817 --> 01:25:30,000
♪ Daisy, Daisy,
give me your answer true ♪

1241
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:35,417
♪ Daisy, Daisy,

1242
01:25:35,418 --> 01:25:40,519

1244

1245
01:25:46,055 --> 01:25:48,788

1246
01:25:48,789 --> 01:25:51,222
♪ Of a bicycle built for two. ♪

1247
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:08,526
Don't be afraid
of kissing someone,

1248
01:26:08,527 --> 01:26:10,193
of loving someone,

1249
01:26:10,194 --> 01:26:13,495
afraid of life, even of death.

1250
01:26:14,995 --> 01:26:17,195
Afraid of saying those words.

1251
01:26:17,196 --> 01:26:20,130
- What words?
- You know.

1252
01:26:24,532 --> 01:26:26,498
Nana.

1253
01:26:30,099 --> 01:26:32,267
Oh, Nana.

1254
01:26:34,001 --> 01:26:36,667
Keep me with you. Keep me.

1255
01:26:36,668 --> 01:26:40,569
I can't. You know I can't.

1256
01:26:42,436 --> 01:26:45,004
Please, Nana. Please!

1257
01:26:47,438 --> 01:26:51,104
Nothing will happen, will it,
before I come back?

1258
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:53,538
Everything will
happen to you, Daisy.

1259
01:26:53,539 --> 01:26:55,272
Everything.

1260
01:26:55,273 --> 01:26:59,433
And then you'll come back.
You can always come back.

1261
01:27:15,283 --> 01:27:17,485
Nana.

1262
01:27:20,855 --> 01:27:23,189
It's all right, my Daisy.

1263
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:26,259
It's all right, mayn daisele.

1264
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,496
Go, go!

1265
01:27:35,269 --> 01:27:37,471
I'll be here.
