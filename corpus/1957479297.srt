1
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:06,702
No! Get off of me!

2
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:08,704
No! Get off of me!

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:11,533
No!

4
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:16,190
No! Get off of me! No! Please!!

5
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,066
Cassidy?

6
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,112
Cassidy?

7
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,073
Cassidy?

8
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,946
I'm waiting for your answer.

9
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:21,777
Would other members of
your family be at risk

10
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:24,258
if I were to allow you
to leave this hospital?

11
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:32,396
Is something funny?

12
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:39,490
Yes, Dr. Gershman.

13
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:42,972
Would you care to share
it with me?

14
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,017
No.

15
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,591
I see you've been drawing
on your arm again.

16
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,465
Do the black squares
represent something?

17
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,119
Just a game.

18
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,386
What sort of a game?

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,827
What sort of a game, Cassidy?

20
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,109
Hey hey hey. It's okay.

21
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,807
Mama's here. Mama's here.

22
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:23,377
Come on. It's okay.
Mama's here. It's okay.

23
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,988
I couldn't breathe. I know,
I know, it's okay. Here.

24
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,817
That roaring in my ears. Let's
get this off of you, okay?

25
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,601
Do you want your bucket?

26
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,212
No.

27
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:35,432
Alright here we go sweetie.

28
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,130
Under your tongue,
under your tongue, okay.

29
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,568
I couldn't.

30
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,134
I know sweetheart.
Let it dissolve.

31
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,528
Okay?

32
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,269
I couldn't get up
to the surface.

33
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:49,490
I know sweetie.
It was just a nightmare.

34
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,537
It was so real. I know.

35
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,060
The whistling. Everything.

36
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,845
I know.
But it wasn't real, was it?

37
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,890
No.No.

38
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:01,893
Hi Phil.

39
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,244
Sorry I woke you up again.

40
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,420
It's okay. Sleep's overrated.

41
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,857
Okay. You gonna be alright?

42
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:11,816
Promise? You sure?

43
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,949
Yeah. You're not gonna wake
me up again?

44
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,606
I love you. I love you too.

45
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,651
Get some sleep, okay?
And I'm right upstairs.

46
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,131
Okay.

47
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:28,355
I love you.

48
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,633
I'd have given up on me
years ago.

49
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,722
Good thing your Mom's not you.

50
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,724
What? Your Mom's no quitter, Em.

51
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,986
Face it.

52
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:52,292
We're not going to Jamaica or

53
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,684
Mexico or anywhere together

54
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,295
after grad unless
you beat this thing.

55
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,255
You think I could be going
crazy and not know it?

56
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,910
You're not going crazy, Emily.

57
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,955
Okay, maybe a little bit.

58
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,043
Tina!

59
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,130
Lighten up, will ya?

60
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,568
According to my Mom,

61
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,980
tons of girls our age
have anxiety attacks.

62
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,832
She sees them all
the time in Emerg.

63
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,660
They think they're having
heart attacks.

64
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,966
Stabs right here?

65
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,098
I've had those.

66
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,185
Really?

67
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,840
Like when?

68
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,687
Remember when Bigsley
laid that surprise test on us?

69
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,060
Then.

70
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,759
Just please, don't quit
your lessons.

71
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,892
Or, say goodbye to Mr. Hottie.

72
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,121
Cassidy.

73
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,881
Dr. Schwartzien said these
should hold you off

74
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,603
until they could make you
an outpatient.

75
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,713
Is someone coming
to pick you up?

76
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:49,349
No.

77
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,996
I hope things work
out for you, Cassidy.

78
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,011
Morning.

79
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,099
Hey.

80
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,230
Just the way you like it.

81
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,102
Thank you.

82
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,321
Behavioral therapy.

83
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,715
Aren't you already
an authority on that?

84
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,389
Well I was hoping this
site would give us

85
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,762
some different ideas.

86
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,067
Things we haven't tried before.

87
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,418
But all the same stuff.

88
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,507
Maybe you and Em need a break.

89
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,030
I mean, you said it yourself,

90
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,529
the poor kid goes from
one therapy to another

91
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:06,121
and you research
every one of them.

92
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,384
Em's a teenager now and
this might be something

93
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,212
she needs to figure out herself.

94
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,257
Thanks, Phil.

95
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,174
Thank you Phil.

96
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,221
You better get dressed.
It's a big day.

97
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,662
Can I have your attention
please.

98
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,012
Now don't forget you guys
need a warrant

99
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:32,103
before you go outfitting your
perp's car with a GPS tracker.

100
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,211
Anyone have any questions?

101
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,018
Captain.

102
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,411
Yes, Rydert.

103
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,239
How many did Ridgewood get?

104
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:42,810
18 surveillance cameras
and 12 GPS trackers.

105
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,899
Are these strictly
for narcotics captain?

106
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:47,467
Everyone meet Vic Monroe,
Rydert's new partner.

107
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,905
Morning.Welcome.

108
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:53,734
And the equipment is for anyone
who needs it and clears it with me.

109
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:55,170
I'll be in my office.

110
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:56,476
Alright, that's all folks.

111
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,924
Smoke? Oh, no thank you.
I haven't touched one of those

112
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:14,276
since my daughter was
about that size.

113
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,239
Cop with no vices, huh?

114
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,242
Gum.

115
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,419
I chew gum.
Sometimes I like to crack it.

116
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,379
Ooh, you're a dangerous girl.

117
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,513
Ah well.

118
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,427
How long you been in Ridgewood?

119
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,169
Um, 12 years.

120
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,998
I moved here so I could afford
to buy a house.

121
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:44,567
Couldn't see raising my little girl in
a one-bedroom apartment in Portland.

122
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,351
That's where you're from,
Portland?

123
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,440
Yeah, Forest Grove.

124
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,964
Used to be a small town,

125
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:53,576
and then Portland gobbled it
all up.

126
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,404
Why'd you leave Seattle?

127
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,583
I had my fill of big cities.

128
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,934
I grew up in a small town,
like this in the Midwest.

129
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,720
Friend of mine invited me
out to visit him here.

130
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,244
Ridgewood felt like home.

131
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,072
Never been married?

132
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,509
Nope. No?

133
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,119
No, I never saw a reason.

134
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,079
No kids.

135
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,559
Alright.

136
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,140
Sergeant Rydert!
Look, I got a new bike!

137
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,230
Hey, great! Keep your
hand on the bike, Brooks.

138
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:41,798
You know everybody around here?

139
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:43,191
No, just most of them.

140
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:48,936
Keep them moving, everybody.

141
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,286
Keep them moving. That's it.

142
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,157
Here, let me help you.

143
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,290
Lean back, that's it.

144
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:58,119
Good.

145
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,600
Light slip and let your legs
slide up.

146
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:02,645
Okay, keep moving.

147
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,825
That's good, good.

148
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,399
Now try it on your own.

149
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,453
Thought you'd given up.

150
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,872
I would if my Mom would let me.

151
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:33,284
Well, we just started.

152
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,939
Come on, you better
follow me now,

153
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:38,159
or he's going to have my hyde
for leaving the group.

154
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,828
Thanks for waiting.

155
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:56,675
I could have called to say
it was going over time

156
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,440
if Mom would let me
have a cell phone.

157
00:10:58,527 --> 00:10:59,789
No problem.

158
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,008
So let me get this straight.

159
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,574
You sat beside

160
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,707
while you let some fat
lady lay on Josh's hand?

161
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,100
I didn't let her, Tina.

162
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:07,623
I can't float.

163
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,233
Not if you don't get
in the water.

164
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,496
It's not like I don't try.

165
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:12,933
I do.

166
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,238
Did I say a word?

167
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:16,632
Anything?

168
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,678
You're good.

169
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,291
Did your Mom get an Avon lady?

170
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,033
See ya.

171
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Bye.

172
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:36,043
Excuse me!
Are you lost or something?

173
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,003
No, I'm looking for
Jane Rydert's house?

174
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,918
That's her house right there.

175
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,790
I'm Emily. Her daughter.

176
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:53,016
You're much prettier than Jane.

177
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,932
Thanks, I guess.

178
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,848
I'm Cassidy.

179
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,502
Emily.

180
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,634
Oh, I said that already,
didn't I?

181
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,290
Come on in!

182
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,297
Mom? Someone's here to see you.

183
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,473
Okay, be right there!

184
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:25,788
Cass.

185
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:27,877
Hello Janie.

186
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,879
What are you doing here?

187
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,969
I was discharged this morning.

188
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,583
I've been in the hospital.

189
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,760
Oh.

190
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,030
Well, you're just full
of surprises.

191
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,293
I had no idea you were
getting out.

192
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,035
I need a place to stay
for a few days,

193
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,427
just until I get set up.

194
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,393
Wow, it's so private here.

195
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,443
Could do anything you want
and no one would ever know.

196
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:20,974
Everybody watches everything
you do at the hospital.

197
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,587
Am I welcome, Janie?

198
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:30,810
Of course.

199
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,333
Um.

200
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,205
We have a pullout couch
in the storage room,

201
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,772
I'll show you. Come on.

202
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,522
Aren't you going to introduce
me to your family?

203
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,038
Um. Of course.

204
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,561
I...

205
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,434
This is Phil Martin, my fiancé.

206
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:49,132
And well, you've met Emily.

207
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,091
This is Cassidy,
my older sister.

208
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,373
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

209
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:54,659
Phil.

210
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:55,767
You said your older sister died

211
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,791
in a car crash.

212
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,072
Okay, um.

213
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,553
You can put your things in here

214
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,164
and I'll go get you some towels
and linens.

215
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,037
Sorry.

216
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,747
Um, I'll just put these here.

217
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,377
You can make your bed
when you're ready.

218
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:42,098
So what are your plans?

219
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,101
Plans?

220
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:47,582
Yes. Plans.
Like, now that you're out.

221
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,065
I don't know. Maybe I'll
stay here for a little while

222
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,241
and become better acquainted
with Phil and Emily.

223
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:56,678
Um.

224
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,201
Unfortunately I don't think

225
00:14:58,288 --> 00:14:59,463
that's going to work, Cass.

226
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,380
Hmm. That's too bad.

227
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,165
I'll let you know
when dinner's ready.

228
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,448
I thought your sister lived in a
long-term psychiatric facility.

229
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:30,581
She does. I don't know
what she's doing here.

230
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,453
Why are your whispering
out here?

231
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,194
Um, we're just trying
to figure out

232
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,326
if we have enough dinner
for everyone.

233
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,894
I really appreciate not
being treated like a child.

234
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,028
I'm sorry, love.
It's complicated.

235
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,768
Uncomplicate it for me then.

236
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,815
Why did you tell me
your sister was dead?

237
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:49,122
Is it because she was
in a hospital?

238
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,473
Look, this is not the time or the
place to talk about this, okay?

239
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,954
Whatever. I'll be in my room.

240
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,263
Really?

241
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,309
You guys haven't even
talked in years?

242
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,875
Well, we didn't come from the

243
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,442
generation of online chatters

244
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,618
and Cass's hospital
was in Oregon.

245
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:11,579
Long distance used
to be very expensive.

246
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,233
Isn't that right, Phil?

247
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:17,237
Well, I mean before
all the competition.

248
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,717
Long distance wasn't cheap.

249
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:22,894
No, my father always thought
of the phone

250
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:27,595
as a tool for emergencies
or necessary information.

251
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,162
Definitely not device
for chitchat.

252
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,120
They're being polite Emily.

253
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,689
It's okay. It's all water
under the bridge, now.

254
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,476
Mmm. This meatloaf is delicious.

255
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:41,043
You make this yourself, sis?

256
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,653
Um, no.

257
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,091
Phil does most of the cooking
around here.

258
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,921
I would love a man like you.

259
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,970
Um, I am back in school
this year

260
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,146
and I get home earlier
than Jane.

261
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,280
I agree with Aunt Cassidy.

262
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,586
This meatloaf is awesome, Phil.

263
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,371
You can just call me Cassidy,
hun.

264
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,590
Aunt anything makes
me feel ancient.

265
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,072
Which one of us
you think looks older?

266
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,033
I think you're both beautiful.

267
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:20,735
Well, a toast to Janie for
raising such a smart girl.

268
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,563
Hear hear.

269
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,439
So Phil, why don't
you tell Cassidy

270
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:32,355
about what you're doing
in school?

271
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,359
I'm getting my law degree.
Used to be a court officer.

272
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,884
Got tired of spending
my days with criminals

273
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,756
and crazy people.

274
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,370
Well, as a lawyer I'll be able to pick
and choose who I spend my time with

275
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:51,244
and I am very much
looking forward to that.

276
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,602
Well, who's ready for some
of my chocolate cake?

277
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,473
I know I am.Yes.

278
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,173
It's really good. Mmmm.

279
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:15,920
So what was that all about?
You agitated her.

280
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,749
By talking about my career?
It doesn't take much.

281
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:22,318
I know she's your sister and bipolar and
everything but is she okay to be here?

282
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,645
What did the doctor say
in the phone conversation?

283
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:27,018
They left the office by the time

284
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
I called so, shh, she's coming.

285
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:34,852
Hey Cass.

286
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:38,378
Don't worry about that,
you must be exhausted.

287
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,815
Oh.

288
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,344
Oh, you have a chess board.

289
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:49,998
You play Emily?

290
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,609
Sometimes. With my Mom.

291
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,525
I'll play a game
with you Cassidy.

292
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,528
Emily has homework to do, Cass.

293
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,878
No. I finished it at lunch.

294
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:05,361
Our father taught Janie and I
how to play chess.

295
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,538
He always said... Chess sharpens the mind?

296
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:13,021
I don't remember my Grandpa but
my Mom says the same thing.

297
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,024
What colour do you like?

298
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,766
I usually play white
with my Mom.

299
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,247
I like black.

300
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,571
Jane?

301
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:44,444
Jane?

302
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,423
You kinda spaced out there
a little bit.

303
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:49,057
I'm sorry Phil.

304
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,592
What are you doing in here?

305
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,205
Just getting a glass of water.

306
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,599
I left a bottle in your room.

307
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,297
Oh, I didn't see it.

308
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:57,647
Is there anything else
I can get you?

309
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:59,388
No.

310
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,478
Sweet dreams, Janie.

311
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,992
There's been a homicide!

312
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,908
Yes, I'm the one that
found them.

313
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:44,955
Rydert. Officer Jane Rydert.

314
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:50,134
No, I think
she's still breathing.

315
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:54,225
Yes, I'll wait here.

316
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,417
Jane?

317
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,776
Hey. Any particular reason why
you slept down here last night?

318
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,075
Yes.

319
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,772
Cass was in the kitchen
last night.

320
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,339
So? Maybe she was hungry.

321
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,601
Shhh. Keep your voice down.

322
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:06,820
She's not here.

323
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,256
She left at the crack of dawn.

324
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:11,128
Said she had some things
to take care of.

325
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:13,261
Any reason why you put
the armchair over here?

326
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,437
Yes. So I could see the room.

327
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,677
Are you alright Jane? Yes, I'm fine Phil.

328
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,660
Something just doesn't jive.

329
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:23,227
I've had regular phone calls

330
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:26,274
with her psychiatrist for years
and never once did Dr. Gershman

331
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,711
indicate discharging her
was a possibility.

332
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,279
I remember specifically
discussing her mood swings

333
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,934
and memory lapses
on our last call.

334
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:37,633
She's had a fair bit of shock
treatment and memory loss is common.

335
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,592
Well, that's a big improvement.
Amnesia.

336
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,985
No, most of their
memories return.

337
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:43,632
Except for the days
and weeks leading up

338
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:48,165
to their first treatment
which often stays lost.

339
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,080
Cass doesn't have a clue
what happened

340
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,995
the entire two weeks
before hers.

341
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:58,741
I gotta get moving, I have an
appointment at Cass' hospital.

342
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,315
Then who would have authorized
my sister's discharge?

343
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,427
I did.

344
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,124
At the recommendation

345
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:35,125
of our hospital's
psychiatric review board.

346
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:37,737
Well Dr. Schwarztien,

347
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:39,303
my sister hasn't
been well enough

348
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,784
to leave this hospital
for 15 years.

349
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:43,960
Dr. Gershman must have
informed you.

350
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:48,095
Dr. Gershman's retirement wasn't
anticipated. He had a stroke.

351
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,227
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.

352
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,752
Yes, it was almost completely
debilitating.

353
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,971
Just a moment.

354
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:59,193
Um. Ah here we go. "Now, it is the
unanimous opinion of this review board

355
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,457
"that Cassidy Laurel Rydert
presents no further threat

356
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,981
"to herself, her family
or the general public.

357
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:07,046
"It's recommended that she be
reintegrated into society"

358
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,421
"at the earliest available
opportunity."

359
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,511
This was six and a half
weeks ago.

360
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:16,427
No disrespect Dr. Schwarztien.

361
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,691
Have you read my sister's file?

362
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,478
Sergeant, I'll admit I am still
playing catch up.

363
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,175
Dr. Gershman, he was
with this hospital

364
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:27,308
for over 33 years and his

365
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:29,919
caseload was massive.
But you can rest assured,

366
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:32,574
I have reviewed every single
one his files.

367
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,316
Now, it's true, Cassidy
has had her difficulties.

368
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:38,493
But she is responding well
to this new medication.

369
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,016
Provided she continues with it,

370
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,453
I am confident her issues can

371
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,454
be maintained as an outpatient.

372
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,935
So, that's it.

373
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,459
You know, this re-entry period,

374
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,201
it can be challenging
for families.

375
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,508
Here we go.

376
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,772
Your sister is ready
to re-enter society.

377
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,126
I hope you're right, Doctor.

378
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,932
You crack me up, Em.

379
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,935
Bonus, Mr. Hottie's here!

380
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:37,552
Oh, no! What do I say?

381
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,641
How about, "Take me! I'm yours!"

382
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:40,729
Shut up! He'll hear you!

383
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,992
Hear what?

384
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,298
W'sup Emily?

385
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:45,865
Hi!

386
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,518
I thought you graduated?

387
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,520
Last June.

388
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,976
One of my old teachers invited
me in to give his art class

389
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,306
a kick in the butt.

390
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:54,047
Inspirational speech, wake up,

391
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:56,789
sky's the limit, paint the moon.

392
00:26:56,876 --> 00:27:00,096
So. Emily.

393
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:02,063
What's it going to take
to get you in that pool?

394
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:03,926
You know, you're making me
look bad.

395
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:05,512
It's bad for my rep
when one of my students

396
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,929
won't trust me to get
her toes wet.

397
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,888
My boss has been asking.

398
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,238
I've been telling her that
for weeks.

399
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:12,848
I'll try harder.

400
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:13,806
Next lesson.

401
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:14,981
Yeah?

402
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:16,809
Yeah.

403
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,201
Next lesson.

404
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:27,123
He's so into you!

405
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,124
Really?

406
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:29,604
You think he likes me?

407
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,214
Oh no, he wants
to hook up with me

408
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,941
but he can't unglue
his eyeballs from you.

409
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:37,786
Hi.

410
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,048
Emily.

411
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:45,141
Tina, this is my Mom's sister
I was telling you about.

412
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,969
Cassidy.

413
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,798
Hey.Hello.

414
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,018
Are you coming from somewhere?

415
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:54,194
No, just out for a walk.

416
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,586
You?

417
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,074
This is the way we always
walk home.

418
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,112
My school's back there.

419
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,903
Well, we gotta go.

420
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,472
Enjoy your walk, Cassidy.

421
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,131
She does seem kinda weird.

422
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:19,567
I know, right?

423
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:24,137
Just gotta make a quick stop,
Vic.

424
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:28,837
Girls like a ride home?

425
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:32,145
Seriously? In that?

426
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:33,494
Mom? What's wrong?

427
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:35,322
Nothing! Yes or no?

428
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:36,889
You're working, aren't you?

429
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,586
Hop in if you're coming.

430
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:58,432
Hey, Em. I almost forgot.

431
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:02,218
Awesome!

432
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,655
Sweet! Thanks!

433
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:08,616
What happened to 'unnecessary
teenage excess'?

434
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:11,010
Well, you're a 15 year old
girl walking home after dark.

435
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:12,359
You need a phone.

436
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:16,319
Well don't get too excited.

437
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,539
It's just for emergencies, okay?

438
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,497
Put your number in. Yeah.

439
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:28,636
Bye! Thanks for the ride!

440
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:29,723
Love you!

441
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,768
Love you too!

442
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:34,947
Drive your kid home often?

443
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,209
In the vehicle? No.

444
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,298
Rarely if ever.

445
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:02,496
Oh.

446
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,454
I didn't see you come in.

447
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,153
No, well you were reading,
I didn't want to disturb you.

448
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,763
You looking for something?

449
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,288
No. I um, I just took
a wrong turn.

450
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,074
You're down there.

451
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:02,817
Oh.

452
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:05,037
I didn't see you there.

453
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,475
I came to see your room.

454
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:11,870
Yeah. It's cozy.

455
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,138
That's for my behavioral
therapy.

456
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:21,227
To desensitize me.

457
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:24,273
I've been afraid of water
as long as I can remember.

458
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:26,101
I don't know why.

459
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:29,061
I have a fear of drowning.

460
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,932
Does it work?

461
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,369
Yeah, sorta. I guess.

462
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:34,805
Don't you like to swim?

463
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:36,633
Uh uh.

464
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Not at all?

465
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:39,462
I can't swim.

466
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,464
I used to be scared
of these pictures.

467
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:50,996
Why were you in the hospital?

468
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:54,956
I had a breakdown.

469
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:00,788
Was it hard to get through it?

470
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:06,533
I bought you something.

471
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:09,362
My nirvana.

472
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:14,019
I don't 'really have
a CD player either?

473
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:17,283
I just use this and
it doesn't play CD's.

474
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,465
What's happening here?

475
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:28,076
Why are you home so early?

476
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,556
Uh...

477
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:32,907
quiet night.

478
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:33,994
Mom, look!

479
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,736
Cassidy got me a present.

480
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,260
Have you ever heard
of My nirvana?

481
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,960
Where'd you get
the money for this?

482
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:45,224
Doctor Schwarztien helped me
re-access my bank accounts.

483
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:48,444
They do that when
they discharge patients.

484
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,926
Well, um I'll keep it in my car.

485
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,146
Our CD player in there
still works.

486
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,373
Why did you have to take it
from me?

487
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,636
Well you can't play this
on your tablet.

488
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:12,294
Emily.

489
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:17,125
I cut my sister out of my life
for a good reason.

490
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:18,518
What good reason?

491
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,694
Cassidy is mentally unstable.

492
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,000
Like me.

493
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:23,523
No! Not like you.

494
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,177
Why would you say such a thing?

495
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:27,744
You're aqua-phobic.
You'll overcome that.

496
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,530
She has much more
serious issues.

497
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:32,923
What are her issues?

498
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,795
She's horribly impulsive

499
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:38,581
and she hurts the people
she's supposed to love.

500
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:40,888
Is that why you told me
she died in the car accident

501
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:42,020
with my Dad?

502
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,457
Yeah.

503
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:49,810
What are you writing about?

504
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,378
School stuff.

505
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:53,901
Doodles.

506
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:57,687
Why are there hearts
all over this paper?

507
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:02,170
Because that's all I know
how to draw.

508
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:06,435
You may just learn to swim
after all!

509
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,721
Just making myself something
to eat.

510
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,897
Can I get you anything?

511
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:37,597
I'm taking her with me Janie.

512
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,689
Don't be ridiculous.

513
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,760
Something wrong? No.

514
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,854
Where's Emily's photo?

515
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,032
Your sister was in here earlier.

516
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,210
But I doubt she would scoop up
Em's photo without asking.

517
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:27,342
What was Cassidy doing in here?

518
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:29,692
She got lost, apparently.

519
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:39,702
Try to relax.

520
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,008
I can't.

521
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,982
Try to get some sleep.

522
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:19,177
You ready for coffee?

523
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:27,097
I have honey oats and
wheat squares cereal.

524
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,670
Oh, um, a few of these
look really decent.

525
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,335
Okay. I'll pour your cereal.

526
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,209
You and I both know that Emily
is better off here.

527
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:52,993
You're not equipped
to take that on.

528
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,387
Teenagers are a lot of work.

529
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,869
If you want, I'll actually
come and look at

530
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:02,089
some of those apartments
with you later.

531
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,396
Um.

532
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,001
Do you have to do this now?

533
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,351
I'm studying for my midterms.

534
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,309
Oh I'm done.

535
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,051
Em suddenly decided
to lock her door?

536
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:53,738
Well you know teenagers. They like
to have their privacy respected.

537
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,274
Did you get any sleep?

538
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:59,189
I have to run.

539
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,583
I'll see you tonight.

540
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,043
Cass. What are you doing here?

541
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,828
Decided to take you up
on your offer.

542
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,221
To look at apartments together?

543
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,135
I'm at work.

544
00:38:32,222 --> 00:38:33,222
We can talk about

545
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:34,616
that tonight. Go home.

546
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,054
Didn't mean to embarrass you.

547
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:42,581
Nice to have met you.

548
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:50,110
Sorry, Vic.
My sister is staying with me

549
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,808
and she gets a bit
over enthusiastic.

550
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,419
Seems enthusiastic.

551
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:56,464
Walked right in, started
asking me and everybody

552
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,815
where does Jane Rydert sit and
Captain asked me to take her outside.

553
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,948
I'm sorry. I hope she
didn't talk your ear off.

554
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:03,471
No, no just chatty.

555
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:06,735
She seems uh, attractive.

556
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,084
She single?

557
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:10,609
Trust me, you don't want
to go there.

558
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,175
No? No.

559
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:36,286
What's wrong? Where's Emily?

560
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,679
What is that?

561
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:39,768
It's a baby monitor.

562
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,249
I know what it is.
Why is it here?

563
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,948
So I can hear if Emily has a
nightmare before she panics.

564
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,038
It was collecting dust up
in the attic.

565
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,131
You actually think
that we're going to sleep

566
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:56,916
with this here every night?

567
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:00,876
Well, millions
of parents do, Phil.

568
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,312
Yeah. For their babies.

569
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,839
Listen. Enough already, Jane.

570
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,103
I want the truth, Jane.

571
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:29,601
What am I looking at here?

572
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:34,954
Cass isn't bipolar, Phil.

573
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:38,784
She has what's called a
borderline personality.

574
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:46,618
Her sense of herself is
distorted and unstable.

575
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,750
Her emotions turn on a dime.

576
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:53,755
She overreacts sometimes
to happiness or sadness

577
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,540
or frustration.

578
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,196
You're telling me your sister
did all this?

579
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:02,721
Oh my god.

580
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:05,245
Who is this guy?

581
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:06,942
Her husband, Brian.

582
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:14,210
He was at the academy with me
and he was a good cop.

583
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:16,909
A good husband.

584
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:21,914
He was bathing their
three month old baby.

585
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:24,482
And she just snapped?

586
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:27,441
She said she was tired
of being a mother.

587
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:28,790
A wife.

588
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,751
The doctor at the trial,

589
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:36,755
said that she was in
postpartum psychosis.

590
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,191
She looks dead.

591
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:41,020
Yeah, she's lucky she missed
her heart.

592
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:44,806
Please tell me she didn't shoot
her baby.

593
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,899
Emily is Cassidy's daughter,
Phil.

594
00:41:57,906 --> 00:42:02,781
Brian let go of her
when Cassidy shot him

595
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,349
and she slipped into the water.

596
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,834
She would have drowned
if I wasn't there.

597
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:27,980
I don't even know
where to start.

598
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:30,896
My Mom was afraid of Cass.

599
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:34,421
I could see it in her eyes
when she was around her.

600
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,510
So it made me afraid.

601
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,469
My father couldn't see it.

602
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,603
Cass is spunkier than Jane,
he'd tell Mom.

603
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,475
You know I'm gonna find
you Janie.

604
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:49,697
Cassidy's mood swung
from over-ecstatic joy

605
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:54,180
to angry outbursts when she
didn't get what she wanted.

606
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,183
And what she wanted was
anything that was mine.

607
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:00,055
My mother gave me a doll
for my birthday.

608
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,145
Cass didn't understand
why she didn't get one.

609
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:05,757
It's my doll! No!

610
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:07,323
Give me it!

611
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:12,067
Serves you right for not giving
her to me in the first place.

612
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:19,074
If I tattled on her she promised to tell
the kids at school that I wet my bed.

613
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:24,079
Or burn down our farmhouse
with me and my Mom inside.

614
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:28,606
So at 18 I escaped
to the police academy.

615
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:31,609
But she found me.

616
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:36,439
Hey Jane. Jane Rydert.

617
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:38,398
Hey! Brian! Hi!

618
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:40,618
I want to introduce you
to my new wife.

619
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:42,707
We just had a baby!

620
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:45,187
Surprise! Cass!

621
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:48,190
What are the chances huh? Girl of my
dreams turns out to be your sister?

622
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:50,410
I mean, right?

623
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:52,499
I missed you, Janie. Missed you.

624
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:58,810
Cass was softer and not so erratic
and mean. She had just had Emily.

625
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,813
Motherhood seems
to agree with you.

626
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,337
Oh I love being a new Mommy.

627
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:06,165
And wife.

628
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:07,383
Yes you do.

629
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,820
You need to try it, Janie.

630
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah.

631
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:14,086
I decided to forgive my sister,

632
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:17,045
so we started hanging
out together.

633
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:19,134
I'd go for dinner with them
once a week,

634
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:22,094
and I'd babysit Emily if
they wanted a night out.

635
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:25,140
I learned that Cass'
nicer personality

636
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:28,970
was due to medication,
but it didn't last.

637
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:33,453
Brian said it was like
somebody had flipped a switch

638
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,064
and the girl he married
was gone.

639
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,763
Cass' doctor told him
Cass was suffering

640
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,463
from postpartum depression and
prescribed anti-depressants.

641
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,465
But I recognized my sister.

642
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:47,989
Cass, I think you've had enough.

643
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:51,863
Just get over it.

644
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,346
Brian.

645
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,479
Why don't you take Emily
for a bath?

646
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:01,394
Yeah.

647
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,051
Hey come and see daddy.

648
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:07,705
There she is.

649
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:12,144
Go easy, huh?

650
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,190
Come on.

651
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:20,630
God, I hate it
when he gets like this.

652
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,893
Like what?

653
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,460
All dewy-eyed with concern

654
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:26,071
and responsibility,

655
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,029
like he's husband
or father of the year.

656
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:31,076
Brian's mad that I stopped
breastfeeding.

657
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:32,773
I want my body back.

658
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:43,262
Maybe they'll both go
down the drain.

659
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,443
Oh what, Jane?

660
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,010
Don't give me that look.

661
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:55,143
They have strangled the life
out of me.

662
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,797
Do you understand that?

663
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:02,498
You're drunk.

664
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:04,718
You know you shouldn't
be drinking

665
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:07,068
with the medication
that you're taking.

666
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:08,896
Just go to hell, Jane.

667
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:22,083
I've been too ashamed
to tell anyone.

668
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,828
She almost drowned.

669
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,874
And that's why
she has nightmares.

670
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:34,879
She was 3 years old when she
told me about the first one.

671
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:47,239
And I was afraid to tell her

672
00:46:47,326 --> 00:46:50,329
because I thought she'd think
she inherited what Cass has.

673
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:51,721
Oh, come here.

674
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,813
Cassidy wants her back, Phil.

675
00:46:57,945 --> 00:47:00,339
What if she gets tired
of her again?

676
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:20,359
Look, look Jane!

677
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:45,732
Oh, you're still awake!

678
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:46,951
I can't sleep.

679
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:50,302
Did you see the lock
on the door?

680
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:52,086
Oh, yeah.

681
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,175
Phil said you wanted me
to use it but I forgot.

682
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:57,178
Yeah, there's been several
break-ins in the neighbourhood.

683
00:47:57,265 --> 00:47:59,877
Nothing to be alarmed about
just makes us one step safer

684
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:01,593
in case someone tries
to get in the house.

685
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:03,315
We're putting a lock
on ours too.

686
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:07,319
Oh and that key is
for the outside lock

687
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:09,340
and you can put it on your
house-key on that okay?

688
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:10,539
I'll lock it once you go.

689
00:48:10,626 --> 00:48:11,671
Oh and one more thing.

690
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:15,153
Check in with me more during
the day, alright?

691
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,285
You don't have to wait
for me to call you.

692
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:19,113
I will pay the bill.

693
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:20,854
Okay.

694
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:23,901
Goodnight, sweetie.Night.

695
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,863
Shhh.

696
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:17,476
I heard you from my room.
You were having a nightmare.

697
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:21,654
How did you get in my room?

698
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:23,308
I locked my door.

699
00:49:24,265 --> 00:49:25,397
I know.

700
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:26,746
I tried that first.

701
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:32,839
I didn't mean to scare you.

702
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:39,106
I scare easily.

703
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:45,069
I'm sorry I couldn't play
your CD.

704
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,595
It wasn't the right gift.

705
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,474
Why does my Mom say
you've hurt people?

706
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:04,697
She blames me for things
that weren't my fault.

707
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,483
How did you know what it was?

708
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,010
Your breakdown?

709
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,577
What did it feel like?

710
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:22,019
What do you see
in your nightmares?

711
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:25,805
It's always the same one.

712
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:31,724
I'm in a lake or pond,
I don't know which.

713
00:50:32,377 --> 00:50:35,293
But I'm under water,
I can't breathe.

714
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:38,513
There's this horrible
roaring sound.

715
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,907
Somebody's whistling.

716
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:43,605
I can see the surface

717
00:50:43,692 --> 00:50:46,739
and I know I should go
up there but I can't.

718
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:49,089
I think my head's too heavy.

719
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:52,571
I wake up before I drown.

720
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,318
I can make your nightmares
go away.

721
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,234
You can?

722
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:06,585
But you have to trust me.

723
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,680
Get some sleep, okay?

724
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,498
Oh! It's a beautiful day;

725
00:51:50,585 --> 00:51:52,225
you should get out
and get some fresh air!

726
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:08,951
Hello? Good morning!

727
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:35,717
Well, it's hard to believe
we have to put steel bars

728
00:52:35,804 --> 00:52:37,502
on our windows in
this neighbourhood.

729
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,332
Jane, can you help me
with this please?

730
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:43,812
I don't even know why I have
to wear one of these things.

731
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:45,814
Why are you doing this?

732
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:47,990
Because Cass won't
leave Emily alone.

733
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:49,818
She snuck in her window
last night.

734
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:51,820
Jane, you're really starting
to worry me.

735
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:53,822
Have you tried to talk to her
about this?

736
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,215
How much is all this costing?

737
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:57,174
I don't care.
It's keeping Emily safe.

738
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,264
Damn.

739
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:02,151
I'm late for my appointment
at the university.

740
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:04,268
Okay.

741
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:05,878
Go.

742
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:07,488
Alright I'll see you tonight.

743
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:49,922
That's it!

744
00:53:50,009 --> 00:53:51,967
I know you can do this, Emily.

745
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:57,103
You're doing great, Emily.

746
00:54:01,063 --> 00:54:02,978
Come on, Emily. You can do it.

747
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,589
Emily.

748
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:05,938
Emily look at me.

749
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:10,899
You can do this. Just take
one more step Emily. Please.

750
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:18,820
One step.

751
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:34,662
Emily!

752
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:35,794
Emily!

753
00:54:35,881 --> 00:54:37,622
Emily, put your feet down!

754
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:39,101
Emily!!!

755
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,455
I got ya, I got ya.

756
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:46,631
You're alright. You're alright.

757
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:49,764
You okay?

758
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,596
Sorry I'm such a nutcase.

759
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:57,903
You shouldn't say stuff
like that.

760
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,558
It reinforces a negative image
of yourself.

761
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:03,082
You weren't ready
and I pushed you.

762
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:06,955
He wouldn't let me help you
any sooner.

763
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:10,176
It's okay.

764
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:11,786
I understand.

765
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,311
I'll run my own classes
next year.

766
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,316
Do you take a lot
of those sedatives?

767
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:22,623
Only when I have to.

768
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:28,412
Thanks for walking me home,
Josh.

769
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:32,329
Really. Thanks for letting me.

770
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:34,679
I really hope you come back.

771
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:47,082
I have a cell phone now.

772
00:55:47,779 --> 00:55:49,520
You should call and remind me.

773
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:50,912
Cool.

774
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,393
So what happened?

775
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,742
I held hands with him!

776
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:56,353
Get out! Oh, my God!

777
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,320
Don't leave out any details!
Tell me everything.

778
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:02,707
Uh. Hang on, Tina.

779
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:04,665
Hi!

780
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,320
Do you need something?

781
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:09,975
Will you go for a walk with me?

782
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:11,062
Now?

783
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:15,589
Tina, I'll call you later.

784
00:56:25,294 --> 00:56:26,818
I thought you didn't smoke.

785
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:31,823
You know, I'm a pretty
good listener.

786
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:35,696
Would be better than doing that.

787
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:57,414
It's a stressful situation.

788
00:56:58,153 --> 00:57:00,982
She stays, I worry about Emily.

789
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:04,421
If she finds her own place, I
worry about the rest of Ridgewood.

790
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:09,991
She's not that bad.
I mean, she's a little odd.

791
00:57:10,078 --> 00:57:11,863
But pleasant enough.

792
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,710
Maybe those doctors
know more than you think.

793
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:19,174
I mean 15 years is a lot
of therapy.

794
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:21,568
Yeah.

795
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:24,266
Well you and I both know
the stats, Vic.

796
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:28,401
75 percent of mentally
disordered prison transfers

797
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,664
are rearrested within 5 years.

798
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:33,711
Yeah.

799
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:37,584
Thanks for the coffee.

800
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:45,200
How am I doing?

801
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:47,638
You're walking on water.

802
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:51,685
It's not terrible
if I don't look.

803
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:55,515
Why didn't you want me
to tell Phil we were going?

804
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:57,517
I didn't want him to stop us.

805
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:00,041
Yeah.

806
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:03,349
My Mom's been acting
so weird since you came.

807
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:09,224
This bridge is beautiful.

808
00:58:10,748 --> 00:58:12,445
I've always been afraid of it.

809
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:16,188
People have driven off
this bridge in the past.

810
00:58:17,145 --> 00:58:20,279
They don't see the reversible
lane meter change.

811
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:23,848
Suddenly all this traffic's
coming straight at them.

812
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:28,809
A boy from my high school
rode his bike off here.

813
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:33,248
They said he did it because
he was failing school

814
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:35,424
and didn't want his
parents finding out.

815
00:58:36,774 --> 00:58:38,036
Emily.

816
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,780
You ever think about suicide?

817
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:45,260
No.

818
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,177
Maybe once in awhile.

819
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:53,617
Tina's mom says lots of
teenagers think about it.

820
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:55,619
She says we don't have
the life experience

821
00:58:55,706 --> 00:58:57,490
to tell us things
can get better.

822
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,058
Have you ever thought about it?

823
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,366
In the hospital.

824
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,636
I think it would be like going
to sleep.

825
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:16,857
All your problems
would just float away.

826
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,319
I'm with you, I think
it's overkill.

827
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:30,017
I mean, you need a ladder
to get up here already.

828
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:33,586
Why is she doing this?
I asked Tina's Mom

829
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:36,720
and she said she's too young for menopause.
It's freaking me out.

830
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:39,852
Hi.

831
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,378
Um, I got you something,

832
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:45,729
as a thank you for letting me
stay here.

833
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:49,167
Hope you like it as much
as chocolate cake.

834
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,431
Yeah, that's very kind Cassidy.

835
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:56,478
Got myself this purse

836
01:00:56,565 --> 01:00:57,479
down at the second-hand
store downtown.

837
01:00:57,566 --> 01:00:58,872
It's nice.

838
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:04,233
Would you mind giving
this to Janie?

839
01:01:04,312 --> 01:01:06,010
I had it framed for her.

840
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:08,926
Think she can put it
on her nightstand.

841
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,017
It's us, on our farm.

842
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:14,627
I'll give it to her.

843
01:01:37,955 --> 01:01:39,347
Were you on the bridge today?

844
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:43,264
It's a simple question.

845
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:46,093
Why do I feel like I'm being
interrogated then?

846
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,583
And what's with those steel
bars on the windows?

847
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:49,923
For security.

848
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,013
It's like you're turning into
one of those crazy preppers.

849
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:55,363
And how did you know
I was on the bridge?

850
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,365
Because I drove by
and I saw you.

851
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:03,328
Cassidy invited me out
for a walk.

852
01:02:04,372 --> 01:02:06,157
She's helping me get used
to water.

853
01:02:07,462 --> 01:02:09,247
I walked across the bridge, Mom.

854
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:12,163
That's wonderful!

855
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:17,995
Emily, I know you like Cassidy.

856
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,346
It's just.

857
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:26,090
She's not capable of giving you
the relationship you're hoping for

858
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,094
and I don't want to see you get
hurt by her.

859
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:33,837
Okay?

860
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:56,250
Wait Daddy! Wait!

861
01:02:59,601 --> 01:03:00,689
Wait!

862
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,039
Go home, Janie.

863
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:03,605
Daddy, stop!

864
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:06,739
I'm telling on you! No you're not!

865
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:08,412
You pulled the head off
my doll on purpose!

866
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:10,656
Did not! Dad won't believe you!

867
01:03:10,743 --> 01:03:15,748
Dad! Cassidy made Mom fall so
she could see you shoot him!

868
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:17,968
No!

869
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:45,996
You okay to drive?

870
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,475
I'm fine.

871
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:49,477
I just need another cup
of coffee.

872
01:03:51,175 --> 01:03:53,090
Oh gosh.

873
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:55,832
Woah woah woah.
Watch out! Watch out!!!

874
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,572
Stop the car!

875
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:11,543
You can kill yourself
on your own time

876
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,284
but you are not taking me
with you.

877
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:24,686
Cassidy likes my Mom
but Mom doesn't trust her

878
01:04:24,773 --> 01:04:26,099
because she was mean
when they were kids

879
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:28,429
and now Mom can't get over it.

880
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,170
I thought my little brother
held a grudge.

881
01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:33,173
Like they can be over it
in whatever, 5 or 10 years.

882
01:04:34,522 --> 01:04:35,959
Speak of the devil.

883
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,657
Hi! Where are you going?

884
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:40,572
I've got a plan for us!

885
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:42,661
But I gotta be quick
or its gonna close.

886
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:45,707
She's actually nice.

887
01:04:45,794 --> 01:04:48,623
Strange, but in a nice way.

888
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:50,408
You coming in?

889
01:04:50,495 --> 01:04:51,626
Ok.

890
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,586
Sir. You reporting?

891
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:40,545
Yes sir. Is that a fact?

892
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,895
Rydert.

893
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:45,593
In my office.

894
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:53,210
Something's obviously bothering
you, Jane.

895
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:55,777
I'd let it go,

896
01:05:56,778 --> 01:05:58,824
but it's affecting
your judgement now.

897
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:03,133
You've been ducking out early,
not handing in reports,

898
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,786
distracted on duty.

899
01:06:04,873 --> 01:06:06,416
The other day a woman
called in a report.

900
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,312
She saw you picking
up your daughter

901
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:11,445
and her girlfriend in your vehicle.
Oh, well I can explain that.

902
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:13,534
We were... Listen. Gossiping's
a national pastime

903
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:15,145
and this department
is a prime target.

904
01:06:15,232 --> 01:06:17,495
You know that.
Ridgewood is a small town.

905
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,286
Whatever it is, go fix it.

906
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:30,247
Dr. Kim McMaster?

907
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:31,770
The department psychotherapist.

908
01:06:31,857 --> 01:06:34,512
Look, Captain, I don't
need a shrink.

909
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:37,732
My sister's staying... Like I
said, I'm not the one to talk to.

910
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:39,821
That's an order, Sergeant.

911
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:55,359
Can I help you?

912
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,144
Yeah.

913
01:06:58,231 --> 01:06:59,339
I'm looking for a place to go

914
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:01,017
camping with my daughter.

915
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:03,932
Maybe something
with a lake. Private.

916
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:07,893
Storm Lake's quiet this time
of year.

917
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,677
Nobody's up there yet.

918
01:07:10,374 --> 01:07:12,724
Picnic tables and fire pits
are all out though.

919
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:14,378
Is it far?

920
01:07:14,465 --> 01:07:16,554
Well you want to go off
the No. 5 about 40 miles.

921
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:17,661
Get off at the south entrance.

922
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:18,947
The north end isn't safe.

923
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,123
Undercurrents.

924
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,907
Undercurrents? Yes ma'am.

925
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:24,388
They're unpredictable.
The north end of the lake

926
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,303
isn't safe for swimming
this time of the year.

927
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,174
You'll be fine everywhere
else though.

928
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:32,265
That sounds perfect.

929
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:39,925
You've reached Emily Rydert. Please
leave a message or call me back.

930
01:07:40,969 --> 01:07:44,016
Emily, it's Mom.
Thank you for your message.

931
01:07:44,712 --> 01:07:46,888
Thanks for checking in.

932
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:49,978
It was late getting out
of there. How'd it go?

933
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,635
Doctor thinks I'm projecting my
fear of losing Emily on Cass.

934
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:56,681
How were your exams today?

935
01:07:56,768 --> 01:07:58,422
Good, I think.

936
01:07:59,423 --> 01:08:02,252
Was Cass at the house
when you left?

937
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:05,603
No. She had a driver's exam
to get her license restored.

938
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:06,952
Oh, which reminds me.

939
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,439
I meant to give you this
last night.

940
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:10,608
She said she had it made
for you.

941
01:08:10,695 --> 01:08:11,957
Sweet, huh?

942
01:08:12,914 --> 01:08:14,525
She gave me a chocolate bar.

943
01:08:15,482 --> 01:08:18,137
She's trying to drive a wedge
between us, Phil.

944
01:08:18,224 --> 01:08:19,573
Jane, it's a photo.

945
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,488
To say thank you
for letting her stay.

946
01:08:21,575 --> 01:08:23,490
She needs you and Emily
on her side

947
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:25,362
for whatever she's planning.

948
01:08:27,364 --> 01:08:28,582
What do you feel like eating?

949
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:30,497
Sushi? Italian? Greek?

950
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:32,891
You don't believe
what I told you.

951
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:34,818
I do believe you.
What if she's getting better?

952
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:37,287
Postpartum depression
isn't permanent.

953
01:08:37,374 --> 01:08:38,592
What about when I was a kid?

954
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:39,898
Listen. Em's getting older.

955
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:41,726
She's about to go away
to college.

956
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:44,424
You can't protect her forever.
What are you saying?

957
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:46,402
I'm saying you've raised her,
nothing's going to change that.

958
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:47,949
Even if she has to live

959
01:08:48,036 --> 01:08:50,038
with her biological
mother for a while.

960
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,692
Yeah but Cassidy doesn't Emily.

961
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:55,783
It's a game and if she wins,
Emily's disposable.

962
01:09:12,104 --> 01:09:14,802
You want me to make you
a sandwich?

963
01:09:57,802 --> 01:09:59,847
I've never seen you
pay attention to those.

964
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,936
Oh, yeah.

965
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:04,983
Oh I am so hungry.

966
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,419
Thank you.

967
01:10:25,699 --> 01:10:28,615
Wasn't necessary but thank you
for the photo of the two of us.

968
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,836
And you can keep the school
photo of Emily.

969
01:10:31,923 --> 01:10:34,099
I'll just have another one made
for me.

970
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:37,145
I have something for you.

971
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:44,283
It's not exactly an olive
branch, but uh...

972
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:51,421
It's not real gold.
Sorry about that.

973
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:55,381
See you tonight, okay?

974
01:11:13,138 --> 01:11:16,359
Rydert! In here.

975
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:29,850
Hi.

976
01:11:32,113 --> 01:11:33,724
Your gun and your badge,
Sergeant.

977
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:36,727
You're on medical leave,
effective immediately.

978
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:38,468
Medical leave? Why?

979
01:11:38,555 --> 01:11:40,513
I went to see Kim McMaster
just like you said.

980
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,212
You used a GPS tracker to keep tabs
on a civilian without a warrant.

981
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,606
You used audio-visual
surveillance equipment

982
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:50,044
to spy on that same civilian
in your house.

983
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:52,743
We're lucky your sister
doesn't want to lodge

984
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:53,918
an official complaint.

985
01:11:54,005 --> 01:11:55,136
Now that is the only reason

986
01:11:55,223 --> 01:11:56,616
I'm not suspending you.

987
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:58,812
Apart from the fact GPS
tracking a private citizen

988
01:11:58,836 --> 01:12:00,794
violates the 4th amendment.

989
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:02,753
And intercepting
audio communication

990
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,930
is a 3rd degree felony.
You were not authorized by me

991
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:08,280
to use any of these
surveillance devices.

992
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:09,847
I was going to bring them back.

993
01:12:11,022 --> 01:12:12,284
Jane.

994
01:12:12,806 --> 01:12:14,112
I like you.

995
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:16,897
I know you're having
personal problems.

996
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,596
But you have no use to me
in your present condition.

997
01:12:19,683 --> 01:12:20,945
Take the leave.

998
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,215
Keys to the vehicle.

999
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:40,312
Monroe, get in here.
I can take myself home.

1000
01:13:02,029 --> 01:13:04,858
Where you going? Cassidy's
coming to get me.

1001
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:06,338
We're going camping.

1002
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:07,576
And you weren't going
to tell me?

1003
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,036
I knew you wouldn't let me go.

1004
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:11,604
Well I'm definitely
not letting you go, now.

1005
01:13:12,953 --> 01:13:14,433
Give it back. It's not yours.

1006
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,261
No, you listen to me, Emily.

1007
01:13:16,348 --> 01:13:18,306
Cassidy is not
who you think she is.

1008
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,005
She cannot manage
for an entire weekend.

1009
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:22,572
I don't believe you.

1010
01:13:22,659 --> 01:13:24,245
She's rented a car,
picked out our campsite,

1011
01:13:24,269 --> 01:13:25,705
bought food and everything.

1012
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:29,056
I am forbidding you to go.

1013
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:30,406
You can't.

1014
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:32,103
I'm 15 and I have a right

1015
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:33,365
to go camping with my aunt.

1016
01:13:33,757 --> 01:13:35,236
I like being with Cassidy.

1017
01:13:35,323 --> 01:13:37,064
She treats me like an adult.

1018
01:13:38,936 --> 01:13:40,024
You ready?

1019
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:44,115
You are not taking that child

1020
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:46,596
out into the woods unsupervised.

1021
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:49,729
It looks to me like I am,
Jane. No, you're not!!

1022
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:51,775
Emily listen to me. No, I'm going.

1023
01:13:52,863 --> 01:13:53,994
Emily!!!!!!!

1024
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:56,519
Emily please. Open the door.

1025
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:58,259
No, I'm going. Stop!

1026
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:00,218
Emily!

1027
01:14:26,157 --> 01:14:29,073
Oh come on. Come on.

1028
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,430
Oh, hey.

1029
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:40,737
Just came by to make sure
you got home.

1030
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:42,956
It's not a very good time
right now, Vic.

1031
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:45,916
Understood.

1032
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:51,182
Uh.

1033
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:55,447
On second thought.

1034
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:05,588
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1035
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:07,764
Yeah sure.
That'd be great, thanks.

1036
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,114
Phil's working on
his midterm today

1037
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:11,942
and I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind

1038
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:13,596
taking a look at the master

1039
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:15,902
bedroom faucet.
It's been dripping.

1040
01:15:15,989 --> 01:15:18,165
Yeah sure, I'll look at it.
Great, thank you.

1041
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:23,823
Thanks for the coffee.

1042
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:26,870
Yeah.

1043
01:15:26,957 --> 01:15:28,262
Down the hall?

1044
01:15:28,349 --> 01:15:30,438
Yeah, just to the left.
Thank you!

1045
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:00,381
Jane!

1046
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:01,861
Jane!!

1047
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:13,656
Is it nice where we're going?

1048
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,922
Wow, the freeways are
a lot busier now.

1049
01:16:28,975 --> 01:16:31,021
Come on, come on! Come on.

1050
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,111
Jane. Jane where hell
are you going.

1051
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:35,242
She took Emily, Vic.

1052
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:36,722
You too my 9mm.

1053
01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:37,941
Self protection.

1054
01:16:38,028 --> 01:16:39,595
You turn around and you bring

1055
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:40,920
back that cruiser
or I am calling it in, Jane.

1056
01:16:40,944 --> 01:16:42,423
Vic, do what you have to do,

1057
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,618
okay. I'm going to get Emily.

1058
01:16:43,642 --> 01:16:45,426
My car is not fast enough.

1059
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:47,037
Jane.

1060
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:48,168
Jane!

1061
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,255
Jane!!

1062
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:56,350
I need a backup to 3076 Dollar.

1063
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:59,484
Come with me. I need your help.
Come on.

1064
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:06,230
See that bag in the back seat?

1065
01:17:07,187 --> 01:17:08,624
Look inside it.

1066
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:18,721
There's water where we're going?

1067
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,030
We're going in
the water together...

1068
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:26,206
slowly.

1069
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:46,313
Want your nightmares to go away?

1070
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:08,161
Alright.
This is where we get out.

1071
01:18:25,352 --> 01:18:26,789
Why don't you have a travel bag?

1072
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:28,486
Emily.

1073
01:18:28,573 --> 01:18:31,707
You need to trust me.
This will all be over soon.

1074
01:19:41,254 --> 01:19:43,039
Shh.

1075
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:48,000
Mom?

1076
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:49,436
Mom? What's going on?

1077
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:51,090
Why is your gun out? Mom.

1078
01:19:51,177 --> 01:19:52,918
Mom! She's trying to kill you!

1079
01:19:53,005 --> 01:19:55,268
She said she wouldn't hurt me!
Emily. Look around!

1080
01:19:55,355 --> 01:19:57,420
Why do you think she brought
you to such an isolated place?

1081
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:59,316
I brought you here so we could

1082
01:19:59,403 --> 01:20:02,101
go in the water together.
Emily, I would never hurt you.

1083
01:20:02,188 --> 01:20:03,799
Emily, I'm your mother.

1084
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:08,629
No.

1085
01:20:09,152 --> 01:20:10,980
I'm your mother.

1086
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:13,330
I'm the one that raised you
from the time you were a baby

1087
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,811
and put band aids
on your scraped knees.

1088
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:18,398
She couldn't take care of you. That's
why they took you away from her.

1089
01:20:18,422 --> 01:20:20,424
Don't listen to her Emily!

1090
01:20:20,511 --> 01:20:23,601
She was jealous because
your father loved me! Not her!

1091
01:20:23,688 --> 01:20:26,343
Tell her what happened
that night, Jane.

1092
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:28,171
Tell her what happened!

1093
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:29,563
Mom! What happened?

1094
01:20:30,913 --> 01:20:32,175
Mom!! What happened!!

1095
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:37,876
Well, I think I will take
Emily for her bath

1096
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:40,009
and give you girls
a chance to catch up.

1097
01:20:41,575 --> 01:20:43,403
And uh, cheer up, okay?

1098
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:44,927
Your sister's here.

1099
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:48,800
And slow down with the wine.

1100
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:50,846
You shouldn't be drinking
on those pills.

1101
01:21:01,552 --> 01:21:03,423
There we are.

1102
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:09,038
Say bye to mommy.

1103
01:21:11,692 --> 01:21:13,216
I love you, baby.

1104
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:26,490
Oh. This is so hard.

1105
01:21:28,057 --> 01:21:30,276
I've barely slept
since she was born.

1106
01:21:31,364 --> 01:21:33,192
I don't know how
to be a good wife

1107
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:34,802
and mother every day.

1108
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,631
You know what,
spare me the self-pity.

1109
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:40,939
You have a husband that
adores you, and a baby.

1110
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:42,506
What do I have?

1111
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:44,856
I wish I could share them
with you.

1112
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,423
And make you happy, Janie.

1113
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:48,033
I don't want your charity.

1114
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,948
Don't you understand?

1115
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:52,908
How can you complain to me?
You always got everything.

1116
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:00,567
I'm feeling dizzy.

1117
01:22:01,438 --> 01:22:03,527
Go to hell, Cass.

1118
01:22:03,614 --> 01:22:06,399
I think Brian's right, I drank
too much of this wine.

1119
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:08,967
Will you be okay out here alone

1120
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:10,621
if I just go lay down
for a little bit?

1121
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:11,927
Just go.

1122
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:22,676
Go to hell, Cass!

1123
01:22:25,462 --> 01:22:27,899
Emily she's mixing it all up.

1124
01:22:27,986 --> 01:22:29,770
I'm the one who saved your life.

1125
01:22:29,857 --> 01:22:31,381
Tell her the truth, Jane.

1126
01:22:32,425 --> 01:22:34,166
Tell our daughter the truth!

1127
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:04,631
Janie?

1128
01:23:04,718 --> 01:23:05,718
No!

1129
01:23:08,766 --> 01:23:10,420
For god's sake! You're sisters!

1130
01:23:10,507 --> 01:23:11,725
Mom!

1131
01:23:13,075 --> 01:23:16,339
No!!!!!! Stop!

1132
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:20,473
Stop!!

1133
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:23,476
No!

1134
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,968
You took away the one thing that
mattered to me after Mom died.

1135
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:39,101
Janie. Blackie slipped.

1136
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:40,537
It was an accident!

1137
01:23:40,624 --> 01:23:42,408
He broke his leg

1138
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:44,495
and we couldn't fix it!
Why can't you believe that?

1139
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:46,195
You didn't have to kill Brian.

1140
01:23:46,282 --> 01:23:48,153
Brian was supposed to love me.

1141
01:23:48,632 --> 01:23:50,112
I wouldn't have had to do this

1142
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:51,479
if you had just stayed out of my

1143
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:52,853
life like you were supposed to.

1144
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:56,814
This time I'm not going
to miss your heart.

1145
01:23:56,901 --> 01:23:58,337
Rydert!

1146
01:23:58,424 --> 01:23:59,643
Drop the weapon!

1147
01:24:03,516 --> 01:24:04,865
Easy.

1148
01:24:05,562 --> 01:24:07,912
Put it down now!

1149
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:10,480
It's over.

1150
01:24:11,394 --> 01:24:13,222
I wouldn't have had to do this

1151
01:24:13,309 --> 01:24:16,225
if you had just stayed out of my
life like you were supposed to.

1152
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:18,183
"This time I'm not going
to miss your heart."

1153
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,623
Cassidy's doctors contacted
the Portland police

1154
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:24,929
after her memory came back.

1155
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:29,499
They tracked you down here. I was
brought in from the West Division

1156
01:24:29,586 --> 01:24:31,240
to help your sister
get a confession.

1157
01:24:31,675 --> 01:24:33,807
The name's Harcroft, Jane.
Detective Harcroft.

1158
01:24:33,894 --> 01:24:35,418
No. No. Jane.

1159
01:24:35,505 --> 01:24:36,593
No.

1160
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,290
You have people here

1161
01:24:38,377 --> 01:24:40,075
who love you.
People who can help you.

1162
01:25:05,883 --> 01:25:07,754
I love you, Mom.

1163
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:44,835
Hey.

1164
01:25:45,575 --> 01:25:47,664
We're gonna get through
this, okay?

1165
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:49,840
Come here.

1166
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:52,582
Come here.

1167
01:26:07,379 --> 01:26:09,773
Can Janie try riding Blackie,
Daddy?

1168
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,209
She's not too young.

1169
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,515
Woah.

1170
01:26:12,602 --> 01:26:13,516
I thought I told you to stay

1171
01:26:13,603 --> 01:26:14,604
inside the house, Janie.

1172
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:17,824
Go on, Janie.

1173
01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:21,350
You hear me talking, girl?

1174
01:26:23,743 --> 01:26:25,615
Look, your sister's too small,
okay?

1175
01:26:25,702 --> 01:26:28,183
She can't be alone out here with
nobody watching her, alright?

1176
01:26:28,879 --> 01:26:30,097
Come on.

1177
01:26:31,273 --> 01:26:33,057
You think you're so perfect,
Cass?

1178
01:26:33,144 --> 01:26:35,407
Watch what I'm doing
to your baby.

1179
01:26:45,765 --> 01:26:47,593
I love my little sister, too.

1180
01:26:49,378 --> 01:26:51,206
It's okay.

1181
01:26:52,946 --> 01:26:54,731
Shhh.

1182
01:27:16,883 --> 01:27:18,711
I love you, Janie.

1183
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:20,626
Smile!
