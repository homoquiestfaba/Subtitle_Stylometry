00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,991
(dark eerie uneasy music)

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,383
(radio signal hissing)

4
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,403
- (Man) Now, come on, you
need to learn how to shoot.

5
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,280
- (Evie) You said Mexico was safe.

6
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,573
Why are we still here?

7
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,200
- (Man) I don't know if
Mexico is safe anymore.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,243
I don't know anywhere that's
safe anymore.

9
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,662
Not since they started
dropping bombs on us.

10
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,497
Now, come on.

11
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,166
- (Evie) I'm not gonna use that.

12
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,670
- (Man) Just do what I
tell you. Don't be afraid.

13
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,339
You'll be all right.

14
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,175
- (Evie) Killing?

15
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,723
- Listen to me, there
is nothing on this earth

16
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,936
more malicious and vile than a man.

17
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,649
You see anybody out here, you run.

18
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,028
They're not gonna help you.

19
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,073
- (Evie) What will you do?

20
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,743
- We do what we need to survive.

21
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,792
- (Evie) Is mommy in heaven

22
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:11,798
- (sighs) You need to be
able to defend yourself.

23
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,474
(soft pensive music)

24
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,451

- (Man) You don't have to worry.

72
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,677
- (Ann) Is it right what we've done?

73
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,179
- (Man) I haven't hurt anybody.

74
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,722
- (Ann) Take care of our baby.

75
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,848
- (Man) You don't have to worry.

76
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,808
- (Ann) You think we're safe here?

77
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,850

78
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,935

(truck door thuds)

91
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,432
- Well, now, if I'm not mistaken,

92
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,437
smells like you, boys
might have found yourself

93
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,397
a nice stash of coffee.

94
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,610
(lighter clicks)

95
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,906
(uneasy music)

96
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,327
You know, what really
goes well with a cigarette

97
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,329
is a good cup of coffee.

98
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,293
- It's too bad we only got three cups.

99
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,048
- Well, now that's not
very neighborly, now is it?

100
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,759
- I think he must be lost.

101
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,385
(men chuckle)
- No, no, no.

102
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,473
I know where I came from.

103
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,809
But see, thing is, I don't
really recognize you, boys.

104
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,853
Not from around here.

105
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,687
It must be pretty far away

106
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,941
from whatever hole you
crawled out of.

107
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,651
So where's your base camp at?

108
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,487
- That ain't none of your concern.

109
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,324
- Yeah, why don't you get going

110
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,077
while we're still in a good mood?

111
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,872
- Well, see, the thing is,

112
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,252
I don't really like what I see here.

113
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,462
- Shut up.

114
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,553
- So what?

115
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,516
- (Drac) Now that's a cute gun.

116
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,892
- It's a nice truck you got up there,

117
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,104
kind of unfair the three
of us have to walk.

118
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,189
- Yeah. I say we take it.

119
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,735
- (Drac) You like to take things, huh?

120
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,196
Where'd you get that one?

121
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,074
- (man in cowboy hat) Shut up.

122
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,535
- I don't have to answer to you.

123
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,870
- (Drac) Look, I know your
boys are new to this territory,

124
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,207
so I'll let you in on a little secret.

125
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,586
I'm law around here. You
understand?

126
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,045
- Law? Horseshit.

127
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,507
Ain't no law around here.

128
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,469
- (Drac) That's where you're wrong.

129
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,267
Now, am I gonna have to
correct you, boys,

130
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,812
or we're just gonna call
this a misunderstanding?

131
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,398
(uneasy music)

132
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,370
(gunshots)

133
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,917
(gunshots echo)

134
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,253
(man thuds)

135
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,257
(woman crying)

136
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,725
I got you.

137
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,227
I got you.

138
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,783
(birds chirp)

139
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,079
(melancholic reed music)

140
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,765
- You're dead.

141
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,483
Did you miss me?

142
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,818
- Of course.

143
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,821
(gentle airy music)

144
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,548
(bonfire crackling)

145
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,305
Did you get enough beans?

146
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,557
I'm gonna finish them off.

147
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,391
- Fine.

148
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,686
- Well, you can sleep out
in the woods.

149
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,565
Actually, it's not fine.

150
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,109
Because as soon as we
get into that cabin,

151
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,945
you're gonna be farting all night.

152
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,907
(chuckles) They're bad!

153
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,325
I don't want to have
to share a bed with you

154
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,535
when you eat beans.

155
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,871
- I can?

156
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,248
- Yeah, sure. Be my guest.

157
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,293
(laughs)

158
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,892
You know, it's time to move on.

159
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:53,397
I found a really nice
place. You're gonna love it.

160
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,566
A cabin right by the lake.

161
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,571
Would be a good place to spend
the winter.

162
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,410
- Did you see anyone?

163
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,164
- (Man) No.

164
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,267
- When was the last time you did?

165
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,143
- Did what?

166
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,437
- Saw someone.

167
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,817
- I don't know.

168
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,031
There's nobody else up here.
It's just us.

169
00:13:55,793 --> 00:14:00,714
- (sighs) It's cold up in these
mountains.

170
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,433
- Tell you a story.

171
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,524
There was these nuns.
They lived in Scotland.

172
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,485
And the Vikings were roaming
around,

173
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,824
killing people, raping and pillaging.

174
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,996
The nuns, they got the idea.

175
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,082
They cut their noses off, their lips.

176
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,753
That'd be so hideous.

177
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,507
Vikings would leave them alone.

178
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,262
The Vikings were disgusted.

179
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,474
They didn't leave them alone.

180
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,686
They locked them in their convent,

181
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,355
set it on fire, burned them all.

182
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,197
People like us need to hide.

183
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,369
That's why we're in these
mountains.

184
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,500
I got to keep you safe.

185
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,887
- Well, did get me anything?

186
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,223
Oh, heavy.

187
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,266
- I got you a few things.

188
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,937
I got a book, one of my favorites.

189
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,272
You can read it to me later.

190
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,494
- Make room.

191
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,206
A broad glistening muzzle
showed itself

192
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,916
above the edge of the bank,

193
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,918
and the Otter hauled himself out

194
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,795
and shook the water from his coat.

195
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,632
"Greedy beggars!" he observed,
making for the provender.

196
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,884
"Why didn't you invite me, Ratty?"

197
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,388
"This was an impromptu
affair," explained the Rat.

198
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,807
"By the way, my friend Mister Mole."

199
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,601
"Proud, I'm sure," said the Otter,

200
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:21,188
and the two animals
were friends forthwith.

201
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,277
(uneasy music)

202
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,573
- (Ann) You think we're safe here?

203
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,492
- I'm law around here.

204
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,202
(gunshots)

205
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,788
- (Man) Haven't hurt anybody.

206
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,625
- (Ann) Take care of our baby.

207
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,211
(uneasy music)

208
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,358
(thunder rumbling)

209
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,799
- Well, there's a cow right there.

210
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,801
That's better than deer.

211
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,556
Here. You get to shoot it.

212
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,034
Wait. There's somebody else
out there.

213
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,715
- Hey! Hey!

214
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,717
Hey, wait over here!

215
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,220
Hey, over here! Over here, hey!

216
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,554
Over here! Daddy, what are
you doing?

217
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,514
We need to help them.

218
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,015
Hey! Hey come back!

219
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,517
Daddy! What are you doing?

220
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,519
Daddy, we need to help them.

221
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,063
(uneasy music)

222
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,292
- We need to get out of here.

223
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,255
Move!

224
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,799
(somber music)

225
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,570
(man whoops)

226
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,030
- Faster! Faster!

227
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,534
We'll catch you! (whoops)

228
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,960
- I know you're afraid.

229
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,505
It's a dangerous world and
you wanna keep me safe.

230
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,298
I get it.

231
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,426
- You're just like your mother.

232
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,429
- (Evie) Is that such a terrible thing?

233
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,263
- No.

234
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:44,975
I love you.

235
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,439
You're all I have.

236
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,400
(melancholic music)

237
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,821
- (Evie) Well, I forgive you.

238
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,915
(eerie music)

239
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,653
- You animals had your fun?

240
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,281
- (man with A beard) Yeah.

241
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,334
(soft airy music)

242
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,523
- All right.

243
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,484
- I call the bed.

244
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,738
- We're gonna be sharing the bed.

245
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,872
Hey, look at this.

246
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,040
- (Evie) What?

247
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,169
- Come down here.

248
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,338
- (Evie) What is it?

249
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,091
- Oh, sweet, here. Just a second.

250
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,304
- What is it?

251
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,597
- (Man) It's a record player.

252
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,349
I don't think you've
ever seen one of these.

253
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,392
- What does it do?

254
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,518
- Plays music.

255
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,064
- What?

256
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,742
- (Man) Maybe it works. Oh!

257
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,911
- (Evie) That's all it does?

258
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,248
- Let's see what kind of
records we got.

259
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,711
Oh, classic.

260
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,222

(music slowly fades)

268
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,543
- (Ann) You think we're safe here.

269
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,630
- Safe as we can be.

270
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,384
- Is it right what we've done?

271
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,469
- We haven't hurt anybody.

272
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,557
- So this is it for us?

273
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,850
- You want to go back to the city?

274
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,893
- That's not what I said.

275
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,397
- You don't have to worry.

276
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,317
- Take care of our baby.

277
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,076

279
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,583
Where's my jar?

280
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,423
- What do you want?

281
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,309
(stranger slurping)

282
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,007
You can sleep in the barn.

283
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,134
There's a trench latrine behind it.

284
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,637
Don't come back in this house.

285
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,847
I'll give you some food
and water in the morning.

286
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,641

- It's time to sleep.

296
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,366
- Who is that man?

297
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,327
- Well, don't worry about him.

298
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,038
- Will I ever have a friend again?

299
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,540
- Yeah, I promise.

300
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,585
Now it's time to go to sleep.

301
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,044
You want to pray?

302
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:28,920
- You pray.

303
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,338
- Okay.

304
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,549
Our daddy in heaven, you are -

(record player clicks)

313
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,516
All right, make me carry you.

314
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:20,240
So, yeah, you want to get
a little more water there.

315
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,574
Smooth that out.

316
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,495
You're doing good? You're
doing good.

317
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,247
- (Evie) Mine is not as
good as yours.

318
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,748
- (Man) It's fine.

319
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,334
- (Evie) I'm no good at this.

320
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,836
- (Man) You don't like it?

321
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,295
- (Evie) No, I don't.

322
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,256
- (Man) It takes practice.
You gotta practice.

323
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,175
- That's how that works, right?

324
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,094
- You see that egret out there.

325
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,928
- Where?

326
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,849
- Straight out there.
- Oh yeah.

327
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,601
Is that dinner?

328
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,356
- I don't think that'd be very good.

329
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,482
Little fishy.

330
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,490
- I think I have a career in this.

331
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,075
- It looks good.

332
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,453
I like the mountain. You
gotta get some water now.

333
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,328
Get your water there.

334
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,665
- Actually. I think you could use-

335
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,541
- What do I need?

336
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,877
- A duck, right there.

337
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,379
(eerie music)

338
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,339
Daddy, daddy, no!

339
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,299
What are you doing?

340
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,134
Daddy, no, please.

341
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,051
Put the gun down.

342
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,429
Daddy, no. Daddy, please.

343
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,972
- Just looking for hospitality.

344
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,225
This thing, It's not even loaded.

345
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,227
- Daddy, no. Daddy, please.

346
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,062
Daddy, please. Daddy, no.

347
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,565
(tense music)

348
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,617
(gunshot)

349
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,087
(gentle music)

350
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,566
No, you are a murderer.

351
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,447
- He was gonna kill us.

352
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,448
- No, he wasn't.

353
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,619
He was innocent, there
were no bullets in his gun.

354
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,710
Is this what mom would have
wanted for us?

355
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,545
- Don't.

356
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,046
- No, you know, I'm right!

357
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,382
You know, she wouldn't have
wanted this. Just me and you.

358
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,633
- I said don't.

359
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,976
- (Evie) There are good people out there.

360
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,271
- Good people do not survive
out there.

361
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,649
- I can't, I can't.

362
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:03,194
I can't be with just
you for my whole life.

363
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,659
- Someday, you're gonna have
to be alone.

364
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,493
Evie!

365
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,662
Evie, stop!

366
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,662

380
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,405
Hi. Who are you?

381
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,077
My name is Evie.

382
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,706
Do you live around here?

383
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,625
Wait, no, please.

384
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,879
Wait, wait, stop, please!

385
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,173
Wait!

386
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,760
(Evie gasps)

387
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,594
Wait!

388
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,848
Wait, please! (pants)

389
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,106
Hey, come back!

390
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,407
Hello!

391
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,871
(truck rumbles)

392
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,591
(truck rumbles)

393
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,650
(uneasy music)

394
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,572
- I won't hurt you, I promise.

395
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,660
I can see you.

396
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,079
No need to hide.

397
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,751
I'm the sheriff around here.

398
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,419
I can keep you safe.

399
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,104
You can just take your time.
Come out when you're ready.

400
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,272
- Who are you?

401
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,901
- My name is Levi.

402
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,239
- You're a sheriff?

403
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,073
- I am.

404
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,535
Now, who might you be?

405
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,621
- My name is Evie.

406
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,167
- Evie? That's a pretty name.

407
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:17,341
You can't be out here by
yourself. Now can you, Evie?

408
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:19,760
- No.

409
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,056
Why don't you take me to your camp, then.

410
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,642
- No. My daddy would kill you.

411
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,315
- We wouldn't want that, would we?

412
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,613
- I don't want to go back. Not now.

413
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,655
Where you come from,

414
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,033
are there a lot of people there?

415
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,867
- Yeah.

416
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,494
Yeah. There's a lot of people there.

417
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,997
And you can certainly join us.

418
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,751
Like I said, it's a safe place.

419
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,004
- Can my father come too?

420
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,006
- Yeah. Yeah, he can come.

421
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:01,260
Long as he promises not
to kill anyone, that is.

422
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,972
Now, why don't you come on with us

423
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,850
and we can show your daddy
that is a safe place?

424
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,352
We can be trusted.

425
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,858
We wouldn't want to have
to hurt him now, would we?

426
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,819
Now, come on.

427
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,489
Come on over here.

428
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,201
(anxious music)

429
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,720
That's it.

430
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,522
(uneasy music)

431
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,793
(truck door slams)

432
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,129
- Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

433
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,841
(engine rumbles)

434
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,710
(door slams)

435
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,463
(engine rumbles)

436
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,428
(eerie music)

437
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,100
- So, you're a sheriff?

438
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,605
You don't look that much older
than me.

439
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,774
- How old is that exactly?

440
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:21,817
- I'm 18.

441
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,655
I'm 16.

442
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:28,783
- Only 16?

443
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:37,333
- (Evie) You know, that
beard is not fooling anyone.

444
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,337
- Well, that's why I carry a gun.

445
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:52,431
- So, where are we going exactly?

446
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,808
- Place where a pretty girl like you

447
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,018
can get whatever she wants.

448
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:04,402
- How come my daddy's never
found your camp before?

449
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,487
- He probably already has.

450
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,864
Just didn't want to tell you.

451
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,495
Look, it's not his fault.

452
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,957
You know, we might not look
like the most trustworthy bunch,

453
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,875
but I give you my word.

454
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,711
I'll look after you.

455
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,508
Now, it's just you and
your dad that are out here?

456
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,342
Mom or?

457
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:34,014
- Yeah, my. My mom died a few
years ago.

458
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,644
- Sorry. Truly I am.

459
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,065
I lost my family too.

460
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:51,699
Now, I have to warn you that
some of the men that I have,

461
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,578
they can be...

462
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,417
I have to play like the man,
you know.

463
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,169
You ever think I'm
mistreating or anything,

464
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,254
you know, just tell me.

465
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,714
It's just a show.

466
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,342
I promise you this, we're
gonna keep you safe.

467
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,678
No matter where we take you.

468
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,807
I'll protect you.

469
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,269
(uneasy music)

470
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,780
Don't worry. They're with me.

471
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,093
Now, come on. Let's go.

472
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,528
- See you brought us another one.

473
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,656
- This one's not for you.

474
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,913
(intense music)

475
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,543
(Evie cries)

476
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,881
- I'm saving her for the Warlord.

477
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,551
You leave her alone

478
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,385
Got that?

479
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,147
- (Evie) Please, Levi, please.

480
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,486
- Quiet down, I gotta finish this.

481
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,829
Now bring the other two over here.

482
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,414
Get them loaded up.

483
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,042
Stay put.

484
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,629
You make a move, one of these
guys can do something to you.

485
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,923
Won't be very nice.

486
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,593
What are you waiting for?

487
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,927
Bring them over.

488
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,404
- My daddy will save us.

489
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,870
- They probably already killed him.

490
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,997
- No, they didn't.

491
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,999
You don't know my daddy.

492
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,710
- You think he can save you?

493
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,838
- I know he can and he will.

494
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,133
And he will save you too,
I promise you.

495
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,138
(gentle somber music)

496
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,316
(gunshot)

497
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,318
(gunshot)

498
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,654
(gunshot)
(man grunts)

499
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,823
(gunshot)

500
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,618
(gunshot)

501
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,830
(gunshot)

502
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,210
(gunshot)

503
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,424
(girls shriek)

504
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,640
- I'll kill him!

505
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,811
One more shot.

506
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,859
(gunshot)

507
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,409
(knife slashes)
(girls shriek)

508
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,416
- Please, please, please!

509
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,546
(Evie shrieks)

510
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,380
- This who you want.

511
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,466
- Daddy, please!

512
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,217
- This who you looking for?

513
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,051
- (Man) Stop!

514
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:03,886
Stop!

515
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,894
- (Drac) Come on down here.

516
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,277
Stop. That's far enough.

517
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,283
Take off all the weapons you have,
put them on the ground.

518
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,712
(hits)

519
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,215
(eerie music)

520
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,929
- (Ann) You think we're safe here?

521
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,682
Take care of our baby.

522
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,728
- (Man) Evie!

523
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:57,773
Evie, stop!

524
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,568
- (Drac) I'll kill her!

525
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,071
- (Ann) Take care of our baby.

526
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,411
(Evie screams)

527
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,958
- (Drac) This who you looking for?

528
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,964
This is your daddy, huh?

529
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,299
What we're gonna do with him?

530
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,843
- What do you want?

531
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,763
I told you, you can come
to the camp,

532
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:33,392
as long as he promises not
to hurt anyone.

533
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,311
- I'll work for you. I have skills.

534
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,774
Whatever it is, just tell me. I'll do it.

535
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,072
- Oh, I've seen your skill.

536
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,992
I've seen you gunned down
my men.

537
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,327
(Drac hits)

538
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,251
Now, you made me kill that boy.

539
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,254
I didn't want to do that, okay?

540
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,756
His blood's on your hands now.

541
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,844
I see why you ran away now?

542
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,431
Look, I can't bring an animal
like this back to the camp.

543
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,892
(Evie mumbles)

544
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,726
I'm sorry.

545
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,771
- I'll pay you.

546
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,316
- You want this delicious thing back?

547
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,526
What, she for sale?

548
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,360
No.

549
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,453
She chose me.

550
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:46,506
(Drac hits)
(Evie shrieks)

551
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,718
(Drac kicks)

552
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,853
(Drac hits)

553
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,070
(Man coughs)

554
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,571
(Evie sobs)

555
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:11,657
I love you.

556
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,918
(Evie) Please, please, don't kill him.

557
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,590
- (Evie) Please, please, don't kill him.

558
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,925
- I'm not gonna kill him.

559
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,052
I'm not gonna kill him,
I promise you that.

560
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:32,886
I won't.

561
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:38,517
But I can't have him
follow us back to the camp.

562
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,727
I'm gonna leave him here,

563
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:44,648
but he'll be alive when
we leave, I promise.

564
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,316
He'll be all right.

565
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,777
- Please, please, let him go.

566
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,445
- Sorry.

567
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,493
(tense music)

568
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:14,720
You're never gonna see
her again. You know that?

569
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,893
You think you could make a deal for her?

570
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,728
Sad.

571
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,736
You know, the kind thing
for me to do would be to,

572
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,988
would be to just kill you.

573
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,826
But I'm not gonna do that.

574
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,619
No. I made a promise.

575
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,667
And I always keep my promises.

576
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:54,509
Hope the coyotes don't get you.

577
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,934
(somber music)

578
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,630
- Where did you find him?

579
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,467
- He's not one of them.

580
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,969
- Are you certain?

581
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,684
- They took his daughter.

582
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,274
- How many girls they hold up
there now?

583
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,317
You just gonna keep watching,
aren't you?

584
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:38,029
When are you gonna get tired
of all this sneaking around?

585
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,532
- (Monk) Is killing so easy.

586
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,368
- I'm done waiting. So are
the others.

587
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:47,330
Your monastery is a
refuge and that's great,

588
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,999
but it's not enough.

589
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,212
- (Monk) Do you think
we have the strength?

590
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,801
They can kill me, but you,

591
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,845
you and the other women?

592
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,305
- (Larkin) That's what his daughter,

593
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:07,726
that's what all those other
women are already facing.

594
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,607
- Must be another way.

595
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,318
- I'm not asking your permission.

596
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,573
It's time.

597
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,953
(monk sighs)

598
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,713
(somber music)

599
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,325
- I want you looking your best.

600
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,997
You want to impress
the Warlord, don't you?

601
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,338
- Does he have a name?

602
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,258
- He'll keep you safe.

603
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,009
He'll take care of you.

604
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,558
- What about you?

605
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:34,229
- Right now, this is
the best thing for you.

606
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,357
I'll keep an eye on you.

607
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,242
- And Maria?

608
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,248
- What's she to you?

609
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,499
- Where is she?

610
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,586
- I'll do what I can.

611
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,140
- Where will you be?

612
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,270
- I'll be outside.

613
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,692
- I thought you were important.

614
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,249

01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,604
Just walk away.

719
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,276
I don't want to kill you.

720
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,052
(gunshot)

721
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:40,056
(gloomy music)

722
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,153
(gun clicks)

723
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,774
(suspenseful music)

724
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,527
- Maria, please, come on.

725
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,946
Come on, come on, come on.

726
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,780
Oh my God.

727
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:47,540
- (Maria) Leave me.

728
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,126
- (Evie) Never! Come on, Maria.

729
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,589
- I'll keep you safe.

730
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:57,341
- Leave us alone, okay?

731
01:08:57,341 --> 01:09:00,219
- No, no, I can't let you go.

732
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,597
Not after all I've done to help you.

733
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,850
- What help? You're insane.

734
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:10,020
- No, no. I did what I had to do.

735
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,151
I kept you alive.

736
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,946
- (Maria) Please let us go.

737
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,490
- We never asked for your help.

738
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,577
- Evie, you don't
understand the world yet.

739
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,412
How cruel it is. I do.

740
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:30,624
Think these people were here
to help you?

741
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:33,210
Your dad and her brother?

742
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,044
No.

743
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:38,883
No, they're all weak.

744
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,010
But I,

745
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,136
I am strong.

746
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:47,391
That's why they're all dead.

747
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:52,354
If you'd stuck with
them, you'd be dead too.

748
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:56,066
- Please just leave us alone.

749
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,446
We don't need your help.

750
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,615
We just want you to leave.

751
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,579
- No, no, I put everything
keeping you guys safe

752
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:11,290
and I'm not gonna lose you now.

753
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,250
Look, you can't survive
out here on your own.

754
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,668
I'll protect you.

755
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,922
I know you don't believe me,

756
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:23,135
but I've always been here
for you, both of you.

757
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,805
I'll continue to keep you safe,
all right?

758
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:29,975
Maria, now I kept you
out of the whorehouse

759
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,353
the best way I knew how.

760
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:35,231
And Evie, what danger
where you in?

761
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,570
Warlord wouldn't hurt you,
limp-dicked as he was.

762
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,865
I'm not saying that this world
isn't shit,

763
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:47,868
or that, I always haven't been
pleasant,

764
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,916
but I freed you.

765
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,167
You understand?

766
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,631
I'm not gonna hurt you.

767
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,342
Okay.

768
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,553
Just come with me.

769
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:12,226
Now, come on.

770
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,896
Come with me.

771
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:19,024
(Evie hits and kicks)

772
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,030
(Maria thuds)

773
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,282
- (Evie) Maria!

774
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:35,499
(Evie hits and kicks)

775
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,424
- You're tougher than I thought.

776
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,843
(Drac kicks)

777
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:58,230
Now I should bash your head in!

778
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,912
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do that.

779
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,084
I want to take care of you.

780
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,629
I wanna keep you safe, yeah?

781
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,506
You understand that?

782
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:29,136
I wanna make you mine.
