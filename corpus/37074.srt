1
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,580
Morning, Laura.

2
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,391
I like a man who dresses for clamming.

3
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:32,423
Business.

4
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:35,432
And on our vacation.

5
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,593
Do you forgive me?

6
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:43,964
How about these? Aren't they beautiful?
I thought I could steam them for starters.

7
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:47,239
I told the Blanchards
we'd do their stupid party.

8
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,647
All your hard work. I'll call them and cancel.

9
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:55,547
No.

10
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,088
I can just dig fresh ones tomorrow.

11
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,986
I missed you this morning.

12
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,762
Look what I've done.

13
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:16,840
No problem.

14
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:19,604
I've time to change.

15
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:06,047
That's a pretty dress.

16
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:10,454
I wouldn't have thought of it.

17
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:13,555
You were thinking the red?

18
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:18,466
- The black, actually.
- Well, it's backless. It could be chilly tonight.

19
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:25,500
- Hi, Martin. Great to see you.
- Thanks.

20
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:30,840
Good to see ya.

21
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:33,742
Hi.

22
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,569
Excuse me.

23
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:04,945
Have I been social long enough?

24
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:07,985
For the whole season.

25
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,162
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

26
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,941
Come with me.

27
00:07:57,455 --> 00:08:00,356
Isn't it a little early for this?

28
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,468
Everything in here as it should be?

29
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:17,769
I don't know why I forgot.

30
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:22,977
Well, we all forget things.
That's what reminding is for.

31
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:26,341
Thank you.

32
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,394
What's for supper?

33
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:21,165
Lamb with rosemary and the peach chutney,

34
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:24,731
- new potatoes and baby peas.
- Sounds great.

35
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,539
I was gonna make that herb bread
that you like.

36
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:30,005
I can hardly wait.

37
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:57,631
- You renting from the Driscolls?
- Hi.

38
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:01,436
Yeah.

39
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:05,382
John Fleishman.
I guess we must be neighbors.

40
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,010
Martin Burney. We live up there.

41
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:12,989
So that must be your wife that I keep
seeing staring down from the window.

42
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:16,322
- Laura.
- You're a lucky man.

43
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:20,022
I've been admiring your house.
It's one of the best on Cape Cod.

44
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:22,532
Thanks. You're from Boston?

45
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:26,797
Yeah, I've escaped from Mass General.
I'm a neurologist there.

46
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,665
We live there too.
I'm an investment counselor.

47
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:34,872
This is a terrific boat. Boats are a passion
of mine. One I don't get to indulge very often.

48
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:38,743
That's too bad. I would never
let anything keep me off the water.

49
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,719
My wife doesn't like sailing. She can't swim.
Nearly drowned when she was a child.

50
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:48,315
I usually try to get her on a boat
once a season. It's difficult, but I try.

51
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,452
Well, listen, I'm gonna be takin'
a run up the coast this evening.

52
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,363
It's full moon,
weather's supposed to be great.

53
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,367
- Maybe this'd be a good time.
- Maybe.

54
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:01,563
Let me talk to her. I'll raise it gently.

55
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:03,765
- OK.
- Thanks.

56
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,051
Nice-looking man, the doctor.

57
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:24,890
- Doctor?
- He says I have a beautiful house.

58
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:27,659
Best on the beach.

59
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:30,063
When was he in here?

60
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:33,194
Yesterday while I was in town?

61
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:37,332
- Martin, I don't know the doctor.
- Sure you do.

62
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:41,310
Young, good-looking.
Outfitting his sailboat down there.

63
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,616
He says you've been staring at him
from the window all day.

64
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:51,587
Does it give you that much pleasure
to humiliate me?

65
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:57,793
Stop it!

66
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:08,236
- Now you'll sulk, won't you?
- No.

67
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,897
- Yes, you will.
- I won't.

68
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:12,636
You'll pout and spoil our supper.

69
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:15,369
Our beautiful supper.

70
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:18,838
Just smell the bread.

71
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:22,377
I'm so sorry. Will you smile?

72
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:35,799
Your doctor friend,
he asked us to go sailing tonight.

73
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:40,429
Just a run along the coast.
Less than an hour each way.

74
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:44,668
I'll be right there, princess.
Right by your side.

75
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:51,605
I know how you feel, but we can't
conquer our fears by running away.

76
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:54,481
Do it? For me?

77
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,829
I think I'll run into town. Anything you need?

78
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:13,235
I'll be back.

79
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:28,596
Bonjour, madame.

80
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:34,540
You all alone in here?

81
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:41,207
They're beautiful.

82
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:47,651
I'm sorry we quarreled.

83
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,830
- If you don't like it I can...
- No, I do. I do.

84
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:43,512
Is it too early in the day for this?

85
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,338
You want something. I know my princess.

86
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:26,706
I'm waiting.

87
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:29,548
Mrs Clark called from the library.

88
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,421
- She said they could use me full time now.
- You already work three mornings a week,

89
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:38,586
and I support that
because I know your love of books.

90
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:43,633
What about our home?
Don't you love our home as much?

91
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:46,931
Has your dinner
been late to the table even once?

92
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:50,098
Oh, I can remember
not so far back it was late.

93
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,370
By two days.

94
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:55,776
That was six months ago.

95
00:18:56,814 --> 00:19:02,047
My mother was all I had. I'll never forgive
myself for not bringing her to live with us.

96
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:04,552
You shouldn't beat yourself.

97
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,984
You always treated her with love.

98
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:10,360
She died, Martin.
How could I not go to her funeral?

99
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:16,123
If you had told me, I would have taken you,
given me a chance to pay my last respects.

100
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,667
But you sneaked off inexplicably.

101
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:22,137
I didn't sneak off.

102
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,367
- Need I remind you how I worried?
- No.

103
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:29,435
You reminded me enough
the night I came back.

104
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:33,876
- You aren't suggesting I enjoyed that?
- Oh, God, no.

105
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:38,085
That would make you a monster.

106
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:43,819
If I didn't know you better,
I'd think you were provoking a quarrel

107
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:45,987
so you'd be unable to sail tonight.

108
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:52,959
Now, this is a useful discussion,
but one best postponed until after our sail.

109
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,268
Don't you think?

110
00:19:56,874 --> 00:19:58,967
Yes.

111
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:22,888
Thinking of our honeymoon?

112
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,096
The night I gave you that?
The night I taught you to dance?

113
00:20:27,204 --> 00:20:30,537
Those were the happiest days
of my whole life.

114
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,007
We will always be together.

115
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:38,537
Nothing can keep us apart.

116
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:41,408
It's time to go.

117
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:20,384
I wish that moon would come back.

118
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:23,918
We're OK.

119
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,566
Ah, shit. Well, so much for weather reports.

120
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:40,007
You said the weather would be fine.

121
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,136
Yeah. I don't know where this is comin' from.

122
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:47,173
We're gonna turn back.
Prepare to come about.

123
00:21:56,694 --> 00:22:00,186
Relax, princess. Nothing to worry about.

124
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:29,316
There's that first buoy.
We're almost home now.

125
00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:39,625
Tighten the jib! Crank it in!

126
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:52,148
Martin, go try and bring down the jib!

127
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:05,754
Hang on!

128
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:12,761
Hold on! Hold on!

129
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:18,438
I've got it!

130
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:24,308
Keep pulling! Keep pulling!

131
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:27,483
I've got it.

132
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:29,643
Stay low, Martin.

133
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,093
- Grab it!
- Get the rope! Get the rope!

134
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:40,254
Got it!

135
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:52,801
Here! Gimme your hand! Gimme your hand!

136
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,801
There! Hold on. I got you.

137
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,139
I got you.

138
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:03,611
- Laura!
- Oh, God!

139
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:07,149
- Oh, my God!
- Laura!

140
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:10,856
She can't swim!

141
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,759
Be careful!

142
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,432
- Laura! Laura!
- Laura?

143
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:22,069
- Laura! Laura!
- Careful, Martin!

144
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:26,167
Laura!

145
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:30,277
Laura!

146
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:32,740
Laura!

147
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:35,376
Laura!

148
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,845
Laura!

149
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,750
Laura!

150
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:46,062
Laura!

151
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:48,788
Laura!

152
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:58,398
We've gotta have another boat,
and a helicopter.

153
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:02,103
- Get back on the radio, please!
- Object sighted on the port bow!

154
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,707
- There's something out there! See it?
- There's something out there!

155
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:10,117
- Let's go!
- Can you see what it is?

156
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:21,653
Laura!

157
00:26:34,705 --> 00:26:39,836
We shall all come together once more
in God's gracious love and warm embrace,

158
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:44,711
for it is promised that whoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die.

159
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:46,874
Amen.

160
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:25,913
Laura!

161
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:29,050
Laura!

162
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:37,891
Laura!

163
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:43,367
That was the night that I died,
and someone else was saved.

164
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:54,039
Someone who was afraid of water,
but learned to swim.

165
00:27:54,885 --> 00:27:56,944
Come on, Laura!

166
00:27:58,922 --> 00:28:03,552
Someone who knew there would be
one moment when he wouldn't be watching.

167
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:10,132
Someone who knew that the darkness
from the broken lights would show the way.

168
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:34,735
Good mornin'.

169
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,157
Don't you like green?

170
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,564
I don't have a red one left.

171
00:30:58,668 --> 00:31:01,967
Come on. I got plenty.

172
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:13,114
You visitin' out here?

173
00:31:15,452 --> 00:31:18,387
My mom's by herself in a nursing home.

174
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:22,083
She's blind
and can't move her left side very well.

175
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,457
She had a stroke.

176
00:31:24,528 --> 00:31:27,053
I'm sorry to hear that.

177
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:30,996
You live back East?

178
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:34,932
I was visiting an old friend.

179
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:37,565
She needed me.

180
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:43,204
Sick, was she?
Course, it's none of my business.

181
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:48,709
She left her husband.

182
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,551
He was a horrible man. He used to beat her.

183
00:31:53,623 --> 00:31:57,115
- No!
- It started right after their honeymoon.

184
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,024
At first he was charming, tender.
But it all changed.

185
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:05,225
He said if she left him he would punish her,
and he meant it.

186
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:07,963
His punishments were terrible.

187
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:12,830
He would never let her go.
Said he could find her anywhere.

188
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:16,569
Couldn't she call the police?

189
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:19,444
Well, she did.
She called them, and a lawyer too.

190
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:25,579
They said she could make a citizen's arrest,
get a restraining order. It was pathetic.

191
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:31,126
Well, how did she leave?

192
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:36,796
She risked everything.

193
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:40,134
Escaped.

194
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:42,671
Started a new life.

195
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:49,539
Brave girl.

196
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:54,439
She thinks she's a coward.

197
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,679
A coward?

198
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,781
Not a girl like that.

199
00:33:07,464 --> 00:33:10,194
How long did you stay with him?

200
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,096
Too long.

201
00:33:18,475 --> 00:33:22,241
Three years, seven months,

202
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:26,574
six days.

203
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:37,489
Thank you for the apple.

204
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:30,100
Hi. I'm Iris Nepper.
So glad you could come today.

205
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:42,717
The house has some great possibilities.
I think you'd like it.

206
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,761
- How much is it again?
- 700.

207
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:02,828
Plus first and last month's deposit,
Miss Walters.

208
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:04,998
Waters.

209
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:08,609
700...

210
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:11,203
- I'm gonna take it.
- Good.

211
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,721
" When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way

212
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,419
" From your first cigarette
to your last dyin' day

213
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:39,757
" When you're a Jet, you're a thing...

214
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:47,998
" The Jets are in gear,
our cylinders are clickin'

215
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,903
" A lousy chicken

216
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:55,740
" Here come the Jets, yeah!
And we're gonna be, yeah!

217
00:38:58,414 --> 00:39:04,717
" When you're a Jet, you stay a Jet!

218
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:03,772
Shit!

219
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:08,903
Harvest time?

220
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:13,938
You know,
people get arrested for stealing in this town.

221
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:19,948
They were on the ground.
They're all damaged and bruised.

222
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,683
Bruised?

223
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,960
OK, well, not that one.

224
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:39,999
They all look pretty good to me.

225
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:43,169
This is unlawful trespass, you know.

226
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:45,770
It's just a few apples to bake a pie.

227
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:48,483
A pie.

228
00:41:48,584 --> 00:41:50,916
Well, why didn't you say so?

229
00:41:50,987 --> 00:41:55,583
Maybe we can make a deal. I love pie.

230
00:41:56,392 --> 00:41:58,826
I don't make deals.

231
00:42:14,343 --> 00:42:16,709
You forgot these.

232
00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:22,813
It's a shame to let 'em rot on the ground.
They're really great for baking.

233
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:27,647
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare ya.

234
00:42:33,863 --> 00:42:36,354
I'm sorry. Come on in.

235
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:51,936
Shit!

236
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:55,410
So, hi, my name's Ben... Woodward.

237
00:42:58,387 --> 00:43:00,878
That was me the other day.

238
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:04,819
On the lawn.

239
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:06,486
I know.

240
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,755
You caught me by surprise up there.

241
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:11,891
So I gathered.

242
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:14,299
I didn't realize anybody had moved in.

243
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:17,236
If I'd known, I would've rehearsed a little.

244
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,801
You were pretty good.

245
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:22,811
Oh, yeah? You liked it?

246
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:27,779
It brought back a memory. My mom took me
to that show when I was a little girl.

247
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,444
I love that show.

248
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,115
I directed it last semester.
I teach drama at the college here.

249
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:39,718
So tell me somethin', huh?

250
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,594
What's your name? Where are you from?

251
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:47,263
- Lotta questions.
- It's only two.

252
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,273
I don't mean to seem rude, but it's late for me.
Maybe we could do this some other time.

253
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:56,437
I'm sorry,
but... I'm not free till tomorrow night.

254
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:01,476
I'm makin' pot roast for dinner.
It'd be great with apple pie.

255
00:44:02,685 --> 00:44:05,085
I'm sure it would.

256
00:44:05,454 --> 00:44:09,288
Look, don't say anything.
I'll set two places, eight o'clock.

257
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:11,451
If you don't show,

258
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:14,860
I'll be eatin' pot roast for a week.

259
00:44:15,097 --> 00:44:17,725
It's no big deal, right?

260
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,357
Right.

261
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:25,032
- Good night.
- Good night.

262
00:44:41,057 --> 00:44:42,581
Mr Burney? You have a call.

263
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:47,094
- I told you to hold my calls.
- I know. But she says she knew your wife.

264
00:44:48,998 --> 00:44:51,398
Put her through.

265
00:44:55,071 --> 00:44:57,164
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr Burney.

266
00:44:57,273 --> 00:44:59,741
My name is Vanessa Shelley.

267
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:02,937
- Yes?
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

268
00:45:03,012 --> 00:45:08,143
I just heard about Laura, and I wanted
to call and tell you how much we'll miss her.

269
00:45:08,217 --> 00:45:10,310
Thank you.

270
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:13,514
- How did you know her?
- From the YWCA.

271
00:45:14,557 --> 00:45:18,755
No, you must be speaking of someone else.
My wife never went to the YWCA.

272
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:23,424
No. No, we took swimming there
Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8am.

273
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:26,831
Look, there's obviously some mistake.

274
00:45:26,936 --> 00:45:30,133
My wife drowned. She couldn't swim.

275
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:34,438
Well, at first she couldn't.
But she became a good swimmer.

276
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:39,106
- I'm sure you have the wrong woman.
- This is odd.

277
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:43,447
Mr Burney,
your wife studied gymnastics, didn't she?

278
00:45:43,552 --> 00:45:47,318
- No, my wife never studied gymnastics.
- That's strange.

279
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,554
She told us that's how
she got all those terrible bruises.

280
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:56,155
Mr Burney, I don't understand it.
I'm sorry if I've bothered you.

281
00:45:56,232 --> 00:45:58,564
This is just so confu...

282
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,232
Shit.

283
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:10,957
Shit!

284
00:48:16,472 --> 00:48:19,270
Fire department.

285
00:48:24,146 --> 00:48:27,081
I hope you like your roast well done.

286
00:48:32,388 --> 00:48:34,822
Come on in.

287
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:37,425
- Is that apple?
- What else?

288
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:41,826
Can I get you something?
Eye drops? Gas mask?

289
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:44,831
- No, thanks.
- How about some more music?

290
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:49,635
- I liked what you had on.
- No, I mean classical. For during dinner.

291
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:53,137
Sure, I like classical. Anything but Berlioz.

292
00:48:54,243 --> 00:48:55,767
Oh?

293
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:59,303
Yeah. His Symphonie Fantastique
gives me the chills.

294
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:02,316
Oh, really? Thanks for the tip.

295
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:08,987
So I understand you're lookin' for a job.

296
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:11,925
- Where'd you hear that?
- Well...

297
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:14,461
Small towns are funny places.

298
00:49:14,563 --> 00:49:16,758
Everybody knows everybody.

299
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:19,232
And I know a lot of people over at the college.

300
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:22,031
I could drop in a good word for you
if you like.

301
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:25,004
Why would you do that?

302
00:49:25,074 --> 00:49:27,941
God! Such paranoia.

303
00:49:28,644 --> 00:49:31,579
Where are you from? New York?

304
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:37,651
Listen, it's no problem.
With a few letters of recommendation...

305
00:49:37,753 --> 00:49:41,018
I don't have letters of recommendation.

306
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,456
Transcripts?

307
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:47,688
Come on! You got a driver's license, right?

308
00:49:48,297 --> 00:49:52,063
Look,
I really don't wanna talk about this, OK?

309
00:49:52,768 --> 00:49:55,669
- Gotcha.
- I'm not asking for anything, Ben.

310
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:59,864
Neither am I.

311
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:02,967
Jesus! That's a real...

312
00:50:06,315 --> 00:50:09,079
You OK?

313
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,849
Yeah, I'm gonna be.

314
00:50:15,124 --> 00:50:20,323
Listen. There's only one more thing
I'm gonna ask, only one thing I wanna know.

315
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:25,198
Do you have a name?

316
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:29,134
Sara Waters.

317
00:50:29,672 --> 00:50:33,506
Well... That's a start.

318
00:50:59,735 --> 00:51:03,296
She spoke so highly of you,
the quality of care.

319
00:51:03,372 --> 00:51:05,840
Laura's mother was so happy here.

320
00:51:05,908 --> 00:51:10,470
Well, it's always nice to hear that.
We enjoyed having her with us.

321
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:14,038
Laura's passing was so sudden, so shocking.

322
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:20,384
I tried to talk to as many of her family
and friends as I could find.

323
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:27,756
Then I thought maybe there were people
close to her that I never knew.

324
00:51:28,464 --> 00:51:31,399
Perhaps they visited her mother here.

325
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:35,000
You might remember or have records.

326
00:51:35,137 --> 00:51:38,197
Well,
I'm afraid we don't keep records on visitors.

327
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:40,798
- And you flew here, just...?
- Well, no.

328
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:44,743
I thought Laura might want
to be laid to rest here

329
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:47,304
in whatever place her mother was buried.

330
00:51:47,716 --> 00:51:51,550
So her mother's passed on as well?

331
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:56,421
Six months ago her mother died here,
in your care.

332
00:51:56,692 --> 00:52:00,685
Six months ago your wife removed
her mother from this institution.

333
00:52:00,763 --> 00:52:05,029
She was handicapped, as you know,
but otherwise in reasonably good health.

334
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:09,604
Mrs Burney simply showed up,
paid the bill, and collected her mother.

335
00:52:10,906 --> 00:52:13,397
Did she say where she was taking her?

336
00:52:13,942 --> 00:52:18,606
Why, home, of course. To live with you.

337
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:26,180
- Hi.
- Hi.

338
00:52:26,255 --> 00:52:29,122
- What are you doin' here?
- Waitin' for ya.

339
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:32,592
How's it goin'? What have they got you doin'?

340
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:35,528
Stacking. Filing. Overdue books.

341
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:39,229
- Are you enjoying it?
- I like it.

342
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:41,632
Thanks for helping me work this out.

343
00:52:43,005 --> 00:52:46,566
I saw you in town yesterday.
You were going into Walgreens.

344
00:52:46,642 --> 00:52:48,940
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

345
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:51,673
I called out your name. You didn't even blink.

346
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,080
- Maybe I didn't hear you.
- Your name isn't Sara Waters, is it?

347
00:52:56,218 --> 00:52:58,618
- Maybe I didn't hear you.
- No, you heard me.

348
00:53:00,823 --> 00:53:03,758
Look, I know this is crazy.

349
00:53:04,426 --> 00:53:06,621
I hardly know you really, but...

350
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:09,261
I like you.

351
00:53:09,364 --> 00:53:12,629
I do. I just...

352
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:17,268
I don't know how to feel what I'm feeling

353
00:53:17,372 --> 00:53:20,239
when I don't even know your name.

354
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:23,107
People never really know each other, Ben.

355
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,082
It doesn't have to be that way.
Give it a chance.

356
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:32,676
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- What are you afraid of?

357
00:53:32,788 --> 00:53:35,484
- What is it with men?
- Don't do that.

358
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:39,053
Look, I gotta know.

359
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:44,828
We're either honest with each other or it
doesn't happen. It just stops right here.

360
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,425
It never started.

361
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:57,003
OK.

362
00:54:11,894 --> 00:54:14,294
Hillgrove Nursing Home.

363
00:54:14,363 --> 00:54:17,890
- May I speak to Chloe Williams, please?
- Who's calling, please?

364
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:21,925
- A friend of the family.
- Just a minute. I'll put you through.

365
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,233
Hello?

366
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,374
Speak up, please. I can't hear you.

367
00:54:32,548 --> 00:54:35,881
- Hello?
- I miss you, Mom.

368
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:38,044
Hello?

369
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:40,713
I can't hear. Is anyone there?

370
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:44,887
- I love you. And I'm OK.
- Hello?

371
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:47,927
Oh, Jane, there's nobody on the line.

372
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:52,799
- Oh, I have so much to tell you.
- Did they say who was calling?

373
00:54:53,902 --> 00:54:55,961
See you soon.

374
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:06,575
- And where was she last seen?
- In a nursing home here in Minneapolis.

375
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:10,382
- So you tried there?
- Six months ago she was removed.

376
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:12,544
Taken elsewhere.

377
00:55:12,621 --> 00:55:16,990
But in her condition, not very far.
I'd suggest two days' drive at most.

378
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:21,621
I can put three men on it. But it'll cost.

379
00:55:22,598 --> 00:55:24,691
Good.

380
00:55:24,766 --> 00:55:27,394
I want this taken very seriously.

381
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:32,132
And if she's found, a $10,000 bonus
to the man who does, in cash.

382
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:35,432
And another ten to you.

383
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:23,983
Sorry.

384
00:56:34,703 --> 00:56:37,194
- Hi!
- Hi.

385
00:56:38,073 --> 00:56:39,097
Yuck!

386
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:42,472
This little girl
went nuts with the cotton candy.

387
00:56:42,577 --> 00:56:46,308
- Yeah, I saw her. She was beautiful.
- And knows it, too.

388
00:56:47,382 --> 00:56:49,282
It's good to see you.

389
00:56:49,384 --> 00:56:53,445
- Yeah, you too.
- I feel kinda funny about the other day.

390
00:56:53,522 --> 00:56:57,014
- Let's just forget about it, OK?
- OK.

391
00:57:00,495 --> 00:57:03,794
- Heartland, huh?
- Have you always lived here?

392
00:57:03,865 --> 00:57:08,325
No, I lived in New York for a coupla years.
Tried to be an actor.

393
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,463
Closest I ever got to Broadway
was tendin' bar at Sardi's.

394
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:17,110
Sometimes I feel like a failure
for comin' back here,

395
00:57:17,212 --> 00:57:20,306
but other times I think
it's the smartest move I ever made.

396
00:57:20,749 --> 00:57:22,842
Know why I came here?

397
00:57:22,918 --> 00:57:25,113
To be near my mom.

398
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:29,418
She had a partial stroke three years ago.
I couldn't care for her.

399
00:57:29,524 --> 00:57:33,358
- How is she now?
- I don't know. I haven't seen her.

400
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:36,293
I haven't gone there yet.

401
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:39,630
- Why not?
- I'm not sure it's safe.

402
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:51,870
" Hush, little baby, don't say a word

403

Yeah, it's me.

406
00:59:04,052 --> 00:59:08,318
- I'm sorry. Did I scare ya?
- I'm just a little on edge.

407
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:12,451
- Look, I want you to come with me.
- Come with you where?

408
00:59:15,339 --> 00:59:17,398
Ben, where are you?

409
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:31,644

What you said is right.

467
01:06:58,168 --> 01:07:00,398
I had a husband.

468
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:04,062
And he hurt me.

469
01:07:05,876 --> 01:07:10,176
- I guess I'm just really afraid.
- Of what?

470
01:07:13,517 --> 01:07:16,281
Of never getting my life back together.

471
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:19,415
It just feels like that.

472
01:07:20,924 --> 01:07:23,449
Someday you might surprise yourself.

473
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:29,388
I'm glad you're here.

- Hold still.
- I am holding still.

- Your mouth. Keep it shut.
- Well, it's tickling me.

477
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:57,684
- OK. Hold that front there.
- Here?

Yeah.

Oh, Ben, that looks great.

480
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:13,472
- Even your mother won't recognize you.
- My mother will recognize me.

481
01:08:39,403 --> 01:08:41,894
Can I help you, sir?

482
01:08:42,506 --> 01:08:47,705
- Yeah, I'm looking for the rest room, ma'am.
- It's right around the corner there.

491
01:09:31,822 --> 01:09:35,383
- Are you all right?
- I left him, Mom.

492
01:09:37,194 --> 01:09:40,061
It just became so terrible.

493
01:09:42,232 --> 01:09:45,724
But I'm all right now,
and we're gonna be fine.

494

You look so beautiful.

495
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:52,572
- It's a wig.
- Is he looking for you?

496
01:09:54,344 --> 01:09:56,938
I don't think so.

497
01:09:57,013 --> 01:10:00,244
- But I'm not sure.
- God! What did he do?

498
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:02,875
It doesn't matter now.

499
01:10:06,256 --> 01:10:08,349
You'll be OK alone?

500
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,290
Yeah, I'm OK.

501
01:10:12,395 --> 01:10:14,454
I got a job.

502
01:10:14,564 --> 01:10:19,092
Makin' my own money, and I have a friend.

01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:22,430
A man.

504
01:10:22,506 --> 01:10:24,599
He's nice, Mom.

505
01:10:24,674 --> 01:10:27,700
He teaches drama
at the college in Cedar Falls.

506
01:10:29,779 --> 01:10:32,475
It's been hard for you.

507
01:10:34,618 --> 01:10:36,984
Honey, you're gonna be fine.

508
01:10:37,287 --> 01:10:39,812
Inside, you always were.

509
01:10:40,857 --> 01:10:46,318
There's nothing Martin or any man
can do or say to take that away.

510
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:49,898
You have yourself.

511
01:10:52,202 --> 01:10:54,295
Thanks, Mom.

512
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:36,970
Excuse me. I wonder if you could help me.

513
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:39,915
I can try.

514
01:11:39,983 --> 01:11:43,851
My younger sister
used to work for the lady in room 14.

515
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,050
She's returning to this area
and I know she'll want to visit Mrs Williams.

516
01:11:48,124 --> 01:11:50,718
And you'd like to leave a message for her?

517
01:11:51,494 --> 01:11:53,394
Well, the thing is,

518
01:11:53,496 --> 01:11:58,092
my sister married someone the family
didn't approve of really and we grew apart.

519
01:11:58,168 --> 01:12:00,261
I was wrong to let that happen.

520
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:03,703
If she knows I'm here,
she won't see me or take my calls.

521
01:12:03,773 --> 01:12:05,866
I wanna surprise her.

522
01:12:05,942 --> 01:12:09,776
What I need is someone
just to let me know she's here.

523
01:12:09,879 --> 01:12:12,746
Someone I can trust to keep a secret.

524
01:12:12,816 --> 01:12:16,547
Here's my name and motel number.

525
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,612
It would sure mean a lot to me.

526
01:12:19,723 --> 01:12:22,385
I'd be glad to help.

527
01:12:22,492 --> 01:12:24,551
Thanks.

528
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,204
Jane?

529
01:12:36,306 --> 01:12:39,139
Jane... Jane?

530
01:12:40,543 --> 01:12:44,639
- Mom, who were you talking to?
- Nobody, I guess.

531
01:12:44,748 --> 01:12:47,808
Here's your medicine. Hold out your hand.

532
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:42,468
Excuse me, sir? Won't be a minute.

533
01:13:42,572 --> 01:13:46,599
I gotta go. OK.
Yeah. I'll call you later. Bye-bye.

534
01:13:47,644 --> 01:13:49,908
You asked about Chloe Williams' visitors.

535
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:53,176
Well, for six months not one,
then suddenly today...

536
01:13:53,249 --> 01:13:56,685
- A young woman.
- Uh-uh. A young man, a little mustache.

537
01:13:56,786 --> 01:13:59,016
Only just walked out that door.

538
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:29,648
- Did you see her?
- God, it was perfect!

539
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:33,917
Oh, she looks so beautiful.
Nobody suspected a thing. I felt so safe.

540
01:14:34,023 --> 01:14:36,924
You are safe. You are.

541
01:14:54,711 --> 01:14:58,909
Will you let me help you with your supper?
It does look delicious.

542
01:14:58,982 --> 01:15:02,179
- Who are you?
- My name is Darryl Walker, ma'am.

543
01:15:02,285 --> 01:15:04,549
I'm a police officer.

544
01:15:06,055 --> 01:15:08,387
Am I under arrest?

545
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,586
No, no. I just have some questions.

546
01:15:12,462 --> 01:15:15,158
Shall we start with some steak?

547
01:15:18,968 --> 01:15:21,129
You had a visitor yesterday.

548
01:15:23,606 --> 01:15:26,871
Yes, my nephew. He's from Wisconsin.

549
01:15:26,943 --> 01:15:29,935
Good girl. Laura should be proud of you.

550
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,873
Carrots.

551
01:15:33,683 --> 01:15:38,552
We have to get word to her, ma'am.
The Boston police have called us.

552
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:43,024
They say her husband is in this area.
We think he wants to harm her.

553
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:47,320
So if she calls,
have her ring the police at Sioux City...

554
01:15:47,397 --> 01:15:50,833
She won't call. Not till Sunday, she said.

555
01:15:51,734 --> 01:15:54,134
That's a long time.

556
01:15:54,204 --> 01:15:56,764
He's a crazy man.

557
01:15:58,007 --> 01:16:00,339
I know that.

558
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:02,935
He's very dangerous.

559
01:16:05,982 --> 01:16:09,383
Help us find him, Chloe, for God's sake.

560
01:16:09,452 --> 01:16:12,751
- We have to warn her.
- I don't know where!

561
01:16:12,822 --> 01:16:15,848
Think! Think.

562
01:16:15,959 --> 01:16:18,359
Is she with someone?

563
01:16:18,428 --> 01:16:21,829
A man, perhaps? Someone we could contact.

564
01:16:22,866 --> 01:16:25,232
He teaches dramatics.

565
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:31,273
- Where?
- At a college in Cedar Falls.

566
01:16:34,944 --> 01:16:37,003
Thank you, Chloe.

567
01:16:41,851 --> 01:16:43,648
Help her.

568
01:16:46,823 --> 01:16:48,848
Please.

569
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:52,259
Chloe? It's time for your medicine.

570
01:16:52,662 --> 01:16:55,256
Here you go, Chloe.

571
01:16:55,832 --> 01:16:58,426
Don't worry.

572
01:17:25,695 --> 01:17:29,597
Where is she?
Please don't make me ask again.

573
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:33,795
- I don't... I don't know...
- My wife. She's only my wife.

574
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:37,306
- A wonderful fuck, isn't she?
- Mister, you've got the wrong guy.

575
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:40,069
That would be disappointing.
I hate to be wrong.

576
01:17:40,143 --> 01:17:44,512
- Why? Why does it have to be me?
- Because you teach drama.

577
01:17:44,614 --> 01:17:47,412
Oh, Jesus! God, there must be half a dozen...

578
01:17:47,483 --> 01:17:50,884
- It's you.
- No! You don't understand.

579
01:17:50,954 --> 01:17:53,252
I live with another man.

580
01:17:53,456 --> 01:17:55,515
Ask anyone!

581
01:17:58,494 --> 01:18:01,292
If you tell anyone, if you tell the police,

582
01:18:01,364 --> 01:18:04,231
you and your gentleman friend...

583
01:18:18,881 --> 01:18:24,649
Stay with me, Nina,
I implore you, or or let me go with you...

584
01:18:24,754 --> 01:18:27,348
OK. Good, good. Come on down for a second.

585
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:31,393
One thing we can't forget is
Treplev hasn't seen Nina in two years,

586
01:18:31,494 --> 01:18:35,328
so when he gets her in the room,
he wants her to stay. Know what I mean?

587
01:18:35,398 --> 01:18:40,597
Nina, I cursed you. I hated you.
I tore up all your letters and photographs,

588
01:18:40,737 --> 01:18:45,868
but every minute I was conscious
that my soul was bound to yours forever.

589
01:18:45,942 --> 01:18:48,001
I can never stop loving you.

590
01:18:48,111 --> 01:18:52,480
Ever since I lost you,
my life has been unbearable. I'm miserable.

591
01:18:52,548 --> 01:18:55,346
I call to you, I kiss the ground you walked on.

592
01:18:55,418 --> 01:18:58,148
Wherever I look, I see your face.

593
01:18:58,221 --> 01:19:01,679
I am alone.
I've no one's affection to warm me.

594
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:04,225
I am as cold as if I were living in a dungeon,

595
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:08,423
and no matter what I write, it's dry, hard, dark.

596
01:19:09,766 --> 01:19:12,394
Stay here, Nina, I implore you,

597
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:14,993
or let me go with you.

598
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:20,935
- You ever loved someone that much?
- No.

599
01:22:19,121 --> 01:22:22,215
So, give me 20 minutes.
I just wanna freshen up.

600
01:22:25,528 --> 01:22:30,295
- Can I bring anything?
- Just you. And leave your friends at home.

601
01:22:30,366 --> 01:22:32,834
I won't take long.

602
01:25:02,852 --> 01:25:06,447
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

603
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:09,688
Saying goodbye to old ghosts, you know.

604
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:13,185
- What are you doin' here?
- It's all set.

605
01:25:13,295 --> 01:25:15,923
- Come on. Get dressed.
- OK.

606
01:25:15,998 --> 01:25:18,523
I'll see you out there.

607
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:47,559
Do you wanna do somethin' tomorrow?

608
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:49,723
Yeah, sure.

609
01:25:52,168 --> 01:25:54,932
I had a really good time tonight.

610
01:25:55,004 --> 01:25:57,097
Me too.

611
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,439
- Tomorrow.
- Yeah.

612
01:26:50,025 --> 01:26:52,084
Ben.

613
01:27:57,359 --> 01:27:59,452
Shit!

614
01:28:42,371 --> 01:28:44,134
No!

615
01:28:53,482 --> 01:28:55,541
Hello, princess.

616
01:28:57,419 --> 01:28:59,910
It's wonderful to see ya...

617
01:29:00,723 --> 01:29:02,782
alive.

618
01:29:04,793 --> 01:29:07,728
That's the first touch after so long apart.

619
01:29:09,798 --> 01:29:12,528
Have you been thinking of it too?

620
01:29:15,638 --> 01:29:18,106
Sara? Are you there?

621
01:29:22,978 --> 01:29:25,776
- No...
- I'll kill him.

622
01:29:25,914 --> 01:29:28,781
- Can you hear me?
- Just a second.

623
01:29:46,335 --> 01:29:48,064
- Hi.
- Hi.

624
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:51,537
It's tomorrow. 12:05. I couldn't wait.

625
01:29:52,808 --> 01:29:56,869
- Ben, I'm just so tired.
- Still spooked by ghosts, huh?

626
01:29:57,646 --> 01:30:00,843
- They're all around me.
- How about I come in?

627
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:04,246
It's really not a good time, OK?

628
01:30:08,257 --> 01:30:10,350
Later, then.

629
01:30:12,561 --> 01:30:16,088
- Good night, Sara.
- Good night.

630
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,666
He doesn't matter.
He's nothing, Laura. Nothing.

631
01:30:31,647 --> 01:30:33,808
Fuck you.

632
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,915
What's his name?

633
01:30:42,891 --> 01:30:44,722
Ben.

634
01:30:44,893 --> 01:30:46,986
Martin, he...

635
01:30:47,062 --> 01:30:50,589
He doesn't have anything to do with us,
does he, princess?

636
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,834
- Does he?
- No.

637
01:30:56,538 --> 01:31:01,407
Remember our honeymoon.
The night I taught you to dance.

638
01:31:08,283 --> 01:31:11,343
Of course you haven't forgotten.

639
01:31:11,487 --> 01:31:15,651
You said those were
the happiest days of your whole life.

640
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:18,350
Remember this?

641
01:31:20,162 --> 01:31:22,687
This is yours, Laura.

642
01:31:22,765 --> 01:31:25,563
We are one. We will always be one.

643
01:31:25,667 --> 01:31:28,135
Nothing can keep us apart.

644
01:31:32,074 --> 01:31:32,938
Martin...

645
01:31:47,523 --> 01:31:49,684
I'm impressed.

646
01:31:52,127 --> 01:31:55,654
Now let's end this while you're still ahead.

647
01:31:55,998 --> 01:31:59,263
Come to me, Martin. Walk this way.

648
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:01,894
Always my pleasure.

649
01:32:05,073 --> 01:32:08,668
- That's far enough.
- Oh, I don't think so.

650
01:32:08,744 --> 01:32:11,304
Here feels right.

651
01:32:13,148 --> 01:32:15,412
There's the telephone.

652
01:32:16,752 --> 01:32:19,084
You could call the police.

653
01:32:19,154 --> 01:32:24,217
I know your every thought, Laura.
You're wondering if they can protect you.

654
01:32:25,327 --> 01:32:27,192
Who knows?

655
01:32:27,296 --> 01:32:32,290
They may issue an order instructing me
to stay away from my own wife.

656
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:35,899
Nothing can keep me away.

657
01:32:36,705 --> 01:32:38,764
I love you, Laura.

658
01:32:40,409 --> 01:32:42,934
I can't live without you.

659
01:32:43,846 --> 01:32:46,110
And I won't let you live without me.

660
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:00,727
Think carefully.

661
01:33:05,267 --> 01:33:10,136
- Yes, give me the police. Hurry, please.
- This is our last chance.

662
01:33:11,206 --> 01:33:15,540
- Yes, this is Sara Waters at 408 Tremont.
- Take that chance.

663
01:33:15,878 --> 01:33:18,676
Come quickly. I've just killed an intruder.

664
01:33:24,286 --> 01:33:26,379
God!

665
01:34:50,706 --> 01:34:52,765
Ben...
