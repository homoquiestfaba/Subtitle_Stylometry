1
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,046
l'm stuck.

2
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:42,437
Get back!

3
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:27,636
Mr. Tweedy!

4
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:32,642
What is that chicken
doing outside the fence?

5
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:37,636
l don't know, luv.
- Just deal with it. Now!

6
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:49,917
l'll teach you
to make a fool out of me.

7
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,924
Let that be a lesson to you!

8
00:03:56,327 --> 00:04:00,400
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!

9
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:11,876
Morning, Ginger.

10
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:14,961
Back from holiday?
- l wasn't on holiday.

11
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,676
l was in solitary confinement.

12
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,965
lt's nice to get a bit of time
to yourself, isn't it?

13
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:29,679
Roll call!
Come along. You'll be late for parade.

14
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:31,918
Pip, pip. Quick march.

15
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,318
Left right ...

16
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,285
Come on, smarten up!

17
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,166
Discipline! Order!

18
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,957
Back in my RAF days,
when an officer called for a scramble,

19
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,279
you'd hop in the old crate
and chocks away!

20
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:48,724
Keep over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.

21
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,925
How dare you talk back
to a senior ranking officer!

22
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,718
Back in my RAF days ...
- Fowler, they're coming.

23
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:56,996
Right, right!

24
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,763
There'll be a reprimand, lad.
You're grounded.

25
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,200
Attention!

26
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,918
Welcome back, hen.
ls there a new plan?

27
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:32,446
We've already tried going under.

28
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,726
Over. Right.

29
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:50,120
How's the egg count?
- l laid 5 eggs today.

30
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:52,643
Well chuffed with that, l was.

31
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,075
Oh no.

32
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:10,646
Why didn't you give her some of yours?
- She didn't tell me.

33
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,560
She didn't tell anyone.

34
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,203
ls Edwina off on holiday?

35
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:23,483
We've got to get out of here.

36
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,643
Are we still on?
- We're on, all right.

37
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,959
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in Hut 17.

38
00:10:59,007 --> 00:10:59,996
You called?

39
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,802
Nick and ...
- Fetcher. - At your service.

40
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:09,726
Over here.

41
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,518
We need more things.
- Right you are, Miss.

42
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,804
How about this quality tea set?

43
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:20,640
A lovely necklace and pendant.

44
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,279
Or this number. All the rage in
the fashionable Paris chicken coops.

45
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:29,197
Simply pop it on,
and as the French say: "Voila!"

46
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:30,801
That is French.

47
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:35,325
lt's two hats in one, Miss.
For parties. For weddings.

48
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,962
Madame, you look like a vision,
like a dream.

49
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,881
Like a duck.
- No, thank you.

50
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,518
We're making this. We need this.
Can you get it?

51
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,117
This is a big job, Miss.
Bigger than the others.

52
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:55,122
This will cost.
- The usual: one bag of seed.

53
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:57,643
You call this pay?
- lt's chicken feed.

54
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:00,515
What could we give you?
- Eggs.

55
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:03,963
We can't. Our eggs are too valuable.

56
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:05,686
So are we.

57
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,122
After you, Fetcher.

58
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:12,276
After l what?

59
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:14,440
Move!

60
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:40,396
Stupid, worthless creatures!

61
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:44,918
l'm sick and tired
of making minuscule profits.

62
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:06,515
Oh, yes.

63
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,198
Those chickens are up to something.

64
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:12,360
Quiet.
l'm onto something.

65
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,200
They're organized.

66
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,916
Quiet!
- That ginger one

67
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:18,442
is their leader.

68
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:24,363
l may have found a way
to make some real money.

69
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:28,476
What are you on about? Ridiculous
notions of escaping chickens.

70
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:33,398
lt's all in your head,
Mr. Tweedy. Say it.

71
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:35,798
lt's all in my head.

72
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:38,562
Now you keep telling yourself that,

73
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:42,801
because l won't hear another word
about it. ls that clear?

74
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:45,163
Yes, luv.

75
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,477
But the ginger one!

76
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:50,277
They're chickens, you dolt!
Apart from you,

77
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:53,247
they're the most stupid creatures
on the planet!

78
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:56,002
They don't plot,
they don't scheme,

79
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:58,398
and they're not organized!

80
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,922
Order! Order!

81
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:04,124
Quiet, everyone.

82
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,960
Settle down.

83
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:10,042
l would like to call to order ...
- Quiet!

84
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:13,521
Discipline in the ranks!
What! What!

85
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:16,600
Thank you, Fowler.
- ln my RAF days, we never wasted time

86
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:20,761
with unnecessary chitchat.
- Yes, thank you, Fowler.

87
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:26,881
Right.

88
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,441
Carry on.

89
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:37,241
Our last escape attempt
was a bit of a fiasco,

90
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,842
but Mac and l have a new plan.

91
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:44,240
Show them, Mac. - We tried going
under that wire, and it didn't work.

92
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:46,797
So the plan is: we go

93
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:48,720
over it.

94
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,362
This is us, right?
We get in like this

95
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,997
and wind her up, and

96
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:57,078
let her go!

97
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:05,359
Good grief!
The turnip's bought it.

98
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,520
Farmer's coming!

99
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,965
Operation Cover-Up!

100
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:44,399
Mr. Tweedy,

101
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,886
where are you?

102
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,561
lt's all in your head.

103
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,684
Think, everyone.
What haven't we tried yet?

104
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,276
We haven't tried
not trying to escape.

105
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,156
Might work.

106
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:06,840
What about Edwina?

107
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:10,557
How many more empty nests
will it take?

108
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,561
Maybe she should have spent more time
laying eggs

109
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:16,401
and less time escaping.
- Laying eggs,

110
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,924
then getting plucked and roasted
is good enough for you?

111
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:22,122
lt's a living.

112
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,918
The fences aren't just
around the farm.

113
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,921
They're up here in your heads.

114
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,397
There is a better place out there.

115
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,362
Somewhere beyond that hill,

116
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,044
it has wide open spaces
and lots of trees.

117
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,884
And grass. Can you imagine that?

118
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,403
Cool, green grass.

119
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:46,001
Who feeds us?

120
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,717
We feed ourselves.
- Where's the farm?

121
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:52,119
There is no farm.
- Then where does the farmer live?

122
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:55,087
There is no farmer.
- ls he on holiday?

123
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,603
He isn't anywhere.
Don't you get it?

124
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:00,123
No egg count,
no farmers, no dogs,

125
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:03,564
no coops and keys
and no fences!

126
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:08,886
ln all my life
l've never heard such a fantastic

127
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:10,925
load of tripe!

128
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,244
Face the facts, ducks.

129
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:17,002
The chance of us getting out
are a million to one.

130
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,725
Then there's still a chance!

131
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,318
Oh, no!

132
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:47,844
Who am l fooling?
l can't lead this bunch of ...

133
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:54,404
Heaven help us.

134
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,724
Freedom!

135
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,515
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've been a wonderful audience.

136
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,525
That's it.

137
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:49,362
lnside, quickly!

138
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,159
Here's our way out!

139
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,966
We'll make posters?

140
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,686
What's on the posters, Babs?
We'll fly out.

141
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,636
Must be important to be on a poster.
l wonder what he does.

142
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,800
Obviously,
he's a professional flying rooster.

143
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:14,402
Flies around giving demonstrations.

144
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:16,843
Do you suppose?
- Absolutely!

145
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,275
No, not in there!

146
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,086
Get out!

147
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,483
Who are you? Where am l?
What happened to my wing?

148
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:34,196
You took a nasty fall.
- Spraining the anterior tendon

149
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:38,122
connecting the radius to the humerus.
l wrapped it.

150
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,916
Was that English?
- She fixed your wing.

151
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:43,960
l made the bandage.
- l carried you in.

152
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,562
Back up and start from the top.
Where am l?

153
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:56,757
How rude of us. We're just excited ...
This is a chicken farm.

154
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,759
And we're the chickens.

155
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,443
With you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens.

156
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:03,719
l don't like his look.

157
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:05,879
His eyes are too close together.

158
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:09,962
And he's a Yank! - Cockfighting's
illegal where l come from.

159
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,804
Where is that? - A place l call
home of the free, land of the brave.

160
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:16,242
Scotland!

161
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,160
No! America.

162
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:22,555
Poppycock!

163
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,879
Pushy Americans.
Always showing up late for every war.

164
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:30,283
Overpaid, oversexed
and over here.

165
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,236
What's eating grandpa?
- Don't mind him, Mister ...

166
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:38,083
My name's Rocky, the Rhode lsland Red.
Rhodes for short.

167
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,806
Rocky Rhodes!

168
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:41,686
Catchy, ain't it?

169
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,558
Mr. Rhodes, is this you?

170
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:47,883
Who wants to know?

171
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:51,723
A group of desperate chickens.
lf it's you,

172
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,038
you may be the answer to our prayers.

173
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:02,041
Then call me a miracle, dollface,
'cause that's me.

174
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:06,001
What brings you to England,
Mr. Rhodes?

175
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,922
All the beautiful English chicks,
of course.

176
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,079
Give over!

177
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:17,125
l'm a traveler.
l did that barnyard thing for a while,

178
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,041
but couldn't get into it.
Hi. How are you?

179
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,323
Nope!

180
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:25,800
The open road is more my style.
Put a pack on my back

181
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:27,879
and point me where the wind blows.

182
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,837
Know what they call me back home?

183
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,683
You'll love this.
The Lone Free-Ranger.

184
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:37,486
lsn't that great?

185
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:40,038
l knew it was possible.
- lt's possible!

186
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:41,766
The answer had to come!
- Amen!

187
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:46,240
We'll fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes will show us how. Right?

188
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:50,435
That's ri ... What?
Did you say "fly?"

189
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:53,281
You can teach us.
- No, l can't.

190
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,120
Listen! You hear that?

191
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:59,965
The open road's calling,
and l have to answer.

192
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,437
Bye.

193
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,717
He must have very good hearing.

194
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,321
Okay, where's the exit?
This way.

195
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,606
Mr. Rhodes? Perhaps l didn't explain
our situation properly.

196
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:14,884
We lay eggs, day in, day out.

197
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,596
When we can't lay any more,
they kill us.

198
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:21,764
lt's a cruel world, dollface.
Better get used to it.

199
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,681
Which part of "they kill us"
don't you understand?

200
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:26,725
l got my own set of problems.

201
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:29,277
Besides, it can't be
that hard to bust out of here.

202
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:31,723
Watch me.

203
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:37,038
lt's not so hard for a chicken or two
to get out, but it's about all of us.

204
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:43,799
All of you? - l've been trying
to tell you. - Let's get it straight.

205
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:47,802
You want to get every chicken
out of here at once?

206
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:50,801
Of course.
- You're certifiable.

207
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:54,563
You can't pull that off.
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

208
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:58,926
Couldn't agree more.
And l will be leaving. That way.

209
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:01,518
Mr. Rhodes, please!

210
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,806
So that's it.
You're from the circus.

211
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,598
You're on the run, aren't you?

212
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:34,082
Keep it down!
l'm trying to lay low here.

213
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,358
l should turn you in right now.
- You wouldn't.

214
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,485
Would you?
- Why not?

215
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,957
Because l'm cute?

216
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:49,236
Hey, hey. You crazy chick!

217
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:52,400
You know what'll happen
if he finds me? - lt's a cruel world.

218
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:56,004
l don't like you.
- l don't care.

219
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:59,956
Show us how to fly. - With this wing?
- Teach us, then.

220
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,723
He's valuable, you say?

221
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:07,083
Sure.
- Get the torch.

222
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:10,121
Listen here, sister.
l'm not going back to that life.

223
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:12,995
l'm a Lone Free-Ranger.
Emphasis on "free."

224
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:15,796
And that's what we want ...
freedom.

225
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:21,565
Fancy that, they're coming.

226
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,605
Oh, no! They're onto me!

227
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:27,522
Teach us to fly. We'll hide you.
- And if l don't?

228
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:31,247
Was your father by any chance
a vulture?

229
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,923
Do we have a deal?

230
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:56,085
Time to make good on that deal,
dollface. - The name is Ginger.

231
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:14,884
Comfortable?
- Not really.

232
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,118
Maybe this will help.

233
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:22,359
Nice hideout.
l had more room in my egg.

234
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:25,839
We held up our end of it.
Tomorrow you hold up yours.

235
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:27,805
What deal?
- Flying.

236
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:31,483
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
l'll teach you everything l know.

237
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:34,720
Which bunk is mine?

238
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:40,564
Absolutely outrageous!

239
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,401
Asking a senior officer
to share his quarters.

240
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:46,275
And with a non-commissioned Yank,
no less!

241
00:25:46,687 --> 00:25:48,405
Why, back in my day ...

242
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:51,196
You weren't exactly
my first choice either.

243
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:54,202
Scoot over. Your wing's
on my side of the bunk.

244
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:59,078
Your side of the bunk?
The whole bunk is my side!

245
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:03,159
What is that smell?
ls that your breath?

246
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,286
Absolutely outrageous!

247
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:14,440
So you want to fly, huh?

248
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,483
Well, it ain't going to be easy. And
it ain't going to happen overnight.

249
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:21,401
Flying takes three things:
hard work,

250
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,479
perseverance and

251
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:27,436
hard work.
- You said "hard work" twice!

252
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:30,805
Because it takes twice as much
hard work as perseverance.

253
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:33,960
Codswallop!

254
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,517
Cocky Yanks
think they know it all.

255
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:41,565
The most important thing is
we have to work as a team.

256
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:45,524
Which means,
you do everything l tell you.

257
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:51,522
Let's rock 'n roll.

258
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,599
The chickens are ...

259
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:34,921
... pecking?

260
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:38,477
And left, two, three.

261
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:40,525
And right, two, three.

262
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,406
And stop right there.

263
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,919
Yes, down.

264
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:48,081
Make little circles.

265
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:49,920
Faster.

266
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,919
Oh, that's the spot!

267
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,886
l thought
you were going to teach us to fly.

268
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,357
That's what l'm doing.

269
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,361
lsn't there usually
some flapping involved?

270
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,318
Do l tell you how to lay eggs?

271
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:20,036
Relax.
We're making progress.

272
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:23,803
Really? l can't help feeling
we're going around in circles.

273
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:29,166
Hey, cut it out!
You're making me dizzy.

274
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:31,444
They're ready to fly now.

275
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:33,803
Good, 'cause they can't walk anymore.

276
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:37,921
Up and at 'em!

277
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:39,396
Let's flap.

278
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:48,355
Let's see if old Attila the Hen
has come to her senses.

279
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:57,765
lt's raining hen!

280
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:06,281
What's this caper, luv?
- We're flying. - Obviously.

281
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:11,356
Flipping hell. Look at this.
- They're going to kill themselves.

282
00:29:12,247 --> 00:29:14,807
Want to watch?
- All right.

283
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,877
Careful of those eggs!

284
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:34,124
Sunny-side up.

285
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,446
Now over easy.

286
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,885
Definitely scrambled.

287
00:29:49,927 --> 00:29:51,918
Poultry in motion.

288
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:07,602
Birds of a feather
flop together.

289
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:14,799
Great work, ladies.

290
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:18,119
The pain you're feeling
is a good thing.

291
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:19,880
Pain is your friend.

292
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:23,802
Just keep the faith ...
Agnes. You'll get there.

293
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,845
You flew four feet today.

294
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:29,557
Yeah, four feet.
From the roof to the ground.

295
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:34,404
All part of the process. Don't worry.
You cheesy little ...

296
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,364
That doesn't sound good.

297
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:42,847
The ground's shaking.
Are we worried?

298
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:44,840
Are we worried?

299
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:53,924
The circus! Quick! Hide me!

300
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:56,079
Hide me!
- Come on.

301
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,806
One isn't awarded a medal

302
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,960
for flapping about like a lunatic.

303
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:04,841
Now see here!
This is an officer's quarters!

304
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,965
ln here!
- Get out of here now!

305
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:09,165
Give it a rest, Pops!

306
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:12,919
What? l shall have you
on charges within the week!

307
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:50,556
Cheers, mate.

308
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:00,322
lt's all in your head.

309
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:11,558
What's all this?

310
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,798
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.

311
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,641
No more wasting time
with petty egg collection

312
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:19,277
and minuscule profits.
- No eggs?

313
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,247
We've always been egg farmers.
My father,

314
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:25,002
his father and their fathers.
They were always ...

315
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,683
Poor! Worthless! Nothings!

316
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:30,679
But that's about to change.

317
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:34,045
This will take Tweedy's farm
out of the Dark Ages

318
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:37,962
and into full-scale
automated production.

319
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,720
Melisha Tweedy
will be poor no longer.

320
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:48,443
l'll put it together,
shall l?

321
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:57,479
That isn't good.
Whatever's in those boxes is for us.

322
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,684
And l doubt it's softer than hay.

323
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:02,203
l hate to be the voice of doom,

324
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:06,839
but l've been calculating.
l don't think we're built for flying.

325
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:10,398
But l saw him!
He flew in over that fence!

326
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,445
l believe you,

327
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:16,601
but if we could see it for ourselves
it might answer some questions.

328
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:20,956
You're right. We've been at this
all week. We're getting nowhere.

329
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:25,485
lf his wing were better ...
l'll talk to him.

330
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:33,486
Where is he?

331
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,685
They didn't give me this medal
for being a Yank nanny.

332
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,957
"l don't know" would suffice.

333
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:43,439
Beware of that one,
young Ginger.

334
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:46,156
That Yank is not to be trusted.

335
00:33:46,927 --> 00:33:49,964
That Yank
is our ticket out of here.

336
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:54,201
And the pig says to the horse,
"Why the long face?"

337
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,395
Cocktail!

338
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,037
Give over!

339
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:11,759
So anyway ...

340
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:15,161
Remember those flying tips.

341
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,240
They're very important.
And think flighty thoughts.

342
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:23,000
They're swell chicks.

343
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:27,002
Look what Babs made me. A beak warmer.
lsn't that cute?

344
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:32,481
And that Bunty.
She really packs a pun.

345
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:33,922
A problem?

346
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:37,558
Have we flown over the fence?
- Not quite. - There's a problem.

347
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,639
Good things come to those who wait.

348
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:53,886
How long did it take you?
- To do what? - To learn to fly.

349
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,006
Apples and oranges.
l'm gifted, they're not.

350
00:34:57,407 --> 00:35:01,446
You can't compare the two.
These things take time.

351
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:05,840
Which we're running out of. Why
haven't we lifted off yet? - Thrust.

352
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:10,280
l went over my calculations.
What we're missing is thrust.

353
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:15,360
l didn't get a word of that.

354
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:19,680
Thrust. When ducks and geese take off,
what do they have?

355
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:22,117
She ain't using real words.

356
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:25,041
She said we need more thrust.
- Thrust!

357
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:28,962
Sure. Thrust and flying
are like this.

358
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,516
Flying and thrust.

359
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,758
Will you excuse us?

360
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:35,476
The wing!

361
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:38,845
No results by tomorrow,
and the deal's off.

362
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:43,798
No more hiding. The farmers'll find
you and back to the circus, fly boy.

363
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:47,244
You're the first chick l ever met
with the shell still on.

364
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:52,560
Sleep tight, angel face.
The Rock's on the case.

365
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:06,285
What? What?

366
00:36:08,007 --> 00:36:09,599
A beaut. A fine piece of work.

367
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:12,237
lf l do say so myself.

368
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:15,207
l say so myself, too.
- Wish l'd seen it.

369
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:19,282
We slipped into the farmer's room.
- Like a fish.

370
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:20,802
And we ...

371
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:23,366
Like a fish?

372
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:26,042
You stupid idiot!

373
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,085
Anyway, here it is.

374
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,523
El merchandiso!
- That's Spanish.

375
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:32,724
What're these two crooks doing here?

376
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:36,722
So, you know each other!
- She don't think we're valuable.

377
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:38,526
You guys are

378
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:42,283
the sneakiest,
thieving parasites l've ever met.

379
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:46,077
Don't. Stop it.
- l've gone bright red.

380
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,966
So, how about the eggs?

381
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:50,085
Eggs? You promised them ...

382
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,682
Yep, l promised them
every egg l lay this month.

383
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,885
When can we expect
the first one?

384
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:59,484
l'm brewing one up now.
l'll keep you posted.

385
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,481
A pleasure doing business
with you.

386
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:05,561
Sucker.

387
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:09,279
What?
- You lied to them.

388
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:13,919
l didn't lie, dollface.
l just omitted certain truths.

389
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:17,444
l'll give them what l promised.
- Nothing. - Which they'll get.

390
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:19,917
And what will you give us?

391
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:22,565
Thrust.

392
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:26,644
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.

393
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:33,436
Now this will get you going.
lt's a thrust exercise.

394
00:37:33,847 --> 00:37:37,078
The tension's killing me.
- lt's gonna kill her.

395
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:38,522
Release!

396
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:45,883
Come on, flap!

397
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,039
You can do it. Flap!

398
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,206
ls that your first of-fence?

399
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:19,439
Roll call!

400
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,366
l haven't laid any eggs.

401
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,883
Three days, not one.

402
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:27,846
Why didn't you tell us?
- l was so busy flying ...

403
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:29,965
They're coming!
- Hide me!

404
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:32,278
Hide yourself!

405
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,199
Double their food rations.

406
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:36,436
l want them all as fat as this one.

407
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:44,084
All of my life
flashed before my eyes.

408
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:46,920
lt was really boring.

409
00:39:49,527 --> 00:39:50,596
Chicken feed!

410
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,839
My favorite!

411
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:54,596
Wait!

412
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:02,636
No, wait!

413
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:07,559
Babs, please! Bunty.

414
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:09,844
Stop it! Wait!

415
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:11,726
Stop!

416
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:17,996
Stop it!

417
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:23,602
Something is wrong here.
Can't you see that?

418
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:28,405
Strange boxes arrive.
Babs stops laying,

419
00:40:28,807 --> 00:40:31,082
but she isn't taken to the chop.
Extra food.

420
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:34,399
Don't you see?
They're fattening us up.

421
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,286
They're going to kill us all!

422
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:41,558
Heavy alert!

423
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:46,320
She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind? - Save some for me.

424
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,319
What are you doing?

425
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:50,276
Let go!

426
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:54,646
l've met some hard-boiled eggs before,
but you're about 20 minutes.

427
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:57,607
Meaning what?
- Meaning, lighten up.

428
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:00,919
ln America we have a rule:
To motivate someone,

429
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:02,726
don't mention death!

430
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:06,484
Funny. Over here the rule is:
Always tell the truth!

431
00:41:06,887 --> 00:41:08,798
lt's been working like a charm.

432
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:12,756
You want them to perform,
tell them what they want to hear.

433
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:14,805
You mean lie?

434
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:16,640
Here we go again.

435
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:20,357
Know what your problem is?
You're ... difficult.

436
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:22,564
Why? Because l'm honest?

437
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:26,516
l care about them.
Something the Lone Free-Ranger

438
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:30,442
doesn't know about.
- Then l hope you never care about me.

439
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:33,077
l never will.
- Good. - Fine.

440
00:42:21,327 --> 00:42:22,601
What's all this?

441
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:26,725
Here she is.
Ask and you shall receive.

442
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:30,045
That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship.

443
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,846
Solid as a rock.

444
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:35,966
lt's supposed to do that.

445
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,240
Perfect, guys.

446
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:40,206
How's that egg coming?

447
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:43,485
This is a double yolker.

448
00:42:52,247 --> 00:42:54,920
l don't see what it has to do with ...
- You will.

449
00:42:55,887 --> 00:43:00,165
We've been working hard. Let's relax
and shake those tail feathers.

450
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:03,604
Look at him!
Nellpodging around like a ...

451
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:04,962
Good heavens!

452
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:06,482
What's happening?

453
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,957
That's called a beat. Feel it

454
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:11,722
pulsing through your body?

455
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:13,879
Oh yes. Who'd have guessed?

456
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:16,118
Then go with it, baby!

457
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:21,765
Look, l'm going with it!

458
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,123
Bunty, what's got into you?

459
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:26,563
Same thing that's got into you.

460
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:31,325
Just go with the flow.

461
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,279
l don't recall
authorizing a hop.

462
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,405
Shut up and dance.

463
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:54,559
What are you sobbing about,
you nancy?

464
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,605
Little moments like this ...

465
00:43:57,007 --> 00:44:00,204
it's what makes the job
all worthwhile.

466
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:05,040
Want to dance?

467
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:09,396
Yeah, all right.

468
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:55,400
Did you see that? l flew!

469
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:57,923
Atta girl, Babsy! Atta girl.

470
00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:00,842
Your wing! lt's better!

471
00:45:02,247 --> 00:45:03,839
How about that?
- Fantastic!

472
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:07,125
You can fly for us tomorrow.

473
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:09,404
Yeah, so it seems.

474
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,559
l flew!

475
00:45:13,007 --> 00:45:14,963
l owe you an apology.

476
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:18,165
l didn't think you cared,
but after all this ...

477
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:20,956
Well, it seems l was wrong.

478
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:23,757
Easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.

479
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:26,203
l might think you're turning soft.

480
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:34,559
Listen.
l have to tell you something.

481
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,676
No! You'd better wait.

482
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:11,165
That's champion ...
What is it?

483
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:14,035
A pie machine, you idiot. Chickens

484
00:46:14,447 --> 00:46:18,599
go in. Pies come out.
- What kind of pies?

485
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:19,996
Apple.

486
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:21,237
My favorite.

487
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:26,243
Chicken pies, you lummox!
lmagine:

488
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:31,562
ln less than a fortnight, every grocer
will be stocked with boxes

489
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:35,596
of Mrs. Tweedy's
Homemade Chicken Pies.

490
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:40,205
Just "Mrs."? - Woman's touch.
Makes the public feel comfortable.

491
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,203
Oh, right. How does it work?

492
00:46:43,607 --> 00:46:46,440
Get me a chicken,
and l'll show you.

493
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,116
l know just the one.

494
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:56,686
l've got a score to settle with you.

495
00:46:57,087 --> 00:46:59,157
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!

496
00:47:04,247 --> 00:47:07,045
We mustn't panic! We mustn't panic!

497
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:13,685
Quiet, l say!
Let's have some discipline!

498
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:16,476
The enemy has a prisoner.
This calls

499
00:47:16,887 --> 00:47:21,005
for retaliation! Retaliation!
- What's going on?

500
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:24,922
They got Ginger.
They're taking her to the chop!

501
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:26,999
What are you waiting for, laddie?

502
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:28,760
Fly over there. Save her.

503
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:31,237
Of course! No!

504
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:35,526
Just what they'd expect.
Give them the old element of surprise!

505
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:38,566
And catch Jerry
with his trousers down!

506
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:40,559
l like that. What's the plan?

507
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:42,923
The plan ...

508
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,840
The plan ... Babs!

509
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:48,045
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.

510
00:48:01,927 --> 00:48:03,918
Look at the size of that thing.

511
00:48:08,127 --> 00:48:09,162
Oh, no.

512
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,645
Chickens go in,

513
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:14,806
pies come out.

514
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:21,242
Chicken pies. Not apple pies.

515
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:23,080
Chicken!

516
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,323
Great! Brilliant!

517
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:33,762
Yo! Baby doll!

518
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:36,439
l'm coming!
- Hurry!

519
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:41,444
l'm still coming!
- Come on! Stop this thing!

520
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:43,520
l'm getting there.

521
00:48:46,327 --> 00:48:47,521
Shoot!

522
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:52,117
l'll be down before you can say ...

523
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:54,280
mixed vegetables?

524
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:16,636
D'oh! Get it?

525
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:18,685
Dough.
- l'm stuck!

526
00:49:19,087 --> 00:49:20,406
Nothing to it.

527
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:37,556
Hang on.

528
00:49:42,807 --> 00:49:43,796
Look out.

529
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:17,842
lt's like an oven in here.

530
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,836
Come on!

531
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:32,196
Wait!

532
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:34,560
Go over to the ...

533
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:47,599
The door! Come on!

534
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:13,079
She's gonna blow! Run!

535
00:51:17,847 --> 00:51:21,760
What did you do,
you great pudding? - Nothing.

536
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,640
Turn it off!
- lt won't turn off!

537
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,083
We've got to show the others. Come on!

538
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:09,838
Look. l fixed it.

539
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,958
Chicken pies?

540
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,956
Yes, but ...

541
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:20,756
l don't want to be a pie!

542
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,998
l don't like gravy.

543
00:52:23,887 --> 00:52:26,162
Ladies,
let's not lose our heads.

544
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:27,761
Lose our heads?

545
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:40,438
What l meant was, Rocky sabotaged
the machine and bought us more time.

546
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:44,443
And better still,
he's going to fly for us tomorrow.

547
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:47,520
Once we see how,
l know we'll get it.

548
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:52,637
So don't worry. Tomorrow everything
is going to go much smoother.

549
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:04,757
Alright, Pops,
what did l do now?

550
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:07,158
A very brave and honorable deed.

551
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:12,479
ln the light of your action today,

552
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:16,323
l dutifully admit
that l misjudged your character.

553
00:53:17,847 --> 00:53:20,315
l present you
with this medal for bravery.

554
00:53:22,807 --> 00:53:24,957
And l salute you.

555
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:30,001
ln honor of this occasion,

556
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,762
l surrender the bunk entirely.

557
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:36,079
l shall sleep under the stars.

558
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:44,639
l await tomorrow's flying
demonstration with great anticipation.

559
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:49,437
You and me both, Pops.

560
00:53:58,927 --> 00:54:01,043
Oh, were you ...?
- ls this your ...?

561
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,484
Since you're here ...
- l'm glad you're here ...

562
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:07,276
You go first.
- You go ahead.

563
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:13,600
l just wanted to say, l may have been
a bit harsh at first ...

564
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:16,999
What l really mean is ...

565
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:18,682
thank you

566
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:21,237
for saving my life.

567
00:54:21,647 --> 00:54:23,763
For saving our lives.

568
00:54:24,287 --> 00:54:27,597
You know,
l come up here every night

569
00:54:28,007 --> 00:54:32,000
and look at that hill, imagining
what it's like on the other side.

570
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:34,478
lt's funny ...

571
00:54:34,887 --> 00:54:38,766
l've never actually felt grass
beneath my feet. l'm sorry.

572
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:43,003
l'm rambling on about grass,
and you had something to say.

573
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:48,437
lt's just that ...

574
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:52,642
life, as l've experienced it,
out there

575
00:54:53,047 --> 00:54:55,356
lone free-ranging and stuff ...

576
00:54:55,847 --> 00:54:58,315
lt's full of disappointments.

577
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:01,116
So grass isn't all
it's cracked up to be?

578
00:55:01,527 --> 00:55:05,998
Grass! Exactly.
lt's always greener on the other side.

579
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:08,443
And then you get there,

580
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,396
and it's brown and prickly.
See what l'm saying?

581
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:18,318
What l'm trying to say is ...

582
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:23,879
you're welcome.

583
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:29,920
You know, that hill is looking closer
tonight than it ever has before.

584
00:55:35,487 --> 00:55:38,285
Good night, Rocky.

585
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:40,837
Good night,

586
00:55:41,527 --> 00:55:42,880
Ginger.

587
00:56:05,247 --> 00:56:08,796
Company, attention!

588
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:17,876
Today's the day, girls.
We're going to fly. l can feel it.

589
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:22,440
Finally, we get to see
a professional in action.

590
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:25,077
Start warming up. l'll go get him.

591
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:27,683
Rocky? Knock, knock.

592
00:56:28,087 --> 00:56:30,317
Everyone's waiting, so l told them ...

593
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:18,282
A cannon.

594
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:22,077
That'd give you a thrust.
- l knew he was fake all along.

595
00:58:22,487 --> 00:58:25,763
ln fact, l'm not even sure
if he was American.

596
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:29,040
What's the next plan?

597
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:34,724
Face it. The only way we get out
is wrapped in pastry.

598
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:39,402
Perhaps he just went on holiday.
- Perhaps he left to get away

599
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,002
from your infernal knitting!

600
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,002
You always hit him.
See how you like it.

601
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:49,804
Don't push me, four-eyes!

602
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:52,840
Quiet!

603
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:55,636
Quiet, l say! Dissention

604
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:59,676
in the ranks. Just what Jerry wants.
The old divide and conquer.

605
00:59:00,087 --> 00:59:01,964
A proper squadron work together,

606
00:59:02,367 --> 00:59:04,676
just like we did in my RAF days.

607
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:09,046
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map,
and Whizzbang at the tail-end Charlie.

608
00:59:09,447 --> 00:59:13,281
Wingco would give the call, hop in
the old crate, chocks away!

609
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:15,803
That's how you get medals!

610
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:20,844
Will you shut up
about your stupid bloomin' medals!

611
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,603
How dare you!

612
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:32,645
Forgive me.
As an officer ...

613
00:59:53,847 --> 00:59:56,645
Everyone, shut up!

614
01:00:07,127 --> 01:00:09,004
What exactly is the RAF?

615
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:11,075
What do you mean?

616
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:13,955
The Royal Air Force is what.

617
01:00:14,367 --> 01:00:17,279
Then what's the "old crate"?

618
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,925
There she is!

619
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:27,561
Gorgeous, isn't she? - You mean,
you flew? ln one of these?

620
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:31,482
Beautifully built. ln fact,
there's a bit of a story there.

621
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:36,119
We were on a reconnaissance flight,
when the weather duffed up.

622
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:39,325
Yes ... of course.

623
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:41,962
We may be able to pull this off.

624
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,961
We're still flying out of here.

625
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:49,201
Fowler's provided the answer.
- l have?

626
01:00:49,607 --> 01:00:51,563
Oh, yes. Of course l have.

627
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:53,876
How have l?

628
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:56,926
We'll make a crate.

629
01:00:58,047 --> 01:00:59,036
Mac,

630
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,039
you'll handle engineering.

631
01:01:01,447 --> 01:01:02,800
Babs, manufacturing.

632
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:05,323
Fowler is
chief aviation adviser.

633
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:07,001
Bunty, eggs.

634
01:01:07,407 --> 01:01:08,601
Eggs?

635
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:11,475
Right. Like the ones
the rooster was going to lay.

636
01:01:11,887 --> 01:01:14,526
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?

637
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:19,000
Don't they? - lt's a lady thing,
apparently. Ask your mum.

638
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:21,443
One egg per item on the list.

639
01:01:21,847 --> 01:01:25,396
First payment in advance.
- Right. When do we start?

640
01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:39,205
What the dickens?

641
01:01:42,127 --> 01:01:43,799
Oh, gnomes now!

642
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:37,686
Eggs from heaven!
- No, from her bum.

643
01:03:08,327 --> 01:03:09,442
ldiot!

644
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,596
That was close. Too close.

645
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:17,680
We can't stop now.
Everyone, go for it.

646
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:18,956
Go, go!

647
01:03:22,047 --> 01:03:24,083
Mac! We need the calculations quick.

648
01:03:24,487 --> 01:03:26,637
Agnes, that has to be really secure.

649
01:03:27,047 --> 01:03:29,242
Careful up there, Fowler!

650
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:33,398
Bunty, give him a hand.
Well done, Babs. Keep it up!

651
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:36,037
No problem, dollface.

652
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:20,281
Ah, boy.

653
01:04:26,647 --> 01:04:27,966
Come on.

654
01:04:30,247 --> 01:04:31,316
Please!

655
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:37,082
Oh, no.

656
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:38,602
He's fixed it.

657
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:46,438
Get the chickens.

658
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:48,116
Which ones?

659
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:50,720
All of them!

660
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,716
My tools!

661
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:02,765
Thieving little buggers.

662
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:05,165
What's the plan?

663
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:09,437
Attack!

664
01:05:12,087 --> 01:05:13,315
Nice plan.

665
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:24,684
The chickens are revolting!

666
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,647
Finally, something we agree on.

667
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:29,036
Help!

668
01:05:34,527 --> 01:05:36,165
Under the hut!

669
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:46,042
What have we done?
- This is it.

670
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:47,880
We're escaping!

671
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,276
What? Now?

672
01:05:49,807 --> 01:05:50,637
Now!

673
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,277
But she's not ready.
- Listen!

674
01:05:53,687 --> 01:05:56,724
We either die free chickens
or die trying.

675
01:05:59,407 --> 01:06:01,967
Are those the only choices?
- Let's do it!

676
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,482
Scramble!

677
01:06:54,207 --> 01:06:57,324
The exits are located here and here.

678
01:06:57,727 --> 01:07:01,436
ln the likely event of an emergency,
put your head between your knees ...

679
01:07:01,847 --> 01:07:03,917
... and kiss your bum goodbye.

680
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:06,079
Okay, Fowler. Ready for takeoff.

681
01:07:07,047 --> 01:07:08,799
Behind you all the way.

682
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:14,199
You're supposed to be up there.
You're the pilot!

683
01:07:14,727 --> 01:07:18,003
Don't be ridiculous.
l can't fly this contraption.

684
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:21,046
But back in your day ...
the Royal Air Force.

685
01:07:21,447 --> 01:07:25,759
644 Squadron, poultry division.
We were the mascots.

686
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,317
You mean you never flew the plane?

687
01:07:28,727 --> 01:07:31,685
Good heavens, no. l'm a chicken.

688
01:07:33,647 --> 01:07:38,004
The Royal Air Force doesn't let
chickens fly a complex aircraft!

689
01:07:38,407 --> 01:07:41,558
We're all gonna die.
- Fowler, you have to fly it.

690
01:07:41,967 --> 01:07:44,037
You always talk about
"back in your day."

691
01:07:44,447 --> 01:07:46,403
Well, today is your day.

692
01:07:48,047 --> 01:07:50,925
You can do it, you old sausage.

693
01:07:53,567 --> 01:07:56,684
Wing Commander T.l.Fowler,
reporting for duty.

694
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:04,479
What're you waiting for?
Let's get this crate off the ground!

695
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:07,166
Fowler, now!

696
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:09,478
Roger! Contact!

697
01:08:21,207 --> 01:08:22,799
Cleared for takeoff!

698
01:08:29,727 --> 01:08:31,080
Chocks away!

699
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:41,802
Full throttle!

700
01:09:04,967 --> 01:09:06,605
We need more power!

701
01:09:07,007 --> 01:09:08,406
l can't work miracles.

702
01:09:08,807 --> 01:09:10,843
We're givin' her all she's got!

703
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,397
Gotcha!

704
01:09:20,807 --> 01:09:22,081
Hard right!

705
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:25,965
Oh, mother.

706
01:09:31,527 --> 01:09:33,597
Turn her around.
l'll get the ramp.

707
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:49,161
Put the ramp down!

708
01:09:52,207 --> 01:09:54,675
You are going to be a pie.

709
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:28,798
Look out!

710
01:10:29,207 --> 01:10:30,401
Clear the runway!

711
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:52,196
Let's go!

712
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,277
We're flying!

713
01:11:11,687 --> 01:11:12,836
That's for leaving.

714
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,962
And this is for coming back.

715
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,839
Great Scott! What was that?

716
01:11:24,247 --> 01:11:25,521
A cling-on!

717
01:11:25,927 --> 01:11:28,236
The engines can't take it!

718
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,120
My goodness!

719
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:34,926
Babs! Scissors!

720
01:11:38,967 --> 01:11:41,720
Lower me down.
- But ... - Just do it.

721
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:43,719
lncrease velocity!

722
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,722
What's that mean?
- Pedal your flippin' giblets out!

723
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:02,363
Lower!
- l'm trying!

724
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:10,966
Look out!

725
01:12:30,287 --> 01:12:32,039
Fire! Fire!

726
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:35,596
My eggs!

727
01:12:45,767 --> 01:12:46,961
More ammo! Hurry!

728
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:49,198
We got no more eggs!

729
01:12:49,607 --> 01:12:50,801
Look out!

730
01:12:58,767 --> 01:13:00,041
No!

731
01:13:17,247 --> 01:13:18,475
Bombs away!

732
01:13:18,887 --> 01:13:20,286
Mr. Tweedy!

733
01:13:22,207 --> 01:13:24,163
That was good! That was good!

734
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:28,801
The old bird bought it!

735
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:06,802
l told you they was organized.

736
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:19,361
We did it, everyone!

737
01:14:41,247 --> 01:14:44,284
Keep pedaling. We're not there yet.

738
01:14:48,247 --> 01:14:51,319
You can't see paradise
if you don't pedal.

739
01:14:53,767 --> 01:14:55,758
Put your drumsticks into it.

740
01:14:59,807 --> 01:15:04,961
That's what l told them. We were
losing altitude, heading for ...

741
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:09,726
A lovely holiday.
l'll be sad to go back.

742
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:12,561
Safety at all times is imperative.

743
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,243
Wind her up and let her go.

744
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:17,796
So ...

745
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:21,241
ls it as good as you imagined?
- No.

746
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:24,885
lt's better.

747
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:28,563
l'll show you how to play cricket.

748
01:15:33,407 --> 01:15:35,079
Here's a thought.

749
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:38,120
Let's get an egg
and start our own chicken farm.

750
01:15:38,527 --> 01:15:41,803
We'll have all the eggs we can eat.
- Right.

751
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,404
We'll need a chicken then.
- No, an egg first.

752
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,162
That's where the chicken comes from.

753
01:15:48,567 --> 01:15:51,365
No. Without the chicken
where do you get the egg?

754
01:15:51,767 --> 01:15:54,201
From a chicken ...
that comes from the egg.

755
01:15:54,607 --> 01:15:56,359
But you need an egg to have a chicken.

756
01:15:56,767 --> 01:16:00,316
You got to get the chicken first
to get the egg.

757
01:16:00,727 --> 01:16:02,399
Then you get the chicken.

758
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:04,963
Hang on. Let's go over this again.

759
01:19:25,687 --> 01:19:26,881
The egg, obviously.

760
01:19:27,287 --> 01:19:31,041
Rolling along happily, then crack!
lt hatches the first chicken.

761
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:33,438
But where'd the egg come from?

762
01:19:34,047 --> 01:19:39,075
What do you mean? - Egg comes rolling
along happily and wonders,

763
01:19:39,647 --> 01:19:44,641
where'd it come from without
a chicken? No eggs come rolling along.

764
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:50,241
Without an egg to hatch the chicken
there'll be no chicken

765
01:19:50,847 --> 01:19:55,841
to lay the first egg. - Have we got
2 eggs now? - No, still the first egg.

766
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:59,439
What about the first chicken?
- lt's in the very first egg.

767
01:19:59,847 --> 01:20:01,439
Guys!

768
01:20:02,687 --> 01:20:04,757
l'm trying to enjoy paradise.

769
01:20:05,127 --> 01:20:08,324
Sorry, guv.
- Won't happen again.

770
01:20:08,727 --> 01:20:09,762
Thanks.

771
01:20:10,487 --> 01:20:12,125
Gitface.
- Pillock.

772
01:20:12,727 --> 01:20:15,764
Thinks he's such a big shot,
'cause his name's on a poster.

773
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:18,840
They're all the same.
- The rats are the stars.

774
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:23,360
Yes, we do all the hard work,
and he gets all the credit.

775
01:20:23,767 --> 01:20:27,806
He gets everything. - Everything.
- You said it, mate! - l know.
