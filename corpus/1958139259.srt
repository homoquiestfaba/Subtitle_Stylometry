1
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:23,685
<i>I know You shed tears.</i>

2
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:27,454
<i>I know You continue</i>
<i>to shed tears every day</i>

3
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,157
<i>because of man's ingratitude.</i>

4
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,829
<i>You choose souls,</i>

5
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,398
<i>and despite my unworthiness,</i>
<i>You've chosen me...</i>

6
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,467
<i>to help You.</i>

7
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,670
<i>And the more these souls suffer</i>

8
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,471
<i>without the slightest</i>
<i>consolation,</i>

9
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:47,140
<i>the more Your sufferings</i>
<i>are alleviated...</i>

10
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,848
<i>in this consists all of my joy.</i>

11
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,422
<i>I know You'll give me</i>
<i>what I need,</i>

12
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,159
<i>I know You will not refuse it.</i>

13
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>I need courage.</i>

14
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,334
<i>I know You will provide.</i>

15
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,598
Padre!

16
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:13,728
I'm Pio.

17
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,003
Father.

18
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,016
Franco, Franco, my husband?

19
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,449
Giulio?

20
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,358
Salvato? Giulio?

21
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,460
I don't know.

22
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:29,931
Oreste!

23
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,937
I'm still a man.

24
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm still a man.
I'm back.

25
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,209
<i>Viva l'Italia,</i>
<i>viva l'Italia.</i>

26
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,379
Vincenzo, put him
in a chair, help him.

27
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,330
- I'm back. I'm back.
- Uncle.

28
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,931
- <i>Ciao,</i> Elvira.
- Uncle.

29
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,702
Look at you! My baby!

30
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:11,105
Look at you,
your uncle is back.

31
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,007
Mom, mom. Mom.

32
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,510
San Giovanni Rotondo
welcomes home

33
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,679
his brave
and courageous soldiers.

34
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,449
<i>Viva l'Italia, viva l'Italia!</i>

35
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:31,192
My husband?

36
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,927
I don't know, sorry.

37
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,704
Anna. Anna.

38
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,846
Look at you.

39
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:57,852
Angelo, this is the list
of the dead.

40
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,634
Saponaro Nunzio?

41
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,045
I cannot read.

42
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,454
"I regret to inform you
that your son, Saponaro Nunzio,

43
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:39,492
died from wounds
sustained on 26th October
while fighting on the Carso."

44
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:45,967
We have already lost
one son on the Carso.

45
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,610
Your excellency, my husband?

46
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,446
What is your husband's name?

47
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,681
Giulio. Giulio Leogrande.

48
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:16,163
Hopefully, he will be back
with the next group. Who knows?

49
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,535
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

50
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,428
Cheers, yeah, cheers.

51
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,797
Look, instead of my eye.

52
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:52,266
We won!

53
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:56,237
Wine, man, wine.
<i>Viva l'Italia!</i>

54
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,472
- <i>Viva l'Italia!</i>
- Yeah!

55
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,074
Yeah!

56
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:01,575
<i>Un brindisi.</i>

57
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,543
<i>- Sì!</i>
<i>- Sì!</i>

58
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,278
Yeah!

59
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,423
The sorrows
for Italy and for the world

60
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:51,425
is not finished.

61
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:54,128
Every people
is still suffering of that

62
00:09:54,228 --> 00:10:00,167
and every families
are in grief or big sorrow.

63
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,602
It's terrible.

64
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:04,872
The king...

65
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,675
Uh...

66
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,013
Some intellectuals,
some interested in the...

67
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,016
in the armies, militaries...

68
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,353
Uh...

69
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:27,294
Have convinced other people
to make war or compel them

70
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,234
And the majority of Italians...

71
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,039
do not want war.

72
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,676
Christ...

73
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,180
offered Himself,

74
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,451
with His body,

75
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:53,387
with His flesh to the Father,

76
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,959
in similar way
we offer of our self,

77
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,295
our bodies,

78
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:03,731
our flesh

79
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,699
to God

80
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,904
in, uh, union with Christ.

81
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:14,875
Sometimes this is suffering,
sometimes not,

82
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:18,345
but the suffering
in union with Christ

83
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:21,749
is a door to the Heaven.

84
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:27,821
This em-- suffering lived alone

85
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,324
is a door to Hell.

86
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:44,639
So...

87
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,308
you managed to avoid
going to war.

88
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:52,479
You tried so hard

89
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,883
and you finally succeeded.

90
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:03,991
I'm ill.

91
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,863
If I wasn't, I'd be there.

92
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:18,239
You are no more than
a whimsical child
crying for his mother.

93
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,746
My mother is the Madonna.

94
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,082
Liar.

95
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,919
The letters you wrote
to your devoted followers,

96
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,422
that's what get you out
of your military service.

97
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:36,490
No.

98
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,093
Is that your little Madonna?

99
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:47,401
Tell me, where you weeping
when you wrote this?

100
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,770
Was your hand quivering?

101
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,375
"I also must ask you a favor.

102
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:59,714
I would very much like for you
to write to Donna Giovina Cevera

103
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,684
in order for her
to put in a good word

104
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,419
with these butcher superiors."

105
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:09,990
"Butchers"?

106
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:21,302
Those officers were doing
their duty. No more, no less.

107
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:25,139
And to you they are butchers?

108
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:32,246
I'm not scared of you.

109
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,859
I'm protected
by the blood of Christ.

110
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,143
- You're a coward.
- No.

111
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,613
- You're a little boy.
- No.

112
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,448
No courage.

113
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,950
You ask others to have courage.

114
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:12,252
A coward.

115
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,356
- A piss-drenched coward.
- No.

116
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,995
Let's talk about
a real coward.

117
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:27,267
Let's talk about the trust,
the few that loved you,

118
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,104
and the trust
you fucking abused,

119
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,707
the fucking countless women
you fucking had,

120
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:35,476
- your narcissistic...
- No... No.

121
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:36,977
- ...way with--
- No.

122
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,446
- But here's where
it gets better.
- Shh!

123
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,549
You stop now, you stop now.

124
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,884
- In a few months--
- You say "Christ is Lord."

125
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,486
You say "Christ is Lord."

126
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:48,055
- In a few--
- You say "Christ is Lord!"

127
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,924
Christ is Lord!
You say "Christ is Lord!"

128
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,694
You say "Christ is Lord!"

129
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,662
You say it! Say it!

130
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,897
Say "Christ is Lord!"

131
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,567
Christ is Lord!
You say "Christ is Lord!"

132
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:51,178
The primary source
of all human oppression
and exploitation

133
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,280
is individual property.

134
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,283
Oppression,
you know what it is?

135
00:16:56,383 --> 00:17:01,221
Oppression means cruel
and unjust treatment.

136
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,057
It's what happened to you.

137
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:08,295
You work hard
every day, right?

138
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:11,566
You work all day or not?

139
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,034
Do you ever stop?

140
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,606
This is not right,
this is not fair.

141
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:22,877
Exploitation means
that you're not the one

142
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:25,513
who takes the benefit
from your work.

143
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,321
"In nature, everything
is transformed.

144
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:38,425
Nothing is created
and nothing is destroyed.

145
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,995
Following this natural law

146
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,429
that wants transformation

147
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,833
is the struggle for existence
and the revolution."

148
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,974
Nature is a cycle
of constant change.

149
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,109
The way Spring arrives
after Winter,

150
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,079
or the way...

151
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,717
the calf grows
into the milk-giving cow.

152
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:26,106
You know that, right?

153
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,309
That's what I'm saying.

154
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,447
We need change.

155
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,653
Change is a natural law.

156
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,924
The land and everything
it gives us

157
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:44,324
belongs to everybody.

158
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,226
- Yes.
- And one family can't control

159
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,228
- San Giovanni Rotondo.
- Yeah, that's true.

160
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,130
Yeah, that's true.

161
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,265
What is he talking about?

162
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:57,437
He's talking about
how we can get control
of our lives.

163
00:18:58,106 --> 00:18:59,741
I'm talking about freedom.

164
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:04,078
To have freedom, we must stop
the exploitation by the masters.

165
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,312
Exploitation?

166
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,381
You spent your life in school.

167
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,751
What are you saying?

168
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,351
You are an Alberizzi,

169
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,286
you're part
of a landowner family.

170
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,322
- Calm.
- That's true.

171
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:20,762
How was life in Bologna
while we fought to protect you?

172
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:22,563
Is this not a contradiction?

173
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,769
You want to talk
about contradictions?

174
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,405
You won right?

175
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,741
But what did you win?

176
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:40,615
This war led to nothing.
Our sacrifices led to nothing.

177
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:45,887
Where's your husband?

178
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:50,825
She doesn't know.

179
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:54,862
Bring me a candle.

180
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:08,776
If a candle gives you light,

181
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,781
do not curse the candle.

182
00:20:57,525 --> 00:21:00,494
Welcome, comrade.
Welcome back.

183
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:01,963
How's everyone?

184
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:05,900
Please.

185
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:35,596
Please, have a seat.

186
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:38,365
Have a seat.

187
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:56,951
I introduce you to Luigi.

188
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:59,654
He's our young,
radical comrade.

189
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:02,355
Pleasure.

190
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,457
My pleasure.

191
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:11,065
Now, in San Giovanni,

192
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,100
they say that
I'm a revolutionary,

193
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:17,805
a fire starter, it's true.

194
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:19,907
But it's consciences
I want to set fire to.

195
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:23,778
Yes, but let's focus
on winning the elections now.

196
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:26,113
We need to speak
of winning votes.

197
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:29,951
Do you think Lenin and Trotsky
cared about elections?

198
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:37,058
Socialism is a process.

199
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:40,928
So, comrades...

200
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,031
You must be careful
how you interpret

201
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:47,168
the great Russian revolution.

202
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:51,005
The world is not transformed

203
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:55,910
by following the plans
that a prophet writes on paper

204
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,079
or preaches to the masses.

205
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:05,385
Their socialism is not ours.

206
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,856
Social revolution...

207
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:12,693
is not the creation

208
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,495
of one man's will.

209
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:19,533
Lenin is neither a leader
nor a prophet.

210
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:21,401
He's a politician.

211
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,940
So... comrades,

212
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,245
we will not take power
with violence,

213
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:34,682
but with the consent
of the masses.

214
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:40,955
We put our flag in good hands

215
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:42,189
and we win.

216
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:51,532
Raised high...

217
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:54,201
...for-- for all to see.

218
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:08,082
Yeah.

219
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:05,740
What's going on?

220
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,663
Look at me.

221
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:41,869
We're not interested
in people like you in my town.

222
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:45,940
Do you understand me?

223
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,677
Now leave
and don't come back.

224
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,679
Get him in the car.

225
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:55,249
Let's go
to the car, come on.

226
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:04,325
Get out of here, asshole.

227
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:06,127
Get out of here, asshole.

228
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,295
Go.

229
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:17,338
Don't come back.

230
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:09,416
<i>My dearest</i>
<i>Father Benedetto...</i>

231
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,019
<i>If I could fly,</i>

232
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:14,455
<i>I'd like to shout.</i>

233
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:18,660
<i>I'd like to cry out to everyone</i>
<i>at the top of my voice.</i>

234
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,562
<i>Love Jesus.</i>

235
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:24,431
<i>Love him who's</i>
<i>so deserving of love.</i>

236
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,900
<i>But alas, my dear Father,</i>

237
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,638
<i>my soul is still strongly</i>
<i>bound to the body</i>

238
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:33,474
<i>and many are the sins which</i>
<i>impede the flight of my soul.</i>

239
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:37,011
<i>If you could pray that</i>
<i>the Lord might be pleased</i>

240
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:38,647
<i>to shorten my exile,</i>

241
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,349
<i>and explain to me the origin</i>
<i>of this blind desire I have</i>

242
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,151
<i>to depart from this life,</i>

243
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:46,521
<i>I'd appreciate it.</i>

244
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:51,158
<i>My sins are many</i>
<i>and they ought to check</i>
<i>my blind passion.</i>

245
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:55,095
<i>I ponder over them, yet,</i>

246
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,266
<i>I feel more and more attracted</i>

247
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:02,336
<i>by the desire to take flight</i>
<i>from this world.</i>

248
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,273
<i>Do you recognize this?</i>

249
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:09,443
<i>Is this the work of the ogre?</i>

250
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,481
<i>Please keep me</i>
<i>continually warned.</i>

251
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:12,399
These used to belong
to that poor little girl.

252
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,675
Her mother asked me
to repair them.

253
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:24,646
She won't be
needing them anymore.

254
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,049
And what was her fault?
To be born poor?

255
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:34,656
In the gospel it is written

256
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:37,559
that it will be very difficult
for a rich man

257
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:40,160
to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,

258
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,264
while Marx said so too,
in his own way.

259
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,870
You're talking about
the Kingdom of Heaven,

260
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:51,004
but here we live in hell.

261
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:53,240
I walk alone among them,

262
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,242
in front of their ailments,

263
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:57,712
their cries, their problems,

264
00:32:57,812 --> 00:32:59,146
most unsolvable.

265
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:01,716
Here we need water,
we need a hospital.

266
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:04,652
The little kid died because
I could not get the medicine

267
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:06,420
I needed to save her.

268
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:08,823
We need to change things.

269
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:10,892
But we, the socialists,
are divided.

270
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,927
We are against each other.

271
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:17,197
Luigi wants to talk about
the brotherhood of the workers,

272
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:20,501
but here we only have
the unemployed.

273
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:24,137
And most of them
can neither read or write.

274
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,075
I know it is hard.

275
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,012
We are divided,

276
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,183
but you do not despair,

277
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,587
because whoever
is not with you

278
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:42,356
is not necessarily
against you.

279
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,192
Call them friends,

280
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,028
if not brothers.

281
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:51,599
And remember the words
of the poor carpenter

282
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:56,236
when he said, "There is
no greater love than this,

283
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:59,741
to give one's life
for one's friends."

284
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,309
Friends, huh...

285
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:06,881
Even shoes are divided
according to their social class.

286
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:28,970
<i>I feel that sometimes</i>

287
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,572
<i>when I'm in the midst of prayer</i>

288
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,339
<i>that I'm just...</i>

289
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,976
<i>that I feel alone like I'm...</i>

290
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:37,377
<i>I feel not alone like lonely,</i>

291
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:41,315
<i>but alone like the Lord</i>
<i>has abandoned me,</i>

292
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:44,619
<i>and I'm essentially</i>
<i>talking to myself.</i>

293
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:49,023
Do you feel in darkness?

294
00:34:49,122 --> 00:34:51,325
Yes, tremendous.

295
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:52,727
Do you feel abandoned?

296
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:53,795
Yes.

297
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:58,265
And scared and baffled
and confused and...

298
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:01,201
and like I'm sinning
but I don't--

299
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:03,705
I don't know
if I'm sinning or not,

300
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:06,074
because it feels like a sin
to the question these things,

301
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:09,811
it feels like a sin
to be angry with the Lord.

302
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:12,780
And I'm angry a lot.

303
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,515
I feel angry a lot.

304
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:19,386
- You know?
- I can tell you,

305
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:21,388
the Lord hasn't
abandoned you.

306
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:24,692
He's with you even
in the midst of darkness.

307
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:30,130
You have to keep
your purer life,

308
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,000
and receiving
the sacraments.

309
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,267
It's the way,
it's the only way

310
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,504
to be able to stay
in the right road.

311
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,840
Without the Lord,
you can't do anything.

312
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,173
I know.

313
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,493
The war...

314
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:04,431
took our two sons
away from us.

315
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:10,938
They were both young.

316
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:15,810
We cannot find a reason
to live anymore.

317
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,747
But if God wanted this,

318
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,416
even Him,

319
00:36:23,383 --> 00:36:25,419
why does He want
to keep us alive?

320
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,523
- To torment us?
- No, no.

321
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,198
War is a terrible thing,
Francesco.

322
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:42,770
And your pain is real, yes.

323
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:47,942
Do not let Satan take
advantage of your suffering.

324
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:50,545
Do you understand?

325
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:53,848
Blessed is the man who
endures the trial, Francesco.

326
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,120
When I was young,

327
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,789
my mother would do
embroidery at home,

328
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,490
yes, sitting in a chair.

329
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:07,528
And, uh, I, sitting in a stool,
looked up at the work...

330
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:13,735
but I would only see it
from upside down.

331
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:16,470
I'd see the knots
and the confused threads,

332
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:18,639
and I'd say to my mother,
"What are you doing?

333
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,874
What is this?

334
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:21,709
Why is it so ugly?"

335
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,277
And my mother,
she would lower the frame,

336
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:26,714
and she would show me
the good side of the work,

337
00:37:26,814 --> 00:37:28,448
and I would see
all of the colors

338
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:30,218
were in the right place

339
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:32,019
and the pattern
was beautiful,

340
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:34,689
precise.

341
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:44,431
I, like you now,
can only see

342
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:48,870
the work from upside down
'cause I was sitting
in a short stool, Francesco.

343
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:58,579
If you lift your spirit
up in prayer,

344
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:03,818
the Lord will show you
the design He has for you.

345
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:32,513
Calm.

346
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,347
Stay calm.

347
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:43,124
What are you guys doing?

348
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:46,527
We are we working the land
that you keep abandoned.

349
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,796
They need it to eat.

350
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:51,999
So if you're not using it,
we have the right to.

351
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:03,476
Socialism alone
will be enough

352
00:39:03,578 --> 00:39:05,345
to create the most
perfect balance

353
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:07,515
between men, order,
and peace,

354
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,817
because human beings,
in their free development,

355
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:12,820
will understand that no man
can be truly free and happy

356
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,023
- if not in the respect
of all humanity.
- What are you guys looking at?

357
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:18,693
Huh? Leave my land now!

358
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:21,829
Get out of here!

359
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:25,566
Leave now!

360
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:28,803
I'm gonna kill you all!

361
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:31,339
Do you hear me? All!

362
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,040
Get out of here!

363
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,242
Luigi, run!

364
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:36,077
- Run! Run!
- Go!

365
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:40,815
Okay? All of you, guys,
this is my land!

366
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:45,753
Hey, Luigi, if you ever
come back here, I shoot you!

367
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:51,172
Listen.

368
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:14,328
Have the courage
to do what you hear.

369
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:54,762
Come on, come on.

370
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:14,081
Work, work.

371
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:23,891
How about your man?

372
00:45:26,427 --> 00:45:27,861
Any news from him?

373
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:34,802
Go and talk
with some other woman,

374
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,403
I have a husband.

375
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:46,981
I go! I go!

376
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:50,251
I go!

377
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:58,492
I go! I go!

378
00:46:54,649 --> 00:46:57,117
Salvatore! Salvatore!

379
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:59,119
- Salvatore!
- Salvatore!

380
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:01,656
Salvatore!

381
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:03,023
Fast, fast!

382
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:07,529
What happened? Salvatore!

383
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:08,862
Salvato!

384
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,580
A doctor!

385
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:03,977
What are you doing?
Go back to work, come on.

386
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:09,216
Vincenzo, don't let anyone in.

387
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:13,655
Doctor's coming, get out.

388
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,057
Out!

389
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:06,173
Poor man, he made it
through the war.

390
00:50:10,678 --> 00:50:12,112
Tell them he's still alive.

391
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,014
What?

392
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:16,483
You go out, you tell them
he's still alive,

393
00:50:16,584 --> 00:50:18,653
or else things
are gonna get ugly here.

394
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:23,123
I'll have no part in this.
This man is dead!

395
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:25,392
I don't care, you tell them
he's still alive,

396
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:28,395
that we need to take him
to the hospital, okay?

397
00:50:29,564 --> 00:50:30,732
I will not.

398
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:34,234
- No?
- No.

399
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:37,204
So if anybody gets hurt
it's on you, okay?

400
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:42,744
Everything is going
to be alright, okay?

401
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:44,444
Now go back to work.

402
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:53,320
I'm not going anywhere.

403
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:55,389
I will wait here.

404
00:50:58,526 --> 00:51:02,095
What are you saying?
Go to work or you go back home.

405
00:51:02,764 --> 00:51:04,197
Come on, go to work.

406
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:08,235
Look how good you are
serving your boss.

407
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:11,071
It's the slave labor
that made him sick.

408
00:51:14,976 --> 00:51:16,143
Go.

409
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:26,521
It's the slave labor
that made him sick.

410
00:51:29,857 --> 00:51:31,025
What are you doing?

411
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:33,061
Go back to work
or I'll send you off,

412
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,629
and I'm not paying you.

413
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:36,731
Go back to work. Go!

414
00:51:37,865 --> 00:51:39,099
Come on!

415
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:52,346
- I'm going home. Fuck your pay.
- Yeah, go home.

416
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:02,356
...the Lord is with thee.

417
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:05,059
Blessed art thou among women

418
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,463
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

419
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,800
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

420
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,636
pray for us sinners,

421
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:16,838
now and at the hour
of our death.

422
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:17,972
Amen.

423
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,811
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

424
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:26,313
Blessed art thou among women

425
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:29,316
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

426
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:33,253
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

427
00:52:33,353 --> 00:52:35,657
...pray for us sinners,

428
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:37,792
now and at the hour
of our death.

429
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:43,230
...full of grace,

430
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,899
the Lord is with thee.

431
00:52:45,465 --> 00:52:47,602
Blessed art thou among women

432
00:52:47,702 --> 00:52:50,505
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

433
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:53,206
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

434
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:55,677
pray for us sinners,

435
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:58,579
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

436
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:13,446
That's the effect
of the poison gas from the war.

437
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:18,252
He never should
have been working.

438
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:20,621
What was he going
to do? Starve?

439
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:24,391
So let's not let him
die in vain. Hm?

440
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:35,435
Hi, Francesco.

441
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:36,737
- Hi.
- How are you?

442
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:39,073
- Mm.
- You gotta be strong, eh?

443
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:40,440
- Thank you.
- You have to be strong.

444
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:42,243
Listen. Have you registered?

445
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:43,578
N-no, not yet.

446
00:55:43,678 --> 00:55:46,413
You need to vote, brother.
You need to vote.

447
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:49,317
It's our opportunity here.
We have to stick together.

448
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:51,586
- Hm?
- I will.

449
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,222
You already registered right?

450
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:55,957
Yeah, we already done, brother.

451
00:55:56,057 --> 00:55:57,258
That's not the point.

452
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:58,759
You still talking
about elections?

453
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,095
- Yeah. What do you think?
- It is important.

454
00:56:02,296 --> 00:56:04,232
It's our opportunity
to act together.

455
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:07,835
It's time we start doing to them
what they have been doing to us.

456
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,572
The two of you
can't come in here.

457
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:13,841
Who says so?

458
00:56:16,244 --> 00:56:18,846
We do.
The socialists.

459
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:21,883
We're all from the same village.

460
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:23,885
Tell your friend
to be ashamed.

461
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:26,654
Tell him he's so friendly
with his masters

462
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:29,389
that now he has become
their lap dog.

463
00:56:32,459 --> 00:56:35,196
That's enough now! Hey!

464
00:56:35,296 --> 00:56:36,831
Pay some respect
for the dead!

465
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:39,233
They have no respect
for the living.

466
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:42,904
And you have no respect
for those who fought
for their country.

467
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:46,707
You mean for your masters,
right?

468
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:49,043
Some raw deal you got.

469
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:55,583
You're gonna pay for that.

470
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,521
I'll be waiting for you.

471
00:57:22,944 --> 00:57:25,680
Don Anselmo,
I wanna show you a thing.

472
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,715
You know, this is custom-made
by my family.

473
00:57:27,815 --> 00:57:30,818
My grandfather gave it to me,
I'm gonna give it to my son.

474
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:32,420
It's a family tradition,
you know?

475
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,656
Hold it, it's a beautiful gun,
beautiful.

476
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:40,561
I know
you like hunting.

477
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:42,730
Why don't you come hunt
with us one day?

478
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:49,804
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

479
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:52,472
- For you, Father.
- Here.

480
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:54,442
- Thank you.
- Give it to me.

481
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,418
- Elvira.
- Yeah?

482
00:58:04,518 --> 00:58:06,554
- Give him the money.
- Oh, okay.

483
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,059
Father,

484
00:58:13,361 --> 00:58:16,564
we want to give you a little
something for the parish.

485
00:58:21,702 --> 00:58:24,271
Next to my heart.

486
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:43,124
- Bruno.
- Gerardo.

487
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:44,792
Let's go upstairs.

488
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:02,009
He's a friend of mine,
Bruno Bevere.

489
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:03,310
My mom, my aunt.

490
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:04,445
- Elvira is, uh...
- Hi.

491
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:06,013
She's Renato's wife.

492
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:08,249
- Uh...
- Good.

493
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:13,187
A friend is here.

494
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:18,859
- Good evening, Renato.
- Bruno.

495
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:21,095
Father.

496
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,334
Join us, take a seat, Bruno.

497
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:28,769
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

498
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,238
May I offer you
something to drink?

499
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:33,274
Mm-hmm.

500
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:40,881
So, I was talking
with Don Anselmo.

501
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:44,385
We were making final plans
about the election.

502
00:59:44,485 --> 00:59:47,688
I'm sure I will win. I mean,
I have no doubt about it.

503
00:59:48,557 --> 00:59:50,825
But you know,
if the other side just...

504
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:53,794
If they create a riot,
or if they--

505
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,597
if they, like, manipulate
the actual voting,

506
00:59:56,697 --> 00:59:58,365
that--that could be
a problem.

507
01:00:00,468 --> 01:00:02,203
That's why I am here.

508
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:09,243
I've been away
at the front for so long.

509
01:00:09,844 --> 01:00:12,713
You know,
I fought for two years

510
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:15,349
and then I come back here,
you know,

511
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:17,952
and I have to worry
about all this.

512
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:21,055
The election.

513
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:24,892
I mean, this is insane.

514
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:27,428
These people,
they've been working for us

515
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:29,063
forever, you know,

516
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:31,932
and now you're
expecting them to vote.

517
01:00:32,032 --> 01:00:34,702
I just-- you know,
I don't get it.

518
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:36,470
They have no rights.

519
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:39,840
I mean, these people
are, you know,

520
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,209
- nothing.
- It's the first free election

521
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,644
we have in our country.

522
01:00:43,744 --> 01:00:45,846
- Hmm.
- You fought for it.

523
01:00:46,714 --> 01:00:48,015
Appreciate it.

524
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:08,269
- Hey.
- Who's there?

525
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:12,206
What's happening?

526
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:18,979
Come in here, come.

527
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,658
Michele,
I want to kill him!

528
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:31,058
What's happening?

529
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:33,327
I should have killed them all.

530
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,999
Luigi Fiore said
he will kill all of us.

531
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,570
Our cousin, Luigi.

532
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:44,772
We send this little punk
to university

533
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:47,241
and he comes back
with those ideas, huh?

534
01:01:47,341 --> 01:01:51,278
Didn't they teach him
this is Italy, not Russia?

535
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:53,914
Luigi Fiore and who else?

536
01:01:57,251 --> 01:01:58,319
Who else?

537
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:00,387
And, uh...

538
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:04,458
Michele Russo.

539
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,466
Angelo Rinaldi, the doctor,

540
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,270
he cannot control them,
he's too weak.

541
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:21,742
Two decorated for valor,
you and you.

542
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:24,211
One wounded in war.

543
01:02:24,311 --> 01:02:26,013
And now you,

544
01:02:26,113 --> 01:02:29,584
the respectable people
of this village

545
01:02:29,684 --> 01:02:32,987
must be subjected to this.

546
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:37,358
These socialists need a lesson

547
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:41,395
about life and death,

548
01:02:41,495 --> 01:02:44,965
but they don't believe, so...

549
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,868
they won't need a priest.

550
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:50,938
Otherwise,

551
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:56,176
they will end up preventing you
from baptizing your children,

552
01:02:57,778 --> 01:02:59,780
abusing your women.

553
01:03:01,716 --> 01:03:03,884
They will kill the priests,

554
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:08,188
and use churches for barns.

555
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:25,674
There's someone out there!

556
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:27,441
Get down,
get down. Move, move!

557
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:28,809
Diana.

558
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:32,413
Get down, get down.

559
01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:34,114
Stay back, stay back.

560
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:37,951
The weapons.

561
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:26,059
Bless me father
for I've sinned.

562
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:32,433
My last confession
was 160 days ago.

563
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:36,604
Since then...

564
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:40,407
I've been feeling
a lot of anger,

565
01:05:42,075 --> 01:05:44,178
especially toward my son.

566
01:05:46,848 --> 01:05:48,282
I shout at him.

567
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:53,220
He doesn't listen to me.

568
01:05:54,656 --> 01:05:56,023
He reminds me

569
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,258
of my mother

570
01:06:00,194 --> 01:06:01,962
who died a year ago.

571
01:06:04,097 --> 01:06:07,301
I still hold a lot
of resentment against her.

572
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:12,707
Lately...

573
01:06:16,109 --> 01:06:17,978
I've been observing my...

574
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:20,247
my daughter...

575
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:24,051
as she washes herself.

576
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:31,425
Her body's changing.

577
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:36,598
Her nipples are changing
their color.

578
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:43,505
I look at her body,

579
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:46,006
I feel aroused.

580
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:48,643
- No.
- I can't help it.

581
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:52,346
- I, uh, I don't know how to--
- No.

582
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,955
You have a darkness
in your heart.

583
01:07:01,054 --> 01:07:03,123
It manifests itself as evil.

584
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,695
Evil you perpetuate
on your family with

585
01:07:07,795 --> 01:07:09,329
no apologies, no...

586
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:12,065
There's no contrition
in anything you have to say,

587
01:07:12,734 --> 01:07:14,034
you relish in it.

588
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:18,673
It's unacceptable.

589
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:31,853
I would assign as penance
for your mother and your son

590
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:35,623
that you fast on bread and water
for the next week.

591
01:07:35,723 --> 01:07:38,058
You say three Hail Mary's
and three Our Father's

592
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:39,727
everyday for the next month.

593
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:42,697
As for your daughter,
there is no penance
that's adequate.

594
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,803
Be grateful I'm not God.

595
01:07:49,971 --> 01:07:51,639
I'm just a friar who prays.

596
01:07:53,106 --> 01:07:54,509
It's beyond me.

597
01:07:58,913 --> 01:08:00,347
This is beyond me.

598
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:07,689
I would bar you from communion
until the last rites,

599
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:08,957
save for Christ's compassion.

600
01:08:09,057 --> 01:08:10,357
Go to God.

601
01:08:11,325 --> 01:08:13,193
Don't come to me, go to God.

602
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:20,868
God cannot help me.

603
01:08:24,072 --> 01:08:25,472
God can help you.

604
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:30,745
God is capable of pulling
the highest good
out of the worst tragedy.

605
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:32,479
God can help you.

606
01:08:33,146 --> 01:08:34,448
Go to God.

607
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:43,891
I think God doesn't exist.

608
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:49,564
Why?

609
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,137
If you continue behaving
the way you're behaving,

610
01:08:57,237 --> 01:08:59,306
you're going to hell,
you understand that?

611
01:09:01,274 --> 01:09:02,677
You understand that?

612
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:08,181
I don't know if there's hell.

613
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,351
You don't know if there's hell?

614
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:13,353
- No.
- You will when you get there.

615
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:23,865
Get up and get out. Get up.

616
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:26,934
Get out.

617
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:32,140
- I have a question for you.
- Shh! Shut the fuck up!

618
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,142
Say "Christ is Lord."

619
01:09:34,241 --> 01:09:36,044
Say "Christ is Lord."

620
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:40,280
Say it, you say
"Christ is Lord!"

621
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:44,451
Get out! Get out!

622
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:16,144
Please, God,

623
01:11:16,244 --> 01:11:20,548
please bring our Papa home

624
01:11:21,549 --> 01:11:26,319
to be healthy, safe, and alive.

625
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:18,973
Where are we going?

626
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:20,975
We're going to the elections.

627
01:12:21,075 --> 01:12:22,743
What means elections?

628
01:12:23,244 --> 01:12:25,713
That's a good question.

629
01:12:25,813 --> 01:12:29,449
Elections are a game,
a game we need to win, Diana.

630
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:31,953
- You see?
- A game?

631
01:12:32,053 --> 01:12:33,453
We're gonna vote over there.

632
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:04,785
- I'll see you later.
- Alright.

633
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:20,101
Okay.

634
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:35,182
Thank you.

635
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:35,142
Put the cross
by the hammer and sickle.

636
01:14:47,521 --> 01:14:52,059
Yeah, it is easy.
Put the cross...

637
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,663
You gotta put the cross
by the hammer and sickle.

638
01:14:55,763 --> 01:14:57,798
By the hammer and sickle.

639
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:40,207
I've split them apart

640
01:15:40,307 --> 01:15:42,209
and I'm keeping them for myself.

641
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,882
There's your glory for you.

642
01:15:50,519 --> 01:15:52,186
Stay in your place.

643
01:15:53,754 --> 01:15:54,989
Do not compete with me

644
01:15:55,089 --> 01:15:57,691
for things you cannot make
a claim to.

645
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,028
The last five years of misery

646
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:03,297
will be nothing
to what is to come.

647
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:11,172
A hundred million dead,
that sounds right, yes?

648
01:18:58,772 --> 01:19:00,007
Amen.

649
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:34,041
The election was a fraud,
we won the votes.

650
01:19:34,908 --> 01:19:36,877
We were robbed!

651
01:19:36,977 --> 01:19:39,313
Fuck all those guys!

652
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:41,282
My brother is the mayor.

653
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:44,084
We were robbed.

654
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:50,625
That red flag will never be
raised next to the tricolor.

655
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:52,926
You got it? Come on.

656
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:07,007
Vincenzo, you know
what you're going to do?

657
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:11,045
You tell them anyone
who supported the other side,

658
01:20:11,145 --> 01:20:13,080
they no longer have a job.

659
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,182
Okay? I don't wanna
see them ever again.

660
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:34,468
Giuseppe.

661
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,859
Help me!

662
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:06,601
Help me!

663
01:21:07,901 --> 01:21:10,871
Help me!

664
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:16,243
Help! Help me!

665
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:22,249
Help me! Help me! Help me!

666
01:21:56,116 --> 01:22:00,988
Help me!

667
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:07,227
Help me!

668
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:54,576
You are a socialist now?

669
01:22:54,676 --> 01:22:56,243
What are you doing here?

670
01:22:58,646 --> 01:23:02,449
To tell you're fired.
They don't want you anymore.

671
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:11,492
And how I'm gonna feed
my children?

672
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:16,163
Let the socialist feed them.

673
01:23:22,737 --> 01:23:23,705
Fine.

674
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:26,073
Fine?

675
01:23:32,412 --> 01:23:34,448
My husband is gonna come back.

676
01:23:35,717 --> 01:23:37,417
He will take care of us.

677
01:23:43,758 --> 01:23:45,492
Your husband is dead.

678
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:49,531
He's not coming back.

679
01:23:53,768 --> 01:23:55,102
How you know?

680
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:57,504
I saw him.

681
01:24:21,328 --> 01:24:23,665
I've loved you my whole life.

682
01:25:30,632 --> 01:25:32,900
<i>I was born four times.</i>

683
01:25:34,969 --> 01:25:36,236
<i>The first,</i>

684
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:38,305
<i>from my mother.</i>

685
01:25:39,707 --> 01:25:42,543
<i>The second,</i>
<i>when I received baptism.</i>

686
01:25:44,646 --> 01:25:47,815
<i>The third,</i>
<i>when I entered this order.</i>

687
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:49,917
<i>And the fourth,</i>

688
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:53,521
<i>when the Lord came to visit me.</i>

689
01:25:56,223 --> 01:25:58,626
<i>And since that visitation,</i>
<i>Father...</i>

690
01:26:01,029 --> 01:26:02,496
<i>this desire</i>

691
01:26:04,098 --> 01:26:07,535
<i>has been growing</i>
<i>continually in my heart.</i>

692
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:12,472
<i>It is now what I would call</i>
<i>a strong passion.</i>

693
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:15,743
<i>I have in fact</i>

694
01:26:16,644 --> 01:26:19,747
<i>made this offering</i>
<i>to the Lord many times...</i>

695
01:26:21,983 --> 01:26:26,219
<i>by seeking Him to pour out</i>
<i>upon me all the punishments</i>

696
01:26:26,921 --> 01:26:31,693
<i>for all the sinners</i>
<i>and all the souls</i>
<i>in a state of purgation.</i>

697
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:35,295
<i>Even increasing them</i>

698
01:26:36,931 --> 01:26:39,867
<i>upon me a hundred-fold,</i>

699
01:26:39,967 --> 01:26:43,437
<i>so long as He quickly</i>
<i>admits to Paradise,</i>

700
01:26:43,538 --> 01:26:47,875
<i>all the sinners and all</i>
<i>the souls in purgatory.</i>

701
01:26:49,043 --> 01:26:50,578
<i>But I should now,</i>

702
01:26:51,913 --> 01:26:53,246
<i>formally,</i>

703
01:26:54,214 --> 01:26:56,584
<i>might to make this offering</i>

704
01:26:56,684 --> 01:26:58,886
<i>to the Lord</i>
<i>in obedience to You.</i>

705
01:27:01,354 --> 01:27:02,990
<i>This is my purpose.</i>

706
01:27:06,094 --> 01:27:09,296
<i>And more than that</i>
<i>it seems to me</i>

707
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:11,866
<i>that Jesus really wants this.</i>

708
01:27:14,736 --> 01:27:19,574
<i>I'm sure You have no difficulty</i>
<i>in granting me this permission.</i>

709
01:27:19,674 --> 01:27:22,677
<i>Please bless me, Father,</i>
<i>and pray for me also.</i>

710
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:27,380
<i>Your friend, your brother,</i>

711
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:29,951
<i>Pio.</i>

712
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:16,757
- We won! We won!
- We won! We won!

713
01:29:38,145 --> 01:29:41,916
Today is our day!
Today is our day!

714
01:29:42,016 --> 01:29:45,753
Today is our day!
Today is our day!

715
01:29:45,853 --> 01:29:49,557
Today is our day!
Today is our day!

716
01:29:49,657 --> 01:29:53,527
Today is our day!
Today is our day!

717
01:29:53,628 --> 01:29:57,598
Today is our day!
Today is our day!

718
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,269
For reason
of public safety,

719
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:38,806
you must postpone
this ceremony.

720
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:41,642
- What?
- It's a prefect's order.

721
01:30:44,679 --> 01:30:46,714
You're not the mayor, Angelo.

722
01:30:46,814 --> 01:30:49,583
The vote wasn't valid. I won.

723
01:30:51,953 --> 01:30:55,156
Get out of here!
Go back home.

724
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:10,771
What did he say?

725
01:31:10,871 --> 01:31:12,907
They want to postpone
the ceremony.

726
01:31:14,775 --> 01:31:17,211
But it is our right, we won.

727
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:18,612
Who ordered them to do so?

728
01:31:18,713 --> 01:31:20,715
It's an order
from the prefect.

729
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:26,787
I won't tell you again,
just go home.

730
01:31:26,887 --> 01:31:30,992
You go home, Gerardo, we stay.
 It's our building now.

731
01:31:31,092 --> 01:31:34,895
I'm gonna get the flag
and stick it into your ass,
you hear me?

732
01:31:34,996 --> 01:31:36,797
- Out!
- Fuck you, Gerardo!

733
01:31:36,897 --> 01:31:40,401
- You go! You go!
- Fuck you! We won!
It's our right. Right?

734
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,669
Fix the bayonets.

735
01:31:41,769 --> 01:31:43,337
We won! We won!

736
01:31:43,437 --> 01:31:44,739
Back off!

737
01:31:44,839 --> 01:31:47,041
We won! It's our right!

738
01:31:51,112 --> 01:31:53,614
Okay, guys, okay,
it's better to go home.

739
01:31:53,714 --> 01:31:56,550
It's too dangerous, okay?
We return another time, okay?

740
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:40,928
Prepare to fire!

741
01:32:45,066 --> 01:32:48,936
Let's move, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

742
01:32:49,036 --> 01:32:50,471
- No, no.
- Come on.

743
01:32:50,571 --> 01:32:52,706
- What-- No! No!
- We return another time, guys.

744
01:32:52,807 --> 01:32:54,875
We return another time, guys.
We return another time.

745
01:32:54,975 --> 01:32:56,545
- No, we won't go.
- We're not going.

746
01:32:56,644 --> 01:32:58,746
- Leave! Get the fuck off!
- We won't go!

747
01:32:58,846 --> 01:33:01,415
- Leave!
- You fucking bitch!

748
01:33:01,516 --> 01:33:03,584
You don't talk to me like that!

749
01:33:03,684 --> 01:33:06,687
We won!

750
01:33:14,295 --> 01:33:16,664
Open the door! Open!

751
01:33:16,764 --> 01:33:18,332
Get out! Get out!

752
01:33:18,732 --> 01:33:20,935
- Get out!
- Fire!

753
01:33:28,642 --> 01:33:30,845
Fire!

754
01:33:33,548 --> 01:33:34,715
Fire!

755
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:38,319
Fire!
