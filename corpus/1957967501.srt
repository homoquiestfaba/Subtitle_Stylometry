Hey, Christina, listen,

3
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:08,837
I know you've been through
three drafts on this already,

4
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,312
but the client came back and
asked for some more revisions.

5
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:12,831
Hey, it's me.

6
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,074
I think you're flying again.

7
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,283
I haven't heard from
you in a few days,

8
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:18,664
so I just thought I'd say hi.

9
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:19,699
So hi.

10
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:22,506
[Caller 2 On Voice
Mail] I keep being asked

11
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,980
about the schedule and I have

12
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:27,190
to check with Andy and obviously
wants to get your timeline.

[Gloria] Christina,

16
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:44,484
what did you do with
my mortgage bills?

17
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:46,796
I just wanna put them in
the mail like I always do.

18
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,695
I know, but I put it
all on auto-pay for you,

19
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,697
you won't have to do anything.

20
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:52,985
[Gloria] It's that easy, is it?

21
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,114
Well, that's what I do.

22
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:55,770
My rent, my loans.

23
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,151
I hear a ding on my phone.

24
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,326
I get emailed a
theme and loans paid.

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,499
I have like eight of them.

26
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,639
That's why my phone's
always dinging.

27
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,952
[Gloria] Very funny, Christina.

28
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:09,957

31
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:18,241
So bad.

32
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:20,623

[cell phone beeps]

36
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,879
I was just in Atlanta
doing a deposition.

37
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:37,881
And then after this
one was Cleveland.

38
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,089
Hey, Jim.

39
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:40,160
- Cleveland.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:42,369
How are you?

41
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,956
Well, you know what they say?

42
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:45,682

Oh, still going a

46
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:54,243
Yeah.

47
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:56,555
So Andy's got you flying
all around the country.

48
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:59,051
I told him you were a superstar.

49
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,594
I don't know about that.

51
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:03,562
I'm covering from another one.

52
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:11,881
So you wanted to talk to me?

53
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:12,915
Yeah.

54
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:15,229
Well, you were so helpful,

55
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:16,230
introducing me to Andy.

56
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:20,269
I was wondering if maybe you had

57
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,271
another recommendation
for another firm?

58
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,997
Maybe here.

59
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,104
They're not offering
a partnership.

60
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:29,381
Oh, they are.

61
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,281
I think two, three years.

62
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:33,523
Who knows?

63
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:36,699
I just, I keep having
these conversations

64
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,114
in my head about it.

65
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:41,428
And sometimes I imagine
I'm back in law school

66
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:42,715
and I'm having
that talk with you

67
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,639
about taking the job
in the first place.

68
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:48,963
You know, you
graduated in the middle

69
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:52,197
of the financial
panic yet you wouldn't

70
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,957
even consider a job here.

71
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:56,374
You headed off to California

72
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,651
and you've been marching down

73
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:59,480
that road for the
last six years.

74
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:00,274
Yeah.

75
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,482
And it's good work.

76
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,149
One day, I'm talking
to an investment banker

77
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:05,210
in the next I'm flying
out to meet real estate

78
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,627
developers and Andy's
been very supportive.

79
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:10,388
Yeah, 'cause you provide value.

80
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,400
Sometimes I think it's more
that I have time to give.

81
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:13,424
If that makes sense.

82
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:17,566
Well,

83
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:21,709
I'll start asking around.

84
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:22,744
I'll be discreet.

85
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:26,645
But if you leave before
you make partner,

86
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,268
you won't have any security.

87
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:37,035
You know, sometimes work
helps me make decisions.

88
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:41,108
Like if I'm struggling with
some personal thing, like,

89
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,593
like when my son was sick

90
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,940
and there were all the
doctors and all that,

91
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:49,496
and I just dived into
my notes on some lecture

92
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,879
and my mind would just work,
work, work, work, work.

93
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,987
And sometimes in a flash,

94
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:00,334
the answer to the other
thing would appear

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,651
and I'd click open another
window, start writing.

96
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:09,722
And there it was.

[Marisol] Yeah. Sorry.

109
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,139
My boss is gone now.

110
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:48,634
I just didn't want
him to understand me.

111
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:49,797
Oh, it's just,

112
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:51,292
I barely remember
Spanish and I only hear

113

you before, but-

It's okay.

124

I can't do this. I'm done.

not, I'm not ready.

This is Joanne.

140

Oh, hi.

141
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,453
Good morning.

142
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:44,914
I'm helping my mother move
her retirement account online.

143
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:46,156
[Joanne] Ma'am she's gonna
have to do that herself.

144
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,330
I'm gonna need to
put you on hold.

145
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:48,873
But I have her
account information.

146
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,115
Hello?

147
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,879
Hello.

148
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,088
How we doing, everybody good?

149
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:59,297
Not bad temporary digs, right?

150
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,850
Christina, can I speak with you?

151
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,546
So the judge asked for a
revised version of the motion.

152
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,040
I already gotta be in
two different places

153
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,549
at the same time today.

154
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,205
I mean, I can do
it, but it'd be tight.

155
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,517
Rose, she's working on Larry.

156
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,277
I cannot deal with her today.

157
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:16,452
I never know when she's
finished a fucking sentence.

158
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,350
Everything goes
up and up and up.

159
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:20,352
Last week she comes
into my office.

160
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:24,184
She tells me the sixth circuit
just came in and I think

161
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:28,153
what it means is possibly I
just tell me the decision.

162
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,741
Don't think in front of me,

163
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,605
every email starts with, hi,

164
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,134
with an exclamation
point at the end of it.

165
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,057
Yeah, well, I do that
too, just not to you.

166
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,197
Well don't, I will
block your partnership.

167
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:38,888
Just don't block hers.

168
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:40,441
She'll be gone in a year,

169
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:42,167
probably already
sending out her resumes.

170
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:44,307
Anyway, this needs
to go out by five

171
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:46,309
and then you can
prep for tomorrow.

172
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:48,001
Rose has you covered on that?

173
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:49,323
Oh, I haven't even looked at it.

174
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,693
She said the clients-

175
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:54,421
You'll win her over,
whatever, this is good for you.

176
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:55,836
Right, right.

177
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:56,872
Not too much.

178
00:09:58,563 --> 00:09:59,668
[light music]

179
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,117
I could take a crack at it.

180
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:03,982
No, I got it.

181
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,294
Start it tomorrow.

182
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,537
Long version or short?

183
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:09,711
Short.

184
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,821
So this deal feels like
it was brokered in Buffalo,

185
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:16,132
not in New York.

186
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,102
The price point is really low.

187
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:30,905
Beautiful.

188
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,218
How is Jay?

189
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:34,081
Oh, good.

190
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,427
You know, busy.

191
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:36,991
Like always keep telling
him they should give him

192
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:39,362
a cot by the trading desk.

193
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,687
Well, I really appreciate
you squeezing me in like this.

194
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,920
Oh, it was great to see you.

195
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:46,162
What's going on.

196
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:49,579
Well, I have a
doctor back at home,

197
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,374
but traveling and,

198
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,002
I wanna make sure this is real.

199
00:10:58,036 --> 00:10:59,486
Congratulations.

200
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:03,870
Was it, was it a surprise?

201
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,287
I remember running last night.

202
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:08,115
Is that okay?

203
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,150
Yeah, of course.

204
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,716
And I had a cup
coffee this morning.

205
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,948
A cup of day is fine.

207
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,884
Do you need to get that?

208
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:19,609
No, that's just my mom.

209
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:20,576
How is she?

210
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,610
Good.

211
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,717
Well, okay.

212
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,583
So it looks like you left
a couple blanks here.

213
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,412
Sorry, I'm always facing.

214
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,898
Yeah, welcome to
pregnancy brain.

215
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:36,903
So your last period
was six weeks ago.

216
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,700
Previous pregnancies, none.

217
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,734
One.

218
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:48,293
Was a long time ago.

219
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:51,331
We can just finish this
after the ultrasound, yeah.

220
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:55,128
[cell phone beeps]

[upbeat music]

222
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:08,900
I got here early
because I wanted

223
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,429
to speak to you now because
I am completely jammed,

224
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:13,525
but you were late so now I'm
conferencing on another call.

225
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,906
Have to run.

226
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,252
You are in excellent hands.

227
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:18,565
Hi.

228
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,359
No, I can hardly hear you.

229
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:20,291
This office is terrible.

230
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:21,602
Can I call you right back?

231
00:12:21,637 --> 00:12:22,880
Yep.

232
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,916
We're borrowing a few
rooms from another firm.

233
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,435
We can go somewhere else.

234
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:30,197
Your bio is impressive and
Andy speaks highly of you.

235
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:33,994
How much time will you
need from me tomorrow?

236
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,444
Well, we reserve the whole day.

237
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:36,894
We'll walk through
all the documents

238
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,968
that are likely to raise
questions to practice from.

239
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,139
You need a whole day for that?

240
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,865
We should review everything.

241
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,591
Haven't you done that already.

242
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,419
I'm familiar with the document.

243
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:47,352
You're familiar.

244
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,458
Why am I paying you
and an associate?

245
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,494
What, a combined $1,200 an hour,

246
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:52,910
plus what Andy's gonna charge me

247
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:54,187
for that little introduction?

248
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,647
I'm sure he didn't
bill you for that.

249
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,949
Of course he did,
he's an asshole.

250
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,157
But he's effective.

251
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,918
Just not loyal enough
to drop whatever

252
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,196
it is he's doing to
handle my deposition.

253
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,405
I left Goldman to
start my new company.

254
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,235
And now that I'm small
potatoes, I get the associate.

255
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:12,792
I want you to feel prepared
to the questions for routine.

256
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,208
It's not routine, it's my life.

257
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,312
The deal's being held up.

258
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,935
My fees being held up.

259
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,602
They're not claiming I
did anything illegal.

260
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:22,077
They're claiming I didn't
broker a high enough price.

261
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:25,252
They're claiming that
I am incompetent.

262
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,013
These law firms
troll for clients.

263
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,887
They find anything that
looks out of the ordinary.

264
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:30,199
They announce that
they're investigating.

265
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:32,121
It's frustrating,
but it's very common.

266
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:34,330
They're suing because
I brokered the deal.

267
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,228
This is personal.

268
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:38,897

with clients tomorrow

because they're wondering
is every bank she sells

gonna get caught
up in litigation.

you for is personal.

tell me you were in New York?

She said you're staying
at the hotel she works at.

Well, she must
have been mistaken.

[Gloria] How can that be?

283
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,860
I don't know, but I'm
working and I have to get back.

work, work, work, work.

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,629
What for?

363
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:19,977
It's a bank. The
client's very important.

364
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,324
And you have to live
in California to do this.

365
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,500
You can get rich bankers
richer right here.

366
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:29,883
Do you know how few
women have made it

367
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:31,885
as far as I have at that firm,

368
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,578
a few women who look like me?

369
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:35,751
I get it.

370
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,857
I know, but that
doesn't give you

371
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,341
the right to go
through all my bills

372
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:42,965
and all my paperwork
as if I am some invalid

373
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,105
who cannot open a
statement once a month.

374
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,935
What do you think
the DOE is saying?

375
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,212
I'm trying to help you.

376
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,076
The last time I was
home, there was a pile

377
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,733
of bills stacked on the table.

378
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:52,699
You miss payments.

379
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:54,114
You double pay.

380
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:57,739
I put time in my
students not money,

381
00:20:57,773 --> 00:21:00,086
and that's my business,
you mind your own.

382
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:08,162
Fine.

383
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,579
I'll come see you tonight.

384
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:13,651
What time?

385
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:14,618
I don't know.

386
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:15,722
I'll call you.

387
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:26,871
You changed your hair?

388
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:30,357
Yeah.

389
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,327
What have I done so wrong.

390
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:38,262
[knocking]

391
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:40,989
Holy shit.

392
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:41,921
I still have 10
minutes to get ready.

393
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:43,716
Can I have my phone please?

394
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,686
Yeah, your mom just called
and Bobby called a few times.

395
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:51,827
I told him you were
really, really sick.

396
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:56,280
All right, come get
me in five minutes.

397
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,181
[phone rings]

398
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,459
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,427
How did you get my mom's number?

400
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,567
[Bobby] I had to
Google her school.

401
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:09,500
Why would you call her?

402
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:11,675
[Bobby] Because I was worried.

403
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:14,643
Rose kept going on and on
about how sick you were.

404
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:19,648
No, I'm sorry. I'm not sick.

405
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,928
[Bobby] You know,
I'm not a mind reader.

406
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:27,622
If I did something wrong,
you've gotta tell me.

407
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:30,037
I'm pregnant.

408
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,041
[Bobby] Ah.

409
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:35,318
Hello?

410
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:40,635
[Bobby] I don't
know what to say.

411
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:44,742
I'm now gonna ask you a series

412
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:47,296
of questions about
your background.

413
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:48,850
What colleges did you attend?

414
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,748
And what degree was conferred?

415
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,371
I attended Queens College,

416
00:22:53,648 --> 00:22:56,098
bachelor of science
and economics, 1993.

417
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:59,412
That's Queens, New York part
of the city college system?

418
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:00,862
We can't all go to Columbia.

419
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:07,662
It says you attended
from '87 through 1993.

420
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:09,146
Was there delay
in the completion

421
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,149
of your degree due to academic
or disciplinary reasons?

422
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,771
I took time off to work.

423
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,085
Earn any graduate degrees?

424
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,327
No.

425
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:19,950
Any certifications
in advanced study

426
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:21,503
for finance and securities?

427
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:22,538
No.

428
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,783
Your first job outta college.

429
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:28,476
I was hired as
an analyst at STL.

430
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,892
We have you
starting there in '95.

431
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:32,307
Where were you before that?

432
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:36,863
I interned and I bartended
anyone can Google me

433
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,557
and see the deals
that I have brokered.

434
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:41,004
Look,

435
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,640
the plaintiff's attorneys are
gonna ask you these questions

436
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,183
they do it to raise
doubts about you.

437
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,356
You didn't go to Harvard.

438
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,634
You didn't go to Wharton.

439
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:50,498
They're gonna make you
put that on the record.

440
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:53,224
They're gonna ask you about
your relationship with Mark.

441
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,572
Where'd you meet him? How'd
you secure him as a client.

442
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:56,676
They're going to imply

443
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,920
that I had a
relationship with Mark?

444
00:23:58,954 --> 00:23:59,954
Have you seen him?

445
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:04,270
I suggest you answer these
questions with confidence.

446
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:08,412
You presented this
offer sheet to the board

447
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,656
of directors we'll
call document three.

448
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,072
Is this the offer
sheet you presented?

449
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:14,935
One moment.

450
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:20,044
Yes, that is correct.

451
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,874
Right, and the
standard is to share

452
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:23,392
a report of comparable deals

453
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:24,670
in the region to make it clear

454
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:26,395
that the price for
the bank is fair.

455
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,812
It's part of what's called
your fairness opinion.

456
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:31,573
And yet you didn't choose
any banks from the region.

457
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:33,817
This is document
four, peer groups.

458
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:35,197
Did you present this?

459
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:39,649
Hello?

460
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:42,618
Um,

461
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:46,899
yes, that is the peer group.

462
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:48,935
And you included
a bank in Harrisburg

463
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,800
and another in Dayton,
banks whose price points

464
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:54,976
are closer to 1.3
or 1.4 times book,

465
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,874
as opposed to any in
the New York Metro

466
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,359
where the comparable
prices would be two or 2.1.

467
00:25:00,395 --> 00:25:02,121
Do you have a question?

468
00:25:02,155 --> 00:25:03,950
Well, any study of similar deals

469
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:05,780
in the region would
show much higher prices.

470
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:07,091
It's like,

471
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,369
you're pretending this
deal's in a rust belt.

472
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:11,026
Seems like a very low price.

473
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,521
It's not like we're
talking about some bank

474
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,029
that's headquartered
on Fifth Avenue.

475
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:16,342
This bank is based in
Red Hook, Brooklyn.

476
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:18,413
The market share is
not likely to increase.

477
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:20,553
It took me two years
to find one buyer.

478
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,762
Now, how do you
expect me to say that

479
00:25:22,797 --> 00:25:24,592
without offending the
board of directors

480
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,421
and drive the price
down even lower.

481
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:29,493
Christina, just turn it off.

482
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,288
Marisol texted you.

483
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,565
She said that her ex show up

484
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,153
at her job sounded
like an emergency.

485
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,640
Call the DA's office
and tell that we need

486
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:40,228
a restraining order enforced

487
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:42,368
and give them Marisol's
info on my phone.

488
00:25:42,402 --> 00:25:43,334
Then call her,

489
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:44,853
tell her help is on the way,

490
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,545
tell her to walk
through her safety plan.

491
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,167
How much longer
is this gonna take?

492
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,548
Just a couple more hours.

493
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:52,136
- You alright?
- Yeah.

494
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:54,414
Can we just get on with it?

495
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,248
We'll call this document five.

496
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:02,491
Is this the fairness opinion
you presented for vote

497
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,942
to the board of directors
at King South bank

498
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:06,772
and was the vote unanimous?

499
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:08,152
No.

500
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:11,121
No, it wasn't unanimous.

501
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:13,433
No, this isn't the fairness
opinion that I presented.

502
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:14,573
These numbers are off.

503
00:26:31,037 --> 00:26:32,383
Could she be wrong?

504
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:33,947
There's like 30
different versions of it.

505
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:35,179
I triple checked.

506
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:36,294
And did you ask the CFO if this

507
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,975
was absolutely the latest draft.

508
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:42,323
Oh.

509
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:44,603
Okay. Thanks.

510
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:47,088
He's sending the correct draft.

511
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,365
Jesus.

512
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,549
Can you just keep
going without it?

513
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:50,505
No, everything
revolves around it.

514
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:51,920
I'm so sorry.

515
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,473
What are we waiting on?

516
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,683
We're just getting a print
out of the correct draft.

517
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:57,961
We can pick back up in
about 20, 30 minutes.

518
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,524
You mean to say that
you're putting eyes

519
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:01,378
on this for the
first time right now?

520
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:03,380
We made a mistake.

521
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,659
Andy said you were a star.

522
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:07,626
You're in great hands.

523
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,628
I put my star associate on it.

524
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,284
His words.

525
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,804
[light music]

526
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:15,875
[Andy] Is this
Rose or is this you?

527
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,636
We fixed it. It's fine.

528
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,085
[Andy] No, it's not.

529
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,569
She left me a voicemail

530
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:23,193
yelling about malpractice,
sounded like she was in a car.

531
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:24,539
She said she'd be back.

532
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,242
[Andy] I'm not sponsoring
you for partnerships,

533
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:28,957
you fucking chase clients away.

534
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,167
While you're waiting.

535
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:33,134
I need another motion drafted.

536
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:34,168
Hold on.

537
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:37,483
Any word from Marisol?

538
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:38,967
Yeah.

539
00:27:39,002 --> 00:27:42,143
I spoke to her boss and he
said that she left with Jason.

540
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:43,177
What?

541
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:47,044
All right, just keep calling.

542
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,425
And also I need some research.

543
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,807
Go back 10 years, look
up peer groups listed

544
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:52,809
in every merger in
the New York Metro

545
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:55,294
and include Boston,
LA and Chicago.

546
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:56,916
Look for anything
that sticks out.

547
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,056
- Is he?
- He's fine.

548
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:00,540
I work so hard.

549
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:01,990
Harder than I did in Boston.

550
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,267
Yeah, I know.

551
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:04,165
But you've never worked
for anyone else before.

552
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,200
It's different.

553
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:06,961
You have to listen more.

554
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:08,548
To what.

555
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:09,929
Are you there?

556
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:12,035
Oh yeah, go ahead.

557
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,588
[Caller] The judge has a problem

558
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:15,555
with the language
you put in there.

559
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,178
[light music]

560
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:19,283
We have the correct draft now.

561
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:22,355
Just wondering on her ETA.

562
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,390
Hello?

563
00:28:27,636 --> 00:28:29,535
We have a lot more
material to review.

564
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:33,228
Can I speak to her?

565
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:37,957
Well, where is she?

566
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,225
What are you thinking about?

567
00:29:06,503 --> 00:29:08,919
Must be something
your eyes are burning

568
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:10,265
a hole through that screen.

569
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:13,728
Why is it that
no matter how hard

570
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,030
I try not to make
the same mistakes.

571
00:29:16,064 --> 00:29:17,272
Are you talking about having

572
00:29:17,307 --> 00:29:18,998
the wrong draft of
my fairness opinion?

573
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,242
No, that was
comparatively minor.

574
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:22,276
Not to me.

575
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,075
What is your most
advanced degree?

576
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:30,664
JD.

577
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:34,703
Any advanced certification
in mergers and acquisition law?

578
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:35,981
No.

579
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:38,017
Any specializations whatsoever?

580
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:42,194
What makes you think you can
conduct business with experts?

581
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:46,646
My whole life,

582
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:48,486
I've been surrounded by
people who don't look like me.

583
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,340
Don't talk like me.

584
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,066
I learned to ask
myself questions.

585
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:54,965
What are they thinking?

586
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:57,139
What do they want?

587
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,075
What am I thinking?

588
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,983
[light music]

589
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:25,927
[Assistant] Look,
she's at her hotel,

590
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:27,618
but she can't speak
with you right now.

591
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:28,412
I understand.

592
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:29,828
Just give me an address.

593
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,175
I don't want anything,
just an address.

594
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,800
[light music]

595
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,772
We've been trying to
get a hold of you all day.

596
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:45,257
You're upset. I get it, but-

597
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:01,583
All right, we have
a bunny for you.

598
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:04,621
I told her nanny to stay

599
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,554
within five blocks of the hotel,

600
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,384
but they went exploring,

601
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,421
found a playground
with some monkey bars.

602
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,285
And of course her
elbow popped out.

603
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,047
I met them at the
emergency room.

604
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:21,362
I figured a dislocated elbow

605
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:23,433
was a good enough excuse
for a wine delivery.

606
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,400
And this lawsuit was
a good enough reason

607
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,368
to make it a $200 bottle.

608
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:29,818
Thank you.

609
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:32,304
My kids have weak elbows,
it's my husband's side.

610
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:33,684
Is he here?

611
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,894
He is back in San
Francisco working

612
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:39,863
and it's just easier
for me to bring

613
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,314
the nanny and the
kids along with me.

614
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:44,074
I apologize, again, I-

615
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:46,559
Don't walk into
a room unprepared,

616
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:47,709
even if it's not your fault,

617
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:49,286
people will use it against you.

618
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:53,739
If we could have two
hours tomorrow morning

619
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:56,224
before the deposition
you'll feel very prepared.

620
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:57,881
With what, more legalese?

621
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:03,024
If you're trying to justify
a decision with words,

622
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,924
good luck, words might
as well be stones.

623
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,478
I've been researching
peer groups,

624
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:13,069
not billing it to make up for
before I haven't finished yet,

625
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:15,450
but I can provide you
with some healthful data.

626
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:18,177
Do the work first, then promise.

627
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:29,016
I'd never let my daughter
do this in a million years.

628
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:33,192
You sure you have
his stomach for it?

629
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:38,853
I wanted to be a prosecutor.

630
00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:42,408
Then I interned for
an ADA and realized

631
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:45,342
that putting people in cages
for a living's not for me.

632
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,483
And I had to pay off
my student loans.

633
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:54,869
My mom she's worked
in education 30 years,

634
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:56,388
two master's degrees.

635
00:32:56,422 --> 00:32:59,149
And with the hours she
puts in the out of pocket,

636
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:00,185
it's minimum wage.

637
00:33:01,358 --> 00:33:03,464
And my dad got laid off.

638
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:06,191
When I was a kid
she worked weekends,

639
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:08,607
cleaning houses, babysitting.

640
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:12,749
I wanna see my kids
on the weekends.

641
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:15,855
You have kids?

642
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:19,203
No.

643
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,345
Can I ask you something?

644
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:27,074
That's a $200 bottle of wine.

645
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,248
Aren't you the least
bit curious to try it?

646
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,562
No, I'm very curious.

647
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:33,597
I just.

648
00:33:35,634 --> 00:33:37,843
It's none of my
business, I'm sorry.

649
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:38,877
No, I,

650
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:44,022
I just found out today.

651
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:48,302
Was it a surprise?

652
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:50,648
Oh yeah.

653
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:55,274
Well, I will drink for
you because you are screwed.

654
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:58,036
Who's the guy?

655
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,417
Another attorney,
different firm.

656
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,452
I told him today.

657
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:04,076
Don't tell anyone else.

658
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,183
Not until you
absolutely have to.

659
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:10,393
When are you up for partnership?

660
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,671
Three more years.

661
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:13,810
Get that in writing.

662
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:17,676
Do not let them defer you
because you took time off

663
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,402
for maternity because they will.

664
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,166
[Pat] How long
have you been dating?

665
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:26,409
Six or seven months.

666
00:34:27,513 --> 00:34:28,859
He's really nice, I just,

667
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,035
I just don't know
him that well yet.

668
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,348
[Pat] How long does
it take to know someone?

669
00:34:35,797 --> 00:34:40,319
I've been with my husband
20 years and sometimes

670
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:42,114
still in the middle of the night

671
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,220
I wake up and I look over at him

672
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:47,740
and I just think who are you?

673
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,296
[light music]

674
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:09,036
Mom?

675
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,422
So you went to law school here.

676
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:49,664
You grew up here.

677
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:51,908
You couldn't find a
firm here to hire you.

678
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:54,738
I just felt like I could live

679
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:57,776
my whole life in one
place in one way,

680
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,227
or I could see what
else was out there.

681
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:04,645
Maybe even be someone else.

682
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,679
You know?

683
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:07,474
I do.

684
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:09,995
And I love it there,

685
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:11,376
I go running every day.

686
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,207
And you can see city and
mountain beaches all in one run.

687
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:18,452
It's like this whole
world opens up around you.

688
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:22,180
It's takes my breath
away every single time.

689
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:26,666
Still,

690
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:30,326
I think that no matter
how much everything

691
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,190
around you changes-

692
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:35,986
It's still just
always gonna be you.

693
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,195
Yes.

694
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,130
I may not have shown it,

695
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:44,132
but I liked you the moment
Andy introduced you,

696
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:49,897
'cause I saw myself
with all that promise,

697
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,352
all that baggage.

698
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:05,706
A long time ago, I was
going through something.

699
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:08,916
I don't know if I
was dreaming it,

700
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,436
but I saw the
light inside of me.

701
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,232
An actual light?

702
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:20,686
I was so scared that
people would see it.

703
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,136
And I didn't understand that.

704
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,311
I just wanted it to stop.

705
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:29,316
And just as quickly it
was gone and I missed it,

706
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:34,321
and I'd always felt like
I'd done something wrong,

707
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:36,530
and years go by,

708
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,810
and the other
night it came back.

709
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,332
I know it sounds
stupid, but I felt that-

710
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,760
[phone rings]

711
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:05,041
[Marisol] Hi, this is Marisol.

712
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,008
Please leave a message.

713
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:10,529
Hey, I'm sorry I
missed your calls.

714
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:15,603
Could you call me back and
let me know that you're safe.

715
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:17,260
If, if you're worried at all,

716
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,469
I'll send the cab to
take you wherever or,

717
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:23,231
I'll send you a plane ticket
and you can come with me.

718
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:24,302
Whatever you want.

719
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,096
Just,

720
00:38:27,926 --> 00:38:29,341
just let me know you're okay.

721
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:48,049
[knocking]

722
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:04,583
Hey, got your research.

723
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,518
Did you talk to Andy?

724
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:09,553
No.

725
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:12,384
He asked me to fly
ahead to Cleveland.

726
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:15,973
Are you okay?

727
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:18,563
Yeah. Yeah.

728
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:20,599
Thank you for this.

729
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:23,464
It's gonna help a lot tomorrow.

730
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:24,983
You should really call Andy.

731
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,156
Okay.

732
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:34,372
Oh, I forgot to tell
you when I had your phone,

733
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:36,615
somebody called a few
times and I wasn't sure

734
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,134
if it was an emergency.

735
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,999
So I picked up, it was an
old professor of yours.

736
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,597
He said that there was
someone he wanted you

737
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:44,692
to meet before you leave town.

738
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:46,625
I'm not looking for another job.

739
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,214
I would never ever tell anyone.

740
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,181
And no one would
blame me if you were.

741
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:52,976
This is so-

742
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:54,737
You just started.

743
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:56,704
A year from now this
is all gonna seem.

744
00:39:57,774 --> 00:39:58,637
What, normal?

745
00:39:58,672 --> 00:39:59,880
A year from now

746
00:39:59,914 --> 00:40:01,354
I'll be eight years
from partnership.

747
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,678
I applied for a job in Oakland.

748
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:09,027
I think I might get it.

749
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:10,408
It's this nonprofit.

750
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:12,385
I'd get to work with people

751
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,413
who aren't millionaires,
weekends off.

752
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,345
Of course they only have funding

753
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,141
for 12 months and
it barely pays, but.

754
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:22,154
It sounds like a great job
for someone coming outta law

755
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:23,421
school with a trust fund.

756
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,907
Yeah, I know how lucky I am.

757
00:40:27,804 --> 00:40:29,047
Tell myself all the time.

758
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:32,152
Sorry.

759
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:34,846
That sounds great.

760
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:39,402
I'll see you in Cleveland.

761
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:48,342
[light music]

762
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,713
[indistinct chatter]

763
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:52,475
That's all, excuse me one sec.

764
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:58,688
Hey, I called you last night.

765
00:41:58,723 --> 00:41:59,655
I even emailed.

766
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:00,794
Did you check your inbox?

767
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:02,105
No.

768
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,911
I was able to move my
deposition to tomorrow.

769
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:05,108
I can take over here.

770
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:06,327
You can go ahead to Cleveland.

771
00:42:06,351 --> 00:42:07,732
No, I'm good. We worked it out.

772
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:09,872
She asked me to come.

773
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:11,667
She insisted.

774
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:12,668
I was at her hotel last night.

775
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:13,496
Yeah.

776
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,739
She told me.

777
00:42:14,773 --> 00:42:15,671
Did you offer to
stay up all night

778
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:17,465
and do extra research for free?

779
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,227
Like you're some fucking
junior associate at her bank.

780
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:21,469
I was trying to help.

781
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:23,161
Do not ever offer
to work for free.

782
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:24,852
It makes you look cheap.

783
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:25,784
When you're getting sued

784
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:27,717
you don't want a bargain lawyer.

785
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:28,822
I'm gonna go talk-

786
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:29,995
No, no, no, no, no.

787
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,618
Look, she likes you.

788
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:33,343
Okay, but this isn't personal.

789
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:34,828
This is transactional.

790
00:42:34,862 --> 00:42:36,070
I don't want to be here.

791
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:38,383
I haven't seen my kid in a week.

792
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:39,211
Now get some sleep.

793
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:40,385
You look terrible.

794
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:42,042
Jesus.

795
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,768
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

796
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,804
You look tired.

797
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:46,771
All right.

798
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:47,703
Now, can I have the research

799
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:49,808
you were working on last night?

800
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:50,878
[cell phone buzzes]

801
00:42:50,913 --> 00:42:51,913
Please?

802
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:57,333
Hey, where are you?

803
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,161
Are you okay?

804
00:42:58,196 --> 00:42:59,507
[Marisol] Yeah. Sorry.

805
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,509
I was up all night
talking with Jason.

806
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:05,652
I told him about the
baby and he's excited.

807
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:07,999
He broke the restraining
order less than a week after.

808
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:09,794
[Marisol] No, I
asked him to come.

809
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:12,313
What?

810
00:43:12,348 --> 00:43:13,908
[Marisol] I thought
I texted you that.

811
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,730
Maybe you did.

812
00:43:17,353 --> 00:43:19,424
[Marisol] We're gonna
make a plan like you said,

813
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:22,151
and maybe you're right.

814
00:43:23,428 --> 00:43:24,912
I should have
waited to tell him,

815
00:43:24,947 --> 00:43:28,951
but I'm just so
tired of secrets.

816
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:32,610
Of course.

817
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:35,716
[Marisol] Last night was
the first time in so long

818
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:38,512
I felt excited.

819
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:40,963
Is that crazy?

820
00:43:40,997 --> 00:43:43,517
[light music]

821
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,521
Hey.

822
00:43:47,555 --> 00:43:49,627
Hey.

823
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:50,661
You're back.

824
00:43:51,352 --> 00:43:52,352
I am.

825
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:18,172
You didn't do anything wrong.

826
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:19,518
It isn't like that at all.

827
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:24,144
It's just not developing the way

828
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:26,111
it should be at three
and a half weeks.

829
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,287
And probably this
week it'll feel

830
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:30,806
like you're having your period.

831
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,017
This is common, actually.

832
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:36,743
It doesn't mean
anything long term.

833
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,677
It happened to me
before Carly was born.

834
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,852
Twice actually.

835
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,097
I didn't know that.

836
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:52,655
After the second
time I was feeling

837
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:59,662
really low and Jay said,

838
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,010
maybe we should take this
opportunity to work on ourselves.

839
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:08,982
Set some goals, learn
a new instrument.

840
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,813
Really decide who we wanna be.

841
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:15,642
Did you do it?

842
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:19,199
No, maybe he did.

843
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:22,477
I...

844
00:45:23,997 --> 00:45:27,552
just wanted to be sad
for a little while.

845
00:45:31,383 --> 00:45:33,869
[light music]

846
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:03,691
[suspenseful music]

847
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:22,813
Relieved I guess.

848
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,129
At least that way we have
time to figure things out.

849
00:46:30,649 --> 00:46:32,720
If we want that.

850
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:33,756
[Caller] If we do.

851
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:38,347
I'm sorry.

852
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:39,421
I didn't return your calls

853
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:42,800
I was going through something.

854
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:43,834
I can't explain it.

855
00:46:45,526 --> 00:46:46,526
Wow.

856
00:46:47,459 --> 00:46:51,567
If you wanna try I'm here.

857
00:47:00,265 --> 00:47:01,795
[Charlie] Hey
Christina, it's Charlie.

858
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,476
Andy said you might have some
time today to work on a brief.

859
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:06,720
So I figured I'd
call you and see.

860
00:47:06,754 --> 00:47:08,929
[Caller] Andy's
really stressed out

861
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:10,320
and he's wondering
where you are and-

862
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:11,587
[Caller 2] Hey Christina,

863
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,210
wondering if we had some
time today or tomorrow.

864
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:15,453
[Andy] Hey, Christina,

865
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:17,662
what the hell were
you thinking today?

866
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:19,767
Are you on your way
to Cleveland or not?

867
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:21,769
And also have you been
working on that petition?

868
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:23,564
[Bob] Hey Bob from Li tech,

869
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,808
I'm actually gonna
need some more.

870
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,983
[Caller 4] Hey Christina,
I still haven't heard.

871
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:31,296
[Gloria] Please call me back.

872
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:33,160
I'd like to see you
before you leave.

873
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:47,209
[light music]

874
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,968
[Christina] I'm right outside.

875
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:23,002
Where?

876
00:48:36,603 --> 00:48:37,845
Have you been paying off

877
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,951
my student loans with
your retirement money?

878
00:48:44,197 --> 00:48:44,991
Not all of them.

879
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:45,992
Just a little.

880
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:48,097
I never asked you to do that.

881
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:53,378
Did you know your grandma
sent me her pension checks.

882
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:56,588
It killed me.

883
00:48:56,623 --> 00:48:59,833
It started when you were little
and I was still in school.

884
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:00,867
What was I gonna do?

885
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,320
But I took them
and I give you some

886
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:06,978
of mine so I can remember her.

887
00:49:07,013 --> 00:49:08,013
And because,

888
00:49:11,603 --> 00:49:12,708
you are special,

889
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:17,333
I knew it from the first
moment I held you in my arms.

890
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:20,060
It was like a lightning
bolt went off.

891
00:49:21,234 --> 00:49:24,271
I knew you were meant
for great things.

892
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:28,103
And here you are partnership
now and who knows?

893
00:49:28,137 --> 00:49:29,380
I'm not gonna be partner.

894
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:30,898
Why would you say that?

895
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:34,178
I just do the same
thing every day.

896
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:36,559
Day after day, I write about it.

897
00:49:36,594 --> 00:49:37,388
I prayed about it.

898
00:49:37,422 --> 00:49:38,665
I'm done.

899
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:40,194
And I don't, maybe
I'll come back here.

900
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:41,426
I just wanna start over.

901
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:43,497
No, no, no, no, no,
[speaks in Spanish],

902
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:45,499
listen, you're not quitting.

903
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:46,742
You've worked too hard.

904
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:48,088
You've come too far.

905
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:49,193
Look at you.

906
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:50,470
Look at what you do.

907
00:49:50,504 --> 00:49:52,299
I don't help anyone.

908
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:53,887
Think about the
people you could help

909
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:54,715
as a partner at the firm.

910
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,958
Now it don't matter.

911
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,098
It's important, Christina.

912
00:49:58,133 --> 00:49:59,133
Don't do that.

913
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:04,931
Okay.

914
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:07,797
So now you know what you want

915
00:50:07,832 --> 00:50:10,007
and what you don't
and it's out and good.

916
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:16,841
But running won't help
you, you need more time.

917
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,015
Let it come,

918
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:27,024
until then you've got
to go back California.

919
00:50:27,783 --> 00:50:29,647
I can't even do that.

920
00:50:29,681 --> 00:50:31,200
I have to go to Cleveland.

921
00:50:31,235 --> 00:50:35,791
Then you go and you take my
love with you wherever you go.

922
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:38,551
We're pioneers.

923
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,210
Remember when I told you that?

924
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,076
[speaks in Spanish]

925
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:47,561
[light music]

926
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:54,120
I think about you all the time.

927
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:02,266
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-Hm.

928
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:08,686
Call me when you get there.

929
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:01,842
Excuse me.

930
00:52:01,877 --> 00:52:02,843
Good morning.

931
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:04,224
- Thank you.
- Yes.

932
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:06,502
There's no parent
coordinator on the east door.

933
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:08,504
Vicky's already
heading down that way.

934
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:09,885
You ready for your big weekend?

935
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:11,173
I'm going to keep power walking

936
00:52:11,197 --> 00:52:12,853
until I fit into that dress.

937
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:15,615
Another parent tour?

938
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:16,478
Yes.

939
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,273
You have any of those?

940
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:19,515
[speaks in Spanish]

941
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,792
Pasculi's got that one,

942
00:52:20,827 --> 00:52:22,277
Regaria's got the one upstairs.

943
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:24,244
We had a vandalism
in the bathroom.

944
00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:26,315
Pauli's on his way
now to clean it up.

945
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:27,144
More of the same.

946
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:28,352
Yeah.

947
00:52:28,386 --> 00:52:29,501
There's definitely some genital

948
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:32,908
like drawings
reminds me of Carlos.

949
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:33,909
Vegas, I remember.

950
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,117
Yes.

951
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,118
Excuse me, did
you wash your hands?

952
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,050
No.

953
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:38,327
Go back in there.

954
00:52:38,362 --> 00:52:40,502
I shouldn't have to
keep reminding you.

955
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:43,298
Patricia asked me to tell
you that your doctor called.

956
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:44,368
Oh, what's wrong?

957
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:45,610
Ray's feeling a little sick

958
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:47,302
and the nurse won't
be in until nine.

959
00:52:47,336 --> 00:52:48,648
Hm.

960
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:52,238
[both speaking in Spanish]

961
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:01,764
Take him to the office
and get him a bucket.

962
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:03,249
Feel better, buddy. Come on.

963
00:53:05,561 --> 00:53:06,769
Remember that we have the vote

964
00:53:06,804 --> 00:53:08,944
for honor society
today at lunch.

965
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,187
We already did that.

966
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:11,681
Yeah, but we needed
to reschedule that one.

967
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:13,190
Excuse me,

968
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,881
you just wasted five minutes

969
00:53:14,915 --> 00:53:18,160
of your class time and
you can't get that back.

970
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,195
Go.

971
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:22,060
Reminder 9:30,

972
00:53:22,095 --> 00:53:24,787
we're going to be sitting in
on Karen's new drama unit.

973
00:53:24,822 --> 00:53:27,041
As soon as I are you going
to sneak in all those things?

974
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:28,550
I just thought we'd go and see.

975
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:29,689
It could be fun.

976
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:30,897
Yes. It could be fun.

977
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:33,589
But what's the purpose or is it

978
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:34,866
just another entertaining thing

979
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:36,351
someone is asking them to do?

980
00:53:39,423 --> 00:53:42,564
[speaking in Spanish]

981
00:54:00,306 --> 00:54:02,963
So we have Roberto
from Mrs. Earls class

982
00:54:02,998 --> 00:54:04,379
to join you this morning.

983
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:05,449
Wonderful.

984
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:12,421
Good morning students
and teachers.

985
00:54:12,456 --> 00:54:14,803
My special guest for
morning announcements

986
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:18,013
is Roberto from
Miss Earl's class.

987
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:20,153
And what is this
nurse showing us?

988
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:22,189
It's my all about sharks.

989
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:23,443
And what's it all about peace?

990
00:54:23,467 --> 00:54:24,364
Is it a story?

991
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:27,436
No. It's a research report.

992
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:28,817
Just to read it
all about a topic.

993
00:54:28,851 --> 00:54:30,232
And what are these parts?

994
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,303
Shark habitat, shark diet.

995
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:34,512
How do sharks
protect themselves?

996
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:36,273
My chapters.

997
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:41,278
What a smart idea to organize
your report into chapters.

998
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:43,931
Are you ready for
the pledge, Roberto?

999
00:54:45,351 --> 00:54:47,387
A pledge allegiance.

1000
00:54:47,422 --> 00:54:48,837
To the flag.

1001
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:52,081
To the flag of the
United States of America.

1002
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:54,429
What's your character's name?

1003
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,913
- Caroline.
- Caroline.

1004
00:54:55,947 --> 00:54:57,328
Oh, that's a fun name.

1005
00:54:57,363 --> 00:54:58,916
Hey, how does Caroline move?

1006
00:55:01,436 --> 00:55:04,853
Oh, kind like a
Do-si-do sort of thing.

1007
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:06,555
Okay, well now you're
building a character.

1008
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:07,579
That's awesome.

1009
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:13,482
Thanks.

1010
00:55:13,517 --> 00:55:15,519
Do you have the attendance too?

1011
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:17,555
Yep. Got that right?

1012
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:21,076
You haven't heard anything

1013
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,217
from the superintendent
yet, have you?

1014
00:55:24,251 --> 00:55:25,494
Heard what?

1015
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:26,702
Well, you know,

1016
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:28,186
I know they have
to open up your job

1017
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:30,982
to the whole district
once you retire next week.

1018
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:33,778
I just wondering if you hear
anything from Carmen yet?

1019
00:55:33,813 --> 00:55:34,813
Nothing.

1020
00:55:35,884 --> 00:55:37,955
How's the basement coming along?

1021
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:40,854
Oh, well we have rented

1022
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:43,616
a power standard
for the weekend.

1023
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,618
I just, I hope that Tina knows

1024
00:55:45,652 --> 00:55:48,483
what she's doing
because I do not.

1025
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:51,002
Aren't you eating?

1026
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:56,007
Hey, remember that

1027
00:55:56,042 --> 00:55:58,872
We have the vote for
Student Honor Society.

1028
00:55:58,907 --> 00:56:00,115
We already voted.

1029
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:01,323
Yes. Yep.

1030
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,326
But we really need
to vote again.

1031
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,500
Why.

1032
00:56:08,675 --> 00:56:10,125
No.

1033
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:11,471
Agnes already bought the cake?

1034
00:56:11,506 --> 00:56:14,750
I told you absolutely no party.

1035
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:17,752
You did.

1036
00:56:18,996 --> 00:56:20,307
And Agnes bought a cake.

1037
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:21,964
Surprise!

1038
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:24,484
[all applaud]

1039
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,249
[all cheer]

1040
00:56:31,284 --> 00:56:32,699
So you obviously,

1041
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:34,874
you don't officially retire
for another two weeks.

1042
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:36,393
Don't say that word.

1043
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:37,635
Yes.

1044
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,199
But we just wanted an
opportunity to thank you

1045
00:56:39,223 --> 00:56:41,605
for all the amazing
work you've done here.

1046
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,434
It's 12 straight years, right?

1047
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,194
Yes.
- Yeah.

1048
00:56:45,229 --> 00:56:46,403
12 straight years

1049
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:48,888
of the highest ELA
scores district-wide.

1050
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:51,304
That's you.

1051
00:56:51,338 --> 00:56:52,132
Okay.

1052
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:53,340
All right. All right.

1053
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:55,446
And obviously we
moved up your party

1054
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:57,241
a little bit
because we also know

1055
00:56:57,275 --> 00:56:58,794
this is a big weekend for you.

1056
00:57:00,278 --> 00:57:01,798
And we wanted the
opportunity to invite

1057
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:03,661
a special guest
from out of town.

1058
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,771
Oh my God, my baby's here.

1059
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,951
Oh congratulations.

1060
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:19,643
Thank you.

1061
00:57:19,677 --> 00:57:23,647
I'm going to be such a wreck
before the wedding even starts.

1062
00:57:24,717 --> 00:57:27,444
Look at this
beautiful bride to be.

1063
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:28,478
Aww.

1064
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:31,378
I better speak
quickly so we can get

1065
00:57:31,413 --> 00:57:32,449
the kids back to work.

1066
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:33,726
Yes.

1067
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,901
But my God, for one time,

1068
00:57:36,936 --> 00:57:38,178
I don't know what to say.

1069
00:57:40,284 --> 00:57:42,286
My heart is full.

1070
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,806
[light music]

1071
00:57:57,715 --> 00:58:00,511
Of course the prayer
is much longer in Hebrew.

1072
00:58:00,546 --> 00:58:03,583
But in essence, what
it says is blessed art

1073
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:07,794
thou oh Lord, our God, master
of the universe, et cetera.

1074
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:10,107
And then Helena,

1075
00:58:10,141 --> 00:58:14,352
you will come up and present
Christina with your necklace.

1076
00:58:14,387 --> 00:58:15,664
Oh, you can practice that.

1077
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:16,976
Thank you, Rabbi.

1078
00:58:18,253 --> 00:58:19,530
You look beautiful.

1079
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:22,844
So tall, so thin, so
good for our gene pool.

1080
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:26,606
Thank you.

1081
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:28,435
And then I will
circle behind you,

1082
00:58:30,023 --> 00:58:33,095
I will put on this
precious necklace.

1083
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:36,789
I will lean over to
my boy and I will say,

1084
00:58:36,823 --> 00:58:38,066
I love you, son,

1085
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,896
son, good luck.

1086
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:41,931
Thank you, Helena.

1087
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:47,040
So I'll just be standing
here holding the stick.

1088
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:49,802
You'll be holding up
the pole of the huppah.

1089
00:58:49,836 --> 00:58:52,149
[speaking in Spanish]

1090
00:58:52,183 --> 00:58:54,013
And then the Christina,

1091
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:57,430
you will circle Robert
seven times to the left.

1092
00:58:57,464 --> 00:58:58,880
Practice, go ahead.

1093
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:01,330
[light music]

1094
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:09,062
And what's all this
with the necklace.

1095
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:10,547
Is that a Jewish thing too?

1096
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,007
All the women in
Bobby's family wear

1097
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:13,653
that necklace on
their wedding day.

1098
00:59:13,688 --> 00:59:17,864
And did Art use it for his
next two wives after Helena?

1099
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:21,696
You told me a rabbi and a
priest were officiating.

1100
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:23,801
[speaks in Spanish].

1101
00:59:23,836 --> 00:59:25,734
I explained all this
three times in an email.

1102
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:28,254
Yes, and I said I wanted
to talk with you about it.

1103
00:59:28,288 --> 00:59:30,118
Why didn't you call me?

1104
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:32,292
[speaks in Spanish].

1105
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:33,570
Stop, stop, stop.

1106
00:59:35,123 --> 00:59:37,435
I don't wanna have this
conversation right now.

1107
00:59:42,026 --> 00:59:44,995
When then, because I
really wanna speak with you.

1108
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:47,722
Can we have dinner?

1109
00:59:47,756 --> 00:59:51,588
I'll come to the hotel afterwards
and we can go for a walk.

1110
00:59:51,622 --> 00:59:53,393
I'm just excited for us
all to sit together now

1111
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:54,556
and just celebrate.

1112
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:57,696
Mom?

1113
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:02,081
[clinking]

1114
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:12,229
Bobby, your family
has been wonderful

1115
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:17,234
and welcoming and your
father Art and Gemma.

1116
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:20,444
So kind of you to
host this dinner.

1117
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:26,139
And of course,
thank you, Helena.

1118
01:00:26,174 --> 01:00:28,452
I know my baby's very loved.

1119
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:31,766
I was watching
Christina practicing

1120
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,216
the circling with
Rabbi Winthrop.

1121
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:35,252
Weinthrob.

1122
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:37,564
I'm sorry, Weinthrob.

1123
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:44,364
And I could see her passing
when she was a little girl

1124
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:47,195
running around my
school and I could

1125
01:00:47,229 --> 01:00:49,646
also see her again in my school.

1126
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:52,787
When was this?

1127
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:53,821
Five years ago?

1128
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,482
She had just graduated
from law school

1129
01:00:58,516 --> 01:01:00,726
and I had her come to
speak to my students,

1130
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,624
wearing her cap and gown.

1131
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:07,836
Christina told me she
was moving to California.

1132
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:10,425
I said, what?

1133
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,459
California?

1134
01:01:13,117 --> 01:01:14,567
Just a couple of years.

1135
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:15,810
That was the plan.

1136
01:01:16,776 --> 01:01:18,019
Remember what I said?

1137
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:22,506
You might meet
someone out there.

1138
01:01:27,373 --> 01:01:28,581
Salud.

1139
01:01:28,615 --> 01:01:29,789
[All] Salud.

1140
01:01:29,824 --> 01:01:31,446
[clinking]

1141
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,966
[light music]

1142
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:17,216
[speaking in Spanish].

1143
01:02:31,023 --> 01:02:34,336
Bobby, [speaks in Spanish],

1144
01:02:34,371 --> 01:02:36,476
tax attorney with
irritable bowel syndrome.

1145
01:02:37,684 --> 01:02:38,684
Huh.

1146
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:42,413
[speaks in Spanish]

1147
01:02:57,497 --> 01:02:59,741
[knocking]

1148
01:03:02,986 --> 01:03:04,504
I heard you come in.

1149
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:05,816
I'm in the adjoining room.

1150
01:03:07,266 --> 01:03:09,337
Hi.

1151
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:11,063
I would like to invite you in,

1152
01:03:11,097 --> 01:03:13,272
but I am supposed to
meet Christina outside.

1153
01:03:13,306 --> 01:03:14,894
We're going for a walk.

1154
01:03:14,929 --> 01:03:16,654
Oh lovely.

1155
01:03:18,277 --> 01:03:19,485
It was a wonderful night.

1156
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:20,519
Yes.

1157
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:24,076
Let me ask you
something, Gloria.

1158
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:28,149
What do you think about my
ex-husband's latest wife?

1159
01:03:30,392 --> 01:03:31,566
- Jim?
- Yeah.

1160
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:33,982
Seems lovely.

1161
01:03:34,017 --> 01:03:35,397
Lovely.

1162
01:03:35,432 --> 01:03:36,536
Is she even 12?

1163
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:44,061
Christina says you
dabble in fortune telling.

1164
01:03:44,096 --> 01:03:45,407
Yeah, sometimes,

1165
01:03:46,443 --> 01:03:47,651
but mainly it's just,

1166
01:03:49,446 --> 01:03:50,792
just nonsense.

1167
01:03:52,483 --> 01:03:56,556
Well, I'll let you
go, have a good walk.

1168
01:03:56,591 --> 01:03:58,248
If you can't sleep, knock.

1169
01:03:59,456 --> 01:04:02,217
- Thank you, Helena.
- Of course.

1170
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:04,875
[cell phone ringing]

1171
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,395
[light music]

1172
01:04:11,744 --> 01:04:13,228
[Christina] Hi, it's Christina.

1173
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:15,713
I can't take your call to
please leave a message.

1174
01:04:15,748 --> 01:04:17,025
Christina.

1175
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,371
I've called you.

1176
01:04:19,994 --> 01:04:20,891
Christina.

1177
01:04:20,926 --> 01:04:22,893
I've left you two messages now,

1178
01:04:22,928 --> 01:04:24,861
please let me know
you're okay, please.

1179
01:05:01,035 --> 01:05:03,520
[eerie music]

1180
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:11,045
I keep having this
dream that there's

1181
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,978
a light coming out of my chest.

1182
01:05:14,565 --> 01:05:15,808
Is that crazy?

1183
01:05:16,982 --> 01:05:19,294
Maybe my subconscious
know something I don't,

1184
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:24,299
like maybe it's related
to this problem.

1185
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:26,439
Well, I wouldn't
call it a problem.

1186
01:05:26,474 --> 01:05:27,554
Your blood work looks good.

1187
01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:33,653
TSH is up a bit.

1188
01:05:33,688 --> 01:05:35,517
Your ultrasound did show

1189
01:05:35,552 --> 01:05:38,451
one of your nodules has
gotten slightly bigger.

1190
01:05:38,486 --> 01:05:39,763
It's most likely nothing,

1191
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,940
but I'd like to
schedule a biopsy.

1192
01:05:45,493 --> 01:05:47,426
My daughter's
wedding is coming up.

1193
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:48,945
We'll have the results quickly.

1194
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:50,715
It's likely we just need to
change your prescription.

1195
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:51,844
I know how this goes.

1196
01:05:51,878 --> 01:05:53,363
I've been through it before.

1197
01:05:53,397 --> 01:05:56,642
I remember, but you don't
know how it's going to go.

1198
01:05:56,676 --> 01:05:59,369
Well, I do know
something's wrong,

1199
01:05:59,403 --> 01:06:03,028
and I don't know what I
should tell Christina.

1200
01:06:06,238 --> 01:06:07,518
Can I share something with you?

1201
01:06:10,897 --> 01:06:12,416
I dream about baseball,

1202
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:15,799
every night,

1203
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:18,077
just hitting the
ball to the left side

1204
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:20,597
of the infield and
running around the bases.

1205
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:22,979
And I never get to home plate.

1206
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:26,361
I just keep hitting it to
third base and running.

1207
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:28,546
Why the left side of the field?

1208
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:29,570
I don't know.

1209
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:32,367
I haven't picked up
a bat in 30 years.

1210
01:06:32,402 --> 01:06:33,748
It doesn't make any sense,

1211
01:06:35,405 --> 01:06:40,065
but every night there
I am running the bases.

1212
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:44,276
[light music]

1213
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:56,633
Excuse me.

1214
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:57,461
Good morning.

1215
01:06:57,496 --> 01:06:58,842
Thanks.

1216
01:06:58,876 --> 01:07:00,544
There's no parent
coordinator on the east door.

1217
01:07:00,568 --> 01:07:02,673
Vicky's already
heading down there.

1218
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:03,926
You ready for your big weekend?

1219
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:05,366
I'm going to keep power walking

1220
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,540
until I can fit into that dress.

1221
01:07:07,575 --> 01:07:08,886
Another parent tour.

1222
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:09,715
Yes.

1223
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:10,681
[speaks in Spanish].

1224
01:07:10,716 --> 01:07:12,097
Yeah. Pesculi's got that one.

1225
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:14,444
So there was another
incident in the bathroom.

1226
01:07:14,478 --> 01:07:17,343
More drawings.

1227
01:07:17,378 --> 01:07:18,965
Holly's on his way there now.

1228
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,415
Okay, I think we're gonna get-

1229
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,934
I didn't do it.

1230
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:23,912
I believe you, go back in
there and wash your hands.

1231
01:07:23,936 --> 01:07:25,351
I already did.

1232
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:27,008
Then go to class.

1233
01:07:37,156 --> 01:07:38,640
Reminds me of Carlos.

1234
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:40,608
- Rodriguez.
- Yeah.

1235
01:07:40,642 --> 01:07:41,712
Not as bad.

1236
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:44,957
Tell the teachers to
check their bathroom logs

1237
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:46,545
and to send me a list of boys

1238
01:07:46,579 --> 01:07:49,306
who went to the bathroom
between eight and 9:00 a.m.

1239
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:51,032
I promise you it was not me.

1240
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,758
Excuse me.

1241
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:54,000
Excuse me?

1242
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:55,381
Can I help with?

1243
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,589
Yes, please.

1244
01:07:56,624 --> 01:07:58,074
With Christina.

1245
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:00,006
That's my daughter's name.

1246
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,353
Let's take a walk, Christina

1247
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,257
Did your class make these?

1248
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:10,086
Yeah.

1249
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,397
Which one is yours?

1250
01:08:11,432 --> 01:08:12,432
This one.

1251
01:08:14,814 --> 01:08:17,058
How did you think of your story?

1252
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,715
My family goes to the beach

1253
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:21,200
a lot and I was the only kid who

1254
01:08:21,235 --> 01:08:24,410
didn't know how to swim and
everybody else knew how to swim.

1255
01:08:24,445 --> 01:08:26,412
So when I finally learned I-

1256
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:29,070
[light music]

1257
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,105
Mommy?

1258
01:08:32,694 --> 01:08:35,870
[speaking in Spanish]

1259
01:08:39,391 --> 01:08:41,393
You're analyzing poetry

1260
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:46,087
and writing plays and
even learning Latin.

1261
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:48,952
I can't give you that here.

1262
01:08:48,986 --> 01:08:51,748
All I do is test, test, test.

1263
01:08:51,782 --> 01:08:52,783
[speaks in Spanish]

1264
01:08:52,818 --> 01:08:53,818
Someday you will

1265
01:08:54,613 --> 01:08:57,754
[speaking in Spanish]

1266
01:09:04,312 --> 01:09:05,312
Hush.

1267
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:11,354
Someday you will be
a poet or a doctor.

1268
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:15,323
Anything you want,
we're pioneers,

1269
01:09:15,358 --> 01:09:17,394
we're doing things in our family

1270
01:09:17,429 --> 01:09:20,673
no one has ever done.

1271
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:21,916
Be proud.

1272
01:09:23,124 --> 01:09:24,124
Okay?

1273
01:09:28,716 --> 01:09:32,409
Vika's here, she'll
take you on the train

1274
01:09:32,444 --> 01:09:33,617
up to your school.

1275
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:36,862
[speaking in Spanish].

1276
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:03,233
Oh, we have Roberto from Mrs.

1277
01:10:03,268 --> 01:10:04,959
Earl's class joining
this morning.

1278
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,960
Wonderful.

1279
01:10:16,557 --> 01:10:17,730
Good morning.

1280
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:20,595
My special guest for
morning announcements is

1281
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,532
Roberto from Miss Earl's class.

1282
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:28,465
What is this you're showing us.

1283
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,984
It's my all about sharks piece.

1284
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:33,574
Good, now you are
building a story.

1285
01:10:33,608 --> 01:10:37,267
I think we need
another volunteer.

1286
01:10:37,302 --> 01:10:38,751
What's your character's name?

1287
01:10:40,995 --> 01:10:43,204
- Me?
- Yeah.

1288
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,619
- Richard.
- No, no.

1289
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:46,690
Now not your real name.

1290
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:48,485
Your character's name?

1291
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,660
- Richard.
- Okay.

1292
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:54,526
Good. Good.

1293
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,941
Now how does your
character walk?

1294
01:10:55,975 --> 01:10:57,391
Come on up.

1295
01:10:57,425 --> 01:10:58,425
Yeah, well.

1296
01:10:59,496 --> 01:11:00,704
Yeah, come on.

1297
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:04,121
Oh yeah, okay.

1298
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:08,540
Midgard, he walks with a smile.

1299
01:11:08,574 --> 01:11:09,574
Ooh.

1300
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,476
Yeah, I used to be six feet,

1301
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:16,720
but now I think I've
shrunk an inch or two.

1302
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:21,725
In fact, I'm afraid
to measure myself.

1303
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:23,727
Ooh.

1304
01:11:23,762 --> 01:11:27,317
See, now that's good because
now we know a secret.

1305
01:11:27,352 --> 01:11:30,286
You are afraid to
measure yourself.

1306
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,564
So when was the first
time that you started

1307
01:11:32,598 --> 01:11:34,876
to thank you were shrinking?

1308
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:39,881
Ah, yeah, that happened when
I first started working here.

1309
01:11:40,365 --> 01:11:40,848
Oh.

1310
01:11:40,882 --> 01:11:42,090
Yeah.

1311
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:45,231
And when I first
met Miss Hernandez,

1312
01:11:45,266 --> 01:11:47,475
I mean Miss Smir Hernandez.

1313
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,098
Right?

1314
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:51,065
That's right.

1315
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:52,756
I'm just observing here.

1316
01:11:57,174 --> 01:12:01,558
So when I showed up the
first day I started shrinking.

1317
01:12:12,638 --> 01:12:15,641
Here comes Miss Smir Hernandez.

1318
01:12:15,676 --> 01:12:16,642
Shrinking, huh?

1319
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:18,541
Yep, I was just that day-

1320
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:19,438
Shrinking.

1321
01:12:19,473 --> 01:12:20,473
Mm. Yep.

1322
01:12:29,931 --> 01:12:31,899
The first thing
you need to know,

1323
01:12:31,933 --> 01:12:36,248
if you want to work here
is you need a calendar.

1324
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:40,390
Anything that needs to
happen goes on the calendar.

1325
01:12:40,425 --> 01:12:44,325
Otherwise everything gets
away and nothing gets done.

1326
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,259
Parent workshops, you
put it on the calendar,

1327
01:12:47,293 --> 01:12:49,434
teacher evaluations
on the calendar.

1328
01:12:49,468 --> 01:12:51,712
You don't want your
mailbox overflowing.

1329
01:12:51,746 --> 01:12:54,680
You want to know when
you're going to answer them.

1330
01:12:54,715 --> 01:12:55,854
Put that time.

1331
01:12:55,888 --> 01:12:56,888
[All] On the calendar.

1332
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,409
Time to eat.

1333
01:12:59,444 --> 01:13:01,549
[All] On the calendar.

1334
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:04,000
Well, when do we go home?

1335
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:06,589
Home, we sleep on the desks.

1336
01:13:07,486 --> 01:13:08,936
What do I tell my wife.

1337
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:10,627
To bring us sleeping bag.

1338
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:13,216
Excellent. Okay.

1339
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,597
Let's line up over here so we

1340
01:13:14,631 --> 01:13:16,668
can do the next
character exercise.

1341
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:32,580
[speaking in Spanish]

1342
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:22,863
Did you know that
Tina keeps a journal?

1343
01:15:28,282 --> 01:15:29,904
Is that something
most people do?

1344
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:33,321
I don't know.

1345
01:15:33,356 --> 01:15:34,495
Do you?

1346
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,530
No.

1347
01:15:37,636 --> 01:15:38,775
Are you eating?

1348
01:15:41,882 --> 01:15:44,367
I was cleaning out
our bedroom, you know,

1349
01:15:44,401 --> 01:15:47,094
for the new flooring
and I grabbed a bunch

1350
01:15:47,128 --> 01:15:50,960
of books and it just, it
fell and flipped open.

1351
01:15:50,994 --> 01:15:55,965
I didn't even realized what
it was at first, you know?

1352
01:15:57,173 --> 01:15:58,453
And it was mostly
about our kids.

1353
01:15:58,864 --> 01:16:00,279
Yeah, but the weird thing is,

1354
01:16:04,007 --> 01:16:05,388
she didn't even mention me.

1355
01:16:07,528 --> 01:16:08,978
I just, I stopped
reading about her

1356
01:16:09,012 --> 01:16:13,016
and just started looking
for a little clue about me.

1357
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:16,192
Why are you telling me this?

1358
01:16:18,194 --> 01:16:20,852
Have you heard anything
from the superintendent yet?

1359
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:23,439
No.

1360
01:16:28,929 --> 01:16:29,929
Hey.

1361
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,253
Remember that we have the vote

1362
01:16:32,277 --> 01:16:35,901
for the Student Honor Society.

1363
01:16:35,936 --> 01:16:36,868
What?

1364
01:16:36,902 --> 01:16:38,076
Surprise!

1365
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:40,768
[all applaud]

1366
01:16:40,803 --> 01:16:42,287
And obviously

1367
01:16:42,321 --> 01:16:43,505
we moved up the
party a little bit

1368
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:47,188
because this is a very
special weekend for you.

1369
01:16:47,223 --> 01:16:50,226
Andy gave us the
opportunity to invite

1370
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:52,193
a special guest
from out of town.

1371
01:16:54,471 --> 01:16:55,472
Oh my God.

1372
01:16:56,335 --> 01:16:57,751
[all cheer]

1373
01:16:57,785 --> 01:16:59,028
My baby's here.

1374
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,137
Surprise.

1375
01:17:05,172 --> 01:17:06,172
I,

1376
01:17:07,312 --> 01:17:09,176
When I began here.

1377
01:17:11,972 --> 01:17:13,456
It's true.

1378
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,147
We're supposed to be shut down.

1379
01:17:16,459 --> 01:17:19,186
We sometimes had
police in the building,

1380
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,291
running down the halls, right?

1381
01:17:23,984 --> 01:17:25,330
I think about that a lot.

1382
01:17:27,228 --> 01:17:30,197
I wasn't even certified
yet to be a principal.

1383
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:32,509
I was taking classes
on the weekends.

1384
01:17:33,579 --> 01:17:34,822
So I cleaned houses.

1385
01:17:36,928 --> 01:17:37,998
We had to pay for it.

1386
01:17:39,378 --> 01:17:41,208
I used to leave Christina
with a babysitter

1387
01:17:41,242 --> 01:17:44,418
who I think only spoke Polish.

1388
01:17:46,765 --> 01:17:48,180
On those nights,

1389
01:17:49,734 --> 01:17:51,977
coming home from Manhattan.

1390
01:17:52,012 --> 01:17:55,601
I'd be trying to write plans.

1391
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:58,535
But the progress
here was so slow

1392
01:18:00,123 --> 01:18:01,953
and I'd be thinking
on the train.

1393
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:08,649
It is so hard to love
other people's children

1394
01:18:09,892 --> 01:18:12,342
as much as you love your own.

1395
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:14,862
[light music]

1396
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:57,663
I was watching Christina
practicing the circling.

1397
01:18:58,561 --> 01:19:00,425
It was very evocative.

1398
01:19:02,461 --> 01:19:03,461
I could see her,

1399
01:19:08,019 --> 01:19:09,330
when she was a little girl,

1400
01:19:10,262 --> 01:19:11,747
she'd make a new friend.

1401
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,853
She'd load up this red wagon

1402
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:17,856
we got her and put all
her favorite toys on it

1403
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:20,721
and drag them over
to her friend's house

1404
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,827
and give them all to her friend.

1405
01:19:24,276 --> 01:19:26,658
It happened a few times.

1406
01:19:26,692 --> 01:19:28,694
She dragged this wagon onto

1407
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:31,663
the subway all the
way up to Park Avenue.

1408
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:39,015
Imagine the parents probably
worried we had bed bugs.

1409
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,401
I can see her now

1410
01:19:50,406 --> 01:19:52,408
dragging that little red wagon.

1411
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:56,481
I could get her a red
SUV if it would help.

1412
01:19:56,515 --> 01:19:57,827
Hilarious, Sandro.

1413
01:19:57,862 --> 01:20:00,312
- I'm just saying.
- Just hilarious.

1414
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,798
Generous bride.

1415
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,353
Lucky us, here's to them.

1416
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,563
The happy couple.
- The happy couple.

1417
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:12,221
[clinking]

1418
01:20:12,255 --> 01:20:14,775
[light music]

1419
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:25,475
[cell phone rings]

1420
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:32,828
[Christina] Hi, it's Christina.

1421
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:34,036
I can't take your call.

1422
01:20:36,072 --> 01:20:37,833
Christina, it's mom.

1423
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:38,867
Please call me.

1424
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,055
Hey, what is that?

1425
01:20:56,127 --> 01:20:57,335
Hey, stop.

1426
01:20:57,369 --> 01:20:58,681
Hey, hey, hey.

1427
01:20:58,715 --> 01:21:01,097
[light music]

1428
01:21:12,108 --> 01:21:14,352
[knocking]

1429
01:21:19,978 --> 01:21:22,153
Do you have anything
that can help me sleep?

1430
01:21:25,742 --> 01:21:26,742
Just one.

1431
01:21:29,988 --> 01:21:30,988
Gloria,

1432
01:21:33,302 --> 01:21:34,613
I wanna tell you something.

1433
01:21:37,582 --> 01:21:40,274
When I was getting
ready to marry Arthur,

1434
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:43,933
my mother tells me that
her mother had a necklace

1435
01:21:43,968 --> 01:21:45,383
with a different diamond on it

1436
01:21:45,417 --> 01:21:47,730
for every generation
of our family

1437
01:21:47,764 --> 01:21:50,250
going back hundreds,
hundreds of years,

1438
01:21:51,734 --> 01:21:52,769
our people were furriers.

1439
01:21:52,804 --> 01:21:53,804
They had money.

1440
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,221
The necklace she tells me

1441
01:21:57,429 --> 01:21:59,845
is like looking
into a kaleidoscope.

1442
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,746
It holds the history
of my entire family.

1443
01:22:05,196 --> 01:22:06,611
So many carats.

1444
01:22:13,204 --> 01:22:14,204
Here.

1445
01:22:15,447 --> 01:22:17,277
Just breathe this in normal.

1446
01:22:19,072 --> 01:22:20,432
- Oh no, no.
- You won't regret it.

1447
01:22:36,365 --> 01:22:38,574
[coughs]

1448
01:22:38,608 --> 01:22:39,608
Good. Good.

1449
01:22:50,793 --> 01:22:53,969
My grandmother, the
one with a necklace.

1450
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:57,420
Gassed at Auschwitz,

1451
01:22:58,456 --> 01:23:00,458
whole side of my family gone.

1452
01:23:01,838 --> 01:23:02,978
And those diamonds,

1453
01:23:04,358 --> 01:23:06,429
who the hell knows
who's wearing them now.

1454
01:23:07,948 --> 01:23:11,987
And my mother tells me this,
the night before my wedding,

1455
01:23:13,678 --> 01:23:17,302
and then she hands me this.

1456
01:23:20,857 --> 01:23:25,414
All of the life, my mother
Lily put away money bit by bit.

1457
01:23:25,448 --> 01:23:28,969
So that for my wedding,
she could buy me this.

1458
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,006
Go ahead.

1459
01:23:33,456 --> 01:23:34,456
You open it.

1460
01:23:38,944 --> 01:23:40,774
I only wish to God

1461
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:43,156
she were here to see
Christina wear it.

1462
01:23:46,607 --> 01:23:51,578
And tomorrow I will add another
diamond to it for Christina.

1463
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,065
I know it's a little bit
much, but that's my taste.

1464
01:23:58,654 --> 01:24:02,589
And someday she will give
this to her granddaughter.

1465
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:08,871
And if somebody takes
it, we start again.

1466
01:24:08,905 --> 01:24:10,814
You know, when I had cancer
and they had to operate,

1467
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,875
I decided great.

1468
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,740
I'm gonna get new breasts

1469
01:24:16,913 --> 01:24:19,192
and they're gonna
be better than ever.

1470
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:20,307
Who's that man who keeps rolling

1471
01:24:20,331 --> 01:24:22,954
the same Boulder up the hill?

1472
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:27,786
I don't know.

1473
01:24:27,821 --> 01:24:28,856
Well,

1474
01:24:32,757 --> 01:24:37,210
just keep,

1475
01:24:37,244 --> 01:24:39,281
I just keep rolling my boulder.

1476
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,321
And I've got my dignity.

1477
01:24:45,356 --> 01:24:46,357
Sound familiar?

1478
01:24:50,982 --> 01:24:52,604
Oh, whoa.

1479
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:53,536
No, no, no.

1480
01:24:53,571 --> 01:24:54,365
Just sit. Just sit.

1481
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:55,228
Just sit. Just sit.

1482
01:24:55,262 --> 01:24:56,608
Just sit, sit, sit.

1483
01:24:57,885 --> 01:24:59,335
You're okay.

1484
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,370
I'm just.

1485
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,270
Dizzy.

1486
01:25:03,305 --> 01:25:04,685
It's all right.

1487
01:25:05,617 --> 01:25:06,894
That's alright.

1488
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,000
Gloria.

1489
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:10,898
I think you're
searching for something.

1490
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,007
I just wanna talk to Christina.

1491
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:19,735
Do you know what
you would say to her?

1492
01:25:28,433 --> 01:25:29,433
Okay.

1493
01:25:32,506 --> 01:25:33,645
It's okay. It's okay.

1494
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,680
Listen to me.

1495
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:37,071
My mother taught
me how to do this

1496
01:25:37,097 --> 01:25:39,651
when I was a
little, little girl,

1497
01:25:39,686 --> 01:25:43,828
I cannot remember a time
when I could not read palms.

1498
01:25:45,243 --> 01:25:46,243
Trust me.

1499
01:25:52,664 --> 01:25:53,664
Close your eyes.

1500
01:25:54,632 --> 01:25:55,632
Really, do it.

1501
01:25:56,806 --> 01:25:58,153
Let everything go black.

1502
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:02,226
Now where we go.

1503
01:26:04,089 --> 01:26:07,023
[light music]

1504
01:26:07,058 --> 01:26:08,024
That's right.

1505
01:26:08,059 --> 01:26:09,060
Now breathe.

1506
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:18,103
Someone is writing on
the walls of your memory.

1507
01:26:21,106 --> 01:26:22,901
The words are in Spanish.

1508
01:26:25,835 --> 01:26:26,974
I can't greet them.

1509
01:26:32,877 --> 01:26:33,877
Morning.

1510
01:26:35,155 --> 01:26:37,468
There's no bearing
coordinator on the east door.

1511
01:26:37,502 --> 01:26:38,721
Vicky's heading
down there right now.

1512
01:26:38,745 --> 01:26:39,745
Wait.

1513
01:26:41,126 --> 01:26:42,507
There's been some vandalism.

1514
01:26:43,508 --> 01:26:45,752
[knocking]

1515
01:26:58,316 --> 01:26:59,179
I didn't do it.

1516
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,111
Go back to class.

1517
01:27:00,145 --> 01:27:01,145
Go.

1518
01:27:12,296 --> 01:27:14,367
Tell the teachers to
check their bathroom logs

1519
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,920
and to send me a
list of boys who went

1520
01:27:15,954 --> 01:27:17,162
to the bathroom between eight

1521
01:27:17,197 --> 01:27:19,234
and nine and check
their hands for ink.

1522
01:27:21,477 --> 01:27:22,754
What are they doing?

1523
01:27:22,789 --> 01:27:24,031
I don't know.

1524
01:27:24,066 --> 01:27:24,653
One of their parents
must have called them.

1525
01:27:24,687 --> 01:27:25,619
Excuse me.

1526
01:27:25,654 --> 01:27:27,000
Please wait in my office.

1527
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:28,312
Hello?

1528
01:27:28,346 --> 01:27:30,003
Where are they going?

1529
01:27:31,073 --> 01:27:32,385
It's not just in the bathroom.

1530
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:34,318
It's everywhere.

1531
01:27:38,598 --> 01:27:39,392
What are you doing?

1532
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:40,738
Get back to class now.

1533
01:27:40,772 --> 01:27:42,809
Let's go. Come on, go, go.

1534
01:27:46,951 --> 01:27:48,021
Get to class.

1535
01:27:49,229 --> 01:27:51,335
Your doctor's office
keeps calling.

1536
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:52,612
Not right now.

1537
01:27:52,646 --> 01:27:54,037
And Roberto from
Mrs. Earl's class

1538
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:55,349
is in your office is
waiting to do morning arch.

1539
01:27:55,373 --> 01:27:56,892
Can you handle that, please?

1540
01:27:56,926 --> 01:27:58,169
Handle it.

1541
01:27:58,203 --> 01:28:00,344
We've been working
together for 15 years

1542
01:28:00,378 --> 01:28:01,448
in the next two weeks

1543
01:28:01,483 --> 01:28:03,243
you'll be the
principal, act like it.

1544
01:28:07,523 --> 01:28:12,494
Okay.

1545
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:28,924
[speaking in Spanish]

1546
01:30:22,382 --> 01:30:23,763
Good, that's good.

1547
01:30:23,797 --> 01:30:25,637
Now you're building
memories for your character.

1548
01:30:25,661 --> 01:30:26,559
Great.

1549
01:30:26,593 --> 01:30:27,732
Now who's next.

1550
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:28,767
[All] Me, me, me.

1551
01:30:31,909 --> 01:30:32,979
Mom?

1552
01:30:34,532 --> 01:30:36,016
Christine.

1553
01:30:36,051 --> 01:30:37,224
I'm sorry.

1554
01:30:37,259 --> 01:30:39,088
We had an emergency here.

1555
01:30:39,123 --> 01:30:42,229
I wrote the play for you
and you didn't even come.

1556
01:30:42,264 --> 01:30:43,438
Well, tell me about it now.

1557
01:30:43,472 --> 01:30:44,472
No.

1558
01:30:45,129 --> 01:30:45,923
Well, wait, we wait.

1559
01:30:45,957 --> 01:30:48,028
Look at me, honey.

1560
01:30:48,063 --> 01:30:49,651
Look at me.

1561
01:30:49,685 --> 01:30:50,893
What was it about?

1562
01:30:52,412 --> 01:30:55,139
About a mommy who has a
light coming out of her chest.

1563
01:30:57,003 --> 01:30:58,349
Told you I didn't do it.

1564
01:30:58,383 --> 01:31:00,420
Found the boy responsible
for the vandalism.

1565
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:01,735
Let go of me now, let go of me.

1566
01:31:02,905 --> 01:31:03,734
Relax. Relax.

1567
01:31:03,768 --> 01:31:05,529
Excuse me. Let him go.

1568
01:31:05,563 --> 01:31:07,910
We don't have these
problems here anymore.

1569
01:31:07,945 --> 01:31:09,291
Ma'am did you look at his hands?

1570
01:31:09,325 --> 01:31:10,913
He's only 13.

1571
01:31:10,948 --> 01:31:11,880
Please let him go.

1572
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:14,917
Get these handcuffs off of him.

1573
01:31:14,952 --> 01:31:15,952
Let him go.

1574
01:31:16,954 --> 01:31:18,852
Christina, wait for me here.

1575
01:31:18,887 --> 01:31:20,820
Christina?

1576
01:31:20,854 --> 01:31:21,854
Christina?

1577
01:31:23,547 --> 01:31:24,962
Back inside, back inside,

1578
01:31:24,996 --> 01:31:27,067
get back into your classroom.

1579
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:28,690
Back to your class.

1580
01:31:29,932 --> 01:31:32,072
Back to class now.

1581
01:31:32,107 --> 01:31:33,107
Now.

1582
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:38,251
Christina?

1583
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:40,666
Christina?

1584
01:31:44,775 --> 01:31:45,948
Don't do that.

1585
01:31:45,983 --> 01:31:48,986
Don't touch the armor,
go to class now.

1586
01:31:50,366 --> 01:31:52,817
[light music]

1587
01:32:01,446 --> 01:32:02,931
[Christina] Mom.

1588
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:05,002
Christina,

1589
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:07,590
Christina.

1590
01:32:10,248 --> 01:32:11,595
Mom,

1591
01:32:14,563 --> 01:32:15,633
graduation was last week.

1592
01:32:15,668 --> 01:32:17,462
Do I really have to wear this?

1593
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:18,705
Yes.

1594
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:20,051
I want the students to know

1595
01:32:20,086 --> 01:32:21,846
what someone who graduates from

1596
01:32:21,881 --> 01:32:23,468
law school looks like,

1597
01:32:25,401 --> 01:32:27,127
look how beautiful you are.

1598
01:32:27,162 --> 01:32:28,162
Mom, stop.

1599
01:32:31,753 --> 01:32:33,720
I've been putting
this off all week.

1600
01:32:33,755 --> 01:32:34,997
So I'm just gonna say it.

1601
01:32:37,034 --> 01:32:39,036
I took a job in California.

1602
01:32:42,039 --> 01:32:43,523
California.

1603
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:46,768
They offered a lot of money,
way more than anyone else.

1604
01:32:46,802 --> 01:32:49,529
And you know how many
student loans I have?

1605
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,531
I'll go out for
a couple of years

1606
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,914
and I'll pay off my loans
and then I'll come back.

1607
01:32:54,948 --> 01:32:56,985
What if you meet
someone out there?

1608
01:32:57,019 --> 01:32:58,573
That's not gonna happen.

1609
01:32:58,607 --> 01:33:00,195
Why do you say that?

1610
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:03,681
Because I know guys aren't
exactly knocking down my door.

1611
01:33:03,716 --> 01:33:05,200
I mean, look at me.

1612
01:33:05,234 --> 01:33:06,477
I am looking.

1613
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:08,134
Yeah, I sound like
one thing and I look

1614
01:33:08,168 --> 01:33:10,515
like another, can't
figure myself out.

1615
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:12,725
I'm tired of trying
to be someone I'm not.

1616
01:33:14,209 --> 01:33:16,142
Besides, I like California,

1617
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:21,699
it's like a chance for
me to start over again.

1618
01:33:23,425 --> 01:33:25,323
You never mentioned
you were unhappy.

1619
01:33:26,877 --> 01:33:27,877
Mom.

1620
01:33:30,294 --> 01:33:33,090
You did everything
you had to do.

1621
01:33:33,124 --> 01:33:34,574
I know how lucky I am.

1622
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:39,337
It's just hard
disappointing you.

1623
01:33:41,443 --> 01:33:43,583
Hey.

1624
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,240
Hey.

1625
01:33:45,274 --> 01:33:46,068
Hey.

1626
01:33:46,103 --> 01:33:47,103
Hey.

1627
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:52,040
Remember we have the vote
for Student Honor Society.

1628
01:33:52,074 --> 01:33:52,937
What?

1629
01:33:52,972 --> 01:33:54,076
Surprise!

1630
01:33:54,111 --> 01:33:56,631
[all applaud]

1631
01:34:02,844 --> 01:34:04,500
Where's Christina?

1632
01:34:07,918 --> 01:34:09,333
Where's Christina

1633
01:34:22,346 --> 01:34:23,830
I'm feeling disoriented.

1634
01:34:28,939 --> 01:34:31,631
I feel like my heart's
skipping beats.

1635
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,220
I didn't hear any
irregularities in your heartbeat

1636
01:34:36,049 --> 01:34:41,020
and your blood work is fine.

1637
01:34:41,779 --> 01:34:44,092
TSH is up a bit though.

1638
01:34:45,058 --> 01:34:47,164
And your ultrasound did show one

1639
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:50,201
of your nodules
has gotten bigger.

1640
01:34:50,236 --> 01:34:55,206
It's probably nothing, but
I'd like to schedule a biopsy.

1641
01:34:56,173 --> 01:34:58,037
I know how this goes,

1642
01:34:58,071 --> 01:34:59,417
I've been through it before.

1643
01:34:59,452 --> 01:35:02,248
I remember, but with
Victor it was an MRI.

1644
01:35:04,837 --> 01:35:08,047
A lot of times spots can
show up on x-rays just

1645
01:35:08,081 --> 01:35:09,807
if you move around a little bit

1646
01:35:09,842 --> 01:35:11,533
when the picture's being taken,

1647
01:35:11,567 --> 01:35:14,432
but I'd like to schedule an MRI

1648
01:35:14,467 --> 01:35:17,159
just to rule out a few things.

1649
01:35:17,194 --> 01:35:19,023
What kinds of
things to rule out?

1650
01:35:20,162 --> 01:35:23,303
[speaking in Spanish]

1651
01:36:42,969 --> 01:36:45,523
Victor and I had
many good times.

1652
01:36:47,215 --> 01:36:49,734
Most of them, I
wish I had a camera,

1653
01:36:49,769 --> 01:36:51,633
but you can't stop to grab it.

1654
01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:58,571
You have to remember
it all, the feeling,

1655
01:36:59,572 --> 01:37:00,573
the warmth of it.

1656
01:37:04,784 --> 01:37:07,269
I think if we have
enough of those moments,

1657
01:37:10,169 --> 01:37:11,169
maybe they burn in,

1658
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:21,111
my mother was a woman
of very few words.

1659
01:37:22,112 --> 01:37:24,977
So when she spoke, you listened.

1660
01:37:26,633 --> 01:37:28,187
The night before my wedding,

1661
01:37:28,221 --> 01:37:29,844
she came in my room,

1662
01:37:29,878 --> 01:37:34,814
sat in my bed and talked
about marriage and my future.

1663
01:37:37,127 --> 01:37:39,715
So later tonight, Christina,

1664
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:42,615
you and I will have a nice talk.

1665
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:47,620
It all comes around like the
circle in your Jewish thing.

1666
01:37:55,145 --> 01:37:57,768
I can see you pulling
that wagon, honey,

1667
01:37:59,977 --> 01:38:02,324
what I wish I could do,

1668
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:05,051
what I wish I could
say to you then.

1669
01:38:07,985 --> 01:38:10,539
There are so many things
I would like to tell you,

1670
01:38:10,574 --> 01:38:14,198
but I'm supposed to make it
snappy because it's a total-

1671
01:38:14,233 --> 01:38:16,235
[crash]

1672
01:38:17,995 --> 01:38:18,995
Oh my God.

1673
01:38:20,756 --> 01:38:21,999
What am I trying to say?

1674
01:38:26,486 --> 01:38:27,625
I'm sorry.

1675
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,665
[light music]

1676
01:38:37,394 --> 01:38:40,776
[cell phone rings]

1677
01:38:40,811 --> 01:38:42,433
[Christina] Hi, it's Christina.

1678
01:38:42,468 --> 01:38:43,434
I can't take your call.

1679
01:38:43,469 --> 01:38:46,058
Please leave a message.

1680
01:38:46,092 --> 01:38:49,854
Christina, could
you please call me?

1681
01:38:56,068 --> 01:38:58,208
Can I make a prediction?

1682
01:39:01,245 --> 01:39:06,216
I think I know how it's gonna
go for you with your doctor.

1683
01:39:07,113 --> 01:39:11,566
The growth will be benign,

1684
01:39:12,877 --> 01:39:14,120
but they're gonna need to check

1685
01:39:14,155 --> 01:39:19,125
you every six months
again, again and again.

1686
01:39:20,747 --> 01:39:24,751
And that may be hard.

1687
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:28,963
Like that, man,

1688
01:39:28,997 --> 01:39:31,689
with a sword tied to one string

1689
01:39:31,724 --> 01:39:33,968
forever hanging over his head.

1690
01:39:34,002 --> 01:39:35,141
What's that guy's name,

1691
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:38,765
or whatever.

1692
01:39:40,767 --> 01:39:43,632
And you'll ask me, am
I gonna live with that?

1693
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,913
And I'll tell you
that it takes time,

1694
01:39:50,363 --> 01:39:51,157
and you'll say,

1695
01:39:51,192 --> 01:39:52,848
but I don't have time.

1696
01:39:54,126 --> 01:39:58,785
And I'll answer time

1697
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:00,235
is everything.

1698
01:40:02,582 --> 01:40:04,481
[thud]

1699
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:07,518
[suspenseful music]

1700
01:40:23,362 --> 01:40:24,362
Christina?

1701
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,160
Christina?

1702
01:40:32,267 --> 01:40:33,267
Christina?

1703
01:40:37,859 --> 01:40:38,859
Christina?

1704
01:40:44,797 --> 01:40:46,005
Christina?

1705
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,248
Hush, hush.

1706
01:40:47,282 --> 01:40:48,870
You're okay. You're okay.

1707
01:40:48,904 --> 01:40:49,904
You're okay.

1708
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,805
You must have been
sleep walking,

1709
01:40:52,839 --> 01:40:53,944
it was the Ambien.

1710
01:40:57,534 --> 01:40:58,707
It'll be morning soon.

1711
01:41:01,917 --> 01:41:03,367
You should finish your dream.

1712
01:41:06,715 --> 01:41:09,718
[suspenseful music]

1713
01:41:14,447 --> 01:41:15,447
Hush, hush.

1714
01:41:19,003 --> 01:41:22,145
[speaking in Spanish]

1715
01:42:13,782 --> 01:42:14,782
Oh.

1716
01:42:38,462 --> 01:42:39,462
Look at you.

1717
01:42:41,534 --> 01:42:43,191
Oh my God.

1718
01:42:43,226 --> 01:42:44,813
So beautiful.

1719
01:42:44,848 --> 01:42:46,436
You know, we're working on it.

1720
01:42:50,854 --> 01:42:52,269
I'm sorry I didn't come out.

1721
01:42:52,304 --> 01:42:54,340
I was mad, I didn't
wanna take it out on you.

1722
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:55,514
It's fine.

1723
01:43:01,727 --> 01:43:03,729
So what did you
wanna talk to me about?

1724
01:43:06,007 --> 01:43:08,009
[sighs]

1725
01:43:12,945 --> 01:43:15,430
[light music]

1726
01:43:16,362 --> 01:43:17,674
It's all good.

1727
01:43:44,494 --> 01:43:47,151
I never meant to drive you away.

1728
01:43:50,465 --> 01:43:51,465
I just,

1729
01:43:54,262 --> 01:43:58,577
I'm sorry I haven't
always been there for you.

1730
01:43:58,611 --> 01:44:02,201
[Christina] You're
always with me.

1731
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:03,720
I just love you.

1732
01:44:07,275 --> 01:44:08,587
You're my light.

1733
01:44:13,177 --> 01:44:14,177
Be happy.

1734
01:44:20,495 --> 01:44:23,395
[melancholy music]

1735
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:40,790
Be happy.

1736
01:44:50,387 --> 01:44:52,941
