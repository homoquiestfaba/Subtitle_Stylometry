1
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,747
Damn.

2
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,274
This thing's a mess.

3
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,684
Looks like she blew a gasket.
What do you think?

4
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,346
Yeah, well, I don't know.

5
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,555
You heading into the park?

6
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,057
I was but my car had other plans.

7
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,253
Yeah, looks like you got yourself
a blown head gasket.

8
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,757
How much do you think that will cost?

9
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,390
It's gonna be a couple of hundred dollars.

10
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,697
And I gotta order the part in from Jackson,

11
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,669
so that's gonna take a few days as well.

12
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,434
-A few days?
-Is there a problem with that?

13
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,305
You gotta understand,
Angels Fall is a small town.

14
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,903
Yeah, served by stagecoach delivery,
apparently.

15
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,886
Sorry, I just wasn't expecting to stay.

16
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,820
If you need a motel,
the Mayfield's just down a ways.

17
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,720
Clean, it's got reasonable rates.

18
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,228
Well, reasonable is right in my price range.

19
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,629
-Thanks, Mr...
-Drubber. Mac Drubber. Call me Mac.

20
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,225
Lynt can give you a ride.
He's going right by the Mayfield.

21
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,935
No. You know what?
I've done enough driving.

22
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,737
It's probably better that I walk.

23
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,473
I can drop your bags off
down at the motel for you.

24
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,175
Thanks.

25
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,017
Both of you, thanks. Bye.

26
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,322
-Pretty thing.
-Yeah. No meat on her, though.

27
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,259
Women nowadays, you know,
they just starve off all the curves.

28
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,284
Meatloaf's the special today.

29
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,255
Comes with mashed potatoes,
green beans and a biscuit.

30
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,825
I'll just have tea, thanks.

31
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,054
You looking to make some money?

32
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,494
I saw you staring at the sign.

33
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,726
I'm just passing through.

34
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,268
Are you really looking for a cook?

35
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,770
Old one got fired a couple of days ago.

36
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,567
-Joanie.
-What?

37
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,300
Someone here on the job.

38
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,775
She's the owner.

39
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,244
-I'm Linda-Gail, by the way.
-I'm Reece.

40
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,019
I saw your sign in the window.

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,179
-Reece what?
-Gilmore.

42
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,251
-You cook, Reece Gilmore?
-Yes.

43
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,191
For a living, or just to put
something in your mouth?

44
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,354
Both.

45
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,023
-Where you from?
-Boston.

46
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,431
Long way to come to look for a job.

47
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:06,129
My car broke down,
so I'm kind of stuck here.

48
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,704
How long you been on the road?

49
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,940
Is this relevant?

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,147
A little over a year.

51
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,985
Maybe it's time you got stuck somewhere.

52
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:29,724
Next order, steak sandwich, medium well,
fried onions, mushrooms, fries and slaw.

53
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,560
If Doc doesn't drop dead after eating
what you cook, you got the job.

54
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,793
Come around the back.

55
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,834
Hi.

56
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,195
Order up!

57
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,204
Ruben, club san, two side salads.

58
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,709
Make it quick.

59
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,174
I'll pay you $8 an hour.

60
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,617
We open at 6:30,
so you need to be here at 6:00.

61
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,586
We serve breakfast all day.

62
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,749
Joanie, I'm only staying
until my car is fixed.

63
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:10,260
Well, then what? How far
are you gonna get with no money?

64
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,763
You wouldn't be wanting a job
if you were flush.

65
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,493
Lunch is 11:00 to 3:00. Dinner's 5:00 to 7:00.

66
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,833
Last shift, cook cleans the stove,
the grill and does the lock-down.

67
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,770
I don't pay overtime.

68
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,006
Now, there's an apartment
behind the restaurant.

69
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,673
It ain't much, but if you want it,
I'll deduct the rent from your pay.

70
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,682
I can't close.

71
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,218
I can open. I can work any shift.

72
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,051
I can work doubles, I just...
I can't close. I'm sorry.

73
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,752
-Afraid of the dark?
-Something like that.

74
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,421
Well, fair enough.
What about the apartment?

75
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,363
I'm gonna check into the Mayfield.

76
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,301
Well, you go get yourself settled there.

77
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,530
You always hire strangers?

78
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,405
Well, everyone's a stranger,
one time or another.

79
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,104
Have something to eat, on the house.

80
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,307
-You need your room done?
-No, thanks.

81
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,112
Busier than usual for a Saturday afternoon.

82
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,912
Everyone's here to check out the new cook.

83
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,655
Mac.

84
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,416
Doc.

85
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,925
Even the sheriff's taking a look.

86
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,686
Some of us have a bet going.

87
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,197
Pete thinks you're on the run from the law.

88
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,291
Mac thinks there's an abusive husband.

89
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:00,270
Me? I think you
got your heart broke back East.

90
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,934
-Any of us hit?
-Nope, sorry.

91
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,035
Just at loose ends, traveling.

92
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,613
Something in there.

93
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,378
To my eye, you got heartbreak
written all over you.

94
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,384
Speaking of heartbreakers.

95
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,795
His name's Brody.
Comes in three times a week. Tips 20% .

96
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,370
-He's a writer.
-What kind?

97
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,271
Folks say he worked for a paper
in Chicago as a reporter but got fired.

98
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,707
Now he writes mystery books.

99
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,074
Where did you learn to cook like that,
young lady?

100
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,014
The Culinary Institute in Vermont.
And a year in Paris.

101
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,245
-It's Reece.
-I'll be back for breakfast.

102
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,547
Thanks, Doc.

103
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,554
-See you, Doc.
-See you, Doc.

104
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,881
Thank you.

105
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,599
Hey, there. You must be the new girl.

106
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,963
You're in my way.

107
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,128
Feisty new girl.

108
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,761
-Reece.
-Reece.

109
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,534
Girl with a guy's name. I like that.

110
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,408
William Butler.
Works out at the Circle K Ranch.

111
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,781
He goes by Lo, short for "Lothario,"

112
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,253
which he got labeled with
when he was a teenager

113
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,760
and proceeded in making it his life's work
to bed every female within 100 miles.

114
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,262
-And you're telling me this because...
-Well, he's come here to have a look at you.

115
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,993
I can't imagine
there's much to see right now.

116
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,833
You're young, female, as far as it goes,
unattached. That's all it takes.

117
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,339
Well, don't worry. I'm not looking for a man,
temporarily or permanently,

118
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,845
and especially one
who uses his prick as a compass.

119
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,743
-William.
-Ma.

120
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,352
-Hey, Brody.
-Hey, Mac.

121
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,789
-What do you think of Joanie's new cook?
-The food's good.

122
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,957
Not what I meant.

123
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,594
Car broke down, she's putting up at motel.
Pays cash by the day.

124
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,333
No credit cards could mean
she doesn't want to leave a trail.

125
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,107
10 bucks, he sweet-talks her
and beds her within a week.

126
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,817
I'll take your bet, just so it costs you.

127
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,527
Heading home?

128
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,994
-You're kind of jumpy.
-No. Yeah, I didn't see you.

129
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,035
Mind if I walk with you?

130
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,467
I'm fine.

131
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,233
We could go grab a beer.
You could tell me your life story.

132
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,575
My life story isn't worth the price of a drink.

133
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,546
You're a tough sell.

134
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,052
Maybe we'll do it some other time. Yeah?

135
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,485
That would be great.

136
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,081
-I'll hold you to that.
-Okay, thanks for the offer.

137
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,488
You're welcome.

138
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,926
Got to go.

139
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,634
Lo keep you up last night?

140
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,534
He's got a reputation for endurance.

141
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,665
I wouldn't know.
He just walked me to the corner.

142
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,609
-What's this, a coffee klatch?
-Reece didn't sleep with Lo.

143
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,477
No offense, but is this
some sort of secret town tradition?

144
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,915
I mean, if being a slut is part of the job,

145
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,818
I'd better be making much more
than 8 bucks an hour.

146
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,990
The slut clause is voluntary.

147
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,493
He's very cute, but nothing happened.

148
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,461
Well, that's a first.

149
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:33,227
-Is she upset with me?
-No, she's upset with the whole situation.

150
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,637
She's loved Lo ever since they were kids
and he loves her, too.

151
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,767
But his way of dealing with it
is to dick around

152
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,210
so he doesn't have to think about her.

153
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:45,807
I wish they'd quit circling around,
just get down to giving me some grandkids.

154
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:50,355
Lynt called about your car.
The part he needed is on back-order.

155
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,548
Great.

156
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,022
I'm guessing from your
overwhelming response

157
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,686
that you might be a few dollars short.

158
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,093
How about a two-week cash advance?

159
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,597
-Well, that's very generous.
-Generous, hell.

160
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,567
It's my way of making you stick,
at least awhile.

161
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,773
Well, if I stay,
the motel isn't working for me.

162
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,070
You want the apartment?

163
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,371
-Let's go look.
-Okay.

164
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,447
It's right around back.

165
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,083
Here it is.

166
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,856
It could use some tidying.

167
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,693
And it could use some paint.

168
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,699
It's got decent light.

169
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
And the rent's due on the first of the month.

170
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,102
I'd rather pay by the week.

171
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,473
-Doesn't matter to me.
-Thank you, for everything.

172
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,443
No need for gratitude.

173
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,241
Let me get this said.

174
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:54,581
I don't like depending on anyone,
but you're the best cook I've ever had.

175
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,416
And I figure on making use of that.

176
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,514
Especially if you don't go
rabbiting off on me some night

177
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,616
and leave me flat.

178
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,287
Now, I'm gonna ask you straight out.

179
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,094
-You got the law after you?
-No.

180
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,294
I didn't think so.

181
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,997
People around here get to speculating.

182
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,338
Open it.

183
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,477
Oh! It's beautiful.

184
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,014
You know, a long time ago I made a mistake.

185
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,991
I married a man who wasn't good for much
but being handsome.

186
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:40,189
He was damn good-looking,
but he wasn't good for me and our boy.

187
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,335
And once I was gone,
he never came looking.

188
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,602
No one will come looking for me.

189
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,833
That's all I need to know.

190
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,273
You got the key.

191
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,278
I won't leave you flat.

192
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,178
And if I need to go,
I will tell you beforehand.

193
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,510
Fair enough.

194
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,343
I'll be right down.

195
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,664
-I'll get you a box.
-Oh, that's okay.

196
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,572
Just take a second.

197
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,496
Mac?

198
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,674
Mr. Drubber?

199
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,847
Oh! Thanks.

200
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,254
I can open you an account.

201
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,452
Joanie gave me an advance.

202
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:24,025
You know, I don't need the camera,
but I will take a map.

203
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,802
Housewarming gift.

204
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,373
-Be right with you, Brody.
-Thank you.

205
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,069
Reece is moving into the apartment
behind Joanie's.

206
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,542
For now.

207
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,742
Why don't you help her haul this stuff
back over there?

208
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,493
-He sort of put you on the spot.
-Yeah, he did.

209
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,733
Well, you really are a city girl.

210
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:10,008
That was just a truck backfiring.
You should be here during hunting season.

211
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,673
Sorry.

212
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,810
And that completes the
entertainment portion of this program.

213
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,322
-I'm Reece, by the way.
-I know.

214
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,652
I'm Brody.

215
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,188
I thank you for not asking any questions.

216
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,995
-Would you have answered?
-No.

217
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,198
You're staring.

218
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,904
Glancing.

219
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,238
Connected glances equals a stare.

220
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,682
Oh, I'm sorry. Professional pitfall.
Writers observe.

221
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,152
That was very rude of me.

222
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,415
That's okay.

223
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,117
You can dedicate your next book to me.

224
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,093
Who decides what's rude, anyway?

225
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,355
PRS.

226
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,160
The Prevention of Rudeness Society.

227
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,633
Didn't they disband?

228
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,763
No. They continue their good work
in secret locations across the country.

229
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,670
-So, what do you write?
-Mysteries.

230
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,876
-Are you writing one now?
-Researching right now.

231
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,010
I'm trying to find the perfect spot
for a murder.

232
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,179
I'm thinking high up in the park.

233
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,349
Nobody's on the trail
this early in the spring.

234
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:32,294
He gets her, he pushes her
and she falls a long, long way.

235
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,296
Don't kill the woman.

236
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,095
I'm just trying to steer you away
from the obvious cliché.

237
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,760
Everybody thinks they're a writer.

238
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,403
Oh. Thanks. Just put that there.

239
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,816
Well, if you want me to leave, just ask.

240
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,582
Would you? Leave?

241
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,316
Can I use your bathroom?

242
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,419
Sure.

243
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,890
No, it can wait.
What's the special at Joanie's tonight?

244
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,764
Probably something fried with potatoes.

245
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,968
Oh, forgot my milk.

246
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,109
I'll catch you later.

247
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,237
-Hey, Doc.
-Hey, Brody.

248
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,475
Hey.

249
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,089
Here's that $10 I owe you.

250
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,107
-God! Oh, God!
-Reece, are you okay?

251
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,881
He killed her. He killed her. I saw it.

252
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,146
-I saw it. She's dead.
-What? Who's dead?

253
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,848
I saw it. I wasn't dreaming.
It wasn't Ginny at the river.

254
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,187
-Who's Ginny?
-No, the other woman.

255
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,089
I saw him kill her.

256
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,420
Look, I can't understand you.
What happened?

257
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,366
Take a deep breath.

258
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,233
I saw a hawk. I saw a hawk.
I had the binoculars.

259
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,364
I was looking around
and there was this couple,

260
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:12,932
and they were fighting,
and he knocked her down.

261
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,813
-I've got to get out of here.
-Finish telling me.

262
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,222
-I saw him strangle her.
-Take me there.

263
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,414
No.

264
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,151
-She could still be alive.
-No, she's dead.

265
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,921
There's nothing we can do for her now.

266
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,755
I'll call the sheriff from my cabin.
It's right down the hill.

267
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,437
I couldn't really see him.
He had on sunglasses and a baseball cap.

268
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,409
-It was orange like a hunter's hat.
-Okay.

269
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,103
And his back was to me.

270
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,808
She had black or brown...

271
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,077
I think it was brown.
It was brown, straight hair.

272
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,586
You said "Ginny."

273
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,919
Did she look like Ginny? A friend of yours?

274
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,653
No. No, there's no Ginny.

275
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,690
Okay. What about the man?

276
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,165
-Was he white?
-Yes.

277
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,964
What about his hair?

278
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,632
Like I said, it was under a hat.
I couldn't really tell.

279
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,333
What about you, Brody? You see anything?

280
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,570
No, I was coming down the mountain.

281
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:24,148
I saw her running,
but I didn't see anything else.

282
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,248
Excuse me.

283
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,753
Yeah. Yeah, I'm leaving right now.

284
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,749
Sorry, I gotta get down there.

285
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,761
-Did they find anything?
-No. Nothing yet.

286
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,889
Show me again on this map where you were.

287
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,161
Here.

288
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,532
-Right there?
-Yeah.

289
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,471
Well, that's a pretty good distance
from where you were and the couple.

290
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,166
No, that's... But that's the place.

291
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,938
All right. I'll let my deputies know.

292
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,979
I understand your car is in for repair.

293
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,844
Yeah, it'll be done soon.

294
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,440
Well, I'm gonna need you
to stick around town for a little while.

295
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,543
Hopefully no more than a few days.

296
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:06,590
You think of anything,
anything at all, you let me know.

297
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,216
Don't worry about this, Reece.
We're gonna get this sorted out.

298
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,692
Thank you.

299
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,963
I was on the Old Ridge trail
about 100 yards from there

300
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,535
when I ran into her.

301
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,332
Okay, I'll call you later.

302
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,378
Jeez.

303
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,386
And they say deer are harmless.

304
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,487
Come on, I'll take you home.

305
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,892
-You wrote this.
-Yeah. Keep it.

306
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,487
You know, I can walk.

307
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,566
Sorry, I've put you to a lot of trouble.

308
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,228
You're damn right. Now get in.

309
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,669
Can you be any more rude or insensitive?

310
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,034
A woman was murdered today.

311
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,938
You know, strangled to death?
Do you get it?

312
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,908
Instead of being outraged or sympathetic

313
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,674
or anything even remotely human,
you're snippy.

314
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,683
Acting like it doesn't matter.
Well, it matters. She matters.

315
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,515
Go to hell.

316
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,523
I was wondering if you had anything
approaching a normal temper in there?

317
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,823
And, FYI, guys are incapable of snippiness.

318
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,159
Next time, use "callous." That works.

319
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,962
-You're an irritating and confusing man.
-That works, too.

320
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,749
Aren't reporters
supposed to be sort of personable?

321
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,419
You know, to get information out of people?

322
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,998
-You'll note, I'm not a reporter anymore.
-Oh.

323
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,068
I'm a snippy novelist.

324
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,368
Teeth. I knew you had them, I just...
I've never seen them.

325
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,806
You know, are you hungry?
'Cause I can make something.

326
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,041
-No. It's getting late.
-It won't take long.

327
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,549
Another time.

328
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,180
I don't want to be alone.

329
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,591
I don't know if anyone's ever told you this,
but you can cook.

330
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,026
I heard a rumor.

331
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,655
-Where did you learn?
-Paris.

332
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,030
But you already know that
'cause Doc Wallace told you.

333
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,968
Actually, it was Mac who told Doc.

334
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,301
You haven't picked up
the small town rhythm yet, have you?

335
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,406
Well, you don't talk about yourself
very much.

336
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,071
I haven't noticed
you ponying up any information.

337
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,875
What do you want to know?

338
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,644
-Have you ever been married?
-Almost. No.

339
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,654
Why almost?

340
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,783
'Cause I was too committed to my job.

341
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,590
And she left me for a commodities broker.

342
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,631
-And you?
-No.

343
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,297
Why not?

344
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,996
Just too committed to my job. Period.

345
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,198
Have you ever thought about
opening your own restaurant?

346
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,438
Oh, yeah, a long time ago,
but I'm happy just cooking now.

347
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:21,485
But I would be happier if I could get
Joanie to get better ingredients.

348
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,713
You know, everyone at Joanie's
is talking about us right now.

349
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,688
Yeah, they saw my car parked out front.

350
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,249
What was a convenient parking job
has now turned into a raging affair.

351
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:34,661
Seems to be an intramural sport
around here, speculating on people.

352
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,131
Like you betting Mac

353
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,932
that Lo would be sleeping with me
within a week?

354
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,270
-Maybe you are getting the rhythm.
-Maybe.

355
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,606
-Hey.
-Rick.

356
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,475
-Brody.
-Did you find her?

357
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,277
-We didn't find anything.
-What do you mean?

358
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,317
No body. Nothing.

359
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,287
Well, maybe he threw her in the river
or buried her.

360
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:02,951
Well, we're gonna look into that,
but there also wasn't a sign of any struggle.

361
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,320
I don't understand.

362
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,830
Look, it was dark out there,
I'm gonna go back in the morning.

363
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,661
Meanwhile, I'm gonna go to the station,
make some calls,

364
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,600
see if there's any female tourists
or residents missing.

365
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,468
You know, Joanie's cabins are up there.
Maybe you should check there.

366
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,542
Well, if someone was there,
it'd be easy enough to tell.

367
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,804
Look, I don't want you
worrying about this, Reece.

368
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,881
-Tonight there's nothing more you can do.
-Okay.

369
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,210
-Thanks, Rick.
-Thank you.

370
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,681
-Enjoy your dinner.
-Thanks.

371
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:27,944
Thanks.

372
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,986
He might have been at the wrong location.
He said it was getting dark.

373
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,321
Look, if you want to go back,
we'll go back tomorrow...

374
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,859
-Really?
-Yeah, but if you don't want to...

375
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,692
No, no, I want to.
I must have been off in my direction.

376
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,029
-We'll figure this out. Okay?
-Okay.

377
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,532
See you.

378
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,912
Hey, Brody.
I didn't know you two were dating.

379
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,652
Well, dinner's a loose interpretation
of dating.

380
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,486
Look, someone new comes to town,
I gotta make sure they're clean.

381
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,785
Right.

382
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,131
There's something I need
to tell you about Reece.

383
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,732
<i>It's not pretty.</i>

384
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,165
A couple of years ago
she was working at a restaurant

385
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,635
that got shot up in a spree killing.

386
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,575
<i>She's the only survivor.</i>

387
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,303
Jesus.

388
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,612
<i>Lead investigator said he stayed</i>
<i>in contact with her for almost a year,</i>

389
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,520
but then she disappeared.

390
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,461
Obviously, it's something
she doesn't want people to know about.

391
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,263
When people go through
a trauma like that they...

392
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,462
Hallucinate?

393
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:57,371
Well, no, but they react in ways
we can't understand.

394
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,874
So you think she's lying about the murder?

395
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,884
No. No, absolutely not.
But I'm gonna need some evidence.

396
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,384
A body, something.

397
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,618
Meanwhile, all I can do
is keep checking with missing persons,

398
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,686
<i>see if anyone turns up</i>
<i>matching the description Reece gave me.</i>

399
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,731
Look, I gotta go.
Deb's gonna have my head.

400
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,803
I'm already late for dinner. I just...

401
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:29,498
-I just wanted you to know. That's all.
-Thanks.

402
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,046
I can't be doing this again.

403
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,465
-Morning.
-Morning.

404
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,131
-Hey.
-Morning.

405
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,480
-Lo told us.
-Told you what?

406
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,742
Rick was out at the guest ranch,
where Lo works,

407
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,784
asking about any missing guests.

408
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,546
He told Lo about the murder you saw.

409
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,144
All your friends killed like that.

410
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,121
Wait. What did Rick tell Lo?

411
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:31,719
Rick told him about the murder
you saw by the river.

412
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,128
-And the ones before, in Boston.
-No wonder you ran away.

413
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,666
-Nice job, Linda-Gail.
-Why? What did I say?

414
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,798
So, who knows?

415
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:12,232
Now, how I'd approach that question is,
who doesn't know?

416
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,739
-So I guess, then, they also know that...
-Rick didn't find a body yet.

417
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,537
Doesn't mean he won't.

418
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:25,446
I think what's got most people concerned,
me included, is how you're doing.

419
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,149
I wish you'd told me about Boston.

420
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,552
-It's not something I like to talk about.
-Fair enough.

421
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,489
You leaving town now?

422
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,254
I'm a stubborn bitch most of the time,

423
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:46,462
but I know damn well what it's like
to pick up and leave a bad situation.

424
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,663
It takes time to find a place of your own.

425
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,105
How did you know Angels Fall was yours?

426
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,801
I didn't.

427
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:56,072
It was just someplace
better than where I'd been.

428
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,412
And then one morning I woke up
and it was mine.

429
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,078
That's when I stopped looking behind.

430
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,314
You need some time?

431
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,025
Brody was gonna take me back to the river.

432
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:14,154
Take the whole day. We'll manage.

433
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,662
<i>It's a good place to die.</i>

434
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,436
No place is.

435
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,601
The sheriff was right.
There's no sign of a struggle.

436
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,474
Tell me what happened.

437
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,111
-She was standing here...
-No.

438
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,708
Back in Boston.

439
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,718
That night there was supposed to be
a surprise going-away party.

440
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,663
I was starting a new job as head chef
at a new restaurant.

441
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:54,033
I mean, I had no personal life,
just the people at Maneo's.

442
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,071
And that was my family.

443
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,437
So when I came through the back door,

444
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,876
<i>I knew something was wrong,</i>
<i>horribly wrong.</i>

445
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,420
Oh my God!

446
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,855
No!

447
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,223
<i>He shot me. Twice.</i>

448
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,960
<i>Then he shot my best friend, Ginny.</i>

449
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,762
<i>And I did nothing.</i>

450
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,940
<i>I watched her die. And then I waited to die.</i>

451
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,471
You know, there's nothing
you could have done.

452
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,285
Rick told you all this
because he didn't believe me.

453
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,688
-I'm gonna go talk to him.
-I'm gonna go with you.

454
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,555
No. Thanks.

455
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,769
Morning.

456
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,870
I wondered if you had any news.

457
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,005
Well, on the good news front,
everyone in Angels Fall is accounted for,

458
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,846
as are the visitors,
and there's been no missing persons

459
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,113
matching the description
of the woman you described.

460
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,746
No one knows she's missing yet.
It's only been a day.

461
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,256
Well, I'm gonna keep checking.

462
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,452
You think I'm imagining this.

463
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,121
I think you've had a couple of bad years.

464
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,460
It has no bearing on this.

465
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,761
Well, you look good enough
to eat there, yourself, Slim.

466
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,245
<i>What if what you saw</i>
<i>triggered something in you?</i>

467
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,719
Something that made you
project the past into the present.

468
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,552
-Like what?
-Something that scared and upset you.

469
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,683
Like maybe an argument.

470
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,660
Maybe that woman by the river,
she just simply walked away

471
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,129
as you went running down the trail.

472
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,290
No.

473
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,836
-Rick?
-Hey, baby. Nice surprise.

474
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,305
This is my wife, Debbie.
Absolute sunshine of my life.

475
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,570
Debbie, this is Reece Gilmore.

476
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,736
It's nice to meet you, Reece.

477
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,974
You know, I am so sorry
to hear about your trouble.

478
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,415
I know what I saw, Sheriff.

479
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,349
That woman was dead.

480
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,434
Reece, come on in.

481
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,704
Hey, hey. What did Rick say?

482
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,406
Nothing.

483
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:57,048
Listen, let him do his job.
Don't be depressed.

484
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,588
Come on, I wanna
show you something. Outside.

485
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,248
You know, I thought
I would just pass through,

486
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,122
pick up a little work, move on.

487
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,626
And now I'm stuck.

488
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,163
No. If you want to go, go.

489
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,062
Here, take my car.

490
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,603
I can always buy another one.
Seriously, you want to go, go.

491
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,269
You worried about the murder?

492
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,533
Just hire yourself a lawyer,

493
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,269
give a detailed deposition,
come back for the trial.

494
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:24,404
Seriously, don't let anyone hold you back
from your continued suffering.

495
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,845
You know, sooner or later,
you got to land somewhere.

496
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,944
This is as good a place as any.

497
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,322
You know, I'd just like to
make it through the day.

498
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,019
You know, when you're cooking,
you're happy.

499
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,327
What else is going to make you happy?

500
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,202
-Brody.
-Yeah?

501
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,841
My mind hasn't been focused
in this area in a long time.

502
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,073
What area is that?

503
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,377
I think we both know the neighborhood,
you know,

504
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,782
being intimate in terms of physical contact.

505
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,986
Well, why don't you say
you haven't been laid in a while?

506
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,522
Obviously, I don't have
your elegance with words.

507
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,159
Right. No sex. How about food?

508
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,334
Why don't you cook me dinner tonight?

509
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:27,700
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I have issues, lots of them.

510
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,838
You don't want to get involved.

511
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,677
It's just dinner, that's all.

512
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:38,380
Make some small talk.
We'll tell some lies, have some laughs.

513
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,517
You know, not everything's life and death.

514
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,252
Sometimes there's just fun.

515
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,607
Lose something?

516
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,921
Your door was open. You okay?

517
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,959
Yeah. I mean, I'm just in a hurry.
I'm going to Brody's for dinner.

518
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,618
-Brody?
-Yeah.

519
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:55,358
Well, I guess you don't want to get a beer
with me and Lo, then.

520
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,592
He's making nice with me.

521
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:02,195
Of course, all things considered, it seems
like Brody's making real nice with you.

522
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,471
It's just dinner, you know, meal,

523
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,377
small talk, and laughs, lies.

524
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,148
-Well, have fun, darling.
-You, too.

525
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,161
-So, where did you get these?
-I made them, idiot.

526
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,891
-Like, from flour?
-From flour.

527
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:34,436
Well, these are a lot better than you get
from the kind that pop out of a can.

528
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,371
Okay, let me guess what's in your kitchen.

529
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,306
Frozen pizza, beer, for sure.

530
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:45,075
A couple of cans of chili, hot dogs
and, oh, Hungry-Man dinners.

531
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,809
You forgot the mac and cheese.

532
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,010
Okay.

533
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,852
You know, it's been a long time
since I've had candles at a dinner,

534
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:58,656
or a tablecloth,
or a beautiful woman to share it with.

535
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,527
Everyone's beautiful in candlelight.

536
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,328
What, am I not allowed
to pay you a compliment?

537
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,337
Oh, well, didn't you know
that lack of confidence is the new black?

538
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,770
But thank you.

539
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:11,898
Were you always this difficult?

540
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:16,603
"Were"? Like, as in past tense,
as in before...

541
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:20,877
No, no, no, like "were,"
as in "difficult," as in before the shooting?

542
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,145
Yeah, something like that
has got to change someone.

543
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,689
It's got to affect you in ways
that no one can understand.

544
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,226
-So you know about the other thing.
-Yeah.

545
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,955
-And Rick told you?
-No, Rick didn't tell me.

546
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,561
-I did some research.
-Wait a minute...

547
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,224
I looked online.

548
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,235
You went to whatever extent
to find this out?

549
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,033
What do you want know specifically?

550
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,438
Like how long I was in the nuthouse?

551
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,943
Or what it's actually like
to get electroshock therapy?

552
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,808
They still do it.

553
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,547
Look, I didn't mean anything by that.

554
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,554
But, Reece, talk to me.

555
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,959
-You say that, but you don't really mean it.
-Oh, you're right. I'm lying.

556
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,087
I'm only interested in the sex.

557
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,429
Oh, wait a minute. That's right.
We're not having sex.

558
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,931
Come on, Reece.
You need somebody to talk to.

559
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,166
I'm right here. Talk to me.

560
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,743
After the shootings,
I went to live with my aunt.

561
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:34,686
I tried to grasp onto something,
you know, work, religion.

562
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:39,955
And every time I reached out,
I ended up empty-handed.

563
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:46,002
You know, then there was the flashbacks
and the night terrors and the sleepwalking.

564
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,900
I do things that I don't know.

565
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,097
Then I was at...

566
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,912
I was in the MacClean Psychiatric Hospital
for six months.

567
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,481
Right.

568
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,049
Then after that, I just...
I had to get out of there.

569
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,985
I didn't want to be blank anymore.
I didn't want to take the pills.

570
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,285
So, I still have them, you know, just in case.

571
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,451
Souvenirs from the edge.

572
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:15,259
So now you're just neurotic and anal?

573
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,199
Oh, yeah, and claustrophobic,

574
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,702
obsessive-compulsive
and a little bit paranoid.

575
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,467
Strangely, it's kind of a turn-on.

576
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:30,179
-You're not gonna tell Rick?
-No, I'm not gonna tell Rick.

577
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,612
But I'm sure he's gonna find out on his own.

578
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:36,482
If he didn't believe me before,
he's never gonna believe me now.

579
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:40,387
Did you know Doc was a good artist?
I mean, good is overstating.

580
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:44,153
But if you give a description
of the woman that was murdered,

581
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,229
I bet he can make a sketch of it.

582
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,991
Why are you doing this?

583
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:52,628
-Why are you getting so involved?
-It's a mystery.

584
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,637
-I'm good at mysteries.
-You really do believe me.

585
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,073
Yeah, I do.

586
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,677
We're in this together, Slim.

587
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,699
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

588
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,366
Well, somebody's in a good mood
this morning.

589
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:06,908
Yes, I am.

590
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,537
And since I'm in such a good mood,
I think it's time we have that little talk.

591
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,548
-What talk?
-The talk about fresh herbs.

592
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:18,986
Joanie, this is not basil.
This is a desiccated memory of basil.

593
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,886
-We need to use fresh herbs.
-"We"?

594
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,220
You.

595
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,086
Oh, man!

596
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,964
A glass busted in the water.

597
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,426
Well, don't be bleeding
all over my kitchen floor.

598
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,504
Like I have a choice.

599
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,520
Where's... Where's Pete?

600
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,595
-How many fingers?
-Two.

601
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,631
Getting a couple of stitches.

602
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,295
Oh, you got a nice egg
on the back of your head.

603
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,871
I'm fine. Just let me stand up.

604
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,099
-Only if you go home and rest.
-No, I'm fine.

605
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,142
-No.
-I'm fine.

606
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,609
Go, now. Slow.

607
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:16,872
Okay.

608
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,531
Not again.

609
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,047
Tell me I didn't do this.

610
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,406
The lips are a little fuller.

611
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,451
The chin is a little pointier
and her eyes aren't so round.

612
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,350
They're a little longer.

613
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,980
Is this the woman you saw murdered?

614
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,155
-That's good.
-Doesn't look like anyone I know.

615
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,089
I'll make copies of this,
then we'll pass it out.

616
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,104
I like that you wear bowties.

617
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:52,533
That's Susan's doing, my wife.

618
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:57,375
She thought it made me look more the part,
you know, small town doctor-like.

619
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,005
I hate them.

620
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,608
But I figured she might haunt me
if I change things.

621
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:08,047
The fact is, after a long day,
I still talk things over with her.

622
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:12,458
Some people might think that's crazy.
I think it's just human.

623
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,121
I appreciate you trying to put me at ease.

624
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,034
Just making conversation.

625
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,298
I was in a psychiatric hospital
for six months.

626
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:27,035
-Oh?
-I was just trying to make conversation.

627
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,547
You look tired.
Do you need something to help you sleep?

628
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:40,246
Is that why I'm really here?
Brody thinks I need drugs?

629
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:43,656
-I don't know what Brody thinks.
-I won't do drugs.

630
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,886
I won't go back there.

631
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,727
-I'd rather deal with my anxiety.
-Are you? Anxious?

632
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,826
To the point that I want to leave town,
every day, yeah, but I don't.

633
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,171
I'm just scared.

634
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,273
It's all happening again.

635
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,639
What is?

636
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,911
Lost time. Doing things I don't remember.

637
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:11,818
Like, last night, I packed up everything,
but I didn't go anywhere.

638
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:16,619
I'm sure that's a big minus
on my mental health chart,

639
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,627
but I offset it with a plus, by unpacking.

640
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:25,297
What you're describing
sounds like classic post-traumatic stress.

641
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,232
People who witness life-threatening events

642
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:32,331
can relive the experience
through nightmares and flashbacks.

643
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,840
Didn't run yesterday. Didn't run today.

644
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,380
That's big for me.

645
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,507
-Good girl.
-Yeah.

646
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,189
So, I have something to tell you.
I started your book.

647
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:58,896
I like it. I mean, I like Jack, the screw-up.

648
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,401
And I hope he doesn't end up dead,
you know,

649
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,769
'cause I'm really rooting for him
and Leah to end up together.

650
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,171
It's great.

651
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,514
<i>It was orange. Like a hunter's cap.</i>

652
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,645
Hey.

653
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,723
-What's your problem?
-Where did you get that cap?

654
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,325
They give them away at the guest ranch
during hunting season.

655
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,833
Everybody's got one. Come on.

656
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,525
Is he a good kisser?

657
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:02,824
I'm not telling.

658
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,027
-Yes.
-I knew it. I knew it.

659
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,498
-Oh, hey, when's your next day off?
-Wednesday.

660
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:15,066
Then Wednesday, we're going to Jackson.
I know a great salon.

661
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:18,772
And, honey, no offense,
but you could use some work.

662
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,712
Come on, it'll be fun.

663
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,589
Yeah, you know what? I'll think about it.
I'll be right back.

664
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:35,563
-Linda-Gail. How's it going?
-Good.

665
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,859
Yeah.

666
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:40,231
I got a cancellation tomorrow
out at the ranch.

667
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,704
And I just... I thought maybe
I could saddle up a couple of horses

668
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:47,607
and we could check out the backcountry,
if you're not busy.

669
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,943
Yeah, if it's nice.

670
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,878
-lf it's nice, yeah.
-Yeah.

671
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,075
Okay, I'll see you.

672
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,581
What?

673
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,454
Reece, we know
about the psychiatric hospital.

674
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:06,656
You're gonna fire me?

675
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,163
Well, if you keep cooking
the way you've been cooking,

676
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:12,029
I don't care if you come to work
wearing only an aluminum foil hat

677
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,762
and singing show tunes.

678
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,930
-You're not on any drugs, are you?
-No. I...

679
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,870
So now you have
a real reason not to believe me.

680
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,505
It's not about what I believe. It's about facts.

681
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:30,245
-The facts are I don't have a body.
-Or the crazy woman made it up.

682
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,787
-Reece, just...
-Wait, look.

683
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,119
-What?
-Doc drew this.

684
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,621
It's the woman I saw killed.
I am not imagining things.

685
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,359
-What do you want me to do with this?
-Show it around.

686
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:48,369
Reece, nothing against Doc's artistic talent,
but this is rough.

687
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:51,872
Without more detail, you're going to find
loads of people think they recognize her.

688
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,499
It's something.

689
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,140
Yeah, it is.

690
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,048
All right, I'll get it out.
See what comes back.

691
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,377
That's all I'm asking.

692
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,148
-Hey.
-Hey.

693
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,548
What are you doing here?

694
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,225
You're crushing my berries.

695
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:45,881
Oh, God.

696
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,549
Oh, it won't come off. Come on.

697
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:56,428
-It won't come off. It's not coming off.
-Reece. Reece.

698
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,228
-It's happening all over again.
-What is?

699
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:03,629
This! Doing things I don't remember,
like food in the closet! Packing!

700
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,571
-Reece, when did this start happening?
-After the murder.

701
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:09,668
It started happening right after the murder.
Just like after the shootings.

702
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,577
-I need... I need to get back to the hospital.
-You just need to calm down.

703
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:15,378
No! No! No! This is what crazy people do!

704
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,215
You're not crazy. You're not.

705
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,423
-You didn't do this.
-Yeah, then who did?

706
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:25,494
Someone who wants you
to think you're crazy.

707
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,974
-What is this?
-Scotch. Drink it.

708
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,303
Oh.

709
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,143
Okay, who would want to
make me think I'm crazy?

710
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,411
And why would someone
want to do that to me?

711
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,182
You ever seen the movie <i>Gaslight?</i>

712
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,814
Oh, this is why I'm attracted to you.

713
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,757
I'm regressing to a fugue state,
writing all over my apartment,

714
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,421
and you mention a 50-year-old movie?

715
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,464
Is that a yes?

716
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:08,364
Charles Boyer tries to drive his wife
Ingrid Bergman crazy.

717
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,703
Does that sound familiar?

718
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:12,500
But why?

719
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:16,544
Who would be the most invested person
in wanting you to seem crazy?

720
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:20,638
Who would want the whole town
not to believe a word that you say?

721
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,115
I don't know.

722
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,385
-How about the killer?
-Come on.

723
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,285
A crime of passion
is committed in the wilderness

724
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,258
where no one's supposed to see it,
but there's a witness.

725
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,829
Then all the way across town
the gossip starts.

726
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,388
The witness has a history
of psychological problems

727
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,127
caused from a previous violent crime.

728
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:43,103
But, damn, if she isn't plucky.
She insists she saw something.

729
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,174
So if you're the killer,

730
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,300
you got to make it seem as though
she's lying

731
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:50,576
or nuts.

732
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,739
Why not just kill me?

733
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:57,341
'Cause if you end up dead,
then everyone's got to take you serious.

734
01:00:57,453 --> 01:01:01,150
It's better to push you into insanity,
have everyone doubting you.

735
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:06,592
-You actually make it seem plausible.
-But wait, there's more.

736
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:10,757
The map, the shoes in the refrigerator,
the things on the wall,

737
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,334
no one else was supposed to see them.

738
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,863
They were intended for you
and for you alone.

739
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:19,635
You know I think it's easier
to believe that I'm relapsing

740
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:23,337
than to try and swallow
your mystery writer plot.

741
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,380
You don't make anything easy.

742
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,882
That's an odd thing to say to a woman
who's been trying to survive.

743
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,855
A woman who survived
after all her friends were killed.

744
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,118
She was left in the dark, bleeding to death.

745
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,423
Everything was taken from you
for no rhyme or reason.

746
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:43,088
It's a miracle you have any shred of sanity.

747
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,393
So stop feeling sorry for yourself.

748
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:48,034
Start fighting back.

749
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,700
I don't know how.

750
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,508
You're one of the strongest people
I've ever met.

751
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,072
Thank you.

752
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,949
Brody painting your apartment?

753
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:39,177
-How do you know these things?
-Well, Mac came in for a cup of coffee.

754
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,519
Said he saw Brody filling up for gas
on his way to get paint.

755
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,650
Now, Brody's car is out front.

756
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:47,558
Okay. He's doing me a favor.

757
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:50,359
Don't recall Brody doing the same
for any other woman.

758
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:53,731
-You recall him doing the same, Pete?
-Can't say I do.

759
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:56,327
-Fine. We've slept together.
-Sweet.

760
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:01,006
I don't recall Brody painting
for any other woman he slept with.

761
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,476
Maybe 'cause I'm better in bed.

762
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:07,946
You ever paint a girl's apartment?

763
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,281
No, but I did move
a really big refrigerator once.

764
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,854
Oh, yeah.

765
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,923
For that married gal.

766
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,759
Like I didn't know.

767
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,990
Yeah, well, maybe Ma didn't.

768
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,589
Lo, honey, there ain't nothing I can say
that she hasn't already known

769
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,532
or thought about you.

770
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:31,301
So you had an affair with a married woman?

771
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:35,503
-It was all so mysterious.
-Shut up, Linda-Gail.

772
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,840
A month ago, he disappeared for days.

773
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,972
Then as fast as it started,
I heard it was over.

774
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:44,177
No name, no details whatsoever.

775
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,551
Except someone saw them riding horses
across the river once.

776
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,157
Brown-haired girl.

777
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:54,192
-What you laughing at, Pete? Huh?
-Nothing.

778
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,824
-It was a mistake, Linda-Gail.
-The affair, or getting caught?

779
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,804
So, what happened to the woman?

780
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,667
Guess she got saddle sore.

781
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,567
Something like that.

782
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,204
-Hey.
-Hey.

783
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:45,371
Wow. It's... It's blue.

784
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:49,577
-You're a regular Van Gogh.
-Well, it isn't blue actually.

785
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:55,351
It's azure. It's the color of the Caribbean.
It's soothing. It's warm.

786
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:59,519
-It's calming.
-You're a very odd man.

787
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,864
But thank you. That was sweet.

788
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,033
I'll meet you back at your place.

789
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:08,394
Where are you going?

790
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,134
If someone's trying to do this to me,

791
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,073
he's not gonna be stopped until he's found,
and she's the key to getting him.

792
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:17,612
-So you're gonna put those up?
-No, I'm getting a facial.

793
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:29,480
So, does everyone in town know
I've been in a psychiatric hospital?

794
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,923
Pretty much.

795
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:34,527
And now they think
I'm imagining seeing someone killed.

796
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,257
Not everyone.

797
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,858
Hey, did I tell you?
Me and Lo are getting married.

798
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:43,461
Course he don't know it yet,
but I'm real good at projects.

799
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,971
-Oh, you have amazing skin.
-Thank you.

800
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,773
-Hey, you see a lot of women.
-Sweetheart, women see me.

801
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:55,645
Yeah, anyway, could you show this around?

802
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,483
She's missing.

803
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,953
God, another runaway housewife?

804
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:05,219
Yes, yes, yes.
Now stop talking. You'll crack.

805
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,764
Too late for that.
I already cracked a couple of years ago.

806
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,029
No way.

807
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,069
I just filled this thing up.

808
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:56,598
Shit.

809
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,633
It's okay. It's all right. It's me.

810
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:09,005
Reece, calm down.
I didn't mean to scare you.

811
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:10,976
-You all right?
-Reece.

812
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,441
Is everything okay?

813
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:16,780
I saw your note at Brody's.
I came looking for you.

814
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:20,117
We found someone. A woman, a body.

815
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:24,119
You were right, Reece.
Come on, let's get out of here.

816
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,264
We should tell him about your apartment

817
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,767
and about the gas
that was siphoned out of my car.

818
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:37,361
I need to be a credible witness.
That's what the police want, credibility.

819
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,667
-It's all credible.
-Oh, okay.

820
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:40,537
"Hey Rick, you know
how I was crazy before?

821
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,612
"Well, the killer thinks I'm crazy, too.
And he's trying to drive me insane."

822
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:46,078
"Oh, how's that, Reece?"
"Well, he got into my apartment,

823
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,845
"he put day-glow paint all over, and he
siphoned the gas out of Brody's car."

824
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:52,011
And he put all those X's
on the photographs.

825
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:55,352
Actually I did that. Before.

826
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,916
-I see your point.
-Thank you.

827
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,689
Sorry I scared you, Reece.

828
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,459
Are those the pictures?

829
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,129
They're not easy to look at,
so take your time.

830
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:13,038
She was in the woods for a couple of days
before the kids found her.

831
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,204
A day or two?
It's been weeks since she was killed.

832
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,281
That's if she was killed
the day Reece saw her.

833
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,215
She could have been taken some place,
killed later.

834
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,383
-She was younger.
-Reece, you were a long ways away.

835
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:31,015
This is not her.
It's not the woman I saw killed.

836
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,496
I heard about the woman they found.

837
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:44,732
With your history,
it must be a little rough on you.

838
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:46,340
A lot rougher on her, I'd say.

839
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,343
-At least you know they found her.
-It isn't her.

840
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,242
Have you ever tried aromatherapy?

841
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:55,215
'Cause nothing soothes me
like a little lavender oil after a hot bath.

842
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,285
I'm sure it would help with the confusion.

843
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,878
-Anything else, Reece?
-I think I've had about all I can take.

844
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,825
Lunch is slow. Take your break.

845
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,900
No. I owe you time.
Plus, we're low on potato salad.

846
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,366
You know, Joanie,
we should really use some fresh dill.

847
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,769
Customers don't give a rat's ass
about fresh dill.

848
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:22,367
Well, they should. And you should.
No, we're in the make-do business.

849
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:26,209
Not make-better, make-do.
Oh, I'm tired of settling for less.

850
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:28,215
What is stuck in your craw?

851
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:34,117
Joanie, why would Lo be taking stuff
out of a cabin near the lake?

852
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:35,780
-You mean one of my cabins?
-Yeah.

853
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,018
Getting ready for hunting season,
he does it every year.

854
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:42,427
Oh. Well, have you ever met
the married woman he had an affair with?

855
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:43,656
-What?
-Have you?

856
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:44,858
Once.

857
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,499
-What happened to her?
-Get out of my kitchen.

858
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,867
-I'm sorry. I...
-Not my son.

859
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,874
You cannot place
your imaginary murder on my son.

860
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,111
Get back to work.

861
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:19,093
-You having a party?
-Yep, I am. Care to join me?

862
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,465
-What the occasion?
-I quit.

863
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:24,071
Oh, why?

864
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,567
You know what your problem is? This.

865
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,303
Just one chair.

866
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:32,573
You actually live your life
hoping that no one will ever show up.

867
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,239
Well, you're in a fine mood.

868
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:38,116
Yeah, well, if I left, the only thing
you'd miss is a decent, hot meal.

869
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,450
At least there's something.

870
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:45,321
Screw you.

871
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,131
-Where are you going?
-I don't know.

872
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,106
Come on.

873
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,384
This is my mother's recipe.
It's kind of famous.

874
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,357
You open a can, you heat it,

875
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,157
then you pour it in a bowl.

876
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,263
Thank you.

877
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,193
-I'm so sorry.
-Shut up and eat.

878
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,863
Brody, it's time for me to move on.

879
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:33,998
I've overstayed my welcome.

880
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,873
-On many levels.
-Where would you go?

881
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:38,877
-I don't know.
-Good plan.

882
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:44,945
I have feelings for you,
and everything's great right now,

883
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:49,285
but I'm worried that it won't be enough

884
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,616
in the long run.

885
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,456
-Well, I can't promise more.
-More?

886
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:57,293
Oh, my gosh, I would be happy
if I could just leave my toothbrush

887
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,457
and not feel guilty about it.

888
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,967
-You can leave your toothbrush.
-I'm not talking about my toothbrush.

889
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,764
Well, why did you
bring up your toothbrush?

890
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,361
I don't... Listen.

891
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,074
After the murder or because of...

892
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:10,543
Because of the murder and my past,

893
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:13,239
I think you're like protector guy,

894
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:16,681
you know, like a hero
from one of your books, and I...

895
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:20,243
You want me to stay
because I have no place to go.

896
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:23,051
You want me to stay
so you can take care of me.

897
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:26,320
I want to stay because you need me.

898
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:31,863
Forget it.

899
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:35,028
-No, no, no, no. It's okay.
-Stay.

900
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,668
Stay.

901
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,691
I made a list of possible suspects.

902
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:07,026
-Lo and Debbie Marsden?
-Yeah.

903
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,126
I just... I put her there
'cause I don't really like her.

904
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,138
Well, you can take Lo off the list, too.

905
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,869
Lo had an affair with a married woman
and it ended badly.

906
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,911
-Doesn't make him a killer.
-What about the hat?

907
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:18,741
-Everyone in town has that hat.
-Okay.

908
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,305
After the killing, he wasn't as nice to me.

909
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:26,319
Okay, I'll chalk that one up
to being the town loony.

910
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:30,585
But there's still the fact that I saw Lo
cleaning out one of Joanie's cabins.

911
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:34,150
And even Rick said it. You know, the killer
might have put the woman somewhere.

912
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:37,096
Maybe Lo took her there
and then cleaned up all the evidence.

913
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,602
Okay, what if it was Miss Scarlet
in the library with the candlestick?

914
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,433
It's not Lo.

915
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,442
-How do you know?
-I know Lo.

916
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:50,944
"I know Lo."

917
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,357
Reece?

918
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,660
-Reece.
-He's out there.

919
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:16,930
Who?

920
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,631
-Reece.
-He's out there.

921
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,875
Give me the knife. Give me the knife.

922
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:28,010
Get inside. Lock the door. Lock the door.

923
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,000
Reece, open up. It's okay.

924
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,252
He's gone. It's okay. I called the sheriff.

925
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,956
-He must have been watching the house.
-What "he"?

926
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:15,621
There's no evidence he was in the cabin
or anywhere near the cabin.

927
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,824
-You didn't see him, I didn't see him.
-But Reece saw him.

928
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,901
And you're sleeping with her,
so you gotta believe her.

929
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,902
To me, she's just a woman
with an emotional disorder

930
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:23,471
who claims she's seen the same man

931
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,336
she saw kill some unknown woman
only she's seen.

932
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:30,172
Look, do us all a favor, Brody,
talk her into getting some help.

933
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:34,904
-I thought better of you, Rick.
-I thought better of you, Brody.

934
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:38,180
You know, I'm tired of answering
every time Reece Gilmore cries wolf.

935
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:42,313
Now you call me when there's a real crime.
I've got better things to do.

936
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:50,126
-Rick's not gonna be much help.
-I don't care. Get your coat on.

937
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,757
-Why?
-We're spending the night in Jackson.

938
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,631
Someone named Marlie called.
She knows the girl in the sketch.

939
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:57,364
We'll hook up with her
first thing in the morning.

940
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:58,803
I called you right away.

941
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:01,467
The minute Serge showed me your drawing,
I knew it was her.

942
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:03,976
Deena James. She used to live
in the apartment above me.

943
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:05,205
Used to?

944
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:06,678
Left town right before
I started working here.

945
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:09,774
Wrote a letter to the super,
told him to sell all her stuff, she was gone.

946
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,046
-How come?
-We weren't exactly friends.

947
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,679
-She was a stripper.
-Stripper.

948
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,815
Yeah, you know,
takes clothes off for a living.

949
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,825
Not the sort of person I want around my kid.

950
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,053
Sure.

951
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:24,189
Then she got a guy she called "Trout."
Get it? Her fish on the line.

952
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,529
-Did you ever see him?
-Not him or his car.

953
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:27,863
He bought her stuff, though.

954
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:30,301
Deena used to go around
showing off this necklace he gave her.

955
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,498
She said it was mother of pearl
and diamonds.

956
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,474
Looked like a little half-circle
surrounded by rhinestones to me.

957
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:36,908
Was supposed to be the moon.

958
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:40,209
Trout called Deena
his dark side of the moon.

959
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:43,148
-Well, whatever happened to the Trout?
-I have no idea.

960
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:46,243
Must have dropped her, I guess.
Never saw him again.

961
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:49,221
<i>Deena Black is involved with a man</i>
<i>who doesn't want to be seen with her</i>

962
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:51,383
yet he's in deep enough
to buy her jewelry.

963
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:53,654
-She didn't love him.
-How do you know that?

964
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:54,888
"The Trout"?

965
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:57,521
No woman talks about a man she loves
that way.

966
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:59,429
He's married. He wants to break it off.

967
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:02,059
Deena sees a good thing coming to an end
and pushes him.

968
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,765
-He pushes back.
-Pushes until it kills her.

969
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:08,934
How many jewelry stores
do you think there are in Jackson Hole?

970
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,306
Too many.

971
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:24,114
<i>...travel advisories will be put into effect</i>
<i>in the mountains and passes</i>

972
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:27,195
<i>and the state transportation</i>
<i>and safety crews will be upgraded</i>

973
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,762
<i>to working in 24-hour shifts...</i>

974
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:32,095
Good afternoon.
Is there something I might show you?

975
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,930
Well, I certainly hope so.
We've been to five other stores.

976
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:37,766
A friend of mine had a necklace
and I'm trying to find the same one.

977
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,206
It's a moon pendant
with mother of pearl and diamonds.

978
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,811
Well, it could have been
part of our Universe of Gems series.

979
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:48,042
We had several pieces designed last year
with moons, stars, suns, planets.

980
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,879
Perhaps if your friend came in
with the necklace?

981
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:53,716
Her name is Deena James. She's missing.

982
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,790
And the necklace is all we have on her.

983
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:01,327
-Are you with the police?
-No.

984
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:04,227
Well, in that case, I'm afraid I can't give you
any more information.

985
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:11,167
-Is that Lo?
-Where?

986
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,170
Why would he be in Jackson Hole
on the same day we are?

987
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:19,304
-Well, a lot of people come to Jackson.
-No, he was following us.

988
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:23,180
Okay, finally I'm going to say it.
You're crazy.

989
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,583
If Lo didn't do it, who else did?

990
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:29,178
Look, older men fall for women like Deena,
not punks like Lo.

991
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:33,588
I'm gonna talk to Rick, see if he can
pull some strings with the Jackson police.

992
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:36,323
But until then you need to cool your jets.

993
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:39,059
-Why?
-Because if it is Lo,

994
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:42,193
things could get dicey
if he knows how close we are.

995
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:50,870
Hey.

996
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,508
-Hey.
-I hate men.

997
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:56,982
They're all lying, cheating dogs,

998
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,645
and Lo is the biggest liar-cheater
of them all.

999
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:05,351
Last night, he told me he had to stay
at the ranch helping out a colicky mare.

1000
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,587
Was he? No.

1001
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:12,530
Ruben passed by not 15 minutes ago
asking me how I liked the movie last night.

1002
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,364
The movie Lo supposedly took me to.

1003
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,397
He said he loved me
and now he's out catting around.

1004
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:24,578
-I saw him in Jackson Hole.
-With who?

1005
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:26,706
No one.

1006
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:28,749
-He was alone?
-Yeah.

1007
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,115
-Alone alone?
-I only saw him for a second.

1008
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,583
It must be part of the surprise.

1009
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:41,690
Lo said he had a surprise for me
and not to tell anyone.

1010
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:44,196
Don't go.

1011
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:47,132
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm gonna go.

1012
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:49,066
When you, when...

1013
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,694
When you get there, could you just call me

1014
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:53,865
when you get wherever
and Lo tells you the surprise?

1015
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:55,636
Just call me.

1016
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:59,446
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm worried. That's all.

1017
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,709
You're worried? About Lo? Why?

1018
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:06,118
Just... Please just call me, Linda-Gail.

1019
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,048
All right.

1020
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:42,013
<i>Forecasters say this early winter storm</i>
<i>will drop temperatures into the 20s</i>

1021
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:45,786
<i>and produce an average of six to 10 inches</i>
<i>of snow across the state.</i>

1022
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:49,921
<i>With the 18 to 22 inches expected</i>
<i>to come down in the local mountains...</i>

1023
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:52,428
Hello?

1024
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,502
You got my message?

1025
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:59,266
Listen, I know this is going to sound crazy,
but today at Jackson Hole with Reece...

1026
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:03,769
Where? Okay, sure.

1027
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:10,946
Joanie?

1028
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:16,789
I was really a bitch the other day.

1029
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:20,054
I had no right to insult you or Lo,

1030
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:24,291
and I just jumped on you and Brody
because you're the closest,

1031
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:26,890
and I'm so, so sorry.

1032
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:33,130
I can take almost anything.

1033
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:36,642
But I will never hear you
talk about Lo like that again.

1034
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:40,913
Unless things don't go so well
with Linda-Gail.

1035
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:42,812
Then whatever you thought about Lo

1036
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:46,444
will be nothing to the pounding I give him
for breaking that girl's heart.

1037
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,488
I'll tell you one thing.

1038
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:51,184
I hope they get their feelings all sorted.

1039
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,692
'Cause this whole "Everything's sunshine,
roses and moonbeams"

1040
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:55,092
is not working for me.

1041
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:58,597
Linda-Gail and Lo, you and Brody.

1042
01:23:58,733 --> 01:23:59,927
What did you say?

1043
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,935
-You and Brody.
-No, no, no.

1044
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,867
"Sunshine and moonbeams."

1045
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,072
God, I'm so stupid.

1046
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:09,838
I gotta go.

1047
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:14,108
Has this got anything to do with Lo?
'Cause if you're still suspecting him...

1048
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:20,447
Lo?

1049
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:33,593
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna scream.

1050
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,231
Do you promise?

1051
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:44,707
Oh, my God.

1052
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:48,872
Is this why you were in Jackson yesterday?

1053
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:51,178
Buying all these flowers?

1054
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:54,050
How did you know that I was in Jackson?

1055
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:57,088
No, that's not why.

1056
01:24:58,259 --> 01:24:59,749
This is why.

1057
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:07,466
Linda-Gail, I'm sick and tired
of lurking outside of that restaurant,

1058
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:11,060
watching you close the place
just so I can feel close to you.

1059
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,402
I'm done wasting my time on wild women.

1060
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:18,375
I love you.

1061
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,380
I really do, I love you.

1062
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:25,078
And I'm willing to work hard
for the rest of my life to make you happy.

1063
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,621
-lf you'll have me, I will.
-Yes.

1064
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,920
-Yeah?
-Yes, a million times, yes, yes!

1065
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,700
-Reece.
-I knew it.

1066
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,674
That necklace.

1067
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:32,837
-What?
-You're his sunshine. I heard him say it.

1068
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:35,438
He said you are the sunshine in his life.

1069
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:56,965
Brody?

1070
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,800
Where's Brody?

1071
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:14,515
-What happened?
-His head ran into the back of a shovel.

1072
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:18,184
When he comes to,
we're all gonna take a hike.

1073
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:21,524
-We're not going anywhere.
-Oh, sure, you are.

1074
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,120
You see, it's part of your plan.

1075
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:27,723
Part of the murder-suicide pact you made
after you snapped.

1076
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,135
First you drugged Brody.

1077
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:33,865
Here are your pills.

1078
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:37,236
Then you shot him, shot yourself

1079
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:41,281
with a gun you took from Joanie's desk.

1080
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,907
-I already called the state police.
-No, you haven't.

1081
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,815
Why did you kill Deena James?

1082
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,582
-You just wouldn't let it go, would you?
-Was she blackmailing you?

1083
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,488
-Or threatening you?
-It was supposed to be sex.

1084
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,057
Just one night.

1085
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:57,397
Things a man can't do with his wife.

1086
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:01,260
Something about her got to me.

1087
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:03,832
The dark and the light.

1088
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:06,804
Asking, demanding money.

1089
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:09,635
I...

1090
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:14,579
The river, you were trying to let her go.

1091
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:19,482
-Yeah.
-I saw that. She wouldn't listen.

1092
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,917
She wanted me to leave my wife.

1093
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,922
-Leave your wife!
-It's over.

1094
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,624
It's not over!

1095
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:27,592
When I said I wouldn't, she came at me.

1096
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,594
I snapped.

1097
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:43,037
<i>Then I buried her.</i>

1098
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:45,506
I had to cover my tracks.

1099
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:49,278
I sent a letter to her super.

1100
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:55,186
If Deena was buried, then who was
the woman the kids found in the woods?

1101
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:59,054
A 43-year-old burnout from Seattle.

1102
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:02,492
Almost matched the description
of your victim perfectly.

1103
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:03,894
Except she wasn't beaten.

1104
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:06,762
Anybody else would have barely even
looked at those forensic photographs.

1105
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:10,167
You. You had to look for details.

1106
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:13,867
Why couldn't you just leave?

1107
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:16,875
-That's all I wanted.
-You didn't have a choice.

1108
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:18,410
Damn right, I didn't have a choice.

1109
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:20,242
Deena pushed you. I...

1110
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,747
You were trying to protect yourself
and your family...

1111
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,751
You're right. Protecting my family.

1112
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:30,153
I'm on your side. Brody and me, we'll leave.
We'll leave tonight.

1113
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:32,055
I wish you could.

1114
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:35,755
Run, Reece! Run!

1115
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:46,737
Get up.

1116
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,402
Go!

1117
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:19,698
You can't hide, Reece!

1118
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:21,434
This is my land!

1119
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:24,472
My turf!

1120
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:33,612
I can track you
just as easy as walking down Main Street.

1121
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:38,315
Is this what you want?

1122
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:43,162
Blow his head off
while you're out there hiding and watching?

1123
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:48,428
Huh?

1124
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:55,742
Now, wait a minute.
That scenario sounds familiar, doesn't it?

1125
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:58,937
It's already happened to you once
in Boston, right?

1126
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:21,263
Reece!

1127
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:37,114
Get up.

1128
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,515
Get up!

1129
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:44,655
I'm gonna do you a favor.

1130
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:46,987
I'm gonna shoot you first.

1131
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:51,995
That way you won't have to live through
seeing another person die.

1132
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:53,862
This is over, Reece.

1133
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,093
Reece!

1134
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:10,310
Shoot me.

1135
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:13,886
My life's over anyway.

1136
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:19,989
It won't be that easy.

1137
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:25,393
You fought back, Reece.

1138
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:27,791
You fought back.
