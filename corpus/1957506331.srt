1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,850
(mellow moving music)

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,790
(tense music)
(people chattering)

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,150
- [Man] Ooh, hey, what
you gonna do with that?

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,570
Hey, John, John!

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,150
(somber music)

6
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,380
(thudding)
(guitar cracking)

7
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,750
(mellow music)

8
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,230
(lighthearted music)

9
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,090
- You got it?

10
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,600
- Okay, everybody, come on, hurry up.

11
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,250
He's gonna be here any minute.

12
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,670
Oh, Dede it looks great.

13
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,950
- Thanks.

14
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,800
You look really pretty, Mom.

15
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,620
- Oh, well, thanks.

16
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,450
What do you think about
the colors of this shirt?

17
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,020
- Honey, you look great.

18
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,360
Now, you should try to relax.

19
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,620
Remember to breathe every once in a while.

20
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,520
- Yeah, I know, breathe.

21
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,110
Well, you know, two years, three months,

22
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,160
11 days, 18 hours. (chuckles)

23
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,110
Who's counting?

24
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,310
(melancholic music)

25
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,450
I just want this to be a really nice home.

26
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,410
Okay, everybody, come on, come on now.

27
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,640
Bobby, your brother's home!

28
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,150
Come on, here he comes!

29
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,340
Ah, welcome home, Kenny!

30
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,240
Oh, Kenny!

31
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,810
- Wow, geez.
- Oh darling, welcome home,

32
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,780
Kenny Carlson.

33
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,900
Oh!

34
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,210
- This is so sweet of you, Mom,
you didn't have to do this.

35
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,050
- We wanted to make this

36
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,680
a really special homecoming for you, baby.

37
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,990
- It is. (chuckles)

38
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,630
Oh, my god.

39
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,520
Look at you.

40
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,200
Oh, wow.
- I missed you.

41
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,640
- Look at you!

42
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,160
Your growing up so fast.

43
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,960
The boys must be slitting
their wrists, huh?

44
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,710
- Oh really, come on.

45
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,100
- Ian Matthews.

46
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,960
Welcome home.

47
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,790
- It's good to meet you.

48
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,430
Thank you for the job interview.

49
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,000
- Work hard and make her happy.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,090
That's all the thanks I need.

51
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,920
- Yeah, I will.

52
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,240
- Oh, baby.

53
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,070
- Yeah.

54
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,010
(video game beeping)

55
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,680
What's up, Termite?

56
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,090
- My name's Bobby.

57
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,920
- Bobby.

58
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,660
- I know your name, lil' brother.

59
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,660
That's all right.

60
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,720
- I don't know what's
the matter with Bobby.

61
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,470
He's been looking forward
to this for so long.

62
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,740
- Oh, don't worry about it, Mom.

63
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,600
I know he has.

64
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,410
He's just nervous.

65
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,200
His big brother just
came home from prison.

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,010
(laughs)

67
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,930
Wow! What a feeling.

68
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,840
You have no idea how good it feels

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,350
just to be able to open up a refrigerator

70
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,700
and take whatever you want.

71
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,400
Wow.

72
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,150
Ian, how about a beer?

73
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,980
- Wait a minute.

74
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,820
Hold, I've got cake and
ice cream over here.

75
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,440
- Oh, right, Mom.

76
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,050
(laughs)

77
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,610
Top of the world, Ma.

78
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,080
(crickets chirping)

79
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,150
How long you been standing there?

80
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,390
- Couple of seconds.

81
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,500
Like lookin' at you.

82
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,010
Haven't been able to do
that in a couple of years.

83
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,010
- Anybody been driving the truck?

84
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,980
- [Sharon] You kiddin', that bag of bolts?

85
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,620
Hadn't moved two inches in two years.

86
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,080
- It's a '54 Chevy five-window pickup.

87
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,970
I know guys who'd kill for that.

88
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,830
How 'bout I fix it?

89
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,090
- I want you to do
whatever makes you happy.

90
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,500
I want you to start your new life.

91
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,610
(grunts)

92
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,890
(Sharon sighs)

93
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,640
- So tell me about the duke, huh?

94
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,540
- The duke?

95
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,140
- John Wayne?

96
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,620
(scoffs)
The cowboy.

97
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,040
- Kenny, come on.

98
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,550
- What?

99
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,740
- Well, Ian's back at the ranch.

100
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,700
He sleeps there most of the time.

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,750
- And why's that?

102
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,890
He looks like a good guy.

103
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,120
What are you two waitin' for, huh?

104
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,700
- Well, because we're dating.

105
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,240
- Old-fashioned.

106
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,460
I like that.

107
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,580
(laughing)

108
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,960
- Oh, boy.

109
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,230
I can't believe this is true.

110
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,690
(mellow music)

111
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,630
Feel like I'm dreamin'
and I'm gonna wake up.

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,340
- It's not a dream.

113
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,920
More like the end of a nightmare.

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,200
- Yeah.

115
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,610
- Long nightmare.

116
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,970
Two years of my life.

117
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,080
- It's over.

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,910
- Is it?

119
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,820
I don't know.

120
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,060
They say coming out of prison, it's rough.

121
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,320
- You're gonna make it.

122
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,980
I believe in you.

123
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,020
- I love you.

124
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,290
- I love you.

125
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,160
- And I'm sorry for all
the things that I've done.

126
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,220
- Oh, now. (hushing)

127
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,590
- The things that I should've
done and I didn't do

128
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,420
and the things that...

129
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,690
What a mess.

130
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,770
Here, I should've been
making you proud instead-

131
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,940
(hushing)

132
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,870
- You're home now

133
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,020
and everything's gonna
be just like it was.

134
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,800
No more troubles.

135
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,090
(knocking)

136
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,380
- Yeah?

137
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,210
- Termite.

138
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,300
What you readin'?

139
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,060
- Usual crap, you know,
brain-rotting stuff.

140
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,810
You want somethin'?

141
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,430
- [Kenny] Well, how do you feel about me

142
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,550
taking this top bunk tonight?

143
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,200
- In here with me?

144
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,930
- If you don't like it, that's cool.

145
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,700
- No, man, that'd be great. Sure.

146
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,530
- All right.

147
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,460
(Kenny chuckles)

148
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,600
Oh, man, these sheets feel good.

149
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,280
- Night, Kenny.

150
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,530
- [Kenny] Goodnight, buddy.

151
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,830
- Kenny?

152
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,660
- Yeah, buddy?

153
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,530
Just wondering.

154
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,930
Are you okay?

155
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,930
I mean, you know, I saw
this prison movie on cable

156
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,180
where they took this
guy in the laundry room.

157
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,130
- Wait a minute.

158
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,010
Is that what you've been so
quiet about since I got home?

159
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,090
Listen, buddy, nothing happened. I'm fine.

160
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,610
- Really?

161
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,560
- Nothing happened.

162
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,650
(melancholic music)

163
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,480
- [Bobby] Kenny?

164
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
- [Kenny] Yeah.

165
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,580
- I'm glad you're okay

166
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,270
'cause in the movie, they
hurt the guy real bad.

167
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,700
(birds chirping)

168
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,990
- Whoa!

169
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,710
- You wouldn't guess where I
learned how to fix engines.

170
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,540
- This is great!

171
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,510
I can't believe you did this.

172
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,100
- Well, all it needed was
a couple of new plugs,

173
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,810
clean out the carbs a little.

174
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,470
What do you say we let Dede take Bobby

175
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,570
to school in the sedan?

176
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,430
You and I can take the truck.

177
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,670
- Absolutely.

178
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,840
- Right this way, milady.

179
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,710
- Thank you.

180
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,540
- There you go.

181
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,690
Yeah, this looks like the place.

182
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,520
- [Sharon] All right.

183
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,440
- Now, you remember how
to drive this thing?

184
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,750
- Oh, come on!

185
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,360
I taught you, didn't I?

186
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,230
You nervous?

187
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,930
- Yeah, little bit.

188
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,180
- You're a good mechanic.

189
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,860
You remember that.

190
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,010
Well, I don't know anybody else

191
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,560
who could've fixed this thing.

192
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,770
I love you.

193
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,600
- [Kenny] I love you too.

194
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,430
- Bye.

195
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,270
- [Kenny] Let me.

196
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,100
- Watch out.

197
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,930
- All right.

198
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,330
- Comin' through.

199
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,500
- Can I help you, son?

200
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,670
- Yeah, I'm Kenny Carlson.

201
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,010
Ian Matthews spoke to you about me.

202
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,310
- Oh, right, right.

203
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,140
I clean forgot.

204
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,630
How long you been home?

205
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,700
- [Kenny] Since last night.

206
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,490
- So, you know anything about boats?

207
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,320
- Some.

208
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,750
Plus I worked the motor pool
while I was, while I was away.

209
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,000
- So what were you in for?

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,960
Figure I got a right to know

211
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,290
if you're gonna be working here.

212
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,150
- Yeah, armed robbery.

213
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,910
Me and a couple of buddies
were out drinking one night

214
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,710
and they jacked a convenience store.

215
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,100
I was standing in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

216
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,700
Listen, no excuses, I was there.

217
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,550
I could've split but I didn't.

218
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,350
I understand if you don't
wanna take a chance.

219
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,770
A lot of people feel that way.

220
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,760
- I got no problem.

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,400
You work hard, keep your
nose clean, that's all I ask.

222
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,650
It's eight bucks an hour.

223
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,540
You might as well get
started if you want it.

224
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,880
Tools are in the truck.

225
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,900
Number 26 needs an oil change.

226
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,500
Need to varnish those rails.

227
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,820
And stow the rest of this gear in the box.

228
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,600
(lighthearted music)

229
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,520
- Yes, sir.

230
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,860
(people chattering)

231
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,800
- Chili de Mackie.

232
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,320
Changed the recipe.

233
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,580
All right, what do you
think? What do you think?

234
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,610
- Oh whoa, I can feed myself.

235
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,560
- All right, go to it.

236
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,420
Give it to me straight, doc.

237
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,600
- Hold on, it's hot.

238
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,430
- It's supposed to be hot.

239
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,930
It's chili for cryin' out loud.

240
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,040
- You're a genius.

241
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,600
- I know that, but how
does the chili taste?

242
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,790
- You know, if I take some home to Kenny,

243
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,730
bet he'll love it too.

244
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,330
- Excuse me, genius.

245
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,890
Table four is still waitin'
on their veal chops.

246
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,710
- Hey! They want it now
or do they want it cooked?

247
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,100
It's ready when it's ready.

248
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,840
- Mackie, I was wondering if I could leave

249
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,090
a little early today.

250
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,720
- Why don't you invite
table four into the kitchen?

251
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,590
They can cook it themselves.

252
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,230
Sharon, that's the
fifth time in two weeks.

253
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,350
- Well, yeah, I know but
kinda like to be there

254
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,280
when Kenny gets home.

255
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,330
You know, he's been working so hard and-

256
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,220
- Yeah but look,

257
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,320
the crowd's just barely
starting to come in.

258
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,770
- Bet Claire could cover
for me, couldn't you?

259
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,500
- Oh, of course, Claire
could cover, why not?

260
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,420
- Good, okay.

261
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,250
- Hey, thanks, Mack.

262
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,560
- Nelson Mandela didn't
get this much attention

263
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,390
when he got out.

264
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,480
- Look, I'd like to see one of your kids

265
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,890
walk a mile in Kenny's shoes.

266
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,960
See how far he'd get.

267
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,280
- Kenny's shoes.

268
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,340
Probably stole 'em.

269
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,380
- [Sharon] Kenny?

270
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,170
(tense music)

271
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,590
Kenny is that you?

272
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,590
Kenny?

273
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,120
- Is that how you greeted
Kenny when he came back?

274
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,910
- He didn't tell me you were out.

275
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,740
- He doesn't know yet.

276
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,020
I just got here.

277
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,910
- How'd you get in?

278
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,640
- Key, behind the bushes under the stone.

279
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,140
Just where Kenny said it'd be.

280
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,820
Learn a lot about a guy

281
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,570
after two years in prison together.

282
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,990
Mm-mm-mm, home cookin'.

283
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,850
Ah, the things I missed in prison.

284
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,900
You'd be surprised what
you learn to live without.

285
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,780
Why don't you just say it?

286
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,270
- Why don't I just say what?

287
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,610
- That you don't want me around.

288
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,450
- Look, you and Kenny
were friends in prison.

289
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,250
I don't want to take away from that.

290
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,770
But he's got a real
chance to start fresh now.

291
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,840
He's got a real chance.

292
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,270
- Thanks for having me.

293
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,720
(bird squawking)

294
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,780
On your knees and wiping
up somebody else's grease.

295
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,700
(chuckles)

296
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,890
You don't mind my saying so,

297
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,040
it's not how I pictured
you on the outside.

298
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,100
- When'd you get out?

299
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,180
- Couple of days ago.

300
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,380
- Yeah, well, you scared my mom.

301
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,770
She called here all upset.
Don't do that again.

302
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,230
- She doesn't want me
to be around. (chuckles)

303
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,190
She figures I'm a bad influence on you.

304
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,540
- Where you gonna stay?

305
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,370
- With you.

306
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,950
You don't mind, do you?

307
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,430
- Listen, Warren, things
are gonna be different now.

308
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,150
Meet me at that restaurant,
top of the road, in 30 minutes.

309
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,150
We'll talk about it.

310
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,510
- You know, Ian invited us
to his place this weekend.

311
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,690
Kids can't go.

312
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,270
You know, they got plans
with their friends.

313
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,050
So I was thinking though,
maybe you'd go with me.

314
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,090
- Is it all right if Warren comes?

315
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,940
- You know you never even told
me Warren was coming here.

316
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,050
- Mom, I didn't know.

317
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
Listen, he's not gonna stay very long.

318
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,390
- He makes me nervous.

319
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,220
- [Kenny] Warren?

320
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,050
- Yeah.

321
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,070
- [Kenny] He's nothin' but mouth.

322
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,040
- You know, I wish you'd really try

323
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,380
to find yourself some new friends.

324
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,180
- Come on, it's only
been a couple of weeks.

325
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,840
People aren't exactly
lining up to be friends

326
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,700
with an ex-con.

327
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,740
But I'm gonna try, I promise.

328
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,090
But in the meantime,

329
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,840
you know I didn't have much
choice of friends up there.

330
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,530
Should cut Warren some slack.

331
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,360
- Okay.

332
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,150
Why don't you go out there and get him?

333
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,380
Tell him dinner's ready.

334
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,960
(mellow music)

335
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,880
- Warren, it's beautiful, isn't it?

336
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,520
And we're not even at peak color yet.

337
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,230
- After gray, any color seems like a lot.

338
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,200
(chuckles)

339
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,720
I like it, all the trees and stuff.

340
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,170
- Warren where'd you grow up?

341
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,380
- Tulsa, mostly.

342
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,600
I like it here, though.

343
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,270
- [Kenny] I thought he lived
up here in Clayton Ridge.

344
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,580
Why are you turning here?

345
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,680
- Well, it's my own private shortcut.

346
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,000
Found it about the third
time I came up here.

347
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,340
Ah, it takes a little longer to get there

348
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,240
but it sure is pretty.

349
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,530
- It takes longer.

350
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,850
That's some shortcut for you.

351
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,260
That's my mom. (chuckles)

352
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,940
- So, Warren, what are your plans?

353
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,440
- Oh, he's gonna go to work with me.

354
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,970
- Oh.

355
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,650
- Warren, you know anything
about boats and engines?

356
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,320
- What he doesn't know, I'll teach him.

357
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm not gonna be polishing
rails forever either, no.

358
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,160
Old Pritchard's old-fashioned.

359
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,220
One of these days, I'm gonna
be running the whole place

360
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,270
the way it should be run.

361
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,550
- W.K. Charters.

362
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,570
- K.W. Charters, letters
overlaid in maritime logo.

363
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,400
- Sweet.

364
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,060
How about a beer?

365
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,690
- No, thanks, I'm driving.

366
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,550
- Maybe next time.

367
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,050
Mama, you know what?

368
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,970
One of these days I'm gonna buy you

369
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,460
one of these places up here.

370
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,570
Big ol' view.

371
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,400
- Oh, yeah?

372
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,810
- You can charge a toll
to all them rich drivers

373
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,060
going by on your shortcut.

374
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,190
- Oh, stop it!

375
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,760
Don't tickle me while I'm driving!

376
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,310
Kenny, I told you stop it.

377
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,140
Stop it.

378
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,320
- [Kenny] Oops!

379
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,150
- [Sharon] Tickling mode!

380
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,980
(Kenny laughing)

381
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,570
(mellow music)

382
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,920
- How you doin', Ian?

383
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,760
Good to see you again.

384
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,650
- Good to see you.

385
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,480
- [Sharon] Hi, honey.

386
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,630
- This is Warren Stubbs.

387
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,730
- Welcome.

388
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,560
- Hey.

389
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,110
Nice wheels. Must've set you
back 30 grand, at least, huh.

390
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,280
- Thereabouts.

391
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,690
Hey.

392
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,640
- Hi, sweetie.

393
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,060
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,980
That's Kenny's friend from prison,

395
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,350
you know, I told you about.

396
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,320
I hope you don't mind.

397
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,850
I couldn't say no.
- No problem.

398
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,430
As long as you're here.

399
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,600
Come on.

400
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,430
- Okay.

401
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,530
(horse neighing)

402
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,300
- [Ian] There you go.

403
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
- All right.

404
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,390
Look at you.

405
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,160
You teach her how to ride like that?

406
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,330
- [Ian] Oh, she's a natural.

407
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,160
- Yeah.

408
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,330
Hey, Warren.

409
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,730
Is it okay?

410
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,070
- Sure.

411
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,060
You know how to ride Warren?

412
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,780
- I grew up in friggin' Oklahoma, man.

413
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,000
(Kenny laughing)
(horse neighing)

414
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,660
- Are you all right?

415
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,310
- I'm from friggin' Oklahoma, man.

416
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,650
- Shut up!

417
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,480
- Oh, I'm sorry.

418
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,650
You're a regular Lakota tribesman.

419
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,800
You know what, take off that saddle.

420
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,620
These Native Americans
like to ride bareback.

421
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,450
- Just shut up, Kenny!

422
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,450
I ain't no friggin' Indian.

423
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,390
- Oh, could've fooled me, Tonto.

424
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,400
- Yeah, well, you don't know
what you're talking about, man.

425
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,230
I grew up with 'em.

426
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,800
Ain't nothing but a
bunch of filthy drunks.

427
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,000
Oughta be sent back where they come from.

428
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,480
- I think this is where they come from.

429
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,900
- Kenny, come on.

430
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,750
Bring the horse, come on.

431
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,120
- Now, it isn't my business
who you hate or why.

432
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,490
You're a friend of Kenny's

433
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,320
so I won't kick your
racist butt into next week.

434
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,190
- Go ahead, I'll be right back.

435
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,750
- But if I hear you talk like
that again, you're outta here.

436
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,410
- That's my mother's boyfriend.

437
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,740
He got me my job.

438
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,480
Don't screw this up for me.

439
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,500
Gettin' ready to pop
the question, I imagine.

440
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,680
- [Sharon] Oh, geez.

441
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,780
- [Kenny] Well, I know about these things.

442
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,230
- [Warren] How touching. (belches)

443
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,760
- [Sharon] Oh damn.

444
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,910
- [Kenny] What's wrong?

445
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,840
- We ran out of gas.

446
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,920
I thought we'd make it.
I should've filled it up.

447
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,870
- Oh, great.

448
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,780
We had to take your scenic shortcut, geez!

449
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,060
- Well, Warren I'm really sorry.

450
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,900
- Warren.

451
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,790
- Well, there ain't
gonna be another damn car

452
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,620
on this road for hours.

453
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,450
- All right, Warren, shut up.

454
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,280
All right, get out.

455
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,120
- Out?

456
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,950
- Get out.

457
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,780
- There's snakes outta here.

458
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,880
- Don't worry about it.

459
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,110
We'll take care of everything.

460
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,540
- Kenny where you goin'?

461
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,760
- Mom, don't worry.

462
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,150
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

463
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,460
Warren and I will cut up through the woods

464
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,480
to the main highway and get us some help.

465
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,850
- You just be careful.

466
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,170
- I will, don't worry.

467
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,460
Let's go.

468
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,340
- There's poison oak in there.

469
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,670
- [Kenny] Warren, let's go.

470
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,630
- [Warren] Ow, ow! Snakes!

471
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,790
Ow!

472
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,860
- [Kenny] Watch your step, there's...

473
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,960
There's the road.

474
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,880
(Warren muttering)

475
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,870
- Man, nobody in their right
mind's gonna stop here.

476
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,290
We'll be stuck out here all night.

477
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,620
- No, there's somebody coming right now.

478
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,190
- Hey, what's the problem, guys?

479
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,100
- Hey, we're stuck down on this
little side road down here,

480
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,220
ran out of gas.

481
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,050
My mother is with me.

482
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,180
- Is she okay?

483
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,460
- Yeah, she's fine but she's
a little bit embarrassed

484
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,000
'cause she forgot to get gas.

485
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,970
- Well, I tell you what.

486
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,920
I'll drive your friend
here to the gas station.

487
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,840
Why don't you stay here with your mother?

488
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,370
You don't want her out
here alone in the woods.

489
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,910
- Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

490
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:27,920
What's your name?

491
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,670
- Mark, Mark Willis.

492
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,290
- Hey, I'm Kenny Carlson.

493
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,580
This is Warren Stubbs.

494
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,600
- It's nice to meet you, Kenny.

495
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,980
Hop on in, Warren.

496
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,720
- I appreciate it.

497
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,390
- [Mark] Sure thing.

498
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,440
- Kenny?

499
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,330
- Yeah, Ma.

500
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,360
- [Sharon] Oh, oh, baby.

501
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,610
- We got some help.

502
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,100
- Oh, good.

503
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,530
- Nothing to worry about.

504
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,800
Warren will be back here
pretty soon with some gas.

505
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,100
- All right, oh, good.

506
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,940
Ooh.

507
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,780
- I told you not to worry about him.

508
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,610
- Yeah, well.

509
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,440
He's a good guy.

510
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,280
- Ooh.

511
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,620
Oh, yeah.

512
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,290
- That better?

513
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,120
- Oh, yeah.

514
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,950
I'd forgotten how you're the only one

515
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,340
who can get that creak out of my neck.

516
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,170
- That's right.

517
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,200
You missed me, huh?

518
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,860
- What do you think?

519
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,570
You know, when I was a little girl,

520
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,790
I used to go to sleep at night

521
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,120
looking at the stars and making wishes.

522
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,550
- Did any of those wishes come true?

523
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,220
- Yeah, you did.

524
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,380
- Well, Mom, if I was
what you were wishing for,

525
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,600
you must've pissed God off real bad.

526
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,090
- That's not true.

527
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,200
You're the most precious gift I ever got.

528
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,490
You know what?

529
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,960
I made another wish tonight.

530
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,540
For you to have a brand new start.

531
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,900
And that one's gonna come true too.

532
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,130
- Yeah.

533
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,230
- [Sharon] Oh, Warren.

534
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,130
(tense music)

535
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,580
- [Kenny] Ma?

536
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,410
- Yeah?

537
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,730
- Look at this, three gallons of gas.

538
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,560
- Oh, good.

539
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,150
- Plenty to get us home, huh?

540
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:25,980
- Yeah.

541
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,240
- Hey, Mom, I'm gonna run up
and give something to this man

542
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,410
that helped us out, okay?

543
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,240
He was real good.

544
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,990
Probably nobody else around
here would've done that.

545
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,180
- I'll meet you at the junction.

546
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,010
- Okay.

547
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,460
(tense music)

548
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,840
Where the hell'd you find that?

549
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,050
- The guy, he had this under his seat.

550
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,950
Yeah, but he never saw me take it.

551
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,100
- Yeah, well, damn,
she might have seen it!

552
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,550
How come he didn't come down here

553
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,110
and bring us the gas himself?

554
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,850
- I guess he didn't feel
like coming down here.

555
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,900
I guess he felt like
sitting in his fancy SUV.

556
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,950
I guess I have no idea why he didn't.

557
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,700
(animal hooting)

558
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,610
(somber music)

559
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,640
- Kenny?

560
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,890
Kenny, you still here?

561
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,360
Oh, great guys.

562
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,630
Leave me out here in the middle of nowhere

563
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,260
to drive home alone.

564
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,260
(tense music)

565
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,350
(phone beeps)

566
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,450
- [Mark] Hi, honey.

567
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,460
Sorry I'm late getting back

568
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,490
but I see you aren't home
from Millie's yet either.

569
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,350
Reason I'm late, I stopped to
help a couple of young guys

570
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,440
and their mom near Clayton Ridge.

571
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,700
Well, I'll see you later.

572
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,290
Save me a piece of that cobbler.

573
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,590
I love you, bye.

574
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,410
(phone beeps)

575
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,610
- It's only been a few hours.

576
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,690
- Please, look for him.

577
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,360
It's not like him to
just disappear like this.

578
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,160
He's always stopping to help people.

579
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,300
- Nice guy, huh?

580
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,650
Well, I can't officially
do anything for 48 hours.

581
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,070
Why don't I do this? Why don't I do this?

582
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,470
Why don't I go up to the ridge

583
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,570
and I'll ask some folks if
anybody saw anything, okay?

584
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,180
- Thank you.

585
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,080
- We'll find him. He'll turn up, okay?

586
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,260
- Oh, hi, honey.

587
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,090
Heard from Kenny?

588
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,950
- Yeah, he's in the kitchen.

589
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,100
- Oh, where has he been?

590
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,930
- [Dede] I don't know.

591
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,450
- By the way, where you goin'?

592
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,980
- Over to Skip's to
study for the trig test.

593
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,810
- Ah, Skip, Skip, Skip who?

594
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,690
Do I know Skip?

595
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,030
- His family just moved here from LA.

596
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,590
- Oh, yeah, yeah, the
big house near Stanton's.

597
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,510
I'm impressed.

598
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,130
- Well, don't start
buying any baby clothes.

599
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,440
(chuckles)

600
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,280
- Oh-oh-oh.

601
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,330
(sighs)

602
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,000
Okay, Kenny. Don't hide from me.

603
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,690
- [Kenny] I ain't hiding from you.

604
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,260
I'm trying to fix this sink.

605
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,400
When's the last time somebody
looked at these pipes?

606
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,350
- Well, probably since
before you left home.

607
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,680
Kenny, how could you do that?

608
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,240
- Do what?

609
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,310
Oh hey, did you see the
check I left for you?

610
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,550
Figured I'd keep one of
'em out of the month,

611
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,670
give the rest to you.

612
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,750
- Yeah, I got it. It'll really help.

613
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,580
Thanks a lot.

614
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,570
Let's get back to the subject.

615
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,470
You left me alone in
the middle of the night.

616
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,600
- What're you talkin' about?

617
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,510
What, leaving you alone
on your very own shortcut

618
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,730
which I'm sure you've
been on alone before.

619
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,820
You had gas which Warren
went to go get for you.

620
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,880
What's the problem?

621
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,260
Eh?

622
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,820
Just like new. This
family really missed me.

623
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,610
- Well, don't make me guess.

624
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,590
Tell me what happened.

625
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,610
- Well, that guy Willis was cool.

626
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,100
We bought him a beer to say thank you.

627
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,710
Hung out for a little while
and by the time I got home,

628
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,650
it was time to get dressed and go to work.

629
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,480
That's it.

630
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,660
Case closed.

631
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,520
- Sure wish I'd known.

632
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,190
- Mom, I'll tell you what, I'm sorry.

633
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,440
But if I got to ask your permission

634
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,160
every time I wanna go get a drink,

635
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,760
I may as well be back in jail.

636
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,830
Maybe I should just move out.

637
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,310
- Yeah, that's what I want you to do.

638
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,400
I want you to move out,
I haven't missed you.

639
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,920
Oh, come on, Kenny, I was just worried.

640
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,280
You want me to make you
a sandwich, huh? huh?

641
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,240
- No, thank you, hey.
- You're lookin' thin,

642
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,200
Lookin' thin.

643
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,330
- I'm going to bed. Good night.

644
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,590
- Good night.

645
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,420
Thank you, sweetie.

646
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,460
- [Kenny] You're welcome.

647
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,240
(sighs)

648
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,490
(chuckles)

649
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,930
(people chattering)

650
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,120
- [Man] You know what, a
friend of mine had a burger.

651
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,510
- Eat from your own plate.

652
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,420
- Excuse me, it was just sitting there.

653
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,000
- Yeah, well, maybe I was gonna eat it.

654
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,410
- Hey, you guys stop fighting.

655
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,340
My mom works here.

656
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,280
You want more, she'll bring us more.

657
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,270
- [Skip] Your mom's a hottie.

658
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,750
- If my mother worked
in a place like this,

659
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,200
I'd never set foot in the joint.

660
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,750
She'd be all over me.

661
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,530
Don't pick at your food.

662
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,030
Where's your manners?

663
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,520
- She's pretty cool.

664
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,500
Never really gets on my case.

665
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,830
- I could use that in my life.

666
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,720
My folks want every detail of every day

667
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,160
like they give a damn.

668
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,130
- No, no, no, just some
coffee, just some coffee.

669
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,380
Thanks.

670
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,150
And how about a dozen donuts?

671
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,270
I'm kidding.

672
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,350
(people chattering)

673
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,990
Sharon Carlson?

674
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,370
- Yeah, that's right.

675
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,340
- That Matthews fella told me
that I could find you here.

676
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,280
- Who, Ian?

677
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,590
- Yeah, yeah, I spent the morning

678
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,650
interviewing everyone up on Clayton Ridge.

679
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,840
He said that you and your sons

680
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,070
needed a little help with
your car the other night.

681
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,090
- Son. Singular.

682
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,890
The other kid's a friend of his.

683
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,600
And yes, a man did help us.

684
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,880
We ran out of gas.

685
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,190
Stupid me.

686
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,120
It was a nice thing for him to do.

687
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,370
Why, somethin' wrong?

688
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,100
- What's with the cop?

689
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,630
- They're probably here about her brother

690
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,100
follow up or something.

691
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,930
- [Skip] Her brother?

692
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,460
- Two years for stealing,
just got out on parole.

693
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,180
- Sweet.

694
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,320
Let's go.

695
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,880
- Thanks a lot.

696
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,280
It's nobody's business
where my brother's been.

697
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,460
- Excuse me, it's not like he
was in a resort for two years.

698
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,100
- Wish I could tell you more

699
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,930
but I never saw him to say thank you.

700
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,930
- Maybe I should talk to your boy Kenny.

701
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,680
Ms. Carlson, the wife of this missing man,

702
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,790
she's just worried sick

703
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,680
that something terrible
has happened to him.

704
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,820
I think anything we could
do to help ease her mind

705
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,280
would be a help.

706
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,840
- He'll be home around seven.

707
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,270
- Seven o'clock tonight.

708
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,100
- Yeah.

709
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,540
- Thank you.

710
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,040
(tense music)

711
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,310
So, Kenny, your mother tells me

712
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,690
that you and your friend and
Mr. Willis went out for a drink

713
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,780
after he helped you.

714
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,980
Which bar did you go to?

715
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,250
- No, sorry about that.

716
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,800
My mother is wrong.

717
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,750
We went and drank.

718
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,100
He had a bottle in his car.

719
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,590
- Sorry.

720
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,420
- It's all right.

721
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,700
We went up to Gopher Pass up off by 115.

722
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,490
- Yeah, right, okay.

723
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,160
- We sat there and we drank for a while

724
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,600
and we talked and then
when we were through,

725
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,400
he took us back to the Jack Frost Diner

726
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,980
and he was saying how his wife

727
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,790
was gonna be all pissed
off at him and that was it.

728
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,440
Me and Warren had some
breakfast and we went to work.

729
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,860
- What's Warren's last name?

730
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,130
- Stubbs.

731
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,520
- Mm-hm.

732
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,480
And do you know where he is right now?

733
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,510
- I don't know about that.

734
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,380
- All right.

735
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,420
Is there anything else you
can think of, either of you?

736
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,200
- No, not me.

737
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,140
- You know, I hope he's all right.

738
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,070
I didn't know how to thank him.

739
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,330
He was...

740
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,120
Not very many people who
would've helped us out

741
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,520
in that kind of a situation.

742
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,900
- Okay.

743
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,580
All right, well, here's my card.

744
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,910
You can call me if you
think of anything else,

745
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,440
either of you, and Kenny
thanks for having me.

746
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,270
- Sure.

747
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,170
- Okay, thank you.

748
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,570
- Thank you, good night.

749
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,400
- [Kenny] Take care.

750
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,240
- [Harley] Okay.

751
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,300
- Huh.

752
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,890
- How could you do that?

753
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,250
You're my mother.

754
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,560
You're supposed to protect me.

755
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,910
- Kenny, what are you talking about?

756
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,300
I just told him what you told me.

757
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,350
You didn't take that man's car.

758
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,650
- Mom, I've been in jail.

759
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,450
All right, the police are
automatically gonna figure

760
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,070
that I'm responsible for every crime

761
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,250
that happens in this county.

762
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,500
- Did you take his car?

763
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,320
- Yes, all right?

764
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,150
We did.

765
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,850
Mom, because he was talking
about how much money he had

766
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,310
and the big giant ski chalet

767
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,210
and that he and his wife were gonna go off

768
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,970
and go to Europe for the spring.

769
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,160
- Honey, what else did you do?

770
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,910
- Mom, we didn't do, we
didn't hurt him, I promise.

771
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,450
If somebody else hurt that guy,

772
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,330
they did it after we were there.

773
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,160
- Warren.

774
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,330
See, I knew it was Warren.

775
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,230
I knew if you hung around with Warren

776
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,330
that something would happen.

777
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,800
Did you even think about your parole?

778
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,510
Did you even have any
idea what could happen?

779
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,680
- Yes, of course, I did.

780
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,290
And it's gonna be the same
thing that always happens to me.

781
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,880
I end up doing hard time

782
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,630
for something that doesn't
deserve a slap on the wrist.

783
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,530
(tense music)

784
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,530
(people chattering)

785
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,590
- [Police Officer] Hey,
Tom, right down here.

786
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,170
(camera clicks)
(tense music)

787
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,170
(people chattering)

788
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,880
Three more over here.

789
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,820
Careful with that.

790
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,590
Hey, Tom.

791
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,250
(camera clicks)

792
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,780
- So, how do I already know
this is gonna be Mark Willis?

793
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,180
- Well, the clothes match
but it's hard to tell.

794
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,440
Look what somebody's done
to this poor bastard.

795
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,010
(police dispatch speaking faintly)

796
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,490
- And the body, found in a deserted area

797
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,610
off State Highway 115, has been identified

798
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,180
as that of Mark Willis,

799
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,970
a Gold Ridge man who had been missing

800
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,540
for the past three days.

801
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,370
- Flip it back.

802
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,110
- Why?

803
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,260
- Just flip it back, I wanna hear it.

804
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,710
- [Reporter] Mr. Willis was
45 years old, married with-

805
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,580
- No, Kenny, wait a minute, wait, wait.

806
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,430
Have you seen this?

807
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,260
- What?

808
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,440
- In other news, gun fire
rang through the streets

809
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,530
of Los Angeles again today.

810
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,700
- No, no, wait, not this.

811
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,440
There was another story about Mr. Willis.

812
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,580
He was murdered.

813
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,410
- Mr. Willis?

814
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,250
- The man who helped us on
the road, they found his body.

815
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,470
- [Reporter] Recent gang shooting-

816
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,640
- My god, that's awful.

817
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,140
What did they say?

818
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,010
- Kenny, did you have
anything to do with this?

819
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,070
- Mom, I know what you
must be thinking, no!

820
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,990
Listen to me, I told you,

821
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,580
we had nothing else to
do with that, nothing.

822
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,700
(TV reporter speaking faintly)

823
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,770
Mom, come on, I know I've
made some stupid mistakes

824
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,640
in my life but do you really think

825
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,520
I could do something like this, huh?

826
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,360
- [Reporter] At the airport after-

827
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,190
- No.

828
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,720
Somebody else killed that poor man.

829
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,980
We just happened to see him
before it happened, that's all.

830
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,810
Okay?

831
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,300
All right.

832
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,110
- Go get washed up.

833
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,240
- [Reporter] That reported
the drugs in South America-

834
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,330
(people chattering)

835
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,930
- Hi, can I show you to a table?

836
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,820
Is that you?

837
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,580
- Yeah. Hi, Sharon.

838
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,660
- Donna Basely?

839
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,040
- Well, it's Mulroney now.

840
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,130
I finally took the plunge.

841
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,490
- Ah, well, good for you.

842
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,610
- You look great, really.

843
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,460
How do you do it?

844
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,530
- Well, so do you.

845
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,360
- Thanks.

846
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,140
- And as I recall, you
worked for the DA's office.

847
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,640
- Yeah.

848
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,150
- So you didn't just happen in here.

849
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,800
You came in here to
talk to me about Kenny.

850
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,630
- Yeah.

851
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,460
- It's okay.

852
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,290
We can talk.

853
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,460
I'll take a break.

854
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,890
Talk outside, huh?

855
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,720
- Great.

856
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,780
- Be back in 10 minutes.

857
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,850
- I'm a mother too,
Sharon. I have three kids.

858
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,730
I think maybe I understand.

859
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,760
- Well, then you understand

860
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,720
I'm gonna be awfully
careful what I say to you.

861
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,070
- Look, all I want is to find
whoever killed Mark Willis.

862
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,930
- Kenny swears he didn't do it.

863
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,450
- And I'm not saying he did.

864
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,250
Things aren't always what they seem.

865
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,260
If he had nothing to do with it,

866
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,360
then he has nothing to worry about.

867
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,130
- He is on parole.

868
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,010
- I won't bust his parole

869
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,100
if he's not involved with the murder.

870
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,620
- You can't promise that.

871
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,770
- I might be able to.

872
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,390
It all depends on what he knows
and what he's connected to.

873
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:54,620
- You know, I used to
really envy you in school.

874
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,950
- What?

875
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,070
That's a laugh.

876
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,780
I would've given anything

877
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,340
to attract the boys the way you did.

878
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,110
- Oh, right, yeah.

879
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,160
Look where it got me.

880
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,100
- Sharon, if something happened
you can't make it unhappen.

881
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,590
- I will protect my son.

882
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,870
Bye.

883
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,020
Bye bye.

884
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,180
Bobby, could you get in here

885
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,920
and eat dinner with the rest of us, huh?

886
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,070
- [Bobby] I'm watching TV.

887
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,580
I'll eat in here.

888
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,600
- Oh, sorry, Mom.

889
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,920
I'll grab something later.

890
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,760
- All right.

891
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,580
Did you clean the house?

892
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,940
- Yup, everything except Kenny's stuff.

893
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,830
He didn't want me to touch it.

894
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,300
- Okay, don't be too late.

895
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,150
- [Dede] I won't.

896
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,780
- Hey.

897
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,340
What we got here?

898
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,450
Oh, so glad I could come home
for all this home cooking.

899
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,130
- Well, you're running off too, huh?

900
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,830
- Yeah, I told Warren
I'd meet him up at Wes's.

901
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,020
- You know, a woman came to
see me at the diner today.

902
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,940
Girl I went to high school with.

903
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,800
- Is that right?

904
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,640
- Yeah.

905
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,470
- She still look as pretty as you do?

906
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,600
- Smooth-talker.

907
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:27,100
Actually, she worked for the DA's office.

908
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,600
(tense music)

909
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,430
- What did you tell her?

910
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,710
- Nothing.

911
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,250
But I'm worried, sweetheart.

912
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,320
They found Warren's prints
all over Mr. Willis's truck.

913
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,240
- Well, of course, they did, Mom.

914
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,230
We took his truck.

915
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,680
- Would you talk to her?

916
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,320
- I don't know.

917
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,560
Come on, Mom, it's been almost a week.

918
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,490
I don't know what happened to that guy.

919
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,720
I'm sorry that he's dead but I
don't wanna go back to prison

920
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,010
for something that I didn't do.

921
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,510
- [Sharon] Uh-huh.

922
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,710
- Hey, I'm going into town.

923
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,120
You wanna take a ride with me?

924
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,030
- No, thanks. Better
finish up some things here.

925
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,110
- If it makes you feel better,
I'll talk to her, okay?

926
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,550
- Thanks.

927
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,980
- But only if she promises me

928
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,830
that they're not gonna pull my parole

929
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,320
for jacking that guy's truck.

930
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,630
- All right.

931
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,480
- I mean, you know what's
gonna happen there.

932
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,910
I'm gonna help 'em solve their murder

933
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,250
and they're gonna send me back to prison.

934
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,080
That's not fair.

935
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,910
- No.

936
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:55,740
- I love you.

937
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,000
- Love you. Have fun.

938
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,260
(sighs)

939
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,800
(friends chattering)

940
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,700

I grew up here, though.

949
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,860
- Really?

950
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,440
Away at college?

951
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,860

- UCSB.

958
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,350
- So you part of this whole tourist crowd

959
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,020
or would you consider maybe
going out with a boat mechanic?

960
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,110
- Come on, let's go.

961
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,150
- I better catch up with the others

962
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,750
or the boat'll leave without me.

963
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,980
- Well, there's a lot of other boats.

00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,400

(somber music)

967
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,410
Little bit early for a boat ride, Ma.

968
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,130
- Spoke to Donna from the
DA's office this morning

969
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,060
about your parole.

970
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,670
She said she couldn't promise anything

971
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,270
but she would have some
influence with the judge

972
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,340
if it comes to that.

973
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,510
- You think that's good enough?

974
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,350
- I think it would be better

975
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,110
if we tell them everything we know

976
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,900
so they could find the real
killer and leave you alone.

977
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,830
- What are you talking about?

978
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,580
I told you, we got drunk, we
roughed him up a little bit

979
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,180
and we took his truck.

980
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,650
We were all three drunk.

981
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,870
- Mr. Willis was a diabetic.

982
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,510
There wasn't a drop of
alcohol in his system, Kenny.

983
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,850
Tell me the truth.

984
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:22,710
- The truth.

985
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,090
What do you know about the truth?

986
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,590
You wanna help me, believe me.

987
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,090
- Oh, my Kenny, you are lying to me.

988
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,600
- I am not lying to you.

989
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,330
- You're lying.

990
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,680
- No, stop it.

991
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,510
Stop it.

992
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,000
- How do you explain this?

993
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,710
(somber music)

994
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,790
- Where did you get that?

995
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,230
- Didn't do a very good job
of getting rid of it, did you?

996
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,450
- Trying to protect you.

997
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,980
I'm trying to protect you.

998
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,530
- To protect me?

999
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,360
From what?

1000
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,380
- From Warren.

1001
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,310
He killed that man who helped us.

1002
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,140
He started going crazy.

1003
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,910
He was talking crazy and he was...

1004
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,240
And then all of a
sudden, before I knew it,

1005
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,980
he had pulled that guy out of the truck.

1006
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,450
I was so afraid to look.

1007
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,860
I could hear him,

1008
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,990
I could hear that man
begging, "Warren, please."

1009
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,280
And Warren just kept screaming,
and he kept hitting him,

1010
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,620
and hitting him.

1011
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,440
And I was so afraid,

1012
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,570
I couldn't even get out of the
truck and I just sat there,

1013
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,620
scrunched down in the front of the truck.

1014
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,560
But I could hear him.

1015
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:11,280
And Warren came back to the truck

1016
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,830
and he grabbed me by the shirt.

1017
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,840
And that's where I got all
of that blood all over me.

1018
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:24,110
I'm afraid of him.

1019
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,730
I've always been so afraid of him.

1020
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:34,160
He's made me do terrible things.

1021
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,440
He told me that if I said
anything, he was gonna kill me.

1022
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,920
And if I told you and you told anybody,

1023
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,590
he was gonna kill you and Dede and Bobby.

1024
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,830
And that's why I threw the shirt away.

1025
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,410
- Oh, sweetheart.

1026
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,410
- That's why I've been lying to you.

1027
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,030
- Oh, my baby.

1028
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,710
(somber music)

1029
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,670
(sobbing)

1030
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:08,500
Oh, baby.

1031
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,310
(horse neighing)

1032
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,660
- Throw me one of those rags.

1033
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,090
Earth to Sharon.

1034
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,590
Rag?

1035
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,610
- Oh, yeah.

1036
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,730
Sorry, just thinking.

1037
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,870
- I noticed.

1038
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,910
- There you go.

1039
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:53,740
- Thanks.

1040
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,990
- If you stole a loaf of bread

1041
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,980
'cause our kids were starving,

1042
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,280
think that would still
be considered stealing?

1043
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:12,090
- Well, that's high school philosophy.

1044
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,050
Stealing is stealing.

1045
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,060
You can't redefine it for
every new set of circumstances.

1046
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,040
- You don't understand Kenny's life.

1047
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,490
See, just because he's
made a few mistakes,

1048
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,960
he's always the first one they suspect.

1049
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:25,890
- I understand.

1050
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,770
I'll do anything to help, you know that.

1051
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,730
But if Kenny's really innocent,

1052
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,880
he doesn't need our help, does he?

1053
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,850
- DA asked me to go into her office,

1054
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,160
give her some information.

1055
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,810
- You should cooperate with her.

1056
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:45,950
- Oh.

1057
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,850
Oh, yeah, help her build
a case against Kenny.

1058
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,240
- Get Kenny to tell you
what really happened.

1059
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,240
Then we can figure out what to do.

1060
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,490
- Kenny's already told
me what really happened.

1061
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:04,720
Warren did it.

1062
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:10,910
- Sharon, a man was murdered.

1063
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,230
- Warren committed a crime

1064
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,660
and now, Kenny's getting blamed for it.

1065
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,380
- And you really believe that?

1066
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,210
That Kenny was just there,

1067
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:19,330
that he couldn't do anything to stop it?

1068
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,170
- Yes, I believe it.

1069
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,130
Of course, I believe it,
I have to believe it.

1070
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,730
If I don't believe it, who will?

1071
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:41,350
When Danny left me,

1072
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,440
all he left us was a crummy old house

1073
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,520
and a stack full of unpaid bills.

1074
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,170
I sold the house, paid the
bills, moved us up a notch.

1075
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,360
Hasn't been easy, though.

1076
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,960
- Sharon, why'd you call me?

1077
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,770
- What, do I have to have a reason?

1078
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,630
Thought we liked each other?

1079
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,000
- We do.

1080
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,830
We do.

1081
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,440
I just thought maybe it had
something to do with the case.

1082
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,270
- I just,

1083
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,870
show you some pictures of Kenny.

1084
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,700
(laughing)

1085
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,890
Look at that, look at that.

1086
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:23,310
Oh, gosh, that wasn't
easy, especially for Kenny.

1087
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,250
- He was on the wrestling team?

1088
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,920
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, for a while.

1089
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,970
You know the coach said
he was particularly tough

1090
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,470
for a kid his size.

1091
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,350
- You bragging about me again, Ma?

1092
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:34,760
- Hi, sweetie.

1093
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,900
Donna Mulroney, this is my son Kenny.

1094
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,300
Kenny, this is Donna Mulroney.

1095
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,420
- Nice to meet you.

1096
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,630
- It's nice to meet you too.

1097
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,750
Ma, I wanted to talk to
you for a couple seconds

1098
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,480
before I take off again.

1099
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,250
- You know what, I have
to go anyway, really.

1100
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,260
So, thanks for the tea, Sharon

1101
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,810
and we still on for dinner tonight?

1102
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,730
- Sure, yeah, absolutely, my treat.

1103
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,570
- [Donna] Great.

1104
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,140
- [Sharon] Bye bye.

1105
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,090
- Nice meeting you.

1106
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,380
I risked my life to
protect you from Warren

1107
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,110
and you're having a class reunion

1108
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,150
with the district attorney?

1109
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,680
- I didn't say anything.

1110
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,530
Let me tell you something, I
appreciate you protecting me,

1111
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,630
but I'll spend time with whoever I please.

1112
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:25,820
- Stay away from her.

1113
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,220
(breathing deeply)

1114
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,030
- Bill and I always talk
about buying a place

1115
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,010
away from the city in a setting like this.

1116
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,350
You know, getting away from the rat race.

1117
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,300
- So why don't you?

1118
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,640
- Oh, I don't know.

1119
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,140
But it is certainly beautiful here.

1120
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,190
- Things aren't always the way they seem.

1121
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,830
Donna, please leave Kenny alone.

1122
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,460
- You know I can't do that, Sharon.

1123
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,850
I'm gonna have to talk
to him sooner or later.

1124
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,310
- But it was Warren.

1125
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,330
- How do you know that?

1126
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:02,380
- What difference does it make? It's true.

1127
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,770
- Well, then Kenny's an accessory

1128
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,990
and I can only protect him so far.

1129
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,480
On the basis of this alone,
I'm gonna have to take action.

1130
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,530
- But it's not fair

1131
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,130
if he has to be punished
for something Warren did.

1132
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,770
- But he was there.

1133
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:17,180
Don't bury your head in the sand.

1134
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,990
He's an accessory to murder.
It's gonna go hard on him.

1135
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,780
Look, I'll do what I can
but there's no guarantee.

1136
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,180
- You see, this is just
what I was talking about.

1137
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,600
Warren forced Kenny into this

1138
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,290
and then he threatened to kill him

1139
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:33,230
and then he threatened to kill all of us.

1140
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,450
Kenny was only trying to protect us.

1141
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,960
- Well, if that's the truth,

1142
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,710
then we need to find it out
if you wanna help Kenny.

1143
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,070
Do you know where Warren Stubbs is?

1144
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:41,900
- No.

1145
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,140
- Donna, you can't use any of this.

1146
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,220
If you do, Kenny will know I told you.

1147
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,770
- I'm sorry, I have to.

1148
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,920
I don't have to tell anyone
what you said here, not yet.

1149
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,100
But I have every right to pick Stubbs up.

1150
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,840
As well as Kenny.

1151
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,880
(lively music)

1152
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:15,060
(people chattering)

1153
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,830
- Well, well, well, if
it isn't Warren Stubbs

1154
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,780
and his boy Kenny.

1155
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,030
So when'd they let you all out?

1156
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,490
- Don't tell me that was you playing.

1157
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:51,510
- Yeah, I got a new guitar.

1158
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,370
What do you think?

1159
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,730
See, somebody busted
up my guitar in prison.

1160
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,390
Used it for firewood.

1161
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,270
- Nigger music, I never
did much care for it.

1162
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,240
Say did they ever find
out who started that fire?

1163
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,210
- You know damn well who
started that fire, Warren.

1164
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,110
Spent eight months making that guitar.

1165
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,430
Kenny, you're out of jail now.

1166
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,650
You don't have to hang around
with this Neanderthal anymore.

1167
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,590
- Look, don't start any trouble
that you don't wanna finish.

1168
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:20,210
- And I'm real sorry to have
to do this to you, Kenny.

1169
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,400
But I gotta admit, it's
real nice to do it to you.

1170
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,260
Hey, Gordon.

1171
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,030
(punches thudding)

1172
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,680
Get those white Joes off my bar

1173
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,330
and don't be nice about it!

1174
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:34,240
(people murmuring)

1175
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:41,510
Told you I'd take care of 'em.

1176
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,380
Come on.

1177
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:51,470
Tired of dealing with all that, okay?

1178
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,700
Just me and you, baby, 'cause I love you.

1179
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,830
Hey!

1180
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,170
(thuds)
(grunts)

1181
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,400
Run away.

1182
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,970
(thudding)
(grunting)

1183
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,380
(clattering)

1184
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:12,480
(thudding)
(grunting)

1185
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,980
(tense music)

1186
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,930
(Tony coughing)

1187
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:28,760
- That's enough.

1188
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,320
- We're not finished yet.

1189
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,630
- Leave him, Kenny.

1190
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,570
- I said we're not finished yet.

1191
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,090
(coughing)

1192
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:46,750
You see, Tony here has the
wrong idea about some things.

1193
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,550
You see, he blames you for those fires

1194
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,750
that wrecked his guitar.

1195
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,410
It's not fair to blame you for
something that you didn't do.

1196
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,880
Is it, Warren?

1197
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,990
- Oh geez, leave him alone, man.

1198
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,770
- You know what's under here, Warren?

1199
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,440
Tendons.

1200
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,720
- Come on, let's don't
do this, please, man.

1201
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,770
His girlfriend's probably
getting the cops.

1202
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:20,560
- Like little rubber bands.

1203
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,240
You see everybody forgets
about the tendons.

1204
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,460
They always talk about the muscles.

1205
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,500
But muscles can be fixed.

1206
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,670
When you cut the tendons,

1207
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:36,930
you may as well cut the whole hand off.

1208
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,110
It will never play the guitar again.

1209
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,760
- Oh god, no!

1210
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,600
- [Warren] Kenny, come on.

1211
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,680
(bottle shatters)

1212
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,680
- No, no, no. (screaming)

1213
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,440
- Now, that's music.

1214
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,550
(Tony crying)

1215
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,030
- Kenny, that is stupid, man.

1216
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,000
I mean, aren't we in
enough trouble already?

1217
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,510
I mean come on, I busted his
nose, I think that's enough.

1218
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:02,370
- You think?

1219
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,970
You don't have enough brains to think.

1220
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:14,520
I've been thinking for the
both of us since we met.

1221
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,780
- You're crazy, man.

1222
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,660
- We're finished.

1223
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,180
I'm through with you.

1224
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,000
- What're you talking about, Kenny?

1225
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,830
What am I supposed to do?

1226
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,290
- What am I supposed to do?

1227
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,220
(siren wailing)

1228
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,970
- Oh, come on, Kenny.

1229
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,170
- Don't call me.

1230
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,270
Don't think about me.

1231
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,620
Don't say my name.

1232
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,610
- Wait a minute, man.

1233
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,270
- [Kenny] Termite.

1234
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,340
- All right, let's see what you got.

1235
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,640
Let's see if you're rusty.

1236
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,590
(Kenny grunts)

1237
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:20,430
- [Kenny] Aw!

1238
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,840
- [Bobby] Ah, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat!

1239
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,640
- Oh!
- Oh, that is bad!

1240
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,880
That is bad.

1241
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,710
- Look.

1242
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:48,640
(whistling)

1243
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,180
- Ouch!

1244
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,470
- Ooh!

1245
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:52,960
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

1246
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,840
- Oh, can you steal it from me?

1247
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,520
Oh, no, oh, little brother.

1248
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,910
Back, back, back.

1249
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:59,910
(people chattering)

1250
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,010
- [Mark] Hi, honey.

1251
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,070
Sorry I'm late getting back

1252
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,800
but I see you aren't home
from Millie's yet either.

1253
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,390
Reason I'm late, I stopped to
help a couple of young guys

1254
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,460
and their mom near Clayton Ridge.

1255
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,700
Well, I'll see you later.

1256
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,870
- It wasn't me, it was Kenny!

1257
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,180
- [Mark] Bye.

1258
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,010
(recorder beeps)

1259
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,730
- I mean everyone's always
blaming me but hey, he's crazy.

1260
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,790
- I wanna know what
happened to Mark Willis.

1261
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:35,120
- I wanted to rob him.

1262
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,960
I pulled his own gun on him, okay?

1263
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,190
I wanted that truck. Hell, I admit that.

1264
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,610
Yeah, I was gonna let him go.

1265
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,330
But Kenny, no, he had
to go berserk, you know,

1266
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,580
he shoots him and then bashes his head in.

1267
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:48,910
You don't believe me.

1268
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,430
(laughing)

1269
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,670
And then he leaves the truck.

1270
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,600
He didn't even want it.

1271
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,770
I tell you, the guy's psycho!

1272
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,690
Ask Tony Charin, he'll tell you.

1273
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:04,920
He knows the truth about
Kenny now. He'll tell.

1274
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,750
I hit him but it was
Kenny that cut his hand.

1275
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,500
I mean you ask him, he'll tell you.

1276
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,900
- You waiting for an engraved invitation?

1277
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,800
- I don't feel like going to school.

1278
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,150
I think I'll skip today.

1279
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,760
Maybe I can go down to the
boats with you and help you.

1280
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:41,980
We could hang out.

1281
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:46,950
- Get your ass on that bus, now.

1282
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:59,360
What are you looking at me like that for?

1283
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,620
- I'm looking at you any way.

1284
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,500
- Hey, well, I'm sorry if I
scared the hell out of him

1285
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,400
but one of me in this family's enough.

1286
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,150
- I didn't say anything.

1287
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,610
Anyway, I think that you're right.

1288
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,610
Do you want some breakfast or something?

1289
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,790
- You scared of me?

1290
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,620
- No.

1291
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,860
- Dede, I'm like a dog.

1292
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,730
I can smell fear.

1293
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:28,240
- I told you, I'm not afraid of you.

1294
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:37,490
(tense music)

1295
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:42,260
- I know that having a brother
like me has not been easy.

1296
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,890
That's all different now, okay?

1297
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:54,130
Now, I only get on his
case because he's a kid

1298
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,450
and he still has a chance

1299
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:58,550
not to make the same mistakes that I made.

1300
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:02,660
I'm doing it 'cause I love him.

1301
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,850
Just like I love you, hm?

1302
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:11,890
- I know.

1303
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,710
- Hey, Kenny.

1304
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:39,960
Can I talk to you a second?

1305
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,320
(tense music)

1306
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,150
Ken, oh!

1307
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,850
(tires screeching)

1308
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,130
(siren wailing)

1309
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,710
(grunts)

1310
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:07,960
(thudding)

1311
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:12,800
(thudding)

1312
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,820
- I didn't do anything!

1313
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,120
- [Harley] You have the
right to remain silent.

1314
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,650
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1315
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:24,010
in a court of law.

1316
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,400
You also have the right to an attorney.

1317
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,800
If you can't afford one, one
will be provided for you.

1318
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,490
(somber music)

1319
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,450
- So, you believe he's guilty, don't you?

1320
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,580
- It's not up to me.

1321
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:01,940
- Could you just answer my question?

1322
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:04,120
Don't try to protect me or help me.

1323
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,810
- Kenny may not have pulled the trigger

1324
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,490
and he may not have hit
Willis with that tire iron

1325
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,340
but he was there.

1326
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:20,950
God knows what they were like in prison.

1327
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:24,340
- Kenny and Warren were nothing alike.

1328
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,510
I mean Kenny tried to stop Warren.

1329
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:30,000
- Sharon, take the blinders off.

1330
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,120
Stop seeing him as your son
and see him for what he is.

1331
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,170
Your son was involved in a murder.

1332
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:37,650
- Maybe. We don't know that for sure.

1333
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,510
At least I'm not absolutely sure enough

1334
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:46,330
that I can turn my back
on him and walk away.

1335
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,680
He's my firstborn child.

1336
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,690
- Sharon-

1337
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:50,790
- [Sharon] What, don't
you even understand?

1338
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:52,410
- It's what you wanna believe.

1339
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:53,650
- What if it's all true?

1340
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,290
What if Kenny's telling the truth

1341
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,540
and we send him back to prison,

1342
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,940
not because we don't
have a reasonable doubt,

1343
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,460
but because we're not absolutely sure?

1344
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,410
- No, Sharon, you're not sure.

1345
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:11,590
- And you're all playing judge and jury.

1346
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,830
- I wanna be on your side
but being on your side

1347
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:19,630
doesn't mean helping
you hide from the truth.

1348
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,770
- Wait, wait, Ian, where are you going?

1349
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:23,350
- [Ian] I think it'd be
better for both of us

1350
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:24,210
if I went home.

1351
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,720
- Better for both of us?

1352
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,180
Who's hiding from the truth now?

1353
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,800
- I want to stand with you.

1354
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:33,640
But I can't make everything disappear

1355
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,990
just 'cause you want me to.

1356
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,870
There are some things we can't change.

1357
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,100
I love you, Sharon. I wanna be with you.

1358
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:50,940
I wanna help.

1359
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,100
- If you're gonna leave, you better go on.

1360
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,220
- Nothing's changed, Skip.

1361
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,050
I don't understand.

1362
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,430
- There's way too much heat on you

1363
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,570
and your family right now.

1364
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:12,110
- It's my brother, it has
nothing to do with me.

1365
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,780
- Sorry, Dede, it's nothing personal.

1366
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,410
My parents, you understand?

1367
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,140
See you later.

1368
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:54,700
- [Donna] Hi.

1369
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,830
- Hi.

1370
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:01,150
- Do you feel like taking a ride?

1371
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:01,980
- No.

1372
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:04,620
I don't wanna go.

1373
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:11,850
- I think you should.

1374
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,060
This is where it happened.

1375
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,120
And those are from the crime scene.

1376
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,610
I want you to look at them.

1377
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,620
You're gonna hear it all in court, Sharon.

1378
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:51,870
I'm just trying to help you.

1379
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,420
(tense music)

1380
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,340
- You're trying to use me
to put my son on death row.

1381
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,250
- If you really believe that,
I'll take you home right now.

1382
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,520
Warren must've found Willis's gun.

1383
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:47,510
.38 Special.

1384
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:50,220
Kept under the seat for protection.

1385
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:56,360
After they left you, they drove around,

1386
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,360
eventually, ending up here as
the morning sun was coming up.

1387
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,540
Can't really say when the beatings began

1388
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,130
but we know he was worked over pretty good

1389
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,340
before arriving here.

1390
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,760
There was a lot of blood in the car.

1391
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,260
(tense music)

1392
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:20,210
He was chased down like an animal

1393
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:21,840
before he was shot in the leg-

1394
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,670
(gunshot bangs)

1395
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:25,960
just to bring him down, so
the game could continue.

1396
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,570
Then somebody hit him with a tire iron.

1397
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,400
Not just once.

1398
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,940
Over and over and over.

1399
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,110
It's almost as if the fear
and the pain kept him alive.

1400
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,050
The coroner said it took him
almost 10 minutes to die.

1401
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,760
- Think his wife would see me?

1402
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,730
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.

1403
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,590
- I don't know.

1404
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:08,440
I can ask her.

1405
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,070
I'll take you.

1406
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:15,470
- I need to go alone.

1407
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,900
Would you get me out of here?

1408
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,180
- If you don't like the coffee cake,

1409
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,560
we have lots of cookies.

1410
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,940
I've been baking a lot lately.

1411
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:50,770
I don't know why.

1412
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,990
Everyone that comes over brings something.

1413
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,720
Guess I just like the smell
of baking in the house.

1414
01:14:58,970 --> 01:14:59,800
Do you bake?

1415
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:01,630
- Not much.

1416
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,490
- You're staring at me.

1417
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:15,950
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1418
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,520
- That's okay, I know why.

1419
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,470
That woman from the
DA's office was shocked

1420
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:24,820
I agreed to this meeting.

1421
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,020
- Mrs. Willis, I'd like to tell you

1422
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,430
that I'm really very grateful

1423
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,220
that you did agree to meet with me.

1424
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:41,000
- Mark used to sit here for
hours listening to his CDs.

1425
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,580
He loved music.

1426
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,310
It's funny, it's what I
can't get used to, the quiet.

1427
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,930
It's all we ever wanted, peace and quiet.

1428
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,650
We came up here for quiet.

1429
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:58,480
Now, I can't stand it.

1430
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,930
- You know, all I wanted
to do was come up here

1431
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,090
and tell you how sorry I am.

1432
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,110
(somber music)

1433
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,460
Well, now I'm here and I can't
find the words to express.

1434
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,170
Kenny-

1435
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:33,560
- Please, don't talk about him.

1436
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,630
I'm glad that you came

1437
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:40,100
and I can see that Mark's
death has hurt you too.

1438
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,300
But please don't mention your son.

1439
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:47,580
I don't think I could stand that.

1440
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,960
(phone ringing)

1441
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,280
Excuse me.

1442
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,470
Hello?

1443
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:03,510
Oh, hi, Stan.

1444
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,880
Yes, yes, I know.

1445
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,370
Thank you so much for calling.

1446
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:12,140
No, I'm holding up.

1447
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,570
You know how much he
enjoyed those fishing trips

1448
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:17,860
together with you.

1449
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:22,930
He was always bragging
about those big trout.

1450
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,160
(phone ringing)

1451
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:39,530
- Yeah?

1452
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,290
- Sorry to bother you.

1453
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:46,520
I had no idea you'd be working so late.

1454
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:52,830
I guess we both know
what's keeping you so busy.

1455
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,860
- What's the matter, Sharon?

1456
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,790
- He's going to prison for the
rest of his life, isn't he?

1457
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:03,370
Feel like my whole world's falling apart.

1458
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:04,890
- Stay right there, I'll be right over.

1459
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,220
- No, no.

1460
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,180
You don't have to do that.

1461
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,280
- No, I want to, okay?

1462
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,270
Just stay put, all right?

1463
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:14,340
Oh, and could you put on a pot of coffee?

1464
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:15,170
Thanks.

1465
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,040
You want a cup?

1466
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:23,870
- Yeah, might as well.

1467
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,780
Gonna be up all night anyway.

1468
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:36,310
God, I must be a lousy mother.

1469
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:37,140
- That's crap.

1470
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,110
You loved your kids, you
did the best you knew how.

1471
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:43,070
- Hey, look, don't patronize me, okay?

1472
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:46,410
This is the second time
my son's been in prison.

1473
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,650
What does that say about me?

1474
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:55,340
What does it say about me as a mom?

1475
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:05,050
What didn't I give him as a mother?

1476
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,050
- Let me tell you something.

1477
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,150
I see a lot of parents with
troubled kids in my work.

1478
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,130
It isn't always the parents' fault.

1479
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:19,020
- Well, if that's true about Kenny,

1480
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,050
I wanna know where the
hell I was all those years!

1481
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:32,920
- Go talk to him, Sharon.

1482
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,170
And look at him when he talks to you.

1483
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,000
Really look.

1484
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,520
You'll know if you want to know

1485
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,420
whether or not he's telling the truth.

1486
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,740
(sighs)

1487
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:54,720
- What did you think
was gonna happen to me?

1488
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,830
I'm in prison again.

1489
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,020
What did you think was gonna happen to me?

1490
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:58,850
- [Sharon] Kenny.

1491
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:00,470
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1492
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,560
And don't tell Bobby.

1493
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,600
He's already freaking out about it.

1494
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,320
- Have you talked to your lawyer?

1495
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,940
Do you like him?

1496
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:16,540
- Her, since we couldn't
cough up enough cash,

1497
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:20,070
I get the best public
defender money couldn't buy.

1498
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,180
- I'll borrow money then.

1499
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:23,210
I'll get a better lawyer. Ian will help.

1500
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,680
- He hasn't left you yet

1501
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,740
since he found out you
have such a rotten kid?

1502
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,590
- [Sharon] Kenny.

1503
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:32,000
- Hey, don't worry.

1504
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,100
You know what a good job

1505
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,480
the public defender did
for me the last time.

1506
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,370
I mean, heck, this broad
passed her bar exam

1507
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,200
on the fourth try.

1508
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,460
What do I got to worry about?

1509
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:47,560
- All right, Kenny, Kenny, come here.

1510
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:53,530
Kenny, come here, come here.

1511
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,640
You have to tell me
everything that happened.

1512
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:04,510
Maybe we can prove that Warren did it all.

1513
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:06,310
You had nothing to do with it.

1514
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,110
You were just there.

1515
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:12,170
- You expect people to believe me?

1516
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:14,260
- I expect them to believe me.

1517
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,550
- Good luck.

1518
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,520
- [Sharon] Please.

1519
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,360
- No.

1520
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:23,540
- Kenny, this is the last
time I'm gonna ask you.

1521
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,320
(tense music)

1522
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,760
- Willis had a gun in his truck.

1523
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:39,520
Warren saw it and he took it.

1524
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:43,590
Then he went off to get gas,

1525
01:21:44,810 --> 01:21:48,270
I took a walk up there just to
say thank you and good night.

1526
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:52,320
And Warren was holding that gun on him.

1527
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,040
I got in there just to
try to calm Warren down.

1528
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,360
Sometimes, I can do
that, but not this time.

1529
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,410
He was mad.

1530
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,050
He was real mad.

1531
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,860
He was mad at your boyfriend
for treating him like dirt.

1532
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,500
You didn't know about that, did you?

1533
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,500
Yeah, he did, it's true, I saw him.

1534
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,810
Anyway, Warren was going on

1535
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:32,450
about how much money this guy had

1536
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:36,220
and I figured we were
just gonna take his truck,

1537
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,380
make him walk home.

1538
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:45,850
But as he started to walk
away, Warren shot at him.

1539
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,360
And he just kept on running

1540
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,470
and Warren kept shooting at him.

1541
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,820
But he couldn't kill him.

1542
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,460
So Warren starts to play with him.

1543
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:08,140
There was this little trickle of blood

1544
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,270
coming down from his nose,

1545
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:17,590
and he was saying, "no," and "why?"

1546
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:22,990
And Warren just keeps beating him.

1547
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,460
(melancholic music)

1548
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,230
And then he pulls over
and he gets the tire iron.

1549
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,430
Well, you could see it in his eyes.

1550
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,830
He knew what was coming.

1551
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:44,400
His eyes were so wide open with fear.

1552
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:52,970
Mumbling, babbling some pathetic...

1553
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,090
And Warren smashes his head.

1554
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:05,830
And you could feel his skull
crack again, and again.

1555
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,080
You gotta get me out of here.

1556
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,600
All right, you listen to me.

1557
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,750
You gotta get me out of this.

1558
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,100
This is your fault.

1559
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,340
It was your fault that I was
set up in the first place.

1560
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,770
Mom!

1561
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:41,600
Where you?

1562
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:44,770
Where the hell are you going?

1563
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:45,600
Mom!

1564
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,860
(somber music)

1565
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,910
(sighs)

1566
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:19,500
Hey, Mom.

1567
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,000
Are you back so soon?

1568
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,670
What, you want me to tell
you the story all over again?

1569
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:28,320
How many times you gotta hear it?

1570
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:31,200
When are you just gonna believe me?

1571
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,030
You're my mother.

1572
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:34,050
You're supposed to believe me.

1573
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,090
What the hell?

1574
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:37,720
(gunshot bangs)

1575
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,640
(breathing deeply)

1576
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:44,740
- [Dede] Mom?

1577
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,760
What are you doing?

1578
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,480
Did you sleep out here all night?

1579
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:52,070
- Yeah, I guess I must've dosed off.

1580
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:53,060
What time is it?

1581
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:55,250
- Like seven.

1582
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:01,090
- Hey, Dede, Dede, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1583
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,390
Where you going?

1584
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,090
- To study.

1585
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:10,110
- You think maybe you could
stay around here, you know,

1586
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:14,250
have your friends come over here to study?

1587
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:18,200
- I don't have friends anymore.

1588
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,190
(somber music)

1589
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:23,530
- What're you talking about?

1590
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,470
- You think you're the only
one that's having a hard time?

1591
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:32,300
Did you ever think

1592
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,360
that maybe I might be
having a hard time too?

1593
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:37,700
Oh, don't worry about Dede

1594
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,420
just so long as Bobby's
fed and the laundry's done.

1595
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,280
- Dede, sweetie, I'm sorry, I didn't.

1596
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:48,300
- I'm all grown up now

1597
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,180
and I don't ever remember
being a kid, you know?

1598
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,130
Do you ever think about that?

1599
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,520
I didn't think so.

1600
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:06,170
- Dede, I'm sorry.

1601
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:25,060
- You came to see me?

1602
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:28,460
- No, I was just passing by

1603
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,410
and I stopped to sit down for a minute.

1604
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,220
- Sharon, I've been
watching you from my window.

1605
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,220
You came to see me. Why?

1606
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,080
- It was nothing.

1607
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:43,880
- You didn't come all the
way down here for nothing.

1608
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:48,970
- I made a mistake, I gotta go.

1609
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:53,090
- Hey, hey, I know you
saw Kenny yesterday.

1610
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,920
You know something.

1611
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,620
- I can't talk to you about this.

1612
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,090
- He did it, didn't he?

1613
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:00,440
Kenny killed Mark Willis.

1614
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,270
- No.

1615
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:03,220
- Sharon, I've never lied to you

1616
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,390
and you've never lied to me.

1617
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:06,090
Don't start now.

1618
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:07,400
He murdered that man.

1619
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,020
Kenny, not Warren.

1620
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:09,850
- No.

1621
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:12,430
- He made Connie Willis a
widow, he destroyed those lives.

1622
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,810
It was him, wasn't it?

1623
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:14,640
- No!

1624
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:21,220
Oh, god.

1625
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,960
I brought a monster into the world.

1626
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:34,210
- Sharon, people like
Kenny don't just happen.

1627
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:36,950
He's beyond what a mother can do.

1628
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:38,350
- I could've done something.

1629
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:40,040
- No.

1630
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,700
- Donna, what do I do now?

1631
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,640
- You have to testify.

1632
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,210
- No, I can't.

1633
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:51,460
No matter what he's done.

1634
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:57,170
I have to protect him, I'm his mother.

1635
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:05,550
- You know where to find me.

1636
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,840
(somber music)

1637
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,800
(sobbing)

1638
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,250
- God, no.

1639
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:40,660
No!

1640
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,310
No!

1641
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,760
- [Donna] Your Honor, the
state calls Sharon Carlson.

1642
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:01,270
- [Bailiff] Do you
swear to tell the truth,

1643
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:04,250
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1644
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:06,110
- Your Honor, I'd like
permission to treat this witness

1645
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:07,620
as a hostile witness.

1646
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,600
Ms. Carlson, I will
spare you the difficulty

1647
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,750
of repeating the events
of the night in question.

1648
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:14,830
It's already been
established that your son

1649
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:18,080
and Warren Stubbs were
present at the time of death.

1650
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,480
I'm only gonna ask you one question.

1651
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,770
Do you know which one killed Mark Willis?

1652
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,200
- Ms. Carlson.

1653
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,330
- I remind you of a
conversation you and I had

1654
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:34,160
three days ago in the
courtyard of this building.

1655
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,760
Do you recall that conversation?

1656
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:37,930
- Yes.

1657
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:41,470
- Look at your son, Ms. Carlson.

1658
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:45,700
- I can't.

1659
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:46,530
- Why not?

1660
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:49,170
Is it because you know
he killed Mark Willis?

1661
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:52,350
Is it because you know he shot Mark Willis

1662
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:53,520
and when that wasn't enough,

1663
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,370
took a tire iron and beat him to death?

1664
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,100
Ms. Carlson, under oath,

1665
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,290
do you know whether or not
your son killed Mark Willis?

1666
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,120
- Yes.

1667
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,110
- And how do you know that?

1668
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,640
- Because I found a shirt.

1669
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:13,230
It was a plaid shirt he
had it on that night.

1670
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:16,200
And it was covered with blood.

1671
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:22,060
He told me he was nowhere near the murder.

1672
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,720
He told me he was frightened

1673
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,680
and he hid so that
Warren couldn't hear him.

1674
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:29,880
And that the blood got on his
shirt from Warren's hands.

1675
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,800
I knew that couldn't
have been true because,

1676
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:43,650
well, I guess I just waited
too long to believe it.

1677
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:54,930
I waited too long to listen.

1678
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:58,270
- Is that why you can't look at him?

1679
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:04,590
- I can't look at him because
when I do, I don't see my son.

1680
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,890
(somber music)

1681
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,680
- Your Honor, at this time,

1682
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,500
the prosecution requests a recess

1683
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,170
so that we can obtain
the evidence in question

1684
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:19,860
and have it fully examined.

1685
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:22,530
- Thank you.

1686
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,480
(melancholic music)

1687
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:33,080
Hey, Dede.

1688
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:39,470
Well, you try some.

1689
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,610
Dede, you want?

1690
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,200
(knocking on door)

1691
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,850
- Is there enough for one more?

1692
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,020
- If it's you.

1693
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:09,910
- No, no.

1694
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:12,310
I'll get it.

1695
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:56,410
(melancholic music)

1696
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:53,790
(lively fanfare music)
