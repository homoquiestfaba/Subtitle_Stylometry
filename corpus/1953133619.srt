Why haven't you met him?

339
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,306
So, Doctor, now what
is the next step?

340
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,743
The sooner she settles
back into her life,

341
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,412
her normal routine, the better.

342
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,048
Starting in a week or so,
I'm gonna recommend

343
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,956
that Paige see
a neural psychologist.

344

Okay.

appreciate that,

352
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,277

Paige's doctor say

353
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,903
that she needs to go back
to her normal routine.

354
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,073
Her life with me is
her normal routine.

355
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,344
<font color="#808080">RITA:</font> Yes, but that's a life
she doesn't remember.

She will.

357
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,914
That's what her doctor
just got through saying.

358
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,955
No. What she said was that
maybe Paige will remember.

359
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,184
<font color="#808080">RITA:</font> Now, why not
let her come home

360
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,260

people that she knows?

361
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,420

you're my husband

371

to them in years.

Why would I ever stop
speaking to my family?

374
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,419
It all went down before we met.

375
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,490
And we never talked about it?

376
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,789
No, we did.

377
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,823
So?

378
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,935
For starters, you wanted
to move into the city

379
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,299
and go to the Art Institute.

380
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,366
And your father insisted
that you stay in law school.

381
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,937
He had some pretty strict views

382
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,136
on what you ought to be doing.

383
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,438
Things just
spiraled from there.

384
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,844
Okay. Look, what I remember
is being in law school

385
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,717
and being engaged to Jeremy.

is to go back

Mmm. I feel fine.

1013
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:52,873
Yeah? No dizziness,
disorientation, sleepiness?

1014
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,812
Nope.
Great.

1015
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,579
Well, I'm very happy, and

1018
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,556
So, your memory recall,
anything?

1019
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,920
Not really.

1020
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,254
No, huh?

1021
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,226
That's not normal, is it?

1022
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,423
Listen, when it comes to the
brain, nothing is normal,

1023
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,659
because no two brain
injuries are the same.

Mrs. Thornton, could I just talk to
Paige alone for a moment, please?

1027
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,774
It's okay, Mom.
I'm... I'm good.

1028
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,047
All right.

1029
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,947
Thanks.

1030
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,230
Paige, do you want
to regain your memory?

1031
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,423
Yes.

1032
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,726
Because some patients fear

1033
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,061
that when their memory
comes back,

1034
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,533
so will the memory
of the trauma,

1035
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,933
but mercifully
that's rarely the case.

1036
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,198
Oh, no, that's not it.
I'm... I'm...

1037
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,240
I'm not afraid of the accident.

1038
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,532
So, what are you afraid of?

1039
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,714
I guess I just...
I don't know. It's...

1040
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,882
I mean, what if I don't
like the life that I had?

1041
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,547
Or what if I like it too much?

1042
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,919
I...

1043
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,890
I just don't know.

1044
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,124
I only did one psych rotation,

1045
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,322
so this may be terrible advice.

1046
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,394
But I think you have to
try and fill the holes.

1047
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,635
You can still decide
you want a different life,

1048
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,728
but if you don't at least

1049
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,240
open yourself up
to remembering,

1050
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,904
I'm afraid you're gonna live
in fear of your own past.

He says when
his fingers tingle,

that's how he knows that he's
creating something genius.

so amped up playing

1348
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,015
Look, I know she didn't have
health insurance because

1349
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,114
you chose to live
in a certain way,

1350
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,124
and I know you must
be drowning in debt.

1351
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,788
But I also know
away out of this.

1352
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,022
What's that?

1353
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:02,658
Divorce her.

1354

only just begun, Leo.

1355
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,534
Mr. Thornton, I don't think
this is the time

1356
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:12,305
or the place to discuss this.

1357
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,371
Fine. If you don't care
about losing your business,

1358
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,178
which, clearly, you don't,

1359
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,412
what about Paige?

1360
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,146
What about doing
what is obviously

1361
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:22,483
the right thing for her?

1362
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:23,682
And you know
what's right for her?

1363
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,815
As a matter of fact, I do.

1364

1368

together with Paige?

I'm not the odd man out.

01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,629
All right.

She goes and has
this life without you,

with some guy that no one gets.

1382
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,373
And now you get to

Okay.

1389
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,290
She told me that
when she was with you,

1390
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,627
she would wake up
at night in a panic,

1391
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,168
thinking,
"Is this all there is?"

1392
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:44,960
Wow.

1393
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,333
She told you everything, huh?

1394
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,498
Mmm-hmm.

1395
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,006
Did she tell you
that she threw herself

1396
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,167
at me the other day?

1397
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,142
Did she tell you that?

1398
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,271
Or did she stop
telling you everything

1399
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,940

who the hell you were?

1400

Look, I get why
you're being such a dick.

1401

and you think you're
gonna get her back.

1403
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:07,116

Yes, as usual!

1519
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:09,728
He cheated on you
with my friend!

1520
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:13,168
How could you stay with him?

1521
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:15,667
I...

1522
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,338
I was going to leave.

1523
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,675
I was.
I was all ready to leave.

1524
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:29,685
And then one afternoon, I
was all alone in the house,

1525
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:35,252
and I started looking at
all the photographs of you

1526
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,588
and your...

1527
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,530
And your sister.

1528
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:46,694
And the house seemed
so full of all of us.

1529
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,137
We were a family, Paige.

1530
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:55,408
And I realized
in that moment that

1531
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:59,745
that was the most important
thing in the world for me.

1532
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,985
And I couldn't, I couldn't,

1533
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:06,282
I could not go.

1534
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,957
So, you just WASPed it away?

1535
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:12,556
No.

1536
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:16,935
I chose to stay with him

1537
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:21,232
for all the things
that he had done right

1538
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:26,902
and not to leave him for the one
thing that he had done wrong.

1539
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:32,442
I chose to forgive him.
