1
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,666
I asked you for your guidance.

2
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,708
I asked you for your love

3
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,809
and comfort, I am here as your child

4
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,208
asking you for mercey.

5
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,250
Shine on my path.

6
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,958
Shine on this day.

7
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,083
I continued to humble myself and

8
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:58,125
and asked you to shine on those times
that I’ve been toxic.

9
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,208
Shine on those times
that I’ve been toxic.

10
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,166
Shine on those times
that I’ve been toxic.

11
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,541
I am a new man.

12
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,291
In Jesus name.

13
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,666
Amen.

14
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,708
[door opens]

15
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:43,958
[door closing]

16
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,541
Hello?

17
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,101
You're a murderer

18
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,018
Jeffrey

19
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,101
who takes lives.

20
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,000
You don't create them.

21
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,750
How did I get here?

22
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,125
I don't remember walking in here.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,500
You go and fuck my best friend
Billy and start your whole new life.

24
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,750
And I have nothing.

25
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,976
Still blaming everyone else

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,875
for your own shit.

27
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,458
I get what I like.

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,375
And I like your wife.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,916
Going to do something about it, Jeffrey?

30
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,351
I am the one who is responsible

31
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,875
for your wife's adultery.

32
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,375
[laughing]

33
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,101
I'm married to a man

34
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,875
that makes me happier than you ever could.

35
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:52,977
You're going to do something

36
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,625
about a little bird?

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,875
A kiss that I love dearly.

38
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,333
I don't want to
someone like you around my kids.

39
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,416
I ended all those lives to keep me.

40
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,666
To be true to who I am.

41
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,166
You took everything from me.

42
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,583
[laying down]

43
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,041
Your mind is glitching.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,416
Your mind is glitching.

45
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,791
Your mind is glitching.

46
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,583
[apple bite]

47
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,500
[chewing]

48
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,017
[apple bite]

49
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,083
[chewing]

50
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,541
Hey, Ricardo.

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,351
Didn't you say you were going to be here
at three?

52
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm here.

53
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,767
No, I'm not paying extra
because your system

54
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,666
no show.

55
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,916
What? No, that's kinda disrescpectful.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

57
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,102
All right.

58
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:27,625
Well, I'll see you at three.

59
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,833
Okay. Bye.

60
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,375
Jeffrey?

61
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,041
Jeffrey?

62
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,625
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,625
How'd you get in?

64
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,000
The door was open.

65
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,916
But you're not supposed to be here.

66
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,352
Jeffrey.

67
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:01,226
You're not supposed to be here.

68
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,625
I came to see you.

69
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,602
Okay.

70
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,333
I'll call the cops to get you out of here.

71
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,666
Come on.

72
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,083
Are you okay?

73
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,750
You kinda look like
you haven't eaten for a while.

74
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,458
I haven’t.

75
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,125
Okay.

76
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,666
Stay here for.

77
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,500
I'll be right back.

78
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,208
[walking away]

79
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,541
[door opening]

80
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,208
[door closing]

81
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,750
Here you go.

82
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,291
It’s your favorite popcorn.

83
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,416
[eating sound]

84
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,375
Why are you really here?

85
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,000
I just came to see how things were.

86
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,041
Are things the way you expected?

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,601
Not exactly how

88
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,500
I remember it, but.

89
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,208
It’s okay.

90
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:41,833
It’s okay.

91
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,500
Did you expect to see me here?

92
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,351
[eating sound]

93
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,166
What?

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,851
How did you expect to see me here

95
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,625
when I don't live here?

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,916
Because this is our house.

97
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,625
No, Jeffrey, this was our house.

98
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,541
It’s not anymore.

99
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,767
Because you left and you took everything.

100
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,583
So I had to start over.

101
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,458
I took everything?

102
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,750
Yeah.

103
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,500
You're the one who decided to start
your new life with my best friend Billy.

104
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,142
What was I suppose to do there?

105
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,875
Sit here and let my wife get her back
blown up by another man?

106
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,102
Okay.

107
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,726
You don't have to be so vulgar.

108
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,333
You took everything from me.

109
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,642
No.

110
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,392
I did not do that.

111
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,310
This state did that.

112
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:41,166
No, you took my money, my career,

113
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,625
my house, my money, my car.

114
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,458
I live on the streets now.

115
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,750
Okay.

116
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,750
Guess we weren’t a good match then.

117
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,791
You were always too controlling, Jeffrey.

118
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,375
I felt like I couldn't breathe around you.

119
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,977
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,500
It's hard to hear.

121
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,750
You know what?

122
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,291
It's the truth.

123
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,625
And I think that

124
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,875
if you if you learn from this,
if you move on,

125
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,750
the next person
that you'll end up with will

126
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,583
definitely benefit from a changed you.

127
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,750
Do you think somebody would want me?

128
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,625
I don’t know.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,892
Look at me, Penelope.

130
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,017
I'm homeless.

131
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,976
I haven’t taken a shower in weeks.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,351
I'm ugly. I'm dirty.

133
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,291
No, you're not ugly and dirty.

134
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,625
You could definitely
clean up a little bit, but

135
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,601
hey, I married a handsome man,

136
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,392
and now he's

137
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,666
he’s still you.

138
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,375
Okay.

139
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,666
What about you?

140
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,375
Are you happy?

141
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,166
Yeah, I am.

142
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,083
I am happy with Billy.

143
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,291
And my two kids and a dog.

144
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,726
You don't even like dogs.

145
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,791
How do you know?

146
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:20,893
All right.

147
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,226
Well, it was good seeing you, Jeffrey.

148
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,750
Uh, should I walk you out?

149
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,166
Penelope?

150
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,458
Mm?

151
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,416
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,083
I'm sorry for everything.

153
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,083
Why are you just now saying I’m sorry?

154
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,250
Because I'm

155
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm alone and I don't have anything.

156
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,250
And I never thought
It would feel like this.

157
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,226
You know, and I wish.

158
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,476
I wish to God I could fix it.

159
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,666
Me too.

160
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,976
You need to see a therapist or something.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,726
Because this is pathetic.

162
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,250
How am I supposed to get help
when I have nothing to get to help with?

163
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,125
Find a solution, Jeffrey.

164
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,351
There's always a solution.

165
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,750
That's easy for you to say
when you're at the top of a hill.

166
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,041
Okay.

167
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,267
It's not always easy.

168
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,226
Thank you very much.

169
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,642
You just have to find.

170
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,976
Think.

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Think of something.

172
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,166
Come.

173
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,541
What are you thinking?

174
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,750
I'm wondering why you don't
ever think about me.

175
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,500
Do you ever think about me?

176
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,500
I mean I do, sometimes.

177
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,976
Like when I have to sing

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,041
one of the songs we
wrote together.

179
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,791
If I see something
that remind me of you.

180
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,666
Why?

181
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,375
Do you think about me?

182
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,476
It's hard to think about anything
with all this

183
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,000
goddamn gardening going on outside.

184
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,833
[laughing]

185
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,166
Okay.

186
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,375
But yeah.

187
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,875
I think about you all the time.

188
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,226
I think about us.

189
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,500
I think about

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,000
the past.

191
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,101
I think about us before I got so evil.

192
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,125
Before got so dark.

193
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,375
And whose fault is it getting so dark?

194
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,017
Why do you think I'm living ike this?

195
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,291
I don't know.

196
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,458
You think I like living like this?

197
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,892
I'm living like this because of you.

198
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,892
Because of the divorce.
You let it ruin me.

199
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,976
Okay, this is what we're doing?

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,101
Yea, this is exactly
what we're doing.

201
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,625
You go and fuck my best friend
Billy and start your whole new life.

202
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,226
And you leave me with nothing.

203
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,625
You forgot the man that you loved,
that you said you loved.

204
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,333
Now I'm not even a shell of the man
I used to be.

205
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,375
Okay.

206
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,226
Still haven't changed much. I see.

207
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,500
Still blaming everyone else
for your own shit.

208
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,208
Yeah.

209
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,375
Yeah.

210
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,602
Yeah.

211
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:38,833
I haven't changed much,
but I guess you did.

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,416
You changed a lot, Penelope.

213
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,416
Into this cold hearted,
rotten bitch.

214
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,333
My heart is as cold as
the ocean flor.

215
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,142
Can you not look at me like that?

216
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,875
You know it's true.

217
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,166
You know.

218
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,976
I never asked you something
I always wanted to ask you.

219
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,851
So.

220
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,541
Now seems like a good time.

221
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay?

222
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,250
Why are you the way you are?

223
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,477
What?

224
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:19,517
Like

225
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,500
cold.

226
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,000
Hearthless.

227
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,291
Like

228
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,041
Like

229
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,142
a deserted radiation

230
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:31,000
nuclear facility in the coldest
parts of Russia in the winter. Why?

231
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,750
What, something happened
to you as a kid?

232
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,875
You saw something growing up to
traumatize you, what happened?

233
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,767
Do you really want to know?

234
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,625
Yeah.

235
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,166
Kind of.

236
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,184
It's kind of hard for the
soul to listen to.

237
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,833
I want, I really want to know.

238
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:00,750
Okay.

239
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,375
Well.

240
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,500
When I was a child.

241
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,208
I was touched

242
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,875
by

243
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,500
M ultiple

244
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,375
men in my family.

245
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,250
My parents both knew.

246
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,977
And I thought that

247
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:33,250
they would just let it go
on forever.

248
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,708
Until one day they died,
both of them

249
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,375
in a car crash.

250
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,267
So, it was just my sister

251
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,916
and I left and.

252
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,268
We were very close.

253
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,875
We were best friends.

254
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,434
Well, we were both,

255
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,125
we were both touched by

256
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,166
these males.

257
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,375
And then one day,
my sister died of cancer.

258
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,000
So it's just me.

259
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,500
It's just me alone.

260
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,250
And I think after that

261
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,000
probably just shut off, I guess.

262
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,101
I mean the touching, I don't,
I don't care anymore.

263
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,875
I didn't feel anything.

264
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,476
And I didn't feel happy.

265
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,125
Basically, I didn't feel any emotion.

266
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,166
But of course you remember.

267
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,791
Cause you never really make me happy

268
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,375
and satisfied me.

269
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,375
Do you remember when we first met?

270
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,291
Really?

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,250
Do you remember?

272
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,666
Of course.

273
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,041
I was burying a man alive.

274
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,541
And you pretended to think it was fake.

275
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,000
And instead of leaving,
you stood there and you took pictures.

276
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,750
You are sick and twisted, Penelope.

277
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,541
No. You get off on the pain of others.

278
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,375
No, I don't get all on it.

279
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,041
I just fascinated is all.

280
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,892
I’m seriously.

281
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,726
I'm fascinated when a man
like you can act

282
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,916
like a zoo animal.

283
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,351
You're a monster.

284
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,791
Oh. And what does that make you?

285
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,791
Because I was young and stupid,
but I'm more mature now.

286
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,976
Are you? Yes.

287
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,041
I think you're still the same rotten
Penelope

288
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,208
that you were as a little girl.

289
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,208
I was rotten

290
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,018
because I wanted

291
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:05,916
to see a man bury another
man alive? Yes.

292
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,708
See, some bad habits die hard.

293
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,017
And some bad habits don't
die until we die

294
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,041
with them.

295
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,416
[laughing]

296
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,333
You sound like a crazy homeless person
right now.

297
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,166
Why are you here?

298
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,041
Because I have to
renovate the property.

299
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,851
I'm going to sell it.

300
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:32,750
Why?

301
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,310
Because I need the money.

302
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:35,708
Bullshit.

303
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,392
You took all my money.

304
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,642
You don't need any more money.

305
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,666
Why are you really here?

306
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,517
I came here for closure.

307
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,851
Okay?

308
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,476
You came here for closure?

309
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,934
You mean to hide your secrets?

310
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,809
Is that so bad? Yes.

311
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,833
That just means
you can't handle the truth.

312
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,708
And what is the truth?

313
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,083
The truth is,

314
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,560
we're both fucked up

315
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,750
people were damaged past.

316
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,684
We are both fucked up people?

317
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,750
Yeah.

318
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,458
Okay.

319
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,875
Interesting timing in saying that.

320
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,083
I want to know what happened to you.

321
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,958
What made you into this,
Jeffrey, that you are?

322
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,750
That kills other people.

323
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,291
Mm?

324
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I don't know.

325
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,166
No, you do know.

326
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,833
You're just been denying
it for so long.

327
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,500
Tell me Jefrey.

328
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,541
Tell me, what led you to be this man?

329
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,726
Uh. When I was a little kid,

330
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,833
like a teenager.

331
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,458
I went to this, um, to this camp

332
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,625
for three summers,

333
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,458
and they made me do, uh,

334
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,458
they made me do some bad stuff.

335
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,375
What bad stuff?

336
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,375
Like killing type stuff.

337
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,125
No, more specific.

338
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,291
Am

339
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,625
I went to this camp and

340
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,559
they had these people in boxes.

341
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:42,208
I couldn't really speak English
or whatever language they were speaking.

342
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,666
Uh.

343
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,708
The camp counselors gave us

344
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,625
machetes

345
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,625
and bone saws

346
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,125
and told us to cut them up.

347
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:04,434
I used to use to start with their heads

348
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,208
because I felt that that would be

349
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,250
more humane.

350
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,851
So it gets it gets worse.

351
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,333
And they would.

352
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,434
They would make us touch

353
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,000
the dead bodies
and take pictures with them.

354
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,726
And then they said that

355
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,101
if we said anything,
they would kill our parents,

356
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,041
just like those people in the boxes.

357
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,476
Did you ever tell anyone?

358
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,375
I'm telling you now.

359
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,708
Besides,

360
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,250
no one needs to know
what's saved up in here.

361
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,208
You know, that’s why I think.

362
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,833
You know, that's why
I think we belong together,

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,601
because we grew up the same.

364
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,559
We have similar upbringings.

365
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,750
Okay, that's where you
were very wrong.

366
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,767
What do you mean?

367
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,833
We're not similar.

368
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,708
You don't think so?

369
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,083
Jeff?

370
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,434
I'm married to a man.

371
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,333
That makes me happier
than you ever could.

372
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,458
I have kids that I love dearly.

373
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,416
I don't want someone
like you around my kids.

374
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,333
So it's the kids, is it? Yes.

375
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,208
You're just hiding behind them.

376
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,809
No, no, you just.

377
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,333
You're just using them to hide
behind them.

378
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,101
And sooner or later,
you'll come out and be rotten

379
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,250
Penelope, again.

380
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,625
Have you ever killed anyone?

381
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,059
What? No.

382
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,833
You know,
I guess we all don't have it in us

383
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,750
Have you ever killed anyone?

384
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,684
How could you just ask me that
when I just told you about how I.

385
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,750
No, no, I meant

386
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,666
while we were married.

387
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:11,708
Yeah.

388
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,333
How many?

389
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:19,934
Eight or nine.

390
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:20,434
I don't.

391
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:20,935
I don't know.

392
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,375
I lost count.

393
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,708
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:28,935
Because I was afraid.

395
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,833
You get upset, you

396
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,625
look at me different.

397
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:37,958
So you ended all those
lives to keep me?

398
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:39,500
No.

399
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,934
No.

400
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,583
I ended all those lives to keep me.

401
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,458
To be true to who I am.

402
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,541
[laughing]

403
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,708
Do you know how absurd
that sounds?

404
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,250
Well, yeah.

405
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,250
Yeah, it's absurd
because we are awful human beings.

406
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,934
Unbelievable.

407
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,351
Because I'm a murderer as fuck.

408
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,601
I think I knew, though.

409
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,351
Deep down.

410
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,434
You leaving late.

411
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,809
Coming home late.

412
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,559
Not showering and so
you could see me.

413
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,458
I can't help the way that I am.

414
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,458
How do you feel right now?

415
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,333
Uh, the popcorn was good.

416
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,434
Other than that, um.

417
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,333
I don't know.

418
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,541
[door knocking]

419
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,708
What time is it?

420
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,227
Oh, shoot.

421
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:37,458
It's already three.

422
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,017
I'll go to the back.

423
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:39,809
No, no, no, no.

424
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,625
Stay here.

425
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:41,642
Are you sure?

426
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,291
Yea.

427
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:42,976
Stay here.

428
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,583
Okay.

429
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:46,809
Oh. Hi.

430
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,708
Hi. Hi.

431
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,809
I'm so sorry I got held up earlier.

432
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,392
No, no. That’s fine. That’s fine.

433
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,166
I have a lot of work to do today.

434
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,125
Um. Can you just come back tomorrow?

435
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,083
I need to be paid today.

436
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:01,977
Can you just wait?

437
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:03,625
I am kinda busy at the moment.

438
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,666
No.

439
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,208
I need the money now to
pay my workers.

440
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:09,875
Okay.

441
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,184
Okay. I'll get my check.

442
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,309
Just hold on for a sec.

443
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:13,833
Yeah.

444
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:27,976
Ricardo.

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,750
Here you go.

446
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,185
Thank you.

447
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:33,333
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

448
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,310
Okay.

449
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:35,583
Have a great day.

450
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,791
[door closing]

451
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,791
[door lock]

452
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,625
Why do you look so bothered?

453
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,541
Because he almost saw me.

454
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:54,458
And?

455
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:58,583
Were going to do something to him?

456
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:00,208
Yeah.

457
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,333
With this.

458
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,476
You were going to hit Ricardo
with a pole?

459
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,208
I was going to bash his
fuckin brains in.

460
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,309
Why?

461
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,583
Because

462
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,958
Because of what?

463
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,250
I wanted to make sure
he doesn't see them all.

464
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,625
I don't want his kids to
see him anymore.

465
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,083
I want to make him dead.

466
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,875
I wanted to end him.

467
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:35,916
Hmm.

468
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:23,666
[the sound of waves]

469
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:55,000
What's wrong with me?

470
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:58,833
It's like I'm stuck in this darkness.

471
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,791
You're not stuck in the darkness.

472
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,559
You are the darkness.

473
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,435
No, I'm not.

474
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,833
Yes, you are.

475
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,226
You killed me.

476
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,559
You killed all those people.

477
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,101
You're a monster.

478
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,333
I'm not a monster.

479
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,375
I'm just.

480
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,625
Lost.

481
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,833
You're lost because you chose to be.

482
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,309
You could have been happy, Jeffrey.

483
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,208
But no.

484
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,684
You chose this life.

485
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:32,477
Darkness.

486
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:34,250
Solitude.

487
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,708
Why is that pole over there?

488
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,726
You were going to use it
to hit me with it, weren't you?

489
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,583
No, no. I would never hurt you.

490
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,708
But you already did.

491
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,541
You took everything from me.

492
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,250
Wait.

493
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,625
How did I get here?

494
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,708
I don't remember walking in here.

495
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,500
And why are you sitting on the bed
like that?

496
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,333
I don't know.

497
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,625
I’m just so lost and alone.

498
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:12,583
Like you.

499
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,375
But you're not alone, though.

500
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,791
You're not a real man, Jeffrey.

501
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,166
You have a pole in your bias,
a killing instrument.

502
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,583
That paul probably belongs
in this house.

503
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:38,892
It was probably a piece of the plumbing.

504
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:39,791
Mhm.

505
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,434
It's important.

506
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,559
It's a small part of a whole.

507
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,750
A small part of the whole.

508
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,601
Which means of what?

509
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:51,208
This house?

510
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,958
A family?

511
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,166
Us?

512
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,333
And what have you done?

513
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,309
What could you have possibly done
to deserve this

514
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,208
life you're living?

515
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,227
Dirty.

516
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:11,017
Alone.

517
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,500
On the streets.

518
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,352
Wait. Are you?

519
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:15,500
What?

520
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,352
Are you amused?

521
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:18,583
Yes.

522
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,583
Why are you upset?

523
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:34,560
I don't know.

524
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:35,726
I just can't seem to.

525
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,083
We don't exist anymore, Jeffrey.

526
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,601
But you loved me?

527
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,476
[laughing]

528
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,208
I never loved you.

529
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,458
I was too busy loving others.

530
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,708
Well, I was carefully observing you.

531
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,958
Watching others.

532
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,184
And that's why I ruined you, Jeffrey.

533
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,309
Because you.

534
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,083
Taught me how to be a ruiner.

535
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,375
You understand that?

536
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:11,875
Yeah.

537
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,958
But, um.

538
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,059
Why are you?

539
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,434
Why are you saying all this? Why?

540
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,666
Why are you talking to me this way?

541
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,958
Because I want.

542
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:24,333
I want.

543
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,583
What's happening?

544
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,250
He's coming for you, Jeffrey.

545
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:37,916
Who?

546
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,416
You know who.

547
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,934
Your tormentor.

548
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,708
The one that's been following you
your whole life.

549
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:50,583
The one that's been fucking you.

550
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,916
[laughing]

551
00:30:58,583 --> 00:30:59,458
Shit.

552
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:07,583
Baby.

553
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,500
Penelope, please put that down.

554
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:16,333
All I need to do is just stick
the screwdriver down my throat

555
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,833
to make you go away.

556
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,583
What's wrong?

557
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,375
Talk to me.

558
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,768
Let me help you.

559
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,458
Get away from me.

560
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,559
Well, you can talk to me about anything.

561
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:23,392
I don't want or need your help Jeffrey.

562
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:25,083
You can’t help yourself.

563
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:26,958
Go.

564
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:28,477
Go right now.

565
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:29,851
Go, please.

566
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,791
Jeffrey, please go.

567
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:33,416
Alright.

568
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:19,666
Closer.

569
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,208
Closer.

570
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,708
Closer.

571
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:38,750
Closer.

572
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,458
Closer.

573
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,708
Closer.

574
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,333
Closer.

575
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:08,125
[laughing]

576
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,083
[laughing]

577
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:47,791
Oh my God.

578
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,083
Jeffrey.

579
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,333
Are you okay?

580
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,333
Yeah.

581
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,916
What just happened?

582
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,166
Uh.

583
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,142
Nothing.

584
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:20,559
I'm here.

585
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,500
I'm okay.

586
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,916
Kind of left me or something else weird?

587
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:32,309
Honestly,
it was like you were in a trance.

588
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,250
Um.

589
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:35,791
I don't know.

590
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,601
I’m not myself.

591
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,309
I had a vision about you.

592
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,625
A vision?

593
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:41,500
Yea.

594
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,208
What happened in the vision?

595
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,333
You were, um...

596
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,208
You're were being mean to me.

597
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,750
And, um...

598
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,851
You were scary.

599
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,559
I was scared of you.

600
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,125
I was trembling.

601
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,416
There is something I need to tell you.

602
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,934
No, no, no, no.

603
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,184
You might want to be
seated for the...

604
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,375
What is it?

605
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,083
I am not who you think I am.

606
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:19,833
What do you mean?

607
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,250
I am not Penelope.

608
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:28,208
Or. No, I mean, I am.

609
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,416
But I am not.

610
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,851
I don't understand.

611
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,601
No, of course you're not understanding.

612
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,250
Sit down.

613
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,833
I need to explain it to you, Jeffrey.

614
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,750
Basically.

615
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,875
I was with

616
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,250
many

617
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:49,375
men.

618
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:51,333
While we were together.

619
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,184
What do you mean by
you were with?

620
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,541
Well, basically, I had many afferas.

621
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:01,958
[laughing]

622
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,083
With who?

623
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,083
That doesn't matter.

624
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,375
Happens so often.

625
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:08,560
I know. I know.

626
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:09,708
I was wrong.

627
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:10,583
But.

628
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,250
I was weak.

629
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,083
I just really, really

630
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,458
wanted to feel all these men

631
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,125
inside of me.

632
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,166
[laughing]

633
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Why are you telling me this?

634
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:28,976
I mean, I just...

635
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,125
I can’t keep living with the secret.

636
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,351
Why are you telling me this now?

637
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,184
Because you're right here.

638
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:39,750
So why should I have to carry
all this guilt on my own?

639
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,101
Why are you telling me this now?

640
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,559
I don't know.

641
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,833
Cause I just want to fucking
tell you the truth.

642
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,809
I can't take this.

643
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:52,477
I need to.

644
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,875
It was always so easy.

645
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,291
What was easy?

646
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,000
Well, they all wanted me.

647
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,060
All of them.

648
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:08,666
They all wanted me.

649
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,958
Hey Jeffrey.

650
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,809
Do you remember all those times

651
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,625
we were trying to have kids?

652
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,041
That’s really trying
to have kids?

653
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,333
But we thought, or you thought.

654
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:27,500
But the doctors had some, I don't know,

655
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,500
conspiratorial rasputin against us.

656
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:35,458
Remember you were telling me
that behind closed doors they would say.

657
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,708
Those two are not fit to be parents.

658
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,583
Those two should definitely
not have kids.

659
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,851
I thought you doctor's
was actually funny.

660
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,017
It was quiet
when they should have been talking.

661
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:51,041
Yea.

662
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,750
Do you want to know why?

663
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:56,185
Yeah.

664
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:57,291
Tell me why.

665
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,976
Because it was me, Jeffrey.

666
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,602
It was me.

667
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:07,059
And the reason,
because I aborted more than, what?

668
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,809
Seven, eight of your children?

669
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,583
[laughing]

670
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:13,976
Penelope.

671
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,583
How could you kill our children?

672
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:16,977
I don't know.

673
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:19,059
But I did. Ha ha.

674
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,059
No.

675
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:20,977
Yes.

676
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,976
And I would do it all over again.

677
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,708
[laughing]

678
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,083
Where do you think you're going?

679
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,333
You know what I think?

680
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,458
What?

681
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:45,583
I think a none of this is real.

682
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,125
I think I'm going out of my mind.

683
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,291
Hey.

684
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:02,310
It's the truth.

685
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,309
I know you don't want to hear it,
but sorry. It's the truth.

686
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,684
How could you do something like that?

687
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:06,435
I don't know.

688
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,958
Because I'm a mean fucking
cunting bitch.

689
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,125
How could you do something like that
and not even think twice, Penelope?

690
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,976
And how could you kill a man
and not think twice?

691
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,708
Stop it.

692
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,726
Murder is not abortion, okay?

693
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,434
You can't compare the two.

694
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:20,500
I didn’t.

695
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,351
Yes, you did.
You just said it was the same.

696
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,934
No?

697
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:27,416
Don't you feel sorry
or bad at all?

698
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,666
Die slowly please.

699
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,041
Good.

700
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:39,476
Did slowly.

701
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,392
I am.

702
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,125
Good.

703
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:47,125
You look so pitiful.

704
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,625
Well, you know, then I guess
that was always

705
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,458
the thing that I found
kind of intriguing about you.

706
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,934
You're a murderer, Jeffrey.

707
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,059
Who takes lives.

708
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,500
You don't create them.

709
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,833
Of course.

710
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,875
Now, Billy and I.

711
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:12,833
We have two kids.

712
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,625
And we're so happy.

713
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,875
But I think I'm even happier

714
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,333
rendering you fatherless forever.

715
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,041
Don't you have anything to say?

716
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,333
I...

717
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,809
No, I don’t...

718
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:41,791
I don't know what to say.

719
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,291
Good because I don't really want
to hear what you have to say anyway.

720
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,583
Do you remember

721
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,291
the Christmas party at
your workplace?

722
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:57,333
Yeah?

723
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,833
Where you introduce me to Uriah?

724
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,541
Your big dominant boss.

725
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,375
Can I?

726
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,875
Don’t

727
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,708
t ouch her.

728
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,708
Little bro.

729
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:12,684
And I could tell immediately
that he was into me.

730
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:13,726
And you could, too.

731
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,708
That's why you became jealous when it.

732
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:17,560
And I.

733
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:21,208
I pretended not to notice
so that you wouldn't get upset.

734
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,726
So that later

735
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,833
on during that party,
I was at the juice bar

736
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,458
and then he came over.

737
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,125
And he took me back to the
storage closet.

738
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,875
He did some amazing things to me.

739
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,375
Things that you could never do.

740
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:46,309
I was so satisfied

741
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,500
after that Christmas party. Oh.

742
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:54,476
I didn't tell you, Jeffrey, because.

743
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,708
I didn't want you to lose your job
because you could never stand up to him.

744
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:01,185
Because you don't

745
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:04,267
kill the powerful and dominant.

746
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,000
Do you?

747
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,083
You prey on the weak.

748
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,958
Why are you being so?

749
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,017
Why do you want to hear more?

750
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,559
No.

751
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:28,435
No, I don't.

752
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:29,809
Because I have plenty more

753
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,333
where that came from.

754
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,625
Jeffrey.

755
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,500
Look at you.

756
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,958
What's left for me now is just.

757
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,833
To move on.

758
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:52,208
To leave you in the past.

759
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,101
Oh. And I'm

760
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:59,458
sorry that I got to do that
by destroying you.

761
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,625
I think that I am not sorry at all.

762
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,291
Why do you want to destroy me?

763
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,208
Because you deserve it.

764
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,208
You don't deserve a life.

765
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:18,852
Penelope.

766
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:20,809
We could have had children.

767
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:21,375
Ugh.

768
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,976
The thought of having something
that's half me.

769
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,726
Half you. Never.

770
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,059
I could never do it.

771
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,208
Well, never.

772
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:35,602
Okay.

773
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:36,708
We're done here.

774
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:41,685
Shall we leave the past

775
00:45:41,709 --> 00:45:42,958
in the past?

776
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:43,708
Good.

777
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,750
I'm going leave, so.

778
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,708
Oh. Remember the first time?

779
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,851
That you introduced me to Billy.

780
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,976
Your best friend Billy,
at the Super Bowl party

781
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,916
or whatever It was.

782
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,916
When I met him, I walked up to him.

783
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:38,458
And I said.

784
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,041
I want you Billy.

785
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,916
[laughing]

786
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:46,833
[knocking]

787
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:00,767
Hello.

788
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:01,727
Hey.

789
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:03,309
Is everything okay?

790
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,434
We heard the starkins.

791
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:05,583
So?

792
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,583
Oh. Sorry about that.

793
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,250
Uh, we.

794
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:12,458
My wife and I, we live next door.

795
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,559
Oh. Oh. Um.

796
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,851
No. All good here. Just.

797
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,476
My ex-husband had a little bit
too much to drink.

798
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,750
Okay, well, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to call us, okay?

799
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:24,685
Okay.

800
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:25,958
Thank you.

801
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,851
Hey. Hey.

802
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:39,309
Could you come back for a second? Yes.

803
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,833
Are you single?

804
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:43,309
No, not really.

805
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,625
I have a life.

806
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,476
But could you be?

807
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,684
What? Yeah.

808
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,458
I can be, I guess.

809
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,375
Okay. Right.

810
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:57,977
Okay.

811
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,833
Do you have a phone on you?

812
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:03,101
Yeah.

813
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,083
Right here.

814
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:10,166
You look like the funnest fuck.

815
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:11,958
You too.

816
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:14,500
Thank you.

817
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:15,583
You're welcome.

818
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,750
Here you go.

819
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:19,750
Thanks.

820
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,434
I'll call whenever.

821
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:23,958
What about tonight?

822
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:26,684
What about tonight?

823
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:27,500
You know.

824
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,833
Your funnest fuck.

825
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:33,333
You too.

826
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:35,333
See you.

827
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,708
See you later.

828
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,310
Is that what you wanted to do?

829
00:48:45,334 --> 00:48:46,851
Did you want to make me mad?

830
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:47,833
Yes.

831
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,559
You're a killer, Jeffrey.

832
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:51,684
You're a monster.

833
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:52,476
Why would you that?

834
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,291
Scare me.

835
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,541
Hey, man.

836
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:09,416
Hey.

837
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:10,310
How are you?

838
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:11,684
I'm good. How you doing?

839
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,750
Good.

840
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,416
Uriah wants to see you, though.

841
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,875
Any idea why?

842
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,434
Oh. I don't ask questions.

843
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:24,958
I just work here.

844
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,083
Really?

845
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:31,958
Pretty sure.

846
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:36,583
Well, good luck.

847
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:39,250
Hey, Ray.

848
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,309
You wanted to see me?

849
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,875
Hey Jeffrey.

850
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:45,000
Thanks for coming in.

851
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:48,416
Have a sit.

852
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,833
Is, um...

853
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,250
everything okay?

854
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,434
No, not really.

855
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:01,601
I'm afraid
I'm going to have to let you go.

856
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,476
What? Why?

857
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,000
Sorry, man.

858
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:09,041
Company's downsizing,
and we have to let some people go.

859
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,125
Unfortunately, you are
one of those people.

860
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,791
I could write you a good preference
letter and service pace last you a while.

861
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:21,458
Oh. Jeffrey.

862
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:25,583
A woman you brought
to the Christmas party.

863
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,833
She was amazing, I must say.

864
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,375
Wait, what does that mean?

865
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:35,309
That's what that means.

866
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:35,727
You're right.

867
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:37,708
That's my wife you talking about.

868
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:39,375
I know.

869
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,416
I fucked her in the storage closet.

870
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:48,226
And I asked her to come over tonight.

871
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,583
She said yea.

872
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,375
So that's that.

873
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,226
Why the fuck would you do
something like that?

874
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,166
You're going to do something
about it ittle bro?

875
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,791
Are you going to do something
about it, Jeffrey?

876
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,833
I get what I like.

877
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,833
And I like your wife.

878
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:23,375
He fired me.

879
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:40,059
Hey. I'm sorry.

880
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,434
I'm sorry.

881
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:42,375
You know.

882
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:44,810
I was just scared.

883
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:48,833
I didn't want you to lose your job
because of me rejecting him.

884
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,458
You're lying to me
and you're cheating on me.

885
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,559
I would never cheat on you.

886
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,583
He told me he fucked you.

887
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,958
He's obviously lying.

888
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:01,560
He said you were going to his

889
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:02,684
house tonight.

890
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:03,934
Just to cook him dinner.

891
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,375
To cook him dinner?

892
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,875
What about my dinner?

893
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,976
I was just scared, you know, I didn't.

894
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,684
I didn't mean to hurt you.

895
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:13,476
You didn't mean to hurt me? Penelope?

896
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,059
You cheated on me.

897
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,809
It's not true.

898
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,958
Girl.

899
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,434
You better hope
I get my shit together.

900
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:20,958
Baby.

901
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,267
Don't let that man rile you up.

902
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:24,416
It’s too late.

903
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,833
I'm already up.

904
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:28,458
Baby.

905
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:31,958
Don't let any man ruin
what we've got going on here.

906
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,934
I would never betray you.

907
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:37,684
I would never cheat on you.
You know that.

908
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:40,208
There's not a man on the planet
that can make me leave you.

909
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:43,685
You're my man.

910
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:46,309
Okay. Come here.

911
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,142
I love you.

912
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,125
Okay?

913
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:30,750
I’m gonna go.

914
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:41,416
I am gonna leave the in the past,
and I suggest you do the same, okay?

915
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:48,476
Actually, I do need you
to get out of here.

916
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,416
You know, I'm going to renovate, so.

917
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:56,875
Feels like I'm the king or queen.

918
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:01,434
Actually, this must be

919
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:04,101
what Cleopatra felt like.

920
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:07,434
Right before she saw her enemies

921
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,708
heads drop to the floor.

922
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,208
Feels like power.

923
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,208
And you're just a pawn in my game.

924
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,208
Oh, do you hear that fucking
ice cream truck?

925
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,435
What?

926
00:54:31,459 --> 00:54:33,291
Why are you being
this way to me?

927
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,000
Interesting.

928
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:39,083
How the beast can be
brought to his knees

929
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,583
by a divine feminine.

930
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,250
You know, that was always
your downfall, Jeffrey.

931
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:49,500
You couldn't handle a
strong woman God.

932
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,833
I am woman God.

933
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,125
Come now.

934
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:21,083
Wash my feet.

935
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,000
[laughing]

936
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:26,726
I am the one who exists

937
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,333
within your spouse.

938
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:33,500
I come from the spirit of Delilah.

939
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:37,500
I watched Samson
fall at the temple of Daggett.

940
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:42,958
Yes. I am the one

941
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46,625
who is responsible
for your wife's adultery.

942
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:54,750
I have lived with her before she was born,

943
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:59,333
and I want you to tremble.

944
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,833
Oh, that's cold.

945
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:09,500
Oh, come on.

946
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:13,791
Yea.

947
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,791
Yea.

948
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,833
Oh that’s good.

949
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:20,958
Yea.

950
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,559
Sorry to bother you, man.

951
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:47,083
I was in the room with Penelope
and I thought to myself,

952
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:50,208
maybe you can use some company.

953
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:53,476
What the fuck are you doing here?

954
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,333
I'm doing your wife, little bro.

955
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:00,309
Look, everything's going to be okay.

956
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,125
I'm here.

957
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:03,958
We'll get through this together.

958
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,750
You think this is funny?

959
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,416
All the police are going
to come looking for you.

960
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,583
You're definitely going to have to go
missing now.

961
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,250
Oh, yeah, but.

962
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,375
I bet you'd like that.
So you can do whatever you want.

963
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,184
Well, it seems like you have no choice,

964
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:55,333
does it, Jeffrey?

965
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,934
I am.

966
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,500
Woman God.

967
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:08,976
I gotta get out of here.

968
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,083
I gotta get out of here.

969
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:46,958
Can I ask you something?

970
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:48,333
What’s that?

971
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,333
What if I'm not ready to move on?

972
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,875
I already moved on.

973
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,500
What about today?

974
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,601
What if I didn't let you move on today?

975
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,476
What if I stayed in this house
so you couldn't renovated?

976
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,060
Then what?

977
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:09,291
You're not going to do
any of this, Jeffrey.

978
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:15,083
You are going to accept your fate.

979
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,708
And move on.

980
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:21,708
I think.

981
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,851
This whole thing.

982
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:27,000
Is not real.

983
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,958
I think I'm going out of my mind.

984
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,750
Jeffrey, you know why you are here.

985
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:38,041
No.

986
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,875
You have been temporarily disabled.

987
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,125
Your mind is glitching.

988
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,184
Wait.

989
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,208
What?

990
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,958
Your mind is glitching.

991
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:55,333
You've been brought
back to reality temporarily.

992
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:57,685
I don't know.

993
00:59:57,709 --> 01:00:00,059
I don't understand what's happening.

994
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:04,250
Your mind is trying to help you
to deal with the pain.

995
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,000
Don't worry.

996
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,708
You'll be safe here.

997
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:13,809
Who are you?

998
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:15,916
The words for the subject.

999
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,208
What's your name?

1000
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,208
Therapist.

1001
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:27,833
Your name is therapist?

1002
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,208
Actually, I have no name.

1003
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,958
Neither do you.

1004
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:41,208
They may exist in the reality
that you’ve just come from.

1005
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:45,208
But here there are no names.

1006
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:50,541
No.

1007
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,166
Replenishment.

1008
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:54,685
No, thank you.

1009
01:00:54,709 --> 01:00:56,101
I'm not hungry.

1010
01:00:56,125 --> 01:01:00,083
You've been asleep for 369 years.

1011
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:04,500
I assure you, you are hungry and thirsty.

1012
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:07,875
You are hungry and thirsty.

1013
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,416
Y’all motherfuckers are crazy.

1014
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:28,666
What's happening right now?

1015
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,500
How does it feel not to know?

1016
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,583
I don't understand.

1017
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:39,166
It's a simple question.

1018
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,934
What's it like

1019
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:44,875
not to know?

1020
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,458
Okay.

1021
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,958
All right, I get it.

1022
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,851
It's like I'm in the dark.

1023
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,958
Yes.

1024
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,916
Very good, Jeffrey.

1025
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:59,125
It is like being in the dark.

1026
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,184
You're in the dark because

1027
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,958
you don't know what's happening.

1028
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,458
Is it a pleasant feeling?

1029
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:14,833
No. It's quite morbid, actually.

1030
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,500
Morbid?

1031
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,976
What just happened?

1032
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,708
I don't talk like that.

1033
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:26,934
You're talking the way
that you always talk.

1034
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,083
No, I'm not.

1035
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,125
I assure you, you are.

1036
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,559
And how can you be so sure?

1037
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,916
I birthed you.

1038
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,333
What?

1039
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:39,267
I

1040
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:40,875
Birthed you.

1041
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,750
You're a man.

1042
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,958
I'm a what?

1043
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,250
A man.

1044
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:05,125
Yes?

1045
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:08,000
You need to speak.

1046
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,851
In silence.

1047
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:10,583
Okay.

1048
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,000
I see.

1049
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,892
A man is

1050
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:30,833
what is called the gender
in the human race.

1051
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,708
Yes.

1052
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,809
Now I understand the confusion.

1053
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,559
Well, I'm the one that's not confused.

1054
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:42,666
Yes.

1055
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:44,500
Yes what?

1056
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:46,833
You see?

1057
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,416
You are not human.

1058
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:51,833
What?

1059
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:55,291
Humans do not exist.

1060
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,000
Nothing exists.

1061
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:01,833
As of now.

1062
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,750
No, that’s impossible.

1063
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,041
If I'm not a human,
then what am I?

1064
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:09,250
A motherfucker.

1065
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:11,666
What did you say?

1066
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:13,625
A motherfucker.

1067
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:15,000
A motherfucker.

1068
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,125
Do you really want to be aware?

1069
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,083
Yeah.

1070
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:24,750
Yeah.

1071
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:26,375
I think not.

1072
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,291
If I'm not a human, then what am I?

1073
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:34,500
You are a program, Jeffrey.

1074
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,125
You are.

1075
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:41,958
A digital simulation of a human being.

1076
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:47,708
Nah.

1077
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,958
No, I must been
going crazy here.

1078
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,500
I'm flesh and blood.

1079
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,958
Flesh and blood.

1080
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:57,166
Flesh and blood.

1081
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:01,059
Flesh and blood.

1082
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:04,184
Two of the generalized modules
that make up the hallucination

1083
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,583
known as human.

1084
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:14,833
There is no such thing as flesh and blood.

1085
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:18,934
Flesh and blood are biological

1086
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,583
and chemical properties that can be.

1087
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:28,458
You are just a program, Jeffrey.

1088
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:31,684
Okay, I get it.

1089
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:35,083
I think I'm going crazy.
I'm going insane.

1090
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,166
And you better stop lying to him.

1091
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,458
What was that?

1092
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,083
What was what?

1093
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,310
My dream.

1094
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:55,708
What did it mean?

1095
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:58,976
I don't know.

1096
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,125
You tell me.

1097
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,310
Uh oh.

1098
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,708
I wasn't.

1099
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:09,476
I was like,
I was there, but I wasn't real.

1100
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,083
The world wasn't real.

1101
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:15,851
That doesn't sound too bad.

1102
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:17,708
It was horrible.

1103
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,625
It was like I was a.

1104
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:22,726
It was like I was a computer program

1105
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,708
or something.

1106
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:33,333
Wow. I am sorry to break it to you.

1107
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,250
But this is real.

1108
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,833
You are real.

1109
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:42,583
I'm real.

1110
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,875
What I'm doing to you is real.

1111
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:48,934
What are you doing to me?

1112
01:06:48,958 --> 01:06:50,875
I'm destroying you.

1113
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:53,810
You're not destroying me.

1114
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:55,208
Yes, I am.

1115
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:58,583
And I won't stop
until I'm completely done.

1116
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,851
That doesn't make sense.
Why would my wife destroy me?

1117
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:03,833
Ex wife

1118
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:05,083
Right.

1119
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:09,125
Why would my ex-wife
destroy me in a dream?

1120
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:12,250
It's not a dream, Jeffrey.

1121
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,791
It's reality.

1122
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,434
Like I’ve said,

1123
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:20,875
we're flesh and blood.

1124
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,458
We are real.

1125
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,684
You're real.

1126
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:28,375
I am real.

1127
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,500
This is real.

1128
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:36,875
No.

1129
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,458
No.

1130
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:43,458
No.

1131
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,416
This is not real.

1132
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:06,226
Why were you upset when she told you

1133
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,833
about the baby on the beach?

1134
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,083
What the hell are you doing?

1135
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:23,934
I'm so confused.

1136
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:24,958
Don't be.

1137
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:28,976
But none of this is making any sense.

1138
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,833
It doesn't have to make sense Jeffrey.

1139
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,750
I don't understand
what's going on, what's happening?

1140
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:39,583
What difference does it make
if you know what's happening or not?

1141
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,041
Because I hope to try to stop you.

1142
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,708
Stop me from what?

1143
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,375
From moving on.

1144
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:02,166
Remember that one time
when we went to the beach?

1145
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:07,226
It was you and me

1146
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,541
or my cousin Gregory.

1147
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:15,708
He wasn't my cousin Jeffrey.

1148
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:19,101
What are you talking about?

1149
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:20,041
Penelope.

1150
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,208
How's the water?

1151
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:27,333
It looks fantastic.

1152
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,458
He was my lover.

1153
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,083
I was cheating on you with him.

1154
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:46,000
Doesn’t it bother you
how unfaithful I was to you?

1155
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:47,476
Yeah. Yeah. This again?

1156
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,934
Yes, this again.

1157
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:52,083
I told you there was more.

1158
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:56,791
You know that one day on the beach.

1159
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:00,125
I got pregnant.

1160
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:02,559
And it wasn't from you

1161
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:05,708
because you and I hadn't done
anything for months.

1162
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:08,166
No, it was from Gregory.

1163
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,208
But I had a miscarriage.

1164
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:17,208
But I didn't tell you
because I wanted to be more like you.

1165
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:18,351
No.

1166
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:19,352
Yes Jeffrey.

1167
01:10:19,376 --> 01:10:20,500
No.

1168
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:21,916
No.

1169
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,500
This is called destruction.

1170
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:32,208
You're not real, Jeffrey.

1171
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:36,708
None of this is real.

1172
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,958
Are you trying to fuck with
me right now?

1173
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:46,291
No.

1174
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:50,375
We're computer simulations,
Jeffrey.

1175
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:53,250
You're not real. I'm not real.

1176
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,583
But we are.

1177
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,958
You are.

1178
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,434
Because the pain that you feel in this

1179
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:05,041
moment is very real.

1180
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:07,625
Right?

1181
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:08,810
What's this?

1182
01:11:08,834 --> 01:11:10,875
Got something to do with the government
or something?

1183
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:13,708
What?

1184
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:18,416
They all seem like, some freaky MK
ultratype shit or something.

1185
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,875
Oh, my God.

1186
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:25,250
Who? Who?

1187
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:26,976
Who's doing this?

1188
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,309
I have to reveal something.

1189
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:28,958
What?

1190
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,958
We’ve been watched.

1191
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,750
Don’t look up, they will see us.

1192
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,333
Right, they will see us.

1193
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,083
They see us, look down.

1194
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:44,208
By who?

1195
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:47,333
I don’t know.

1196
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,083
But maybe.

1197
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:54,500
Maybe we can find out together.

1198
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:57,833
Together?

1199
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:01,250
[door knocking]

1200
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:16,125
Oh. Hey. Hey.

1201
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,375
Why are you back?

1202
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:22,458
I just wanted to know
when is a good time to visit.

1203
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,958
It’s not been that long
since I tell you

1204
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:31,708
I know, but like you said,
it might be a fun fucking time.

1205
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:34,101
It will be a fun fucking time.

1206
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,333
Yeah.

1207
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:37,791
What's your favorite?

1208
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:38,708
Favorite?

1209
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:39,833
Position.

1210
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,458
With you?

1211
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,333
It would definitely be face to face.

1212
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:50,666
Yeah, that's my favorite.

1213
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:53,041
I’m excited.

1214
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,458
Let's do it.

1215
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,708
Ow! Ow! Oh!

1216
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,541
More.

1217
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:08,750
More.

1218
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:28,809
This is one of the most exciting days

1219
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,083
I've had in years.

1220
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:31,125
Jeffrey, are you done yet?

1221
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,791
[screaming]

1222
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:43,583
What's wrong?

1223
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,833
There's nothing left for me to do.

1224
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:50,809
That's because you've been
doing the same thing

1225
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:54,208
over and over again for so long.

1226
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,684
You need to find something new.

1227
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,458
To challenge you.

1228
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:07,351
I need to get some fresh air.

1229
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:09,375
I need to take a walk.

1230
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:12,291
If you leave,
I won't allow you back inside.

1231
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:15,684
Like I said,

1232
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:17,416
I'm renovating the house.

1233
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,208
I just want to be with you.

1234
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:30,833
I have told you.

1235
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,125
That can’t happen.

1236
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:37,500
Because I'm

1237
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:40,101
I’m happy with Billy.

1238
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:42,583
I'm happy with my two kids.

1239
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,458
I'm happy with my dog.

1240
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:52,083
You know what?

1241
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,208
I can't help how I feel Penelope.

1242
01:14:58,583 --> 01:14:59,708
Okay.

1243
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:02,333
Go and get your fresh air.

1244
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,351
Am I just going insane?

1245
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:45,708
[door knocking]

1246
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,208
Who is it?

1247
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:53,125
[door knocking]

1248
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:08,958
Hey, I want to know
when is a good time to visit?

1249
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:12,684
Uh. Cam? Yes.

1250
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:15,184
I'm Cam. Your neighbor?

1251
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:15,958
Yeah.

1252
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,958
Is any of this real?

1253
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:19,166
Listen me brother.

1254
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,583
Bring it in.

1255
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,958
It might be a fun fucking time.

1256
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,125
Who are you?

1257
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,583
I'm Cam.

1258
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,851
I'm looking for a woman
named Penelope.

1259
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:33,250
I like to fuck her.

1260
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:35,208
Oh, yeah?

1261
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah.

1262
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,458
I heard she's quite amazing,
and I want to explore her parts.

1263
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:41,976
You know, it's my wife you
talking about?

1264
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,184
Yes, I do.

1265
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:45,226
And I'm sorry for your loss.

1266
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,726
What do you.
What do you mean, loss?

1267
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:49,059
She's still here with me.
She's right here.

1268
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:51,476
I don't understand.

1269
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,875
Who is that then?

1270
01:16:58,583 --> 01:16:59,791
Fuck.

1271
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:07,458
[door knocking]

1272
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:08,541
Penelope?

1273
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:09,750
It’s me.

1274
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:15,750
Penelope?

1275
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,684
I know you are in here.

1276
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,291
I think you breathing.

1277
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:24,726
Hey.

1278
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:25,184
Yo

1279
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:25,767
Hey Ricardo

1280
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:26,018
What's up?

1281
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,250
What happened to you?

1282
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:29,750
Man you look like you've
seen a ghost.

1283
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,916
I actually did see a Coast Guard.

1284
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,809
Look, I don't know what you mean by that.

1285
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,958
I just came back to speak with Penelope.

1286
01:17:38,458 --> 01:17:39,750
Penelope?

1287
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:40,976
Yeah.

1288
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,708
She's

1289
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,208
busy right now.

1290
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,333
I need to talk to her,

1291
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,601
and I need to see her.

1292
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:53,809
Uh, is there.

1293
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:55,875
Is everything okay?

1294
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:59,833
She wrote me a check,
and that check bounced.

1295
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:01,185
Oh, she did.

1296
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,976
So I'm looking for a new one yea?

1297
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,559
Oh, come on.

1298
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,684
I'll take care of that for you.
Come on inside.

1299
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:07,375
Come on.

1300
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:10,583
So, what's going on with you people?

1301
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:50,310
You go

1302
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:53,333
and fuck my best friend
Billy and start your whole new life.

1303
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:55,309
And I have nothing.

1304
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:58,500
I'm married to a man
that makes me happier than you ever could.

1305
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:01,833
I have kids that I love dearly.

1306
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:05,309
I don't want someone like you around
my kids.

1307
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:08,708
You're the one who decided to start
your new life with my best friend, Billy.

1308
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,309
What was I supposed to do there?

1309
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:14,083
Sit here and let my wife get her back
blown up by another man.

1310
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,726
He did some amazing
things to me,

1311
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,250
things that you could never do.

1312
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:33,750
Don’t yell

1313
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,958
You all want to wake up the kiddies?

1314
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,060
What are you doing here?

1315
01:21:38,084 --> 01:21:40,059
You know why I'm here.

1316
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:41,375
No, I don't.

1317
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,375
How'd you get in?

1318
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:45,458
I got a key.

1319
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:46,602
How the fuck

1320
01:21:46,626 --> 01:21:48,083
you've got a key?

1321
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,684
Our wife gave me a key.

1322
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:54,000
You know, because you really
like both of us.

1323
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,250
Why are you doing this?

1324
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:23,333
I'm doing this
because I've got to find my way back

1325
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,291
Why did you get so upset when she told you
about the baby at the beach?

1326
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:15,333
Why did you get so upset?
