1
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:04,519
Chester's Mill was like any other town.

2
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:06,354
I love you, too, Rusty!

3
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:09,257
A typical place in every way.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,425
You off to the game today, Big Jim?

5
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:13,521
Until...

6
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:15,723
the unimaginable.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,397
What the hell happened here?

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,266
Hey, no.

9
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:26,567
Don't touch that!

10
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,202
I have just learned

11
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:29,503
that the barrier around Chester's Mill

12
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:32,406
is being called a dome.

13
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:34,375
No, no, no, stop!

14
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:36,443
We're trapped.

15
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:38,245
The dome kept everyone in.

16
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,648
Why us? Maybe we're being punished.

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,384
And threatened to let
all their secrets out.

18
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:45,853
What the hell do you want from me?

19
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:48,289
He's lying to you!

20
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,524
But the dome had secrets of its own.

21
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:51,592
We found this egg.

22
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:56,663
What does "The pink stars
are falling in lines" mean?

23
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:58,565
And one thing was certain...

24
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,367
there was no escape.

25
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,668
This dome can't break us!

26
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,270
Look at what it's doing!

27
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,638
We're all gonna die in here.

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,773
Tonight...

29
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,675
I really love the story

30
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:10,110
'cause it's a survival story.

31
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,912
- Step back.
- ... the cast and producers

32
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:14,314
go inside this incredible story.

33
00:01:14,316 --> 00:01:16,283
Well, in season one we
had to establish the dome.

34
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,385
We had to establish the
chaos that it brought.

35
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,754
And the horror without
reveals the horror within.

36
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:22,489
Shut up! All you do is lie.

37
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:23,857
And take an exclusive look ahead...

38
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,525
Second season is much more

39
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:27,527
about the characters'
journeys and who they are.

40
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,563
Someone has to make the hard choices!

41
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:32,265
- ... at the next chapter.
- We start to explore

42
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:34,334
what that dome is doing to the people.

43
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:37,204
- Why did you leave me?
- With never-before-seen moments.

44
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:38,538
This season will answer a lot of questions.

45
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,840
And a warning.

46
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:42,008
How do you explain all this?

47
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,977
You just have no idea what's gonna happen.

48
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,445
- No one...
- Oh, my God, my

49
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:46,980
- mom's in there!
- ... is safe.

50
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,949
- Junior!
- Gear up,

51
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:51,518
'cause it's about to get even crazier.

52
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,625
You're listening to WYBS,

53
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:04,964
the Mill's only 100%
independent home of rock.

54
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,733
In a typical small town...

55
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,601
Sorry to bother you. Sam Verdreaux called.

56
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:10,403
He wants us to know that he
heard some kind of a bang.

57
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:13,439
... even the biggest
problems can seem simple.

58
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,241
You were right to get me, Linda.

59
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:17,177
Never know with this damn place.

60
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,913
Monday mornings have been
brutal since they opened

61
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:21,514
that Denny's over in Westlake.

62
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,417
I'll take your French toast
any day of the week, Rose.

63
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,654
Big Jim Rennie was working
on his next election.

64
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:28,688
What is this?

65
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,390
That's me buying your next vote.

66
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:32,525
Says the guy who always runs unopposed.

67
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,993
Big Jim is the main

68
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,162
councilman left in the town.

69
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,131
He's also a used car salesman.

70
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:39,465
So you know you can trust him.

71
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,067
We're all in this together.

72
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,335
Julia Shumway

73
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:44,137
searched for her next headline.

74
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,005
So you're the newspaper woman?

75
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:48,407
I'm the new editor of
The Independent. Yeah.

76
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,644
Julia is a reporter who moves to
Chester's Mill with her husband,

77
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:52,845
who's a doctor.

78
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:55,031
You see that truck?

79
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:57,667
That's its fourth propane
delivery this week.

80
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,969
I called Sheriff Perkins three days ago.

81
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,370
He sounded nervous.

82
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:03,572
She wants to know the truth

83
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:06,042
and she's not gonna stop
till she gets the truth.

84
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:08,010
I'll do some digging.

85
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,981
God.

86
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,016
You all right, there?

87
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:15,384
When we first meet

88
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:17,353
Junior Rennie, he's madly

89
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:19,388
in love with Angie McAlister.

90
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,890
I love you.

91
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:23,426
It's been a fun summer.

92
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,761
And she has just told him good-bye.

93
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:27,431
Ouch.

94
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,143
Angie is not really looking
for a serious relationship.

95
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,594
She is really trying to
get out of Chester's Mill

96
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,017
and make a better life for herself.

97
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,637
You're the only person in the whole world

98
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,572
who knows the real me.

99
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:39,875
And that's why I can't be with you.

100
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:42,744
He has this kind of, like, hole
in his heart after losing Angie.

101
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,446
I'm gonna be late for work.

102
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:48,350
And he's wanting to get
back with her any way he can.

103
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:52,027
It was a quiet place.

104
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:55,864
But even Chester's Mill had a dark side.

105
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,499
When we first meet Barbie,

106
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:58,500
he's definitely in town

107
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:00,602
under some suspicious circumstances.

108
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:03,638
We're not quite sure who he is,

109
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,273
where he's come from.

110
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,709
We think he's a bad guy.

111
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:09,911
He's got a big secret.

112
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:11,146
A big secret...

113
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,447
So we got a problem here.

114
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,382
... and some really bad luck.

115
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:21,787
_

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,160
Imagine if you're in an
ordinary American town.

117
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:29,464
Suddenly you hear a rumbling and shaking.

118
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:31,833
And the ground is moving under your feet.

119
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,502
It's like, everybody thinks
there's an earthquake.

120
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,171
Just the feeling

121
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:39,640
of the wind and the gust.

122
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:41,109
All of a sudden...

123
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:42,877
boom, it hits.

124
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:52,486
You really see the horror of it,

125
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:53,988
you know, the... our famous image

126
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,191
from the first season is
the cow being split in half.

127
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:00,294
Aah!

128
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:04,165
Ugh.

129
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,133
It really was a good symbol
for sort of what happens.

130
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:08,636
You know, the town gets severed.

131
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:11,272
The dome comes down, people

132
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:13,607
lose limbs, people get cut in half.

133
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,910
The world sort of flips upside down.

134
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:18,446
You have the unexplainable, the chaotic,

135
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:21,520
the terrifying, all happening at once.

136
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,550
You okay?

137
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:27,688
What the hell?

138
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,324
Right when the dome comes down, Joe

139
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,259
is found, you know, on his farm.

140
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:35,162
Joe McAlister is an everyday kid who's 16

141
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:37,731
years old. Pretty good in science and math.

142
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,667
Joe's parents are trapped outside the dome.

143
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,436
It's some sort of invisible fence.

144
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:44,972
Whatever it is, I'd
probably stop touching it.

145
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:47,107
One of the things that was most terrifying

146
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:49,414
about the premise is the
idea that it's invisible.

147
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:53,046
You'd be walking down the
street or driving your car

148
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:55,682
or your truck or your
little plane, and you would

149
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:58,418
hit this invisible barrier.

150
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:05,626
Run!

151
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:12,899
What the hell is happening?

152
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:16,269
Am I doing something wrong?

153
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:17,571
Power's out, Carolyn.

154
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,039
Cashier said the pumps'll be back on soon.

155
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,409
"Chester's Mill is known
for its rich, fertile land

156
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:23,740
and warm, inviting people."

157
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:26,580
Norrie is a L.A. kid who,

158
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,815
uh, has a real attitude about anything

159
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:31,418
that isn't big-city hip.

160
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,289
She has two mothers and they're
not happy with her behavior.

161
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,758
- For the millionth time... that was an accident.
- That's what you said

162
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,092
when you knocked out that girl's tooth.

163
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:42,496
So they're taking her to boot camp.

164
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:44,431
And they are in the wrong place

165
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,799
at the wrong time.

166
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:53,907
Is everyone all right?

167
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,209
Nothing about this

168
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,811
is all right.

169
00:06:57,813 --> 00:07:00,647
The barrier had a
mysterious effect on Norrie.

170
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:01,431
Norrie!

171
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:03,715
And then all of a sudden,
she's on the ground

172
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,119
in the middle of the street
having a seizure, mumbling...

173
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,989
The pink stars are falling.

174
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:11,691
Sheriff Perkins,

175
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:12,993
the plane smashed right into it.

176
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:15,228
- Into what?
- Whatever it is,

177
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,896
it cut off all our roads.

178
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,532
Not just the roads...

179
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:21,301
the whole town.

180
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:25,071
Suddenly, the peaceful
town of Chester's Mill

181
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,273
would never be the same.

182
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:32,445
In season two, we're genuinely trapped.

183
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:34,080
- Coming up...
- Get down!

184
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:35,381
... an exclusive scene

185
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:38,218
from season two of Under the Dome.

186
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:53,381
In an instant, Chester's
Mill had been forever changed.

187
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:55,116
- All right, everybody...
- And as authorities

188
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:56,651
mobilized on the outside...

189
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,787
... puts the dome over
Chester's Mill at roughly...

190
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,623
- Did he just call it a dome?
- Yeah.

191
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,459
... fear began to surface on the inside.

192
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:06,560
What the hell is going on?

193
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:07,862
Isn't it obvious?

194
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:10,464
We're under attack.
Nobody knows a damn thing,

195
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,066
so there's no point in
spreading any rumors.

196
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:13,300
There's an initial panic

197
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:15,402
of people not knowing what it is.

198
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:17,872
Why is that dome here? Is there a specific

199
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:19,874
reason that this dome hit us?

200
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:23,644
No one was safe. And
neither were their secrets.

201
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:25,379
Any sign of your husband?

202
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,780
Not yet.

203
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:28,849
Julia hadn't seen her husband,

204
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:30,718
Peter, since the dome appeared.

205
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,319
She just assumes that he's

206
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,188
helping out in the chaos. He's a doctor.

207
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,523
- Is the doc with you?
- He's not here?

208
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,525
Listen, your husband hasn't
worked Sundays in weeks.

209
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,661
She thinks he must have been

210
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:42,329
trapped outside the dome.

211
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:44,898
And then, enter a tall, dark stranger.

212
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,266
Who the hell are you?

213
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,036
Or blond.

214
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:50,737
Barbie.

215
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,039
Barbie?

216
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,740
- It's a nickname.
- I think Barbie,

217
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,377
from the get-go, would love
to have run back into the woods

218
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,581
- and just hid out.
- What about you?

219
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,584
- Where are you off to?
- Uh, the motels are all booked up, so

220
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,785
I'm just gonna rough it.

221
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:06,053
Don't be ridiculous.

222
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,888
You can stay with Peter and me.

223
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,691
- How do you guys have power?
- Backup generator.

224
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:13,326
That's Peter, behind you.

225
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:15,195
To Barbie, Peter Shumway

226
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:18,298
was a familiar face.

227
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:24,037
Stephen King frequently
writes about the ideal

228
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,306
American town

229
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:29,943
when it's like the worm inside the apple.

230
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,647
And what's the worm gonna
be inside of Chester's Mill?

231
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:35,181
It's like a ghost town in here.

232
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,983
I should be able to hold down the fort.

233
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:38,685
It's easier to reach
consensus when there's only

234
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:40,353
one voice to listen to, right?

235
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:41,988
Sheriff Duke Perkins was

236
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,324
the town's long-respected lawman.

237
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:45,325
What are you gettin' at, Jim?

238
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:46,826
No one knew about his

239
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:48,928
corrupt dealings with Big Jim.

240
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,064
What do we do when the people
start asking about the propane?

241
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:53,399
Well, that has nothing to do with this.

242
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,301
Oh. Big Jim has been storing up

243
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,504
some propane for a-a certain amount of

244
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:58,771
drug-making.

245
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:01,241
There's a lot I've tried
to protect you from.

246
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:03,409
Like what?

247
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,945
But something within the
dome triggered a reaction.

248
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,347
My chest.

249
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:09,148
Duke, is it your pacemaker?

250
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,217
- No, Duke!
- And Duke

251
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,620
took their secrets to the grave.

252
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:14,854
Holy hell.

253
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:16,889
Big Jim wasted no time

254
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,691
asserting himself, keeping

255
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:21,946
his other business partner,
Reverend Coggins, in line.

256
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:24,263
You're using our stuff...
you're high as a kite.

257
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:27,333
S... so what? It's Judgment Day, Jim.

258
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,769
And he never missed an opportunity...

259
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:33,239
- The flames are too high.
- ... to take center stage in a crisis.

260
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,508
You know, I always saw Big Jim as a guy

261
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,645
who recited Winston Churchill
speeches in the shower.

262
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:45,017
And, uh, wished that he was

263
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,520
in a time and place when
he could've been that guy.

264
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,854
Thank you, everyone,

265
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,289
for a job well done.

266
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,991
Well, we couldn't have done
it without you, Big Jim.

267
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:52,925
Oh...

268
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:54,493
Where were you yesterday,

269
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:55,761
- Junior?
- Nowhere.

270
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:57,630
Big Jim tightened

271
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,498
his grip on the town

272
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
and on his son.

273
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:04,203
Junior is, uh, Big Jim's only son,

274
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,471
and on the one hand,

275
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:06,705
Big Jim wants to help him,

276
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,440
wants to keep him out of trouble.

277
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:10,176
People are looking to me

278
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:11,443
to lead.

279
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:14,310
It reflects poorly when my son is AWOL.

280
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:15,431
On the other hand,

281
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,866
he kind of wears Big Jim's patience,

282
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,734
because he's constantly
having to deal with this kid

283
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:20,669
who's doing all these crazy things.

284
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,274
Like when he puts his girlfriend

285
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:26,842
in the fallout shelter.

286
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:29,178
What the hell do you want from me?

287
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,512
Junior kidnaps Angie

288
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:32,348
because he believes...

289
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,016
now that this dome has come down...

290
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,918
that there's something wrong with her.

291
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,719
I think it scrambled your brain.

292
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,322
One of us has a scrambled brain, all right.

293
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,624
You can't see it, but I can.

294
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:44,793
He truly believes the
dome is infecting her mind,

295
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:46,929
so he's out to save her any way he can.

296
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,864
I don't believe we've been, uh,

297
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,566
formally introduced.

298
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:51,867
I'm, uh, Jim Rennie.

299
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:53,435
People around here call me Big Jim.

300
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:54,636
Barbie.

301
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:56,138
Big Jim was now the law in town.

302
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,106
Barbie.

303
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,309
Well, that's kind of a... funny name

304
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,110
for a fellow with your
particular expertise.

305
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:04,513
And he needed soldiers.

306
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,747
What is your objective here, huh?

307
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:07,916
Is it to bring him in or
we trying to take him out?

308
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,117
I don't see it makes a difference

309
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,986
to a guy like you, does it?

310
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:12,454
Barbie intuitively goes,

311
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:13,822
"That's a guy I've got to watch out for."

312
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:16,224
I told you, we're finishing this.

313
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,559
Why is that?

314
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:20,795
So you can show the town
what a big man Big Jim is?

315
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,164
Barbie notices along the way that

316
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,468
this guy is just power-hungry
and up to no good.

317
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,270
Sometimes an example

318
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:30,972
needs to be made, you know?

319
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:33,074
Command respect.

320
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:36,044
God, I swear, you ask

321
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,779
more questions than anybody I've ever met.

322
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,981
Well, you know you're
pretty good at evading them.

323
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:42,117
Barbie couldn't escape Chester's Mill,

324
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,386
or the wife of the man he'd killed.

325
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,653
You all right?

326
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:47,722
You were, uh, talking in your sleep.

327
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,290
Yelling, actually.

328
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:51,559
He's obviously very handsome, and, so,

329
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,528
you know, there's an
attraction, there's chemistry.

330
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,730
Thanks again for letting me crash here.

331
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,632
With my husband missing and

332
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:01,269
everything that happened today,
it was nice to have the company.

333
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,638
They get really close, and they form

334
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,139
this fast friendship, this bond.

335
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:07,208
Julia continued to ask questions.

336
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,211
And you really were just
passing through Chester's Mill?

337
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:11,946
No connection to anyone here in town?

338
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:13,481
No.

339
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:16,451
So, we start this chess game

340
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:18,653
between the two of them.

341
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:22,290
Being a reporter, she
knows the questions to ask.

342
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:26,360
- So, you went through my stuff?
- You lied to me.

343
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,429
When Julia suddenly fell ill,

344
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:30,831
Barbie decided to reveal
her husband's secrets.

345
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,434
I've got the cash, but my wife's home.

346
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:35,169
Meet me at the other spot.

347
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:37,805
Julia learns that her husband Peter had

348
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:39,573
a gambling problem that he was concealing.

349
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,878
And Barbie was coming
to collect those debts.

350
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,347
- I don't have it!
- Yeah? My boss is not gonna like that.

351
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:51,318
So, where is he now?

352
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:54,188
He doesn't come completely clean.

353
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,290
He must have taken off.

354
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,692
And then, eventually,

355
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:01,195
finds himself against
the ropes with no way out.

356
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:03,531
I found this life insurance policy today.

357
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:07,835
Julia soon discovered the truth
behind her husband's death.

358
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,069
He needed you to kill him.

359
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:10,871
She processes everything that happened,

360
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,906
and she realizes, well,

361
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,441
Peter had put Barbie in a situation

362
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:15,643
where he really had no choice.

363
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,212
It was shoot or be shot.

364
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,220
You know, in some weird way,

365
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:28,455
I think he did all this
to try to protect me.

366
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:30,657
'Cause this would be void

367
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:31,758
if he committed suicide.

368
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,762
Barbie's done enough heroics
in Chester's Mill already

369
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:38,866
to prove that he's sort of
more the hero than the villain.

370
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:40,234
But in the future,

371
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:42,669
there can be no more lies.

372
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:46,907
With secrets no longer between them...

373
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:48,742
We're gonna be okay.

374
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:52,746
... Julia and Barbie's
relationship quickly deepened.

375
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:57,551
Well, your son takes after you, too.

376
00:14:57,553 --> 00:15:00,887
He stopped what could have
been a full-blown riot.

377
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:03,757
Big Jim's relationship with
his son had also evolved.

378
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,725
You ever consider a
career in law enforcement?

379
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,129
When Junior was made a deputy,
he earned Big Jim's respect.

380
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,464
A chip off the old block.

381
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:14,601
But that respect would be short-lived.

382
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:16,836
There is a pipe

383
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,004
that bursts in the fallout shelter,

384
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,739
and Big Jim hears it.

385
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,209
He goes to look,

386
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:25,779
and finds Angie.

387
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:28,181
You're gonna get me out of here, right?

388
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,549
He does something really interesting.

389
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:30,784
He doesn't pick her up

390
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:32,786
and drag her out of there and get her help.

391
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:35,722
I just, uh, I just need to
think on this a little bit.

392
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,290
No, no, no, you can't leave me down here!

393
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,491
You can't! You... No.

394
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:39,926
No! Wait! Wait!

395
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,427
Help! Help!

396
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:45,098
You think the dome is
gonna be here forever?

397
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,733
Coming up...

398
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:47,867
This is the real discovery.

399
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:49,869
There's something else at work here.

400
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,537
What does it mean?

401
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:04,220
Excuse me.

402
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:06,022
Where can a girl charge up in this town?

403
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:08,758
Everyone was adjusting
to life under the dome.

404
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,959
I have a generator.

405
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,928
Norrie goes to this kind of

406
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,863
teenage bonfire where
they're all mourning the loss

407
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:15,264
of their electronics.

408
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,968
Without my music, I can get a
little, you know, super bitchy.

409
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,570
Well, there's definitely an immediate

410
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:21,571
attraction to Norrie

411
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:22,838
from Joe. He sees

412
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,574
this new girl.

413
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,742
She's dressed differently,
she talks differently.

414
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,611
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

415
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,246
Uh, maybe I can fix it.

416
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:33,616
Really? That thing blew
up like the Death Star.

417
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,251
Yeah, but the Empire rebuilt the Death Star

418
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,419
in The Return of the Jedi.

419
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:37,553
I like nerds.

420
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:38,754
Norrie?

421
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:40,656
- Oh, God.
- Norrie,

422
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:41,657
are you here... ?

423
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:42,925
And

424
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:44,160
her mom finds her.

425
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:46,128
Let's go.

426
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,297
And the second she grabs Joe's hand...

427
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,000
- Oh, my God. Norrie?
- What happened?

428
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:52,501
Pink stars are falling in lines.

429
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:53,736
- Norrie?!
- The pink stars are falling

430
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:55,070
- in lines.
- Norrie.

431
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,639
And that's the first time

432
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,374
you see them seizing together.

433
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:00,676
Well, they're obviously
meant to be in some way.

434
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:02,745
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

435
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:06,548
Of all the things to do after
you've had a double seizure.

436
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,050
Let's try it again.

437
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,321
And we record ourselves doing that

438
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,355
to see what happens.

439
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:14,523
The pink stars are falling...

440
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,959
That's the first step to
them figuring things out.

441
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:20,062
What does this mean?

442
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:21,530
Maybe we're not supposed to tell anyone.

443
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:22,898
Why not?

444
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,968
'Cause the dome doesn't want us to.

445
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,906
The dome continued to reveal
itself to those inside...

446
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:33,308
What is this?

447
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,311
... while forces outside
had other intentions.

448
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:37,613
Look.

449
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:40,082
They're bussing in more soldiers?

450
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:42,551
No. Civilians.

451
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:44,286
It's been nearly a week
since this thing came down.

452
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:46,021
Why bus the families in now?

453
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,589
Haven't you ever been to camp?

454
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:50,592
They're finally giving
us our own visitors day.

455
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:53,695
Yeah, visitor day was interesting,

456
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,197
because it, uh... at first,

457
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,766
it's set up as if it's a nice thing.

458
00:17:57,768 --> 00:18:00,769
It's a lovely day in which we
all get to see our relatives.

459
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,337
Sinners!

460
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:04,272
The happy day wouldn't last long.

461
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:05,473
Over and over,

462
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:09,811
the Lord has spoken one word in my ear.

463
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:11,613
MOAB.

464
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:13,381
- MOAB!
- Thank you, Reverend.

465
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,417
Thank you for those inspiring words.

466
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,885
Visitor day is set up

467
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,387
as a sort of family reunion.

468
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:25,293
"What's... happening... out there?"

469
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:26,828
Barbie comes to find out

470
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,862
that's not the intent at all.

471
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:30,598
They're not about to let this
thing mess with the outside world.

472
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,966
It's the episode that starts out

473
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:33,201
with the best-case scenario

474
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,936
and ends with the worst-case scenario.

475
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:36,271
MOAB.

476
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:37,539
Come again?

477
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,308
What your reverend was ranting about.

478
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,677
MOAB is not a city. It's an acronym...

479
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,746
For "the mother of all bombs."

480
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,281
The army is gonna blow up the dome,

481
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:48,082
even if that means blowing us up with it.

482
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,651
Good Lord.

483
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,419
- We're all just gonna die.
- No.

484
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,421
No. We get everybody to a shelter.

485
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,389
Where?

486
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:56,324
The old cement factory.

487
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:58,326
Some of those tunnels run pretty deep.

488
00:18:58,328 --> 00:18:59,927
Faced with their final moments,

489
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,231
Chester's Millers each made their peace...

490
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,233
Last call.

491
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:09,003
... including Big Jim.

492
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:10,438
Why are you doing this?

493
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,907
Well, if we're all gonna die today,

494
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:16,477
you might as well die a free woman.

495
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,947
Norrie and Joe are going

496
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:23,117
on kind of their first
little adventure together, and

497
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,253
there's a huge missile
coming straight for us.

498
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:28,289
And, of course...

499
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,627
... what else do you do
when the world's ending?

500
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:34,728
It's just this special,

501
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,865
fiery moment between both of them.

502
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:42,369
When we touched, we
didn't have the seizures.

503
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:45,339
More importantly, we didn't die.

504
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:48,909
The fact that we can't blow up that dome

505
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:50,344
kind of sets everybody to thinking that

506
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:54,048
this dome thing is bigger
and stronger and more

507
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,717
important than any of us
can ever really think about.

508
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:59,486
They're now really cut
off from the outside world

509
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:02,823
because everything outside
the dome is now a wasteland.

510
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:03,657
And they're stuck

511
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:04,925
because

512
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:07,795
if a bomb can't touch the dome, what can?

513
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,062
It kind of reinforces the idea

514
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:11,098
that we're gonna be
here for a while and that

515
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,400
he needs to step it up and be the leader.

516
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:16,203
God told me to come out here.

517
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:17,771
What the hell you doing here?

518
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:22,009
Jim, I know you think
this town belongs to you,

519
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:24,544
and maybe... maybe it used to,

520
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,513
but today...

521
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,515
Today's a new day.

522
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,817
You know, you're right, Reverend.

523
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:33,086
Big Jim felt that Reverend Coggins

524
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:35,389
was getting crazy, was
gonna lead to problems.

525
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,894
You don't want to make an enemy

526
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:43,930
of Big Jim under the dome.

527
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:47,834
And that's when Big Jim starts

528
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:50,170
to realize, "Wow, I could be king."

529
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:53,540
He's on a mission to control his enemies

530
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:57,043
and to put himself in charge.

531
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:01,314
With no end in sight to their ordeal...

532
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:02,816
Damn it.

533
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:04,751
- Now what?
- I lost the signal.

534
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:07,687
... Julia worked to uncover
the mysteries of the dome.

535
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:08,555
Julia ends up

536
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:10,790
running around with Dodee...

537
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:11,758
- We're close.
- All right.

538
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,759
... trying to get a signal,

539
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:13,993
which they think is going

540
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:16,029
to be the source of the dome.

541
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,697
I think it's coming from them.

542
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,334
I know it doesn't make any sense.

543
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:23,136
It sort of does.

544
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:25,038
It was time to share their secret.

545
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,206
The pink stars are falling in lines.

546
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,776
Okay, I'm officially freaked out.

547
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,012
Norrie and Joe continue

548
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:35,682
to test their connection to the dome.

549
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,785
Anything?

550
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:42,021
Yeah. You're really good at that.

551
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:43,556
From the dome, Joe.

552
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,758
I didn't feel anything, like a seizure.

553
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,528
Me neither, unfortunately.

554
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:51,564
Maybe we're going about it all wrong.

555
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:52,832
Joe, being smart,

556
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,267
figures out that there may be something

557
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:57,036
at the center of the
dome that powers the dome.

558
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:58,804
It shouldn't be too far now.

559
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:01,674
Norrie and Joe go off on a search.

560
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:04,810
The hair's standing up on my arms.

561
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:09,248
There it is.

562
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,919
They start uncovering this
mound in the ground, and

563
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:16,322
there's another dome.

564
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:20,793
And as they uncover the dirt and leaves,

565
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:23,295
they see a small egg.

566
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:29,468
So, what was weird has gotten even weirder.

567
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,572
Maybe it's the generator
that created the whole dome.

568
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:36,308
The discovery of the mini-dome
and the discovery of the egg...

569
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,377
- Okay.
- ... It's really sort of

570
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:41,447
our portal into the next phase

571
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:42,815
of the dome.

572
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:43,983
Norrie?

573
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:45,417
Joe and Norrie discover

574
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,721
the dome had ways to communicate with them.

575
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:50,155
Mom?

576
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:57,563
I need to find my mom.

577
00:22:57,565 --> 00:23:01,233
Because something horrible
is about to happen.

578
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:03,468
Mom, you're not going anywhere.

579
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,537
Norrie's mother was diabetic.

580
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:08,140
You have to be brave.

581
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:10,108
The dome's arrival had caused

582
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,910
dangerously limited resources...

583
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:14,479
I will, I promise.

584
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:17,916
... and cut off her access
to life-saving insulin.

585
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:20,585
Bring her back.

586
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:23,255
I'll do anything you want.

587
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:26,958
Just tell me what you want!

588
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,861
I've never met anyone like her before.

589
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:31,863
It's kind of amazing

590
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:33,532
to feel that connected.

591
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:35,667
It's even more intense at the egg.

592
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:37,836
The egg?

593
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:41,840
What egg?

594
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:45,176
For Julia, that egg is confirmation

595
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:48,113
that there are other forces at work here.

596
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:53,018
It's pink. It was black before.

597
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:58,723
She's kind of mesmerized
by the egg and the mini-dome

598
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:00,825
and trying to figure out what's going on.

599
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:03,027
And all of a sudden...

600
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:06,030
The monarch will be crowned.

601
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:09,934
What did you just say?

602
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:11,769
Who are you talking to?

603
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:14,806
Julia realizes that she's chosen

604
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,008
in some way to be connected to it.

605
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,077
The monarch will be crowned.

606
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:35,141
What the hell you doing here?

607
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:37,544
Junior was angry that his
father had released Angie

608
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:40,046
from the fallout shelter.

609
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,881
I just want to make sure she's safe.

610
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:44,084
You're not in your right mind, Junior.

611
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:46,319
You sound just like your
mother did at the end.

612
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,321
The rejection pushed Junior

613
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:51,057
toward Big Jim's lifelong enemy...

614
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,726
My dad kicked me out.

615
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:55,028
... where he learned a family secret.

616
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,764
I can't imagine your dad's
an easy man to live with,

617
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:00,033
especially after your mother dying.

618
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:02,035
It was, um...

619
00:25:02,037 --> 00:25:04,704
a tragic accident.

620
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,172
Is that what he told you?

621
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:09,943
You told me she died in a car crash.

622
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:12,912
The ultimate drama is going
to be about family, and

623
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:16,015
that family has its tragedy

624
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,583
that gets very messy.

625
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:19,652
Wasn't an accident, was it?

626
00:25:19,654 --> 00:25:21,587
No.

627
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,589
Junior wants his dad to, like,

628
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:24,824
tell the truth for once.

629
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:26,159
Your mother had been...

630
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:28,127
unsteady

631
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:29,328
for a while.

632
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,365
He explains that she committed suicide.

633
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:33,633
He's been protecting Junior

634
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:36,669
from the truth of the situation.

635
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:38,471
Why...

636
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:39,939
did you lie to me?

637
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:41,774
'Cause I didn't want you

638
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:43,643
to know that she chose

639
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:45,578
to leave you.

640
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:47,747
I'm so sorry.

641
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:49,448
Just to hear it from Big Jim's mouth

642
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,350
is what he kind of needed

643
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:53,619
in order to rebuild their relationship.

644
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,221
You got a problem with this?

645
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:56,956
Allow me.

646
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:04,463
I believe you.

647
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:06,999
Angie.

648
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,767
Hey.

649
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:11,370
I just had a seizure at the diner.

650
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:13,172
What do you mean, you had a seizure?

651
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:15,674
I was just standing there, and then I...

652
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,344
I went blank and collapsed.

653
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:20,980
Angie! The pink stars are falling in lines.

654
00:26:20,982 --> 00:26:22,281
Did you say,

655
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:23,215
"The pink stars are falling"?

656
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:25,985
How did you know that?

657
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:28,253
And, obviously, those words are

658
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:31,790
a connection somehow, but
they're not sure exactly why.

659
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,126
It's what you found in the woods, isn't it?

660
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:35,427
And you're not freaking out about it?

661
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,396
I can't deny that I'm a part of this now.

662
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:38,697
Me,

663
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:42,935
Angie and Norrie all place
our hands on the mini-dome.

664
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:47,005
It's almost like... these are locks...

665
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,408
... and our hands are the keys.

666
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,044
We notice that there's a
fourth handprint that appears

667
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:54,212
that there isn't a person for.

668
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:56,648
I think we need a fourth hand.

669
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,292
I knew you'd come find me.

670
00:26:59,105 --> 00:26:59,985
Why have you always said

671
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:02,054
that the dome is making me sick?

672
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:03,655
Because it's true.

673
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:05,257
But there's more,

674
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,625
isn't there? Yeah.

675
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,126
Junior is

676
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,528
seeing all the pieces come together,

677
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,762
and so he's finally feeling

678
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,898
like he can show Angie
his mom's art studio.

679
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,666
A couple months

680
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:17,269
before she died, she
had this dream about me.

681
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,771
And she just started painting
this as fast as she could.

682
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,012
Pink stars.

683
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:28,914
When he reveals

684
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,782
this different side of him and his mother,

685
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:33,084
she starts to question, maybe I was sick.

686
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:35,053
Maybe he knows more than I do.

687
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:38,189
Maybe, way back then, she
knew the dome was coming.

688
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:41,059
And I must be part of it,
because I'm in this painting.

689
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:42,694
And now, obviously, you're part of it, too.

690
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:44,929
She doesn't trust him still,

691
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:47,832
but they're just connected in this way.

692
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,502
The four hands are the four

693
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,204
people who can unlock the mystery

694
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,540
of the dome.

695
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:59,177
And the phrase that no one
has known what it's meant...

696
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,778
"The pink stars are falling"...

697
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,146
the pink stars fall.

698
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,385
Then the dome lights up.

699
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,387
Oh, my God.

700
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:11,356
It's the pink stars.

701
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:14,325
And it projects all these
beautiful constellations...

702
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,760
the dipper,

703
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,962
Castor and Pollux and all that stuff.

704
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,630
It's kind of a star map.

705
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:22,300
It's a piece of what the
dome means, but it doesn't

706
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:23,901
outright give answers.

707
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,370
Beautiful!

708
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:30,508
But... what does it mean?

709
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:38,582
Big Jim was constantly on high alert...

710
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:39,850
You got one second to tell me

711
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,585
why I shouldn't blow your damn head off.

712
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:45,423
... but he never expected to see
his old friend Maxine Seagrave.

713
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,992
Because you don't want to
ruin this beautiful face?

714
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:50,194
Maxine's another one of his business

715
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:52,696
associates in the illegal drug trade.

716
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,031
This is, uh,

717
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,233
Dale Barbara. He...

718
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,202
We find out

719
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:02,640
that Barbie and Jim are
connected through Maxine.

720
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:05,809
In terms of Big Jim, she
was partners with him.

721
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,244
In terms of Barbie,

722
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,680
she was sleeping with him,
and Barbie works for her

723
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:10,881
as a collector.

724
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,516
We make a damn good team.

725
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:14,184
And as long as this dome is around,

726
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,253
I can see us making
this town our playground.

727
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,358
What are you doing?

728
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,427
We're finished, Max.

729
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,629
Maxine, ultimately,

730
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,664
sort of draws the conclusion that Julia is

731
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,366
why I won't join sides with her.

732
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,502
First, she turns up out of nowhere

733
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:34,671
and turns out to be the woman
who was sleeping with Barbie,

734
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:35,939
who's now sort of my boyfriend.

735
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,107
Can I help you?

736
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,309
Right now you can't even help yourself.

737
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:42,879
And the first time

738
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,649
I get to meet her face-to-face,
she puts a bullet in me.

739
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,853
It's so cold-hearted,

740
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,021
um, that it's kind of great.

741
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,389
You hungry?

742
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,857
After unlocking the star map,

743
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,728
Junior and Angie were left
to wonder what it all meant.

744
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,096
Can you believe it, Angie?

745
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,864
The way our lives are braided together,

746
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,133
and they will be forever.

747
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,935
What? Are you insane?

748
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:09,172
It is not about you and me.
It will never be about you...

749
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,840
- I don't believe you.
- Well, believe it.

750
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,842
We will never be together!

751
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,045
Then I'm out. I'm done

752
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:18,114
with you, with this,
the mini-dome, all of it.

753
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,016
I've never met someone so selfish!

754
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,353
Junior's departure had consequences,

755
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,655
as the dome unleashed its wrath.

756
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,124
Julia?! Julia, hey, hey,
hey, hey, stay with me.

757
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,926
Hey, you got to hurry, Joe. She's crashing.

758
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:33,062
And a mysterious storm descended.

759
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,099
It's not just weather. It's the dome.

760
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,034
I think it's angry at us.

761
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,206
Junior! Look at what it's doing!

762
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,009
It's sending a message!

763
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,478
You have to come back to the group.

764
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,013
It takes all of us,

765
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,381
or we're nothing.

766
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,249
Barbie worked frantically to save Julia.

767
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,619
Come on!

768
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,155
Come on. We got to go!

769
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,591
Angie!

770
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:07,530
And after Junior's change of heart,

771
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,599
the storm receded.

772
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,502
I was right.

773
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,638
Storm's breaking up.

774
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,708
Julia survived the attack,

775
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,444
but Maxine would have to answer for it.

776
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,749
You know it's Max who shot her, right?

777
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:26,616
And I also know that it's time to stop her.

778
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,951
Big Jim hates Maxine

779
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,153
because she has the goods
on him, and she threatens

780
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,455
to tell the town.

781
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,789
Should take both of us to do it.

782
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:36,776
Well, we're gonna do this by my rules, Jim.

783
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:38,778
We're taking Max alive.

784
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,984
Barbie now becomes the... the one
really fighting for order in this town.

785
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,719
Big Jim evolves into

786
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,687
a man who's seeking to capitalize

787
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,322
on the chaos of this town.

788
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:51,924
You're not saving Chester's Mill.

789
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,726
You're eating this town alive.

790
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:55,728
Big Jim is a smart guy.

791
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,162
He's a practical guy,

792
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:59,632
and he sees Barbie as... at
the beginning, at least...

793
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,633
as someone who could be useful to him,

794
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:03,602
and, throughout the course of the season,

795
00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:07,139
Big Jim realizes that maybe
Barbie's not really the guy

796
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:09,174
to be on his team.

797
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:11,210
I'm gonna go get our car.

798
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:14,379
We'll take them down to the station.

799
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:17,082
So Big Jim realized that he could kill

800
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:19,151
several birds with one stone.

801
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:23,222
He'd kill Maxine and her bodyguard.

802
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,628
And then he could get rid of Barbie by

803
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,929
putting the blame on him.

804
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:33,332
Barbie, put that weapon down!

805
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,167
Put it down now!

806
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:36,902
Linda, thank God!

807
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:39,404
- He's gone nuts!
- He's lying to you!

808
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:40,639
He killed 'em.

809
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:42,541
I was next.

810
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,843
Linda, I'm telling you...

811
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:51,616
Shoot that son of a bitch!

812
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:58,089
This has been a very dark
day in Chester's Mill.

813
00:32:58,091 --> 00:33:02,193
Maxine Seagrave and her
business associate were murdered.

814
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:05,363
An attempt was made on
the life of Julia Shumway.

815
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:07,666
One person is responsible for all this:

816
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:10,735
Dale "Barbie" Barbara.

817
00:33:10,737 --> 00:33:11,870
Big Jim uses

818
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:13,405
his powers of persuasion

819
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,340
and he is able to convince the town

820
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,208
that he is the leader, that

821
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,777
Barbie committed these murders.

822
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,911
The people...

823
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:22,080
will seek the death penalty.

824
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:23,982
The four hands knew that the dome

825
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:25,350
was communicating with them.

826
00:33:25,352 --> 00:33:26,484
But to what end?

827
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:27,852
What do we do now?

828
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:30,054
If these stars are really us,

829
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:33,091
then we have to go to the
same spot on the big dome.

830
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:35,260
Joe figures out that they're

831
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:37,629
being called to go to the big dome.

832
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:45,670
They all go to the dome, put their hands

833
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:46,904
on it, they see

834
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:48,239
this kind of ghostly image

835
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:50,842
of Big Jim coming forward.

836
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:52,210
Dad?

837
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:54,378
And he starts bleeding

838
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,748
and he gets these knife wounds.

839
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,618
Junior's freaking out, and

840
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,322
all four of us look down
and we have these knives.

841
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:08,392
Junior?

842
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:12,930
No! What the hell was that?

843
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:15,232
I... I thought we were
coming here for answers.

844
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:17,001
I think that was it.

845
00:34:17,903 --> 00:34:19,737
Big Jim has to die.

846
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,474
And I think we're supposed to do it.

847
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:28,379
Season two, we explore

848
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:30,748
- the mythology of the dome.
- Coming up...

849
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,949
What's happening?

850
00:34:31,951 --> 00:34:34,118
... an exclusive scene from season two

851
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,753
of Under the Dome.

852
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,654
What's it doing?

853
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,556
I think it's mad we didn't kill Big Jim.

854
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,257
- Angie, we can't do that.
- Joe,

855
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:53,227
Norrie and Angie grappled
with what to do next.

856
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:54,528
It wants him dead.

857
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,964
- Why?
- I don't know.

858
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:58,566
Maybe so that he doesn't kill your monarch?

859
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:01,902
And they found a mysterious
cocoon inside the mini-dome.

860
00:35:01,904 --> 00:35:03,504
When the butterfly hatches,

861
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:06,006
the monarch will be crowned.

862
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:08,409
Dodee's continued suspicions

863
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:12,046
led her to a discovery.

864
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:14,948
And transmissions from the outside

865
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,718
helped her understand
the importance of the egg.

866
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,988
Any idea where the hell
that egg thing is, soldier?

867
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,525
There is evidence that the outside world

868
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:25,592
knows what's going on.

869
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:28,162
The military's looking for an egg?

870
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:29,963
Yeah. And I've seen it.

871
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,098
It was at Joe McAlister's barn.

872
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,867
When Big Jim learns about the egg,

873
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,869
he thinks that that's the key to the dome.

874
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:39,039
Maybe if you get this thing,

875
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,108
you could bring down the dome.

876
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,710
He doesn't want the dome to come down yet.

877
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:45,078
He hasn't yet exercised

878
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,947
all his power or his ambition.

879
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:50,117
He wants to have control of that egg.

880
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:55,956
Linda?

881
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,591
The radio station's on fire.

882
00:35:57,593 --> 00:35:58,825
Could it be arson?

883
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:00,794
No idea.

884
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:02,762
It's Barbie.

885
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:04,331
We've been broadcasting info

886
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,532
about him night and day.

887
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:06,600
I'd be careful, Linda.

888
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:09,803
If you find Barbie, you call me.

889
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:11,905
The entire town was looking for Barbie.

890
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:14,774
And he needed help to
save Julia from Big Jim.

891
00:36:14,776 --> 00:36:17,377
Julia's still at the
clinic. Now, if she wakes up,

892
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:18,445
he's gonna kill her.

893
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:19,980
Wh... why?

894
00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:21,114
Because if she tells people

895
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:22,949
that it wasn't actually me that shot her,

896
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:24,217
his whole story falls apart.

897
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:26,052
So help me save Julia.

898
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:27,721
With Angie's help,

899
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:30,757
Barbie took Julia to safety.

900
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:34,060
I love you.

901
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:36,729
Drive fast!

902
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:42,869
Put your hands on your head!

903
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:44,437
With Barbie in custody,

904
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:48,007
Big Jim went looking for the egg.

905
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,943
What the hell?

906
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:52,178
But Joe and Norrie were one step ahead.

907
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,080
Where is it?

908
00:36:54,082 --> 00:36:56,816
We have no idea what you're talking about.

909
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:58,551
They had moved the egg.

910
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:02,021
And now found the butterfly
was ready to hatch.

911
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:02,955
It's really happening.

912
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:05,024
When, uh, the monarch hatched,

913
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:08,294
- they didn't know how to get it out.
- What the hell?

914
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:12,098
Every time its wings
touched the invisible dome,

915
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,867
It would cause a black color to appear.

916
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,602
Is it just me or is it
getting crazy dark outside?

917
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:19,672
The black spots began to also cover

918
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:21,707
the big dome outside

919
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:27,046
until Chester's Mill was in total darkness.

920
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:29,181
So, now what?

921
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:30,182
Junior soon found them.

922
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:32,184
And was forced to make a decision.

923
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:34,987
Things are happening, Junior!

924
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,389
Do you want your dad
to lock that thing away

925
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:39,158
before it can give us any answers?

926
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,527
Let's go.

927
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:44,897
When Julia woke up, there
was no time to waste.

928
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,332
Where's Barbie?

929
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:49,435
I guess everyone's out
dealing with the blackout.

930
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:51,036
And with everybody distracted,

931
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:54,540
Julia and Angie freed Barbie.

932
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,575
Angie? Angie McAlister?

933
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:58,243
We're on the move

934
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:00,312
with the mini-dome.

935
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:01,347
Joe!

936
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,549
Thank God!

937
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,052
- Don't take another step.
- Junior, stop!

938
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:09,188
No! This guy's a psychopath!

939
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,789
Hey, is that supposed to do that?

940
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,359
The four hands don't
know why they were chosen.

941
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:16,328
And they were desperate to figure out a way

942
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,896
to release this monarch.

943
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:19,865
And maybe make the dome go away.

944
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,575
It opens the mini-dome,
now we have the egg,

945
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:33,879
and the butterfly is up floating around.

946
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,582
Okay.

947
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:38,984
Another piece to the puzzle.

948
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,118
You're the monarch.

949
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,653
What do we do?

950
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:42,888
We have to take that egg
to the real authorities.

951
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,156
Like Big Jim?

952
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:46,391
No, we are not taking
anything to that monster.

953
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:48,960
I'm done listening to
you all run down my dad.

954
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:52,097
He's the only thing
keeping this town together.

955
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,566
Hand it over, Julia.

956
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:56,468
Run!

957
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,504
Once again, Barbie sacrificed
himself to protect his friends.

958
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,973
Barbie! Go!

959
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,442
Get up!

960
00:39:04,444 --> 00:39:07,279
You're done!

961
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:09,381
As the authorities searched for the egg,

962
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:12,617
What the hell does "The pink
stars are falling in lines" mean?

963
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,886
Big Jim learned of his late wife's

964
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:17,021
mysterious connection

965
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,456
It's like she knew all
this was gonna happen.

966
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,457
How is that possible?

967
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,292
I don't know.

968
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:23,328
If your wife saw the dome coming,

969
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,663
that means your family's important.

970
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:27,432
That means you're important.

971
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,700
Big Jim starts to believe
that maybe their family

972
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:30,201
was kind of ordained

973
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:32,270
in some way to deal with this dome.

974
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:34,772
You and I need to do what nobody else

975
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:36,708
in Chester's Mill can.

976
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,743
We need to make the hard decisions,

977
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:42,080
act on them and lead.

978
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:43,781
Big Jim Rennie

979
00:39:43,783 --> 00:39:45,583
with a message for Julia Shumway.

980
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:48,820
Big Jim says to her, "Give me
the egg or Barbie's gonna die."

981
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:51,422
Fail to comply within the hour,

982
00:39:51,424 --> 00:39:53,524
and Barbie pays the ultimate price.

983
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:55,560
It's everyone or it's him.

984
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:58,463
That's a really impossible
decision to make.

985
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,764
We have to help him.

986
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:03,434
How do we protect Chester's
Mill and save Barbie?

987
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:04,902
We can't.

988
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:07,371
She's willing to

989
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:08,706
make the hard choice.

990
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,375
This has to be my decision.

991
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:14,145
Big Jim had made himself

992
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,847
judge, jury and executioner.

993
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,283
Today Chester's Mill

994
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:22,420
sentences Dale Barbara to death.

995
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:25,656
With Barbie moments away from hanging,

996
00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:27,611
Julia did her part

997
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:30,481
to protect the egg.

998
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:36,687
Something's about to go down.

999
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:38,088
If there's pink stars in the sky,

1000
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,490
something is about to happen.

1001
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:41,692
Big Jim thinks

1002
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:44,194
it's telling him that
he's doing the right thing

1003
00:40:44,196 --> 00:40:45,529
to kill Barbie.

1004
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,031
Clearly the Good Lord
has looked upon our work

1005
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:48,432
here today with favor.

1006
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:51,368
Junior very much wants
to do the right thing,

1007
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,604
but it's a big, big sign, and he can't help

1008
00:40:53,606 --> 00:40:56,740
but think, do I kill this man or see what

1009
00:40:56,742 --> 00:40:58,442
the dome will reveal to him?

1010
00:41:00,845 --> 00:41:03,714
Did we make the wrong choice,

1011
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:05,149
and the pink stars and the glowing dome,

1012
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:07,084
is it actually gonna wipe us all out?

1013
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:09,019
Now, son! Do it now!

1014
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:10,220
Do we kill him? Do we not kill him?

1015
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:11,421
What is this light?

1016
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:13,523
It is a very tense moment.

1017
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:14,791
The stakes are very high.

1018
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:16,760
Now, Junior! Do it now!

1019
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:21,628
CBS Monday...

1020
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,931
Something awful is happening out there.

1021
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:25,999
... Under the Dome returns.

1022
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:27,534
There has been no official statement

1023
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:29,636
on reported abnormal magnetic activity.

1024
00:41:29,638 --> 00:41:33,340
And not everyone will survive.

1025
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:35,208
Oh, my God! My mom's in there!

1026
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,414
Now, an exclusive scene from
next week's season premiere,

1027
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:39,299
written by Stephen King.

1028
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,334
- Whoa!
- Whoa, watch out!

1029
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,271
She hit her head!

1030
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:45,472
Mom.

1031
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,810
Get down!

1032
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:57,373
Let's get her up! Ready?

1033
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,908
Whoa, look out!

1034
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:03,213
Hurry! That door!

1035
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,484
What do we do?!

1036
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:10,153
- Get the table!
- Okay.

1037
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:16,326
Watch her arm! Let's get
it, let's get it, yeah!

1038
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:19,162
Whoa!

1039
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,596
What is happening?!

1040
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:22,165
It's pulling all the nails out!

1041
