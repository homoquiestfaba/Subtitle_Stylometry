1
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,176
Now you all know the rules.

2
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,612
They're over a thousand years old.

3
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,546
And l want you to concentrate
very hard on those rules.

4
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,563
Now...

5
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,396
...is everyone ready for the off?

6
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,563
Put them on,

7
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,196
- before they melt too much.
- Your Majesty.

8
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,674
Have you all picked your runners?

9
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:19,470
Yes.

10
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,410
l want every grandchild in this room
to make as much racket as you can.

11
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,482
That one is mine, the one by the fire.

12
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,084
And that one is mine.

13
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,514
And that one is mine.

14
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,185
Ah, Johnnie, have you picked one?
Not too late.

15
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,324
Better hurry up, though, they're off.

16
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,417
All of them are mine.

17
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,154
We'll have that one, then.
l'll choose.

18
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,298
Look, they've started.

19
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,459
- Come on. Oh, please, come on.
- Please. Please, faster.

20
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,694
Mine's not going. Faster.

21
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,566
Why is mine not winning?

22
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,036
l'm gaining, l'm gaining.

23
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,232
lt's by the fire, that's not fair.

24
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,539
- Come on, faster. Come on.
- Gain speed, please. Come on.

25
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:58,376
Faster, come on, keep going. Keep going.

26
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,510
lt's not fair. Mine should be winning.

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,260
Oh, Johnnie.
How have you managed to do that?

28
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,561
The party's about to start and look at you.

29
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,597
Grandpapa has butter on him.

30
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,537
Grandpapa has butter all over him.

31
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,840
Now, Johnnie,

32
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,373
you will manage at the party?

33
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,918
You don't feel too tired?

34
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,515
Are you sure?

35
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,927
You promise me?

36
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,703
Your Royal Highness.
We had a little problem but it's gone now.

37
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,480
The Queen has come down already.

38
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,283
So we will be starting on time this year.

39
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,785
lt's nice -- what you're wearing mama.

40
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,725
Grandmama will be wearing a prettier dress.

41
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,326
And that is how it should be.

42
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,465
Your Majesty, a little something
to add to your collection.

43
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,166
Oh, what is this?

44
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,003
Oh, goodness.

45
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,479
Every birthday she gets the same thing,

46
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:42,113
and manages to sound surprised
when she opens the parcel.

47
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,085
lsn't it lovely?

48
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,160
l've never understood
what she sees in those little animals

49
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,054
can't do anything with them.

50
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,122
... there's my giraffe.

51
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,093
Oh, dear,
we've all managed to bring her the same thing.

52
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,236
Oh, look -- l've got three giraffes now.

53
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,500
Got a clockwork hippopotamus one year,

54
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,707
which l liked.

55
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,036
But l tried to wind it up and broke it.

56
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,808
lf only l could make this disappear

57
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,219
and come back as a totally different present.

58
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,162
lt's my first time as a guest here, you know.
lt's quite exciting.

59
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,362
All the clocks are set half an hour fast.

60
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,935
never expected to see
all the ladies smoking here,

61
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,504
it's -- it's marvellous.

62
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,170
Oh, look, how beautiful.

63
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,116
Your Majesty, it's absolutely splendid.

64
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,820
lt's little fishes.

65
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,081
Extraordinary cake.

66
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,725
No.

67
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,672
There came a bark that blowing forward
bore King Arthur

68
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,873
like modern gentlemen of stateliest port.

69
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,985
And all the people cried;

70
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,384
''Arthur is come again, he cannot die''.

71
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,581
And those that stood upon
the hills behind repeated;

72
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,718
''Come with all good things
and war shall be no more''.

73
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,291
At this a hundred bells began to peel,

74
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,728
but with the sound l woke

75
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:39,668
and heard indeed the clear church bells
ring in the Christmas morn.

76
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,336
Bravo.

77
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,882
We're getting the oldest
and the youngest today, l see.

78
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,644
l'm not the youngest.

79
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,786
Johnnie is here, you've forgotten him.

80
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,291
l'm sure next year
he'll be doing something too.

81
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,885
(Nuit de joie) by Victor

82
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,231
Hugo.

83
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,209
Johnnie, keep still.

84
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,276
Keep still.

85
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,015
Remember.

86
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,225
Johnnie, keep still.

87
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,467
lsn't the Tsarina going to fish as well?

88
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,873
Georgie.

89
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,047
Why can't l go down?
Just for a moment.

90
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,689
You will see your cousins when
they come to tea, Johnnie. l promise.

91
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:43,294
Nobody can have given them any advice about
where to catch big fish on the lsle of Wight.

92
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,054
We should go and help them, Lalla,

93
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,594
tell them they won't catch anything there.

94
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,298
l'm sure the Emperor doesn't need
any fishing lessons from you, Georgie.

95
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,137
Don't they look perfectly splendid, Johnnie?

96
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,981
They're late.

97
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,228
Extremely late.

98
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,890
My apologies, my dear fellow.

99
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,121
l thought for a moment
we had come to the wrong place.

100
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,815
Charming. Absolutely charming.

101
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,950
Everything is in miniature, isn't it?

102
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,428
How marvellous to have something so small.

103
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,364
No, l have to stop, l'm afraid.

104
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,842
l have the wrong shoes.

105
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:44,049
Because underfoot, well, you can see underfoot
it's not quite right for these shoes.

106
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,310
lt's really quite dry. You see?

107
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,850
Er, it couldn't be drier, in fact.

108
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,580
lt's impossible.

109
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,786
l can't take another step in these shoes.

110
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:01,195
l don't think we have time to send somebody back
to the yacht for some other shoes.

111
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,296
l mean, of course we can,

112
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,797
it's perfectly possible if you want.

113
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,407
That won't be necessary.

114
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,339
l am sure there are some overshoes here.

115
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,038
Overshoes?

116
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,576
Your Royal Highness.

117
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,614
Have we got shoes?

118
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:20,648
Yes, sir.

119
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,651
But have you got the right shoes?

120
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,361
Bloody ridiculous.

121
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,825
lt's absolutely dry out there.

122
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,935
lf you like animals,
we will bring you a bear from Russia.

123
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,375
Or maybe a tiger from Siberia.

124
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,141
Or maybe both.

125
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,673
l can't get over how different everything seems.

126
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,445
Even Osborne seems to
have got a little smaller.

127
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:36,017
l used to visit our grandmother,
and also it was a real surprise to me

128
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,655
there are so many houses
belonging to other people so close.

129
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,836
Excuse me.

130
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,280
Are you comfortable like that?

131
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,680
Um, well, um, l'm not sure.

132
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,616
Can you bear it, my darling,
if we do this picture first?

133
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,730
Or maybe we should do
a photograph with you in it first?

134
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,361
What do you think, my darling?

135
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,798
That's the way you behave
when you're an absolute monarch, is it?

136
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,064
Or maybe it isn't the right time
for any photograph at all?

137
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,841
Maybe -- that's what it is.

138
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,732
Your mother is having such a time
with those children.

139
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,469
l've never seen her
have such a time with any children.

140
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,156
He looks like an Emperor fish.

141
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,892
He said he looks like an Emperor fish.

142
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,939
Now how do you think it affected
the power of the barons?

143
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,417
A plague across the entire country.

144
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,316
Can anyone tell me that?

145
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,560
l will tell you what happened
with the Black Death.

146
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:58,199
lt had a devastating effect
on everything it touched.

147
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,572
And where do you think you're going?

148
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,512
We're just going up to the big house.

149
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,217
We can go on our own.

150
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,086
We don't need anyone with us.

151
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,469
Ma'am.

152
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,142
All these new policemen.

153
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,477
l'm not sure l like finding them
all over the garden.

154
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,237
Johnnie. Johnnie!

155
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,274
You know you can't take that upstairs.

156
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,581
l had no idea they'd been put away up there.

157
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,450
They're going to take ages to lay out.

158
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,693
So, Georgie, your time playing with them
will have to be very short.

159
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,022
Only fifteen minutes at the most.

160
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,755
Oh, at the very most.

161
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:41,838
So, our commander is Sir Thomas Whitney Whatney
with his three-legged horse.

162
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:47,243
And that very small and very fat old chap
there is the commander of the French Army.

163
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,005
l thought l heard voices.

164
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,172
Ah, you've got the soldiers out.

165
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,944
- Your Majesty.
- My word.

166
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,417
Well, let's see what you can do with them.

167
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,512
Now who's got the best position?

168
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,849
Oh, there you are, papa.

169
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,890
l was just coming along to our meeting.

170
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,662
Am l a little early?

171
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,095
You've got the soldiers out.

172
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,726
l hope you're not playing between countries.
Are you?

173
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,703
You know my rules about that.

174
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,174
l told them they had to play between planets,
not between nations.

175
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,718
The armies are from Mars or Jupiter,
that sort of thing.

176
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,886
Never the French or the Germans.

177
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,729
Have you been playing with the French?

178
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,858
Answer me.

179
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,897
No, papa. We haven't been doing that, papa.

180
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,671
The armies are from...

181
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,543
Saturn and Jupiter.

182
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,912
We have been playing with foreigners.

183
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:01,610
l told you not to do that! Never!

184
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,251
Well, at the least the boy's honest.

185
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,258
Honest Johnnie.

186
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:11,588
Now that we've got this far,
we might as well help them.

187
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,129
Now stay there, boy,

188
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,624
l need help.

189
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,965
Oh. God... that was difficult.

190
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,739
must be getting old, mustn't l?

191
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,966
Now, they're the French, are they?

192
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,635
Certainly look like the French.

193
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:33,011
Ah, when l was a boy,
the battles l had with these soldiers, eh.

194
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,552
l fought battles in the desert,
in the jungle, in the snow.

195
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,024
Let's see if l'm as good now as l was.

196
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,554
Everyone ready?

197
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,792
Let's see who can get their men
in the best position.

198
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,454
Right, Johnnie, we're this side.

199
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,760
Now get the cavalry lined up here.

200
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,268
The Dragoons need to be in
an anterior position down there.

201
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,601
We are very late now.

202
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,380
Goodness, if l had known
how long it was going to take,

203
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,277
l wouldn't have agreed to us coming.

204
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,645
My father gave me a good thrashing
every time l was late.

205
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,981
lt was the best thing that ever happened to me.

206
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,095
Georgie -- go back to the cottage.

207
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,725
We'll join you in a few minutes.

208
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,802
Johnnie?

209
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,747
You will be fine. We'll find somewhere to go.

210
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,915
Everything will be fine.

211
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,960
We'll soon be there.

212
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,558
Good evening.

213
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,496
- Good evening. - Good evening.

214
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,938
- Oh, excuse me. - Oh. Sorry.

215
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,073
Good evening.

216
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,011
Good evening, young man.

217
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,275
Good evening.

218
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,245
We are just coming.

219
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,847
The boy is upset about something.

220
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,914
You will close the door and leave us.

221
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,034
Nobody else will discover us now.

222
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,994
Nobody will see this.

223
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:14,075
And tonight... we'll say our prayers twice.

224
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,879
Maybe there won't be another one
for a very long time.

225
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,346
Lalla.

226
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:30,556
Where have you been, Lalla?

227
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,287
l have been wondering why you are so late.

228
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,762
We were just a tiny bit longer
than we expected, ma'am.

229
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,498
This young man has got a cold.

230
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,903
He was sneezing and coughing so very much.

231
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,231
lt's like a little engine, he was.

232
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,007
But he's so much better now.

233
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,641
Good, Johnnie.

234
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,937
l'm glad to hear you're better.

235
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,852
Oh, she's got ears like a bat, your mother.

236
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,893
The very best ears l have ever come across.

237
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,879
l'm not hitting nearly as much as l usually do.

238
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,077
What's happening?

239
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,216
Don't understand it.

240
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,915
What's wrong?

241
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:40,395
One of the greatest pleasures of my life
and today l hate it.

242
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,563
Meaningless, completely meaningless.

243
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,367
Never thought l'd feel that.

244
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,803
And if l no longer enjoy shooting,

245
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,537
what have l got to look forward
to each night when l go to bed?

246
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,472
l don't recognise half of them.

247
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,945
Did l really invite some of these people?

248
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:09,257
Why am l so angry
that they're here today with me?

249
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,706
Your Majesty, l am so sorry we're late.

250
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,907
The motor got stuck in the mud.

251
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,178
About time they got a feel for shooting.

252
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,717
Children. Children.

253
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:23,257
Look, the silly man's got
food stuck in his beard.

254
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,029
Yes.

255
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:32,341
You can make the food
you don't like disappear, can't you?

256
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,946
Johnnie, it's time for you to sit down now.

257
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,450
Have you ever shot a crocodile, grandpapa?

258
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,088
Oh, l have indeed.

259
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,652
But not today. Not today.

260
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,023
After lunch you will all shoot a crocodile each.

261
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,458
Don't be silly, Johnnie.

262
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,257
Don't be ridiculous.

263
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,129
The ladies will shoot tigers after lunch,

264
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,827
and the men crocodiles.

265
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:10,511
You know, there was a time when l was
one of the best shots in England.

266
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:17,452
But today -- l couldn't hit a single thing.

267
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,425
Maybe it's because you're so old, grandpapa.

268
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,067
The boy's right.

269
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:40,341
That boy is always right.

270
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,449
lt won't be long, Johnnie.

271
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,719
Look up. Look up.

272
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,451
Can you see the comet coming?

273
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,796
ls that it up there?

274
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,799
Any moment it will come, l'm sure.

275
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,371
A bright light in a great rush.

276
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,537
We should be able to see it already.

277
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,647
l don't think it's coming.

278
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:33,491
Why isn't the engine started?
We have to hurry, for God's sake.

279
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,425
Look, mama and papa.

280
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,266
Will it start?

281
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,194
They must have been called to the palace.

282
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,896
Maybe grandpapa is worse.

283
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,300
Something's wrong with it.

284
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,099
The comet is coming and grandpapa is dying.

285
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,513
ls it an omen?

286
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,420
Johnnie. Johnnie, wake up.

287
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,168
Do you know what that means?

288
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,906
You are the son of the King now.

289
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,376
We both are. We both are, Johnnie.

290
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,478
These will not be seen again.

291
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,410
l'm not sure about the boots.

292
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,751
The boots are very tight.

293
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,656
God give me strength for this.

294
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,226
Well, no.

295
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,966
These are my mother's.

296
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,104
These will not do at all.

297
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,951
Am l a little late?

298
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,291
Ma'am.

299
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,045
Mama, we are over an hour late already.

300
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,742
Oh, don't fret, my dear.

301
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,717
l'm always at least an hour late.

302
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,719
That's what people expect... from me.

303
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,184
No, these will definitely not fit me.

304
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,836
May l join you?

305
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,872
And Johnnie wants to too.

306
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,807
Of course. You look very smart, young man.

307
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,379
Johnnie, come and join us.

308
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:00,621
lt would be better if all the people
over there weren't in black.

309
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,632
Mmm. You know who that is?

310
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,165
Can you see him?

311
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,237
Standing just by that doorway.

312
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,870
Cousin Bill, the Emperor of Germany.

313
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,001
And how about -- this one?

314
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,580
The person there. He's just moved.

315
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,182
The one by that column.

316
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,712
The King of Greece. Papa's uncle.

317
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,152
And there's Uncle Fritz.

318
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:30,651
The Grand Duke of -- Mac...
l nearly got it.

319
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,697
The Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

320
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,362
Who's the one making all the fuss?

321
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:41,403
That is the Grand Duke
Michael Michailovitch of Russia.

322
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,165
He's a member of your family.

323
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:47,805
He's just moving over now to talk to
His Serene Highness the Duke of Teck,

324
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,640
who's another of your relations.

325
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,178
Johnnie, it's all of the family together.

326
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,117
Why are they all fidgeting?

327
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,851
l think somebody has called
them much too early.

328
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,490
l wonder who decides
which carriages go first?

329
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,169
And who walks behind the coffin.

330
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,102
Do you have to arrange that?

331
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,442
Oh, no, not today. You don't run today.

332
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,117
Where are you running, young man?

333
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,611
l've got something to do.

334
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,255
You don't know who l am?

335
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,650
Let me think.

336
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,189
You and l have not met but l know who you are.

337
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,561
l'm your cousin Bill.

338
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,263
We are preparing to say goodbye
to your grandfather.

339
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,477
l myself feel great sorrow
because l loved your grandfather.

340
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,237
The whole of Germany loved him.

341
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,472
He was my family after all.

342
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:03,782
So now you understand, we don't want
to do anything to disturb the family

343
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,116
or the proceedings, now do you?

344
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,727
No, l won't disturb them, sir.

345
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,231
My dearest, l am so glad to be here

346
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:59,604
so l can express my great sorrow
personally to all the family

347
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,540
and most of all to you.

348
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,482
lt's not because of you we're having
to wait for such a long time, is it?

349
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,144
Of course not.

350
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:13,083
Well, l have no idea why
we're being made to wait.

351
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,308
He had a very bad turn, ma'am.

352
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,211
l thought it best to wait to tell you
until after the funeral.

353
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,217
Mama.

354
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,061
We will make sure the doctors see him tomorrow.

355
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,447
You must make sure there is
somebody with him at all times.

356
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,579
Of course, ma'am.
l am usually with him all of the time.

357
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,481
lt was just today because it was a special day,

358
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,180
he was with his brother.

359
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,859
lt is even more important
when there are other people around.

360
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,861
Now, John,

361
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:39,161
can you arrange the animals
in the order of their size?

362
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:44,906
lf you put the biggest one first,
and the smallest one last.

363
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,175
Can you do that for me?

364
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,076
The biggest?

365
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,516
Please carry on, gentlemen.

366
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,928
l will just sit here.

367
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:15,829
Ma'am, we've asked John to arrange
these animals in order of size.

368
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:20,501
The whale, and then
all the way to the insects.

369
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,670
There, now, we've given you a big clue,
young man.

370
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,276
Now let's see you try again.

371
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:57,336
l used to have a spider.
l used to keep it.

372
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,185
Come on, Johnnie. Please.

373
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,089
Come on, Johnnie. Play.

374
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,093
Come on, Johnnie, do something.

375
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:27,570
Ma'am, it is clear his brain has not
continued to grow as it should,

376
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,772
showing it must have suffered
some damage at some stage.

377
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:36,881
And, er, the description of the fits
clearly indicates epilepsy.

378
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,750
- Further tests will be necessary, of course.
- Yes, of course.

379
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,653
But we have to prepare ourselves.

380
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:46,559
lt is more than possible that
John's natural life may be cut short.

381
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,760
The brain is very unlikely to develop further.

382
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,799
l can assure you, gentlemen,

383
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,103
that Johnnie is not an imbecile.

384
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,240
The brain is damaged, ma'am,

385
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,642
whatever label we use.

386
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,470
We are recommending complete isolation.

387
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,442
Complete, ma'am.

388
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,480
Where he can be given
round the clock supervision.

389
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,618
John will have regular fits,

390
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,713
and for anybody witnessing those fits,

391
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:16,191
whether it is the immediate family or,
or people outside the family,

392
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:20,853
the effect will be most traumatic
for anybody witnessing those.

393
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,362
For the child and for the family this is best.

394
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,260
A quiet place.

395
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,400
A fit in public, ma'am, would not be...

396
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,690
No, no, l'm quite happy
to be right at the back.

397
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,454
No, do not alarm yourself.

398
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,966
l'm quite content with
my position here at the back.

399
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,866
One moment, please.

400
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,474
l'm sorry, one moment.

401
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,973
l think l need a glass of water.

402
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,845
Johnnie? l thought you were with mama.

403
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,850
lt has subsided sufficiently.

404
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,650
Your Majesties.

405
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,029
Well, it's very clean.

406
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,630
So this will be your new room, Johnnie,

407
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,565
and l will be next door.

408
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:12,999
lt's only a few weeks
until the family will be coming down,

409
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,874
and then you'll all be together again.

410
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,774
For a little while at least.

411
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,588
l think l should have my own bit of garden.

412
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,687
We'll start to make my garden somewhere here.

413
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,092
...feast his neighbour,

414
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,767
And say ''Tomorrow is Saint Crispian;''

415
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,802
Then will he strip his sleeve
and show his scars,

416
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,806
And say, ''These wounds l had on Crispin's day.''

417
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,704
Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,

418
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,677
But he'll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day;

419
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,679
then shall our names
Familiar in his mouth as household words,

420
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,420
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,

421
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,184
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,

422
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,817
ln their flowing cups freshly remember'd.

423
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,498
This story shall the good man teach his son;

424
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,430
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,

425
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,036
From this day to the ending of the world,

426
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,929
But we in it shall be remember'd;

427
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:22,302
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;

428
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:36,955
He is asleep.

429
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,286
Mama?

430
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,529
Go to sleep, Johnnie.

431
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,141
Will this work, this arrangement?

432
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:02,284
Oh, yes, ma'am, it will work,
l promise you. l will make it work.

433
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,886
l will be here with him all the time.

434
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,579
Are you quite sure that is all that is needed?

435
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,488
Nothing else is needed, ma'am, it really isn't.

436
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,164
lt must be understood that any visitors,

437
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,967
either coming here to the cottage
orjust walking in the garden,

438
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,872
no visitors at all must be allowed to see him.

439
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,736
For their sake and his.

440
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,740
ls, is that any visitor at all, is it, ma'am?

441
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,212
Yes.

442
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,632
Don't worry, l will always be here.

443
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,629
l'm making a garden.

444
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,028
l can't see it, Johnnie, it's night now.

445
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:59,608
lt's not very much at the moment,
but l'm sure it will be.

446
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,308
l will never let them send you away.

447
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:27,135
So, now, we come again to the
outbreak of the Black Death.

448
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:32,501
Can you tell me the name of one of the
more important victims of the Black Death?

449
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,969
Can anybody tell me that?

450
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,472
Johnnie, we have done this again and again.

451
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,174
l really must insist on an answer.

452
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,946
Give me any kind of answer.

453
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,820
l don't like the Black Death.

454
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:48,981
l give up.

455
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:51,992
There's nothing more l can do.

456
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,694
l thought you were going to teach him
some family history.

457
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,232
Johnnie likes that.

458
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,495
Oh, for goodness sake,
l can't just teach him the last few years.

459
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,195
He needs to know it all.

460
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,231
And he knows nothing.

461
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,774
And l'm locked up here.

462
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,809
l'm as much shut away as he is.

463
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,109
Nobody listens to me.

464
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,922
Nobody could care less!

465
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,325
Nobody knows, nobody cares!

466
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,492
Come along, faster than that.

467
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:29,956
Come on, you're hardly out of breath.

468
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,123
Come on, Georgie, keep up.

469
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,896
l am keeping up. l'm walking.

470
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:37,700
Faster.

471
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,639
Why did you speed up every time
we caught up with you?

472
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:46,841
Come on, Georgie, don't be so slow.
You're always at the back.

473
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:49,976
Please, once more.

474
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,383
l could hardly keep up towards the end.

475
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:59,729
Well done.

476
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:04,765
Excellent.

477
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,280
So, everyone in again.

478
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,675
My turn to go in the front.

479
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,279
Just once, Georgie, just once.

480
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,818
Then it's my turn.

481
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:44,731
l, er, l never see that nice
little chap Johnnie any more.

482
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,305
Always busy with his lessons, is he?

483
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,109
Hang on to your hats.

484
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,716
Johnnie, your garden's really
very impressive indeed now.

485
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:08,096
Johnnie, it's time for us to go in now.

486
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,534
Before the guests from the big house
come out into the garden.

487
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,570
Come quickly!

488
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,732
There's been another accident in the kitchen.

489
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,635
Milly. She's cut herself.

490
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,279
Oh, not again. l don't believe it.

491
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,889
Bring Johnnie in now, Georgie.

492
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,868
Come on, l'll show you some of my best plants.

493
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,831
This is splendid, Johnnie.

494
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,274
Good. Just a little further up the path.

495
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,748
Not these ones. Not much further.

496
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,478
They just couldn't believe what they saw.

497
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,618
The King and Queen in that house.

498
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,686
Amazing, isn't it, eh?

499
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,321
D'you know who that is?

500
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:15,565
Wouldn't look out of place
in Norwood or Surbiton, would it, eh?

501
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:16,960
A very old General.

502
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,993
No, don't be silly, Johnnie.

503
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:20,931
He's the Prime Minister.

504
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:25,165
And his mother all alone in the big house.
She won't move out.

505
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:28,570
His advisors beg him
to give the place up, so do we.

506
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,107
l mean, what do you think
foreigners make of it?

507
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,250
They come to visit the King
on his country estate,

508
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:38,320
and find him squashed into one of the
most suburban dwellings in the land.

509
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,179
The King won't hear a word against it.

510
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,793
Another thing they love to do

511
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,863
is fill every room they use...
with photographs of their family.

512
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:51,034
Hundreds of different photographs staring at you,
you can't get away from them.

513
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,662
Let's cut across here.

514
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,299
You go in, Johnnie, l'll be back later.

515
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:59,127
Hello. What are you doing
through there, young man?

516
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,366
Who are you?

517
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,408
l'm Johnnie.

518
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,380
l've just left my garden.

519
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,950
Well, good afternoon, Johnnie.

520
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,577
lsn't it a blissful day?

521
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,580
The most perfect garden.

522
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,185
The most perfect day.

523
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,211
Wild West stories, how lovely.

524
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,944
No, no, no, it is my normal reading matter.

525
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,250
Really?

526
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:52,748
Absolutely.

527
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:57,749
You'll be surprised quite how many of these
l devour in a month.

528
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,225
l love to look at the pictures,

529
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,524
just like a small boy.

530
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,966
Are you here with your husband?

531
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:07,899
No.

532
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,403
Oh. Your mother?

533
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,637
Yes.

534
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,578
Choose one for me, Georgie.

535
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:21,978
Careful now, careful now.

536
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,710
You know which one l like.

537
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:27,583
The little pink ones, yeah, that's right.

538
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,088
That's a clever boy. Thank you.

539
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:34,430
Not bad, are they -- the grounds at the moment.

540
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,167
Did you see what's been done by the lake?

541
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,732
lt all looks splendid.

542
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:43,896
We walked all the way to York Cottage -
a charming view, as always.

543
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,634
Mr Asquith, l'm sure this is a very
misguided question, a silly thought,

544
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,507
but l heard somebody say the other day
there could be a war before Christmas.

545
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:52,978
Not as far as we know.

546
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,309
Nobody's had the courtesy to tell us.

547
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,748
Put it out of your mind, please.

548
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:02,390
There is no conceivable way that we'd
agree to participate in a war in Europe.

549
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,287
No forseeable circumstances.

550
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,929
l would be totally opposed to our involvement,

551
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,129
and so would the Prime Minister.

552
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:13,127
Because they're our family?
ls that the reason?

553
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,235
Not France, of course,
but the other heads of state.

554
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,603
He's an absolute devil
with his questions, that boy.

555
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,136
ls that the reason?

556
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:26,815
l think we'll just say
how could we argue with that.

557
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,416
That's absolutely true.

558
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,926
Who's that child over there?

559
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,267
l thought for a moment
it was some sort of animal watching us.

560
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,235
Oh, it is our son, Johnnie.

561
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,342
lt is a little surprising to see him over here.

562
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,607
He should be at his studies.

563
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,543
Good Lord, why is he out of the cottage?

564
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,493
Hello, young man.

565
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:27,439
You know, mama,
we live in a really stupid house,

566
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,137
which is a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.

567
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,248
What's more is everybody thinks that -

568
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,112
the servants, the foreigners, everyone.

569
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,415
This man with the huge head said so.

570
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,624
Be quiet at once, Johnnie.

571
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:47,024
Our house would not be out of place
in a country called Surbiton or Norwood.

572
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,462
And grandmama, silly old thing,
lives all alone in the big house

573
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,192
when she ought to know better.

574
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,722
Ma'am?

575
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,916
So why was Johnnie alone in the garden?

576
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,158
l got distracted for a moment
and he just slipped out.

577
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,987
l'm so sorry, ma'am.

578
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,656
l thought we had an understanding.

579
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,529
Yes, ma'am, we do.

580
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,571
That Johnnie was not to be left alone,
particularly when there are guests present.

581
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,901
l know, it, it will never happen again.

582
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,509
lt cannot happen again.

583
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,415
l know his father was very angry, too.

584
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,376
When Johnnie was small, it was different,

585
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:47,118
but now these things cannot be allowed.

586
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,381
Yes, ma'am, l know.

587
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:49,955
lf Johnnie cannot be controlled,

588
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:53,960
we may have to consider an institution,
as the doctors advised.

589
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:55,425
That isn't necessary.

590
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,293
ls it, is it, ma'am?

591
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,230
Surely not.

592
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,506
You try very hard with him, Lalla, l do realise.

593
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,672
Each of my children have their strange ways,
l've found.

594
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,937
All children do, l know, yes,

595
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,446
and then as they grow it becomes easier.

596
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:18,080
Johnnie will not grow in that way.

597
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,418
We know that now and we have to accept it.

598
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,186
Um, with respect, ma'am,

599
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,526
l do believe Johnnie can grow.

600
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:30,860
l mean, in his mind. Most certainly he, he can.

601
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,534
There's no sign of it so far, Lalla.

602
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,033
But there will be, ma'am.

603
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,836
l'm sure he won't need to be
shut away for the rest of his life.

604
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,141
He will progress.

605
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,107
He's working so hard at his studies,
he really is.

606
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:53,179
Oh, you two make a fine pair, don't you?

607
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,216
This just won't do.

608
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,820
This just won't do at all.

609
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,262
Johnnie, you can do this sum.

610
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,063
Yes. Yes, you can.

611
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,396
Now... if l have ten jars of blackberry jam

612
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,299
and l take away three...

613
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,638
...how many do l have left?

614
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,018
Johnnie, you are able to do this.

615
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,868
lf you do your arithmetic,
and some of your other lessons,

616
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,769
all sorts of things may happen.

617
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:57,881
And it's the last time l try to teach the boy in
here with you making all your terrible noises.

618
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,616
There is your great grandmother up there.

619
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,421
ln the middle, yes? Now draw.

620
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:10,197
Draw the line going down to show
that the Tsarina is her grand-daughter.

621
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:15,304
A straight line. Straight.
The line must be straight.

622
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,768
That's good, Johnnie.

623
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,737
Now try to do the other one straighter.

624
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,681
l don't know, these drawings are so odd.

625
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:27,744
Look at this one.

626
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,316
The line of succession.

627
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,119
Here are his father and mother,
done almost normally,

628
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,346
and then the children;

629
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,150
Prince Edward David first, Albert George second.

630
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:35,814
Johnnie.

631
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:40,122
So far so good.
But now, why on earth does it go over here?

632
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,421
May and Henry in a funny loop,

633
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,366
and Georgie and John himself right down here
with strange rabbit ears.

634
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,504
lt's a good start.

635
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:49,932
This will end badly for the boy.

636
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:51,901
He needs simple things,

637
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,599
just simple things.

638
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,507
No. No that, that isn't true.
ls it, Johnnie?

639
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,310
No. lt just isn't true at all.

640
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,883
Give us what we want. We will not stop.

641
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:07,386
We will not stop until you listen.
Give women the vote!

642
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,961
They're having difficulty
getting them off, mama.

643
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,924
They'll need to cut them away.

644
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,865
They will manage it, l assure you.

645
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,629
Give women the vote!

646
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,967
We won't have them dangling around for days,

647
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,336
looking at us every time we come out.

648
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:32,109
lt is quite beyond me how people can make
such a spectacle of themselves.

649
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,620
How on earth do they think
this will do them any good?

650
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,895
Smaller.

651
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,501
Now, think about what you're writing.

652
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:59,107
Small letters.

653
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,368
My dear Russian cousins,

654
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,781
Olga, Tatiana, Maria...

655
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,711
...Anastasia and Alexei.

656
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,380
l am writing to you after all these years

657
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,820
because l think of you so often.

658
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,357
l will write about my garden.

659
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,627
My garden is a wonderful place.

660
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,192
l feel very happy sitting inside it.

661
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,296
lt is the best garden that l have ever seen.

662
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,775
Many times at night l think...
of your father swimming

663
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,308
and how funny he looked.

664
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,180
My father will see me soon, l hope.

665
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,048
He is very busy being King at the moment.

666
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,214
l shouldn't be here.

667
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:51,326
This is clearly a bad idea,
a ridiculous notion, trying to do this,

668
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,088
but nothing l could do would make him listen.

669
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,426
But no doubt this young man
would have it all worked out.

670
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,631
Good afternoon.

671
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,540
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

672
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:06,703
Hello.

673
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,103
Why is this such a bad idea?

674
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,980
What have you been overhearing now?

675
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,511
l'm just interested.

676
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:17,480
Your father wanted to see
if he could make a difference,

677
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:22,186
if he could bridge the divide by
bringing together the parties in lreland.

678
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:24,727
So he's holding this... conference.

679
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,260
But people don't think
he can make a difference.

680
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,954
l think that may be the general view, yes.

681
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,364
Your Majesty.

682
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:42,106
Please. Now...

683
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,842
l thought we'd begin...

684
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,783
No, not that one. l, l want the other file.

685
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,687
Now l just have to see...

686
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:04,895
l don't know... we'll just...

687
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,166
Oh, sorry.

688
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,371
l will need a moment...

689
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,216
Are you expecting news, Johnnie?

690
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,218
lt won't be today, Johnnie.

691
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,124
No, it won't be today, Johnnie,

692
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,000
but it will be soon.

693
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,503
lt will definitely be soon.

694
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:02,950
Johnnie.

695
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,192
Johnnie, it's come.

696
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,158
lt has come.

697
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:12,928
lt's the date for you to go to London.

698
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,083
Ah, shall l take that for you?

699
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,087
Thank you.

700
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,139
Now, we are going to go
over a few questions, Johnnie,

701
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,400
so we are prepared. Mmm?

702
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:59,575
lf they produce those
animal cards again, the doctors,

703
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,874
l'm not sure they will,
because you're so much bigger,

704
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,143
but if they produce the animals

705
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:10,586
you will remember the insect
will always be the smallest. Mmm?

706
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,020
lt's quite safe
to put that last every time.

707
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,198
Johnnie, listen to me.

708
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:20,732
Johnnie.

709
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,236
Geography.

710
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,998
They're bound to ask geography questions,

711
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:26,573
and you do know geography.

712
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,843
What is the capital city of France?

713
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:33,337
Paris. Or Paree.

714
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:34,448
Yes, that's right.

715
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:36,915
And the capital of Russia?

716
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,119
St Petersburg. A German name.

717
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:43,087
Yes. You can say,
''My cousin the Tsar lives there''.

718
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,918
That would sound impressive.

719
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:45,617
Yes...

720
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:49,026
...l will say my cousin Bill, the Kaiser,
has a withered arm.

721
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:53,396
No. No. No, don't say that.

722
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,397
l know all the questions.

723
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,535
They will be happy with me, the doctors.

724
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:09,077
Now we are in London,
we must have the blinds drawn.

725
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,483
That was one of the messages
l was sent about this trip.

726
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:14,686
Johnnie?

727
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:58,329
Now, John, we want you to take your time
over every question we ask.

728
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,162
l will not need any time.

729
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,832
Who is the Prime Minister of this country?

730
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,906
The Prime Minister of England.

731
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,210
He's a man with a huge head.

732
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,184
And do you know his name?

733
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:20,284
When l met him,
l was not allowed to say his name

734
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:22,447
because he'd been very rude

735
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,387
and he wanted to remain my friend.

736
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:49,575
The capital city of Russia is St Petersburg,

737
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,378
and my cousins, the Romanovs, live there.

738
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,915
The capital city of Greece is Athens,

739
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,526
and my uncle, the King of Greece, lives there.

740
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,488
The capital of Denmark is Copenhagen,

741
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,723
and my grandmama comes from there.

742
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,870
The capital of Germany, where my cousin Bill,
the Emperor, lives is

743
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:11,666
Er, please, John.
You must wait for the questions.

744
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,439
My name is Prince John.

745
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:20,146
Your Royal Highness, you must allow us to go
through the list of questions we have prepared.

746
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,414
Very well.

747
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,554
While l'm waiting l will get down.

748
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:42,968
This room is not bad. Not bad, gentlemen.

749
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:59,150
This stuffed creature here
is called a scaly anteater,

750
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,881
and it's quite a shy animal.

751
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,758
A shy animal from lndia that lives in holes.

752
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,832
What are you thinking about, young man?

753
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,969
l was just thinking how difficult it must be

754
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,508
to work out where everybody's going to sit
at a banquet like this.

755
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:25,470
What with so many Ambassadors
from all sorts of countries,

756
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,115
and Bishops and Generals coming.

757
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:29,046
Not to mention politicians.

758
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,376
How do you decide?

759
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:35,113
Ah. There are the rules of protocol, of course.

760
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,949
The, er, smaller countries
further down the table,

761
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,787
and then you decide that you might
want to bend the rules a little

762
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:46,367
because you know, for instance, the Russian
Ambassador has a passion for bird-watching

763
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,298
and so does the Duchess of Bedford.

764
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:49,868
l expect you're brilliant at that.

765
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:55,942
Ooh, if nobody takes offence, if the banquet
goes smoothly, then l'll be pleased.

766
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:00,407
always feel a slight flutter
of apprehension as they start.

767
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,709
Apprehension?

768
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,178
What could go wrong?

769
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,344
Johnnie! At last you've come.

770
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,742
George! George.

771
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,628
l had my own car.
l rode in my own motorcar.

772
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:52,527
Yes. And l've managed to see to it
that we're staying here tonight.

773
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:55,926
What do you think?

774
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,540
lt's a great ship -- falling down.

775
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:03,476
Yes. lt's the biggest ship
of the Canadian Pacific Line,

776
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,310
'The Empress of lreland'.

777
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,713
lt collided in the St Lawrence River
with another ship.

778
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,545
lt just happened, two weeks ago.

779
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,477
lt crashed? The boat?

780
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:16,124
Yes. And it was an enormous boat, Johnnie.

781
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,217
Nearly as big a ship as the 'Titanic'.

782
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:20,523
And almost as many people died.

783
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,024
Why are all the big boats
crashing at the moment?

784
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:33,574
l need to get you to bed, Johnnie. Right now.

785
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,313
Her Majesty will see you now.

786
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,609
Ah, there you are, Lalla.

787
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,912
Your Majesty. He did so well.

788
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:50,451
You should have seen him. Seen Johnnie.

789
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,259
You know how he usually finds it difficult,

790
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:56,125
he finds talking a little hard sometimes,
how to reply to people,

791
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,493
well he did it marvellously today, ma'am.

792
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,496
He answered all the questions, and more.

793
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,168
He was quite the proper prince, he was.

794
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:06,240
lt was a wonderful thing to see.
lf only you'd been there, ma'am.

795
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:07,875
Now, slowly, Lalla.

796
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:12,207
l'm sorry, ma'am. l've been waiting to
tell you this and it's rushing out of me.

797
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:13,746
Yes, so l see.

798
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,113
And the doctors?

799
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:19,721
Oh, the doctors were stunned.
l think that's right, they were stunned.

800
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,720
They thought he had made progress, did they?

801
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,515
They said that?

802
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,019
They did seem quite pleased, ma'am.

803
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,654
l really think they were.

804
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:30,559
Of course, l, l don't know what
they'll say in their report to you,

805
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,360
but they must say that.

806
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:33,733
And Johnnie is here now?

807
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:34,801
Yes, ma'am.

808
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,370
He's safely tucked up in his bed fast asleep.

809
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,838
He needed his sleep so much,
he's worked so hard today.

810
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:41,499
Good.

811
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,907
lf you'd heard him, ma'am,
you would have heard something different.

812
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,343
l've never, ever seen him speak like that.

813
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,449
There's still his other illness, Lalla.

814
01:09:56,792 --> 01:10:00,728
The fits. Those will not disappear
and they cannot be wished away.

815
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:04,658
l know. l know,

816
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,934
but we haven't had one for such a while now.

817
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:09,829
For such a while.

818
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,703
Ma'am, l can only tell you what l witnessed.

819
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:17,568
When you next see Prince John, you...

820
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,475
l will see the boy tomorrow.

821
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,474
We have an important occasion tonight.

822
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:26,143
Of course, ma'am. Of course.

823
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,393
l knew you wouldn't be asleep.

824
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,725
They were worried about arriving too late.

825
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,403
And, look, those people
are worried about arriving too early.

826
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:44,970
What silly people.

827
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,038
No, Johnnie,

828
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:49,473
it's because papa's decided to introduce
Sandringham time to here as well.

829
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,540
You know how all the clocks are set
half an hour fast in the big house.

830
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,346
Well now they're doing it here, too,

831
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,275
and nobody knows what time it is.

832
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:01,080
Coming?

833
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,281
Where am l coming?

834
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:03,990
We're going to try and see the banquet.

835
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,959
Johnnie, isn't there one thing we have to do?

836
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:12,999
What?

837
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,398
l think maybe we need
a change of clothes for you.

838
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,471
They have taken my clothes away.

839
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,797
Well, we'll have to see what we can do.

840
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:28,111
lt's charming, isn't it, this clock.

841
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,448
lt has just rejoined the collection.

842
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:36,984
lt had been given away, inappropriately,
as a gift,

843
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,320
but we managed to retrieve it.

844
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:51,864
Oh, Your Majesty.
Please, stop torturing the women.

845
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,372
Why are you torturing the women?

846
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,613
Please, it is our right.

847
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,179
Remove her.

848
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,581
The Queen must listen!

849
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:07,651
There's no need for alarm.

850
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,188
She has to listen.

851
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,222
Give women the vote! We will never give up!

852
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,362
Everything is simply fine.

853
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,630
lt is our right!

854
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,030
Johnnie.

855
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:32,414
l hope this works.

856
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,246
Come on, we're nearly there.

857
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,751
lt'll be worth it, l promise.

858
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:52,091
lt will. l said it would.

859
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:22,529
Now, Johnnie, stand there and
be careful you're not seen.

860
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,504
l think the Generals have got
too many medals on them.

861
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,968
l just want to work out how he's done it.

862
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:42,876
There's the Russian Ambassador next to the Bishop
who never stops talking.

863
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:48,047
And look, Johnnie, Russia's opposite Germany,
cousin Bill's Ambassador.

864
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,029
And the Austrian Ambassador's opposite France.

865
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,766
And look,
Mr Asquith's sitting opposite the Tories

866
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,527
so they can gossip together

867
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:04,703
because politicians only like
talking to each other.

868
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:06,404
lt's a perfect plan.

869
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,943
Everybody pleased with where they've been put.

870
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,069
Careful, Johnnie, we mustn't be seen.

871
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:17,548
Gentlemen.

872
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:20,552
Your Highness. A bit of a hubbub, isn't it?

873
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:21,887
A hubbub indeed.

874
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,156
We'll have to play rather loud tonight.

875
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,260
They seem in a rather excited mood.

876
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,257
And why are they like that, sir?

877
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:29,724
Haven't you heard?

878
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:33,795
There was an incident between
your mother and an intruder.

879
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:37,065
And she was magnificent, the Queen, so they say.

880
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,737
Well, that's what everybody's talking about.

881
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:42,575
Everybody is so thrilled she came to no harm.

882
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,978
Doesn't mama look different. She's smiling.

883
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,519
You will remember, Johnnie,

884
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,220
if the music's too loud,

885
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:55,820
if anything else happens,

886
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,988
if you feel ill, you will tell me at once.

887
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:03,156
l am not ill.

888
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,430
You must tell me as soon as you feel it.

889
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,693
Nothing's going to happen to me.

890
01:15:58,654 --> 01:15:59,621
Were you seen?

891
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,146
Johnnie?

892
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:28,283
Maybe we should leave?

893
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,850
No, l like it.

894
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:53,997
We've got to go, Johnnie. We've got to go now.

895
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,743
Well, we'll have to make
our excuses to His Majesty.

896
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:10,913
Head over to Downing Street.

897
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:16,723
Oh dear, well we shall have to have
this confirmed before we tell the King.

898
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,425
Confirmation is essential.

899
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:25,995
But this news -- this news might
change everything. Everything, gentlemen.

900
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:08,136
There you are, Lalla.

901
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,869
Exactly on time, admirable.

902
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:16,514
This young man here was up very early.

903
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,046
Come here, Johnnie.

904
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:26,351
l hear you did very well
when you saw the doctors.

905
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:29,258
The doctors were funny.

906
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:35,030
And l understand your garden
is making great progress?

907
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,130
You must send me some pressed flowers from it.

908
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,074
Will you do that?

909
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:41,943
Yes, mama.

910
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:45,870
Now, l have some news.

911
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:50,114
Your father wishes to see you,
so we will go...

912
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:00,490
Ma'am -- l just wondered
if you'd like to see these.

913
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,491
Descriptions in the newspapers
of the incident last night.

914
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,028
lf they're nice l'll look at them.

915
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,032
Well, just to pluck one at random.

916
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:14,073
The Times, for instance, says your behaviour was
''a masterpiece of dignity and composure''.

917
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,943
l think l might glance at them, yes.

918
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,204
Thank you.

919
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,508
The others were exceptionally nice, too, ma'am.

920
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:32,758
Also, ma'am, l understand that Johnnie
is to see the King at any moment.

921
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:33,926
Yes.

922
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:38,258
We have received news, ma'am,
which l'm expecting confirmation of,

923
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:44,796
if that comes through
l will need to see the King at once.

924
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:51,145
Johnnie will see the King.
lt's been far too long.

925
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,920
Come in. Come in, Johnnie.

926
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,893
l've got some of my best stamps out.

927
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,665
Here. Some of the finest l've got.

928
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,992
l thought we could have a look at stamps.

929
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:15,933
So come here, child.

930
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:24,338
You see how my collection has grown.

931
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,044
We've got special rooms for it now.

932
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:29,809
Now, look at these ones.

933
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:33,554
There's a whole page from Peru.

934
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:36,289
From Peru, my boy.

935
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,218
Very nice.

936
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:41,293
No, look properly, child.

937
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:42,862
You didn't look for long enough.

938
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,661
This one is very rare.

939
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:48,128
lt's very rare indeed.

940
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,770
And this one is especially pleasing --

941
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,173
it's from Mauritius.

942
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,906
l glance at it every day at the moment.

943
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,844
l come in here and have a look at it.

944
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,311
What are you looking at?

945
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:04,818
Ah, the bird.

946
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,280
Haven't you seen her yet?

947
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:08,220
That's Charlotte.

948
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,352
l let her fly about.

949
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:16,695
Now, what about the Cape of Good Hope?

950
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,293
Have you ever seen a stamp
from the Cape of Good Hope?

951
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:23,397
How much do you think it's worth?

952
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:29,602
Have a guess, to the nearest ten guineas. Mmm?

953
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,736
Sir, my apologies, sir.

954
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:34,772
What? Can't you see l'm busy?

955
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,981
The Prime Minister is on the telephone.

956
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,511
lt is most urgent.

957
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:42,821
Why is he calling at this hour?

958
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,356
l only saw him last night.

959
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:51,692
Johnnie.

960
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:58,163
Have a look at the stamps, Johnnie,

961
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,139
and l'll come back and see
what value you've guessed at.

962
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,917
What do you mean nobody can find him?

963
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:21,020
He is with his father,

964
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:23,521
and the Queen said
they must not be interrupted.

965
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:31,699
Ma'am, Johnnie --
Johnnie must have gone on one of his wanders.

966
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,067
l haven't seen him.

967
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,595
Then we will all go and
look for him together, Lalla.

968
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:42,166
lt's been totally confirmed?

969
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:46,645
The Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated.

970
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,213
Where was it?

971
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,543
Sarajevo.

972
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:53,119
You don't seem very surprised.

973
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:56,055
When did you know about this?

974
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,729
l am beginning to suspect that quite
a few people knew about this before l did.

975
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:20,948
Where is he?

976
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:37,489
My poor child.

977
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,962
Come on, Johnnie. Come on.

978
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,100
ls that what happens?

979
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,204
Lalla's here.

980
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:44,738
l had no idea.

981
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,671
Lalla's here now, it's all right.

982
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:47,603
Poor child.

983
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:48,799
This is my fault.

984
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:51,141
l got him too excited.

985
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,280
He's overtired with everything.

986
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,450
That's it, that's it.

987
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,584
l know it's a shocking thing to see, ma'am,

988
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:03,855
but he'll be so much better
so very, very quickly.

989
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,056
That's my boy. Come on, Johnnie.

990
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:16,631
Come on, Lalla's here. Lalla's here,

991
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,537
that's my boy.

992
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,303
lt's not as bad as it seems, ma'am.

993
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:29,850
lt's not as bad as it seems.

994
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,853
lt's not as bad as it seems.

995
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:46,461
lt's clear there was a deliberate decision
not to tell me last night.

996
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:48,998
That was an absurd decision.

997
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:52,167
lt appears practically everybody knew about it
apart from me.

998
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:54,836
How can l work out what this means?

999
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:59,639
How can l have an opinion on what we should do
if nobody tells me it has happened?!

1000
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,506
They will let you stay with him?

1001
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,709
They're not going to send him away, are they?

1002
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,351
He did so well with the doctors,
just let anybody try.

1003
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:41,315
Where am l going?

1004
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:43,256
Just back to the country, Johnnie.

1005
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,388
lf they think they can take Johnnie away,

1006
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,695
l'll never let them. Never.

1007
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,229
Say goodbye.

1008
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,252
l liked the banquet.

1009
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:16,183
When will they be holding another?
