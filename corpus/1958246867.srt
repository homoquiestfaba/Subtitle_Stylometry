1
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:07,311
(footsteps clicking)

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,379
Let me set things up for you.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,999
It's the future, like,
two weeks from now.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,889
Gas prices are at an all-time high.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,569
Nobody drives anymore,
not even truckers.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,113
And a trucker who doesn't drive,
well, you know.

7
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:29,905
And you know that saying,

8
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:32,979
"If you can't take the heat,
get out of the kitchen"?

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,119
Well, people still say that.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,773
But they don't drive cars.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,453
And teenagers having sex in cars?

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,310
That still happens too, but
in graveyards, car graveyards.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,249
This is a story about a man
who decided to change all that.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,709
It's a story about his invention.

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,249
It's a story about society.

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,883
It's a story about you.

17
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,847
(chips rustling)

18
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:05,598
(chip crunching)

19
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:11,204
(chips crunching)

20
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:17,952
(footsteps clicking)

21
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,453
(lively orchestral music)

22
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:23,376
(title whooshes)

23
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,876
(title thuds)

24
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:43,221
[Man] Oh, yeah!

25
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:44,452
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

26
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:46,479
Oh, yeah, fucking bone me!

27
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,313
Yeah!

28
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:49,058
[Man] Oh, yeah,
you're getting boned, baby!

29
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:49,892
[Woman] Yeah!

30
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:52,559
(woman moaning)

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,062
(text whooshes)

32
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:20,227
(gentle piano music)

33
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:24,159
Then, the Little Blue Engine began to pull.

34
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,067
She tugged and she pulled,
she pulled and she tugged.

35
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,902
Puff puff, chug chug
went the little engine.

36
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,763
"I think I can, I think I can," she said.

37
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:40,603
Slowly, slowly, the train started to move.

38
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,673
The dolls and toys
began to smile and clap.

39
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:47,303
Puff puff, chug chug.

40
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,539
Up the mountain went
the Little Blue Engine.

41
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,085
And all the time, she kept saying,

42
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:57,919
"I think I can, I think
I can, I think I can."

43
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,633
Up, up, up.

44
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:04,609
The little engine climbed and climbed.

45
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,309
At last, she reached
the top of the mountain.

46
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,763
Down below lay the city.

47
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:14,934
"Hurray, hurray!"
cried the dolls and animals.

48
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:18,556
"The boys and girls will be so happy,"
said the toy clown,

49
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:22,859
"all because you helped us,
Little Blue Engine."

50
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,777
The Little Blue Engine just smiled.

51
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:30,958
(school bell rings)

52
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,126
(students chattering)

53
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:45,816
(door clacks)
(door creaks)

54
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:48,234
(door thuds)

55
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,741
(bicycle whirring)

56
00:03:57,742 --> 00:04:00,825
(lively piano music)

57
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,282
Hi, Archie.

58
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:31,606
Hello, Lorraine.

59
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:33,145
Doing all right?

60
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:35,313
Oh, you know, just here.

61
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:37,779
You know?

62
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,515
How's your wheatgrass car coming along?

63
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:42,913
Yeah, it's coming along, I guess.

64
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,973
That's a great shirt.

65
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,270
It's really funny.

66
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,387
Just need some more wheatgrass today.

67
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,310
Did you get a new bike?

68
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:01,355
No, I didn't.

69
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:03,009
$2, right?

70
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,569
Really, it looks different.

71
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,990
Maybe it got a new haircut.

72
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,875
What?

73
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,690
I was just making a joke.

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,182
Yeah.

75
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,183
Yeah.

76
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:20,947
- Bye, Lorraine.
- Yeah.

77
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:23,948
- Take it easy.
- I'll see you later.

78
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:37,822
(bicycle whirring)

79
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:46,139
Hello, Mrs. Butterfield!

80
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:56,528
(birds chirping)

81
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,608
(wheatgrass juice splashing)

82
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,692
(lively piano music)

83
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,234
(electricity crackling)

84
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,184
(fan whirring)

85
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,554
Ah!

86
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,698
(fan rattles)

87
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,282
What?

88
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:21,616
(electricity crackling)

89
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,380
(hand thuds)

90
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,806
(Archie clapping)

91
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:39,724
(chalk scratching)

92
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,689
It all starts with you guys.

93
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,045
You can make the difference.

94
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,849
(school bell rings)
(students chattering)

95
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,450
Don't forget about your letters.

96
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,373
You guys have a good day.

97
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:01,131
(bicycle whirring)

98
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,999
Hey, Archie.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,099
What's up?

100
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,609
How was school?

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,815
Fine.

102
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:20,729
- I need more wheatgrass.
- Hey, I thought of

103
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,023
a great idea for your
wheatgrass engine.

104
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,939
What if you put pedals on it,
like a bike?

105
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,740
Then, you could ride it like a bike.

106
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,103
It's just an idea that I had.

107
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:37,569
$2?

108
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,269
Actually, it's 2.50.

109
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,903
Wheat grass prices are going up.

110
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,096
Are you joking?

111
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,223
No. No kidding.

112
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,079
But hey, for you, $2.

113
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,479
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

114
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,767
You're only like my best customer.

115
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:52,768
I appreciate it.

116
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,149
Hey, Archie, I was thinking,

117
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,579
would you want to maybe
hang out some time?

118
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,740
I'd really like to see
your wheatgrass engine.

119
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,969
It's just an idea, another one-

120
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,452
- I'm real busy.
- That I had.

121
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:12,889
And it's a school night, I guess.

122
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,779
Yeah, it sure is.

123
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,419
Sometime though.

124
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,699
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,686
Yeah, yeah, when you're not so busy.

126
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:20,687
Sure.

127
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:22,775
$2?

128
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:23,776
Yeah.

129
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,409
Hey Lorraine, got any more bags?

130
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,969
I'm all the fuck out.

131
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,479
[Lorraine] Yeah, I got some.

132
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,559
Is this your boyfriend?

133
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,819
Are you her boyfriend?

134
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,309
No.

135
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,699
- He's just my friend Archie.
- I'm just a customer.

136
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,269
You're always over here.

137
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,820
Why don't you come over to
my stand, buy some meat?

138
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,789
I'm vegan.

139
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,229
He likes wheatgrass.

140
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,928
He's making a car,
and it's gonna run on wheatgrass

141
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,297
- 'cause the gas prices are so-
- Come on, you know

142
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:51,905
you want some meat.

143
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,656
You know you want it.

144
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:57,599
I'm vegan.

145
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,186
Hey, Denise,
don't steal all my customers.

146
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,187
(Lorraine chuckles)

147
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,633
She's so crazy.

148
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
Yeah.

149
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:12,832
Here you go.

150
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,093
(bicycle whirring)

151
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,094
Hello, Mrs. Butterfield!

152
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:39,193
(marker scratching)

153
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,963
(Archie sighing)

154
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,153
What if you put pedals on it,
like a bike?

155
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,053
Why don't you come over to my stand,
buy some meat?

156
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,629
We looked at it.

157
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,877
We're pretty sure it's cancer or cancer.

158
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,884
(frenetic orchestral music)

159
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,429
(electricity crackles)

160
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,904
(bottle smashes)
(Archie groans)

161
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,405
(blood drips)

162
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,960
(fan whirring)

163
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,670
[Archie] Yes, Jenny?

164
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:52,553
What is photosynthesis?

165
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,839
Well, no, Jenny.

166
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,369
We're talking about volcanoes, okay?

167
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,039
And I wish you would just
stop raising your answers

168
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,640
in the form of a question, okay?

169
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,659
All right.

170
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,939
So next, we will...

171
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,173
Um.

172
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,893
Hmm.

173
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:13,285
Next, we will...

174
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:15,953
(clock ticking)

175
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,929
(school bell rings)

176
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,049
Hey, Archie.

177
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,960
Want some wheatgrass?

178
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,509
Yeah, yeah, wheatgrass,
a gallon of it, now.

179
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,889
Wow, that's a lot.

180
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,575
Hey, what happened to your hand?

181
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:48,197
Listen, I don't have time
to talk right now, really.

182
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:49,698
Okay, well, I...

183
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,666
(tarp rustles)

184
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:17,832
(keys jingling)

185
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,666
(Archie sighs)

186
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,999
Come on, come on, come on.

187
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:24,224
(engine rumbles)

188
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:27,026
(Archie laughs)

189
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:29,430
It works! It works!

190
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:30,431
Woo!

191
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:34,441
Oh.

192
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:37,576
(Archie groans)

193
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,014
(car horn honks)

194
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:43,439
(engine rumbling)

195
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,290
It works, Archie.

196
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,613
You got it to work?

197
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,449
More wheatgrass, Lorraine.

198
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,450
[Lorraine] Absolutely.

199
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,062
What did you do?

200
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:55,129
Blood, sweat, and tears, Lorraine.

201
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,249
That's all it takes.

202
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,489
This is amazing.

203
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,539
I am so happy for you.

204
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,849
Is this yours?

205
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,335
Yeah, that's mine.

206
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,799
What, did you win the
fucking lottery or something?

207
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Not literally.

208
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:07,929
Your boyfriend can afford gas, Lorraine.

209
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,980
That's quite a catch.

210
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,689
I'm not her boyfriend.

211
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,039
No?

212
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,603
Gosh, I'd give anything to ride in a car.

213
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,429
Sure, I can give you a ride.

214
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,019
What's your name?

215
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,489
Archie.

216
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,899
I'm Denise.

217
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,833
I love riding in cars.

218
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,789
What about the meat stand?

219
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,579
Meat sells itself, Lorraine.

220
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,180
I want to ride in a fucking car.

221
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,463
(car door thuds)

222
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:41,213
(engine rumbles)

223
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:51,413
(keyboard clacking)

224
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:55,619
(telephone beeping)

225
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,769
[Agent] They're on the move.

226
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,749
They've got the car running.

227
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,939
Okay. Copy.

228
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,132
They're on the move.
They've got the car running.

229
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,827
They're on the move.
They've got the car running.

230
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,390
Video feed.

231
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,390
Copy.

232
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:11,081
(monitor buzzing)

233
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,022
(screen knocking)

234
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,023
It's coming.

235
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,829
Do you like my legs?

236
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,069
Oh.

237
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,249
I'm sorry, I was just-

238
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,379
It's okay.

239
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,730
I like you looking at them.

240
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:33,499
How fast does this thing go?

241
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,823
I'm not sure.

242
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,889
Well, let's see.

243
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,919
Well, I think we might run out of...

244
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,370
I like to do the speed limit.

245
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,876
Okay, well, tell you what,

246
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:52,000
you go real fast,
and I'll make it worth your while.

247
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:55,973
What does that mean, free meat?

248
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,990
I don't know.

249
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,108
Come on.

250
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,207
You know you want to do it.

251
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:13,504
That's it.
(gears shifting)

252
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:19,840
[Both] Oh! BJ!

253
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:22,382
(both grunting)

254
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:25,133
(Archie panting)

255
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,692

(Archie panting)

257
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:39,659
(engine sputtering)

258
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,422
- What's going on?
- It's the car.

259
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,073
It's the car running out of fuel.

260
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:50,083
That's too bad.
(Archie panting)

261
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,733
Will I get to see you again?

262
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,339
Sure.

263
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,419
I want to go to the
drive-in tomorrow night.

264
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,049
Pick me up at nine,
at the meat stand.

265
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,419
All right.

266
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,088
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

267
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,266
Later.

268
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:09,017
(heels clicking)

269
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:39,723

(woman moaning)

272
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,034
Yeah!

273
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:09,035
Oh, fuck yeah!
(wrench clicking)

274
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:30,658
(blades whooshing)

275
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:35,051
(bell tolling)

276
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:37,969
(triumphant music)

277
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:47,002
You can do this.

278
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:49,265
Think about what this means.

279
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,577
You're not eating the meat.

280
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:52,487
You're using it for good.

281
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:53,321
For good.

282
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:54,170
(squirrel squeaking)

283
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,920
Believe what you say.

284
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:02,074
Believe what you say.

285
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,260
(gun fires)
(squirrel squeaking)

286
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,239
Oh, god.

287
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,533
I'm so sorry, squirrel.

288
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,823
I promise, I won't eat you.

289
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
You'll be fuel.

290
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:27,481
I'm sorry.

291
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:36,014

292
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:40,869

293
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,870
Oh, man.

294
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,383
Oh, man.

295
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,810
Man, you've got to do it.

296
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,497
God, I'm losing it.

297

(engine whirring)

324
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,552
No.

325
00:24:57,553 --> 00:24:59,325
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

326
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:01,982
Come on, come on, come on.

Huh?!

00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:31,577
Work!

339
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,159
Do you want to pollute the atmosphere?!

340
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,960
Do you want to give kids asthma?!

341
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:38,685
Work!

342
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:39,685
Work!

I'm sorry, Mrs. Butterfield!

345
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,143
I'm sorry about the noise!

346
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:53,665
Mrs. Butterfield?

347
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:07,102
Butterfield?

348
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,334
Mrs. Butterfield, I'm sorry.

Mrs. Butterfield?

350
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:30,455
Mrs. Butterfield, are you asleep?

360
00:27:15,214 --> 00:27:17,387

(Archie panting)

367
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,220
Oh, wow.

368
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:54,827
I've never had sex in a car before.

369
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:59,377
Look at these fucking people.

370
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:03,219
Just look at them, on
their goddamn blankets,

371
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,520
like they're laying next
to the fucking ocean,

372
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:08,521
with their little radios and dreams.

373
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,899
People aren't supposed
to go to the drive-in

374
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,549
and cum in a sleeping bag, Bradley.

375
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,939
Archie.

376
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,690
They're supposed to fuck in cars.

377
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,567
I want to sit up here
and look down on them.

378
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:27,527
I want to know that right
now, I'm better than they are.

379
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:32,173
And they can say whatever
they want and stare and point.

380
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,823
The fact is, I'm in the
front seat of a car,

381
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,923
tackling a rod like a princess,

382
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:44,341
and they're dry humping
through a double feature.

383
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:52,284
Take me to the playground.

384
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:01,953
(birds chirping)

385
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:20,076
(students shouting)

386
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:25,179
"To look at it,"
said the sergeant-Major,

387
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,806
fumbling in his pocket,

388
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:31,536
"it's just an ordinary little paw,
dried to a mummy."

389
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:34,909
"It had a spell put
on it by an old fakir,"

390
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,769
said the sergeant major,
"a very holy man."

391
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,029
He wanted to show that
fate ruled people's lives

392
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,219
and that those that interfered

393
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,603
with it did so to their sorrow.

394
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,139
That's a cool bike.

395
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,213
You want to suck on
each other's junk later?

396
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,003
Hey, Lorraine.
Can I get a soy-puccino?

397
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,745
Yeah, you want some wheatgrass?

398
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:02,122
No, that's all.
(blender whirring)

399
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:04,406
Well, what's your car gonna run on?

400
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:05,809
Huh?

401
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,759
Oh, yeah, yeah.

402
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,103
Give me a dollar's worth.

403
00:30:15,478 --> 00:30:18,310
You know, I was thinking
about this solar eclipse that...

404
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,969
Hey, Bradley, this is Paul.

405
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,543
[Archie] Hey, I'm Archie.

406
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,093
Yeah, I'm Rick.

407
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:32,135
(engine rumbling)

408
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,587
Who's that guy?

409
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:37,595
Who cares?

410
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:38,936
Can you pick me up at nine?

411
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,042
Well, I don't know if I can.

412
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:40,876
I mean, the fuel-

413
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:43,359
That was Paul, with the motorcycle.

414
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,735
He'll be here at 9:10.

415
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:46,736
Oh, okay.

416
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,219
All right, yeah, I'll be here.

417
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,869
Sure.

418
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,903
Sure. Nine!

419
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:57,557
(Archie slurps)

420
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:00,558
(crickets chirping)

421
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:03,990
It's no big thing.

422
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:06,016
I just need a little blood.

423
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:06,850
(computer beeping)

424
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,390
He's looking for fuel.

425
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:13,042
(door clacks)

426
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,386
[Carjacker] Start driving, motherfucker!

427
00:31:14,387 --> 00:31:15,387
Oh! Okay!

428
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,483
What wrong with you?

429
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:20,400
What you doing,
window-shopping in the ghetto?

430
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:21,304
No.

431
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,789
I was just thinking.

432
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,079
Wrong part of town to be thinking here,
motherfucker.

433
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,919
Probably thinking about
buying some pussy.

434
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Keep driving.

435
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:34,029
(static crackling)
What are you doing?

436
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,378
Shut the fuck up!

437
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:36,840
Think I get to ride around in cars,

438
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,491
listen to the radio and shit?!

439
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:40,353
Do you?! Fuck no, I don't!

440
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,249
Do you want to just take the car?

441
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,050
Shut the fuck up and drive, nigga.

442
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:50,020
You can take the car.

443
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:52,109
What sense that make, huh?

444
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,579
You got maybe an eighth of a tank.

445
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,198
If I take this car and
drive and run out of gas,

446
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,919
what am I gonna do, fill it up?

447
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,830
What, this is a 12-gallon tank, ain't it?

448
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:01,027
I don't know.

449
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:02,538
What size, motherfucker?

450
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:03,698
- I don't-
- 10-gallon?

451
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:04,658
12-gallon?

452
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,249
- What?!
- Yeah, 12.

453
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,301
12 gallons.
I'm positive, it's 12.

454
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,242
Why you just didn't say that?

455
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:15,182
I don't know.
I don't know.

456
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,803
It's like 12 gallons at $35.50,

457
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:21,930
about $36 a gallon.

458
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:25,009
If I fill it up, it's like $450.

459
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,989
- Now, I can't-
- No, it's not quite 400-

460
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,229
Yes, it is, nigga!

461
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,229
It's like 440 or 450!

462
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,259
Do the math!

463
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,749
I did the math, that's incorrect.

464
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,976
What?!

465
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:37,342
You got a calculator?

466
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:38,639
- Give me a calculator.
- No, I don't have

467
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,019
a calculator.

468
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,239
I have a pencil.

469
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,187
- Will that work?
- What?

470
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:43,310
"Will that work"?

471
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:44,329
Hell yeah, it'll work.

472
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,930
Think a nigga can't do
his timetables and shit?

473
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,681
(paper rustling)

474
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,969
Well, at 36 a gallon,
it's pretty damn close.

475
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,289
But not quite, right?

476
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,017
Well, pull into this
motherfucking gas station,

477
00:33:03,018 --> 00:33:05,238
and let's fill this bitch up, man.

478
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:06,072

479
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:07,695

480
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,261

483
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,185
Start pumping.

484
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:23,069
Listen, I didn't want to say,

485
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,517
but I have some gas in the trunk.

486
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:25,879
Oh, hold the fuck up.

487
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,959
Probably got more than that
in the motherfucking trunk.

488
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,989
Probably got a motherfucking
pistol or shotgun

489
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,713
or something in the
motherfucking trunk.

490
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:33,441
Listen, we're gonna
fill this motherfucker up,

491
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:35,543
we're gonna ride a fucking
tank of gas out of here,

492
00:33:35,544 --> 00:33:37,600
and you're gonna drop me off
at the motherfucking house.

493
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,489
Now, don't try no more fucking shit.

494
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,523
No, no, no, I didn't-

495
00:33:41,524 --> 00:33:44,580
Give me the goddamn motherfucking keys,
motherfucker.

496
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:45,802
What's in the trunk, man?

497
00:33:45,803 --> 00:33:47,605
What's in the goddamn trunk?

498
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:48,915
Let's me see what's in this motherfucker.

499
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,159
Hold still, motherfucker.

500
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,284
You trying to hide something?

501
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:52,882
(car roaring)
Shit!

502
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:54,032
Damn!

503
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:54,866
(object thuds)
(carjacker groans)

504
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,781
(body thuds)

505
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:58,034
(car rumbling)

506
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,099
Oh! What the fuck?!

507
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,190
(bell jingles)
What the fuck is this?!

508
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,406
What he fuck you doing?!

509
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:05,965
Open up, motherfucker!

510
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:07,708
Let me out of this motherfucking trunk!

511
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:08,542
Oh, goddamn!

512
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:10,031
I've got a gun, motherfucker!

513
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:10,865
(gun fires)

514
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:13,825
I am goddamn out of bullets here, man!

515
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:16,005
You have to help me!

516
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:16,964
Help me!

517
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:17,896
Help me!

518
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:19,097
Help me!

519
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,561
(carjacker screams)
Hey, what's going on?

520
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:22,079
[Carjacker] Help me, motherfucker!

521
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,379
(engine rumbles)
(engine roars)

522
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,130
(blood spraying)

523
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:34,672
[Attendant] Jesus.

524
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,882
Oh, my god.

525
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:40,559
I am so sorry, sir.

526
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,429
I am so sorry.

527
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,459
Look, come on, I got to know

528
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,369
what that colored boy's
doing in this trunk.

529
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,479
He didn't feel well,
so he wanted to get in the trunk-

530
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,693
Don't bullshit me.
Open this trunk now.

531
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:55,319
Okay.

532
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,857
(lock clicking)

533
00:34:56,858 --> 00:34:57,841
(lock clacks)

534
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,694
(door creaks)

535
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:00,943
Hey!
Son of a bitch, stop it!

536
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:01,777
What are you...

537
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:03,689
Goddammit.
Son of a bitch, stop it!

538
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,357
(frenetic orchestral music)

539
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:11,240
Hey! Help me!

540
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:25,826
Oh, god!

541
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:28,653
Christ almighty,
I just killed two people!

542
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,936
Oh, god!

543
00:35:30,937 --> 00:35:33,219
Oh, god, I'm gonna go to jail!

544
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,649
Gosh!
Fuck, she's not even here!

545
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,786
God!

546
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:38,579
Oh, god!
Oh, Christ!

547
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,539
What am I doing?!
I'm a kindergarten teacher!

548
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,589
What am I doing?!

549
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,824
Oh, my god!

550
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:44,619
(Archie groans)

551
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,029
Just turn yourself in.

552
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,584
Turn yourself in, Archie.

553
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:48,721
You're a vegan.

554
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:49,667
I'm a Vegan.

555
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:50,859
You don't do this!

556
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,099
Remember the fucking...

557
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,072
Oh, god!

558
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:55,439
Goddammit!

559
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,316
- Oh, fuck, she's not even here!
- Hey.

560
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:58,767
- Where is-
- Right on time.

561
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,740
I'm always on time.

562
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:07,767
(Denise sighs)

563
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:12,289
Put a taco in my mouth
and your dick in my ass.

564
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,940
What kind of tacos do you want?

565
00:36:15,285 --> 00:36:16,285
What's going on?

566
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,779
They just killed two people,

567
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,580
and now they're going out for tacos.

568
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,989
All right.

569
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,712
Just maintain surveillance.

570
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:27,867
Keep close, you know, all that.

571
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,070
You check this message?

572
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
No. Mm-mm.

573
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,367
(lively music)

574
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,909
Thanks, Poncho Villa.

575
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,979
After you get that,
why don't you bring us

576
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,653
a couple of margaritas
and two shots of tequila?

577
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,919
Listen, Denise,
it is a school night for me.

578
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,269
I shouldn't get too many drinks in me.

579
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,689
Well, it's a meat stand night for me,

580
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,960
and you don't hear me whining.

581
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:00,529
What, you're in school?

582
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,769
I'm a teacher.

583
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,603
Elementary school.

584
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:04,809
Ugh, you teach children?

585
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,018
They give me the creeps.

586
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:08,009
I never really liked them.

587
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,453
No, they're nice.

588
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,133
Come on.

589
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:21,503
Batter up there, Professor.

590
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,360
I shouldn't.

591
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,676
Come on.

592
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,059
You can't fuck in the bathroom

593
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,623
of a Mexican restaurant sober.

594
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,683
So kill that shot and
cannonball that rita.

595
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:38,731
(Denise exhales)

596
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:39,565
Come on.

597
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:40,911
Drinky drinky.

598
00:37:40,912 --> 00:37:42,079
I got to piss.

599
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:47,321
(door creaks)

600
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:09,439
[Woman] Psst.

601
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,762
(door creaks)

602
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:36,294
(Archie moans)
Yeah, fuck that pussy!

603
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:37,924
Fuck that pussy!

604
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:38,758
Yeah!

605
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:40,801
(upbeat music)

606
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:41,802
Yeah!

607
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,499
Why can't I just take you home?

608
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,549
Uh-uh.

609
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,719
I'm sick of stalkers.

610
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,229
Goddamn sick of them.

611
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,839
And if I don't let you buy me food

612
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,319
and stick your tongue in my ass,

613
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,219
you'll be in the bushes
with the rest of them.

614
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,239
Crying and whacking off every
time you get two beers in you.

615
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,419
Shit, you probably write poetry.

616
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,629
I'm not like that.

617
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,463
Yeah, right, sissy.

618
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:31,219
I bet you write
sonnets and all that shit.

619
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,913
No. I mean I'm not a stalker.

620
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,769
Well, you're not actually a stalker

621
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,685
until you stalk somebody.

622
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:38,719
So why don't think about that

623
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,347
when you go home and
write haikus about my box.

624
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:47,460
(Archie sighs)

625
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:50,927
(handle rattling)

626
00:39:50,928 --> 00:39:51,928
No.

627
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:56,362
(upbeat music)

628
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:26,640
(door clacks)

629
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:29,864
(door creaks)

630
00:40:29,865 --> 00:40:32,282
(door thuds)

631
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,742
(key clatters)

632
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:32,017
[Denise] Oh, wow,
we made a mess, didn't we?

633
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:33,787
[Archie] Yes.

634
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:35,999
Yes, we did, Denise.

635
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,639
[Denise] What would you do for it?

636
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,864
[Archie] For what?

637
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:40,879
[Denise] For this, fucker.

638
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,099
[Archie] Oh, that?

639
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,925
[Denise] Yeah, this.

640
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:45,076
Would you steal for it?

641
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,375
[Archie] Yeah, I might.

642
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:49,626
[Denise] Would you lie?

643
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,549
[Archie] Sure, I'd lie.

644
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,828
[Denise] Would you beat someone up?

645
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:57,038
[Archie] Yeah, I'd beat them up.

646
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,088
[Denise] Would you kill?

647
00:41:59,089 --> 00:41:59,930
[Archie] What?

648
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:01,980
[Denise] Would you kill someone for it?

649
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,949
Yes.

650
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,616
(frenetic orchestral music)

651
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:22,179
(engine whirs)

652
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,763
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

653
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:41,965
Hey there!

654
00:42:41,966 --> 00:42:43,119
[Veteran] Hey.

655
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,970
How are you?

656
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:45,776
Oh, I'm okay.

657
00:42:45,777 --> 00:42:47,069
I'm okay.

658
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,169
Hey, can you spare some
change for some food?

659
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,577
Oh, yeah. Sure, I can.

660
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:53,239
(bill rustling)

661
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,483
Oh, thanks.

662
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,889
[Archie] You say you need some food?

663
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,463
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

664
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,513
I'm really hungry.

665
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,729
Well, I was gonna
drive to a diner and eat.

666
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,959
Would you like to join me?

667
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Drive?

668
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,750
You drive?

669
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,449
Hey, did you leave that car
running over there like that?

670
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:18,476
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.

671
00:43:18,477 --> 00:43:19,923
It's a little embarrassing.

672
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,499
Oh, hell.

673
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,169
You must be made out of money to walk off

674
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,103
and leave a car running like that.

675
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,719
Yeah, I'll go eat with you.

676
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,143
Okay, great. Great.

677
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,409
You want to ride in the car?

678
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,926
Oh, ride in a car and
eat fancy and all that?

679
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:38,890
(veteran chuckles)

680
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:40,018
I might need a tie.

681
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:40,852
(both laughing)

682
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:42,427
Yeah, you might. Might.

683
00:43:44,866 --> 00:43:45,850
(lock clicking)

684
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:48,350
(lock clacks)

685
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,669
If I put your wheelchair in
the trunk, will that be okay?

686
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,843
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

687
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,699
You gonna let me get in the car first?

688
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,883
I can't walk there with plastic legs.

689
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,079
You have plastic legs?

690
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,379
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

691
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,159
And a plastic arm.

692
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,993
I wear them 'cause I don't
feel like half a man.

693
00:44:05,994 --> 00:44:07,221
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Wait, wait a minute.

694
00:44:07,222 --> 00:44:08,180
Don't be alarmed.

695
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,124
No, wait, wait.

696
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,307
No, no, no, no, not in here.

697
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:12,141
Oh, come on.

698
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:13,413
- No!
- It's all one car.

699
00:44:13,414 --> 00:44:15,481
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop!

700
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:16,672
- No!
- You're being a hero.

701
00:44:16,673 --> 00:44:17,506
No!

702
00:44:17,507 --> 00:44:18,981
- You'll be a hero again.
- Stop it, goddammit!

703
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:20,264
- Get away from me!
- Follow orders!

704
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:22,068
- Follow orders!
- Stop it!

705
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:23,573
- Goddammit!
- What?

706
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:24,455
- No!
- What?

707
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:26,199
- Cut it out!
- Just ride in the trunk.

708
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,181
Fuck you!

709
00:44:27,182 --> 00:44:32,181
Goddammit!
(prosthetic leg thudding)

710
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:41,060
(frenetic orchestral music)

711
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,370
(engine rumbles)

712
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,243
(firefighters mimicking siren wailing)

713
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:09,719
Ugh, god.

714
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,920
I needed a whole person.

715
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:14,388
(mellow music)

716
00:45:37,165 --> 00:45:38,748
Can I get a lift?

717
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,339
Nice car.

718
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,440
You rich or something?

719
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,593
No, not really.

720
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,189
It's not that nice of a car, really.

721
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,899
Well, you can gas it up.

722
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,570
That's something.

723
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:56,981
I think it has a flat tire.

724
00:45:56,982 --> 00:45:57,982
What?

725
00:45:59,096 --> 00:46:00,709
Uh, no.

726
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,189
No flat tire.

727
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,399
Yeah?

728
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,019
No, I think it does.

729
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,220
I think it's got a flat.

730
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,389
Um, I don't think so, no.

731
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,149
No flat. Mm-mm.

732
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,699
I better get the spare out of the trunk.

733
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,959
Why?
You don't have a flat tire.

734
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,536
This car has nowhere near a flat.

735
00:46:19,537 --> 00:46:21,679
- You know, a flat sounds like-
- So what kind

736
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,289
of work do you do?

737
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:24,459
Work?

738
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,003
Yeah, you know, work.

739
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,353
None. No work, really.

740
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,079
Then what do you do?

741
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,529
Well, I was in school
and I was dating Rick.

742
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,229
And things were going so
good until Cheryl's party,

743
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,913
- but all I really want to do-
- I'm in the candy business.

744
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,299
And the makeup business.

745
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,989
Mm, okay, that's cool.

746
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:53,990
Why makeup?

747
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,979
I don't know.

748
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,113
Got a whole trunk full of makeup.

749
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,469
Mm.

750
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,193
Makeup and candy in the trunk.

751
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,283
Makeup and candy both in the trunk.

752
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,339
Okay, you're starting
to freak me out a little.

753
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,490
What's your trunk deal?

754
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,336
Really?
God, I'm sorry.

755
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:25,029
I'm just no good at this.

756
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,649
At what?

757
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,729
Giving away puppies.

758
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,749
Puppies?
You have puppies in the trunk?

759
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,859
Yeah. I'm not gonna let
them crawl all over the place.

760
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,693
What? Pull over!

761
00:47:35,694 --> 00:47:38,901
Oh, my god, I can't believe
you have puppies in the trunk.

762
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:39,902
All right.

763
00:47:48,439 --> 00:47:49,439
Come on.

764
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:51,709
Hurry up,
I bet they really can't breathe.

765
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,218
Sure they can.

766
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:54,219
No.

767
00:47:55,259 --> 00:47:56,787
(lock clicking)

768
00:47:56,788 --> 00:47:58,012
(lock clacks)

769
00:47:58,013 --> 00:47:59,588
(woman screams)

770
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:00,481
What did you do to the...

771
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:01,481
No! No!

772
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:06,191
(trunk thudding)
Please, let me out!

773
00:48:06,192 --> 00:48:07,868
(woman screams)

774
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:09,199
Somebody help!

775
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,200
- Puppies.
- Please!

776
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,852
You just killed that girl with puppies.

777
00:48:12,853 --> 00:48:13,820
(woman screams)

778
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,653
Things are changing, man.

779
00:48:14,654 --> 00:48:16,528
- Get it together.
- Please let me out of here!

780
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:18,013
Let me out of this car!

781
00:48:18,014 --> 00:48:19,118
(engine rumbles)

782
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,786
(woman screams)

783
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:34,994
(baton thuds)

784
00:48:49,715 --> 00:48:51,298
Who are you guys?

785
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,600
Who do we look like?

786
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:55,729
(cellphone rings)

787
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:56,730
Yeah?

788
00:48:57,403 --> 00:48:58,320
(agent chuckles)

789
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,230
I know, right?

790
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:00,678
Yeah.

791
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:01,969
(agent chuckles)

792
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:02,803
No.

793
00:49:02,804 --> 00:49:05,263
No, but what do you want
us to do with the teacher?

794
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,340
Oh.

795
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,259
No, it's great.
No, it's great.

796
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,729
I love this shit, man.
That's why I took the job.

797
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,414
Yeah. All right.

798
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:15,248
(agent chuckles)

799
00:49:15,249 --> 00:49:16,549
Yeah, fuck you too.

800
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,181
Fuck you too, bitch.
Call the cops.

801
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:19,015
(agent chuckles)

802
00:49:19,016 --> 00:49:20,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, no.

803
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:21,610
All right.

804
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,290
I'll talk to you later, Tom.

805
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,290
In a few. Yeah.

806
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:28,889
What about using the codename?

807
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,063
Someone could have the line tapped.

808
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,789
Who taps phone lines besides us?

809
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:35,623
Who?

810
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:37,923
Explain it to me,
I don't understand.

811
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,869
'Cause I really don't.

812
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:43,623
Okay. The Russians.

813
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,600
The Russians?

814
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:46,719
What year is it on your planet?

815
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,809
You suck.

816
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,369
You're an idiot.

817
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,169
Okay, then, suicide bombers.

818
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,020
Suicide bombers?

819
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:55,316
You know, they're the
excuse for everything?

820
00:49:55,317 --> 00:49:58,769
"Oh, I'm sorry, we couldn't give you

821
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:00,099
that raise we promised you.

822
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,876
You know, suicide bombers."

823
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:05,109
"Oh, we had to raise the
deductible on your health plan.

824
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,896
You know, suicide bombers."

825
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:08,673
"You want snacks in the break room?

826
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:11,959
Oh, I'm sorry, had to cut back.

827
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,447
Suicide bombers."

828
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,560
Makes no sense.

829
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,950
Makes no goddam sense,
you motherfucker.

830
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,559
Are we taking the teacher
back to headquarters?

831
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,737
Oh, shit, I forgot about him.

832
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:29,738
No, we shoot him.

833
00:50:31,507 --> 00:50:32,825
(kick thuds)

834
00:50:32,826 --> 00:50:34,311
What the fuck?
What's wrong with you, man?

835
00:50:34,312 --> 00:50:35,395
He's driving.

836
00:50:36,902 --> 00:50:37,985
Kick me, huh?

837
00:50:41,261 --> 00:50:43,174
(kick thuds)

838
00:50:43,175 --> 00:50:44,008
(elbow thuds)

839
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:46,669
(head thuds)

840
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,399
Agent down. Great.

841
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
What do we do?

842
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,870
Just put him in the trunk,
and get back here.

843
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,049
Thought that guy was your friend?

844
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,694
I fucking hate that guy.

845
00:50:57,695 --> 00:50:58,695
Hm.

846
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:08,175
(frenetic orchestral music)

847
00:51:19,237 --> 00:51:21,737
(lock clacks)

848
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,873
What are you doing?

849
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:47,864
(engine rumbles)

850
00:51:47,865 --> 00:51:52,864
(fan whirring)
(agent screaming)

851
00:51:58,417 --> 00:51:59,912
Oh!

852
00:51:59,913 --> 00:52:00,913
Oh, god!

853
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,587
(agent sighs)

854
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,620
Hey, Archie.

855
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,295
You want some wheatgrass?

856
00:52:24,296 --> 00:52:26,469
No, not really.

857
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,803
Hey, don't be so glum.

858
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,519
Yeah, you're right.

859
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,743
You should be happy,
I got something for you.

860
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,693
What's this?

861
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,723
It's an all-natural organic candy bar.

862
00:52:39,485 --> 00:52:42,068
(wrapper rips)

863
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,769
This is terrible.

864
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,009
I know.

865
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,010
It sucks.

866
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,579
Why did you give this to me?

867
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,468
Yeah, they suck.

868
00:52:55,469 --> 00:52:56,784
(Lorraine chuckles)

869
00:52:56,785 --> 00:52:57,777
(Lorraine groans)

870
00:52:57,778 --> 00:52:58,948
Ah, quit it!

871
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:00,859
(Lorraine chuckles)

872
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,370
Not too funny now, huh?

873
00:53:05,054 --> 00:53:08,759
(Lorraine chuckles)

874
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,829
Was the meat stand open today?

875
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,469
Yeah, for a little while,

876
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:15,603
but then Denise closed early
and took off somewhere.

877
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,399
[Archie] Oh, okay.

878
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,987
[Lorraine] She stand you up?

879
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,523
No. No, why?

880
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,929
I don't know.

881
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,180
She didn't stand me up.

882
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,300
Okay.

883
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
Hey, Archie.

884
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,729
How come you stopped buying wheatgrass

885
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,403
for the wheatgrass car?

886
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,230
I just don't.

887
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:45,399
I was so excited when I saw it running.

888
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,449
Yeah, so was I.

889
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,549
I mean, I worked real hard on it.

890
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:52,689
Yeah, but I was excited
because I thought it might mean

891
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,659
you'd come by and see me more.

892
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,910
I thought you'd need
wheatgrass all the time.

893
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,089
I'm sorry, Lorraine.

894
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,090
I've been real busy.

895
00:54:02,048 --> 00:54:03,548
But you still drive the car.

896
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,719
It's complicated, Lorraine.

897
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,570
Explain it to me.

898
00:54:08,571 --> 00:54:09,593
You're a teacher.

899
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,479
[Archie] It's not that easy.

900
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,210
Does the car run on meat, Archie?

901
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,389
No, Lorraine, it doesn't run on meat.

902
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,719
Promise?

903
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,720
I promise.

904
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,560
Okay.

905
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,219
Hey.

906
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,419
What?

907
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,820
You want to go for a ride?

908
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,619
You think you can come over here

909
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,389
and pick me up right after you realize

910
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,569
your little meat-slinging slut
is off with somebody else?

911
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,020
Is that what you think of me?

912
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:49,059
No, no.

913
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,289
I'm sorry, Lorraine.

914
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,290
I'm sorry.

915
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:53,284
Oh, hey.

916
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,399
Quit being sucked a dork.

917
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,400
Let me get my bag.

918
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,399
So what do you want to do?

919
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,733
I don't know.
What do you and Denise do?

920
00:55:22,734 --> 00:55:25,317
(lively music)

921
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:34,702
Uh, nothing special.

922
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,079
I love this car, Archie.

923
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,839
I need to clean it a little bit.

924
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,940
I think it's lovely.

925
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,200
Yeah.

926
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,616
Do you want to go get a
bite to eat or something?

927
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:50,743
I'd love that?

928
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,219
Steakhouse?

929
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,229
I love that.

930
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,659
I love steakhouse, Archie.

931
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,330
No, you don't.

932
00:55:57,331 --> 00:55:58,230
(Lorraine sighs)

933
00:55:58,231 --> 00:55:59,381
Oh, you're right.

934
00:55:59,382 --> 00:56:00,949
(Lorraine chuckles)

935
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,789
Cut it out, Lorraine.

936
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,289
Cut it.

937
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,123
I'm sorry.

938
00:56:05,124 --> 00:56:07,053
I'm just nervous.

939
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,422
I'm nervous all the time.

940
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:11,575
No, you're not.

941
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,659
Yeah, I am.

942
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,809
You're nervous right now?

943
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,793
Yeah, I'm a little nervous.

944
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,270
What makes you nervous?

945
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:22,323
It's just you and me.

946
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,230
Maybe I'm just hungry.

947
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:27,973
Well, eat.

948
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,349
You want to go to my
apartment and get some food?

949
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,555
Yes.

950
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,689
Okay.

951
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:35,624
Archie's, it is.

952
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,207
(upbeat music)

953
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,193
Well, this is Archie's.

954
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,547
Che Archie.

955
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,819
(both chuckling)

956
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,863
This is my kitchen.

957
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,793
Oh, this is my lab.

958
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,569
- Wow.
- Yeah, the wheatgrass engine

959
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,629
I told you all about.

960
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,789
That's it, right there.

961
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:11,821
This is where you do your work.

962
00:57:11,822 --> 00:57:13,619
Mm-hm. Yeah.

963
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,020
Like I've always imagined.

964
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,163
You know my bike.

965
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,410
Do you want some wheatgrass
juice or anything or...

966
00:57:28,584 --> 00:57:29,667
Whoa! Whoa!

967
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:35,263
(Lorraine moaning)

968
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:52,450
(upbeat music)

969
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:55,201
(shower running)

970
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:24,633
(button clicks)

971
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:25,923
[Denise] Hey, vegan boy.

972
00:58:25,924 --> 00:58:27,452
Don't pick me up at the meat stand.

973
00:58:27,453 --> 00:58:30,946
I'm leaving work early and I'll
be at Fat Matt's rib shack.

974
00:58:30,947 --> 00:58:32,837
Don't be late.

975
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:35,648
(answering machine beeps)

976
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:36,770
(engine rumbles)

977
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:39,628
(tires screeching)

978
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:40,629
Hey!

979
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:46,366
(shower running)

980
00:58:56,857 --> 00:59:00,979
(Lorraine yelps)
(body thuds)

981
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,980
Archie!

982
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,110
Archie!

983
00:59:11,523 --> 00:59:12,606
It's my neck.

984
00:59:17,796 --> 00:59:19,007
Archie!

985
00:59:19,008 --> 00:59:21,925
(Lorraine sobbing)

986
00:59:30,661 --> 00:59:31,494
(engine sputtering)

987
00:59:31,495 --> 00:59:33,399
Oh, no, we're out of gas.

988
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,423
Ah, blood.

989
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,970
Dammit!

990
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,610
Get in the trunk.

991
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,640
Fuck that.

992
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:46,889
Do it for your country.

993
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:47,929
Don't waive your flag at me.

994
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:48,930
I just work here.

995
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,339
Get in the trunk.

996
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,299
Why don't you just shoot that guy?

997
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,469
You know I can't do that.

998
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,887
Get in the trunk.

999
01:00:06,296 --> 01:00:08,629
(gun fires)

1000
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:13,514
(frenetic orchestral music)

1001
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:28,411
(Archie panting)

1002
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:34,451
(Archie panting)

1003
01:00:38,244 --> 01:00:41,010
(Archie panting)

1004
01:00:41,011 --> 01:00:43,761
(engine rumbles)

1005
01:00:55,934 --> 01:01:00,470
(blood spraying)
(Archie groaning)

1006
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:03,995
(Archie screaming)

1007
01:01:03,996 --> 01:01:04,996
Uh-uh.

1008
01:01:06,784 --> 01:01:09,701
(Archie screaming)

1009
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:19,810
(engine sputtering)

1010
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,940
(gentle orchestral music)

1011
01:01:34,603 --> 01:01:39,450
All right, son,
let's talk this out, huh?

1012
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:42,689
'Cause I don't know if
you've ever been shot,

1013
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:45,200
but I've got to tell
you, it hurts like fuck!

1014
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,804
(agent chuckles)

1015
01:01:46,805 --> 01:01:47,947
And I will shoot you!

1016
01:01:50,784 --> 01:01:52,469
All right, come on, man, why
don't you just come out here?

1017
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,559
We'll sit down,
we'll talk about it out,

1018
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,445
we'll figure something out.

1019
01:01:54,446 --> 01:01:57,597
I mean, I don't have to hurt you.

1020
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,969
I mean, trust me,
I won't fucking hesitate,

1021
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:02,923
but I don't have to hurt you.

1022
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:08,618
Dammit.
Where is he?

1023
01:02:08,619 --> 01:02:10,695
(Archie screams)

1024
01:02:10,696 --> 01:02:11,982
(agent screams)

1025
01:02:11,983 --> 01:02:13,125
Son of a bitch!

1026
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:15,480
(agent screams)

1027
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,314
Fuck!

1028
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:17,225
(agent screams)

1029
01:02:17,226 --> 01:02:18,607
Oh, god!

1030
01:02:18,608 --> 01:02:20,836
(agent screams)

1031
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,068
(Archie grunts)

1032
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:24,902
(agent screaming)

1033
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,877
(body thuds)

1034
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:38,295
(door thuds)

1035
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:42,917
(Archie panting)

1036
01:02:42,918 --> 01:02:44,267
Oh!

1037
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:45,268
Oh, god.

1038
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:48,168
- Look at the time.
- Hello?!

1039
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:49,699
Look at the time.
(agent groaning)

1040
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,953
I got to meet Denise.

1041
01:02:54,112 --> 01:02:56,556
(agent groaning)

1042
01:02:56,557 --> 01:02:58,136
Yeah, okay.

1043
01:02:58,137 --> 01:02:59,448
That's nice.

1044
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:00,735
That's nice.

1045
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:01,866
Yeah.

1046
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:02,825
(agent sobbing)

1047
01:03:02,825 --> 01:03:03,658
Nice one.

1048
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:05,868
(engine rumbles)

1049
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:08,786
(tires screeching)

1050
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:13,403
(crickets chirping)

1051
01:03:17,298 --> 01:03:19,881
(bell jingles)

1052
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:23,771
Whoa.

1053
01:03:23,772 --> 01:03:26,329
Could have hit the
showers before coming out.

1054
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,187
No big deal.
Just clean up a little.

1055
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:31,413
You working on the car or something?

1056
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,149
Rough day?

1057
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,150
Me too.

1058
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:39,649
Want some barbecue?

1059
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,172
[Archie] Barbecue?

1060
01:03:41,173 --> 01:03:43,343
I love eating barbecue after a bad day.

1061
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,509
No place on Earth filled
with more sad, depressed,

1062
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:49,783
fat-necked fuckers than a barbecue joint.

1063
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:52,219
Look at them.

1064
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,804
Pathetic.

1065
01:03:53,805 --> 01:03:54,720
Motherfuckers.

1066
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:55,879
[Waitress] What can I get you?

1067
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,657
I'll have the number four rib plate,
double slaw.

1068
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:04,248
I need some barbecue, Denise.

1069
01:04:04,249 --> 01:04:05,509
I need some barbecue right now.

1070
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,943
Right now. BBQ.

1071
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,080
Barbecue?

1072
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:12,191
Barbecue?

1073
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,163
Barbecue?
I'm vegan.

1074
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,110
I'm vegan.

1075
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,513
[Denise] Sorry, but he's fucking trashed.

1076
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:26,970
What are you doing?

1077
01:04:28,459 --> 01:04:30,032
I'm vegan!

1078
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,993
Holy shit, you are fucked the fuck up.

1079
01:04:32,883 --> 01:04:33,753
[Archie] No, I'm not!

1080
01:04:33,754 --> 01:04:35,060
I'm fine!

1081
01:04:35,061 --> 01:04:37,291
I'm fine! Please, come here!

1082
01:04:37,292 --> 01:04:39,311
Give me a couple more beers
so I can handle this fucker.

1083
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:40,984
Vegan fatso!

1084
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:42,944
[Waitress] Rib plate number four?

1085
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:47,945
[Denise] Keep it up.
Not like they're gonna kick us out.

1086
01:04:48,387 --> 01:04:50,288
(Archie grunting)
Oh, come on.

1087
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:51,507
Why didn't you fucking order?

1088
01:04:51,508 --> 01:04:53,625
[Archie] I wanted this for so long, Denise.

1089
01:04:53,626 --> 01:04:56,058
- Motherfucker.
- I wanted this for so long.

1090
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,383
He's fucking wrecked.

1091
01:04:57,384 --> 01:04:59,101
What the fuck?

1092
01:04:59,102 --> 01:05:01,213
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm a vegan!

1093
01:05:01,214 --> 01:05:02,547
Look, I'm vegan!

1094
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,317
I'm vegan.

1095
01:05:06,918 --> 01:05:09,585
(Archie laughs)

1096
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:13,472
(lively music)

1097
01:05:28,911 --> 01:05:33,659
♪ The morn,
you awoke with songs in your life ♪

1098
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:38,660
♪ You barely feel
that you are still alive ♪

1099
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:47,781
♪ Your dreams told the
story of hanging the horses ♪

1100

(birds chirping)

1102
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:01,809
That was really great, Archie.

1103
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,223
You're a great driver.

1104
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:08,373
Archie, do you want to take me home?

1105
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,413
We can stay at my house.

1106
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,603
We can stay in bed all day
tomorrow, and do nasty things.

1107
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,440
Would you like that, Archie?

1108
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,780
Oh, god.

1109
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:27,349
I've got to go to school.

1110
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,119
Oh, come on, you can skip school.

1111
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,120
No.

1112
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,699
I don't do that.

1113
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,903
I don't skip school.

1114
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,510
Taking you to the playground.

1115
01:06:37,553 --> 01:06:39,009
Fine.

1116
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:41,769
Stupid, fucking stinking, shit-headed,

1117
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:43,393
dick-sucking child molester.

1118
01:07:04,962 --> 01:07:09,962
(door clacks)
(chair scraping)

1119
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:14,939
Okay, class,
I've got a very special story for us today,

1120
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,303
one that I've never read before,
not to any class.

1121
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,949
We're all humans, right?

1122
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,473
Tyler, you're a human.

1123
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:26,279
Dawson, you're a human.

1124
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,429
Tonya's a human.

1125
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:31,799
Even your teacher,
Mr. Andrews, is a human.

1126
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,729
And we all have rights.

1127
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:35,733
Yes, we do.

1128
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:42,170
This story is called
"Tibet: The Land That Cried."

1129
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:44,896
(door clacks)

1130
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:50,547
Let's go.

1131
01:07:50,548 --> 01:07:51,963
Did you steal my car?

1132
01:07:54,423 --> 01:07:56,840
(hand slaps)

1133
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,233
No, we crashed it.

1134
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,243
Kids, I'll be back in one second, okay?

1135
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,080
Just have to go see another
teacher for a minute, okay?

1136
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,800
Archie Andrews, right?

1137
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:48,350
That's funny.

1138
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:51,063
My name is Watkins.

1139
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,743
Donald Watkins.

1140
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:57,233
You're a schoolteacher, right?

1141
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,460
I'm the head of something very important.

1142
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,603
Government important.

1143
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,609
Let's cut straight to the chase.

1144
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,119
You've invented,
what we've been calling

1145
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,933
in official documents, a blood car.

1146
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,609
You beat us when we didn't play fair,

1147
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,209
so now we've all agreed to act civil.

1148
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,919
Civility.

1149
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,920
Civilian.

1150
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,100
The Civil War?

1151
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,143
They all start the same way Archie.

1152
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:32,509
Civil War was started over
people using other people,

1153
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:35,969
black people, as servants,

1154
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,169
not really like humans but like animals,

1155
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:41,209
to pull carts and plant vegetables.

1156
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,260
You know all about vegetables, don't you?

1157
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,340
It's a good idea, but it didn't work.

1158
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,483
The vegetable for the car thing.

1159
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:56,593
Slavery didn't work either,
but that's 'cause it was racist.

1160
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:01,283
Killing people for fuel is not racist.

1161
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:03,473
It's patriotic.

1162
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:09,269
It's all about making a
sacrifice to fuel our cars,

1163
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:12,853
mow our grass, grill our steaks,

1164
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,563
if your not a charcoal man, that is.

1165
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:24,609
Sure, it came down to us and the Russians,

1166
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:27,349
like everything else,
and we've beaten them.

1167
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:28,423
You've beaten them.

1168
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,503
Us has beaten them.

1169
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,109
Us.

1170
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:35,219
Spell it out, Archie.

1171
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,223
U-S.

1172
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,033
The U.S.

1173
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:42,329
No other nation can say that,

1174
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:43,930
not even in their native tongue.

1175
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,589
Outer space is uncharted territory,

1176
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:50,790
no matter what they
told you about Columbus.

1177
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,399
And the planets just keep getting closer

1178
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,559
the farther we get away
from Antarctic oil drilling,

1179
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,683
hard-boiled potatoes used
in apple pies, the Euro,

1180
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:09,789
and tarantulas, deadly tarantulas,

1181
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:11,713
for sale in vending machines.

1182
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:17,260
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

1183
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:23,259
We need you to build another
blood-powered engine.

1184
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,263
We need your help.

1185
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,113
We need another blood car.

1186
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,099
We need blood trucks, blood tanks,

1187
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,993
blood planes, and blood lawnmowers.

1188
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:36,963
We need your work to continue.

1189
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,219
We can't duplicate it.

1190
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:43,069
We don't even understand how
it works in the first place,

1191
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:47,163
how it could possibly work
in the first place, but it does.

1192
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:51,989
We can't just release this to the public.

1193
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:56,179
No one wants hysteria, riots, mass graves.

1194
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:59,849
You don't mix milk chocolate
and peanuts on your own,

1195
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:03,443
you leave it to the pros,
and reap the benefits.

1196
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:07,570
What do you say?

1197
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,850
Where will the blood come from?

1198
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:16,399
Vagrants, terminal cases,

1199
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,529
criminals, general riff-raff, and trash.

1200
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:22,119
You'll get a new name, new life.

1201
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,139
All this trouble that has
happened will disappear

1202
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,290
along with any trace
that you ever existed.

1203
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,478
I guess I don't have a choice.

1204
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,609
Not really.

1205
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:36,369
If you don't come with us,
you'll be on trial for murder.

1206
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:37,370
I see.

1207
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,999
It will be like I never existed.

1208
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,667
Like you were never born.

1209
01:12:46,497 --> 01:12:48,582
What about all the people who know me?

1210
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:50,651
[Donald] They just forget about you.

1211
01:12:50,652 --> 01:12:54,098
(gun firing)
(students screaming)

1212
01:12:54,099 --> 01:12:56,921
(woman moaning)

1213
01:12:56,922 --> 01:12:59,422
(guns firing)

1214
01:13:00,462 --> 01:13:05,462
(Lorraine screaming)
(fire roaring)

1215
01:13:08,355 --> 01:13:10,687
(Archie sighs)

1216
01:13:10,688 --> 01:13:12,976
That sounds like it could work.

1217
01:13:12,977 --> 01:13:14,894
It's working already.

1218
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,460
(gun fires)

1219
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:22,340
Yeah.

1220
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,606
Okay.

1221
01:13:24,607 --> 01:13:25,965
Yeah, man.

1222
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:27,473
You can have whatever you want.

1223
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:32,446
(gun fires)

1224
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:33,864
What do you want?

1225
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,623
Mayor?

1226
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:40,570
Governor?

1227
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:41,570
Senator?

1228
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:45,531
President.

1229
01:13:45,532 --> 01:13:48,661
(vacuum whirring)

1230
01:13:48,662 --> 01:13:49,912
What country?

1231
01:14:24,022 --> 01:14:26,605
(upbeat music)
