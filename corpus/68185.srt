1
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,834
My first...

2
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,674
my last...

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,146
my everything.

4
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,016
And the answer to...

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,748
all my dreams.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,883
You're my sun...

7
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,916
my moon...

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,895
my guiding star.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,919
Sing!

10
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:38,436
That's what you are.

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,405
I know...

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,738
there's only...

13
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:44,970
only one like you.

14
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,339
There's no way...

15
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,042
they could have made two.

16
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,414
They couldn't have made two!

17
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,180
You the only one!

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,019
You're all I'm living for.

19
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,457
Your love I'll keep forevermore.

20
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,290
You're the first.

21
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,057
You're the last.

22
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,156
My everything.

23
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,894
Oh, shit!

24
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,085
Go, man, go!

25
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:38,920
What you got?

26
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,432
Dodgers tickets,
Lakers tickets...

27
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:43,663
and Phantom of the Opera
tickets.

28
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,263
It's theater.
You ever been to the theater?

29
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:47,533
What the hell wrong with you?

30
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:50,064
Nobody give a damn
about Phantom of the Opera.

31
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,440
Franklin,
there's money in culture.

32
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:52,876
Let me tell you something,
Roland.

33
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,777
Black people
don't want to see that.

34
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,408
Get me some good shit,
like Luther Vandross tickets.

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,509
Luther Vandross is not culture.

36
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,417
Fuck culture!

37
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,945
People complain about
these fucked up tickets.

38
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,321
You're making me look bad.

39
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,555
Next time,
come up with some better stuff.

40
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:09,925
OK.

41
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:12,294
I'm not fuckin' with you.
I'm for real!

42
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,298
You owe me.

43
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,823
I don't owe you shit.

44
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,560
Where have you been?

45
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,626
You're supposed to wash it,
not take it for a joyride.

46
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,900
Where you been?
I been looking for you.

47
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,065
What?

48
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,300
I've been looking for you.

49
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,968
I'm glad I found you.

50
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,340
Get the hell on.

51
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,242
That's him. Let's do this.

52
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,923
I need two on the floor.

53
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,358
I need $200.

54
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:18,261
Same time. I don't know you.

55
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:19,321
Willie.

56
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,128
All righty.

57
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,298
Get out of here.

58
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,103
Try to hide some of this.

59
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,132
Keep it on the down-low.
You'll get a nigger busted.

60
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,571
Get me locked up.

61
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,550
Hurry up.

62
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,315
- How we doing?
- What you need?

63
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,350
Let me guess.
Two to the Phantom of the Opera?

64
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,622
I've already seen it.

65
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,323
Wait a minute.

66
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,323
You that silly ass reporter
from the Channel Five News.

67
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,630
Channel 12, actually.

68
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,795
What's up?

69
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,702
James Russell. How you doing?

70
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,969
Wonder if we can talk to you
on camera.

71
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,873
Julio, is that all right?

72
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,376
Whatever you want to do.

73
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,537
Let's roll it.

74
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,807
Speed.

75
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,247
- Wait a minute.
- Cut.

76
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,844
Let me straighten out my shit.

77
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:17,717
I'm ready. Let's go.

78
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,725
You're ready? You sure?

79
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,249
I'm sure.

80
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,059
This is James Russell...

81
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,930
reporting on our city
and her crimes.

82
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:32,404
I'm here talking
to the car wash hustler.

83
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,872
You've got
quite an operation here.

84
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,465
What is going on down here?

85
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,601
I'm a businessman.

86
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,577
What the fuck you think
goin' on?

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,342
What?

88
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,178
You can't use
that kind of language on TV.

89
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,581
What language?

90
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,846
Fuck.

91
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,183
Fuck what?

92
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,619
You cannot say "fuck"
on television.

93
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:52,954
Fuck that.
You the one wanted an interview.

94
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,983
Hurry up. I got shit to do.

95
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:58,155
I got shit to do, also.

96
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,164
Get on with it.

97
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,256
Speed.

98
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:04,065
This is James Russell reporting
on our city...

99
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,434
Hey, Franklin!

100
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,802
What's up?

101
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,101
I gotta go.

102
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,438
Y'all do a commercial
or find somebody else.

103
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,000
What up, Carmine?

104
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,682
I ain't seen you in a long time.

105
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,242
Fucking cut!

106
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,889
When am I gonna get my money?

107
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,756
What money?

108
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,090
Wait a minute.

109
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,154
You're talking about
the money I owe you.

110
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,665
I'm gonna pay you.

111
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,223
You know I'll pay you.

112
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:36,291
And I got your phone calls.

113
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,999
When you call...
Somebody stole my phone.

114
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,029
Can you believe that shit?

115
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,949
I don't like brothers,
and I don't like welchers.

116
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,787
Killing you would be double fun.

117
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,520
Stop playing.

118
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,188
What are you talking
about killing for?

119
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,698
If you kill me,
how am I gonna pay you?

120
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,563
Open the door,
get out of my car...

121
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,398
get on the street,
and get my money.

122
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,404
I'm gonna get it,
but don't leave mad.

123
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,700
Give me a hug or something.

124
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,206
- Get out.
- A kiss?

125
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:23,707
Franklin Hatchett?

126
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,240
He dead. They buried him
at the Compton cemetery.

127
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,310
You're under arrest.

128
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,515
What the fuck y'all doing?

129
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,080
I didn't do shit!

130
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,091
Nobody ever does.

131
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,286
You have the right
to remain silent.

132
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:36,760
Wait a minute.

133
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,661
I'll give you $5.00
to let me out.

134
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,995
Bribery, too?

135
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,500
In the car.

136
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,595
Watch my head.

137
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,334
He offered me $5.00.

138
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,441
Channel 5, help a brother out?

139
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,276
Geraldo!

140
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,781
You ain't gonna do nothing?

141
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,306
I'm gonna get your ass!

142
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,614
A serious crime.

143
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,950
Justified punishment.

144
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,217
This is James Russell reporting.

145
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,746
Channel 12 News.

146
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,121
We got him.

147
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,161
We didn't get shit.

148
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,826
Let's get out of here.

149
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,162
I am dead serious.
The po-po trippin'.

150
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,467
Ever since that O.J. shit.

151
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,905
I was rolling down the street,
wasn't doing nothing.

152
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,499
They gonna pull me over.

153
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,237
I was just living
ghetto fabulous.

154
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,245
I had five of my finest hos...

155
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,439
Are you hot?

156
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,540
A little,
but I was just chillin'.

157
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,347
The cop pull behind me,
lights and everything...

158
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:34,784
"Get out of the car."

159
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,344
I said,
"I ain't gettin' out the car."

160
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,489
Then all my hos was scared.

161
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,823
They was like, "We scared."

162
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,021
They be saying stuff
like that.

163
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:47,055
I was like, "I ain't stopping.
I ain't do nothing."

164
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,532
And he said, "Get out the car."

165
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,092
I got out and said,
"What you calling backup for?

166
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,001
"This is between me and you."

167
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,199
They got my license,
my registration, everything.

168
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,072
You gotta talk to 'em.

169
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,269
Stop playing.

170
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,904
He started trippin'.
That's when I slapped him.

171
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,608
I put his handcuffs on him...

172
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,946
put him in the back seat,
and said...

173
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,281
"I'm gonna take your ass
to jail...

174
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,309
"'cause you're
the one trippin'."

175
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,049
They put their hands on you?

176
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,387
One dude tried to grab me
from the back.

177
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:13,891
That's how they caught me.

178
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,655
From the back? How they do it?

179
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:18,891
They tried to grab me
like this, jack me up.

180
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,920
Like that?

181
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:22,991
They was grabbing.
They was trippin'.

182
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,195
Like that.

183
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,368
Get the hell off me!

184
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,432
Where's your shirt at?

185
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,505
Good-bye, sweetness.

186
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,618
Where we going?

187
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,682
Just leave me the fuck alone.

188
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:47,987
Who you talking to?

189
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,555
What?

190
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,792
Vacu fela culay, you Jerry-
Lewis-liking motherfucker.

191
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,548
Let's move it.

192
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,916
Let me borrow your gun.

193
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:25,187
Come to the back of the bus.

194
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,325
You shut up and sit down.

195
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,965
What the hell wrong with you?

196
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,442
I don't play that shit.

197
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,138
Check my police record.

198
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,874
You don't know
who you're messin' with.

199
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,181
You better come to the back
before you get hurt.

200
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,743
Play that shit.

201
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,620
Wait till we get off the bus.

202
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:58,395
I'm gonna kick your ass!

203
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,795
Shut up!

204
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:11,203
Where you from?
That French part of Compton?

205
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,370
What's that you claiming?

206
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,312
You don't know
who you're messing with.

207
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:19,681
I'm deep in the streets.
I slap people for fun.

208
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:21,618
That's what I do.

209
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,145
You want to play rough?

210
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,056
I kill for fun.

211
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,177
I ain't scared to go to jail.

212
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,148
Take me to jail.
Would you speed up, please?

213
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:58,376
I want to go back.

214
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,748
All my cousins in there.

215
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,753
I want to see all my friends.

216
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:36,249
What are you doing up there?

217
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,252
Raymond!

218
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,794
Debray.

219
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,665
Let's get out of here.

220
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,062
No time.
We'll take him with us.

221
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,039
We gotta go together.
We're a team.

222
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,371
Move!

223
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,262
We made it.

224
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,594
Everybody OK?

225
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,735
What it is.

226
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,073
Drop me off over there.

227
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,544
My cousin's house coming up.

228
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,605
Hover over the roof.
Y'all don't even have to stop.

229
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,980
I can be out of here.

230
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,110
I know y'all probably
got shit to do...

231
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:15,278
Shut up!

232
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,447
You can drop a brother off.
Y'all don't need me.

233
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,344
Fifteen million.

234
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,413
Cut a brother in on that.

235
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,179
Let me be down.

236
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,811
We'll split it three ways.

237
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:53,223
Seven for me, seven for you,
and you get whatever's left...

238
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:54,816
'cause you been trippin'
since I met you.

239
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,387
What you doing with the ax?

240
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,692
Forget about what I said.

241
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,097
I don't know shit about
no $15 million in no Jaguar.

242
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,261
I don't even know where we at.
I got a bad memory.

243
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,362
- Be still.
- Put the ax down.

244
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,429
Don't move.

245
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,213
What's wrong with you?

246
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,738
Trying to cut
a brother's hand off.

247
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,846
Always trying to kill somebody.

248
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,650
Why don't you try
loving somebody?

249
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,554
What did you open the door for?

250
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,665
Y'all trippin'.
You want some girls?

251
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,226
I can get you any kind
of girl... black, Japanese.

252
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,096
I can take you over
to my grandmama house.

253
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,769
She cook you some chicken,
some cornbread, some poulet.

254
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,489
It's cold.

255
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,650
It's colder than a motherfucker.

256
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,182
A serious crime.

257
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,524
Justified punishment.

258
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:39,962
This is James Russell
reporting.

259
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:44,367
That's some hard-hitting stuff.
John Tesh school of journalism.

260
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,201
Barclay, just watch it
one more time before you decide.

261
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,365
Why? Nobody else will.

262
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,875
Who gives a rat's ass
about some two-bit hustler?

263
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,707
The people getting ripped off
give a rat's ass.

264
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:56,339
You're just another walking
head shot, aren't you?

265
00:16:56,381 --> 00:17:00,249
Another pretty boy wanker
masquerading as a reporter.

266
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,344
I don't need this bullshit.

267
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,912
This is the skinny.
You're fired.

268
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:07,049
Have your stuff out by Monday.

269
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,655
Be brief.

270
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:14,256
What part of "you're fired"
don't you understand?

271
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,133
Not you, you asshole.
I'm talking to somebody else.

272
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,194
What?

273
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,303
Tragedy and terror
strike the Southland.

274
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,898
Good afternoon.

275
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,376
A bus delivering prisoners from
the men's central lockup...

276
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:28,902
to the Van Nuys courthouse
was destroyed...

277
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,383
on the First Street bridge
in downtown Los Angeles.

278
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:36,353
Fourteen prisoners and
two policemen were killed...

279
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,085
in what authorities describe
as a commando-style raid.

280
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,218
All bodies
have been accounted for...

281
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,455
with the exception
of two prisoners.

282
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,761
Witnesses saw the two men
boarding a helicopter...

283
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,426
shortly after the bus
exploded into flames.

284
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:53,302
The two fugitives are wanted
in connection with the murders.

285
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,932
This has got sweeps week
written all over it.

286
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,306
Let me know how it turns out.

287
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:06,541
On the left is a John Doe
police arrested at L.A. X...

288
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,883
for possession
of a counterfeit passport.

289
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,889
And on the right,
Franklin Maurice Hatchett...

290
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,187
a local street hustler
with suspected gang ties...

291
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,557
who was en route to Van Nuys...

292
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,030
to be arraigned on charges
of soliciting goods.

293
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,329
The two fugitives
are considered dangerous.

294
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,598
Fourteen prisoners due to face
a Van Nuys judge today...

295
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:29,232
now face the ultimate
judgment day of all...

296
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,765
one where sentencing comes
with no chance of reversal.

297
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,772
Freeze!

298
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,186
Come out with
your hands above your head!

299
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:44,813
I'm gonna come out,
but I didn't do it!

300
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:47,651
Don't shoot!

301
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,139
I didn't kill no cops!

302
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:53,717
Is this James Russell?

303
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,628
I'm on my way.

304
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:14,472
I cannot wait for you
to eat my ass.

305
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:20,046
Here it is.

306
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,024
Good afternoon.
I'm Detective Pickett...

307
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,291
and this is Williams.

308
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:35,765
I wondered if we might chat
about Franklin Hatchett.

309
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,630
Franklin's not here.

310
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,467
We're dealing
with a multiple homicide.

311
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,472
Would you just open the door?

312
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,905
Excuse you?

313
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,670
I'm sorry. Listen...

314
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:47,075
it would only take
a few minutes of your time.

315
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,545
We'd really appreciate it.

316
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,376
Please?

317
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,553
Thank you so much.

318
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,395
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

319
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,972
He left on the freak train
to Atlanta six weeks ago.

320
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:18,066
I haven't seen him since.

321
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,441
Do you think this is funny?

322
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,309
I got a busload of bodies
and a couple dead cops...

323
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,281
because of your gangbanger.

324
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,681
Franklin ain't no banger.

325
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,345
If I find out
you're helping him...

326
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,047
I'm going
to make your life miserable.

327
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,454
Back off, please.

328
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,151
Treat the lady with respect.

329
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,955
Can you help us out, Paula?

330
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,965
I swear,
I don't know where he is.

331
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,899
This is such bullshit!

332
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,328
You know...

333
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,100
It's OK.

334
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,972
All I'm saying is
if he tries to contact you...

335
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,442
give me a call.

336
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,037
It's so much better
if he turns himself in.

337
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,174
He stays out on the street,
he's gonna get himself killed.

338
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,980
I'm trying to protect him.

339
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,850
This is my card.

340
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,990
Will you give me a holler?

341
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,461
Thank you.

342
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,105
Keep it running.

343
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,172
This might be quick.

344
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,190
White boy.

345
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,165
What the fuck was that for?

346
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,732
That's for getting me busted.

347
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,176
What you bring a gun for?

348
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:02,736
'Cause you're wanted for murder.

349
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,339
I ain't murdered
no-goddamn-body.

350
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,610
I don't know that.

351
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,912
Now you know.

352
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:08,646
'Cause if I could,
I'd murder your ass right now...

353
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:10,244
coming down here with a gun.

354
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,414
Guns don't kill people.

355
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,788
Stupid motherfuckers
with guns kill people.

356
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,622
I'm enlightened.

357
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,218
Let me enlighten your ass.

358
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,526
Bring your monkey ass up here.

359
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,293
Got me running
all over goddamn town.

360
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:23,562
People shooting at me and shit.

361
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,694
You the one got me in this shit.

362
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,228
Ought to kick your ass
in the head.

363
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,105
Freezing.

364
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,110
I know. I was
in the motherfucker earlier.

365
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:40,240
Listen to me.
I want an exclusive.

366
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,253
A what?

367
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,187
The entire city
is looking for your ass.

368
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,951
The cops want payback.

369
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,823
How many times I got to tell you
I didn't kill no-goddamn-body?

370
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,385
Regardless,
they want your ass dead.

371
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,859
Franklin, I will protect you.

372
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:58,096
I'll get you turned in,
let you tell your story...

373
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,297
but I want the exclusive.

374
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:04,399
I'll hide you for the weekend.
It'll all be over on Monday.

375
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,307
I don't trust your ass.

376
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,245
How I know this exclusive shit
gonna clear my name?

377
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,872
I guess you don't.

378
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:13,509
But without me,
you'll probably end up dead.

379
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,951
They need someone to blame.

380
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,249
Right now, it's you.

381
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,415
What do you say?

382
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,155
I ain't staying
in this neighborhood.

383
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:25,958
I can't stay here
for no two days.

384
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,760
That's right. You can't.

385
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,198
What you talkin' about?

386
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,099
You're coming to my wedding.

387
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,002
Your wedding? Shit! Hell, no.

388
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,006
I ain't going nowhere.
Po-po looking for me.

389
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,168
Trying to kill me?
Staying on the low-low.

390
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,973
God damn.

391
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,502
How you do that?

392
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,105
Did a report once
on escape artists...

393
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:46,378
and the women who love them.

394
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,442
Teach me how to do that shit.

395
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,646
There's no time.

396
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:52,053
We got time.

397
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,584
I need you to take a shower,
shave, lose the earring...

398
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,086
and, please, do something
about that hair of yours.

399
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,326
What you talkin' about?
My 'do is tight.

400
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,700
Every cop in the city
is looking for that tight 'do.

401
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,706
I'll hook up the hair, but
I ain't touching the earring...

402
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,401
'cause I'm still a player!

403
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:12,671
I'm gonna make a phone call.

404
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,905
I don't think
there's any hot water left.

405
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,072
What?

406
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,014
You heard me.

407
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,984
Punk-ass white boy.
This tub better be clean.

408
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:26,382
Who is it?

409
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,790
Barclay, it's James.
How you doing?

410
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:31,260
I got Franklin Hatchett.

411
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,060
Don't play games with me.

412
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:36,066
Words like that give me
a stiffy.

413
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,965
At my age, I can't waste them.

414
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:42,098
I'm not kidding you.
He's at my place safe and sound.

415
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,173
Congratulations.
You're rehired.

416
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,178
I thought I was supposed
to clear out by Monday.

417
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:49,679
Didn't you say that?

418
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,877
You didn't really take
me seriously, did you?

419
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:56,876
You're Pulitzer material.
I've always said that.

420
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,549
I'll send a camera crew...

421
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,185
down to the 20th precinct
in an hour.

422
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:05,286
Not a chance. I'm going
to keep him until Monday.

423
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,592
For sweeps week.

424
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,861
Don't be foolish.

425
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,868
A bird in the hand
is worth a 10-share...

426
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,028
for the whole weekend.

427
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,766
Fuck you.

428
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,831
This is my story,
and you know it.

429
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:19,900
You're right. Monday it is.

430
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:22,846
Loser.

431
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,847
Freeze!

432
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:24,939
Vic Damone...

433
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,611
Get your hands on the car!

434
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:31,019
Vic Damone...
his music will last forever.

435
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:34,821
What the hell is a Vic Damone?

436
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,850
Vic Damone's Greatest Hits...

437
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,953
Ain't no greatest hit.
I ain't never heard it.

438
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,464
He thrilled the world...

439
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,659
when he married
actress Diahann Carroll.

440
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,497
Now he'll thrill you again...

441
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:47,129
How the hell an Italian get
a fine black woman like that?

442
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:49,867
The timeless hits
of Vic Damone.

443
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:51,738
He can't sing.

444
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,971
Only reason she married him
'cause he got money.

445
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,343
Takin' all our sisters.

446
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,189
I'm James Russell.

447
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,748
Those stories
along with Andy Rooney...

448
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,386
tonight on 60 minutes.

449
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,659
I'm out the door.

450
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,671
People are already showing up.

451
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,265
I am so sorry.
Something important came up.

452
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:25,434
More important
than our rehearsal dinner?

453
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:26,875
Of course not.

454
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,607
And I'm bringing
somebody with me.

455
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,171
Who?

456
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,809
Old, dear friend of mine
from college.

457
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:35,819
Just kind of ran into him today.

458
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:38,321
Are you all right?
You sound funny.

459
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,916
I'm perfect.

460
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,289
I'll see you soon.
I love you.

461
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,953
I love you, too. Hurry up.

462
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,896
Fuck me.

463
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,426
I'm gonna start the car.
I'll meet you in the courtyard.

464
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,698
Kiss my ass!

465
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,764
Find something that fits
then move your ass! We're late!

466
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,971
This tub wasn't clean,
you dirty-ass white boy!

467
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,276
You had to pick that one,
didn't you?

468
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,614
This your ride?

469
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,018
Yes, and that's my favorite
fucking suit you're wearing.

470
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:11,646
I look good, don't I?

471
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:15,386
Don't get mad 'cause I look
better than you in your shit.

472
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:17,894
I should be
Ebony Man of the Month.

473
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,624
Is that something
to be proud of?

474
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,030
You wouldn't know nothin'
about that with your goofy ass.

475
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:25,797
You fuck up the suit,
and we got a problem.

476
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,964
We already got a problem.

477
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,275
Look at this shit!

478
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:38,009
You hustlin' son of a bitch.

479
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,516
Look who's talking.

480
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,983
At least I've worked
for everything I have.

481
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:44,215
You worked yourself
right into some rich pussy.

482
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,189
No wonder you don't give
a damn if I'm innocent.

483
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,657
Your ass gonna get
married and retire.

484
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,286
Let's get things straight
about tonight's dinner.

485
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,421
You don't speak
unless spoken to.

486
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:54,431
You stay by my side.

487
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:56,592
If you try
anything fucked up or funny...

488
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,659
I will kill you myself.

489
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,432
Just like you did
back on the docks?

490
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,031
I will beat your ass.

491
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,373
You ain't beatin' shit, homes.

492
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:14,912
We went to Stanford,
which is where?

493
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:16,579
How the hell I supposed to know?

494
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,055
It's in the Bay Area, where you
graduated with honors in '88.

495
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,050
And your name tonight
is Jonathan Smith.

496
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,289
Fuck the Jonathan Smith.

497
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:26,819
I'm me.

498
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,533
Do not say a word about
my fiancée's weight.

499
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,729
She's very sensitive about that.

500
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,704
You must have one
of them fat-assed

501
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,402
Taco Bell, McDonald-eatin',
big-booty-assed...

502
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:39,409
Mr. Cipriani.

503
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:40,910
How are you?

504
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,776
How many times I got to
tell you? Call me Dad.

505
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,374
- You're not getting nervous?
- Who wouldn't be?

506
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,906
That's true. Who's this?

507
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,851
This is
a very good friend of mine.

508
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:49,978
Vic Damone.

509
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:52,515
Junior.

510
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,685
He's Diahann Carroll's kid
and Vic Damone's kid.

511
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,195
So you're half and half Italian.

512
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,960
Hey, paisan.

513
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:05,264
Me and your father?
Forget about it. Come here.

514
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:11,435
Mamma mia!

515
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:14,000
God, your house...

516
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,876
Magnifico!

517
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:18,211
Molto bella!
Tutti frutti!

518
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,240
Where'd you learn
to talk Italian?

519
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:22,013
Did Vic talk to you in Italian
when you were a kid?

520
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,179
All the time.

521
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,745
Here she is!

522
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,417
It's nice of you to show up.

523
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,926
I'm terribly sorry.

524
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:33,692
Fiancée Grace,
this is my friend Vic.

525
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,029
You're phat.

526
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:46,005
P-h-a-t...
Pretty, hot, and tempting.

527
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:47,567
I'm stunned by your phatness.

528
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:51,173
You're a lucky man to have
such a phat-ass fiancée.

529
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:52,375
She fine.

530
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,510
Thanks.

531
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,541
You're welcome.

532
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,589
You made it.

533
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,592
I thought you'd be off
covering that prison escape...

534
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,423
with the rest of
the low-life sensationalists.

535
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,826
Mother, give it a rest.

536
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:08,059
Actually, I am covering that
sort of indirectly, Mom.

537
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,896
How many times do
I have to tell you...

538
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,629
to call me Mrs. Cipriani?

539
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,537
Connie, this is Vic Damone Jr.
He's Jimmy's good friend.

540
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,064
Tell us what it was like
growing up in show biz.

541
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,542
Everybody's interested.

542
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,374
I had a lot of friends.

543
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,176
Junior Walker Jr.,
Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.

544
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,206
We hang out all the time.

545
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,913
And what do you do now,
Mr. Damone Jr.?

546
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,184
- I'm in...
- Sales.

547
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,020
- Retail?
- Seats.

548
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,457
On the stock exchange.

549
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,290
- Broker?
- Ticket scalper.

550
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,024
I can get you anything if you
let me know ahead of time.

551
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,053
He's a funny guy.

552
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:45,000
He's hysterical. Kills me.

553
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,561
How about
some nice Dom Pérignon '85?

554
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,199
How about some Colt.45?

555
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,908
Would you excuse me
for one second?

556
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,379
I need to talk to you.

557
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,442
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

558
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:05,920
I'm mingling
with the rich folks.

559
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:08,287
I'm locking your ass
in the fucking closet...

560
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:09,518
for the rest of the weekend.

561
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,220
Don't even start with me.

562
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:13,161
You the one
brought me out here...

563
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:15,460
in Beverly Hills mingling
with these uppity-ass people.

564
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:18,092
I'm wanted for murder,
my life on the line...

565
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:19,499
What about my life?

566
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:22,996
I'm lookin' at your life.

567
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,736
Grace! What's up?

568
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,300
This is beautiful.

569
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:33,105
I couldn't be happier
for you and James.

570
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:35,481
It's about time
he settled down...

571
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:37,247
after all the women
he been through.

572
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:38,982
And those twins in school
wasn't his.

573
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:40,489
That was all a lie.

574
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:41,990
He had a lot of women.

575
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:43,583
He had all the women.

576
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:47,118
All the women, all the guys,
I fucked them all.

577
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:49,188
Here we go.

578
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,063
I'd like to propose a toast.

579
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,068
Ladies and gentlemen!

580
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:55,434
Everybody!

581
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:56,631
I'm going to propose a toast!

582
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:58,265
This is Vic Damone's son.

583
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,548
If you don't mind.

584
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,079
You're James' first,
his last, his everything.

585
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:18,022
And you're the answer
to all his dreams.

586
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:23,858
You're his sun, his moon,
his guiding star.

587
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,800
You're kind of wonderful,
that's what you are.

588
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:29,168
He knows
there's only one of you...

589
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:31,503
Isn't that Barry White?

590
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:34,601
There's no way
he could have made two.

591
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:37,476
You're all he's living for.

592
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:40,507
Your love...

593
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,812
he'll keep forevermore.

594
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:44,445
You're his first...

595
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:46,785
his last...

596
00:33:46,823 --> 00:33:48,381
his everything.

597
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:00,492
That was beautiful.

598
00:34:00,536 --> 00:34:02,834
I do what I can do
when I can do it.

599
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:06,272
Congratulations.

600
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:10,645
You got a phone?

601
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,840
Thank you.

602
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,680
You can see
this kid is Italian.

603
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,310
He feels deep.

604
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:33,858
Hey, baby, what's up?
It's me.

605
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:35,427
Don't you "baby, it's me" me.

606
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:38,065
I saw your ass on the news,
talking you killed some cop.

607
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:39,074
What?

608
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:40,336
I just saw you on the news.

609
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,207
I didn't kill nobody!

610
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:43,906
You killed some cop!

611
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:46,608
Once again, you are in trouble!
What did you do anyway?

612
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:49,413
Don't yell at me!
Are you gonna let me talk?

613
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:52,910
Listen!
Stop watching the goddamn news!

614
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:54,422
Somebody set me up!

615
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:56,084
Where have you been
for the last 24 hours?

616
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,752
You better not be over
no girl's house!

617
00:34:57,794 --> 00:35:00,820
I ain't over
at no goddamn girl's house!

618
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:03,457
I'm wanted! I ain't got time
to get no pussy!

619
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:04,932
I ain't fuckin' nobody but you.

620
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:08,636
What about this guy named
Carmine called here...

621
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:12,266
saying he's gonna kill us
if you don't give him $25,000?

622
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:15,770
I don't owe him
no goddamn $25,000!

623
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:17,006
We got him.

624
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:19,879
He's calling from
a 310 area code, a 274 prefix.

625
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,508
What's he doing
in Beverly Hills?

626
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:23,382
Lock the doors
and don't answer the phone...

627
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:24,613
and get under the bed!

628
00:35:24,654 --> 00:35:26,121
I'm on my way!

629
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,486
Get under the...

630
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,427
Somebody bothering you?

631
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,397
Everything's cool.

632
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,922
Frank Sinatra Jr.
Got in trouble again.

633
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,901
They got it down
to a one-block radius.

634
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:44,430
He's on Roxbury
between Sunset and Lexington.

635
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:45,873
They're gonna check on it.

636
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,207
Where do you think you're going?

637
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:51,076
I'm leaving. I'm out.

638
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:52,376
You're out?

639
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:54,315
Who'd you call, your partner?

640
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,580
Partner? What the hell
you talkin' about?

641
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:58,086
I called my girl.

642
00:35:58,121 --> 00:36:00,646
She's pregnant,
and she needs me, and I'm out.

643
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,317
That is not part of our deal!

644
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:03,916
Damn our deal!

645
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,427
I ain't dealin' my life away.

646
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:08,760
Why you hustling me?
Why you won't just turn me in?

647
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:10,197
What you waitin' on?

648
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:11,461
I thought so.

649
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,798
This is bullshit.
You got me running...

650
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:15,429
I'm helping you.
You gotta help me, too.

651
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:16,904
I need your story
live on Monday.

652
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:18,406
It's sweeps week.

653
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:20,942
Fuck sweeps week!

654
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:22,274
I'm wanted for murder...

655
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:24,370
you talking about
a goddamn broom!

656
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:25,937
Get me a taxi!

657
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:34,215
What is your sweeps week thing
again?

658
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:38,320
You didn't tell me
where you're going.

659
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:41,426
You have to trust me.
I'm onto something big.

660
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:42,931
What am I
going to tell everybody?

661
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:44,159
You'll think of something.

662
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,827
I'll be back
first thing in the morning.

663
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:49,569
I love you.

664
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:54,703
I know.

665
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,511
You better not be lying to me.

666
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:00,482
What the hell
I got to lie to you for?

667
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:02,313
I happen to know
how your type operates.

668
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:03,545
My type?

669
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:04,883
Why the hell you take my type...

670
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:07,082
to your goddamn dinner
rehearsal for a damn story?

671
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:08,590
I'm stuck with you.

672
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:10,524
I figured your white ass out.

673
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,857
You have?

674
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:12,986
You're full of shit.

675
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:15,395
You one desperate-ass
middle-class white boy...

676
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:17,922
that don't give a damn who you
step on to get what you want.

677
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:19,559
Get your priorities straight.

678
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:20,569
My priorities?

679
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:22,093
Your goddamn priorities.

680
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:23,901
I'm not the one
wanted for murder.

681
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,170
I'm sick
of your smart-ass comments.

682
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,972
You know I ain't murdered
no-goddamn-body.

683
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,944
You the reason
why I'm in this shit.

684
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:32,277
I was minding my own business...

685
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:34,545
living ghetto fabulous,
I wasn't messin' with nobody.

686
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,017
You fucked that up.

687
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:38,316
You know how much money I was
making down at that car wash?

688
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:39,946
A buck, 2.98?

689
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,854
I will slap the hell outta you.

690
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:43,825
You don't know
who you messin' with.

691
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,829
I don't even know
when I'm gonna slap somebody.

692
00:37:46,863 --> 00:37:48,956
I be like, "Why did I do that?"

693
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:51,592
I don't know
when I be slappin' people.

694
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:53,033
Keep messin' with me.
I'm dangerous.

695
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:54,559
I'm scared of myself.

696
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:55,935
They call me "snap and pop..."

697
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:57,997
'cause I'll snap
and pop your ass in the mouth.

698
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,271
Don't mess with me.
Better watch your back.

699
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,744
Even in the shower,
eatin' at picnics...

700
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:05,508
you better watch your
goddamn back. Make a right.

701
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,683
There's my crib.

702
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:14,849
And there goes your stakeout.

703
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,926
Turn down here.
I know a shortcut.

704
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:29,102
She just turned the lights out.

705
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:30,628
You're up, sport.

706
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,421
What the hell is
wrong with you? It's me!

707
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:52,893
Don't take that tone with me.

708
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:55,727
I should crack
your thick-ass skull right now.

709
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:57,426
Leaving me here all alone!

710
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:59,434
Is this the kind of father
that you're gonna be?

711
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:01,561
I'll move back to Riverside.

712
00:39:01,604 --> 00:39:02,935
Don't think that I won't.

713
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:04,439
Would you calm down?

714
00:39:04,473 --> 00:39:06,498
What's up with the hair
and that suit?

715
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:08,635
You look like you stepped out
of a casket!

716
00:39:08,678 --> 00:39:10,771
Calm down!

717
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,281
You know I ain't killed nobody.

718
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:14,681
It's me.

719
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:18,379
You know I need you.

720
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:20,855
Why you think
I came over here so fast?

721
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,358
I'm worried about you.

722
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,791
I'm sorry.

723
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:26,021
You know I love you.

724
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:37,034
She just
turned the lights back on.

725
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:40,205
Let's go.

726
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:42,233
Who is this?

727
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:43,472
And what is he doing here?

728
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:44,479
That's...

729
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:45,707
James Russell,
Channel 12 News.

730
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:47,648
The weatherman?
What are you doing with him?

731
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:49,651
That's just my white friend.

732
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:51,050
He gonna help me
get outta this mess.

733
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:53,214
But what about Carmine
and the money you owe him?

734
00:39:53,255 --> 00:39:54,449
Don't worry about that
'cause he's lyin'.

735
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,050
I do not owe him no $25,000!

736
00:39:57,093 --> 00:40:00,221
I owe him $7,000.
He added on interest.

737
00:40:00,262 --> 00:40:01,627
I don't even know why I asked.

738
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,825
I'm sorry. Calm down.

739
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:05,527
Don't worry about it.

740
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:08,503
- How you doin'?
- I'm OK.

741
00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:09,663
How the baby doin'?

742
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:10,763
He fine.

743
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:12,068
How my baby boy doin'?

744
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:14,167
You ain't
worrying about nothin'.

745
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,543
My baby come out with two toes,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

746
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,047
You've had the sonogram?

747
00:40:19,081 --> 00:40:20,207
- What?
- What?

748
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:22,740
Sonogram? Did a three-part
exposé a few years back...

749
00:40:22,785 --> 00:40:23,843
on pre-natal health care.

750
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:26,047
We discovered that not only...

751
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:27,521
Police. Open the door.

752
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,717
We know you're in there.

753
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:31,021
In a minute!

754
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,927
I don't know what else to say.

755
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:35,453
Gimme your pager number.

756
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:36,590
What for?

757
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:40,231
Open this fucking door,
or we're gonna break it in!

758
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:41,930
Anything go wrong, you page me.

759
00:40:41,971 --> 00:40:44,462
You can reach me there.
Everything gonna be all right.

760
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:45,838
I'll take care of him.

761
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:51,411
- Police!
- Wait a minute!

762
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,847
Do you have a warrant?
What do you want?

763
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:55,111
We want your boyfriend.

764
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:56,778
Window!

765
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,286
You can't keep busting...

766
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,309
Shut up!

767
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,525
Wait for me!

768
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:17,465
Come on!

769
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:35,119
What the hell
are you shooting at?

770
00:41:35,157 --> 00:41:37,421
He's a cop killer!

771
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,189
Don't be
trying to kill everybody.

772
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:41,458
For Christ's sake!

773
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,964
Right here. This is it.

774
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,161
Turn here.

775
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,704
All you've been doing
is bitchin'...

776
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,573
ever since we got together.

777
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,079
So I'm bitching.
I'm not used to getting shot at.

778
00:41:58,114 --> 00:42:01,049
I'm not used to people getting
me into shit, so shut up.

779
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,983
That French dude
who killed those cops...

780
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:05,043
had a stamp on his hand
from this club.

781
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:06,577
A lot of Euro-trash
hang out here.

782
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:07,850
We're gonna go in here.

783
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,915
If we see him,
we're gonna call the cops...

784
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,950
get him busted,
and clear my name tonight.

785
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:16,462
Can I handle this?

786
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:26,072
Good evening.
James Russell, Channel 12 News.

787
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:28,076
We're doing
a report on local nightclubs.

788
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,270
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

789
00:42:29,311 --> 00:42:32,280
Oh, you're
the investigative reporter.

790
00:42:35,184 --> 00:42:36,151
Yes, I am.

791
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:39,518
Get the fuck out of here.

792
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,625
You got
a lot of pull in this town.

793
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,897
I could do a report
on this shithole...

794
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:54,061
that'd close it down forever.

795
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:56,499
Fuck that.

796
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:57,938
If we can't go
to the Red Camel...

797
00:42:57,973 --> 00:42:59,031
Red Camel comes to us.

798
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:00,336
What are you talking about?

799
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:01,468
Just come on.

800
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:06,077
- Where are you going?
- Shut the hell up.

801
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:07,673
Bring your ass on.

802
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:11,448
Gimme a quarter.

803
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,413
Hurry up and gimme a quarter!

804
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:25,898
Who are you calling?

805
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:32,170
It's Mike Vermishki.
Remember me?

806
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,937
You done fucked with me
for the last time!

807
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:35,807
There's a bomb in the building!

808
00:43:35,844 --> 00:43:38,369
That's right!
A goddamn bomb in the building!

809
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:41,609
Get your ass out...

810
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,810
Fuck you!

811
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:48,554
There's a bomb in the building,
and it's fixin' to blow!

812
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:51,651
You better get your ass out
right now!

813
00:43:51,694 --> 00:43:53,525
You have crossed the fucking...

814
00:43:55,531 --> 00:43:56,520
Watch this.

815
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:01,530
Five, four, three...

816
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,299
two, one.

817
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:07,239
Move it!

818
00:44:08,143 --> 00:44:09,201
Voilá.

819
00:44:15,884 --> 00:44:18,079
That's him right there.
That's one right there.

820
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,054
- You sure?
- I'm sure!

821
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,055
That bitch fine.

822
00:44:24,193 --> 00:44:25,285
Wait a minute.

823
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,429
Let's go.

824
00:44:50,886 --> 00:44:52,353
This is crazy.

825
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:31,349
What the hell is...

826
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,134
When we get in here,
you don't say nothin'.

827
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:30,008
Only two white people
walked in here.

828
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:32,138
Keep your mouth shut, you'll
be the first one to walk out.

829
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:35,810
And another thing.
You ain't white, you mixed.

830
00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:38,786
Your mama black and your daddy
Puerto Rican if they ask you.

831
00:47:48,964 --> 00:47:50,090
What?

832
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:52,566
Aaron here?
Franklin want to talk to him.

833
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:55,229
Aaron don't know
no damn Franklin.

834
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,737
How the hell you know?

835
00:47:56,772 --> 00:47:59,570
Tell him I was there when he
shot Baby Bro at MacArthur Park.

836
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:01,007
Where'd he shoot Baby Bro?

837
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:02,840
At MacArthur Park,
you big dumb...

838
00:48:02,878 --> 00:48:04,243
Where'd he shoot him?

839
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:07,009
In the ass! Everybody know
he got shot in the ass!

840
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,410
Don't ever play me like that,
player-hater.

841
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:13,318
I'm sorry.
I was just playin'.

842
00:48:13,355 --> 00:48:14,845
Black bastard.

843
00:48:19,328 --> 00:48:21,193
What's happening?

844
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:26,732
What's up?

845
00:48:26,768 --> 00:48:29,635
I tried calling you,
couldn't get through.

846
00:48:29,671 --> 00:48:31,104
But anyway, I need your help.

847
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,766
I need some gats on credit.

848
00:48:32,808 --> 00:48:34,207
Again?

849
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:36,973
Again? Last time,
you know that wasn't my mistake.

850
00:48:37,012 --> 00:48:38,309
That was Little Johnny
who fucked up the money.

851
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:42,613
You know Little Johnny
is Invisible Johnny now, right?

852
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:45,552
I went to the funeral.
That was fucked up what you did.

853
00:48:45,587 --> 00:48:47,054
It was a closed casket
and everything.

854
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:48,283
But I appreciate this
if you do this.

855
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:52,986
You get me two courtside...

856
00:48:53,028 --> 00:48:54,996
if it goes seven games,
on the floor...

857
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,622
and I don't mean
behind the backboard.

858
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:59,099
I gave you the wrong tickets
by mistake.

859
00:48:59,134 --> 00:49:01,932
It's done.
If it goes 700 games, I got you.

860
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,460
Done.

861
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:06,741
What the fuck is this shit?

862
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:10,006
He's cool. He's just
a reporter from Channel 5 News.

863
00:49:10,045 --> 00:49:11,034
Reporter?

864
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:13,978
What the hell...

865
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:15,540
What's he reporting on,
my lifestyle?

866
00:49:15,584 --> 00:49:16,983
He gonna help me out!

867
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:19,214
Help you do what?

868
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:20,687
Help me to clear my name!

869
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:22,189
You fuck me up here...

870
00:49:22,224 --> 00:49:23,657
the only thing your name
is gonna be good for...

871
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:25,091
is a goddamn tombstone.

872
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:27,095
He don't know nothin'
about you. He here for me.

873
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:29,290
He don't know nothin' about
the hos, guns, and drugs.

874
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:31,924
I won't bring no shit
down on you.

875
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:34,800
Look at me now.
How far we go back?

876
00:49:34,836 --> 00:49:36,497
Elementary?

877
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:38,130
Jump rope?

878
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:40,572
Hide-and-go-seek?

879
00:49:41,643 --> 00:49:42,632
Pitty-pat?

880
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:45,441
Red light, green light?

881
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:51,112
What would our mamas say
see us like this?

882
00:49:51,153 --> 00:49:53,621
All the stuff we been through?

883
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:55,213
We boys.

884
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:58,390
Cool?

885
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:03,929
Come with me.

886
00:50:13,675 --> 00:50:15,404
So you say you got problems?

887
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:21,179
Itty-bitty,
teeny-weeny problems.

888
00:50:22,517 --> 00:50:24,849
Big fat-ass problems.

889
00:50:27,022 --> 00:50:28,683
I got what you need.

890
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:33,051
There's no itch that an...

891
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:36,531
HK-MP5 can't scratch.

892
00:50:37,532 --> 00:50:40,501
Unless you want a...

893
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:45,336
Uzi
with a Wilson suppresser on it.

894
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:47,001
Very nice.

895
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:48,509
Very...

896
00:50:48,543 --> 00:50:50,511
urban.

897
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:53,207
I'd go with the Heckler & Koch.

898
00:50:53,248 --> 00:50:55,375
It's got a closed bolt,
as opposed to the Uzi.

899
00:50:55,417 --> 00:51:00,013
It's got a faster cyclic rate,
better sights, rear aperture.

900
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:01,989
It's German,
as opposed to Israeli.

901
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:03,651
It's much more accurate than...

902
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:05,319
Look, Dan Rather.

903
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:08,562
You sure you not a cop?

904
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:10,462
I'm sure I'm not a cop.

905
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:13,832
I did a report last year
on street weapons.

906
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:15,837
If you don't shut up, the last
report you're gonna hear...

907
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:18,567
is this Uzi
going off in your ass.

908
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:21,041
I don't mean
to disrespect your shit...

909
00:51:21,076 --> 00:51:23,977
but this is too heavy.

910
00:51:24,012 --> 00:51:25,479
I need something lighter...

911
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:27,482
'cause we're gonna be doing
a lot of running.

912
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:29,450
See this here?
One or two of these.

913
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:30,974
This is all I need.

914
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:32,646
Couple of these, and I'm cool.

915
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:34,155
I'll pay you back.
I'm good for it.

916
00:51:35,624 --> 00:51:36,784
What?

917
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:39,521
Call me if you get in trouble.

918
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:41,495
I'm gonna call you.
And thank you again.

919
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,327
I'm gonna get you
that money soon.

920
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:54,867
I just got
the Interpol report back...

921
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,003
on the John Doe they picked up
at the airport yesterday.

922
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:59,013
This is our guy.
Raymond Villard.

923
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:00,514
Last known residence: Belgium.

924
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:02,449
He's wanted for killing a cop
in Paris...

925
00:52:02,484 --> 00:52:04,452
convicted of a jewelry heist
in London...

926
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:06,511
wanted for killing someone else
in Cologne.

927
00:52:06,555 --> 00:52:07,954
It goes on and on.

928
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:09,422
I don't think so.

929
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,359
This guy could turn up laying
flat on his face in that bus.

930
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:14,624
Forensics ain't done
with the bodies yet.

931
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:16,654
I still think Hatchett's
our man.

932
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:17,960
Not according to this.

933
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:19,694
Got a nice videotape
of your suspect here.

934
00:52:19,735 --> 00:52:21,726
It's from the security camera
in the deli.

935
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,761
We'll see.

936
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:28,976
And now a live report
from the scene.

937
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,477
A cold-blooded murder...

938
00:52:30,512 --> 00:52:32,480
last night in a deli
here in downtown L.A.

939
00:52:32,514 --> 00:52:34,982
Homicide detectives have
identified the two gunmen...

940
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:37,484
through the use
of a surveillance camera tape.

941
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:39,987
We're told they are
Franklin Maurice Hatchett...

942
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:43,479
and an unnamed reporter
from Channel 12 News.

943
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:44,992
Hatchett is already wanted...

944
00:52:45,026 --> 00:52:47,824
in connection with the death of
14 inmates and 2 policemen...

945
00:52:47,863 --> 00:52:50,331
during
a daring prison escape at...

946
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:51,992
I have this late word just in.

947
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:55,093
Police have released the name
of the second suspect...

948
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:57,662
and he is James Russell
of Channel 12 News.

949
00:52:57,706 --> 00:53:00,470
We'll continue to update you
on this breaking story...

950
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:01,669
as developments warrant.

951
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,075
Now back to you in the studio.

952
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,447
The eensy-weensy spider...

953
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:12,112
walked up the waterspout.

954
00:53:12,154 --> 00:53:14,952
Down came the rain...

955
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,184
And washed...

956
00:53:16,224 --> 00:53:18,089
How you doing?

957
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:20,890
- Morning, folks.
- Have something to eat.

958
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:22,453
I gotta talk to Grace.

959
00:53:22,497 --> 00:53:23,964
I'll take a little something.

960
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:25,967
I'm a little hungry.

961
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:28,970
I was wondering when you was
gonna ask me to sit down.

962
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:31,973
I think we're interrupting
a very tender breakfast here.

963
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:33,406
That's cool. Is it cool?

964
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:35,466
The kids say it's cool.

965
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,808
Go take care
of your business with Grace.

966
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:39,279
Talk to Grace
as long as you want.

967
00:53:39,314 --> 00:53:40,975
I'm gonna come and get you
when I'm through.

968
00:53:44,553 --> 00:53:46,453
I love it, man.
Nervous about the wedding.

969
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:48,479
Best friend in the world.

970
00:53:48,523 --> 00:53:50,718
Did you tell Vic
I want him to call me?

971
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:52,488
He said
he was gonna call you soon.

972
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:53,994
He was happy
to hear from you, too.

973
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:55,929
Terrific. What do you want
for breakfast?

974
00:53:55,964 --> 00:53:57,932
Whatever y'all got.
I can eat anything.

975
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:59,490
You want some bacon and eggs?

976
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:01,001
Wait a minute. You're Italian.

977
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:03,997
Make him a nice vilosh.

978
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,576
Put a nice gravy of ragu
and some sausages on the side.

979
00:54:09,611 --> 00:54:11,101
Is that OKwith you?

980
00:54:11,146 --> 00:54:12,443
OKwith me.

981
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,812
And give me
some Italian grits on the side.

982
00:54:17,986 --> 00:54:21,046
- Thanks, Ma.
- That's your mama?

983
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:25,523
That's how the rich stay rich.
Keep it in the family.

984
00:54:27,095 --> 00:54:29,188
So how's the mistress
of the house this morning?

985
00:54:31,499 --> 00:54:34,593
I've never been
anybody's mistress.

986
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:38,538
He was my first, my last,
my everything.

987
00:54:38,573 --> 00:54:40,165
Baby.

988
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:44,501
Excuse me.

989
00:54:50,518 --> 00:54:52,145
You pissed her off.

990
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:53,347
She always like that?

991
00:54:54,556 --> 00:54:56,183
But she's worth it.

992
00:54:57,759 --> 00:54:59,989
What's going on? Oh, shit!

993
00:55:00,028 --> 00:55:01,154
What's in the paper?

994
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:03,391
Nothing.

995
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:08,768
So what'd you get the newlyweds
for their wedding gift?

996
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:11,700
I'll show you.

997
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,707
You got it already?

998
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:13,969
Come on.

999
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:22,139
This is another house.

1000
00:55:24,786 --> 00:55:26,447
How rich are you?

1001
00:55:26,488 --> 00:55:28,956
Loan me a million dollars.

1002
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,457
You gonna loan it to me?

1003
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:31,959
I was just playing.

1004
00:55:31,993 --> 00:55:33,961
How many people sleep
in this bed?

1005
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:37,453
Me and Connie. That's it.

1006
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:38,431
This is incredible.

1007
00:55:38,466 --> 00:55:40,434
Let me spend the night.

1008
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:42,459
Anytime. You ready?

1009
00:55:42,504 --> 00:55:44,301
I'm ready? Is this the gift?

1010
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:45,328
This is it.

1011
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,149
That's nice. That's tight.

1012
00:55:55,183 --> 00:55:57,310
That's nice, but...

1013
00:55:57,352 --> 00:55:58,842
What?

1014
00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:02,415
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. That's cool.

1015
00:56:02,457 --> 00:56:03,651
That's all right.

1016
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:05,284
You hooking them up
on some Liberace-type shit.

1017
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:06,794
What's wrong with it?

1018
00:56:06,828 --> 00:56:08,295
That's Bulgari.

1019
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,456
Forget about it. It's cool.

1020
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:13,457
They're not gonna like it?

1021
00:56:14,803 --> 00:56:16,771
You know something.

1022
00:56:16,805 --> 00:56:18,670
Did they say something to you?

1023
00:56:18,707 --> 00:56:20,436
Forget about it.
I can't be saying nothing.

1024
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:21,965
I'm not in the family like that.

1025
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,001
Be a friend. Tell me.

1026
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:28,680
If I tell you this,
you can't them I told you.

1027
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:30,344
Why would I do that?

1028
00:56:33,188 --> 00:56:35,713
I happen to know that
the newlyweds want a dope ride.

1029
00:56:35,757 --> 00:56:38,248
We don't do dope
in this family.

1030
00:56:39,394 --> 00:56:41,123
Not dope. A ride.

1031
00:56:41,162 --> 00:56:43,790
My chauffeur
will take them anywhere.

1032
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:45,857
Not a ride. I mean a car.

1033
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,130
Oh, a car.

1034
00:56:48,169 --> 00:56:49,966
I got a lot of cars.
Which one did they want?

1035
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:51,438
They want the Bentley?
The Rolls?

1036
00:56:51,473 --> 00:56:53,464
Not any type of car.

1037
00:56:53,508 --> 00:56:55,874
They want a European type-X
racer car.

1038
00:56:57,545 --> 00:56:59,672
Where am I gonna get that
by tomorrow morning?

1039
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:03,480
I think we can get one.
I know a place.

1040
00:57:03,518 --> 00:57:05,611
I'll take these back.

1041
00:57:05,653 --> 00:57:08,520
Why don't you let me keep them?
I'll give them back to you.

1042
00:57:08,556 --> 00:57:11,389
I'm just playing, unless
you're gonna let me keep it.

1043
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:13,417
You brought a killer
into my parents' house!

1044
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:14,928
Are you even listening to me?

1045
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:16,931
Franklin may be
a lot of things...

1046
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:18,432
but he is not a killer.

1047
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:20,400
- Trust me on this one.
- I am trying.

1048
00:57:20,435 --> 00:57:22,266
We're supposed to be
in this together.

1049
00:57:22,303 --> 00:57:23,429
We are.

1050
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:25,439
- What about tomorrow?
- I'll be here.

1051
00:57:25,473 --> 00:57:26,940
You are wanted for murder.

1052
00:57:26,975 --> 00:57:28,966
We can't get married
when you're wanted for murder.

1053
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:31,104
You're right.

1054
00:57:33,915 --> 00:57:36,406
I'm telling you, we're gonna
have fun at the Auto Expo.

1055
00:57:37,285 --> 00:57:38,877
Oh, fuck me.

1056
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:46,221
Next item up
is a Mercedes 1957 gull-wing.

1057
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:48,456
Only 1,400 of these were made.

1058
00:57:48,496 --> 00:57:50,964
Let's open up the bidding
at $100,000.

1059
00:57:50,999 --> 00:57:52,466
One hundred's there.
One hundred five now.

1060
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,060
Go 110... 110 out back.

1061
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:56,968
One hundred fifteen
to the lady there. And 120...

1062
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:58,802
All my old friends in here.

1063

1203
01:06:33,486 --> 01:06:35,716
No. James is innocent.

1204
01:06:35,754 --> 01:06:38,222
Is this other guy
Vic Damone's son, or isn't he?

There's no wedding.

1211
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:50,461
You're not gonna marry
this James.

1212
01:06:50,503 --> 01:06:52,403
But we've got 300 people
coming here tomorrow.

1213

01:06:55,641 --> 01:06:57,472
And what am I supposed
to tell them?

1216
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:59,478
You tell them that our Grace
was about to be married...

1217
01:06:59,512 --> 01:07:01,480
to some no-good,
limp-dick bastard!

1218
01:07:01,514 --> 01:07:02,776
He is not limp-dicked.

1219
01:07:02,815 --> 01:07:04,680
I don't wanna hear that!

1220
01:07:04,717 --> 01:07:07,413

Let's not jump to conclusions.

1222
01:07:08,954 --> 01:07:10,251
I'm gonna tell you something.

1223
01:07:10,289 --> 01:07:11,984
This James comes in here,
I break his legs.

1224
01:07:12,024 --> 01:07:14,390
And as far as Vic Damone Jr...
That's not Vic Damone Jr.!

1225
01:07:14,426 --> 01:07:15,723
What the hell am I saying?

1226
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:17,490

You sure?

1230
01:07:59,104 --> 01:08:00,628
Yes, nigger, I'm sure!

1231
01:08:02,942 --> 01:08:05,103
- Look under the table.
- What?

1232
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:09,446
Look at that.

1233
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:13,078
You done gone and done it now.

1234
01:08:13,118 --> 01:08:14,415
'Cause this scares me.

1235
01:08:14,453 --> 01:08:15,920
What you talking about?

1236
01:08:15,955 --> 01:08:17,923
This gonna take care of us
for the rest of our life.

1237
01:08:17,957 --> 01:08:19,481
We won't have to do shit else.

1238
01:08:19,525 --> 01:08:22,221
What we gonna do?
Where we gonna go?

1239
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:25,924
We can go wherever the hell
we wanna go with this shit.

1240
01:08:25,965 --> 01:08:28,092
I was thinking about
buying a small country.

1241
01:08:28,133 --> 01:08:30,158
This is wrong.

1242
01:08:30,202 --> 01:08:31,669
This is right!

1243
01:08:31,704 --> 01:08:33,934
It can't get no righter!

1244
01:08:33,973 --> 01:08:36,100
This is the only way
out of this shit I'm in.

1245
01:08:36,141 --> 01:08:37,904
Here's the number
for this policeman.

1246
01:08:37,943 --> 01:08:39,604
You want me to call the cops?

1247
01:08:41,347 --> 01:08:44,214
You want me to call them
so they can shoot me.

1248
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,945
My baby ain't gonna be
no fugitive.

1249
01:08:45,985 --> 01:08:47,782
You don't wanna call the cops,
fine.

1250
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,913
Maybe that reporter
can clear this whole thing up.

1251
01:08:54,493 --> 01:08:55,960
Fuck him.

1252
01:08:58,297 --> 01:09:01,698
And don't give me that look
'cause it ain't gonna work.

1253
01:09:03,302 --> 01:09:06,203
Don't even give me that look.
I see you looking at me.

1254
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,931
One more time.

1255
01:09:10,943 --> 01:09:12,103
Think.

1256
01:09:14,513 --> 01:09:16,572
Where are my diamonds?

1257
01:09:30,195 --> 01:09:31,457
Gimme a kiss.

1258
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:38,963
Hey, James, that you?

1259
01:09:39,004 --> 01:09:43,304
I want the diamonds,
or your partner's dead.

1260
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:44,900
Partner? I ain't got
no goddamn partner!

1261
01:09:44,943 --> 01:09:46,069
Who the fuck is this?

1262
01:09:47,146 --> 01:09:48,443
Listen to me.

1263
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,277
I'm with some people
who've promised to kill me...

1264
01:09:50,316 --> 01:09:52,011
unless you give them
those diamonds...

1265
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:53,951
the ones you forgot to mention!

1266
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,112
What diamonds?

1267
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:57,486
The fucking diamonds,
you prick!

1268
01:09:57,523 --> 01:09:59,115
Medulla alagata.

1269
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:00,420
What?

1270
01:10:00,459 --> 01:10:01,949
Tell them to shoot you
in the medulla alagata...

1271
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:04,292
right behind the ear.
You won't feel shit.

1272
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:05,957
This isn't a joke.

1273
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:07,863
I'm in some deep shit here.

1274
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:10,968
Listen to me.

1275
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:14,495
Three A.M.
Hangar number seven.

1276
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,508
Long Beach airport.

1277
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:19,511
Keep the diamonds
in the plastic bag.

1278
01:10:19,545 --> 01:10:20,637
They will be weighed.

1279
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:21,771
Kiss my ass!

1280
01:10:21,814 --> 01:10:25,443
We meet where I say we meet,
French motherfucker.

1281
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,010
What happened?

1282
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:33,218
He hung up.

1283
01:10:33,258 --> 01:10:35,488
We meet on his turf,
then your ass be all alone.

1284
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:38,496
Meet on my turf,
at least we got a chance.

1285
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,020
He'll call back.

1286
01:10:42,534 --> 01:10:44,434
What'd I tell you?

1287
01:10:45,471 --> 01:10:46,961
All right, motherfucker,
this is the deal.

1288
01:10:47,005 --> 01:10:48,336
Watch your language!

1289
01:10:48,374 --> 01:10:51,002
Mama, I ain't know it you!

1290
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:52,510
I ain't killed no cops.

1291
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,011
Call me back.

1292
01:10:54,046 --> 01:10:56,014
Stop watching the news.

1293
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:57,879
Don't be believing
everything on the news.

1294
01:11:02,988 --> 01:11:04,250
Who is this?

1295
01:11:04,289 --> 01:11:06,382
I'm listening.

1296
01:11:06,425 --> 01:11:08,450
This is the deal.

1297
01:11:08,494 --> 01:11:10,223
Fifty yard line,
Coliseum, three A.M.

1298
01:11:10,262 --> 01:11:11,923
And if Jimmy boy ain't alive...

1299
01:11:11,964 --> 01:11:13,488
you can kiss
them diamonds good-bye.

1300
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,094
Tonight,
I'm gonna pay your ass off...

1301
01:11:17,136 --> 01:11:18,364
in diamonds.

1302
01:11:20,005 --> 01:11:22,473
Where's a piece of shit
like you get diamonds?

1303
01:11:22,508 --> 01:11:24,635
Coliseum, three A.M.

1304
01:11:27,813 --> 01:11:28,939
Williams.

1305
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:30,141
Hey, cop.

1306
01:11:31,517 --> 01:11:32,984
This is Franklin Hatchett.

1307
01:11:33,018 --> 01:11:34,645
Meet me at the Coliseum,
three A.M.

1308
01:11:36,522 --> 01:11:37,489
Be there.

1309
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:38,990
We'll be there.

1310
01:11:39,024 --> 01:11:41,993
That was Hatchett.
He wants to turn himself in.

1311
01:11:42,027 --> 01:11:43,494
I'm gonna go tell the captain.

1312
01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:44,996
No way, buddy.

1313
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:46,998
This is our collar.
You and me. Us.

1314
01:11:47,032 --> 01:11:48,192
Let's go.

1315
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:02,775
Roland, it's me.
Wake your old ass up.

1316
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,804
What do you want?

1317
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:05,612
I need you down at the booth
tonight.

1318
01:12:05,651 --> 01:12:07,278
I'm gonna owe you for this one.

1319
01:12:15,994 --> 01:12:17,552
Yo, Aaron?

1320
01:12:17,596 --> 01:12:18,961
Pick up the phone!

1321
01:12:18,997 --> 01:12:20,965
You said call you
if I need you.

1322
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:22,466
I need you
at the Coliseum tonight.

1323
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:24,162
Don't let a brother down.

1324
01:13:39,011 --> 01:13:41,241
Hatchett, drop the gun!

1325
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,975
What the fuck y'all doing?

1326
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:44,482
It's just for protection.

1327
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:46,484
Don't you even scratch
your skinny, stanky ass...

1328
01:13:46,518 --> 01:13:48,213
or you're fucking dead.

1329
01:13:48,253 --> 01:13:49,720
Wait a minute!

1330
01:13:49,755 --> 01:13:51,450
I'm the motherfucker
who called y'all.

1331
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:54,482
The dude you're looking
for is on his way.

1332
01:13:54,526 --> 01:13:55,993
Y'all just calm the fuck down.

1333
01:13:56,028 --> 01:13:57,996
Y'all gonna get medals
for this shit.

1334
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:59,930
I'm helping y'all out.
Y'all trying to kill a nigger.

1335
01:13:59,965 --> 01:14:01,023
Hand over the gun!

1336
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,761
I ain't handing over shit.

1337
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:04,325
Hand over that gun right now.

1338
01:14:04,369 --> 01:14:05,996
How do I know y'all
ain't gonna shoot me?

1339
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:07,835
I'm gonna shoot you
if you don't!

1340
01:14:07,873 --> 01:14:10,034
I'm gonna shoot, then!
We'll be dead motherfuckers!

1341
01:14:10,075 --> 01:14:12,066
- Hand over the gun!
- Shoot, then, shoot!

1342
01:14:14,513 --> 01:14:15,912
Shut the fuck up!

1343
01:14:15,948 --> 01:14:18,075
I ain't putting nothing down.

1344
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:21,510
Nobody's gonna shoot you
if you hand me the gun.

1345
01:14:21,553 --> 01:14:22,952
You gotta trust somebody.

1346
01:14:22,988 --> 01:14:23,955
I don't trust nobody.

1347
01:14:23,989 --> 01:14:25,456
Lower the gun.

1348
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:26,957
You lower your gun.

1349
01:14:26,992 --> 01:14:28,254
Hand it over to me.

1350
01:14:28,293 --> 01:14:30,227
Nobody wants to die.

1351
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:31,627
Come on, nice and easy.

1352
01:14:31,663 --> 01:14:33,460
Just hand me the gun.

1353
01:14:33,498 --> 01:14:35,466
If I give you the gun,
and he shoots me...

1354
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,967
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1355
01:14:37,002 --> 01:14:38,697
He will not shoot you
if you give me the gun.

1356
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:42,533
Control that white boy.

1357
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:46,071
Backup's on the way...

1358
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:48,944
and you're gonna tell me
where the diamonds are.

1359
01:14:50,849 --> 01:14:53,147
What are you talking about,
backup's on the way?

1360
01:14:53,185 --> 01:14:55,119
And whoever said something
about diamonds?

1361
01:14:55,153 --> 01:14:56,745
Lieutenant, what the hell's
going on around here?

1362
01:15:06,198 --> 01:15:07,756
You son of a bitch.

1363
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:10,063
You just killed my partner.

1364
01:15:10,102 --> 01:15:12,195
You just killed
your goddamn partner!

1365
01:15:12,237 --> 01:15:14,000
This is your gun.

1366
01:15:15,107 --> 01:15:16,665
Where are the diamonds?

1367
01:15:20,445 --> 01:15:23,039
You have my diamonds.

1368
01:15:50,609 --> 01:15:51,940
You three go that way.

1369
01:15:51,977 --> 01:15:53,410
You two go with Guido.

1370
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:55,436
Find Franklin
and hold him for me.

1371
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,293
Hey, Roland, wake up, man!

1372
01:16:09,327 --> 01:16:11,227
I know you're watching me!

1373
01:16:11,263 --> 01:16:12,560
These motherfuckers
are trying to kill me!

1374
01:16:12,597 --> 01:16:13,928
Wake the fuck up!

1375
01:16:13,965 --> 01:16:16,297
I need you right now!
Put me on the screen!

1376
01:16:20,305 --> 01:16:21,932
Bonjour, motherfucker.

1377
01:16:21,973 --> 01:16:24,066
Listen up. This is the deal.

1378
01:16:24,109 --> 01:16:26,168
Let my boy go, and
I'm gonna give you your shit.

1379
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:27,735
So you can stop
fucking with me...

1380
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:30,270
and take your old ass
back to France.

1381
01:16:32,584 --> 01:16:34,916
He does make a strong point.

1382
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:53,259
Come on.

1383
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:03,778
Get up.

1384
01:17:03,815 --> 01:17:07,148
I got $15 million in diamonds.

1385
01:17:07,185 --> 01:17:09,619
Sounds to me like you
promised them to someone else.

1386
01:17:09,654 --> 01:17:11,588
I don't know
who the hell that is.

1387
01:17:11,623 --> 01:17:14,490
I know who it is,
but I didn't say...

1388
01:17:14,526 --> 01:17:17,324
we was the only people
that wanted the diamonds...

1389
01:17:17,362 --> 01:17:18,886
but I'm the only one
who know where they at.

1390
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:20,693
I got a feeling
I put a bullet in your nuts...

1391
01:17:20,732 --> 01:17:22,563
you're gonna tell me
where they're at.

1392
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:24,193
Stop playing.

1393
01:17:24,236 --> 01:17:25,794
You can't shoot
a nigger in his nuts.

1394
01:17:25,837 --> 01:17:26,861
I need my nuts.

1395
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:48,857
If you kill me,
you won't find them diamonds.

1396
01:17:48,894 --> 01:17:51,294
You need me. Trust me.

1397
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:52,591
Believe in me.

1398
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:53,598
What about them?

1399
01:17:53,632 --> 01:17:55,600
Forget them.

1400
01:17:55,634 --> 01:17:57,465
I figure for 10 million,
your boys will do their thing.

1401
01:17:57,502 --> 01:18:00,266
Ten million?
I thought it was 15 million.

1402
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,739
What you think I'm doing
all this running around for?

1403
01:18:02,774 --> 01:18:03,968
I want some diamonds, too.

1404
01:18:04,009 --> 01:18:05,237
I ain't doing this shit
for free.

1405
01:18:05,277 --> 01:18:06,710
Look at your stingy ass.

1406
01:18:33,271 --> 01:18:36,832
The second we get those stones,
stick him.

1407
01:18:39,477 --> 01:18:40,466
Watch out!

1408
01:18:48,086 --> 01:18:49,576
One more step!

1409
01:18:52,123 --> 01:18:54,057
I was just going
to get diamonds.

1410
01:18:54,092 --> 01:18:55,389
Then get 'em for me now.

1411
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:17,380
Fuse time, 20 seconds.

1412
01:19:17,415 --> 01:19:19,849
Or was it 10?

1413
01:19:41,606 --> 01:19:43,540
I'm ready for another close-up,
Mr. DeMille.

1414
01:19:47,078 --> 01:19:48,477
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1415
01:19:48,513 --> 01:19:50,037
What you shootin' for?

1416
01:19:50,081 --> 01:19:52,709
I'm the only motherfucker that
know where the diamonds is...

1417
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:54,412
so if you kill me,
you won't find 'em.

1418
01:19:54,452 --> 01:19:56,443
So tell your boys
to stop shooting...

1419
01:19:56,488 --> 01:19:57,853
or you ain't getting shit.

1420
01:21:25,377 --> 01:21:27,368
I want to report a shootout at...

1421
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:30,413
I'll hold.

1422
01:21:46,798 --> 01:21:48,231
You're messing up everything.

1423
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:49,961
Shut up and keep moving.

1424
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,765
Who the fuck you shooting at?

1425
01:22:03,982 --> 01:22:06,075
I want those diamonds!

1426
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:17,020
Come on!

1427
01:23:37,142 --> 01:23:41,010
First, I'm gonna shoot
your right knee.

1428
01:23:41,045 --> 01:23:44,310
Then I'm gonna shoot
the other one.

1429
01:23:44,349 --> 01:23:46,817
You got that, homey?

1430
01:23:48,753 --> 01:23:51,745
Until you tell me
where my diamonds are.

1431
01:23:56,327 --> 01:23:57,885
That really must have hurt.

1432
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:03,664
Kick his ass!

1433
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,598
We gotta go.

1434
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:15,510
Don't you ever say
I'm your goddamn homey!

1435
01:24:33,731 --> 01:24:34,789
OK, what?

1436
01:24:34,832 --> 01:24:36,993
OK, we done fucked up!

1437
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:39,970
Listen.
I'm sorry I got you busted.

1438
01:24:40,004 --> 01:24:41,631
I want you to know,
for what it's worth...

1439
01:24:41,673 --> 01:24:44,540
I never doubted you.
Never once.

1440
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:47,067
That ain't worth shit now
'cause we fixin' to die!

1441
01:24:47,946 --> 01:24:49,470
But thanks anyway.

1442
01:24:49,514 --> 01:24:50,913
You're welcome.

1443
01:24:53,451 --> 01:24:55,009
Hold this.

1444
01:25:23,147 --> 01:25:25,012
That was beautiful.

1445
01:25:26,718 --> 01:25:28,083
Follow me.

1446
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:29,177
Let's go.

1447
01:25:40,398 --> 01:25:41,592
We almost there.

1448
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:09,359
I get the feeling you stole from
the wrong bunch of bad guys.

1449
01:26:11,262 --> 01:26:15,460
You're right.
This shit ain't worth dying for.

1450
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,797
I'm gonna give 'em
what they want.

1451
01:26:18,603 --> 01:26:19,865
Fuck this.

1452
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,284
Sweet Jesus.

1453
01:26:39,657 --> 01:26:41,852
We surrender!

1454
01:26:42,927 --> 01:26:45,919
Stop, everybody!

1455
01:26:51,836 --> 01:26:53,064
We surrender!

1456
01:26:54,605 --> 01:26:55,970
We were just bullshitting.

1457
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:00,033
I got your shit.

1458
01:27:01,145 --> 01:27:02,407
Is this what you want?

1459
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:14,951
Come and get it!

1460
01:27:56,567 --> 01:27:58,091
Don't worry.

1461
01:27:59,437 --> 01:28:01,166
He won't get far.

1462
01:28:29,901 --> 01:28:31,664
And that's when
the L.A. Coliseum...

1463
01:28:31,702 --> 01:28:34,170
turned into a virtual war zone.

1464
01:28:34,205 --> 01:28:36,469
Among the dead,
Raymond Villard...

1465
01:28:36,507 --> 01:28:39,305
leader of a highly sophisticated
international smuggling ring...

1466
01:28:39,343 --> 01:28:42,437
and the man responsible
for Friday's prison break.

1467
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,347
Also dead, LAPD detective
Bobby Pickett.

1468
01:28:45,383 --> 01:28:49,410
A dirty cop
who was Villard's inside man.

1469
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:51,615
I have with me now
Franklin Hatchett...

1470
01:28:51,656 --> 01:28:53,487
the man once believed
to be responsible...

1471
01:28:53,524 --> 01:28:57,255
for the events and the chaos
that led to last night's mayhem.

1472
01:28:57,295 --> 01:28:58,819
Anything you'd like to add?

1473
01:28:58,863 --> 01:29:01,354
First of all,
I told y'all I was innocent.

1474
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:02,832
For those y'all
that thought I was guilty...

1475
01:29:02,867 --> 01:29:04,095
y'all know what y'all can do.

1476
01:29:04,135 --> 01:29:05,295
Mama, I love you. I'm OK.

1477
01:29:05,336 --> 01:29:06,428
Paula, I love you, too.

1478
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:07,665
I'm gonna be home later on.
We gonna party.

1479
01:29:07,705 --> 01:29:08,694
Cook some chicken
and some cornbread...

1480
01:29:08,739 --> 01:29:09,933
and some kool-aid...

1481
01:29:09,974 --> 01:29:12,067
and I'm gonna be back
at the car wash Monday morning.

1482
01:29:12,109 --> 01:29:14,600
Everything on sale,
half price. Peace out!

1483
01:29:14,645 --> 01:29:17,307
Thank you.

1484
01:29:17,348 --> 01:29:18,872
I'm James Russell.

1485
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:21,316
This has been
a Channel 12 News exclusive.

1486
01:29:24,755 --> 01:29:27,087
If anyone can show just cause...

1487
01:29:27,124 --> 01:29:30,025
why this couple
should not be wed...

1488
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:32,359
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1489
01:29:35,032 --> 01:29:36,499
The ring, please?

1490
01:29:44,942 --> 01:29:46,170
That's not the ring.

1491
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:48,041
No shit.

1492
01:29:50,014 --> 01:29:51,743
Relax.

1493
01:29:51,782 --> 01:29:53,613
It's a wedding gift. Take it.

1494
01:29:53,651 --> 01:29:55,016
This is a sacred event.

1495
01:29:55,052 --> 01:29:57,077
I know it's sacred.
This is sacred, too.

1496
01:30:00,124 --> 01:30:01,751
Just take it. It's legal.

1497
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:03,316
Don't nobody know about it.

1498
01:30:05,763 --> 01:30:07,390
How many did you keep?

1499
01:30:07,431 --> 01:30:08,398
Enough.

1500
01:30:08,432 --> 01:30:10,525
Now get married.

1501
01:30:10,568 --> 01:30:11,762
Take it.

1502
01:30:15,673 --> 01:30:17,402
Lord, forgive me.

1503
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:18,999
He will.

1504
01:30:28,786 --> 01:30:30,617
You may now kiss the bride.

1505
