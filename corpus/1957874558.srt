Okay, let's talk
about the future.

17
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,748
Great, let's tomorrow start
with the Champs Elysee,

18
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,376
then hit up the Louvre,

19
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,546
lunch at La Cafe Marly,

20
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,675
a walk down the Seine,
perhaps a pre-dinner crepe?

21
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,093
Croissant?

22
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,512
Oh, no, my trainer
has me on a paleo diet.

23
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,972
You know that's
for cavemen, right?

24
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,015
Have you seen cavemen?

25
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,933
They're very fit.

26
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,228
They also bonk women on the
head and drag them into caves.

27
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,190
Unlike you, who goes to Paris
for a nine-month anniversary.

28
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,735
Oh, come on, wasn't a big deal.

29
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,696
Please, I have cream cheese in my
fridge older than our relationship

30
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,449
and it never took me to Paris.

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,284
Well, I had to go
to Switzerland anyway.

32
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,869
Chad, stop trying to spoil it.

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,747
It's romantic, you took
me to Paris, the end.

34
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,749
Oh, maybe the beginning.

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,085
You know, this Swiss deal
is huge for me,

36
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,506
like next-tax-bracket huge.

37
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,178
And I was thinking maybe we could
enter that tax bracket together.

38
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,265
It makes so much sense
for us to get married.

39
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,059
What do you say?

40
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,311
This is all moving so fast,
you haven't even met my family.

41
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,563
Well, but I'm flying
home for Chanukah,

42
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,774
I'm gonna see them
in a few days.

43
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,900
Hanukkah.

44
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,152
That's what I said.

45
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,823
I'm proposing to you,
not your family.

46
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,036
You've never dated a
Jewish girl before, huh?

47
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,040
But they're gonna love me,
just like you do, huh?

48
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,250
What do you say?

49
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,628
Do we close the deal?

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,215
Yes.

51
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,844
I do close the deal, I do!

52
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,355
Let's go over the
basics one more time,

53
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,565
how many nights
of Hanukkah are there?

54
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,944
Nice try, that's a tricky one,
changes every year.

55
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,030
What, no, the dates change every
year based on the Jewish calendar.

56
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,199
No, you said December 8th.

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,494
I said there were
eight nights of Hanukkah.

58
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,578
Let's move on, my family runs a?

59
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,206
A bakery,
but not just any bakery,

60
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,961
"Becker Family Bread: A pillar of
the community for three generations."

61
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,423
My dad's name is?

62
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,133
- Frank.
- Mom?

63
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,634
- Linda.
- Brother?

64
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,469
- Oh...
- Think fast,

65
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,804
'cause he's picking this up
in like two minutes.

66
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,682
Oh, I got this one.

67
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,767
Sagar.

68
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,812
- Sagar?
- Yeah, he's picking us up, Uber Black.

69
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,647
What?

70
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,768
Yeah, I figured we could
use a nice ride to the hotel.

71
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,528
Hotel, what hotel?
We're staying with my parents.

72
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,030
Think of the hotel
like a life raft,

73
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,033
we don't have to stay there,
but we have it if we need it.

74
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,286
- A life raft on the Titanic.
- Eh?

75
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,954
You've never met my parents.

76
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,415
Staying at a hotel
would be beyond scandalous.

77
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,250
I'd have to wear
a scarlet H on my shirt

78
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,793
- for the rest of my life.
- Hey, calm down, baby.

79
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,503
I just need a place to work.

80
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,006
This Swiss deal has
to be closed by New Year's.

81
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,593
I'm gonna be with your family
for dinner and Chanukah stuff,

82
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,596
but sometimes I need to work
and I need stable Wi-Fi.

83
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,306
My parents have Wi-Fi.

84
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,810
Like stable, like
video-conference stable, huh?

85
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,062
Sagar?

86
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,023
Hey.

87
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,110
Yeah, babe, that's Sagar, I'm gonna
go to the hotel, get some work done.

88
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,237
You have fun
with your big brother,

89
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,948
put some FaceTime in and we'll reconnect
with your parents later tonight.

90
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,700
- You promise?
- Yeah, cross my heart.

91
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,828
Oh, don't tell them
about the engagement, please.

92
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,663
I wanna do that together, deal?

93
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,541
Deal, you wanna shake on it?

94
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,335
You might want to
take that ring off.

95
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,837
Yeah, off.

96
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,638
So Esther Schwartz,
do you remember her?

97
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,056
- Yeah.
- Right.

98
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,557
She tells me the bagels
tastes different.

99
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,267
I said,
"They do not taste different."

100
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,102
She said, "Jacob,
the bagels tastes different."

101
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,480
I said, "Esther, we haven't
changed this recipe in 80 years."

102
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,858
But, no, if you think they taste
different, the bagels taste different."

103
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,570
Oh, my God, I thought that arguing
with customers was dad's job.

104
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,989
Mostly he just
kinda putzes around,

105
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,033
keep it... and smiling a lot.

106
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,371
Mom's still handling the books,
but I have been running the bakery.

107
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,291
That's amazing, you're like
taking over the family business.

108
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,961
I missed you.

109
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,797
I really did, how long has it been?
It's been like almost two years.

110
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,549
I know, I missed you too.

111
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,343
It turns out that giving up
your corporate job

112
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,053
to start an
independent food blog

113
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,888
doesn't leave much money
for vacations.

114
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,473
Oh, you know who came home?

115
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,724
- This is fun.
- Who?

116
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,934
Ben.

117
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,353
- Ben's here?
- Ben's here.

118
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,689
What, I'm just surprised.

119
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,316
It's like, I just thought
he traveled around the world,

120
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,068
taking amazing photos.

121
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,404
It's like he's in a
different country every week.

122
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,739
Shut up.

123
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,536
I can't believe
the Baum sisters grew up

124
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,331
in Sol Viejo just a
few grades above us.

125
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,209
Look at them now,
they're like the Julia Child,

126
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,880
they're like the Julia Children
of our generation.

127
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,759
Yeah, and I'm a food blogger who can't
even get verified on social media.

128
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,344
How'd they do it?

129
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,554
Know what dad always says.

130
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,514
- Oh, he's not still saying it.
- Oh, yeah, he is.

131
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,474
"Rachel and Becky Baum"

132
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,061
used to come into our bakery
every day after school

133
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,355
for two pieces of rugelach.

134
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,567
Nothing made them happier
than my rugelach,

135
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,861
"it's probably
why they became chefs."

136
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,529
It's so embarrassing.

137
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,448
It's humiliating,
but imagine if it was true.

138
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,617
I'm pretty sure that...

139
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,245
Where's your boyfriend?

140
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,501
Okay, I'm gonna pull around
back, I'll meet you inside.

141
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,337
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

142
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,339
I really wanna see
mom and dad's face

143
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,343
when you tell them that Chad's
staying at a hotel. So, wait for me.

144
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,013
I need this.

145
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,119
Sarah!

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,457
- Oh, we missed you, kiddo!
- I missed you too.

147
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,668
- Mum.
- You must be starving.

148
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,461
I'm fine.

149
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,921
- Are you kidding, I can practically see through...
- Mom.

150
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,255
What's the last time you had a.

151
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,924
Oh, come on, give her a break.

152
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,384
Hey, okay, I'm gonna go out
and meet Chad

153
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,802
and I'm gonna help
him with the bags.

154
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,762
Oh, Chad's not
here at the moment.

155
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,262
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

156
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,807
Oh, no, no, nothing,
he's in Sol Viejo,

157
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,725
he's just not like
right here in this room.

158
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,686
Well, exactly, because
he's getting the luggage.

159
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,562
See, there's nothing
to worry about, honey.

160
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,148
No, Dad, Chad has a lot of work
to do over Hanukkah,

161
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,359
like a lot of video
finance conference calls.

162
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,610
So, he rented
an office for the week.

163
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,278
Oh, like a work week.

164
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,865
Exactly, except it has
a bed in a concierge.

165
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,075
Chad's staying at a hotel.

166
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,284
Thanks, Jake.

167
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,120
I beg you to wait for me.

168
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,539
I don't understand, did we
do something to offend him?

169
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,958
- You haven't even met him.
- And that offended him?

170
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,335
No, he's just
getting some work done

171
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,547
and then he's gonna come here
and eat and then stay.

172
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,466
Oh, good, because your mother
prepared her famous briskets.

173
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,344
Okay, if he can't make it, I'll
just put his brisket in the freezer.

174
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,513
- Don't do that.
- I don't want it to get cold.

175
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,265
Let's get you settled sweetie.

176
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,225
Come on, my daughter
is home for Hanukah,

177
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,229
best gift in the world.

178
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,541
Smile.

179
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,504
Ben.

180
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,091
Hi.

181
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,260
What are you doing down there?

182
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,429
Honestly, trying to decide

183
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,599
if I should tell my Juliet joke
or my Rapunzel joke?

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,517
Let's hear them both
and I'll decide.

185
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,021
Okay, they are both terrible,
just know that I know that.

186
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,731
Noted.

187
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,442
Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair,

188
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,278
unless you are an Orthodox Jew,
in which case it's a wig

189
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,698
and I will definitely break my
neck should I try to climb it.

190
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,660
Not a wig, also not
long enough to climb,

191
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,290
but if you don't mind
waiting there, say 20 years.

192
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,459
Fine by me.

193
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,212
What's the next one, Romeo?

194
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,633
- Oh, one sec.
- Where...

195
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:56,053
- Hello?
- -I think your phone's broken, I'll get you new one.

196
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,429
No, my phone's fine.

197
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,264
But I texted you
two minutes ago.

198
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,975
I'm here.
Bakery looks closed though,

199
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,811
I can make somewhere else.

200
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,230
No, no, no, stay right there,
I'll be down in one sec.

201
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,525
- I gotta go.
- Oh, hey...

202
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,776
Come over for the first night
of Hanukkah tomorrow,

203
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,277
I want you to meet someone.

204
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,404
Okay.

205
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,073
There he is.

206
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,451
- Hey, Frankie.
- Whoa.

207
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,619
Okay.

208
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,955
We've heard so much about you.

209
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,500
Oh, you didn't tell me
you had a sister.

210
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,044
Don't tell me you're Linda.

211
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,046
Mrs. Becker?

212
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,840
No, no, Mrs. Becker is your mother,
'cause you're Sarah's sister.

213
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,634
Hi, he's funny.

214
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,886
Yeah, Linda, Linda.

215
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,555
Okay, what do you
do with your wife?

216
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,516
This is my wife Linda, Chad.

217
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,436
I see rubbing
the cradle back then.

218
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,021
- Hey, Chad, I'm Jacob.
- Hey.

219
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,066
I already know
I look good for my joke.

220
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,779
No, no, you look like
a Jewish Ben Stiller.

221
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,407
You're right mom,
he's a real card.

222
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,618
Well, my frat voted me ask clown
if that means anything.

223
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,287
- It really does, yeah.
- Who's hungry?

224
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,872
Yes, come on in.

225
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,041
Come on in,
Linda made a beautiful feast.

226
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,050
So, Chad, Sarah tells us
you're in finance.

227
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,053
Yeah, well, real estate,
financing,

228
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,932
Crypto, NFTs, PCP,
follow the money,

229
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,559
you know how it is.

230
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,436
Not really, our family has been
in the same business

231
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,771
for three generations actually.

232
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,399
Well actuaries,
that's another sector I crashed.

233
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,820
Cool, do you know
who is from the SV?

234
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,113
Oh, here we go.

235
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,366
Rachel and Becky Baum.

236
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,534
Oh, the cooks.

237
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,536
The chefs, but yes, yes.

238
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,038
They used to come
into our bakery

239
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,456
every single day after school,

240
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,500
They loved my rugelach,

241
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,544
it's probably
why they became chefs.

242
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,796
My husband,
inspiration to the stars.

243
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,132
Hey, hey, hey, it ain't bragging
if it's true.

244
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,259
All right, we haven't let
you get a word in edgewise,

245
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,595
you must have a million
questions for us.

246
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:06,017
Yeah, there's something I've
been wanting to ask you.

247
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,896
Go ahead, we're an open book.

248
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,443
What's the Wi-Fi password?

249
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,533
Okay.

250
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,954
It means a lot to me
that you're here.

251
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,670
So, when should
we tell my family.

252
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,505
About what?

253
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,382
That we're getting married.

254
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,968
Oh, that.

255
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,512
Well, Chanukah begins tomorrow,

256
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,348
how about after we
light the candles?

257
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,435
Perfect, can't wait
to wear my ring again.

258
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,693
Is this a twin?

259
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,822
It's a queen,
it's at least a full.

260
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,825
Really, can I see the receipt?

261
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,369
Come on, it's romantic.

262
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,496
Yeah.

263
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,776
Babe, couldn't sleep
in the doll bed,

264
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,486
rolling over to the
Double Tree with Sagar,

265
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,699
back by breakfast, XO, Chad.

266
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,248
There's nobody around for miles,

267
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,001
the big guy, huge dude,
grabs my camera,

268
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,003
smashes it on the ground,

269
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,880
hog time, he stick
a gag in my mouth.

270
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,798
- Benjamin!
- Then what happened?

271
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,177
Okay, so then they force me
to the ground, onto my knees,

272
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,598
hold up their rifles
right at my head and bam,

273
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:15,645
I wake up, it was a dream. I fell
asleep on the Trans Siberian railway.

274
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,397
You are a wise guy.

275
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,816
It was a very
intense dream. Mr. B.

276
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,444
My God, Jake,
did you hear Ben's story?

277
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,654
I'm brightening the color, Mom.

278
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:29,159
There she is, hey, sweetie, look
to stop by, Ben from next door.

279
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,286
Not ringing any bells.

280
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,873
Oh, I also go by
Benjamin if that helps.

281
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,501
Sometimes I go
by Ba, ba, ba Benny,

282
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,377
if I'm performing with the Jets.

283
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,798
Oh, weren't you the kid that
got stuck in the hollow mirrors?

284
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,591
No, I don't think so.

285
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:49,054
Yeah, county fair,
summer of seventh grade.

286
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,473
- Maybe.
- Oh, no, you'd remember,

287
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,476
they had to shut it all down and
extract you through the roof.

288
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,938
Oh, so you're saying I got to
ride for free in a helicopter

289
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,275
and get my face on the front page of the
SV Courier because that would be awesome.

290
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,986
Ben was sweet enough
to take some photos

291
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,114
of the bakery
for socialized media.

292
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,283
Speaking of which,
here they are,

293
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,286
hot off the press.

294
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:17,124
The photos are in this?

295
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,875
Yeah, crazy, right?

296
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,293
I'm sure one of your kids
can show how to view them.

297
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,171
I'm sure
they have no idea, Jake...

298
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,715
Still great, Mom.

299
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,718
So, who is it you
wanted me to meet?

300
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,346
Oh, where is Chad?

301
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,182
Don't tell me we scared him off
before the first night of Hanukkah.

302
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,434
Doesn't he want to crush
the Hanukkah sector?

303
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,856
No, nobody scared anybody,
Chad just had a work thing.

304
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,025
He has a lot of business overseas
and with the time difference.

305
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,529
You wanted me to meet a
business man named Chad? Got it.

306
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,781
He's really sweet
once you get to know him.

307
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,326
Greetings beggars,
I come bearing gifts.

308
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,080
Feel free to take anything
you want, I got multiple...

309
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,623
How thoughtful.

310
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,792
- I love panda bread.
- Yeah, who doesn't?

311
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,254
You know we are right above
a bakery right this second.

312
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,089
Yeah, but this one was open.

313
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,967
Yeah.

314
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,303
You weren't on my flashcards.

315
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:15,098
I'm Ben, friend of the family,
happy to make you a flashcard.

316
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,726
Oh, nice to meet you, friend.

317
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,269
Okay, who's ready
to hit the beach?

318
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,439
I brought my long board
and I'm stoked.

319
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,650
We need to tend the bakery, but
you and Sarah should go, enjoy.

320
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,487
I actually have some work to do for the
blog holiday recipes, get the most clicks.

321
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,240
Oh, you you want me to call
Sagar and take you to the office?

322
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,117
We have a fiber optic Wi-Fi.

323
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,660
You know, I think
I'll just stay here and work.

324
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,455
Jake, you should go with Chad.

325
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,832
I would love to, but the
is not gonna bake itself.

326
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,792
Hey, man, show Chad around town.

327
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,544
I can hold down
the fort for one day.

328
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,546
Frank, the doctor said
you should take it easy,

329
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,673
that means less work, not more.

330
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,092
What I think he said was that
you should take it easy on me.

331
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,220
I'm serious,
I think this is a good idea.

332
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,723
You know, I can help.

333
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,934
Are you sure?

334
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,813
Yeah, I wanted to grab some candid,
save Mr. B in action, anyway.

335
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,191
Hey, hey, hey, remember tonight
is the first night of Hanukkah,

336
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,193
I wanna see
all your lovely faces

337
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,234
back here at sunset for the
lightning of the menorah.

338
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,209
Yes.

339
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,461
Hey.

340
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,922
Sarah, bear.

341
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,509
What was the all that
about dad and the doctor?

342
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,182
As hard as it is to believe,

343
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:43,436
your parents are aging and...

344
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,813
Is he sick?

345
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:49,609
No, but he has
to be more careful

346
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,903
about everything these days.

347
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,075
What he eats, what he drinks, how
hard he works, how hard he plays.

348
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,286
Thankfully, we have Jacob

349
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,622
and your brother's just doing
more and more every year, so.

350
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,208
Is that what Jacob wants?

351
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,713
Right? I think he'd tell us
if he was unhappy.

352
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,759
Well, what can I do? I mean, I'm
here to help, I wanna do something.

353
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:19,306
You're doing everything, you're gonna
create the best food blog there ever was

354
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:23,269
and slap it up there on .net.

355
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,886
What are you... Haven't
you ever heard of knocking?

356
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,430
I knocked like five times.

357
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,307
Well, I was working.

358
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,684
Your dad wants me to get some
shots of you for the new ads.

359
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,020
Highlight the family
aspect of the business.

360
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,441
Why are they doing all these ads anyway?
We never used to do marketing.

361
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,820
Have you walked around town
since you've been back?

362
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,739
No.

363
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,326
Grab your shoes,
time for you to see the new SV.

364
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,080
This spot, remember
what that used to be?

365
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,582
- Remember Greg's?
- Greg's!

366
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,667
Closed last month?

367
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,252
I love Greg's.

368
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,672
- And the bookstore.
- I know.

369
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,509
- Remember that? It's gone.
- So unfortunate.

370
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,011
Horrible.

371
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,638
What happened?

372
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,100
Corporate America finally
found us, that plus internet.

373
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,063
Let's scope out the competition.

374
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,398
Free sample.

375
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,608
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

376
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,905
Is this old?

377
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,075
I've had better bread
on airplanes.

378
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,120
I don't get it,
why is this place so busy?

379
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,788
Same reason all chains are busy.

380
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,750
Spent a ton on marketing and they
cut corners to keep prices low.

381
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,461
There's gotta be
something we can do.

382
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,171
Why do you think I'm here?

383
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,507
Spent the last decade
traveling around the world

384
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,677
and anytime I wasn't on
assignment, I came home to the SV.

385
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,305
Each time, another local
business was closed,

386
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,932
came back this last summer

387
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,561
and there's only a handful
of the businesses left

388
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,938
from when we were kids.

389
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,776
So, I decided to stay,
see if I could help save them.

390
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,987
The bakery.

391
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,822
It's doing better than most.

392
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,408
Thanks to a bunch of old Jews
who would rather starve

393
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,649
than eat a black and white
cookie your family didn't bake.

394
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,622
But they're getting old.

395
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,040
My parents?

396
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,544
Their customers,
and the younger generations,

397
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,672
they leave for college
and never look back.

398
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,049
I'm part of the problem.

399
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,136
What, no. That's not...

400
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,974
You have a great life
in Chicago with Chad.

401
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,645
Oh, we gotta get home,
it's almost sundown.

402
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,648
Oh, time to rock the dreidel

403
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,720
I wish Zayde Max was here.

404
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,223
He is here.

405
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,975
Who's ready
to get their dreidel.

406
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,355
I am, I am.

407
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,193
I'm sorry,
are we playing for dimes?

408
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,071
It's just a way to keep score.

409
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,782
Care to make it
more interesting?

410
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,492
You don't even
know how to play yet.

411
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,327
I assume you're gonna show me.

412
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,581
It's pretty simple, really?
You just spin the dreidel.

413
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,250
So the name of the game
is spin the dreidel.

414
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,376
Literally.

415
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,752
It's got four sides,

416
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,714
shin, hei, gimel, nun.

417
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,341
And depending
which way it lands,

418
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,134
you either get dimes
or you lose them.

419
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,762
There's one more rule, fellas,
it's a house rule.

420
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,933
You land on nun,
you gotta drink some.

421
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,283
No one wants locusts, right?

422
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,900
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,

423
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,243
Here we go, here we go,
here we go.

424
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,328
Come on, come on.

425
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,748
Yeah, whoa!

426
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:22,710
I am the man, one, two.

427
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,297
Okay, everybody,

428
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:32,136
this man is a dreidel hustler.

429
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,098
Guilty, guilty.

430
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,476
The gloves are coming off,
Frank, yeah.

431
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,520
Oh, bring it, bring it.

432
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,439
- Oh, no, no.
- Come on, bring it. Bring it.

433
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,943
- Let's go, come on, bring it.
- Oh God.

434
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,028
- Dad.
- Frank.

435
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,532
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

436
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,328
- Vini.

It's just that it's been hours,
and so I'm a little worried.

445
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,407
Could you look one more time?
It's Frank Becker.

446
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:38,370
I don't mean to be a pain, but
we haven't heard anything, still.

447
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,164
Why are you still here?

448
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,875
Out of concern,
why are you still here?

449
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,755
Well, I just put my soon to be
father-in-law in the hospital.

450
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,673
Father...

451
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,343
Oh, wow.

452
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,471
Congratulations.

453
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,307
Yeah, that's not a good thing.

454
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,685
It's just that it's been hours
and we haven't heard...

455
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,979
These are my children,
this is Sarah and Jacob,

456
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,981
could you just look up
Frank Becker?

457
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,149
Frank Becker.

458
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,068
Mrs. Becker, I'm Dr. Bruce.

459
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:15,032
Oh, Doctor, how is my Frankie,
is he gonna pull through?

460
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,285
Frank is fine, but I do have
a few concerns,

461
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,121
number one being his drinking.

462
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,540
His what?

463
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,711
Well, we ran some tests and his blood
alcohol levels were quite elevated.

464
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:33,091
No, he drinks on holidays
in Bar Mitzvahs, we're Jewish.

465
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:37,220
I see, well, my other concern is
his blood pressure. It's a bit high.

466
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,014
Again, we're Jewish.

467
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,478
All the same, we'd really like to keep him
here a few nights and run some more tests.

468
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,438
Well, can we see him?

469
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,191
Of course, he's in recovery,
might be a bit tired,

470
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,027
but should be fine, right?
Come on back.

471
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,196
Oh, God.

472
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,541
What a way to spend
the Festival of Lights.

473
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,419
And more like, more like...

474
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,547
Hundred bucks says it
goes with lights out.

475
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,843
- Festival of lights out.
- There it is.

476
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,887
You're gonna be fine.

477
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,641
Here at Big Wayne's used cars,
we've got them new, we've got...

478
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,601
Oh, just seeing
if I can get the game on.

479
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,479
- What game?
- Any game.

480
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,233
Its Hanukkah week
in our kitchen,

481
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,111
Vodka, Google, jelly donuts
with weird names.

482
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,655
Let's show you how to make
this Hanukkah the Baum,

483
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:42,035
and join us next week
for Christmas cookies.

484
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,247
Those ladies are from Sol Viejo.

485
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,331
Really?

486
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,500
Rachel and Becky Baum.

487
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,169
They used to come into my bakery

488
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,675
every single day after school,
love the rugelach.

489
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,054
I gotta get back.

490
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,806
- Wait, what are you doing?
- No, it's Hanukah, it's the busiest time of the year.

491
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,310
No, I gotta...
I can't sit here eating Jell-O.

492
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,186
Dad, dad, the doctor
said you have to rest.

493
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,230
Okay, so what? The doctor's
gonna pay our mortgage

494
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,566
or wave the hospital bill.

495
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,776
Frank Becker, you stay
in that bed or I will never,

496
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,946
and I mean never
rub your feet again.

497
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,990
You're bluffing.

498
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,617
Try me.

499
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,202
Dad, I can help out
at the bakery while you recover.

500
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,665
And I know every big order we
have, I'll make sure we get paid.

501
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:30,959
Jacob.

502
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,170
What, I already worked there.

503
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,799
Yeah, but covering for me.

504
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,724
Well, do you remember when Zayde
got sick and you stepped up?

505
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,519
Well, now it's my turn.

506
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,148
Plus, I can easily it's not...

507
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,817
You are such a munch.

508
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,153
I can help too.

509
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,113
How?

510
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,076
Well, you said something
about a mortgage,

511
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,703
if you're struggling
with the payments,

512
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,749
I can talk to the bank
and lower the interest rate.

513
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,962
For that, I'll need the assets,
balance sheets,

514
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,423
inventory, that kind of stuff.

515
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,008
You'd really do that?

516
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,137
Yeah, your bread and butter
is well, bread and butter,

517
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,598
but this is my bread and butter.

518
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,142
Chad.

519
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:36,149
Oh, if you'll excuse us,
Sagar is here, let's go, babe.

520
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,370
So, what do you think?

521
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,959
Look real leather.

522
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,836
Touch it, feel it.

523
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,924
Sagar, you're spoiling us, huh?

524
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,969
Wait, where are we going?

525
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,971
Oh, if I'm gonna
help your family,

526
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,681
I need a good night's sleep.

527
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,725
And also I need
to get some work done.

528
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,476
You're staying
at the hotel again?

529
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,895
Bingo.

530
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,066
I can't believe
that actually worked.

531
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,736
What's up?

532
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,489
My dad's doing okay,
in case you're wondering.

533
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,827
I know, I slipped out
after the doctor told you.

534
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,205
You didn't say goodbye.

535
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,709
Yeah, well seem like more
of an immediate family vibe.

536
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,420
You're basically family.

537
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:26,301
No, but hey Chad will be soon,
Mazel tov, by the way.

538
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,721
Can we go somewhere and talk?

539
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,681
It's the middle of the night,
there's nothing open.

540
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,392
I know a place
that might be open.

541
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,734
Haven't been here in years.

542
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,113
You know what this place
makes me think of?

543
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,990
Hard lemonade
and clove cigarettes.

544
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,577
Junior prom, I asked
you to be my date here.

545
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,747
Yeah, and then the next day,

546
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:01,585
Tad Yost asked you to be
his date and you said yes.

547
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,046
I had a huge crush on him.

548
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,298
Come on, it wasn't
like I ditched you.

549
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,803
No, we all went together
and then I went home,

550
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,683
and you came here with Tad Yost.

551
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,146
You still mad about that,
like 20 years later?

552
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,481
Mad, no.

553
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,942
No, I actually learned something
really valuable from that,

554
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,154
that I never want to
be anybody's backup.

555
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,740
I know you'll
find someone great.

556
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,909
Yeah.

557
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,664
Are we okay?

558
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,875
Yeah, we're good.

559
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,794
We should probably get back,

560
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,630
your fiance is gonna wonder
where you are.

561
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,842
Come on.

562
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,938
Where's my schmear?

563
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,232
Frank always tosses
in some schmear.

564
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,568
I don't think we sell
cream cheese.

565
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,321
- Here you go.
- Thank you son.

566
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,698
Greet your father,
I hope he feels better.

567
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,819
Say a hello to Harry for me.

568
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,243
We do sell cream cheese.

569
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,913
No, that's Philadelphia,

570
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,041
just keep it around
for Mr. Paper.

571
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,376
Got it, who's next?

572
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,962
Thank you so much, thank you.

573
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,590
Okay, bye.

574
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,179
Okay, Linda, let's kick
the tires on this jello bean.

575
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,266
Kick away, come upstairs,
I'll open the books.

576
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,225
Thank you, honey,

577
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,395
I wish your father
was still with us.

578
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,065
- He's not dead, Mom.
- I know, I just miss him.

579
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,987
- It's gonna be okay.
- I know.

580
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,742
Okay, who's ready
to spin some more, huh?

581
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,037
I don't think we're gonna
do that tonight, Chad.

582
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,957
Nun, you have to drink.

583
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,632
So, how's it going
with the accounting stuff?

584
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,467
I think it's going well, Chad?

585
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,054
I'm gonna stop by the bank later
and talk shop with the suits.

586
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,932
Thanks, babe, I mean so much.

587
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,560
I do have a question,

588
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,688
this bakery has been in the family
for three generations, right?

589
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,024
Why do you still
have a mortgage?

590
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,860
We took out a loan
when Sarah got into college.

591
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:17,490
Oh, college, well,
where do you go to college?

592
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,619
At the Becker
Culinary Institute.

593
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,373
- Where's that?
- It's downstairs.

594
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,293
Our Zayde passed away the summer
Jake graduated high school.

595
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,171
Zayde ran the bakery,
so when my dad took over,

596
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,257
he asked Jake
to stay and help out.

597
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,176
Well, financially speaking,
it's a good thing

598
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,386
you both didn't go
to fancy colleges,

599
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:44,350
once it is Panda, put a bagel
size hole in your finance.

600
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,312
Anything you can do to help,
we appreciate Chad.

601
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,106
No, should we tell them?

602
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,067
Tell us what?

603
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,444
Nothing, not nothing, something,

604
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,323
but not now, when my dad's back.

605
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,409
I'll get it.

606
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,126
Just came to drop
something off for your mom.

607
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,587
- Is that Ben?
- Yeah!

608
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,089
Let him in.

609
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,883
Would you like to come in?

610
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,679
Hi, sweetheart, please join us.

611
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,808
Oh, thanks Mrs. B, I can't stay,
I just wanted to drop off these,

612
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,643
I got some great photos
for the new ads.

613
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,769
I'm glad you're here.

614
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,105
- You are?
- You are?

615
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:35,150
Yeah, you know, Linda and I discussed
it and we agreed to put a freeze

616
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:39,571
to all non-essential expenses,
no more photos.

617
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,990
Oh, well,
I wasn't charging for these.

618
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,744
Yeah, but it cost money
to use them,

619
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:50,124
ads, marketing materials,
printing cost, ah, it adds up.

620
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:54,045
Well, you can still keep
the photos in, use them later.

621
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:59,050
I guess you're not understanding,
look, no more photos.

622
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,095
Okay, the thing
is that I promised Frank.

623
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,055
Yeah, do you see Frank?

624
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,226
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank,

625
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,062
Frank, Frank.

626
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,023
Not here, no Frank, no photos.

627
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,985
Okay, I'm gonna go,
happy Hanukkah everybody.

628
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,945
- Sweetheart...
- Ben, wait.

629
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,489
Let him go,
this between the family,

630
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,658
not the neighbors.

631
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,002
Thank you my good man.

632
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:38,881
Remember Frank,
take it easy, all right?

633
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,049
No strenuous activity,

634
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,969
you need to get lots of rest and
keep your stress levels down.

635
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,054
Mainly you need to relax.

636
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,557
Can I get that in writing
so I can show my wife?

637
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,685
- I'm serious, Frank.
- Thank you, Doc.

638
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,356
And you,

639
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:01,111
ah, Dr. Bruce, my stress
levels are rising.

640
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,906
Is this right?

641
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,949
Thirty thousand dollars,
this is crazy.

642
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,703
That ambulance ride cost more than
our entire honeymoon, go figure.

643
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,705
God, $15 for an aspirin.

644
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:16,627
To be fair, it was two aspirin
and it did the trick.

645
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,420
How are we gonna pay for this?

646
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,506
I think we've gotta ask Chad.

647
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,508
Poor kid, he just met us

648
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,010
and now we're dragging him
to our family mishigas.

649
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,305
He wants to help,
he's at the bank as we speak.

650
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,390
Grab my foot.

651
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,651
These numbers are not great.

652
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,320
Yeah, tell me about it,
what can we do?

653
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,405
Depends on the angle.

654
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:49,160
Bottom line, I don't want my
future in laws to be homeless.

655
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,538
What'd you say the address was?

656
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,833
263 Valencia Street.

657
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,253
I'm in real estate,

658
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,092
one block from main.

659
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,636
Yeah, and great building too,
I checked with the county.

660
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:12,307
It was built 1948,
a post-war classic.

661
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,436
- Good bones I bet.
- Great bones.

662
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,856
So what's the play here?

663
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:23,403
Technically, the bank holds
the building, so you tell me.

664
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,073
Alpha by Delta.

665
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:33,580
Alpha man flourish across the
land, take that rich bounty, woo.

666
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,875
I'm sure we can
work something out.

667
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,295
- Hey, my man.
- Knock it out.

668
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:09,073
Thank, you son,
that was beautiful.

669
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,911
Okay, if I could have
everyone's attention.

670
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,706
Up, oh, up is good, right?

671
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,084
These are your expenses, Frank.

672
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,753
Where do he get the pointer?

673
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,296
I think he travels with it.

674
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,298
Can we keep the chit-chat
to a minimum?

675
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,967
Sorry.

676
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,389
This are your profits.

677
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,226
Wait, sorry, I don't
understand, business is fine.

678
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,897
Yeah, but the cost of doing
business has risen over the years.

679
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:46,568
Meanwhile, your prices
have not changed enough

680
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,155
- to cover that difference.
- Chad, we get by.

681
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,285
Yeah, but the hospital bill
changed all that.

682
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,163
That's you.

683
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:03,044
So, what are you saying? That
we have to raise our prices?

684
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:09,091
Okay, price of a bagel,
no longer 50 cents, 75 cents.

685
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,802
For a plain bagel,
are you insane?

686
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,721
It's too late for that, you
would have to charge $5 a bagel,

687
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,140
it's allowed every day
to even make a dent.

688
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,935
So what are you saying?
We're finished, kaput?

689
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,813
Not yet.

690
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,984
This is the real estate
market in downtown Sol Viejo.

691
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,402
Oh, great.

692
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,488
I'm sorry, I don't understand,

693
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,741
what does this have to do
with saving the bakery?

694
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,329
Not save, sell.

695
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,415
He wants us to sell the bakery.

696
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,251
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

697
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:48,505
sell Becker Family Breads,
and then what?

698
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,757
We move to Boca Raton?

699
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,259
You would make enough
profit in the business,

700
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,261
Boca Raton is totally doable.

701
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,971
Yeah, okay, I've heard enough.

702
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,514
No, stop it,
he's only trying to help.

703
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,683
- How is this helping?
- I don't know.

704
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:03,186
Frank, with the hospital bills
plus the bakeries expenses,

705
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,604
you don't have enough
in the accounts

706
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,106
to pay the next
mortgage payment.

707
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,524
It's due a week.

708
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,110
How short are we?

709
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,784
Okay, so we have
until the end of Hanukkah

710
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,704
to raise $40,000, no problem.

711
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:25,584
You haven't had
a $40,000 month since ever,

712
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,837
we are talking about
a $40,000 week, friend.

713
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,465
So what, youknow the Maccabees,

714
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,303
they had enough oil
for one night, it lasted eight.

715
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,347
I have no idea what that means.

716
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,642
I know what it means Chad,
it doesn't make any sense.

717
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,686
There has to be another way.

718
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,522
If you don't make
these payment to the bank,

719
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,526
they seize the property
and sell it themselves.

720
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,652
You know, okay,
then let's get baking.

721
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,280
Okay, Jacob, Jacob,
go fire up the oven.

722
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,032
Honey, I want you to
go into my office,

723
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,825
find a file marked
corporate clients.

724
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,244
I want you to call every
single one of them tomorrow

725
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,832
and tell them that we are gonna have
a special on catering holiday parties.

726
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,502
Dad, what can I do?

727
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,214
Just being here is enough.

728
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,569
If you didn't wanna be my backup
plan, how come you never ask me out?

729
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:20,824
Well, there are a few reasons,

730
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:21,950
which one do you want to hear?

731
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,369
Start with number one.

732
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,581
Okay, well you
were my first kiss,

733
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,960
summer after seventh grade,
Camp Shalom.

734
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,045
Same.

735
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,048
When we got back from camp,

736
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,510
things were weird
between us for like a month.

737
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:44,348
We were 13, kissing
is weird when you're 13.

738
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,392
Okay, fair,

739
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,437
but it wasn't
the last time we kissed.

740
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,063
There were three more.

741
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,482
Very good, Halloween,
ninth grade.

742
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,609
I was Hermione.

743
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,986
I was Bob Dylan.

744
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,572
You grabbed me and kissed me, but
you wouldn't take off your sunglasses

745
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,407
'cause you were so cool.

746
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,910
No, I was so nervous.

747
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,454
I remember thinking
that if you rejected me,

748
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,289
I was gonna reject
you back and say,

749
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,042
how does it feel?

750
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,675
Third time I kissed you,

751
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,763
in the cemetery.

752
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,224
You were confused.

753
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,020
And I was sad.

754
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:36,984
Your bubbe was,
she was the greatest.

755
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,906
She was my best friend.

756
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,992
I know

757
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:52,458
And then when she was gone,
you were my best friend.

758
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,670
That's what you needed,

759
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,256
I didn't wanna let you down.

760
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:04,762
Boyfriends come and go,
but you needed a best friend.

761
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,939
You still did kiss me
one more time.

762
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,067
Oh, yeah, well that time
I had no choice.

763
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,402
Why?

764
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:21,946
Well, you were oing to college.

765
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,281
So?

766
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:28,411
So, wondered if I never
saw you again?

767
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:34,500
I wasn't gonna miss my last
chance to kiss Sarah Becker.

00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,540
So, honey, where are we at?

779
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,669
So, the temple placed
a big Shabbat order, $800.

780
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,881
Oh, and you know Barbara,

781
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,342
she's been doing my hair
since the last millennium.

782
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,801
- Oh, yeah.
- So she's retiring...

783
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,303
Honey, I'm sorry
about your hair,

784
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:29,721
but you need to
focus here, okay?

785
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:30,890
Eye on the prize.

786
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,893
And the salon is throwing her
a retirement party,

787
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,145
and they gave us
the order, $300.

788
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:40,732
Ah, oh, that's great,
anything else?

789
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:44,235
- Not yet.
- Okay, well hey, that's $1,000 down,

790
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,656
$39,000 to go,
who's next, Jacob?

791
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,325
What's up?

792
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,494
What do you got for us?

793
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,954
What was I supposed to do?

794
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,958
Come up with an idea
to help us save the bakery.

795
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,880
Oh, okay, how about this?

796
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,007
Instead of going to college,

797
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,009
I'll just spend
my life working here

798
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,054
six days a week for no pay,

799
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:15,184
just room and board,
and that's my final offer.

800
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,479
Deal.

801
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,815
Okay, just make sure
she's firing

802
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,984
on all cylinders
this week, all right?

803
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,779
Okay, so, Chad,
how did it go to the bank?

804
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,864
Any luck getting us
the extension?

805
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,242
Heading over there
as soon as we wrap up here,

806
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,785
taking the suits out to lunch.

807
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,372
Great, schmooze
them until they cave.

808
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,290
That sounds illegal, Frank.

809
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,959
It just means turn on the charm.

810
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,711
Oh, no problem.

811
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:47,799
Excellent, okay, that leaves
Ben and Sarah.

812
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,386
I spoke to the SV Courier this
morning, told them what's going on,

813
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,887
they offered to run
a free ad for the bakery

814
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,056
all the rest of Hanukkah,
half page.

815
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,059
- It's wonderful.
- I'm gonna turn the blog into a giant ad

816
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,561
for the bakery all week.

817
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,313
The theme is family,
friends and food,

818
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,982
Becker Family Breads
through the years.

819
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,483
- Oh...
- I love that.

820
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,110
And, Mom,
do you have any pictures

821
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,279
of Bubbe and Zayde
when they ran the bakery?

822
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,115
Do we know each other?

823
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:15,410
Well, I'm gonna need those, and then
pictures of me and Jake when we were kids.

824
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,413
I don't have any.

825
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,040
And if anyone has
an idea for a hashtag,

826
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,334
we wanna get something
trending on social media.

827
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,503
Hash, hash, hash what?

828
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:30,425
- You know, the number sign, Frank?
-$40,000, that's the number,

829
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,888
Hashtag $40,000
by Shabbat, how's that?

830
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,515
You know, Ben and I
can figure it out.

831
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,392
Yeah, we got it.

832
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,521
All right, great, so come on,
people, let's get to work.

833
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,839
Right, okay, okay.

834
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,967
Thank, you everyone.

835
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,593
And we have three more
orders for tomorrow.

836
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,637
Ugh, that's my girl.

837
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,931
Chad, any progress
with the bank?

838
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,684
I think we are
getting somewhere,

839
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,227
- should know more soon.
- Okay.

840
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:07,188
Sarah, whatever happened
with that tick tack toe.

841
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,399
Oh, the hashtag raise dough?

842
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,944
- We got it trending?
- Is that good?

843
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,906
Unfortunately, it hasn't
translated into any business.

844
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,576
Was it supposed to?

845
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,161
Yeah, Dad,
that's the whole point.

846
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,957
But wait a minute,
that is not social networking

847
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,500
for Jews of a certain age.

848
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,754
I mean, they don't get
the news from Face Jam.

849
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,757
- Face Jam?
- Well, we put an ad in the courier

850
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,175
if that's what you meant.

851
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,885
No, wait, wait,
hold on, hold on.

852
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,345
Linda, honey, when you
go to get your hair done,

853
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,055
what do the ladies talk about?

854
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,016
It's two subjects,
they talk about their children

855
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,225
and their grand children.

856
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,062
Uh-huh. Huh, huh?

857
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,024
Jewish geography.

858
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:55,445
Boom, you want all the people
who have been here over the years

859
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,531
to come back and help, support
Becker Family Breads, okay?

860
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:02,535
So you use the oldest slash
youngest social network

861
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,873
in the world,
Jewish Grandchildren.

862
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:12,879
Okay, so do we just start
calling kids from school?

863
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,631
Do you even remember
who was Jewish?

864
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,592
No, we could go by last names.

865
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,469
Yeah, but that could get tricky,

866
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,763
I've been to like two
Kirk Patrick Bar Mitzvahs.

867
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,806
- Good point.
- Yeah.

868
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,727
Oh, I got it.

869
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,564
Camp Shalom.

870
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,026
Duh, everyone at
summer camp was Jewish.

871
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,695
Even the people who weren't.

872
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:42,533
Guess it's finally time to reconnect
with me Old Color War tribe.

873
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,535
Okay, I'll start with Abrams,

874
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,829
you start with Zimmerman
and we'll meet in the middle.

875
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,165
Okay, except let me
trade you Stacy Rothman

876
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,542
for Evan Cohen, 'cause I
don't think either of us

877
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,503
-wants to make those calls.
- No, I don't, I really don't wanna talk to him.

878
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,478
I remember the first day
you came to work with me.

879
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:13,106
Yeah, I was 16 years old,
I wanted a car.

880
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,567
Can you hand me
the bench scraper, please.

881
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:20,071
You had just turned six,

882
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,574
it was me who wanted something,
not you.

883
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,452
What did you want?

884
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,331
I had just been offered
a job in Denver,

885
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:35,254
pastry chef at a five star
restaurant, my own kitchen.

886
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,216
I wanted out of the bakery.

887
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,095
You wanted out?

888
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,431
Very much so.

889
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,600
Brought you with me that day

890
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,771
because I had finally worked up
the courage to tell your Zayde.

891
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,233
I was just a kid,
you needed my help?

892
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:01,946
Sort of, nothing made my
father happier than seeing you

893
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,364
and your sister,

894
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,533
thought if he was
in a good mood,

895
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,412
maybe he'd be more willing
to go along with the plan.

896
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,958
Was seeing me really
that big a deal?

897
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,588
Oh, yeah, especially
after bubbe got sick.

898
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,801
My father worked
seven days a week

899
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,679
the last 15 years of his life.

900
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:30,476
He only saw you on Jewish holidays
when you came to the bakery.

901
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,189
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

902
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,275
What happened, what did he say?

903
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,613
He didn't say anything, Jacob,

904
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,908
because I never told him.

905
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,665
It took me years to forgive him

906
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:58,587
for not reading my mind
that day.

907
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,508
Imagine that.

908
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,811
Ruben, my man, we really,
really could use your support

909
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,647
at Becker Family Breads.

910
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,526
Yes, so we'd love

I don't know, I'm not a doctor.

All right, yeah,
use the internet. Okay, bye.

932
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,587
Yeah, of course, next time
I'm in the market for a carpet,

933
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:23,713
I'll call Josh, okay.

00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:27,092
Okay, bye, Melissa, thanks, bye.

935
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,886
Melissa Kaufman says hi.

936
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,014
As does Tracy Kramer.

937
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,641
We did it, that's everyone.

938
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,144
Nice.

939
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,694
Jewish geography, right?

940
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,196
More like Jewish pornography.

941
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,656
Chad.

942
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,408
I think it's time
for a family meeting,

943
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,786
Oh, stick around, Ben,
you are practically family.

944
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:59,666
Becker family,
I have big news to share.

945
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:06,547
Okay, you asked for my help
and I've come up with the plan.

946
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,467
Is everyone familiar
with the concept win-win?

947
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,177
Nope.

948
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:15,222
Is where you win and I win,
sounds fair, right?

949
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,433
What exactly are
you winning, Chad?

950
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:22,230
Your bank payment is due four
days and you're not gonna make it.

951
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,856
Great pep talk.

952
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,483
But that's the bad news,

953
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:28,611
but the good news
is I can make it.

954
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,531
What, are you willing
to loan us that money?

955
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,201
I thought about that,
but very little upset for me,

956
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,621
remember the name of
the game is win-win.

957
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,830
Okay, so what?

958
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,833
Ah, two part plan.

959
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,338
Part one, I'm marrying
your daughter.

960
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:52,678
I've already proposed, she
accepted that deal is closed.

961
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,765
Part two, hasn't happened yet,

962
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,851
but it will as soon as
you default on your loan.

963
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,478
I've already made
a deal with the bank

964
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,147
to purchase the building,
Sarah gets me,

965
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:10,112
I get the building property
stays in the family, win-win.

966
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,658
Okay, say we agree to this.

967
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,493
No, there's nothing to agree to.

968
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,037
What happens to the bakery?
You don't own the bakery?

969
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,206
Oh no, no, no, no,
that's all yours.

970
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,291
Okay, so how does that work?

971
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,753
We live up here, we work down
there and what we pay you rent?

972
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,089
We can get into
those details later.

973
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,092
I'd like to get into
those details now, Chad.

974
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:36,262
Oh, well I'll have to talk
to my business partners.

975
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,013
Oh, now he's got partners.

976
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,349
Yeah, to see the rent comps
in the area,

977
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,269
but if you wanna stay,
I'm sure we can work...

978
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,979
Okay, Chad, yeah, you know what?

979
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,022
I am so glad that you
gave us this presentation.

980
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,858
Because of you,
I'm gonna make sure

981
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:53,112
that Becker Family Breads
has its first $40,000 week ever.

982
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,364
Me too.

983
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:57,784
Our surfing secret is off.

984
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,786
No.

985
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,329
Yeah, oh, it's happening,

986
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,207
this man wore a wet suit
on a boogie board.

987
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,126
Bro code, dude.

988
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,212
No, congratulations
on marrying my sister.

989
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,760
She's the greatest,
just ask Ben?

990
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:19,263
- What?
- I gotta go bake, but you all need to get some sleep.

991
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,350

Welcome back to the Baum.

1018
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,558
Before the break, we added
the pumpkin mixture to pasta,

1019
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,143
and sprinkled a little everything
with some bread crumbs.

1020
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,354
Now let's bake our creamy
winter pumpkin pasta

1021
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,106
for 15 minutes.

1022
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:57,112
TV Gods, dissolve us
15 minutes into the future.

1023
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,408
And now, we should
have a nice golden crisp,

1024
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:03,951
let's take a look.

1025
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:06,121
Can already smell
the wintery warmth.

1026
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,040
Cut.

1027
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,251
Where's our sous chef?

1028
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,878
Does anyone have eyes on Scott?

1029
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,504
Why does this keep
happening Alice?

1030
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,755
Does Scott hate us?

1031
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,424
Tell us the truth.

1032
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,634
I don't speak for Scott.

1033
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,470
Okay, but say you did,
say you were Scott,

1034
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,764
what would you say?

1035
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,976
Shoot, I overslept again,

1036
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:32,897
I hope those nice ladies
don't fire my lazy ass.

1037
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:35,357
Oh, wait, who am I kidding?

1038
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,151
They're total pushovers,

1039
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:41,030
I've been late like 10 times now
and I'm still employed.

1040
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:44,742
- Hell, yeah...
- And scene, thank you, Alice.

1041
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,494
- Let's take five.
- Let's take five.

1042
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,415
The network called they wanna
discuss your new weightless Mondays.

1043
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,750
What, did we upset Big Cattle?

1044
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:53,876
Hey, Layla.

1045
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,087
- Layla.
- Hi, Mrs. Baum.

1046
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,382
When did you put out
this guacamole?

1047
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,843
I just put it out.

1048
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,262
Why is it brown?

1049
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,932
I think it's just the lighting.

1050
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:11,895
Okay, well, why don't
we take a taste and see.

1051
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,396
I'm good.

1052
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,525
No, you're good, me too,
let's take a taste, cheers.

1053
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,163
It's good, it was the lighting,
my apologies.

1054
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,792
Becky, your therapist called to
confirm your session on Thursday.

1055
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,627
Oh, okay.

1056
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,796
You're going to a therapist,
are you talking about me?

1057
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,381
What are you saying about me?

1058
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,591
It's for my knee.

1059
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,344
Oh, which one?

1060
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,721
Bad one.

1061
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,556
I haven't seen you limping.

1062
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,558
She's a really good therapist.

1063
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,103
- And your mother called.
- What does she want?

1064
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,813
Well, she said
it was something important

1065
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,940
and to call her
back immediately.

1066
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,859
Well, important means either
like somebody died or...

1067
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,611
Somebody else's kid did
something more impressive

1068
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,405
than creating their
own food empire.

1069
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,991
Poo, poo, poo,
let's hope somebody died.

1070
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:11,078
Yeah, Alice, just tell our mom
that we really wanna talk to her,

1071
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:15,457
but we can't because...

1072
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,752
We're being silenced
by Big Cattle.

1073
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,059
Thank you, thank you.

1074
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,190
Take a walk with me.

1075
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,906
Can I see the ring?

1076
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,160
Very pretty.

1077
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,704
I'm not really thinking
about it right now.

1078
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,998
You should be.

1079
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,792
The bakery, there's still time
that we can...

1080
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,273
You know what my mother said to
me before I married your father.

1081
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,421
He'll do.

1082
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:49,843
Very funny, she said, this is
the most important decision

1083
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,804
a person ever makes.

1084
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,056
Things were different
in grandma's time.

1085
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,184
It was, but she was right.

1086
01:04:57,185 --> 01:05:01,730
Jobs, careers,
homes, even bakeries,

1087
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,149
they come and go,

1088
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,610
marriage is for the rest
of your life.

1089
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,695
What are you saying?
That I'm making a mistake.

1090
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,031
It doesn't matter
what I think, you are so smart,

1091
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,117
I know you're gonna
make the right choice.

1092
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:17,205
Not for me or your father or
Becker Family Breads, for you.

1093
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:22,668
Well, what if marrying Chad is the
only way for us to save the bakery?

1094
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:26,631
I mean, if he's my husband, he'll
obviously let us keep it, right?

1095
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:32,720
Why don't you ask him?

1096
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,563
What's going on?
Who are these men?

1097
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,773
These are my partners,
I told you about them.

1098
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,608
Why are they
measuring the walls.

1099
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,736
In case you want to put in
a salad bar.

1100
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:53,407
Chad, why are these men
in my bakery?

1101
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:55,868
Frank, relax,
I told you I had partners,

1102
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,704
they just need to get
to know the place.

1103
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,832
They have to do this now?
We have customers.

1104
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,169
We, since when are you part
of the family?

1105
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:11,008
Okay guys, we'll start upstairs.

1106
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:13,553
Wait, you're
measuring our bedrooms.

1107
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,890
Those men are from Panda.

1108
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,436
Chad isn't buying this bakery,
Panda Breads is.

1109
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:26,899
Sagar, this is a violation
of driver-passenger privilege.

1110
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,818
All week I've been
driving this jerk around,

1111
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:33,238
all he does is make plans to take
this bakery from the Beckers.

1112
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,823
I didn't know you spoke English.

1113
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,826
I'm from San Diego, idiot.

1114
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,455
And I love Becker Family Breads
just like everyone in this town.

1115
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:44,542
Well, I hope you like Panda.

1116
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:49,755
Find someone else to file
your taxes jointly with.

1117
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:52,717
Mom, this should
put us over the top.

1118
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:57,846
It's fake sweetheart.

1119
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,723
No, are you sure?

1120
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,725
I worked at Macy's
before I met your father,

1121
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,978
I know Cubic zirconia
when I see it.

1122
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,231
Sorry baby.

1123
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:10,735
I was gonna
replace it eventually.

1124
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,080
All right, Becker Family Breads
is closing in 10 minutes.

1125
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:27,209
- Place your final order.
- Hey, how did we do?

1126
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,128
Well, we're short.

1127
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,923
How much?

1128
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,008
Ten thousand dollars.

1129
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,806
Well, we had a good run.

1130
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,015
We sure did.

1131
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,892
Good evening, everyone,

1132
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,562
if I could ask you to put
your phones in airplane mode,

1133
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,023
keep them concealed
and clear the path

1134
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,484
down the center
through the pastry counter.

1135
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,861
I'm looking for a Frank Becker.

1136
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,863
Does anyone here
know Frank Becker?

1137
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,365
That's F-R-A...

1138
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:01,034
I am Frank Becker,
can I help you miss?

1139
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:05,373
Great, if I could just reposition
you to the center of the counter.

1140
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,502
Sure, I can reposition myself.

1141
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,171
Do you wanna buy something?

1142
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,967
We're in position, Mezuzah
and Dredal are clear to land.

1143
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,428
Okay, are you just
gonna order people around

1144
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,472
or do you want to
order some food?

1145
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,684
I'd like to order

1146
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,855
two pieces of rugelach, please.

1147
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,365
Oh, my God,
look how small it is,

1148
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,369
I didn't think I could remember it.
It's small.

1149
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:44,954
Oh, God.

1150
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,206
Oh, Becky, look upstairs.

1151
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,500
Wait a minute.

1152
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:53,378
Hold on,
we wavered our initials.

1153
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,589
That was permanent marker...

1154
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,759
Becky, it's exactly
the same upstairs.

1155
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,178
Incredible.

1156
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,431
This is, you're the little...
This is the little girl,

1157
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,892
you're the little girl
that was running around.

1158
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:10,187
I remember you, you were
three when we used to come here.

1159
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:13,940
Oh, you know,

1160
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,776
when we were little girls,

1161
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:18,195
the best sound in the world

1162
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,156
was that final bell
at the end of the school day,

1163
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:24,160
everybody loves that final bell
at the end of the school day.

1164
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,703
And when you're in grade school,

1165
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,748
it means you can go
play tag or climb a tree,

1166
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:34,002
when you're in middle school, it's
what's soccer practice or the mall.

1167
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,631
Yeah, and in high school
it's getting high in your car

1168
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,175
or getting to second
base in your car,

1169
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,927
or both, usually both.

1170
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:45,889
But for us, the final bell
meant something very different.

1171
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:50,811
It meant I was five minutes away from
the greatest sensation in the world.

1172
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,939
The fresh, fruity, cakey taste

1173
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,359
of Becker's Fresh rugelach.

1174
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,239
Drooling, you know, we were
latchkey kids. Google it.

1175
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,201
And we didn't know

1176
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,661
that rugelach cost anything

1177
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,162
because we didn't think
about money

1178
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,248
because we didn't
have any money.

1179
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:13,083
Now we have so much money

1180
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:16,628
that we've like forgotten
about it again, it's weird.

1181
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,506
It's ironic, we understand.

1182
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:22,092
But the point is that,

1183
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,678
well, we didn't know
rugelach it cost anything,

1184
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:28,348
but it turns out,
it's 25 cents a piece,

1185
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,059
and I probably
had one every day,

1186
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,229
five days a week
for about 10 years.

1187
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:38,233
- So did I.
- It was on the house, darling.

1188
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,612
Well, we heard the house
could use some help, Frank.

1189
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,243
You don't owe me anything.

1190
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,664
This is where we fell in
love with food, so, I disagree.

1191
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,041
Is it Linda?

1192
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,545
Yes.

1193
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:01,131
You still the brains
behind this operation?

1194
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:03,884
Well, I do the books.

1195
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:08,306
Okay, what's a $1.25
a week times 10 years.

1196
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,476
- Six hundred and fifty dollars
- Times two.

1197
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,102
Thirteen hundred dollars.

1198
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,062
And then interest.

1199
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,522
- Oh, interest.
- Interest.

1200
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,901
- So, five percent...
- Five percent interest.

1201
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,987
If you insist, amortized?

1202
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,406
- Yes, definitely amortized.
- Whatever that means.

1203
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,993
Don't worry,
they won't even get close.

1204
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:34,080
That's $3,184.35.

1205
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,290
That sounds fair.

1206
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,292
- Doable.
- Yeah, Alice?

1207
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:40,588
Thank you, Alice.

1208
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:42,799
We're still gonna be short.

1209
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,301
They're still gonna be short.

1210
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,513
After this, we're even Frank.

1211
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,894
Wait a minute,
I don't understand.

1212
01:11:55,895 --> 01:12:00,066
This is for $20,000.

1213
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,862
Frank, it's Hanukkah.

1214
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,204
Hey, aren't you
forgetting something?

1215
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,581
Yeah.

1216
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:21,504
Oh, say thank you, Frank.

1217
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,390
Cheers me.

1218
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:54,536
Hey, Chad, now his is
what you call a win-loose.

1219
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,163

I'll never tell.

1226
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,523
How long have you
been running this place?

1227
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,359
Too long.

1228
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:31,490
Move to New York, work for us,
we need a new sous chef.

1229
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:39,539
Nothing would make me happier,
but you gotta understand,

1230
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,543
my father wants this place
to stay in the family.

1231
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,505
And, look, I get it,
it's kind of in the name.

1232
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,594
Well, what about your sister?
Why can't she run this place?

1233
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,554
No, she's busy
with her food blog.

1234
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,973
That does not sound full time,

1235
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,475
and don't you have
internet here?

1236
01:13:58,476 --> 01:13:59,976
Yeah, yeah, we do.

1237
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,853
Okay, where's the guy
she's in love with live?

1238
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,396
You mean Ben our neig...

1239
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:05,398
No, how do you know that?

1240
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,484
How do you know that
she's in love with him?

1241
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,862
So, now what?

1242
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,617
I'm gonna get you drunk
and take all your money.

1243
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,287
And after that.

1244
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,208
No idea.

1245
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,086
I gave up my place in Chicago.

1246
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:29,674
Something tells me I'm not gonna be
moving in with Chad anytime soon.

1247
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:35,220
Well, you know,
you could always crash with me

1248
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:36,806
until you figure things out.

1249
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:42,812
And I only have a twin bed,
it's pretty uncomfortable.

1250
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,987
Why are you so good to me.

1251
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,198
Isn't it obvious?

1252
01:14:55,491 --> 01:15:00,453
No, I'm messy,
I'm impulsive, I'm picky.

1253
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,415
I constantly buy fruit
that goes bad

1254
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,543
before I get around
to eating it.

1255
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,169
You refuse to drink tap water.

1256
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:12,298
You have to pet
every single dog you pass,

1257
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,843
you suck at throwing rocks

1258
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:17,722
and you take a really long time
to figure things out.

1259
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:24,270
Exactly, who needs all this?

1260
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:26,813
Should we do it?

1261
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,440
I mean, it's the quickest way,

1262
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,775
it worked for you
in Jeff Schultz at Camp Shalom.

1263
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,279
Oh, yeah, okay,
you're coming to New York.

1264
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,990
Just watch this.

1265
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:42,913
All right kids, we're gonna
play a little game, stand up.

1266
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:47,418
This is a game my great aunt Esther,
our great on Esther taught us.

1267
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:49,836
What's it called?

1268
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,588
I'm glad you asked this
called Menorah in the Middle.

1269
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,048
How do you play?

1270
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,925
Well, with this menorah
between you,

1271
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:59,930
and you stare deeply into each
other's eyes until I pull it away.

1272
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,980
What happens when you
remove the menorah?

1273
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:12,860
Well, that's the best
part of all, you kiss.

1274
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,798
I'm going to New York,

1275
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,551
I'm going to New York.

1276
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,524
Can I talk to you for a second?

1277
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,068
Yes.

1278
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,654
I don't know how to say this,
but I've been...

1279
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,031
I said yes.

1280
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:01,032
Oh, wait, but what about...

1281
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,452
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

1282
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,914
Just walk away
before he changes his mind.

1283
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:31,188
Hey, you never told
me that Romeo joke.

1284
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,234
Actually, I didn't have one,

1285
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,737
I just always thought
of you as my Juliet.

1286
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,327
Come on, come on, come on, you two it's
starting, come on, move it, come on.

1287
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,247
It's time, it's time, it's time.

1288
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:50,916
Here we go, here we go,
here we go.

1289
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:55,378
We've got a huge show today,
not only are we making a pastry

1290
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:58,381
that tastes like our childhood
wrapped up in a flaky crust,

1291
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:02,635
but we are doing it with our
very own brand new sous chef

1292
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,846
who's gonna tell us about
his very personal connection

1293
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,098
to this very tasty concoction.

1294
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:11,228
Please give a big long
welcome to Jacob Becker.

1295
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,941
Tell us
what we're making today, Jake.

1296
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,444
Becky, we're making rugelach,

1297
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,654
which is a traditional
Jewish pastry.

1298
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,201
And we're using a recipe
that was created by my Zayde.

1299
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,746
That's grandfather
for you Gentiles out there.

1300
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,998
Zayde means grandfather, and
would it be safe to say, Jacob,

1301
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:35,585
that this is your Zayde's baby?
Because that's fun to say.

1302
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:39,881
It is fun to say and it's true because he
taught my father, my dad passed it on to me,

1303
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:43,092
and it is an honor to share it

1304
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:45,637
with each and every one
of you watching at home.

1305
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:46,721
And I hope
you'll bake along with us,

1306
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,514
and if that's too much,

1307
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:52,685
just follow along in the
shared spirit of tradition,

1308
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:57,690
creation of a profusely dense
pastry of family and love.

1309
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,734
Jacob, I don't know
if you know this,

1310
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,529
but when Becky and I were kids,
we used to walk to school.

1311
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:08,201
And every day on the way home, we
would go to your family's bakery

1312
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:12,622
and your dad would give us
two piece of rugelach,

1313
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,083
and, boy, was it delicious.
