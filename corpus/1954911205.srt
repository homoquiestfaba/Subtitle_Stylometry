00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,458
 Yeah. I just thought
 I'd pass through
 and say hi to you guys.

140
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,161
      -That's really good.
      I'm happy for you.
      -Yeah.

141
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,101
You wanna come,
get set up in the office?

142
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,637
         -Why?
         -For sleeping.

143
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,341
Um,
            well, I just thought
            I'd camp out there.

144
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,976
   You're gonna camp
   in the backyard?

145
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,011
                 Is that okay?

146
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:17,482
Um, I guess.
All right, well, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go to bed.

147
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,250
I have to get up early.
I have a huge day tomorrow.

148
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,886
             Speaking of that,
             I wanted to talk to
             you about tomorrow.

149
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,622
             Uh, I mean,
             I know it's Friday,

150
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,957
             but I was hoping
             you could move
             some things around.

151
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,694
         Because I have an idea.
         Something for us to do.

152
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,397
- Okay.
       -Yeah.

153
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,132
  Well, you know Charles Manson?

154
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,736
Uh, yeah,
I know who Charles Manson is.

155
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,105
     Well, there are these sites
     all around the city,

156
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,341
       um, that I was hoping
       we could go to.
       I have it all mapped out.

157
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:47,078
        It's amazing 'cause,
        like, no one knows
        that, like, right there,

158
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,482
   you know, that's
   the LaBianca house, you know.
   Or the Tate house.

159
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,985
Wait, these are
the murder site houses?

160
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,389
            You... You're acting
            so uptight, this is
            a thing people do.

161
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,559
No, they don't.
No, this is the thing that
weird conspiracy people do.

162
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,763
Trust me, I have friends
that come into LA all the time.
We've never...

163
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,765
- Manson has never even come up.

164
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:11,403
   Okay. Uh, guilty, Your Honor.
   I am interested in this,

165
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:15,507
      and you're my brother,
      and I just thought
      we could do this together.

166
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,176
            I'm just gonna
            be in town tomorrow.

167
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,845
   Then I'm going out to my job.

168
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:27,619
<i> Charles Manson</i>
  <i> set into motion a wave of</i>
 <i> terror in Southern California.</i>

169
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,188
    <i> In two nights,</i>
    <i> Manson's murderous spree</i>

170
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,059
 <i> took the lives</i>
 <i> of at least seven people,</i>
 <i> including actress Sharon Tate.</i>

171
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,028
  <i> Manson was portrayed as</i>
  <i> a guitar-playing ex-convict</i>

172
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,666
 <i> with a following of</i>
 <i> runaway young women,</i>
 <i> his so-called family members.</i>

173
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,736
 <i> The cult, or family,</i>
 <i> spoke of launching a holy war</i>

174
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,337
       <i> against the rich</i>
       <i> and the powerful.</i>

175
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,308
  <i> The Tate-LaBiance murders</i>
  <i> were bizarre and merciless.</i>

176
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,478
 <i> They triggered a public panic</i>
 <i> and raised the specter</i>

177
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,515
   <i> of drug-crazed youths</i>
   <i> slaughtering their victims</i>
   <i> at random.</i>

178
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,255
             Hey.

179
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,459
      What are you doing
      in my yard?

180
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,095
- It's mine.

181
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,697
 You remember me?
 I'm your uncle, Conrad.

182
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,934
No? Oh. How old are you now?

183
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,170
                   Mmm.

184
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,806
   Eight? Seven? Six? Five?

185
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,076
You're going back in time.
You're a time traveler.

186
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,178
Seven? Wow.

187
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,714
He's always been
into stuff like this.
Like, even when he was a kid,

188
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,616
he was into "Faces of Death".
You know what that is?

189
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,284
      Yeah. It's horrible.

190
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,286
Yeah, and like,
death metal, and...

191
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,890
I don't know. He was
into 9/11 for a long time.
It's just, he's like...

192
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:43,361
Just anything with death in it,
you know. He's like
all about it.

193
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,730
    -So.
    -What's the camera for?

194
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,266
I was thinking
I could get him
to take some pictures.

195
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,567
      -In an artistic way?
      -Yeah.

196
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,702
                       Oh, okay.

197
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,538
Get the ball rolling,
kinda, inspire him.

198
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,573
     Well, that's kind of sweet.

199
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,309
 What's the painting you put up?

200
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,979
 What do you mean?
 You haven't seen that before?

201
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,147
                  No.

202
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,048
        Huh. Oh.

203
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,250
Figures.

204
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,785
              What's it about?

205
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:11,623
  Well, it was...
  It was a way to show
  how I felt growing up.

206
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,359
Like, I felt sort of
like this little kid there,

207
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,662
- with a weird face
      that didn't belong.

208
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,064
          Why didn't you belong?

209
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,034
   Well... You know
   I was adopted, right?

210
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,202
                  No.

211
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,105
My parents, your grandparents,
they couldn't have kids.

212
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,673
  And so they adopted me.

213
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,408
  But then
  a couple of years later,

214
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,077
 your grandma got pregnant
 with your dad.

215
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,679
He's their real son.

216
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:39,484
And they were so happy
that he was born, that, um,
they sort of forgot about me.

217
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,885
             That's not nice.

218
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,288
             No.

219
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,962
Okay, so I've got
   the whole day planned out.

220
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,798
   First we go to the Tate house
   then the LaBianca house.

221
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,803
    Then, if you're into it,
    um, tomorrow, we could drive
    out to the desert together.

222
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,672
What's that book?

223
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,508
   Well, this is<i> Helter Skelter.</i>
   You know, the classic.

224
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,910
             It's got all, um,
             the police reports

225
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,946
            and testimonies,
            stuff like that.

226
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,215
 -It's actually Mom and Dads'.
 -Really?

227
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,818
   Yeah, it was in Dad's office.
   I went into it one day
   and I opened it up.

228
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,221
             It was just, like,
             so weird, you know,

229
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:19,190
         these dead bodies,
         they're all whited out,
         you know.

230
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:23,294
        It's almost more scary
        that they don't show you
        what the thing is.

231
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,230
      And then there's all these
      pictures of Charlie

232
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,398
    from all the different times
    he was in prison.

233
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,100
              And then there are
              the Manson Girls,

234
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,870
   who are just so fucking hot.
   Look at that.

235
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,038
           But at the same time,
           you know that if
           you got with them,

236
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,875
they could probably cut
      your dick off, too, right?

237
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,444
That sounds...
Sounds very enticing.

238
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,281
           It's got everything.
           It's got murder, sex,
           it's got it all.

239
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,617
  What about, um...
  What's going on
  with those kids?

240
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:49,721
     The Manson Girls have kids.
     Most of them
     were Charlie's, actually.

241
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,389
          Wow.

242
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,192
        Oh! Dude, um, turn here.

243
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,261
   Oh, my God.

244
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,531
I can't believe that
we're at the Sharon Tate house.

245
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,068
      -Look, look.
      Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
      -Yeah?

246
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,336
             Look what I got.

247
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,705
What... What is that?

248
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,808
             You wanna maybe
             shoot some photos?

249
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,511
          Turn it into
          an art project, maybe.

250
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,447
      -Yeah. Maybe. Cool.
      -Yeah.

251
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,954
--The amount of excitement
   you have right now

252
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,722
  is like, seriously
  disturbing to me.

253
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,191
Oh, my God.

254
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,760
     Hello.

255
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,261
  Dude, this is like
  a historic spot.

256
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,497
I can't believe
we can just walk right up.

257
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,967
          -Whoa.
          -Oh, my God.

258
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,769
That's enough.
We can just...

259
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,638
Do you have to go
right up to the thing?

260
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,540
     Why?
     It's a public street.

261
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,975
--I don't think it is.

262
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,811
It's just like in the books.

263
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,914
  The gate is here,
  everything. Do you see that?

264
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:54,619
That's where Sharon Tate's
house was, right up there.
That's where it happened.

265
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,120
             Man, I wish
             I could get closer.

266
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,389
  We don't need to get
  closer than this.
  This is fine.

267
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,959
             Well, good thing is
             lot of the stuff
             happened here.

268
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,661
       Oh, my God!
       This is probably the same

269
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,698
     pole that Tex climbed up.
     See, they thought there was
     gonna be an alarm,

270
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,201
      so he climbed up
      with wire cutters, and he
      snipped all the wires.

271
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,138
   He jumped over,
   and then right then there was
   this young kid driving away.

272
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,474
           He was just randomly
           there that night.

273
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,942
        Never been there before.

274
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,912
             And Tex, like,
             starts stabbing him
             through the window.

275
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,880
          But he scooches back,
          put his hands up.

276
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,483
        So Tex has to shoot him
        four times in the chest.

277
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,987
--Okay. You know what?
 I'm gonna go back to the car.

278
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,588
           -Why? Hey.
           -Because--

279
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,190
                Oh, come on.
                I'm sorry.

280
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,025
No. You can do whatever
you want. I'm just not
gonna be part of it.

281
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,894
          Stop, please.
          Wait, okay? I'm sorry.

282
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,429
      Just take a picture of me.

283
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,165
          -All right?
          -Why?

284
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,469
      I wanna get...
      I might do a self portrait
      from this.

285
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,804
   -Are you fucking with me?
   -No, I'm serious.

286
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,174
All right. Here.
Let's do it right here.

287
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,111
              I want to get
              the gate at least.

288
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:57,081
             Dude, it's the same
             fucking gate.
             That's amazing.

289
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,018
           A lot of it
           happened on the lawn.

290
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,421
Okay, stop talking
so I can take
the photograph, will you?

291
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,522
         Okay, hold on, hold on.

292
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,625
Hold on.

293
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,460
     This guy's gonna
     call the cops.

294
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,098
      Oh, my God.
      What are you doing?

295
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,933
         -God damn it.
         -Oh! Come on.

296
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,202
  Charles Manson killed
  people right here.

297
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,104
You have to be
fucking respectful about that.

298
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,106
              He wasn't even
              here that night.

299
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,976
     He wasn't at the Tate house
     or the LaBianca house.

300
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,244
    -Well...
    -He didn't kill anyone.

301
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,146
Then why is he in jail
for murder?

302
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,614
                      Exactly!

303
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,516
  -I mean, it was
  a fucking conspiracy.
  -Okay. Keep your voice down.

304
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:35,553
      It's because of his ideas.
      They couldn't have
      someone that free

305
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,424
   being, living out amongst us,
   'cause it would make
   everyone else feel like,

306
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,426
             "What are you gonna
             do with your life?"

307
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,629
   -Keep your voice down!
   -I don't give a shit about
   those fucking people.

308
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,931
            Hey! Charles Manson!

309
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,000
- God damn it!

310
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,302
           Charles Manson!

311
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,987
            Hey.

312
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,526
I'm sensing some tension.

313
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,330
     Look, sorry.

314
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,632
Let me take you
  out to lunch, okay?

315
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,569
I know a really good place.

316
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,472
  Are you gonna talk about
  Charles Manson the whole time?

317
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,142
       I don't have to.

318
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,279
               ♪

319
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,815
There's like no limit to
 the amount you can work,

320
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,750
      which is like,
      part of the deal
      when you become a partner.

321
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:43,488
 And, you know, the money
 is commensurate with that work.

322
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,823
          But it's... It's like,
          when do you stop?

323
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,025
         You know what I mean?
         Like, when does it end?

324
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,361
Hey, guys, I'll just
pick that up
when you're ready.

325
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,262
                  Okay. Thanks.

326
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,197
      -I got it. I got it.
      -No, I got it.

327
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,332
            Come on.

328
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,667
            -Really?
            -Yes.

329
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,238
     -All right. Thank you.
     -I told you I was
     taking you out.

330
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,074
So, wait, before we go,
I got to tell you,

331
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,877
um, this table that
we're sitting at...

332
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,879
This very same table.

333
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:12,483
This is the same booth
that they ate at before
they went home that night.

334
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,653
               Who? What are you
               talking about?

335
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,591
Sharon Tate and her friends.
They ate here before that
same night they went home.

336
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,194
And then,
Tex and the girls came.

337
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,663
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

338
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,166
        -Got it. Got it.
        -Oh.

339
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,101
       So that's why we're here.

340
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,403
Oh, come on.
It's just a fun fact.

341
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,972
      You think it's a fun fact,
      but it's not.

342
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,342
             I mean, it's, like,
             really disturbing.

343
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,744
 Okay, I'm sorry,

344
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,446
but I mean,
it is something that I've
been thinking about that...

345
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,615
I mean, a lot of people
ignore death,

346
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:49,921
and it's something
to think about
and not just shove away.

347
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,990
            Are you...
            Do you hear yourself
            right now?

348
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:57,828
   I mean, you... You're talking
   about not ignoring death,
   and embracing it.

349
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,599
  But when it comes to
  Dad's funeral, you don't come.
  Like, what is that?

350
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,569
You know, we weren't
getting along. I mean...

351
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:08,272
Do you know the last time
that he called me?

352
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,974
            When's the last time
            you called him?

353
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,809
 I gave up calling.

354
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,379
Why? What's the point
of calling? And it's, like,
there's nothing going on.

355
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,181
There was no exchange
going on.

356
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,884
        Even if you're not gonna
        go to the funeral
        for Dad's sake,

357
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,018
    you could have come for Mom.

358
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,920
Mom's way better off,
you know.

359
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,422
             How would you know?

360
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,824
             You don't know.
             You're just talking
             out of your ass.

361
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,860
  Mom was a fucking basket case.
  She found him on the floor.

362
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,763
       She was, like, hysterical
       for weeks.

363
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:37,134
 She was a wreck, I was a wreck.
 I had to do the flowers,
 I had to do the casket,

364
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,703
       I had to do the cemetery,

365
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:39,904
   I had to do the announcement,

366
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,472
   -I had to do the invites.
   -Okay.

367
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,407
           You know what I mean?
           I don't want to talk
           to those people.

368
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,109
Okay.

369
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,111
So, you can understand then...

370
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,314
         No, I can't understand.

371
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,750
Look, you didn't want
my help, you know.

372
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,987
I mean, you're glad.
You're taking care
of everything again,

373
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,688
 and you look good,
 and Mom loves you.

374
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,925
And that's the dynamic
that you have, and,
"Oh, fucking, Connie.

375
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,727
I know." You know.

376
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,129
I mean, that's fine.

377
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,031
      Yeah, that's...
      Your dynamic is just like,

378
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:10,701
       oh, yeah, it's impossible
       and, you know,
       everybody hates you.

379
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,805
    Don't they?

380
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,583
        This car taken?

381
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,820
Dude, I'm sorry. Okay?

382
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,556
           Look, um...

383
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,094
 Let's just go back to my house.
 I'm gonna go do my thing.

384
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,163
     Why don't you take the car?
     You can do whatever,

385
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,132
        the rest of the stuff
        you want to do today.

386
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,139
      I think we should
      smoke together.
      All right?

387
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,840
      I am not gonna smoke weed.

388
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,109
            Why?

389
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,879
  -I'm not in the mood for it.
  -That's the point.

390
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,481
I think you need this, man.

391
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,517
 -You have the day off, right?
 -Yeah.

392
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,620
  Okay.
  So let's enjoy the day.

393
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,497
You're right. I didn't
deal with Dad's death. Okay?

394
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,873
It's really good.

395
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,230
    How do you feel?

396
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,306
- It's pretty good.

397
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,174
          What are we doing?

398
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:01,846
   We're going to Leo
   and Rosemary LaBianca's
   old residence.

399
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,717
- All right.

400
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,145
          -Is that it?
          -God.

401
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,847
    This is the
    LaBianca house, man.

402
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,749
Holy shit!

403
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,551
           Come on. Come on.

404
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:44,989
      I bet the kitchen is on
      this side, and the kitchen
      is key here, okay?

405
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:48,959
   Because that's where they
   wrote on the fridge in blood,
   "Helter Skelter".

406
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:52,229
- Oh.
-      -That all came     from this kitchen.

407
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,565
 Oh, my God.
 I gotta get into the kitchen.

408
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,567
                   Go, go. Go.

409
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,070
  I wish we could get closer.

410
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,572
                       Get up.

411
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,379
               Oh, dude.
               There's the owner
               of the house.

412
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,481
- What do we do?
     -I got an idea.

413
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:13,284
What? What? Are you sure?

414
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,653
      -Hey, um, excuse me.
      -What are you doing?

415
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,588
Okay,
     just let me handle it.

416
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,623
           Hi.

417
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,360
     Um, we are...
     Can we talk to you
     for a second?

418
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,296
  No, I'm sorry.

419
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,298
- Oh.
          -No.

420
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,700
      -Um...
      -What are you doing?

421
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,203
      Just chill. Um...

422
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,272
  We are the grandchildren
  of the LaBiancas.

423
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,244
You're the grandchildren?

424
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:43,714
   -You'll have to forgive me
   for being so defensive.
   -Wow.

425
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:48,152
You can imagine we have
a lot of strange people
coming here all the time.

426
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,920
          -No problem.
          -Yeah.

427
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,022
             All is in the past,
             you know.

428
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,691
      -Thank you.
      -Oh, you're welcome.

429
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,994
It's amazing that
you let us in.
I just thank you so much.

430
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,930
- Yes, what he said.

431
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,500
       -Nice to meet you.
       -Good to meet you.
       This is Conrad.

432
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,135
    -Hi Conrad. I'm Janice.
    -Hi. Nice to meet you.

433
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,804
                 Beautiful skin.

434
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,472
      Thank you.

435
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,241
Sorry, it's
a little messy in here.

436
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:13,711
Oh, no, it's beautiful.
What are you talking about?
This place is gorgeous.

437
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,747
Oh, well, I like to
keep it neater than this.

438
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,415
This is where the body was.

439
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,884
         LaBianca, the guy.

440
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,686
   They carved into his stomach.
   They stabbed him right here.

441
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,988
Shut the fuck up.

442
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,659
      Um, he was just saying
      that this area right here,

443
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:32,596
  we have a photograph
  with us playing with
  trains right here.

444
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,499
            This guy was so cute
            in the photos.

445
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,034
- Yes.
          -Of course.

446
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,571
   -Just being in this room
   is so cool It's really...
   -Yes.

447
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,740
...you know,
             special for us.

448
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,209
       I'm sure this is not
       a subject you're fond of,

449
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,712
       but I was just wondering,
       you know, after
       what happened here,

450
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,883
     do you ever feel, like,
     you know, just creeped out,
     you know?

451
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,785
    No. Not really.

452
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:59,790
It is strange, knowing
that Charles Manson was
actually in the house.

453
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,426
       Wait. What?

454
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,628
    Charles Manson
    was in the house?

455
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,264
Yes. He's the one
who broke in.

456
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,866
   That's weird,
   because I had heard

457
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:12,336
  that Charles Manson
  was not a part of
  the murders at all.

458
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:16,507
     Well, no, he just came in
     and tied them up, but he
     wasn't part of the murders.

459
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,243
  You know, at the Tate house
  I told you it was such a mess.

460
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,778
        And so they wanted to...

461
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,280
  -He just wanted to make
  sure it was like cleaner...
  -Yeah.

462
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,216
    You know, for... When the...
    For the LaBiancas.

463
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,786
       -Mmm-hmm.
       -I mean, Pop Pop.
       You know.

464
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,321
Um...

465
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,923
I must
             sound like a freak.

466
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:37,695
        I just... I mean,
        I've researched it
        because it's our family.

467
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:41,332
       Anyway,
       it fucking sucks that
       that happened, obviously.

468
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,467
      He's sorry.

469
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:46,203
              Um, do you have...
              I mean, duh,

470
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,272
             obviously,
             you have a kitchen,

471
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,507
             but could we take
             a quick look at it?

472
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,043
       The kitchen?

473
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,845
Gee, I'm sorry, it's...

474
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,449
   It's a real mess.
   Right now I'd really
   rather you didn't.

475
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:01,051
         I mean, I don't mind
         if it's a little messy.

476
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,252
Maybe some other time.

477
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,188
       But, you know, it's fine.
       Like, I mean--

478
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,590
 No, no, it's okay.
 It's okay.

479
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,459
This is more than enough.

480
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,695
            Well, I mean,
            this was kind of
            the whole point.

481
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,864
            I guess, just 'cause
            of the memories.

482
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,102
    -But...
    -She doesn't want
    us to go in the kitchen.

483
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,503
              Okay. Sorry. Yeah.

484
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,605
No, it's all right.
I understand.

485
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,073
  Maybe another time.

486
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,843
   You know what?
   Thank you so much
   for doing this for us.

487
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:26,844
You're very welcome.

488
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:29,146
You know, I actually
wanted to let you know,

489
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,916
when we were coming in,
I saw that your retaining wall
right at the front here

490
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,351
was sloping a little bit.

491
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,220
    So, on the way out
    maybe I could show you that.

492
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,756
   'Cause my wife and I went
   through the same thing.
   It was really easy to fix.

493
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:39,623
            -Really?
            -Yeah.

494
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,358
  Did you need to go
  to the bathroom?

495
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,760
  Um, you had to go.

496
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,295
        Oh, yeah. Okay, great.
        I'll go to the bathroom.

497
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,597
    -Yeah.
    -I'll met you guys at...

498
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,032
      -Cool.
      -The retaining wall.

499
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,600
        -Just over here?
        -To the left.

500
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,201
This is so easy to fix.

501
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,603
        Is it the one
        with the bricks?

502
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,471
Yeah, you gotta
catch it now, though.

503
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,842
               ♪

504
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,592
Hey.

505
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,429
     -Who are you?
     -Who the fuck are you?

506
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:20,431
  I'm sorry. I just... You're...

507
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,666
   Is that
   a Charlie Manson t-shirt?

508
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,670
        Hey! Nick!
        Dude, abort!

509
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,972
   -What are you doing?
   -Get the hell out of here!

510
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,774
Hey!

511
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,578
Frank!
   Frank, what are you doing?

512
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,514
I wake up from my nap
and this guy's in our kitchen

513
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,851
 taking pictures
 in a Charlie Manson shirt.

514
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:41,819
                 What?

515
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,688
   -I'm sorry. I can explain.
   -Explain!

516
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,770
Hey.
         Excuse me.

517
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,208
      This is why we end up
      feeling like prisoners
      in our own home.

518
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,113
   I'm sorry.
   I'm so sorry.

519
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:12,716
            I mean, you did
            choose to live here.
            I mean...

520
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:17,454
     I had no idea what we'd be
     getting ourselves into when
     we bought this place.

521
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,389
I don't understand you.

522
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,592
        A horrible thing
        happened here!

523
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,761
          And you want
          to celebrate that?

524
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,131
 Haven't you ever lost anyone?

525
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,639
I was, like,
 telling somebody the other day
 my dad's dead.

526
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,542
  -I was, like,
  trying to be cool about it.
  -Mmm-hmm.

527
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,645
          But it's, like, weird
          to say it, you know.

528
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:45,649
I don't know.
          It's just weird.

529
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:49,319
 But here we are,
 here, a perfect family.

530
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,990
           This is the best shot
           of you guys.

531
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,926
         Like, you, Mom and Dad.
         This is, like, what's
         always in my head.

532
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,428
Yeah.
I hate that fucking photo.

533
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,863
                 You do?

534
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,366
             -Yes.
             -Why?

535
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,702
You can see how
he fucking felt about me.
He's not even touching me.

536
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,572
          He's just posing
          for a photograph, man.

537
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:12,376
Okay, do you want to fucking
argue about the composition
of the photo?

538
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:16,480
We're talking about reality,
and how the guy was
kind of a dick.

539
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:21,084
    I personally think
    that you expected Dad to do
    everything for you as a kid.

540
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,988
  -But, like...
  -No, just to love me, maybe.

541
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,624
    He's an army guy, all right?

542
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:32,329
   And he has, you know,
   he has that power thing,
   and that's part of his setup.

543
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:36,133
       Like, you had to add that
       to that a little bit,
       if you want...

544
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,135
  That's not love.

545
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:41,705
That's not raising someone
to be their own person.

546
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,208
That's making
a little fucking clone.

547
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,910
       So, uh, so what,
       I'm dad's little soldier?

548
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,512
                That's basically
                how you see me?

549
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,681
I mean, you have a kid,
you got the wife.

550
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,282
You know, everything,
which is good. I'm just...

551
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,351
  -Yeah, I have a kid
  and a wife.
  -It's a lot of good things.

552
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,788
You made him happy,
he gave you money
because you were going

553
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,525
  -to "law school" and that's
  such a great thing to do.
  -"Law school?"

554
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:05,162
        You don't put air quotes
        around law school.
        It's a real thing.

555
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:08,498
    Which is how I earn a living
    and buy food

556
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,634
        to put inside the people
        inside the house.

557
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,903
Yeah, it seems like it's
working out great for you.

558
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,012
That's it, huh? Hey!

559
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,949
You know, dad wasn't
the only one in the family

560
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:29,386
  who treated me like
  a fucking outcast, okay?

561
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,155
You did your fair share
of treating me like
a piece of shit.

562
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,409
   Do you know
   where the Melatonin is?

563
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,745
         No, I'm sorry, I don't.

564
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,782
  I don't understand
  how it disappears.

565
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:01,351
 Like, who takes the
 Melatonin?

566
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,924
       You seem really agitated.
       Is something wrong?

567
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:12,329
Conrad basically thinks
that I threw him under the bus
our entire childhood.

568
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,165
And that I got
special treatment.

569
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,069
                      Yeah.

570
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,605
What do you mean, "Yeah"?

571
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,342
You know that you and your dad
had a really strong bond, right?

572
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,945
     -Mmm-hmm.
     -And I can understand
     how Connie

573
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,514
         probably felt
         excluded from you guys.

574
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,450
Okay, he excluded himself.

575
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,118
             But that doesn't...
             Why?

576
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,822
That's what he does.
He likes to, like,
act like the outsider,

577
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:43,260
and like, push people away,
and poke and prod people.
He gets off on that shit.

578
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,495
         Why would he get off
         on something like that?

579
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,864
Because he's
messed up in the head.

580
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,633
    -Genetically, probably.
    -Dude.

581
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,569
Like, I looked into
his adoption one time,

582
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:55,005
and it said that he
was a ward of the state.

583
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,773
                 That's so mean.
                 Stop it.

584
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,408
   You asked me,
   and my answer is

585
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,345
I think there's
some weird chemistry
going on in his brain.

586
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,817
          Well, I think that
          no matter what Connie,

587
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,086
            or anyone ever does,

Hold on, hold on.
Let me see which ones

Wait, wait.

617
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,639
  Yeah, there's a nice
  picture of a family.

618
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,941
           Are they real
           brothers and sisters?

619
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,876
     No, they're, um,

620
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,512
  they're not a real family.
  It's actually better
  than a real family

621
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,015
   because they went out
   and found each other.

622
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,451
   What are they doing
   in the middle of this desert?

623
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:51,354
   Well, they...
   They wanted to get
   away from society

624
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,757
and from people
that didn't understand them,

625
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,827
you know, because that was
like hurting them,

626
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,829
  other peoples
  perception of them.

627
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:02,399
     So they went out here
     and they got a big bus,

628
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,067
    and you know, they cared
    about the environment.

629
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,636
They wanted to get back
into touch with something,

630
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,039
  you know, more real.

631
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,808
      What are all of these
      dead people?

632
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,480
    Oh, um, they're just
    some people who just,
    I don't know...

633
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,949
They were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

634
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,317
               Like Grandpa?

635
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,920
No. Grandpa died
because he had a heart attack.

636
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,756
  Um, these people
  were actually killed.

637
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,625
But Grandpa, like,
killed himself in a way

638
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,863
because he was...
worked himself up
all the time.

         talking about?

640

         Oh, nothing,
         just hanging out,
         playing...

641
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,202
   We're reading<i> Helter Skelter.</i>

642
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:42,639

    of dead people.

643
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,182

               before you start,

644
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:55,185
 I was just looking at the book,
 he asked me questions.

645
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:56,987
    He's curious.
    What am I gonna fucking say?

646
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,755
-You're showing him dead bodies?
-I was trying to...

647
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,423
 You're showing him

648
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,225
 What else are
 you gonna show him?

649
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,361
       I'm sorry,
       but he's the one who
       kept asking me questions.

650
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,631
He's a child.
He's gonna want to do
whatever you want to do.

651
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,166
  You just say no.

652
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,134
If he wants to look at it
you just say no.
That's what you do.

653
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,937
             Why? I'm not gonna
             fucking lie to him.

654
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:16,406

open up Internet fucking porn

    that's out there.

putting your shit on him.

658
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,247
           Okay. Well, why is he
           having a hard time?

659
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,184
"Why is he
having a hard time?"
He's a child.

People have hard times.

661
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,924

00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,435

710
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,489
                Fuck!

711
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:01,558
         -Jesus Christ!
         -What?

712
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,926
                       A cop.

713
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,230
             Pull over.

714
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,232
    I wasn't even
    fucking doing anything!

715
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,934
            Well, pull over.

716
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:12,669
       Dude, I can't. I can't!

717
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:13,670
                   Why?

718
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,638
         -Pull over.
         -Fucking shit! Okay!

719
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,749
         Dude, um,
         we got to switch seats.

720
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,219
     -What?
     -Dude, come on,
     switch seats with me.

721
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:32,155
    -Why?
    -I just... I was

722
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,326
         -Roll it down.
         -Okay.

723
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,729
  Hello. Hi.

724
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,364
         Do you know why
         I pulled you over, sir?

725
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,601
Um, yeah, I know
I might have swerved
a little bit.

726
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:47,003
But I was just, like,
dropped a CD.

727
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,873
You know, it got
all scratched up and I was
trying to clean it off.

728
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:54,344
Anyway, but it's back in there,
we're fine. Thank you
for the reminder.

729
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:57,714
      Uh-huh. Can I see
      your license, registration
      and insurance, please?

730
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,784
It's really not necessary.
I mean...

731
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,220
         Here's the registration
         and insurance.

732
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,889
        Sir, please keep
        your hands on the wheel.

733
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,457
                         Okay.

734
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,826
 Just do what he says.

735
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,461
           And the license, sir?

736
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,766
      You do not have
      a drivers license,
      is that what I understand?

737
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,168
No. Are you gonna
give me a big lecture now?

738
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,705
    Do you realize it is
    a serious offense to operate
    a vehicle without a license?

739
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,141
     I can take you in right now
     and impound this vehicle.

740
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:28,011
I'm so happy
you have such power over me.

741
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,712
    Have you been drinking, sir?

742
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,215
   No, I have not
   been drinking, sir.

743
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,383
      All right, watch the tone.

744
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,351
 We've just had
 a really tough ride.

745
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,754
My brother and I
are not getting along well.

746
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,589
 Okay, I need you to put
 your hands on the hood, please.

747
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,058
  -I'm trying to talk to you.
  -Do not resist me.

748
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,293
          Do not resist me.

749
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,495
              I'm not fucking...
              Jesus Christ!

750
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:47,997
 -Do you have a weapon on you?
 -No!

751
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,800
Does that feel good,
to fucking grab me, you pig?

752
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:51,734
         Stop talking!

753
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,510
You're free to go.

754
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,151
Jesus,
   that guy was such a dick.

755
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,954
               The cop that
               you called a pig?

756
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:14,057
He was.

757
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,193
    How much was it?

758
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,462
           Um, it was not cheap.

759
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,931
     Shit. How much?

760
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,633
           -Thousand.
           -Thousand?

761
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:24,734
                       Yeah.

762

I talked them
down to 600, though.

763
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,237
- Really?
       -Yeah.

764
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,539
    -That's great.
    -I know, it's what I do.

    Here, I'll pay you back.

    I sold all my stuff.

771
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,958

           more than me.

    He's not going to come, man.

859
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:48,357
    Stop worrying.
    He'll either come,

860
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,626
or we'll talk to those people
and we'll figure it out, okay?

861
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,528
    -Don't mind hanging out?
    -No, I don't.

862
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,697
      I'm enjoying myself.

863
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,365
  I'm enjoying
  whooping your fucking ass.

864
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,701
--Listen to this.
    You wanna hear a sound?

865
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,102
Listen to this sound.

866
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,208
     Right?

867
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,443
                Oh, God.

868
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,448
So...

869
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:17,653
         I got to tell you.
         I am sorry about
         what happened with Max.

870
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,689
          I was not trying to...

871
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:21,824
            You know,
            that wasn't my plan.

872
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:24,460
             The book was there,
             he asked me.

873
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:28,364
               I mean, I know
               I shouldn't have,
               but I told him.

874
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:31,567
  I get it. I get it.
  I'm sorry I yelled.

875
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,003
  You know, I'm...
  I overreacted.

876
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,973
And I'm just...
I'm worried about him.

877
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:40,843
He's, you know...
Sometimes I worry
he's not totally normal.

878
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:44,180
You know? I mean, he's, like...
Talks about death a lot.

879
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,649
  -Mmm-hmm.
  -And he's into weird stuff.

880
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,086
 He drew this picture
 with people, like,

881
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,189
you know, bleeding
out of their faces. Right?

882
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:55,658
                Well, Dad died.

883
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,560
    -Yeah.
    -He's dealing with that.

884
00:49:57,562 --> 00:50:00,463
             You know,
             he's working it out
             in the drawings.

885
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,133
        Yeah.

886
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,168
             He's dealing with
             the idea of death.

887
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,404
          It's like a real thing
          for him now.

888
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:09,839
                    He's fine.

889
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,907
             I mean, he will be.

890
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,509
             You got to be there
             for him, though.

891
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,179
That's fucking deep, man.

892
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,416
You just dropped it
on me just now.

893
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:24,954
     It's true.

894
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,759
             -Dude.
             -What?

895
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,193
               That's Blackbird.

896
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,067
         That's him.
         I'm gonna check it out.

897
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,275
Why is this girl
wearing a Manson t-shirt?

898
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,978
            -Is she?
            -Yeah.

899
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,114
She's wearing
the same t-shirt
that you had on.

900
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:55,718
I...
          I hadn't noticed that.

901
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,219
          I'm gonna just go over
          and talk to him.

902
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,555
   Wait, wait a second.
   What the fuck is going on?

903
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,824
I...

904
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,994
      I don't know. I mean...
      I'll tell you after, okay?
      I just gotta talk--

905
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:07,730
    No, no, no, no, no, no.
    Talk to me first.

906
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,366
Talk to me first.
What is that?

907
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:13,169
Tell me what the fuck
is going on with that
Manson t-shirt.

908
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,205
        Okay,
        the environmental group,

909
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:19,708
       they have a slight
       association with Charlie.

910
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,577
      He just started the group.

911
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,345
He started
the environmental group?

912
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:27,349
   Yes. This group is picking up
   on the positive aspects
   of his philosophy.

913
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,685
  He was actually
  talking about the environment,

914
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:31,087
         you know,
         before a lot of people.

915
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,089
You're coming out here
to work with Charles Manson?

916
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,357
         -Dude.
         -See, I knew.

917
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,693
      I fucking
      bring up Charles Manson
      and you fucking freak out.

918
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,095
Everybody freaks out!

919
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:41,897
Everybody freaks out
when you bring up
Charles Manson!

920
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,134
      Fuck! Where did he go? Oh.

921
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,904
                 Shit.

922
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,541
   Come on!
   He's getting away.

923
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,643
Okay, here's the deal.

924
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,512
I am willing
to follow this guy,

925
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:58,714
but you don't
get out of the car
until I say so.

926
00:51:58,716 --> 00:51:59,949
            That's him!

927
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,184
Okay, okay. All right.

928
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:03,886
Shit,
             go around this guy.

929
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,521
All right, I'm not
gonna get too close.

930
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:08,090
  -Yeah, yeah.
  -We'll just wait and
  let's just see what happens.

931
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:09,692
What is the plan?
What are we doing?

932
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:12,294
      I gotta show him
      this letter I have,
      and it'll be fine.

933
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,164
    -Blackbird should
    know who I am.
    -What's with the names?

934
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,565
      Blackbird.

935
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,734
        Charlie gives
        everybody nicknames.

936
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,536
He's turning, he's turning.

937
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:21,737
Go, go, go.

938
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,272
                           Nice!

939
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,578
Where the fuck did he go?

940
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,280
                Go... Go faster.

941
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,692
               Whoa, whoa, whoa.
               Hold up. Hold up.

942
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,699
       He must have
       gone around back.

943
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,868
Hold on a second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

944
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,403
Where'd he go?

945
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,273
       -Hello?
       -He was just here.

946
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,141
Can you slow down?

947
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,260
                       Hey!

948
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:19,995
                 Fuck!

949
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,365
             Shit!

950
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,737
          Go, go, go!

951
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,539
Hey!

952
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,074
         Motherfucker!

953
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,511
           Hey! Hey!
           Leave him alone!

954
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:36,979
       Wait! I'm Conrad!

955
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,547
I've been writing to Charlie!

956
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,116
   He told me!
   He told me I could
   work with you guys!

957
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,219
I'm Conrad Morgan!

958
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,354
  Please don't hurt us.

959
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,490
                     Morgan?

960
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,628
You're Captain Morgan?

961
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,864
    -Yes.
    -Charlie fucking talks
    about you all the time.

962
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,366
                      Every day.

963
00:53:57,368 --> 00:54:00,202
 -Every day he talks about you.
 -Okay. Yeah.

964
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:02,204
- Come on.
-      -I'm sorry.

965
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,041
  Lean back.
  This eye.

966
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:08,577
      -Okay.
      -You've gotta just
      keep it open for me.

967
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,046
Okay. No, you have to open it.

968
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:13,048
     -It's, like, burning.
     -There we go. Quickly.

969
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,651
       -Okay, go.
       -It sees the thing
       and it retracts.

970
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:19,722
I know. They're like
two little angry clams.

971
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:22,791
What?

972
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:24,893
They're chomping down.

973
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,629
          -Other eye.
          -Okay.

974
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,732
   One, two...

975
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,700
--Now blink that eye.

976
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,137
Breathe.
In through your nose.

977
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:37,539
--Out through your mouth.

978
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,082
--Now I can see you.

979
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,052
      Good.

980
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:52,288
 You look better.

981
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,858
Your eyes are so blue,
like icicles.

982
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,197
I'm gonna go
put this stuff away.

983
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,033
            Thanks.

984
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,741
        Oh, my God.

985
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,576
             What did she say?

986
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:18,647
She said, "I don't mind
that you saw me naked."

987
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,317
             You can't do that.

988
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,152
         I think that's
         Blackbird's girlfriend.

989
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,287
 I don't know.
 I don't think so.

990
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:29,458
  I'm afraid you're gonna
  get hit in the head with
  a fucking lead pipe, you know.

991
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,630
   And what's with...
   You wrote a letter to Manson?

992
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,501
    -Yeah.
    -And he wrote you back?

993
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:43,906
You know, I mean,
we have stuff in common,
like, you know, he...

994
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:46,208
never knew
who his dad was and stuff,

995
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,011
and had a tough time
growing up.

996
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:52,381
I know it sounds weird,
but, yeah, just...

997
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:55,651
I was not doing that well
and I wrote him,

998
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,387
and he wrote me back and...

999
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,422
 that's pretty cool.

1000
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:03,992
The things he said, it was...
It helped me a lot.

1001
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,394
           And what did he say?

1002
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,134
       Conrad, come here.

1003
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:14,470
I'm gonna talk a walk with you.
There's something I want
to show you.

1004
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:16,872
Something that you're
probably gonna be
pretty excited to see.

1005
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,907
Can my brother come?

1006
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,944
         Suit yourself.

1007

 Conrad, I don't know
 if you're aware of this,

1008

Charlie into solitary
couple of weeks ago.

    been able to reach him.
    -Uh-huh.

1010
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,728
He's supposed to
get out pretty soon,

1011
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,097

these fucking pigs up there.

           to put him in

1316
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:12,687
           He treated you
           like a piece of shit,
           and I did, too.

1317
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:15,122
  And I threw you under the bus.

1318
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:17,825
            And... I'm just...

1321

01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:42,216

01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,952
     -Okay.

     good brother to you.

1328
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:46,854
             I don't know how
             to fucking do that,

1329
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:49,557

 I gotta see this
 through, all right?

1343

if you understood.

1347
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,715
            -Or try.
            -Okay.

I know what I'm doing.
