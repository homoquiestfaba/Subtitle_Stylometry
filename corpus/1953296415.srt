2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,110
Okay. I've just finished suffling the deck

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,140
and will now pick out the very card

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,510
Justin chose moments ago, using only my...

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,780
...magic, magic, magic!

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,960
Boom! Is this your card?

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,790
- No.
- OK, all right.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,330
- Boom! Is this your card?
- No.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,960
OK. All right, it's
gotta be here somewhere.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,330
Zeke, the card is still in my pocket.

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,800
You never put it back into the deck.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,070
Right. Is this your card?

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,640
- Yeah! Oh!
- Ah!

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,380
So, it looks like Zeke has a new hobby.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,650
- Yep. - And it sounds
like you love it.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,980
Nope.

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,680
And now, for my next trick...

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,560
I'll need a volunteer
to lend me some money.

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,660
Any size bill will do.

20
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,330
All right, well, I got a five,

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,300
- I have a 20...
- Twenty, OK, great.

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,830
Zeke, I have smaller bills!

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,430
Not to worry, Max.

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,330
Because, before your very eyes,

25
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,870
I'm gonna squeeze this bill
back together using only my...

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,410
...magic, magic!

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,180
Abraca...
Oh, it didn't work.

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,320
Zeke, you know what I think you did wrong?

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,650
You weren't squeezing hard enough.
Why don't you try it again?

30
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,390
Oh, OK.

31
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,260
- Alex, what are you doing?
- The same thing I always do.

32
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,400
Entertaining myself when the
entertainment is not entertaining me.

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,900
Oh, my gosh! There's a
baby duck in my hand!

34
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,370
Where did this baby duck come from?

35
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,040
Wow, that is a great trick, Zeke.

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,150
Zeke, thank you so much for this duck.

37
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,950
I can't wait to raise it and sell its milk.

38
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,990
Justin, how did I do that?

39
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,120
I don't know, but a good magician

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,430
never reveals his secrets.

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,440
Alex, you practically
exposed magic to Zeke.

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,740
Do you know what that's gonna do
to us in the wizard competition?

43
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,740
It wasn't that big of a deal.

44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,240
If he starts asking questions,
I am not covering for you.

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,350
Well, I cover for you all the time.

46
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,950
When people say you're uptight, I say,

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,480
"Oh, you should try
living with him."

48
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,860
Look, Alex, Justin's right.

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,720
You always use magic
for your own amusement,

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,030
and then we have to cover for you.

51
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,760
But, did you see how happy Zeke was

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,700
when he thought he pulled off that trick?

53
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,000
I do wuv that wittle ducky.

54
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Oh, I'm gonna go make him a chicken outfit.

55
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,850

71
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,260
Hey, Zeke.

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,830
Listen, I've got a little
proposition for you.

73
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,000
You ever considered a career
as a professional magician?

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,670
'Cause I want to be in
the Zeke Beekerman business.

75
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,380
Yeah, it's always been
a dream of mine, but...

76
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,910
I've also wanted to be a masked wrestler.

77
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,250
But that's never gonna happen.

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,520
Well, let me tell ya, as a magician,

79
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,050
you are a true talent.

80
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,690
Now here's what

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,890
I'm gonna be your manager.

82
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,890
Do you have an awesome magician
name we can work off of?

83
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,530
No, I don't.
I'm still trying

84
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,300
to figure out how I did that trick.

85
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,100
Zeke, your eyes are on the wrong thing.

86
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,540
You gotta think big.
From now on,

87
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,810
you're gonna be called
the Amazing Zeke-ini.

88
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,280
That sounds
like "zucchini."

89
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,380
I love it. Even better.
"The Amazing Zucchini."

90
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,980
Do you see what I've already done for you?

91
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,750
Something amazing's going on here.

92
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,050
And I think I know what it is.

93
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,620
Harper, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,470
All right.

95
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
Don't freak out,

96
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,680
but when I did that magic trick
with Max's money,

97
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,310
everything is not what it seemed.

98
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,710
What do you mean?

99
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,010
Harper, do you believe in
the existence of wizards?

100
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,680
- Wizards?
- Shh!

101
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,950
Because, after what I saw
today, I know they exist.

102
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,490
What?! No, that's crazy.
Alex is not a wizard!

103
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,460
Of course Alex isn't a wizard.

104
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,060
I am.

105
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,970
Excuse me?

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,500
How else could I have
conjured up that baby duck?

107
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,170
I totally have magical wizard powers.

108
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,510
Unless you have a better explanation.

109
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,210
Um, uh... Maybe you were
making scrambled eggs,

110
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,150
and you cracked one, and you didn't see

111
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,680
that there was a baby duck inside it,

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,920
and it got stuck
between your fingers, and...

113
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,550
You're a wizard.

114
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,090
Listen, don't tell anyone else about this.

115
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,030
We don't know how the rest
of the world might react

116
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,230
- to someone as powerful as me.
- Oh, I won't tell anybody.

117
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,230
You're the best, Harper Finkle.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,570
Gosh, it finally feels so good

119
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,040
to understand why I've
never fit in on this planet.

120
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,210
Whoo! Yeah!

121
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,180
I am not a normal person!

122
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,250
Whoo! Maybe later.
Great! Whoo!

123
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,100
Nice job, Alex.

124
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,630
Thanks to you I had to lie to Zeke's face,

125
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,940
'cause he thinks he's a wizard.

126
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,900
Oh, my gosh.

127
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,740
Could you imagine Zeke as a wizard?

128
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,110
That'd be hilarious. "Oh no,
I messed up the spell.

129
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,540
I turned my legs into licorice.

130
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,410
There's another reason I
can't wear shorts!" Waa!

131
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,950
Justin's right.
You took it too far this time.

132
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,520
What is the big deal?

133
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,750
The big deal is that
it's already bad enough

134
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,250
that I have to keep a secret
from my boyfriend,

135
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,190
but now I'm straight-up
lying to him, too?

136
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,790
You have to tell him the truth, Alex.

137
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,630
I can't tell him the truth, Harper.

138
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,930
That would be exposing wizardry.

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,900
- Well then, fine, I'll do it.
- You can't do that.

140
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,430
That could get me kicked out of
the wizard competition for good.

141
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,270
I know you're wizards,
and I'm keeping the secret.

142
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
- Zeke will, too.
- How?

143
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,470
Zeke says everything
that pops into his head.

144
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,110
Have you heard the kid go down the stairs?

145
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,080
Step, step,
step, step. Waa!

146
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,420
That is only when there's no handrail.

147
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,150
Harper, if you tell him the truth,

148
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,450
that would be crossing the line.

149
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,450
I don't think I could
ever forgive you for that.

150
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,090
Look, just... Don't worry.

151
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,030
- I'll handle it.
- Fine.

152
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,330
Until then, I'll just keep
lying to the ones I love.

153
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,830
Oh, hey, your hair looks
super good today, Alex.

154
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,100
- Thank you.
- Oh, I lied again. Waa!

155
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,310
Hey, Justin, what are you doing?

156
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,350
- Just sweeping up.
- Yeah.

157
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,450
I remember when I had to use
a broom to sweep stuff up.

158
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,180
What are you talking about?

159
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,150
Nothing, nothing.
Shouldn't have said anything.

160
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,960
- OK.
- I wasn't going to tell you,

161
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,960
but you're pulling it
out of me. OK.

162
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,260
Remember when I did that magic trick today?

163
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,830
That was real magic.

164
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,730
I'm a... wizard.

165
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,370
I'm sorry.
Did you say wizard?

166
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,440
Keep it down, man!

167
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,610
I know this may be hard for you
to process as a man of science,

168
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,280
but yes, I am definitely a wizard.

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,050
Sorry, Justin, looks like
I'm the cool one now.

170
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,790
Zeke, I'm pretty sure wizards don't exist.

171
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,200
Zeke, big news.
I got you your first gig.

172
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,900
What do you think about
performing in Las Vegas?

173
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,800
- I love it!
- Yeah?

174
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,570
Well, maybe with some luck and a better
manager, you'll be there one day.

175
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,370
But, for now, it's gonna be
a kid's birthday party.

176
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,910
We're gonna do it right here
in the Sub Station.

177
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,440
One second.
Go for Max.

178
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,510
Can you believe that?

179
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,680
A magic show with a real wizard.

180
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,850
This is gonna be the greatest show ever.

181
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,560
Excuse me for a minute, Zeke.
I gotta go talk to Alex.

182
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,420
Hey, hey. Don't tell her
I'm a wizard.

183
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,030
She seems like the kind of person

184
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,890
who might take advantage of magic.

185
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,760
Hey, that's my sister you're talking about.

186
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
And you are absolutely right.

187
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,600
Have you seen the cover
to the tomato sauce?

188
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,900
Oh, so you want me to cover for you again?

189
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,770
Guess what, Alex?

190
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,840
Zeke is gonna do a magic show
in front of a bunch of people.

191
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,450
Oh, he's terrible. So that
means it's gonna be hilarious.

192
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,720
I know he's terrible,
you know he's terrible.

193
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,720
But Zeke?
He doesn't know he's terrible.

194
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,590
He thinks he's a wizard.

195
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,520
- Oh, so he told you, too?
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,590
Oh, but don't worry about it, Justin,

197
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,430
because Alex says she's gonna handle it.

198
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,030
- Ooh!
- I am, OK?

199
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,100
I totally have a plan to fix this.

200
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,800
Great. What is it?

201
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,240
Are you ready, because
you're gonna love this.

202
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,810
You are stalling.
She's stalling.

203
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,980
I am gonna wait for Zeke to realize

204
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,280
that he's not a wizard
when his magic act fails.

205
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,880
And it'll be hilarious for all of us.

206
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,550
Yeah, that should work.
It's pretty good.

207
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,320
Wait, so your plan is to let my boyfriend

208
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,020
humiliate himself?
I can't let that happen.

209
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,030
Zeke, honey, are you sure
you want to do a magic show?

210
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,500
It may not turn out like you think.

211
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,800
Of course I want to do it.
I'm great at magic.

212
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,440
It's almost as if I were a real wizard.

213
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,280
I think I'm with Harper on this one, Zeke.

214
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,680
I, uh... I don't think you
should go through with it.

215
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,780
What? Why aren't you guys
supporting me on this?

216
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,950
I mean, I understand Justin.
I'm just cooler than you.

217
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,090
But, Harper, you're my girlfriend.

218
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,590
I know. I just... I don't
think it's a good idea.

219
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,690
I finally find my true calling,

220
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,860
and you guys are trying
to talk me out of it?

221
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,260
I don't get it. I thought we had
a better relationship than this.

222
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,170
This isn't about our relationship, Zeke.

223
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,640
Well, then, what's it about?

224
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,370
I can't tell you.

225
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,840
You're keeping secrets from me?

226
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,510
- We don't do that.
- I know we don't.

227
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,450
- So tell me.
- I can't.

228
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,980
Well, if you can't tell me,
Harper Finkle, then...

229
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,250
I have to break up with you.

230
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,990
I hope you're happy, Alex.
I kept your secret.

231
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,770
Is this as hilarious
as you thought it'd be?

232
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,600
Harper.

233
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,270
Have you been up all night knitting this?

234
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,470
I'm not talking to you!

235
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,640
Harper, I didn't think Zeke
would break up with you.

236
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,220
I feel so bad. Look, I'm
gonna take care of this.

237
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,130
- Bad!
- What?

238
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,200
That's what you said
before, and look what happened.

239
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,900
Stop taking care of it!

240
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,680
Hello, everybody.
Thank you for coming today.

241
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,610
I'd like to wish a very happy
birthday to little Mickey Scudamore.

242
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,590
And now, I present to you,
the Amazing Zucchini!

243
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,290
Zeke, get out of the trunk!

244
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,300
Uh...

245
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,370
Sorry, the Amazing Zucchini
was in the bathroom.

246
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,670
You started early.

247
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,840
The Amazing Zucchini, everybody!

248
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,120
Thank you. Thank you.

249
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,750
Tonight, you will see
an amazing world of magic.

250
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,360
- Magic, magic.
- Magic, magic, magic.

251
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,620
All right!

252
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,330
Justin, have you seen Harper?

253
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,530
She's upstairs bawling her eyes out.

254
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,200
I really messed up this time.

255
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,700
You think?

256
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,600
Thanks for telling me.
I had no clue.

257
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,300
We need to do something.

258
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,710
I think that we should tell Zeke the truth.

259
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,440
Alex, we cannot tell Zeke.

260
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,040
That'd be breaking
the number one wizard rule.

261
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,580
I know, I know.

262
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,110
And there's a reason
that Max is in the lead.

263
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,650
- We cannot tell Zeke.
- You're right.

264
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,980
That's why we are so far behind...

265
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,980
OK, I get it!

266
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,450
Great, Mickey!

267
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,790
Hey! That guy
just tore up my money.

268
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,130
That 20's coming off of the bill.

269
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,660
Not to worry. I am
the Amazing Zucchini.

270
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,030
And I'm his assistant, Pickle.

271
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,040
- We didn't discuss this.
- You're right, you're right.

272
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,410
The Amazing Pickle.

273
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,110
Hey, Zeke? I have
something to tell you.

274
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,010
- Gosh, she's gonna tell him.
- We have to do something.

275
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,510
Zeke, listen, there's something...

276
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,620
I'm busy, Harper.
Get out of here.

277
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,590
Whoa, what a trick, huh, folks?

278
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,120
Zucchini and Pickle are incredible!

279
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,830
That's right. I did it.
It's coming from my hands.

280
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,270
That's where the power is!
All right!

281
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,470
Yeah! Whoo!

282
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,410
How did... Alex!

283
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,310
Hi, Gordon.

284
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,320
See you in P.E.!

285
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,320
And now, the Amazing Zucchini

286
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,490
will perform his greatest trick.

287
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm gonna saw Pickle in half!

288
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,560
- Oh, no.
- The saw is real.

289
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,230
Zeke, this one is too dangerous.
Put the saw down.

290
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,570
Aw, come on. This is
his greatest trick.

291
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,410
It's fine, Justin.
I got this.

292
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,740
Guys, calm down.
It's all an illusion.

293
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,040
He's a great magician.

294
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,210
No, he's not.
The saw is real.

295
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,380
I used magic to fake
Zeke's trick yesterday.

296
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,580
Now he thinks he's a wizard
with magical powers.

297
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,350
Then get me out of this thing

298
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,020
before that caped freak saws me in two!

299
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,420
Saw him, saw him!

300
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,460
You still don't want to use magic?

301
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,830
Chancy meat, schmancy treat,
fancy feet is now complete.

302
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,110
I cut him in half without using the saw.

303
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,980
Aw, somebody catch my feet!

304
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,350
Whoa, I've never seen this before.

305
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,390
Good one!

306
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,790
Don't worry, I'll get it.

307
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,560
I can't believe you
flashed me back to school.

308
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,370
You were going to tell Zeke.

309
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,270
What kind of a friend are you?

310
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,900
Look, Harper, I want to
tell Zeke too, but I can't!

311
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,870
We can't. You're just
gonna have to accept that!

312
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,380
I can't accept that because
it's ruining my life!

313
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,480
Everybody, calm down.

314
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,280
Stop! Oh, no!
I'm out of control.

315
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,190
I've frozen the entire world forever.

316
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,090
I feel so alone.

317
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
Zeke.

318
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,130
You're not frozen?
I am losing my mind!

319
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,290
Zeke, listen to me, OK?

320
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,300
You are not a wizard.
I am.

321
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,000
This is no time for jokes, Justin.

322
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,640
I froze the entire world!

323
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,640
Oh, what kind of monster am I?!

324
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,110
Zeke, you did not do
any of this, OK? I did.

325
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,640
I am a wizard.

326
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,750
- I even have a wand.
- This cheap-looking stick

327
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,350
that's always sticking
out of your back pocket?

328
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,390
Justin, why are you lying to me?

329
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,460
- I'm the real wizard.
- Really?

330
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,460
Yeah, I'm the one who made
the baby duck appear,

331
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,330
I'm the one who made my
ex-girlfriend disappear,

332
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,970
and if you hadn't noticed,
everyone is frozen.

333
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,040
Where are we?!
What just happened?

334
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,970
Zeke, Zeke, calm down.

335
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,440
Why is this window all lopsided?

336
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,150
You have a closet of fog!

337
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,750
Calm down!

338
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,680
And gargoyles wearing sunglasses, man!

339
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,220
And what is going on?!

340
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,190
Zeke...

341
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,360
Oh, my gosh.

342
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,030
- You're a wizard.
- Yes.

343
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,060
Don't hurt me, wizard freak.

344
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,900
Zeke, no one is gonna hurt you, OK?

345
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,670
I am here for you.
I am still your best friend.

346
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,970
- Really?
- Yes.

347
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,140
Oh...
It all makes sense now.

348
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,280
That's why you and Alex showed up

349
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,910
in <i>Night of the Halloween</i>
<i>Sorority Party Disaster 2,</i>

350
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,780
when you weren't even in <i>Night of the
Halloween</i> <i>Sorority Party Disaster 1!</i>

351
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,990
And that's why I saw
that dog turn into a werewolf.

352
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,530
It was Mason! Whoa!

353
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,830
- OK, let's take a seat.
- Oh! Whoa!

354
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,570
Let's let it all
settle in. OK.

355
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,070
Now that you know, you cannot tell anyone.

356
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,200
Alex and Max are also wizards.

357
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,610
The only other people who know
are my parents and Harper.

358
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,840
- Harper?
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,750
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, what have I done?

360
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,150
That's the only reason she
didn't want me to do magic.

361
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,980
She didn't want me
to make a fool of myself.

362
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,620
Oh. I should have never
broken up with her.

363
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:02,820
- You should tell her that.
- You're right. I will.

364
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,560
How far are we from the sub shop?

365
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,430
I don't have any cab fare either, so...

366
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,830
We're, uh...
closer than you think.

367
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,140
Man, your weird magic laboratory

368
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,450
really is in your vegetable cooler.

369
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,780
Man, I should have known.

370
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,620
Your family spends a lot of time in there.

371
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,920
I think it's time to get
this party re-started.

372
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
You OK?

373
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,090
OK? This is the
best day of my life.

374
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,800
Gosh, I just learned
my best friend is a wizard.

375
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,330
- Let's do it, Justini!
- Don't call me that.

376
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,770
Let's move this party along.
Time to cut the cake.

377
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,470
You just made that cake
appear out of nowhere!

378
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,180
Is it chocolate?

379
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,750
- Now it is.
- Oh, ho! Sweet.

380
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,510
All right. Tick tock.
Time was stopped.

381
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,850
Bang the gong.
Time moves on.

382
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,050
Hey, everybody!
Who's ready for some cake?

383
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,520
Right over there.

384
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,830
Hey, legs.

385
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,030
Get us a corner piece
with lots of frosting. Go.

386
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,970
I'm not gonna argue with you anymore, OK?

387
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,840
Justin will not let me, let you
tell Zeke that we're wizards.

388
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,500
I just told Zeke we're wizards.

389
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,810
What?!

390
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,040
The secret was coming
in-between everyone.

391
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,080
I made the decision, I will
accept the consequences.

392
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,520
Don't worry, I will never
tell anyone, I swear.

393
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,120
You better swear, because if you do,

394
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,220
you will live the rest of your
life in our closet of fog.

395
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,400
We have a closet of fog?
I want to see that.

396
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,670
Harper, I am so sorry I was
such a jerk to you before.

397
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,170
I guess all that fake magic power

398
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,370
really went to my head.

399
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,910
I hope you'll take me back.

400
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,240
Of course I'll take you back, Zeke.

401
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,110
I missed you so much.
Come here.

402
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,720
Can I just apologize, too, Harper?

403
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,950
- You don't need to.
- Yes, I do.

404
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,790
I was careless with magic,

405
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,790
and I put you in a really tough spot.

406
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,030
- And I'm sorry.
- And I'm sorry I said

407
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,930
I don't care about the wizard competition.

408
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,100
I do.

409
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,330
There's a wizard competition?

410
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,770
OK, OK. Who do you guys
think would win in a brawl?

411
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,200
Wizards, aliens, or sharks with
lasers attached to their heads?

412
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,770
Oh, do you guys need
batteries for your wands,

413
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,610
or you just like zap it
and it comes to life,

414
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,280
and you're just like,
"Give me my wand!" Ha, ha!

415
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,610
This is no longer cute,
put his voice on mute.

416
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,720
Thank you.

417
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,650
What's this
pen-like thing do?

418
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,380
It's a pen. It writes.

419
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,820
Awesome!

420
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,320
I've never seen anything
like these desks before.

421
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Yes, you have.
I got them at the Desk Barn.

422
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,060
You were there.
You picked them out.

423
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,360
Magical knickknacks!

424
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,230
Yes!

425
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,230
Maybe we should ease Zeke into the magic.

426
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,700
He still has a hard time
with the ordinary things.

427
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,540
What?!
A magical comfy chair!

428
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,340
Oh, let me try it,
let me try it, let me try it.

429
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,310
Oh, my gosh.
It really is magical.

430
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,550
It's... It's comfy!

431
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,450
What?!

432
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,850
