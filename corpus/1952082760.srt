00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,479
Good evening,
and welcome to <i>The Culpeper Minute.</i>

2
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,007
It's been nearly
a decade...

3
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,857
...since the best-selling autobiography
<i>Under the Hood...</i>

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,226
...revealed secrets of the original band
of masked adventurers...

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,390
...the new Minutemen.

6
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,932
In 1975, when <i>The Culpeper Minute</i>
was new to the airwaves...

7
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,971
...we profiled the author of
<i>Under the Hood,</i> Hollis Mason...

8
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,837
...the former adventurer
known as Nite Owl.

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,743
When my original report aired in 1975,
the Keene Act had not yet been passed.

10
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,079
Now, this controversial bill outlawed all
costumed adventurers and masked heroes.

11
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,521
Given our current climate of unrest
around the subject of masked justice...

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,524
...we thought it would be interesting
to revisit that original episode...

13
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,254
...as a reminder of where
the whole phenomena...

14
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,922
...of costumed heroics began.

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,634
Tonight we're talking with Hollis Mason
about his autobiography, <i>Under the Hood.</i>

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,540
Hollis Mason's memoirs
revealed some of the secrets...

17
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,043
...of the masked adventurers.

18
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:27,080
I met with Hollis at one of his favorite
New York establishments, the Gunga Diner.

19
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,715
Coming to New York at 12 years old...

20
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:36,453
...it was, uh, fantastic for me
in a lot of ways.

21
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,564
And my dad got a job
at Vernon's Auto Repair off 7th Avenue.

22
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,064
- Now Mason's, right?
- Now Mason's. Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,563
Same place.

24
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,106
CULPEPER: Yet you didn't follow in your
father's footsteps. You chose another path.

25
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,369
MASON:
Well, yeah, when I was 23...

26
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,240
...I joined the New York City
Police Department.

27
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,045
And I think that that had a lot to do
with my grandfather...

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,087
...and the values
that he'd instilled in me.

29
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:07,056
Because for the first 12 years of my life,
I spent a lot of time with my granddad.

30
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,219
He was always keen to impress upon me...

31
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:16,926
...that country folk were morally healthier
than city folk, the way they lived.

32
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,561
Of course you were competitive
in certain ways, but you were also...

33
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,900
You helped each other.

34
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,806
And it was kind of a moral value
that stuck with me.

35
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,641
And when I first got to the city...

36
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:34,219
...there were things I saw
that really filled me with disgust...

37
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:39,222
...that I found a hard time shaking,
and, you know, some really...

38
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,991
Some of it I still can't.

39
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,299
What my grandfather gave me...

40
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,240
...and what I was confronted with
in the city...

41
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:03,314
When the distance between those things
got too great and I couldn't deal with it...

42
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:08,716
...then I would go to my real other world,
the world of pulp-fiction novels.

43
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,417
They described a world
of absolute values...

44
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,529
...where what was good and true
was never in doubt.

45
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,562
And evil was...

46
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,327
Well, it received
its appropriate punishment.

47
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,630
Is that how you've led your life, then?

48
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:29,172
- That's what I've tried to do. Um...
- Mm-hm.

49
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,840
Yeah.

50
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,536
Hollis Mason, idealizing young cop...

51
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,512
...trying to make sense
of granddad's country values...

52
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,551
...and the grit of the big city
he finds himself living in.

53
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,350
Soon enough, the police force and its brand
of justice is not enough for young Mason.

54
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,552
Long a fan of pulp detective fiction
and comic-book heroics...

55
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,254
...Mason did what others
only fantasize about.

56
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,899
He made himself a disguise...

57
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,831
...and set out in the nights
as a vigilante...

58
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,528
...doling out justice on his own terms.

59
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,267
What influenced this shift
in Mason's behavior?

60
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,809
It's funny when you think about it.

61
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,042
You know, I've heard all the...

62
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,448
All the jokes and all the rumors
and all the innuendos.

63
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,418
What it really comes down to for me...

64
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,287
...is that I dressed up like an owl
and I fought crime...

65
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,220
...because it was fun.

66
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,266
And because it was the right thing to do.

67
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,898
And because I darn well enjoyed it.

68
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,869
[MASON CHUCKLES]

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,977
I suppose it really started
to take shape for me in 1938.

70
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:44,845
And on my beat there were a lot of kids
reading that first issue of <i>Action Comics.</i>

71
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,213
I was so drawn, I couldn't help it.

72
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,447
I asked one of the kids if I could
borrow it and take a look at it.

73
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,184
And that first issue
of <i>Superman...</i>

74
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,323
...wow, knocked me out.
- Mm-hm.

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,230
Okay, Superman was your biggest
influence, and it was to a lot of kids.

76
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,768
But you took it even further.

77
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,464
MASON: Well, it all changed
when I opened the newspaper one day...

78
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:14,602
...and I saw that these characters had
escaped from their four-color world...

79
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:21,084
...and they were now in the factual
black-and-white world of the headlines.

80
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,458
An attempted assault and robbery
was thwarted by a figure...

81
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,755
...who supposedly dropped into
the alleyway from above...

82
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,693
...with something over his face.

83
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,198
And he then proceeded
to disarm the three attackers...

84
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,396
...and beat them with such severity
that all three were hospitalized.

85
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:44,634
The newspapers started calling him
Hooded Justice.

86
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:49,407
And that was the first masked vigilante.

87
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,775
And when I heard that story
I made up my mind right then...

88
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,616
...I was gonna be the second.

89
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,021
We have to take a break for our sponsors
now, but when we come back...

90
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,494
...more from our 1975 story
on masked adventurers.

91
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,824
Thank you for staying with us.

92
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,196
We return now to our retrospective look
at <i>Under the Hood...</i>

93
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,395
...and what these men and women
mean to us today.

94
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,465
CULPEPER: Why did you come up
with the owl costume?

95
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,543
MASON:
It really came together...

96
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,648
...because of another cop that I was
working with in my station house.

97
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,013
And he kept asking me
to go out for a beer after work.

98
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:04,054
And I kept saying no, because, you know,
I wanted to train at night...

99
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,214
...and get ready for my other career.

100
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,054
And then he started
calling me "night owl."

101
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,061
- You know, he was being sarcastic.
- Right.

102
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:16,691
And I loved it.
I thought, "Well, that's it, Nite Owl."

103
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,531
- So that's where the name came from?
- That's where it came from.

104
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,004
So once I had the name, then I could
start thinking about the costume.

105
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:27,806
Should it have a cape or no cape?
Should you have a mask or no mask?

106
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,676
Eventually, I just boiled it down
to the basics.

107
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,841
I needed a costume
where I was free to move.

108
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,681
I needed to protect my body.
I needed to protect my head.

109
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,415
And I needed to protect my identity.

110
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:43,756
So I did this with a tunic
that was covered in leather and mail...

111
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,397
...a kind of steel mesh.

112
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:50,525
And I had a hood with...
It was leather and steel mesh again.

113
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,503
And then briefs.
They were covered in the same mail.

114
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,110
So I've got my hair covered
and all I need is a little mask.

115
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,745
So I did it with this. This is the mask.

116
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:04,440
I attached this mask with a spirit gum...

117
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,485
...which is what actors use
to put on mustaches and beards.

118
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,646
CULPEPER: It turned out, there were
several masked adventurers at the time.

119
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,418
MASON: Yeah, about a month
after I made my debut...

120
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:20,260
...the headlines were all about
a young woman called the Silhouette.

121
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:25,461
She had exposed a crooked publisher
who was dealing in child pornography.

122
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:32,134
And she gave him such a brutal beating.
Him and his two cameramen, right?

123
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,871
Well, that was quite a story.

124
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,377
From there it grew pretty quickly.

125
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,025
There were stories
of a man dressed like a moth...

126
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,219
...who could glide through the air.

127
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:58,167
And then there was a story of a man
in a yellow boiler suit...

128
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:02,865
...who was particularly brutal
and vicious.

129
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:08,539
In 12 months of Hooded Justice's
dramatic entrance...

130
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,445
...there were at least, oh,
seven other costumed vigilantes.

131
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,917
There was Sally Jupiter,
who took the name of Silk Spectre.

132
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,215
There was Dollar Bill,
there was Mothman...

133
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,689
...there was the Silhouette,
there was Comedian.

134
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,953
And, of course, there was me.

135
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,664
Little that Mason told me
was not already in his book.

136
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:31,667
So I turned to some of the other figures
from his world to find out more.

137
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,932
She used her sexuality to fight crime...

138
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:39,509
...and her crime fighting
to pursue a career on the silver screen.

139
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,341
Now her daughter lives on in her image...

140
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,484
...and life seemingly
has passed Sally Jupiter by.

141
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:50,182
We joined her at her home
for the following exchange back in 1975.

142
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,755
CULPEPER:
Why the name Silk Spectre?

143
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,155
JUPITER:
You know, it's funny.

144
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,231
Many people have hypothesized about
reasons why that might have come up.

145
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,960
And in truth,
I wanted to find something mysterious...

146
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,104
...something that had a good ring to it,
you know?

147
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,766
And I felt that she should be somebody
who could slip out of your hands.

148
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,106
Silk stockings, you know,
were very expensive at the time.

149
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,011
And it just had a good ring to it,
I guess, is all I can really say.

150
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,245
What were your motivations
in becoming a masked adventurer?

151
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,946
I saw Hooded Justice...

152
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,651
...and I think the idea of doing
something that was out of the normal...

153
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,523
I never felt like I really fit in.

154
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:35,633
And I think that becoming Silk Spectre
really made me feel actually more at home.

155
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:41,697
Now, Silk Spectre is presented in fairly
racy imagery in posters and in comics.

156
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:46,573
How do you deal with these,
what I call, visually degrading pictures?

157
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,647
Oh, I never had a problem
with that sort of thing.

158
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,444
I mean, you know, they always
referred to me as a sex symbol.

159
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,951
And I have to say,
I'd rather be a symbol of that...

160
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,057
...than a symbol for other things
they've got symbols of.

161
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,715
You know what I mean?

162
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,294
Jimmy Fantucci, a famous mobster,
I'm sure you've heard of him.

163
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:08,092
He actually turned himself into the cops
because he couldn't shoot me.

164
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:12,465
You know, as I said, I never shied away
from the way that I looked.

165
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,731
And, in fact, it seemed in this case,
I could use it.

166
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,775
Masked adventurers or whatever what you
wanna call them is all about commerce.

167
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:23,381
You have to remember that this country
was founded on entertainment.

168
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,347
And when I managed Sally,
the Silk Spectre...

169
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,219
...we used her status as a costumed hero
to make lucrative deals of every kind.

170
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,851
Movie deals, image licensing for pinups,
comic books, everything.

171
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,295
It was a business strategy that corporations
picked up on almost immediately.

172
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,163
Dollar Bill was originally
a star college athlete from Kansas...

173
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,133
...hired by a major department store...

174
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,865
...when they realized
that having their own superhero...

175
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,135
...was an interesting publicity prospect.

176
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,747
Still, I like to think that Sally and I
pioneered the concept.

177
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,146
When you're trying to make a mark
in the world, you need help.

178
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:03,118
You need someone
who can be sort of the cohesive factor...

179
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,055
...in bringing the awareness to the public,
and he definitely did that.

180
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,957
And I think, in fact, probably at the
expense of many people's agendas, really.

181
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,257
I don't think you can make
value judgments...

182
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,869
...on whether or not costumed heroes
are good or bad for society.

183
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,870
That's like asking
if television is good or bad.

184
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,871
The answer is that it's both.

185
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:27,069
It was only really
when we got together...

186
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,515
...that the problems started.

187
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,845
The Minutemen, yeah.

188
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,350
What a great idea.

189
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,924
I wish I can take credit for it,
but I can't in good conscience.

190
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:45,189
The way it happened was one day I got
a letter for Sally from Captain Metropolis.

191
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,696
He said he wanted to get together
to discuss the idea...

192
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,267
...of forming a group
of masked adventurers.

193
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,236
At first, I thought he was using the idea
as a means to get her into bed.

194
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,271
Then I did a little research...

195
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,673
...and I learned that my concerns...

196
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,542
...were, yeah, unfounded...

197
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,844
...if you get my meaning.

198
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,577
Lawrence made the Minutemen.

199
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,747
If it wasn't for him
and his knack for publicity...

200
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,884
I mean I think as someone in your
profession, you could probably understand...

201
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,623
...that if we did this interview and no one
saw it, then, poof, it doesn't matter.

202
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,564
SHEXNAYDER: I realized
that without the occasional gimmick...

203
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,068
...to revitalize flagging public interest...

204
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,900
...the fad of costumed heroes...

205
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,804
...would eventually fade,
even the ones dressed like Sally.

206
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,640
After some consideration I suggested
they take a large ad out in the <i>Gazette...</i>

207
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,648
...asking for more mystery men
to come forward.

208
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,276
And that's how
the Minutemen came to be.

209
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,923
CULPEPER:
Now, when you first met The Comedian...

210
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,149
...Nite Owl, Silhouette and the others...

211
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,727
...what were your thoughts?
Were you intimidated?

212
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,523
Was there a sense of relief?

213
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,498
Oh, it was an incredibly
exhilarating time, I have to say.

214
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,832
I think we all felt like
we were part of a family...

215
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,803
...that we had found sort of a place...

216
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,603
...where we could feel like
we actually were of value.

217
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,269
Everyone brought
something different to the Minutemen.

218
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,814
But somehow when we were together
there was a bonding feeling...

219
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,384
...that we all believed
in what we were doing.

220
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:18,614
Now, the reason I say "relief" is because
many of the people back in those days...

221
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,591
...thought that you were all
rather bizarre, abnormal individuals...

222
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,662
...running around in children's costumes.

223
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,162
JUPITER:
We were just people.

224
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,268
And everyone did have absolutely
different politics.

225
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,132
Some of us were in it for fame.
Some for power.

226
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,264
Some to possibly hide
from the rest of the world.

227
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,436
But in the end of the day, our politics
really didn't get in the way too much...

228
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,310
...of what we wanted to be there to do,
which was good.

229
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:49,352
We did too much good in our respective
communities just to be written off.

230
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,422
We were all attempting
through our personal efforts...

231
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:57,722
...to make our country
a better and a safer place to live.

232
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,094
Clearly, Hollis Mason is a man
who makes no apologies...

233
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,827
...for the life he's lived
or the decisions he's made.

234
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,439
But is his own personal moral code
enough justification...

235
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,803
...for donning a mask
and dispensing vigilante justice?

236
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,968
I went out and asked around
to get a better sense...

237
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,707
...of how you, the people,
felt about masked heroes.

238
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,717
MAN 1:
I don't know.

239
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,756
I get a lot of customers that are cops.

240
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,361
Guys that come by and pay
for a pack of smokes from me...

241
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,124
...and they tell me
that these masked adventurers...

242
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,928
...they're making the job more difficult.

243
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,065
MAN 2:
What do I think of them?

244
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,799
They've just about destroyed my business,
I can tell you that.

245
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,441
They maim my customers.

246
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:52,083
They like to break fingers. They think
it's funny. Yeah. They're dangerous.

247
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,180
But then on the other hand,
what if we hadn't had...

248
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,187
...that Dr. Manhattan guy
on our side, huh?

249
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,849
I mean, I know it's inconceivable to us,
now knowing what we know...

250
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,619
...but who's to say that things wouldn't
have gone the same in Vietnam...

251
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,163
...without them?

252
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,028
Losing that war.

253
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,793
That would've destroyed our country.

254
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,338
More on costumed adventurers
and the controversy surrounding them...

255
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,237
...after this word from our sponsors.

256
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,411
ANNOUNCER: <i>Seiko announces</i>
<i>the world's first digital quartz...</i>

257
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,878
<i>... liquid crystal chronograph.</i>

258
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,641
<i>It gives the time, the date...</i>

259
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,446
<i>... and with a push of a button,</i>
<i>turns into a stopwatch...</i>

260
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,716
<i>... that records lap times and</i>
<i>one-two finishes in tenths of seconds.</i>

261
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:37,555
<i>The time of day, kept in electronic memory,</i>
<i>reappears when you push the button again.</i>

262
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,823
<i>The Seiko liquid crystal chronograph.</i>

263
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,264
<i>Only one of Seiko's</i>
<i>superb digital quartz watches.</i>

264
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,210
Welcome back,
and thank you for watching.

265
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:57,111
In our current climate, the relevance
of masked adventurers, the Watchmen...

266
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,375
...is more in question than ever before.

267
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,815
We continue now
with our look back at a show...

268
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,046
...in which we discussed
<i>Under the Hood...</i>

269
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,887
...a memoir of original masked hero
The Nite Owl, née Hollis Mason.

270
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,258
A book which precipitated
many of the questions we have today...

271
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:17,391
...about these men and women who act
apart from our prescribed laws of justice.

272
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,678
Certainly there are many costumed heroes
who would make for fascinating study.

273
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,481
I spoke with psychiatrist William Long...

274
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,681
...to gain some professional insight.

275
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,486
You know, it's an interesting question.

276
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,555
Mostly, in the prison,
I work with criminals.

277
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,634
So my perception is slightly skewed.

278
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,169
I think certainly
there are masked heroes...

279
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,740
...and superhumans, like Dr. Manhattan...

280
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,935
...that just want to do good.

281
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,879
I think there are others
that are nothing more than criminals...

282
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,610
...who used this as a means...

283
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:12,086
...to justify their violent tendencies.

284
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:18,218
The only masked heroes
that pose an actual threat...

285
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,190
...are the relatively few
borderline sociopaths...

286
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,804
...that actually believe
that they are doing good.

287
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,837
Beneath that mask...

288
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,573
...they're just like you and me...

289
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:37,344
...with hopes and desires, fears...

290
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,848
...love.

291
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,254
I hope that one day...

292
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:48,416
...I can psychoanalyze
one of these masked heroes.

293
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,825
That would be something.

294
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,723
It seems a bygone era to us now.

295
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,231
The heady days of the roaring '40s.

296
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,632
People were eager for distraction,
hungry for a fix of drama.

297
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,968
What better than a group
of self-designed superheroes...

298
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,475
...to act out an exaggerated
street theater of crime fighting.

299
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,842
And in a world populated
by supervillains...

300
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,607
...why not?

301
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,684
There was the notorious
Moloch the Mystic...

302
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:20,155
...using the sideshow novelty of the magic
show to front his one-man wave of terror.

303
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,852
Later, of course, came modern
supervillains like Big Figure...

304
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:28,295
...the diminutive master criminal now
serving a life sentence in the city jail.

305
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,368
You think I'm the menace.

306
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,334
I'm not the one wearing a mask.
I got nothing to hide.

307
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,739
What kind of person is that?
Wear a mask?

308
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,220
I'm a respectable businessman.

309
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,524
CULPEPER:
It wasn't easy finding Moloch the Mystic.

310
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,161
But then again, well,
it wasn't too difficult.

311
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,390
You see, Moloch, like so many infamous
figures of our postwar past...

312
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,831
...had simply gone into civilian life.

313
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,336
MOLOCH:
I was a younger man then.

314
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,166
I was rebellious.

315
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,707
Like these gangs you see around,
the Knot Tops.

316
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,678
When you live in a world
with superhuman authority figures...

317
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,612
...and you wanna rebel,
you have to rebel on a larger scale.

318
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,186
You have to escalate things, you see.

319
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,152
So...

320
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,119
...if you grow up in a world
with superheroes and you wanna rebel...

321
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:33,287
...you have to become a supervillain.

322
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,970
So, yeah, I think society is better off
without the superheroes...

323
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:45,667
...because that means there's no need
for any supervillains either.

324
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,643
MASON:
Thank you. Thanks.

325
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:56,984
You know, it didn't last, oh, 10 years.

326
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:01,854
When the '50s came, the whole perception
of costumed adventurers...

327
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,928
...you know, changed, you know?

328
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,458
It was a fad, yeah.

329
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,261
And the fad was dying out
and we were dying with it.

[CHUCKLES]

331
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,529
Sally...

332
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,901
...well, she got pregnant
and she left.

333
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,707
The rest of us,
we were forced to testify...

334
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,279
...before the House Un-American
Activities Committee.

335
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,972
It was a witch hunt.

336
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,519
We were all forced to reveal
our identities...

337
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,088
...to one of its representatives.

338
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,158
I am Captain Metropolis
from the Minutemen.

339
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,227
MASON:
Now, luckily, with Captain Metropolis...

340
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,523
...having such an outstanding
military record...

341
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,791
...and with my own service
in the police force...

342
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,630
...we both were more or less
cleared of suspicion right away.

343
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:51,408
Mothman met with more difficulty,
mostly because of the left-wing friends...

344
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,943
...that he'd cultivated
during his student days.

345
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,808
Now, he's eventually cleared...

346
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:01,510
...but the investigations,
they were so lengthy and so ruthless...

347
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,349
...that I think that
the pressure he was under...

348
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,718
...it exacerbated his drinking problem...

349
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,919
...and it caused
his eventual mental breakdown.

350
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,331
Hooded Justice...

351
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,836
...refused to testify...

352
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,205
...on the grounds that he was not prepared
to reveal his true identity to anybody.

353
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,471
And when they pressed him...

354
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,911
...he disappeared.

355
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,714
And I really respect him for that.

356
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,253
He was the reason
I became the Nite Owl...

357
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:42,189
...and I don't know to this day
who he was behind that mask.

358
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,453
Isn't that something?

[CHUCKLES]

360
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,858
I understand that you wanted to leave
the Minutemen because you got pregnant.

361
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,059
Is that the reason?
Was there any other reasons...

362
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,228
...that you retired from the Minutemen?

363
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,601
JUPITER: You know,
sometimes it's just time to move on.

364
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,177
I think I would've stayed longer,
had I not gotten pregnant.

365
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:05,715
But it was... You know, life gives you those
little signs of when to take the door out.

366
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,818
And that seemed to be the one.

367
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:12,650
In his biography, Hollis alleged that you
were sexually assaulted by The Comedian.

368
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,122
Yet you've never said anything
about this.

369
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,084
Hmm.

370
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,194
Well, why should I break
a lifetime's habit now, right?

[CHUCKLES]

372
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:27,968
I can't blame you for asking
as a reporter, but, yes, it's...

373
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,164
No comment.

374
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:35,143
How much did the incident
between Sally Jupiter and The Comedian...

375
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,304
...affect your decision
to hang up the mask?

376
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,717
Well, that had lot to do with it, yeah.

377
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,489
I think once you realize
that some of your teammates...

378
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,286
...are just as depraved...

379
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:54,524
...and twisted as the criminals
you're going after...

380
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,929
Yeah.

381
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,098
That had a lot to do with why I quit.

382
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,332
There's no truth to that rumor.

383
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,271
If something like that had happened...

384
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:11,076
...don't you think I would have advised
Sally to have pressed criminal charges?

385
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,843
She was my best client.
My biggest earner.

386
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,446
I would never allow something like that
to go unpunished.

387
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,590
It's nothing more than sensationalism.

388
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,683
Self-promotion.

389
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,420

390

The Comedian declined to comment.

00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:31,135
Get that thing out of my face
before I put my cigar out in your eye.

You know, he's one of my customers,

394
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,266
I see him all the time.

395
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:44,241
It's funny about this superhero thing,
you know, it's a very fine line.

396
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,384
And when you got somebody
like the Nite Owl...

397
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:50,749
...who is your quintessential superhero,
because outside you get this guy...

398
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,447
...who dresses up
and does all the kaboom-kabang stuff...

399
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,389
...but inside he's a cop.

400
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,758
So he's a guy who knows what's true blue.
You know what I mean?

401
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,126
He's not into these
kind of artsy-fartsy things.

402
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,063
He's a great man.

403
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,002
So...

404
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,661
...I don't know.

405
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:13,744
Hard to say whether these masked-hero
types are a good or a bad thing...

406
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,143
...you know, in the final analysis.

407
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,478
It's interesting to note
that back in 1975...

408
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,587
...people were still very much divided
as to whether or not...

409
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:28,385
...the so-called costumed adventurers
were a benefit or a detriment to society.

410
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,721
Given the events
after this interview aired...

411
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:34,263
...perhaps Hollis Mason's retirement
came at the perfect time.

412
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:38,232

Continuing now with my interview
of Hollis Mason.

424
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,166
We're talking about
costumed adventurers.

425
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,104
He's been called
the Eighth Wonder of the World.

426
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,972
Our national treasure. Our greatest hope.

427
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,309
But Dr. Manhattan is also viewed
as a freak of nature.

428
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:29,977
His power is so great as to illicit fear
not only in our enemies but in ourselves.

429
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,318
Before he was the radiating blue
superbeing he is today...

430
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,222
...he was Jon Osterman,
physicist, son of a watchmaker.

431
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:42,094
A man with friendships,
loves, common family values.

432
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,633
One of his friends
and, in fact, colleagues...

433
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,397
...who continues to work
with Dr. Manhattan today...

434
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,166
...is an esteemed physicist
in his own right...

435
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,434
...Wally Weaver.

436
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,272
We went to Weaver's lab
and had the following conversation.

437
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,415
Well, I think...

438
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,846
...heroes of all kinds are a good thing.

439
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:04,455
And I'm talking about the brave men
and women of our Armed Forces.

440
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,252
I'm talking about the policemen
and the firefighters.

441
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:13,762
I'm talking about the scientists
and the doctors. And, uh...

442
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,999
Yeah, I'd include masked heroes...

443
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,636
...in that group
that's a benefit to society too.

444
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,362
Jon is...

445
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,066
I'm sorry. Dr. Manhattan...

446
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,705
...is something else entirely.

447
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:34,416
I'm writing a book about how he's changed
the geopolitical landscape forever...

448
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,817
...essentially making the very idea...

449
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,925
...of war obsolete.

450
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:49,225
MASON: You know, the first thing
was absolute disbelief.

451
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,995
Well, of course, as you know,
there was elation too.

452
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,697
I mean, it was like Santa Claus
was alive and thriving.

453
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,104
But the fear...

454
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,545
It was a terrible fear...

455
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,650
...and an uncertainty
that went right to your core.

456
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,218
I certainly understood
how an old car feels...

457
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,379
...when it sees a new car,
a new model come rolling out.

458
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,047
[CHUCKLES]

459
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,286
But it was more than that.

460
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:22,889
You know, I think I can boil the feeling
down to three words, really. It's:

461
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,195
We've been replaced.

462
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,634
And I don't just mean
the masked adventurers.

463
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,970
I mean, humanity.

464
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,811
We've been replaced.

465
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,348
Hollis always did have
a flair for the dramatic.

466
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,545
There is no doubt that it was
an absolute shock to all of us.

467
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,590
The fact that anything could exist
like Dr. Manhattan.

468
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,025
I mean, this was something
out of the realm of concept for us.

469
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:55,064
But we will always have a need
for humanity...

470
00:28:55,233 --> 00:29:00,728
...and as much as we expand
and grow technologically, it's...

471
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,032
We still need human contact, you know?

472
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,838
People have always misinterpreted
what I said about Jon.

473
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:12,839
I wasn't comparing him to God.
I wasn't saying he was a god.

474
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,609
I just...

475
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,120
Just wish I wouldn't have
ever said that.

476
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,789
Bottom line is this: Jon is still Jon.

477
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,361
At his core...

478
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,227
...he's still a man.

479
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:33,326
Well, take what I said about
supervillains being a direct response...

480
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,473
...to the appearance of superheroes...

481
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,007
...and apply that
to the current scenario.

482
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:43,204
If you have a being that can destroy...

483
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,939
...with a single thought...

484
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,346
...then the terrifying thing
is that there is...

485
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,786
...or there soon will be, a counterpoint
or an adversary to that being.

486
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:57,951
The universe has a way of finding
its own equilibrium, its own level.

487
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:05,063
What worries me is that Dr. Manhattan's
nemesis will be arriving soon.

488
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,232
Of course,
some of these masked adventurers...

489
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,970
...never stopped practicing
their unique craft.

490
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,082
Eventually time moved forward to a point
where their presence was again welcomed...

491
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,548
...and some would say sorely needed.

492
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,179
Big city streets
festered with violence...

493
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,516
...intimidation and rampant crime.

494
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,559
A perfect environment
for a new breed of masked hero to emerge.

495
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,992
Of course, I speak of the Watchmen.

496
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:37,695
Now, with the Cold War escalating
and the presence of a truly super being...

497
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,962
...at the forefront
of our national defense...

498
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:44,131
...a growing fear and restlessness
seems to permeate the population.

499
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,471
Only this time,
the fear is not of the criminals...

500
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,670
...but of the crime fighters themselves.

501
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,306
Senator Keene surely thinks
that the time has come to put an end...

502
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,883
...to masked adventuring.

503
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:59,717
His suggested new laws would effectively
clip the wings of these costumed heroes...

504
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,483
...making them hang up their masks...

505
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,561
...and preventing them from practicing
vigilante justice in our fair streets.

506
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,898
Senator Keene is an opportunistic...

507
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,100
...cipher.

508
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,796
He has no idea what he's talking about.

509
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,465
The real problem
are the police departments.

510
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:23,444
If they would take a little bit more
of what these masked heroes have...

511
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,516
...then we wouldn't need people
like Senator Keene...

512
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,151
...in the Senate in the first place.

513
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,183
What do I think about Senator Keene?

514
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,415
Listen, I work down here every day.

515
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,890
Whenever I'm in trouble, whenever
somebody's down here beating me up...

516
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,791
...and I yell for help, I don't care
who comes to save my butt.

517
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,422
I don't care if it's a superhero.
I don't care if it's a cop.

518
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,764
As long as somebody comes
when I'm yelling "help."

519
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,263
You understand?

520
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,634
People have...

521
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,275
...a need for...

522
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,435
...an everyday hero.

523
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,077
Masked or otherwise.

524
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,080
And, uh...

525
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,350
...people who know right from wrong...

526
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:10,187
...will always be in demand.

527
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:28,305
So I want to get a little personal here
for the moment.

528
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,003
You never married. Why is that?

529
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,810
- Um...
- Thank you.

530
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,514
Well, I suppose if there's any one reason
why I never got married...

531
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,215
...it was because...

532
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,193
...well, Sally Jupiter was taken.

533
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,332
I don't think...

534
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,491
...it's any great secret
that I had a thing for her.

535
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,830
Half the male population did.

536
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:58,169
By the time I'd rustled up the courage
to ask her out on a proper date...

537
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,868
...she was already married
to her manager.

538
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,107
[CHUCKLES]

539
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,814
It's kind of funny when you think of it.

540
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:12,384
I dress up as an owl
and risk my life on a daily basis...

541
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:16,825
...but when it came to
asking a girl out...

542
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,589
...it was more than I could manage.

543
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:24,131
Sadly, I think our marriage
was doomed from the start.

544
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:28,739
My professional position in Sally's life
made it very difficult to be a good husband.

545
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,737
It was my job as her manager...

546
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,241
...to not only accept the fact
that men were attracted to her...

547
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,846
...but to build on that attraction...

548
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,976
...to prey upon it.

549
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,385
Hollis was very important to you.

550
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,618
He was a very important person
in your life, correct?

551
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,819
Absolutely.

552
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,056
- You stay in contact with each other today?
- We do. We do.

553
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,531
Not as much as I would like, I must say.

554
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,000
You know, your life takes you
in different directions...

555
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,607
...but that was really a magical,
magical time...

556
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,267
...and we do like to talk about
the old times when we get together.

557
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,779
You know, I think...

558
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,648
I think I still have some kind of...

559
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,718
...half-baked idea that...

560
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:20,384
...Nite Owl and, uh...

561
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,223
...Silk Spectre are gonna end up
together one day.

562
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,969
Hm.

563
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,073
When we originally spoke
with Hollis Mason...

564
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,303
...he believed that the legacy
he'd begun as the Nite Owl...

565
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,880
...along with other members
of the masked-hero community...

566
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,108
...would live on for years to come.

567
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,721
He could not have known
how wrong he was.

568
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:58,552
This has been a nostalgic look back
at a colorful time in this nation's past...

569
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,789
...when we turned to flamboyant heroes
with cartoonish outfits...

570
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,331
...for our moral outlook.

571
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,901
In the post-Keene Act world
we now live in...

572
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,630
...the masked heroes
are as outdated and irrelevant...

573
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,674
...as the old beat-up wrecks
that Hollis Mason works on in his garage.

574
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,837
We hope that you have found this look back
at the history of costumed adventurers...

575
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,482
...both enlightening and informative.

576
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,517
I'm Larry Culpeper
for <i>The Culpeper Minute.</i>
