00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,212
<i> Five...</i>

2
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,714
<i> Four...</i>

3
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,317
<i> Three...</i>

4
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,486
<i> Two...</i>

5
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,588
<i> Olly olly oxen</i>
<i> free.</i>

6
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,129
Can I help you?

7
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:13,899
It's your brother
and his family, they're uh...

8
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,134
What?

9
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,963
Are you done yet?

10
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:25,998
No, sweetie.

11
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,455
Are you done now?

12
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,724
Soon, I promise.

13
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,400
You said this would be fun.

14
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,634
I know. I know.

15
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,844
You load the fridge downstairs?

16
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,446
Mmmhmm.

17
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,315
Did you?

18
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,349
I said yes.

19
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,721
Three, two, one.

20
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,779
Alright, go!

21
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,690
I'm so glad you two are
working things out.

22
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,425
He's so good with her.

23
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,394
Not too bad on the eyes,
either.

24
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,430
Yeah, he's a rock star when
he's not screwing his clients.

25
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,133
Joke.

26
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,474
Uh oh, almost!

27
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,576
Yay!

28
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,979
Candy!

29
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,714
It's all mine!

30
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,519
Can you take her, honey?

31
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm running late.

32
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,389
Come on, we talked about this.

33
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,423
About what?

34
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,760
Rough sakes.

35
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,496
What?

36
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,865
Jane, I got a jobs
at ten and two.

37
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,900
I've got an interview
with the "times".

38
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:48,707
Fine. I'll take her to school
but you need to pick her up.

39
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,741
Fine.

40
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,544
No doughnuts.

41
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,848
Are you guys getting
a divorce?

42
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,850
No.

43
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,719
Of course not.

44
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,921
Marnie's parents are
getting divorced.

45
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,490
Yeah, sweetie,
you're not marnie.

46
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,993
You guys fight.

47
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,061
Hey, kiddo.

48
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,130
You're passive-aggressive.

49
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,498
Did mom tell you that?

50
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,533
No.

51
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,638
Sweetie, your mother and i
love each other very much.

52
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,540
We always will.

53
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,841
But... sometimes people
make mistakes.

54
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,781
I'm not the easiest
to deal with, alright?

55
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,684
Your work has been centered

56
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,920
on these old houses
for quite some time.

57
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,189
What's the fascination?

58
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:41,092
My parents died in an accident
when I was quite young.

59
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,127
Uh...

60
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,929
No, that's fine.

61
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,932
I uh, I don't actually remember
a thing about them.

62
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:51,870
But it feels like forgetting
something you know is important.

63
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,607
You just have no idea
what it was.

64
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:59,811
I've become fascinated
by these empty vessels

65
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,481
that once housed such life.

66
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:05,083
I want to go to work
with daddy.

67
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,686
Carpentry is dangerous.

68
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,789
But this is so boring.

69
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,793
<i> The houses are like epitaphs.</i>

70
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:18,997
<i> They're glimpses</i>
<i> into lives once lived.</i>

71
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,766
<i> Echoes of the people</i>
<i> who once lived there.</i>

72
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,635
Is that it? Nope.

73
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:24,836
Is that it?

74
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,706
Of course not, stupid.

75
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,574
Who were they?

76
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,809
Where did they go?

77
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,177
Are they still alive?

78
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,248
What did they leave behind?

79
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,283
So what have you left behind?

80
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,218
Uh...

81
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,070
I'll tell you what.

82
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,106
How about we stop at bj's
on the way home?

83
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,677
Wow, turning down ice cream?

84
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,947
This must be serious.

85
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,224
<i> Mom?</i>

86
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,895
<i> Mom, what is it?</i>

87
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,899
<i> Mom, you're scaring me!</i>

88
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,700
Hello?

89
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,270
It's ok, you know.

90
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,238
It is.

91
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,917
Is this yours?

92
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,385
<i> What's your name?</i>

93
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,858
That's my mommy.

94
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,761
No.

95
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,864
No.

96
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,033
I said no!

97
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,268
Alice!

98
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,074
Alice!

99
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,650
Ali!

100
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,356
I was calling for you.

101
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,392
I know. That's why I came.

102
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,161
I still expect to go
for ice cream.

103
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,667
Come on.

104
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,820
<i> Hi, county archives please?</i>

105
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,822
<i> Yeah, I'd uh...</i>

106
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,959
<i> Like to order the property</i>
<i> record for 1268...</i>

107
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,264
Ok.

108
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,014
Five...

109
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,550
Four...

110
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,252
Three...

111
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:45,423
Two...

112
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,426
Olly
olly oxen free

113
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,302
honey.

114
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,336
You startled me.

115
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,508
What are you doing?

116
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,010
I wet the bed.

117
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,079
Hey, it's ok.

118
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,414
It happens to the best of us.

119
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,983
No it doesn't.

120
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,619
Even daddy does
when he drinks too much.

121
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,256
Come on.

122
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,858
Let's go.

123
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,407
<i> Are you alright?</i>

124
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,142
Oh my gosh.

125
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:11,142
<i> Jane.</i>

126
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,311
I'm so sorry.

127
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,113
<i> Come on, that's the second</i>
<i> time this week.</i>

128
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,949
I know, I know, I know.

129
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,984
I can be there in
twenty minutes, ok?

130
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:20,685
<i> You know what? Never mind.</i>

131
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,686
<i> I'll get her.</i>

132
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:27,058
No. I'll leave right away,
i swear.

133
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,059
<i> Fine.</i>

134
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,161
<i> I'll call the school.</i>

135
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,462
I'm sorry.

136
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,281
Hello?

137
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,019
I'm sorry, who?

138
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:01,225
Alice, I can't hear you.

139
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,661
I can't hear a word, honey.

140
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,563
She wants you to come back.

141
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:19,043
Five... four... three... two...

142
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,714
Olly olly oxen free.

143
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,135
<i> You need to come back.</i>

144
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,571
<i> Jane?</i>

145
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,075
Jane?

146
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,379
Jane.

147
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,819
Thank god.

148
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,491
Jane?

149
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,759
Mommy?

150
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,663
There's been a mistake.

151
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,099
You had an accident.

152
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,367
I don't know you.

153
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,435
It's not funny.

154
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,469
Doctor!

155
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,304
I don't know either of you.

156
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,705
Can we get a doctor in here?

157
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,407
What's wrong with her?

158
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,442
Where am I?

159
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,412
Hey, why are you here?

160
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,614
My mom went crazy.

161
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:08,653
She's not crazy,
she just has a secret.

162
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,621
Although the injuries she
sustained in the accident

163
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,390
were quite minor

164
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:16,761
they appear to have aggravated a
very severe, but older, injury.

165
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,795
Ok.

166
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,765
Jane?

167
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,235
Yeah.

168
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,572
Doctor Michaels asked me
if I would speak with you.

169
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,673
Ok.

170
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:29,774
I'm Liam.

171
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,809
I'm the on-call psychiatrist.

172
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,347
I don't need a shrink.

173
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,149
Well, Jane, I can help.

174
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,385
I can help stimulate the
recovery of your memory...

175
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,653
If you let me.

176
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,323
You see these sine lines?

177
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,191
They're remnants
from an old trauma,

178
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,893
twenty years or more.

179
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,562
Your wife's skull was fractured
in seven places.

180
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,832
Scar tissue can impede
long-term memory,

181
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,135
kind of like a splinter
in the brain,

182
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,170
waiting for the body
to push it out.

183
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,240
You're mistaken.

184
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,674
And...?

185
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,879
Her memory could
snap right back.

186
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,349
But I have to warn you,
it could take months.

187
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,885
I once had a patient who had to
re-learn the English language.

188
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,319
It might even explain
your fascination

189
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,488
with photographing old houses,
Mrs. reyer.

190
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,863
I'm tired.

191
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,765
Sure. Yeah.

192
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,233
Another time then.

193
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,905
Maybe spend some time
with your family, Mrs. reyer.

194
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,540
I think it'll do them
as much good as you.

195
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,607
Retten.

196
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,509
I'm sorry.

197
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,712
Reyer was my maiden name.

198
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:45,216
Yes it was.

199
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,787
Your memory is
improving already.

200
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,902
Look, once she gets back
into familiar surroundings

201
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,737
her condition will
likely improve.

202
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:44,976
Hey.

203
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,541
Are you alright?

204
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,615
Yeah.

205
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,717
That's good.

206
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,320
Do you remember me now?

207
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,354
Of course.

208
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,925
Some things are still fuzzy
but it's getting better.

209
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,564
As long as you remember
what matters most.

210
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,637
Look, I'm gonna get her home
and uh, fed,

211
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,372
but we'll be back tomorrow,
alright?

212
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,607
Ok.

213
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,641
Love you.

214
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,015
And no doughnuts!

215
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,888
I'm not sure why I said that.

216
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,866
The brain is a remarkable thing.

217
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:19,670
It can... it can re-wire itself,
repair itself.

218
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,940
Even create false memories
to protect us.

219
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,009
That's why we must treat the
cause, not just the symptom.

220
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,415
Very good.

221
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,983
Is there a heaven?

222
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,787
Uh, I don't know.

223
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,756
I'd like to think so.

224
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,725
Then there's a hell.

225
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,831
Sweetie, I think we live on
in the memories of the people

226
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,966
that loved us.

227
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,434
If we were good
in their life

228
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,470
then their memories of us
will be too.

229
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,407
What if they don't remember you?

230
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,943
What happens then?

231
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,778
Hey, mommy's not gonna
forget you.

232
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,813
I met a girl who said
she would.

233
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,651
Clearly she's a horrible little
person from a broken home.

234
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,020
Doofas.

235
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,799
Come in.

236
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,037
Come in!

237
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,418
I said, come in.

238
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,763
You gonna open it?

239
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,132
Jeez.

240
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,834
I didn't mean to startle you,

241
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,535
you've just been staring
at that box for two minutes.

242
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,171
Oh my god.

243
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,205
<i> Jane?</i>

244
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,846
Ok.

245
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,093
Hello?

246
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,131
Hello?

247
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,966
Oh, shit.

248
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,182
Hey.

249
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,186
Where did you get these?

250
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,221
The county archives
delivered them.

251
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,292
That's not possible.

252
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,394
My foster parents would have
told me.

253
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,629
Jane.

254
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:16,834
These files just didn't appear
out of the blue.

255
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,402
You ordered them.

256
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,004
When?

257
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,905
You tell me.

258
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,175
I can't remember.

259
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,210
You own that house.

260
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:27,244
No!

261
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,382
I forget little things,

262
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:35,753
like appointments,
birthdays, pick-ups.

263
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:36,787
Not...

264
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,961
I'm sorry.

265
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,198
I'm sorry.

266
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,937
I shouldn't even be here.

267
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,806
I should have picked her up.

268
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,913
The trust fund's been paying
the property tax.

269
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,949
It's managed by a...
Patrick ryer.

270
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,152
I think you have an uncle.

271
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,257
That explains why you keep
trying to photograph the place.

272
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,263
Jane, hey.

273
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:20,998
Hey.

274
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,733
We'll figure this out.

275
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,270
It's gonna be really positive.

276
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,337
It's an opportunity.

277
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,743
I barely remember
my own family.

278
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,379
Visiting your childhood home

279
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,082
could really stimulate some
repressed memories.

280
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,886
Why don't you at least
call your uncle?

281
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,155
Spend some time
at the house.

282
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,824
It certainly can't hurt.

283
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,762
<i> Hello?</i>

284
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,198
Patrick ryer?

285
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,035
<i> Speaking.</i>

286
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:36,907
<i> Hello?</i>

287
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:36,907
<i> Are you still there?</i>

288
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:40,077
Uh... yeah.

289
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,911
I um...

290
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,150
Are you the brother of-

291
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,184
who's calling, please?

292
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,253
<i> My name's Jane.</i>

293
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,858
Jane?

294
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,560
<i> Yeah.</i>

295
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,298
Wow.

296
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,835
Uh...

297
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:10,874
Um... are we...

298
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,242
Are you my uncle?

299
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:23,320
I haven't seen you in a...
Uh... but yeah.

300
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,122
<i> Yeah, I sure am.</i>

301
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,259
Um...

302
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,898
Would it be ok if- if
i came by sometime?

303
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:34,898
Um...

304
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,936
<i> You're welcome any time.</i>

305
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:39,970
<i> Of course.</i>

306
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,606
Ok.

307
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,630
Kinda familiar.

308
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,269
Maybe it's just like every
other place I've photographed.

309
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,974
I don't know.

310
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,922
Patrick?

311
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,525
You're the spitting image of
your mother.

312
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,266
We tore down the old barn,

313
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:45,335
turned your father's fields
there into corn and soy bean,

314
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,370
if you believe.

315
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,108
Your foster parents sold me
the fields

316
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,011
on the condition that you
keepin' the house.

317
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,549
Can't say I much wanted it

318
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,953
on account of the memories
good and bad, you know?

319
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,927
Um, I've gotta get something
off of my chest.

320
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:13,096
It's been weighing on me.

321
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,132
Um... about you
and foster care.

322
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,405
I just didn't know the first
thing about bringing up a kid.

323
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:22,639
I thought it'd be best for you.

324
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,674
Still, somehow it...

325
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,344
I don't know.

326
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:30,414
Didn't sit right with me.

327
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,448
I'm sorry.

328
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,190
Let me know if you need
anything.

329
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,363
What happened to them?

330
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,466
I assumed somebody told you,
janey.

331
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,200
I...

332
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,606
Your parents and your sister
passed on in that house.

333
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,212
I'm sorry.

334
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,319
I'm just the idiot
with my foot in my mouth.

335
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,356
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

336
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,237
So anything familiar?

337
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,673
I have never seen him before.

338
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,778
You guys coming or what?

339
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,192
It doesn't look too bad.

340
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:25,328
It's hot and it smells.

341
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,734
Tell us what you really feel,
kiddo.

342
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:30,734
I just did.

343
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,639
It does kinda smell,
doesn't it?

344
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,841
Like old socks.

345
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,143
Like stinky old socks.

346
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,147
What's wrong, mom?

347
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,489
Jane?

348
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,495
You guys check out
the house.

349
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,365
I'll take a look out back.

350
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:05,469
Come on. I wanna explore.

351
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,336
Alright, monkey.

352
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:07,571
Be careful.

353
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,106
Watch out for the big coyote!

354
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,641
No!

355
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,597
Looks like your mother's
old room when she was your age.

356
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,370
This one's locked.

357
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,210
See?

358
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,718
We're in luck.

359
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:42,966
Alice?

360
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,999
Babe, be careful with that.

361
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,234
I will.

362
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,671
Hey, that's not a toy,
honey.

363
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,506
Sweetie, it's vintage.

364
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,508
But it's in a little
girl's room.

365
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,444
Yeah, but when that little girl
played with it,

366
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,979
it wasn't vintage.

367
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,947
I'm gonna stay in your mother's
old room.

368
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:31,982
Let's go.

369
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,787
Come on, let's find-

370
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,294
it's alright.

371
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,729
<i> Uh oh.</i>

372
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,798
<i> I hope mommy has another key</i>
<i> or else we are in trouble.</i>

373
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,867
<i> You lost it.</i>

374
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,563
You remember me?

375
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:28,832
Of course.

376
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,903
What about our marriage?

377
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,373
It's fuzzy.

378
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,608
How fuzzy?

379
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,546
What do you want me to say?

380
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,791
We were having some problems,
but who doesn't, right?

381
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,901
You remember that I have a
monster dong though, right?

382
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,571
Do you?

383
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,547
Do you see their eyes?

384
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:18,615
Look in their eyes.

385
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:19,682
They're rectangular.

386
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:25,622
Hey, janey.

387
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:28,091
Someone needs their sugar fix.

388
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,193
Meet you at the car.

389
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,127
Candy apples!

390
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:31,895
Yes!

391
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:32,962
Come on.

392
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,497
I'm gonna eat all
the candy apples.

393
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,633
Mine, mine, mine!

394
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,256
Help you find anything?

395
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:36,025
I'm ok. Just browsing.

396
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,260
Take your time.

397
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,507
Excuse me.

398
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,211
Can I see that?

399
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,148
It's a shame to hang on to such
a tragedy, I know,

400
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,986
but I never put much stock
in what they print anyway.

401
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,750
Hello?

402
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:34,784
<i> Jane.</i>

403
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,186
Liam.

404
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,088
<i> We had an appointment.</i>

405
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:40,723
Did we?

406
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:44,761
I'm sorry, I uh... I just uh...

407
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:49,832
I took- I took your advice
and we're uh...

408
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,802
We're at the family farm.

409
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:55,305
<i> Oh, good.</i>

410
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:57,774
I'm sorry about the appointment,

411
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:58,775
I must have just-

412
00:42:58,777 --> 00:42:58,775
I must have just forgot.

413
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:03,079
<i> That's ok, I'm proud of you</i>
<i> for giving it a chance.</i>

414
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,114
<i> I'm glad you're alright.</i>

415
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,285
Where are you?

416
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,320
<i> At this moment?</i>

417
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,023
I'm in my office, why?

418
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,598
<i> Uh, Jane, I gotta go.</i>

419
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,232
<i> I have a patient, but um...</i>

420
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,001
<i> We'll talk soon, ok?</i>

421
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:27,870
<i> I'll be seeing you.</i>

422
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:44,721
Liam!

423
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,025
Liam!

424
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,699
Liam.

425
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,871
Give me a friggin' break.

426
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,406
If you did bad things
but don't remember,

427
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,442
are they still part of
who you are?

428
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,445
What?

429
00:46:58,916 --> 00:46:59,982
Never mind.

430
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,366
Turn it off.

431
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,437
Alan.

432
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,014
Hey.

433
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,151
Hey.

434
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:36,185
Shh.

435
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,056
They'll hear you.

436
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,292
<i> When you have a bad dream,</i>

437
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:20,496
<i> write it down on a piece of</i>
<i> paper and put it in a box.</i>

438
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:23,499
And the butterfly fairies
will change those things

439
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,668
so they're not scary anymore.

440
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,570
<i> The fairies are in the box?</i>

441
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:29,171
<i> Mmmhmm.</i>

442
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:30,473
And they're nice?

443
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:33,142
They are nice but they're
also tricksters.

444
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,577
They tell us riddles.

445
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,113
To understand them you have
to listen carefully

446
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:39,348
because your eyes
can be easily tricked.

447
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,217
Alice.

448
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,119
Let's go.

449
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:45,154
Alice isn't here right now.

450
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,006
Alan, get up!

451
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,208
Get up!

452
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:16,052
You come find us.

453
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,634
What are you doing, mommy?

454
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,271
It's time to get up.

455
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,075
It's 4:30!

456
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,180
Go back to bed.

457
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,627
Five, four, three, two, one.

458
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,362
Five, four, three, two, one.

459
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,064
Five, four, three, two, one.

460
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:39,201
Five, four, three, two, one.

461
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:46,709
Five... four... three... two...
One.

462
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,783
My brother was a lot of things.

463
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,318
Drunk.

464
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,855
An asshole at times, sure.

465
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:08,524
But he... he really loved
your mom.

466
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:09,592
He loved you kids,

467
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:14,597
even if he- even if he
didn't show it.

468
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,701
I know it's hard digging up
all this stuff.

469
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:21,270
I'm not sure if
I'm seeing things.

470
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,140
Remembering things.

471
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:29,145
Or someone's messing
with my head.

472
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,185
Did I kill them?

473
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,758
The only person who knows
what happened in that house

474
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,227
is you.

475
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,836
How could I forget something
like that?

476
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:57,673
It was an act of mercy.

477
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:03,245
I can't remember anything
about any of them.

478
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:13,389
Well, your pa was
a hell of a dancer.

479
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:14,423
Hard worker.

480
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:14,423
He was funny.

481
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,863
He was kind when he wanted
to be.

482
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:25,935
I mean, he had a temper, sure,
same as anyone.

483
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:27,970
I don't know what else
to tell you.

484
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,276
Thanks.

485
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:44,787
Morning, mommy.

486
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,226
You look really tired.

487
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,694
Thanks.

488
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:54,330
Can we go to the lake
and skip stones?

489
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:55,864
I don't know, monkey.

490
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:58,434
Please? Pretty please?

491
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:00,002
Maybe later, ok?

492
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:00,002
<i> Fine.</i>

493
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:04,707
<i> I'm sorry if Suzie kept you</i>
<i> awake last night.</i>

494
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,577
What'd you just say?

495
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,813
<i> Morning.</i>

496
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:12,548
My two favourite ladies.

497
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,451
How're we feeling?

498
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,019
Great.

499
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:21,357
Can you take her
to the lake?

500
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:23,859
You ok?

501
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:31,000
I wanna head back today.

502
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:32,968
I'm not feeling so good.

503
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,704
Tell me what's up.

504
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:38,741
I think this place is making
me worse.

505
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,679
We'll go home after lunch.

506
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,749
Who wants to skip
some stones?

507
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:47,783
I do!

508
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,795
Are there any bears
in these woods?

509
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:40,863
No.

510
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:42,598
They live further north.

511
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,534
What about wolves?

512
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,637
Well, you never know.

513
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,041
Hello?

514
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,779
Suzie?

515
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,559
What about fairies?

516
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:45,961
Would any fairies live
down here?

517
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,062
I don't know.

518
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:48,897
Well, you never can tell.

519
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:51,166
Fairies are tricksters.

520
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,068
Tinkerbell wasn't a trickster.

521
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,903
Yeah, that's different.

522
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,606
She wasn't real.

523
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:58,807
I see.

524
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,843
So real fairies are tricksters.

525
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,578
Yeah, they're good.

526
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,513
They tell us riddles.

527
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:05,781
You have to listen carefully

528
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:08,717
because your eyes
are easily tricked.

529
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,549
<i> Stupid.</i>

530
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:41,583
Suzie?

531
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:43,852
<i> You shouldn't be here.</i>

532
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,533
I know it's you.

533
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,045
Please don't hide.

534
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,747
We have to.

535
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:13,582
The monster's coming.

536
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:17,252
Hide!

537
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,721
Hide!

538
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,893
Shh!

539
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:39,641
You have to run!

540
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:40,809
I can't!

541
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:41,810
Run!

542
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,151
How do you know so much
about fairies?

543
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:24,886
I had a dream about it.

544
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,888
This nice lady taught me
a song.

545
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:27,956
She did?

546
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,024
Yeah.

547
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:31,293
She also said mommy's
gonna hurt me.

548
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:35,130
Honey, why would you say that?

549
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,002
Did mommy do something?

550
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:43,338
Mommy's not the real one
to be afraid of.

551
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,707
Then who is?

552
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:47,976
The monster in the bedroom.

553
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,691
I'm going to start loading
the car.

554
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,408
<i> Alice!</i>

555
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:55,844
<i> Alice!</i>

556
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,713
<i> Alice.</i>

557
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:06,922
Alice.

558
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,191
Alice.

559
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,930
We can't let you leave, janey.

560
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:16,264
We can't.

561
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,833
What are you doing?

562
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,370
Looking for you.

563
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,906
But I'm right here.

564
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,374
Were you singing?

565
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:27,809
The fairy song.

566
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,010
Where'd you hear it?

567
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:31,213
I don't know.

568
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:32,247
This is important.

569
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,151
Where'd you hear that song?

570
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:36,852
I don't know.

571
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:38,386
Of course you do!

572
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:40,822
Now you tell me
where you heard it!

573
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:41,289
I don't know-

574
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:42,124
Alice!

575
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:43,358
Hey!

576
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,295
Hey, what are you doing?

577
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,502
What the fuck?

578
01:02:53,504 --> 01:02:54,436
It's nothing.

579
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,071
You were hurting her.

580
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:57,072
It was an accident.

581
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:57,906
Don't bullshit me, Jane!

582
01:02:57,908 --> 01:02:58,507
She was driving me nuts.

583
01:02:58,509 --> 01:02:59,508
I just want to go!

584
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:00,976
Listen!

585
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,383
Come on.

586
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:09,284
No, no, no.

587
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,352
Jane.

588
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:11,953
You didn't.

589
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,523
Didn't what, Alan?

590
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:16,992
Tell me you didn't.

591
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,168
Of course I didn't.

592
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,169
I swear.

593
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,905
<i> Daddy!</i>

594
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:31,573
<i> Daddy!</i>

595
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,210
Alice!

596
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:35,877
Alice?

597
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:37,913
Alice!

598
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:38,914
What happened?

599
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,081
The man was chasing me.

600
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,049
What man?

601
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,317
We had to hide.

602
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,385
She must have imagined it.

603
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:45,086
What man?

604
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,421
The monster under the bed.

605
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,122
Alright, sweetie.

606
01:03:47,124 --> 01:03:47,956
Just-

607
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,093
oh god, Ali.

608
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:53,128
Ali, look.

609
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,095
Let me look.

610
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:54,596
Ok, relax.

611
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:55,497
Relax.

612
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,098
Just relax, relax, relax.

613
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,134
She's having an asthma attack.

614
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,204
What do you mean?

615
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:04,272
Just like my sister.

616
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:08,210
We gotta go.

617
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:09,578
Come on.

618
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,014
Hang on, sweetie. Hang on.

619
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,519
Goddammit.

620
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,428
It won't open.

621
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,202
Jane.

622
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,139
They won't let me leave.

623
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:45,313
Go.

624
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:55,190
Jane!

625
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:58,960
Get her out of here!

626
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,303
Ok.

627
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:24,606
Let's play.

628
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,597
Olly olly oxen free.

629
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,546
I know you.

630
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:58,393
Psst. Quickly.
You've gotta hide.

631
01:09:58,395 --> 01:09:59,427
He's coming!

632
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,798
You've gotta hide!

633
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,633
Hide, janey!

634
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:23,952
Shhh. It's him.

635
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:52,680
Shhh.

636
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,617
Pretty girl.

637
01:10:56,852 --> 01:11:00,355
You shouldn't be here.

638
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:02,724
Of course I should.

639
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:06,027
I even brought a present
for you.

640
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,744
Stay away from me.

641
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:42,930
Janey?

642
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:51,939
I'm not the monster.

643
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:52,974
He is.

644
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,315
Shhh.

645
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:01,416
Pretty girl.

646
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:03,084
You shouldn't be here.

647
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:06,421
Of course I should.

648
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:08,823
Just listen to the fairy song
and everything will be alright.

649
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:35,616
I'm fine.

650
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,389
Liam, let's go up.

651
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:42,423
Liam.

652
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,459
Liam.

653
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:46,394
Come on, let's go up.

654
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:47,628
Mommy?

655
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:48,663
No, no.

656
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,466
<i> Mommy!!</i>

657
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:00,541
Sweetheart, no.

658
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:00,541
No. Shh.

659
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:03,444
I need you to be quiet.
I need you to be quiet.

660
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:04,612
It'll be fine, just shhh.

661
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,013
Quiet.

662
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:07,148
Stop it!

663
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,383
Stop it!

664
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,019
You get away from her.

665
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:14,489
Jenny, wait.

666
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:15,656
Liam! Liam!

667
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:16,691
Wait, Jenny!
No, no, no!

668
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:17,692
Don't call him!

669
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:18,893
Don't call him.

670
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,562
Wait, wait, wait.

671
01:13:52,462 --> 01:13:54,829
Kiddo.

672
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,630
Christ!

673
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:25,059
The brain is a remarkable thing.

674
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:28,095
It can re-wire itself,
repair itself.

675
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,131
Even create false memories
to protect us.

676
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,200
Very good.

677
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:37,004
I barely remember
my own family.

678
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:39,039
I never put much stock
in what they print, anyway.

679
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:46,313
Where are you?

680
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,355
Daddy?

681
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:07,134
You should have
just told me.

682
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,904
Babe, we're trapped here.

683
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:11,172
I can only guide you
to the truth

684
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:13,207
and you can set us free.

685
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:32,993
I'm sorry.

686
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:36,831
Don't be.

687
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,401
Don't be. We love you.

688
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:46,841
Hey. Are you alright?

689
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:47,575
Hey.

690
01:20:47,577 --> 01:20:48,375
Alice.

691
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:49,443
Alice is fine.

692
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:51,545
She calmed down
once we hit the road.

693
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:59,620
Alan, I... it's going
to be better now.

694
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:03,591
I promise.

695
01:21:03,593 --> 01:21:06,260
Let's just change that tire
and get out of here.

696
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:14,134
Where's Alice?

697
01:21:14,136 --> 01:21:16,904
I dropped her off at Patrick's.

698
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:17,938
What?

699
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,907
Jane!

700
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:21,342
Hey, what's going on?!

701
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:34,355
Yeah, put your hands
on some cookies.

702
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:36,390
What's that you got there?

703
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,096
I didn't know kids still played
with Jacks anymore.

704
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:48,602
You sure were excited when we
played with those cows.

705
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:49,637
You wanna do that again?

706
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:51,138
Moo cow!

707
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:51,906
We can do that again.

708
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,479
I might need a favour first,
though.

709
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:00,314
Like what?

710
01:22:00,316 --> 01:22:03,417
Well, it'd have to be
our secret.

711
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:07,154
Can you keep a secret?

712
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:10,224
It's nothing much,
just a game.

713
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,927
They told me not to play
with you.

714
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:15,562
Who did?

715
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:16,597
No one.

716
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:23,203
Who would say something
mean like that?

717
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:24,238
I don't know.

718
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,074
Yes, you do.

719
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:32,379
I just want to know what
they've been saying to you.

720
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:44,058
Looks like they've said too
much already.

721
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:48,996
Let's go. Come on.

722
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:50,698
Let's go.

723
01:22:57,505 --> 01:22:58,505
Hey!

724
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,113
They're so silly.

725
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:07,147
Indeed.

726
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:10,184
Come on now.

727
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,252
You really need that?

728
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:14,088
A lot of foxes, Suzie.

729
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:15,689
Foxes everywhere.

730
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:18,425
Alice, not Suzie.

731
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:19,126
Yeah.

732
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:20,194
Patrick.

733
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:23,263
Hey!

734
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:23,998
Patrick!

735
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,698
Keep your distance.

736
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:25,766
Patrick, don't shoot!

737
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:25,766
Please, don't shoot!

738
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:28,102
Don't shoot.

739
01:23:28,104 --> 01:23:30,070
I wanna go home!

740
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:30,604
Patrick!

741
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:31,538
Patrick.

742
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,107
I wanna go home!

743
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,710
It's ok, sweetie. It's ok.

744
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:39,413
Everything's gonna be alright.

745
01:23:39,415 --> 01:23:40,547
Please, Patrick.

746
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:42,116
Don't hurt her.

747
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:45,519
Please.

748
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,554
Tell me what you want,
Patrick.

749
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,625
A second chance.

750
01:23:51,627 --> 01:23:52,659
Daddy!

751
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:34,835
<i> Hey. Hey.</i>

752
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:37,805
<i> Hey.</i>

753
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:41,108
<i> Hey.</i>

754
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:45,479
You can't leave me here.

755
01:24:45,481 --> 01:24:46,246
<i> No, stop!</i>

756
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,082
<i> You can't!</i>

757
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,386
Jane!

758
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:54,421
I- I never meant...

759
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,494
I loved your sister,
i just- we're family.

760
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:01,528
It was a mistake.

761
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,465
Tell that to them.

762
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:09,203
No!

763
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:10,537
No!

764
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:24,718
<i> Jane!</i>

765
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:32,526
<i> I'm sorry!</i>

766
01:25:50,412 --> 01:25:51,578
Jane!

767
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:22,609
Are there dead people
in there?

768
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:24,244
Yes, honey.

769
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:25,712
Eww.

770
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:27,281
Come on, let's go play
by the woods.

771
01:26:27,283 --> 01:26:28,782
See if there's any bears
in there.

772
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:30,951
You said they lived
further north!

773
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:58,278
<i> Olly olly oxen free.</i>
