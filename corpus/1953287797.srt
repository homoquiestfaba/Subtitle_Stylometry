1
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:26,834
"Shadows of Love"

2
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,126
Paris...

3
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:34,334
Will you really come back?

4
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,084
If it goes on like this,

5
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,126
I'm afraid I won't stay faithful to you

6
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:48,459
This is a breaking news report:

7
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,751
An avalanche

8
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,917
hit eastern Korea this morning

9
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,459
The number of casualties is still unknown

10
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,626
This is Korea's worst avalanche in 30 years

11
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,459
Since the ski resort Dragon Gate is nearby,

12
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:02,417
tourists might be buried in the snow

13
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,709
A rescue operation is underway

14
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:10,209
Mr Kwon, any news about Paris?

15
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:11,334
We're all so worried!

16
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,459
I called her many times

17
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,209
but no one's answered yet

18
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,251
I'm Kwon Jung-hoon

19
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:20,667
Today is the worst day of my life

20
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,667
Come back as soon as possible

21
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,709
The office is a mess
Everyone's discussing the avalanche

22
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:25,709
I can't

23
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:29,501
I booked her the hotel hit by the avalanche

24
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,834
Don't tell me...

25
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:32,501
What should we do?

26
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,709
Book me a flight to Daegu.

27
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:35,334
I must find her

28
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,084
What? The road is snow-blocked

29
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,584
I heard it's 8m deep

30
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,209
Go book me the flight right away

31
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:42,501
Sure, I'll book you the flight right now

32
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,376
I'm already on my way to the airport

33
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,084
Tell me right now

34
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:51,876
Do you support Dong or me?

35
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:53,834
Why must I choose?

36
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,751
I just don't want the company to split up

37
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,751
Come with me to Korea, or we break up

38
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,042
Be more mature! Don't be so stubborn

39
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,376
Listen up! It's either Dong or me!

40
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,209
Either him or me!

41
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,501
That's not good for the company

42
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,917
OK then. You stay here

43
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,917
I'm off to Korea to pitch other shareholders

44
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,084
Don't come with me

45
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,501
Regarding my trip to Korea,

46
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,876
I dare to you tell Dong!

47
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:39,542
Paris... Let go!

48
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:41,709
Paris...

49
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,126
Paris...

50
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,834
Hello Beautiful! Qin Xin

51
00:05:56,626 --> 00:06:00,042
You brought me flowers again! Please sit

52
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,459
Oh, and you bought so many things

53
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,542
Are you on leave today?

54
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,334
This is Granny

55
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:09,917
She and Grandpa had a legendary romance

56
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,084
Granny is very fond of me

57
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:13,584
She says I'm very like her

58
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,501
Come

59
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,542
It's clean

60
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:18,917
Have some tea

61
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,584
What program are you watching?

62
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:21,459
Japanese drama

63
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:22,501
That's a hit!

64
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:27,251
It's fabulous. I watch it every day

65
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,084
Paris

66
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:42,376
What's with you? Aren't you in Korea?

67
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,459
Why didn't you answer my calls?

68
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,209
You got the wrong person, sir

69
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,042
What's the matter with him?

70
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,834
Is he a looney?

71
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,251
But he's quite cute for a looney

72
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,001
I don't mind you playing with me

73
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,667
You know there's an avalanche in Korea today?

74
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,626
I was worried you had an accident!

75
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,584
I don't even know you. Why should I care?

76
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,584
The probability of <i>2</i> people looking identical

77
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,876
is 49 out of 1 million

78
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:19,001
Who said that?

79
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:20,417
Ridiculous!

80
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:34,292
Sorry, you look exactly like my friend

81
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,959
I'm so eager to find her I mistook you for her

82
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,917
This is my name card

83
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,251
I'm lucky I resemble someone you're tracking

84
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,126
If I resembled someone you want to beat up,

85
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:52,167
I could be doomed!

86
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:10,792
Hello

87
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:12,084
What should we do, Mr Kwon?

88
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,334
Mr Dong is looking for Paris

89
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,501
You haven't boarded yet?

90
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:16,542
Ask Derek to greet him

91
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:17,667
as if nothing happened

92
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,542
I'm off to Korea now

93
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:21,584
Don't go. The company needs you

94
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,209
Or Mr Dong will do whatever he pleases

95
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:26,751
OK, I'll come back right away

96
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:45,584
I like east meets west

97
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,042
This is Dong

98
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:50,626
An old fox

99
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,917
Since he founded KNC with Paris's father,

100
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,542
he's been plotting to buy it out
with foreign capital

101
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,209
so he can become the major shareholder

102
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:01,626
Only Paris can overpower him

103
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:07,126
Mr Kwon, any news about Paris yet?

104
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,542
Mr Kwon Mr Kwon

105
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,917
Excuse me

106
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,417
He's a pain in the ass, you take care of him

107
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,667
How's Paris?

108
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:34,084
The Korean HQ has deferred the board meeting

109
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,751
I wasn't told

110
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:41,584
Many matters in the office are being deferred

111
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,209
How can the takeover be deferred?

112
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,542
I heard you proposed the deferment

113
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:51,751
I better discuss this with Paris in person

114
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:56,751
She's in the US. Not sure when she'll be back

115
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,584
Takeover and restructuring are big issues

116
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:01,917
It's good to think it out a bit more

117
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:05,792
Think it out? Do you have second thoughts?

118
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,709
Don't be silly

119
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:17,709
You're so competent. I'm always your fan

120
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:22,376
Let's wait for Paris's return
for further discussion

121
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,376
After restructuring,
KNC will be quite different

122
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,626
Let me remind you, don't ever...

123
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,001
join the wrong team

124
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,792
If Paris still doesn't show up,

125
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:37,959
according to the bylaws, the Board

126
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,417
shall be chaired by me

127
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,251
Anyhow,

128
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:45,876
let's decide at the end of the month

129
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:49,084
OK!

130
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:59,042
Only you and I are familiar with Korea here

131
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,709
Do me a favor

132
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:03,834
If you have any news,

133
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:05,667
contact me immediately

134
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,084
You better take off immediately

135
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,501
Yes, Mr Kwon. I got it

136
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,792
So pretty! How are you today?

137
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,876
Happy? Wait...

138
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:20,917
Let me take a close-up first

139
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:28,001
I'm Qin Xin. I help my cousin sell flowers

140
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:31,959
This is my other cousin

141
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,834
He's inherited the "Romantic DNA"

142
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:34,917
in the family

143
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:36,792
Basically, his IQ is zero

144
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:40,584
Only when his girlfriend needed chemo
for her cancer

145
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,626
did he know it's hard to earn money

146
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:43,876
for the wedding

147
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,209
Top 50

148
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,042
Any discount?

149
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,167
Look at this one

150
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,084
It came in yesterday. Only $7,888

151
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:50,876
Yes, discount for you

152
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,709
My cousin is also a sentimental soul

153
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,167
After her husband died in a car accident,

154
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,834
she decided never to marry again

155
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:02,042
Hurry UP!

156
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:07,292
What time is it? Still moving one pot at a time

157
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:10,126
Deliver the flowers before they've wilted!

158
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,751
You're not in top form today

159
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,876
Sorry, no pictures

160
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:16,251
So pretty! How are you today?

161
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:20,501
Guess what I heard, Sis?

162
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,334
This cousin is even more moonstruck

163
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,084
His IQ is less than zero

164
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,251
His girlfriend often maxes out his credit card

165
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:28,959
I'll buy you

166
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,792
a limited edition bag next month

167
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,334
He once gave his girlfriend a pot of flowers

168
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,667
She thought

169
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,292
there's a wedding ring inside

170
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:36,792
They almost broke up

171
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:38,417
On my way here,

172
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,084
I heard a Korean company

173
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,626
would develop our area

174
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:42,417
We've hit a jackpot!

175
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:43,917
Is it KNC?

176
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,126
I got a letter early in the morning today

177
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,251
YEAH !

178
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:57,001
Why are you so happy?

179
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,084
If I'm really lucky,

180
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,917
Julian could become an international florist,

181
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:07,501
with branches in Hong Kong,

182
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:10,251
Beijing, Seoul...!

183
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:11,584
And I...

184
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,626
...have inherited Granny's DNA,

185
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,834
namely a hunch for bad things,

186
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,959
especially about people I love

187
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,792
No...

188
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,501
You think you can act willfully

189
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:30,126
because you're rich?

190
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,334
I've been living here for more than ten years

191
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:36,251
What are you building?
A science research center?

192
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,626
I won't leave even

193
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:40,126
if you're building a nuclear plant

194
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:41,459
Even if I die, I must die here

195
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:44,292
You can't do anything about me!

196
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,459
Money isn't everything!

197
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,917
When I saw the way Xin looked,

198
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,292
I knew it's over

199
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:52,459
Sorry!

200
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,126
It's not your fault

201
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,334
It's just me being unlucky

202
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,876
Mr Kwon, Mr Ke is getting much worse

203
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,376
He's worried about KNC and his daughter

204
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:10,292
If you find Miss Ke,

205
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,417
please ask her to see him immediately

206
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:16,376
We've done all we could medically

207
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:23,001
If Paris still doesn't show up,
according to the bylaws,

208
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:27,626
the Board shall be chaired by me

209
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:41,042
"Julian Florist"

210
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:43,917
Let's have breakfast!

211
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,126
Why are you so skinny? Eat more

212
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:51,501
It's my turn

213
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,209
Good morning

214
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,626
Welcome

215
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,084
Good morning

216
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:00,292
Are you kidding?
He came to the florist for me?

217
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,292
Feel free to browse around

218
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:08,584
It's the looney!

219
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,959
You think I want another lecture?

220
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:15,542
For the sake of KNC and Paris,
I'll be the looney!

221
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:16,876
Let me

222
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,501
Who are you looking for?

223
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,667
Excuse me, can I talk to her?

224
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:21,709
You can talk to me

225
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:22,667
Call the police

226
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,084
Please don't

227
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,126
Hear me out...

228
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,751
A friend of mine is a spitting image of her

229
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:33,126
I'm Kwun Jong-hoon of KNC. My name card

230
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:37,459
I have her pictures in my phone

231
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:39,334
Look

232
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:40,501
Look I'm far-sighted

233
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,667
I'm short-sighted

234
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:42,751
I'm astigmatic

235
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,292
Let me see

236
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,292
Her father is dying in sick bed

237
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,417
Maybe I shouldn't go. Let's go back

238
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,959
Take this as an audition

239
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:04,584
If your disguise is discovered in the company,

240
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,792
you won't need to see your dad in the hospital

241
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:08,584
Paris' dad

242
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,792
My dad is very healthy!

243
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,459
Welcome back!

244
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,626
Thank you!

245
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,709
Lovely!

246
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:36,667
The heels are so high. I must hang in there

247
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,792
I cannot sprain my ankle in front of them

248
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:51,834
What do you think?

249
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,501
I was thinking about my acting just now

250
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,251
Very good!

251
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:00,751
Give me five!

252
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,667
Yeah!

253
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,459
Yes!

254
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,292
Thanks. We'll visit your dad later...

255
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,584
Paris' dad!

256
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:11,709
Oh yes!

257
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,292
Can you play Paris for one more week?

258
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,334
Why?

259
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:15,917
To stabilize the morale in the company

260
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,376
so I have time to find Paris

261
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,792
Forget it! It's already too nerve-racking

262
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,626
I can't handle it. Let's forget it

263
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,334
I'm serious. Just give me your terms

264
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,542
OK, I have one condition

265
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,501
But no bargaining

266
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,334
No matter what buildings KNC will erect,

267
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,292
you must spare our florist

268
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,626
OK, I promise!

269
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,292
Daddy, I'm OK

270
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,042
Don't worry about me

271
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,251
You'll be fine also

272
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:18,376
Brother!

273
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,292
Mr Dong

274
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:21,876
Paris?

275
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,209
Paris...

276
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,542
Uncle Dong is here Hello!

277
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:32,209
Oh my God! I miss you so much!

278
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:34,292
Paris was ill in the States

279
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,626
She hasn't completely recovered

280
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:37,251
She'll pay you a visit in a couple of days

281
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,334
Let me see him

282
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,792
He's still not feeling well

283
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:40,959
If anything bad happens,

284
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,959
KNC will be seriously affected, right?

285
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:44,959
Paris, what's the matter?

286
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,751
Paris...

287
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,501
Nurse How is she?

288
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,542
What's the matter?

289
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:51,667
Mr Dong, please go back first

290
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,126
Is she all right?

291
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,167
Mr Dong, please go back first

292
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:56,251
I'll take care of her. Thanks!

293
00:18:57,084 --> 00:19:00,334
Paris...

294
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:02,126
Please wait here. I'll fetch the doctor

295
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,126
Paris!

296
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,376
Yeah!

297
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:20,001
Daddy, you'll be OK...

298
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:32,959
Fortunately, your dad is OK

299
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,251
Paris' dad!

300
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,167
Yes, you're right

301
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,251
Hurry!

302
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:42,251
Baby, not that I don't want to buy it for you,

303
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:44,251
but my credit card is maxed out this month

304
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:44,834
Next month

305
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,126
I'll buy

306
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:48,626
a limited edition bag for you

307
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:51,376
What frigging bag is it?

308
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:54,792
How can you cling to such a bimbo?

309
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:55,626
You crazy?

310
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,459
You don't get it.

311
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,334
When a man loves a woman,

312
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,334
even if she wants you to buy her 100 bags,

313
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:02,876
you won't think she wants too much;

314
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:04,667
you'll only blame yourself for being useless

315
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:07,501
No wonder I won't have a man in my life

316
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,959
I'd rather stay a woman

317
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,001
in my next life

318
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,584
I'll bring you there

319
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,417
You can help me

320
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16,584
I got nothing you want?

321
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,167
Let's work hard together!

322
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,709
You know why I do that? Why?

323
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,626
I want the Woman I love

324
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:24,667
to keep telling me

325
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,001
"I want!"

326
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:27,459
Whatever

327
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,667
I'm really worried about her

328
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,792
She's simply too nice to people

329
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,792
That's true

330
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,501
I'm taking off!

331
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:40,876
Let me help you I'll help you

332
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,001
Come

333
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:43,542
You're really following him

334
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,292
against my advice?

335
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:47,251
There're all sorts of people in the world

336
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,084
I tell you,

337
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,126
CEOs are not that uncommon!

338
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,209
He gave you his name card and you follow him?

339
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,917
Don't worry

340
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,626
Just let me help her father

341
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,376
Her father is quite miserable

342
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,417
I'll tell you a secret

343
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,459
Whoever lies to me shall come to misfortune!

344
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:05,876
OK, bye

345
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,459
Bye See you

346
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,667
Bye!

347
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,834
Write me a letter no matter what,

348
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:16,209
or how would I know

349
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,959
you can save our florist?

350
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,334
To be honest, I think...

351
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:24,959
Paris is worth much more than a florist

352
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:31,376
She finally spoke. Good! Very direct

353
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,834
I understand

354
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:38,251
Besides the florist,
I'll give you $1 million in cash

355
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:40,209
No bargaining

356
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,334
I'll take you to buy some clothes

357
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,334
You better not take your suitcase
into the house

358
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:48,167
I'll fetch it for you later

359
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:50,209
All right?

360
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:56,042
Just a random comment is worth $1 million?

361
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:58,542
I won't earn as much
if I sold flowers for ten years!

362
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,584
Mr Kwon

363
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:20,876
Hello, Uncle Zhou

364
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,542
No suitcase, Uncle Zhou

365
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:30,126
Uncle Zhou has seen Paris grow up

366
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,042
Hello, Uncle Zhou!

367
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:34,542
Miss, you're back?

368
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,792
Be indifferent

369
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,459
It's my home. Where else would I go?

370
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,667
Mr Kwon says if you can fool Uncle Zhou,

371
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:42,792
you're halfway there

372
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,834
So Uncle Zhou is worth half a million.

373
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,126
So where's your luggage?

374
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,334
We left the luggage at KNC

375
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,417
before coming here

376
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,834
This way, please!

377
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,834
You're such a liar

378
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,626
You need to be slicker

379
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:00,417
Or you won't be able to fool the butler

380
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:03,209
I'll succeed under the tutelage of King of Lies

381
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,126
What a huge mansion!

382
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:18,042
Can you give me a map?

383
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:20,876
I'm afraid I might lose my way

384
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:23,417
Miss, afternoon tea is ready

385
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:24,709
Uncle Zhou...

386
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:29,001
Mr Kwon, an invitation card

387
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:34,584
When was it delivered?

388
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,626
This morning

389
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:46,959
Hello, Mr Dong

390
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,292
Jong-hoon, is Paris all right?

391
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:52,001
She's much better. Thank you

392
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:53,334
It's great she's OK

393
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:54,876
She agreed to host

394
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:57,334
the Charity Ball next week

395
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:00,376
I got the invite, but Paris

396
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:02,626
might not be well enough to attend

397
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,667
She didn't come to see me,

398
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:06,917
Meaning she agrees to the takeover

399
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:09,459
She only needs to show up at the ball

400
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:12,042
and everyone at KNC will be happy

401
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,001
Besides, we all know Paris loves to dance

402
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,792
She must come!

403
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,709
I understand. I'll tell her

404
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,501
Why should there be a ball?

405
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:31,792
Paris, come here

406
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,626
Now you know how shrewd Dong is?

407
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:44,417
He's been suspicious all along

408
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,126
If he's as shrewd as you say,

409
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:50,042
shouldn't I skip

410
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,001
the ball altogether?

411
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:52,542
No way

412
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,084
You promised to play Paris

413
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:57,542
You must show up wherever she does

414
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:00,667
Dong has seen Paris grow up

415
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,917
He must be thinking of

416
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,417
testing and exposing you at the ball

417
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:07,751
So what should we do?

418
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:10,001
I don't know Paris' history?

419
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:11,959
Can you dance?

420
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,042
Come on!

421
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,417
Come on...

422
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,709
I barely learned how to wear high heels,

423
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:26,542
and now I have to dance?

424
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,751
Sit down, Uncle Zhou

425
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:42,792
Pardon?

426
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,167
Sit down

427
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,542
I sit down?

428
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,209
Sit down please

429
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:49,667
Paris, come here

430
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:56,792
Uncle Zhou,

431
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:59,126
Paris is going to publish a memoir

432
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,626
She must've had so many childhood anecdotes

433
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,126
Why don't you refresh her memory?

434
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:03,917
Yes, tell us as much as you can...

435
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:09,751
Tell us as much as you can remember

436
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:11,001
All right!

437
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:14,917
I'm not as old as I look.
I'm only approaching 70

438
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,959
My memory is still great

439
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:25,126
When should I start?

440
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,959
Start from the very beginning?

441
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:33,167
Her eyes were big and round at birth

442
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,959
Her eyeballs rolled around. So smart!

443
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:40,001
As if she was already several months old

444
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:42,959
She got off the bed
and checked out of the hospital.

445
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:44,876
How amazing!

446
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:59,417
This is Johnny.
I asked him to fly over to help out

447
00:26:59,876 --> 00:27:01,667
Who knows he did fly over here!

448
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:11,209
This is Xu Yuan

449
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,626
She and Johnny met for the first time like this

450
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:15,709
I only found out later

451
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:34,584
Where's Ke's Mansion on Golden Peak Road?

452
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:35,917
I know

453
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:39,542
Take the road behind me
all the way till the end

454
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:42,834
Thanks

455
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,709
May I have your name?

456
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:47,959
Johnny said he had set a record

457
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,667
He could find out the name

458
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,292
and phone number

459
00:27:52,376 --> 00:27:55,001
of any new girl he met within 5 sentences

460
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,709
How about this time?

461
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,334
Just call me Goddess

462
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:04,834
Nice to meet you, Goddess

463
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,292
You had a French boyfriend

464
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:21,459
when you studied in the UK

465
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:24,917
Didn't you say I studied in the US? Now the UK?

466
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,542
So did I study in the US

467
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:27,709
or the UK?

468
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,959
Right, it's different

469
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:37,917
That's not bad already

470
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:38,876
He has Alzheimer's!

471
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,917
I'm almost 80,

472
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:44,459
but I still have a good memory

473
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:45,959
What else?

474
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,834
We need to change the lighting.
Please take a break

475
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:53,917
Janet, inform Mr Kwon and other managers

476
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,834
to attend a meeting at the office at 3 pm

477
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,917
Put all the documents in the car

478
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,501
I'll read them in the car. Go!

479
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,584
She's not only a princess

480
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,501
but obviously a queen!

481
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:07,751
Memorize Paris' activities in recent years

482
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:10,084
Paris!

483
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,167
Paris!

484
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:16,084
Quick, hide it! Don't let anybody know

485
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:17,501
Go!

486
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,042
Paris!

487
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,876
It's your cousin Xu Yuan! Paris

488
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:25,209
Hi Hi! Take a seat

489
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,667
Paris, I heard that you're back

490
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,292
So I rushed here to see you

491
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:30,001
You miss her?

492
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,501
Paris!

493
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:41,042
What's the matter?

494
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,542
Nothing?

495
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,501
She cannot be Paris

496
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,709
Paris never not wears perfume

497
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,167
My God!

498
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:30,126
I can help you

499
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:32,167
as I know everything about Paris

500
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:35,626
But I'll be very strict,

501
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,709
as you don't look like her at all right now

502
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:40,917
Mr Kwon, there's someone for you

503
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:42,501
Shit, who's that?

504
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,084
You're Paris

505
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:47,126
Paris, you are Paris, okay?

506
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:52,417
There he is

507
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,126
"'8 you!

508
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:56,251
Hi! You're way too late!

509
00:30:58,334 --> 00:30:59,501
I met a goddess

510
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:01,251
who showed me the wrong way

511
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:04,667
Come

512
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:09,167
Paris, he's here to teach you dancing

513
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,959
How are you? I'm Johnny

514
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:15,417
Hi

515
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:20,959
She cannot be Paris!

516
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:25,167
You just came from abroad. How do you know?

517
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,376
Come on!

518
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:28,209
Paris is a great dancer.

519
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:29,501
She doesn't need lesson

520
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,959
You better do some homework!

521
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:39,584
OK, listen up

522
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,917
Everyone here must keep this secret for me

523
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:43,209
OK?

524
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,376
It hasn't been so lively here for a while!

525
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:50,376
Uncle Zhou...

526
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:52,209
Uncle Zhou, OK?

527
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:54,584
OK!

528
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,209
Sorry

529
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:16,042
One more spin

530
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:18,917
Two steps back. One, two

531
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,501
One more spin

532
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:21,751
Left or right?

533
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:23,209
Right

534
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,626
Remember it

535
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:28,917
No, you're way too off

536
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:31,667
Paris could dance better than you at 8

537
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:37,917
OK, you tell that Mr Dong

538
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:41,209
I sprained my ankle and can't dance

539
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,917
No, if I say that...

540
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,751
Dong will pretend to be concerned

541
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:47,001
and ask the best specialist

542
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:49,042
to check on you

543
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,376
You know what? Paris' forte

544
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,917
is her unwavering determination

545
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,876
to do whatever she wants to do

546
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,959
In fact, I quite pity Paris

547
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,334
So what if you own everything?

548
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,334
Since the first day I played her,

549
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,626
I've never felt she's happy

550
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:15,334
Paris and I share the same forte

551
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:16,459
Are you ill?

552
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:18,626
I'm sure you can dance as well as Paris

553
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:21,417
You just let her steal your limelight

554
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,417
Who says so?

555
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:30,959
I do

556
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:33,334
I don't know how to dance

557
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,209
Xu Yuan, you're such a great dancer!

558
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,542
Remember, Paris never gives compliments

559
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:13,959
Good dancers like you

560
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:16,001
can only be a Libra or a Gemini

561
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:20,042
These signs suit best for Sagittarius like me

562
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:29,834
I'm a Capricorn, the nemesis for Sagittarius

563
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,751
Have some water

564
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:43,709
Yes, I tell you what,

565
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,959
Paris never offers water to anyone

566
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,709
I know, Paris never offers anything to anyone

567
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:49,751
She won't offer help to anyone

568
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:51,292
She's the Queen

569
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:56,917
Can I secretly be Qin Xin here?

570
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:58,334
OK

571
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:00,709
Thanks

572
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:10,917
Any news from Paris?

573
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:14,917
The people I sent to Korea haven't found her

574
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,542
The only consolation is that

575
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:20,292
her name is not on the casualty list

576
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,209
It would be ideal

577
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,042
If Paris could come back before the ball

578
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,042
That would be perfect

579
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,917
Do you have a plan B?

580
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,626
To have Qin Xin continue to play Paris,

581
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:42,417
so Dong cannot be her proxy

582
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:44,209
in the takeover case

583
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:49,209
But Qin Xin would have to sign in the meeting

584
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:51,501
That will be trouble

585
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:53,334
We can only focus on the ball then

586
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,542
Xu Yuan will go to the ball, right?

587
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,876
Tell me more about Xu Yuan

588
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,001
Tell me, please

589
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:04,584
Tell me!

590
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,334
OK, I'll tell you

591
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,334
Xu Yuan's favorite is the dolphin. Go figure

592
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:15,001
Qin Xin, remember

593
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:17,959
Paris knows how to dress

594
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:19,792
and she loves to dance

595
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:22,001
She also pays attention to social etiquettes

596
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:25,001
She even wears heels at home

597
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,417
She can tell if vegetables

598
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,251
are organic by taste

599
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:31,667
But few people have seen her eat

600
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:34,001
Paris needs coffee in every meal,

601
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,376
with neither sugar nor milk

602
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:41,542
Also, Paris doesn't like flowers

603
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:44,126
as they remind her of funerals

604
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:47,209
She only trusts one person in the company,

605
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:50,542
and that person is Kwon Jong-hoon

606
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:04,876
Dear Paris,

607
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,292
Who knows how to translate Korean love letters?

608
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:41,167
Paris

609
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,876
I know Paris won't eat like me

610
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:45,792
But I've danced for 8 hours

611
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,084
and watched videos for 4

612
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:49,334
I also learnt to drink red and white wines

613
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:50,792
Even 10 of Paris' diet meals

614
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:52,834
won't fill me up

615
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,876
Aren't you hungry?

616
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,834
I don't eat much in the evening

617
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,751
You're suddenly swamped with work

618
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,751
Several shrimps are not enough

619
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:47,417
Fill your stomach and go to sleep early

620
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,501
I'll taste one too

621
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:03,876
Don't put so much wasabi next time

622
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:13,626
If Paris comes back, all hell will break loose

623
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:15,459
I really want to see

624
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:17,917
how alike they look

625
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,334
Actually, not at all

626
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,751
That's good then

627
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:25,959
That is to say, we finally have a consensus

628
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:28,126
What?

629
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:29,709
The fake isn't that bad

630
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:32,709
Frivolous!

631
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:44,167
I know you're actually an Aries,

632
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:47,167
the perfect match for Sagittarius

633
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:51,209
How do you know?

634
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:56,542
Kwon must have told you

635
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:13,001
Dolphins!

636
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,042
Real dolphins!

637
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,334
It's really beautiful here

638
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:24,751
But I think my flowers are more beautiful

639
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:26,959
Look how beautiful my flowers are!

640
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,542
I designed that

641
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:30,417
It's me, not you

642
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:33,167
It's mine, mine, mine!

643
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,209
Mr Kwon

644
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:38,626
Come, I've something to show you

645
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,459
Smell the flower

646
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,459
Isn't it aromatic and soothing?

647
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:50,001
Paris will be happy when she comes back

648
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:53,584
Paris is mysophobic

649
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,376
She doesn't like to put flowers

650
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:58,834
in her rooms

651
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,501
Sorry

652
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,542
Before Paris comes back,

653
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:11,917
I'll restore the room to how it was

654
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,126
That's true!

655
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:15,417
If my room is messed up

656
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:16,959
without my consent,

657
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:18,751
I would be unhappy too

658
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:22,917
I didn't mean that

659
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,667
Anyway,

660
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:25,584
before Paris comes back,

661
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:28,084
can you let these flowers keep me company?

662
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,126
I'm afraid of loneliness

663
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:34,792
OK

664
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:38,001
If you can let the flowers keep me company,

665
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:39,167
can I have another request?

666
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:40,751
Can I be myself again once in a while?

667
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:43,001
Because if I stay in my role all the time,

668
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,834
I will go crazy!

669
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:46,084
Can I?

670
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,709
So how much time do you need?

671
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:51,167
Besides your sleep,

672
00:41:58,376 --> 00:41:59,709
OK,

673
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:01,501
when there's nobody around,

674
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:03,834
I can grant you <i>2</i> hours

675
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:05,334
to be yourself again

676
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:06,709
OK

677
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:07,876
OK!

678
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,376
Yes, yes!

679
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:17,667
Sorry

680
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,167
That's the best I can do

681
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:21,584
OK

682
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,459
Yes!

683
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:39,209
I was only gone for a few days

684
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:40,584
What is it?

685
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:43,792
Who dared to put stuff in my room?

686
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,709
What right do you have? Throw them all out!

687
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,459
Every single shred!

688
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,542
You dared to sleep in my bedroom

689
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:01,292
and mess with my stuff?

690
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:03,251
Who do you think you are?

691
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:07,001
You really think you deserve to be Paris?

692
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:11,209
Tell her that her dream is over

693
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:12,792
Nothing here

694
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:16,001
ever belonged to her

695
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:20,626
From this minute on, I have <i>2</i> hours

696
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:24,167
to be myself, to be Qin Xin again

697
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:28,126
<i>2</i> hours of my own time, Qin Xin's time!

698
00:43:45,001 --> 00:43:47,667
Hello, is that Paris?

699
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,959
You think he's still around?

700
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:06,084
Sometimes, there are things

701
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,376
you really cannot believe

702
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:10,584
It happened to us before

703
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:13,376
When you think of someone,

704
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:17,834
that someone will really appear!

705
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,459
Had it not been for your Grandpa,

706
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:26,751
I would have died in the war

707
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:32,959
In those days, almost all men were conscripted

708
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:35,959
Grandpa escaped

709
00:44:36,376 --> 00:44:39,751
He wandered all alone in the war,

710
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:43,709
surviving on tree barks and river water

711
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:46,376
Most men could not hold up,

712
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:48,584
dying of illness or hunger,

713
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:50,626
or being eaten by wolves

714
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:54,792
Grandpa was lucky

715
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:32,709
Wake up!

716
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:43,167
Wake up!

717
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:46,042
Thanks

718
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,376
Thank you

719
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:52,459
My father is a doctor

720
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:54,751
This herb is very good for you

721
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:56,834
Are you Japanese?

722
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:00,626
No, I'm Chinese

723
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:04,709
After my parents died,
a Japanese doctor adopted me

724
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:50,584
This girl is quite pretty

725
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:51,626
It's a shame she can't speak

726
00:47:52,459 --> 00:47:55,209
It's OK as long as that man accepts her

727
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:59,501
We're out of firewood. I'll go chop some

728
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:19,667
How is she?

729
00:48:20,209 --> 00:48:21,209
Let's go find out

730
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,667
Bi Da, be careful of mines!

731
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:28,626
She's not a mute. She's Japanese

732
00:48:28,626 --> 00:48:30,042
Bi Da, be careful!

733
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:47,709
She only pretended to be a mute.
She's Japanese!

734
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,126
Go!

735
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:17,751
What are you laughing at?

736
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,501
What are you laughing at?

737
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:37,251
He walked very fast. I was always behind him

738
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:42,251
I liked to look at his back, his shadow

739
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:47,126
I felt safe walking behind him

740
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:51,626
I had a hunch I would see him again

741
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:54,251
But why do I always have the hunch

742
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:57,001
that everything will vanish?

743
00:49:58,542 --> 00:49:59,959
You cherish them,

744
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:03,584
so you're scared of losing them

745
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:08,376
In fact, there's still a lot in your life

746
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:12,001
to be experienced gradually

747
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:23,084
Miss Ke,
the order you made last week has arrived

748
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:25,501
There are still a few items
on the way from the US

749
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,084
I'm sorry Thanks

750
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:30,542
I've chosen an evening gown for you

751
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:31,917
It will be ready soon

752
00:50:50,376 --> 00:50:51,042
Miss Ke

753
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:52,959
you're keeping your figure so well

754
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:57,084
That's it, thanks Thanks

755
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,209
Thank you

756
00:51:14,626 --> 00:51:16,459
When Paris wears her evening gown,

757
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:18,542
she likes to put her hair up

758
00:51:43,959 --> 00:51:45,167
Sorry...

759
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:46,667
Sorry

760
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:57,667
Let me

761
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:17,542
Paris, will you really come back?

762
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:21,209
If it goes on like this...

763
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:26,001
I'm afraid...I won't stay faithful to you!

764
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:38,126
Where did you spend summer <i>2</i> years ago?

765
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:39,834
Brisbane

766
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,167
With whom?

767
00:52:43,959 --> 00:52:44,959
You,

768
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:47,042
Daddy,

769
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:49,542
and also Dong

770
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:52,876
Remember, you always call him Uncle Dong

771
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:56,542
Yes, Uncle Dong

772
00:52:58,376 --> 00:52:59,542
Who else?

773
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:01,501
Who else?

774
00:53:04,459 --> 00:53:06,126
Kwon Jong-hoon

775
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:09,334
Yes, right

776
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:11,959
Does Paris have

777
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:14,584
to remember everybody's name?

778
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:16,292
But wherever she is,

779
00:53:16,376 --> 00:53:18,084
Paris needs to know first thing

780
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:21,167
where Kwon is and with whom

781
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:24,417
24/7 surveillance.
Must be hard to date like that!

782
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:25,459
How does Kwon take it?

783
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:26,584
He...

784
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:28,959
Whatever you want to know, just ask me

785
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:30,709
Speak of the devil!

786
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:32,667
Here he is now!

787
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:33,417
Sorry,

788
00:53:33,584 --> 00:53:35,959
but Dong won't ask such questions

789
00:53:36,709 --> 00:53:38,209
No need to apologize, Guardian Angel

790
00:53:38,334 --> 00:53:39,667
Guardian Angel! (Korean)

791
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:45,667
You think it's fun to pry?

792
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,042
Pry?

793
00:53:52,251 --> 00:53:54,001
How did I pry?

794
00:53:54,709 --> 00:53:58,459
You asked me to read Paris' materials

795
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:01,459
You asked me to play Paris seriously

796
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:03,584
so no one will know I'm a fake

797
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:07,167
You made me stay in Paris' room

798
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:10,209
You made me think I'm Paris

799
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:11,834
So when I see things in the room,

800
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:13,251
that's called prying?

801
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:14,959
They are two different matters

802
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:17,167
OK, please explain to me

803
00:54:17,292 --> 00:54:18,459
What can I see?

804
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:19,501
What can't I see?

805
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:20,667
What should I know?

806
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:21,834
What shouldn't I know?

807
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,042
What should I say?

808
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:24,709
What shouldn't I say?

809
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:28,376
So is what happens between you and Paris

810
00:54:28,459 --> 00:54:31,084
absolutely off limits to me?

811
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:32,167
You know this has nothing

812
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:34,042
to do with your mission

813
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:35,667
Understand?

814
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:39,167
Thanks,Boss

815
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:40,459
I almost forgot

816
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:41,709
True, after the ball,

817
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:44,584
everything here is no longer mine

818
00:54:46,959 --> 00:54:50,001
I don't know what you mean by that?

819
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:54,167
I'm rehearsing my dance

820
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,709
and you're distracting me

821
00:54:56,959 --> 00:54:59,042
At least I'm Paris now

822
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:01,334
Out of my room!

823
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:02,667
Now!

824
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:12,584
Par... Qin Xin!

825
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:17,709
Please go. I don't want to rehearse. Thanks

826
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,126
Hey!

827
00:55:43,876 --> 00:55:46,834
Stop the car! Be careful!

828
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:09,042
Sorry!

829
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:13,042
Don't say sorry

830
00:56:13,042 --> 00:56:14,792
Let's not fight any more

831
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,667
Anymore?

832
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:23,709
I'll split after the ball

833
00:56:26,001 --> 00:56:27,626
Don't say that again

834
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,667
I'm not the real Paris you love

835
00:56:55,834 --> 00:56:57,001
How's Kwon in the last couple of days?

836
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,334
I've convinced the Korean shareholders

837
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:04,917
not to support the takeover

838
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:07,667
You haven't answered me yet

839
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:11,751
Paris, I really don't know how to tell you

840
00:57:12,084 --> 00:57:14,542
The less you say, the more I suspect

841
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:16,626
Thanks for that

842
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,042
Hi! I-li!

843
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:30,834
Welcome to Julian

844
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:33,834
ls there a Miss Qin here?

845
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:36,834
I saw the pictures she posted on the web

846
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,501
They are flowers. So beautiful!

847
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,376
I want to learn more

848
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,417
She's on vacation abroad

849
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:46,126
I'm her cousin

850
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:49,167
Hello

851
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:50,292
How can I help you?

852
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:51,334
We have a delivery for you

853
00:57:51,459 --> 00:57:52,292
Sis!

854
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:54,376
What are you here for?

855
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,417
We have a delivery from Miss Qin

856
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:57,584
Where should I put it?

857
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,001
Put them all here

858
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:00,917
Put this one over there. Yes

859
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:03,084
So many?

860
00:58:03,459 --> 00:58:04,876
All brand names!

861
00:58:05,126 --> 00:58:06,417
You know when a man

862
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:07,709
feels most like a man?

863
00:58:08,959 --> 00:58:11,542
When he can satisfy the woman he loves

864
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:16,042
Tian Fang will look pretty in this wedding gown

865
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:19,334
Too bad she cannot wear it and stand up

866
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:20,876
to take a picture with us!

867
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:24,542
Silly boy!

868
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,001
Your Miss Qin really knows how to shop

869
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:29,876
I wish she were here

870
00:58:30,084 --> 00:58:32,376
I could ask her to pick some flowers for me

871
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:34,626
Flowers, go

872
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,709
This is her favorite flower

873
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:42,334
It looks like a collection of hearts

874
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:44,126
Qin Xin is very kind-hearted

875
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:45,792
Look how much she's given us

876
00:58:48,876 --> 00:58:50,251
What happened?

877
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:51,584
I...

878
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:52,834
I was about to give you your wages

879
00:58:52,834 --> 00:58:54,459
when I discovered a new deposit of...

880
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:56,084
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 zeros...

881
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:58,459
One million bucks!

882
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:03,376
This is for you

883
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,292
Thank you

884
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:08,209
They are so pretty, don't you think?

885
00:59:12,876 --> 00:59:14,667
Paris called and said...

886
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:17,542
she's coming back

887
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:19,501
She asked me not to tell anyone

888
00:59:19,792 --> 00:59:22,417
But after much deliberation,

889
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:25,167
I feel obliged to tell you

890
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:27,709
Does Kwon know?

891
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:32,876
I think, in comparison,

892
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:34,959
you deserve to know more

893
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:38,917
Thanks

894
00:59:41,459 --> 00:59:43,459
I'll leave here tomorrow

895
00:59:45,084 --> 00:59:46,542
Don't worry

896
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:47,917
I've promised you

897
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,709
I'd take you back to the florist
to care for you

898
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:01,626
I have a present for you

899
01:00:09,959 --> 01:00:11,959
Why are you giving me a present?

900
01:00:40,376 --> 01:00:43,251
These earrings look beautiful on you

901
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:02,834
They're specially designed for you

902
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:06,876
1,2,3,1,2,3

903
01:01:07,126 --> 01:01:09,376
I thought you really bought me a present

904
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,376
Paris!

905
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:19,709
OK, let me try how fun these earrings are

906
01:01:21,334 --> 01:01:22,709
Paris...

907
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:25,042
Paris...

908
01:01:34,501 --> 01:01:36,251
We don't have much time left

909
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:38,334
After the ball,

910
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:40,501
I'll take a trip to Korea

911
01:01:47,084 --> 01:01:49,626
Aren't you supposed to go anyway?

912
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:52,042
And I will go back to the florist

913
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,917
During the days at KNC

914
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:57,126
and in Ke's mansion,

915
01:01:57,209 --> 01:01:58,709
I know...

916
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:02,251
it's been hard for you

917
01:02:06,001 --> 01:02:07,542
It's not really that hard

918
01:02:18,459 --> 01:02:20,959
Qin Xin, thank you

919
01:02:21,501 --> 01:02:23,626
I will never forget you

920
01:02:24,626 --> 01:02:28,042
I hope you'll remember Kwon Jong-hoon too

921
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,376
Yes...

922
01:02:38,126 --> 01:02:40,876
Had you not reminded me, I almost forgot

923
01:02:44,459 --> 01:02:46,792
What's your name?

924
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:51,792
I really can't remember

925
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:56,167
It's like when you have a dream

926
01:02:56,792 --> 01:03:01,084
and can't remember a thing when you wake up

927
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:05,126
It's like nothing has ever happened

928
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:19,209
Qin Xin, I love you

929
01:03:21,376 --> 01:03:23,334
I think I've fallen in love with you

930
01:03:42,584 --> 01:03:46,751
Qin Xin,
why did you come see me so late at night?

931
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:50,917
Look! Your eyes are swollen with tears

932
01:03:51,084 --> 01:03:53,376
What made you so sad?

933
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:56,834
After tomorrow,

934
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:01,084
my mission for him will be accomplished

935
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:04,459
As for my 3 cousins,

936
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:06,417
I've helped them

937
01:04:07,876 --> 01:04:09,376
But...

938
01:04:10,376 --> 01:04:12,876
you have your rewards too

939
01:04:15,376 --> 01:04:17,917
If you call these my rewards,

940
01:04:19,626 --> 01:04:22,251
I'd rather not have them

941
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,876
From the get-go.

942
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,459
We're from two different Worlds

943
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,959
Say, how can a bird
end up together with a fish?

944
01:04:33,209 --> 01:04:37,876
Grandpa and I spoke different languages

945
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:41,792
but we managed to stay together, no?

946
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:45,126
I know you still miss him, right?

947
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:53,084
I'm absolutely sure he'll be missing me too

948
01:05:14,667 --> 01:05:15,376
Bi Da!

949
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:16,501
Don't speak!

950
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:18,792
Don't speak!

951
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,959
Stop talking!

952
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:25,167
Sorry

953
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:26,917
I need to join the war

954
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:46,834
I feel that my life is without regret,

955
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:52,584
having met a man worthy my love

956
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:58,084
Isn't that the same for you?

957
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:06,084
It's OK if your heart is overstuffed,

958
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:10,667
as long as it's filled with things you like

959
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,417
Having loved and lost

960
01:06:15,751 --> 01:06:22,209
is better than not having loved at all

961
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:52,459
This way, please Thanks

962
01:06:52,459 --> 01:06:53,334
Thanks

963
01:06:56,334 --> 01:06:57,209
Cheers!

964
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:00,709
Can you hear me?

965
01:07:00,876 --> 01:07:02,292
Loud and clear

966
01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:05,042
This is Xu Yuan. Clear for me too

967
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:07,542
Good. Have you got off the car yet?

968
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:10,167
Miss Ke...

969
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:11,876
Heard you were caught in the avalanche in Korea
Thanks for your concern

970
01:07:11,876 --> 01:07:13,501
So what was that all about?

971
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:14,917
This is your first appearance.
A few words, please

972
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:15,709
Wonderful evening!

973
01:07:15,709 --> 01:07:17,209
Thank you. Thank you, everyone

974
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:30,251
Paris, you're back? You OK?

975
01:07:30,251 --> 01:07:32,792
Annie, thank you. I'm good. Don't worry

976
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:34,001
You really OK?

977
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:35,876
Paris is standing right in front of you!

978
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:36,626
Excuse me.

979
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:39,126
I need to bring Paris to see Mr Dong

980
01:07:41,584 --> 01:07:43,292
Paris wasn't in Korea...

981
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:44,917
Paris actually was in the US

982
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:47,417
She wanted a break. She was back last week

983
01:07:47,542 --> 01:07:49,251
You look gorgeous tonight

984
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:52,417
Are you praising me or Paris?

985
01:07:52,917 --> 01:07:55,126
I can't even tell the difference

986
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,626
You've surpassed my expectations

987
01:07:57,751 --> 01:07:58,792
Paris

988
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:00,751
Uncle Dong

989
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:04,542
Thanks for

990
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,667
inviting me to the Charity Ball

991
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:08,501
I'm so happy to see you

992
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,959
You know I was so worried about you!

993
01:08:11,209 --> 01:08:13,292
You must promise me the first dance

994
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:16,792
I have so much to tell you

995
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:18,417
Of course

996
01:08:31,376 --> 01:08:33,501
You are as pretty as you are competent

997
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,751
All 5,000 of the staff

998
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:37,876
at KNC worship you

999
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:40,792
KNC already has a staff of 8,400

1000
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,126
KNC has developed rapidly

1001
01:08:43,334 --> 01:08:45,792
We have a staff of 8,400 already

1002
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:48,667
Oh that's right

1003
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,792
Seeing how ill your dad is

1004
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:57,417
reminds me of the days when he
and I would share a bowl of noodles

1005
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,417
They met when they studied in Japan

1006
01:09:01,834 --> 01:09:02,876
Dad told me

1007
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:05,459
you were studying in Japan then

1008
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:08,876
They both launched their careers in Tokyo

1009
01:09:09,417 --> 01:09:10,792
Time flies

1010
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:12,376
Paris left Japan at the age of 6

1011
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:14,584
I was 5 or 6 years old then

1012
01:09:15,709 --> 01:09:18,626
And now, I'm dancing with Uncle Dong

1013
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:24,376
You look more and more like your mom

1014
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:31,126
Hurry! Give her the cue!

1015
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,376
I never met Auntie

1016
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:33,834
It's a shame

1017
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:41,501
I was so little when Mom had a plane crash

1018
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:44,417
I simply don't recall how she looked

1019
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:50,584
Sorry

1020
01:09:51,376 --> 01:09:54,126
I shouldn't have brought that up. Sorry

1021
01:09:54,126 --> 01:09:55,584
Bravo! Bravo!

1022
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:58,417
It's OK. Thanks for your concern, Uncle Dong

1023
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:37,709
I'm going back to the US the day after tomorrow

1024
01:10:38,376 --> 01:10:40,001
Want to come with me?

1025
01:10:44,626 --> 01:10:46,126
Let me think about it

1026
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,917
You are wonderful!

1027
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:04,376
I'm actually enjoying it

1028
01:11:07,084 --> 01:11:10,167
Now everyone believes Paris is back

1029
01:11:11,251 --> 01:11:14,042
Dong can do nothing about it

1030
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:35,584
What's wrong? Paris!

1031
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,626
Paris...

1032
01:11:51,501 --> 01:11:53,417
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1033
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:54,959
Let me go check

1034
01:12:32,959 --> 01:12:34,667
So you are Qin Xin?

1035
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:36,542
You can go now

1036
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:40,001
Let me remind you,

1037
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:40,917
you have nothing to do with KNC

1038
01:12:41,501 --> 01:12:44,001
or the Ke's any more

1039
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:45,917
I understand

1040
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:48,417
Actually, I really have to leave right now

1041
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:51,251
You're not needed here any more,

1042
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:53,417
not even as my shadow

1043
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:06,834
Ladies and gentlemen

1044
01:13:06,959 --> 01:13:08,584
We have received a total donation of

1045
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:12,167
at the Charity Ball this evening $ 20 million

1046
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:15,167
We've arranged a big cheque

1047
01:13:15,334 --> 01:13:21,001
for the signature of our Chairman, Paris

1048
01:13:25,084 --> 01:13:26,251
Miss Ke, this way please

1049
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:27,917
This way, Miss Ke Thank you

1050
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:29,584
Over here, thank you

1051
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:32,292
A picture of you together

1052
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:33,584
OK

1053
01:13:34,626 --> 01:13:35,834
This way, to the left. Thank you

1054
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:37,292
Please stand closer Yes, thank you

1055
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:38,751
Thanks This way, thank you

1056
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:40,167
Another one, another one

1057
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:42,209
The chairman of KNC

1058
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,084
Thank you, Uncle Dong

1059
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,126
Paris bumped into Qin Xin at the entrance

1060
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:03,167
Where's Qin Xin?

1061
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:05,626
She left

1062
01:14:09,292 --> 01:14:11,376
Qin Xin, where are you?

1063
01:14:11,834 --> 01:14:12,751
Qin Xin

1064
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:17,167
May we have the CEO of KNC,

1065
01:14:17,251 --> 01:14:18,834
Mr Kwon Jong-hoon

1066
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:50,459
Paris

1067
01:14:51,459 --> 01:14:52,126
Paris

1068
01:15:15,084 --> 01:15:17,917
Uncle Zhou, throw everything away

1069
01:15:18,084 --> 01:15:19,626
that doesn't belong to me

1070
01:15:19,709 --> 01:15:21,209
Yes, Miss

1071
01:15:23,459 --> 01:15:25,542
Restore my room to its original condition

1072
01:15:34,834 --> 01:15:36,001
Paris

1073
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:40,001
We'll pack and return them to her

1074
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:43,792
Are you returning them...

1075
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:48,834
or are you?

1076
01:15:56,126 --> 01:15:57,876
She came here to help us

1077
01:15:58,042 --> 01:15:59,751
She's a good person

1078
01:16:00,126 --> 01:16:02,209
Miss, that lady...

1079
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:05,292
I better shut up

1080
01:16:21,959 --> 01:16:23,001
Paris,

1081
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:26,626
we actually didn't mean to offend you

1082
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:37,459
OK, no need to pack

1083
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,251
I'm never coming back

1084
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:41,334
Paris...

1085
01:16:41,584 --> 01:16:42,667
Paris!

1086
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:46,792
Get in

1087
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:48,417
back to my villa

1088
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:00,709
What?

1089
01:17:06,209 --> 01:17:07,959
I'm not going with you

1090
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:09,417
She's in such a rush.

1091
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,792
Something must have happened

1092
01:17:16,917 --> 01:17:18,376
Get into the car Paris

1093
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:24,459
You can't ask everyone

1094
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:26,667
to listen to you 24/7

1095
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:31,542
I'm not asking

1096
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:35,876
This is an order

1097
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:42,667
Can't you be nicer to others?

1098
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:44,751
You should change a bit

1099
01:17:56,459 --> 01:17:57,792
Nicer to others?

1100
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:00,251
Who's ever nice to me?

1101
01:18:00,792 --> 01:18:02,042
I'm Paris

1102
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:05,209
I've been running KNC since I was little

1103
01:18:06,126 --> 01:18:07,584
After my dad has fallen ill,

1104
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:09,459
I still have to support the Ke family

1105
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:11,251
Who can I rely on?

1106
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:13,376
OK, you want me to be nicer?

1107
01:18:13,501 --> 01:18:15,584
I'd have been killed a long time ago!

1108
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,917
The fact that Dong cannot prevail today

1109
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:20,709
is because I've been relentless

1110
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:22,709
I can win

1111
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:24,626
I can lose

1112
01:18:26,251 --> 01:18:28,792
But I cannot tolerate a draw

1113
01:18:31,001 --> 01:18:32,751
I'm giving you 2 choices:

1114
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,917
1) you leave with me now;

1115
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:37,042
2) you go back to her

1116
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:47,251
I'm telling you

1117
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:49,584
I won't mistreat someone who loves me

1118
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:54,001
But I'll never forgive a man who betrays me

1119
01:18:54,459 --> 01:18:57,167
Today, you've chosen to leave me

1120
01:18:57,501 --> 01:18:59,251
I'll strip you of everything you have

1121
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:08,376
Paris, I'm sorry

1122
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:12,001
It's my fault to find a substitute for you

1123
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,126
Let me apologize to you

1124
01:19:18,209 --> 01:19:20,042
Sorry! (Korean)

1125
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:36,834
You always told me

1126
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:40,584
you had a hunch you'd see him again

1127
01:20:43,751 --> 01:20:44,709
I believe

1128
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:47,751
you're already with him happily

1129
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:53,209
You spent your whole life waiting for him

1130
01:20:58,334 --> 01:21:00,126
You've finally made it!

1131
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:02,792
I asked you

1132
01:21:03,917 --> 01:21:06,667
why my hunches had to do with losses

1133
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:10,501
You told me

1134
01:21:11,501 --> 01:21:13,209
because I cherished what I liked so much

1135
01:21:14,084 --> 01:21:16,334
I was scared of losing them

1136
01:21:17,334 --> 01:21:19,292
I've fallen in love with a man

1137
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:21,542
I'm scared of losing him

1138
01:21:21,834 --> 01:21:25,001
Now that we've split up, I still cherish him

1139
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:27,209
I finally understand

1140
01:21:29,959 --> 01:21:31,042
Qin Xin

1141
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:35,459
I'm clear about my choice

1142
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:39,709
You are irreplaceable

1143
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,584
Even if I have to sacrifice everything,

1144
01:21:44,459 --> 01:21:46,501
I'd still rather be with you

1145
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:48,334
and never come apart!

1146
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:51,792
I hope you know

1147
01:21:55,084 --> 01:21:57,126
in the depth of my heart,

1148
01:21:58,167 --> 01:22:00,167
you were never

1149
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,126
someone else's shadow!

1150
01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:23,542
How beautiful!

1151
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:30,584
I, Yang Lin, take thee, Tian Fang, as my wife,

1152
01:22:30,667 --> 01:22:32,626
my lifetime companion

1153
01:22:32,626 --> 01:22:34,584
and my only love

1154
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:39,251
I, Yang Lin, take thee, Tian Fang, as my wife,

1155
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:41,126
my lifetime companion

1156
01:22:41,417 --> 01:22:43,834
and my only love

1157
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:49,667
I, Tian Fang, take thee,
Yang Lin, as my husband,

1158
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:51,709
my lifetime companion

1159
01:22:52,251 --> 01:22:54,584
and my only love

1160
01:22:57,376 --> 01:22:59,459
I vow never to leave you

1161
01:22:59,834 --> 01:23:01,834
but will always follow you

1162
01:23:01,834 --> 01:23:05,084
because wherever you go, I will go too

1163
01:23:17,417 --> 01:23:19,501
Don't cast it yet...

1164
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:21,542
Her! Give it to her!

1165
01:23:35,459 --> 01:23:36,709
Xu Yuan!

1166
01:23:39,876 --> 01:23:41,167
Xu Yuan!

1167
01:23:41,501 --> 01:23:43,001
Marry me!

1168
01:23:43,459 --> 01:23:44,917
Marry me!

1169
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,001
So this is our story

1170
01:24:09,876 --> 01:24:12,084
Some might find it unrealistic

1171
01:24:12,501 --> 01:24:14,376
Some might find it ordinary

1172
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:18,792
But I think Granny was right

1173
01:24:20,501 --> 01:24:22,001
I am really like her
