153
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:17,129

of your home.

00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:38,484
You did what? Michael.

166
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:40,520
I had to, Jane.

167
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:42,889
With Kate and the bills piling
up, I really had no choice.

168
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,391
It's hard enough
these days, isn't it?

169
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:47,260
Yes. Well... Shh!

I'm so sorry.

174
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:57,436
Uh, Kate, my wife, used to
look after our finances.

175
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,939
And I've been a bit
off stride. Forgive me.

176
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,374
How much is it
that I owe you, exactly?

177
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,844
Unfortunately,
the bank is now demanding

178
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:08,247
that you pay back
the entire loan in full.

179
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:11,417
The entire loan?

180
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:12,885
Yes. It's all in the contract.

181
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:14,487
That's more than I make in
a year. I couldn't possibly.

182
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:15,955
Oh, dear.

183
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,924
You have five days.

184
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,892
If you are unable
to pay in full

185
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,628
by Friday at midnight...

186
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,730
I'm afraid we will have
to repossess your home...

187
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:26,699
and you will have to vacate
the premises.

188
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,736
But I work
for Fidelity Fiduciary.

189
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:31,471
Not as an accountant,
I presume.

190
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:33,206
No, as a teller.

191
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,407
I took a part-time position
there this past year.

192
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:35,407
You see,
I'm really an artist.

193
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:36,909
Yes, be that as it may.

194
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,245
But my father, George Banks,
was a senior partner there.

195
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:41,614
Father left us shares
in the bank.

196
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,281
You could use those
to pay off the loan.

197
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:44,550
I was saving those
for the children.

198
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,819
Shares? In the bank?

199
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,622
Well, that does change things,
doesn't it?

200
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:51,658
Primed and ready,
Mr. Binnacle?

201
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:53,559
Ready and charged, sir.

202
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,294
Do you have
the share certificate?

203
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:56,963
- I'm sorry, the what?
- FRYE: The document...

204
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:59,966
The document proving
you own shares in the bank.

205
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:01,868
I suppose it must be somewhere
among Father's old papers.

206
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:03,003
Yes, I suppose it must.

Yes. I'm afraid
he's been running

these last few years.

We'll see ourselves out.
Come along, Mr. Frye.

224
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,507
I do hope you find that share
certificate. I really do.

you'd taken out a loan?

to worry you.

I would catch up.

Well, then, we're not
going to let that happen.

But, Michael, you know we
neither of us have any money,

237
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:15,975
so we just have to find
that share certificate.

Father might have kept it?

(STAMMERS) I was just saying
you won't have to worry,

250
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:39,365
because your father
owns shares in the bank.

Well, I can make more money.

of imagination.

you had the same affliction
yourself when you were young.

- Yes, about your employment...

462
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:05,321
the truth is,
I simply can't afford...

463
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:06,723
We can settle on terms later,

464
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:08,191
although I will want
my old room back.

465
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:10,092
That's if it's not
a complete disaster...

466
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,093
and I will insist on having
every second Tuesday off.

467
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,430
- No, I'm afraid, I...
- Of course, Mary Poppins.

468
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,731
Good, good.
That's all settled.

469
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:18,534
Then I'll stay.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

themselves into dustbins.

is to see them properly
bathed and dressed.

473

Jane, have you gone
completely mad?

474
00:25:27,744 --> 00:25:29,479
I can't afford to take
on anyone else.

475
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,613

isn't just anyone.

just as much as she does!

483
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:44,160
Very well. She can stay
for the time being, I suppose.

484
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:47,731
After all, she did fly
all this way on a kite.

They always do.

quite enough of that.

Well, like Topsy said...

1550
01:15:38,802 --> 01:15:41,503

looking at things differently.

at the bank.

Oh, no, please don't worry.
I'm perfectly fine. Really.

Oh, nonsense. The bank's
just around the corner...

1874
01:32:01,388 --> 01:32:03,256
So you've been off filling
the children's heads

1875
01:32:03,257 --> 01:32:04,691
with stuff and nonsense.

1876
01:32:04,692 --> 01:32:07,427
I've heard quite enough.
Come in at once!

1877
01:32:07,428 --> 01:32:08,695
Best to take my leave.
Good night, Mary Poppins.

1878
01:32:08,696 --> 01:32:09,762
Good night, Jack.

1879
01:32:09,763 --> 01:32:10,764
Into the parlor, go on.

1880
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:13,534
Go on.

1881
01:32:17,705 --> 01:32:20,105
Don't be too hard
on 'em, sir.

1882
01:32:20,106 --> 01:32:21,774
They're only children,
after all.

1883
01:32:21,775 --> 01:32:23,610
I know they're children,
my children,

1884
01:32:23,611 --> 01:32:25,344
and I will deal with them
as I see fit.

1885
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:27,547
- Now leave us to it.
- Yes, sir.

1886
01:32:27,548 --> 01:32:29,015
Not you, Mary Poppins.
In here.

1887
01:32:29,783 --> 01:32:31,117
Very well, sir.

1888
01:32:40,227 --> 01:32:42,329
You could have
lost me my job.

1889
01:32:43,497 --> 01:32:45,632
Do you understand that?

1890
01:32:45,633 --> 01:32:48,501
Have you any idea
how difficult it is to find

1891
01:32:48,502 --> 01:32:50,803
a good position like mine
these days?

1892
01:32:50,804 --> 01:32:53,540
But there you all were,
tearing about like a...

1893
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:55,208
And you, Mary Poppins,

1894
01:32:55,209 --> 01:32:57,510
I thought you were here
to look after these children.

1895
01:32:57,511 --> 01:33:00,480
It wasn't her doing,
it was me.

1896
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:02,716
No, it was us.

1897
01:33:02,717 --> 01:33:05,285
We thought maybe
if we talked to Mr. Frye...

1898
01:33:05,286 --> 01:33:07,219
he could give you more time
to save the house.

1899
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,555
We were only
trying to help.

1900
01:33:08,556 --> 01:33:09,757
Well, you didn't help!

1901
01:33:10,824 --> 01:33:12,525
Now...

1902
01:33:12,526 --> 01:33:15,461
I know it's been a hard year
for our family...

1903
01:33:15,462 --> 01:33:17,497
and I've done all I can...

1904
01:33:17,498 --> 01:33:19,832
to keep you all from worrying,
but I can't do this on my own.

1905
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:22,635
It's too hard. I just...

1906
01:33:22,636 --> 01:33:24,537
I'm barely holding it
together as it is.

1907
01:33:24,538 --> 01:33:26,539
I can't even seem to remember
my briefcase in the morning...

1908
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,774
and there's no more time,

1909
01:33:27,775 --> 01:33:29,375
we're about to lose
our home...

1910
01:33:29,376 --> 01:33:31,211
and I can't lose this house.
I just can't.

1911
01:33:32,847 --> 01:33:34,581
I don't know what to do.

1912

(VOICE BREAKS) I'm sorry,
I don't know what to do.

Haven't we lost
enough already?

1915
01:34:00,808 --> 01:34:03,376
We haven't lost Mother.

I hope I'm as clever as you

Now, run along, wash your

to do with them

1939
01:35:49,984 --> 01:35:51,819
I never said a word.

1940
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:53,655
It was
all the children's idea.

The whole time
I've been looking after them,

1942
01:35:57,058 --> 01:35:58,425
they've been looking after me.

1943
01:35:58,426 --> 01:35:59,860
I had it all backward.

What was I thinking?

1946
01:36:06,801 --> 01:36:10,304
Some people think
a great deal too much.
