1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,680
No, my son, that's not a tactically sound

2
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,480
strategy remember our talk there could be hidden dangers here we need to stay

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,640
together strength in numbers Prince Lizard do not disrespect me I let you do

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,880
the explosion which was noisier than I would have liked I'll take it from here

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:52,400
what is your command my Queen move deeper into the lab our intel was spotted

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,520
but the serum should be on this level the flames of this burning world will

7
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,000
warm our cold blood onward until the lizard League rules all

8
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,320
the Guardians of the globe

9
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:30,720
stand down and surrender this is your only warning

10
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:43,040
heavy hitters like you are being sent in there's no telling what's house here

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,560
you won't get a chance to see are you sure about that

12
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,560
don't let them get away

13
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,920
I got him

14
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,120
come on it wanna do better than this you're not some hired cool don't waste

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:15,240
time Samson that dames a lost cause you guys just say Dame in Atlantis

16
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Darkwing not coming

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,400
red rush busy in Russia and Martian man's helping dark blood on some important

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
mission

19
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,400
sure we're fine but I called in the reservist just in case really don't let

20
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
him hear you call him that

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,400
she's mine you wish

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,240
he has a problem with the service he refused to join the team but said he'd

23
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,200
help out if needed is that not the very definition of the word you've got a lot

24
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,200
to learn

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,240
just in time

26
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,360
new suit play white thing not flashy enough for you

27
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,320
yeah the Taylor said it wasn't iconic enough apparently everyone's running

28
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,320
around with a big letter on their chest these days

29
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,320
this is

30
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,160
I only needed a diversion they're gonna bring the facility down on top of us

31
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,480
and you weren't due for two more weeks I'm sorry dr. Brandy worth I don't mean

32
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,440
to let you down I I know how important this baby is no you didn't do anything

33
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,440
wrong Polly I should have found another

34
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,960
they getting closer we have to get you to a hospital

35
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,160
yeah

36
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,680
I'm not gonna make it am I I can feel it

37
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:51,440
take care of my baby promise me you will Polly you're gonna be fine

38
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:08,160
I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I did this to you

39
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,720
Erickson there was an attack I'm getting Polly somewhere safe bring my specimen

40
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,520
back she's in labor we're headed for the Valley Hospital that child is too

41
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,320
valuable to leave her birth in the hands of civilian doctors we have a hospital

42
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,720
turn your car around no the facility's compromised we can't risk it the stress

43
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,000
she's on bring it back now you'll get your weapon and in the end you'll thank

44
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,520
me for it

45
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,040
be careful this woman is in great danger the babies are superhuman we can see

46
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,480
that we can take it from here mr. dr. Brandy worth the child about to be born

47
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,560
is unique in every conceivable way you must be ready for any

48
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,200
no

49
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:33,920
maternity where third floor Erickson

50
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:49,720
no what have you done where's the specimen they didn't survive search the

51
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,680
hospital find me the bodies go

52
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:09,120
better save some tears for yourself Randy worth you need them it's nobody's

53
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,080
fault bad things just did just happen

54
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:26,160
mr. and mrs. Wilkins we all thought she was gone but she she came back to us

55
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:36,880
what she came back all on her own we don't know how but she did your daughter

56
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
fighter

57
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,800
you've got this golden way of making my body

58
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,840
but making a

59
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,560
car

60
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Which is

61
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Just don't try to save me cause I don't wanna be saved

62
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,960
I'm one of those witches, babe

63
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm one of those witches, babe

64
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Just don't try to save me cause I don't wanna be saved

65
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Me, I've got my own little magic

66
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Sam sure loves her Legos, huh?

67
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,960
It's the only thing she'll play with

68
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Thanks, Zach. We'll be back by ten

69
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Oh, you have our number if you need anything

70
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Don't worry, Mrs. Wilkins. We'll be fine

71
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
At least you will be

72
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
I'm screwed if I don't prep for this test

73
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
You like chemistry, Sam?

74
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Then any idea why Mercury's a liquid at room temperature when it's surrounded by solids?

75
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Valence electrons

76
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Huh?

77
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Mercury's 6S valence subshell has two electrons

78
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,960
6S electrons don't like being friends with other particles

79
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,960
To be a solid, they got to be friends with each other

80
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
That's right

81
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
That's right

82
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
That's right

83
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
That's right

84
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
That's right

85
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
That's right

86
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,960
They don't like being friends with other particles

87
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
To be a solid, they got to bond

88
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
And they don't wanna

89
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
So, liquid

90
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Mercury's funny

91
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
What else do you know?

92
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Wow

93
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Mr. and Mrs. Wilkins, your daughter's a frickin' genius

94
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
No, seriously, look at this

95
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Sam's been making molecules for me

96
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Check it out

97
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
That's baking soda

98
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
This one, this one is glucose

99
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
And believe it or not, that's magnesium

100
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
I have no idea what that is, but it looks super cool

101
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
I'm gonna go get some water

102
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
I'm gonna go get some water

103
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
I'm gonna go get some water

104
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I have no idea what that is, but it looks super cool

105
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Adam, last year when Samantha kept writing letters over and over again

106
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Do you think it was this?

107
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't be absurd

108
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
She wasn't reading science textbooks

109
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
She could barely read it all

110
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
No, that's the thing

111
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
She has these molecules memorized

112
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Like she could just see them in her head

113
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Well, I think it's pretty cool

114
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
But seriously, thanks Sam

115
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm gonna ace my test

116
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Mr. P won't know what hit him

117
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Maybe Zach's right

118
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
It would explain a lot

119
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,960
He's 16, for all we know he made it all up

120
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
What if he didn't?

121
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
There are special schools

122
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
This one's for gifted kids

123
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
She's not gifted

124
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
She's just weird

125
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Public school's fine

126
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,960
The neighbor called me last week because she'd been staring at his tree for an hour

127
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Maybe she's not weird

128
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Maybe she's smart

129
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
The neighbors are talking about her?

130
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

131
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

132
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

133
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

134
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

135
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

136
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

137
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

138
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

139
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

140
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

141
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

142
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

143
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
What's the name of that school for weirdos?

144
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
What's that school for weirdos?

145
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Now concentrate on maintaining your form

146
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I said...

147
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm trying

148
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,960
Why are you still bothered with these failures of beyond me?

149
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,960
He can barely keep his skin on his bones

150
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Phase 2's abilities are still impressive.

151
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
I don't want impressive.

152
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
I want the ability to change reality.

153
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I want death on command.

154
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
I want powerful beyond measure.

155
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,960
They almost had it.

156
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Return to your tube.

157
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
You shouldn't be out for too long.

158
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
But...

159
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Go.

160
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,960
We're making progress.

161
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
You're making failures.

162
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,960
And if I don't see something different soon, you are the tube next.

163
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Hi, I'm...

164
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Samantha Wilkins, right?

165
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Um, yeah.

166
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,960
I guess you know I'm the weirdo that lives across the street from you.

167
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,960
That's what my mom said.

168
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I'm not the weirdo that lives across the street from you.

169
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I'm not the weirdo that lives across the street from you.

170
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm Bo, the even weirder weirdo who lives across the street from you.

171
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Okay, okay, my turn.

172
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Truth or dare?

173
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Truth.

174
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Tell me something you've never told anyone.

175
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Something your parents would be super pissed about.

176
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Maybe I want to run away, but I'm too scared to do it.

177
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Why?

178
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Because I'm 12 and it's scary.

179
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
I mean, why do you want to run away?

180
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
My parents think I'm a weirdo too.

181
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,960
They just want a normal kid who does her piano lessons and gets straight A's and stuff.

182
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Uh, it's their fault.

183
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,960
They put you in a special school for special kids.

184
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
That's a guaranteed weirdo making move.

185
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Yeah, but all the kids there are so boring.

186
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,960
They just want to be lawyers or doctors or astronauts or whatever.

187
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
So what do you want then?

188
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,960
I want to do something that matters.

189
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Hey, I'm serious.

190
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,960
I know. That's why it's so funny.

191
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Samantha? Samantha? Where are you?

192
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I said you could go out for an hour. It's been all day.

193
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Sorry, Mom.

194
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,960
When your mother says come home, you come home.

195
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,960
You got homework to do if you want to get your grades up.

196
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
My grades are great.

197
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,960
There's other subjects than science.

198
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Everything else is lame and boring.

199
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Your mother and I were told you were special.

200
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Silly us. We thought that meant you should go to a school for special kids.

201
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
What's so special about them anyway?

202
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,960
They don't have any fun or care about anything.

203
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
They're just a bunch of freaks.

204
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
They're freaks? Look at yourself.

205
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Isn't that why you belong there?

206
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,960
She knows I didn't mean it.

207
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Didn't you?

208
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Huh?

209
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Oh my gosh. Change back, change back, change.

210
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
I'm busy.

211
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I made you a snack, sweetie. Cream cheese and olive sandwich.

212
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Dare.

214
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
But I get to pick what it is.

215
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
And you can't tell anyone.

216
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Okay.

217
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Give me something, like anything.

218
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Experiment, right?

219
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Now it's cherry.

220
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Try it.

221
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Ew, no.

222
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Try it.

223
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
How would you do that?

224
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
It's President Val.

225
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Sam, I'm serious.

226
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
How are you doing this?

227
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,960
You know how I used to say I could like see molecules and stuff?

228
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Yeah, weirdo.

229
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Well, I can also change them around.

230
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Like move electrons from here to there. It's crazy.

231
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Change them around?

232
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Exactly. And it's not just little things like gum.

233
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
I can make stuff.

234
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
What?

235
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
Like out of thin air.

236
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Stop it.

237
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
It left you?

238
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Stop! Stop! I said stop!

239
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Sorry, I just thought it was fun.

240
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
It's not, okay? It's freaking scary.

241
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Come on, it's cool.

242
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Normal people aren't supposed to be able to do things like that.

243
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Who cares? Maybe I'm a superhero.

244
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Do you know how much fun we can have with this?

245
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
I should go home now.

246
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Wait, I'm sorry. Val? Val?

247
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Val? Val?

248
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,960
You're asking me if I'm okay

249
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:19,960
But I don't need time to process

250
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,960
All these things that make me lose my focus

251
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,960
And all these parts of me I had not noticed

252
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Before you came

253
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Oh, pink! It's your favorite color.

254
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Yeah, this dress could change that.

255
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Oh, don't be silly. It's adorable.

256
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Remember to write a thank you note to Aunt Penny.

257
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm sorry.

261
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
I'm sorry.

262
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,960
I wish you were a puppy.

263
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,960
I wish I had a puppy.

264
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Huh?

265
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Creep.

266
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Creep.

267
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Cool.

268
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Cool.

269
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
No.

270
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Yes!

271
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Cool.

272
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Cool.

273
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Cool.

274
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
This is fucked up.

275
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Why are you stealing dogs?

276
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Because no one gives a shit about dogs and they pay for them down at the lab.

277
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
You need the money or not?

278
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
I guess.

279
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
This thing's kind of mean.

280
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Spay and neuter your pets, man. Not our fault there's too many.

281
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Shit. Hurry.

282
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Keep your pants on.

283
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Hey.

284
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
What the hell?

285
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Dude, I think it's a Powerpuff girl.

286
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Shut up.

287
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
You shut up.

288
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Both of you shut up.

289
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
What are you doing?

290
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
None of your business.

291
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Doesn't look like it's your business either.

292
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Buzz off, Powerpuff. Come on, we need to get the rest.

293
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,960
If I can do that, imagine what I can do to those dumb masks you're wearing.

294
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
What now?

295
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,960
You gonna leave them squirming like turtles on their backs?

296
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Don't come any closer.

297
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Don't worry. I know who you are and what you can do.

298
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Who are you?

299
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Maybe we could speak somewhere else.

300
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Ever heard of stranger danger? Hard pass, creep.

301
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
I'm not here to hurt you.

302
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,960
I just want to talk about where you came from, where your powers came from.

303
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,960
There's no easy way to say this, but I made you, Samantha.

304
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
I know about the birds and the bees, dude.

305
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
My gross parents made me.

306
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Adam and Betsy Wilkins are not your real parents.

307
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm adopted?

308
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Man, that would explain a lot.

309
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,960
My name is Dr. Elias Brandyworth.

310
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,960
I was the assistant director of the school.

311
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,960
To Elias Brandyworth, I was the assistant director of the Pentagon's Department of Superhuman Research.

312
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Sure you were, and now you eat out of dumpsters.

313
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Yes, yeah, to stay off the grid.

314
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,960
To protect you, you were one of my projects, Samantha.

315
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,960
A superhero with almost limitless potential, but under the control of the U.S. military.

316
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,960
You're crazy. I'm leaving.

317
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,960
You can see molecules. Turn paper into stone.

318
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Feel the chemical composition of the world in your bones.

319
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,960
But you can't change people or animals, never people or animals.

320
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,960
I hid you with your parents when I realized I couldn't trust the people I worked with and how cruel your life with them would be.

321
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Then why come find me now?

322
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Because of your powers.

323
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,960
The military thinks you're dead. If they discover you're not, they'll come for you.

324
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
You must stop using them.

325
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,960
What? No, I can do things that matter. I can help people.

326
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,960
I'm begging you not to. Samantha, what's that noise?

327
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
What noise?

328
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,960
You have to go. It's not safe. Do not use your powers. Go!

329
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Eve!

330
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Mom!

331
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Where were you?

332
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Nowhere. I mean, I... snuck out.

333
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Why would you do that? I was worried sick!

334
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
I don't know. I'm sorry.

335
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,960
First you got expelled and now this.

336
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
I said I was sorry.

337
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Sorry doesn't mean sorry.

338
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
I'm sorry.

339
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
I'm sorry.

340
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
First you got expelled and now this.

341
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
I said I was sorry.

342
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Sorry doesn't cut it anymore. Your father and I have done everything for you.

343
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Sent you to a special school, looked the other way with these odd little habits of yours. Why can't you just be...

344
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Normal.

345
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Now that's not what I said.

346
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
It's what you meant.

347
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Oh, Eve.

348
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,960
I just want to go to sleep.

349
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,960
I love you, Samantha. I do, but I wish you'd try harder sometimes.

350
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,960
We sent a drone out after our sensors got pinged, but we lost contact after she flew away.

351
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
It's her.

352
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
We don't know that.

353
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
It's her!

354
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
It's her!

355
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Old man, white hair, grubby clothes. Have you seen him?

356
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Are you sure he isn't here?

357
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Yes, I looked twice. He's not here.

358
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I'm sure he's not here.

359
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Nice soul patch, bro. Makes your face extra punchable.

360
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Get out of my way, kid.

361
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Sure. Once you give that all back, and sit down nicely and wait for the police.

362
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,960
The name's Kill Cannon. Not gets beat up by little girls, Cannon.

363
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Then I guess you'll need to go down to City Hall and get it changed.

364
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
The hell?

365
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,960
You're gonna regret that.

366
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,960
You're gonna regret that.

367
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,960
You're gonna regret that.

368
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,960
You're gonna regret that.

369
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,960
You're gonna regret that.

370
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,960
You're gonna regret that.

371
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,960
Sorry kid, you're just not made for this.

372
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,960
I literally was.

373
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Jerk.

374
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Samantha.

375
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
How do you keep doing that?

376
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
I have a lot of time on my hands.

377
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,960
But you didn't listen to me. You can't use your powers, Samantha. You can't.

378
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,960
It's Adam Eve when I'm in costume.

379
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Adam Eve? Why'd you come up with that?

380
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Adam, because duh. Eve, because it's my middle name.

381
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Cute.

382
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,960
No, the cape is cute. The name is awesome.

383
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,960
I wish I could say the same for your actions.

384
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,960
What? I'm a freaking badass.

385
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Not quite what I mean. When I heard the fighting, I was afraid you might be using your powers.

386
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,960
What, you don't even take a day off on your birthday?

387
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,960
How do you know it's my birthday? My parents didn't even remember.

388
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,960
I was there, you know. It was an important day for me too.

389
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,960
You told me that before, but I don't think I got all the details.

390
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Trade you a burger for some answers.

391
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Tell me about my parents. My real parents.

392
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,960
You said I was adopted, so who was my real dad?

393
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
I didn't know your father.

394
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Okay, then my mom. Was she your science partner or something? Is that where I got my smarts?

395
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Yes, that's exactly it.

396
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,960
She was a valued colleague. She volunteered her pregnancy for an experimental procedure.

397
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
What procedure?

398
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:56,960
We manipulated her amniotic fluid, induced controlled mutational change, flooded her system with rapidly decaying particles.

399
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,960
I monitored her around the clock as she approached turn.

400
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,960
We became close. She begged me to make sure you had a life.

401
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,960
That you didn't grow up in a lab alone.

402
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,960
That was when I first realized you weren't just an experiment or a weapon.

403
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,960
I was making a terrible mistake.

404
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,960
I made plans to get her out, help her run away, but she went into labor early.

405
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:37,960
We saved you, but a normal life. That's all she would have wanted for you. A normal life.

406
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,960
We'll pick this up later.

407
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,960
If you keep doing this, they're going to find you.

408
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,960
I'm wearing a mask. I'm using a fake name. I'm apparently a government-designed superweapon. I'll be fine.

409
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Whoa.

410
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Fall back and form a perimeter or something.

411
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:35,960
What? Get the hell out of here.

412
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
We'll fall back and form a perimeter.

413
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Great idea.

414
00:35:49,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Get off of me.

415
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
What? What's happening?

416
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,960
It's hard for us. We're not perfect, like you.

417
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Who are you?

418
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,960
You don't know?

419
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I have to speak for our siblings. They've never been out of their tanks long enough to learn to talk.

420
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Our siblings?

421
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Your phase one, phase two, phase three, phase four, phase five. Each attempt less successful than the last, but all one big happy family.

422
00:36:49,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Okay, so you're less good versions of me. Then this should be easy.

423
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:42,960
Okay.

424
00:37:42,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Okay.

425
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Look what you're doing.

426
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:29,960
What I'm doing? I didn't start this. I don't even want to do this.

427
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Then die already.

428
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Okay.

429
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:41,960
What are you doing?

430
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
We're going to die.

431
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Oh, thank God.

432
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:51,960
It's a shame we had to fight like this, sister. We could have been a family together. Wouldn't that have been nice?

433
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,960
Sure. We could have all moved in with Dr. Brandyworth. One big freak family.

434
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Brandyworth. He's not our family. We're the best they could make without him.

435
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:28,960
They talk about us like we're not there. Not real. Don't matter. All we hear is how perfect you are. And how perfect we aren't.

436
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Look who it is.

437
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,960
You actually like this monster?

438
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:09,960
No!

439
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Thank you.

440
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,960
They can change into things. Alter their bodies. I can't do any of that.

441
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:39,960
They wanted you to be a perfect weapon. But even I have a conscience. I implanted a subconscious block to prevent you from altering living tissue. You were perfect, but with limits. I wasn't there to do the same with them.

442
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Get up.

443
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Look at me.

444
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Look at me!

445
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Wait! No!

446
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,960
Help him!

447
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,960
I can't.

448
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,960
I'm sorry.

449
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Believe.

450
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:42,960
I wish everything was different for us.

451
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,960
They killed themselves. Trying to hurt me.

452
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Samantha! We have to... Samantha!

453
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:08,960
Brandyworth. What a treat. Didn't think you'd crawl out from under your rock as well.

454
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,960
You have to let her go. She's just a child.

455
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,960
No, she's a weapon. My weapon. And it's taken me years to get her back.

456
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,960
I'll come back. I'll make you someone else.

457
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,960
You are back, Dr. Brandyworth. And you will make me more weapons like her.

458
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,960
Hey! Let him go and I'll stay.

459
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:41,960
The man who tore you from your mother's womb and you want to save him? Adorable. But no. We have plans for both of you.

460
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:50,960
I said you could have me.

461
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,960
And not him.

462
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,960
I told you those restraints were theoretical.

463
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,960
Go on. Do something else you'll regret.

464
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,960
You just told me how valuable he was, stupid.

465
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,960
I did. But now that I have Brandyworth, his research partner isn't needed anymore.

466
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:25,960
Are you sure? Do it!

467
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Who... who is that?

468
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,960
Where do you think all your brothers and sisters came from?

469
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Oh, that's...

470
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
Good old mom.

471
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,960
Oh, God! She's alive!

472
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Technically alive. We didn't get her back up and running in time to save her from massive brain damage.

473
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:56,960
But, well, we both know she only had one use anyway.

474
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:15,960
You monster!

475
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,960
No!

476
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,960
Do something!

477
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:32,960
She was barely alive to begin with.

478
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,960
Damn it! That was an accident.

479
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,960
You murdered my whole family.

480
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,960
Eve, calm down.

481
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:58,960
You murdered my whole family!

482
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:06,960
I see it all now. Every single molecule around us. I can touch them, taste them, control them.

483
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,960
I could rearrange your cells to make you all new people from the monsters you are.

484
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,960
You ruined my life. You took everything from me. Killed people I didn't even know I loved.

485
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:37,960
I am Samantha Eve Wilkin, and I defy you to even remember who I am!

486
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:56,960
Do you see yourself? Do you see yourself unraveling?

487
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,960
Do you know?

488
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:08,960
That two thoughts were always mine?

489
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,960
What? Where am I?

490
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:24,960
Where before this? Where before this was I traveling home?

491
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,960
Was this always?

492
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:48,960
Was this always by desire?

493
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,960
Oh, God.

494
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,960
And where have you been?

495
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,960
Adam, wait.

496
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,960
Don't stick up for her. She's late for her own birthday. You couldn't even call.

497
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,960
Did you eat my cake?

498
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,960
How dare you?

499
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,960
I need to go.

500
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Go? Go where? Hey, like it or not, we're the only family you've got.

501
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Samantha, please come out. It's your birthday. Let's try again.

502
00:49:51,960 --> 00:50:04,960
Only what I've got.

503
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:26,960
Oh, Sam. Oh, it's okay, dear. It's all going to be okay. We'll promise.

504
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,960
You're home early.

505
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,960
Yeah, light day.

506
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Dad, Dad, look, I'm going to be duct tape man. Like, even if I don't get powers, I could just tie people up with duct tape. You can do anything with duct tape.

507
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,960
I don't know if that's going to work as well as you hope it will, kiddo.

508
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:06,960
And you might rethink that as we peel all this off. Go upstairs and run a bath. That should help.

509
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
A little.

510
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,960
That boy is never getting his powers, is he?

511
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:26,960
Don't ask me. You're the superhero space alien. But even if he doesn't, we'll love him just as much. Finish dinner while I untape the boy.

512
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:24,960
Okay.

513
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,960
You

514
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,960
You

515
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,960
You

516
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,960
You

517
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,960
You

518
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,960
You

519
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,960
You
