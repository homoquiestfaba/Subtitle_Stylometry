00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,390
Based On A Made-Up Story
In<I> The Weekly Secret.

186
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:13,693
I Think We Need To Look
At The Bigger Picture
Here, Lynette.

187
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:15,062
Excuse Me?

188
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:16,797
Since When Do You
Call Me Lynette?

189
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,564
I'm Just Trying
To Dialog Here.

190
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:19,699
You're 13 Years Old.

191
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,101
You Don't Dialog.

192
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,568
And The Bigger Picture Is

193
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,071
I Told You
To Do Your Homework

194
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:25,238
And You Didn't Do It.

195
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,573
I Got A Handle On It.

196
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:29,443
No, You Don't.
You're Too Young
To Have A Handle On It.

197
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:30,777
I'm Not A Baby.

198
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,079
No, But You Are A Kid,

199
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:34,747
And You're
Part Of This Family,

200
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,315
And The Rule
In This Family Is

201
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:38,919
If You Don't Do Your Homework,
You're Grounded.

202
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:40,053
Mom!

203
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,388
Busted.

204
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,388
Just For The Weekend.

205
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:43,624
But Duffy
Got Backstage Passes

206
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:44,924
To The Headless Horsemen
Concert!

207
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,592
Well, Then I Hope
Duffy Did His Homework.

208
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:48,562
No, I Mean,
Duffy Got Me One, Too.

209
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:49,963
Please May I
Have Your Permission

210
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:52,966
To Attend
A Once-In-A-Lifetime
Musical Event.

211
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:55,068
Can't Talk Your Way
Out Of This One.

212
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,803
Excuse Me.

213
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:58,404
This Is Between
Your Brother And Me.

214
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,073
You Know What?
You're Right.

215
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:01,140
I Should Be Grounded.

216
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,275
Just Not
For This Weekend,

217
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,276
So Tell You What.

218
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,011
Instead Of Grounding Me
For The Weekend,

219
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,413
Ground Me
For The Whole Week--

220
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:09,116
No Tv, No Computer,
No Nothing.

221
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,620
We'll Just Start Sunday.
How's That Sound?

222
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:15,322
Please?

223
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,624
Sorry.
That's The Way It Is.

224
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:19,525
[Sighs]

225
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,996
Enjoy Your Weekend,
Dweeb.

226
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,996
Grr.

227
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,365
You Know What, Chelsea?

228
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,534
Just For That Remark,
You're Grounded, Too.

229
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:28,602
But, Mom, You Can't.

230
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:30,136
I've Got A Date
With Peter Tomorrow Night.

231
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,705
Well, Maybe If I Lock
The Two Of You Up Together,

232
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:34,407
You'll Learn To Get Along.

233
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:54,560
I Am Such A Genius.

234
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:58,532
Don't You Knock?

235
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,635
Lay Off.
Mom Grounded Me, Too,
Remember?

236
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:05,105
Yeah, But I Think
I Might Have A Way
Out Of It.

237
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:08,674
What's On Your Mind?

238
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,510
Well, See,
If We Could Get Mom
On A Date Tomorrow Night,

239
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:14,146
Well, She'll Go Out,
Then We'll Go Out,

240
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:16,882
And We'll Come Home,
Then Mom Comes Home.

241
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:18,651
I Get To Go To My Concert,
And, Well,

242
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:19,719
You Get To Go Out
With Peter--

243
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:20,886
Who, By The Way,
Is A Loser--

244
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:23,656
And, Uh,
Mom Never Has To Know.

245
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,359
Yeah, But Mom Hasn't
Been On A Date Since--

246
00:12:26,393 --> 00:12:29,062
Well, Since
She And Dad Split Up.

247
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,764
Yeah, But
Look At All These Ads.

248
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:32,499
There's Got To Be
Someone In Here For Mom.

249
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:35,067
And How Are You Gonna
Get To Him Before Tomorrow?

250
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,736
Well, Excuse Me, Chels,

251
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,572
But Isn't This
The 21st Century?

252
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:41,541
Every Guy In Here
Has An E-Mail Address.

253
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:44,077
You Can't E-Mail
Some Guy You've Never Met.

254
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,912
Well, Why Not?
I Mean It's Not Like

255
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:47,513
He's Some Creep
In A Chat Room.

256
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:50,384
All These Guys Have Come
Pre-Checked By The Newspaper.

257
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:54,221
Why Don't I Feel Better
About This?

258
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:55,688
All Right, Look.
We'll Find Some Guy

259
00:12:55,722 --> 00:12:57,090
And Set Up A Meeting
In Public,

260
00:12:57,122 --> 00:13:00,393
Or You Can
Just Call Up Peter

261
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:02,696
And Tell Him That You
Have To Stay Home All Weekend

262
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,264
To Play Fish
With Your Little Brother.

263
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:06,567
Give Me That.

264
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,736

What's "Incarcerated"?

271
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,083
It Means He's In Jail.

00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,452

No, No.
Entirely My Fault.
I Do Apologize.

362
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:11,837
No Permanent Damage
Done, I Trust.

363
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,174
No, There's Not.
Um, Mom, There's--

364
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,675
Lynette: I Don't Know.
Was This Dented Before?

365
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,512
Oh, Uh, Perhaps We Should
Exchange Driver's Licenses.

366
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,916
Uh, No. Mom,
There's Something
I Really--

367
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,384
Come On.

368
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,351
What About Wolfsbane?

369
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:28,253
Can't You See
What's Going On?

370
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,356
Mom's Making
A Love Connection.

371
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,725
Are You Crazy?
This Guy's A Nut.

372
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,928
He Thinks He's
In The Parking Lot.

373
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:37,197
[Laughing]

374
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,566
He's Flirting,
You Dweeb.

375
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:41,902
And Mom's
Going For It.

376
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:46,739
Adam, Chelsea,

377
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,408
This Is Dimitri,
Uh--Dentatos.

378
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:52,278
Right. Dentatos.
It's Romanian...

379
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,746
Or Maybe Hungarian.

380
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,415
So, Dimitri, My Mom's
Something, Ain't She?

381
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:57,717
Smart, Funny, Beautiful.

382
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,453
You Know,
She Used To Sing
In A Rock-And-Roll Band.

383
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:02,588
Oh, Is That So?

384
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:04,289
About A Million
Years Ago.

385
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:06,759
Chelsea: So, Um, Dimitri,
Come Here Often?

386
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:07,760
Dimitri: No,
Actually, I Don't.

387
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:09,395
I'm New
To The Neighborhood.

388
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:11,231
I'm Restoring
The Old Mather House

389
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,464
Down By The Lake.

390
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:16,135
Oh, Man.
That--That Place Is
Supposed To Be Haunted.

391
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:17,569
Oh, You'll
Have To Excuse Adam.

392
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:19,404
He's Kind Of Got A Thing
About Monsters.

393
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:20,839
Dimitri: Oh, Really?

394
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:23,409
So Did You See<I>
Revenge Of Count Krelski
Last Night?

395
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:25,912
Actually...

396
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:27,146
No.

397
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,414
My Mom, She--She
Made Me Turn It Off.

398
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:32,518
Oh, Well, I'm Sure
She Had A Good Reason.

399
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,852
Thank You.

400
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:36,755
So, Lynette, Are You, Uh,
Headed For The Registers?

401
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:37,757
Didn't You Guys Want
To Get Something Else?

402
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,291
No. No.

403
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,291
No. No.

404
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:42,962
No, Uh, We're Fine,
Though, So, Uh,
Let-Let's Go.

405
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,933

Nice Try, Taylor.

[Pager Beeping]

407
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:58,711
So You're A Doctor?

00:19:58,743 --> 00:19:59,712
That's Right.

00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,616
Yeah, You Know,
Between Working Nights

00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:05,184
And Sleeping
During The Day,

412
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:06,820
I Barely Get A Chance
To Grocery Shop.

413
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:09,055
But You Know What?

414
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,690
I'm Glad I Did.

00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm Busy. What Is It?

417
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:25,105
I'm Still Looking.

418
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:28,875
All My Readings
Indicate This Location.

419
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:30,242
You Know, Lynette,

420
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:32,879
I'm Due Some Time Off
From The Hospital, So...

421
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:35,715
What Do Doctors Do
On Their Time Off?

422
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:38,051
Well, I Can't Speak
For The Medical Profession

423
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:40,086
As A Whole,
Of Course, But I--

424
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,888
I'm Sorry.
What Am I Saying?

425
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,156
You're Married.

426
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,658
Oh, No, Actually,
I'm Divorced.

427
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,494
Oh, Really?

428
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:52,398
Well, In That Case,
Would You Do Me The Honor

429
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:56,068
Of Having Dinner With Me
Tomorrow Night?

430
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:57,536
Oh, I Don't Know.

431
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,405
I Mean,
You Seem Sort Of...

432
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:05,245
Oh, What Am I Saying?

433
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:06,511
Why Not?

434
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,514
I Mean, I Don't Mean
"Why Not" As In
"I Don't Care,"

435
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:11,416
I Mean "Why Not"
As In
"Why Shouldn't I?"

436
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,721
So Can I Take That
As A Yes?

437
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:17,222
Yes.

438
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,893
Good.

439
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,928
No, I Am So Close
I Can Taste It.

440
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:24,529
There's A Vampire
In That Market,

441
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:26,465
And I'm Gonna Find Him.

442

Lynette: That's It.
I Don't Want To Hear

From This Family.

That's How.

447
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,731
So What Time Are You
Gonna Pick Me Up?

448
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:00,465
Forget What I Said
Before, Duffy.

449
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:01,800
I Can Go To The Concert.

450
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:05,772
What?! How Could You Give
My Backstage Pass To Boomer?!

451
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:07,507
I Know What I Said Before,

452
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:08,641
But, I Mean--

453
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:09,908
But--

454
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,077
We Gotta Meet.

455
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:13,478
No, You, Me, And Boomer.

456
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:15,115
Bye.

457
00:22:20,618 --> 00:22:22,254
That's All I've Got.

458
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:24,289
Well,
It's Not Enough.

459
00:22:24,322 --> 00:22:25,590
This Is Kid Stuff.

460
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:28,594
How Could You Give
My Backstage Pass
To Boomer?!

461
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,829
I Thought You Said
You Weren't Going.

462
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:32,097
But Here's
What I Don't Get.

463
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:33,866
Why Boomer?

464
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:36,101
I Mean,
He's A Tenth-Grader

465
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:38,037
Who Hasn't
Done Anything For Us

466
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:40,039
Except
Take Our Lunch Money.

467
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,541
I Figured
This Would Be A Step

468
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:44,844
Toward Better
Playground Relations.

469
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:47,046
Yeah. Me And Duffy
Are Friends Now.

470
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:49,214

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,221
On A Certain
High School Girl,

474
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:56,822
Who, Until Now,
You Thought Of

475
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:59,125
As--As Unattainable.

476
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:01,961
You Got A Crush
On Somebody?

477
00:23:01,993 --> 00:23:04,896
Uh, What's Unattainable?

478
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,567
Well, It Means
You Didn't Stand A Chance,

479
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,734
But Consider This:

480
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:11,704
You--You Happen To Know
Her Brother.

481
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,075
You Can Get Me A Date
With Chelsea?

482
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:17,743
You Like
Chelsea Hansen?

483
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:21,547
Come On.
She Is My Sister.

484
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:24,049
Yeah, But It's Got
To Be Like A Real Date.

485
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,519
Like, Uh, First We'll Go
To A Kung-Fu Movie,

486
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:28,221
And Then We'll Come
Back Here For Burgers.

487
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:30,689
Done.

488
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:34,193
And, Uh, I Got To Get
To Kiss Her Good Night.

489
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:37,729
Oh, I, Uh,
I Can't Guarantee That.

490
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:39,664
Oh, Well,

491
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:42,701
Then I Can't
Guarantee This.

492
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,039
Ok, A Kiss.

493
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:49,308
On The Lips.

494
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:53,812
Ok. A Kiss On The Lips.

495
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:24,543
If A Guy
Turns Into A Bat,

496
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:26,479
He's A Vampire,
Isn't He?

497
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:29,615
Yeah, That'd Do It.

498
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:31,116
Is That Bad?

499
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:32,918
Well, Only If
He's After You.

500
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:34,420
Then You're Toast.

501
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,055
He Turns You Into Toast?

502
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:39,925
No, He Turns You
Into A Mindless Minion
Of The Undead.

503
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,727
All Right, Look.

504
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,663
This Vampire
Finds Some Pretty Girl,

505
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:44,797
Then Turns On His Charm,

506
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,665
And Then When The Girl
Falls For Him,

507
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:48,167
He Takes Her Home,

508
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,168
Puts Her In A Trance,

509
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:50,569
Then Chomp!

510
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:52,337
But Sometimes The Wimpy
Hero-Guy Shows Up

511
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,338
And They Start To Fight.

512
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:54,907
And Then If
There's Gonna Be A Sequel,

513
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,008
The Vampire Gets Away.

514
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,009
Wait!

515
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,011
What About The Girl
In The Trance?

516
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,647
It's All About True Love.

517
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,083
You Know,
It's Like This Girl
Just Has So Much Love

518
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:05,818
For This Foofy-Shirt
Hero Guy,

519
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,353
That, Well,
She Gets Out Of The Trance.

520
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:10,956
Like That
Could Beat A Vampire.

521
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,497
I'm Going Backstage.

522
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,464
I Don't Believe It!

523
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:21,334
What Did You Have To Do
For Boomer?

524
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:22,934
Oh, Yeah, Well,

525
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:24,737
I'll Tell You Later.

526
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:31,711
How Do You
Stop A Vampire?

527
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:35,548
Oh, Well, Uh, Don't
Invite Him Into Your House

528
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,949
Or You Could Stab Him
With A Stake

529
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:39,519
Or You Could
Steal Their Coffin

530
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:40,819
And Keep It
Till Sunrise.

531
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:43,055
That's What Happened In<I>
The House Of Frankenstein.

532
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:44,523
Well, Kinda.

533
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:46,025
I'm Not Talking
About A Movie.

534
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:48,059
I'm Talking
A Real-Life Vampire.

535

00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:54,338
Well, You Don't Know Me.
We Just Met.

712
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:55,574
No, That's True.

713
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:58,844
Well, Maybe I Don't
Know Who You Are,

714
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:01,246
But I Do Know
Who You Could Be.

715
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:04,049
And Maybe,
Just Maybe,

716
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:06,184
That's What Tonight
Is All About.

717
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:08,486
Maybe!

718
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:26,204
You Know, If This
Had Happened Next Summer,

719
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:27,438
I Could Have Driven.

720
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:28,740
Yeah, Well,
It Didn't.

721
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,442
Come On, We're
Almost There,
All Right?

722
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:49,828
May I Interest You
In A Bottle Of Wine?

723
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,563
I Don't
Drink...Wine.

724
00:35:51,596 --> 00:35:53,931
I Think
We'll Just Stick
With Water For Now.

725
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:55,067
Perhaps
Some Garlic Bread--

726
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,335
No! Thank You.

727
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,777
There He Is!
Come On.

728
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:20,692
Chelsea:
What Is With You?

729
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:21,927
I'm Not Going
To Let Dimitri

730
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,262
Turn Mom Into An Onion.

731
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,164
A Minion! I Told Him
That Vampires
Turn People

732
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,933
Into<I> Minions
Of The Undead.

733
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:31,369
Why Am I Not
Surprised That
This Is Your Fault?

734
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:33,671
[Sighs] Come On,
Squirt. We Gotta
Take You Home.

735
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:35,940
Tiffany's Probably
Waiting At The House
Right Now.

736
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:37,376
You Called
A Baby-Sitter?

737
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:40,212
Come On,
You Like Tiffany!
You Said So.

738
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:42,681
Yeah, Besides, Chelsea
And I Got Places To Go.

739
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:43,882
You're Gonna Let
A Vampire Get Mom

740
00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:45,217
Just Because
You Wanna Go Out?

741
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,385
All Right,
All Right, Look.

742
00:36:46,418 --> 00:36:48,020
I'm The Monster
Master, Right?

743
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:49,020
Yeah.

744
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:50,521
Vampires, Werewolves,

745
00:36:50,554 --> 00:36:51,789
Evil Robots From Space,

746
00:36:51,822 --> 00:36:53,491
I Can Spot Them
A Mile Off.

747
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:55,760
And Dimitri
Is Not A Vampire.

748
00:36:57,262 --> 00:36:59,498
You Guys Set This Up
So You Could Go Out.

749
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,333
This Was<I> Your Fault!

750
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:05,236
Ok, So We Did!
So What, I Mean--

751
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,072
It's Not
Gonna Kill Mom
To Go On A Date.

752
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:10,242
Yes, It Is Because
Dimitri's A Vampire!

753
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:11,343
All Right, Look.

754
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,710
I'm Gonna Go In There

755
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:14,546
And Find Out
If This Guy's
Really A Vampire.

756
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,248
If He Is,
He's Dead Meat,

757
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,183
And If He's Not,
You Have To Go Home,

758
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:20,418
Put Your Jammies On,
And Hang Out
With, Uh, Tiffany.

759
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:22,386
<I> And Not Tell Mom
That We Went Out.

760
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,558
Do We Have A Deal?

761
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,059
Ok, Deal.

762
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:29,560
You Better Know
What You're
Doing.

763
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:31,730
Don't Worry.
I Got It Wired.

764
00:37:31,762 --> 00:37:33,898
Come On.

765
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:36,568
[Dimitri
Speaking Softly]

766
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:44,842
Hey, Mom, Dimitri.
How You Guys Going?

767
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,611
Lynette: What Are
You Guys Doing Here?

768
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:47,779
Is Everything Ok?

769
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:48,779
Oh, Everything's
Fine.

770
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:49,847
I Just Wanted
To Apologize

771
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,516
For Watching
That Movie
Last Night.

772
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,919
I Think
It Got To Taylor.

773
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,553
He's A Vampire.

774
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:57,222
A Vampire? Who Is?

775
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,289
It's My Fault

776
00:37:58,322 --> 00:38:00,125
For Letting Him
Watch The Movie.

777
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:01,460
He's Got It In
His Head That, Well,

778
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:02,860
Dimitri Here
Is A Vampire,

779
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:05,062
Which We All
Know He's Not,

780
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:08,065
But Instead
Of Telling Taylor Here
That He-He's Crazy

781
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,270
And Give Him A Lifetime
Of Self-Image Problems--

782
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:12,971
We Have To Prove
I'm Not A Vampire.

783
00:38:13,003 --> 00:38:14,906
You Know, Maybe
I Should Go Home.

784
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,441
No! No, No, I Mean,

785
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:17,809
It's Just That
You Can't Because--

786
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,478
I Think What
Adam's Trying To Say

787
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,279
Is If You Go Home Now

788
00:38:21,313 --> 00:38:23,248
Then Taylor's Gonna
Spend The Rest Of His Life

789
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,150
Thinking
I Was A Vampire.

790
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:28,454
Right, Right! We Need
Some Sort Of Test.

791
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:32,424
[Gravely]
The Spoon Test.

792
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:34,425
The Spoon Test?

793
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:37,561
Right! The Spoon
Test, Right!

794
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:40,398
A Vampire Can't--Uh--

795
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:42,934
That's Right.
Hang A Spoon On His Nose.

796
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,404
Right, Right. The Old
Transylvanian Test.

797
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:47,405
Really?

798
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:48,639
So You Mean
You're Gonna

799
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:51,175
Make Me Take
The Spoon Test?

800
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:54,112
You've Got No Choice.

801
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:56,480
But--But If I'm
Really A Vampire, Then--

802
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:59,418
That's Right.
You'll Explode
Into A Million Pieces.

803
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:00,751
The Entire Restaurant
Will Be Sprayed

804
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:01,920
With Your
Bloody Chunks

805
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:06,291
Of Vampire...
Festering...Flesh.

806
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:09,193
Wow.

807
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:10,929
I Think
It's A Chance
We've Gotta Take.

808
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:13,264
Maybe I Should Get
Some Extra Napkins,
Just In Case.

809
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:15,433
Hand Me The Spoon.

810
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:19,570
Sure. Right.
This Would Be It.

811
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:34,118
[Adam Sighs]

812
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:35,787
Am I All Right?
Am I Still Here?

813
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,788
You're Still Here.

814
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,056
Oh, Thank Goodness!

815
00:39:38,088 --> 00:39:39,958
There, You See?

816
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:42,927
I Guess I'm Not
A Vampire. [Chuckling]

817
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:48,133
Ok. Sorry.

818
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,835
Are You Sure
You're Ok,
Honey?

819
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:51,402
Yep.
Everything's Fine.

820
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:55,073
Fire's Out. See,
If You'd Come Home Now,
He'd Feel Terrible,

821
00:39:55,105 --> 00:39:56,241
Wouldn't You?
Of Course You Would.

822
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:58,376
So, Um, You Know What,
We're Gonna Leave.

823
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:00,878
So, Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dimitri.

824
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:01,913
You Guys Have Fun.
Good Night

825
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:04,215
And See You Later--

826
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:15,094
[Snickering]
Bye-Bye!

827
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:26,104
Adam Did The Spoon
Test. Dimitri's
Not A Vampire.

828
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:28,106
Yeah, We Gotta
Go, Taylor.

829
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:30,909
You Were Really Good
With The Kids.

830
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:32,943
Well,
I Love Children.

831
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:34,212
I Think
They're Sweet.

832
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:36,248
Well, I Wouldn't
Call My Kids Sweet,

833
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,583
But They Are
Good Kids.

834
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:39,751
Well, You've
Obviously Done

835
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:41,453
A Very Good Job
With Them.

836
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:44,255
I Don't Know.
Sometimes
I'm Not So Sure.

837
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,358
Well, I Am, Lynette.

838
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:50,361
You Know, I See
A Power In You,
Lynette.

839
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:52,431
No, No,
Maybe Not A Power.

840
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:56,067
More Like A--A Fire.

841
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:59,304
Just Smoldering
Just Beneath
The Surface.

842
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:06,078
I Think It Might
Be Time To Let
That Fire Burn.

843
00:41:23,927 --> 00:41:25,063
Hi, Tiffany.

844
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:26,898
Hey, Taylor-Made.
How's It Going, Kiddo?

845
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,133
Great.

846
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:31,637
Wait Just A Second.
Bye, Taylor, See You!

847
00:41:34,204 --> 00:41:35,674
Can I Put My Bike
Away, Please?

848
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:36,942
No.

849
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,175
What Is
With You Anyway?

850
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,844
We Have To Get Back
To The Restaurant.

851
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:41,646
Peter Will Be Here
In, Like,
10 Minutes!

852
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,249
Forget About Peter!
Dimitri's A Vampire.
I Saw Him.

853
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:45,750
I Mean,
I Didn't See Him.

854
00:41:45,782 --> 00:41:46,750
In The Mirror
At The Restaurant.

855
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:48,286
Yeah, Right.

856
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:50,489
No, I'm Serious!
The Guy Didn't Reflect
In The Mirror.

857
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:52,424
Just Mom And Nothing.

858
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:54,492
Come On. We Gotta
Get Her Out Of There.

859
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:56,127
If He Was A Vampire,

860
00:41:56,161 --> 00:41:59,063
Wouldn't He
Be A Little Bit
More...Evil?

861
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:01,165
He's Trying To Make Her
Fall In Love With Him.

862
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,767
If She Goes To Him
Willingly,

863
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,603
Then She's,
Well, His Forever.

864
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:05,971
You're Going
To Miss Your Concert

865
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,139
And Screw Up
My Date.

866
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:10,007
If We Don't Do Something,
Mom's Had It!

867
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,977
Please, You've
Gotta Believe Me.

868
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:13,043
Well, I Don't!

869
00:42:13,076 --> 00:42:14,311
But What If I'm Right?

870
00:42:14,344 --> 00:42:16,013
Come On, Chels.

871
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,884
I Need You.

872
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,719
I Hate You
Right Now.

873
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:22,052
You Know That,
Don't You?

874
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:24,388
I'm Ok With That.

875
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:26,425
[Wolf Howling]

876
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:31,362
That Place Was Great.
Thank You.

877
00:42:31,396 --> 00:42:33,064
No, Thank You.

878
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:34,231
So Shall We?

879
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:35,299
There's More?

880
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,836
Well, Of Course.
It Just Gets Better.

881
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:40,038
Ok. Where To?

882
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,405
Well, I Thought
Maybe We'd Find

883
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:42,840

1229
01:01:35,971 --> 01:01:38,207
Wait, Adam. I See Them.

1230
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:40,244
They're Getting Off
The Scrambler.

1231
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:44,615
I See Them.

1232
01:01:44,648 --> 01:01:46,216
Wasn't That Fun?

1233
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:48,618
Oh, It's All Been Fun.
Tons Of Fun.

1234
01:01:48,652 --> 01:01:52,289
But Now, It's Time
To Leave All This Behind.

1235
01:01:52,322 --> 01:01:53,891
What Are You
Talking About?

1236
01:01:53,924 --> 01:01:56,192
I'm Talking About
Forever, Lynette.

1237
01:01:57,027 --> 01:01:59,496
Whoa. Slow Down
There, Cowboy.

1238
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:01,465
Look, Tonight
Has Been Terrific.

1239
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:04,068
I Mean, I Really Feel
Like I Met Someone.

1240
01:02:04,101 --> 01:02:06,637
An Old Friend
That I Never Thought
I'd See Again.

1241
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:08,005
Well, It's Natural
You Feel That Way.

1242
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:11,541
That's--
That's The Depth
Of Our Connection.

1243
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:13,710
No, I Don't Mean You.

1244
01:02:13,744 --> 01:02:15,346
I Mean Me.

1245
01:02:15,378 --> 01:02:17,246
[Huffs]

1246
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,084
But You--You Must
Feel Some Deep,

1247
01:02:20,117 --> 01:02:21,919
Powerful Attraction
To Me?

1248
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,654
I'm Sorry, Dmitri.

1249
01:02:24,688 --> 01:02:27,224
It's Just Some People
Just Don't Click.

1250
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:29,259
I Mean, I Had
A Terrific Time.

1251
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:33,163
I Just Feel Like
Who I Want To Be
And Who You Are,

1252
01:02:33,195 --> 01:02:35,833
They're Very Different.

1253
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:37,768
How About
The Bumper Cars?

1254
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,001
No!

1255
01:02:39,034 --> 01:02:40,770
I Don't Think So.

1256
01:02:42,773 --> 01:02:46,376
I Hate This Place.
I Hate Hillbilly Music.

1257
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:49,045
I'm Tired,
And I'm Hungry.

1258
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:51,215
It's Time
To Go Home.

1259
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:54,117
Adam, What's Happening?

1260
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,552
I Think Something's Wrong.

1261
01:02:56,585 --> 01:02:58,254
Chelsea: Then Do Something.

1262
01:02:59,922 --> 01:03:00,924
What Are You--

1263
01:03:00,956 --> 01:03:03,192
Look Into My Eyes.

1264
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:05,896
You Are Powerless
To Resist Me.

1265
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:08,799
You're Mine,
Lynette.

1266
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:17,974
Oh, Boy.

1267
01:03:19,576 --> 01:03:20,911
[Hisses]

1268
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:25,382
Hello, Adam.
Looking For Me?

1269
01:03:25,414 --> 01:03:26,617
Ow.

1270
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:31,154
Buddy, Come On.
Hurry Up.

1271
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:35,759
Now, What Are You
Doing Here?

1272
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:37,760
I Want You To Leave
My Mother Alone.

1273
01:03:37,793 --> 01:03:40,297
But, Adam,
I Don't Understand.

1274
01:03:40,329 --> 01:03:41,965
You Sent For Me.

1275
01:03:41,998 --> 01:03:43,166
That's Not True.

1276
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:45,602
Aren't You The One
That Sent The E-Mail?

1277
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:48,739
You're Wolfsbane?

1278
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:51,741
Yes. I Know.

1279
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:55,780
All The Good Vampire Names
Have Been Taken By Teenagers.

1280
01:03:56,612 --> 01:03:57,914
Now You Listen
To Me Carefully,

1281
01:03:57,947 --> 01:03:59,849
Because I'm Only
Going To Say This Once.

1282
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:01,350
You Leave Me Alone.

1283
01:04:01,384 --> 01:04:04,087
Let Me Do
What I Came Here To Do.

1284
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:05,989
You're Never
Gonna Make My Mother
Fall In Love With You.

1285
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:07,491
You May Be Right,

1286
01:04:07,523 --> 01:04:10,760
But What Your Mother
Wants Is Of
No Importance Now.

1287
01:04:10,793 --> 01:04:12,429
Your Mother Is Mine,

1288
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:15,431
And There's Nothing
Any Snot-Nosed
12-Year-Old

1289
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:16,433
Can Do About It.

1290
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:18,034
I'm 13.

1291
01:04:18,067 --> 01:04:20,570
And I'm A Vampire.

1292
01:04:23,974 --> 01:04:26,276
And If You Want
To Stay Alive,

1293
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:29,513
You'll Do Well
To Remember That.

1294
01:04:29,545 --> 01:04:31,948
Heh Heh Heh Heh Heh.

1295
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:34,652
Ha Ha Ha Ha
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.

1296
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:38,721
Come On, Lynette.
We're Leaving.

1297
01:04:38,755 --> 01:04:41,858
Yes, We're Leaving.

1298
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:49,866
What Happened?
Where's Mom?

1299
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,168
They're Gone.

1300
01:04:51,201 --> 01:04:52,536
Come On.
We've Got To Follow Them.

1301
01:04:52,568 --> 01:04:54,137
And Do What?

1302
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,639
We Can't Just Give Up.

1303
01:04:56,672 --> 01:04:58,641
Look, Chels,
He Caught Me.

1304
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:00,477
He Said If We
Go After Him,
We're Dead.

1305
01:05:00,509 --> 01:05:01,578
And If We Don't,

1306
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,913
What Happens To Mom?

1307
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:06,650
We Tried Everything.

1308
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:09,253
We Tried Nothing.

1309
01:05:09,286 --> 01:05:11,922
We Annoyed Him.
That Didn't Work.

1310
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:14,724
Chelsea,
He's A Vampire.

1311
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:17,026
And This Is
Our Family, Adam.

1312
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,996
I Mean, It's Like You Said
In The Parking Lot.

1313
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,565
Sometimes You
Gotta Try A Little

1314
01:05:21,597 --> 01:05:23,699
If You Want To
Keep Things Together.

1315
01:05:23,733 --> 01:05:26,270
Now, Come On.
You're The Monster Master.

1316
01:05:28,471 --> 01:05:31,742
Well, He Probably Would
Take Her To His Lair.

1317
01:05:31,775 --> 01:05:33,242
Are You Sure?

1318
01:05:33,275 --> 01:05:34,443
Well, That's
What Would Happen

1319
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,246
In The<I> Revenge
Of Count Krelski.

1320
01:05:38,114 --> 01:05:40,117
He Told Us Where
He Lives, Remember?

1321
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,853
The Old Mather House
Out By The Lake.

1322
01:05:43,887 --> 01:05:45,188
Come On.
I'll Call Us A Cab.

1323
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:46,423
Ok.

1324
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:49,058
Here You Go. Thanks.

1325
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:58,101
[Engine Won't Start]

1326
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,605
Great.

1327
01:06:07,076 --> 01:06:09,545
All Right, Here's
What I'm Thinkin'.

1328
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:11,748
We Know
They're Not Eatin'.

1329
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,351
They Might Be Dancin'.
They Might Not.

1330
01:06:15,784 --> 01:06:17,753
We Don't Know
Where They Are,

1331
01:06:17,786 --> 01:06:19,255
But We Do Know
Where They're Goin'.

1332
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:20,389
Where's That?

1333
01:06:20,422 --> 01:06:22,025
Back To His House.

1334
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:24,460
And...

1335
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:25,796
You Know
Where That Is, Right?

1336
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:27,831
I Was Hopin' You Could
Help Me With That.

1337
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:29,900
He Likes
Really Big Houses,

1338
01:06:29,933 --> 01:06:32,068
The Old Kind
Of Mansiony Places.

1339
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,069
Does That Ring A Bell?

1340
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:35,238
Um, Out By The Lake.

1341
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:38,141
All The Big Old Houses
Are Out There.

1342
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:39,742
How Do You
Get There?

1343
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:42,279
Go Straight.

1344
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:53,990
This Is Good.

1345
01:06:54,023 --> 01:06:55,960
Your Mom Make It?

1346
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,364
I Don't Live
With My Mom.

1347
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,331
Where Do You Live?

1348
01:07:02,364 --> 01:07:04,266
Hotel.

1349
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,904
Actually,
Lots Of Hotels.

1350
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:09,873
Your Mom Make You
Sandwiches, Taylor?

1351
01:07:09,905 --> 01:07:12,342
My Mom Does Everything.

1352
01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:26,090
Are You Sure This Is
Where You Want To Get Out?

1353
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:30,560
Yep.
This Is The Place.

1354
01:07:31,828 --> 01:07:34,197
Suit Yourself.

1355
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,732
You Know That Thing
About Sending An E-Mail

1356
01:07:36,766 --> 01:07:38,201
To Somebody
You Don't Know?

1357
01:07:38,233 --> 01:07:39,568
Yeah.

1358
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:40,569
Yeah, Well...

1359
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:42,873
You Were Right.

1360
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:47,510
Listen, Adam,
I Just Want You To Know

1361
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:48,978
That No Matter
What Happens,

1362
01:07:49,012 --> 01:07:50,647
We're Still A Family,
You Know?

1363
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:53,149
Even If It's Just
You, Me, And Taylor.

1364
01:07:53,183 --> 01:07:54,885
We're
Still A Family.

1365
01:07:54,918 --> 01:07:56,853
What Are You
Talking About?

1366
01:07:56,885 --> 01:07:59,590
We've Got
To Save Mom.

1367
01:08:02,025 --> 01:08:03,559
You Know Something,

1368
01:08:03,592 --> 01:08:06,395
I Don't Care What
Anyone Else Says.

1369
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:08,264
You're All Right.

1370
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:10,199
Well, Thanks, Chelsea.
You, Too.

1371
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:13,437
All Right.

1372
01:08:19,608 --> 01:08:21,745
I Don't Think
They're Here Yet.

1373
01:08:21,777 --> 01:08:24,447
I Wouldn't Be Too Sure
About That, Chels.

1374
01:08:26,782 --> 01:08:28,884
[Boom]

1375
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:31,321
What?

1376
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:35,292
Ok. We've Got To Find
Dimitri's Coffin.

1377
01:08:35,325 --> 01:08:36,425
Why?

1378
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:39,596
Well, It's His Thing.
It's Where He Sleeps.

1379
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:42,633
See, If We've
Got His Coffin,
He Won't Touch Mom.

1380
01:08:44,099 --> 01:08:45,768
All Right.
I Say We Split Up.

1381
01:08:45,802 --> 01:08:47,437
I'll Go Upstairs.
You Check The Basement.

1382
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:48,472
Uh, No.

1383
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:51,909
You Check The Basement.
I'll Go Upstairs.

1384
01:08:54,576 --> 01:08:57,580
Why Don't We
Both Go Upstairs?

1385
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:02,953
[Revs Engine]

1386
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:14,531
Whoa.

1387
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:18,768
It's A Lot Bigger
Than I Thought.

1388
01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:22,072
What Are We Gonna Do?

1389
01:09:22,105 --> 01:09:24,741
Wait. Do You
Remember When You
Took The Tv Remote

1390
01:09:24,773 --> 01:09:26,642
And Kept It
In Your Room?

1391
01:09:26,675 --> 01:09:28,445
Yeah.

1392
01:09:28,477 --> 01:09:30,480
How Did I Get You
To Give It Back To Me?

1393
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:32,115
You Stole
My Cell Phone.

1394
01:09:32,147 --> 01:09:35,351
Right, And Cell Phone
Is To Teenager

1395
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:38,821
What Coffin
Is To Vampire.

1396
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:41,258
And Mom's The Remote.

1397
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,592
Yes, Grasshopper.

1398
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:44,127
Now Help Me
Get This Downstairs.

1399
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:47,764
Unh!

1400
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:49,266
Ok. This Is Where

1401
01:09:49,298 --> 01:09:52,368
The Whole Cell Phone,
Coffin Analogy Breaks Down.

01:21:27,263 --> 01:21:28,565
I'm Hungry.

1581
01:21:30,365 --> 01:21:31,733
Would You Like
To Come For Breakfast?

1582
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:33,736
Breakfast?

1583
01:21:33,768 --> 01:21:34,736
Why Not?

1584
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,672
Sure.

1585
01:21:36,705 --> 01:21:38,741
Well, I Never Did
Make Those Pancakes.

1586
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:41,043
Have You Tried Them
With Chocolate Chips?

1587
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:42,645
Already Got 'Em.

1588
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:44,213
Then It's A Date.

1589
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:44,213
Don't
Say Date.

1590
01:21:44,245 --> 01:21:45,213
Not A Date.

1591
01:21:45,246 --> 01:21:46,548
Mom Doesn't Date.

1592
01:21:46,581 --> 01:21:48,651
I Date...

1593
01:21:48,683 --> 01:21:50,887
Just Not Vampires.
