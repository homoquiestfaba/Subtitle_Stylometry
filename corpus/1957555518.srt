Captain Brooks?

9
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,532
Yes.

10
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:58,500
Thank God.

11
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,235
We thought you'd never get here.

12

[Captain Brooks] Do
you have the others?

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,412

I'm sorry, he's gone.

[General Over
Speaker] Send in Brooks.

32
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:21,444
Captain Brooks,
you can go in now.

33
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:35,850
Well, a day late
and a dollar short

34
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:37,618
up until now, wouldn't you say?

35
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,495
Sir?

36
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:43,091
Your performance
on this assignment?

37
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,067
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:48,162
Says here you've
been in trouble before.

39
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,439
Combat fatigue?

40
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:51,875
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:56,337
Well, I guess that's
none of my business,

42
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,740
and I'm stuck with you now.

43
00:04:58,782 --> 00:04:59,716
Yes, sir.

44
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,478
You looked in that
trunk, didn't you?

45
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,712
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:07,982
Some sort of uh, fancy
backroom boy stuff.

47
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:11,819
No, Captain, that's no
fancy backroom boy stuff.

48
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:15,056
Well then, sir, I have no idea

49
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,600
what the hell's going on here.

50
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,729
Frankly Captain,
neither do I, but lucky

51
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,799
for the both of us, that's
what orders are for.

52
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:25,742
Yes, sir.

[General Over

Yes, General.

57
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:36,944
[Secretary] You may go in now.

58
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:37,821

00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,891
What is this, sir?

62
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,527
We startin' a
sideshow or something?

63
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:56,197
Captain Brooks,
Dr. Ivan Ivanov.

64
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:59,000
Doctor of what exactly?

65
00:05:59,042 --> 00:05:59,976
Theology.

66
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,305
God knows that'll
come in handy.

67
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,181
He does.

68
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,709
Is that a German accent, Doc?

69
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,378
Russian.

70
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,079
Definitely not German.

71
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,714
You know, they keep tellin' us

72
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:16,684
that the Russians
are our pals, now.

73
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,821
Well, at least that's
what they keep tellin' us.

74
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:23,357
I supposed trust is
hard to come by, Captain,

75
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,826
even here in America.

76
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,127
Alright, alright, enough.

77
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:27,295
Have a seat.

78
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,129
Listen up.

79
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:29,597
Here's the lowdown.

80
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,232
Now, we have it on
good intelligence

81
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:35,178
that the Axis has a
special unit investigating,

82
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,173
okay, magic.

83
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:40,007
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:40,842
[chuckling]

85
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:41,776
Did you say magic?

86
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,811
You heard me.

87
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:47,548
Mindreading, voodoo,
call it what you like.

88
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,951
Like these damn puppets,

89
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,853
and they've been
getting results.

90
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:55,223
So get that look off
your face, Captain.

91
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,724
Sorry, sir.

92
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:59,560
Now, Captain, Dr. Ivanov
here has been put in charge

93
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:02,430
of our own Allied
Special Projects Unit

94
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:05,808
by men with a lot
more stars than I got,

95
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:11,639
and the first job is to find
out how these puppets work.

96
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,775
Well yes, sir, if you so say.

97
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:15,943
Oh, I say so.

98
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:18,312
Yes, sir, I do say so Captain.

99
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,355
Take a look.

100
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:25,586
Now the Nazis have
their own puppets

101
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,021
and these are American citizens

102
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,257
that these things have killed

103
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:32,226
along with one of
our own generals.

104
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:33,961
They're probably planning
more fifth column

105
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:36,764
stuff as we speak,
so I don't want

106
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,834
any more "Yes, sirs" outta you.

107
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,046
I got my orders and
now you got yours,

108
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,716
and by the way, from here on in,

109
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,411
you're taking orders
from the dwarf.

110
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:51,287
Dismissed.

111
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,125
Let's go Captain.

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,896
[dramatic music]

113
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:22,552
[ominous music]

114
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,416
[Gerde] Herr Freuhoffer.

115
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,251
[Krabke] Is this your
doing, Frau Doktor?

116
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,986
[Gerde] My doing?

117
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,863
Sturmbanfuhrer Krabke.

118
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:36,223
I told you we
needed him alive.

119
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,792
What happened to him?

120
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:39,660
Nothing to do with me.

121
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:40,536
Simply

122
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,272
died of old age.

123
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,600
Natural causes.

124
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,035
It does sometimes
happen, even in wartime.

125
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:50,538
What about the
Chinatown facility?

126
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,106
It's nuts.

127
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:53,149
Destroyed,

128
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,952
but all is not lost.

129
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,055
We have

130
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:01,891
this,

131
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,161
and we have

132
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,135
these.

133
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,468
It seems Herr
Freuhoffer was making

134
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,971
some much needed
repairs when he um,

135
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,181
met his maker.

136
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:29,910
You can control them?

137
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:30,953
Of course.

138
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,516
This green liquid
gives them life,

139
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:37,385
but they need more than life.

140
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:39,720
They need a master.

141
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:40,596
Like men.

142
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,399
They shall.

143
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,004
Frau Doktor?

144
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:52,475
[eerie chime music]

145
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,183
He's here.

146
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,943
Who is?

147
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:05,279
A very dangerous woman,

148
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:06,989
one I've met before.

149
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,550
Come.

150
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:10,760
We must hurry.

151
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:17,325
So, my little friend.

152
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,702
We will finish our business.

153
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,367
We must work quickly.

154
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,036
They have found an old master.

155
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,539
Very well, Frau Doktor.

156
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,683
Show me what they can do.

157
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:38,821
What you can do.

158
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:42,158
[tense music]

159
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:08,909
I'm telling ya, George,
I think I heard something.

160
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,912
You're always
hearing something.

161
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:13,714
Will you come over here
and give me a hand?

162
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,516
No, I'm sure this time.

163
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:17,818
You're always sure, Bobby.

164
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,862
I'll be back in a sec.

165
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,324
[George] Come on, Bobby.

167
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,710
[Bobby] I think I see
something over here.

168
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:43,820
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,071
Bobby, you okay?

171
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,043
Bobby?

[thudding]

173
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,812

[Frau Doctor] Very good
[speaking foreign language].

179
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,579
Now, attach the bombs
where I told you,

180
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:54,023
and come back to your master.

187

Don't be afraid, Elisa.

188
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:56,377
He's a friend.

189
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,320
A friend?

190
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:04,218
He's alive.

191
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,594
A living puppet.

192
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:09,323
Father, I dreamed
about others like him.

193
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,091
Later, my dear.

194
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,393
Hurry now.

195
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,436
Get dressed.

196
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:15,763
Something's happened.

197
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:18,699
Half the city's gone dark.

198
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,634
I've called a meeting.

199
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,179
[eerie music]

200
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:33,289
We'll have to work
on you, my friend.

201
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:38,828
[eerie music]

202
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,913
Captain, Miss Georgina Vale.

203
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:02,509
Ma'am.

204
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,111
My, my.

205
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,422
An officer and a gentleman.

206
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,026
My daughter, Elisa.

207
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:15,297
Your, I'm sorry,
your daughter?

208
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,295
Good evening, miss.

209
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,429
Good evening.

210
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,164
Yes, Captain.

211
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:27,434
We can have children
of conventional size.

212
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,269
May we proceed?

213
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:31,638
You're the boss, Doc.

214
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,840
Thank you.

215
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:34,283
Elisa, Miss Vale.

216
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:37,611
Captain Brooks will be
serving as a liaison

217
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,279
to the war department.

218
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,684
All three of us, Miss
Vale, my daughter and I

219
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,319
have certain special abilities

220
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,021
that have made us
suitable for membership

221
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:49,456
in this organization.

222
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,858
Yes, sir.

223
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,128
Miss Vale is our resident
expert in the occult

224
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,996
and an accomplished witch.

225
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,297
[chuckles]

226
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,532
Right.

227
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:01,243
She specializes
in sexual magic.

228
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,306
Do tell.

229
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:07,808
Don't we all?

230
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,780
My daughter, Elisa, is
a psychic and clairvoyant.

231
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:13,614
That means...

232
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,482
I know what it means.

233
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,384
It means she can
tell the future,

234
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:21,488
like a fortune teller
or a fortune cookie.

235
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,093
Something like that,
but only in her dreams.

236
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:28,328
How 'bout you, Doc?

237
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,597
What's your trick?

238
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,766
Can you tell me what I'm
thinking right about now?

239
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:36,203
I'm afraid I can't
read minds, Captain,

240
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,972
but I can sense emotions.

241
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,250
Anger, fear,

242
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,519
love.

243
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:46,346
I can project them as well.

244
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:50,284
For instance, I can
paralyze a man with fear.

245
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:54,430
So can a .45 automatic
or a bunch of wind up...

246
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:57,967
Freaks?

247
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:03,639
Yeah.

248
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,175
My friends.

249
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,271
You have to forgive the captain.

250
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:15,484
He seems angry, but underneath
I'm sensing something else.

251
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,845
Fear.

252
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,179
[chuckling]

253
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:21,148
You think I'm
afraid of all this?

254
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,484
Your little spook show
you're running here?

255
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:25,586
Oh, no, Captain.

256
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,897
I'm sensing something else.

257
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:31,400
A deeper fear, very deep.

258
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,328
Something you've
been carrying around

259
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,531
for some time, like a bad tooth.

260
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,666
I can extract it if you like.

261
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,169
Let's just stick
to business, hmm?

262
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,212
Very well.

263
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,214
Elisa.

264
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:52,980
I saw three of
them down underground

265
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,691
surrounded by machines, I think.

266
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:02,097
One of the them was
all metal, like a tank.

267
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,470
Another one was like a
werewolf in a Nazi uniform,

268
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:14,310
and a third one was a woman
with machine guns for breasts.

269
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,239
They planted the bombs.

270
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,115
Okay.

271
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:25,179
So, you're tellin'
me things like these

272
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,713
blacked out half the city?

273
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,816
There was somebody else.

274
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,760
A shadow behind
them, guiding them.

275
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:36,131
No one's shadow, very powerful.

276
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:39,501
A master.

277
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:42,805
Father.

278
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:46,976
It was her.

279
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,579
[ominous music]

280
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,691
[vocalizing in foreign language]

281
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,176
[grunting]

282
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,286
Who is this, anyway?

283
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,497
[choking]

284
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,659
[Thomas] What do
you want from me?

285
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:46,535
Stop!

286
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,638
Thomas Otterman.

287
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:52,332
Sounds German, is
he one of ours?

288
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:53,734
Hmm?

289
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:54,835
Oh, no.

290
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,612
No one in particular.

291
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,706
Just someone to practice on.

292
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:02,042
Now I think

293
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,654
red hot needles under
the fingernails, hmm?

294
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:11,393
[screaming]

295
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:17,457
[Thomas] Stop!

296
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,334
Ah!

297
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:21,236
Ah!

298
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:26,166
So, your puppets
damaged the substation

299
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,378
to black out the
city for a few hours.

300
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:35,509
No more than any one of
our agents could have done.

301
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,512
By morning everything
be back to normal,

302
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:41,982
but now I think the
teeth, yah, yah.

303
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:42,858
The teeth.

304
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,328
[screaming]

305
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,994
I can't say that you've
impressed me, Frau Doktor,

306
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:57,373
but I'm nothing if
not a reasonable man.

307
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,466
[grunting]

308
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,709
Do convince me.

309
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:06,081
[screaming]

310
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:11,720
[ominous music]

311
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:16,925
[Thomas] Stop!

312
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:23,590
Did you know, Frau
Doktor that the most

313
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:28,428
common nightmares involve
the breaking of teeth?

314
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,306
Teeth being
shattered, pulled out?

315
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:35,268
No, Sturmbanfuhrer,
I did not know that.

316
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,636
Yah, it's true.

317
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:39,740
Damage to the fingers, the eyes,

318
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:42,209
the nose I find is
most fascinating.

319
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:44,778
[wailing]

320
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,012
Perhaps after the war is over

321
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,348
you should write a paper on it.

322
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,084
When the war is over?

323
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:55,297
Some would consider that a
naive position, Frau Doktor,

324
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:59,935
but please, go on talking
about your puppets.

325
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:04,006
Yes, of course.

326
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:10,771
Sturmbanfuhrer Krabke, there
are things my puppets can do.

327
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:12,047
Your puppets?

328
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:14,550
Our puppets.

329
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:18,178
There are things
our puppets can do

330
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,414
that not even an army can.

331
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:21,290
Really?

332
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,251
You should find
this interesting.

333
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,727
Observe the eyes.

334
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:29,990
[wailing]

335
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,692
The roots of the eyes are
most sensitive, Frau Doktor,

336
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:34,002
most sensitive.

337
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:37,464
[Thomas] Let me die!

338
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:38,298
[crying]

339
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,600
You were saying?

340
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:44,079
My pup, our puppets
can do many things.

341
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:50,610
For example, they can climb
up the side of buildings,

342
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,921
through ventilation shafts.

343
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,392
They can even assassinate
a prime minister,

344
00:22:58,427 --> 00:22:59,428
a president,

345
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,197
even a fuhrer.

346
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:07,427
Herr Krabke, our adversaries
have their own puppets,

347
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,695
their own elixir.

348
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,598
They may even have the
secret to making more,

349
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,168
more puppets, more
elixir and what's more

350
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,813
to the point is they have found

351
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,415
an old master.

352
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,653
Someone I have met before.

353
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,715
He is not to be underestimated.

354
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:31,351
We must act before they do.

355
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:33,920
This one's about used up.

356
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:37,457
No, Sturmbanfuhrer, I
may have some use for him,

357
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,001
if you don't mind.

358
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:44,331
Not at all, Frau Doktor,

359
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:47,968
and I see your point
about the other puppets.

360
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,511
What is your plan?

361
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,105
Oberhelfer Steitze!

362
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:53,540
Yah, Frau Doktor?

363
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:55,842
Fetch the [speaking
foreign language].

364
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,452
Yah, Frau Doktor.

365
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,515
She has no special power?

366
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:04,918
No, but she and her
girls have their uses.

367
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,794
Yah.

368
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:10,232
[ominous music]

369
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:16,863
[thudding]

370
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:19,599
France yet again
at Germany's feet.

371
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:22,411
Seems so natural,
Madame Longpre.

372
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:30,310
Herr Krabke, Madame Longpre
is one of the world's

373
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:32,279
preeminent scholars
of the occult

374
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:34,848
and France's most
renowned psychic.

375
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,082
Is that so?

376
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:37,350
Yes.

377
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,853
Madame Longpre helped us
locate the two Americans

378
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,622
who were hiding
Toulon's puppets.

379
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,258
She stole the information
right from the mind

380
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,471
of General Hansard, isn't
that right, Madame Antoinette?

381
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,833
Yes, Frau Doktor.

382
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,268
Really?

383
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,638
And how do you keep secrets
from such a creature?

384
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,949
You think she was dangerous?

385
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,644
[chuckles]

386
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:06,455
My dear Antoinette?

387
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:10,517
No, not dangerous at all.

388
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,453
A dog who has been trained
properly is not dangerous.

389
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,897
Isn't that right, Antoinette?

390
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,592
Yes, Frau Doktor.

391
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:22,362
Nothing pleases the
eye more than the sight

392
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:24,673
of a properly beaten bitch.

393
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:29,369
Come, Antoinette,
send out your powers.

394
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:31,346
Search for the puppets.

395
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,216
Where are they?

396
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:36,485
Who has them?

397
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,322
Seek, Antoinette, seek.

398
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:45,394
[eerie chime music]

399
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,042
So, upstairs is secure.

400
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:03,436
What the hell are you doing?

401
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,838
Showing yourself like that
in front of a young girl?

402
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,808
Captain, leave Miss
Vale alone, please.

403
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,245
She's making her own arrangements
to protect the house.

404
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:13,179
What, by showing off her...

405
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:15,682
Leave her alone, please.

406
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:18,451
And I have seen women's
breasts before, Captain,

407
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,063
but thank you for your concern.

408
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:25,267
You're welcome.

409
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:29,429
So what is all this?

410
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:32,265
I found it hidden
in Toulon's trunk.

411
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:35,935
I believe it is the
scroll of Osiris.

412
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:37,537
The secret of the
elixir by which

413
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:40,206
the dead can be dowried life.

414
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:42,442
Unfortunately, I can't read it.

415
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:45,145
The hieroglyphics
are too ancient,

416
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,355
unless I use some of this.

417
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,921
This is all we have left
to keep our friends alive.

418
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:57,991
Our enemies, no
doubt, have even less.

419
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,969
They'll be coming
for this and this,

420
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,964
unless we conceal ourselves.

421
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:08,435
Okay, so this crowd
thing we're talking about.

422
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:11,905
Gerde Ernst,
Doktor Gerde Ernst.

423
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,406
Right.

424
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:14,941
So, her and the rest of them.

425
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:18,511
They're looking for us and
we're looking for them.

426
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,714
Meanwhile, they're
hiding from us

427
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:23,717
and we're hiding from them.

428
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,252
You know, back in
the day, my dad

429
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:27,687
used to call that a stalemate.

430
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,998
Yes, yes, I suppose it is

431
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:35,161
for now.

432
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:37,030
She can't read minds Captain,

433
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,366
but she has someone who can.

434
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,267
They'll be searching for us,

435
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:43,670
for anyone in the city
who's thinking about us,

436
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:45,872
about this place.

437
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,850
Put this around
your neck, Captain.

438
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:52,245
What is it?

439
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:54,022
It's an elder sign.

440
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:57,550
There are ways to protect
us so long as we stay inside

441
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,253
these walls to shadow us.

442
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:03,022
These will do the same
when we go outside.

443
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:05,859
Okay, you say they're
trying to look for us, right?

444
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,260
Why don't we do the same thing?

445
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:09,162
I mean, use some of
this voodoo stuff

446
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:10,697
to try to find them.

447
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:14,834
We spent most of the night
trying without success.

448
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,369
No doubt Frau Ernst has shrouded

449
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:19,873
their hiding place in much
the same way that we have,

450
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:22,475
but we do have an advantage.

451
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:25,178
Magic leaves a
psychic trace behind.

452
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,614
If we can find the
site of sabotage,

453
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:30,917
Georgina can track
them to their base,

454
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,318
but we need you to find out

455
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,754
where the bombs were planted.

456
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,588
Okay.

457
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,465
I'm on it.

458
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,869
[ominous music]

459
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,609
You like this?

460
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,420
Oh, yah, I like it.

461
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,115
Like it, cupcake.

462
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,750
Close your eyes, big boy,

463
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:06,561
and I'll give you
a big surprise.

464
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:09,231
Ah ah, no peeking.

465
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,958
Close those eyes tight.

466
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,160
[chuckling]

467
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:17,138
[mysterious music]

468
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,242
You can open your eyes now.

469
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,838
[dramatic music]

470
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,714
Ah!

471
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:28,408
[screaming]

472
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,943
Ah!

473
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,320
[screaming]

474
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:35,891
Go and get the man.

475
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,160
[bubbling]

476
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,288
[ominous music]

477
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,599
Yes, this time I've got it.

478
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:48,228
You see?

479
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,896
We can duplicate
the Freuhoffer...

480
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:52,207
[crashing]

481
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:56,278
[ominous music]

482
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,815
You were saying, Frau Doktor?

483
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,556
[eerie chime music]

484
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:42,048
You're up late Captain.

485
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,050
So are you, Miss Ivanov.

486
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:44,884
Coffee?

487
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,027
No, thanks.

488
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,489
I just had a dream about you.

489
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:50,323
Oh yeah?

490
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:51,591
Should I be flattered?

491
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,794
I saw you in the
battle, wounded,

492
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,297
hiding under the bodies
of your comrades,

493
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:00,099
the Germans firing
into the bodies.

494
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,601
Who told you about that?

495
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,569
I told you, I just
dreamed about it.

496
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,114
That's where you got the scar.

497
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:08,850
What else?

498
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:10,652
Nothing.

499
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:15,848
Is there anything else?

500
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,719
Yeah, I don't suppose
you dreamed about

501
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:23,589
me being shipped stateside
for combat fatigue,

502
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,859
which is a nice way of
saying I cracked up.

503
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:29,696
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, Captain.

504
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:31,464
You tell that to my
friends and the men

505
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:34,968
who were over there
dying for our country

506
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,014
while I'm sitting here
babysitting a bunch of...

507
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:42,717
[creaking]

508
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:52,218
I guess I just
wasn't tough enough.

509
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,587
It's very strange.

510
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:55,463
What is?

511
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:59,759
How much you and
my father are alike.

512
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,294
Oh, wow, really?

513
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,171
That just made my day.

514
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,667
Strong men, men
confident in their power,

515
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:11,337
who've never had
to face a failure.

516
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,148
It's not easy, is it?

517
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,855
My father wouldn't
talk about my mother.

518
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:27,520
We don't even have
a picture of her.

519
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:29,589
What happened to her?

520
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:33,292
We were captured, my
father, my mother and I,

521
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,161
by a special unit of the Gestapo

522
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,231
while my father was
lecturing in Leipzig.

523
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:43,136
They were looking for the people
with exceptional abilities,

524
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:44,579
rounding them up.

525
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:51,252
This woman, she had great
power like my father.

526
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:55,381
This dreadful woman.

527
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:57,216
The one that we're
looking for now?

528
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:58,093
Yeah.

529
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:01,387
She's quite a fool, really.

530
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:03,389
She imagines she'll
have a special place

531
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,992
in the new world order.

532
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:09,762
The Nazis are only using
her and others like her.

533
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:12,598
If they were to win,
there'd be no place

534
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,076
for people like her, like us.

535
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:19,872
We're freaks.

536
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,775
[knocking]
[ominous music]

537
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:23,609
What is it?

538
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,386
Go get your father.

539
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:32,227
[knocking]

540
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,054
Who is it?

541
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,324
Courier from Central Command.

542
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:40,726
Let me see your credentials.

543
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,438
[ominous music]

544
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:52,105
Captain Brooks.

545
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:54,607
I have your reports
from my department.

546
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,552
[mysterious music]

547
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,458
I've got them.

548
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,628
I've got them.

549
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,962
According to this, the
bomb was planted here.

550
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,272
Substation 212.

551
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:20,666
What about the
damage, Captain?

552
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,635
Can we get in there?

553
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:24,170
I don't know.

554
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:25,605
Corporal.

555
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,274
Well, sir, repair
crews rerouted the juice,

556
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,810
so the whole station shut down.

557
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:33,079
The thing is, I heard
the feds have been

558
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:36,048
all over that place and
they didn't find nothin',

559
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,250
so I don't know what you think

560
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,719
you're going to find.

561
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:42,054
You don't have
to worry, angel.

562
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:44,032
I'll take care of that.

563
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,868
Yes, ma'am.

564
00:34:49,037 --> 00:34:52,165
Elisa, I wish for
you to remain here.

565
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:53,708
But Father, I...

566
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,678
Yes, Father.

567
00:34:57,712 --> 00:34:59,314
Chester, Pinhead.

568
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,708
You'll remain here, as well.

569
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,010
You know what Doc?

570
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:04,877
I think we should
bring the corporal here

571
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,546
with us, as well.

572
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:08,147
Very well.

573
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,959
Georgina, give
him an elder sign.

574
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,287
What's an elder sign?

575
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,788
Just put it around your neck.

576
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,123
I'll explain later.

577
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:18,891
Oh, don't bother, sir.

578
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,602
I'm an enlisted man.

579
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:24,138
[eerie music]

580
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:49,330
[ominous music]

581
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:59,107
[creaking]

582
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,986
[gasping]

583
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:18,993
Captain.

584
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:23,823
Captain Smith, just
what is that there woman

585
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:25,191
doing with that chicken foot?

586
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:28,027
Shhh, she's
searching for a trace

587
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,329
of the ones who
were here before.

588
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:34,542
If she finds it, we should
be able to follow it, too.

589
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,136
[crackling]

590
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:38,337
Ah!

591
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:41,440
Doctor, we must
leave here at once.

592
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:44,652
[ominous tense music]

593
00:36:56,397 --> 00:37:00,593
[speaking foreign language]

594
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,436
Mein Frau.

595
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,750
Where are they, little man?

596
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:21,522
Come now, no surprises.

597
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,092
It won't help you.

598
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,355
Bring them out, little man.

599
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:31,899
[tense music]

600
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:41,976
Down, make them all
lie down on the floor.

601
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,848
That's better.

602
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:54,080
You've met my
associate, Frau Doktor,

603
00:37:54,122 --> 00:37:58,284
but I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

604
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:00,528
I am Sturmbanfuhrer Krabke.

605
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,033
They say you're very
powerful Herr Ivanov,

606
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,202
and old master.

607
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:14,600
Was you trying to send
something in my direction?

608
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,602
Some kind of attack?

609
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,604
[chuckling]

610
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:22,817
Yes, Herr Ivanov, fear can
be a very powerful weapon.

611
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:31,617
[whimpering]

612
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:32,585
Those quaint charms.

613
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:35,229
You're all wearing elder signs.

614
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,325
An effective defense,

615
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,170
but they don't seem
to work against me.

616
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:48,376
I draw my powers from
a more ancient well.

617
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:59,378
You know this mark, the
mark of the old gods,

618
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,621
the first gods.

619
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:04,784
But what you failed
to fight against this,

620
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:08,687
what need have I of Frau
Gerde and her puppets?

621
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,890
I'll make you all
dance to my strings.

622
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,591
You dare challenge me?

623
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:13,468
A dwarf!

624
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:17,496
[speaking foreign language]

625
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,707
[moaning]

626
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,945
Two citizen soldiers.

627
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:29,884
[moaning]

628
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:35,381
Should I start with
you, old master?

629
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:37,583
No, no I don't think so.

630
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,919
I don't think that
would be a fair test.

631
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,254
Little body too weak.

632
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,623
The mind too strong
I'll hunt you

633
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:46,667
for scientific purposes.

634
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:52,264
We should choose a
more typical specimen.

635
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,167
You'd like to send them
against me, wouldn't you?

636
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:57,570
[chuckling]

637
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:01,782
But I have my own
blades, my own [mumbles],

638
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:05,753
my own [mumbles].

639
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:07,755
Here.

640
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:11,425
[tense music]

641
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:14,954
Stand up, please.

642
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,589
Kiss my ass, you
kraut son of a...

643
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,633
[slaps]

644
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,193
That's better.

645
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:22,503
Nice and quiet.

646
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:25,631
Now, what was I saying?

647
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,510
Oh, yes, I know a man
be driven mad from fear,

648
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:35,583
but can a man die
from fear alone?

649
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,613
Shall we find out?

650
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,823
[moaning]

651
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:49,121
So many nerves,

652
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:51,265
so hard to find them all.

653
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:54,502
See them, tweak them!

654
00:40:58,306 --> 00:41:00,441
[moaning]

655
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:02,610
Twisting them.

656
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:07,348
[speaking foreign language]

657
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:14,021
[choking]
[dramatic music]

658
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:15,923
Excellent.

659
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:19,427
Oh, oh but I'll be tired.

660
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,758
Oh, it would be so much easier

661
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,803
if I didn't have
to control you all.

662
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,076
[tense music]

663
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:39,380
The scroll.

664
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,451
The scroll of Osiris.

665
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:56,664
The dwarf.

666
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,200
He was studying it

667
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:02,136
at this table,

668
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:08,876
but she doesn't know
where it is now.

669
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,114
[thuds]

670
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,051
I swear, Frau Doktor.

671
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,744
Frau Doktor.

672
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,620
Hmm?

673
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:23,057
[tense music]

674
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:25,951
Frau Doktor, I've got it.

675
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:26,927
No, wait!

676
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:32,066
[gunshots booming]

677
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,473
[gasping]

678
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,045
Fool.

679
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:47,815
[mysterious music]

680
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:53,821
[dramatic music]

681
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,958

682
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,181
[tense music]

683
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,691
These puppets of Toulon's,

684
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:35,563
they are harder to
control than ours.

685
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:42,036
Not like the [speaking
foreign language].

686
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:48,843
Come.

687
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,072
Let's see if the
illustrious Sturmbanfuhrer

688
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:55,207
has had more luck
finding the father

689
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:57,084
than we have had here.

690
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:02,022
[dramatic music]

691
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:06,318
[tense music]

692
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,230
Anxious to join
your friend, soldier?

693
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,565
But a bit later.

694
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:19,273
Perhaps I should try a
specimen of the inferior sex.

695
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:24,178
Und inferior race.

696
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:29,942
[moaning]

697
00:44:29,984 --> 00:44:33,654

698
00:44:36,524 --> 00:44:39,026
[tense music]

699
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:48,402
Ah!

700
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,906
[screaming]

701
00:44:54,175 --> 00:44:56,510
[crackling]

702
00:44:57,812 --> 00:44:59,980
[buzzing]

703
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:12,351
[wailing]

704
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:15,162
[dramatic music]

705
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:33,614
[footsteps clacking]

706
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,490
[Georgina] Have
courage, mon cherie.

707
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,192
She was here.

708
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,120
She leaves her
psychic trace behind.

709
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,332
I can sense it like
the odor of decay.

710
00:45:54,034 --> 00:45:55,594
There's no sign of Elisa.

711
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:57,029
I searched the whole house.

712
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:58,497
Yes.

713
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:01,900
I could feel the emptiness
as soon as we arrived.

714
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:03,402
They have her.

715
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:06,805
Gerde and [mumbling] Krabke!

716
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,473
They have her.

717
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,943
They also took Pinhead.

718
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:12,244
There's no sign of him.

719
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:13,454
Yes, I know.

720
00:46:15,422 --> 00:46:16,949
Doctor, what are we
going to do about Elisa?

721
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:19,184
I mean, if they...

722
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:22,621
Captain, what
can any of us do?

723
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:24,523
Pray that God gives
us strength to bear

724
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:26,901
whatever trials He sends us,

725
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,771
if we must.

726
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:35,075
[tense music]

727
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:42,074
[Friede] Do you
wish to revive it?

728
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:46,311
No, there's not enough
elixir for experiments,

729
00:46:46,353 --> 00:46:49,114
though there are possibilities.

730
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:52,092
Be of good cheer,
Fraulein Steitze.

731
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:56,997
I am always
cheerful Frau Doktor.

732
00:46:57,932 --> 00:46:58,766
Indeed.

733
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,159
Of course.

734
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:02,561
The Fuhrer expects
all young German women

735
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:05,664
to be cheerful at all times.

736
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:07,132
Does he really?

737
00:47:07,174 --> 00:47:08,967
Indeed, Frau Doktor.

738
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:10,678
Cheerful and useful.

739
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,977
Well, Oberhelfer
Steitze, you're truly

740
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:20,921
one remarkable monster.

741
00:47:21,956 --> 00:47:24,650
Thank you, Frau Doktor.

742
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:27,194
[tense music]

743
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:37,129
How are you feeling,
Sturmban Freuhoff?

744
00:47:37,171 --> 00:47:38,931
If you [mumbling]
I can let you

745
00:47:38,973 --> 00:47:40,999
experience the pain firsthand.

746
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,035
No, thank you Herr Krabke.

747
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:45,079
I was just being polite.

748
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,106
You're very
lucky, Frau Doktor.

749
00:47:48,148 --> 00:47:49,541
How so?

750
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,043
My own failure this
evening makes it impossible

751
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:53,445
for me to condemn you for yours.

752
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:57,658
Well, it's hardly necessary,
but I won't fail again.

753
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:02,196
[dramatic music]

754
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,633
[eerie music]

755
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:13,365
Why don't we just
destroy this thing?

756
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:17,035
For the last 4,000 years,
Captain, far wiser men

757
00:48:17,077 --> 00:48:20,806
than you or I could have
destroyed this scroll.

758
00:48:20,848 --> 00:48:24,009
If they chose to
preserve it instead,

759
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:27,721
then perhaps we should
defer to that wisdom.

760
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,352
[muffled radio chattering
in foreign language]

761
00:48:33,394 --> 00:48:34,820
This is the dwarf's daughter?

762
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,288
Yes.

763
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,890
Pretty little bit
of bait, isn't she?

764
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:42,260
Let's hope she
brings in the big fish.

765
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:44,805
[tense music]

766
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,937
[gasps]

767
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:53,380
Welcome fraulein.

768
00:48:57,618 --> 00:48:59,878
[knocking]

769
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,556
[ominous music]

770
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:32,577
What does it say?

771
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:35,647
They want the
rest of the elixir,

772
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:39,359
the puppets, the scroll and me.

773
00:49:40,828 --> 00:49:44,022
In return, Elisa will
be released unharmed.

774
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,223
If not...

775
00:49:45,265 --> 00:49:46,458
You don't believe
them, do you?

776
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,003
Of course not, but
we must do something.

777
00:49:53,107 --> 00:49:54,341
Doctor, look.

778
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,878
[tense music]

779
00:49:58,912 --> 00:49:59,747
It's hair.

780
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,883
Just a single strand.

781
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,346
Not from the woman doctor.

782
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:11,992
It belongs to the one
who left the message.

783
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:17,064
Still something I can work with.

784
00:50:22,402 --> 00:50:25,230
And this is something
we can work with

785
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,341
to better protect us all.

786
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,111
[tense music]

787
00:50:47,995 --> 00:50:50,764
[dramatic music]

788
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:56,537
[groaning]

789
00:50:58,105 --> 00:51:02,142
So, they tell me you
can dream the future, hmm?

790
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:05,103
[crying]

791
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,205
Did you dream of your own death?

792
00:51:07,247 --> 00:51:09,741
The death of your
freakish father?

793
00:51:09,783 --> 00:51:13,678
All these decadent
cities in flames, hmm?

794
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,313
Yes.

795
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:16,715
Yes.

796
00:51:16,757 --> 00:51:19,251
I dreamed of cities in flames.

797
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:20,819
Dresden.

798
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:22,387
Munich.

799
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:24,055
Berlin,

800
00:51:24,097 --> 00:51:27,325
the whole damn thousand
years Reich in flames.

801
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:29,269
Oh, and something else.

802
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,307
I saw bunkers,
stinking old ratty.

803
00:51:34,474 --> 00:51:35,767
A rat called, ah!

804
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:36,643
Silence!

805
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:40,705
Herr Krabke!

806
00:51:40,747 --> 00:51:41,982
That is enough.

807
00:51:43,217 --> 00:51:44,743
What did you say?

808
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,111
We need her.

809
00:51:46,153 --> 00:51:47,821
For now, let her be.

810
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,982
Frau Doktor, you
forget yourself.

811
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,952
I am the officer in
charge of this station.

812
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:57,722
Yes, yes,
Sturmbanfuhrer, of course.

813
00:51:57,764 --> 00:51:58,865
Frau Ernst!

814
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:02,202
[tense music]

815
00:52:10,744 --> 00:52:11,912
Herr Krabke.

816
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:17,784
I want you to understand
that I do respect

817
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:21,880
your exceptional abilities

818
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:24,049
and I appreciate our
superior's choice

819
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:27,252
to put you in command
of this station.

820
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:29,654
[moaning]

821
00:52:29,696 --> 00:52:33,458
You must understand
that rank and title

822
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,337
are not the same as the
aristocracy of nature.

823
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:42,500
I hope you didn't think
that the scribblings

824
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:46,171
on your chest would
protect you from me.

825
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:50,117
They protected you from
Herr Ivanov but not so.

826
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:55,347
They did not protect
you from his powers,

827
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:57,291
only from his scruples.

828
00:52:58,492 --> 00:53:02,787
Some weakness in the man
that prevents him from

829
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:05,165
crushing another man's soul.

830
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:08,627
You are nothing but a traitor!

831
00:53:08,669 --> 00:53:09,461
If you harm me...

832
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,671
Herr Krabke.

833
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,534
I very much want us to have
a productive relationship

834
00:53:16,576 --> 00:53:20,071
but you must understand
what that relationship is.

835
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,941
[wailing]

836
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:25,252
You prattle on of old gods,

837
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,721
first gods.

838
00:53:30,157 --> 00:53:30,991
This hand,

839
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:37,389
it held the first stone knife

840
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:41,393
that cut the heart out
of the first child,

841
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:44,104
sacrificed to the first darkness

842
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:49,309
that crawled up out of the
chaos of the long night.

843
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:53,580
The darkness that has no name.

844
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:58,352
The great shadow
that cast you and I

845
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,155
and the Fuhrer

846
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:07,761
in all the terrible
workings of the world.

847
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:10,955
[moaning]

848
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:14,401
I have seen the captives fed

849
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:16,728
to the flames

850
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,774
at the mighty temples of
Murdoch and I have seen

851
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,112
ten thousands of
heads of the slain

852
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:30,241
piled at the gates [mumbles].

853
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:32,519
Oh, the things I have seen.

854
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:38,450
Come.

855
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:40,660
[moaning]

856
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,834
Go ahead.

857
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,371
[moaning]

858
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,911
When you have passed through
as many lives as I have,

859
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:03,350
when you have died as
many deaths as I have,

860
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:06,019
you will learn

861
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,690
that one has infinite
ways to inflict pain,

862
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,731
and it is the knife to the
soul that cuts the deepest.

863
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,168
Enough.

864
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:26,773
Herr Krabke, speak,

865
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,304
but choose your words wisely.

866
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:35,682
Do we understand each other?

867
00:55:37,818 --> 00:55:39,419
Yah, Frau Doktor.

868
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:46,051
Now go and get
yourself cleaned up.

869
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,521
Our guests will be
arriving any minute.

870
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:52,065
[tense music]

871
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,368
Are you ready, Fraulein Steitze?

872
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,011
Yah, Frau Doktor.

873
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:09,040
Any thoughts, Fraulein Steitze

874
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:13,178
on what just happened between
myself and the Sturmbanfuhrer?

875
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,715
I never involve myself in
disputes of my superiors.

876
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:21,953
I simply follow orders to
the best of my ability.

877
00:56:21,995 --> 00:56:24,664
[ominous music]

878
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:52,392
They are protected,
Doctor, like Krabke.

879
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,862
[tense music]

880
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:19,953

[hissing]

882
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:32,999
Ah!

883
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:40,240
[screaming]
[dramatic music]

884
00:57:42,275 --> 00:57:44,945
[ominous music]

885
00:57:58,158 --> 00:58:00,360
[mumbling]

886
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:18,612
Wait.

887
00:58:19,646 --> 00:58:21,973
They know we're here.

888
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:24,517
[tense music]

889
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:30,790
Please.

890
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,794
Please.

891
00:58:37,564 --> 00:58:38,832
Please help me.

892
00:58:48,408 --> 00:58:49,409
I'm sorry.

893
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:51,511
I can't.

894
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,116
There is nothing we can do.

895
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:59,110
We can't win.

896
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:00,178
That's not true.

897
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,088
Read my mind, my dream.

898
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,457
Please.

899
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:08,395
Antoinette!

900
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:12,890
Yes, Frau Doktor?

901
00:59:12,932 --> 00:59:14,834
Well, where are they?

902
00:59:16,503 --> 00:59:17,929
I don't know.

903
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,472
I can't find them.

904
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,742
They must be enshadowed.

905
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:25,111
Protected.

906
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:27,681
Antoinette.

907
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:31,184
Antoinette, are you lying?

908
00:59:34,954 --> 00:59:37,181
I swear.

909
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:39,059
I swear I'm not lying.

910
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:43,630
I'll keep trying.

911
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,067
I'll keep trying.

912
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,503
[tense music]

00:59:57,977 --> 01:00:02,148
[gunshots booming]
[dramatic music]

914
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:09,280
Georgina, get downstairs.

915
01:00:09,322 --> 01:00:10,557
I'll cover you.

916
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:23,303
So, you did not
know they were here?

917
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:30,968
I guess some dogs can
never be properly trained.

918
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:32,579
Weremutt, kill her.

919
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:38,618

Ah!

926
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:11,551
[choking]

927
01:01:23,396 --> 01:01:25,089
[Man] You trying to trick me?

928
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:27,458
No, no, no, please.

929
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,236
[dramatic music]

930
01:01:52,258 --> 01:01:54,719
Now put your head back.

931
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:56,095
Close your eyes.

932
01:01:59,766 --> 01:02:01,367
Now open your mouth.

933
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:03,503
Yes, yes.

934
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:07,598
Now, you are about to be kissed

935
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,743
like you've never
been kissed before.

936
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:14,380
[tense music]

937
01:02:19,752 --> 01:02:21,921
[choking]

938
01:02:29,562 --> 01:02:33,733
[gunshots booming]
[dramatic music]

939
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,363
Let's get outta here, Doc.

940
01:02:39,405 --> 01:02:40,907
Come on, this way.

941
01:02:42,242 --> 01:02:44,978
[dramatic music]

942
01:02:56,823 --> 01:02:59,726
[gunshots booming]

943
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:06,032
[tense music]

944
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:21,848
Is that you, little one?

945
01:03:28,354 --> 01:03:30,690
[chuckling]

946
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:49,742
[whirring]

947
01:03:52,512 --> 01:03:55,281
[dramatic music]

948
01:04:00,553 --> 01:04:02,889
[screaming]

949
01:04:15,201 --> 01:04:18,871
[speaking foreign language]

950
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,275
Ah!

951
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:27,547
[dramatic music]
[screaming]

952
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:37,857
Herr Doctor.

953
01:04:39,192 --> 01:04:40,718
Frau Doktor.

954
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,289
Still struggling to control
mere bits of wood and metal?

955
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:48,526
There's so much more
to mere wood and metal.

956
01:04:48,568 --> 01:04:49,902
They have souls,

957
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:54,941
and I've never tried
to control them,

958
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:57,668
only to guide them.

959
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:00,980
Yes, that's always
been your weakness.

960
01:05:02,915 --> 01:05:05,918
Not wanting to
tamper with the soul.

961
01:05:07,787 --> 01:05:10,948
It's why you couldn't
save your wife.

962
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,227
It's why you cannot
save your daughter.

963
01:05:15,228 --> 01:05:17,730
[tense music]

964
01:05:24,604 --> 01:05:25,997
Oh.

965
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:28,265
I'm glad you've come
back, Americana.

966
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:30,868
[grunts]

967
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,871
I won't kill you, not just yet.

968
01:05:33,913 --> 01:05:38,084
I want you to see what I'm
going to do to the girl.

969
01:05:40,753 --> 01:05:43,022
[grunting]

970
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:52,398
[ominous music]

971
01:05:56,235 --> 01:05:59,305
Always been one
of your weaknesses.

972
01:06:02,275 --> 01:06:03,776
You care too much.

973
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:06,079
But to me,

974
01:06:08,648 --> 01:06:09,649
wood, metal,

975
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,052
flesh, spirit,

976
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:16,022
man, puppet

977
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,462
all the same.

978
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:29,068
I use them and when I
no longer need them,

979
01:06:30,036 --> 01:06:31,537
I throw them away.

980
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:35,241
I have no need of armies,

981
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,411
fuhrers,

982
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,441
[speaking foreign language].

983
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:46,719
They're just layers
of skin that I shed

984
01:06:48,788 --> 01:06:52,692
as I grow ever larger,
lifetime after lifetime.

985
01:07:05,037 --> 01:07:07,773
I know the elixir
is almost gone.

986
01:07:09,075 --> 01:07:11,744
Where is the scroll, little man?

987
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:16,349
If you cannot read it, I can.

988
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,285
Answer me!

989
01:07:20,553 --> 01:07:24,181
You know which one
of us is stronger.

990
01:07:24,223 --> 01:07:26,726
[tense music]

991
01:07:29,529 --> 01:07:30,363
Very well.

992
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:38,604
Let's do this

993
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:40,873
my way.

994
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:45,169
[chuckling]

995
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:47,713
[tense music]

996
01:07:51,517 --> 01:07:54,378
Stupid Americana, why
won't you stay down?

997
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,447
That's right.

998
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,449
I'm a stupid American.

999
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,750
[grunting]

1000
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:02,153
You don't know when to quit.

1001
01:08:02,195 --> 01:08:04,864
You don't know when to lay down.

1002
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,495
We're so dumb, we're
just gonna keep coming

1003
01:08:11,537 --> 01:08:14,932
and coming until we roll
over fuckin' Berlin.

1004
01:08:14,974 --> 01:08:15,766
[thuds]

1005
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:16,600
Oh!

1006
01:08:16,642 --> 01:08:19,036
[screams]

1007
01:08:19,078 --> 01:08:19,970
[dramatic music]

1008
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,640
[speaking foreign language]

1009
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:26,852
[choking]
[crunching]

1010
01:08:30,122 --> 01:08:32,959
Where is the
scroll, little man?

1011
01:08:35,761 --> 01:08:36,596
Tell me.

1012
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:39,932
Tell me.

1013
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:46,072
Think of your daughter.

1014
01:08:48,608 --> 01:08:51,043
Think of what I'll do to her.

1015
01:08:55,781 --> 01:08:56,616
You dare?

1016
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:59,185
Kill him.

1017
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:03,155
Kill him!

1018
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:12,623
I've never tried
to control them,

1019
01:09:12,665 --> 01:09:14,267
only to guide them.

1020
01:09:17,703 --> 01:09:20,640
[gunshots booming]

1021
01:09:25,444 --> 01:09:28,214
[dramatic music]

1022
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:31,242
Enough, my friends.

1023
01:09:31,284 --> 01:09:32,810
[whirring]

1024
01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:33,686
Please.

1025
01:09:39,191 --> 01:09:40,651
[Elisa] Father.

1026
01:09:40,693 --> 01:09:41,961
[Ivan] Elisa.

1027
01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:44,655
I wasn't frightened, Father.

1028
01:09:44,697 --> 01:09:45,489
I knew you would come.

1029
01:09:45,531 --> 01:09:46,991
I saw it in my dream.

1030
01:09:47,033 --> 01:09:48,826
Thank heavens.

1031
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:50,527
What about Krabke?

1032
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:52,763
Burning in hell, if
there's any justice.

1033
01:09:52,805 --> 01:09:54,098
What about uh...

1034
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,409
[groaning]

1035
01:09:58,577 --> 01:09:59,578
Stay here.

1036
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,011
You can't

1037
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:08,888
defeat me.

1038
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:13,526
I'll see you again
in the next life.

1039
01:10:15,061 --> 01:10:16,629
I don't think so.

1040
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,459
What are you doing?

1041
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:25,396
[dramatic music]

1042
01:10:25,438 --> 01:10:26,272
No, no!

1043
01:10:28,674 --> 01:10:29,508
No! No!

1044
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:34,413
No! No!

1045
01:10:37,249 --> 01:10:39,752
[tense music]

1046
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:50,688
I'm sorry, but she
had to be stopped.

1047
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:52,356
What did you do to her, Doc?

1048
01:10:52,398 --> 01:10:55,259
It's a terrible
power I have to reach

1049
01:10:55,301 --> 01:10:58,329
into someone's soul,
to create feelings

1050
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:01,598
and desires or to
take them away.

1051
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,302
What's left when you
take them all away?

1052
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,179
No emotion, no desire,

1053
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,442
no hunger, no fear,
no love, no hate.

1054
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:14,278
Wanting nothing,
needing nothing.

1055
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,654
Feeling nothing.

1056
01:11:17,123 --> 01:11:18,716
Just an empty soul
floating through

1057
01:11:18,758 --> 01:11:20,659
time and space forever.

1058
01:11:24,263 --> 01:11:26,866
[somber music]

1059
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,226
