00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:05,396
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,977
(bells brightly ringing)

3
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:24,893
- Ah, this house has seen it all.

4
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:29,586
I've lived here since I first married.

5
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:35,702
The births of my first four
children and the fun we had.

6
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:39,559
But then my husband left.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,753
My kids grew up and they left too.

8
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,043
And then I met the
greatest man in the world

9
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:51,710
and fell in love all over again.

10
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:56,335
And then I got the surprise of my life.

11
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:59,503
And we started a second family.

12
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:04,503
And my oldest daughter started
hers and moved in with us.

13
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:08,137
So now we're just one big happy family.

14
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:12,718
Well, I'm happy.

15
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:22,387
(alarm buzzing)
(gentle music)

16
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,740
(woman groaning)
(man groaning)

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,073
Oh, yeah, good morning John.

18
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:35,450
- Good morning.
- Oh, look!

19
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,567
- Oh my God, today's the day.

20
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,094
- I know.

21
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:42,232
The day I've been looking
forward to for three months.

22
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,529
I'm going back to work,
I'm going back to work.

23
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:46,502
- How can you like this idea.

24
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:47,335
- 'Cause I want to work.

25
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:48,399
And we need the money.

26
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,724
- Well how's Robert gonna take--

27
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:51,969
- Honey, Robert's gonna just love it.

28
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,358
- He's leaving his mother,

29
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:55,004
going off to slug it out
with other kids, that's--

30
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,604
- You get your son, I'm
gonna get breakfast.

31
00:01:57,604 --> 00:01:59,650
- (sighs) Geez.

32
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,215
- Oh Mom.
- What?

33
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:02,765
- Which one should Maggie
wear for the first day,

34
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,683
the pink dress or the overalls.

35
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,372
- Do you think Maggie's gonna care?

36
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:08,103
- Overalls, so in case
some kid knocks her down,

37
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:09,798
she won't skin her knees.

38
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:10,899
- I didn't think of that.

39
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,098
All those aggressive children.

40
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:13,974
(John laughs)

41
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:17,096
- Have you seen the way
Maggie and Robert play?

42
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,162
I think it's the other
kids who oughta be worried.

43
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:21,478
- Margaret?
- What?

44
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,632
- Camera, we need to get a picture

45
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:25,411
of Robert going off to
his first day of daycare.

46
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,244
- Oh yeah.

47
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:27,093
- I'll look for it, okay.

48
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:27,970
Would you two hurry up.

49
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,713
Do you want them to be
late their first day?

50
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:30,602
- Late?

51
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:32,852
We don't want a reputation.

52
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,300
Are you excited?

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,242
Yeah, are you excited?

54
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:46,742
Yeah. (sighs)

55
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:50,528
They have no idea we're abandoning them.

56
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,530
- Well, Mommy has to go back to work.

57
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,801
Oh gee.

58
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:57,883
Margaret has to go back to work.

59
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:58,769
- Oh.

60
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,102
- I can't believe I'm calling her Mommy.

61
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:14,911
(engine revving)
(horn honks)

62
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:24,066
- Can you believe that?
- I got ya.

63
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,223
- [Mary] We should have gotten a roster

64
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:26,148
on all of the parents,

65
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:28,717
we could have called them.

66
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:29,986
- Listen, I got that meeting this morning.

67
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:31,871
You stay here and make
sure everything's okay.

68
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,669
If there's a problem, you
call me, I'll be right down.

69
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,958
- Okay, I'll be waiting on the curb.

70
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,041
- Hm.

(dispatcher chattering)

94
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:07,904
- You don't remember what today is?

95
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:12,373
- Uh, it's Monday, it's morning,
I'm vaguely aware of that.

96
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:15,136
- You don't remember what today is.

97
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:16,725
Two years ago today,

98
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:20,074
I pulled you over for running a stop sign.

99
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:21,472
It's our anniversary.

100
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:22,305
- Oh.

101
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:26,245
You remembered this.

102
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:28,495
- A good cop never forgets.

103
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:33,070
- Well, you can arrest me anytime, hm.

104
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:38,101
- However, I did have
something else in mind.

105
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,120
- Oh!

106
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,501
Oh!

107
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:44,923
Oh!

108
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:46,738

110
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:51,739
- Will you marry me, Ann?

111
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:55,989
- Mm, two years, two years
I waited for you to ask.

112
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,278
I wanted to look good!

113
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,195
Look at me!

114
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,207
- Is that a yes?

115
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:10,003
- Bet your badge on it.

116
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,889
- [Nick] (laughs) She said yes.

117
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,933

(tools thudding)

- [Ken] First day, huh?

127
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,435
- How did you know?

128
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:11,935
- The, uh, camera.

129
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,030
Did you check all the closets,

130
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,735
make sure all the fire exits are clear?

131
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:21,017
- How do you know all this?

132
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:23,100
- [Ken] My kid goes here.

133
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,862
Are your kids twins?
- No.

134
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:28,695
- No?

135
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:30,645
They're awfully close in age.

136
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:34,145
- Yeah, well the little boy is my brother.

137
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:38,933
And the little girl is my daughter.

138
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,355
- Uh huh.

139
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:43,089
- And the man is my step-father.

140
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,783
- And your mother is your sister.

141
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:48,950
I saw this movie. (laughs softly)

142
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:53,347
So, your husband couldn't come today, huh?

143
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,056
- You know, I really think it's dangerous

144
00:07:57,056 --> 00:08:00,389
that you put your child on a motorcycle.

145
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:03,561
- Tig is an experienced rider.

146
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:07,176
- Well how experienced
can he be, he's a child?

147
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:08,544
- Have you ever ridden?

148
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:09,665
- No.

149
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,045
- No?

150
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:12,945
Oh, there's nothing like it.

151
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:15,833
You know, you should
come with me sometime.

152
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,395
- Yeah, well, right now I gotta
call a cab and go to work.

153
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,483
- I could take you right now, I mean--

154
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,368
- No, no, no, thanks anyway.

155
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,309
- You sure?
- Yeah.

156
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:24,391
- It's no trouble, really.

157
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:25,641
- No, I'm fine.

158
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,116
- [Ken] No problem.

159
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,992
(window knocking)

160
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:35,250
(man laughing)

161
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,917
(gentle music)

162
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,450
- Boy awfully expensive restaurant

163
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,679
for Nick and Ann to be taking us.

164
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,295
- They have something to tell us.

165
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:53,213
I think I know what it is.

166
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:54,046
- What?

167
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,755
- I'm not gonna tell you.

168
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,566
In case I'm wrong.

169
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,983
(John sighs)

170
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,114
- You know, I think I'm gonna call Mary.

171
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:09,021
Robert got the sniffles
in school this afternoon.

172
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,201
- Honey, it's just the sniffles.

173
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:15,071
And Mary knows the
number of the restaurant.

174
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,319
- [Ann] I didn't see her car,

175
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:17,845
- Can we afford this place?
- They should be here.

176
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:18,678
John!

177
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,848
- Listen, Ann, please let me tell them.

178
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,761
I want to do this properly.

179
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:26,851
- Fine.
- Fine.

180
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:28,997
- Fine, properly.

181
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:29,830
Okay.

182
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:35,041
Mom, John, I'm sorry we're late.

183
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,302
- That's fine.
- Margaret, John.

184
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:39,471
- Nick.

185
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:42,435
- We have something that we
would like to tell you both.

186
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:45,675
- He asked me!
(women screaming)

187
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:50,058
- I knew it, I knew it!
(women laughing)

188
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:51,857
- So much for doing it properly.

189
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,135
- I knew it!
- She knew it.

190
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,314
Congratulations.
- Thank you very, much.

191
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:59,208
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, I have

192
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,812
such wonderful wedding ideas.

193
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:06,395
- Okay, yeah, Mom, this is
gonna be small and informal.

194
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:09,154
With just a few guests.

195
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,862
Now we want to have it in June.

196
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,080
In your backyard, just
like yours and Johns.

197
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,580
- Oh a June, June!

198
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:21,470
That's only, what 12 weeks!

199
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,009
Ah!

200
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:28,009
On Annie, Annie, this is your
first wedding with the family.

201
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,521
I want it to be so beautiful.

202
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:36,326
Now, the announcements I
think should be understated.

203
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:37,900
I'll write them.

204
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,733
And I see the day as
just full of white roses.

205
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:45,217
And a harp player.

206
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:46,773
- A harp player?

207
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:48,728
- Ah.
- We can still elope.

208
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:51,978
- And somewhere Honey, a touch of teal.

209
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,732
(Ann sighs)

210
00:10:56,732 --> 00:10:58,670
- What's teal?

211
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,920
- I don't really like teal.

212
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,341
- Okay I gotta go, (lips smacking).

213
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:07,126
Okay kisses, bye, bye, (lips smacking).

214
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,793
- [Child] I got one.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,832
- Hey, why don't you
come see what I've made.

216
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:14,915
I don't bite.

217
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,990
(man sighs)
(people chattering)

218
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,465
So, what do you think?

219
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:44,132
Do you like shelves?

220
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:47,618
- Yeah, they're nice.

221
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:54,881
- So did you think about my proposition?

222
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,703
My bike.

223
00:11:59,757 --> 00:12:01,070
- Oh, the bike.

224
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,987
Um, yeah, no, it wouldn't be right.

225
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:07,963
- Lady, there is nothing
more right than that bike.

226
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:09,018
Come on.
- What?

227
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,606
What are you doing?
- No, come on.

228
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,491
- I can't do this.
- Yes you can.

229
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:14,473
- I've never been on a bike.
- Well there's a first time.

230
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:15,306
- All right, wait a minute.
- Come on.

231
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:16,139
You are gonna love this.

232
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,059
- You let me go, I can walk.
- Check this out.

233
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,778
Scoured every part shop in the city.

234
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:21,282
Built it from the ground up.

235
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,657
- It's lovely.

236
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:24,068
- Lovely?

237
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,012
This ain't no hag rice burner,
you know, this is a classic.

238
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,643
There are 24 coats of hand
rubbed lacquer on this gas tank.

239
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:33,121
My lacquer, my hands.

240
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:34,636
- It's great.

241
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:35,645
- Sit on it.

242
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:36,614
- No, I have to go to work.

243
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:37,690
- Mind you this is hand stitched leather,

244
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,607
it's very comfortable, come on sit.

245
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:45,343
(engine revving)

246
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:46,328
- It's nice.

247
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:47,847
Now I really have to go.
- Now listen, listen.

248
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:49,113
Listen to this.

249
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,560
(engine revving)

250
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,151
You hear that?

251
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,173
- How can you not?

252
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,158
It's deafening.

253
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:56,988
- You just don't get it, do you.

254
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:57,821
- Get what?

255
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:01,115
I sat on it, it's a
motorcycle, can I go now?

256
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,045
- There's only way to understand.

257
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:04,123
- Wait a minute.

258
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:04,956
You can't do this!

259
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:05,789
Wait a minute.

260
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:06,622
Let me off.

261
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:07,637
Let me off!

262
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:08,470
Oh my God!

263
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,646
(man yelling)

264
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:13,892
Please, just, just go slower!

265
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:15,851
Just go slower!

266
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,622
- You said faster?
- No!

267
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:20,705
- Okay.
- No, please don't go so fast!

268
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:24,984
- Isn't this great?
- You know this is illegal.

269
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:26,817
I don't have a helmet.

270
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:31,961
- Don't worry, this cycle
will outrun the cops.

271
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:36,353
Oh now this is where you
can really open her up.

272
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:37,853
- Can, please, no!

273
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:39,959
Stop!

274
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,709
Please don't go fast!

275
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:48,132
(loud rock music)
(engine revving)

276
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:00,864
Tell me you didn't love that, ow!

277
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:01,827
- I don't believe you!

278
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:05,452
- [Ken] Sheesh, you pack
a hell of a punch girl.

279
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:06,900
- That wasn't a punch.

280
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,393
If I'd have punched you you
wouldn't be sitting on the bike.

281
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:12,281
Who do you think you are
taking off with me like that?

282
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:14,781
- Well, uh, just Ken Crawford.

283
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,364
- Well just Ken Crawford.

284
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:23,197
The next time you feel
like hijacking a woman,

285
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,823
- Yes?

286
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:32,765
(Mary groans)
(Ken laughs)

287
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:37,878
(baby laughing)
- No, no, no, please.

288
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,719
Okay, all right, okay, okay.

289
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,275
(Nick groaning)

290
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:44,358
(Nick laughing)
(Ann screeching)

291
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:46,454
(baby laughing)

292
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:47,787
- Oh no.
- Oh no.

293
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:53,717
- I still say a long
floor length white formal.

294
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,874
- Short dress, no veil.

295
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:57,423
- And no tuxes either.

296
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:58,547
(banjo strumming)

297
00:14:58,547 --> 00:14:59,934
- Okay, bath time.

298
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,743
- Oh sugar.
- Come on Robert.

299
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:02,576
Let's go.

300
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:06,090
- Mommy will be up in a minute, Sweet Pea.

301
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,971
(lips smacking)

302
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:07,804
The only thing that's going to match

303
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:09,032
about the whole wedding is the tuxes

304
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:10,856
and a white dress is so elegant.

305
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:12,556
- Margaret, I just got the pictures back

306
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:14,214
from Robert and Maggie,
you gotta see them.

307
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,243
They're great.

308
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:17,993
Oh look.
- Let me see, let me see.

309
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:21,524
Oh, look at that.

310
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:22,607
Look at that.

311
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:24,824
- John?
- Mm?

312
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,951
- (laughs) I need a favor.

313
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,776
I know there's been a
couple of times you wanted

314
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,109
to give me away.

315
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,738
Well now's your chance.

316
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:41,241
Would you give me away at my wedding?

317
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,658
- I'd be honored.

318
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:44,641
Thank you.

319
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,918
- That is so sweet.

320
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:50,216
- Oh, Mother, look at the pictures.

321
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,954
(John laughing)

322
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:54,903
- Oh, this wedding is
going to be so beautiful.

323
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:55,755
Especially if you listen to me

324
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,093
about the tuxes and the dress.

325
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:57,955
- Oh!

326
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:59,815
- I, we have to call your brothers

327
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,377
and ask them if they
will be in the wedding.

328
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,210
- He looks just like you.

329
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,234
- Yeah.

330
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:04,362
- I see it in the eyes.
(door knocking)

331
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:05,362
- Excuse me.

332
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:08,938
- Wouldn't you say that?
- Let me see.

333
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:10,251
- Surprise!

334
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:11,084
Oh.

335
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:14,444
- Can I help you?

336
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:16,295
- You must be the new one?

337
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:18,378
I'm looking for Margaret.

338
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:28,739
- Dad?

339
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,906
- Come here, baby.
- What?

340
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:36,646
- You have grown into a beautiful woman.

341
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,163
- Oh.
(man laughing)

342
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,566
- What are you doing here Richard?

343
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,331
- I read the announcement.

344
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,874
My baby is getting married.

345
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:44,879
Mm. (lips smacking)

346
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,851
I know haven't been
much of a father to Ann,

347
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:50,348
but you could have mentioned she had one?

348
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,108
I'm very happy for you sweetheart.

349
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:55,324
- Wow, I can't believe this.

350
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:57,157
It's um, Richard, Dad.

351
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,153
This is my fiance.

352
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:03,320
Nick Lundgren.

353
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,819
- Hello sir.

354
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,258
- You'd better take
care of my little girl.

355
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:10,895
- You all right?

356
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,705
- I'm sorry about the surprise
but I did bring the bubbly.

357
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:15,758
I think we all need a drink to celebrate.

358
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:18,591
Margaret, can I have some glasses.

359
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:21,234
- I'll go.

360
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,355
- Richard Becker.

361
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:26,438
- John Hicks.

362
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:28,447
- Young.

363
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:32,687
House looks great.

364
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:35,207
Different color.

365
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:36,040
- It's been over 20 years

366
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,728
since you lived here, Richard, we painted.

367
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:42,998
- Well it still feels like home.

368
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:43,831
I miss it.

369
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,604
- What, what's this about?

370
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:49,498
- I want to help with this wedding.

371
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:51,658
I've never done anything for our kids.

372
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:54,116
And now that some of my
investments are paying off,

373
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,366
I want to help.

374
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,130
- Well, is that okay Mom?

375
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:08,531
(laughs) He is my father.

376
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:11,577
- That he is.

377
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:15,700
- Here's to second chances (laughing).

378
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,783
(bright jazzy music)

379
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,423
(bottle popping)

380
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:26,423
Ah, whoa, whoa, where are
those glasses? (laughing)

381
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:33,814
(quiet somber music)

382
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:46,628
(Margaret sighing)

383
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,472
- You want to tell me about it?

384
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:07,610
- I was just thinking about the kids.

385
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,512
Ann, Ann was little.

386
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:13,955
She doesn't remember.

387
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,288
- Remember what?

388
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,109
- When Richard walked out.

389
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,043
Dennis thought it was my fault.

390
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:35,239
Andrew started taking care of things

391
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,702
most little nine-year-old boys don't have

392
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:41,369
to even think about.

393
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,086
Mary,

394
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:49,706
poor little Mary,

395
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:54,706
wouldn't even let her
grandfather pick her up. (crying)

396
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,912
- Honey, and you?

397
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:07,181
- I used to cry myself
to sleep every night

398
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:09,431
after the kids were in bed.

399
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:15,051
Oh God, I don't know how
I got up in the morning.

400
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:20,974
- Yeah, but you did.

401
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,549
Look Honey, you have a lot to be proud of.

402
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:34,276
You've got a new life.

403
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,193
Robert, me.

404
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,375
It's all different now.

405
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:41,698
- Yeah, but--

406
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,335
- No, no, no yeah buts.

407
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:46,168
It is, it's different.

408
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,418
- Okay.

409
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:57,056
(birds tweeting)

410
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,631
- I'd love to stand up at your wedding,

411
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:02,079
but as your future brother-in-law you have

412
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,986
to let me throw the bachelor party.

413
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:05,995
- Ah, you talked me into it.

414
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:07,674
- All right (laughing).

415
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:09,031
Yeah.

416
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:12,242
- You know, I hate to break
up this locker room chat.

417
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:13,481
But one rule, Denny.

418
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:17,333
No women or any variation
thereof at this bachelor party.

419
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,926
- I mean, what's a bachelor
party without a stripper or two?

420
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,675
- Kind of like a broken
arm without a cast.

421
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:25,951
(men laughing)

422
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,331
- Ah, Ann.
- Well.

423
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:28,226
- Mom, would you tell Dennis

424
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:31,281
that Nick can't have a
stripper at his bachelor party.

425
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,674
- Well, if they get one we get one.

426
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:34,898
- Okay, see there.

427
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:39,092
- Now, the lady from the wedding
shop is waiting out back.

428
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:41,593
- It was so much easier we were eloping.

429
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,980
(doorbell ringing)

430
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,956
- I'll get it.

431
00:21:43,956 --> 00:21:45,966
You go make wedding plans.

432
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:47,549
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:58,748
- Hello son.

434
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,605
(laughs) Is this any way
to treat your old man?

435
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:07,022
- You may be old.

436
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:09,855
But you're not much of a man

437
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:13,411
and you definitely don't belong to me.

438
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:17,012
- Ah, you have a right to be angry.

439
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:18,649
I understand.

440
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:19,912
- You understand.

441
00:22:19,912 --> 00:22:21,579
Hm, understand this.

442
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:26,263
(door knocking)

443
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,672
- Is your mother home?

444
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:30,561
Where's your mother.

445
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,860
- Denny, you could have let him in.

446
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,856
- He doesn't belong here.

447
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:36,519
(door knocking)

448
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,532
- Look, I know it's weird
but maybe he has changed.

449
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:42,020
(gentle music)

450
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,162
- People don't change Mare,

451
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,162
they just become more of themselves.

452
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,285
You can forgive him if you want.

453
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,785
Just don't forget.

454
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:58,700
- He's still our father, Denny.

455
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:04,199
- Whether we like it or not.

456
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:09,603
(door knocking)

457
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:11,867
- Hey, is your mother here?

458
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:14,743
(door knocking)

459
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:16,565
- We're going for a classical cake,

460
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:19,937
an ageless cake, tri-tiered
with raspberries.

461
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:23,675
- What is the matter with chocolate?

462
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:24,675
- Chocolate?

463
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:29,066
It's not a birthday cake.

464
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:32,156
It's decorum at weddings
to have white cake.

465
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:36,100
- Ann, it's our wedding, why
can't we have the cake I want.

466
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,330
- Well look, let's not lose
it over the cake, okay.

467
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,968
We only have eight weeks,
we have to order this stuff.

468
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:42,590
- Oh, well may I suggest

469
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,959
the three-tiered Forever Bliss selection.

470
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,910
It's beautiful.

471
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,993
It says love.

472
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,721
And there's enough to send
your guests home with a piece.

473
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:55,439
- Who's gonna want to
bring home white cake?

474
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,571
- [Ann] Shut up.

475
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:57,833
- [Richard] Hello everybody.

476
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:58,923
- [Beatrice] Oh.

477
00:23:58,923 --> 00:24:00,302
- Nicolas, how are you?

478
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:01,135
- Ignored.

479
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:04,390
- Oh, how are you, Honey?

480
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,198
- Oh, I'm peachy.

481
00:24:06,198 --> 00:24:08,759
- Richard Becker, Ann's father.

482
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,255
- Beatrice Miller, huh.

483
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:13,534
- Hello Richard.
- Wedding cakes.

484
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:14,439
- Yes, this is the one.

485
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:15,471
This is the one--

486
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:16,304
- Now Margaret--
- I'm voting for this one.

487
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:17,435
- Oh my.
- Margaret,

488
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:18,532
may I see you a moment?

489
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,355
- Yeah, only with teal flowers.

490
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:21,855
- With teal, teal.

491
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:26,294
- Can we find some time
together to talk next week?

492
00:24:26,294 --> 00:24:28,669
I'm gonna be looking at houses.

493
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,355
- You mean you're gonna buy a house?

494
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:31,188
Here?

495
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:33,504
- Well, I decided to stay
around the family, you know.

496
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:36,313
And I'm gonna need a realtor.

497
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:37,146
- Oh.

498
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,441
- Have you picked a cake yet?

499
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:43,635
- Yeah, um, I think we're
gonna go with this one.

500
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:45,237
- Oh, it's beautiful.

501
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:49,040
- But does it express
the breadth of your love?

502
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,065
- (groaning) It's a cake.

503
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:52,959
- Oh, yeah, like, I admit,

504
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,992
it's small but we're not
having a big wedding.

505
00:24:55,992 --> 00:24:59,200
- If you're not happy with
the cake, get a bigger one.

506
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,616
- We're on a budget.

507
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:01,927
- Well let me buy the cake.

508
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:04,917
Then she can have whatever she wants.

509
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,102
- How 'bout chocolate?

510
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:07,402
- Whatever you kids want.

511
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:09,302
But make it something to remember.

512
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:11,469
You only get married once.

513
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,860
To each other. (laughs)

514
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:19,824
Uh, what about the flowers?

515
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,265
- Yes, oh that's next.

516
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:23,467
All right, I thought cornflowers.

517
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,809
- I had some fabulous ideas I was trying

518
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:27,955
to talk your wife into.

519
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:28,788
- Ex-wife.

520
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,165
We did set a budget, Beatrice.

521
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:35,009
- Let's at least listen to
what she's got to say Margaret.

522
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:36,600
Unless you're absolutely stuck

523
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,201
on all these small
things for Ann's wedding.

524
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:41,058
- I'm not stuck.

525
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:42,058
- Oh, may I?

526
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:49,270
Picture sprays of white
roses, lilacs everywhere.

527
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:54,778
Where do you see the quartet?

528
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:57,717
- [Richard] Why settle for a quartet?

529
00:25:57,717 --> 00:25:58,997
Why not a quintet?

530
00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:00,830
- What about the harp?

531
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,644
- Gonna be okay?

532
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:06,221
Okay, Mommy gotta go.

533
00:26:06,221 --> 00:26:09,698
But I'll be back, okay, I'll be back.

534
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,601
Okay
- You stay right here, okay.

535
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:13,768
Kitty, what's that letter?

536
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:15,638
Oh yeah.

537
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:19,473
Yeah, now let's tie your shoe.

538
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:20,890
- [Child] No, no.

539
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:27,302
- Hey!

540
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:29,525
Hey!

541
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,475
So I thought you would
have had me fired by now.

542
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:35,418
- No, I wouldn't do that.

543
00:26:35,418 --> 00:26:36,506
But I don't have to talk to you.

544
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:37,600
- Just let me make it up to you.

545
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,074
How 'bout I cook you dinner.

546
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,260
(Mary sighs)

547
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,892
What are you afraid of?

548
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,480
Are you afraid of me?

549
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,710
- Your cooking.

550
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,569
- Oh yeah, I happen to be a gourmet cook.

551
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,644
You know, Julia Childs and
me, we're just like this.

552
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:51,005
- I'm sure.

553
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:52,526
- Well, you'll never know
until you try it, will ya.

554
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:56,175
- Are you gonna harass me
every time I drop off the kids?

555
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:58,342
- Until you say ya, mm-hm.

556
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:02,016
- Cook.

557
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:05,829
If I don't like it, I'm walking.

558
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:11,415
(air whooshing)

559
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:17,225
- And the kitchen was
remodeled only two years ago.

560
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:19,688
Original hardwood floors.

561
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:23,549
12 foot ceilings with mahogany beams.

562
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,960
A massive fireplace.

563
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,877
It's a beautiful house.

564
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:31,315
- You're beautiful.

565
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:33,148
- Oh, Richard stop it.

566
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:38,171
- [Richard] You always had a
hard time taking a compliment.

567
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:39,609
- Well we're not here to pay compliments,

568
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:41,315
we're here to look at houses.

569
00:27:41,315 --> 00:27:43,069
Um, it's a big place.

570
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:46,376
- Well there's room in case
Andrew comes up with the girls.

571
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:48,001
You know, big back yard.

572
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,619
It's a great pool.

573
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,853
I want to have huge
barbecues during the summers.

574
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:55,068
- You did look at the price.

575
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:56,805
- Oh, I can swing it.

576
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,471
I owe it to you.

577
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:01,121
Especially for letting me
help out with the wedding.

578
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:02,323
You know and Ann have made me feel

579
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:05,449
like a real member of the family.

580
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:07,199
It means a lot to me.

581
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,389
- You are her father. (laughs)

582
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,642
- [Richard] You raised good kids.

583
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,906
You have a lot to be proud.

584
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:17,323
- It wasn't easy.

585
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:19,571
- I'm sure.

586
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:25,794
I'm sorry.

587
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:29,543
For everything.

588
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:32,906
(gentle music)

589
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:34,239
- You should be.

590
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,540
You missed the best
parts of your kids lives.

591
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,705
Um, why don't you just
think about the house.

592
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:46,802
Or we can see others if you like.

593
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:48,543
Right now I have to
get over to Beatrice's,

594
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:50,832
I'm meeting Nick and Ann.

595
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:52,058
- [Richard] Oh good, I'll follow you.

596
00:28:52,058 --> 00:28:55,141
(upbeat jazzy music)

597
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:06,820
- Two weeks ago it was a simple dress.

598
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,987
Now you want this overpriced,

599
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:12,944
plunging neckline, Mardi Gras costume.

600
00:29:12,944 --> 00:29:15,583
- This gown makes a statement.

601
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,083
- Yeah, I owe you.

602
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,150
I mean, Ann, it would
be a whole lot different

603
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,880
if you could ever wear it again.

604
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,962
- I'll be buried in it, okay?

605
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:30,666
Look, I've never been
married in a wedding dress.

606
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,666
I want to do this right.

607
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:38,035
- Then this dress is
exactly what you need.

608
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:41,254
- You are becoming the enemy, Beatrice.

609
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:43,933
- Well if it isn't the happy couple.

610
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:45,869
Beatrice.
- Hello.

611
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:46,802
- Something the matter?

612
00:29:46,802 --> 00:29:50,071
- Mm, you got your way,
she wants a formal dress.

613
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:52,490
- (gasps) Oh, great!

614
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,546
(Richard laughing)
(Margaret laughing)

615
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,143
- This one.

616
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:59,182
- Huh?

617
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:00,099
Oh, uh huh.

618
00:30:04,957 --> 00:30:06,445
Did you see the price?

619
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:08,581
- The price can't reflect on a gown

620
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:10,748
that's a timeless classic.

621
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:14,794
- Yeah, a '57 roadster
is a timeless classic

622
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:17,487
and she's not getting married
in one of those either.

623
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:20,396
- Kids, please, this is no
way to start things off.

624
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:22,353
Marriage is tough enough.

625
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,936
You want the dress?

626
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,133
- Yeah, yes.

627
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,598
- We'll take the dress.

628
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:34,019
- Very good, Mr. Becker.

629
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:37,842
And I carry a complete
line of accessories,

630
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:39,277
perfect for this gown.

631
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:41,760
- Richard, this isn't necessary,

632
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,590
we can make a compromise, right Ann?

633
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,917
- Mom.

634
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:48,923
- Margaret, I am her father.

635
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:51,456
I haven't done anything for her in years.

636
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:52,706
Please, let me.

637
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:57,486
- Father knows best.

638
00:30:57,486 --> 00:31:00,015
(bright twangy music)
(Richard laughing)

639
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:02,515
Dad. (laughs)

640
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:04,472
Oh thank you.

641
00:31:09,845 --> 00:31:11,902
- You have fine taste, sir.

642
00:31:11,902 --> 00:31:13,694
- Uh, no, my daughter has fine taste.

643
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:15,802
I have a gold card.

644
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:19,050
(all laughing)

645
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,633
(Margaret laughs)
- Uh huh.

646
00:31:24,212 --> 00:31:26,518
Black Tux.
- Definitely.

647
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,435
- Big time.

648
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,469
(crickets chirping)

649
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:32,002
- [Mary] I'll admit, that was very good.

650
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:32,835
- See.

651
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:35,774
You have to trust me.

652
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:42,778
You have a hard time with that, don't ya.

653
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:45,195
- Oh, I'm not used to dating.

654
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:49,964
- Well after you've been off the market

655
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:52,584
for a while it's kind of tough.

656
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:53,417
- Yeah.

657
00:31:55,668 --> 00:31:58,751
I've never really been on the market.

658
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:08,131
I was in a religious order
for eight years. (laughs)

659
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:13,352
- What about Maggie?

660
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,824
- Well, I wanted a baby.

661
00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:22,824
And so, Maggie's father was
willing to accommodate. (laughs)

662
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:33,092
- Oh, well that's uh, that's
uh, that's understandable.

663
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,894
(clears throat) I guess.

664
00:32:35,894 --> 00:32:37,206
Uh, listen, I'm gonna be right back,

665
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,623
I just gonna go check on Tig.

666
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:52,796
- Okay.

667
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:56,410
Oh God.

668
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,188
(crickets chirping)

669
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,841
(Mary laughing)

670
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:31,692
- Busted.

671
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:34,284
- I don't believe you.

672
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:36,731
- Well, don't get mad, you know, I.

673
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,318
Look, I didn't get home in
time to stoke the stove,

674
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,818
so I, I got stuck.

675
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:47,989
(gentle music)

676
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,887
- I better go.

677
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:18,833
(Ken blows raspberry)

678
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:26,331
- [Ann] Nick, you're not inviting

679
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,400
all your cop buddies, are you?

680
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,022
- It's a tradition at the station.

681
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:33,520
- Look guys, we must cut
40 people off this list

682
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,034
and get these invitation
in the mail by Friday.

683
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,030
Now we have one month.

684
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,626
I mean we're never gonna
get all these people

685
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:41,209
into the back yard.

686
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:44,912
- What's going on.

687
00:34:44,912 --> 00:34:47,593
- Oh, we're cutting the invitation's list.

688
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:49,153
Any thoughts?

689
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,934
- Yeah, it's kind of up to Nick and Ann.

690
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:53,253
- Thank you, John.

691
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:54,772
Glad to see somebody recognizes the fact

692
00:34:54,772 --> 00:34:56,689
that I'm involved here.

693
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:01,133
- What about, what about
Uncle Bill and Aunt Dotty?

694
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,698
They won't come anyway.

695
00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:05,931
- Oh, they never come
but the send great gifts,

696
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:06,923
we should leave 'em.

697
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:09,173
Just give me just a second.

698
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:12,886
- Now look.

699
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:15,877
- John?
- Yeah?

700
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:26,086
- I need a big favor.
- Sure.

701
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,454
- Well, my dad's back.

702
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:28,646
- He is?

703
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:32,902
I wondered who that guy was
hanging out in the dining room.

704
00:35:32,902 --> 00:35:37,452
- Yeah (laughs) well, um, with my dad back

705
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:40,369
and paying for part of the wedding.

706
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:45,892
I thought maybe he should
give me away at the wedding.

707
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:46,725
- Ah.

708
00:35:48,295 --> 00:35:49,189
- It's not that I'm not aware

709
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,385
of everything you've done for me.

710
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:55,527
It's (sighs).

711
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,610
It's just he's my father.

712
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:06,244
- It's okay, I understand.

713
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:11,409
- Yeah? (laughs)

714
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:13,655
Thanks.

715
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:17,919
Thanks for understanding.

716
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:18,752
- Sure.

717
00:36:19,854 --> 00:36:22,437
(gentle music)

718
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,655
- Go cut the guest list.

719
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:41,436
- Don't, Margaret.

720
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:42,732
He is her father,

721
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:47,267
I just don't like him
hanging out at our house.

722
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:49,205
- He's involved in this wedding.

723
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:53,355
- Yeah, and if not the wedding,
you're showing him houses.

724
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:54,272
- Oh, John.

725
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,394
Every since the baby
came it seems like you

726
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:03,227
and I just, we never
have time to be together.

727
00:37:05,845 --> 00:37:07,595
And now this wedding.

728
00:37:09,046 --> 00:37:11,824
I think you and I should
find some time to--

729
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:12,741
- Margaret.

730
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,361
We need you back in there.

731
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:18,194
Pronto.

732
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:21,518
(John sighs)

733
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:22,351
- Pronto.

734
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:26,437
(bright jazzy music)

735
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:29,187
(Margaret sighs)

736
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,438
- [Ann] You're dating a biker?

737
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:34,030
- Oh, Ann, he's not a biker.

738
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,346
I mean, he has a motorcycle
but he also has a child.

739
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:38,182
- (snickers) Well he's
probably got dozens more

740
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:39,846
across the country.

741
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:41,514
You want me to have
Nick run a check on him.

742
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:42,703
- No!

743
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:43,623
- He could be a Hell's Angel

744
00:37:43,623 --> 00:37:48,402
or wanted in Arizona for
bank robbery, you never know.

745
00:37:48,402 --> 00:37:50,319
Have you met his gang?

746
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:52,359
- Gang?

747
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,493
- All bikers have gangs.

748
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:56,742
God, you're sticking me.

749
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:59,046
- [Beatrice] Oh sorry, dear.

750
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:03,910
- Yeah, don't let him get
you alone with his gang.

751
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,826
- Why?

752
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:06,614
- Th initiation.

753
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:07,447
You're gonna be chuggin' beer

754
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:10,851
and swappin' spit with
guys named Mongo and Snake.

755
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:13,096
- Ann, he doesn't have a gang.

756
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:16,193
He's a construction
worker and he has a son.

757
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,380
- Fine, fine, don't say I didn't warn you.

758
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,608
(groans) So, did you do it?

759
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:24,027
(Beatrice huffs)

760
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:25,860
- No, we didn't do it!

761
00:38:27,746 --> 00:38:31,375
- [Ann] It's only a matter of time.

762
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,292
(engine puttering)

763
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:42,850
- [Dennis] That was a
hell of a catch, John.

764
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,900
- Yes, yes it was.
- For an old guy.

765
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,558
- What!
- Yeah (laughs).

766
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,092
- For an old guy?
- For an old guy.

767
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:51,072
- [John] Listen, man,
I went three for three.

768
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:52,299
You know that that means, three for three,

769
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:55,802
not only that man did
you give me four RBI.

770
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:57,333
- You batted three times, I know that.

771
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,066
- Honey, we're home.

772
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,015
You should have been there.

773
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:01,732
We blew 'em away!

774
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:03,982
- I'm in the kitchen, dear.

775
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:12,964
There's one for you, one for you.

776
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,152
Put it over here.

777
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,291
- What are you doing here?

778
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,174
- I'm feeding the kids.

779
00:39:16,174 --> 00:39:17,260
- Where's Margaret.

780
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,121
- Well, the girls wanted to try

781
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,324
on the dresses for the wedding.

782
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,956
Margaret's showing a house.

783
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:23,071
So I said I'd stay with the kids

784
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:25,029
so they could take their time.

785
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,857
- My mother must be losing her mind.

786
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:28,680
You couldn't take care of your own kids.

787
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,519
- Thanks, I'll take over.

788
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:32,936
- Everything's under control.

789
00:39:34,396 --> 00:39:36,784
(baby babbling)

790
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:39,617
- Ah, cocktails with the kids.

791
00:39:39,617 --> 00:39:43,789
Put a little in their
cereal they take good naps.

792
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:46,191
- Drinking, while you're
alone with the children?

793
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:47,974
- I raised four kids, John.

794
00:39:47,974 --> 00:39:49,402
There's no problem.

795
00:39:49,402 --> 00:39:50,863
- You raised four kids?

796
00:39:50,863 --> 00:39:53,099
You got another family I don't know about?

797
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,196
- I changed plenty of your dirty diapers.

798
00:39:55,196 --> 00:39:58,160
- Yeah, and then you
took a 22 year vacation.

799
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,910
Glad you're back after your rest.

800
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:08,213
- You can go back to
wherever you're staying.

801
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:10,546
I'll watch the children now.

802
00:40:13,774 --> 00:40:14,607
- John--

803
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:17,190
- My patience is very thin.

804
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,299
- I'm not in competition with you.

805
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,364
I want you to know that.

806
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:21,245
- I want you to know something.

807
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:23,476
I know what your game is
and it's not gonna work.

808
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:26,033
Now find the door and use it.

809
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:29,616
(upbeat quirky music)

810
00:40:29,616 --> 00:40:32,366
(child laughing)

811
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:44,773
All right Robert my man.

812
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:48,635
(John and Robert laughing)

813
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:51,385
(engine revving)

814
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:08,302
- [Margaret] Oh (laughs).

815
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,346
- [Ken] How you doin'.

816
00:41:09,346 --> 00:41:10,285
- Hello again.

817
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:12,267
- Hi, I'm Margaret, I'm Mary's mother.

818
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:14,128
- Hi, I'm Ken.

819
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:15,902
Could you tell Mary I'm here?

820
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:18,360
- (laughs) I think she heard you.

821
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,357
- Hi, um, this is my mom and you met John.

822
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:23,566
- Yeah.

823
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:26,566
Uh, listen, I got you a little gift.

824
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,987
- Oh, this is great.

825
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,250
Isn't this great.

826
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:36,516
- Great.
- In lieu of flowers.

827
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:43,718
- We won't be late.
- Don't drive to fast.

828
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:46,468
(engine revving)

829
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:54,179
She gets a tattoo I'm killing myself.

830
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,846
(John laughing)

831
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:04,415
- [Ann] Dad's staying in a nice place,

832
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,194
nice and pricey don't you think.

833
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,027
En suite.

834
00:42:09,064 --> 00:42:10,889
- Excuse me.

835
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:14,246
I'm Margaret Hicks, we're
meeting Richard Becker for lunch.

836
00:42:14,246 --> 00:42:17,329
- Mrs. Hicks, correct, walk this way.

837
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:20,380
- [Man] I know.

838
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,730
- I can't walk that way.

839
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:26,966
- Try, dear.
(Ann laughing)

840
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:29,966
(people chattering)

841
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,252
- [Man] Yeah.

842
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:36,853
(people chattering)

843
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:39,369
- I don't maybe they're gonna like take us

844
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:40,202
through the kitchen.

845
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:42,434
- Richard probably
planned a surprise, Honey.

846
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,474
- Won't take us through the kitchen.

847
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:46,436
- Oh no, well let's ask him?

848
00:42:46,436 --> 00:42:49,950
- He seems to know what he's doing, but.

849
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,783
Uh, oh no.

850
00:42:52,126 --> 00:42:53,407
Oh wait.

851
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:54,869
Wait, excuse me.

852
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:57,429
I think there's been a mistake.

853
00:42:57,429 --> 00:42:58,926
- There's no mistake.

854
00:42:58,926 --> 00:43:00,247
(Ann laughing)

855
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:01,227
(laughs) What do you think.

856
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:03,421
Is this a great place for a reception?

857
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:04,654
There you go.

858
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:06,390
- A reception here?

859
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,651
- And I've found a great
chapel, I've booked them both.

860
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:11,597
- Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

861
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:14,834
We're having the wedding and
the reception in the backyard.

862
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:16,427
- Well you were saying that
there wasn't enough room

863
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,028
for everybody, so this way we
can invite all your friends.

864
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:23,861
Now, picture a band
there, a dance floor here,

865
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:30,502
cake over there and a sit down
dinner for all your guests.

866
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:34,488
- It would be unbelievable.

867
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:35,321
(Richard laughing)

868
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,006
- Richard, this is just a bit much.

869
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:37,901
- And when they announce,

870
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:41,557
will the parents of the bride
please join the newlyweds

871
00:43:41,557 --> 00:43:45,334
for a dance, we can show
them how it used to be done.

872
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:46,618
(Margaret gasps)

873
00:43:46,618 --> 00:43:49,118
(Ann humming)

874
00:43:56,865 --> 00:44:00,365
(Ann and Richard humming)

875
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:07,699
- Oh, Mom.

876
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:10,699
- We have to get lunch.

877
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:13,910
We have a lot of things to do.

878
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,577
- [Richard] Your mother's right.

879
00:44:17,747 --> 00:44:19,747
- [Margaret] What, here?

880
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,701
- Why not? (laughs)

881
00:44:25,102 --> 00:44:26,677
Well.

882
00:44:26,677 --> 00:44:30,084
(women laughing)

883
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,001
(Richard laughing)

884
00:44:46,663 --> 00:44:49,189
(Margaret laughing)
(Richard laughing)

885
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:52,185
- Well, uh, thank you
for bringing me home.

886
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:54,615
Um, I think we got a lot accomplished.

887
00:44:54,615 --> 00:44:57,405
- I'm having the best
time with you and Ann.

888
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:59,405
It really takes me back.

889
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:03,116
- Well it's making Ann very happy.

890
00:45:04,422 --> 00:45:05,839
- What about you?

891
00:45:06,906 --> 00:45:07,739
- Me?

892
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,630
- I'm, I'm very glad you're
a part of this Richard.

893
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:19,047
I'm very glad you're
taking some responsibility.

894
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:22,547
- It means a lot to me to do this for Ann.

895
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:29,462
- Say, have you got time
to have a drink with me?

896
00:45:31,864 --> 00:45:34,442
- I can't do that, Richard.

897
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:38,983
- Not even to celebrate
your sale of the house.

898
00:45:38,983 --> 00:45:42,121
- Are you gonna buy the house?

899
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:43,871
But that's wonderful.

900
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,606
I just know you're
going to be very happy--

901
00:45:49,606 --> 00:45:52,189
(gentle music)

902
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:57,798
(Richard sighs)

903
00:46:00,034 --> 00:46:02,617
- We'll always have that spark.

904
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:13,365
I'll come by your office
tomorrow to fill out the papers.

905
00:46:13,365 --> 00:46:16,448
(quiet somber music)

906
00:46:29,226 --> 00:46:31,014
- Wet this please, moisture.

907
00:46:31,014 --> 00:46:33,450
(Mary laughs)

908
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,700
- So you really want to meet my father?

909
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:39,097
- What?

910
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:41,373
I thought all daughters were supposed

911
00:46:41,373 --> 00:46:43,653
to be in love with their fathers.

912
00:46:43,653 --> 00:46:46,903
- He walked out on us when I was eight.

913
00:46:48,696 --> 00:46:50,592
- That explains a lot.

914
00:46:50,592 --> 00:46:51,861
- It's not why I entered the convent,

915
00:46:51,861 --> 00:46:54,539
if that's what you're thinking.

916
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:55,613
- I meant, why you have

917
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:58,736
such a hard time trusting other people.

918
00:46:58,736 --> 00:46:59,947
- Oh, I think I trust other people

919
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:02,280
probably more than I should.

920
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:09,621
- I'm falling for you, Mary.

921
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,204
(gentle music)

922
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:19,701
- Yeah, right.

923
00:47:24,655 --> 00:47:25,965
- See what I mean?

924
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:26,798
- What?

925
00:47:28,286 --> 00:47:31,369
It's not that I don't trust you, Ken.

926
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:35,389
I don't know what I'm feeling.

927
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:39,147
This is, uh, I'm not used to this.

928
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,411
(Ken sighs)

929
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:51,744
- I don't want to scare you.

930
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:56,874
- And I don't want to disappoint you.

931
00:47:59,352 --> 00:48:01,352
- I am not disappointed.

932
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,933
See the way you look
at me, I feel special.

933
00:48:14,504 --> 00:48:15,337
- You are.

934
00:48:20,793 --> 00:48:21,626
- Okay.

935
00:48:23,907 --> 00:48:26,907
We'll take this as slow as you want.

936
00:48:48,313 --> 00:48:50,548
(both laughing)

937
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:52,548
- Ah, ah, ah, I'm blind.

938
00:48:55,754 --> 00:48:58,240
Oh you are gonna get it.

939
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,377
- [Margaret] Now just
concentrate, Annie, you can do it.

940
00:49:00,377 --> 00:49:01,541
- Okay, wait, wait.
- Okay.

941
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:02,669
- Hang on.
- Okay.

942
00:49:02,669 --> 00:49:03,903
- All right, wait.

943
00:49:03,903 --> 00:49:05,307
- Good.
- Hold it.

944
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:06,298
Hold it.
- You got it?

945
00:49:06,298 --> 00:49:08,163
- Wait a minute, okay.

946
00:49:08,163 --> 00:49:09,289
I got it, wait.

947
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:12,198
Oh!
(crowd groans)

948
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:13,168
- That was your fault Ann,

949
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:14,950
you have to stretch out your neck.

950
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,095
- I can't pass an orange,
my neck's not big enough.

951
00:49:18,095 --> 00:49:20,234
- Now if we were using our mouths.

952
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:21,474
(Margaret and Ann laughing)

953
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,067
- Oh, could you say
that again, Mrs. Hicks?

954
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:24,401
I want to write down every funny thing

955
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:27,330
that's said for Ann's memory book.

956
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,329
- Don't sweat it, Trish, I'll remember.

957
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:32,816
- I guess you win the orange pass.

958
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:34,696
- I should have won.

959
00:49:34,696 --> 00:49:37,350
- Well, maybe you'll
with the clothespin drop

960
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,203
or the name the baby game.

961
00:49:39,203 --> 00:49:40,966
- The clothespin drop!

962
00:49:40,966 --> 00:49:43,171
No wait, the pasta shell game

963
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:45,275
and then the cotton ball scoop.

964
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:46,700
(woman groaning)
- So exciting.

965
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,309
- Where (laughs), where
did you get these games?

966
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:50,709
- Well honey, we used to play this

967
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:53,248
at bridal showers all the time.

968
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:55,381
(women groaning)

969
00:49:55,381 --> 00:49:58,114
- Okay, everybody's bored.

970
00:49:58,114 --> 00:49:58,947
- [All] No.

971
00:49:58,947 --> 00:49:59,780
- Am I wrong?

972
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,628
- [All] No.

973
00:50:00,628 --> 00:50:04,911
- Okay, I did something that
I swore I would never do.

974
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:06,089
- Uh oh.
- Mm-hm.

975
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:07,366
- I called the police.

976
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:08,199

977
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:09,751

978

Yeah!

1052
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,532
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1053
00:52:52,532 --> 00:52:55,851
Anybody home? (laughs)

1054
00:52:55,851 --> 00:52:59,548
I thought that there was
a party here. (laughing)

1055
00:52:59,548 --> 00:53:00,381
Huh?

1056
00:53:01,432 --> 00:53:02,752
Hey, how's it goin'.

1057
00:53:02,752 --> 00:53:03,705
- Hello, Mr. Becker.

1058
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:07,491
- Nicholas, I know my son
didn't invite me to your party

1059
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:10,186
but I didn't want this time
honored tradition to go by

1060
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:13,326
without a little gift from
your future father-in-law.

1061
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:16,307
Nicholas, these are my friends.

1062
00:53:16,307 --> 00:53:18,207
- I'm Chastity.

1063
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,076
And this is Divinity.

1064
00:53:20,076 --> 00:53:23,743
- Nicholas, these girls
will do anything you want.

1065
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:24,860
And they have some talent--

1066
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,714
- Have you girls been
paid for your services?

1067
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:30,889
- Hey John, they're not for you.

1068
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:32,617
- Yeah, we usually get a tip regardless.

1069
00:53:32,617 --> 00:53:34,917
- Great, go buy your mother
a card, let's go, out.

1070
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:37,935
- [Richard] I paid good money for them.

1071
00:53:37,935 --> 00:53:39,695
- You bring two hookers into my home

1072
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:41,789
for the guy who's marrying your daughter?

1073
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,296
You're sick.

1074
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:46,076
- You should do something
about your bitterness, Denny.

1075
00:53:46,076 --> 00:53:47,232
- Oh, I'll do something about it.

1076
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:49,180
- Hey, hey, Denny
- hey, hey.

1077
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,499
Not the time or the place.

1078
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:52,399
Why don't you help Nick with his gifts.

1079
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,273
- I don't have to take
this from my own son.

1080
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,598
- Yeah, well then get the hell out.

1081
00:53:55,598 --> 00:53:57,018
- Fine!

1082
00:53:57,018 --> 00:53:59,188
My own son doesn't want me in his home.

1083
00:53:59,188 --> 00:54:00,021
Fine.

1084
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,090
He hates me.

1085
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,178
My own son hates me.

1086
00:54:03,178 --> 00:54:05,351
My own son hates me. (crying)
- Come on.

1087
00:54:05,351 --> 00:54:08,518
(gentle somber music)

1088
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:23,547
- You do remember the
wedding's not at the house?

1089
00:54:23,547 --> 00:54:24,380
Okey-doke.

1090
00:54:25,581 --> 00:54:26,664
See you then.

1091
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:31,179
(phone ringing)

1092
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:32,429
Margaret Hicks.

1093
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,356
(clock ticking)

1094
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:44,619
Insufficient funds.

1095
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:49,737
Well, I think there must be.

1096
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:56,086
Could you give me time to find?

1097
00:54:58,716 --> 00:55:01,133
Yes, of course, I understand.

1098
00:55:04,032 --> 00:55:04,865
Cool down.

1099
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:07,603
- What's the matter?

1100
00:55:07,603 --> 00:55:10,186
- Oh, his escrow check bounced.

1101
00:55:11,587 --> 00:55:13,406
- Richard's?

1102
00:55:13,406 --> 00:55:17,073
- Oh, I can't believe
I fell for this again.

1103
00:55:18,322 --> 00:55:22,495
- Well, you gave him the
benefit of the doubt.

1104
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:25,495
(Margaret laughing)

1105
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:31,702
- (sighs) Maybe too much benefit.

1106
00:55:31,702 --> 00:55:33,281
Where are you car keys.

1107
00:55:33,281 --> 00:55:35,448
- On the table.
- Come on.

1108
00:55:39,316 --> 00:55:44,316
(bells tinkling)
(light flute music)

1109
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:46,922
- Beatrice?

1110
00:55:48,213 --> 00:55:51,546
- [Beatrice] Well, nothing was paid for.

1111
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:54,375
- What do you mean, nothing?

1112
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,554
The dress, the flowers, the cake.

1113
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:59,701
- Your husband's credit
card was over its limit.

1114
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:00,749
- That's ex-husband.

1115
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:02,281
- Whatever.

1116
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:05,407
I've called him and got a check.

1117
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:06,907
Boing boing boing.

1118
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:12,288
- Uh, what happens if we give
you a check now, a good one?

1119
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:14,696
- (laughs) Too late, I had another girl

1120
00:56:14,696 --> 00:56:18,268
who loved the gown so I sold it to her.

1121
00:56:18,268 --> 00:56:21,479
(Margaret gasps)

1122
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:24,146
I canceled the flowers and cake.

1123
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:27,066
Hm.

1124
00:56:33,084 --> 00:56:35,441
- Can I use your phone?

1125
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:36,274
- Hm?

1126
00:56:54,058 --> 00:56:55,757
- Yes, hello, I'm checking

1127
00:56:55,757 --> 00:56:57,363
on the Becker-Lundgren,

1128
00:56:57,363 --> 00:57:00,363
- Reception.
- Reception on the 11th.

1129
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:04,588
I see, thank you very much.

1130
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,421
Canceled.

1131
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:07,949
Two weeks before the wedding.

1132
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:09,989
This is kill, Ann.

1133
00:57:09,989 --> 00:57:10,822
- And when I get through

1134
00:57:10,822 --> 00:57:14,606
with Richard he's gonna wish he were dead.

1135
00:57:14,606 --> 00:57:18,240
(thunder booming)

1136
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,907
(rain drumming)

1137
00:57:30,562 --> 00:57:32,911
(man coughing)

1138
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:34,323
- [Richard] Wow Ann,

1139
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:36,057
I want to see that adorable
grandchild of mine.

1140
00:57:36,057 --> 00:57:37,229
- [Mary] Uh, Dad, I
think you've had too much

1141
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:38,668
to drink tonight.

1142
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:40,230
- [Richard] I was
celebrating with my daughter.

1143
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,430
- [Mary] I know, but I think
you should come in maybe

1144
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,781
and have some coffee and
maybe sleep on the couch.

1145
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:45,888
- [Richard] No, no,
no, he doesn't like me.

1146
00:57:45,888 --> 00:57:46,750
- [Mary] Who?

1147
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,734
- [Richard] Margaret's new husband.

1148
00:57:47,734 --> 00:57:48,567
- [Mary] Oh no.

1149
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:49,807
- [Richard] You are such a good girl.

1150
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:50,640
- [Mary] Oh Dad.

1151
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,541
- [Richard] I want to
see my granddaughter.

1152
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:53,646
- [Mary] Okay, well we just
have to be a little quiet.

1153
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:55,562
- [Richard] I want to see her.

1154
00:57:55,562 --> 00:57:56,865
Oh, that's great.
- Sh.

1155
00:57:56,865 --> 00:57:58,045
You have to be a little quiet, Dad.

1156
00:57:58,045 --> 00:57:59,606
- [Richard] Where's my
granddaughter, I want to see her.

1157
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:01,408
- No, you don't want to
see her because she's not,

1158
00:58:01,408 --> 00:58:02,846
I think she's sleeping.

1159
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,051
So let me go up and check.

1160
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:05,506
- [Richard] Do you know that have turned

1161
00:58:05,506 --> 00:58:07,589
into a lovely young lady.

1162
00:58:08,624 --> 00:58:09,538
- Thank you, Dad.

1163
00:58:09,538 --> 00:58:10,668
Do you want some coffee?

1164
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:11,501
- [Richard] No, I uh--

1165
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:12,334
- I'll get some coffee.

1166
00:58:12,334 --> 00:58:14,039
But let me check and I'll get her.

1167
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:14,905
- [Richard] Bring her to me.

1168
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:15,738
- I'll bring her, but sh.

1169
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:17,988
- [Richard] Bring her down.

1170
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:23,706
(Richard humming)

1171
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:32,062
- (sighs) Mom?

1172
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:32,895
Mom!

1173
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,509
- What?

1174
00:58:36,509 --> 00:58:40,176
- Dad's downstairs, he's drunk
and he wants to see Maggie.

1175
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:42,093
- Richard's downstairs?

1176
00:58:43,222 --> 00:58:44,389
Oh ho, ho, ho.

1177
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,748
- Where is my gorgeous
little granddaughter.

1178
00:58:53,748 --> 00:58:55,298
- Dad.
- Richard, please!

1179
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:56,775
Listen to me, the babies are asleep.

1180
00:58:56,775 --> 00:58:58,160
Now you leave them be.

1181
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,581
I want to talk to you.

1182
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:01,117
You wait for me downstairs.

1183
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:03,454
- Oh, I know that tone.

1184
00:59:03,454 --> 00:59:05,799
I am in trouble again.

1185
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:07,370
I just want to see my granddaughter.

1186
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:09,112
- Dad, please!

1187
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,245
- Richard, downstairs.

1188
00:59:11,245 --> 00:59:12,162
Downstairs!

1189
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:17,519
(thunder crashing)

1190
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:19,203
Oh my God, John's in the study working.

1191
00:59:19,203 --> 00:59:20,385
I hope he doesn't hear Richard,

1192
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:21,692
he's already furious with him.

1193
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:22,879
- Why?

1194
00:59:22,879 --> 00:59:24,201
- Oh, don't you worry
about that, it's just--

1195
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:25,934
(baby crying)

1196
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:29,121
(body thudding)
(glass shattering)

1197
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:32,616
(dramatic music)

1198
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:33,983
- Dad?

1199
00:59:33,983 --> 00:59:36,149
- [Margaret] Richard!

1200
00:59:36,149 --> 00:59:36,982
- Richard!

1201
00:59:38,557 --> 00:59:39,646
(Margaret gasping)

1202
00:59:39,646 --> 00:59:40,479
Richard!

1203
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:43,765
- Oh God.
- Oh my Lord.

1204
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:44,638
Call 4-1-1.
- oh yeah.

1205
00:59:44,638 --> 00:59:47,204
No, not 4-1-1 that's information.

1206
00:59:47,204 --> 00:59:48,856
It's 9-1-1.
- 9-1-1.

1207
00:59:48,856 --> 00:59:50,271
- Margaret, sh, sh.
- Sh, sh.

1208
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:51,220
And a first aid kit.

1209
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,548
And ice, get and ice pack.

1210
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:53,772
- Okay we know CPR, we know CPR.

1211
00:59:53,772 --> 00:59:55,065
- I forgot it.

1212
00:59:55,065 --> 00:59:57,309
- Margaret, Margaret.

1213
00:59:57,309 --> 00:59:59,809
You may not need the ice pack.

1214
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:02,435
He's dead.

1215
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:07,140
- What?

1216
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,319
- He's dead.

1217
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,025
- Dead?

1218
01:00:16,057 --> 01:00:16,890
- Dead.

1219
01:00:19,436 --> 01:00:22,269
(thunder booming)

1220
01:00:28,985 --> 01:00:32,804
- Oh this is gonna make the wedding.

1221
01:00:32,804 --> 01:00:35,721
(thunder crashing)

1222
01:00:43,046 --> 01:00:45,629
(somber music)

1223
01:01:02,141 --> 01:01:06,431
- I know this can't be
easy, losing your dad.

1224
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,014
- He was never the best father.

1225
01:01:10,323 --> 01:01:11,490
- Well, still.

1226
01:01:13,276 --> 01:01:15,693
He's the only one you've got.

1227
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,510
- (sighs) I want to be
sad that he just came back

1228
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:27,510
into our life and now he's
gone but all I feel is this.

1229
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:30,703
- That's all right to be angry.

1230
01:01:30,703 --> 01:01:31,537
- Yeah, but why?

1231
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:33,284
Why am I so mad at him?

1232
01:01:33,284 --> 01:01:35,534
- The guy walked out on ya.

1233
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:42,512
- Did you love him?

1234
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:48,827
- He was never there.

1235
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:53,304
- Loving somebody

1236
01:01:53,304 --> 01:01:56,929
that you don't think loves
you back, that hurts.

1237
01:01:56,929 --> 01:01:57,762
You know.

1238
01:01:59,273 --> 01:02:01,856
You've got a right to be angry.

1239
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:17,584
It's okay to love somebody else.

1240
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,208
- Can I stay here tonight?

1241
01:02:30,022 --> 01:02:33,855
I mean, I just want to
be held and that's all.

1242
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:40,695
- If that's what you need, I'm your man.

1243
01:02:54,284 --> 01:02:57,367
(somber flute music)

1244
01:03:17,925 --> 01:03:18,951
- Thank you.

1245
01:03:18,951 --> 01:03:20,284
Andrew, hi baby.

1246
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:22,958
Oh.

1247
01:03:24,197 --> 01:03:25,297
- John.
- Andrew.

1248
01:03:25,297 --> 01:03:27,430
- I'm glad you got in for this.

1249
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,810
- Oh, he was my dad.

1250
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:30,810
I loved him.

1251
01:03:31,856 --> 01:03:35,439
He was like the little
brother I never had.

1252
01:03:35,439 --> 01:03:37,687
(Margaret laughing)

1253
01:03:37,687 --> 01:03:38,744
Denny.

1254
01:03:38,744 --> 01:03:39,577
- Andrew.

1255
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:42,214
- [Margaret] Where are the girls?

1256
01:03:42,214 --> 01:03:44,137
- Oh, they're staying with friends.

1257
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:47,211
Dad sent 'em some plane
tickets for the wedding.

1258
01:03:47,211 --> 01:03:50,463
They're bouncing all the way here.

1259
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:53,630
- The tickets weren't paid for either?

1260
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:55,727
- Either?

1261
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,460
- Oh.

1262
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,400
Never mind, nothing.

1263
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,400
Say hello to your sisters,
they're not taking this too well.

1264
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:08,764
- Annie, how you doing?
- Good to see you.

1265
01:04:08,764 --> 01:04:09,796
(Margaret hissing)

1266
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:12,546
- Um, when are we gonna tell Ann?

1267
01:04:13,914 --> 01:04:16,164
- Let's bury Richard first.

1268
01:04:18,762 --> 01:04:20,433
I can't believe that on
top of everything else,

1269
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:23,183
now we're paying for the funeral.

1270
01:04:25,548 --> 01:04:27,811
- It's just like him, isn't it?

1271
01:04:27,811 --> 01:04:30,061
He's where he wants to be.

1272
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:33,343
But we have to climb up to him.

1273
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:36,616
- Oh, you know, Dad always did
want to have the last laugh.

1274
01:04:36,616 --> 01:04:39,449
- Come on now, it's just a hill.

1275
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:41,116
- [John] Whoa, whoa.

1276
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:44,468
- A muddy hill.

1277
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:47,219
- Uh, you guys want to help your sisters?

1278
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:48,228
Whoa.

1279
01:04:48,228 --> 01:04:50,515
And, uh, take your time about it.

1280
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:52,853
It's not like he's going anywhere.

1281
01:04:52,853 --> 01:04:54,186
You okay?
- Yes.

1282
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,887
- Oh, geez, all right.
- Careful.

1283
01:05:02,484 --> 01:05:04,369
- For each of us begins as dust

1284
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:07,435
and to the earth we all must return.

1285
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:09,618
(gentle music)

1286
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:13,833
But as the human, as the
human body is interred

1287
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:17,680
in the earth, resting there for eternity,

1288
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,426
our souls rest with God in
his eternal light, amen.

1289
01:05:22,426 --> 01:05:23,975
- [Audience] Amen.

1290
01:05:23,975 --> 01:05:26,269
- Uh, since I was not
a friend of Richard's,

1291
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:29,429
I always ask the eldest
son if he would come up

1292
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:33,096
and say a few words on
behalf of the family.

1293
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,964
- You do it, say something.

1294
01:05:36,964 --> 01:05:39,243
- I'm not the oldest, you're the oldest.

1295
01:05:39,243 --> 01:05:41,243
- [Mary] Come on, Denny.

1296
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,243
- Go on.

1297
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:47,985
(Denny sighs)

1298
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:08,921
- My father wanted more
than anything to be loved.

1299
01:06:13,574 --> 01:06:16,657
But he was very afraid of being loved

1300
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:21,048
because it meant committing to someone.

1301
01:06:23,616 --> 01:06:25,908
So if there's anything

1302
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:29,600
that we can learn from Richard Becker,

1303
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,933
it's that we need to love
because people deserve it.

1304
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:42,111
Not because we want them to love us.

1305
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:52,003
- To conclude our service today,

1306
01:06:52,003 --> 01:06:54,055
I would ask a member of the family to come

1307
01:06:54,055 --> 01:06:56,590
and place a rose on the casket

1308
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:00,340
before we inter Richard's
body to the ground.

1309
01:07:20,338 --> 01:07:23,269
(casket crashing)
(women gasping)

1310
01:07:23,269 --> 01:07:26,102
(casket creaking)

1311
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:32,742
(casket thudding)

1312
01:07:35,615 --> 01:07:38,698
(upbeat jazzy music)

1313
01:07:52,604 --> 01:07:54,494
(Margaret sighing)

1314
01:07:54,494 --> 01:07:56,858
- Oh, should we tell
her now, do you think?

1315
01:07:56,858 --> 01:07:58,075
- Yes, let's do.

1316
01:07:58,075 --> 01:08:00,733
Yeah, you know, I think she's
gonna take it just fine.

1317
01:08:00,733 --> 01:08:02,056
I mean, she didn't even want a big wedding

1318
01:08:02,056 --> 01:08:03,009
in the first place.

1319
01:08:03,009 --> 01:08:05,527
- True, she didn't really want
the big dress or the cake.

1320
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:06,554
- Only after Richard talked her

1321
01:08:06,554 --> 01:08:09,374
into all that stuff did she finally agree.

1322
01:08:09,374 --> 01:08:11,765
No, I think our little Annie's gonna take

1323
01:08:11,765 --> 01:08:13,432
this news just fine.

1324
01:08:18,205 --> 01:08:19,444
Here we go.

1325
01:08:19,444 --> 01:08:21,277
- Oh, thanks Mom.
- Mm.

1326
01:08:37,983 --> 01:08:42,233
- Don't worry, I'll still
fit in the wedding dress.

1327
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:44,340
- Um.

1328
01:08:45,325 --> 01:08:48,740
We need to talk about the dress.

1329
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:53,380
- Don't tell me they're
not gonna have it ready.

1330
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:56,297
- Richard didn't pay for the dress.

1331
01:08:57,862 --> 01:09:00,612
- Oh no. (sighs)

1332
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:04,259
Well, don't worry,

1333
01:09:06,505 --> 01:09:10,261
Nick and I'll figure
some way to pay it off.

1334
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:11,722
- Uh, no honey, you don't understand.

1335
01:09:11,722 --> 01:09:15,555
When he didn't pay for
the dress they sold it.

1336
01:09:17,885 --> 01:09:20,210
- They sold my dress?

1337
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,949
- He didn't pay for anything.

1338
01:09:22,949 --> 01:09:25,504
His checks all bounced.

1339
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:27,837
His credit card was no good.

1340
01:09:29,862 --> 01:09:32,945
- (sighs) I'm sorry.

1341
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:37,676
- It's okay.

1342
01:09:37,676 --> 01:09:39,970
- Yeah, we can still
pull this thing together.

1343
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:41,758
- Yeah, it may not be
exactly what you wanted

1344
01:09:41,758 --> 01:09:43,486
but it can still be terrific.

1345
01:09:43,486 --> 01:09:46,200
It'll take some work
but we've got 10 days.

1346
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,618
- [Margaret] I'll just
start making some calls.

1347
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:50,416
- I can't do this.

1348
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:55,209
- Oh, yes, it'll be a busy week
and a half but we can do it.

1349
01:09:55,209 --> 01:09:58,215
- I can't call all those people,

1350
01:09:58,215 --> 01:10:02,135
I can't, I can't look for another dress.

1351
01:10:02,135 --> 01:10:03,968
I just, I can't do it.

1352
01:10:05,303 --> 01:10:07,695
- [Nick] Ann, it's okay.

1353
01:10:07,695 --> 01:10:11,004
- No, I've been through this twice before,

1354
01:10:11,004 --> 01:10:14,666
I can't go into this marriage wrong.

1355
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:17,749
- Look Honey, what choice do we have?

1356
01:10:19,586 --> 01:10:21,169
- Nick, I love you.

1357
01:10:27,543 --> 01:10:30,793
But, I will not marry you feeling this,

1358
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:35,023
damn him.

1359
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,966
Damn him!

1360
01:10:38,966 --> 01:10:39,799
- Ann.

1361
01:10:42,994 --> 01:10:46,006
(John sighs)
(door thuds)

1362
01:10:46,006 --> 01:10:48,589
- She didn't take it well.
- No.

1363
01:10:53,788 --> 01:10:58,788
(birds chirping)
(engine puttering)

1364
01:11:05,787 --> 01:11:09,303
- (laughing) That was amazing!

1365
01:11:09,303 --> 01:11:10,440
Oh, I want one!

1366
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,135
That's it, I want one!

1367
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:13,457
- Yeah, you liked that,
I told you you would.

1368
01:11:13,457 --> 01:11:14,678
- Yes, Mom and John are gonna lose it,

1369
01:11:14,678 --> 01:11:17,827
but I don't care I have to have one.

1370
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:20,757
- I could get you a
basket case and fix it up.

1371
01:11:20,757 --> 01:11:21,652
- Really?

1372
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,497
- Yeah, I mean, you don't
need a hog as big as mine,

1373
01:11:23,497 --> 01:11:27,669
but I bet you we can get
you one for next to nothing.

1374
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:30,252
(gentle music)

1375
01:11:43,224 --> 01:11:46,601
- That was better than the motorcycle.

1376
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:48,934
(Ken sighs)

1377
01:11:49,863 --> 01:11:51,446
- I love you, Mary.

1378
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:57,745
- You want to go inside?

1379
01:12:00,935 --> 01:12:02,185
- Are you sure?

1380
01:12:05,168 --> 01:12:06,001
- Yeah.

1381
01:12:18,226 --> 01:12:20,882
(Mary laughing)

1382
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:23,793
- Just listen to what we have to say, hm?

1383
01:12:23,793 --> 01:12:25,312
- I tell you what, I
think I'm gonna listen

1384
01:12:25,312 --> 01:12:26,485
to what you have to say.

1385
01:12:26,485 --> 01:12:28,457
- That's all we ask.

1386
01:12:28,457 --> 01:12:29,457
Okay.
- Yeah?

1387
01:12:32,108 --> 01:12:34,858
(dramatic music)

1388
01:12:37,074 --> 01:12:39,741
- Nick, what are you doing here?

1389
01:12:43,656 --> 01:12:44,906
- I called him.

1390
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:47,771
- Oh.

1391
01:12:47,771 --> 01:12:49,423
- Now listen to me.

1392
01:12:49,423 --> 01:12:52,843
You walk away from Nick you're
letting your ex-husbands

1393
01:12:52,843 --> 01:12:56,093
and your father make a decision for ya.

1394
01:12:59,271 --> 01:13:01,146
- That's not it.

1395
01:13:01,146 --> 01:13:02,896
- Yeah, it is, Honey.

1396
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:07,719
You can't tell me you don't love Nick.

1397
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:14,116
The only retaliation you
have is your own happiness.

1398
01:13:14,116 --> 01:13:18,558
- Oh Honey, you don't
want to throw that away.

1399
01:13:18,558 --> 01:13:21,808
- (crying) I'm scared.

1400
01:13:25,947 --> 01:13:28,280
I'm scared of failing again.

1401
01:13:31,197 --> 01:13:33,959
- You've never failed me Ann.

1402
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:35,346
And I didn't put this ring on your finger

1403
01:13:35,346 --> 01:13:40,346
because I had any doubts
about coming through for you.

1404
01:13:40,523 --> 01:13:43,911
I don't care how or where we get married

1405
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:47,822
or who's there or what we're wearing.

1406
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:49,322
All I want is you.

1407
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:54,167
(Ann gasping)

1408
01:13:55,782 --> 01:13:58,261
- We only have seven days

1409
01:13:58,261 --> 01:14:01,761
if we're going to pull a wedding together.

1410
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,757
Of course, it's up to you.

1411
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:10,060
(gentle music)

1412
01:14:11,436 --> 01:14:14,019
(Ann laughing)

1413
01:14:18,813 --> 01:14:19,896
- I love you.

1414
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,540
- I love you.

1415
01:14:31,229 --> 01:14:32,952
- I think that's yes.

1416
01:14:32,952 --> 01:14:35,619
(John laughing)

1417
01:14:40,472 --> 01:14:43,972
- So what am I gonna wear to this wedding?

1418
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:01,648
- Yeah, I know there's a penalty,

1419
01:15:01,648 --> 01:15:06,065
just transfer the money to
my checking account today.

1420
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,593
Yes.

1421
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:14,328
I know it's my IRA but we need
the money for Ann's wedding.

1422
01:15:14,328 --> 01:15:16,041
Yeah, just cash it in

1423
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:18,481
and I'll pick up the money tomorrow, okay?

1424
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:19,314
Thanks.

1425
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:27,574
(staple gun clicking)

1426
01:15:27,574 --> 01:15:29,824
- This is the perfect bell.

1427
01:15:31,436 --> 01:15:34,666
- I'd say you're, uh, gifted.

1428
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:38,036
- They look great.
- Hm, thank you.

1429
01:15:38,036 --> 01:15:40,129
- Tell everyone we got
the table and chairs too.

1431
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:42,782
- Why don't you flip on a tape.

1432
01:15:42,782 --> 01:15:43,712
- [Dennis] All right.

1433
01:15:43,712 --> 01:15:46,462
- Denny, it's white, pink, white.

1434
01:15:47,845 --> 01:15:50,319
- White, pink, white's fine.
- No.

Ken?

- Who the hell are you?

1492
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:19,057

1493
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:21,626
- Oh, right.

1494
01:18:23,182 --> 01:18:24,015
Mary, mm.

1495
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:28,356
- [Mary] Who are you?

1496
01:18:28,356 --> 01:18:29,273
- Francine.

1497
01:18:33,657 --> 01:18:34,574
Ken's wife.

1498
01:18:37,192 --> 01:18:38,275
- Ken's wife?

1499
01:18:40,671 --> 01:18:44,838
- I'd show you the ring
but I hocked it years ago.

1500
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:49,076
- I don't believe this.

1501
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:53,101
- Look, uh, if Ken
didn't tell you about me,

1502
01:18:53,101 --> 01:18:54,684
then jump his case.

1503
01:18:56,233 --> 01:19:01,233
Now, if you don't mind, I was
right in the middle of a nap.

1504
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,833
(somber music)

1505
01:19:12,425 --> 01:19:16,632
- [Ann] Okay, and the flowers
will be here tomorrow morning.

1506
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:19,900
- We are almost finished outside.

1507
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,862
- Yeah, I just have to find
that stupid screwdriver.

1508
01:19:22,862 --> 01:19:26,533
- Who said you could see the
bride before the wedding?

1509
01:19:26,533 --> 01:19:28,338
- It's not our wedding day yet.

1510
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:30,505
- 22 hours and 36 minutes.

1511
01:19:31,972 --> 01:19:34,312
- Are you gonna do this
to me all day long?

1512
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:35,268
- Mm-hm.

1513
01:19:35,268 --> 01:19:36,922
- Get out the shotgun, Ma.

1514
01:19:36,922 --> 01:19:38,468
We may have to keep him here overnight,

1515
01:19:38,468 --> 01:19:40,381
make sure he don't run.

1516
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:41,449
(Mary giggles)

1517
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:44,868
- Hey, I've been through this
twice, nothing scares me.

1518
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:48,072
- Oh, don't let that veneer fool you.

1519
01:19:48,072 --> 01:19:49,582
She's nervous too.

1520
01:19:49,582 --> 01:19:50,851
I think it's in the bottom drawer.

1521
01:19:50,851 --> 01:19:53,191
- She's been over the
wedding list a hundred times.

1522
01:19:53,191 --> 01:19:55,441
- Oh something smells good.

1523
01:19:56,935 --> 01:19:57,768
Whew.

1524
01:19:59,221 --> 01:20:01,189
Chocolate cake.

1525
01:20:01,189 --> 01:20:02,439
- From scratch.

1526
01:20:04,376 --> 01:20:06,933
- [Nick] You made me a cake.

1527
01:20:06,933 --> 01:20:08,933
- I made a wedding cake.

1528
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:13,005
You wanted chocolate, you get chocolate.

1529
01:20:13,005 --> 01:20:15,033
- Oh wow, I guess this
marriage stuff might not be

1530
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:16,611
too bad after all.

1531
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,946
- Well, don't count on seeing
Betty Crocker too often.

1532
01:20:18,946 --> 01:20:21,946
She goes back in the box after this.

1533
01:20:22,843 --> 01:20:24,343
- I love you.
- Oh.

1534
01:20:26,911 --> 01:20:30,856
35 minutes.
(both laughing)

1535
01:20:30,856 --> 01:20:31,689
- Nick?

1536
01:20:34,233 --> 01:20:35,066
Let's go.

1537
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:39,152
- Bye.
(Ann laughing)

1538
01:20:40,276 --> 01:20:41,193
- Ah, well.

1539
01:20:42,343 --> 01:20:46,028
Well, I don't know how we did this but,

1540
01:20:46,028 --> 01:20:48,954
we got everything covered.

1541
01:20:48,954 --> 01:20:51,742
Except who you'll be dancing with.

1542
01:20:51,742 --> 01:20:52,894
- All right, enough Ann

1543
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:55,415
or you'll be walking down the
aisle with a limp tomorrow.

1544
01:20:55,415 --> 01:20:56,872
- You should return his calls.

1545
01:20:56,872 --> 01:20:58,701
- Ann, leave her alone.

1546
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:01,273
- [Mary] Mom, I can handle it.

1547
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,343
- Well you better be able to because hark,

1548
01:21:03,343 --> 01:21:07,176
(engine revving)
I hear a hog.

1549
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,103
- Did you call him!

1550
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,662
- You know, much as it killed me not to,

1551
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,329
I was just too busy.

1552
01:21:19,419 --> 01:21:22,004
Had a feeling this guy
would come on his own.

1553
01:21:22,004 --> 01:21:24,754
(engine revving)

1554
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:36,436
- Get out of here!

1555
01:21:36,436 --> 01:21:37,426
- No, not until you hear me out.

1556
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:38,534
- What were gonna do, Ken,

1557
01:21:38,534 --> 01:21:40,184
tell me it slipped your
mind you were married?

1558
01:21:40,184 --> 01:21:42,215
- Look, I haven't seen
Francine in over two years.

1559
01:21:42,215 --> 01:21:43,783
- That is no excuse, you lied to me.

1560
01:21:43,783 --> 01:21:45,450
- No, no, I did not.

1561
01:21:48,331 --> 01:21:50,371
(sighs) Look, I didn't tell
you about Francine at first

1562
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:53,621
because, because it just didn't matter.

1563
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,910
Then when I fell for you.

1564
01:22:00,299 --> 01:22:03,799
I got afraid that you would be scared off.

1565
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:07,457
- I'm not afraid of the truth, Ken.

1566
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:08,332
- Yeah, well you're not exactly

1567
01:22:08,332 --> 01:22:11,235
the same Mary I met three
months ago, you know.

1568
01:22:11,235 --> 01:22:15,710
I mean, don't get me
wrong, I liked that one.

1569
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,377
But I love this one.

1570
01:22:19,767 --> 01:22:21,924
I tracked Francine down
to sign divorce papers

1571
01:22:21,924 --> 01:22:23,140
because I would like to be free

1572
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,640
to follow what I feel for you.

1573
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:30,138
(gentle music)

1574
01:22:30,138 --> 01:22:31,305
- You mean it?

1575
01:22:34,869 --> 01:22:37,036
- Think you can handle me?

1576
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,490
- Think you can handle me?

1577
01:22:45,867 --> 01:22:47,117
- I don't know.

1578
01:22:50,221 --> 01:22:51,888
But I'd like to try.

1579
01:22:59,644 --> 01:23:00,477
- Yes!

1580
01:23:05,102 --> 01:23:07,685
(Ann laughing)

1581
01:23:19,298 --> 01:23:21,131
- I got you something.

1582
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:29,733
(Mary laughs)

1583
01:23:32,217 --> 01:23:33,217
- I love it.

1584
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:38,401
Do you love it?

1585
01:23:40,919 --> 01:23:42,623
Do you love it?

1586
01:23:42,623 --> 01:23:44,923
- Uh huh.
- Love it.

1587
01:23:44,923 --> 01:23:45,756
- Hop on.

1588
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:54,083
- Mary, you can't get on the
motorcycle in your dress!

1589
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:57,916
Oh!

1590
01:23:59,305 --> 01:24:02,888
(upbeat synthesizer music)

1591
01:24:13,293 --> 01:24:15,658
Now I've seen it all.

1592
01:24:15,658 --> 01:24:18,491
- (laughing) Mom.

1593
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:39,342
- [Margaret] Hey, hey, we did it.

1594
01:24:39,342 --> 01:24:42,284
You guys better go ahead
and start getting ready.

1595
01:24:42,284 --> 01:24:43,951
- They're beautiful.

1596
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,596
- [Margaret] Oh honey,
thank you for all your work.

1597
01:24:47,596 --> 01:24:48,739
- You'd do it for us, Mom.

1598
01:24:48,739 --> 01:24:50,338
- [Margaret] Yes, I would.

1599
01:24:50,338 --> 01:24:51,171
Andrew.

1600
01:24:52,048 --> 01:24:54,287
- I gotta go pick the
girls up at the airport.

1601
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:56,351
- [Margaret] All right,
be careful, drive careful.

1602
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:57,601
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

1603
01:25:03,269 --> 01:25:06,102
(Margaret laughs)

1604
01:25:08,775 --> 01:25:12,625
- John, I know that you
cashed in part of your savings

1605
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:15,084
to make this happen for Ann.

1606
01:25:15,084 --> 01:25:19,688
I think that was a very sweet
sacrifice for her and for me.

1607
01:25:19,688 --> 01:25:21,271
- For us, Margaret.

1608
01:25:22,259 --> 01:25:23,092
- For us.

1609
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:27,448
(gentle music)

1610
01:25:27,448 --> 01:25:29,143
You know, we got married right here.

1611
01:25:29,143 --> 01:25:31,947
- (laughs) Yeah.

1612
01:25:31,947 --> 01:25:34,166
That was quite a week too.

1613
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:36,195
But we got through it.

1614
01:25:36,195 --> 01:25:41,028
- I've never been happier about
anything in my whole life.

1615
01:25:43,792 --> 01:25:47,292
I, Margaret, take you John for my husband.

1616
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:51,912
- To have and to hold.

1617
01:25:52,839 --> 01:25:55,547
- [Margaret] For richer for poorer.

1618
01:25:55,547 --> 01:25:57,547
- For better, for worse.

1619
01:25:59,146 --> 01:26:01,479
- In sickness and in health.

1620
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:04,927
- For all time to come.

1621
01:26:10,178 --> 01:26:12,261
- You may kiss the bride.

1622
01:26:21,069 --> 01:26:22,581
Oh, I love you Mr. Hicks.

1623
01:26:22,581 --> 01:26:27,081
- (laughs) Oh, I love you Mrs. Hicks.

1624
01:26:28,005 --> 01:26:31,088
(Margaret laughing)

1625
01:26:32,074 --> 01:26:37,074
(bright harp music)
(people chattering)

1626
01:26:42,289 --> 01:26:43,956
- Okay Nick?
- Mm-hm.

1627
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:47,959
- Whew, hey, how are you.

1628
01:26:47,959 --> 01:26:50,267
Oh, so good to see you, you look great.

1629
01:26:50,267 --> 01:26:52,555
Hey, Mom is around the back,
why don't you go say hi,

1630
01:26:52,555 --> 01:26:54,805
I'll be back there shortly.

1631
01:26:56,266 --> 01:26:58,260
- Andrew and the girls
haven't arrived yet.

1632
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:01,556
- Yeah, well, um, I'll
keep an eye out for 'em.

1633
01:27:01,556 --> 01:27:03,056
- Yeah okay.
- Mom.

1634
01:27:07,377 --> 01:27:08,879
- You know, next to my own kids,

1635
01:27:08,879 --> 01:27:13,879
there's nobody I'd rather
have call me that. (laughs)

1636
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:15,914
I'll see how Annie's doing in.

1637
01:27:15,914 --> 01:27:16,747
- Say hi.

1638
01:27:18,681 --> 01:27:20,012
Oh hey, how you doing?

1639
01:27:20,012 --> 01:27:20,895
Good to see you.

1640
01:27:20,895 --> 01:27:22,795
Nice to see you again.

1641
01:27:22,795 --> 01:27:23,795
Gifts, good.

1642
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:26,520
- You're shaking.

1643
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,797
- Well, yeah, I need lipstick.

1644
01:27:28,797 --> 01:27:30,072
- You have to relax!

1645
01:27:30,072 --> 01:27:31,784
You're never gonna live through this.

1646
01:27:31,784 --> 01:27:33,475
- Yeah, well.

1647
01:27:33,475 --> 01:27:34,491
- How are things in here.

1648
01:27:34,491 --> 01:27:35,902
- We're ready.

1649
01:27:35,902 --> 01:27:37,070
- Oh!
- What?

1650
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:38,548
- What?

1651
01:27:38,548 --> 01:27:39,837
- Oh God.
- What is it.

1652
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:41,080
- Oh gosh!
- Ann?

1653
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,459
- Where are you going?
- Cold feet.

1654
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:45,209
- [Margaret] Oh, Ann!

1655
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:52,769
- Thanks for coming here
on such short notice.

1656
01:27:52,769 --> 01:27:53,937
Be sure and sign the book.

1657
01:27:53,937 --> 01:27:54,770
- John!

1658
01:27:58,962 --> 01:28:00,335
- [John] What are you doing?

1659
01:28:00,335 --> 01:28:01,645
- I forgot the most important thing.

1660
01:28:01,645 --> 01:28:05,062
I need someone to walk me down the aisle.

1661
01:28:06,616 --> 01:28:08,199
Would you honor me?

1662
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:14,407
- If I had a daughter, I'd
want her to be just like you.

1663
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:20,099
- Well, you do have a
daughter, two of them.

1664
01:28:20,099 --> 01:28:21,429
And three sons.

1665
01:28:21,429 --> 01:28:23,305
You're stuck with us.

1666
01:28:23,305 --> 01:28:24,563
(John laughing)

1667
01:28:24,563 --> 01:28:27,480
- You're gonna make my mascara run.

1668
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,458
- Grandma, Grandpa, we made it!

1669
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:33,236
- Jersey, Amy, we were
nervous, where have you been?

1670
01:28:33,236 --> 01:28:35,608
- The flight was delayed.
- Oh.

1671
01:28:35,608 --> 01:28:37,524
- [Margaret] Well your
dresses are upstairs,

1672
01:28:37,524 --> 01:28:38,844
I hope they fit.

1673
01:28:38,844 --> 01:28:39,720
- Oh, you know what,

1674
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,958
we're gonna have to curl
your hair and fix it Jersey.

1675
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:43,734
- Can we see Robert and Maggie first?

1676
01:28:43,734 --> 01:28:46,378
- I want to see Officer
Nick in his new tuxedo.

1677
01:28:46,378 --> 01:28:47,974
I bet he looks awesome.

1678
01:28:47,974 --> 01:28:48,865
(Ann laughing)

1679
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:51,681
- Get upstairs, get upstairs,

1680
01:28:51,681 --> 01:28:53,264
- Come on!
- Go on.

01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:59,421
(gentle harp music)

1682
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:08,190

(people laughing)

1687
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:26,404

(people chattering)

1689
01:29:44,255 --> 01:29:46,002
- Hey, look at that, there's Mary.

1690
01:29:46,002 --> 01:29:47,085
There's Mary.

1691
01:29:55,795 --> 01:29:57,780
(bright organ music)

1692
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:59,530
- Here she is, quiet.

("Bridal March")

1694
01:30:39,678 --> 01:30:42,511
- This is a blessed beautiful day.

1695
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:46,040
Perfect for a wedding--

1696
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,389
- Could we just skip to the questions

1697
01:30:49,389 --> 01:30:50,990
because if I faint I want to know I got

1698
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:52,907
to the important stuff.

1699
01:30:54,311 --> 01:30:56,126
- All right.

1700
01:30:56,126 --> 01:30:57,459
Face each other.

1701
01:30:58,373 --> 01:31:01,623

1702
01:31:18,535 --> 01:31:22,312
(people chattering)

1703
01:31:22,312 --> 01:31:23,246
- I can't see what you're--

1704
01:31:23,246 --> 01:31:24,965
- Get in a little tighter there.

1705
01:31:24,965 --> 01:31:25,798
Yep, that looks good.

1706
01:31:25,798 --> 01:31:27,206
Okay, ready?

1707
01:31:27,206 --> 01:31:30,281
And, there we go.

1708
01:31:30,281 --> 01:31:32,355
all right, now let's have a little kiss.

1709

Right there. (laughing)

Just fit right in, that's

Okay, all right, everybody ready here?

- We're gonna have to rent
chairs for the dining room table.

1726
01:32:11,184 --> 01:32:13,108
Holidays are gonna be something.

1727
01:32:13,108 --> 01:32:15,858
- And ready?
- Look right there.

1728
01:32:15,858 --> 01:32:19,032
