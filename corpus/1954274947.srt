a good cop?

177
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:29,768
Oh yes. But we're not done yet.

178
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:33,283
Hi, buddy. I'm your friendly
neighberhood police officer.

179
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:35,499
Would you like a glass of water?
Yeah, yeah actually.

180
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,541
Too bad. Security Cameras
picked up this.

181
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,113
You were found
at the construction site.

182
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,231
Convulsing with a strange piece.
That's disgusting.

183
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:46,052
Then why is it permenantly 
stuck to your back?

184
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:48,432
What?

185
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:51,636
Take it back, get off me.
Oh come on it's chasing me!

186
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:55,180
Look, It's not my fault. I have no
idea how this thing got on my back.

187
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,692
Of course, buddy, I believe you.
Great!

188
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:59,788
I believe you too.

189
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,438
You see the quotations I'm making
with my claw hands?

190
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,737
It means I don't believe you.

191
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:07,014
Why else would you show up
with that thing on your back.

192
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:09,972
Just three days before President.
Business is going to use the Kragle.

193
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:13,497
To end the world?
President Business is gonna end the world?

194
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:14,929
But he's such a good guy.

195
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,266
And Octam. They make good stuff.

196
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:20,170
<i>Music, dairy products,
coffee, TV shows,</i>

197
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:23,665
<i>Surveillance systems,
All history books, voting machines...</i>

198
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:27,040
Wait a minute.
Come on, you can't be this stupid.

199
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,790
Come on..
This is a misunderstanding.

200
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,804
I'm just a regular
normal, ordinary guy

201
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:33,295
and I'm late to meet
My Best Friends in the whole world

202
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:35,984
and they're probably missing me right now.
They are probably out looking around.

203
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,494
"Hey Where's Emmet?"
"Where's my Best friend Emmet?".

204
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:41,265
You know what? Ask all my friends.
They will tell you.

205
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,608
Oh. We asked them alright. BOOM.

206
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,904
That guy
He's not a criminal mastermind.

207
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:49,125
<i>See? He is always kind of a...</i>

208
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,598
<i>Average.. Normal kind of guy.
Thank you.</i>

209
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:55,814
<i>But he's not like normal like us...</i>

210
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,510
<i>He's not that special.</i>

211
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,975
<i>I'm so confused...
Who are we talking about?</i>

212
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:07,068
<i>Wait, does he work with us?
Gail does not remember me?</i>

213
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,518
<i>Look at Randy here.</i>

214
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,975
<i>He likes sausage, that's something.</i>

215
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,983
<i>Gail is perky, that's something.</i>

216
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:18,869
<i>And Harry well... - When you say Harry,
I go ...Ha..Haa .ha. a ha ha haaa.</i>

217
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,746
And when you say <i>
the other guy, I go...</i>

218
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,795
<i>I know that guy,
But I know like zippy-zap about him.</i>

219
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,254
We just talked earlier.

220
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:35,711
And all I am mean he does is say yes
to everything everybody else is doing.

221
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,976
He's just sort of a..

222
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:39,292
And a little bit of a...

223
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:41,211
Blank slate I guess.

224
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,384
<i>That will be $ 42, please.</i>

225
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:47,478
We all have something that makes
us something, and Emmet is...

226
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,572
Nothing.

227
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:54,727
There you go.

228
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:57,067
I told you I said I was nobody.

229
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:01,969
It's the perfect cover.
Cover? Cover for what?

230
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,461
I can't break him. Take him to the
melting chamber.

231
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:06,629
What? No!

232
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,145
No!!!

233
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,951
No!!!

234
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:12,408
You're going to melt me?
Am I gonna die?

235
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:15,028
You'll live You'll be fine.

236
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,520
President Business,
I have him right here, sir.

237
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:20,830
Yes. We have told him he'll live
so he doesn't try to escape.

238
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:23,268
But, eh.. we're lying to him.

239
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,850
Wait, what did he just say?

240
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:26,903
Hold still.

241
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:30,278
Wait! There's obviously been a mixup here.
You got the wrong...

242
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,079
That is going to start hurting
pretty soon.

243
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:05,867
No, no, no no. Ohh who.

244
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:07,579
Ohh, whoahh.

245
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:08,943
Who are you?

246
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,894
It's you?
Come with me if you wanna not die.

247
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,312
Hi, everybody!

248
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,832
How's the melting...
Hey, hey, hey hey!

249
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,151
Red Alert! Red Alert!
I need everyone.

250
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:28,638
Repeat, everyone to go after
the special.

251
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:32,640
The tunnel's that way.

252
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:35,960
Oh boy.

253
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,772
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.

254
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:40,022
We'll build a motorcycle
out of the alleyway.

255
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,570
GEAR

256
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,813
So, Ah.. Didn't catch your name.

257
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:57,380
Or anything about..
What you're up to,

258
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:58,686
or what we're doing here.

259
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:01,923
It's brilliant sir that you've had it being
a useless nobody,

260
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:04,054
But, you can drop the act,
with me, It's cool.

261
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:05,358
Oh, the act?

262
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:12,777
Jump on. Let's go.

263
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:19,509
Hang on, sir.

264
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,498
All units,
Cut 'em off on neon, now!

265
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:23,802
Or whatever you can.

266
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:25,620
10-4, bad cop!

267
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,340
- Watch out!
- Hold on.

268
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:33,090
We need to meet-up with Vitruvius
tell him the piece has been found.

269
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,954
Ah-ha.
They're up on the motor rail.

270
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:37,034
Release the Copper-chopper.

271
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,417
Oh no!

272
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:50,795
Can you please tell me
what is happening?

273
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,473
I'm rescuing you, sir.
You're the one the prophecy spoke of.

274
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,668
- You're the Special.
- Me?

275
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,420
You've found
The piece of resistance.

276
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,275
And the prophecy states.

277
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:04,964
That you're the most important,
The most talented, interesting

278
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,758
and the most extraordinary
in the universe.

279
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:11,677
That's you, right?

280
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:15,659
Yes, that's me.

281
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,673
Great. You drive. What?

282
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,882
I wanna go home.

283
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,576
This is not what I meant.

284
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:42,141
Oh no! Look out, Special.

285
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:44,711
Sorry!
Never driven a motorcycle, sorry.

286
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,801
Wow, that's amazing.

287
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:59,061
That was incredible. Your even better
then the prophecy said you'd be.

288
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,528
Really?
I'm Ahh.. I'm Wild-Style.

289
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,470
Oh, I'm sorry what was it?
Wild-Style.

290
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:05,774
- Wild-Style?
- Yep.

291
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,162
- What are you a DJ?
- No.

292
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:09,242
Oh then that's your name, It's Wild-Style?
Yeah.

293
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:12,204
Like on your birth certificate it's
says Wild-Style? Let's not talk about my name.

294
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:15,131
Don't let the Special get away.
We block the freeway.

295
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:16,486
Hang on, sir.

296
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,352
What are you doing?

297
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:21,629
Let's fly.

298
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:25,022
Head for the secret tunnel.

299
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,632
These are the city limits.
Let's just head for the tunnel.

300
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,916
You want me to drive to that
wierd swirly hole?

301
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,415
- Are you insane?
- Don't break, go! Don't stop, go. Now!

302
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:37,265
Can't do this.
That is against the instructions.

303
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:40,771
Wait. What's your favorite restaurant?
Any chian restaurant.

304
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:42,570
Favorite TV Show?
Where are my pants.

305
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:44,675
Favorite song?
Everything is awesome.

306
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:45,979
Oh no.

307
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:56,869
Darn, darn, darn! Darny darn!

308
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,210
Wait. Where are we?

309
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,399
THE OLD WEST

310
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,515
This is so weird...

311
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,053
You're not the special.
You lied to me!

312
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:49,146
- Well I mean.. It depends..It realy kinda..
- Your'e not even a Master Builder, are you?

313
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:50,994
Well, I know what a Master Builder is.

314
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:54,206
Why don't you tell me what it is
that way I can see if you're right?

315
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,149
You ruined the prophecy.

316
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,972
Look, I'm Sorry, Ok?
You just that...

317
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,595
Made being a Special
sound so good.

318
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:05,817
And to think I was going to follow you
to the end of the universe.

319
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:07,587
You were?

320
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:11,887
Well here is the thing, how do we
know for sure that I'm not the special?

321
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,762
We just don't know it yet...
Quiet.

322
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:15,671
Yo warn you want a giant turkey leg?

323
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:17,675
You have any idea
what it does to your..

324
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,075
Oh My G-o-s-h!

325
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:23,378
Just put the hat on.

326
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,566
Oh, and this, and this
and this, and this.

327
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,548
And by the way,
I have a boyfriend.

328
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:32,058
Ahhh.. not sure exactly
why you'd bring that up.

329
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,732
It's super serious
and you do not want to mess with him.

330
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,119
- Ok.
- So. Don't get any ideas.

331
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,158
I never have any ideas. Wait!

332
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,230
Take 'em up you felles
hands where I can see them.

333
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:45,923
Hey, listen do'ye think you can explain
to me like why am I dressed like this,

334
00:19:45,924 --> 00:19:50,495
with this big words in the sky were all
about and like where we are, in time?

335
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:55,440
Your home, Bricksberg
is one of many realms in the universe.

336
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,402
There is also this one, the Pirates club,
Knights club, vikings land,

337
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:01,482
and the clown town, and bunch others
that we don't need to mention.

338
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:05,111
Lord Business, or as you think you know
him, President Business,

339
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:08,439
Stole the Kragle,
the most powerful object in the universe.

340
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,743
Blah, blah, blah...

341
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:13,336
Proper name, Place name
and stuff...

342
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:15,601
It's the Special.

343
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:18,099
I am so pretty I like you

344
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,326
but I'm angry with you
for some reason.

345
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:25,848
Putting the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle and disarm it forever.

346
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,309
Great.

347
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,999
I think I got it,
but just in case...

348
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,577
tell me the all thing again.
I wasn't listening.

349
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:35,862
<i>OK. All of the people in the universe</i>

350
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:40,201
<i>were once free to travel,
and mingle and build whatever they wanted.</i>

351
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:43,263
<i>But President Business
was confused by all the chaos.</i>

352
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:45,680
<i>So he erected walls between
the worlds.</i>

353
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:48,321
<i>And came obcessed
with order and perfection.</i>

354
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:51,461
<i>And he stole a mysterious
secret-super weapon called.</i>

355
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:53,954
<i>The Kragle!
And he hired Bad Cop to hunt down</i>

356
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:57,313
<i>all the master builders
Who were always changing everything.</i>

357
00:20:57,314 --> 00:21:00,177
<i>Those of us who remained
well we went to hiding</i>

358
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:02,296
<i>built a tunnel to survive.</i>

359
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:04,367
And we searched for the
Piece of the resistance.

360
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:07,423
The only thing that can
stop the Kragle.

361
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:09,057
Kragle. I know that.

362
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:11,500
That might have been that cop
He said something about the Kragle.

363
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,531
The President Business was going
to use the Kragle to end the world

364
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:16,448
in three days.
I can't make any sense of it.

365
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:17,751
The Taco Tuesday.

366
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:20,183
I knew that was suspicous.
There is no time to lose.

367
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:23,433
We must find Vitruvius and get to the
Office Tower before it's too late.

368
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:26,911
Ok. How scary can
someones' office be?

369
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:35,268
THE PRESIDENT BUSINESS OFFICE

370
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,667
President Business, we're
trying to locate the fugitive

371
00:21:38,668 --> 00:21:41,987
but his face is so generic, it matches
any other face in owr database.

372
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:44,596
Diabolical. Ok.

373
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:48,917
Have Bad cop meet me in my office
in 23 seconds. Ciao!

374
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:50,832
Coffee sales are through
the roof, sir.

375
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,745
Great to hear it. Let's rebuild
that roof to be even higher.

376
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,048
The Roof Team is on it!

377
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,230
Sir, can you approve this Poster
for Taco Tuesday?

378
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,706
Perfect!
WOO!! I love everyone in this room.

379
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:01,381
- We love you, sir.
- Hey, guys.

380
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:03,099
Great job on the radio seg.!
Thank you, sir.

381
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,615
We love listening to
this song over and over again.

382
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:10,163
Keep it up, guys.
Honey, Where are my pants?

383
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:14,350
Hilarious. That never gets old.
It does not.

384
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:17,030
Bad Cop is waiting
for you, in your office.

385
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:20,484
Wonderful, fantastic.
Would you cancel my 2 o'clock?

386
00:22:20,485 --> 00:22:24,076
This meeting can run
a little bit deadly.

387
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,327
<i>Activating Helmet.</i>

388
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,629
<i>Light sequence.</i>

389
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,651
<i>Flames attached.
Engage dramatic entrance.</i>

390
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,719
- Bad-Cop.
- Lord Business,

391
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,413
I know the Special got away,
but...

392
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:46,821
Don't be so serious.
Where's the other guy?

393
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:49,835
Hey. Hey, buddy. I missed you.

394
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,138
Oh.. Did you really?

395
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,000
Have I ever shown you my relic collection?
Nope.

396
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,939
I don't think you have.
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.

397
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,924
This one is the cloak of Ban-da-id.

398
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:01,172
I heard it's super painful
to take off. Do you want to try it on?

399
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:03,670
Well, I... No, but thank you.

400
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:06,590
We got some great work over the years
together bad-cop.

401
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:08,747
Capturing all those
Master Builders

402
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:10,687
and torturing them,
and what not.

403
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:12,909
- Thank you, sir.
- Although,

404
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,674
You did let the Piece of Resistance go.

405
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:16,416
The one thing the could ruin my plans.

406
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,815
The one thing I asked you to take care of.

407
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:20,983
That's super frustrating.

408
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:25,482
It makes me want to pick up whoever
is standing closest to me

409
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:31,487
and just throw him through this window and
out into the infinite abyss of nothingness.

410
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,740
But I want to do it so bad.

411
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:39,269
I know you do, sir.
But Please, please don't.

412
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,747
And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.

413
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:46,704
People everywhere are
always messing with my stuff.

414
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:49,131
But I have a way to fix that.

415
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:55,345
 A way to keep things exactly the way
they are supposed to be. Permanently.

416
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,182
Behold!

417
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:01,525
The most powerful weapon
of all the realms.

418
00:24:02,312 --> 00:24:04,793
The Kragle!

419
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,296
As you can see, they're loading
the Kragle on a big machine upstairs.

420
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:16,675
I call it the Tentacle
Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.

421
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:18,827
Or TAKOS. The "S" is silent.

422
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:24,484
So on Taco Tuesday, it will spread the
Kragle over everyone and everything

423
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:27,729
with the bunch of super
scary nozzle, like this one.

424
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,039
I'll show you how it works.
Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

425
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,484
Oh, Don't worry.
I won't test it on you.

426
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:35,593
I'll do it on your parents.

427
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:38,014
- What?
- Hiya, son.

428
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:40,897
Hi.
How is it going in the big city?

429
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,408
Mommy, Daddy.
What are you doing here?

430
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:45,996
Ok, pa.
I just want to you to act naturally.

431
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:48,302
- Like you were going 'bout your day.
- Got you.

432
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:50,005
Keep your hand up like that.

433
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:54,274
Ma, scoop two steps into the right.
Pa, why do...

434
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,222
Whenever I talk to Ma,
you start to move.

435
00:24:56,223 --> 00:24:58,350
I'm sorry, sir.
Get back to where you were.

436
00:24:58,351 --> 00:25:00,177
- Here?
- Perfect. That's great.

437
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:01,813
,You can't do anything better
There's no reason why you should move.

438
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:03,117
Right. Now, Ma,

439
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,997
hand on his shoulder,
and you... Pa, you're just moving.

440
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:08,309
And you just wrecked it!
You wrecked it!

441
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,619
Bad cop, you see what I'm talking about.

442
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,430
All I'm asking for is
Total perfection.

443
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,504
Send in the Micromanager.

444
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:21,128
What are you doing?
My god, what is this?

445
00:25:23,552 --> 00:25:24,946
Hold still you guys.

446
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:31,178
Then, I'll just spray them with TACO.

447
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,740
- Oh pa, hold me.
- Oh darling.

448
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:37,820
Can't move me legs.

449
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:42,578
Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
Surely, you feel bad for your parents.

450
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:45,441
And you want to help them, Don't you?
We're Ok, son.

451
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:47,387
Just a little stuck, that's all.

452
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,256
Go ahead,

453
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:52,957
finish the job.

454
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,772
Of course, sir. No, I don't want to.

455
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,537
You have to. I don't want to.

456
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:58,841
Would you -Please be quiet.
I can't.

457
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:00,144
You must. But they...

458
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:01,447
Shut it! It's not nice...

459
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:04,944
It's your job, man!
I can't do it, they're innocent.

460
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:06,248
Just as I thought.

461
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:09,184
Your Good Cop side is
making you soft, Bad Cop.

462
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:14,890
Robots, bring me the Police crest inceptor and
the q-tip and the Police Remover of na-eel!

463
00:26:14,891 --> 00:26:17,242
You Already left the Special
get away once.

464
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,235
- Sir.
- We're just gonna make sure it doesn't happen again.

465
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:23,471
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

466
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:30,455
- Oh, son!
- On Taco Tuesday,

467
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:36,443
I'm going to Kragalize the entire universe, so
that everyone will stop messing with my stuff.

468
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:38,209
Or you're gonna be with me.

469
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,915
Or you gonna be stuck having a tea
party with your mom and dad?

470
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:46,385
Son. Sorry, Dad.

471
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:49,513
I have a job to do.

472
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:09,595
All you have to do
is blend in and act like you belong here.

473
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:13,090
Perfect. Hi there, I'm a cowboy.

474
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:15,214
Bang bang, b, b bang bang.

475
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:19,216
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Bullet Bullet, gun.

476
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,326
- What are they looking at?
- I made a mistake.

477
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:23,158
You should be just still,
Act like a stool.

478
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,183
- Howdy, guys?
- Wait, No, stool don't talk.

479
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:27,599
- Don't sit on me.
- Stool don't talk, hush.

480
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:29,629
Let me show you how it's done.

481
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:37,091
What a lady

482
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:42,000
Ok. We'll just find the wizard
and get this over with.

483
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,255
Psst, there he is.

484
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:53,489
Vitruvius.
Who? I've never heard of that man.

485
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,540
Who I am not. Who are you?
It's me.

486
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,479
I am a blind man and cannot see.

487
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,003
- It's Wild-Style.
- Are you a DJ?

488
00:28:02,004 --> 00:28:04,083
Why does everybody? Wait, wait.

489
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:07,371
Were you the student I used to have who
was so insecure who kept changing his name?

490
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:09,355
No, no. Yeah, first Dark Storm,

491
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,451
Then Jemminy, then Wild-Style then...
No, no.

492
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:13,307
Smazzy Pants. Okay, yes.

493
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:16,128
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.

494
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:21,077
"10" SECONDS LATER

495
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,980
Wow! Man...

496
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:29,459
You have a very wierdly
decorated place.

497
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,298
- Thank you.
- Vitruvius.

498
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,551
- We have found the Piece of Resistance.
- Is it true?

499
00:28:34,552 --> 00:28:37,977
Yeah, but...
Wild-Style, the prophecy states that.

500
00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:42,336
You are the Special.
Embodiment of good, foiler of evil,

501
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:44,611
the most talented,
the most briliant,

502
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:47,148
The most important person
in the universe.

503
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:53,092
That would be great but...
Emmet is the one who found the piece.

504
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:57,753
Okay, Emmet! The prophecy says
you are states that you are the Special.

505
00:28:57,754 --> 00:29:00,215
The most talented...
I'm not sure he's the Special, actually

506
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,585
because he's not
even a Master Builder.

507
00:29:02,586 --> 00:29:05,190
Watch. Emmet, just give a watch around,
you and build something simple.

508
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:07,331
Great. Like an awesome race car.

509
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:08,635
Do you have the instructions?
No.

510
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:12,321
You must create the instructions
in your mind, my leige.

511
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,648
Oh, Ok. Racecar.

512
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:18,165
Well, There's a lot of really cool stuff
here.

513
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:23,074
Don't see.. a wheel or...

514
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,015
three more wheels.

515
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:32,362
See? He can't do it.
He will never be a master builder.

516
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:34,854
Of course not. Not if you keep
telling him he can't.

517
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,668
He need to see that he can.

518
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:38,779
What are you doing?
We are entering your mind.

519
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,834
What are you doing?
We are entering your mind.

520
00:29:40,835 --> 00:29:43,795
To prove to you have the unlocked potential
of a good to be Master Builder.

521
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:53,195
Wow. Are we inside
my brain right now?

522
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:55,407
It's big. I must be smart.

523
00:29:56,107 --> 00:29:58,726
I'm not hear a lot of
activity here.

524
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:01,469
I don't think he ever had
an original thought in his life.

525
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,829
Haha. That's not true.
For instance,

526
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,266
once time I want to have a
bunch of my friends to watch TV.

527
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:10,866
Not unlike this TV
that just showed up magically.

528
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:13,159
And not everybody
can fit in on my one couch.

529
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,462
And I thought to myself:

530
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:17,683
Well, what if there's such a thing
as a bunk-bed, but as a couch.

531
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:20,179
Introducing, the double-decker couch.

532
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,105
So everybody would watches TV
together, and be buddies.

533
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:26,020
That is literaly the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

534
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:28,425
Please Wild-Style,
let me handle this.

535
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,784
That idea was just the worst.

536
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:35,540
There must be something around here
that proves his potential.

537
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:38,037
If the man upstairs chose
him to be the Special,

538
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,482
There must be a reason.
Who is the man upstairs?

539
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:42,828
See? He does't even know
about the man upstairs.

540
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:46,513
He has like super gross hands* that
looke like they're made out of sausages

541
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:49,425
like Eagle talons mixed with squid.

542
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,329
You are seeing that...

543
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:55,240
Whoahh that's what I was just
thinking about.

544
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:57,101
- How did you...
- I had this weird dream that I touch the piece

545
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:59,565
but I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.

546
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,911
Emmet, you had a vision.

547
00:31:01,912 --> 00:31:03,709
I did?... Master Builders

548
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,614
spend years training themselves
to clear their minds enough

549
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:10,017
to have even a fleeting glimpse of
the Man upstairs. And yet..

550
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:13,966
Your mind is already so prodigiously empty

551
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:17,387
that, there is nothing in it to clear away
in the first place.

552
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:20,048
With proper training,
you could become.

553
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:22,356
- A great Master-builder.
- I could?

554
00:31:22,357 --> 00:31:24,571
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

555
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:28,795
I can't do any of the stuff, that the
prophecy says I'm supposed to do.

556
00:31:28,796 --> 00:31:31,363
All you have to do

557
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:32,434
is to believe.

558
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:36,887
Then you will see everything.

559
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:39,022
Are you ready, my son?

560
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:43,739
Yes, I am.

561
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:46,001
I think.

562
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:47,962
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

563
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:52,061
We must assemble... The
Master Builders.

564
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:54,651
Do you think Zepellins
are a bad investment?

565
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:09,584
Any of you Fella's seen this guy?

566
00:32:11,285 --> 00:32:14,976
Wait a minute, partner.
Draw a cowboy hat on him.

567
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:18,129
WANTED

568
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:23,715
These mechanical birds
will get our message out.

569
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:26,103
They will go to an Internet cafe
and e-mail

570
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:28,595
the remaining Master Builders,
who will utilise this in the secret realm

571
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:30,499
of cloud cuckoo land.

572
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,559
Cuckoo land? But what happened
to that whole training part.

573
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,015
Don't worry, Emmet.
Your training begins now.

574
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:42,213
- You in there open up.
- Your training begins later.

575
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,068
On three. 1...

576
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:55,978
- I think we're in the clear.
- Freeze, Turkeys

577
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,641
All I want is a piece of resistance.

578
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:01,103
We You would rather 'he die'
than give it to you.

579
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,520
I would not rather... He died...

580
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:06,973
Look everybody we can do this
the easy way or we can do it...

581
00:33:06,974 --> 00:33:08,723
Go! Run!! Do it the hard way.

582
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:10,025
Fire! Fire!

583
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:13,702
Vitruvius, which way
to cloud cuckoo land.

584
00:33:13,703 --> 00:33:15,756
Head for the big bright thing
in the sky.

585
00:33:15,757 --> 00:33:17,419
You mean the sun? Yeah, yeah,
thats it

586
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,607
lets get out of here. Use this.

587
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:21,677
What are you doing? Lets go!

588
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:25,067
I don't know what I'm doing.

589
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:29,958
Goodbye!

590
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,662
Oh dang!

591
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,673
I've got Pigs!

592
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:46,701
I hate pigs! Guys quit playing 
around the mud I could use your help

593
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:49,538
Wild-Style,
I could really use your help.

594
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,408
Oink!

595
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:12,286
Vitruvius, they're gaining on us.
Build something.

596
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:14,631
- Let the Emmet try.
- No, let not let Emmet try.

597
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,507
- I haven't had any training.
- Thats OK.

598
00:34:16,508 --> 00:34:19,097
Let's start with how to become
A Master Builder.

599
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,708
Step 1: Trust your instincts.

600
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:23,565
Okay. Build-something!

601
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:25,736
Build something!

602
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Take that

603
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:33,120
Harness your instincts
are terrible.

604
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,514
No The wheel.

605
00:34:45,044 --> 00:34:48,042
I can't control it much longer.

606
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:51,123
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

607
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:53,806
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

608
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:56,495
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

609
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,791
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

610
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:03,205
Spins around round round round
Ohhh

611
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:06,661
Emmet, where you going?

612
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:12,387
Ohh this better work.
Hang tight!

613
00:35:13,252 --> 00:35:14,843
Dang damn it.

614
00:35:17,717 --> 00:35:19,308
Well done Emmet!

615
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:23,458
Hey Haaaay -I did it!
Wow you actually did it!

616
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,034
Train!

617
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:35,508
Oh no!

618
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,056
- Get out off my train.
- Run!

619
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:44,997
Wild-Style.

620
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:50,254
He's gonna ram us.

621
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,699
Quick quick, I have an idea,
Give me that piece.

622
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:55,671
Now, the ramp.

623
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:05,168
- What the heck?
- Rest in pieces.

624
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,763
Ohh No!
Wait! Wait! No no

625
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:20,753
Hey thanks for saving my life
back there.

626
00:36:20,754 --> 00:36:25,624
Even if, you know eventually 
you turn out to be pointless.

627
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,465
Well for what its worth it.

628
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:32,295
This has been about the greatest 
15 minutes of my life.

629
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:39,778
What ...The.

630
00:36:42,753 --> 00:36:45,351
- Relax everybody, I'm here.
- Batman!

631
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:46,678
- Whats up, babe?
- Babe!

632
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,910
What?
Oh sorry. Batman This is Emmett.

633
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:51,309
Emmet,
this is my boyfriend, Batman.

634
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,775
I'm Batman.

635
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:54,079
That's your boyfriend?

636
00:36:57,712 --> 00:37:00,900
- Batman? Huh Where'd you guys meet?
- Its actually a funny story.

637
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:02,203
Right Bat?

638
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:03,507
There he is.

639
00:37:03,508 --> 00:37:04,872
Police to meet you, Bad Cop.

640
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:07,195
The pleasure was all mine.

641
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,991
You big dumb baby

642
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:13,100
Your car is a baby chariot

643
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:15,781
Ohh no Your boyfriends gone.

644
00:37:15,782 --> 00:37:18,472

645
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:23,140
Sooo ahh hey Guys...

646
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:26,766
I think we're gonna crash into the sun.
Yeh but its gonna look really cool.

647
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:35,891
Ahh is this cloud cuckoo land?
I don't see any clouds.

648
00:37:35,892 --> 00:37:38,936
Or cuckoos.
No, No, this is middle Zealand.

649
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:40,239
A Wondrousl land.

650
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,729
Full of knights,
castles, mutton, torture weapons,

651
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,632
poverty, leeches,
Illiteracy and...

652
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:48,508
Dragon!

653
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:50,023
Yep, That too.

654
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:54,904
Once we arrive at cloud cuckoo land.

655
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,676
We'll raise an army of
Master Builders...

656
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:59,988
Anyway, you guys got to check out 
this new subwoofers I installed in the back

657
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:02,323
I call it the Dog.
Just listen to them bark.

658
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:06,555
Can you turn that down a bit?
This is a song I wrote

659
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:07,967
for Wild-Style

660
00:38:07,968 --> 00:38:11,377
<i>Darkness.
It's about me being an orphan.</i>

661
00:38:11,378 --> 00:38:12,986
<i>No parents</i>

662
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:16,288
This is real music, Emmet.
The Batman is a true artist.

663
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:20,117
He's dark, rooting
Well I'm dark and rooting too

664
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:24,080
- Guys, look, a rainbow!
- So you gonna drive up the curve part

665
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:26,503
Take it all the way to the top.

666
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:28,893
And park the car.

667
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:32,718
Friends,
welcome to cloud cuckoo land!

668
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,022
Now...

669
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,888
I just need to give
the secret knock.

670
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:52,516
Okay...

671
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:02,173
I just want to come right out, 
I have no idea what's going on

672
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:06,900
Or what is that place is at all.
Hello, I'm am Princess Uni-Kitty

and I welcome you all
to cloud cuckoo land

674
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:16,850
but theres no signs or anything.
How does anyone know what not to do?

675
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:19,992
Here In Cloud cuckoo land
there are no rules!

676
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:24,605
There's no government, no babysitters,
no bedtime.

677
00:39:24,606 --> 00:39:28,445
No frowning faces
No bushy moustaches,

678
00:39:28,446 --> 00:39:32,974
And no negativity of any kind. 
You just said the word 'no'

679
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:35,531
Like a thousand times. 
and there also no consistency

680
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:39,790
- I hate this place.
- Any idea is a good idea,

681
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,483
Except the not happy ones

682
00:39:41,484 --> 00:39:43,482
Those you push down deep inside

683
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:48,835
where you'll, never, never,
ever find them.

684
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:51,671
Your fellow Master Builders
are gathered in the dog.

685
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:52,976
The WHAT?!!

686
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:57,995
- Is that Superman?
- Bonjour!

687
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,732
Girl,
What are you doing right now?

688
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,035
It's Superman! Hey, what's up?

689
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:05,106
Lantern. Green Lantern.
You want to sit together at the meeting?

690
00:40:05,107 --> 00:40:08,018
I have to go back to Krypton.

691
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,436
Didn't Krypton blow up?

692
00:40:09,437 --> 00:40:10,914
My fellow Master Builders,

693
00:40:10,915 --> 00:40:13,314
including, but not limited to
Robin Hood,

694
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:15,774
Mermaid lady, Gandalf
Swamp creature

695
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:17,503
1980's ...something space guy.
Hi!

696
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:20,452
2002 NBA All Stars
and Wonder Woman.

697
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,766
You have traveled far to be here,
for a moment of great importance.

698
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:30,113
We have learned that Lord Business
plans to unleash a full weaponised Kragle

699
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:34,404
on Taco Tuesday, to end
the world as we know it.

700
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,040
Please!, calm yourselves.
Green Ninja, Milhouse,

701
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:42,054
Nice Vampires, Michelangelo,
Michalangelo and Cleopatra.

702
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:46,402
There is yet one hope,
the Special has arisen.

703
00:40:47,806 --> 00:40:50,787
- Have the young man step forward.
- As you wish, Dobledore.

704
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:53,628
I'm the Gandalf.
Its Pronounced Dumbledore.

705
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:55,627
Dobledore? No! Dumbledore!

706
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:57,463
- You said Dobledore.
- Vitruvius!

707
00:40:57,464 --> 00:41:00,744
Time to get away right now, cos I'm not
going to remember any of it...but here we go.

708
00:41:02,665 --> 00:41:05,945
The Special will now
give an eloquent speech.

709
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,594
Go ahead man you got this.

710
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:15,180
Okay.

711
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,041
Hello, I'm Emmet.

712
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:26,316
Ohh And this is
the piece of Resistence.

713
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,836
Thank you.

714
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,678
Well ..

715
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:42,839
I know that I for one am very excited
to work with you guys.

716
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,326
Get into the octant tower

717
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:46,791
find the Kragle
and put this thing on the thing.

718
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,939
And I know its going to be really
hard...

719
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,953
Really hard?

720
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:56,221
Wiping your bum with a hook
for a hand is really hard.

721
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,018
This be impossible!

722
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:00,564
The last time we tried to storm
Lord Business's office.

723
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:03,334
We used every plan we could conceive.

724
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:07,532
The result was a massacre too terrible to
speak of.

725
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:10,932
Who are you? The name be Metal Beard.

726
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:15,377
- I will tell you me tale of woe.
- Oh great here we go again.

727
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:20,525
I arrived at the foot of the tower, with me
hardy Master builder crew

728
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:25,029
Only to find the Kragle was all the
way up on the infinity-th floor.

729
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,533
Guarded by a Robot army

730
00:42:27,534 --> 00:42:31,601
and security measures of every kind
imagineable.

731
00:42:31,602 --> 00:42:32,951
Lasers.

732
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:34,664
Sharks.

733
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,940
Laser Sharks.

734
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:39,667
Overbearing assistants.

735
00:42:39,668 --> 00:42:45,300
And strange dangerous relics 
that entrap, snap, and zap.

736
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:49,599
And there be a mysterious room
called The Think-tank.

737
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:54,292
I barely made it out one with just me head

738
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:57,561
and organs.

739
00:42:57,895 --> 00:43:00,534
- Okayyy.
- I had to replace every part

740
00:43:00,535 --> 00:43:03,520
my once strapping virile
Pirate body

741
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:07,506
with this useless hunk of garbage,
You see before you.

742
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:09,801
So if ye think it be a good idea
to return

743
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:13,437
to that forsaken place, Special

744
00:43:13,438 --> 00:43:18,119
What idea have you, that be better
than the ideas of 100

745
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,839
of our fallen
Master Builder brothers.

746
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:25,703
Well technically, I'm not exactly
a Master Builder yet.

747
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:27,105
WHAT?

748
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:31,172
Please, everyone ...everyone
Please...

749
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:34,212
Rubbish. Yeah, it's true.

750
00:43:34,213 --> 00:43:36,714
I may not be a Master Builder,

751
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,504
I may not have a
lot of experience.

752
00:43:39,505 --> 00:43:42,571
Fighting, or leading
or coming up with plans.

753
00:43:43,342 --> 00:43:45,491
Or having ideas in general.

754
00:43:45,892 --> 00:43:48,716
In fact, I'm not all that smart.

755
00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:53,151
And I'm not what you'd call
creative type.

756
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:57,442
Plus, generally unskilled.

757
00:43:57,934 --> 00:44:02,198
Also, scared, and cowardly.

758
00:44:03,136 --> 00:44:04,800
I know what you're thinking.

759
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:09,848
He is the least qualified person
in the world to lead us.

760
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,097
And you are right.

761
00:44:12,098 --> 00:44:15,751
Is that supposed to make us feel better?

762
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:19,418
There was about to be a "but".
You're a but.

763
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:22,605
You'll all be on your own.

764
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:25,317
I'll be leaving this lost cause.

765
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:28,365
Why are you leaving?

766
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,873
A house divided against itself.

767
00:44:30,874 --> 00:44:32,538
Would be better than this.

768
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,649
Abraham Lincoln. You Bring your
space chair right back here.

769
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,275
Come on, guys.

770
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,755
We can still do this, Right?

771
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:45,832
Well you were right about him being
a ding dong.

772
00:44:48,506 --> 00:44:50,262
Get him outa here.

773
00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:57,017
Well at least it can't get any worse.

774
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:00,594
I was wrong.

775
00:45:03,648 --> 00:45:05,773
It's the orb of..

776
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:09,467
Oh-Ohh, its the bad guys.

777
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:12,240
- How did he...
- Go!

778
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:15,690
Come on everyone, protect the special.
Whats that on his angkle?

779
00:45:16,436 --> 00:45:20,223
It's a tracking device.
Take the Master Builders prisoners.

780
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:24,412
Oh he lead them right to us
Guys, no no it's not my fault

781
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:28,221
You're the worst leader I have ever seen.
To the Batmobile.

782
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,562
- Dang it
- To the invisible jet

783
00:45:33,129 --> 00:45:35,435
- Dang it
- Every man for himself.

784
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:37,436
No, we have to protect piece.

785
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:41,374
Shaq, did you know what time it is?
It's game time.

786
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:45,605
You'all ready for this?

787
00:45:47,796 --> 00:45:49,420
Ohh no they were ready for that.

788
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:51,942
It didn't break. Because it's Kragled

789
00:45:51,943 --> 00:45:53,244
Machine Gum.

790
00:45:53,768 --> 00:45:55,112
Fire.

791
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:59,755
I can't move. Don't worry
Superman, I'll get you outa there.

792
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,291
No don't

793
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:03,487
Ohh my Gosh, my hands are stuck.

794
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:06,452
My legs are stuck as well.
I super hate you.

795
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:12,520
- Bat, help me out here.
- I said, every man for himself.

796
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:14,219
Hey you gotta be there for me

797
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,553
Fine. Fine. Fine.

798
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:23,958
I need to have a better attitude about it.
I had a great attitute

799
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:28,620
The special is in the northwest quadrant,
we've got him cornered.

800
00:46:30,035 --> 00:46:31,441
Where'd he go?

801
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:39,029
Oh no they have got out cloud stablizers.

802
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,938
Lets go We need to get
Emmet out of here!

803
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:42,418
Can't we build something?

804
00:46:42,419 --> 00:46:44,277
Hey I'm Ben, but you can
call me Benny.

805
00:46:44,278 --> 00:46:46,102
Can I build a ship. Watch this

806
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,441
No you can't, the skies are surrounded

807
00:46:50,442 --> 00:46:53,381
That's okay, I didn't want to really build 
a space ship anyway that's cool

808
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:56,154
Where can we go where we can't be found?

809
00:46:56,155 --> 00:46:59,382
Maybe we can go underwater?
What if we went underwater?

810
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,330
Great idea, babe
Thank you, Batman.

811
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:02,645
Your idea are the best.

812
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:04,725
But hey I just said that.
We could build a submarine.

813
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:07,742
- A-bat-submarine. Patent bending. 
- With rainbows

814
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:10,083
And dreamcatchers,
in case we take a nap.

815
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:13,016
Like an underwater spaceship.
But you can't built all of them at once.

816
00:47:13,017 --> 00:47:14,367
Ready? Break!

817
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:18,580
Okay... These are the colour I make, 
Blue raspberry and sour apple.

818
00:47:18,581 --> 00:47:20,643
If anybody has black parts I need them okay

819
00:47:20,644 --> 00:47:24,482
I only work in black, and sometimes
in very very dark gray.

820
00:47:24,483 --> 00:47:26,244
- Use the yellow prints.
- You guys can I help?

821
00:47:26,268 --> 00:47:28,099
No, it has to be this way, no I need that

822
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,462
Where is he? Anyone know what this is? 
And do you need it

823
00:47:31,463 --> 00:47:35,685
- I could use wings, rocket boosters.
- Get our retro space out of my area

824
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,671
You guys hey tell me exactly what to do.
And how to do it.

825
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:41,834
Emmet, don't worry about
what the others are doing.

826
00:47:41,835 --> 00:47:45,677
You must embrace
what is special about you.

827
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,120
There he is. All Units attack the sub

828
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,944
Emmet, get in here.

829
00:48:08,488 --> 00:48:10,308
Stop him!

830
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:12,268
Don't let them get to the water.

831
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,803
Dive! Dive! Everybody in, 
we're falling under

832
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:33,394
Oh no.

833
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:55,190
My home...

834
00:48:57,183 --> 00:48:58,486
It's gone.

835
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:04,802
I feel something inside its like...

836
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:07,557
the opposite of happiness.

837
00:49:07,558 --> 00:49:11,094
I must stay positive.

838
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,096
Bubble gum.

839
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:18,048
Butterflies.

840
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,006
Cotton Candy.

841
00:49:25,143 --> 00:49:28,073
I'm so sorry, Uni-Kitty.

842
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:31,355
You want to sit down and talk about it?

843
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:35,990
What the heck is that?

844
00:49:35,991 --> 00:49:37,833
It's a double-decker couch.

845
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:43,476
Which seemed like a good idea, at the time,
but I now realise, its not super helpful.

846
00:49:43,477 --> 00:49:48,585
But it has cup holders
seat flip up with coolers underneath.

847
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:53,018
You are so disappointing,
in so many levels.

848
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:56,135
Why are my pants cold and wet?

849
00:49:59,145 --> 00:50:02,344
The wall are crying. 
We are going to be part of the sea!

850
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,620
This is not how Batman dies.

851
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:10,483
Emmet, hold on. Hold on. Wild-Style.

852
00:50:11,781 --> 00:50:14,049
Deep breath. Deep breath everyone

853
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:34,363
Micro-managers, whats going
on down there?

854
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:37,834
<i> Scanning submarine wreckage </i>

855
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:40,875
<i> No survivors detected.</i>

856
00:50:40,876 --> 00:50:44,191
Scan the entire ocean of you have to

857
00:50:44,192 --> 00:50:46,460
We've got to find that beast.

858
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:50,009
Let's take these prisoners back to Lord
Business and give him the good news.

859
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:52,443
The Special is... no more.

860
00:50:57,073 --> 00:51:00,457
Hello, everbody. Superman
Wonder Woman.

861
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:01,761
I had no idea you'd be here.

862
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:05,270
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.
Greetings... ALL.

863
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,718
Welcome to my think-tank.

864
00:51:09,993 --> 00:51:12,276
All Master Builders you 
captured over the years...

865
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:16,052
You brought them here. -You are a
very perceptive person. Superman.

866
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:19,960
They've come up with all the instruction 
for everything in the universe

867
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:22,645
- Robots.
- No, no!

868
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:29,532
Can't get much worse than this.

869
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,820
Hello, neighbor! Oh no.

870
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:34,850
It's Green Lantern! Ohh
My Gosh, we're roomates.

871
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:36,378
How crazy is that.

872
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:39,212
Does anyone have some Kryptonite
there, they could give me?

873
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,858
Where is the Special?

874
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:45,543
The special and the piece of Resistance,
are at the bottom of the ocean.

875
00:51:45,544 --> 00:51:48,319
Are you telling you don't him?

876
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,013
Sir, my scuba teams
are looking for his remains

877
00:51:51,014 --> 00:51:52,317
as we speak.

878
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:56,043
Bad Cop he could still be alive.
The piece could still be out there.

879
00:51:56,044 --> 00:51:59,891
The only remnants of the Special
was a double-decker couch.

880
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:04,342
Wait, hold on, a double-decker
couch... Yes, sir.

881
00:52:04,343 --> 00:52:08,281
Really? So its like a bunk-bed couch.
Is that what its like?

882
00:52:08,282 --> 00:52:09,891
Thats weird.

883
00:52:09,892 --> 00:52:11,486
If you're sitting in the top middle

884
00:52:11,487 --> 00:52:13,576
How you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?

885
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:16,532
If you're sitting on the bottom,
and you're watching TV.

886
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,362
Are you're gonna have to walk
rough a bunch of dangly legs.

887
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,154
Who gonna want to
sit at the bottom?

888
00:52:21,155 --> 00:52:26,810
It's literally the most useless
idea I have ever heard.

889
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:34,915
Well, we're still alive. Yeeeah.
The Doubledecker couch.

890
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:38,913
It wasn't totally pointless after all. 
Its the one thing that stayed together.

891
00:52:38,914 --> 00:52:42,709
I always believed in you, Emmett.
I don't want to spoil the party...

892
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,385
but does anyone else notice we're stuck in
the middle of the ocean, on this couch?

893
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:51,163
I mean It's not like a big gigantic ship is just gonna
come out of nowhere and save us. My Gosh!

894
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:58,771
Alas!..Matey's.

895
00:53:04,753 --> 00:53:07,759
Metal beard I thought you said 
we were a lost cause

896
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:09,026
You are!

897
00:53:09,027 --> 00:53:14,590
Did you not hear me whole story
cicumscribing the folly of this whole enterprise?

898
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,963
That's kinda hard not to hear 
when you're yelling everything.

899
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:21,648
- So why did you come back?
- This be double land couch.

900
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,308
I watch Lord Business's forces
completely overlook it.

901
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,563
Which means we need more ideas like it.

902
00:53:29,564 --> 00:53:31,841
- Thank you 
- Ideas so dumb and bad.

903
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:35,586
That no one would ever think they could
possibly be useful.

904
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:40,613
Oh Thank you.
So Special-what we do?

905
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:44,558
Errr...

906
00:53:46,243 --> 00:53:46,743
Well.

907
00:53:47,215 --> 00:53:50,142
What's the last thing Lord Business

908
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,154
expects Master Builders would do?

909
00:53:52,155 --> 00:53:53,609
Build a Space-ship?
Kill-Chickens?

910
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,460
- Marshmallow.
- Why, this?

911
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:03,187
No!!...Its follow the instructions.

912
00:54:04,546 --> 00:54:07,992
No! no! Listen wait. Listen.

913
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:13,251
Guys you all so talented,
and imagionative.

914
00:54:13,811 --> 00:54:17,175
But, you can't work together as a team.

915
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,593
I'm just a construction worker.

916
00:54:19,993 --> 00:54:21,866
But when I had a plan,

917
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:25,708
and we're all working together we
could build a skyscraper.

918
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:30,878
Now you are all master builders.

919
00:54:30,879 --> 00:54:35,139
Just Imagine what could happen
if you did that.

920
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:38,353
You could save the universe.

921
00:54:38,935 --> 00:54:41,751
Well said, Emmet. Well said!!

922
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:45,659
Really? This be a fine speech there Laddy.

923
00:54:46,018 --> 00:54:47,321
Okay.

924
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:51,544
Someone get me some markers.

925
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,864
Some construction paper.

926
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,628
And some giltter glue!

927
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:03,383
I call this:

928
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,999
Emmet's plan to get inside the tower.

929
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,830
Put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle

930
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:09,134
and save the world.

931
00:55:09,135 --> 00:55:11,904
I've built a hundreds just
like these back in the city.

932
00:55:11,905 --> 00:55:14,734
If we could just get in there,  I'll know 
where the air-ducts, and wiring are located

933
00:55:14,735 --> 00:55:16,037
I can get us anywhere.

934
00:55:16,038 --> 00:55:17,494
How will we get inside.

935
00:55:17,936 --> 00:55:20,423
In a spaceships. Space-Ships!

936
00:55:20,424 --> 00:55:22,531
- Great idea. A Bat-spaceship.
- No.

937
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:25,188
They they are expecting us to
show up in a Bat-Spaceship..

938
00:55:25,213 --> 00:55:27,463
Or Pirate-Spaceship or a
Rainbow-Sparkled-Spaceship

939
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:29,412
On of those sounds awesome to me.

940
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:34,472
My idea is to build a Spaceship, that's
exactly like all the other Octant deliveries Spaceships

941
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:37,912
So now the special Spaceship I am 
building for all of you all right now?

942
00:55:37,913 --> 00:55:39,631
Sorry Benny. Maybe next time.

943
00:55:39,632 --> 00:55:42,559
You really let me oxygen out of my tank here

944
00:55:43,668 --> 00:55:46,040
Yeah, but according to your
precious instructions,

945
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,753
this ship needs a HyperDrive.

946
00:55:47,754 --> 00:55:50,130
We don't have that part
Maybe we could find one.

947
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:52,963
What do you think a Spaceships
gonna appear out of the blue.

948
00:55:52,988 --> 00:55:54,705
Are you kidding me,
the same thing?

949
00:55:59,604 --> 00:56:01,971
Chewie, we're supposed to be
halfway to Naboo

950
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:03,567
for a street party. Right now.

951
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,477
This HyperDrive keeps malfunctioning,
taking us to losers system like this.

952
00:56:07,478 --> 00:56:11,454
Captain Solo, we must go, you know 
how they get if we are not punctual.

953
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,696
The droids right. Lets roll.
Now hold on Hans

954
00:56:14,697 --> 00:56:17,498
This mightn't be the right galaxy
after all,

955
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,911
because I see a heavenly body.

956
00:56:19,912 --> 00:56:23,732
Ohh well I have a boyfriend
and it is super serious. Right babe?

957
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,288
Of course it's serious

958
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:27,628
- Got room for just one dude?
- Woah, Babe.

959
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:29,898
If it's a cool dude like you.

960
00:56:29,899 --> 00:56:32,181
You're trying to bail on us?
I'm not trying to bail.

961
00:56:32,182 --> 00:56:34,324
You're asking if you could go 
with them on their party.

962
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:35,627
<i>That thing is fill wth...</i>

963
00:56:35,628 --> 00:56:37,590
You speak french now? Babe, look

964
00:56:37,591 --> 00:56:39,887
if this relationship ever going to work between us

965
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:42,562
I need to feel free to party 
with a bunch of strangers,

966
00:56:42,563 --> 00:56:43,864
whenever I feel like it

967
00:56:43,865 --> 00:56:48,522
- What? Babe.
- I will text you.

968
00:56:48,523 --> 00:56:51,466
Where you'd get that sweet 
space cape, brother?

969
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:54,923
<i>Party time!</i>

970
00:56:55,894 --> 00:56:57,283
Babe?

971
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:08,031
Wild-Style...

972
00:57:08,032 --> 00:57:12,738
You're such an amazing person, and you
know if Batman can't see that then.

973
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:16,456
He's just, He's just as blind..as
a.

974
00:57:16,457 --> 00:57:20,979
A guy who's eyes stopped working.

975
00:57:22,247 --> 00:57:26,468
And let me tell you something, Batman
is the worst person I've ever met.

976
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:29,928
- Need a HyperDrive?
- No way!!

977
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:31,903
- I knew it! I knew that
- You really had me there!

978
00:57:31,904 --> 00:57:33,205
Those guys are so lame

979
00:57:33,206 --> 00:57:34,883
all I did was play space checkers.

980
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,219
Plus it turned out the hairy one dude
and the metal one to.

981
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,994
All dudes. But wont they notice their 
hyperdrive is missing?

982
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:44,491
Come on, Chewie.
Hit the HyperDrive.

983
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:48,100
Nahh They'll be fine.

984
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:50,221
LET'S MAKE A SPACESHIP!

985
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:56,606
Step 1: Alright we need a
red 4 piece unit over at the..

986
00:57:56,607 --> 00:58:00,184
Uni-Kitty, you're suppose to follow
the instructions, remember?

987
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,486
Sorry!

988
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:05,474
This That gives me the goosebumps!
What do I even? I can't!

989
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:08,801
Nice.

990
00:58:09,163 --> 00:58:10,508
Step 2:

991
00:58:10,509 --> 00:58:13,919
We piloted the ship to the service entrance 
so we can get pass to the dangerous

992
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,419
but also kinda cool laser gate.

993
00:58:18,031 --> 00:58:20,040
Space-ID? I have a drive on.

994
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:23,211
Who are you here to see
I'm here to see your butt.

995
00:58:23,212 --> 00:58:26,824
Is that the last name BUTT or first name Your an...

996
00:58:36,553 --> 00:58:37,857
First try.

997
00:58:38,413 --> 00:58:41,608
<i>Step 3:
We break into Lord Business's office</i>

998
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:44,552
and we'll plunder his collection 
of relics for disguises

999
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:49,569
Step 4: Benny and Metal beard sneak their
way into the master control room.

1000
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:52,824
Motion Sensors triggered
in sector 12. 10-4

1001
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:01,472
Are you thinking what I'm thinking,
Ohhh.

1002
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:03,623
Ohhhh.

1003
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:09,849
Metal-Beard, that was awesome.
First law of the sea.

1004
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,925
Never place your rear
end on a pirates face.

1005
00:59:12,926 --> 00:59:15,678
Once inside they'll use their
technical knowhow.

1006
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:16,984
To disable the Kragle sheild.

1007
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:20,848
I am a computer.
Cool talking computer!

1008
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:25,437
Please disable the shield systems. 
Of course

1009
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:28,628
There are no movies in 
your area with that title

1010
00:59:29,093 --> 00:59:32,880
Step 5: Vitruvius will provide look-out,
to make sure we're not being followed.

1011
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:35,198
OK. Step-6:

1012
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:37,481
Batman and Uni-kitty
go into the boardroom

1013
00:59:37,482 --> 00:59:39,916
to make one last change
to Lord Business's plan.

1014
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:43,009
I move that we freeze the universe.
Can I get a second on that

1015
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:46,560
I second. Bruce Wayne,
C.E.O of Wayne Enterprises.

1016
00:59:46,561 --> 00:59:51,500
Bruce Wayne? Who's that?
Sounds like a cool guy.

1017
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:58,152
We'd like to invest in your company. Your weapon to
control the unverse, sounds super-sweet, I must say.

1018
00:59:58,153 --> 01:00:03,066
It is. Indeed super-sweet. Cool!
What kind of sound system? Does it have.

1019
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:07,326
Sound System? Well I mean we have an iPod
Shuffle -Wait a second.

1020
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:09,303
Your telling me you have a machine
to control the universe

1021
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:11,382
and you can't listen to tunes in surround
sound.

1022
01:00:11,683 --> 01:00:13,980
Embarrassing. Well we - We...

1023
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:16,310
We need to get that done.
I want 8 foot speakers.

1024
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:18,268
Great call. Yeh
I want speakers...

1025
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:20,793
That you can hug
with his arms and your legs

1026
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:22,415
and just feel the beat.

1027
01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:26,951
Listen up we need new instruction 
for bigger system for TACO.

1028
01:00:26,952 --> 01:00:29,772
We will never help...Whatever you said boss

1029
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,784
Then once the instructions,
are printed.

1030
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:34,003
Wild-Style and I will enter
the Kragle room.

1031
01:00:34,304 --> 01:00:37,699
Place the thing on the other thing,
and save the universe.

1032
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:40,789
I didn't draw that.
Is that me exploding?

1033
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,738
I didn't mention that earlier

1034
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,716
when you re-unite the piece with
the Kragle it might explode?

1035
01:00:45,717 --> 01:00:47,943
No. But might not, right?

1036
01:00:48,698 --> 01:00:51,599
Sure, sure, sure.
Let's go with that.

1037
01:00:52,132 --> 01:00:54,778
Attention everybody, incoming 
speaker delivery

1038
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,339
Who are you two?
We are transfers from downstairs.

1039
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,664
What? Excuse me?

1040
01:01:09,665 --> 01:01:12,624
Your robot voice, sounds a
awful lot like a human voice.

1041
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,953
Give me a break.
I've never built a robot before.

1042
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:16,915
What do you mean? You
have always been a robot.

1043
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:19,055
No. No. No. Do not listen to her.

1044
01:01:19,056 --> 01:01:21,299
What are your robot
serial numbers?

1045
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:29,894
Everything is Awesome.

1046
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,823
No way this is my jam.
This is also my jam.

1047
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:35,731
Everything is Awesome.

1048
01:01:35,732 --> 01:01:38,348
Everything is good 
When you're part of the team.

1049
01:01:38,349 --> 01:01:41,027
Sing. I do not want to sing this song.

1050
01:01:41,028 --> 01:01:43,284
Everything is awesome.

1051
01:01:43,746 --> 01:01:47,140
Everything is cool
When you're part of the team.

1052
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:52,707
Everything is awesome
when you're part of the team.

1053
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:54,622
Quick, let's go.

1054
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,772
I thought you like that song.

1055
01:01:57,773 --> 01:01:59,249
I don't

1056
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:05,508
I don't want to put this tough act but I don't think
you're as mean as you're trying to say

1057
01:02:05,509 --> 01:02:08,247
ME? I'm not mean. What are you talking 
about? Just saying you were all

1058
01:02:08,248 --> 01:02:11,260
He is not special.
He can't possibly be Special.

1059
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:13,509
This guy? Are you kidding?

1060
01:02:14,486 --> 01:02:18,131
I don't think thats you.
The real you anyway.

1061
01:02:26,662 --> 01:02:28,052
Look, Emmet ...I

1062
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,899
I wanted it to be me, ok

1063
01:02:32,894 --> 01:02:34,806
I wanted to be the special.

1064
01:02:35,276 --> 01:02:38,614
and I know that sounds super
mature, it's just...

1065
01:02:39,115 --> 01:02:43,023
Ever since I heard the prophecy,
I wanted to be the one.

1066
01:02:43,405 --> 01:02:46,446
I was right there
in that construction site...

1067
01:02:46,447 --> 01:02:48,571
right on top of it, and then...

1068
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:51,737
It turn out to be you.

1069
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:01,305
That night in the city when you thought
that I was the special...

1070
01:03:04,466 --> 01:03:08,149
when you said I was
talented and important.

1071
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,749
That was the first time
anyone had ever told me that.

1072
01:03:13,033 --> 01:03:15,353
It made me want to do everything
I could, to be the guy, ,,

1073
01:03:15,354 --> 01:03:17,575
you were talking about.

1074
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:23,124
Lucy. What?

1075
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:28,087
That was my real name.
You asked earlier, and its...

1076
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:30,391
Lucy.

1077
01:03:33,905 --> 01:03:35,209
I really like that name.

1078
01:03:39,488 --> 01:03:41,814
Hey what are you two losers tallking about?

1079
01:03:41,815 --> 01:03:43,646
Oh nothing. Thought I'll help you guys.

1080
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:45,687
Let the weird cat thing to stall

1081
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,268
Business, Business, business.
Numbers. Is this working?

1082
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:51,023
Yes! Yay.

1083
01:03:51,024 --> 01:03:52,325
There's Bad Cop.

1084
01:03:56,067 --> 01:03:59,496
Okay, wait for my signal.
Good luck, Emmet.

1085
01:03:59,977 --> 01:04:04,358
Lucy... I think this might
be goodbye.

1086
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:07,195
I don't like goodbyes.
Let's just call this:

1087
01:04:07,852 --> 01:04:10,562
"See you later, alligator."

1088
01:04:10,563 --> 01:04:12,958
"See you later, alligator"?

1089
01:04:14,786 --> 01:04:16,676
After a while, crocodile.

1090
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,422
Who's Lucy?

1091
01:04:21,423 --> 01:04:24,893
Batman, when we get inside the room
there'll be audio sensors everywhere.

1092
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:26,731
We have to be really really quiet

1093
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:29,954
Don't worry dad I read your 
dumb instructions. Stop yelling at me.

1094
01:04:29,955 --> 01:04:31,685
Benny, What's the status with the shield?

1095
01:04:31,686 --> 01:04:35,446
Yeah it's going great.
If somebody were to listen to me

1096
01:04:35,447 --> 01:04:38,032
Downloading the latest episode
"Where are my pants?"

1097
01:04:38,033 --> 01:04:40,600
<i>What are you talking about?
You know what I want.</i>

1098
01:04:42,681 --> 01:04:43,983
Bad cop.

1099
01:04:43,984 --> 01:04:45,928
<i> Hi this is
Lord Business's assistance, </i>

1100
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:48,110
<i>he would like you to come
to his office immediately.</i>

1101
01:04:48,111 --> 01:04:50,354
I'll be there thanks. You're welcome sir

1102
01:04:53,962 --> 01:04:55,523
Hey who is that?

1103
01:04:58,616 --> 01:05:01,462
Thats the signal, but
the shield is still up.

1104
01:05:01,463 --> 01:05:02,906
We'll wing it.

1105
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,545
Its a Bat punt.

1106
01:05:08,709 --> 01:05:12,401
Benny, disable the shield.
Disable the shield. Now.

1107
01:05:12,402 --> 01:05:15,390
<i>Disable the shield!
Searching for Albanian restaurant.</i>

1108
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:18,981
<i>No! I never once said anything!
I do not understand what you mean.</i>

1109
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:21,827
- Disable the shield!
- Benny, what's going on?

1110
01:05:21,828 --> 01:05:23,457
<i>Disable the shield. Come on</i>

1111
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:27,364
<i> You are undermining me.
Which phrase would like me to undermine?</i>

1112
01:05:27,365 --> 01:05:29,721
Disable the shield. Let me try.

1113
01:05:29,722 --> 01:05:33,935
Be he disabling of yon shield.

1114
01:05:33,936 --> 01:05:36,009
Disabling shield. What?

1115
01:05:39,751 --> 01:05:42,067
Okay. In three.

1116
01:05:43,721 --> 01:05:45,196
Two.

1117
01:05:46,285 --> 01:05:47,617
One.

1118
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,408
Lets do this.

1119
01:05:51,496 --> 01:05:52,945
Lucy!

1120
01:05:55,686 --> 01:05:58,859
Lucy! No!

1121
01:06:00,535 --> 01:06:02,315
Oh man

1122
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:08,133
Sneaking around the corner.

1123
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:15,104
Vitruvius, I see you've accidently
wandered into my Think-tank.

1124
01:06:15,105 --> 01:06:17,839
And by the way, I found
a few of your friends.

1125
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,777
I wish -I mean, all of them.
Sorry!!

1126
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:23,537
Acceptable work Bad Cop
Thank you, sir.

1127
01:06:23,538 --> 01:06:26,391
Robots, destroy this old man
at once.

1128
01:06:26,392 --> 01:06:29,524
Did -You just call me old?
Yeah, so what?

1129
01:06:29,961 --> 01:06:33,723
Well Junebug I really prefer
the word "experienced".

1130
01:06:51,046 --> 01:06:52,348
You see, Emmet?

1131
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:56,203
A corrupted spirit is no match
for the purity of imagination...

1132
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:01,857
Vitruvius! No!

1133
01:07:04,339 --> 01:07:09,003
Vitruvius. My sweet Emmet, come closer.

1134
01:07:09,717 --> 01:07:12,443
You must know something
about the prophecy.

1135
01:07:12,444 --> 01:07:14,709
I know, I'm doing
the best, but...

1136
01:07:15,236 --> 01:07:16,539
The prophecy...

1137
01:07:17,276 --> 01:07:19,970
I made it up. What?

1138
01:07:20,556 --> 01:07:23,613
I made it up. It's not true.

1139
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:27,664
That means I'm just...
I'm not the special?

1140
01:07:27,988 --> 01:07:29,378
You must listen.

1141
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,561
What I'm about to tell you,

1142
01:07:31,562 --> 01:07:34,429
will change the course
of history.

1143
01:07:40,991 --> 01:07:42,294
No.

1144
01:07:50,783 --> 01:07:54,386
Hey, not so special anymore, huh?

1145
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:59,899
Look guess what? No one ever
told me I was special.

1146
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,262
I never got a trophy
just for showing up.

1147
01:08:03,263 --> 01:08:07,991
I'm not some special little
Snowflake... No!!

1148
01:08:08,342 --> 01:08:10,709
But as unspecial as I am...

1149
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:15,615
you are a thousand billion times
more unspecial than me.

1150
01:08:15,616 --> 01:08:19,058
Robots bring me the sword
of exact zero.

1151
01:08:19,059 --> 01:08:22,783
Yes, Lord Business.
It must be weird.

1152
01:08:22,784 --> 01:08:26,446
One minute your the most special
person in the universe.

1153
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,874
The next minute you're nobody.

1154
01:08:31,582 --> 01:08:35,022
Ohh I have a nice spot for
this, in my relics room.

1155
01:08:36,093 --> 01:08:38,875
Ohh ho my mistake. There it goes.

1156
01:08:38,876 --> 01:08:40,425
No!

1157
01:08:40,426 --> 01:08:42,287
Bye-bye forever.

1158
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:46,568
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

1159
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,224
Release the Kragle.

1160
01:08:52,016 --> 01:08:52,900
<i>Computer? Yes, sir.</i>

1161
01:08:53,201 --> 01:08:55,409
Set the electric shocker
to 100 Mississipis.

1162
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:56,610
<i>No problems.</i>

1163
01:08:56,611 --> 01:08:58,934
And terminate everyone, already on it

1164
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:03,207
Emmet, that should give you enough time to
witness the first location to be Kragled.

1165
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:04,946
Your hometown. No!

1166
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:07,837
Bad Cop, we may have to leave
you here to die.

1167
01:09:07,938 --> 01:09:10,623
What? Sir? It's not personal.

1168
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:15,332
It's just business.
Lord Business.

1169
01:09:15,962 --> 01:09:17,285
Ciao.

1170
01:09:18,556 --> 01:09:23,062
<i>Begin zaping termination in
99 Mississipis.</i>

1171
01:09:23,063 --> 01:09:26,932
<i>98 Mississipis. 97 Mississipis.</i>

1172
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:28,832
<i>And so on...</i>

1173
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:52,803
<i>Attention everyone.
This is President Business.</i>

1174
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:57,586
<i>Hello, welcome to Taco Tuesday.</i>

1175
01:09:57,587 --> 01:10:02,806
Don't worry about this big
black balloon blocking the sun.

1176
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:04,994
What you need to worry about
is this question.

1177
01:10:04,995 --> 01:10:07,358
I'm about to ask you.

1178
01:10:07,559 --> 01:10:09,779
Who wants a taco?

1179
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:15,553
Taco! Taco! Go crazy

1180
01:10:17,037 --> 01:10:21,076
Alright everyone. Act normal.

1181
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,100
Perfect

1182
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:26,737
Now, everybody says "freeze".

1183
01:10:29,545 --> 01:10:33,129
So, I guess running around
and screaming, is normal.

1184
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,619
Micromanagers,
commence micromanagement.

1185
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,139
Commencing micromanagement.

1186
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:47,594
Please. Please...
Won't somebody help us

1187
01:10:47,595 --> 01:10:50,117
Emmet you'll think
of something, right?

1188
01:10:50,118 --> 01:10:51,515
Like you always do.

1189
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:54,453
Didn't you hear him.

1190
01:10:54,454 --> 01:10:56,201
The Prophecy's made up.

1191
01:10:57,305 --> 01:10:59,014
I'm not the special.

1192
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:02,697
To think for a moment I might be.

1193
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,683
<i>Emmet... Who said that?</i>

1194
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:11,792
I did
I am the ghost of Vitruvius.

1195
01:11:15,393 --> 01:11:19,717
Emmet, you didn't let me finish
earlier, because I died ..

1196
01:11:19,718 --> 01:11:21,896
The reason I made up the prophecy.

1197
01:11:21,897 --> 01:11:26,396
Was because I knew that whoever
found the piece, could become the special.

1198
01:11:26,397 --> 01:11:29,118
Because the only thing
anyone needs to be special.

1199
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:31,392
Is to believe, that you can be.

1200
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:35,924
I know it sounds like a
cat-poster but it's true

1201
01:11:36,411 --> 01:11:39,788
Look at what you did, when
you believed you were special.

1202
01:11:40,204 --> 01:11:42,829
You Just need to believe it
some more.

1203
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:46,014
How can I just decide to
believe, that I'm special.

1204
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:47,447
When I'm not.

1205
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:51,178
Because the world depends on it.

1206
01:11:56,437 --> 01:12:00,434
<i>- Zapping termination in 35 mississipis.
- What ?</i>

1207
01:12:00,435 --> 01:12:04,246
<i>34, 33...</i>

1208
01:12:04,247 --> 01:12:08,253

<i>26, 25...</i>

1212
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:32,445
Emmet, what are you...

1213
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:40,299
Lucy... Wait, what do you...

1214
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,231
Now it's your turn
to be the hero.

1215
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,209
Nooo!

1216
01:12:45,776 --> 01:12:48,883
See you later-alligator. Don't!

1217
01:12:50,555 --> 01:12:52,948
No Emmet!

1218
01:12:55,032 --> 01:12:57,038
<i>6...</i>

1219
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,727

<i>Termination Failure.</i>

1223
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:12,246
Emmet...

1224
01:13:27,706 --> 01:13:29,255
He saved us.

1225
01:13:30,404 --> 01:13:34,037
What do we do now? There's gotta
be a bright sight here somewhere

1226
01:13:34,038 --> 01:13:35,844
Does anyone have any ideas?

1227
01:13:36,587 --> 01:13:38,628
Emmet had ideas.

1228
01:13:38,629 --> 01:13:43,001
Arrr if only there were more people
in the world like he.

1229
01:13:47,087 --> 01:13:48,533
Maybe there are.

1230
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,813
Meet me downstairs in
10 seconds.

1231
01:13:50,814 --> 01:13:52,446
AFTER 10 SECONDS

1232
01:13:52,447 --> 01:13:56,681
<i>Honey, where are my pants?</i>

1233
01:13:57,663 --> 01:14:00,273
Hey guess what found your pants. Series is over.

1234
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:03,532
Benny, send this out to everyone in the universe.

1235
01:14:03,533 --> 01:14:07,063
1980's something technology,
Now your talking.

1236
01:14:11,533 --> 01:14:12,947
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

1237
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,949
You don't know me,
but I'm on TV,

1238
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,701
<i>So you can trust me.</i>

1239
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,247
I know things seem kinda bad right now.

1240
01:14:19,849 --> 01:14:22,065
But there is a way out of this.

1241
01:14:22,982 --> 01:14:27,089
This is Emmet. And he was
just like all of you.

1242
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:30,949
An face in the crowd followed
the same instructions as you.

1243
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:34,605
He was so good at fitting in, 
no one ever saw him

1244
01:14:35,025 --> 01:14:36,805
And I owe you an apology.

1245
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:39,465
Because I used to look 
down on people like that.

1246
01:14:39,466 --> 01:14:42,555
"I used to think they were
followers"

1247
01:14:42,556 --> 01:14:45,474
"with no ideas or any vision.."

1248
01:14:45,475 --> 01:14:47,874
<i> Because it turns out Emmet <i>
had great ideas.</i>

1249
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:52,114
<i>And even they seemed weird,
and kinda pointless</i>

1250
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:56,618
<i> they actually came closer than anyone 
else to save the universe. </i>

1251
01:14:57,063 --> 01:15:00,075
<i>And now we have to finish
what he started,</i>

1252
01:15:00,076 --> 01:15:03,678
 <i> By making whatever weird 
things pop into our heads </i>

1253
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,092
<i> All of you have the ability inside 
of you to become a ground breaker </i>

1254
01:15:07,093 --> 01:15:09,995
<i> and I mean literally
break the ground </i>

1255
01:15:09,996 --> 01:15:12,649
<i>Clear up the pices, clear apart your walls</i>

1256
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:16,251
<i>Build things only you can build,
defend yourselves.</i>

1257
01:15:16,252 --> 01:15:20,995
<i>We need to fight back against 
President Business's plan to freeze us.</i>

1258
01:15:21,472 --> 01:15:24,336
<i> Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday</i>

1259
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:28,425
<i>It will be known as freedom friday.</i>

1260
01:15:30,374 --> 01:15:32,957
But still on a Tuesday!

1261
01:15:38,494 --> 01:15:40,636
End of the line.

1262
01:15:42,895 --> 01:15:44,298
Bad Cop?

1263
01:15:44,299 --> 01:15:46,379
I hope there's still a good cop
in me somewhere else.

1264
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:51,307
I'll hold these guys up. 
You go stop em yeyy!

1265
01:15:52,599 --> 01:15:55,293
Great idea,
but how will we get there?

1266
01:15:59,978 --> 01:16:03,305
I could...

1267
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:07,901
I could build. I could build a spaceship.

1268
01:16:09,181 --> 01:16:13,617
Your not gonna say no? Build away!
Whatever your name is.

1269
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:19,510
Spaceship!

1270
01:16:22,726 --> 01:16:24,117
Spaceship!

1271
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:28,715
Spaceship. Spaceship!

1272
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:32,230
Spaceship!

1273
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:34,178
All units, attacking that Spaceship.

1274
01:16:35,574 --> 01:16:36,876
Spaceship!

1275
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:40,071
Where did he go? Space-Ship!

1276
01:16:42,624 --> 01:16:45,809
Wild-Style, look! It's the citizens.

1277
01:16:51,314 --> 01:16:52,656
Tally hoe

1278
01:16:53,523 --> 01:16:55,137
And the Old West.

1279
01:16:55,659 --> 01:16:57,776
And don't forget us Master Builders.

1280
01:16:57,777 --> 01:16:59,768
What is going on?

1281
01:16:59,769 --> 01:17:04,184
You stop building! Just stop it!

1282
01:17:08,214 --> 01:17:10,276
Great job. This might actually work.

1283
01:17:10,277 --> 01:17:14,218
It was your speech with 
rouse this hearty crew

1284
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:16,557
If only Emmet we here to see this

1285
01:17:16,558 --> 01:17:18,711
He'd say something adorable like...

1286
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:27,686


1287
01:17:27,687 --> 01:17:30,564
<i>Forever.</i>

1288
01:17:41,883 --> 01:17:44,337
It is another vision?

1289
01:17:46,235 --> 01:17:47,688
Where am I?

1290
01:17:48,525 --> 01:17:51,535
Is that the Office tower?

1291
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,030
What was that?

1292
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:07,242
No.

1293
01:18:08,343 --> 01:18:10,539
The spaceship!

1294
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:13,177
What in the world is that?

1295
01:18:14,624 --> 01:18:17,341
It's adorable.

1296
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:20,394
Oh Ohh.

1297
01:18:21,255 --> 01:18:23,408
No! No!

1298
01:18:23,409 --> 01:18:26,877
Don't eat me!, Do not eat me
Do not eat me. Please!!

1299
01:18:26,878 --> 01:18:28,381
Hi, Emmet.

1300
01:18:30,536 --> 01:18:31,847
Hi?

1301
01:18:35,117 --> 01:18:36,655
Is this?

1302
01:18:37,267 --> 01:18:38,621
The man...

1303
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:46,480
The man upstairs.

1304
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:55,537
What happened?

1305
01:18:56,575 --> 01:18:59,068
No, no. This is a disaster.

1306
01:18:59,714 --> 01:19:02,602
Why... What?

1307
01:19:02,603 --> 01:19:04,004
What?

1308
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:08,482
Why a dragon on top of the development?

1309
01:19:08,483 --> 01:19:11,512
I was just playing.
I know it's hard to understand,

1310
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,603
but this is dads stuff OK?

1311
01:19:13,604 --> 01:19:18,319
All of this that you see before you
is all your fathers.

1312
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,786
And everything is thought out...

1313
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:25,643
- What did you do down here? Did you the top off of the tower?
- It was an accident.

1314
01:19:25,644 --> 01:19:28,009
You accidentally.

1315
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:33,362
Expertly, carefully took the
entire top off of the tower?

1316
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:35,250
- Yes.
- You know the rules.

1317
01:19:35,251 --> 01:19:38,448
You know the rules this is not a toy.
I kind of is... NO!!

1318
01:19:38,449 --> 01:19:43,185
Actually its a highly sophisticated
interlocking brick system.

1319
01:19:43,186 --> 01:19:44,939
But we bought it at the toy store.

1320
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:48,857
We did but the way I'm using it
makes it an adult thing.

1321
01:19:48,858 --> 01:19:51,281
The box says that is for 8-14

1322
01:19:51,282 --> 01:19:55,229
Thats a suggestion.
They have to put that on there.

1323
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:58,685
You can't expect me to be able 
to resist playing with all this?

1324
01:19:58,686 --> 01:20:01,602
Look move your stuff over to
the Christmas decorations.

1325
01:20:01,603 --> 01:20:04,344
All those bricks, you
can build anything you want.

1326
01:20:07,422 --> 01:20:09,968
Finn, we gonna play a little game.

1327
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:13,807
It's called: "let's put everything
back the way you found it."

1328
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:15,772
But Dad, you don't understand.

1329
01:20:15,773 --> 01:20:19,059
So I can make things the way they're
supposed to be..

1330
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,285
Permanently.

1331
01:20:26,444 --> 01:20:27,928
More Kragle?

1332
01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:30,937
This rebellion ends right right now!

1333
01:20:38,008 --> 01:20:40,842
Oh . No! Stop.

1334
01:20:45,406 --> 01:20:46,862
Fire in the hole.

1335
01:20:50,743 --> 01:20:53,785
Wait, what is happening?
We're going down

1336
01:20:53,786 --> 01:20:55,088
Mayday! Stop!

1337
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:01,170
Hold on, We're coming for ya!

1338
01:21:02,032 --> 01:21:04,704
Stop. oh no.

1339
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:16,112
Too Many micromanagers.

1340
01:21:16,113 --> 01:21:17,628
What am I holding here?

1341
01:21:17,629 --> 01:21:20,621
It's a battle ship. No, its a
hodge podge that's what it is.

1342
01:21:20,622 --> 01:21:24,068
Whats Batman on it?
What is this a robot pirate?

1343
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,984
Stop it!, No stop it. Stop!

1344
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:31,077
I thought I glued over the constructor worker.

1345
01:21:32,168 --> 01:21:34,296
Here, give that to me.

1346
01:21:34,704 --> 01:21:36,880
Stop it!

1347
01:21:36,881 --> 01:21:39,225
<i>All those were my friends, stop it.</i>

1348
01:21:39,226 --> 01:21:42,994
We were a hearty crew but it be

1349
01:21:42,995 --> 01:21:44,601
It be over.

1350
01:21:45,225 --> 01:21:46,675
No!

1351
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:52,965
A Piece of Resistance.
I can still save them.

1352
01:21:52,966 --> 01:21:56,376
Let's get this..off this 
construction worker

1353
01:21:56,377 --> 01:21:59,451
He's not just a construction worker dad
He's a hero.

1354
01:21:59,452 --> 01:22:00,884
Nope he's not.

1355
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:05,896
He is a ordinary, regular,
generic construction worker.

1356
01:22:05,897 --> 01:22:08,295
And I need to put him back, where he belongs

1357
01:22:09,872 --> 01:22:12,762
Now where is my exacto knife.

1358
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:17,630
I gotta get the piece of resistance.

1359
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:21,900
If I could get the attention
of the smaller creature...

1360
01:22:22,636 --> 01:22:23,938
I gotta move.

1361
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,993
Where is that?

1362
01:22:36,628 --> 01:22:37,977
Alright...

1363
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:16,628
- Dad?
- Yes.

1364
01:23:16,629 --> 01:23:19,818
I think I saw the exact in little Zealand.

1365
01:23:19,819 --> 01:23:22,347
Ohh-Great. Thank you.
You're welcome.

1366
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,191
It up to you now, Emmet.

1367
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:38,019
BELIEVE

1368
01:23:41,473 --> 01:23:43,199
<i>Believe</i>

1369
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:48,654
I know it sound like a cat-poster,
but its true.

1370
01:24:10,721 --> 01:24:12,204
Sorry, street.

1371
01:24:24,044 --> 01:24:27,268
I can see everything!

1372
01:24:31,322 --> 01:24:32,964
What the heck is this?

1373
01:24:32,965 --> 01:24:35,836
I am a Master builder.

1374
01:24:37,712 --> 01:24:40,841
Release every micromanager
we have.

1375
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,556
Let's get him, fellas

1376
01:24:46,328 --> 01:24:47,629
Hey everyone.

1377
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:50,086
Emmet!

1378
01:24:52,635 --> 01:24:56,717
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing.
You got it, Emmet.

1379
01:24:56,718 --> 01:24:58,360
Take that.

1380
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,796
- Come here.
- Woah wreck it

1381
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:06,693
Here's how we do it pirate style!

1382
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:09,812
Emmet, thats it

1383
01:25:17,173 --> 01:25:18,476
Emmet!

1384
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,491
Think positive.

1385
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:24,962
Help me.

1386
01:25:25,818 --> 01:25:28,750
Stay positive. Come on.

1387
01:25:29,344 --> 01:25:30,646
Forget it!

1388
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:39,708
You all need to be more friendly!

1389
01:25:40,967 --> 01:25:44,320
Emmet! Go! Now your chance

1390
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:47,101
She's right!
You Can you it, me Laddy,

1391
01:25:47,102 --> 01:25:48,624
Go on kid get in there

1392
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,807
Sir, we got an intruder.

1393
01:25:58,803 --> 01:26:02,075
Lord Business.
Back from the dead Bruchowsky?

1394
01:26:02,076 --> 01:26:04,931
Well you're too late.
Esqueletrons, get him.

1395
01:26:16,266 --> 01:26:17,235
Can't move

1396
01:26:18,546 --> 01:26:21,446
See your friends?
They are finished.

1397
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,150
My world is almost finished.

1398
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:28,328
The last thing I need to do,
is finish you.

1399
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:32,664
No stop please, if you do one more thing
I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.

1400
01:26:32,665 --> 01:26:35,740
- Your secret weapon?
- Yes.

1401
01:26:35,741 --> 01:26:39,578
It is called
The Power of the Special.

1402
01:26:39,579 --> 01:26:41,382
That sounds dumb.

1403
01:26:41,383 --> 01:26:43,856
Alright? Here it comes.

1404
01:26:43,857 --> 01:26:47,389
My secret weapon Is this.

1405
01:26:48,528 --> 01:26:51,453
What is that? Is it super small,
I don't see anything.

1406
01:26:51,454 --> 01:26:53,941
Its my hand.
I like you to take it.

1407
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:58,001
You want to take your hand off?
No, I want you to join me.

1408
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:01,610
Look at all these things that people built.

1409
01:27:02,029 --> 01:27:03,562
You might see a mess.

1410
01:27:03,563 --> 01:27:09,126
Exactly. And a bunch of weird dorky stuff
that ruined my perfectly good stuff.

1411
01:27:09,456 --> 01:27:11,921
Okay, what I see.

1412
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:15,446
Are people, inspired by each
other

1413
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:17,165
and by you...

1414
01:27:18,042 --> 01:27:21,046
People taking what you made.

1415
01:27:21,047 --> 01:27:23,473
And making something new out of it.

1416
01:27:39,828 --> 01:27:41,860
Finn, did you make all of this?

1417
01:27:44,546 --> 01:27:47,333
Well I tried stop President Business,

1418
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:49,066
from using the Kragle.

1419
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,483
What's the Kragle.

1420
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,697
Its in there.

1421
01:27:57,101 --> 01:27:58,404
This?

1422
01:28:24,593 --> 01:28:26,945
OFF LIMITS

1423
01:28:28,605 --> 01:28:30,326
DO NOT TOUCH

1424
01:28:31,836 --> 01:28:34,211
HANDS OFF

1425
01:28:36,398 --> 01:28:38,052
So...

1426
01:28:38,053 --> 01:28:40,314
President Business
is the bad guy?

1427
01:28:48,244 --> 01:28:49,549
If...

1428
01:28:50,883 --> 01:28:53,281
The construction guy.

1429
01:28:54,564 --> 01:28:56,799
Said something to President Business...

1430
01:29:00,164 --> 01:29:01,554
What would he say?

1431
01:29:08,599 --> 01:29:13,539
You don't have to be.

1432
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:15,901
The bad guy.

1433
01:29:18,352 --> 01:29:21,651
You are the most talented,

1434
01:29:22,574 --> 01:29:24,162
most interesting,

1435
01:29:25,386 --> 01:29:28,617
and the most extraordinary person
the universe.

1436
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:33,527
And you are capable of
amazing things.

1437
01:29:34,253 --> 01:29:37,920
Because you are the special.

1438
01:29:41,345 --> 01:29:42,734
And so am I.

1439
01:29:45,709 --> 01:29:47,268
<i>And so is everyone.</i>

1440
01:29:48,815 --> 01:29:51,128
<i>The prophecy is made up.</i>

1441
01:29:51,662 --> 01:29:53,371
<i>But it's also true.</i>

1442
01:29:54,113 --> 01:29:55,853
<i>It's about all of us.</i>

1443
01:29:56,231 --> 01:29:58,760
Right Now, it's about you.

1444
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:03,562
And you still...

1445
01:30:04,534 --> 01:30:07,454
can change everything.

1446
01:30:31,949 --> 01:30:33,682
We got a hugger.

1447
01:30:36,432 --> 01:30:37,735
Be Careful.

1448
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:41,051
I have been told
it might explode.

1449
01:30:54,077 --> 01:30:56,888
Emmet, thank you

1450
01:30:56,889 --> 01:30:59,959

promise that I will never...

1452
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:18,059
