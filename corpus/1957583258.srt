UM,
SORRY I'M FINE.
I'M JUST...

353
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,910
- HAVE YOU EATEN ANYTHING?
- NO, I'M FINE.

354
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,980
UM, SO,
WHAT'S HE LIKE?

355
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,650
SETH...
WHAT'S HE LIKE?

356
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,250
TYPICAL TEENAGER.

357
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,520
HE LIKES
"MYSPACE", "YOUTUBE",

358
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
"ANNE HATHAWAY".

359
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,560
THAT'S SO FREAKY.

360
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,770
UM...

361
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,840
WELL, I SHOULD LET YOU
GET BACK INSIDE TO YOUR WIFE.

362
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,670
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?

363
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,570
WE'RE NOT MARRIED ANYMORE.

364
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,780

EAT SOMETHING.

A GREAT SPREAD UP THERE.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

THEY HAVE
GOAT CHEESE AND SALMON

367
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,880
AND SOME KIND OF PATE--
I THINK IT'S GOOSE.

368
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,290
BARF ME OUT.

369
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,520

WANT TO GO TO THE TACO BELL

372
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,970
YOU DON'T HANG OUT
IN THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD
MUCH ANYMORE, DO YOU?

373
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
IT'S A STARBUCKS NOW.

374
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,870
A WHAT?

375
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,040
A STARBUCKS.

377
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,710
THEY USE THAT
ENTIRE SPACE FOR COFFEE?

378
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,650
YEAH, MOSTLY.

379
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,320
ALL RIGHT, WELL THEN,
HOW ABOUT SOME COFFEE?

380
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,820
I WOULD LOVE TO...

381
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
BUT I REALLY SHOULD
GET BACK INSIDE

382
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,590
AND FINISH CATCHING UP
WITH SOME OLD FRIENDS

383
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,460
AND THEN I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET HOME

384
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,030
AND SEE HOW MUCH TROUBLE
THAT SETH'S GOTTEN INTO.

385
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,770
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

386
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,010
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO CHECK YOUR ORGANIZER?

387

I ALREADY TOLD YOU,

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,780
THE LAST WEEK IN JULY
SHOULD BE FINE.

389
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,850
OKAY, YOU NEED
TO EITHER COMMIT TO THIS
OR BE STRAIGHT WITH ME.

390

SETH WANTS
TO SPEND THE WEEK A YOU,

391
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,050
BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO SET IT UP

AND HAVE HIM
DISAPPOINTED AGAIN.

393
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,690

TO THROW A MANTRUM.

394
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,360
I WILL
CALL YOU NEXT WEEK.

395
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,860

MONICA, IT WAS NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

OH, AND TELL SETH
I LOVE HIM.

399
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,810
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

400
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,980
YOU SKANK.

401
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,980
BABE, WAIT.
MONICA!

402
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,070
SO, ARE YOU READY
TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW?

403
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,470
I GUESS NOT.

404
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,740
THEY THINK
I HAVE ROCKS FOR BRAINS.

405
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,470
HONEY,

406
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,080
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN?

407
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,880
I MEAN, YOU'RE

408
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,910
- A LIVING MIRACLE.
- THEY THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.

409
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,950
I SHOULD OF
JUST LEFT IT THAT WAY.

410
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,920
CAN WE HAVE
MARGE OVER FOR DINNER?

411
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,760
MARGE?

412
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,430
BEN'S MOM?

413
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,830
SHE WAS GOING TO BE
MY MOM, TOO.

414
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,100
SURE HUN.

415
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,940
I'LL-I'LL CHECK TO SEE
IF SHE'S STILL IN THE AREA.

YOU MEAN, SHE...

417
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,110
I JUST THOUGHT, I MEAN,
I CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND
WHY BEN WOULD KIRK OUT,

418
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,640
BUT I FIGURED
MARGE WOULD STILL BE
IN THE PICTURE.

419
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,610
I THINK
SHE WAS ASHAMED.

420
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,020
I WOULD HAVE BEEN

YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T BLAME HIM.

422
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,450
I DIDN'T.

423
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,020
HE WAS
SO GRIEF-STRICKEN

424
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,190
HE EVEN...

425
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,960
DISAPPEARED FOR A WHILE.

426
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,800
- DISAPPEARED?
- MM.

427
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
HE EVENTUALLY TURNED UP,

428
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,140
BUT HE COULDN'T FACE ME.

429
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,640
I HAD TO GIVE TUESDAY
THE RING TO RETURN.

FOR HERSELF.

DIDN'T YOU KNOW?
THEY GOT MARRIED.
THEY HAVE A KID.

433
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,010
I'M SORRY, HUN.

434
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,120
BUT, YOU KNOW,
TUESDAY WAS A GOOD FRIEND.

435
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,820
SO WAS WALLACE.

436
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,820
WALLACE?
I BARELY EVEN KNOW HIM--

437
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,660
KNEW HIM.

THE GUILT HE MUST'VE FELT

447

00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,790
WELL, HE SHOULD.

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,460
- THAT ANNE HATHAWAY.
-  GET SMART?

528
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,100
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SUCH A BIMBETTE.

529
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,140
OH, NO, NO,
HE'S GOING TO READ IT.

530
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,310
BE A GOOD BREAK
FROM HIS COMPUTER.

531
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,940
"YESTERDAY'S
TREASURE TROVE"!

532
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,150
WHEN DID THEY
STOP SELLING OLD STUFF?

533
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,990
OH, NO WAY!
LOOK! IT'S STILL HERE!

534
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,160
THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE
YOU PICKED ME A POM-POM FLOWER

535
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,590
OFF THAT BUSH.

536
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,160
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY REMEMBER THAT?

537
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,560
I'M AN ELEPHANT.

538
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,000
- [CELL PHONE RINGS]
- OH,

539
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,230
THERE'S ELISE,
RIGHT ON CUE.

540
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,340
YEP, THE MEETING'S
ABOUT TO START.

541
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- HER TEXT.

542
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,840
HER WHAT?

543
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,180
HER TEXT.

544
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,510
NOT A REAL BIG FAN
OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY,

545
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,150
- ARE YOU?
- NO.

546
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,520
OH, THAT'S RAD!
LOOK AT THAT!

547
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,530
I BET
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT YOU DID

548
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,030
- WITH THAT PURPLE FLOWER.
- YEAH, I PRESSED IT

549
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,230
IN THE "COMPLETE WORKS
OF SHAKESPEARE".

550
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,230
AS IN, WILL AND ANNE?

551
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,210
- WHAT'S WITH THE BIG GRILL?
- NOTHIN'.

552
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,280
WHAT?
NO COME ON, TELL ME.
WHAT?

553
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
TELL ME.

554
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,620
JUST KINDA...

555
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,350
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S LIKE...

556
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,220
TIME TURNED BACK
TWENTY YEARS.

557
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,920
SHUT UP!

558
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,130
YOU FEEL IT, TOO?

559
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,030
BEN, I NEED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

560
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,300
UM, I ACTUALLY
ONLY JUST RECENTLY WOKE--

561
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,300
- [CELL PHONE RINGING]
- OH, I'M SORRY.

562
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,240
YOU JUST WHAT?
ONLY RECENTLY...

563
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,570
NOTHING.
THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU.

564
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,510
MM, ACTUALLY,
IT'S ALREADY STARTED.

565
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,080
ELISE, SHE RUNS
A PRETTY TIGHT SHIP.
SHE STEPPED IN

566
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,450
WHEN EVERYTHING
SPUN INTO CHAOS
AFTER MOM DIED.

567
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,190
NEXT TIME,
I'LL PICK YOU
A FRESH FLOWER.

568
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,970
THEY WERE BEING
TOSSED ABOUT IN A LITTLE BOAT

569
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,940
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MERCILESS STORM

570
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,280
AND JESUS
IS SOUND ASLEEP.

571
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,550
"THE DISCIPLES
WENT AND WOKE HIM UP.

572
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,680
"AND JESUS GOT UP
AND REBUKED THE WIND

573
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,280
AND THE RAGING WATERS,
AND ALL WAS CALM."

574
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,290
THAT IS
A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF FAITH AND TRUST.

575
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,960
TO BE
SO COMPLETELY AT PEACE--

576
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,630
THAT YOU CAN
JUST SNOOZE RIGHT ON
THROUGH THE STORM.

577
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,030
IT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE I KNOW.

578
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,700
WAS THAT COMMENT
DIRECTED AT ME?

579
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,640
WHAT?

580
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,580
- THE "SNOOZING" COMMENT.
- NO, AUNT MONICA, IT WASN'T.

581
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,640
SORRY, I'LL TRY
TO BE MORE SENSITIVE

582
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,110
WHEN I MENTION "SLEEP"
IN THE FUTURE.

583
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,390
PAPA JACK
TOLD ME ABOUT BEN'S MOTHER.

584
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,490
I'M SORRY.

585
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,000
I REMEMBER HER
AS BEING A VERY NICE LADY.

586
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,500
AND I REALLY DID
THINK HER SON WAS A PRINCE.

587
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,340
WHEN THE DOCTORS
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU,

588
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,670
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN A DEEP,
MAGICAL SLEEP--

589
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,010
LIKE A STORYBOOK PRINCESS.
BUT I WASN'T WORRIED.

590
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,350
I HAD NO DOUBT
THAT UNCLE BEN WOULD COME
GALLOPING INTO YOUR ROOM

591
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,680
ON A WHITE STALLION,
KNEEL BESIDE YOU,

592
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,150
AND WAKEN YOU
WITH LOVES TRUE KISS.

593
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,590
HE CAME, ALL RIGHT.

594
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,620
HE EVEN KISSED YOU.

595
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,760
LOVE'S TRUE KISS GOODBYE.

596
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,220
Woman's Voice:
HELLO, CARE BEAR.

597
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,150
JENNY.

598
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,690
- YOU LOOK LIKE...
- ONE OF THE  GOLDEN GIRLS?

599
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,430
JUST LIKE MOM.

600
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,530
OH.

601
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,600
BEN BROUGHT ME HERE
THE NIGHT HIS TEAM
CREAMED THE PANTHERS.

602
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,800
SO WHAT
SOUNDS GOOD FOR DINNER?
I'M COOKING.

603
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,370
I GAVE HIM THE NEW
"MILLIE VANILLI" ALBUM.

604
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,410
I HAVE A GREAT RECIPE
FOR LINGUINI AND MUSHROOMS.

605
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,240
BEN LOVES "MILLI VANILLI".

606
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,680
I CAN ADD
LOTS OF CHEESE
IF IT SOUNDS

607
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,350
TOO GROWN UP
FOR YOUR TASTE.

608
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,450
I DO THAT
FOR GRETCH AND TOBY.

609
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,350
YOU KNOW,
PRETENDING HE DOESN'T EXIST
DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE.

610
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,850
OH, YEAH? WELL,
IT DID FOR MANY YEARS.

611
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,490
JENNY,
PUT YOURSELF IN HIS SHOES.

612
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,520
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.

613
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,730
WHAT IF YOU
SUDDENLY FOUND YOURSELF
ENGAGED TO A VEGETABLE?

614
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,830
ENGAGED.
THAT MEANS I MADE
A COMMITMENT.

615
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,360
NOT TO A VEGETABLE.

616
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,530
I JUST
HATE TO SEE YOU REGRET.

617
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,370
I MEAN,
IT MAY BE A  GOOD THING
YOU DIDN'T MARRY BEN.

618
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,870
ANY HARDSHIP
OR CRISIS TO COME ALONG

619
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,440
WOULD'VE
CAUSE BEN TO...

620
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,110
SPLIT?

621
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,850
OR IT COULD'VE BEEN ME.

622
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,190
I BROKE UP WITH BEN
RIGHT AFTER GRADUATION.

623
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,290
WHAT?!

624
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,190
OUR CLASS WAS LIKE ALL AMPED UP
WITH "LIFE IS JUST BEGINNING!"

625
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,730
AND I JUST THOUGHT, LIKE,
A FRESH START WOULD BE WAY COOL

626
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,400
AFTER THIS THREE YEAR
EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.

627
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,770
SO...

628
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,440
HE WAS SO HURT.
BUT HE JUST SAID,

629
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,140
"I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY."

630
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,270
I WAS A DITZ, THOUGH.
A MAJOR DITZ.

631
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,640
'CAUSE I WAS
SO NOT HAPPY WITHOUT HIM.

632
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,910
AND AFTER JUST TWO WEEKS

633
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,320
I WENT BACK TO HIM.

634
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,420
AND HE JUST
PUT HIS ARMS AROUND ME...

635
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
AND DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

636
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
THAT'S LOVE, JENNY.

637
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,670
IF HE LOVED YOU SO MUCH,

638
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,730
WHY DIDN'T
HE CONTACT DAD LATER ON,

639
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,670
JUST TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING?

640
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,440
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO ASSUME
THAT I EITHER, LIKE, WOKE UP

641
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,340
OR DIED A LONG TIME AGO.

642
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,680
BUT HE DID APOLOGIZE
AT THE REUNION.

643
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,280
HOW BIG OF HIM.

644
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,540
AUNT MONICA!

645
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,990
HAVE YOU
TALKED TO ANTHONY LATELY?

646
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,330
NO, NOT FOR AGES.

647
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,900
I HOPE THE REASON
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED BY NOW
ISN'T BECAUSE OF BEN.

648
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,230
BEN? AH, NO,
BEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE

649
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,900
FOR MY STATUS
AS AN OLD MAID.

650
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,440
I STILL BELIEVE THERE ARE
A FEW PRINCE CHARMINGS OUT THERE

651
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,580
WHO WOULDN'T
GALLOP OFF INTO THE SUNSET
WHILE I LAY IN ICU.

652
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,290
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

653
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,990
AH, TELL YOU WHAT?

654
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,390
THAT MY FINGERS
STILL SMELLED LIKE
POPCORN BUTTER

655
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,660
WHEN BEN GALLOPED
OFF INTO THE SUNSET.

656
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,430
I'M GOING
TO GO GET THE LINGUINI.

657
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,630
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

658
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,770
THIS IS JUST A BAD DREAM
AND I'M GOING TO WAKE UP

659
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,610
- ANY MINUTE NOW.
- YOU DID WAKE UP.

660
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,640
THEN IT'S ALL
JUST A JOKE, RIGHT?

661
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,710
ANY MINUTE NOW
GOD'S GOING TO COME DOWN
AND SAY "PSYCH!"

662
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,780
OR ED MCMAHON'S
GOING TO KNOCK ON
THE FRONT DOOR

663
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,680
AND GIVE ME A CHECK
SO I HIRE DOC BROWN

664
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,720
TO BUILD ME A TIME MACHINE
OUT OF A DELOREAN

665
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,620
AND I CAN
GO BACK TO 1989,

666
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,890
AND ALL WILL BE WELL
IN MY WORLD!

667
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,290
THIS IS SO UNFAIR!
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?!

668
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,660
EVERYTHING'S GONE!

669
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,290
MY, MY FUTURE,

670
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,360
MY YOUTH, MY MARRIAGE,
MY CHILDREN--

671
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,330
- EVERYTHING IS GONE!
- IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

672
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,800
OH, YEAH?
HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY
BE ANY WORSE?!

673
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,670
YOU COULD'VE
EMERGED FROM THAT COMA

674
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,470
WITH SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE--

675
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
OR NOT EMERGED AT ALL.

676
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,640
THAT WOULD
NOT BE WORSE.

677
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,850
I'M SORRY, DAD.

678
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,320
BUT INSTEAD OF "PRAISING GOD"
FOR MY MIRACULOUS RECOVERY,

679
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,950
WHY DON'T YOU
GRILL HIM ON THE FACT

680
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,490
HE LEFT ME IN LIMBO
FOR NINETEEN YEARS?!

681
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,490
I MEAN, COME ON!
BE REAL!

682
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,000
OH. OH, I GET IT.

683
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,500
I'M SURE THE TWO OF YOU
SEE SOME GREATER GOOD IN THIS,

684
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,530
SAME AS JENNY,
RIGHT?

685
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,670
LIKE, "PRAISE GOD,
HE DIDN'T LET MONICA
MARRY THAT WUSS."

686
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,670
PRAISE GOD THAT I SLEPT

687
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,780
THROUGH NEARLY TWO DECADES

688
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,510
OF WHAT-WOULD-HAVE-BEEN
A MISERABLE MARRIAGE!

689
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,750
WELL I AGREE!

690
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,620
PRAISE GOD MY EYES ARE OPEN,

691
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,120
I SEE THE LIGHT,
I SEE BEN'S A CREEP,

692
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,390
AND I DON'T EVER
WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN!

693
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,760

LET'S HEAD ON INSIDE
AND HAVE A LOOK.

1553
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:34,730
YOU DID GREAT,
HUN.

1554
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:36,730
Wallace:
OH. OH, MY. WYATT.
YOU'RE UP NEXT.

1555
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:38,070
SOUNDS GOOD.

1556
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,860
HADN'T PLANNED ON
TELLING YOU LIKE THIS.

1557
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:05,760
YOUR DAD CALLED.

1558
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,030
HE TOLD ME
I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH.

1559
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:09,630
HE'S RIGHT.

1560
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:16,040
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME
WHEN YOU WOKE UP?

1561
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:18,110
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
AT THE REUNION?

1562
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:20,380
WE THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

1563
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:23,040
TUESDAY TOLD MY DAD
THAT YOU WALKED AWAY
FROM THE ACCIDENT

1564
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:25,050
WITH A BROKEN ARM.

1565
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,650
YEAH.

1566
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,020
I'M AN IDIOT.

1567
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:33,890
I SHOULDA CALLED YOUR DAD.

1568
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,060
I SHOULD OF
VERIFIED TUESDAY'S STORY.

1569
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:39,660
- I SHOULD OF--
- BEN, PLEASE!

1570
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:41,460
NO MORE "SHOULD OF'S."

1571
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:42,960
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

1572
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,570
THEN...

1573
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:48,940
THEN?

1574
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:53,910
THEN WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE?

1575
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:55,580
I'M NOT SURE.

1576
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,910
I THOUGHT I HAD
EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT,

1577
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,580
AND I KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

1578
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,180
BUT I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
FOR SUPERFICIAL THINGS ANYMORE.

1579
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,760
WAS I A SUPERFICIAL THING?

1580
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,520
HARDLY.

1581
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,100
I FEEL LIKE
I'M TWICE YOUR AGE.

1582
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,630
YOU'RE NOT.

1583
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:28,510
MONICA,

1584
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:30,010
I'VE LIVED
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT IF WE PICK UP

1585
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:32,610
WHERE WE'VE LEFT OFF...

1586
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,050
LIFE'S NOT GOING TO ALL BE

1587
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:36,950
POM-POM FLOWERS
AND WEDDING CAKE.

1588
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,960
I UNDERSTAND.

1589
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,890
YOU'RE SAYING WE MIGHT

1590
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:45,790
COME ACROSS
A FEW  EL GUAPO'S.

1591
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,960
YES.

1592
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:50,870
BUT I THINK
WE CAN TAKE 'EM.

1593
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,620

HE'S DYING TO MEET THE WOMAN

1597
