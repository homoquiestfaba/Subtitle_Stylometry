1
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,390
<i>   - Citizens of Middleton,</i>

2
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:31,594
my many, many supporters...

3
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:35,665
...friends and well-wishers,

4
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,434
today, I commence my first
term

5
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:40,370
as your newly elected mayor.

6
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:43,273
I shall bring the same
dedication to this office

7
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:45,074
as our previous mayor,

8
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:48,844
Ms. Cassie Nightingale...
with perhaps

9
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,848
a tad less mystery. Ha, ha,
ha!

10
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,018
But before we begin
a new era for Middleton,

11
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,821
let us welcome
to the podium

12
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:00,656
a woman who has
given us all

13
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,926
so very,
very much...

14
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:08,997
Our former mayor...
Cassie?! Oh!

15
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:12,401
Why must you always pop up
like that? My heart!

16
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:14,370
- Mine too, Martha.

17
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:16,905
It's so full at
this special time.

18
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:19,442
- What? Oh, yes!

19
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:22,411
Um... Let's start again
from the beginning.

20
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,348
- It is a new beginning.

21
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,850
For both of us.

22
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:31,054
I thought that
rehearsal went well.

23
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:34,323
And thank you for the lovely
tribute, Martha, and for all
the things you did for me

24
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:37,893
when I was mayor.
- Well, it is a big job,
Cassie.
Too much for most women.

25
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:40,295
- If you need anything at
all,
I will be there for you.

26
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:42,532
Now that the kids
are growing up...

27
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:45,801
- Yes, yes, I'll be sure
to keep that in mind.
- Madame Mayor.

28
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,170
We have a problem.

29
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:50,973
- Well, that's why
I was elected!

30
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:54,310
- Your Middleton Botanical
Gardens project...

31
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:56,879
It's going to cost
more than you thought.

32
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,082
- Oh. Well, a thousand
dollars
more here and there is--

33
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:02,985
- $177,000.

34
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:05,488
- What? Are you sure they
didn't
misplace the decimal point?

35
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,657
- Perhaps it's that
waterfall you wanted.
- It's mostly the waterfall,

36
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,193
because the park
is totally flat.

37
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:13,028
- I will raise that money
at our fundraiser

38
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,032
next week.
- Spoken in the spirit
of a true leader.

39
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,601
In honor of your leadership,
Martha,

40
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:22,838
I'd like you
to have this.

41
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,742
It's from my shop.

42
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:29,077
- How very... cute.
- It's a Kachina Doll.

43
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,782
Made by the Hopi Indians.
It's a carving of one
of their old great chiefs.

44
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:34,783
- "Old"?

45
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:37,786
- The Chief will inspire you
to
great leadership and good
will.

46
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:39,688
- Well,

47
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,091
where am I going to put
this lovely little...?

48
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:45,161
Oh, I know! Maybe right in
here,

49
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:48,330
just for safekeeping.
- I'll let you get back to
work.

50
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:51,833
There is one other official
I'd like to thank before I
go.

51
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:56,905
- She was a great mayor.

52
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:58,941
I'm gonna miss her.

53
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:07,749
- Cass! What are you doing
here?

54
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,751
- I just dropped by
to say thank you

55
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:11,453
for all the great things
you did for me when I was
mayor.

56
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:13,455
- What kind of thank you
did you have in mind?

57
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,858
- Hmm...

58
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,362
- It's great to be
appreciated.
Appreciate me more.

59
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:23,966
- I would love to but I've
got
to get back to my shop.

60
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:26,201
- Did you find anybody
to hire yet?
- Not yet,

61
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,537
but I'm sure the right
person
will come along soon.

62
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,806
- I hope so, because
you're going to be busy

63
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:34,676
with Brandon and Tara and
the...
(cell phone ringing)

64
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:37,946
Oh... Martha.
- Oh.

65
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:40,849
- Hello, Martha.

66
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:43,152
Okay. Yeah.

67
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:45,154
I'll be there
in a minute.

68
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:49,524
Her first day as mayor, and
she's already driving me
crazy.

69
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:52,461
What was I saying?
- About Brandon?

70
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,864
It seems like yesterday
he was our little boy.

71
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:58,599
- I know. I know. And now
he's
getting married in four
months?

72
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:04,339
- It'll be here
sooner than we think.

73
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:07,542
how fast she's growing,
already off to school.
- Do you remember her first
day,

74
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:10,779
how excited she was to go?
- And how misty-eyed I was.

75
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:13,582
I didn't want to let her go.
I just wanted to hold her
and hug her forever.

76
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:16,818
- She just walked in there,
head
up, little Miss Independent.

77
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,187
- She never even looked
back!
- Yeah.

78
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,123
And we were a wreck.

79
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,825
- With everyone
doing their own thing,

80
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:26,294
there are times lately
when the house feels so
lonely.

81
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,196
- This family will
always be close.

82
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:30,165
And you know why?
It's because of you, Cassie.

83
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,601
- I shouldn't be
so melancholy.

84
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:34,970
After all,
things change.

85
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:37,138
- For the better.
Like your new haircut.

86
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,778
- Not a chance,

87
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,381
no way! It's not
happening, Martha.

88
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:47,715
- This is the new look
for our police department.

89
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,250
- New? No cop

90
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:52,621
has worn that in 100 years.
- Perfectly in keeping

91
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:55,091
with my new town slogan:
"Moving Forward,

92
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,059
Looking Back".
- Martha,

93
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:59,393
a police uniform
has to command respect.

94
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:02,497
- Not laughter.
- Well, maybe you could--

95
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,433
- Ah, ah, ah! This is
strictly

96
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:06,368
between me and
my Chief of Police.

97
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,172
- I don't understand.
Our uniforms were fine
for every other mayor.

98
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:13,642
- Chief Russell, I am not
"every other mayor".

99
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:17,512
- You can say that again.
- I'm sorry, what did you
say?

100
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:22,551
- I said... nothing,
Madame Mayor.

101
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:47,842
- Grace?

102
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,947
Grace?

103
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,449
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

104
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:57,919
- Hi, Ms. Bryson!

105
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,854
- There you go again.

106
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:05,227
Always popping up out of
nowhere. Just like your
mother.

107
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,028
(knocking)
Come in.

108
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,364
- Grandpa!

109
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:12,032
- Ha, ha, ha!

110
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,035
Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right,

111
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:15,936
Mr. O'Hanrahan.
I had some paperwork.

112
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:19,007
And apparently Grace wanted
to play hide and seek.

113
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,977
- Grace, you can play
when you're at home.

114
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:24,446
When you're at school,
you have to learn your
lessons.

115
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,213
- Why?

116
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,682
- Because that's
what you do at school.

117
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,719
- Actually, I do
encourage the children

118
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:32,988
to play as much as possible.
- You do?

119
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,890
- Yes. Kindergarten is a
place
where learning should be
fun.

120
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:39,059
- But they are learning--
reading? Writing?

121
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,164
- And arithmetic. But the
way we
teach it now is very
different.

122
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,065
- I see.

123
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,735
- Actually, Grace has been
very
interested in numbers
lately.

124
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:51,406
- Ask me a numbers question.

125
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:53,375
- All right.

126
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:55,577
Pretend you have two
cookies.

127
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,879
The teacher takes
one cookie.

128
00:08:57,881 --> 00:08:59,814
I take one cookie.

129
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:01,749
What's left?

130
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:07,421
- Tears.

131
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,691
- Well, she is correct,

132
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:12,092
in a creative kid's
kind of way.

133
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,596
- But 2 minus 2
is still zero.

134
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:16,363
I know teaching methods
have changed...

135
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:19,234
- And I need to change
with the times.

136
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:22,904
- What I need is the
best possible education
for my granddaughter.

137
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:25,240
- And that's exactly
what I'm here for.

138
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:31,246
Grace, honey, I'll see you
in a few days, okay?

139
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:34,382
- How come?
- We're closed for our
Professional Development
Days.

140
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:37,818
- I see.

141
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,254
Grace, come on, sweetie.

142
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:43,024
- Bye!

143
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:14,990
- Hey, Lori. Congrats
on your first article.

144
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:18,158
- Thanks, Jim. Did you like
it?
- Like it? Yeah.

145
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,128
It was great. I really
didn't
have to do any editing at
all.

146
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,864
You've been here a week
and you hardly need me
anymore.

147
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,466
- Well, I'll try to make
more mistakes next time.

148
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:28,235
- I guess you had to do
a lot of research on it.

149
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:31,273
- For online
dating disasters?

150
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,842
I didn't have to any
research,
I'm living it.

151
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:36,610
- Why? I mean, are you
looking for a boyfriend?

152
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,946
- Well, my brother's
wedding's coming up

153
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:41,048
and it'd be nice
to have someone to go with.

154
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,817
- I'm sure you'll
find someone.

155
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:45,886
- Yeah, four months and
ticking.

156
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:48,223
- Well, if there's one thing
I've learned about you
already,

157
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:50,090
you work well on a deadline.

158
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:08,609
- Tibetan finger cymbals?

159
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,378
Let me check
in the back for you.

160
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:16,016
(bells jingling)

161
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,036
The stones are
merlinite quartz.

162
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:39,073
I'll be right
with you.

163
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,045
I have it on order. I'll
call
you as soon as they come in.

164
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:46,380
You're welcome.

165
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:48,617
(ringing)
Pardon me.

166
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:52,152
Brandon. How's it going?

167
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:54,823
- Hey, Cassie. I'm pretty
good.
How are things with you?

168
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:56,991
- Well, at the moment,

169
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:59,193
I have a new
customer.

170
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:02,529
And I have a double batch
of my chicken vindaloo
cooking back at home.

171
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:05,065
- Mm, my favorite.

172
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:07,868
Hey, Tara and I are coming
to visit tonight, along
with her aunt Beverly.

173
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,739
- Oh, what a nice surprise!
- [Yeah.]

174
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:13,540
Tara has this business
conference in town.
So we'll probably be there

175
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,375
[around dinner time. I could
pick up some take-out...]

176
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:19,179
Wait. Didn't you just say

177
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,415
you were cooking a double
batch
of my favorite dish?

178
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:25,085
How did you...?

179
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,986
Thank you, Cassie.

180
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:29,823
- I can't wait to see you.

181
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:35,596
Isn't that precious?

182
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:37,730
You can open it.

183
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:43,838
It's an antique silver set.
- Wow...

184
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,773
Solid silver...

185
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:48,008
Beautiful oak leaf design.

186
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,245
- You know, you're the first
person to ever notice that.

187
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,781
Cassie Nightingale.
- Audrey.

188
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:56,150
I'm Audrey... Bennett.

189
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:59,186
- The same name as the
Boston
company that forged this
silver.

190
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:01,922
- What a coincidence.

191
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:03,490
- Perhaps.

192
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:06,694
Are you here to visit
family?

193
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:10,097
- No, I... don't
have any family.

194
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,500
- I didn't either
when I first arrived.

195
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:14,468
I found my family
here in Middleton,

196
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,703
and I've been here
ever since.

197
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,544
- I have been moving around
a
lot, and that gets lonely
too.

198
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,512
- I know what that's like.

199
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:28,582
But it's, uh, motivation
to make new friends.

200
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,720
- I was looking for
a nice place to settle down,

201
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:34,955
so I did a web search
for "charming towns",

202
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:36,890
and this town,
your town,

203
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,126
came up,
top of the list.

204
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:43,030
- Middleton? What a
coincidence.
- Perhaps.

205
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:55,541
(whimsical music)

206
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,378
What a strange little
bottle.

207
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,914
- Root extract.

208
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,550
Builds confidence
and concentration.

209
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,185
- Do you drink it?
Like medicine?

210
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:09,757
- Aromatherapy. The sense of
smell connects directly
to the brain,

211
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,560
and channels
your chi.

212
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:14,228
Interested?

213
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,829
- Yeah. I've always been
interested in medicine.

214
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,566
I wanted to be
a veterinarian, but,

215
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,668
you know, life.

216
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,805
- It pulls us in
so many directions.

217
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:29,510
- Exactly.

218
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:31,578
- Well, it's on sale.

219
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,848
- I could probably use it,
but the truth is,

220
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,218
what I really need right now
is
a job so that I can pay for
it.

221
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,822
- Hm, well, it is
your lucky day.

222
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:53,734
When can you start?

223
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:56,904
- Uh, first thing tomorrow?

224
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,673
- I'll see you then.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:02,042
This is... just
what I needed.

226
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:04,044
- Me too.

227
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:13,488
What can I do for you,
Martha?
- Upon further reflection,

228
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,389
I have decided to take you
up
on your offer to help
with my fundraiser.

229
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:18,324
- It's very sweet
of you to think of me.

230
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,727
- The event is one week
from tomorrow.
- Oh.

231
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:24,131
- We need to raise $47,000
immediately. Otherwise,
we won't be able

232
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,333
to get our plantings in the
ground before the winter
freeze.

233
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,734
- 47? This morning,
the budget was 177,000?

234
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:31,338
- I managed to whittle
it down by replacing

235
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,273
the waterfall
with a stone fountain

236
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:36,743
modeled on one I discovered
on my trip to Sorrento.

237
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,545
- Looks lovely.
- It is.

238
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,713
It will be. And here's
where you come in.

239
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:42,850
The leader of our
Chamber of Commerce,

240
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:46,486
Adam Berger, is on the
fence,
and I need you to use
your...

241
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,422
"black magic"

242
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:52,025
to get him on our side.
- Martha, it doesn't
quite work that way.

243
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:54,627
And besides,
you didn't need

244
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:57,531
any magic during
your bid for mayor.

245
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:00,367
- Bid.

246
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,369
Bid. We could ask people

247
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:04,670
to bid at a silent auction.

248
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,374
- What a wonderful idea!
- Oh, Cassie, I'm bursting

249
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:10,344
with fresh ideas! I'll go
after the cash donations

250
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:12,446
while you put together
the items for the auction.

251
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:17,316
- Glad to.

252
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:20,721
- Ooh!
(chuckling)

253
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:24,223
- Hmm...

254
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:29,061
Must have left
my keys in the car.

255
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,233
- Thank you.

256
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:35,034
- Do I get a popsicle?

257
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,170
- No popsicles.
We're gonna have dinner

258
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:39,472
as soon as Brandon gets
here.
But maybe you could
draw him a picture?

259
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:52,485
Hey. How was your first day

260
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:56,455
with Martha?
- Very difficult.

261
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:59,693
She wants us to dress
like clowns.

262
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:03,163
- I'm sorry. I...

263
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,398
I hope you don't mind, I
just
can't take you seriously.

264
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,867
(laughing)
- You can't imagine

265
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,370
how hard it is to work
for that woman.

266
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:13,340
- Oh, yes, I can.

267
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:15,908
I agreed to run
her silent auction.

268
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,544
- With Martha, it won't
be very silent.

269
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:21,648
- Walk with me.
I gotta check on my
vindaloo.

270
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,859
- Hey, Lori! Whew,
you are a fast walker.

271
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:37,464
- Well, it's a warm-up
for my field hockey
practice.

272
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,266
- Cool. When's your next
game?
I'd love to watch.

273
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,535
- Uh... cool!

274
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,503
We need the support.

275
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,372
More people show up
to archery than us.

276
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:49,576
- Well, there's nothing
more thrilling than
a bull's-eye, right?

277
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:51,545
- Um, by the way,

278
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:54,246
did you see all the comments
on my online dating article?

279
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:57,149
- Yeah, most of them were
from
guys who wanted to date you.

280
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,887
- Well, I was thinking
I could do a follow-up.

281
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:03,623
- About what?
- Well, go on blind dates

282
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,691
with some of the guys and
then write about the
experience.

283
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,893
- Oh.

284
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:10,363
So you're still looking
for a date to the wedding?

285
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:14,000
- No. Why? Jealous?

286
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:16,836
- No.

287
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:19,472
- 'Cause if you
weren't my editor,

288
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,475
then maybe you could
come with me.

289
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:24,343
Just kidding.

290
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:26,812
- Oh. Well, then maybe
I should resign.

291
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:29,582
I'm kidding.

292
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:33,253
Kidding too.
- Well, I have to get
to my practice.

293
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:36,956
- Yeah.

294
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:42,962
- Oh, I hired someone
for the shop today.

295
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:44,797
- That's good.
Anybody I know?

296
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,565
- No. Her name is
Audrey Bennett.

297
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,169
She's new in town.
- Sounds good.

298
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,605
- Aren't you going to ask me
to run a background check?

299
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:56,075
- A background check. Come
on!

300
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,114
We're partners, right?

301
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:03,616
Every good cop knows he has
to trust his partner.

302
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:07,253
And I trust you.
- 10-4, Chief.

303
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:12,325
(doorbell ringing)

304
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:17,763
- Cassie!
- Beverly, it's so
good to see you again!

305
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:20,399
- Jake!
- Hi! So,

306
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:22,134
where's the future
bride and groom?

307
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:24,303
- They're unpacking the car.
- Let me help.

308
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:27,306
- You look so fresh for
someone
who's traveled such a long
way.

309
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:30,509
- Well, I'm so excited!
- Me too.

310
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:33,446
- We're going to have so
much
fun helping the kids
with this wedding.

311
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:37,216
- I can't wait
to hear some of your ideas.
- My head is spinning with
them.

312
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,886
On the way here, Tara and I
saw an island on the river,

313
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,887
and we thought

314
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,355
perhaps we could ferry the
guests over for a reception?

315
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,926
- Sounds like you both
envision
a fairly grand affair.

316
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:48,294
- Ah, just a thought.

317
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:50,797
(door opening)

318
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,865
- What smells so good?

319
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,835
- That's Cassie's
chicken vindaloo.

320
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:57,970
Feels like I never
left home.

321
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:00,606
- There's the happy couple!
Tara!

322
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:03,243
- Hi!
- So, Brandon,

323
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,810
how's the job going?
- It's terrific.

324
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,513
- Tell them!

325
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:11,083
- The label wants me to be
their
rep for their festival tour.

326
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,586
- Congratulations, Brandon!

327
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,454
- I am proud of you, son.

328
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:18,457
- Isn't that cool? It starts
in just two weeks.
- Yeah,

329
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,759
and it goes nonstop
for six months.

330
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,962
- What about the wedding?

331
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,599
- Um...

332
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,667
Aunt Beverly,

333
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:32,138
we wanted to wait
until we had everyone
together to let you know.

334
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,305
- Know what?

335
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:37,877
- We have to postpone
the wedding.

336
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:54,259
- Hi!

337
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:56,194
Uh, can I help you?

338
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:58,564
- Well, yes.

339
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:01,700
Hello, Officer...
- Please, Derek.

340
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:05,037
- Officer Derek. I'm Audrey.
I'm new in town, on my
own...

341
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,905
- Oh?

342
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:09,408
I mean, oh.

343
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,845
- My new landlord wants
proof
of my prior residence,

344
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:15,681
but my license
has expired.

345
00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:17,949
- He probably just
needs a reference.

346
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:22,054
That's pretty common.
I could help you out.
- Great.

347
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:29,161
The owner of the Bell,
Book & Candle where I work
suggested I come here.

348
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,430
- Cassie.

349
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:32,765
- Yeah.

350
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:35,434
- She usually knows
what she's doing.

351
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:37,069
Um...

352
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:39,138
Well, if you give me
your name and social,

353
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,474
I can probably pull up
your prior address on
some kind of document.

354
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:43,374
- My name is Audrey...

355
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,376
Bennett.
- All right.

356
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:47,479
Bennett.

357
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,118
There's a few
Audrey Bennetts.

358
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,619
What's your social
security number?

359
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:57,756
- You know what? It's okay.
I don't want to trouble you.

360
00:21:57,758 --> 00:21:59,992
- No, no, no,
it's no trouble.

361
00:21:59,994 --> 00:22:02,928
(phone ringing)

362
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:08,934
Uh, sorry.
- Sure.
- Hello,

363
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:11,604
Derek Sanders.

364
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:13,738
Because the uniforms
you gave us

365
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,975
got dirty, Martha.
Madame Martha.

366
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:18,476
Madame Mayor.

367
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:21,780
I sent them out
for cleaning.

368
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:24,382
Uh, five weeks?
- [Five weeks?!]

369
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,886
- Yes. Right away.

370
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,455
Sorry.

371
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:33,591
I'll be right back.
- Sure.

372
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,693
Okay.

373
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,658
- My father's
pocket watch.

374
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,559
And his father's before
that.

375
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,529
I plan to give it
to Brandon

376
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:13,231
on his wedding day.
I found just the chain for
it.

377
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,968
- Wow. Sounds like you guys
are pretty close.

378
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,803
Must be nice

379
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:20,204
to always have someone
you can turn to.

380
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,707
- It's wonderful to have
family,

381
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:26,245
but there are some things
that family members have
a hard time understanding,

382
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:28,681
- Well, that's why
it's great to have a friend

383
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:32,084
you can talk to,
someone who really listens.

384
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:35,820
- I already feel like we can
tell each other anything.

385
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,194
Here, hide the watch.
In that drawer.
- Okay, sure.

386
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:45,496
- Well, hello.

387
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:47,899
Tara, I thought you had
a conference today?

388
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,769
- The keynote speaker got
sick
so it was canceled.

389
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:54,707
- Well, now you have a
little
free time to do whatever
you want before the tour.

390
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:58,576
- And I just thought of
exactly what we could do.

391
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:00,479
Tara, let's
get married.

392
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:04,549
- Right now?

393
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:07,618
- No, no... next Sunday,
before I hit the road.

394
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,921
- That's in eight days,

395
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:14,158
we couldn't possibly...
could we?

396
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,663
- Why not? Cassie and my dad
got married on short notice.

397
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,932
Cassie did it in
no time, like magic.

398
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:23,301
- Well, it was a magical
day.

399
00:24:23,303 --> 00:24:25,069
- We don't have
to go over the top.

400
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:26,871
We can do
something small,

401
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:28,741
casual.

402
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:30,909
The important thing is
we're getting married!

403
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:33,244
- Tara, honey, are you sure
you want to give up

404
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:35,913
all those special things
you've
always wanted for your
wedding?

405
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,849
- Well,

406
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,018
maybe...

407
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,920
- I'll be glad to help,
whatever you choose.

408
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:44,622
- Cassie, don't you have
the mayor's fundraiser

409
00:24:44,624 --> 00:24:47,358
the day before?
- I could help with that,
Cassie.

410
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,860
Whatever you need.

411
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,463
- Let's go for it.
- Okay.

412
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:54,933
Let's go to the cafe right
now
and start making lists.

413
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:57,435
- Okay.
- Cassie?

414
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:59,904
- Oh... The shop.

415
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:01,940
- I'll cover
for you.

416
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:03,474
Not a problem.

417
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:06,945
- Thanks, Audrey.
For everything.

418
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:21,826
- The office looks...

419
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:24,595
different.
- Thank you.

420
00:25:24,597 --> 00:25:27,765
- Who's your decorator,
Marie Antoinette?

421
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:32,402
- Uh, no, sadly
she wasn't available.

422
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:35,306
To reflect a new era
in Middleton leadership.

423
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:38,142
- Cassie is a tough act
to follow.

424
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:40,212
- Back to business,

425
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:41,780
shall we?

426
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:43,548
Ahem!

427
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,018
As you can see, our European
fountain is the focal point

428
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,055
of the Middleton
Botanical Gardens.
- Should bring in the
tourists.

429
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:52,690
- Well, Middleton is getting
a lot of bang for its buck.

430
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,293
And with your leadership
in the business community,
you ought to be able

431
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:57,361
to raise that kind
of money in no time.

432
00:25:57,363 --> 00:26:00,331
- Who's your plumber?

433
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:03,501
- Pardon?
- You can't have
a fountain without water.

434
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:07,139
Or electricity.
- Well, I just assumed

435
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:09,106
that was included in
the cost of the fountain.

436
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:11,709
- First rule of
sound investing.

437
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,644
Never assume anything.

438
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:14,979
- But...

439
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:17,381
- Have another look
at these figures,

440
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:19,485
then get back to me.

441
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:22,219
- But I...

442
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:24,489
But there's so little time.

443
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:34,398
(whimsical music)

444
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,467
- It'd be a huge help if you
could drop by Foster's
Hardware
and grab the garden tools

445
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,270
that he's donating.

446
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:41,373
Great.
And Audrey...

447
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,441
thank you for being there.

448
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:46,244
Okay.

449
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:49,046
- I guess things are
working out with Audrey?
- Honestly, I don't know

450
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:52,350
what I'd do without her.
Especially with Brandon
getting
married on such short

451
00:26:52,352 --> 00:26:55,319
- I'm glad he's found
his soul mate.

452
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:58,923
- How's your article
coming along?

453
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:01,926
- I'm not too sure,

454
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:04,495
about any of it.

455
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,365
But I have my first date
today, so...

456
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,901
who knows?
- You know how it is--

457
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:12,269
you really want someone
in your life, and then,
when you least expect it,

458
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:14,171
there they are.

459
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:17,542
- Well, I hope whoever he is
shows up before the wedding.

460
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,512
- This might help.

461
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,255
- A wood box?

462
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:36,260
- Careful. Don't open it.
You'll expose the film.

463
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:39,096
- It's a camera?
- A camera obscura.

464
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:41,166
- Cool.
- A long time ago,

465
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:44,635
it was owned by a Parisian
photographer who took
candid pictures

466
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:46,202
of couples in love.

467
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:50,875
All you need to do is
wind it three times...

468
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:56,247
...and then find your focus.

469
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:59,984
- Thanks.

470
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,089
Smile.

471
00:28:24,575 --> 00:28:26,911
- Is there a problem,
Officer?

472
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,846
- I thought you promised

473
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:30,849
to call me Derek.
- Oh!

474
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,617
Sorry, right. Derek.

475
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:37,388
It's just that when I see
a uniform, I assume
there's trouble.

476
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,392
- If there's trouble, then
I'm not doing my job right.

477
00:28:41,394 --> 00:28:44,161
Listen, I was thinking,
you being new in town,

478
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:46,463
maybe I could
show you around?

479
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:49,000
- That would be great.

480
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:50,468
- Dinner?

481
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,038
- Sure. I'd love to hear
about your job.

482
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,173
- Well, it's not
that exciting.

483
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:58,442
Parking tickets,
shoplifting,

484
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:01,611
the odd drifter who
gets up to no good, fraud.

485
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:03,313
- F-fraud?

486
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:06,484
- Well, you meet all kinds
of characters.
- Right.

487
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:09,687
- But I always get my man.
Or my woman.

488
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:13,223
Not that I... you know,
I didn't...
- Right.

489
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:16,727
(messaging signal)
- Uh, one sec.

490
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:22,265
Fender bender
at Grove and 3rd.

491
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,300
We'll have to continue
this conversation.

492
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:26,237
On... Tuesday?

493
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:28,806
- Sure. What time?
- Seven?

494
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,841
- Can we make it eight?

495
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:33,743
I'm volunteering at the
South
Street Animal Shelter.

496
00:29:33,745 --> 00:29:37,682
- Eight PM. Maybe there's
a good crime movie.

497
00:29:37,684 --> 00:29:39,917
- Right.

498
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,251
- Boo!
- Oh my goodness!

499
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:17,688
You are so scary!

500
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,624
- I thought we'd
find you out here.

501
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:23,760
- Can I have a cookie?
- Hmm... one.

502
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:27,465
- Two?
- I said... one.

503
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,233
(chuckling)

504
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:31,068
- Bye, Grandpa!

505
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,537
- See you, sweetie.
(thunder rumbling)

506
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,605
I wonder what the weather
is going to be next weekend.

507
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:37,774
- Sixty percent chance
of showers on Saturday.

508
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:40,578
- Well, nothing you can
do about the weather.

509
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,914
- Oh, yes I can.
- Really?

510
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:46,983
- I can order tenting for
the auction in case it
pours.

511
00:30:46,985 --> 00:30:49,887
(chuckling)
(messaging signal)

512
00:30:52,323 --> 00:30:54,658
- It's from Gwen.
- Ah...

513
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,428
- She's spending the week
out west, visiting
our grandchildren.

514
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,629
- Please tell your wonderful
wife we all miss her.

515
00:30:59,631 --> 00:31:02,699
- I can't seem to open
these pictures.

516
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:05,669
- Here.

517
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:08,706
Oh, what a beautiful shot
of those mountains!

518
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,807
Wow!

519
00:31:12,843 --> 00:31:15,678
- These new phones
drive me crazy.

520
00:31:17,516 --> 00:31:19,717
All this moving so fast.
Kids are growing up

521
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,818
so fast these days.

522
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,888
One of these days Grace
won't
even be able to relate to
me.

523
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,023
- Where did you get that
idea?

524
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:29,827
- At her school.

525
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:33,163
The way she's being
taught...
I don't get it.

526
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:35,365
- Well, you can be sure
of one thing.

527
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:38,067
She is learning
whenever you're together.

528
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,938
- Cassie,

529
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,308
her school is not
in session the next few
days.

530
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,844
What do you say I give her
some old-fashioned tutoring?

531
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:50,781
- I think that'd be a great
learning experience.

532
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,816
- Really help Grace

533
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:54,717
get down to the basics.

534
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:58,122
- I meant for the both of
you.
The best teachers

535
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,824
always learn
from their students.

536
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:08,866
<i>   - We think this could be
 fun.</i>

537
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:11,233
Besides, we're just
going casual.

538
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:14,337
- Casual? What happened
to your plans

539
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,042
for an elegant southern
French supper? With your
names

540
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:21,544
stenciled on the napkins.
- Because it's in six days,
Aunt Beverly.

541
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:23,546
- Well, he could
say no to the tour.

542
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:26,216
- It's what he's dreamed of
his whole life.

543
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:30,087
- At least take a week off.
- The tour is a 24/7 job.

544
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:33,690
- What about your dreams,
Tara, hmm?

545
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:36,226
The wedding you've always
wanted
since you were a little
girl.

546
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:38,428
Have you shared those
with Brandon?

547
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:43,199
It's got to be a
partnership.

548
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:45,134
What's best for both of you.

549
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:48,771
- Maybe I will insist
on a sit-down dinner.

550
00:32:48,773 --> 00:32:51,975
- Insist on the wedding
you always wanted.

551
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,749
- Ah, poor Ms. Bryson
thought
she had lost Grace for good
at the petting zoo,

552
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:01,885
and then she found her
riding the goat.

553
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:04,187
- No!
(chuckling)
Oh my goodness,

554
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:05,955
you must have
your hands full.

555
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:09,760
- Yes, Grace is
very fulfilling.

556
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:12,527
- I know it's only been
three days,

557
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:15,231
but this is the beginning
of a lot of things for me.

558
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:16,933
Thanks to you.

559
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:19,270
For all your support.
You have been so great.

560
00:33:19,272 --> 00:33:20,837
- That's what friends are
for.

561
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:23,039
- Friends?

562
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:27,377
From the minute
I walked into Middleton,

563
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,114
I felt... renewed.

564
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:32,181
And...

565
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:33,883
welcome.

566
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:36,519
- This town has a way

567
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:38,755
of welcoming wandering
spirits
and changing their lives.

568
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:40,823
I'm proof of that.

569
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,330
- Cassie!
- Oh!

570
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:48,965
Martha, I had no idea
it was you!

571
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,266
- Hello, Cassie, Audrey.

572
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:52,702
- Hello.

573
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:58,042
- That's a beautiful scarf.
I have one just like it at
home.

574
00:33:58,044 --> 00:34:01,510
- Ahem! You know
what I always say!

575
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:06,916
Uh, loveliness
is like a...

576
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,986
compost for the soul!

577
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:12,087
- Uh, I'm not quite
sure I follow.

578
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:15,258
- How did it go with Adam
and the business associates?

579
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,694
- Not well. In fact,
not very well at all.

580
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:19,730
I thought a change
in style...

581
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:21,731
-your style-

582
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,966
might be able
to raise funds,

583
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:26,235
and my approval rating.
I've raised less than a
$100.

584
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:28,204
You know what? Here.

585
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:31,607
You take it.
And Audrey,

586
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:34,544
could you please get all
of the auction items into
the display case at City
Hall

587
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:37,613
ASAP?
- Certainly. We have
so many great things.

588
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:40,350
- Well, right now they're
our
only hope to raise the
money.

589
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:42,685
- Once people see
these items,

590
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:45,121
they'll be sure to loosen
their purse strings.

591
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:49,359
(cell phone ringing)

592
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:52,829
- Excuse me.

593
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:54,831
Hello, Bruce.

594
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm going to be sending you
a customer. I was wondering

595
00:34:57,002 --> 00:34:59,603
if you could show her some
floral options for the
wedding.

596
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:02,270
- Oh, that wedding!
- I know.
- Five days from now?

597
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,708
I used to be in the wedding
business, and all I can
tell you is--

598
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,310
good luck.

599
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:09,279
However,

600
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,181
speaking of loosening
my own "purse strings"...

601
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:15,018
Please put this
with the auction items.

602
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,787
- Is it worth a lot?

603
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:21,324
- My home decor is more
Chesapeake Bay than Hopi
Indian.

604
00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:38,775
- Hey. Thought you were
on a lunch date.

605
00:35:38,777 --> 00:35:40,809
- I am. Can't you tell?

606
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:45,481
- Where's the date?
- He's running late.

607
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:48,485
By about 35 minutes.

608
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:52,354
Ahem!

609
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:55,925
Can I help you, sir?
- Maybe I can help you
with something.

610
00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:58,861
Your assignment. Why don't
you
let your editor buy you
lunch?

611
00:35:58,863 --> 00:36:00,896
- But what if our lunch
doesn't go well

612
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:02,864
and I write about it?

613
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:06,369
- Okay, well, then
I will take my chances.

614
00:36:06,371 --> 00:36:08,771
- I guess I could go
for a little bite.

615
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:11,707
- All right.
- But I don't want
to spoil my dinner.

616
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:14,209
I've got a date later,
and he seems like a winner.

617
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:17,146
He's into photography,
Thai food, and...

618
00:36:17,148 --> 00:36:20,315
he's pretty cute.
(chuckling)

619
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:22,418
- Right.

620
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:31,593
- Come in.

621
00:36:31,595 --> 00:36:34,030
- Thank you for seeing me,

622
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:36,232
Madame Mayor.
- I like to make myself
available

623
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:38,434
for my constituents,
Mr., uh... Dressel.

624
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:42,370
- Call me Grant. I'm a
marketer,
and I read about your
auction

625
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:46,142
- And you have a
contribution?
- Not exactly, but for
a reasonable price,

626
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:49,712
I can make an online
catalogue
of all the items up for
auction.

627
00:36:49,714 --> 00:36:53,515
- I need to raise
money, not spend it.
- But seeing the items

628
00:36:53,517 --> 00:36:55,585
would really peak interest,
get people to, uh...

629
00:36:57,354 --> 00:36:59,088
...loosen their purse
strings.

630
00:37:01,257 --> 00:37:04,192
- Cassie.
- Pardon?

631
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:06,262
- Nothing.

632
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:09,098
A little voice tells me
that I should hire you.

633
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,935
- I put all the items
in the showca...

634
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:16,371
Showcase. And I locked it.

635
00:37:16,373 --> 00:37:19,809
- Audrey, this is
Grant Dressel.

636
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,943
- Hello.

637
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:26,515
- Hi.

638
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:29,552
- He's going to be making
an online catalogue of
all of our auction pieces.

639
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:32,020
Ooh! Perhaps you could
work with him?

640
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:34,857
- Of course.

641
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,262
Excuse me.

642
00:37:41,264 --> 00:37:43,965
- Now, I should warn you,
we have limited funds,

643
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:46,035
and I'm a tough,
tough negotiator,

644
00:37:46,037 --> 00:37:49,238
so what will the webpage
look
like, and how much will it
cost?

645
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,606
- Yes, if that's
the next one available.

646
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,675
And is it nonstop? Great.

647
00:37:53,677 --> 00:37:56,612
I'll take it. My name?

648
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:02,551
My name is Cassie.

649
00:38:02,553 --> 00:38:05,220
Cassie Nightingale.

650
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,362
- That was a busy morning.
- Yeah, but look at
all we got done!

651
00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:18,301
- Yeah.

652
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:20,268
I love it here.

653
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,170
- Me too.

654
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:24,273
Brings back a lot
of good memories.

655
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,978
- What is it?

656
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,647
- We forgot to order
the embroidered napkins.

657
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:34,550
They're never gonna be
ready in time.

658
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:38,253
- We can use these.
I have extras.
(chuckling)

659
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:41,923
(scoffing)

660
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:43,825
Tara...

661
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,861
what's wrong?

662
00:38:45,863 --> 00:38:49,098
I thought you liked the
casual
wedding idea.
- I do.

663
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,566
But a few traditional
touches would be nice.

664
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:53,535
- Tradition takes time.

665
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:55,670
We have five days.

666
00:38:55,672 --> 00:38:57,940
- I said traditional
touches.

667
00:38:57,942 --> 00:39:01,509
I didn't say a full symphony
with half a dozen
bridesmaids.

668
00:39:05,214 --> 00:39:07,583
What about your wedding
vows?
Have you written them yet?

669
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:10,151
- I thought
I would wing it.

670
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:12,020
- Wing it?

671
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:15,090
Brandon,

672
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:17,392
these are our vows
to each other.

673
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:19,628
For life. How
can you even think

674
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,696
of just saying any old thing
that pops in your head?

675
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:24,200
- I thought that you liked
that I was spontaneous.

676
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:26,168
I thought that was something
that we had in common.

677
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,470
- Well, maybe we don't
have as much in common

678
00:39:28,472 --> 00:39:30,872
as we thought.

679
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:34,109
- Tara.

680
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:36,212
Tara!

681
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:49,025
- OK, "A" is for apple.

682
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:54,296
"B" is for boy.

683
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:59,534
What is the "C" for?
- Swimming.

684
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:02,170
- No. Well, yes, sort of.

685
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:04,139
The sea you're
talking about,

686
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:06,241
the ocean, starts with an
"S".

687
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:11,513
- Ocean starts with an "O".

688
00:40:11,515 --> 00:40:14,583
- How about: "C" is for...

689
00:40:14,585 --> 00:40:16,918
cat?

690
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,723
Grace?

691
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:28,563
- Grandpa!

692
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,600
- Sweetheart...

693
00:40:32,602 --> 00:40:35,170
Pumpkin, you have to take
your schoolwork seriously.

694
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:36,472
- Okay.

695
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:39,473
- School time is learning
time.

696
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:43,211
How'd you like to learn
how to tie that shoe?

697
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:46,481
- I already know.
- Really?

698
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:52,186
(whimsical music)

699
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:54,389
How did you do that?

700
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:56,157
- Ms. Bryson showed me.

701
00:40:57,927 --> 00:40:59,728
- Well, that's a fine job.

702
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,830
- Take a picture, Grandpa.

703
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:04,733
- I think we'd better
move on to numbers.

704
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:07,202
Besides, Grandpa's doesn't
know
where there's a camera.

705
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:10,572
- Please, Grandpa?

706
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:16,711
- My phone is a camera,
yeah.

707
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:23,218
- Your painting is
the perfect auction item

708
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,222
for our new park. No?

709
00:41:26,224 --> 00:41:28,223
Oh, I apologize,
I'd have thought for sure

710
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:30,224
that Audrey would've
picked it up by now.

711
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:32,660
You know what? I'll have it
off
your hands within the hour.

712
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:34,729
Thank you, Mr. Levine.

713
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:45,507
Audrey?

714
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:53,213
Hello?

715
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:25,113
- Derek has a date with her
tonight, and she's not
answering her phone.

716
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:27,650
- Jake, I'm really
worried for her.

717
00:42:27,652 --> 00:42:30,517
- Well, I'll find her.

718
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:34,255
Cassie...

719
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:38,960
I will. I'll find her.

720
00:42:38,962 --> 00:42:41,195
- That's not all.

721
00:42:41,197 --> 00:42:43,731
My great-grandfather's
pocket watch,

722
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:46,134
the one for Brandon.
It's missing.

723
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:48,770
(door slamming)

724
00:42:48,772 --> 00:42:52,206
Martha, Audrey's gone.

725
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:54,041
- Well, that's not
all that's gone.

726
00:42:54,043 --> 00:42:56,644
We are missing every last
auction item from the
display.

727
00:42:56,646 --> 00:42:59,012
- No...
- And I believe

728
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:01,749
that you entrusted Audrey
with the only key.

729
00:43:08,491 --> 00:43:10,424
<i> - Did you have trouble
 getting Grace to bed?</i>

730
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:13,962
- No trouble at all.
Not a care in her world.

731
00:43:13,964 --> 00:43:16,764
I was up in my sitting room,
thinking.

732
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:23,238
- I've checked the airports,
the trains, the buses.

733
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,508
If she is gone, she hasn't
gone far. Not with all
those auction items.

734
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,675
- Well, if we can't find
her,

735
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:30,677
maybe she's lost.

736
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,581
- I need to go back to
the station and review
those surveillance videos.

737
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:36,551
Maybe you should go to the
store
and see if anything else
is missing.

738
00:43:36,553 --> 00:43:38,953
- A friend is missing.

739
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:42,089
- Cassie, a friend?
You hardly know her.

740
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:45,627
- Well, there are some
people
you know really well right
away.

741
00:43:45,629 --> 00:43:48,795
- Like when I met you.

742
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:52,599
- I just want
to find her.

743
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:54,735
- We will.

744
00:43:54,737 --> 00:43:58,106
- Everything's been so rough
for all of us lately,
with you and Martha...

745
00:43:58,108 --> 00:44:00,040
- George...

746
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,976
Grace hasn't exactly
been a model student.

747
00:44:01,978 --> 00:44:04,379
- Lori's feeling down,
and now Brandon and Tara.

748
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:06,414
- Yeah, well,
they'll be okay.

749
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:10,217
- They haven't been
seeing eye to eye.

750
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:12,220
Even if it all comes
together,
there won't be a wedding

751
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:14,188
unless the two of them
are together in spirit.

752
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,425
- They have been under
a lot of pressure lately.

753
00:44:17,427 --> 00:44:21,261
- No, it's more than that.
(door opening and closing)

754
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:23,665
- Dad, Cassie.

755
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:26,401
You got a minute?
- Sure.

756
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:28,269
What is it?

757
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:34,042
- There's... there's no
other
way to say this, but...

758
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:39,413
Tara and I have broken up.
The wedding's off.

759
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,992
- So I used
to date this girl,

760
00:44:50,994 --> 00:44:53,160
and she would always bring
her own salt and pepper
shakers

761
00:44:53,162 --> 00:44:56,029
to restaurants. So when you
put
this on the table, I...

762
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:58,432
- What did you think it was?
- I wasn't sure.

763
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:01,435
Like a box of fried chicken
in case you didn't like
your entree.

764
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:04,005
(laughing)
- Well, I never dine

765
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:05,973
without my camera obscura.

766
00:45:05,975 --> 00:45:08,076
- That's a little weird.

767
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:10,077
But cute.

768
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:14,983
- Care for dessert this
evening?
- Uh, yeah. Definitely.

769
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:17,618
- But first, would you
mind taking our photo?

770
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,587
- Sure.

771
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,960
- You just wind it three
times
and then shoot.

772
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:32,199
- Hold it.

773
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:35,803
Nice.

774
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:39,339
- Thanks.
- I think that's a keeper.
- Lori?!

775
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,976
Hey! I didn't think
I'd find you here.

776
00:45:42,978 --> 00:45:45,045
- Jim, what are you doing
here?

777
00:45:45,047 --> 00:45:47,682
- I was having coffee
with a friend...

778
00:45:47,684 --> 00:45:49,816
of mine.

779
00:45:53,688 --> 00:45:55,822
- Right.

780
00:45:55,824 --> 00:45:59,192
- What, you think I came
here
just to see you?

781
00:45:59,194 --> 00:46:01,762
Hey, thanks
for the latte.

782
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:06,833
Mind if I sit down?

783
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:11,838
- Yeah, uh, sure.
- Thank you.

784
00:46:16,211 --> 00:46:19,179
- Excuse me.

785
00:46:19,181 --> 00:46:20,947
- Where are you going?

786
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,517
- I need to use the ladies
room.
Do you want to follow me?

787
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,286
- No.

788
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:32,626
Hey.
- Hey.

789
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:34,528
- How's it going?

790
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,598
- It was going really well.

791
00:46:40,935 --> 00:46:44,571
<i> - You need to see this
 right away.</i>

792
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:49,376
I put an APB out with every
pawn
shop within a 150-mile
radius

793
00:46:49,378 --> 00:46:51,712
and I asked them for copies
of
their video surveillance
tapes

794
00:46:51,714 --> 00:46:55,515
over the past 24 hours.
- I couldn't believe it
myself
till I saw it.

795
00:46:58,286 --> 00:47:01,421
- OK, Derek, stop
the tape. Zoom in.

796
00:47:01,423 --> 00:47:04,859
(gasping)
- That's Audrey!

797
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:07,160
I knew there was something
off
about that woman.

798
00:47:07,162 --> 00:47:09,162
- She fooled me too, Cassie.

799
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:15,036
- Cassie, are you okay?

800
00:47:16,305 --> 00:47:18,604
- No, I'm not.

801
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:34,988
- Don't worry,
I'll finish by deadline.

802
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,758
- Lori,

803
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,558
do I look worried?

804
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,394
You've never let me
down before.

805
00:47:41,396 --> 00:47:44,064
I mean, you're cutting it
a little close on this one.

806
00:47:44,066 --> 00:47:47,667
- I know. I was hoping
I'd hear from Sean by now.

807
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:50,637
For the article.
- Uh, Sean?

808
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,841
- The guy from the dinner
date
you crashed?

809
00:47:53,843 --> 00:47:56,743
He hasn't called.

810
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:58,945
- Well, I'm sure he will.

811
00:47:58,947 --> 00:48:01,848
- Yeah? What makes you so
sure?

812
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,817
- Are you kidding?

813
00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:05,753
Lori, come on, you...

814
00:48:05,755 --> 00:48:07,853
you're smart.

815
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:09,789
You're so smart,
you're so funny...

816
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,958
- Don't stop. Keep it
coming.

817
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,730
Keep it coming.

818
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:18,298
- So pretty.

819
00:48:21,102 --> 00:48:23,069
And, uh... you have
this certain way

820
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:25,238
that you bite
on your lower lip...

821
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,176
That's the one.
(laughing)

822
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,860
Uh... what were we
talking about?

823
00:48:46,862 --> 00:48:48,460
- My lower lip.

824
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:52,599
- OK. So, I gotta...
I've gotta go scan some
homecoming posters.

825
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:07,813
- What kind of tea was that?
- Lapsang souchong.

826
00:49:07,815 --> 00:49:10,015
You liked it?
- Yeah.

827
00:49:10,017 --> 00:49:14,454
Pretty good.

828
00:49:14,456 --> 00:49:17,258
- From the way you're
looking
into your cup, I thought you
were reading your tea

829
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,059
May I?

830
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:22,395
(whimsical music)

831
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,101
The leaves that are left

832
00:49:28,103 --> 00:49:30,804
form shapes. What do you
see?

833
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:38,410
- I don't know, sticks?

834
00:49:38,413 --> 00:49:40,614
No, bones.

835
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:44,017
- Bones suggest doubt.

836
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:47,254
It's not the rush
or the different plans

837
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:49,188
that have come
between you and Tara.

838
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:53,326
It's doubt.

839
00:49:53,328 --> 00:49:56,596
- I don't want to lose her,
but
if we can't manage a
wedding,

840
00:49:56,598 --> 00:49:59,064
how are we going to manage
a lifetime of marriage?

841
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:01,668
- It's normal to have
doubts.

842
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,104
I have some terrible doubts
of my own right now.

843
00:50:04,106 --> 00:50:09,675
- About me?
- No, no. Someone else.

844
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:12,879
You know, when your father
and I
first announced our wedding,
Brandon, I was so nervous.

845
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:14,648
A free spirit
like me,

846
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,018
marrying a policeman?
How was that ever gonna
work?

847
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,386
- But it did.

848
00:50:23,224 --> 00:50:25,225
It's just, the music
business
is intense, and...

849
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:28,962
I want to give 100%
to my job and 100% to Tara.

850
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:31,697
It doesn't add up.

851
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:35,402
- Your problems aren't
doubled
when you get married.

852
00:50:35,404 --> 00:50:38,337
With the right partner,
they're cut in half.

853
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:43,543
- I love her, Cassie.

854
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,478
- Then the two of you
can do things

855
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,814
you never dreamed
possible, with love.

856
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:55,422
<i>  - Based on the transaction
 pattern,</i>

857
00:50:55,424 --> 00:50:59,024
she's working her way north.
That could take her

858
00:50:59,026 --> 00:51:01,828
through Chester,
and we're working with
the sheriff there, so...

859
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,830
- Nothing else?

860
00:51:03,832 --> 00:51:05,765
- We've recovered
her fingerprints

861
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:08,300
off of every item from the
auction, and matched them

862
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:10,636
to the fingerprints of hers
taken from your shop.

863
00:51:10,638 --> 00:51:13,239
Other than that,
it's all I know.

864
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,208
- Jake, I'm sorry to ask
so many questions,

865
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,109
but you've gotta
find a suspect.

866
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:19,279
I've lost a friend,
and I miss her.

867
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:21,814
- You miss her? After
what she's done to you,

868
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:25,018
to this town?
You know, I found out

869
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,086
Bennett isn't
her real last name.

870
00:51:27,088 --> 00:51:30,156
- Jake, Cassie Nightingale
wasn't my real name either.

871
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:33,459
- I know you want to give
Audrey
the benefit of the doubt,
but I'm a cop.

872
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:35,595
I have to follow
the evidence.

873
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:39,031
And I have to file
all these status reports

874
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:42,268
because Martha keeps
checking in
with me every minute.

875
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:45,137
That's why I wanted to come
for lunch, just so I could
get away from her.

876
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:48,741
- That does
sound like a problem.
- You know what the problem
is?

877
00:51:48,743 --> 00:51:51,110
The problem is
you trusted Audrey.

878
00:51:51,112 --> 00:51:52,946
And of course, I trusted
you.

879
00:51:52,948 --> 00:51:55,048
And then Audrey
robbed us blind,

880
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:57,282
and now Martha doesn't trust
me.

881
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,785
- Just give it time.

882
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:03,356
- We are just from
two different planets.

883
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:05,225
- Kind of like the two of
us.

884
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:07,559
Sometimes,

885
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:11,730
opposites attract.
It's the law of magnetism.

886
00:52:11,732 --> 00:52:15,068
(cell phone ringing)

887
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,935
Ah, ah, ah...

888
00:52:19,173 --> 00:52:22,641
Martha. Again!

889
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:33,085
- Hey. Take this in.

890
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:35,020
We should get a lot for it.

891
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:37,756
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

892
00:52:37,758 --> 00:52:41,561
You can, and you will.

893
00:52:41,563 --> 00:52:43,329
- Look, it's bad enough
that you forced me to steal

894
00:52:43,331 --> 00:52:45,030
those auction items,
but this is...

895
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:48,901
this is Cassie's watch. I
can't.
I can't do that to her.

896
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,104
Haven't I paid you enough?

897
00:52:52,106 --> 00:52:54,274
- No.

898
00:52:54,276 --> 00:52:56,874
You stole from me.

899
00:52:56,876 --> 00:52:58,811
I could file charges.

900
00:52:58,813 --> 00:53:00,779
- Those things I took

901
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:02,815
from the house, they...
they were mine.

902
00:53:02,817 --> 00:53:04,984
You promised me

903
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:07,586
that if I stole those
showcase
items and gave you the
money,

904
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:09,788
you would let me go.

905
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,924
- What makes you think

906
00:53:11,926 --> 00:53:13,992
that I will ever let you go?

907
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:18,964
Either you come home with
me,

908
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:21,667
or I'll have the police
throw
you in jail where you
belong.

909
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:23,869
- Why can't we just end
this?

910
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,139
- Because you're my wife.

911
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:28,740
And don't get any ideas
about
running to your friend
Cassie.

912
00:53:28,742 --> 00:53:32,612
I know how to deal with her
as
well. Did you really think
that

913
00:53:32,614 --> 00:53:35,881
All I had to do was look in
your
computer's cache. It was
loaded

914
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:38,417
- Please...
- Now you're wanted
in Middleton too.

915
00:53:38,419 --> 00:53:40,552
You've got a choice.

916
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:42,489
Either you go to prison,

917
00:53:42,491 --> 00:53:44,991
or you stick
with me,

918
00:53:44,993 --> 00:53:47,091
like a good little girl.

919
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:54,968
I'll protect you.

920
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,069
- Okay.

921
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:02,074
You win.

922
00:54:31,204 --> 00:54:33,439
- Audrey! Get back here!

923
00:54:38,444 --> 00:54:42,181
You can't run fast enough,
Audrey!

924
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:44,851
You know I'll find you!

925
00:55:13,846 --> 00:55:16,882
- Hello, Audrey.

926
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:18,917
- I'm sorry, Cassie.

927
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:23,956
You've been such
a good friend to me,

928
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:26,357
and I've let you down.

929
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:28,560
- Audrey, seeing you here

930
00:55:28,562 --> 00:55:30,929
has brought me
right back up again.

931
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:36,100
- Here.

932
00:55:36,102 --> 00:55:39,104
I was about
to pawn it,

933
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:41,473
but I couldn't do it,

934
00:55:41,475 --> 00:55:43,408
not to you.

935
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,978
- Thank you for keeping it
safe.

936
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,146
I was worried.

937
00:55:49,148 --> 00:55:52,284
- I never let it
out of my sight.

938
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:55,121
- I meant worried about you.

939
00:55:58,024 --> 00:56:00,291
- Don't be.

940
00:56:00,293 --> 00:56:09,701
I'm going someplace
that I can be safe.

941
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,005
- Hi, Audrey.
It's nice to see you again.

942
00:56:13,007 --> 00:56:15,340
- I'm sorry, Derek.

943
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:24,116
Chief Russell,

944
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:27,184
I stole the auction items
from the showcase.

945
00:56:27,186 --> 00:56:29,988
- Audrey, don't say any
more.
You know, you have the right
to an attorney.

946
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:33,592
- I don't want one. I came
back
to confess everything.

947
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:36,327
- Audrey, I haven't
known you long,

948
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:38,229
but I hope I know you well.

949
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,599
And you're not
telling us something.

950
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:44,236
- I pawned all I could
for cash.

951
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:47,004
But I came back,

952
00:56:47,006 --> 00:56:48,873
because of you.

953
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:51,843
- Well, you're doing the
honorable thing, Audrey,

954
00:56:51,845 --> 00:56:54,846
but... these are
serious charges.

955
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:57,716
- I know. It's only right
I get what I deserve.

956
00:56:57,718 --> 00:57:01,353
- Well, that'll be for our
judge
to decide, and he's not
available until tomorrow,

957
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:03,221
so until then,
I have no choice--

958
00:57:03,223 --> 00:57:05,223
Derek.

959
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:15,534
Could you place Audrey
in custody, please?

960
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:17,902
- Come on.

961
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:24,743
- I can't help but feel
she deserves better.

962
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:27,845
- Maybe so, but...

963
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:30,816
it doesn't look good.
- No, it doesn't.

964
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:34,152
- Maybe you didn't know her
as well as you thought you
did.

965
00:57:34,154 --> 00:57:36,454
- Perhaps I should get

966
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,190
to know her better.

967
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:44,596
- Jim?

968
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:46,832
We need to talk.
- I know.

969
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:49,600
I crossed the line
and I shouldn't have.
- It's about Sean.

970
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:51,937
My date. I just got
an email from him.

971
00:57:51,939 --> 00:57:54,272
- Oh.
How's that going?

972
00:57:54,274 --> 00:57:56,407
- Not well.
- Why not?

973
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:59,343
I made him think I was only
on
the date for the article,
and not because

974
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:01,912
I actually liked him.
- Okay, Lori, I--
- And I know why.

975
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:04,916
You thought the article
would be
more interesting if the
dates

976
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:08,186
- No, Lori, that's--
- And the worst part is
you acted like you liked me.

977
00:58:08,188 --> 00:58:10,422
- Lori, I do like you!
- You kissed me,

978
00:58:10,424 --> 00:58:12,623
and then you turned
and walked away.

979
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,726
- No. No, there's more than
that. You don't understand--
- No, I get it. I got it.

980
00:58:15,728 --> 00:58:18,763
And this time,
I'm walking away.

981
00:58:35,314 --> 00:58:37,815
(bells jingling)

982
00:58:42,488 --> 00:58:44,890
- I'm sorry to hear
about Audrey.

983
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:47,325
- I'm just relieved she's
okay.

984
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:49,293
How about you? Are you okay?

985
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:53,131
- I've been better.

986
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:56,000
But just I wanted to thank
you
so much for all your hard
work.

987
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:58,336
I'm sorry it's all
gone to waste.

988
00:58:58,338 --> 00:59:00,938
- Nothing we do in life
is ever wasted.

989
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,075
Even the worst things can
lead
to something better.

990
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:06,577
- I wish I could believe
that,

991
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:08,814
but right now...

992
00:59:08,816 --> 00:59:11,550
- You're being
pulled apart.

993
00:59:11,552 --> 00:59:14,486
- By Brandon and Aunt
Beverly,

994
00:59:14,488 --> 00:59:18,122
the two people I care about
most, and... it hurts.

995
00:59:20,693 --> 00:59:22,794
- Sometimes, when Jake
and I have troubles,

996
00:59:22,796 --> 00:59:25,196
I go to a quiet place and
remember how it all began.

997
00:59:25,198 --> 00:59:27,998
All the reasons
we fell in love

998
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,603
and all the reasons we love
each other now more than
ever.

999
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:35,840
- It's hard to remember
the good memories right now.

1000
00:59:35,842 --> 00:59:40,010
- Then that's the best time
to make new ones.

1001
01:00:05,537 --> 01:00:09,708
I brought you some of my
homemade almond cookies
dipped in chocolate.

1002
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:12,810
I call them Harvest Moons.
I think you'll like them.

1003
01:00:12,812 --> 01:00:14,712
We have similar tastes.

1004
01:00:14,714 --> 01:00:17,448
- Thank you, Cassie.

1005
01:00:19,751 --> 01:00:21,653
- How long have you
been running?

1006
01:00:21,655 --> 01:00:24,788
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1007
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:28,893
- Audrey, I came here to
listen.

1008
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:34,266
- A long time.

1009
01:00:34,268 --> 01:00:36,100
And I'm tired of running.

1010
01:00:36,102 --> 01:00:38,936
- That's why you're here,

1011
01:00:38,938 --> 01:00:41,772
safe but lonely.

1012
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,877
- I married Grant.

1013
01:00:46,879 --> 01:00:49,680
He was such a great guy
at first.

1014
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:55,019
But then he started telling
me
who I could see,

1015
01:00:55,021 --> 01:00:56,954
and where
I could go.

1016
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:59,624
Eventually he didn't
want me going anywhere,

1017
01:00:59,626 --> 01:01:01,725
and when I did, he got very,

1018
01:01:01,727 --> 01:01:04,128
very angry.

1019
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,097
So, I went out
anyway.

1020
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:09,133
Far away
as I could go.

1021
01:01:09,135 --> 01:01:12,470
I tried to change my name
and...

1022
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,206
He found me.

1023
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:20,144
He always
finds me.

1024
01:01:20,146 --> 01:01:23,949
I wish I could just
disappear.

1025
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:31,789
- But then I wouldn't be
able to see you.

1026
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:35,259
- The reason that I stole
those things is because
he threatened me,

1027
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:37,327
and you.

1028
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:41,065
He promised me a way out.

1029
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:42,967
He lied.

1030
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:45,769
- You need to tell Jake
everything you just told me.

1031
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:48,372
- The police do not see that
side of him. They are no
help.

1032
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:51,542
- Jake will help. We all
will,
working together.

1033
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:53,444
- You don't understand,
Cassie.

1034
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:55,846
He's a dangerous man.
He will come after me.

1035
01:01:55,848 --> 01:01:57,648
He always does.
No matter where I go,

1036
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,117
he finds me, and he will
come
after you and your family

1037
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,953
if you get in his way.
- I'm not afraid.

1038
01:02:02,955 --> 01:02:06,256
- I won't take that chance.

1039
01:02:06,258 --> 01:02:08,192
I'm safer here.

1040
01:02:08,194 --> 01:02:12,731
We all are.

1041
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:15,098
I've done enough damage.

1042
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,267
- Not to me.

1043
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:20,070
Just the opposite. Audrey,

1044
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:23,608
I'm better for
knowing you. A friend

1045
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:27,377
is someone who understands
you,
who listens to you.

1046
01:02:27,379 --> 01:02:30,748
Someone who is there for
you.
You were all those things
for me

1047
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,852
this past week. I just
hope you'll let me

1048
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:37,154
repay the favor.
One friend to another.

1049
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:43,894
Hang in there.
It's gonna get better.

1050
01:03:07,752 --> 01:03:10,688
(whimsical music)

1051
01:03:19,464 --> 01:03:21,465
- Yoo-hoo!

1052
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,802
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Dressel!

1053
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:29,173
I have to apologize for
canceling your catalogue.
- No harm done.

1054
01:03:29,175 --> 01:03:31,208
- Oh, I wish that were true.

1055
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,911
- I'm really sorry
about your fundraiser

1056
01:03:33,913 --> 01:03:36,113
and your park.

1057
01:03:36,115 --> 01:03:38,881
It was really nice
having met you.

1058
01:03:38,883 --> 01:03:42,686
- And to think we had all
the money we needed all
along.

1059
01:03:42,688 --> 01:03:46,223
- How so?

1060
01:03:46,225 --> 01:03:48,959
- One of the items that was
stolen, that little wooden
doll?

1061
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:50,960
Mr. Tyler,

1062
01:03:50,962 --> 01:03:54,131
our museum curator, saw all
of
the auction items when they
were

1063
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:56,633
It's a Kachina Doll.

1064
01:03:56,635 --> 01:03:58,001
- So?

1065
01:03:58,003 --> 01:04:01,271
- A hand-carved Hopi
Indian Kachina Doll.

1066
01:04:01,273 --> 01:04:03,040
Apparently
a rare one.

1067
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,675
He says it could be
worth up to $50,000.

1068
01:04:05,677 --> 01:04:08,245
Of course, Cassie had no
idea.
And now it's gone,

1069
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:11,215
likely forever.
Can you imagine?

1070
01:04:11,217 --> 01:04:13,251
$50,000
would have paid

1071
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:16,786
for all of the Middleton
Botanical Gardens.

1072
01:04:33,505 --> 01:04:35,539
- Brandon.

1073
01:04:38,443 --> 01:04:40,777
- Tara?

1074
01:04:40,779 --> 01:04:42,679
How'd you know I was here?

1075
01:04:42,681 --> 01:04:45,448
- I didn't.

1076
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:48,352
I was just thinking about
what Cassie told me, and...

1077
01:04:48,354 --> 01:04:50,820
I don't know,
I just...

1078
01:04:50,822 --> 01:04:53,390
wanted to go to a quiet
place
and think about us,

1079
01:04:53,392 --> 01:04:55,591
how this
all started.

1080
01:04:55,593 --> 01:04:59,129
Then I remembered
it all started here.

1081
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:02,865
- This is where
I proposed to you.

1082
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:08,705
- Sorry, did I interrupt
your phone call?

1083
01:05:10,475 --> 01:05:13,210
- I was about to call
the music company.

1084
01:05:13,212 --> 01:05:15,711
I'm going to walk away
from this tour.

1085
01:05:15,713 --> 01:05:19,348
- You can't
give that up.

1086
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:22,653
Brandon, every time
you talked about that
job, you were so excited.

1087
01:05:22,655 --> 01:05:24,487
- I was more
excited about us.

1088
01:05:24,489 --> 01:05:26,356
About starting
our lives together.

1089
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:30,059
That's why I wanted
to rush this wedding.

1090
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:35,765
The tour means nothing
to me without you.

1091
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,468
- Are you sure?

1092
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,805
- I've never been more sure

1093
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,874
about anything in my life.

1094
01:05:50,849 --> 01:05:53,550
Tara,

1095
01:05:53,552 --> 01:05:55,852
will you marry me?

1096
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:16,439
Tara, if you want a more
traditional wedding,

1097
01:06:16,441 --> 01:06:20,176
I'll find some way to do it.
Even in a day and a half.

1098
01:06:21,946 --> 01:06:24,680
I'll do it.

1099
01:06:24,682 --> 01:06:29,252
- I think as long
as we're together,

1100
01:06:29,254 --> 01:06:32,222
we can do anything.

1101
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:44,367
- I'm glad the wedding's
back on.

1102
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:45,968
It'll be fun.

1103
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,870
Even if I do go alone.

1104
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,741
- You'll find him, Lori.
- Who?

1105
01:06:51,743 --> 01:06:54,143
- The right one.

1106
01:06:54,145 --> 01:06:55,878
- Yeah, but when?

1107
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,813
- You just have to picture

1108
01:06:57,815 --> 01:06:59,816
that it will all work out.

1109
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:02,619
- Oh, that reminds me.

1110
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:05,621
My pictures for the article.
I have to pick them up
from the lab tomorrow.

1111
01:07:13,698 --> 01:07:15,897
- Oh, hello,

1112
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:17,867
Mr. O'Hanrahan. How is Grace

1113
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:20,436
enjoying her break?
- I decided to use the time

1114
01:07:20,438 --> 01:07:23,106
to go over a few
of the basics with her.

1115
01:07:23,108 --> 01:07:26,609
- I bet she enjoyed that.
- I'm not so sure.

1116
01:07:26,611 --> 01:07:31,914
- Well, Grace is a very
loving
child, and eager to learn.

1117
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,350
She gets it from her
parents.

1118
01:07:34,352 --> 01:07:37,553
- Not just her parents.
Let me show you something.

1119
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,094
Here.
- Grace drew this?

1120
01:07:45,096 --> 01:07:47,196
- Mm-hmm.

1121
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:51,168
- Is that supposed to be me?

1122
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:53,302
- She has a very high
opinion of you.

1123
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,040
- I'm in a lot of these.
- Mm-hmm.

1124
01:07:58,042 --> 01:08:01,144
Fishing, hiking,
fixing her bike.

1125
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,380
- I had no idea.

1126
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:09,018
- Looks like you've shared
a lot of things she thinks
are worth drawing.

1127
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,120
And I have a feeling
you will always be

1128
01:08:11,122 --> 01:08:13,156
a big part of her life.

1129
01:08:13,158 --> 01:08:15,725
- Thanks for these.

1130
01:08:15,727 --> 01:08:18,561
- Don't thank me,
thank the artist.

1131
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:22,499
- You know, I only want
what's best for her.

1132
01:08:22,501 --> 01:08:24,667
- Of course, so do I.

1133
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:27,336
- You know, your method,

1134
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:29,438
with fun and freedom,

1135
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,176
is what's best
for her right now.

1136
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:37,813
- I found out that
she learned a lot from you.

1137
01:08:37,815 --> 01:08:41,550
- Well, the best teachers
are always learning
from their students.

1138
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:46,856
- Funny. That's exactly
what her mother told me.

1139
01:08:46,858 --> 01:08:50,260
Cassie.

1140
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:02,506
- Come in.

1141
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:08,177
- You must be the curator.
- Yes.

1142
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:11,981
- Grant Dressel.
- Hi.

1143
01:09:11,983 --> 01:09:15,251
- Thanks for agreeing
to see me on a Saturday.
- Did you bring it?

1144
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,992
Oh...

1145
01:09:22,994 --> 01:09:24,693
oh my...

1146
01:09:24,695 --> 01:09:27,430
- Yes?
- Yes, indeed.

1147
01:09:27,432 --> 01:09:30,866
It's authentic. You can tell
that it's been carved

1148
01:09:30,868 --> 01:09:34,570
from a single
block of wood.

1149
01:09:34,572 --> 01:09:37,006
- How much do you
think it's worth?

1150
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,577
- I'd say 15 to
20 years in jail.

1151
01:09:40,579 --> 01:09:42,912
You're under arrest.

1152
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,316
Great job, thank you.

1153
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:03,833
- This week has been
a blur all right.

1154
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,485
Hey, it's Lori. Is Jim
there?

1155
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:29,125
Are you kidding? When?

1156
01:10:29,127 --> 01:10:32,194
But why would he quit?

1157
01:10:32,196 --> 01:10:45,006
Yeah.

1158
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,576
- What a glorious
turn of events.

1159
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:49,812
- I can hardly believe it.
- Well,

1160
01:10:49,814 --> 01:10:52,816
there's one person who never
stopped believing in me...

1161
01:10:52,818 --> 01:10:54,949
- A lot of people here
played a part.

1162
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:57,453
- Especially Martha.

1163
01:10:57,455 --> 01:10:59,221
Job well done,
Madame Mayor.

1164
01:10:59,223 --> 01:11:01,957
- I could say
the same about you.

1165
01:11:01,959 --> 01:11:05,693
Oh, and I will.
Very well done, Chief.

1166
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:09,798
I must say that it was a
very
clever scheme on my part.

1167
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,801
(chuckling)
Our part.

1168
01:11:12,803 --> 01:11:14,637
- You know,

1169
01:11:14,639 --> 01:11:17,339
despite your differences,
you two really came together
on this one.

1170
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:20,142
- We sure did. We were like
a magnetic force.

1171
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,378
Who'd a thought?

1172
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:26,448
- When Martha told Grant
that the Kachina Doll
was worth 50 grand,

1173
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,717
we knew he couldn't resist.

1174
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,153
- But weren't you worried
that
he would make off with it?

1175
01:11:31,155 --> 01:11:33,688
- Audrey, this doll Cassie
gave me is a flawed replica.

1176
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:37,293
Cute, but worth less than
$15.
- I'd say it was worth

1177
01:11:37,295 --> 01:11:39,461
more than that.
It put Grant behind bars,

1178
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:41,564
and it bought
Audrey her freedom.

1179
01:11:41,566 --> 01:11:45,533
- And now you can have
your auction.
- We will,

1180
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:47,503
but obviously not today.
Gentlemen, come with me.

1181
01:11:47,505 --> 01:11:50,573
I want to take official
inventory of all that
we've recovered. Come on.

1182
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,549
- I don't know what to say.

1183
01:12:00,551 --> 01:12:02,585
- You don't have to say a
thing.

1184
01:12:02,587 --> 01:12:05,621
That's the beauty of real
friendship. You just know.

1185
01:12:05,623 --> 01:12:07,622
- Still,

1186
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:09,925
if there's anything
I can do for you, Cassie...

1187
01:12:09,927 --> 01:12:12,094
- There is. There's lots to
do.

1188
01:12:12,096 --> 01:12:14,495
My son is getting
married tomorrow.

1189
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,765
(laughing)

1190
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:27,309
- Jim?
(laughing)

1191
01:12:27,311 --> 01:12:29,678
- You found me.
- I figured it was you

1192
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:33,281
hiding behind Edgar Allan
Poe.
- Yeah, well, like they
said,

1193
01:12:33,283 --> 01:12:35,250
he was the master
of suspense.

1194
01:12:35,252 --> 01:12:37,186
- And romanticism.

1195
01:12:37,188 --> 01:12:40,122
- Did you know he was
actually
a really good journalist?

1196
01:12:40,124 --> 01:12:42,523
- Hm!
- Just like you.

1197
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,893
- I guess I have a knack
for finding a good story.

1198
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:51,000
You know, you didn't have
to quit the paper.

1199
01:12:51,002 --> 01:12:53,334
- Yeah, I did.

1200
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:56,471
- Well, I want you to
reconsider, because
you're a great editor,

1201
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:58,806
even though we've had
our problems recently--
- Lori,

1202
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,610
I didn't crash your dates in
the
hopes of getting a better
story.

1203
01:13:01,612 --> 01:13:05,281
I didn't.

1204
01:13:05,283 --> 01:13:08,583
I did it because I like you.
- That's a funny way to show
it.

1205
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:11,520
- No, like, I really like
you.

1206
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:16,992
A lot.

1207
01:13:16,994 --> 01:13:19,961
- Well, I really
like you. A lot.

1208
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:24,732
- That's why I quit.

1209
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,671
Editors can't date

1210
01:13:28,673 --> 01:13:32,273
their writers, so...

1211
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:35,209
I thought maybe if I gave up
being editor, hopefully...

1212
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:37,712
maybe I could be
your date at the wedding?

1213
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:40,115
- My date?

1214
01:13:40,117 --> 01:13:42,051
That's not what I want.

1215
01:13:42,053 --> 01:13:44,218
- Oh...

1216
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,454
It's not?

1217
01:13:46,456 --> 01:13:48,523
- No.

1218
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:50,626
I want you to be
my boyfriend.

1219
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:05,273
(people chattering)

1220
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:25,059
- George, I'm really sorry
Gwen couldn't make it.

1221
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:27,830
- With one day's notice,
all the flights were booked.

1222
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:29,865
But that's okay...

1223
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:32,866
I'm recording it
for her on my phone.

1224
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,436
This new technology
is unbelievable.

1225
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,876
- But seriously, I mean,

1226
01:14:40,878 --> 01:14:44,144
who'd have thought something
as strange as a camera
obscura

1227
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:47,915
would've brought us
together?
- Cassie thought it.

1228
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:53,054
- Oh, Cassie.

1229
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:56,591
You've been right all along.
Look at all the happy faces.

1230
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:59,427
- With a loving aunt like
you,
Tara could never be
disappointed.

1231
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:02,797
- Well, she did get the
wedding
she always wanted,

1232
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:06,334
after all, because she's
marrying the perfect guy.

1233
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:08,536
Oh, excuse me.

1234
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,273
I have a short walk to take.

1235
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,748
Oh, you look so happy.

1236
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,317
I couldn't ask
for anything more.

1237
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:25,720
Shall we?
- Yes.

1238
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,926
- Aw...

1239
01:15:30,928 --> 01:15:35,129
(wedding music)

1240
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,675
- Nice boots.

1241
01:16:19,677 --> 01:16:22,042
- Yours too.

1242
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:34,087
- You're being a very good
girl.
- I know.
(laughing)

1243
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,324
- Dearly beloved

1244
01:16:36,326 --> 01:16:39,360
friends, family
and well-wishers.

1245
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:41,863
We are gathered together
to celebrate the marriage

1246
01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:43,831
of Tara and Brandon.

1247
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,966
Isn't it amazing

1248
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,768
how the good people
of Middleton never fail

1249
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,204
to rise to the occasion
and come together

1250
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:52,306
just when we need
each other most?

1251
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:54,342
In fact,

1252
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:56,910
it reminds me of
my own wedding, actually,

1253
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,247
on a summer afternoon
right here in Middleton
when--

1254
01:16:59,249 --> 01:17:02,382
- Excuse me, Martha.

1255
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:05,753
Could I say something?
- Yes, yes, of course.
I'm so sorry. Go.

1256
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,360
- Your vows?

1257
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,263
- Yeah.

1258
01:17:15,265 --> 01:17:17,198
- I thought you were
going to wing it.

1259
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,768
- I've been thinking about
it
since the day I met you.

1260
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:28,776
Tara, from the
first moment we met,

1261
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:31,413
I knew you were
someone special.

1262
01:17:33,614 --> 01:17:36,551
It was magic that
brought us together.

1263
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:45,525
And since then,

1264
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,728
the times we've spent
together

1265
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,797
have been the best
times of my life.

1266
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,568
We're standing on
almost the exact spot

1267
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,336
where I proposed to you
that summer night.

1268
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:59,106
And it feels
so right

1269
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:02,709
to stand here again,
sharing our vows,

1270
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:05,479
because just like

1271
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:10,051
this beautiful green garden
that's all around us,

1272
01:18:10,053 --> 01:18:12,118
I know that
we've found a love

1273
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,289
that can only
grow with time.

1274
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:18,259
Tara,

1275
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:20,294
I promise

1276
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:22,629
I will always love you

1277
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:25,498
for the rest
of our lives.

1278
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:49,523
(whooping)

1279
01:18:58,099 --> 01:19:01,468
- Sweetie, it's too early
to clean that up.

1280
01:19:03,304 --> 01:19:06,307
Grace...

1281
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:08,909
where did you get that?

1282
01:19:12,046 --> 01:19:14,514
(chuckling)

1283
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:18,119
(whimsical music)

1284
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,557
- What's that
delicious smell?

1285
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:27,061
- Your wedding cake.
- Spice cupcakes?

1286
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:30,297
- Cinnamon.
That's the same spice

1287
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:32,933
that was in Brandon's
cookies
the first day we met.

1288
01:19:42,476 --> 01:19:46,146
(sighing)

1289
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:53,687
- Hello, Cassie.
- Martha,

1290
01:19:53,689 --> 01:19:56,157
you did a beautiful
job up there.

1291
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,559
- Thanks to this wedding, we
now
have a beautiful showcase
that will inspire

1292
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:02,462
the business community to
help
make Middleton Gardens
a reality.

1293
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,898
All because of you.

1294
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,868
- Martha, it was you
who inspired me.

1295
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:10,270
You recovered all
the auction items.

1296
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:13,907
You designed Middleton's
Botanical Gardens.

1297
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,842
And you married
Brandon and Tara

1298
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:17,745
with an elegant speech,

1299
01:20:17,747 --> 01:20:19,714
all in your first week as
mayor.

1300
01:20:19,716 --> 01:20:22,816
- Imagine what I can do
during my full term!

1301
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:26,186
- I think you'll do an
outstanding job as mayor.

1302
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:29,890
- Well, you haven't
been wrong yet.
(laughing)

1303
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:33,294
Thank you, Cassie.

1304
01:20:41,936 --> 01:20:44,905
- Cassie. I have some good
news.
- Oh?

1305
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:48,374
- I told you how I've always
wanted to care for animals.

1306
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:52,112
I'm going to veterinary
school.
- Wow!

1307
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:54,514
Will that take you
far from Middleton?
- The school's between here

1308
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:57,752
and Maddox, so I'm going to
be
working at your animal
shelter

1309
01:20:57,754 --> 01:21:00,920
- I am so happy for you.
Let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

1310
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:03,490
- Of course. But, Cassie...

1311
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:05,892
you've already
helped me,

1312
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:08,062
more than I can say.

1313
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:10,231
- When did you
decide to do this?

1314
01:21:10,233 --> 01:21:12,065
- In my cell.

1315
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:14,267
I had a lot of
time to think.

1316
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,269
And this...

1317
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:18,506
helped to give me focus.

1318
01:21:18,508 --> 01:21:21,307
And courage.

1319
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:27,247
But I won't be
needing it anymore.

1320
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,283
- No, I don't
believe you will.

1321
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:32,685
- To think, if I'd never
found
that website for
Middleton...

1322
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:37,157
I would never
have found you.
