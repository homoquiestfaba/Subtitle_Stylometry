1
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,277
# She sings from
somewhere you can't see

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,437
# She sits in the top of the greenest tree

3
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,836
# She sends out an aroma
of undefined lust

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,520
# It drips on down in a mist from above

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,312
# She's just the girl

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,908
# She's just the girl, the girl you want

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,719
# She's just the girl

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,593
# She's just the girl, the girl you want

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,878
# You hear her callin'
everywhere you turn

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,560
# You know you're headed
for the pleasure burns

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,195
# But the words get stuck
on the tip of your tongue

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,788
# She's the real thing
but you knew it all along

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,478
# She's just the girl

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,909
# She's just the girl, the girl you want

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,953
# She's just the girl

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,913
# She's just the girl, the girl you want

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,231
# Look at you with your mouth waterin'

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,158
# Look at you with your mind spinnin'

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,199
# Why don't we just admit it's all over?

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,312
# She's just the girl you want

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,919
# She's just the girl

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,112
# She's just the girl, the girl you want

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,399
# She's just the girl

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,717
# She's just the girl, the girl you want

25
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,353
# She's just the girl

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,153
# She's just the girl, the girl you want

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,593
# She's just the girl

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,433
# She's just the girl

29
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,154
Listen up, cos I'm only
tellin' you this once.

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,794
I'm not a bedtime-story lady,
so pay attention.

31
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,674
It's 2033. The world is screwed now.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,837
A while ago, this humongous comet
came crashin' into the earth.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,873
Bam! Total devastation.
End of the world as we know it.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,116
No celebrities, no cable TV.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,674
No water! It hasn't rained in 11 years.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,191
Now 20 people gotta squeeze inside
the same bathtub. So it ain't all bad.

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,473
That's me, the one in the mask.
No, the other one in the mask!

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,116
Today's my boyfriend's birthday, so
I'm out shopping for that perfect gift.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,196
Whatever I can scrounge up.

40
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,389
Uh-oh! Ripper raptors.

41
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,318
The Rippers are a demonic army
of bloodthirsty, human-eating,

42
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,477
purse-snatchin', mutant creatures.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,556
Witness Exhibit A.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,152
Euch! You are so dead. They're led
by the infamous Johnny Prophet.

45
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,558
They spend most of their time raidin'
the WP. That's short for Water and Power.

46
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,150
They control most of the water,
and got all the power.

47
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,912
Oh, wait. One last thing.

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,476
My friends and me, we do not
suck up to Water and Power.

49
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,196
Yeah, we steal water, but as long as
they don't find out, who gives a shit?

50
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,512
Ah, there it is. Home, sweet home.

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,950
That's a beauty.

52
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,230
I'm gonna go water the vegetables.

53
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,189
Town, you fixed the pump, right?
I'm goin' down.

54
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,914
Yeah, go for it!

55
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,640
You've been stealing water.

56
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,196
- What gave you that idea?
- Take off your clothes.

57
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,431
- Now!
- Shit. Right, right, right, right, right.

58
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,318
There.

59
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,676
Did I tell you to stop?

60
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,756
Now...

61
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,636
Salute me.

62
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,555
I'm not too good under pressure.

63
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,989
Well, you'll learn, then, won't you?

64
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,837
- Gross out!
- Come on. They're bein' weird again.

65
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,758
- Let's get outta here.
- Let go.

66
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,836
Damn!

67
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,915
- I was just gettin' into that one.
- Gimme that.

68
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,396
Sam.

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,114
I thought you was workin'
on my Doris Day bust?

70
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,234
I didn't trade you my autographed Doris
picture just for... whatever this is.

71
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,438
I know, but the wood talks to me.
It said Ripper.

72
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,348
How would you know what one looks
like? No one's ever seen a Ripper.

73
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,592
No one's ever seen
your peanut dick either.

74
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,358
- I'm tellin'.
- Go ahead.

75
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,914
Rebecca! Don't forget guard duty.

76
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,071
Adam was dust until God
injected him with life.

77
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,798
And do you know
what was in that injection?

78
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,190
Water.

79
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,869
Water is life. Water is power.

80
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,669
Well done. You've all
done a masterful job.

81
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,036
95 per cent of the desert
and all the water it contains

82
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,720
now belongs to Water and Power.

83
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,075
I think that deserves a little toast.

84
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,436
To Captain Derouche,

85
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,709
for securing most of the desert.

86
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,636
- Captain Derouche.
- Captain Derouche.

87
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,556
I can promise you, sir, the Rippers
will only be a minor setback.

88
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,069
Once I take care of them,

89
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,953
that final crack of land will be ours.

90
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,519
This crack of land, Captain?

91
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,273
Well, it's just a small crack.
It doesn't matter. We'll let that go.

92
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,758
Oh, my. Now look what's happened.

93
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,836
We lost the Feta Plains.

94
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,431
And the Tenelson Ridge!

95
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,396
And so on!

96
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,233
There are three million litres of water
underneath the Blue Dunes.

97
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,555
And you will retrieve it.

98
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,194
Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?

99
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,915
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,871
Good!

101
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,836
Remove your boots, Captain.

102
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,315
Now come here.

103
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,110
The Fool.

104
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,793
It was foolish not to carry out my order.

105
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,753
It was foolish to walk across
a floor full of glass.

106
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,759
If I were you, I wouldn't have done it.
I would have killed me first.

107
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,997
But you lack that courage,
don't you, Captain?

108
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,636
Come closer.

109
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,756
Walk.

110
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,315
Sergeant Small,

111
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,590
it's your show now.

112
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,556
Please,

113
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,995
- try not to let me down.
- Yes, sir.

114
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,799
Lovely.

115
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,070
I take guard duty very seriously.

116
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,112
# Before I was even born

117
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,595
# It's such a gamble when you get a face

118
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,473
# It's fascinating
to observe what the mirror does

119
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,275
# But when I dine,
it's for the wall that I set a place

120
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,755
# I belong to the blank generation

121
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,270
# And I can take it or leave it each time

122
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,999
Elvis! Elvis! Come out and play.

123
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,271
Hey, baby. What do you say?
Me and you, Vegas?

124
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,317
# Triangles were fallin'
at the window as the doctor cursed

125
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,671
# He was a cartoon
long forsaken by the public eye

126
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,436
Bollocks!

127
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,911
Boo!

128
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,155
Rebecca?

129
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,273
Rebecca?

130
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,231
Rebecca?

131
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,555
Rebecca! Rebecca!

132
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,156
Got you!

133
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,194
- You buttsmear.
- What'd I tell you?

134
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,676
Don't say "buttsmear".
It's not becoming. Say...

135
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,871
"asshole" or "dickwad".

136
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,433
- Trade you.
- What?

137
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,358
I'll sneak you some food
for that dangerball you found.

138
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,392
I don't know. You know how to work it?

139
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,239
If you don't... you're steak tartare.

140
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,197
All right.

141
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,709
First... go get me my food.

142
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,636
Happy birthday.

143
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,316
I knew you couldn't resist me.

144
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,356
Snip, snip.

145
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,355
Don't come any closer.

146
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,830
You gotta stay there... and watch.

147
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,710
# Blow me away, see if I...

148
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,713
# Death of a future, goodbye to my friends

149
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,913
# Wish I could see you all again

150
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,919
# Family hollow, family real

151
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,598
# Wish you were here, see how I feel

152
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,235
OK. You can come a little bit closer.

153
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,436
But you can't touch.

154
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,676
Hi.

155
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,678
- Lose the scissors.
- Shit.

156
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,430
Water and Power! Hands in the air!

157
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,036
- Over here! Over here!
- Get the typewriters!

158
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,197
Confirmed.
They've been siphoning water.

159
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,234
Well, keep goin'.
We're just gettin' to the good stuff.

160
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,076
Ooh, yeah.

161
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,558
OK.

162
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,956
Drop something?

163
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,598
Ah, shit.

164
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,916
Rebecca! Help! Rebecca!

165
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,596
Sam!

166
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,276
No! No!

167
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,999
No!

168
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,311
Richard!

169
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,637
Come on!

170
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,035
Work! Shit!

171
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,237
We got her!

172
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,554
You've been stealing water. Not smart.

173
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,238
We could have a lot of fun with this one.

174
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,592
Well, well.

175
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,114
Don't you know
you shouldn't own animals?

176
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,195
There's a water shortage.

177
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,074
There's your water.

178
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,036
Oi, you.

179
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,555
Look at me when I'm talkin' to ya.

180
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,708
That cut looks painful.

181
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,149
I like pain.

182
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,515
And what else do you like?

183
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,115
Hot oil.

184
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,196
Vacuum attachments.

185
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,916
Yup.

186
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,512
Hey... which of you gorgeous guys
would like an oil change, hm?

187
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,120
Don't be stupid. She's gonna bite it off.

188
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,435
The moment I feel teeth, you feel lead.

189
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,195
Well? What are you waitin' for?

190
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,908
I'm gonna need a microscope
and tweezers. It's like...

191
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,431
You know, you're gonna have to stop this.
You're really gettin' me hot.

192
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,155
Freeze!

193
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,673
What?

194
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,431
She's all yours, sir.

195
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,279
Just how many of my men did you kill?

196
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,996
Eight, sir.

197
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,594
Eight, eight, the burning hate.

198
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,510
Between Sunday and Monday
hangs a day so dark it will devastate.

199
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,676
Excuse me.

200
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,719
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

201
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,549
Look, you wanna torture me,

202
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,319
spank me, lick me - do it.

203
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,919
But if this poetry shit continues,
just shoot me now, please.

204
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,395
What, and waste all that talent?

205
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,518
I'm offering you the chance of a lifetime.
The honour of working for me.

206
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,396
Not interested.

207
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,316
Not yet.

208
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,393
Put her to work.

209
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,956
Dig or die!

210
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,957
You people are pathetic!

211
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,629
These water pipes should
have been dug yesterday!

212
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,832
Just stand still.
Hey, this punk's got a knife!

213
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,516
Thought you could use it, huh?

214
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,196
Enjoying yourself?

215
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,111
Hey, what time is it?
I don't wanna miss Baywatch.

216
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,956
Hey, Jet. How's the jet, Jet?

217
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,515
I asked you a question!

218
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,560
There are stress cracks
in the turbine blades,

219
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,070
and the manifold pressure
sensor's leaking like a sieve.

220
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,352
I'm doing a full teardown. I'll have
her back together by Wednesday.

221
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,439
You'll have it back together by morning.
I don't care if you have to work all night.

222
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,633
That is, of course, unless...
you wanna make me change my mind.

223
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,109
I'll have it fixed by morning.

224
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,716
Failure to recycle
body fluids is a violation.

225
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,709
Number four: hoarding
water rations is a violation.

226
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,754
Number five: siphoning body fluids
from another prisoner is a violation.

227
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,914
Number six: tampering with
no-smoking devices is a violation.

228
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,274
# Can't anybody see?

229
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,791
# We've got a war to fight

230
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,193
# Never find our way

231
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,117
# Regardless of what they say

232
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,354
# How can it feel this wrong?

233
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,238
Wait a minute! Where are you goin'?
What is your problem?

234
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,794
I have gone out of my way
to be nice to you!

235
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,709
If it wasn't for me, you would
just be another whore around here.

236
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,035
Now, all I'm asking for

237
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,310
is just a little bit in return.

238
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,960
Quit pickin' on my girlfriend.

239
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,596
Shit!

240
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,551
God, that is...

241
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,035
Thanks. It worked.

242
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,916
What worked?

243
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,637
End of shift. All prisoners return to cells.

244
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,435
End of shift. All prisoners return to cells.

245
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,513
I'm in love!

246
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,796
Cool!

247
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,314
Systems check. Stand by.

248
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,829
Check, check. Check, check, check.

249
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,679
Please enter security signature.

250
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,713
- My mom and yours, hanging out clothes.
- Security signature invalid.

251
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,636
Shit.

252
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,719
You have ten seconds before cyanide gas
is injected into the chamber.

253
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,796
Ten... nine...

254
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,797
eight... seven...

255
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,319
six... five...

256
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,431
four... three...

257
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,232
two... one.

258
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,072
Oh, no.

259
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,231
- Know the security code to this thing?
- Yeah.

260
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,476
Good. Then get me outta here.

261
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,553
Go. Do it. Get cranking.

262
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,958
They're hijacking a tank.
Sir, if you want my opinion...

263
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,036
No, I don't.

264
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,677
Places to wreck, people to do.

265
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,237
This... this tank, it... it... isn't...

266
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,750
Isn't? Isn't?

267
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,791
- Isn't...
- What?

268
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,914
Just one little adjective. We'll have a
whole sentence here. The tank isn't glad.

269
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,996
Sad. Mad.

270
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,596
Lonely.

271
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,755
It isn't op... operational.

272
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,636
- How do I know you're not lyin'?
- Because if I was lying,

273
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,672
your lungs'd be full of cyanide gas.

274
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,916
Cool. So we get a new tank.

275
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,637
Wait. Wait! Look, nobody gets
out of here without a clearance.

276
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,439
We're all prisoners here.
And if they catch you...

277
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,031
Then - don't tell me - they'll take away
my TVprivileges? I'll live with it.

278
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,315
My, my. She'll be fun to break.

279
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,916
How's your lover?

280
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,595
I wouldn't get too attached.

281
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,280
She's not gonna be around much longer.

282
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,119
I bet you just can't wait to take
this baby for a test drive, huh?

283
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,276
That's too bad,

284
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,278
cos you just lost your flying privileges.

285
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,790
And... the whole hangar is off limits, too.

286
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,716
You happy?

287
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,156
Miss me?

288
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,431
- What are you doing?
- I was thinkin' about leavin' this place.

289
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,472
It's been swell,
but the swelling's gone down.

290
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,957
What do you reckon?
We go to New York, see Cats.

291
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,516
You don't understand.

292
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,996
The better you behave,
the more they leave you alone.

293
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,511
And... the more they leave you alone,
the better off you are.

294
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,836
Well, that's a bore!

295
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,076
There's nothin' to be scared of.

296
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,637
You just gotta think about it like...
the first time you got laid.

297
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,878
You just gotta go:
"Daddy, are you sure this is right?"

298
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,591
- You're sick.
- How come you do that?

299
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,439
How come you always cover
your mouth when you smile?

300
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,915
You got bad teeth or somethin'?

301
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,549
- I don't know.
- Come on.

302
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,920
What do you say we bolt?

303
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,270
I'm really startin' to like it here.

304
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,597
People are nice, food's great,
and I love my job.

305
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,035
I can see why you wanna hang around!

306
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,476
Morning.

307
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,080
It's really hard for me...

308
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,149
to play with myself in this thing.

309
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,750
That's a shame.

310
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,234
Look, you want to play, I'll play.
And I'll win.

311
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,792
No. Not if it's Monopoly,
cos I really kick ass at that game.

312
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,556
But... I get to be the shoe.

313
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,148
I'm going to ask you just one more time.

314
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,714
Do you want to work
for Water and Power?

315
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,995
Yeah! That sounds groovy.

316
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,157
Do I get to wear
a cute little outfit like yours?

317
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,030
The pipe.

318
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,515
You're gonna really love this one.

319
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,510
It goes down 40 metres.

320
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,758
Gets smaller and smaller
the deeper you go.

321
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,836
Sounds wicked.

322
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,510
Can I go first?

323
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,595
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

324
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,436
Drop her!

325
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,676
Bye.

326
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,399
No!

327
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,671
- Rebecca! Rebecca!
- No!

328
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,151
Rebecca!

329
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,271
Help!

330
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,955
Rebecca!

331
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,159
Full metal. They didn't have
a chance to squeeze off a round.

332
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,428
Another outpost lost to those Rippers.

333
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,199
At this rate, we'll lose all our water.

334
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,029
Rippers must have come up
from some underground sub-gate.

335
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,513
Well then, I know just
the young lady to help us find it.

336
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,396
Absolutely, sir.

337
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,519
Well, I'm so glad
you see things my way now.

338
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,396
You know what I see?

339
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,277
No. What?

340
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,515
This... big... honkin' booger,

341
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,949
hangin' outta your left nostril.

342
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,428
If I was you,
I'd use this finger to pick it out.

343
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,396
I win.

344
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,554
Yeah. Lucky you.

345
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,798
And just wait till you see
what you've won.

346
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,796
Excuse me.

347
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,316
Relax. It's only a locator.

348
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,516
This is your pulse.

349
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,920
Now I'll always be close to your heart.

350
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,556
Your job is to penetrate
this sub-gate we found,

351
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,956
which could be the entrance
to the Rippers' base.

352
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,835
Most of these are booby-trapped,
so if we hear a loud bang... sorry.

353
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,393
If not, congratulations.
You just found the Rippers' hideout.

354
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,636
Either way, I win.

355
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,509
Like a piece of cheese
at the end of a fishing hook.

356
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,596
- That's you.
- Ready?

357
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,515
Move!

358
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,437
Condor Control, Condor 05.
I'm detecting Ripper activity...

359
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,594
Oh, my God!

360
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,798
That's what you get for messin' with me.

361
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,916
Mine.

362
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,516
Well, whaddaya know?

363
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,794
Am I close to your heart now, Kesslee?

364
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,275
What happened to the rest of ya?

365
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,916
Butthead.

366
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,309
Cool!

367
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,908
Shit!

368
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,276
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

369
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,913
- I thought the Rippers got you.
- Hell, no.

370
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,156
Come on, let's go.

371
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,592
I ain't goin' back there.
You're gonna have to kill me first.

372
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,676
No... I'm not.

373
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,592
Cos I'm not gonna go back there either.

374
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,636
We're free.

375
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,756
Oh, no.

376
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,634
We'd better go before they come back
for us. You take the tank.

377
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,276
Are you sure?

378
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,997
Go! Go!

379
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,799
# Bill collector called today

380
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,628
# Shove! IRS is on my case

381
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,036
Rebecca!

382
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,912
Stop!

383
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,190
No! Rebecca, come on!

384
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,876
Rebecca, turn the engine off!

385
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,559
Kill the engine!

386
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,796
You're crazy!

387
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,996
Are you OK?

388
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,599
Sorry about the bonker on the head.
I think I need to go practise some more.

389
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,914
- No!
- Yes!

390
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,996
Take that! And that!

391
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,717
You didn't have to
rough me up so bad, Becky.

392
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,676
Look! No hands!

393
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,036
You could do that for a living.

394
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,237
Your face has been gutted,
Mr Kesslee, sir.

395
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,115
To be honest, your chances of seeing
are as likely as your arm growing back.

396
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,038
However, I can make you comfortable.

397
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,718
No!

398
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,751
No painkillers.

399
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,031
Do I make myself clear, Doctor?

400
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,513
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

401
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,190
Now... what is the prognosis?

402
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,032
- Not good, sir.
- Not good.

403
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,716
Excuse me.

404
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,399
- Sir, this is Mr Che'tsai.
- What? What?

405
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,474
Che'tsai.

406
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,513
He specialises in cybergenic
reconstructive surgery.

407
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,948
Go ahead, sir.

408
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,157
All the king's horses
and all the king's men

409
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,158
wish they had the technology I have.

410
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,629
If you want my services,

411
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,398
the fee will be 100,000 litres.

412
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,996
Doctor, come here.

413
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,434
You see the glass half-empty.

414
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,028
I prefer to see it half-full.

415
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,593
- Don't you agree, Sergeant?
- I don't understand.

416
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,550
We can't be in here. We're trespassing.
What if somebody catches us?

417
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,433
Jet, there she blows, matey!

418
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,516
Put it down. It's not funny.

419
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,749
What is it?

420
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,917
Raise your hands to the sky gods!

421
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,156
The rains are coming.

422
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,712
But it hasn't rained since the comet.

423
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,999
I need metal to complete my ark.
I'll be taking your tank.

424
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,111
No, see, you won't be taking the tank.

425
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,994
The Rippers are waiting.
I must save them from the floods.

426
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,796
Tell me the security code.

427
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,389
All right, listen, Rain Lady.

428
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,670
Where'd you get this?

429
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,792
- I made it.
- Liar.

430
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,433
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

431
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,233
It's something I designed -
a spectrum analyser

432
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,591
which recognises
voice-pattern stress modulations.

433
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,757
- It detects lies.
- But I only speak the truth.

434
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,110
- Liar.
- All right...

435
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,949
I... I caught it in my fishpond... on a stick.

436
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,958
- Liar.
- All right, all right, all right.

437
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,119
They were selling a girl's stuff after
they had taken her prisoner. I bought it.

438
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,630
- It was sad, really.
- What'd they do with the girl?

439
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,752
First tell me what
Water and Power want with her.

440
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,917
We're not Water and Power.
We're escaped prisoners.

441
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,830
In that case... It was terrible. They put
her to work in town at Liquid Silver.

442
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,757
Come on, Jet. We gotta go get her.
To the Bat Tank!

443
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,270
Wait! Wait! We can't go into town
with those Water and Power vehicles.

444
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,237
You can fix them up here in my garage.

445
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,589
Yes!

446
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,915
Hey, Jet.

447
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,110
Nice work.

448
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,954
They took the bait, sir, and they're
on their way to Liquid Silver for the girl.

449
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,471
- Make sure I get the girl first, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,836
I'm outta here.

451
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,840
What you got there, little boy?

452
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,269
No, I don't need
none of that today, thank you.

453
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,272
- Nice hats.
- Do you know what kind of place this is?

454
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,834
Yeah. Come on.
Let's split up and find Sam.

455
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,838
# Stand up

456
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,595
# You've got to manage

457
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,116
# I won't sympathise

458
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,798
# Any more

459
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,399
How many would you like?

460
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,911
# And if you complain once more

461
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,716
# You'll meet an army of me

462
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,316
# You're all right

463
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,758
I got a guy here
who wants the schoolgirl thing.

464
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,837
For real.

465
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,269
Introduce him to Sam.

466
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,231
She's just a girl.

467
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,316
Not for long.

468
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,635
- Dancers, welcome to Liquid Silver.
- I can get you out.

469
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,718
First we are going to create your look.

470
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,515
Girls, please step up
to the glamourport in front of you.

471
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,194
Your dressing room is equipped with
the latest Liquid Silver fashions.

472
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,631
You will start by shaving
all inappropriate hair.

473
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,716
If your ears are not pierced,
you will find an ear-puncher before you.

474
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,237
# The wrong things right

475
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,838
# Can't stop lovin' you

476
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,996
# And I won't stop callin' you, my baby

477
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,076
The crop top.

478
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,956
The anklets and the mules.

479
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,316
The spiralling arm cuff.

480
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,996
And now the wrap skirt.

481
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,075
You have now finished
creating your look.

482
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,671
If you have followed instructions
properly, you should appear as so.

483
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,355
Lock up your sons.

484
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,239
Now, you stop this
childish behaviour this instant.

485
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,909
Do you want me to tell your mother
how naughty you've been? Do you?

486
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,759
Don't take my silver.
It's all the money I've got.

487
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,395
Silver. I'll have that.

488
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,236
The Clapper. That's what
you get for being a perv.

489
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,116
Hey! You're gonna get fired,
you keep treatin' the guests like that.

490
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,196
Rebecca!

491
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,717
There she is! And the little girl. Get them!

492
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,956
Guards! Hurry!

493
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,674
Kill her. Kill them both.

494
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,755
Not a good idea.

495
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,429
Now... everybody drop your guns,

496
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,875
or I scrape off all her make-up.

497
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,194
This might take me a really long time.

498
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,673
Sam! Is this the lady who put you
in a room with that scumbag?

499
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,553
- Yeah.
- A ten-year-old girl.

500
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,591
She has to learn sometime.

501
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,439
Look, you got two choices.

502
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,233
Either I improve that lovely hairdo,

503
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,596
or you sing for us.

504
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,679
Fine.

505
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,156
All right. What do you want me to sing?

506
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,912
"Let's Do lt." Cole Porter, 1928.

507
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,749
I hate that song.

508
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,599
I'll cut it off.

509
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,678
# When the little bluebird

510
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,310
# Who has never said a word

511
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,392
# Starts to sing

512
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,397
# Spring, spring

513
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,479
Louder! I can't hear you!

514
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,273
# When the little blue clerk

515
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,670
# In the middle of his work

516
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,634
# Starts a tune to the moon up above

517
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,836
Everybody!

518
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,520
# It is nature, that's all

519
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,668
# Simply telling us to fall in love

520
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,756
Come on! You too!

521
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,271
# And that's why

522
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,552
# Birds do it, bees do it

523
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,196
# Even educated fleas do it

524
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,831
# Let's do it

525
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,111
# Let's fall in love

526
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,358
# I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it

527
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,719
# Heavy hippopotami do it

528
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:18,110
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

529
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,516
# They say that

530
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,869
# Upper-crust ladies do it

531
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,552
# When a gentleman struts

532
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,071
# Come on, doll

533
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,839
# Why don't we do it?

534
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,269
# Or don't you have the guts?

535
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,235
# Penguins in flocks on the rocks do it

536
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,750
# Even little cuckoos in their clocks do it

537
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,953
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

538
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,959
- What the hell is that?
- Sounds like Cole Porter to me, sir.

539
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,230
- End it!
- Yes, sir.

540
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,831
# Sometimes on the sly you do it

541
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,077
# Maybe later you and I might do it

542
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,871
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

543
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,070
Hey, you in the bathrobe!

544
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,668
# Let's do it

545
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,711
# Let's...

546
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,070
Sam!

547
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,755
Jet! Where's Sam?

548
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,836
- Sam!
- Sam!

549
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,156
Rebecca!

550
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,756
Rebecca!

551
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,199
- Sam!
- You let her go!

552
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,959
No!

553
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,959
Sam!

554
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,194
Don't worry. Your friends'll
be along shortly to save you,

555
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,595
my little princess.

556
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,712
The Rippers? Are you kidding?
You don't know what they're like.

557
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,752
Are you out of your mind?
You haven't seen these things.

558
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,714
They're not human. They're
demons from hell. I'm telling you.

559
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,231
Look, if we're gonna rescue Sam, we're
gonna need an army. They're an army.

560
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,190
Yeah, but...

561
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,880
Rebecca, we've been
combing the desert all night.

562
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,956
We'll never find the Rippers' sub-gate.

563
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,278
Look, Rain Lady said the Rippers'
sub-gate was around here somewhere.

564
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,595
Near two rocks.

565
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,870
I can't believe we're doing this.

566
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,755
Rebecca? Rebecca?

567
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,279
Rebecca!

568
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,356
Where are you?

569
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,956
What's going on? Rebecca!

570
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,636
Rebecca!

571
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,036
Rebecca!

572
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,120
- Jet, what took you so long?
- Rebecca.

573
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,317
What?

574
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,556
What?

575
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,475
See hell, go to hell.

576
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,038
Oh, my God. It's the Elephant Man!

577
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,239
Hey, Quasimodo guy! We're hungry
in here. How 'bout some food?

578
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,596
Now you've done it!

579
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,911
So, like,

580
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,190
what are your names?

581
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,796
- Gimme the gas.
- And, like, what are you doing here?

582
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,595
Is it true what they say
about guys with big shoes?

583
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,558
- Yeah.
- He asked you a question. Answer it!

584
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,638
Hey, I have two words for you.

585
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,716
Brush your teeth!

586
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,874
They're spies. They got
Water and Power logos all over.

587
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,719
Yeah, I was thinking that,
but then I was also thinking

588
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,195
that if they are Water and Power...

589
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,469
No, no, no, no!

590
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,239
Why would they come here advertisin' it?

591
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:39,514
Check it out. Tattoos.
Wonder where else they got 'em.

592
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,076
I don't think those are tattoos.
Who would want some alphabet soup?

593
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,832
I'd rather have a dragon or somethin'
more Aquarian-related, you dig?

594
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,875
- They're prisoner stamps.
- Prison, my ass.

595
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,070
That's exactly what they want us to think.

596
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,192
Or, better yet, that isn't
what they want us to think.

597
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,790
That way we'll think
what they think we might think,

598
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,480
- but actually...
- Booga.

599
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,556
Try not to speak.

600
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,715
- How much did they pay you to spy?
- Two dollars and 15 cents.

601
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,796
Shut up!

602
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,949
You should go easy on the truth serum.
It might send 'em off.

603
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,075
That could be to our advantage.

604
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,590
Good. I'm tired of asking 'em
questions anyway. I say we kill 'em.

605
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,951
- I say we hump 'em.
- I say we get crumpets and tea.

606
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,516
Tasty. Crumpets and tea. All in favour
of crumpets and tea say aye.

607
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,871
- Aye.
- Ain't gonna be no crumpets and tea!

608
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,150
We're gonna take 'em
outside and waste 'em.

609
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,919
I think they're nice. I say we let 'em go.

610
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,838
Let 'em go? They're spies!
I'm gonna kill 'em myself.

611
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,351
Wait! Now, I don't remember
anybody puttin' you in charge, T-Saint.

612
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,149
Yeah. He's right.
We're a committee now. We'll vote on it.

613
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,273
Dig. All in favour of killing 'em,
raise your tail.

614
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,118
And all those in favour of not killing 'em...

615
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,758
- Gentlemen, it's a tie.
- Coin-toss time.

616
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,556
This is pathetic.

617
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,833
No cheating. Ready? One, two, three.

618
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,076
Got you.

619
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,196
- Hi.
- Hi.

620
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,313
Do you suppose me and Jet
could go to the bathroom?

621
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,637
Totally negatory.

622
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,754
- Hi.
- Hi.

623
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,791
You know, me and Jet
could make it worth your while.

624
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,673
Put a little smile on that kangaroo face.

625
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,275
You got baseball cards?

626
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,671
No, but I know where
I could get you some.

627
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,791
She does.

628
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,916
- Totally negatory.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

629
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,749
Come on. You don't wanna be
like those other manimals in there.

630
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,711
We're not manimals.

631
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,990
What are you?

632
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,714
The army wanted to build
the ultimate soldier,

633
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,389
so they messed with kangaroo NDA and...

634
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,875
You mean DNA.

635
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,558
Yeah.

636
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,319
And they created us.

637
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,070
And then the war ended
and they told Johnny to poison us.

638
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,919
- Johnny Prophet?
- Yeah.

639
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,999
- Why?
- Because he was the one that made us.

640
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,954
But then he didn't do it because
he decided that he liked us too much.

641
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:00,677
I have this great idea. You, me and Jet
go for a visit with Johnny Prophet.

642
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,031
When he gets back, yeah. Well... maybe.

643
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,151
Where did he go?

644
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,352
To... New Zealand, for a little while,

645
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,395
to help some scientist guy who was
makin' sea water so you could drink it.

646
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,432
Does she need to know that?
Do they need to know that?

647
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,516
Get your ass outta here!

648
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,317
- Go ahead, WP2. We have...
- Hey, you guys, hey!

649
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,352
- Water and Power's gettin' a shipment.
- What kind of shipment?

650
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,392
- I don't know. It's comin' from Red Sands.
- When?

651
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,635
Tonight.

652
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,593
- What if it's an arms shipment?
- It's a trap.

653
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,076
What if they want us to think
it's a trap but it's really not?

654
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,556
That way, when we get there,
it could still be one.

655
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,477
- Or, better yet, what if...
- Booga.

656
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,070
Why don't you make yourself useful
and go and choke on somethin'?

657
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,191
That's cold, man.

658
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,116
OK. We're gonna give you chicks
a chance to prove yourself.

659
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,595
Call it an initiation.

660
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,115
You fail, you die.

661
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,800
Yeah, but first you gotta strip.

662
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,148
- That's not in the plan.
- Why not?

663
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,520
Hold on, cats. All right.

664
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:38,596
All you have to do is confirm
the shipment. Copacetic.

665
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:43,954
You're gonna use this, but you have to be
really careful, because I designed it with...

666
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,553
I especially built it
with a visual-send processor.

667
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,037
It's a little invention - that I invented
myself, I might add, actually.

668
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,469
- Smile.
- And these are so you can hear us.

669
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,716
This one's for you.

670
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,991
And this one... I made especially for you.

671
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,992
Let me help you put it on cos it's kinda
tricky. I'm sorry. How clumsy of me.

672
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,794
- Get off!
- It was hard to clip on.

673
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,358
OK. So, we can hear you,
but how are you gonna hear us?

674
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,075
Just speak facin' west.
We'll hear you all right.

675
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,997
The code will be: "On the Road". Yeah.

676
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,395
He's Jack Kerouac incarnate.

677
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:29,196
We're all reincarnated. That means you're
not really dead or you think you're dead...

678
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,312
- Who'd you used to be?
- A cop.

679
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,476
Figures.

680
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:41,514
I used to be Ted Smith, assistant manager
at Chief Auto Parts in Cincinnati, Ohio.

681
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,596
- Fascinating.
- Thank you.

682
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,439
I was a dog,
but because I was really good

683
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,358
they moved me up to human-being status.

684
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,229
Sort of.

685
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,476
Strike.

686
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,793
North. Wait. South... west.

687
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,673
Mr Kerouac, I am sending you an image.

688
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,439
- Here it comes.
- This is the south side of the warehouse.

689
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,396
That's gotta be it. Let's move.

690
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,000
All I see is a coupla workers
unloadin' some crates.

691
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,193
That could be toilet paper. I don't see
no Water and Power vehicles out there.

692
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,437
Tell you the truth, I don't see jack shit.
We need more proof.

693
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,915
Yeah. I'll give you more proof.

694
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,955
- I got your proof.
- There it is.

695
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,958
- Oh, my.
- Tasty.

696
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,117
Damn it.

697
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,511
We gotta get in closer if we're gonna
take pictures of those weapons.

698
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,279
What are you doing?
Those guys'll mangle you.

699
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,153
Jet... they're men.

700
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,116
Move it or lose it.

701
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,555
Becca. What's this for?

702
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,910
- Work with me, girl.
- What do you mean, work with you?

703
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,190
What are you doing?

704
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,351
Oh, fabulous.

705
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,994
I have died and gone
to hard-body heaven.

706
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,309
Sheneequa, don't dally.

707
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,235
You are giving me realness.

708
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:19,835
Delfrieda, darling. Be a good little girl and
let's get set up. Over there by the crates.

709
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,760
- Take off your shirt.
- What are you doing here?

710
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,953
- This is a restricted area.
- I know you're not talking to me like this.

711
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,594
- Obviously you didn't get the memo.
- What memo?

712
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:34,316
Darling, we are doing
a "Men of Water and Power" calendar.

713
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:40,631
And I think you would be
the perfect supermodel cover.

714
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,837
You mean we get to be calendar guys?
Can I be December?

715
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,997
Baby, you can be any month you want.

716
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,389
LeSean, have we left
ourselves in our purse?

717
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,832
Shoot the men near the crates.
It's more... manly.

718
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,190
Quickly.

719
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,470
Come on. Get up. Get up. Come on.

720
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,477
All right. Here we go.

721
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,549
Oh, my goodness. You are
so beautiful you're making me sick.

722
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,193
Smile for me.

723
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,389
Yes! OK.

724
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,114
- What's this?
- I don't know.

725
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,515
Let me see... Open your shirt.
Quick, quick!

726
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,995
All right, now. Smile.
Let me see those teeth.

727
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,475
OK. Yes, yes. Yes, I like that.

728
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,076
Those are definitely weapons
in those crates. We better move.

729
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,636
No way. The whole thing is
so convenient, man. If they wanna be

730
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,320
down with us,
tell 'em to hijack the shipment.

731
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,989
- If they pull it off, we'll think about it.
- I'll have the goods in an hour.

732
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,076
Asshole!

733
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,994
The glamour has left the building.

734
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,954
There is no magic, there is no sparkle,
there is no je ne sais quoi.

735
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,640
- Come, Jetina.
- Hold your chest. Come on.

736
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,274
Yes, that's brilliant. That's great.

737
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,071
- Jetina, come.
- Oh, God. That's great!

738
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:12,511
- You're so brilliant! You're a supermodel!
- The super has left the model, girl.

739
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,710
- Come on!
- When's the calendar comin' out?

740
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,676
Let's go!

741
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,356
Turbo booster!

742
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,316
What the hell...?

743
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,590
Suck on this, dirtbag!

744
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,193
And keep your ass outta the fast lane!

745
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,358
Damn!

746
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,399
Jet, what are you wearing tonight?

747
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,433
Jetness. Remember me?
Hijacking shipment. Me, you.

748
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,834
Jet! Hello!

749
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,475
Shit! I've got a malfunction.

750
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,909
Fix it fast and get
your narrow butt over here.

751
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,395
I wouldn't want you to miss all this fun.

752
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,472
Do you mind?
I'm tryin' to have a little lunch.

753
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,676
Now you're workin' my tits.

754
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,268
You guys can't shoot worth a shit!

755
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,597
Hail!

756
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,196
Where is she?

757
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,635
Road kill.

758
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,996
I'm too young for this shit.

759
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,230
Well, I guess we got rid of her, huh?

760
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,236
Jack... Jack!

761
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,392
Hi!

762
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,909
- Feeling a little inadequate?
- Get outta here!

763
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:16,231
Hey, girl. Glad you could join me.
I'm in the semi, and I got the goods.

764
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,079
Rebecca! Can you hear me?

765
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,431
There's a big cliff coming up on you.
Now hit the brakes.

766
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,110
- Hit the brakes!
- Brakes aren't working, girl! Plan B!

767
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,834
- Get outta there! Quick! Jump!
- Jet!

768
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,716
Rebecca!

769
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,550
Come on!

770
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,472
I came as fast as I could. I know
you probably didn't need help,

771
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,955
but I got here as fast as I could.

772
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,879
I had it all under control, Booga.

773
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,198
- That squash is really good.
- A toast... to our newest members.

774
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,310
May their energies enhance
the spirit of our circle.

775
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,076
Great. Now let's check out the weapons.

776
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,158
After the ceremony
the weapons'll be disposed of.

777
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,430
Why? After all that!

778
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,390
We don't use guns.

779
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,799
You don't use guns.

780
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,310
Prophet taught us to fight
without the corruption of guns.

781
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,590
Let us all hold hands.

782
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,356
Please.

783
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,233
I'd like to recite a poem that I've written.

784
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,993
Laugh, you butterfly

785
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,509
That dances in the mud

786
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,397
Laugh, you piece of dental floss

787
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,757
You burn, me toast.

788
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,997
Laugh, you pig that flies in the sky

789
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,590
With rainbow twinky fluid

790
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,669
And three litres of high-octane petrol.

791
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,836
Bravo.

792
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,158
Bravo.

793
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,032
Thank you.

794
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,434
Now... let's pray.

795
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,876
Come on, Jet.

796
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,634
- What are you doing?
- We're praying to the spirit of freedom.

797
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,673
- Prophet taught us religion.
- Hallelujah!

798
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,792
- Come on.
- I can't.

799
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,876
It's OK. I have condoms.

800
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,356
Hit it, Jet!

801
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,835
Booga, where did you learn to dance?

802
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,517
# Now where'd it go?

803
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,317
# Aurora

804
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,874
Oh, wow.

805
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,080
It's one of Johnny Prophet's dreams.

806
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,994
See how the people are all free,

807
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,033
and the water just
comes down from the sky

808
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,515
and it don't cost nothin'.

809
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,957
With flowers and rainbows.

810
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,556
It's beautiful.

811
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,911
This is just like Christmas.

812
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,749
I love opening things, especially
when you don't know what's inside.

813
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,270
I remember the first Christmas
I got to open something.

814
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,359
It was a book. I didn't know what the title
was cos the cover was ripped off,

815
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,950
but it had these really cool pictures of...

816
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,038
- Booga.
- OK, OK. I'm done.

817
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,469
Let's get this one. Two... three!

818
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,235
- It's dirt.
- This is bullshit.

819
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,590
- We've been had.
- Good job.

820
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,678
Come on. Help me open
this one over here.

821
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,756
One... two... three.

822
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,436
Jesus Christ!

823
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,396
Johnny Prophet.

824
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,273
Motherfuckin' Kesslee killed Prophet!

825
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,073
OK, guys. Here's the plan.

826
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:52,197
Water and Power has mines
all the way from here to here.

827
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,709
There's no way through 'em.

828
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,070
- How about we go over 'em?
- That's great.

829
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,668
How you plannin' on
sneakin' over the top? Fly?

830
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,677
Yep. We've got the stolen flier.

831
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,112
All we have to do is paint it
back the way it was and... pow!

832
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,752
- And when they ask for a security code?
- Yeah. Then what?

833
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:14,396
Well, maybe we could wait till
another flier does a routine scout,

834
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,715
we capture his ID code and we're in.

835
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,638
Brilliant. OK. I will meet you there.

836
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,919
Wait. What do you mean, meet us there?

837
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,994
- I'm not goin' in without my tank.
- Let's go.

838
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,794
We're listenin' to her now? I thought
we were a committee. We gotta vote.

839
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,309
Everybody for that pathetic plan,
raise your paw.

840
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,396
Majority. Let's go.

841
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,237
Committee!

842
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,350
Condor to 04, respond when airborne.

843
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,630
OK. OK, I've got us an ID card.

844
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,716
You are just too cool.

845
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,071
All right. Now, try to sound relaxed
and, whatever you do,

846
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,397
- only repeat what I tell you. Got it?
- Yeah.

847
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,310
- Condor Control. This is Condor 04. Over.
- OK.

848
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,955
Condor Control. Condo...
I mean, Condor 4.

849
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,358
- Come in. Over.
- Condor 4, we just sent you out.

850
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,790
You must have a stabiliser
in your left modifier, OK? Go ahead.

851
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,151
Must be a stabiliser in the left...
in the modifier.

852
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,352
Condor 4, why aren't you using
your assigned frequency?

853
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,914
- Must be a short haircut.
- No!

854
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,270
Short circuit.

855
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,950
# Because she's quick to flip
and empty out the clip

856
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,150
# And make a man understand
where she's comin' from

857
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,475
# Her hard core's connected
to the base of her fate

858
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,319
# She just breaks
and brings drama to the situation

859
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,512
# Ejaculation, a hot projectile

860
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,358
# Better recognise
that she comes, she comes

861
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:06,677
# She says she had enough of men
and now she's lookin' for payback

862
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,189
# And there's no way
that you can fade her sun

863
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,039
# She walks softly
but she carries a big gun

864
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,674
- Just repeat what she tells you.
- You're blowing it!

865
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,429
- Say again, 04.
- You're blowin' it. Just listen to me, OK?

866
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,834
- We're dead.
- We're dead.

867
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,520
Condor 04, you said you're dead?

868
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,677
That's it. Turn this boat around
or you're gonna get us killed.

869
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,792
- Now! Do it now!
- No! We're going in!

870
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,797
You are gonna listen to me for once!

871
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,196
You're gonna shut your deformed face
and let me do my stuff!

872
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,151
Have you got that?

873
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,952
All right.

874
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,356
Home Plate, this is Condor 4.
We have pirate interference.

875
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,790
Obviously a Ripper ploy to confuse you.
Now here's the situation.

876
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,639
This bird has no electrical,
and in about two minutes

877
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,194
we're gonna be kissing gravel,
so listen to me!

878
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,515
Get off your butt and clear us for landing

879
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:56,235
or I'm gonna fly this rocket
right up your socket!

880
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,320
- Roger, 04. You're cleared for Hangar A.
- Cool.

881
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,874
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

882
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,036
About time.

883
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,110
Damn!

884
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,676
Start the water.

885
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,759
Shoving a small,
innocent child down the pipe

886
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,519
and then slowly letting her drown.

887
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,555
Is that wrong?

888
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,030
It's all clear.

889
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,116
Let's go, daddy-o.

890
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,038
- Did you hear that?
- What? I don't hear anything.

891
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:40,232
- Must be 150 of 'em.
- 163.

892
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,112
We're toast.

893
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:45,232
Actually, 164. Definitely.

894
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,435
Rebecca! Are you OK?

895
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,153
OK. Come on. Come on.

896
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,074
- Come on.
- Go, go, go, go.

897
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,996
No!

898
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:18,392
You see that light down there?
Light is not our bag.

899
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,796
Yeah. We're much better in the dark.
Like Count Chocula.

900
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,876
Dracula, fool!

901
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,629
Count Chocula's the guy
on the laundry-detergent box.

902
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,991
- If I asked you somethin', I...
- No, he is. He's right.

903
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,712
Shut up!

904
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,071
Thank you. Could we just figure out
what we're gonna do, please?

905
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,760
There are power boxes
down at the end of this aisle.

906
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,713
- If only we could get to them.
- Later, cats.

907
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,796
Deetee!

908
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:52,238
- Sir, we got action!
- Let's get this over with quickly.

909
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,393
- We've lost power.
- What the hell happened to the lights?

910
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,355
Guard! Watch our back.

911
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,515
Oh, no. Deetee?

912
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,635
Hold on, man. Hold on.

913
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,716
Deetee!

914
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,436
Oh, my God.

915
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,269
I'll see you cats at that big jam in the sky.

916
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,712
No... No!

917
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,639
Help.

918
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,315
Rebecca! Help!

919
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,116
Hang on! I hear you!

920
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,552
I can't breathe.

921
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,756
Please! Help me.

922
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,148
I can't breathe.

923
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,078
Please help me.

924
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,948
If you're looking for Sam,
she's in the pipe!

925
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,754
What, again? Piece of shit!

926
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,270
There's somethin' about you
that's different. I think it...

927
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,598
I'll tell you what's different. I've lost
my patience. And you've lost the fight.

928
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:46,989
I played you.
I played you like an old fiddle.

929
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,671
Well, maybe we could wait till
another flier does a routine scout,

930
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,758
- we capture his ID code and we're in.
- Brilliant.

931
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,350
Jet. She's been workin' for you
this whole time.

932
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:03,952
No. You were. You're a walking,
talking, living microphone.

933
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,640
I had them planted all over your body.

934
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,560
Thank you for serving up the Rippers.

935
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,115
They'll make great
shoe leather for my soldiers.

936
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,950
Need a hand?

937
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,274
Come on. Get up.

938
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,950
Oh, I'm so pretty.

939
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,914
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
your children will be born bruised.

940
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,314
Get up!

941
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,636
Marvellous, isn't it?

942
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,318
State of the art. Holographic technology.

943
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,868
Know what it means? It means
I can hurt you, but you can't hurt me.

944
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,830
I won and you know it.

945
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,469
Come on.

946
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,958
Say it, say it. Just say I won.

947
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,913
- I won.
- No! No!

948
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,713
- Say I won.
- I won.

949
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,389
Say it... and the little girl lives.

950
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,473
I'd rather her die than live as your slave.

951
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,230
What took ya so long?

952
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,277
Well, well, well.

953
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,396
I win.

954
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,433
What's the matter with you? Finish him!

955
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,434
Oh, shit. Don't tell me you're outta ammo.

956
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,796
Don't move a muscle.

957
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,313
I hate wastin' good beer for nothin'.

958
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,878
Thirsty?

959
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,636
Screw this, man.

960
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,475
Higher! Higher!

961
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,556
Come on!

962
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,832
One for the road.

963
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,432
I'm melting! I'm melting!

964
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,950
Is that the best you can do?

965
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,355
Try this close to your heart, asshole.

966
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,276
Did I hurt you yet?

967
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,517
It's not over... over.

968
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:18,997
It's not over. It's not...
It's not... It's not... It's not...

969
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,912
- Help.
- Hang on! I hear you!

970
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,634
Help. Help!

971
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,991
Fuck me.

972
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,195
How many times do I have to tell you?

973
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,880
I don't want to.

974
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,153
Don't move!

975
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,396
Down!

976
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,270
See you in the next world.

977
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,311
Atten-hut!

978
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:26,799
General, we have taken out the airfields
and now have control of the bridge.

979
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,150
Awaiting your next command, sir.

980
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,510
I took the bullets outta their guns.
That was smart, huh?

981
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,031
Booga, that was very smart.

982
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,589
Whaddaya say we blow this joint?

983
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:19,113
# That's why birds do it, bees do it

984
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:22,153
# Even educated fleas do it

985
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:27,752
- Rebecca, hit the brakes! Waterfall ahead!
- Shut up! You'll ruin the surprise.

986
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,789
# Even lazy jellyfish do it

987
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,878
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

988
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,552
# I've heard that lizards and frogs do it

989
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,872
# Lyin' on a rock

990
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:45,190
# They say that roosters do it
with the doodlin' cocks

991
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:48,756
# Some Argentines without means do it

992
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,314
# I hear in Boston beans do it

993
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,750
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

994
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,834
# When the little bluebird

995
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,315
# Who has never said a word

996
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,795
# When the little bird fell

997
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,195
# At the bottom of a dell

998
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,629
# When the little blue clerk

999
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,069
# In the middle of his work

1000
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,156
# Starts a tune

1001
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,238
# When a gentleman calls

1002
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:30,835
# Bugs in your rugs, they do it,
what's the use of my balls?

1003
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,077
# The chimpanzees in the zoos do it

1004
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,555
# Some courageous kangaroos do it

1005
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,672
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

1006
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,870
# I'm sure sometimes on the sly you do it

1007
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,355
# Maybe even you and I might do it

1008
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:49,552
# Let's do it, let's fall in love

1009
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,198
# It's goin' down, yo, the girl got a gun

1010
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,278
# Best run because she's quick
to flip and empty out the clip

1011
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,595
# And make a man understand
where she's comin' from

1012
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,711
# Her hard core's connected
to the base of her fate

1013
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,593
# She just breaks
and brings drama to the situation

1014
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:16,837
# Ejaculation, a hot projectile

1015
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:20,191
# Better recognise that she comes,
she comes correct, collect respect

1016
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,799
# And if not, you catch a broken neck

1017
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,956
# Buddy, look down,
your shirt's all bloody

1018
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,833
# Looks like she caught you with
the bad one for messin' with the mad one

1019
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,509
# Told you 'bout this girl before,
you didn't listen to me as I talked

1020
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:34,269
# Now you're stalked by the hunter
of the frontier who's size five and sexy

1021
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,755
# Quickly catch a body
and another one next week

1022
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,916
# Huh, it doesn't matter
cos the girls they strap

1023
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:42,032
# She says she's had enough of men
and now she's lookin' for payback

1024
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,549
# And there's no way
that you can fade her sun

1025
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,989
# She walks softly
but she carries a big gun

1026
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,351
# She walks softly
but she carries a big gun

1027
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,955
# She walks softly
but she carries a big gun

1028
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,435
# She walks softly
but she carries a big gun

1029
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,477
# She walks softly
but she carries a big gun

1030
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,592
# The most venomous
feminist homie, she ain't soft

1031
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,790
# You give her trouble
and she might cut your head off

1032
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,639
# Or somethin' that you like
to think's the best

1033
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,116
# She'll blow big holes in your chest

1034
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,595
# She says she gotta cos
she says a lot of ladies won't

1035
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:12,154
# She says she gotta cos
she says a lot of ladies don't

# She says she gotta cos she knows
a lot of ladies romance the thought

1038
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,637
# To giving men their own medicine

1039
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,115
# Electrocute 'em,
light 'em up like Con Edison

1040
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,356
# She got no fear, five rings in her ear

1041
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,675
# Holes in her nose, way-out clothes

1042
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,394
# Livin' life to the full
is buckshot and bullets

1043
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,159
# Triggers, she'll pull it,
Earth, she wanna rule it

1044
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,077
# Maybe she will cos she's quick to kill

1045
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:37,112
# The city lights make her dresses tight,
yes, she bites

1046
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,629
# You never know where she'll come from

1047
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,035
# She walks softly
but she carries a big gun

1048
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,515

but she carries a big gun

1049

# She walks softly
but she carries a big gun

1051
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,109
# There's no way
that you can fade her sun

1052
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,470

# She

1057
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:17,557
# She flies without no feathers

1058
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,839
# A fool to try and catch her

1059
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,231
# Well, I don't know

1060
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,237
# Cos I don't know

1061
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,032
# I'm a fool

1062
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,116
# No sex

1063
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:32,153
# I'm bored with anticipation

1064
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,350
# This love-song radio station

1065
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,232
# I guess you'll sleep

1066
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,157
# I'll count sheep

1067
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:42,510
# And watch you dream

1068
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,399
# So let's

1069
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,956
# Make a run and buy a rocket 'copter

1070
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:58,950
# I bought it from a crooked copper

1071
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:02,470
# Her breath, it smelled like beer

1072
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:06,673
# Warm beer, warm beer

1073
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,318
# Hey, hey

1074
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,590
# Rocket boy

1075
