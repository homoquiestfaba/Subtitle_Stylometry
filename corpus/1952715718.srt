1
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,180
Morning, gentlemen. Feet.

2
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,400
So happy you're here.

3
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,490
This is the third open house
and not one bite.

4
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,030
Well...

5
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,330
Don't worry.

6
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,330
I have everything
under control.

7
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,090
Anna, you are a realtor?

8
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,180
I'm a stager. I stage apartments
for realtors.

9
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,680
I transform ordinary spaces
into something special.

10
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,270
Most people don't know what it is they want
until I show it to them,

11
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,850
and so many places
need my help.

12
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,730
Not the Davenport,
of course.

13
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,900
It's just a very fine line
between elegant and dowdy.

14
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,240
I just think maybe
a quarter-inch higher.

15
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,240
Plus an eighth of an inch?
We'll get it right.

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,870
You did that on purpose.
Knock it off.

17
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,630
As I'm sure
you're aware,

18
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,750
apartments at the Davenport
don't come up very often,

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,050
and we have more than our share of applicants.
So, why you?

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,050
I have lived in Boston
my entire life,

21
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,560
and I have always
dreamed of living here.

22
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,730
And thankfully, I have found somebody
who shares that dream,

23
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,060
and I can assure you that you will not find
two people more in sync

24
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,860
with your exceptionally high standards and,

25
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,240
if I may be so bold,
your taste.

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,530
Thank you.

27
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,660
Wow!

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,120
With a bit of luck,
we might get some offers.

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,500
Come on, Charlie.

30
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,250
You know it's not about luck.
It's about preparation.

31
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,500
Put these in the oven half an hour before you open

32
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,760
and you'll have five offers before noon.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,420
No luck needed.

34
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,180
Okay, say it with me.
Three bedrooms.

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,260
Three bedrooms.

36
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,930
Concierge.
Concierge.

37
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,310
Full gym and swimming pool looking over the common.
I mean, come on!

38
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,850
Don't get cocky.

39
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,060
Why, you don't think
they liked us?

40
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,520
I like us.
Don't you like us?

41
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,020
We're okay. All right.
Okay.

42
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,900
Here we go.
Ready? And...

43
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,740
Ugly!
Excuse me?

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,700
Not you, sweetie.
It's Mr. Sheinbaum

45
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,990
e-mailing me updates
of his double bypass.

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm glad
I skipped lunch.

47
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,080
No, no, no, this is good.
This is good,

48
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,540
because this way I don't have to go in.
We can go to dinner.

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,050
Studio apartment,
two offers already.

50
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,210
That's 'cause
you're a genius.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,670
Have you packed yet?
Your flight's at 11:00.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,340
I'm fine,
just you don't
be late.

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,340
We've got an 8:00 rez
and they're strict.

54
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,850
When am I ever late?

55
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,260
When your dad comes out of the woodwork

56
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,350
demanding to see his daughter, that's when.

57
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,600
I have to go, Jer. I haven't seen him in weeks.

58
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,980
Okay, just wouldn't want you all riled up for our very special dinner.

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,110
You know I don't like surprises.

60
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,900
You'll like this one.

61
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,200
See you.

62
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,450
Oh, Anna, this is gonna blow your mind!

63
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,580
What'd you buy?

64
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,870
A lot, I got a lot,
but that's not it.

65
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
I wanted to
tell you something.

66
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,790
Guess who I saw coming out of DePrisco's?

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,540
Who?
Jeremy!

68
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,250
You did? When?

69
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,460
On the way here.

70
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,010
The cab was stuck in traffic and I look over,

71
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,380
and he's walking
out of the store

72
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,220
carrying that little red bag.
The bag.

73
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,720
There's only one reason
people go into DePrisco's.

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,770
You're gonna have a better engagement ring
than me, you big jerk!

75
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,480
Oh, my God.
Did you know?

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,850
No. I mean, I did put his name on the mailing list
a couple months ago

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,940
hoping he'd get the hint,
but...

78
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,940
Oh! He got the hint!
I think he got the hint!

79
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,740
Okay, hold on, we gotta work on your surprise face,

80
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,780
'cause I don't want him to know I told you...

81
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
Okay, ask me.

82
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,780
Ready?
Will you marry me?

83
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,240
What? Are you scared? That was awful.
Try it again.

84
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,700
Okay.
Try it again.

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,710
Bigger eyes. And maybe a little,
"Who, me?"

86
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,540
The good news is, you have time to practice
between now and then.

87
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,510
Can I marry you?

88
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,970
No, thank you.

89
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,390
Already married, huh?

90
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,890
Getting engaged.

91
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,940
Engaged?
Dad.

92
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,480
My daughter
is engaged?

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,690
Gargon! Champagne!

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,450
Let's have a couple
of beers, banana.

95
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,660
I'll get them.

96
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,870
You're gonna
be married.

97
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,250
Jack Brady. Import-export, real estate.
Glad to meet you.

98
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,670
She's been four years with the guy.
What was he thinking?

99
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,380
I proposed to her mother
after a week!

100
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,090
I proposed to her
after half an hour.

101
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,840
Exactly!

102
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,510
Where's the lucky guy?

103
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,840
Packing. He has a cardiology
convention in Dublin.

104
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,890
It's a good thing that Jeremy
finally came around.

105
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,220
You might have had to follow him
to Ireland this weekend.

106
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,310
It is leap year,
you know.

107
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,560
Dad, do not tell
that story again.

108
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,650
Why not?

109
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,020
It's a family myth.

110
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,360
It is the
honest-to-God truth!

111
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,360
That's what Grandma Jane
did to Grandpa Tom.

112
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,740
They'd been dating for a while and
he was dragging his feet,

113
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,660
so she finally suggested they pay a visit
to the old country.

114
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,540
February 20th, Dublin, Ireland,
she hits him with it.

115
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,660
Boom!

116
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,210
Ring on finger, signed, sealed,
delivered.

117
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,840
Well, I'm not going to have to
pull a Grandma Jane.

118
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,170
That's my girl. I'm finally going to
get some grandkids.

119
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,590
Dad, I've got to go.

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,470
Mmm-mmm.
No, I just got here!

121
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,390
Yeah, well, you were late.
We said 7:00.

122
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,030
I'm just happy that we want
the same things.

123
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,900
You know, you always have it
figured out for us.

124
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,950
I mean, even with my crazy schedule and...

125
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,660
You know I appreciate it, right?

126
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,000
So...

127
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,510
So this is for you.

128
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,510
Jeremy.

129
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,160
They're earrings.
Yeah.

130
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,620
For my ears.

131
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,870
Oh! Sorry.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,540
Oh, God.
Dr. Sloane.
Hey, Bill.

133
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,250
Oh! Sounds like you're gonna have to go in from the spine.

134
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,970
Send me a photo. I'll have a look. Okay?
All right. Sorry.

135
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,720
Why don't you
try them on?

136
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,890
Oh! Sorry. Sure.

137
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,020
Yikes. There's an aorta to write home about.
Look at that.

138
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,520
Honey, not here.

139
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,610
Yummy.

140
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,610
So, I...

141
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
It's not gonna work.

142
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,750
I'm so sorry, Anna. Bill says I really
"aorta" go in.

143
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,380
Look, he actually wrote that.
He wrote "aorta."

144
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,500
So I'll pick up my bag and just go straight
to the airport when I'm done.

145
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,880
Forgive me?

146
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,630
Of course.
Okay.

147
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,100
I am so sorry.
I love you.

148
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,260
I love you.
Love you.

149
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,350
All right.

150
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,180
You "aorta" run.

151
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,300
It's a good thing that Jeremy finally came around.

152
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,510
You might have had to follow him to Ireland this weekend

153
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,680
and pull a Grandma Jane. It is leap year, you know.

154
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,980
"Leap-year proposals are an old folklore tradition

155
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,730
"that dates back to the 5th century."

156
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,770
Sure.

157
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,610
In Ireland, there's this tradition

158
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,820
that in a leap year, a woman can propose to a man on February 29th,

159
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,110
one day every four years.

160
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,370
Will you marry me?

161
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,410
Yes.

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,750
That's ridiculous.

163
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,460
Are you traveling on business or pleasure?

164
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,710
I'm going to propose to my boyfriend on leap day.

165
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,680
Are you now? Congratulations.

166
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,180
Thank you.

167
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,970
Jeremy, my boyfriend, is already there on business.

168
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,480
We've been together four years. Four years.

169
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,150
It's a long time.

170
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,950
It's not like I'm rushing anything
by doing this, you know.

171
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,780
He bought me earrings. Don't get me wrong,
they're beautiful,

172
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,160
but earrings don't exactly
say commitment.

173
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,450
Not that commitment
is an issue.

174
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,950
I mean, we're buying this apartment together
and it's perfect.

175
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,660
I know exactly how I'm going
to change it.

176
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,620
We're just gonna
knock down that wall.

177
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,580
You see? If we open up
the kitchen a little,

178
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,790
I think it flows better
into the dining area.

179
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,510
Just creates
a more free overall...

180
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

181
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,010
It looks like there's a spot of bad weather
up ahead,

182
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,180
so we may experience just a little bit
of turbulence.

183
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,820
I'm getting engaged.
I'm getting engaged.

184
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,650
I'm not gonna die
without getting engaged!

185
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,240
This is your captain here again,
ladies and gentlemen.

186
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,200
I may have underestimated
the storm just a little bit,

187
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,250
but I'm afraid we are being diverted
to Cardiff, Wales,

188
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,710
as Dublin Airport
has been shut down.

189
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,840
What?

190
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,510
Once landed, ground staff will be happy to book you
onto connecting flights

191
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,630
in order to get you
to your final destination.

192
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,930
Wales? No, we can't
land in Wales.

193
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,510
At least
we're landing.

194
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,520
Yes, but I'm on
a schedule.

195
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,780
Excuse me. Yeah, I need
to get through.

196
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,530
Cardiff, Wales Airport
regrets to announce

197
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,410
that due to
inclement weather,

198
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,330
all flights today
have been canceled.

199
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,160
I'm sorry, there's nothing very much
I can do about it.

200
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,620
I'm so sorry.

201
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,710
Yeah, could you move?

202
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,870
There are no more flights
until tomorrow.

203
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,380
No flights until tomorrow?

204
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,710
Tomorrow, madam.

205
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,750
Tomorrow.

206
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,210
I think that's what I said.
Didn't I, Beryl?

207
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,510
That is what
you said.

208
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,470
Well, no, that's not
going to work for me.

209
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,930
Look. I'm going to Dublin to propose to my boyfriend
on the 20th, leap day.

210
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,560
It's an old Irish tradition,
and I need to buy a dress

211
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,060
and find a ring
and book a restaurant.

212
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,560
So, between us girls,

213
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,230
I think you can see why I really need
to be there today.

214
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Oh! Right.
Right!

215
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,740
Beryl, will you ring
Dublin International Airport

216
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,410
and get them to open a runway
especially for madam?

217
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,830
Right away.

218
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,760
We regret to announce that all commercial
passenger ferries to Ireland

219
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,430
have been canceled.

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,600
Will all passengers booked for the crossing
to Ringaskiddy

221
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,560
please report to
the information desk?

222
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,980
Hi. I'd like a ticket
to Cork, please.

223
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,110
Ferry's canceled.

224
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,530
What is wrong
with this country?

225
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,820
I usually blame
the government,

226
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,370
but this one's the weather.
Storm, see?

227
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,210
Well, we'll just see about that.
I'll find my own boat.

228
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,390
We're going to have to go
in to Dingle.

229
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,720
But I paid for Cork!

230
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,810
Okay. Dingle will do.

231
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,410
You can take the man
out of the fish,

232
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,410
but you can't take the fish
out of the water!

233
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,330
That a good one,
Dekko?

234
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,710
Hello.

235
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,550
Are you open?

236
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,050
Australian.

237
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,260
South African.

238
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,310
Actually, she's American.
Anna, from Boston.

239
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,140
I just need someone to tell me how to
get to Dublin from here.

240
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,980
Is there a bus, maybe?

241
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,810
1987.

242
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
I'm sorry?

243
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,480
The year the last Dublin bus
left Dingle.

244
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,740
No, no, no. The train
stopped running in '67.

245
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,160
The bus stopped
running in 1989.

246
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,370
It was 1987.

247
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,620
Okay.

248
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,790
Is there a taxi service
or something?

249
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,300
Perfect. Thank you.

250
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,640
My battery's going
to die any second.

251
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,730
Ma'am.

252
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,820
Oh, thank you.

253
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,200
Hello there.

254
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,490
Hello.

255
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,590
Hello?

256
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,890
Hello. Yes, I need
a taxi to Dublin.

257
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,140
Yeah, where you
calling from?

258
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm in a funny little pub called the Carack or,
I don't know, Caragh?

259
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,520
Carahg?

260
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Whatever.

261
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,480
We don't drive
American redheads.

262
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,150
What do you mean you don't drive
American redheads?

263
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,320
How do you know
the color of my hair?

264
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,500
Of course. You're the taxi driver.
Well, I need you...

265
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,000
I need you to drive me
to Dublin.

266
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,090
Dublin, is it?

267
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,430
Well, I'll tell you something about Dublin,
Anna from Boston.

268
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:00,260
Dublin is a city of chancers and cheats
and backstabbing snakes.

269
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:06,270
It's where the worst of humanity collects
to poison this fair country.

270
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,990
I wouldn't drive you to Dublin if you were
to offer me €500.

271
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,780
Jesus! I'd sell
me wife for €500!

272
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,030
Trust me,
you'd have few takers.

273
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,870
All right. Anyone else want to go
to Dublin for 500?

274
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,790
I'm your man, missus!

275
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,750
It's bad luck to start a journey
on a Friday.

276
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,420
Saturday. It's bad luck to start a journey
on a Saturday.

277
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,510
Tuesday!

278
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,550
No, it's Sunday,
to be sure.

279
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,720
Fine. It's late.

280
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,720
I'll just find somebody to drive me
in the morning.

281
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,230
So, if one of you can direct me
to the nearest hotel?

282
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Or bed and breakfast?

283
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,990
Of course. Of course.
This is also the hotel.

284
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,450
Bathroom's down the hall. You have to flush it twice.
Seriously, twice.

285
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,960
Just like
the Four Seasons.

286
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,420
Okay.

287
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,300
I noticed a menu
on the bar?

288
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,720
It's closed.
Closed.

289
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,560
But given the famous
Irish tradition

290
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,310
of hospitality
and generosity...

291
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,980
I'll do you
a hang sandwich.

292
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,650
What's a hang?

293
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:40,280
Hang is a verb.
It's not a sandwich.

294
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,080
It did die. Of course.

295
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,550
Huh!

296
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,520
There we go.

297
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,900
Hey,
the lights are gone!

298
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,410
Oh, Jesus,
the lights failed again.

299
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,830
Women!

300
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,120
It's over now.

301
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,040
For the love of God.

302
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,890
What the hell you doing?

303
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,470
Plugging something in.

304
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,520
Give me that.
It's personal.

305
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,560
You fried my BlackBerry.

306
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,980
You fried the whole
village! Idiot!

307
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,690
Jackass.

308
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,790
You're here in Ireland?

309
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Yeah.

310
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,670
I wanted to surprise you, but it's turned into
a complete disaster.

311
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,380
At this point I'm just glad
somebody knows where I am.

312
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,430
I mean, seriously,
you have no idea what passes
for a hotel out here,

313
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,760
or common courtesy.

314
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,010
I can't wait
to see you.

315
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,390
Well, I can't wait
to see you, either.

316
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,730
Well, when will
you get here?

317
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,190
I should be there this afternoon.
I just need to get a cab.

318
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,940
Great surprise, honey.
I love you.

319
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,900
I love you, too. Bye.

320
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,400
Sorry, Declan, you've had plenty of time
to pay your debt.

321
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,320
But I'm almost there. I'm down to the last
of the bloody interest.

322
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,860
Come on, Tommo, be reasonable,
would you?

323
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,450
You can't take
the blessed kitchen!

324
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,530
You'll put me
out of business!

325
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,950
The whole lot, or the kitchen goes
in the back of the van.

326
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,580
Give me a month.

327
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,960
A month? A week.

328
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,920
A week? God!

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,800
Ten days, €900,
guaranteed.

330
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,380
A thousand, Dekko.

331
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,880
That's the old interest right there.

332
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,550
The interest on the interest on the...
Oh, man.

333
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,720
Ten days, €1,000.
Okay. Okay.

334
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,020
You'll have it.
You have my word.

335
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,310
Done.

336
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,520
Later.
All right, lads.

337
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,740
Come on, then, let's do it. But only 'cause
you're desperate.

338
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,740
I'll drive you
to Dublin.

339
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,570
Will you get out?

340
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,700
€500, like you said.
Yes or no?

341
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,160
You're not a fan
of Dublin.

342
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,080
You've made that very clear,
so I won't inconvenience you.

343
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,630
It's not inconvenient
at all.

344
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,040
What part of "get out"
do you not understand?

345
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,460
A simple yes
or no will do.

346
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,170
Yes, you can
drive me, now...

347
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,680
Good. Be outside
in 10 minutes.

348
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
God!

349
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,970
Naked here!

350
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,350
By the way, it's 100 for the room,

351
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,310
and that includes the vandalism.

352
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,930
I'll leave you to it.

353
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,270
Naked here.

354
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,420
There you are, Bob.
Hop in.

355
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,330
Please tell me that
that is the car

356
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,920
that is taking us around the corner
to the actual taxi.

357
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,930
I'll have you know that is a Renault 4.
She's classic!

358
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,680
Worst fears confirmed.

359
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,640
She's rock solid right there!
Beautiful. Come on.

360
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,350
None of those fancy airbags
to get in the way.

361
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,770
Don't listen to her.
She knows not what she says.

362
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,450
Do you mind?

363
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,620
Ah! Sure.

364
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,250
Thank you.

365
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,840
How does that work?

366
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,130
Can you be careful with that? That was a gift
from my boyfriend.

367
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,220
He bought you
a suitcase?

368
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,050
It's a Vuitton.

369
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
What?

370
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,560
A Louis Vuitton?

371
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Come on.

372
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,690
Is it yourself, Louis? Can I give you a hand
getting into the car, Louis?

373
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,280
She named her suitcase.
She's a crackpot.

374
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,990
You can't
go now, missus.

375
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,110
Why not?

376
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,700
A black cat just
crossed your path.

377
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,540
You can't start a journey
when you see a black cat.

378
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,040
Ten years bad luck.

379
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,460
No, it's not a cat,
it's a magpie.

380
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,290
Anyway, it's 15 years
bad luck.

381
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,340
Thirteen!

382
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,260
It's 12,
definitely 12.

383
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,130
Then I guess it's a good thing I don't
believe in luck, so...

384
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,100
Well, you ought to, if you're getting
into that, you.

385
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Safe journey.

386
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,980
May the road
rise up to meet you.

387
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,310
See you, lads!

388
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,480
Good luck, Declan!

389
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,860
Bye, now.

390
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,280
I tell you
something,

391
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,080
they'll kill
each other!

392
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,290
Okay,
we're here,
on the road.

393
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,630
It's only February 27th. I still have two days
to get there, so...

394
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,760
Where are we?

395
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,520
I may even get there before the stores close.
I could get some shopping in.

396
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,690
That's the reason you're going to Dublin,
is to shop?

397
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,110
No, I'm...

398
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,870
If you must know, I'm going there to
propose to my boyfriend.

399
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,750
He's at a medical conference there.
He's a cardiologist.

400
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,540
We are applying to move into the most
amazing apartment,

401
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,960
and I actually thought he was going to propose
to me the other night,

402
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
but he didn't.

403
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,130
Yeah?

404
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,380
Yeah, and you guys have
this great tradition

405
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,220
that a woman can
propose to a man

406
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,760
on the 20th of February
in a leap year.

407
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,310
Yeah?
Yeah.

408
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,140
So I thought,
"Why not?"

409
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,350
Yeah!

410
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,520
Yeah.

411
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,230
I mean...

412
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,570
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

413
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,700
No, it isn't.

414
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,160
Yeah, it is.

415
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,580
No, it's a tradition.
It's a romantic tradition.

416
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,420
It's a day for desperate women trying to
trap themselves a man

417
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,840
who clearly doesn't
want to get married.

418
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,260
You've got to know that if your man
wanted to propose,

419
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,140
he'd have done it
already. Fact!

420
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,460
No one touches the music!

421
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,760
Are you crazy? You know nothing
about me or Jeremy!

422
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,800
You know what you are?
You're a cynic.

423
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,050
You're a lonely,
bitter cynic.

424
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,600
Better that than an idiot.
"Leap year, diddly-eye!

425
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
"Will you marry me,
diddly-eye?

426
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,560
"I've got a suitcase
called Louis, diddly-eye!"

427
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,860
What are you, the Lucky Charms
leprechaun?

428
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,770
You know what? We are done.
We're not talking anymore.

429
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,610
I'm not paying you to talk, I'm not paying
for your opinion.

430
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,360
I'm paying you to drive, so just
get in the car and drive.

431
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,950
Suits me, Bob.

432
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,660
And what is with
this Bob thing?

433
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,630
Aren't you going
to do something?

434
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,510
I am doing something. I'm waiting
for them to move.

435
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,760
For God's sake.

436
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,010
Hi, cows.

437
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,390
Look, I have spent the past 24 hours
in every level of hell,

438
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,230
and I am not going to let
your black and white asses

439
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,610
drag me any further, so if you know what's good
for you, you'll move.

440
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,030
It comes as a real shock to find out
that you speak fluent cow.

441
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,150
Now!

442
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,280
That's right.
Nice cows.

443
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,200
Let's move. Let's move along.
Come on, cows.

444
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,870
Why don't you propose something
to them?

445
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,250
Yeah, you guys are...
Wow, you're big.

446
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,340
We're gonna just...

447
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,880
Oh, yeah,
they're moving now.

448
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,670
Must be your personality.

449
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,090
Yours is a bit
more repellent,

450
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,220
so if you want to try...

451
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,770
That's right. That's how
you get things done.

452
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,520
That's it, girl!

453
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,520
That's right! That is how
you get things done.

454
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,360
You don't just sit around like some
backwoods Irish bumpkin.

455
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,820
You're welcome.

456
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,660
You might want to
just watch your

457
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,330
step.

458
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,340
$600 shoes.

459
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,590
Put them in the wash,
they'll be grand.

460
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,010
Put them in the wash?
The wash?

461
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,890
You do not put
these shoes in the wash.

462
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,310
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

463
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,220
Stop!
Whoa! Wait!

464
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,430
Stop it!
What do I do?

465
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,980
Get in the car
and use the brake!

466
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,480
Baby!
I got you, baby!
I got you!

467
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,030
Baby!

468
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,660
Don't hurt yourself!

469
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,240
Make it stop!
My purse is in there!

470
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,100
Oh, darling.
Oh, Jesus.

471
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,230
My Renault 4!
Look what you done!

472
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,400
What I've done?

473
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,110
You couldn't just
wait for the cows!

474
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,230
You couldn't
just help me?

475
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,320
It's gonna cost at least
200 to tow her out.

476
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,700
That's not gonna come out of my pocket.
It's coming out of yours!

477
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,120
Oh, like hell. You will have to kill me
before I pay you a dime!

478
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,000
There's an idea.

479
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,010
Where you going?

480
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,090
Dublin.

481
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Look, this is an easy fix.

482
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
All we need to do
is find a phone,

483
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,350
call the garage, get a tow,
hop in the car,

484
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,400
back on the road and we'll be in Dublin
in no time.

485
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,150
Just cool the jets,
would you?

486
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,060
Wait! Hey!

487
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,640
I wouldn't
get in there
if I was you!

488
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,650
And I care about
your opinion because...

489
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,150
Fine, go ahead.

490
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,070
All right there, sweetheart?
Hi.

491
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,160
You looking
for a ride?

492
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,950
Yes, I'm going
to Dublin.

493
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,410
In Dublin's fair city
where the girls are so pretty

494
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,750
Yes.
Now there's a coincidence,

495
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,210
'cause I'm going
there myself.

496
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,250
Let me help you with
the old suitcase there.

497
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,420
That's very sweet of you.

498
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,590
Not at all.

499
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,750
And I didn't
even have to ask.

500
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,920
Top of the morning to you!

501
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,260
Oh! Morning.

502
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,470
That's a fancy bit of suitcase,
no mistake.

503
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,100
It's quality. You can see that just by
looking at it, you know?

504
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,360
Well, I'd say
it's been a pleasure,

505
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,270
but I think
we both know that...

506
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,280
Wait. No! Wait! Wait! Come back here!
You can't just...

507
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,500
They...

508
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,660
There you are.

509
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,830
Soon as I finish this,
I'll call us a tow truck.

510
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,080
Us? There is no us.

511
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,330
I am calling a real taxi.
You leave me alone.

512
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,000
Okay, Bob.

513
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,670
Excuse me.

514
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,800
Eoghan?

515
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,140
Eoghan.

516
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,230
Do you have a phone, please?
Please?

517
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,860
Thank you.

518
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,320
Safe home.

519
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,870
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,220
So nice of you to look after
my suitcase,

521
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,850
but I'll take it back.
Thank you.

522
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,810
Is that right, missus?

523
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,480
I'll call the
American ambassador.

524
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,810
Oh, is this his?

525
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,820
Well, I just...

526
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,360
I...

527
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,910
Fun's over, lads.

528
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,660
Give the girl her stuff back.

529
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,250
And who the hell are you?

530
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,670
Nobody. Just keeping the peace.

531
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,800
Yeah? Well, you can keep
your peace out of it.

532
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,580
That was

533
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,830
impressive.

534
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,460
Out.

535
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,050
Fair enough.

536
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,640
Hi. I just...

537
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,140
Should just get my things and go.

538
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,270
Must be something special.

539
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,730
Who?

540
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,780
Your fella.

541
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,740
Jeremy. He is.

542
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,990
He's...

543
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,160
He's a cardiologist.

544
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,720
Hi. When is the next train
to Dublin?

545
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,930
You're just in time.

546
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,400
The next train leaves
in two hours and 43 minutes.

547
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,810
Great.

548
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,230
It's a few bob
to Dublin, mind.

549
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,820
"Bob"?

550
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,110
Cash.

551
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,780
Money. You know?

552
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,630
Hey, fella.

553
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,140
Ballycarbery.

554
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,310
Mmm. Same to you.

555
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,440
There.
Ballycarbery Castle.

556
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,900
It's one of the 10 wonders of Ireland,
so I'm told.

557
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,820
Can only be 15 minutes to the top.

558
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,030
I don't want to
miss the train.

559
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,860
Yeah, well, that's a good point.
Don't miss the train.

560
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,950
No.

561
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,700
Only two and a half hours.

562
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,370
Time is going to fly.

563
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,040
I'll stay here.

564
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,920
Suit yourself.

565
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,170
I will.

566
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,180
Hi.

567
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,100
Hi.

568
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,150
Declan?

569
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,480
Wait! I love castles.

570
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,650
It's beautiful.

571
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,280
I'm sorry you're not gonna get to Dublin before the shops shut.

572
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,080
I have other interests besides shopping.

573
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,290
I have a life.
A job.

574
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,250
What do you do, then?

575
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,040
I stage apartments.

576
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,000
Stage apartments,
now that's...

577
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,340
That's...

578
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,880
What's that?

579
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,850
Well, when somebody is selling an apartment or a home,

580
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,520
I bring stuff in and make it look
as beautiful as it can look.

581
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,150
And they get to keep all the stuff
when they buy it?

582
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,860
No, I take it away. I'm just presenting them
with the possibilities.

583
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,110
I put a sheen on it.

584
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,860
Hang on. So you do
your job, yeah?

585
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,030
Yeah.

586
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,780
They buy the house,
yeah?

587
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,910
Yeah.

588
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,870
And then you come along and you take all the stuff
away again, yeah?

589
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,080
Yeah.

590
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,920
You're a con artist.

591
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,790
No, I'm not a con...

592
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,670
That's just so typical of you.

593
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,380
You think the worst of everybody.

594
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,510
No.

595
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,300
Oh, no? I'd love to know who you have
a good word for.

596
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,640
I can think of a couple
of good words for you.

597
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,270
Riddle me this.

598
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,810
If your apartment's on fire,
your beautiful apartment,

599
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,520
what would you take?

600
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,690
What?

601
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,700
If your house was on fire
and you had 60 seconds,

602
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,990
what would you take?
Come on.

603
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,530
I...

604
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,790
Come on. Would it be the Chihuahua
on the duvet?

605
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,210
I'm not playing
this game with you.

606
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,790
There you are.

607
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,250
What would you take?

608
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,800
What would you take? Your lovely inn is on fire.

609
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,720
What are you going to take?
You know, your...

610
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,970
Flames coming up the stairs.
You've got 60 seconds.

611
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,930
The bottles of alcohol
in your pub are exploding.

612
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,600
What are you
going to grab?

613
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,770
I know exactly
what I'd "grab."

614
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,400
Oh, yeah? What?

615
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,740
Not telling you.

616
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,620
You can dish it, but you can't
take it, can you?

617
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,870
It's really...

618
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,000
It's a castle!

619
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,670
Told you.

620
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,920
So what's the story
with this place?

621
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,130
Well, hundreds
of years ago,

622
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,850
there was this beautiful girl
called Grainne.

623
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,390
Now, she was promised in marriage to this fella
called Fionn,

624
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,360
who was kind of a cranky old warlord,

625
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,820
old enough to be her father, old enough to be
her grandfather,

626
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
and therefore

627
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,950
she wasn't
in love with him.

628
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,030
Anyway, on the night
of their betrothal,

629
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:59,540
whom did she meet but a handsome
young warrior, Diarmuid.

630
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,960
They fell madly in love at first sight,
but what could she do?

631
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,790
Well, she slips a sleeping potion
in everyone's drinks,

632
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,420
and the pair of them run off together
across the Shannon.

633
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,930
Fionn wakes and there's Grainne gone.
Well, he goes mental.

634
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,390
Takes his army and heads off
in hot pursuit.

635
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:25,230
But it was the people, you know, the people
in the villages of Ireland,

636
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,060
they took pity on
Diarmuid and Grainne.

637
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,980
They hid them in forests and in their barns
and castles,

638
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,570
where they'd sleep one night
and then they'd move on.

639
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,280
Come on.

640
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,330
Is it safe?

641
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,410
Of course.

642
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,080
Sleep was all they did, 'cause Diarmuid,
good man that he was,

643
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,420
was suffering the old guilt
about two-timing Fionn

644
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,800
and out of respect for him, didn't, you know,
take it any further.

645
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,180
I get it.
Oh, yeah.

646
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,520
And then they came
to this castle

647
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,190
and this view.

648
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,570
Wow.

649
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,280
And 'tis said, you know, that, unable to
resist such beauty,

650
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,320
that here,

651
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,740
in this place, they...

652
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,960
They consummated
their love.

653
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,510
Oh, my God.
You're hitting on me.

654
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,140
I'm what?

655
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,680
I'm the young woman on the eve
of her engagement

656
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,850
that can't resist a handsome stranger?
Oh, come on.

657
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,270
I'm what?

658
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,820
You didn't honestly think
that was gonna work, did you?

659
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,690
Don't flatter yourself, darling.
The story's true,

660
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,240
but it sure as shite
ain't about you.

661
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,280
No?
No, you arrogant...

662
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,080
Arrogant what exactly?

663
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,830
Well, that's a tough one.
Is it American?

664
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh, no. The train.

665
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,840
Wait! Wait,
I have a ticket!

666
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,670
I'm very...

667
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,430
You just had to take me
up there, didn't you?

668
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,060
One of the seven
wonders of Ireland!

669
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,360
Okay.

670
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,110
Oh, no.

671
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,340
Well, that speeded
things up a bit.

672
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,300
I hate you.

673
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,990
In the old days, I could have
held it for you,

674
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,740
but it's all "time is money"
nowadays.

675
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,200
Come on, now. Come on, and don't
be worrying yourself.

676
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,460
We'll get you to
where you want to go.

677
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,470
Forecast said sunny.

678
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,980
Here we are. The best little
BQB in Tipperary.

679
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,570
Come in. Come in.

680
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,790
Look what
the cat dragged in.

681
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,330
Oh! My poor dears.

682
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,370
You're lucky,
so you are.

683
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,920
Just half an hour ago, I had two backpackers
at the door

684
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,630
wanting the room.

685
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
But they weren't married.

686
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,510
Admitted it right out.
No shame.

687
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,090
So I sent them packing.

688
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,010
Right is right,
rain or no rain.

689
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,940
So, it's Mr. and Mrs...

690
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,900
Brady.
O'Callaghan.

691
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,520
Bradycallaghan.

692
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,570
O'Bradycallaghan.

693
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,610
We're not long married, and it's still quite
a mouthful for an American.

694
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,530
I come from a long,
long line of Dingle

695
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,330
O'Bradycallaghans.

696
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,290
We're praying
that one day

697
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,580
we'll be able to have a son and heir to help
keep the name going.

698
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,960
Anna, Declan to you.

699
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,420
Lovely. Now, let's get you
to your room.

700
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,880
Thank you.

701
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,090
After you, petal.

702
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,130
Thank you, sunshine.

703
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,180
Would you like a hand
with the bag, pumpkin?

704
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:21,070
Well, you're not sleeping in that bed with me,
Mr. O'Bradycallaghan.

705
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,530
Maybe you're not sleeping
in the bed with me.

706
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,530
Very gallant.
Gallant?

707
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,030
Welcome to the age
of equality.

708
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,160
You lot wanted the vote.
Live with it, darling.

709
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,000
Comfy.

710
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,210
We'll flip for it, darling.

711
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,170
Okay, fair's fair.

712
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,220
Heads I win,
tails you lose.

713
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,600
Heads.

714
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,350
Heads it is.

715
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,220
Shame. You can sleep

716
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,390
in the bath.

717
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,700
It's a shower.

718
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,740
You can sleep
in the shower.

719
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,160
Fine.

720
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:18,870
Just so long as I don't have to sleep
anywhere near you.

721
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,800
I'm washing in the shower

722
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,510
Getting mud off
Love hot water

723
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,930
Got a bruise there
Got a bruise there

724
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,690
Wait a minute. You lying,
deceiving son of a...

725
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,730
Get up! Get up.
Get up.

726
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,480
Whoa! What?

727
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,440
Oh! "Heads you win,
tails I lose."

728
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,200
You finally
got that, did you?

729
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,780
Good for you.

730
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,530
Up! Get up! This is my bed.
Liars forfeit.

731
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,080
And take a shower.

732
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,160
You smell.

733
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,500
You can see right
through the curtain.

734
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,790
Can you?

735
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,880
Can you?

736
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,510
Okay,
liars forfeit,
liars forfeit!

737
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,090
No peeking.

738
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,010
Come in.

739
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,970
Hello, dear.
Everything all right?

740
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,310
Now, for dinner
we've got tripe.
Homemade. Family recipe.

741
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,650
Tripe.

742
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,190
Nothing like a bit of cow's stomach
on a rainy day.

743
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,990
Yum. Did you hear that,
darling? Tripe!

744
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,360
Right, tripe.

745
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,910
I was thinking,
Mrs. O'Docherty,

746
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,370
to thank you for taking us in
on such short notice,

747
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,290
why don't you
let me cook?

748
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,830
No, darling,
I couldn't.

749
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:43,080
Oh, you could. He's a chef.
He's very good.

750
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,420
It's true!

751
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,170
Really?
Well, that's gas.

752
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,920
We've got two Italians staying, as well.
Would that be okay?

753
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,680
No problem at all!

754
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,510
Thanks a million.

755
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,220
Good call.

756
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,620
What the hell are you doing now?

757
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,960
This recipe says
three medium carrots,

758
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,500
and I just think this one is a little large
to be classified as medium.

759
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,800
And if you look
at these two,

760
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,590
they're clearly medium, while this one
is slightly...

761
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,180
Watch.

762
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,600
Three medium-sized carrots.

763
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:47,400
You know, I don't think there's anything wrong
with wanting to be precise.

764
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,860
Okay.

765
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,730
Well, then
you must be very,

766
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,990
very precise.

767
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,660
Here's an idea.

768
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,080
Why don't you stop trying to control everything
in the known universe?

769
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,580
It's dinner.
Have a little faith.

770
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,120
It'll all work out.

771
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,500
Heard that one before.

772
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,130
Well, maybe you
should have listened.

773
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,670
Really? You think?

774
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:16,220
lt'll all work out. My dad was the king
of "it'll all work out."

775
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,010
Time shares in the Bahamas,
mobile video stores,

776
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,300
whatever the next
big nothing was,

777
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,350
all our money
went right after it.

778
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,520
But don't worry.
It'll all work out.

779
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,110
Cut to me working two part-time jobs
after school

780
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,240
and us getting our house repossessed on Christmas Eve.
Ho, ho, ho.

781
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,490
So you will forgive me
if I don't listen.

782
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,120
I'm sorry.

783
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,290
No, I'm sorry.

784
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,760
A father's someone you should be able
to rely on, you know?

785
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,060
Anyway, dinner.

786
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,400
We have got
cabbages, a leek,

787
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,150
three medium carrots.

788
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,110
You're not one of those
vegetarians, are you?

789
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,240
No.

790
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,780
Good.

791
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,820
Declan one,
chicken nil.

792
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:24,700
Sweet.

793
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,080
Coq au vin?

794
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,380
What?

795
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,130
Give me strength.

796
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,640
Don't start telling me that you've never had
chicken stew before.

797
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,850
Of course I have.

798
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,400
I'm wondering where it is that you think
chickens come from.

799
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,610
The freezer section.

800
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,330
I know, I know. I...

801
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,000
You just surprised me.

802
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,410
You keep doing that.

803
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,300
Give me the carrots.

804
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,880
Yes, carrots.

805
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,260
Sorry.

806
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,890
We build up the temperature
a little bit.

807
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,810
You don't need to chop them.
It's hard to hold.

808
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,690
That smells amazing.

809
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,230
Good girl. And...

810
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,090
So this is what you call staging,
is it?

811
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,600
Sort of.

812
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,930
Not too shabby.

813
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,600
Here?
Yeah.

814
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:27,950
Impeccable.

815
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,910
The chicken
was wonderful.

816
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,540
Wasn't it? And I'm usually
awful at chicken.

817
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,540
Jeremy always says
I make it too dry.

818
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,790
Jeremy?

819
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,510
Jeremy. Our...

820
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,260
Our next door neighbor.

821
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,760
Who sometimes
comes by for dinner.

822
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,850
Right, Declan?

823
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,390
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.
He's a lovely old soul.

824
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,560
Yeah.

825
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,560
A little bit learning difficulties,
you know.

826
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,310
Tells everyone he's a cardiologist.
It's a scream.

827
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,230
But he's a happy chap,
you know.

828
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,230
He's got a little thing,
bless him, for her.

829
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,700
Antique, Frank?

830
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,820
Antique, yeah. Like me.

831
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,450
Wedding present,
they were.

832
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,160
It's only 44 years,
you cheeky rascal!

833
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:33,470
See?
That's what it takes
to be married for 44 years.

834
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,680
The kiss.

835
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:39,270
Always kiss like it's the first time
and the last time.

836
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,830
Grand.

837
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,670
Well, come on then, son.

838
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,140
Show us old ones
how it's done.

839
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,890
Sorry?

840
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,850
Well, I've kissed
my wife.

841
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,730
Stefano has certainly
kissed his wife.

842
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,400
No, we're fine. We did it
earlier, kiss.

843
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,150
Done and dusted.

844
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,400
A bit of chivalry, man.
You know what I'm saying?

845
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,450
Oh! That's perfect.

846
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:34,660
If that was a kiss, I'm surprised you're still
wed to him at all.

847
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,080
No, no, they're shy,
that's all.

848
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,910
Yes. Really shy.

849
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,170
You're among friends!

850
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,420
You're young,
married, in love!

851
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,880
Anyone can see that.

852
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,800
Damn it, man.

853
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,260
Kiss the girl!

854
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,830
Bravo!
There you go.

855
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,750
Now that's a kiss!

856
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,220
It's quite wet.

857
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,060
Show a little mercy,
would you?

858
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:46,900
All right.

859
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,190
But one snore and you're back
in the shower.

860
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,440
Great.

861
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,840
Who'd have thought it'd take two days
to get to Dublin?

862
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,420
I have to charge you
an overnighter, by the way.

863
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:12,670
Surprise.

864
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,550
€100.
Fifty.

865
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:19,600
Seventy-five it is.
Running total €675.

866
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,690
Fine.
If it's all about money
for you, then 675 it is.

867
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,860
Good night.

868
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,200
Night.

869
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,970
I'm so sorry
I'm not there yet.

870
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,810
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

871
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,980
Worse than when they lost
our luggage in Barbados?

872
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,810
Like that times 10.

873
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,860
I just... I just
can't wait to see you.

874
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,440
Well, maybe this
will cheer you up.

875
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,410
I just heard from the board,
and we got the apartment!

876
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,450
What?
Yeah.

877
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:44,200
I just got off the phone
with Edith. It's ours.

878
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,080
Ah! Jeremy!

879
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,910
That is exactly what I needed
to hear this morning.

880
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,540
Everything is working out for us.
I'm so excited.

881
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,790
We'll have to celebrate in person
when you get here.

882
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,880
We sure will.

883
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,420
Hurry up already.
I miss you.

884
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,130
I miss you, too.

885
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,700
Morning.

886
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,200
Yeah.

887
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,030
Oh, is this for me?

888
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,490
Yeah.

889
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,080
Morning, lovebirds!

890
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,710
Sleep well, did you?

891
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,580
Yes, thank you.

892
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,090
So, what's on
the agenda today, then?

893
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,470
Mmm. Off to Dublin
for me.

894
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,720
Well, you can't
do that now.

895
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:44,970
Why not?

896
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,220
This is Sunday.

897
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,100
Never start a journey on a Sunday,
or a full moon.

898
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:53,100
Oh, well, I don't believe
in that superstition stuff.

899
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:57,070
How are you on train timetables?
Do you believe in them?

900
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,400
Sunday.

901
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,700
No trains.

902
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,950
No trains?
No.

903
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,120
Oh! For God's sake.

904
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,040
I have to be in Dublin by the 20th.
That's tomorrow.

905
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,000
Why is that
again, darling?

906
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,760
Fine. Okay.

907
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,590
Frank,
you have a car,
don't you?

908
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,260
Oh, yes.
Yes.

909
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,930
Okay. I could...

910
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:33,390
I would be willing to pay you
a substantial amount of money

911
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,600
if you would
maybe drive me.

912
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,320
No.

913
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,030
Oh! It's not
the money, girl.
It's Eileen.

914
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,700
She's got it.
Gone to Mass.

915
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,530
Then the weekly shop,
you know.

916
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,410
Okay, well, then
when she's back, you...

917
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,910
She won't be back
till all hours.

918
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Why?

919
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,630
It's a fair old jaunt
to Dublin.

920
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,460
Where is she?

921
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,800
Dublin.

922
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,640
Bingo!

923
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,780
What?

924
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,330
Bus station's
that way.

925
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,130
What?

926
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,510
Knock it off.

927
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,890
It's hailstones.

928
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:00,940
Are you serious?

929
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,270
Ow!
Run!

930
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,650
Come on. It's fecking
Murphy's Law with you.

931
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,410
Come on!

932
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,530
I got Louis.
Don't worry.

933
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,540
Those sting!

934
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:17,870
The size
of golf balls!

935
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,830
Jesus Christ!

936
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,420
Is Lord.

937
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,510
Have you any just cause or impediment why
this man and this woman

938
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,720
should not be joined together
in holy matrimony?

939
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:36,270
No, no, Father.
You carry on.

940
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,980
I'm sure that they know
what they're doing.

941
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,860
Good. In that case, you're very welcome.
Why don't you sit down?

942
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,450
Come on. Dublin. We should
be making tracks.

943
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,700
No.
The priest is gonna
give us a ride

944
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,240
to the bus station
when it's over.

945
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,330
We can walk!

946
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:00,580
I'm not walking another four hours
in these shoes.

947
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:03,460
Besides, look how beautiful
it all is.

948
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,760
I kind of
hate weddings.

949
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:11,760
Why? Because people are in love?
That's so offensive to you?

950
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,050
Yeah.

951
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,140
You know,

952
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:21,310
you have all of these random opinions
and a bad attitude.

953
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,560
What do you know? You're clearly
not married,

954
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,440
and you have obviously
never been engaged.

955
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,690
Actually, I have.

956
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,150
Once.

957
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,450
I don't want to
interrupt a good party,

958
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:42,170
but I want to say
thank you to my husband.

959
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:48,420
I want to say, may you never steal,
lie or cheat.

960
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,260
But if you must steal,

961
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,510
then steal away
my sorrows.

962
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,640
And if you must lie,

963
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:01,020
lie with me all the nights
of my life.

964
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,230
And if you must cheat,
then please cheat death,

965
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,690
because I couldn't
live a day without you.

966
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,490
Cheers!

967
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,840
Are you all right?

968
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,850
Grand. You know,
it's just hot in there.

969
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,350
Do you want
to talk about it?

970
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:44,940
Listen,

971
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,980
Bob.

972
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,440
You're not
in America now.

973
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,570
You're in Ireland.
So, have a drink.

974
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,070
Shut up.

975
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,280
I was just
trying to help.

976
01:05:58,370 --> 01:05:59,740
Help?
Yeah.

977
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,830
That's hilarious.

978
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,870
The woman who's so desperate, she's diddly-eying
her way to Dublin,

979
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,000
making the most important decision
of her life

980
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,750
based on some
ridiculous tradition,

981
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,460
which, frankly,
is a load of old poo.

982
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:17,840
So, thank you, but it's not I
who needs the help, okay?

983
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:24,230
It is not a load of poo.

984
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:28,230
It's romantic.

985
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,570
It's really,
really romantic.

986
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,110
I'm not good
at weddings.

987
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,860
They're better with
a couple martinis.

988
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,660
Okay, thank you very much!

989
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:25,450
We're going to do a special request
now for the bridesmaids.

990
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:26,870
Want a go?

991
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,750
No. No, I don't...
I don't Riverdance.

992
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:33,380
Do you never let
your hair down, woman?

993
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:36,800
Yes.

994
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,800
In my way, I do.

995
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,470
Good.

996
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,640
Now, this is an easy one. You'll pick it up.
Just follow them.

997
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,980
We're going in a circle
going that way.

998
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,700
No, no,
put me down!

999
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:07,180
I'm really sorry.

1000
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,220
I was spinning.

1001
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,850
Forget about it. At least
it wasn't my husband.

1002
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,150
Yeah. Right.
At least it wasn't him.

1003
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:23,740
I'm...

1004
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,870
I thought
I was bad at weddings.

1005
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,850
Aren't you supposed to be
taking me to Dublin?

1006
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,560
Well, just tell me when. As ever,
your servant awaits.

1007
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,450
You know what,
Declan?

1008
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,320
Do you know
what you are?

1009
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:11,910
You're a beast.

1010
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,830
You're a real

1011
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:18,250
beast.

1012
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,800
And I cannot
stand you.

1013
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,630
Really?

1014
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,970
But you know what?

1015
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,720
I'm onto you.

1016
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,220
Is that right?

1017
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:35,310
All your beastishness
is like...

1018
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,150
It's an act.

1019
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:41,610
It's a great, big,
massive cover-up.

1020
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:48,910
And you growl and you snap,
but you are in...

1021
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,870
You're in pain.

1022
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,040
And you've got a...

1023
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:05,510
You've got a big thorn
in your beasty paw.

1024
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,220
Like a lion.

1025
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,890
A lovely, lovely lion.

1026
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,740
Great.
I'm sorry.

1027
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:34,160
That's romantic.

1028
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,080
Up you come. Up!

1029
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,790
God, you're a lump.

1030
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,090
My suitcase!

1031
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:46,460
Don't worry about Louis.
I'll get him.

1032
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,720
You're joking me.

1033
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,150
Perfect.

1034
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,930
You can deduct the coffee
from my bill.

1035
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:08,730
Deduct away. Don't forget to add on
for a new pair of shoes,

1036
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,780
Pukey.

1037
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,990
Put them in the wash,
they'll be grand.

1038
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,950
You missed your bus.

1039
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,670
There's another one
in 20 minutes.

1040
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:27,830
Oh, God. Am I still
coming with you?

1041
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,460
I am paying you
to take me to Dublin

1042
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:32,170
and you're taking me
to Dublin.

1043
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,960
That's fine.
Thank you.

1044
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:14,840
He's out.

1045
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,630
I left a message
with the front desk.

1046
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:23,850
So, Dublin.

1047
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,430
Right on time.

1048
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,190
So I suppose
I should pay you.

1049
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:31,060
I suppose you should.

1050
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,770
There'll be an ATM
at the hotel.

1051
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,440
Right, so I'll be
portering again, will I?

1052
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,030
Not if you don't
want to.

1053
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:37,610
I didn't say that.

1054
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,700
We can get a cab.

1055
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,700
You've got legs,
haven't you, woman?

1056
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,780
My best feature,
so I'm told.

1057
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,950
Who told you that?

1058
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,960
It's a beautiful city.

1059
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,170
And I haven't seen
one backstabbing snake.

1060
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:59,590
Yeah, well, it's the chancers
and cheats that you have to watch out for.

1061
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:14,820
She's here,
isn't she?

1062
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,820
In Dublin. One of the chancers and cheats.

1063
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,740
The blonde in the photo.

1064
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:25,990
Who was the guy?

1065
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,710
So him and her...

1066
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,000
Right.

1067
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,170
Sorry.

1068
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,890
We were all running the Caragh together, me, Kaleigh, Ryan.

1069
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:49,390
So we bought the pub and built it up from nothing.

1070
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,270
We really got it going.
I mean, we were flying.

1071
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,530
And I thought that me and Kaleigh
were mad for each other.

1072
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,740
Apparently not.

1073
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:10,540
So that thing I'd grab
if I had 60 seconds,

1074
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:14,630
it's my mother's
Claddagh ring.

1075
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,050
You know, the ones with the two hands
holding the crowned heart.

1076
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,380
Well, she's got it.

1077
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,510
Well, you're here now. You should find her
and get it back.

1078
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,470
I don't know.

1079
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,020
It's your mother's ring.

1080
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,520
Anyway, I thought
it was your ring

1081
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,810
we were meant to be
worrying about.

1082
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,230
Diddly-eye.

1083
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,900
Oh, yeah. Right.

1084
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:43,740
Well, I'm glad to see
you're finally on board.

1085
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:48,450
It has nothing to do with me. I'm just the old bag carrier
around here.

1086
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,200
Why should I care?

1087
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:52,910
So you don't?

1088
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,380
Would it make
a difference?

1089
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,760
Come on.

1090
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,620
So.

1091
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,330
So.

1092
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,960
Here.
Nah, it's okay.

1093
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,630
Declan, take it.
We had a deal. Please?

1094
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:50,050
Tell you what. Why don't you just give me that one bob
and we'll call it a day?

1095
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,640
Which one bob?

1096
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:55,350
The one we flipped
for the bed.

1097
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,600
Yeah.

1098
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,150
Liar.

1099
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:10,490
Well, best of luck.
Yeah.

1100
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,750
So long, Louis.

1101
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,980
Anna.

1102
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,350
Yes?

1103
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,190
Anna! Anna!

1104
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,650
Hi! Finally. God.

1105
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:47,110
I thought I was gonna have to call a helicopter rescue team
to come get you.

1106
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:48,700
Where have you been? Hi.
Hey.

1107
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,700
Long story.
Sorry.

1108
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,030
It's good
to see you.

1109
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,120
You okay? Yeah?
Mmm. Yeah.

1110
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,200
Hi.

1111
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,120
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

1112
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,550
Jeremy, this is Declan.
Declan drove...

1113
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,510
He helped me get
from Dingle to Dublin.

1114
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:10,720
Oh! Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, well,
I don't envy that job.

1115
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:13,390
This lady is not
big on adventure.

1116
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:15,970
No.

1117
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,180
Nice to meet you, bro.

1118
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,890
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Yeah.

1119
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,860
So did she
take care of you?

1120
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:27,400
Did you tip him?

1121
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,990
She paid me.

1122
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:35,160
Great. Well, thanks for
getting her home safe.

1123
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,410
Oh, God, I missed you! I missed you!
I missed you! I missed you!

1124
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,160
I missed you, too.

1125
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,250
No, I really
missed you.

1126
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,080
I did. And...

1127
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,750
And it got me thinking.

1128
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,880
Why aren't we married?

1129
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,140
Will you marry me?

1130
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,520
Are you serious?

1131
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,900
Am I serious? Yeah. Well, I'm down
on my knee. I...

1132
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:07,070
I got this.

1133
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,990
No pressure,
but it's all on camera.

1134
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,880
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart.

1135
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,090
Sweetie?

1136
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,760
I... Were you supposed
to give me an answer?

1137
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,970
Yes. Of course.

1138
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,560
Yeah?
Yes.

1139
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,140
Okay.
Let's try this on.

1140
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:47,860
Ah! It fits!

1141
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,360
I have champagne
waiting in the room,

1142
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,030
so we should go on up.
Great.

1143
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,990
Thank you.

1144
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,330
I never thought
I'd see you in Dublin.

1145
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,130
Declan.

1146
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,010
Kaleigh.

1147
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:11,230
There you go. And there's pints.
They're on the way.

1148
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,150
Thank you!
You are saving the pub.

1149
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,070
You're keeping the pans in the kitchen.
I will kiss you later.

1150
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,070
Congratulations! Hi!

1151
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:19,990
Let me see it!

1152
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,420
Dekko.

1153
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,250
Tom. There you are.

1154
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:35,590
You're short.

1155
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,920
But not by much.

1156
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:39,180
Sorry. Come on, lads!

1157
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,720
Oh, my God,
look at this place!

1158
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,810
Do you like it?
Do I like it?

1159
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:46,930
I want to throw you out of your own window
and take it.

1160
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,100
Hold on a minute there.

1161
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:56,610
You can show us the color of your wallet for a change.

1162
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,250
That's all.

1163
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,500
Drinks on the house!

1164
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:15,880
I feel like your whole happy ending

1165
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,300
is gonna be a real test
for our friendship.

1166
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:19,470
I'm pretty sure she would
have been happy

1167
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:21,640
with just this apartment. I don't think you needed to propose.

1168
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,640
Oh! It was kind of
a package deal.

1169
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,520
Really?
What, buy an apartment,
they throw in a ring?

1170
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,890
More like
the other way around.

1171
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,810
What do you mean?

1172
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:32,560
Well, I think it was
Edith, from the board.

1173
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:35,570
She called me in Dublin, probing about
our marital status.

1174
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:40,650
Can you believe that? Nothing specific,
just interested, you know?

1175
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:43,240
Like the residents, they're kind of old-fashioned

1176
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,080
when it comes to issues like this.
Blah, blah, blah.

1177
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:50,370
I got the message. Married, you're in.
Unmarried, you're not.

1178
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:54,250
So I just said we were hours away
from getting engaged.

1179
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,920
I just said it and it came out.

1180
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,840
And I don't know where it came from,

1181
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,010
but I could almost hear them
cutting our keys.

1182
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,760
So I put down the phone
and thought,

1183
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:07,100
"Well, why the hell not, you know?"

1184
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,600
Really?
Sure. I mean,

1185
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,270
we'd have gotten around
to it eventually, right?

1186
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,230
Right. Of course.
Yeah.

1187
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,400
Yeah.

1188
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,030
Oh, Libby, I want
to show you this view.

1189
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:19,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

1190
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:21,860
It's gorgeous.
Okay.

1191
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,200
Is that the fire alarm?
Really?

1192
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:13,870
Okay, everybody, I guess we'd better take
this party downstairs.

1193
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,880
The phones.

1194
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:28,640
Where is the remote
for this thing?

1195
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,100
These things are useless
without the remote. Anna!

1196
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,430
Do you have
everything you need?

1197
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,350
Can you just look
around for valuables?

1198
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,560
For laptops,
cameras, whatever.

1199
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:42,230
I think the cameras... Okay, here's
the video camera.

1200
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,190
I still haven't put the proposal
up on Facebook,

1201
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,030
so let me get that.

1202
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:50,160
Oh, sweetie,
can you get the...

1203
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:51,790
Anna?

1204
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,660
Anna?

1205
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:16,810
We have one minestrone soup,
two quiche,

1206
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,900
one pie beef, one pie chicken,
one green salad. Go, go, go.

1207
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,270
Dekko?

1208
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,230
A customer said
the chicken's dry.

1209
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,280
The what's what?

1210
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,900
The chicken.
It's dry.

1211
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,660
It's a pie.

1212
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,410
It's delicious.

1213
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,580
Alex, you're in charge.
Don't blow anything up.

1214
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:50,890
All right, which one of you bollockses thinks
my chicken's dry?

1215
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,180
You?

1216
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:54,600
You?

1217
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:55,890
Me.

1218
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,700
What the hell
are you doing here?

1219
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,950
Could you maybe be nice
for just a second?

1220
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,580
I did fly 3,000 miles
to get here.

1221
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,500
Is Jeremy with you?

1222
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:22,790
What? No! No.

1223
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:33,050
Jeremy and I...
It didn't work out.

1224
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:37,100
Sorry.

1225
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,230
Well,

1226
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:44,520
when my 60 seconds
came around, I realized

1227
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:48,150
I had everything
I ever wanted

1228
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,570
but nothing
I really needed.

1229
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,700
And I think that
what I need is here.

1230
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:00,120
And I came all this way to see if maybe
you might think so, too.

1231
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,410
And if you do...

1232
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:09,420
Well, I don't really have any plans past that,
which is new for me.

1233
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,050
So,

1234
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:16,470
Declan O'Callaghan,

1235
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:19,720
and I should probably
learn your middle name,

1236
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:23,100
here is my proposal.

1237
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:28,110
I propose
we not make plans.

1238
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,530
I propose we give
this thing a chance

1239
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:34,030
and let it work out
how it works out.

1240
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,530
So what do you say?

1241
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,290
Do you want to
not make plans with me?

1242
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:27,330
I guess
that's an Irish no.

1243
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,640
Mrs. O'Bradycallaghan.

1244
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,730
Where the hell
are you going?

1245
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,740
You said no.

1246
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:42,990
I didn't say no.

1247
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:46,160
I didn't say anything.

1248
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,870
You walked away.

1249
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,880
I was getting something.

1250
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,750
Really? That was
a good time
to go get something?

1251
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,760
Well, yeah,
it was, actually.

1252
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,470
I was getting this.

1253
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:05,520
You big idiot.

1254
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:10,400
I wouldn't be
holding this ring
if it weren't for you.

1255
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,060
I reject your proposal.

1256
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:18,490
I don't want to
not make plans with you.

1257
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,160
I want to make
plans with you.

1258
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,160
You do?

1259
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,000
Yeah. I do.

1260
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,470
Will you marry me?

1261
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:46,310
In all my life, I never thought
I'd see you down on one knee.

1262
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:50,060
Yeah, it's getting
a bit damp down here, so...

1263
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:55,020
What's it to be,
Anna from Boston?

1264
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,490
Yes.

1265
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:00,900
Yes, I will.

1266
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:34,150
I'm so relieved.
For a minute there,

1267
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:36,940
I thought I wasn't gonna have a place
to stay tonight.

1268
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,150
What?

1269
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,440
You think
you're staying
with me?

1270
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,740
This might cost you.

1271
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,780
Put it on my bill.

1272
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,420
Would you
look at that!

1273
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:59,090
On a Sunday, no less. It's good luck to get
engaged on a Sunday.

1274
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:02,880
And end a journey.

1275
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:05,050
Aye, and dig a well.

1276
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:08,390
Idiot! Do they look like
they're digging a well?

1277
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:11,020
You know what
I'm talking about.

1278
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,980
I never know
what you're talking about.

1279
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,870
Are you sure
she's gonna make it?

1280
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:33,540
Remember,
she's a classic.

1281
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,500
And she's good as new,

1282
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:38,590
even after some crazy woman tried to
push her off the road.

1283
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:39,920
I didn't try to
push her off the road!

1284
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,840
I was scraping
cow poo off my shoe

1285
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,670
'cause some rude man wouldn't help me
with the cows.

1286
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,430
Only because someone was being pigheaded
and couldn't wait.

1287
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,850
Shut up.

1288
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,600
There you are.

1289
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:55,940
Right.

1290
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,940
Where to?

1291
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,280
Just drive.

1292
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,450
You got it, Bob.

1293
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:10,370
Wait a minute.
Where's Louis?

1294
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:12,580
Louis? He's fine.
Strapped him to the roof.

1295
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:15,200
You strapped him to the roof?
He'll get filthy up there.

1296
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:16,460
Don't worry.

1297
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:19,130
We'll throw him in the wash.
He'll be grand.
