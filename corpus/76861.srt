2
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:09,177
I don't know why.
I've always been big on happy endings.

3
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,137
To me, the most romantic,
beautiful love stories...

4
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:15,017
...were the ones where
two people meet, fall in love...

5
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:17,897
...then 50, 60 years later
one of them dies.

6
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:20,377
A few days after,
the other one dies...

7
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:23,336
...because they just can't live
without each other.

8
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:28,616
Not that that's such a happy ending.
You got two dead people.

9
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:31,576
That's how I thought things would be
for Katie and me.

10
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:36,456
Not that we'd be dead,
but that we would be together forever.

11
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:42,936
Now, High/Low.
Who wants to go first? Erin?

12
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:47,656
Okay, my high today is that I sat
next to Austin Butler at lunch.

13
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:49,816
-Nice.
-He has the three-legged dog?

14
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:53,335
Joel has the three-legged dog.
Austin has the snoring turtle.

15
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:54,775
And your low?

16
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:57,975
-Camp.
-What about camp?

17
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,415
I don't know.

18
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:01,975
You had such a good time last year.

19
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:04,615
-I know.
-What is it?

20
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:07,815
Are you afraid you'll lose touch
with Austin?

21
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,015
-I don't know.
-You can write to each other.

22
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:14,295
You can put X's and O's on there.
Guys love that, right?

23
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,295
Can't get enough of it.

24
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:17,975
Honey, you'll have a great time.

25
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:20,774
What about you?
What was your high today?

26
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,174
Gary Ellis' mom bought a new juicer...

27
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:25,734
...and I went to his house
and drank a chicken.

28
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:28,454
And your low?

29
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,054
I don't have a low.

30
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:31,734
You gotta have a low.

31
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:35,014
I've been racking my brain.
I do not have a low.

32
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:38,134
We'll enter the chicken smoothie
in the high and low category.

33
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:39,254
How about you, Mama?

34
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:44,374
I know. It's your anniversary.
What are you guys doing tomorrow?

35
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:48,214
-I'm taking her to a romantic dinner...
-Dad's taking me dancing.

36
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:49,974
...and possibly some dancing.

37
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:52,133
But you're right.
That is our high.

38
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:54,373
I'd love to stick around
for your low...

39
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,253
...but the Dodgers are playing the Giants.

40
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,333
-Can I go too?
-Go.

41
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,973
I really don't care what we do
tomorrow night.

42
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,253
Even if we're
at different restaurants.

43
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:20,133
Just as long as the kids see us leaving
together and coming home together.

44
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:28,292
On our first anniversary,
I gave Ben a plastic spoon.

45
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:31,092
You know, the takeout kind
from a Chinese restaurant?

46
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:32,932
It was the one we had used...

47
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:36,612
...when we shared our first bowl
of won ton soup in the park.

48
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:38,772
He was afraid he'd lost it...

49
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:41,012
...and I remember how
his face lit up...

50
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:44,692
...when he opened the jewelry box
I had wrapped it in.

51
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:49,492
I keep asking myself:

52
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:51,811
"When is that moment in a marriage...

53
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:55,491
...when a spoon becomes just a spoon?"

54
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:15,491
When I met Katie,
I wrote on a comedy show...

55
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,891
...and she had been hired as a temp.

56
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:22,690
I don't know. It's hard to explain.
There was an instant connection...

57
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,210
...this simpatico.
I felt like she just got me.

58
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,610
And there is no greater feeling
in this world than to feel gotten.

59
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:34,448
The loudest silences are the ones...

60
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:37,248
...filled with everything
that's been said...

61
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,128
...said wrong, said 300 times.

62
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:41,808
You're not hearing me.

63
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:43,648
You're so goddamn critical!

64
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,128
It's hard with two kids.
I don't need a third.

65
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:49,727
You're perfect, and I've done
nothing right in 15 years!

66
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:50,927
You're not listening!

67
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,687
You can't let go of anything!

68
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,127
You never listen!

69
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:55,967
You hold on to everything!

70
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,127
Why should you be responsible
for anything?!

71
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,447
You're critical of every
fucking thing!

72
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,687
I take care of everything here.

73
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:03,807
-Fine!
-Fine!

74
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,407
-Fine!
-Fine!

75
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:10,367
Until fighting becomes the condition
rather than the exception.

76
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:14,527
And suddenly, it turns into
the language of the relationship...

77
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,326
...and your only option is
a silent retreat to neutral corners.

78
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:27,246
-Okay, are you a person?
-Yes.

79
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:28,606
Are you a man?

80
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,766
-That's debatable.
-Debatable?

81
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:32,846
-Do you have a mustache?
-A thick one.

82
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,366
-Aunt Rose.
-Right.

83
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,726
Good old Aunt "5:00 Shadow" Rose.

84
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:41,086
God, it's almost 9.
We're gonna miss the camp bus.

85
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:44,286
Now, that is what I call
a mobile home.

86
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:46,206
Can you get around it?
It's 5 to 9!

87
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:49,645
-They must change their zip code a lot.
-It happens as we speak.

88
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,525
Look. 91 604. 91 604.

89
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,125
91 605!

90
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:56,685
-Pass it.
-Their mailman must go crazy.

91
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,925
The kids will miss their bus.

92
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:02,685
Up on the second floor!
Somebody's about to use the bathroom!

93
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:04,925
We're in the line of fire!

94
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,045
Would you just pass
the goddamn house?!

95
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:17,965
Look, the house is making a right.

96
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:23,724
When I was in college,
we had to write a term paper.

97
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:27,564
It was for some philosophy course
I was taking...

98
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,044
...on any book we considered...

99
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:33,804
...to be the one that best depicted
how we viewed the world.

100
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:37,564
I remember some people picking books
by the great thinkers...

101
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:41,484
...like Kierkegaard and Plato.
Some kids chose the Bible.

102
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:45,244
I did my paper on
Harold and the Purple Crayon.

103
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,884
It's a small book
about a little boy...

104
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:51,083
...who draws the world
the way he wants it to be...

105
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:53,003
...with his magic crayon.

106
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:56,683
And I just loved that book because...

107
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,723
...it was about everything
that I wasn't.

108
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,763
You wanna write crossword puzzles?

109
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,163
That's a job somebody wants to do?

110
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,963
And you'd get paid to do this?

111
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:12,763
So you know stuff like
Ra is the sun god.

112
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:17,163
And the symbol for radium
and the abbreviation for regular army.

113
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,482
Should I be impressed or terrified?

114
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,642
I find it soothing and reassuring...

115
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:24,202
...because you know
there are always answers.

116
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:27,322
Yeah, but not to the really
big questions like:

117
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:30,122
"Does God exist?"
"What is the meaning of life?"

118
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:32,922
"Why does my pee smell funny
when I eat asparagus?"

119
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,402
Aspartic acid, hence the name.

120
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,882
And this soothes you?

121
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:44,122
Yes, since you'll never find
the answers to the big questions...

122
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:47,881
...there's a comfort in finding
the answers to the little ones.

123
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:50,041
When you finish, there's this...

124
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,321
...wonderful sense
of closure, knowing...

125
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:57,401
...that that little world
on that half-page is complete.

126
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:05,801
You left yourself wide open.

127
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:09,801
Come to Papa!

128
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:12,921
But the problem in a marriage is...

129
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:17,400
...if one person is always Harold,
drawing the world the way they want...

130
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,200
...the other person has no choice
but to draw it the way it is.

131
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,800
Which is why they never wrote a book
about Harold's wife.

132
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,800
-They're leaving!
-They're not!

133
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,320
Grab your bags!

134
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,720
Wait! Wait!

135
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,640
Hold it!

136
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,480
Two more coming!

137
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,240
-Thank you, Marty.
-No problem.

138
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,680
I love you.
Have a great time.

139
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,599
-All right, kid.
-Bye, Dad.

140
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,719
-Take your sister's bag.
-Have a great time.

141
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,319
Love you.

142
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,599
-I love you.
-I love you.

143
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:56,917
If you need me for anything,
I'll be at the Oceana.

144
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,437
Anything comes up with the kids,
give me a call.

145
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:02,277
Of course.

146
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,837
Isn't this the moment
where one of us says:

147
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,397
"This is ridiculous.
We love each other.

148
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:14,837
All couples go through this.
Let's give it another try"?

149
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:40,276
My ass was on television this morning.

150
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:42,836
What are you telling us?

151
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,156
I'm telling you,
my ass was on TV.

152
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:47,235
That's right. That was that special.

153
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,515
"The Kennedy Center Salutes
50 Years of Stan's Ass."

154
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:54,115
I went to the doctor, he took a tube
with a little camera on it...

155
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:58,195
...stuck it up my ass and we
watched it on a monitor in his office.

156
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:00,435
-You had a sigmoidoscopy.
-Exactly.

157
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:02,995
That's different
than your ass being on TV.

158
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,915
-How?
-First of all...

159
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:07,075
...a network can't cancel your ass.

160
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:08,595
Point well taken.

161
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:11,315
What demographics
do you hope to knock down...

162
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:13,795
...with that big crack
winking at you?

163
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:17,554
We're in public. Can we
elevate the level of conversation?

164
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:18,994
-Fine with me.
-Good.

165
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,874
I jerked off to your secretary.
Do you mind?

166
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:23,794
-Why should I mind?
-I don't know.

167
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,114
I wanna forge ahead
with a clear conscience.

168
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,554
Pound away.

169
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,154
You're a good friend.

170
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:34,034
Larry wanted to have sex last night.
He even gave me the 30-second massage.

171
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:37,954
You mean the "I really care
that you had a bad day" back rub...

172
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:40,274
...that stops just before you relax...

173
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:43,314
...then quickly heads south
towards the promised land?

174
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:44,914
So did you make love?

175
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:47,633
-I was too tired.
-How'd you get out of it?

176
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:50,193
I pretended to fall asleep
during the massage.

177
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,033
I did that heavy breathing thing.

178
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:54,033
So he thinks you're in deep REM?

179
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:57,073
But it backfired,
because when I really fell asleep...

180
00:13:57,313 --> 00:14:00,833
...the baby started crying,
then Larry pretended he was asleep.

181
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:04,513
Fool! lf he had just gotten up
with the baby, you would've...

182
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:08,353
...opened the gates and welcomed
the troops home for Christmas.

183
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:09,953
In a heartbeat.

184
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:11,953
What's up with you and Charlene?

185
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:14,273
Oh, we had a great night last night.

186
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,832
And you still claim
you're not cheating?

187
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:19,312
I maintain that
with every fiber of my being.

188
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:20,912
On-line sex isn't cheating.

189
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:22,272
How do you figure?

190
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:25,632
It's 3 a.m., your wife and kids
are sleeping upstairs...

191
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:29,072
...and you're downstairs
fucking some bimbo in cyberspace.

192
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:32,592
First of all, we're not fucking.
We're typing.

193
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:35,312
Second, and this is me
taking umbrage...

194
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:37,872
...Charlene is not some bimbo.

195
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,952
She's a stockbroker named Ralph...

196
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,352
...pretending to be some bimbo
named Charlene.

197
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,352
Why piss on something so beautiful?

198
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:46,351
What'd I say?

199
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:47,711
It's not an affair.

200
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:50,591
Teresa never had sex with him.
They just kissed.

201
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,951
-A kiss is an affair.
-You think so?

202
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:55,151
Absolutely.

203
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:58,991
Once you establish anything
truly intimate with another person...

204
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:00,831
...even talking...

205
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,431
...it affects the person you're
the most intimate with.

206
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:08,271
But Teresa could fuck her husband,
she just couldn't kiss him.

207
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,111
I mean, really kiss him.

208
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:11,471
It's not so crazy.

209
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,271
Sometimes I'm so angry at Stan,
I could fuck him...

210
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:16,510
...but I don't want
that cow tongue near me.

211
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,030
A kiss can be so much more
intimate than sex.

212
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,790
Why is that?

213
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,310
Because fucking means,
"Yeah, I love you." But a kiss....

214
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,790
A kiss means, "I like you."

215
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,750
That's so right.

216
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,630
I haven't made out, I mean,
really made out with Larry for years.

217
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,390
Doesn't that make you sad?

218
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,230
Not really.

219
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,470
Why?

220
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,630
I don't know.

221
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,149
Because it's inevitable.
It's the wear and tear of the job.

222
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:49,709
The diapers, the tantrums,
the homework.

223
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,349
The kingdom, species,
your mom, his mom.

224
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:55,869
Suddenly, all you're aware of is
the wet towels on the floor...

225
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:58,909
...he hogs the remote and
he scratches his back with a fork.

226
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:02,669
And you come face to face with
the truth that it's impossible...

227
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:05,629
...to kiss a person who leaves
the new roll of toilet paper...

228
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:08,029
...on top of the empty cardboard roll!

229
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:11,709
God forbid he takes the two seconds
to actually replace it!

230
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:14,428
Does he not see it?!

231
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:19,228
I'm telling you, marriage is
the Jack Kevorkian of romance.

232
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,868
Oh, God!

233
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:28,828
Jesus! Shit!

234
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:30,908
-He hit me!
-I didn't!

235
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:33,628
I was leaving the room,
she stood in my way.

236
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,028
-He did it on purpose.
-Guys, hold on!

237
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:39,628
Ben? What?!

238
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:44,667
Katie, you won't believe
what I'm standing in front of.

239
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:47,147
They're tearing down
our old apartment.

240
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:48,587
-What?
-See?!

241
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:50,187
Josh, did you hit her?

242
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,867
She started it!

243
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:54,427
I told her never to come in my room
without asking.

244
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,507
It's heading for Mrs. Gutierrez's.

245
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,187
There goes her window!

246
00:16:58,347 --> 00:17:00,267
You borrowed her Discman
without asking?!

247
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,507
Yeah, but she was done with it.

248
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:05,067
She hasn't used the Discman
in two days!

249
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:10,027
Just hit Jack Roikman's place.
Remember his patriotic orgasms?

250
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:13,706
"God bless America! God bless America!
Land that I love!"

251
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:15,706
Can't you let him use yours?

252
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,706
No! He never lets me use it!

253
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:20,586
Ben, I can't talk right now.

254
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:24,426
This is where you and I started.
This is where we became an "us."

255
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,906
Just hit where we used to
measure the kids' heights.

256
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:32,826
Ben, I-- Josh, you shouldn't have
hit your sister. No TV for a week.

257
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,346
You're so unfair!

258
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:35,786
Wait until I tell Dad!

259
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:39,946
Jesus Christ! I gotta go!
Are you okay?

260
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:45,465
Goddamn it!

261
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,425
Fantasizing isn't cheating?

262
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:51,625
Oh, please! Who is getting hurt?

263
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:54,585
Yesterday, I met this
stunning blond woman...

264
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,145
...at the Beverly Center food court.

265
00:17:57,385 --> 00:18:00,105
She had a little ring
in the bellybutton.

266
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:01,865
But you know what?

267
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:05,145
I forgave her because
it wasn't in her eyebrow or tongue.

268
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,065
Beautiful. We start chatting...

269
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:10,585
...and we strike up a conversation,
waiting for our turkey.

270
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:13,544
I'm telling you,
she's smiling, I'm smiling...

271
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,784
...and just that
30-second encounter...

272
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:19,784
...will do wonders for me when
I'm shaking hands with the sheriff.

273
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:22,184
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

274
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:24,424
-Am I wrong?
-No, you're right!

275
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:27,784
The other day, I told a joke
to this intriguing woman...

276
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:29,624
...that I met at the cleaners.

277
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:32,504
If this were the '30s,
she'd be a Communist...

278
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,744
...or at least
a Communist sympathizer.

279
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:38,344
But the point is, the way
she laughed at that joke...

280
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,304
...reminded me of how Rachel
used to laugh at my jokes.

281
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:43,383
You gonna follow up?

282
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,903
I could never do that.

283
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:49,223
I think the Ten Commandments were
probably a lot easier to stick to...

284
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,303
...when you dropped dead at 35.

285
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:53,703
I mean, we--
They should be amended.

286
00:18:54,023 --> 00:18:56,183
A little amendment,
like the Constitution.

287
00:18:56,423 --> 00:19:00,343
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's house, wife or ass.

288
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:04,343
But if you have to covet
your neighbor's wife's ass...

289
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:06,663
...don't do it
in thy neighbor's house."

290
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:10,663
A simple amendment, two-thirds
majority, slide through both Houses.

291
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:14,742
Seriously, name me one guy you know
who's never cheated on his wife.

292
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,342
I wasn't cheating!

293
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:20,662
I walk into your office,
and I hear you telling some Sara...

294
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:25,382
...intimate details about our
relationship, about our problems.

295
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:28,902
Obviously there's something going on
between you and her.

296
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:32,022
Nothing is going on between us!
We were just talking!

297
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:34,262
About us?! About our life?!

298
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,422
We were just talking!

299
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:39,382
That's not talking!
That's a relationship!

300
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:42,581
Why didn't you tell me about her
if there's nothing to hide?

301
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:45,061
I just needed somebody to talk to!

302
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:48,501
Bullshit! Why didn't you talk to me?!

303
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:50,501
Mommy, I need a drink of water!

304
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,741
I'll be right there!

305
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:55,061
You wanna know why
I don't talk to you?

306
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:58,981
You treat me like I'm a big pain
in the ass that gets in the way...

307
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:02,421
...of what otherwise would be
a normal, organized life!

308
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:06,261
Have you ever thought that
everything isn't always about you?

309
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:11,141
Maybe I'm tired! Maybe I'm dealing
with 5000 things all day long!

310
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:14,260
Maybe every need you have
doesn't have to be met...

311
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,940
...at the exact moment
you need it to be met!

312
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,820
God, we have actual kids here, Ben.

313
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,060
I am not a third child!

314
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,180
I am not talking about having
each of my needs met!

315
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,180
I'm talking about a connection!

316
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,660
A look! Something that says
that we're on the same side here!

317
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,140
Why don't you talk
to your girlfriend?

318
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,660
I'm sure she can help us
get back on the same side.

319
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:50,099
To have a happy marriage is to accept
the chasm between men and women.

320
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:51,379
Which is?

321
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,539
He can mend a fight with sex.

322
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:56,099
She can't have sex
until the fight's resolved.

323
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:57,539
Why is that?

324
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,259
It's the difference between
the penis and the vagina.

325
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:04,419
A penis is a thruster,
a battering ram, if you will.

326
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:07,619
Even if it's mad, it can ram.
Sometimes it even helps.

327
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:10,419
It's the "mad-ram principle."
However, the vagina....

328
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:11,858
The vagina!

329
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:17,858
The vagina has to be relaxed
in order to open and receive.

330
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,738
It can't be a gracious hostess
in a state of anger.

331
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,898
That goes for blowjobs
and kissing too.

332
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:28,018
Every female point of entry needs
to know that the penis is coming...

333
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:29,698
...in peace.

334
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,178
-Do you have Sweet'N Low?
-Is Equal okay?

335
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:33,538
Whatever.

336
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:42,017
I've always felt no matter what
we were going through...

337
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:44,017
...no matter how painful things got...

338
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:46,657
...if our feet found each other
under the blankets...

339
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,897
...even just the slightest
connection...

340
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,857
...it'd tell us we'd entered
the demilitarized zone...

341
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:55,857
...that we were gonna be okay,
that we were still an "us."

342
00:21:57,697 --> 00:22:01,697
There are some hurts that you
never completely get over.

343
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:06,177
And you think that time will diminish
their presence...

344
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:08,497
...and to a degree it does...

345
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:11,536
...but it still hurts,
because, well...

346
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,056
...hurt hurts.

347
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:21,136
If you lose your room key...

348
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:23,216
...contact the front desk.

349
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:26,656
And if you've got valuables,
keep them in the hotel safe.

350
00:22:26,976 --> 00:22:28,416
It's complimentary.

351
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:31,456
For family dining,
how about a pizza poolside...

352
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:33,936
...from our Wolfgang Puck Café?

353
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:36,896
Then it's a quick walk to
the Santa Monica Pier and beach.

354
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:41,375
When the kids are acting up,
the waves will set them straight.

355
00:22:56,735 --> 00:22:59,375
The Patriot is proof positive...

356
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:01,615
...that missile defense works.

357
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:04,255
As we've been taught
by Saddam Hussein....

358
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:08,735
Something about how that man says
"Saddam" makes me want you even more.

359
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:22,654
Oh, my God!

360
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:25,294
-The tooth fairy.
-Where?

361
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:28,814
Josh's tooth. We forgot to put
money under his pillow.

362
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:32,174
Josh is asleep. I'm sure
this can wait a few minutes.

363
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:35,134
No, no, baby, we might forget later.

364
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:39,214
Who goes?

365
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:41,453
Rock, paper, scissors!

366
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:42,973
Shit!

367
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:49,933
Mr. President, I'm entrusting you
with my soon-to-be-naked wife.

368
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:51,853
Take care of her, the country.

369
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:53,773
My love to Barbara.

370
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:55,773
I'll be right back.

371
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:06,653
I'll be right back!

372
00:24:56,651 --> 00:25:00,491
Everything that's important in
the world is in this bed right now.

373
00:25:04,091 --> 00:25:05,611
I love you.

374
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,411
I love you.

375
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:44,489
Hi. You've reached the home
of Jordan, Jordan, Jordan and Jordan.

376
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,569
Nary a Jordan is present now.

377
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:49,689
If you wanna leave a message
for Katie, Ben, Josh or Erin...

378
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:52,329
...what better time than....

379
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:56,729
Hi, it's me.

380
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,769
I'm just calling to see
how the kids are doing.

381
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:02,409
See if you got any post cards
from them.

382
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,529
Anything comes up,
you can give me a call.

383
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:08,569
Bye-bye.

384
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:32,968
Listen, I just got your message.
I was in the shower when you called.

385
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:36,408
The kids seem to be doing really well.

386
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:39,047
I just put the post cards
in an envelope.

387
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:42,247
You should be getting them tomorrow.

388
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:43,447
Good.

389
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:47,047
You okay?

390
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:50,247
Yeah, I'm okay. You okay?

391
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:52,327
Yeah, I'm okay.

392
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:00,807
Bye.

393
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:04,007
Bye.

394
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:46,085
It's me.

395
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,165
How are you?

396
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,565
I'm good. Yeah, really good.

397
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:55,925
Good.

398
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,605
What's up?

399
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,165
What's up?

400
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:07,445
I was thinking about the upstairs
bathroom, and I wanted to remind you...

401
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,004
...to schedule that guy
to recaulk the tub.

402
00:28:10,244 --> 00:28:12,244
I've already done it.

403
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:15,524
Well.

404
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:17,044
Good.

405
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,804
Then...

406
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,204
...bye.

407
00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:27,124
Bye.

408
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:48,083
I'm calling to see if you remember
the name of that tree surgeon we used.

409
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,523
Joey Bishop.

410
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:52,003
Yeah, but no.

411
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:55,043
-But it was one of those Rat Pack guys.
-Right.

412
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:56,163
Frank Sinatra?

413
00:28:57,123 --> 00:28:58,483
Dean Martin?

414
00:28:58,883 --> 00:29:00,003
Sammy Davis Jr.?

415
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:02,643
That's it! Joey Davis Jr.

416
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:05,283
Joey Davis Jr., the tree surgeon.

417
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:08,402
I can still see the sign
on that blue truck of his.

418
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:11,442
Right. Okay, thanks.

419
00:29:14,242 --> 00:29:15,122
Bye.

420
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:18,482
Listen, your shirts came back
from the cleaners.

421
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:24,002
Cool. I'll come by and get them.

422
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:25,922
I can drop them off.

423
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:28,962
It's fine. I'll be happy
to come and get them.

424
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:30,562
What would be a good time?

425
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:33,042
I don't know....

426
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:36,242
Why don't you come over tomorrow?
I'll be home by 7.

427
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:37,841
You can stay for dinner.

428
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:40,081
You sure?

429
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:42,001
No.

430
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:46,081
See you tomorrow.

431
00:31:58,477 --> 00:31:59,757
You look like...

432
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:01,757
...like you.

433
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:05,917
You too.

434
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:17,276
I guess I could stand on the porch
all night. I've seen the house.

435
00:32:17,596 --> 00:32:21,676
How many times have we said,
"We should use this porch more often"?

436
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:25,596
Come in. My house is
literally your house.

437
00:32:25,836 --> 00:32:26,636
Thank you.

438
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:35,036
-There's my dry cleaning.
-Yeah, I left it out for you.

439
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:37,835
Good. I'll remember
to take it with me.

440
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:40,635
Because I could put it
in the closet, but I--

441
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:44,635
That is perfect
dry cleaning placement.

442
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:48,555
-You want a drink?
-You want something--?

443
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:51,675
Want some wine?

444
00:32:52,955 --> 00:32:54,955
I think I remember where it is.

445
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:58,395
-If memory serves, you like red wine.
-Right.

446
00:32:58,635 --> 00:33:00,795
Yeah, it's all coming back to me.

447
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:06,314
Wine is breathing a lot better
than I am.

448
00:33:11,514 --> 00:33:14,234
You'll never believe
what I did last night.

449
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:16,794
I attempted to do
one of your crosswords.

450
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,874
I have a question.

451
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:24,234
What was 3 down?
Just couldn't get it.

452
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:27,594
Four letters, "Feeling of
psychological discomfort."

453
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:29,674
"Blah."

454
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,314
Blah.

455
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:36,313
Cheers.

456
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:37,833
Cheers.

457
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:51,513
Was this always here?

458
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:53,993
No, I bought it last week.

459
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:59,353
Any other new appliances
I should know about?

460
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:02,793
Well, as long as we're
spilling our guts here...

461
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:05,832
...I also got this new garlic press.

462
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:09,992
The body's not even cold,
and she's out buying garlic presses.

463
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,152
How do you think the kids are?

464
00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:26,952
From the cards,
it sounds like they're good.

465
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:29,432
I think Erin misses us,
but she's okay.

466
00:34:30,232 --> 00:34:32,072
Yeah. She seems okay.

467
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:33,752
You think she's okay?

468
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:35,511
I think she's okay.

469
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:38,711
Because I think she senses
that we're not okay...

470
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:41,831
...and Parents' Weekend is coming.

471
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:46,231
We'll just have to give her...

472
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:48,791
...a lot of extra attention...

473
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:50,471
...and really love her up.

474
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:02,471
Should we eat?

475
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:04,231
Yeah, I could eat.

476
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,150
This is really good.

477
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,670
Thanks.

478
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,390
High/Low?

479
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,590
Sure.

480
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,430
Your high?

481
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,830
Honestly?

482
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,470
Right now.

483
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,830
And your low?

484
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,470
Every minute of the last two weeks.

485
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:35,429
How about you?

486
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:42,309
My high would have to be the Cuisinart
because I wanted it ever so badly.

487
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:43,749
And your low?

488
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:48,789
The garlic press. It's not nearly
as handy as I thought it'd be.

489
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:52,629
I lay myself open, and you mock me
with kitchenware.

490
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:55,829
All the while making me
more attractive to you.

491
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,269
Is that your intention?

492
00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:05,988
I'm not sure.

493
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:10,548
It's working.

494
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:41,747
It looks like I haven't been
doing too much reading.

495
00:36:47,187 --> 00:36:50,627
Okay, I'm ready. How about you?

496
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:53,347
-I....
-What?

497
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,707
Come on. Remember
what Dr. Tischner said:

498
00:36:57,027 --> 00:37:00,467
"If you had it once,
you can always get it back."

499
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:05,026
Was that Dr. Tischner
or was that Dr. Hopkins?

500
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:08,626
The one with the sibilant "S."

501
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:09,666
Right.

502
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:13,746
Wrong. It was a lateral lisp.

503
00:37:13,906 --> 00:37:16,546
Sex is simply a symbolic expression...

504
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:19,586
...of the emotional status
of a relationship.

505
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:25,026
Sustained lack of sex is
symptomatic of disassociation.

506
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:28,386
No, the one with the lateral lisp
was Dr. Rifkin.

507
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:32,786
Dr. Hopkins was the one with the
Rorschach birthmark on his forehead.

508
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:36,625
It looked like California. How could
you pay attention to what he said?

509
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:39,825
This cycle of closeness,
then estrangement...

510
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:41,505
...you've both told me about...

511
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:45,105
...what instigates it?
First thing that comes to your mind.

512
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:47,505
-Sacramento.
-Governor Gray Davis.

513
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:52,545
My personal favorite was the Freudian
with the prostate problem.

514
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,185
When two people go to bed...

515
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:58,785
...there are actually six people
in that bed.

516
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,425
If you'll excuse me.

517
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:06,224
Are we allowed to talk when he's gone?

518
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:08,064
I don't know.

519
00:38:09,024 --> 00:38:10,304
What do you think?

520
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:13,104
To be on the safe side,
maybe we better not.

521
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:23,664
The six people in bed are
the two of you...

522
00:38:24,144 --> 00:38:27,264
...and your parents
and your parents.

523
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:30,704
Now, the key is....

524
00:38:31,264 --> 00:38:32,943
Will you excuse me, please?

525
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:39,183
He charged us for the full session.

526
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:41,983
The man was peeing on our time!

527
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:47,823
All that therapy was
a waste of time and money.

528
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:50,783
Where did all that therapy
really get us?

529
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,663
It got us here,
laughing about it.

530
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:57,583
-He's right.
-Once it's broken, it can't be fixed.

531
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:59,983
-I don't know.
-The queen has spoken.

532
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:03,342
-Maybe it's too soon.
-What are you talking about?

533
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:07,982
The whole point of having a fight is
playing "hide the salami" afterwards.

534
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:11,982
Let hard times bring you together.
Nobody said it'd be easy.

535
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:15,662
Can't hard times bring us together?
Nobody said it'd be easy.

536
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:18,702
Like the Andrews Sisters.
After "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" ...

537
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:21,022
...before "Don't Sit
Under the Apple Tree."

538
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:23,022
Big career slump there.

539
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:26,062
Like the Andrews Sisters before
"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree."

540
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:27,662
The Andrews Sisters?

541
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:29,902
They didn't stop
because of a few flops.

542
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,301
They hung in there.
The rest is history.

543
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,541
Don't sit under the apple tree

544
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:37,981
Why are you bringing up
the Andrews Sisters now?

545
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:40,221
-You're singing!
-It's an example.

546
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,541
They're in trouble,
and you're singing?

547
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:46,621
Dot, put out once in a while.
Your face won't be so tight.

548
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:47,661
Slut.

549
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:52,301
I don't know what their career slump
has to do with our marital problems.

550
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:53,981
What should we do?

551
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:57,661
Make matters worse by dwelling
on every little thing all our lives?

552
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:00,381
Is that what you think I do?

553
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:03,020
-You're a child.
-I just dwell on everything?

554
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,420
You're a 72-year-old infant!

555
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,340
There are real problems that we
haven't even begun to deal with.

556
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,700
Don't you think I know that?
What happened to you?

557
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,660
What happened to that fun girl
with the pith helmet?

558
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,020
You don't think I ask myself
that every day?

559
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,780
You beat her out of me!
There's no room here for her!

560
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,380
You think it's all fun and games.

561
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,500
So it's my fault you hang on
to every little thing!

562
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,300
It's my fault you can't
let go of anything!

563
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,899
It's my fault you turned
into your mother?!

564
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,739
Fuck you!

565
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:26,138
-I still think that there's a chance--
-Ben, you love who we were.

566
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:29,658
You couldn't possibly love
what we've become.

567
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:32,857
I think I spotted us
at dinner tonight.

568
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:37,577
We can't stay together
just because we...

569
00:41:37,817 --> 00:41:40,377
...get a glimpse of "us"
every once in a while.

570
00:41:40,937 --> 00:41:43,017
It was less than 1 5 minutes ago.

571
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:48,297
All we proved is, if we're apart
for weeks at a time...

572
00:41:48,457 --> 00:41:51,337
...we might get through a dinner.
That's not a marriage.

573
00:41:57,497 --> 00:41:58,857
It's over.

574
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:38,055
A book about your grandmother?

575
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:40,375
Yeah. She was an extraordinary woman.

576
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:43,495
I'm sure she was.
Did she fuck a President?

577
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,735
No. Did she discover uranium?

578
00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:50,215
A cure for cancer?
Nothing like that?

579
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:54,215
Why would anybody wanna read
a book about her?

580
00:42:54,535 --> 00:42:57,975
She was 4'9" . She emigrated
from Europe as a little girl.

581
00:42:58,215 --> 00:43:02,374
She worked in a sweatshop making
buttonholes 14 hours a day and yet...

582
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:06,454
...raised five kids and stayed married
to the same man for 57 years.

583
00:43:06,614 --> 00:43:09,734
Dave, this will be the greatest
love story ever told.

584
00:43:11,254 --> 00:43:14,294
Let me explain something to you.
Not as your agent.

585
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:16,294
This is as a friend.

586
00:43:20,854 --> 00:43:22,134
Come here.

587
00:43:23,254 --> 00:43:24,774
You see all these people?

588
00:43:25,094 --> 00:43:28,054
They're getting into buildings.
They're driving cars.

589
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:31,093
They're crossing the street.
They're walking around.

590
00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:33,813
Every single one of these people...

591
00:43:34,053 --> 00:43:36,133
...is going to die someday...

592
00:43:36,293 --> 00:43:37,733
...and they all know it.

593
00:43:39,093 --> 00:43:40,373
Which is why...

594
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:44,533
...they regard the time they have
on this planet as precious.

595
00:43:44,853 --> 00:43:47,173
There are things that take up
that time...

596
00:43:47,413 --> 00:43:50,453
...even if they don't enjoy it.
They have to go to work.

597
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:53,013
They have to get dressed,
wait in lines...

598
00:43:53,253 --> 00:43:55,573
...clean yards, get batteries.

599
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:58,933
They visit the eye doctor.
They're doing all these things.

600
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:04,052
Now, add that to the time they spend
sleeping and eating...

601
00:44:04,212 --> 00:44:07,092
...and washing up and voting...

602
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:10,692
...and buying gifts for people
they don't like, and you see...

603
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:14,772
...why they're so choosy about
how they spend their leisure time.

604
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:18,292
You can understand why
unless she went down on somebody...

605
00:44:18,452 --> 00:44:22,132
...really interesting, they won't
waste their valuable time...

606
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:25,812
...reading a book about
your fucking grandmother!

607
00:44:28,452 --> 00:44:31,091
So if I read you right,
you don't like the idea.

608
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:32,531
It's not that.

609
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:47,251
You know, I find the Ariana
much more fragrant than the Raphaela.

610
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:50,851
I'll keep that in mind.

611
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:53,171
-How you doing?
-Fine.

612
00:44:53,411 --> 00:44:57,011
I never got a chance to thank you
for holding the camp bus.

613
00:44:57,171 --> 00:44:59,890
Anytime you need a bus held,
I am your guy.

614
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,090
-Erin's teeth are looking good.
-Thanks to you.

615
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,730
I hope she remembers to wear
her retainer.

616
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,730
You know how kids are at camp.

617
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,730
The minute my Kevin gets off that bus,
it's "Goodbye, biteplate."

618
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,650
Is that for you?

619
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,770
When Deirdre and I divorced,
I decided to learn how to cook.

620
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,090
The Wok-y World of Thai Cooking?

621
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,610
I'm branching out.

622
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,730
I'm taking a Thai cooking course
this summer.

623
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,250
Really? I've always been interested
in Asian cooking.

624
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:30,609
Really?

625
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:32,449
Why don't you join me?

626
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:36,849
When I think about it...

627
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:39,809
...over the years there were
less and less moments...

628
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:41,489
...in the course of the day...

629
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:44,529
...when Ben and I actually made
real eye contact.

630
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:47,329
You are not gonna believe
what happened.

631
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:50,049
-What?
-He's almost asleep.

632
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:53,569
Maybe it was the stuff of life.

633
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:55,809
Who's taking Erin to school?

634
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:59,408
Who will pick up Josh
from his clarinet lessons?

635
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,448
After a while, there was
a disturbing comfort...

636
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:04,768
...in not having to deal
with each other...

637
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:08,848
...because somehow you just
get used to the disconnection.

638
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:13,728
Even at night, when we could finally
come together, we faced forward.

639
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:16,928
Yeah, we were tired,
but I think we were afraid...

640
00:46:17,248 --> 00:46:20,528
...that if we faced each other,
there'd be nothing there.

641
00:46:20,928 --> 00:46:22,928
We're learning Mee Krob next week.

642
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:24,768
Mee Krob.

643
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:27,808
I'll let you know.

644
00:46:31,647 --> 00:46:34,287
I'll call you. Oh, you call me.

645
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:42,287
When we drove to the camp
for Parents' Weekend...

646
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:44,607
...I was scared to face the kids.

647
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,567
You'd talk about it with a best friend.
But Katie had been my best friend.

648
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,967
Now I didn't know what we were,
except Josh and Erin's parents.

649
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:21,966
What?

650
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:25,086
Nothing.

651
00:47:27,966 --> 00:47:29,565
--is nothing?

652
00:47:31,085 --> 00:47:33,325
This is not going to be easy.

653
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:37,805
The kids do not need to be burdened
with our problems.

654
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:39,805
They have half a summer left.

655
00:47:40,045 --> 00:47:42,845
Like my plan was to burden
the kids with our problems.

656
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:46,285
Jesus Christ, will you give me
some fucking credit?

657
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:54,365
I missed you.

658
00:47:54,845 --> 00:47:56,525
I missed you so much.

659
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:58,524
I missed you both so much.

660
00:48:01,724 --> 00:48:03,484
Dad, pull yourself together.

661
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,964
Dad, get off of me!

662
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:10,604
You guys both look terrific!
Show us your bunks.

663
00:48:11,564 --> 00:48:13,244
I wanna see your bunks too.

664
00:48:13,484 --> 00:48:16,204
Did you get your favorite room?
The Acorn Cabin?

665
00:48:16,444 --> 00:48:17,804
Yeah, we did.

666
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:20,124
We got the Acorn Cabin.

667
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,002
God, I hate lying to them.

668
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:11,882
Me too. We're not even good at it.

669
00:49:12,122 --> 00:49:14,762
Even if we were good at it,
they'd still know.

670
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:39,721
What is that?

671
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,161
What's what?

672
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:44,681
-The thing you just put in your mouth.
-It's my biteplate.

673
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:47,961
-Biteplate?
-Yeah. It's my biteplate.

674
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:50,921
-Why do you have a biteplate?
-For my bite.

675
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,401
What's wrong with your bite?

676
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:56,201
It's askew.

677
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:57,240
Askew?

678
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,160
Yes, it's askew.

679
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,920
So this would be an attempt
to de-skew it?

680
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,200
You order room service?

681
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,120
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I'm okay.

682
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,640
Honey, are you okay?

683
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,800
I'm okay. I'm fine.

684
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,239
I couldn't sleep, so
I snuck out after lights out.

685
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:30,039
I just wanted to sleep
with you guys.

686
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:36,279
It's okay. I'll call the camp
and let them know you're here.

687
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:43,559
Why is the bed made up on the couch?

688
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:49,399
Daddy was doing a little reading,
and I didn't wanna wake Mommy up.

689
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:25,238
Sometimes you just can't
climb out of the abyss.

690
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,197
I thought of last summer,
when we still hoped...

691
00:51:28,437 --> 00:51:31,397
...that if we put ourselves
in some idyllic setting...

692
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:34,117
...we'd somehow get rid
of all the tension...

693
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,877
...jump-start our marriage...

694
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:39,237
...and rediscover why we fell in love
in the first place.

695
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:41,637
So last year,
after Parents' Weekend...

696
00:51:41,797 --> 00:51:44,437
...we thought maybe
in a trattoria in Venice...

697
00:51:44,757 --> 00:51:48,277
...looking at a beautiful sunset,
next to a bottle of Chianti...

698
00:51:48,437 --> 00:51:51,237
...we just might find a set
of jumper cables.

699
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:55,797
How you doing?
Two Italian ices, please.

700
00:51:56,116 --> 00:52:00,116
Honey, you don't have to say Italian.
We're here. They know.

701
00:52:00,436 --> 00:52:04,276
So if I'm in Belgium, and I order
a Belgian waffle, I just say waffle?

702
00:52:04,516 --> 00:52:07,716
Like if you were in Ireland
and you wanted Irish stew...

703
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:09,396
...you'd just say stew.

704
00:52:09,636 --> 00:52:12,196
If you're in China and
you want Chinese food...

705
00:52:12,436 --> 00:52:14,196
...you say, "Bring on the food."

706
00:52:15,316 --> 00:52:18,436
We couldn't help but overhear
your delightful repartee.

707
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:21,156
We're the Kirbys from Cleveland.
And you are...?

708
00:52:21,396 --> 00:52:23,636
-The Mansons.
-From Spawn Ranch.

709
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:28,995
That's a good one.

710
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,995
Look, sweetie. There.
The red cape.

711
00:52:47,235 --> 00:52:48,515
I like that.

712
00:52:54,355 --> 00:52:55,315
It's you...

713
00:52:55,554 --> 00:52:56,354
...people.

714
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,714
-The Kirbys from Cleveland.
-Joanie and Eddie.

715
00:52:59,954 --> 00:53:03,234
How could we forget?
We haven't stopped talking about you.

716
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:06,754
This is fate. We have to
get together, break bread.

717
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:09,714
Sounds great.
We're at the Hotel Pasta e Fagioli.

718
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:13,234
You call us.
We're at the Europa Regina.

719
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:15,714
Great. We'll call you.

720
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:17,074
Oh, right on!

721
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:20,594
Look at this.

722
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:22,674
-This is beautiful.
-This way.

723
00:53:22,994 --> 00:53:25,074
-Thank you.
-Canal-side seating.

724
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:26,673
Very nice.

725
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:31,153
Oh, my God!

726
00:53:32,193 --> 00:53:33,633
Meant to be!

727
00:53:34,593 --> 00:53:36,593
Kismet! Kismet!

728
00:53:36,993 --> 00:53:40,833
We went looking for your hotel,
but we couldn't find it anywhere.

729
00:53:41,073 --> 00:53:44,993
-Yeah, it's pretty hard to find.
-Well, all's well that ends well.

730
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:50,673
It was just like fate,
the first time I met Joanie.

731
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:54,433
I worked on the 6th floor,
and Eddie worked on the 4th floor.

732
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,992
-Hand to God.
-Every day in the cafeteria...

733
00:53:57,232 --> 00:53:59,712
-...on the third floor--
-I saw Joanie at the salad bar.

734
00:53:59,952 --> 00:54:02,352
And she smiled at me.
Not just a smile.

735
00:54:02,592 --> 00:54:04,512
I mean, a really big smile.

736
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:07,872
One day at the salad bar
at Beefsteak Charlie's...

737
00:54:08,192 --> 00:54:10,512
...I thought I saw her
at that salad bar.

738
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:13,232
-But it wasn't me.
-It wasn't Joanie!

739
00:54:14,112 --> 00:54:18,112
What are the odds of another person
at a salad bar looking like Joanie...

740
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:20,192
...and yet not being Joanie?

741
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:23,312
What, like a trillion to one?

742
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,311
Could be higher than that.

743
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:29,551
Anyway, when I realized it wasn't
Joanie, I was so disappointed.

744
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:33,791
And I began to think about how much
I'd hoped that it was Joanie.

745
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:36,431
But at this point
you still hadn't met.

746
00:54:36,671 --> 00:54:41,391
No. And I couldn't get over how much
I wanted this person to be Joanie.

747
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:44,511
And I think that was
the defining moment.

748
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:47,951
I went back to my wife at the table
at Beefsteak Charlie's...

749
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:52,191
...and I realized I felt more alive
thinking about that stranger...

750
00:54:52,431 --> 00:54:56,350
...I thought was Joanie than I did
with the stranger who was my wife.

751
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,830
We were both in marriages
we'd outgrown.

752
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,950
You know, maybe I didn't
wanna admit it, but maybe...

753
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:05,790
...I didn't like myself enough
to be with someone who liked me.

754
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,910
Can you imagine anybody
not liking Eddie Kirby?

755
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,150
I'm not so perfect.

756
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,990
Beg to differ!

757
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,190
That year we both mustered up
enough courage to leave our marriages.

758
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,350
So at this point you had met.

759
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:22,350
Still hadn't met.

760
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:27,149
But, you know, after you've had
such a horrible marriage...

761
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:30,349
...you don't wanna make
the same mistakes twice.

762
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:32,989
So I made an inner pact with myself.

763
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:36,749
I said, "Eddie, you will never
let anger build up to the point...

764
00:55:36,989 --> 00:55:38,829
...where you don't like
your partner."

765
00:55:39,149 --> 00:55:41,469
-I made the same pact.
-That became our credo.

766
00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:44,349
"Never go to bed angry."

767
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,149
So now we talk everything through.

768
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:50,989
We won't let even the tiniest pea
be under our mattress.

769
00:55:51,229 --> 00:55:53,629
That's why we never eat in bed.

770
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,148
Me too.

771
00:56:02,428 --> 00:56:04,268
Who'd have thought the Kirbys...

772
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:06,828
...the happiest couple
never to have met...

773
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:10,028
...would be the greatest
aphrodisiac known to man?

774
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:38,347
If only you could bottle
that unfettered state of mind...

775
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:40,587
...that comes with being
on foreign soil...

776
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:42,587
...to just hold on to it...

777
00:56:42,827 --> 00:56:45,387
...even for a day, an evening...

778
00:56:46,107 --> 00:56:47,467
...an hour.

779
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:50,907
Last year, when we
got back from Italy, God knows...

780
00:56:51,147 --> 00:56:52,987
...we gave it a try.

781
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:09,386
Hey, look at this.

782
00:57:09,946 --> 00:57:14,106
While we were away, we got a message
from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

783
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,026
About a softball team
he's getting started.

784
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:23,545
You wanna write a letter to the kids
together, let them know we're back?

785
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:31,785
"Dear Josh...

786
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:33,945
...and Erin."

787
00:57:34,345 --> 00:57:37,225
Oh, sure. You get the easy part.

788
00:57:40,745 --> 00:57:41,785
"We're...

789
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:44,345
...back."

790
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,305
"From...

791
00:57:50,185 --> 00:57:51,305
...Europe."

792
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:54,824
That's not a sentence.
It's a preposition and a continent.

793
00:57:55,064 --> 00:57:57,464
I crossed out your period
and made a sentence.

794
00:57:57,624 --> 00:58:00,744
See? "We're back from Europe."
Your turn.

795
00:58:00,984 --> 00:58:01,944
Thank you.

796
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:06,744
Exclamation point.
Comma. Close parentheses.

797
00:58:07,064 --> 00:58:08,984
"But l...

798
00:58:09,704 --> 00:58:11,704
...don't want to talk...

799
00:58:11,944 --> 00:58:14,264
...about grammar."

800
00:58:14,504 --> 00:58:18,904
Colon. "I want to...

801
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:21,784
...make love to...

802
00:58:22,104 --> 00:58:24,183
...your mother."

803
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:27,783
No, you didn't write that.

804
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:33,463
What? I do. I want to.

805
00:58:33,703 --> 00:58:35,463
After we finish the letter.

806
00:58:35,703 --> 00:58:39,783
No, let's make love right now.
Then we write the letter.

807
00:58:40,023 --> 00:58:43,303
Come on, we only had
a couple of sentences to go.

808
00:58:43,623 --> 00:58:46,663
In Europe, you would've
made love first.

809
00:58:47,783 --> 00:58:50,343
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

810
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:53,302
-That I'm not spontaneous?
-I'm not saying that.

811
00:58:53,462 --> 00:58:55,222
But that's what you implied.

812
00:58:55,462 --> 00:58:57,702
That in Europe I'd have
made love, but here--

813
00:58:57,942 --> 00:59:00,022
I don't want us to get to the point...

814
00:59:00,342 --> 00:59:03,702
...where we can't make love unless
there's a concierge downstairs.

815
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:08,502
I wanted to take three minutes
to finish a letter to our children...

816
00:59:08,662 --> 00:59:10,102
...who I haven't seen--

817
00:59:10,262 --> 00:59:13,942
What's that supposed to mean?
That I don't care about our children?

818
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:16,342
If I finish the letter,
I could be spontaneous.

819
00:59:16,502 --> 00:59:19,462
That's not spontaneous!
That's making an appointment!

820
00:59:19,702 --> 00:59:22,341
I was in the mood
for unscheduled affection...

821
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:24,661
...but sorry, we're home. I forgot...

822
00:59:24,821 --> 00:59:27,221
...everything's gotta be
on a schedule!

823
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:31,381
You try raising children
where everything's unscheduled...

824
00:59:31,621 --> 00:59:33,461
...when everything's spontaneous!

825
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:37,061
You know what? The kids need
a little spontaneity too!

826
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,301
I know that!

827
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:43,861
I'm sick and tired of being
the designated driver of this marriage!

828
00:59:44,101 --> 00:59:46,901
Nobody designated you!
It's a role you gave yourself!

829
00:59:47,221 --> 00:59:49,301
Bullshit! You gave me that role!

830
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:53,780
Because God forbid Ben should ever
remember to cancel the newspapers...

831
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,700
...or put washer fluid in his car...

832
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,740
...or participate in disciplining
his children...

833
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:02,100
...instead of flirting on the phone
with your girlfriend!

834
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,100
You're not bringing that up again!

835
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,580
You're damn straight
I'll bring it up again!

836
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,660
I haven't spoken to her
in six months!

837
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,460
Not once have you seen it
through my eyes!

838
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,900
We don't have a pea under our mattress.
You know what we have?

839
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,260
A fucking watermelon!

840
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,740
And you never wanna deal with it!

841
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,740
Oh, fuck it!

842
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,739
Jesus!

843
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,019
Welcome home.

844
01:00:40,259 --> 01:00:41,539
Bye, Dad.

845
01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:43,859
-Thanks.
-I love you.

846
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,659
-Bye, Mom.
-Buddy.

847
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:50,259
Love you.

848
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:52,978
See you guys in a month.

849
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,138
Bye, you guys.

850
01:01:02,098 --> 01:01:03,458
-Bye, Daddy.
-Couple of weeks.

851
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,778
-Watch your toes.
-See you.

852
01:01:05,938 --> 01:01:07,378
Bye, kids.

853
01:01:23,297 --> 01:01:25,697
Do you think we should get
one lawyer or two?

854
01:01:30,337 --> 01:01:31,457
One.

855
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:35,937
Maybe we can at least
make this part....

856
01:01:38,577 --> 01:01:42,817
All I care about is that we make it
as easy for the kids as possible.

857
01:01:47,377 --> 01:01:51,776
I'm sure you noticed the bathroom has
the original tiling from the '20s.

858
01:01:52,016 --> 01:01:52,976
It's nice.

859
01:01:53,136 --> 01:01:56,496
You know, since you're a writer,
I know you'd appreciate...

860
01:01:56,736 --> 01:01:59,216
...that the sister
of Bette Davis' chauffeur...

861
01:01:59,456 --> 01:02:02,736
...once had Thanksgiving
in the apartment next door.

862
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:04,496
Really?

863
01:02:05,536 --> 01:02:07,936
Are there any other kids
in this building?

864
01:02:08,176 --> 01:02:12,176
Oodles! Including, if I might add,
the nephew of the actor...

865
01:02:12,336 --> 01:02:15,696
...who jumped third into
the fourth lifeboat on Titanic.

866
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:18,656
Rent the film, you'll see.
I'll introduce you.

867
01:02:18,896 --> 01:02:22,895
I'm showing it to another family today,
but if you're interested...

868
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:26,095
...I can hold it for you,
give your wife a look-see--

869
01:02:26,335 --> 01:02:27,135
I'm interested.

870
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:31,535
Who wouldn't be? Look how the light
from that window fills the room.

871
01:02:32,175 --> 01:02:33,935
When I showed this apartment...

872
01:02:34,095 --> 01:02:36,895
...to the man who did the voice
of Charlie the Tuna...

873
01:02:37,215 --> 01:02:40,895
...he said, and I quote,
"Wow," unquote.

874
01:02:41,135 --> 01:02:42,975
I think that says it all.

875
01:02:45,615 --> 01:02:47,375
First, you put olive oil...

876
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:49,375
...garlic and tofu.

877
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:52,094
Sauté until garlic turn light brown.

878
01:02:52,414 --> 01:02:55,854
Make sure that your wok have
a strong heat underneath it.

879
01:02:56,094 --> 01:02:59,054
Now take an egg and crack it
to the hot oil.

880
01:03:01,294 --> 01:03:05,214
Make sure all the ingredients
are cooked thoroughly.

881
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,534
You okay?

882
01:03:07,694 --> 01:03:09,854
Yeah, I'm fine.

883
01:03:10,814 --> 01:03:13,054
Now we add some Pad Thai noodle.

884
01:03:14,974 --> 01:03:18,574
I saw Deirdre up at Parents' Weekend,
but I didn't see you.

885
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:20,733
I went up the weekend before.

886
01:03:20,973 --> 01:03:22,893
You know, since the divorce...

887
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:26,813
...it's a lot easier for everyone
if we come up at separate times.

888
01:03:27,213 --> 01:03:30,253
Kevin and I took a great hike
up to that waterfall.

889
01:03:30,413 --> 01:03:32,093
You and Ben take that hike?

890
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,653
Yeah, it was beautiful.

891
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:37,853
Spice it up with some chili pepper.

892
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:41,133
You know, spicy food
make a better lover.

893
01:03:41,453 --> 01:03:43,693
The hotter you eat,
the hotter you get.

894
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:47,533
Well, the spicier the better for me.

895
01:03:49,133 --> 01:03:50,332
Rice vinegar.

896
01:03:54,492 --> 01:03:55,932
Does Ben like Thai food?

897
01:03:58,492 --> 01:04:00,172
You and Ben been to Tommy Tang's?

898
01:04:00,332 --> 01:04:01,772
Ben and I are di--

899
01:04:02,412 --> 01:04:03,612
Separated.

900
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,652
Gee, I had no idea.

901
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:09,292
We're not really telling people.

902
01:04:09,452 --> 01:04:11,292
I understand.

903
01:04:11,772 --> 01:04:14,092
I'm so sorry. How long?

904
01:04:15,132 --> 01:04:19,132
72 hours, four weeks, five years...

905
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:21,691
...depending on when
you start counting.

906
01:04:21,851 --> 01:04:24,971
I'm really sorry.
I know how hard it can be.

907
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:29,691
This will sound crazy...

908
01:04:30,011 --> 01:04:33,371
...but I always enjoyed
Erin and Josh's appointments...

909
01:04:33,611 --> 01:04:36,491
...because it gave me a chance
to get to know you.

910
01:04:37,051 --> 01:04:39,851
But when you called me
about your bite...

911
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:44,651
...I felt myself looking forward to it
because I knew we'd be alone.

912
01:04:45,851 --> 01:04:48,891
And just tell me if it's too soon...

913
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:53,370
...but I wondered if maybe you
wanted to have dinner sometime?

914
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:56,970
We are having dinner.

915
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:02,410
I was thinking of something
that didn't involve a teacher.

916
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:08,010
You always hear people say...

917
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,490
...they stayed too long
in a bad marriage.

918
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:14,490
For the longest time, I never thought
of my marriage as being bad.

919
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:18,410
I thought love was something you
were allowed to fall in and out of.

920
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:20,489
You know, peaks and valleys.

921
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:22,729
But after a while...

922
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:26,249
...the peaks get lower
and further apart.

923
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:30,329
Then one day you find yourself
wondering, "Is this who I really am?

924
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:33,929
Someone who has taken up permanent
residence in the valley?

925
01:05:34,169 --> 01:05:37,929
Or is this just who I am
with this person?"

926
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,849
And then, you ask yourself:

927
01:05:42,089 --> 01:05:45,689
"Maybe there is another version
of my life, of myself...

928
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:48,169
...that's a happier one. "

929
01:06:05,448 --> 01:06:06,888
Bullshit.

930
01:06:08,568 --> 01:06:11,768
"Yossel looked into Minnie's eyes
and felt...

931
01:06:13,368 --> 01:06:14,648
...nothing.

932
01:06:14,968 --> 01:06:19,207
For two years they'd been apart.

933
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:22,807
And now, as she stepped off the boat...

934
01:06:23,047 --> 01:06:26,087
...he realized he was
looking into the eyes...

935
01:06:27,527 --> 01:06:29,047
...of a stranger.

936
01:06:31,127 --> 01:06:33,447
A girl he no longer knew.

937
01:06:34,087 --> 01:06:37,607
He had become an American.

938
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:43,047
And she was still the poor...

939
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:48,167
...unaffectionate...

940
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,486
...daughter...

941
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:55,606
...of a blind Lithuanian
violin maker."

942
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:00,806
It's fear. It was all about fear.
Fear's what kept them together.

943
01:07:01,046 --> 01:07:04,406
This whole time I've idealized
my grandparents' marriage.

944
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,126
But this was not the love of the ages.

945
01:07:07,446 --> 01:07:10,566
The two stayed together
because they were terrified.

946
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,926
Fear of loneliness, fear of failure,
fear of the unknown.

947
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:17,766
Sure, fear. That's the main
motivator for everything.

948
01:07:18,006 --> 01:07:21,445
That and guilt are the two emotions
that keep a society humming.

949
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:24,005
You and Rachel stay together
because of fear?

950
01:07:24,245 --> 01:07:26,005
-In a word, yes.
-You're okay with that?

951
01:07:26,325 --> 01:07:28,485
In three words, yes and no.

952
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,885
See, it's not that simple.
You're looking for clear-cut answers.

953
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:36,565
In reality, there's nothing clear-cut.
Life is not clear-cut.

954
01:07:36,805 --> 01:07:38,805
Life is gray.

955
01:07:39,045 --> 01:07:40,325
For instance:

956
01:07:42,165 --> 01:07:44,005
What do you see right here?

957
01:07:46,005 --> 01:07:49,284
-What are you asking me?
-I'm asking you, what do you see?

958
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,044
I see your ass.

959
01:07:51,444 --> 01:07:55,684
That's what you think you see.
But in reality, there is no ass.

960
01:07:57,284 --> 01:08:00,164
What the f--?
What are you telling me?

961
01:08:00,404 --> 01:08:05,124
There is no ass, just the fatty part
at the top of each leg...

962
01:08:05,364 --> 01:08:07,844
...that is butted up
against each other.

963
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,524
Hence the word "butt."

964
01:08:09,844 --> 01:08:11,524
See, essentially...

965
01:08:11,764 --> 01:08:15,444
...what we're dealing with here is
just a continuation of the leg.

966
01:08:15,684 --> 01:08:17,843
Okay, all right, now you lost me.

967
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:22,403
It's all illusions.
There is no such thing as an ass.

968
01:08:22,643 --> 01:08:26,963
Just like there's no such thing as
the perfect marriage, job or child.

969
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:31,443
The whole notion of staying together
and living happily ever after...

970
01:08:31,683 --> 01:08:33,043
...all illusions.

971
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:36,003
You're saying you don't believe
in everlasting love?

972
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:40,883
You're seeing the ass again
and not the tops of the legs.

973
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:45,443
Love is just lust in disguise.
And lust fades.

974
01:08:45,683 --> 01:08:49,282
So you damn well better be
with someone who can stand you.

975
01:08:49,522 --> 01:08:53,202
Katie and I have moved way past
being able to stand each other.

976
01:08:53,442 --> 01:08:55,522
We've moved right
into the hatred part.

977
01:08:55,762 --> 01:08:58,562
I wouldn't worry about it.
Hate fades.

978
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,282
Hate fades?

979
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:07,602
That's what you're gonna send me out
into the world with?

980
01:09:07,842 --> 01:09:11,602
"Hate fades. Love is lust.
There is no ass."

981
01:09:12,802 --> 01:09:15,602
What a disappointment
you've turned out to be.

982
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:20,321
Just promise me one thing.

983
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:24,401
Please promise me that you will not
say any of this to Rachel.

984
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:27,361
Are you crazy?
This conversation ends here.

985
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:30,561
When Stan called me,
I couldn't believe it.

986
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:32,801
I knew it was rough for you guys--

987
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:36,081
We didn't wanna say until we knew
we weren't getting back together.

988
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:37,841
Oh, my God.

989
01:09:40,561 --> 01:09:41,681
How are you doing?

990
01:09:41,921 --> 01:09:44,801
I don't know.
I thought I'd be devastated.

991
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,440
Maybe it just hasn't hit me.

992
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,280
-You're having an affair.
-What are you talking about?

993
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,320
You're only not devastated
if you're seeing someone else.

994
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,160
I'm not seeing someone else.

995
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,320
Are you serious about
who you're not seeing?

996
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,960
I don't know.
I know he's nothing like Ben.

997
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,160
He's responsible, plans ahead,
has a Swiss Army knife.

998
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,000
He even wants to cook me dinner.

999
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,760
-He's a sandbag.
-A what?

1000
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,480
He's just a sandbag
against the storm...

1001
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,680
...holding off the inevitable
devastation.

1002
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:20,239
Rachel, you okay?

1003
01:10:22,959 --> 01:10:24,159
Honey?

1004
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,079
I'm sorry.

1005
01:10:29,519 --> 01:10:32,959
I know I'm supposed to be the one
holding your hand...

1006
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,119
...but I just feel terrible.

1007
01:10:35,839 --> 01:10:39,199
I mean, the thought of you guys
not being together....

1008
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,719
You're our best friends.

1009
01:10:41,519 --> 01:10:45,359
Fourth of Julys and Thanksgivings
and Christmases.

1010
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:48,638
You guys were our
Fred and Ethel Mertz.

1011
01:10:49,118 --> 01:10:51,998
We thought you guys were
our Fred and Ethel Mertz.

1012
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:54,478
Really?

1013
01:10:54,798 --> 01:10:58,878
I never thought this was
going to happen to me and Ben.

1014
01:10:59,118 --> 01:11:02,718
I thought we were going to be the ones
to go the distance.

1015
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:07,758
But I just couldn't seem to get him
to put down that purple crayon.

1016
01:11:08,718 --> 01:11:12,718
But that's Ben.
That's who you fell in love with.

1017
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:15,838
Katie, you are at 80
who you are at 8.

1018
01:11:16,078 --> 01:11:18,637
People don't change!

1019
01:11:19,037 --> 01:11:22,237
People change over time.
You've got to expect that.

1020
01:11:22,397 --> 01:11:27,357
The only way a relationship works is
if people grow and change together.

1021
01:11:28,637 --> 01:11:30,557
Mr. and Mrs. Cogen, Mr. Jordan.

1022
01:11:30,877 --> 01:11:35,117
Nice to have you tonight. Is Mrs.
Jordan not joining us this evening?

1023
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:39,197
No, she's not. Stan, I told you
to make the reservation for three!

1024
01:11:39,437 --> 01:11:41,757
-I forgot.
-How could you forget that?

1025
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:44,557
Say it louder. The guy
in the lot didn't hear you.

1026
01:11:44,797 --> 01:11:46,396
It wasn't that loud.

1027
01:11:53,116 --> 01:11:55,196
Did you see Sunday's 7 down?

1028
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,676
-I missed that one.
-Five-letter word.

1029
01:11:57,996 --> 01:12:00,316
"Wants, requirements."

1030
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,556
Rhymes with weeds.

1031
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:03,836
"Needs"?

1032
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:06,796
Exactly.
It was a direct attack on me.

1033
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:08,956
Come on. You're being silly.

1034
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:11,436
It was just a clue
in a crossword puzzle.

1035
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:15,915
I know my wife.
She was specifically attacking me.

1036
01:12:16,235 --> 01:12:17,435
And for what?

1037
01:12:17,755 --> 01:12:19,435
For having needs.

1038
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:22,395
Like having needs is
some terrible thing.

1039
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:25,915
Show me one person
that doesn't have needs.

1040
01:12:28,475 --> 01:12:31,595
Try this bread dipped in
the olive oil. It's delicious.

1041
01:12:31,835 --> 01:12:33,275
Stan, give Ben the bread!

1042
01:12:33,595 --> 01:12:34,795
Why must you yell?

1043
01:12:34,955 --> 01:12:36,235
-Who yelled?
-You.

1044
01:12:36,475 --> 01:12:37,275
That's not a yell.

1045
01:12:37,595 --> 01:12:39,915
He hears everything as a yell.

1046
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:42,475
On anyone's yell-o-meter,
that was a yell.

1047
01:12:42,715 --> 01:12:44,875
Was that a yell?
He didn't hear it as a yell.

1048
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:47,274
His mom was a yeller.
He still hears her.

1049
01:12:47,514 --> 01:12:49,994
How could I hear her?
You drown her out.

1050
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:51,274
It's true.

1051
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:53,834
The last few years,
when Katie opened her mouth...

1052
01:12:54,154 --> 01:12:55,914
...all I'd hear was her mother.

1053
01:12:56,874 --> 01:12:57,914
Dot.

1054
01:12:58,714 --> 01:13:03,194
It wasn't easy for Katie to be raised
by a woman as complicated as Dot.

1055
01:13:03,514 --> 01:13:05,434
Please, she wasn't complicated.

1056
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:09,434
She was an idiot who made
everyone else's life complicated.

1057
01:13:09,674 --> 01:13:13,114
You wouldn't believe the beautiful
psychological heirlooms...

1058
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:15,513
...this snapping turtle handed down.

1059
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:18,313
Everything's gotta be
in a neat little box...

1060
01:13:18,553 --> 01:13:20,873
...with a little blue bow on it.

1061
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:22,553
Punctual.

1062
01:13:22,793 --> 01:13:23,993
Ordered.

1063
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,353
God forbid anything unexpected
should happen...

1064
01:13:27,593 --> 01:13:30,953
...any perchances, happenstances...

1065
01:13:31,193 --> 01:13:33,993
...left turns, serendipities!

1066
01:13:34,233 --> 01:13:36,793
Nope, no way! Not allowed!

1067
01:13:37,033 --> 01:13:39,433
Out-of-bounds! Foul ball!

1068
01:13:39,673 --> 01:13:43,753
15-yard penalty!
Too much time being spontaneous!

1069
01:13:43,993 --> 01:13:47,112
Everything's gotta be connected.
Gotta connect the dots.

1070
01:13:47,352 --> 01:13:49,432
Maybe that's why they call her Dot.

1071
01:13:49,672 --> 01:13:53,192
You notice that her name wasn't
Gay or Joy or Fun!

1072
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:54,792
Try the bread--

1073
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:57,592
You can't even fuck
unless everything's just right!

1074
01:13:58,232 --> 01:14:02,472
Like a plane waiting for takeoff.
Windows shut? Check.

1075
01:14:02,712 --> 01:14:06,312
Doors locked? Check!
Heat on? Check!

1076
01:14:06,552 --> 01:14:09,352
Have we covered every possible,
single reason...

1077
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:11,192
...why everything is my fault?!

1078
01:14:11,512 --> 01:14:16,071
Houston, we got a problem
and her name is Dot!

1079
01:14:16,231 --> 01:14:19,191
-Ben, bread.
-There are people like Katie and Dot...

1080
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:22,071
...who color inside the lines,
and people like you...

1081
01:14:22,311 --> 01:14:25,511
...who wander outside.
That can be a very endearing quality.

1082
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:29,111
That's why Katie fell in love
with you. Once you have kids--

1083
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:31,031
I am not a third child!

1084
01:14:31,351 --> 01:14:33,991
Excuse me if my watch
has no hands on it.

1085
01:14:34,231 --> 01:14:37,991
That's fine. It's just, somebody
has to establish the routine--

1086
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:40,551
Are you saying it's all my fault?!

1087
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:43,031
It's nobody's fault!

1088
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:46,390
When people say it's nobody's fault,
they don't mean that.

1089
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:50,070
They mean it's your fault!
The nobody's fault things are...

1090
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:53,910
...hurricanes, earthquakes,
tornadoes, acts of God!

1091
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,070
But when a marriage fails,
it's gotta be somebody's fault!

1092
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:59,510
And it's not mine!

1093
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:04,230
Take that fucking bread and shove it
up the tops of your legs!

1094
01:15:47,348 --> 01:15:51,588
Maybe I'm tired! Maybe I'm dealing
with 5000 things all day long!

1095
01:15:51,828 --> 01:15:54,388
Maybe every need you have
doesn't have to be met...

1096
01:15:54,628 --> 01:15:56,948
...at the exact moment
you need it to be met!

1097
01:15:57,108 --> 01:16:00,868
I'm sick and tired of being
the designated driver of this marriage!

1098
01:16:01,108 --> 01:16:03,988
Nobody designated you!
It's a role you gave yourself!

1099
01:16:04,308 --> 01:16:07,188
Not once have you seen it
through my eyes!

1100
01:16:07,508 --> 01:16:10,868
We don't have a pea under our mattress.
You know what we have?

1101
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,508
A fucking watermelon!

1102
01:16:23,507 --> 01:16:24,947
You okay?

1103
01:16:26,787 --> 01:16:28,627
Take me to Katie's.

1104
01:16:33,507 --> 01:16:35,187
What are you doing here?

1105
01:16:35,827 --> 01:16:38,307
I wanted to know what
your high was today.

1106
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:42,147
You should've called.

1107
01:16:42,787 --> 01:16:44,546
My high was about you.

1108
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:50,626
Tonight I saw myself
through your eyes.

1109
01:16:55,586 --> 01:16:56,786
And I'm sorry.

1110
01:16:57,186 --> 01:16:58,786
It might be a nice touch...

1111
01:16:59,026 --> 01:17:02,226
...if you add some roasted peanuts
to the sesame--

1112
01:17:08,466 --> 01:17:11,586
At some point we should discuss
how to tell the children.

1113
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:45,664
How you doing? Come on in.

1114
01:17:46,784 --> 01:17:48,144
This is nice.

1115
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:49,344
Thanks.

1116
01:17:49,584 --> 01:17:52,544
It's close to the park.
The kids and I can walk.

1117
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:54,944
You want something to drink?

1118
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:57,984
I'll take water if you don't have
anything else.

1119
01:18:00,624 --> 01:18:02,624
We have pretty much
anything you want.

1120
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,784
Beer, Gatorade...

1121
01:18:04,944 --> 01:18:07,184
...fruit juice, iced tea.

1122
01:18:07,424 --> 01:18:09,024
Iced tea is fine.

1123
01:18:16,623 --> 01:18:17,503
Here you go.

1124
01:18:18,143 --> 01:18:19,583
You have a watch.

1125
01:18:22,063 --> 01:18:23,423
Come on in.

1126
01:18:25,503 --> 01:18:26,783
Sit down here.

1127
01:18:37,023 --> 01:18:39,023
I think we should....

1128
01:18:40,943 --> 01:18:45,182
When we pick the kids up Thursday,
we should just tell them that night.

1129
01:18:46,302 --> 01:18:49,262
We don't have to tell them right away.

1130
01:18:49,502 --> 01:18:50,702
Why?

1131
01:18:51,022 --> 01:18:53,502
What will change
between now and Thursday?

1132
01:18:55,662 --> 01:18:57,822
Katie, you're seeing someone else.

1133
01:18:58,142 --> 01:19:00,302
I'm not seeing him.

1134
01:19:00,622 --> 01:19:02,462
We're just talking.

1135
01:19:04,382 --> 01:19:05,422
Right.

1136
01:19:09,022 --> 01:19:12,541
I won't put up with any more of this
bullshit lying to the kids.

1137
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:16,461
We take them to Chow Fun's, their
favorite restaurant, to tell them.

1138
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:19,421
We can't really talk at Chow Fun's.

1139
01:19:19,661 --> 01:19:22,061
We'll go to the house
and tell them at dinner.

1140
01:19:22,381 --> 01:19:23,261
After dinner.

1141
01:19:23,581 --> 01:19:26,141
We'll all sit down and....

1142
01:19:26,381 --> 01:19:28,861
Jesus, how do we say this?

1143
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:36,221
We'll just tell them
how much we love them...

1144
01:19:37,181 --> 01:19:39,341
...how amazing and beautiful
they are...

1145
01:19:39,581 --> 01:19:42,700
...so they don't think
that any of this is their fault.

1146
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,860
That's the important thing.

1147
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,220
We'll just say that...

1148
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,540
...Mommy and Daddy...

1149
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,300
...or Mom and Dad....

1150
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,380
You think Mom and Dad?

1151
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:57,900
Mommy and Daddy.

1152
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:02,700
We'll say that Mommy and Daddy
have grown apart.

1153
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:07,100
I was just thinking about Erin.
She'll probably say something like:

1154
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:11,020
"Well, there must be something right
about you guys...

1155
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:15,339
...for you to produce
such beautiful and amazing kids."

1156
01:20:19,019 --> 01:20:21,739
She might say something like that,
you know?

1157
01:20:30,699 --> 01:20:33,019
We'll just tell her that they were...

1158
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:36,619
...born in love and we'll
always love them...

1159
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:39,579
...but Mommy and Daddy
don't love each other anymore.

1160
01:20:41,498 --> 01:20:45,418
Well, wouldn't it be better
if we told them...

1161
01:20:48,378 --> 01:20:51,738
...we still love each other,
but in a different way?

1162
01:20:53,658 --> 01:20:54,778
Fine.

1163
01:20:56,058 --> 01:20:58,778
-We shouldn't say that?
-I said it was fine.

1164
01:20:59,658 --> 01:21:02,618
Well, it was kind of a weird "fine."

1165
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:08,298
Should I be thrilled about how we
love each other in a different way?

1166
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:22,377
-Who is it?
-Mr. Jordan, your couch is here.

1167
01:21:22,537 --> 01:21:25,577
Where have you guys been?
Come on in.

1168
01:21:27,097 --> 01:21:29,977
They were supposed to be here
first thing this morning.

1169
01:21:36,297 --> 01:21:39,017
I'll pick you up at 5:00
on Thursday?

1170
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:54,536
So is there...

1171
01:21:55,816 --> 01:21:57,736
...anything else
we need to talk about?

1172
01:21:58,136 --> 01:21:59,176
Like what?

1173
01:22:02,536 --> 01:22:03,576
Nothing.

1174
01:22:06,856 --> 01:22:07,896
Bye.

1175
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:30,855
What happened to you?

1176
01:22:31,175 --> 01:22:34,215
What happened to that fun girl
with the pith helmet?

1177
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:38,455
You don't think I ask myself
that every day?

1178
01:22:38,775 --> 01:22:40,534
I'm talking about a connection!

1179
01:22:40,694 --> 01:22:45,014
A look! Something that says
that we're on the same side here!

1180
01:22:46,054 --> 01:22:48,534
Isn't this the moment
where one of us says:

1181
01:22:48,854 --> 01:22:50,854
"This is ridiculous.
We love each other.

1182
01:22:51,094 --> 01:22:54,214
All couples go through this.
Let's give it another try"?

1183
01:23:07,334 --> 01:23:09,334
It was supposed to rain today.

1184
01:23:10,773 --> 01:23:12,213
Glad it didn't.

1185
01:23:13,413 --> 01:23:14,693
Me too.

1186
01:23:19,253 --> 01:23:21,413
Turn here. If you take Sepulveda....

1187
01:23:24,053 --> 01:23:25,013
What?

1188
01:23:26,453 --> 01:23:27,573
Nothing.

1189
01:23:41,172 --> 01:23:43,572
Do you, Katie, take Ben...

1190
01:23:43,812 --> 01:23:45,732
...to have and to hold...

1191
01:23:45,972 --> 01:23:48,132
...in sickness and in health...

1192
01:23:48,372 --> 01:23:50,292
...for better or for worse...

1193
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:53,492
-...till death do you part?
-I do.

1194
01:23:56,932 --> 01:23:58,772
It's a boy.
It's a girl.

1195
01:23:58,932 --> 01:23:59,892
It's a bunny!

1196
01:24:00,132 --> 01:24:01,412
It's a home run!

1197
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:02,932
It's chickenpox.

1198
01:24:03,092 --> 01:24:04,052
It's over.

1199
01:24:04,212 --> 01:24:05,492
I love you.

1200
01:24:05,732 --> 01:24:06,612
Damn you!

1201
01:24:06,772 --> 01:24:07,652
I love you.

1202
01:24:08,612 --> 01:24:09,492
Damn it!

1203
01:24:09,651 --> 01:24:10,691
I love you.

1204
01:24:10,931 --> 01:24:12,611
I love you. I love you. I love you.

1205
01:24:12,771 --> 01:24:14,131
I hate you!

1206
01:24:14,371 --> 01:24:16,211
Fuck me. Fuck me.

1207
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:17,331
Fuck you!

1208
01:24:20,851 --> 01:24:21,971
I love you.

1209
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:23,171
I'm pregnant.

1210
01:24:23,411 --> 01:24:24,611
My goldfish died.

1211
01:24:24,771 --> 01:24:25,891
My hamster died.

1212
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:26,931
My father's dying.

1213
01:24:27,171 --> 01:24:28,371
I'm pregnant.

1214
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:50,530
Maybe we should separate.

1215
01:25:30,129 --> 01:25:32,129
Mom! Dad!

1216
01:25:32,369 --> 01:25:33,649
You ready?

1217
01:25:38,369 --> 01:25:40,768
What's up? It's good to see you.

1218
01:25:41,008 --> 01:25:42,448
How you doing?

1219
01:25:43,728 --> 01:25:44,848
What's the matter?

1220
01:25:45,328 --> 01:25:47,648
She just missed you, that's all.

1221
01:25:47,808 --> 01:25:50,288
You've both just grown so big.

1222
01:25:50,528 --> 01:25:53,088
Look at you guys.
I hardly recognize you. Wait.

1223
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:55,328
Which one is Erin?

1224
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:57,728
Check it out, Dad.

1225
01:25:58,368 --> 01:26:02,208
I guess we know what your high
is today. "Best All-Around Camper."

1226
01:26:02,368 --> 01:26:03,808
Congratulations. Look.

1227
01:26:04,048 --> 01:26:07,328
I guess this calls for a celebration!
Come on! Riverdance!

1228
01:26:07,968 --> 01:26:10,447
I'm the best all-around Riverdancer

1229
01:26:10,687 --> 01:26:14,047
Come on. Kind of like
a little "Latin Lupe Lu" thing.

1230
01:26:14,847 --> 01:26:16,367
Go with the big finish!

1231
01:26:16,847 --> 01:26:18,367
Come on! What?

1232
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:22,047
-I have to see these kids next summer.
-Come on, we're hungry.

1233
01:26:22,767 --> 01:26:24,847
Okay. All right.

1234
01:26:30,527 --> 01:26:31,487
Let's go home.

1235
01:26:44,446 --> 01:26:46,766
I think we should go to Chow Fun's.

1236
01:26:55,246 --> 01:26:56,766
Chow Fun's?

1237
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:01,646
We agreed that we
couldn't talk at Chow Fun's.

1238
01:27:02,206 --> 01:27:03,486
I know.

1239
01:27:05,326 --> 01:27:06,446
What are you saying?

1240
01:27:06,766 --> 01:27:08,765
I'm saying Chow Fun's.

1241
01:27:13,085 --> 01:27:16,125
Are you saying Chow Fun's
because you can't face telling them?

1242
01:27:16,365 --> 01:27:18,925
If that's why, don't say Chow Fun's.

1243
01:27:19,165 --> 01:27:23,485
That's not why. I'm saying Chow Fun's
because we're an "us."

1244
01:27:24,765 --> 01:27:26,925
There's a history here...

1245
01:27:27,165 --> 01:27:29,965
...and histories
don't happen overnight.

1246
01:27:30,765 --> 01:27:32,685
In Mesopotamia or ancient Troy...

1247
01:27:32,925 --> 01:27:36,845
...or somewhere, there are cities
built on top of other cities...

1248
01:27:37,005 --> 01:27:40,284
...but I don't wanna build
another city. I like this city.

1249
01:27:40,524 --> 01:27:42,204
I know where we keep the Bactine...

1250
01:27:42,444 --> 01:27:45,804
...and what mood you're in
by which eyebrow is higher.

1251
01:27:46,044 --> 01:27:50,684
You always know that I'm quiet in
the morning and compensate accordingly.

1252
01:27:51,004 --> 01:27:53,644
That's a dance you perfect over time.

1253
01:27:53,884 --> 01:27:56,764
And it's much harder
than I thought it would be...

1254
01:27:57,004 --> 01:28:01,324
...but there's more good than bad.
And you don't just give up!

1255
01:28:01,564 --> 01:28:04,044
And it's not for the sake
of the children.

1256
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:06,364
But they're great kids, aren't they?

1257
01:28:06,684 --> 01:28:09,163
And we made them!
I mean, think about that.

1258
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:12,523
There were no people there,
and then there were people.

1259
01:28:12,763 --> 01:28:14,203
And then they grew.

1260
01:28:14,843 --> 01:28:18,683
I won't be able to say to some
stranger, "Josh has your hands" ...

1261
01:28:18,923 --> 01:28:22,523
...or "Remember how Erin threw up
at the Lincoln Memorial?"

1262
01:28:22,763 --> 01:28:25,643
And I'll try to relax.

1263
01:28:26,763 --> 01:28:30,523
Let's face it, anybody will have
traits that get on your nerves.

1264
01:28:30,843 --> 01:28:34,763
Why shouldn't it be your annoying
traits? I'm no day at the beach.

1265
01:28:35,003 --> 01:28:38,682
But I do have a good sense
of direction, so I can find the beach.

1266
01:28:38,842 --> 01:28:41,242
Which is not a criticism of yours...

1267
01:28:42,522 --> 01:28:44,442
...it's just a strength of mine.

1268
01:28:44,682 --> 01:28:49,642
God, you're a good friend.
And good friends are hard to find.

1269
01:28:50,842 --> 01:28:53,082
Charlotte said that
in Charlotte's Web.

1270
01:28:53,322 --> 01:28:55,562
I love the way you read that to Erin.

1271
01:28:55,802 --> 01:28:58,682
You take on the voice of Wilbur
with such commitment...

1272
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:00,602
...even when you're bone tired.

1273
01:29:00,842 --> 01:29:04,922
That speaks volumes about character.
And ultimately...

1274
01:29:05,482 --> 01:29:08,681
...isn't that what it comes down to?
What a person's made of?

1275
01:29:09,161 --> 01:29:12,521
Because that girl
in the pith helmet...

1276
01:29:12,761 --> 01:29:14,441
...is still in here.

1277
01:29:17,721 --> 01:29:20,921
I didn't even know she existed
until I met you.

1278
01:29:21,081 --> 01:29:23,241
And I'm afraid if you leave...

1279
01:29:24,201 --> 01:29:26,041
...I may never see her again.

1280
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:30,041
Even though I said you beat her
out of me. Isn't that the paradox?

1281
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:33,721
Haven't we hit the essential paradox?
Give and take, push and pull.

1282
01:29:33,961 --> 01:29:36,920
The best of times, the worst of times.
Dickens said it best.

1283
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:41,000
The Jack Sprat of it. He could eat
no fat. His wife could eat no lean.

1284
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:45,480
But that doesn't apply here, does it?
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

1285
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,400
...I'm saying Chow Fun's because...

1286
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,640
...I love you.

1287
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,280
I love you too.

1288
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:11,879
Did you hear that, kids?

1289
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:14,759
Your mom wants to go to Chow Fun's!

1290
01:30:15,799 --> 01:30:18,519
Isn't that great?
I love Chow Fun's!

1291
01:30:18,839 --> 01:30:21,319
The egg rolls are good,
but not that good.

1292
01:30:21,639 --> 01:30:23,559
The egg rolls are fantastic!

1293
01:30:23,719 --> 01:30:25,959
They're warm, crispy,
greasy as all hell.

1294
01:30:26,279 --> 01:30:28,919
-Everything you want in an egg roll!
-Exactly!

1295
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:30,599
High/Low. Erin, you first.

1296
01:30:30,919 --> 01:30:33,799
My high for the summer is,
Austin wrote me 111 times.

1297
01:30:34,119 --> 01:30:36,438
How did you come up
with High/Low anyway?

1298
01:30:36,678 --> 01:30:39,318
I don't know.
But I've got another game.

1299
01:30:39,478 --> 01:30:42,278
I'm thinking of seven words.
What are they?

1300
01:30:42,678 --> 01:30:44,358
Do I get a hint?

1301
01:30:44,678 --> 01:30:45,478
A category?

1302
01:30:45,718 --> 01:30:48,758
-Any seven words in English.
-That's right.

1303
01:30:49,078 --> 01:30:50,278
Fair enough.

1304
01:30:51,318 --> 01:30:54,038
"MacArthur Park is melting
in the dark."

1305
01:30:57,398 --> 01:31:00,518
"And they lived happily ever after."

1306
01:31:01,398 --> 01:31:03,958
That's six words,
but you're very close.

1307
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:08,517
"And they lived mostly happily
ever after"?

1308
01:31:09,317 --> 01:31:10,677
I hope so.

1309
01:31:11,397 --> 01:31:12,997
I think so.

1310
01:31:14,917 --> 01:31:16,117
Think so?

1311
01:31:16,677 --> 01:31:17,877
I do.

1312
01:31:19,237 --> 01:31:20,517
I do...

1313
01:31:20,997 --> 01:31:22,117
...too.

1314
