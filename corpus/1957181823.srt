00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,336
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

24
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,138

APPARENTLY, THE MOST POPULAR
ROLE-PLAY FANTASY

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,452
IS THE "NURSE" FANTASY--

00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,787
LIKE, IF I WAS GONNA DO
THE "NURSE" FANTASY FOR MY MAN,

OF ALL THE JOBS
YOU DON'T HAVE IN REAL LIFE.

107
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:07,281
HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF BEING
A DOCTOR IN THE BEDROOM,

I HAD A GUY SAY TO ME--
I SWEAR TO GOD-- HE WAS LIKE,

112
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,224
"I WANT YOU TO BE
A STRIPPER FOR ME."

"AND TAKE YOUR MONEY?

AND A SHITTY SUN TATTOO,

118
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,138

00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:46,387
THE STRIPPER FANTASY."
I TOLD HIM, I WAS LIKE,

00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,131
CAN SOMEONE JUST EXPLAIN,

172
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,533
WHY DO ALL BALLS LOOK LIKE

173
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,702
THEY'RE 150-YEARS-OLD?

174
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:45,506
[laughter, cheers, applause]

175
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,609
[women cheering]

176
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:52,045
LIKE, CAN YOU PUT SOME SUNSCREEN
ON THAT, PLEASE?

177
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,648
MAYBE SOME LIP BALM
OR SOMETHING-- THAT'D BE GOOD.

178
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,851
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS ASHY.
WHY ARE THEY ALWAYS...

179
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,220
BUT THEY'RE ALSO, LIKE,
STICKY AT THE SAME TIME,

180
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,690
SO IT'S LIKE,
WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE
DOWN THERE?

181
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,324
I CANNOT FIGURE IT OUT.

182
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,227
WHAT IS THAT WETNESS
GOING ON?

183
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,096
LIKE, WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S TEARS.
IT'S PROBABLY TEARS.

184
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,198
THEY'RE CRYING, 'CAUSE THEY
KNOW HOW UGLY THEY ARE.

185
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,066
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

186
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,268
THEY LOOK LIKE THAT THING
HANGING OFF A ROOSTER'S CHIN,

187
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,270
JUST RIGHT...UGH.

188
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,474
OH, AND YOU GUYS
ARE SHAVING 'EM NOW--
YOU THINK THAT HELPS?

189
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,576
DO NOT SHAVE YOUR BALLS.

190
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,277
THE LAST THING THOSE THINGS
NEED TO BE ARE MORE VISIBLE.

191
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,913
NO WAY.

192
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,248
GROW IT OUT,
COVER UP THOSE WEIRD,

193
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,784
BROWN SPLOTCHES
AND...VEINS.

194
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,654
THEY'RE AWFUL.
THEY LOOK LIKE DRIED FRUIT.

195
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,889
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELVES.

196
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,659
HOW DARE YOU?

197
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,694
BUT, LIKE, WOMEN,
WE CAN'T MAKE SEX TAPES.

198
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,030
WE'RE TOO EMOTIONAL, RIGHT?
WE'RE TOO SENSITIVE.

199
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,132
LIKE, IF I WERE TO MAKE
A SEX TAPE WITH SOME GUY,
YOU KNOW, FROM LIKE,

200
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:48,035
FIVE YEARS AGO, POP IN IT NOW,
I WOULDN'T BE LIKE, "OH, YEAH!"

201
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,404
I'D BE LIKE, [crying mockingly]
"OH, MY GOD. I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

202
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,641
"I'M GONNA
FIND HIM ON FACEBOOK.

203
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,475
- I'M GONNA..."
- [laughter]

204
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,511
I'M JUST NOT LIKE THAT.

205
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,847
LOOK, I HAVE GIRLFRIENDS
WHO WILL TEXT-MESSAGE

206
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,982
NAKED PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES
TO THEIR MAN,

207
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,084
WHICH I GUESS THE WHOLE POINT
OF THAT IS TO BE LIKE,

208
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,319
"OH, HERE'S WHAT'S WAITIN'
FOR YOU AT HOME, BIG BOY...

209
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,955
PHOTOS."

210
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,857
IF I WAS TO DO

211
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,825
A "HERE'S WHAT'S WAITIN' FOR YOU
AT HOME" PHOTO SHOOT,

212
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,227
I WOULD TAKE SOME PICTURES
OF THE FRICKIN' DISHES, OKAY?

213
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,896
THE BILLS RIGHT NOW.

214
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,832
MY VAGINA'S NOT WAITING FOR YOU
AT HOME AT ALL.

215
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,934
IT'S TRYIN' TO BOOK ME
AN ACTING JOB.

216
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,671
IT IS VERY BUSY RIGHT NOW.
I'M JUST NOT SEXY LIKE THAT.

217
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,807
I FEEL LIKE GIRLS ARE SEXY NOW.
I'M NOT A SEXY GIRLFRIEND.

218
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,475
ALL I DO
IN RELATIONSHIPS
IS FIGHT.

219
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,443
THAT'S ALL I EVER DO
IN RELATIONSHIPS.

220
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,647
BUT THE THING IS THAT WOMEN--
WE ARE AMAZING FIGHTERS, RIGHT?

221
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,684
- [women whooping]
- WE ARE AMAZING FIGHTERS.

222
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:39,119
WE ARE LIKE
EMOTIONAL NINJAS,

223
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,254
- RIGHT?
- [laughter]

224
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,625
OUR FAVORITE TACTIC
IS THE SILENT TREATMENT.
THAT IS OUR JAM, RIGHT?

225
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,526
OUR MAN PISSES US OFF--
"HE PISSED ME OFF.

226
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,528
"I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO HIM
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

227
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,297
I'M GONNA SHOW HIM."

228
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,466
LADIES, "THE SILENT TREATMENT"
IS NOT A PUNISHMENT.

229
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,703
[laughter, applause]

230
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,808
IT'S A FREAKIN' REWARD, OKAY?

231
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,010
HE'S LIKE, "OH, THANK GOD
SHE SHUT THE HELL UP.

232
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,846
"OH, MY GOD.
I LOVE THE SILENT TREATMENT.

233
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:09,650
"I GET TO WATCH SPORTSCENTER
AGAIN TODAY.

234
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,486
I'M GONNA FORGET HER BIRTHDAY
EVERY YEAR."

235
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,155
LADIES, NEXT TIME YOUR MAN
PISSES YOU OFF,

236
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,224
DO NOT GIVE HIM
"THE SILENT TREATMENT."

237
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,861
INSTEAD, GO GOOGLE THE MOST
IMPORTANT GAME OF THE SEASON,

238
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,696
SIT NEXT TO HIM
DURING THAT GAME,

239
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,565
AND JUST ASK AS MANY...

240
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,434
FUCKING QUESTIONS...

241
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,202
AS POSSIBLE.

242
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,771
"I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

243
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:34,207
"WHO'S THAT GUY
IN THE STRIPED SHIRT?

244
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,711
"DOES HE WORK AT FOOT LOCKER?

245
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,512
"I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

246
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,782
"WHY ARE THEY ALL WEARING
THE SAME OUTFIT?

247
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,284
WHEN ARE WE GONNA HAVE
A BABY?"

248
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,486
EVENTUALLY,
HE WILL SHOOT HIMSELF
IN THE FACE,

249
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,188
AND YOU FUCKING WIN
THAT ARGUMENT.

250
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,724
[laughter, applause]

251
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,559
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT A WOMAN

252
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,327
IN AN ARGUMENT, RIGHT?
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED.

253
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,396
'CAUSE WOMEN,

254
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,265
WE NEVER EXPRESS THE EMOTIONS
WE'RE ACTUALLY FEELING, RIGHT?

255
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,233
WHEN WE ARE MOST PISSED OFF,
YOU GUYS, WHAT DO WE SAY?

256
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,069
[happy voice]
"I'M FINE."

257
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,472
"I'M FINE"
MEANS I'M ABOUT TO STAB YOU
IN THE NECK.

258
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,240
- [laughter]
- OKAY?

259
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,409
WOMEN ARE VERY TRICKY.
WE'RE VERY MISLEADING, RIGHT?

260
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,145
NOT ONLY EMOTIONALLY,
ALSO PHYSICALLY,
WOMEN ARE MISLEADING.

261
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,514
LIKE, YOU'LL SEE
A GIRL OUT AT A BAR.
SHE'S LIKE, 5'7".

262
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,350
YOU TAKE HER HOME.
THE SHOES COME OFF.
SHE'S A GNOME, RIGHT?

263
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,252
[laughter]

264
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,121
WE'RE THE SAME WAY EMOTIONALLY,
AND WE ALWAYS EXPRESS

265
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,823
THE OPPOSITE EMOTION
WE'RE FEELING.

266
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,192
WE DO IT WITH OTHER WOMEN,
TOO, RIGHT?

267
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,094
WE'RE ALWAYS, LIKE,
THE OPPOSITE WITH WOMEN.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

268
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,262
LIKE, ONE WOMAN HATES
ANTHER WOMAN.

269
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,164
THE WOMEN SHE HATES
WALKS IN THE DOOR-- IT'S LIKE,

270
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,133
"I CAN'T STAND THAT BITCH.
I CANNOT STAND THAT BITCH.

271
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,668
I HATE THAT BITCH.
I CANNOT STAND
THAT LITTLE SLUT."

272
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,870
[high-pitched voice]
"OH, HI!"

273
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,674
YOU CANNOT FUCK
WITH THAT KIND OF CRAZY, OKAY?

274
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,143
[laughter, applause]

275
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,446
BUT I FEEL LIKE
ALL WE WANT YOU GUYS TO DO

276
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,915
IS ASK US
HOW WE'RE FEELING, RIGHT?

277
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,783
ASK US, "WHAT'S WRONG?"

278
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,019
YOU FINALLY ASK US WHAT'S WRONG,
WHAT DO WE SAY?

279
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,653
"NOTHING."
EVEN IF WE DO ADMIT IT,
IT'S LIKE,

280
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,923
"YEAH, SOMETHING'S WRONG,

281
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,725
"BUT IF YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU."

282
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,592
GUYS, LET ME
EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU, OKAY?

283
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,362
USUALLY WHEN WE'RE PISSED OFF
AT YOU BUT DON'T TELL YOU WHY,

284
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:06,566
IT'S BECAUSE WE SNOOPED
THROUGH YOUR SHIT, OKAY?

285
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,869
CELL PHONES-- WE FOUND
SOMETHING INCRIMINATING,

286
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,603
BUT WE CAN'T YELL AT YOU
ABOUT IT,

287
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,006
'CAUSE THEN
WE'D HAVE TO "ADMIT"

288
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,042
THAT WE SNOOPED
THROUGH YOUR SHIT.

289
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,211
SO WE JUST SILENTLY PUNISH YOU
FOR, LIKE, MONTHS...

290
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,048
UNTIL ONE DAY IT'LL JUST
RANDOMLY EXPLODE OUT.

291
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,483
YOU'LL BE LIKE, "HEY, BABY,
DO YOU WANT TO GO

292
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,052
TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY
FOR DINNER?"

293
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,554
"OH, WHY?!
IS THAT WHERE
'JULIE' WORKS?!"

294
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,357
[laughter, applause]

295
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,697
I SNOOP.
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.

296
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,532
(woman) WOO!

297
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,168
THE PROBLEM WITH WOMEN
AND SNOOPING

298
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,103
IS WE DON'T THINK
WE'RE DOING ANYTHING WRONG,

299
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,939
'CAUSE OUR MINDS CAN TALK US
INTO ANYTHING, RIGHT?

300
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,341
WE COULD RATIONALIZE ANYTHING
IN OUR CRAZY HEADS.

301
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,810
YOU DON'T REALIZE UNTIL LATER,

302
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,812
TILL WE'RE FIGHTING WITH YOU
ABOUT IT,

303
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,114
HOW WE JUSTIFIED IT IN OUR
CRAZY-ASS BRAINS, YOU KNOW?

304
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,616
WE'RE LIKE, "WHAT? I WAS NOT
GOING THROUGH YOUR WALLET, OKAY?

305
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,151
"I WAS JUST CLEANING IT.

306
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,552
[laughter]

307
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,188
YOU'RE WELCOME!"

308
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,557
[laughter, applause]

309
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,493
I THINK THE WORST THING
YOU CAN FIND

310
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,428
WHEN YOU'RE SNOOPING
IS JEWELRY.

311
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,330
THAT'S THE WORST THING, RIGHT?
LIKE, ANOTHER WOMAN'S JEWELRY,

312
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,399
EVEN IF IT'S
AN EX-GIRLFRIEND
OR WHATEVER.

313
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,234
BUT I HAVE FOUND --
HOW PISSED OFF I GOT
ABOUT THE JEWELRY

314
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,870
I FOUND IN MY MAN'S PLACE
WAS DIRECTLY CORRELATED

315
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,939
TO HOW NICE THE JEWELRY WAS.

316
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,474
SO ONE TIME I FOUND THIS REALLY
CRAPPY PLASTIC BRACELET.

317
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,477
I WAS LIKE, "OH, WHAT,
YOU SLEPT WITH SOME GIRL
WHO SHOPS AT 'CLAIRE'S'?

318
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,679
'ACCESSORIES,' IS THAT IT?"

319
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,181
BUT THEN I JUST NAMED
A BUNCH OF STORES

320
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,283
THAT NO MAN
HAS EVER HEARD OF.

321
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,953
I WAS LIKE, "OH, WHAT IS THIS,
FROM 'WET SEAL', HUH?

322
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,255
"WHAT IS THIS,
FROM 'SPIEGEL'?

323
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,325
WHAT IS THIS,
FROM 'Overstock.com'?"

324
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,460
BUT THEN ONE TIME I FOUND
A REALLY, LIKE, NICE,

325
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,063
LIKE, SILVER BRACELET
AND IT HAD, LIKE,
SOME DIAMONDS IN IT.

326
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,233
I DIDN'T YELL AT HIM AT ALL.
I JUST PUT IT ON MY WRIST...

327
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,836
AND HE NEVER
HEARD ABOUT IT AGAIN...

328
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,838
- 'CAUSE I STEAL.
- [laughter]

329
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,772
IT'S MINE NOW, SLUT!

330
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,741
[laughter, applause]

331
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,910
I THINK THAT RELATIONSHIPS
JUST MAKE WOMEN CRAZY.

332
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,079
THEY MAKE
PERFECTLY NORMAL PEOPLE
GO INSANE, RIGHT?

333
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,848
LIKE, I LIKE TO PLAY
A LITTLE GAME,

334
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,382
LIKE, THREE MONTHS
INTO A RELATIONSHIP.

335
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,851
IT'S CALLED,

336
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,453
"LET'S GO THROUGH
YOUR CELL PHONE

337
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,821
"AND DELETE THE CONTACTS...

338
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,389
I DON'T LIKE."

339
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,024
[laughter, applause]

340
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,026
THAT'S WHEN I GET TO
GO THROUGH YOUR PHONE,

341
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,028
YOU GOTTA TELL ME
WHO EVERY GIRL IS IN YOUR PHONE,

342
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,997
AND THEN I DECIDE
IF I FREAKIN' LIKE IT OR NOT.

343
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,665
[laughter, applause]

344
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,433
IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

345
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,336
"LINDSEY"...
SOUNDS LIKE A SLUT.
DELETE THAT.

346
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,874
"RICHARD"...
THAT'S A SLUT FOR SURE.
DELETE THAT.

347
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,609
"MOM"?
THAT'S A WHORE.
DELETE THAT.

348
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,144
YOU GUYS HAVE
YOUR WEIRD STUFF, TOO.

349
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,913
I RECENTLY
NOTICED ABOUT GUYS--

350
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,482
I NOTICED THAT EVERY GUY
I'VE EVER KNOWN,

351
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,251
SOMEWHERE IN HIS HOUSE
OR APARTMENT OR WHATEVER,

352
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:42,822
HAS A JAR
THAT'S FULL OF "COINS"?

353
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,258
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

354
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,027
THE LAST GUY I DATED--
I WAS LIKE,

355
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,896
"OH, MAYBE HE,
LIKE, COLLECTS COINS,

356
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,931
OR MAYBE THAT'S,
LIKE, HIS LAUNDRY MONEY."

357
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,433
NO, THAT WAS
HIS BANK ACCOUNT, OKAY?

358
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,368
[laughter, applause]

359
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,704
LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU, A PIRATE?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

360
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,472
[laughter continues]

361
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,943
I DATE CHEAP GUYS.
I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

362
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,711
I RECENTLY HAD A GUY--
I SWEAR TO GOD--

363
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,480
ASK ME OUT ON A DATE
TO GO GET COFFEE.

364
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,183
IS THAT HAPPENING NOW,
IN THE PLAID SHIRT?

365
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,185
YOU'RE DOIN'
THAT WITH GIRLS NOW?

366
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,754
YOU'RE NOT STRAIGHT.
NO WAY.

367
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,924
[laughter, cheers, applause]

368
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,593
WHAT IS THIS SHIRT?
WHAT ARE WE DOIN' HERE?

369
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,396
WHAT ARE WE DOIN'?
YOU'RE FUCKIN' ON TV.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

370
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,932
[laughter, applause]

371
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,367
YOU'RE FUCKIN'
KILLIN' ME RIGHT NOW.

372
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,769
AND YOU,
DON'T EVEN TRY TO LAUGH.
THIS IS WORSE.

373
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,304
[laughter]

374
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,306
DO YOU SEE HOW HOT
THESE GIRLS ARE?

375
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,708
YOU'RE FUCKIN' BLOWIN' IT.
THIS IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

376
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,710
NO, I LIKE IT.
YOU'RE SEXY.

377
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,212
ARE YOU SINGLE?

378
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,848
- UH--EHH!
- [laughter, applause]

379
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,350
EH--EH--EH!

380
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,918
TOO MUCH CUM IN YOUR MOUTH?
CAN'T TALK?

381
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,954
[laughter, applause]

382
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,022
- OKAY.
- [cheers, applause]

383
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,661
NO, I SERIOUSLY--
I SWEAR TO GOD--

384
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,064
I HAD A GUY ASK ME OUT
ON A DATE TO GO GET COFFEE.

385
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,798
HOW CHEAP IS THAT?

386
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,567
HE'S LIKE,
"HEY, DO YOU WANNA, LIKE,

387
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,269
MAYBE GO GET
SOME COFFEE LATER?"
I WAS, LIKE, "SURE.

388
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,271
"YOU KNOW WHERE THERE'S
REALLY GOOD COFFEE?

389
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,373
"THIS PLACE THAT'S CALLED, UH,
'MORTON'S STEAKHOUSE'...

390
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,807
[laughter]

391
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,776
"YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

392
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,378
[laughter, applause]

393
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,613
"I LOVE A LITTLE COFFEE
WITH MY LOBSTER.

394
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,615
- LET'S GO."
- [laughter]

395
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,151
AND THEN I'M SUCH AN IDIOT
THAT I WENT ON THE COFFEE DATE.

396
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,153
IT WAS AT, LIKE,
4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

397
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,289
AND I SHOWED UP TO GO--
LIKE, I WENT UP TO THE COUNTER

398
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,691
TO PAY FOR MY COFFEE--
IT WAS LIKE $1.70 OR SOMETHING--

399
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,093
AND I GO TO PULL OUT
MY WALLET.

400
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,827
HE CUTS IN FRONT OF ME.
HE GOES,

401
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,597
"NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO...

402
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,665
- I GOT IT."
- [laughter]

403
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,535
OH, REALLY?
ARE YOU GONNA GET SOME COINS
FROM YOUR FRICKIN' JAR?

404
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,270
IS THAT HOW YOU'RE...?

405
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,972
WOMEN ARE CHEAPER
THAN MEN, THOUGH.

406
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,907
IT'S NOT EVEN
THAT WE'RE CHEAP.

407
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,310
WE JUST NEVER EXPECT
TO PAY FOR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

408
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,878
SO MUCH SO,
WE HAVE MASTERED THE ART
OF SOMETHING

409
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,547
THAT I LIKE TO CALL
THE "PUMP FAKE"...

410
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,282
[laughter]

411
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,418
WHICH IS WHEN THE BILL
COMES TO THE TABLE,

412
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,087
WE'LL JUST STICK
OUR HAND IN OUR PURSE...

413
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:59,159
[laughter, applause]

414
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,761
JUST MOVE IT AROUND
FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO

415
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,930
UNTIL YOU GUYS
SIGN THE CHECK.

416
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,398
WE'RE NOT GRABBING ANYTHING.

417
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,300
WE'RE JUST SHUFFLING
SHIT AROUND...

418
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,337
JUST GETTING STABBED
BY PENCILS.

419
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:13,640
IF IT'S A SMALL PURSE,
WE'LL JUST DO THAT.

420
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,143
AND IF IT'S A CLUTCH,
WE'LL JUST FINGER-BANG IT

421
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,977
AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO.

422
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,081
[laughter, applause]

423
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,317
THAT'S WHEN YOU PUT A FINGER
IN SOMEONE'S VAGINA.

424
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:29,989
[laughter, cheers, applause]

425
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,059
I ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S GOIN' ON ANYMORE.

426
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,127
I DON'T KNOW IF THE GUY'S
SUPPOSED TO PAY,

427
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,129
IF THE GIRL'S SUPPOSED TO,
IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SPLIT IT.

428
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,098
I JUST GOT OUT OF A FOUR-YEAR
RELATIONSHIP JUST RECENTLY.

429
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,632
- (man) WOO!
- YEAH, THANKS.

430
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,068
YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT THAT?

431
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,602
- YEAH.
- [laughter]

432
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,371
I'M SINGLE.
YOU WANNA DO THIS RIGHT NOW?

433
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,139
[laughter]

434
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,108
THIS IS A WATER BRA.
THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING.

435
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,809
BUT OTHERWISE...

436
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,078
I'M LIKE, WHAT,
ARE YOU A PEDOPHILE,

437
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,280
- IS THAT IT?
- [laughter]

438
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,615
BUT, NO, I DID, I JUST GOT OUT
OF A FOUR-YEAR RELATIONSHIP.

439
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,784
IT WAS HARD,
BECAUSE WHAT I LEARNED--
AFTER I GOT OUT

440
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,686
OF THE FOUR-YEAR RELATIONSHIP,
I LEARNED THAT WOMEN--

441
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,888
WE'RE NOT GIVEN THE SKILLS
WE NEED TO SURVIVE

442
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,523
IN THE WORLD WITHOUT A MAN.

443
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,024
I LEARNED THIS,
'CAUSE RIGHT AFTER WE BROKE UP,

444
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,826
I GOT A BRAND-NEW CAR.

445
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,095
FOUR DAYS AFTER
I GOT A BRAND-NEW CAR,

446
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,896
I FILLED IT UP
WITH DIESEL FUEL.

447
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,331
(audience)
OH!

448
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,400
NOW, I ALWAYS LOVE
THIS REACTION,

449
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,168
'CAUSE ALL
THE GUYS IN THE AUDIENCE
ARE ALWAYS LIKE,

450
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,637
"OH, GOD!"
AND ALL THE GIRLS
ARE JUST LIKE...

451
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,006
- "SO?"
- [laughter]

452
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,974
LIKE, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT DIESEL FUEL WAS.

453
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,444
I PULLED UP.
THE REGULAR WAS OUT OF ORDER.
THE SUPREME--

454
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,879
I WAS LIKE, "OH, I'LL JUST
FILL IT UP WITH DIESEL FUEL."

455
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,748
AND THERE
WAS A GREEN BUTTON AND A--

456
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,218
I WAS LIKE, "OH, IT'S PROBABLY
BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

457
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,019
'CAUSE IT'S GREEN."

458
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,721
AND THEN YOU GUYS
ARE PROBABLY WONDERING

459
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,723
HOW I GOT THE NOZZLE TO FIT,
BECAUSE A DIESEL NOZZLE

460
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,091
DOESN'T EVEN FIT
IN A REGULAR CAR.

461
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,193
I JAMMED IT IN THERE.

462
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,529
I WAS LIKE,
"I'M SELF-SUFFICIENT,
GODDAMMIT!-- UGH!"

463
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,564
A MILE LATER,
MY CAR WAS A BALL OF

464
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,466
- FIRE...
- [laughter]

465
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,435
BUT WOMEN ARE NOT TAUGHT
PRACTICAL INFORMATION LIKE THIS.

466
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,270
WE'RE NOT TAUGHT
TO LIVE IN REALITY.

467
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,172
WE'RE TAUGHT TO LIVE
IN OUR IMAGINATIONS,

468
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,607
IN A FANTASY LAND, RIGHT?
I REMEMBER-- IT'S TRUE.

469
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,410
GROWING UP, I USED TO HAVE
IMAGINARY TEA PARTIES.

470
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,580
I WOULD PUT IMAGINARY TEA
IN IMAGINARY CUPS AND DRINK 'EM

471
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,484
WITH MY STUFFED ANIMALS,
THAT'S FUCKING CRAZY! OKAY?

472
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,753
LIKE, IN ANY OTHER UNIVERSE,
THAT'S JUST SCHIZOPHRENIA,

473
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,455
RIGHT?

474
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,357
AND THE PROBLEM IS,
IT CARRIES INTO ADULTHOOD.

475
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,392
LIKE, GUYS, YOU EVER GET
IN A FIGHT WITH YOUR GIRL,

476
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,327
AND SHE'S MUCH MORE PISSED OFF
AT YOU THAN SHE SHOULD BE?

477
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,663
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WHOA,
THAT ARGUMENT ESCALATED...

478
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,131
REALLY...FAST."

479
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,699
IT'S 'CAUSE
FOR THE LAST WEEK,

480
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,668
WE'VE BEEN HAVIN'
A FIGHT WITH YOU IN OUR

481
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,770
IMAGINATIONS...

482
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,475
[laughter, cheers, applause]

483
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:32,011
AND IN OUR HEAD,
YOU SAID ALL THE WRONG SHIT.

484
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,248
SO BY THE TIME
WE SEE YOU IN PERSON,
WE'RE LIKE, "OH, YEAH?!

485
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,617
WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU SAID LAST WEEK IN MY MIND!"

486
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,919
[laughter, applause]

487
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,289
I THINK
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT WOMEN DO NOT LEARN,

488
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,524
A LOT OF
PRACTICAL INFORMATION.

489
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,227
LIKE, I DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT A 401(k) WAS
TILL LIKE A MONTH AGO.

490
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,929
I THOUGHT IT WAS A MARATHON.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

491
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,099
I WAS LIKE, "WHY ARE MY FRIENDS
RUNNING IN THIS MARATHON?

492
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,767
"400 MILES?

493
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,803
- FUCK THAT."
- [laughter]

494
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,472
AND THE THINGS THAT ARE SUPPOSED
TO PREPARE WOMEN FOR LIFE DON'T.

495
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,508
LIKE, I WAS IN
THE GIRL SCOUTS.

496
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,710
THE GIRL SCOUTS DOES NOT
TEACH YOU ANY SKILLS, RIGHT?

497
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,346
THE GIRL SCOUTS
BASICALLY TEACHES YOU TO SELL
A BUNCH OF COOKIES

498
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,581
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN
FRICKIN' MAKE, OKAY?

499
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,317
LIKE, IF YOU'RE
TO TAKE THE SKILLS YOU LEARNED
IN THE GIRL SCOUTS

500
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,252
AND APPLY THEM
AS AN ADULT,

501
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,454
YOU'RE SELLING THINGS
TO STRANGERS IN A MINISKIRT.

502
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,723
YOU'RE A HOOKER.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING.

503
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,459
- THAT'S YOUR JOB NOW.
- [laughter, applause]

504
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,561
BUT GUYS LEARN REAL SKILLS.

505
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,630
YOU GUYS GO TO THE EAGLE SCOUTS
AND LEARN HOW TO, YOU KNOW,

506
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,333
- MAKE ROPES AND-- EHH!
- [laughter]

507
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,568
YOU KNOW,
MAKE FIRES AND STUFF.

508
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,037
AND WOMEN DON'T LEARN
THOSE KIND OF SURVIVAL SKILLS.

509
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,406
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH THAT PISSED ME OFF
AFTER THAT HAPPENED TO ME,

510
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,742
BUT THEN I KIND OF, LIKE,
GOT PERSPECTIVE.

511
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,944
I WAS LIKE,
"GUYS MAY KNOW HOW TO MAKE
ROPES AND FIRES AND STUFF,

512
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,912
"BUT WOMEN,
WE CAN MAKE...

513
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,348
'PEOPLE.'"

514
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,383
[laughter, applause]

515
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,719
OKAY, THAT IS
PRETTY BADASS, OKAY?

516
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,155
GIVE ME
THE BACKSEAT OF A TAURUS
AND SOME "SUTTER HOME,"

517
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,923
I CAN DUPLICATE!

518
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,360
[laughter, cheers, applause]

519
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,263
AND GUESS WHAT...

520
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,498
IT COMES OUT
ON A FREAKIN' ROPE.

521
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,734
[laughter, cheers, applause]

522
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,806
IT'S HARD, THOUGH.
GOING FROM A LONG RELATIONSHIP

523
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,208
TO STARTING TO DATE AGAIN
IS VERY DIFFICULT.

524
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,478
'CAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN
A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP,
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE, RIGHT?

525
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,446
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
ANY MAKEUP.

526
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,248
YOU CAN JUST PEE IN FRONT
OF THE PERSON OR WHATEVER.

527
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,849
WHEN YOU'RE
DATING SOMEBODY NEW,

528
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,051
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO BE PERFECT.

529
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,187
LIKE, I'VE BEEN DATING
A NEW GUY, AND I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO BE SO PERFECT.

530
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,656
BASICALLY, THE FIRST,
LIKE, THREE MONTHS
OF ME DATING THIS GUY--

531
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,058
EVERY SECOND
HAS BASICALLY BEEN ME...

532
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,828
TRYING TO NOT FART.
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

533
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,897
EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY.
IT'S JUST LIKE,

534
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,999
"PLEASE DON'T FART.
PLEASE DON'T FART.
PLEASE DON'T FART.

535
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,701
PLEASE DON'T FART."

536
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,269
MY ASS IS IN THE SHAPE
OF ITS FUCKING LIFE.

537
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,671
- THAT'S THE UPSIDE.
- [laughter]

538
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,940
BUT THE HARD PART
IS THAT I'LL SOMETIMES
STAY AT HIS HOUSE

539
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,510
FOR A COUPLE DAYS AT A TIME
AND I HAVE TO HOLD IT IN SO LONG

540
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,712
THAT BY THE TIME I LEAVE,
I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,

541
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,080
SEE YOU LATER."
[loud ongoing fart]

542
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,649
SOMETIMES YOU CAN
CATCH AIR AND LIKE,

543
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,419
- [fart, fart]
- [laughter, applause]

544
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,989
'CAUSE YOU'RE
ALWAYS TRYIN' TO BE PERFECT

545
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,491
FOR THE NEW GUY,
YOU KNOW?

546
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,560
LIKE, WHEN I STAY
AT THIS GUY'S HOUSE--

547
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,495
THE EXTENT
TO WHICH I TRY TO BE
PERFECT FOR THIS GUY--

548
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,632
I WILL WAKE UP AT 6:00 A.M.
WHILE HE'S STILL ASLEEP,

549
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,668
SNEAK INTO THE BATHROOM,
PUT ON A FULL FACE OF MAKEUP,

550
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,538
SNEAK BACK INTO BED,
SO BY THE TIME HE WAKES UP,

551
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,806
I LOOK LIKE
LADY GAGA OR SOMETHING,
WHICH IS SO RIDICULOUS.

552
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,576
WOMEN, WE DO NOT NEED
TO LOOK CUTE IN THE MORNING

553
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,845
FOR OUR MAN--
WE DON'T NEED IT,

554
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,781
BECAUSE GUYS,
BEFORE YOUR EYES EVEN OPEN
IN THE MORNING,

555
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,451
- YOU GUYS HAVE ERECTIONS.
- [laughter, applause]

556
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,553
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S LYING NEXT TO YOU,

557
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,355
AND YOU'RE
JUST READY TO...

558
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,390
HAVE SEX WITH IT, REALLY?
YOU ARE HEATHENS.

559
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,392
YOU GUYS LITERALLY
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.

560
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,627
YOU'RE LIKE,
"[snorting, exhales]--
WHERE'S A HOLE?

561
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,296
- GIVE ME A HOLE."
- [laughter, applause]

562
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,065
IT IS BARBARIC.

563
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,568
[laughter continues]

564
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:44,070
BUT I DO NOT LIKE MORNING SEX.
I DO NOT LIKE MORNING SEX.

565
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,672
SO WHAT I STARTED DOING

566
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:48,174
IS I'LL CUT A HOLE
IN A CANTALOUPE...

567
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:51,277
[laughter, groans, applause]

568
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,279
PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE
FOR A MINUTE...

569
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,314
[laughter, groans]

570
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:58,585
PUT A WIG ON IT,
LEAVE IT IN THE BED,

571
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,253
- AND BOUNCE.
- [laughter, applause]

572
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:02,822
IT'S HARD,
'CAUSE NOW I'M DATING,

573
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,724
AND A LOT OF MY FRIENDS
ARE SETTLING DOWN.

574
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,926
A LOT OF MY FRIENDS
ARE GETTING MARRIED RIGHT NOW,

575
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,661
WHICH IS SO ANNOYING,
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE GUYS
ALWAYS HAVE EXCUSES

576
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,563
WHY THEY DON'T
WANNA GET MARRIED WITH ME.

577
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,732
ALL THESE EXCUSES--
LIKE, ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS,

578
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,502
"WE DON'T HAVE TO GET MARRIED.
IT'S JUST A PIECE OF PAPER."

579
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:17,837
WHICH IS NOT TRUE.
MARRIAGE IS NOT JUST
A PIECE OF PAPER.

580
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,006
IT'S ABOUT
MORE THAN THAT, OKAY?
IT'S ABOUT...

581
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,774
- A DIAMOND.
- [laughter]

582
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,676
YOU THINK
IN THE HISTORY OF TIME

583
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,678
ANY WOMAN WAS EVER LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS,

584
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,246
LOOK AT MY PIECE OF PAPER!"

585
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,248
[high-pitch scream]

586
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,050
- DON'T BE STUPID.
- [laughter]

587
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,219
YOU CAN'T PUT A PIECE OF PAPER
ON eBAY WHEN WE BREAK UP.

588
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,787
THAT'S NOT HELPFUL TO ME.

589
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,623
[laughter]

590
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,258
MY OTHER FAVORITE EXCUSE
THAT I'VE HEARD BEFORE IS,

591
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,660
"YEAH,
WE SHOULDN'T GET MARRIED.

592
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,695
MONOGAMY IS JUST NOT NATURAL."

593
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,363
YEAH,
NEITHER ARE FAKE TITS,
BUT YOU GUYS

594
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,965
FRICKIN' LOVE THOSE!

595
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,635
[laughter, applause]

596
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,203
I HAVE FRIENDS GETTING MARRIED,
SO NOW I GO TO ALL THESE EVENTS.

597
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,006
LIKE, I RECENTLY
HAD TO GO TO A BRIDAL SHOWER
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

598
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,709
NOBODY TOLD ME YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BRING SEX TOYS.

599
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,111
I SHOWED UP WITH A TEAPOT,
LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

600
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,947
[laughter]

601
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,416
AND SEX TOYS
HAVE GOTTEN CRAZY.
THERE WAS ONE--

602
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:06,553
IT WAS A VIBRATOR
THAT HAD FEATHERS?

603
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,388
ON THERE, I WAS LIKE,
"IS THAT IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T
HAD SEX IN SO LONG,

604
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,957
"YOU CAN JUST DUST IT OFF...

605
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,492
[laughter]

606
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,627
AND GET BUSY?"

607
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,463
AND THEN I RECENTLY GOT TO GO
TO A BACHELORETTE PARTY,

608
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,097
WHICH THOSE
ARE ACTUALLY KIND OF FUN.

609
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,932
WE WENT TO A MALE STRIP CLUB,

610
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,768
AND THE THING
THAT CRACKS ME UP ABOUT
MALE STRIPPERS

611
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,637
IS THEY'RE ALWAYS IN, LIKE,
POLICEMEN'S UNIFORMS,

612
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,673
RIGHT, AND LIKE
FIREMEN'S UNIFORMS.

613
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,542
- YOU KNOW
- [laughter]

614
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,712
[whistles, cheers, applause]

615
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,648
MALE STRIPPERS ARE ALWAYS IN
POLICEMEN'S UNIFORMS, FIREMEN'S,

616
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,350
'CAUSE THEY SAY THAT
WOMEN LIKE A "MAN IN UNIFORM."

617
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:41,020
IT'S NOT ABOUT
"THE UNIFORM," OKAY?

618
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,389
WE LIKE MEN "WITH JOBS."

619
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,124
[laughter, cheers, applause]

620
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,393
[chuckles]

621
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:51,397
YOU WILL NEVER SEE
A MALE STRIPPER COME OUT
WITH PAJAMA PANTS ON...

622
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:53,566
HOLDING A VIDEO GAME CONTROLLER
AND A POP-TART.

623
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,768
[laughter, applause]

624
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,837
AND I HAVE TO GO
TO WEDDINGS ALL THE TIME.

625
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,306
AND I THINK THE CRAZIEST PART
ABOUT GOING TO WEDDINGS IS LIKE,

626
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,741
THE CATCHING
OF THE BOUQUET THING,

627
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,676
'CAUSE WOMEN
GET PSYCHO ABOUT--

628
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,512
I WENT IN THERE ONCE
TO TRY TO CATCH THE BOUQUET,

629
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,547
- I GOT SHANKED.
- [laughter, applause]

630
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,315
'CAUSE WHEN THEY SAY
IS THAT IF YOU CATCH THE BOUQUET

631
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,851
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE NEXT WOMAN TO GET MARRIED.

632
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,086
NA-AH, CATCH THE BOUQUET,
SEE IF ONE GUY TALKS TO YOU

633
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,421
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

634
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,590
[laughter]

635
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,926
I HAVE FRIENDS GETTING MARRIED
AND HAVING BABIES NOW, TOO,

636
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,594
LIKE, ON PURPOSE.

637
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,897
- I KNOW.
- [laughter]

638
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,867
I FEEL LIKE WOMEN,
AFTER THEY GIVE BIRTH,
THEY JUST GO INSANE.

639
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,402
LIKE, I HAD A FRIEND OF MINE
WHO HAD A BABY SIX MONTHS AGO,

640
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,204
AND SHE CALLS ME UP,
AND SHE'S LIKE,

641
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,506
"DO YOU WANNA COME OVER

642
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,542
AND WATCH MY BIRTH VIDEO?"

643
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,209
(man)
HAH-HAH-HAH!

644
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,011
I WAS LIKE, UH...

645
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,947
[laughter, applause]

646
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,516
I WAS LIKE,
"HELL, YEAH, I DO."

647
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,685
YOU GUYS,
I WENT OVER THERE.

648
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:48,020
IT WAS THE BIGGEST COOTER
I'VE EVER SEEN...

649
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,522
[laughter, applause]

650
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,090
BUT LIKE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,

651
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,458
LIKE SHAKY-CAM COOTER.

652
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,460
[laughter]

653
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:56,963
IT LOOKED LIKE PORN
FROM DOWNTOWN BAGHDAD, OKAY?

654
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,430
[laughter continues]

655
00:24:58,531 --> 00:24:59,866
AND DID YOU GUYS KNOW THIS?

656
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,768
AFTER THE BABY
COMES OUT OF THERE,

657
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,270
A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER SHIT
COMES OUT, YOU GUYS.

658
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,672
A JELLYFISH FLEW BY.

659
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,807
[laughter, applause]

660
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,976
A TRAMPOLINE
CAME OUT OF THERE.

661
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:13,546
I SWEAR TO GOD, JAMIROQUAI
CAME OUT OF HER THING, GUYS.

662
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,915
IT WAS LIKE
CRAIGSLIST EXPLODED.

663
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,517
I WAS LIKE, "I WANNA GIVE BIRTH
JUST SO I CAN FIND MY CAR KEYS."

664
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,286
- LIKE, WHAT...?
- [laughter, applause]

665
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,622
I THINK ALL OF THAT STUFF--
BABIES AND MARRIAGE--

666
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,657
I THINK THAT
ALL THAT'S ABOUT ROMANCE.

667
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,626
I THINK US WOMEN,
WE ARE OBSESSED
WITH ROMANCE, RIGHT,

668
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,127
AND I THINK WE GET BRAINWASHED
FROM ROMANTIC MOVIES.

669
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,730
I THINK THAT IS WHERE IT COMES
FROM. LIKE, I RECENTLY SAW, UM,

670
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,565
THESE MOVIES CALLED TWILIGHT.

671
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,466
- HAVE WE SEEN THIS MOVIE?
- (male) WOO!

672
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,435
RANDOM YELLING GUY?
YEAH, YOU'VE SEEN IT.

673
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,605
I KNOW YOU HAVE,
FOR SURE.

674
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,573
BUT I RECENTLY SAW
THESE MOVIES TWILIGHT.

675
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,474
THEY ARE SO ROMANTIC.

676
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,910
THIS VAMPIRE'S
MADLY IN LOVE WITH THIS GIRL,

677
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,678
AND THEY'RE SO OBSESSED
WITH EACH OTHER.

678
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,647
THEY BRAINWASH YOU.
I WENT INTO THIS MOVIE.

679
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,348
I WAS LIKE,
"OH, SOME MOVIE ABOUT
HIGH SCHOOLERS."

680
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,783
I CAME OUT OF IT,
I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,

681
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,585
I HAVE TO MARRY A VAMPIRE.
OH, MY GOD."

682
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,654
- [laughter]
- IT MAKES YOU OBSESSED.

683
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,589
GUYS,
DON'T LET YOUR GIRLFRIENDS
SEE THIS MOVIE.

684
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,158
SHE WILL LEAVE
YOUR ASS, OKAY?

685
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,227
AFTER I SAW THE MOVIE,
I WOULDN'T TALK
TO THE GUY I WAS DATING

686
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,095
FOR, LIKE, FIVE DAYS.
FINALLY, HE WAS LIKE,

687
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,764
"BABE, WHAT'S WRONG?"
I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW.

688
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,165
"I KINDA NEED TO DATE
SOMEONE WHO CAN...

689
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,100
- 'FLY.'"
- [laughter]

690
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,102
BUT THIS MOVIE--
I THINK IT PROVES THAT
WOMEN HAVE, LIKE,

691
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,971
A BAD-BOY COMPLEX,
'CAUSE THE VAMPIRE

692
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,206
SAYS TO THE GIRL
IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE--

693
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,708
HE'S LIKE,
"I WANNA KILL YOU.

694
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,710
I WANNA SUCK YOUR BLOOD."

695
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,479
SHE'S LIKE, [innocent voice]
"IT'S OKAY. I TRUST YOU."

696
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,749
[laughter]

697
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,884
AND THEN HE ADMITS

698
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,319
THAT HE'S
KILLED PEOPLE BEFORE,
AND SHE'S FINE WITH IT,

699
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,289
WHICH, ACTUALLY,
I'M SUCH A JEALOUS GIRLFRIEND
THAT IF MY VAMPIRE BOYFRIEND

700
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,660
TOLD ME HE HAD KILLED PEOPLE,
I'D BE LIKE, "WHO WAS SHE?

701
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,562
IS SHE PRETTIER THAN ME,
IS THAT IT?"

702
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,398
- YEAH.
- [cheers, whistles, applause]

703
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,368
I JUST WANT TO DATE A VAMPIRE.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE SO BADASS.

704
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,070
LIKE, DATING A VAMPIRE

705
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,105
WILL LITERALLY SOLVE
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS, RIGHT?

706
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,274
LIKE IF,
IF YOU'RE DATING A VAMPIRE,

707
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:50,576
YOU WOULD
ALWAYS HAVE THE UPPER HAND.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

708
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,444
LIKE, YOU'D BE DRIVING ALONG
WITH YOUR VAMPIRE,

709
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,380
AND HE'D BE LIKE,
"I'M THINKING ABOUT
SEEING OTHER PEOPLE."

710
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,082
YOU'D BE LIKE, "OH, REALLY,
'CAUSE I'M THINKING ABOUT

711
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:58,918
- "PUTTING THE SUNROOF DOWN...
- [laughter]

712
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,120
- "BITCH.
- [laughter continues]

713
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,923
DON'T MAKE ME GO TO GNC
AND GET SOME GARLIQUE."

714
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,458
[laughter]

715
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,696
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH VAMPIRES
IS THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE 20,

716
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,898
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY,
LIKE, 100 YEARS OLD.

717
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,700
SO YOU'D BE DATING
THIS HOT YOUNG GUY

718
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,534
WHO, LIKE, GREW UP
IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION

719
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,203
AND, LIKE,
HATES IRISH PEOPLE.

720
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,171
[laughter]

721
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,573
AND THEN, LIKE,
YOU TAKE HIM OUT TO A NIGHTCLUB,

722
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,442
AND HE'D BE, LIKE,
DOING THE CHARLESTON.

723
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,012
[laughter, applause]

724
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,579
OR, LIKE, YOU THINK
HE'S CHEATING ON YOU,

725
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,248
SO YOU
GO THROUGH HIS JOURNAL.

726
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,017
YOU'RE LIKE,
"WHO THE HELL IS THIS SLUT, HUH?

727
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,319
HARRIET TUBMAN?
WHO THE FUCK IS THAT?!"

728
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,387
YOU GUYS NEED TO BRUSH UP
ON YOUR BLACK HISTORY,

729
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,756
- JUST...
- [laughter]

730
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,424
JUST THAT AREA.

731
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,592
[laughter]

732
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,494
WOMEN GET OBSESSED
WITH ROMANCE.

733
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,463
I THINK IT ALSO COMES FROM
THE NICKNAMES WE GET GROWING UP.

734
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,133
WITH MY DAD GROWING UP,
CALLED ME "PRINCESS," RIGHT?

735
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:50,036
PRINCESS-- HE DRILLED IT
INTO MY HEAD AS A KID THAT
I'M A FRICKIN' PRINCESS.

736
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,904
AND THEN I GREW UP,
AND I GOT TO THE REAL WORLD,

737
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,306
AND I REALIZED
THAT NO ONE ELSE WAS ON BOARD...

738
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,875
[laughter]

739
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,910
WITH THE WHOLE
PRINCESS THING, RIGHT?

740
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,312
PRINCESSES DON'T LOSE
THEIR VIRGINITY AT LOLLAPALOOZA.

741
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,948
THAT'S JUST NOT...

742
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:05,184
[laughter, cheers, applause]

743
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,986
I THINK WE NEED TO START
CALLING KIDS THINGS

744
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,855
TO PREPARE THEM
FOR REAL LIFE.

745
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,589
YOU KNOW,
"GET IN THE CAR, REHAB.
LET'S GO."

746
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,691
[laughter]

747
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,261
WOMEN GET CALLED THINGS
THAT MAKE 'EM
OBSESSED WITH ROMANCE.

748
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,996
GUYS GET CALLED THINGS THAT
MAKE 'EM OBSESSED WITH SPORTS.

749
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,565
YOU GUYS GET CALLED,
LIKE, "CHAMP"...

750
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,001
- EHH.
- [laughter]

751
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,103
"SPORT."
YOU GUYS ARE SO OBSESSED
WITH SPORTS,

752
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,739
YOU GUYS CAN'T EVEN REFER
TO INCREMENTS OF A RELATIONSHIP

753
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,440
WITHOUT REFERRING
TO SPORTS, RIGHT?

754
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,876
"FIRST BASE."

755
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,178
"WE GOT TO SECOND BASE."

756
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,913
LIKE, YOU DON'T SEE
WOMEN RUNNING AROUND
REFERRING TO INCREMENTS

757
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,647
OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS
THROUGH THINGS WE LIKE.

758
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,483
IT'S NOT LIKE,
"LAST NIGHT, ME AND MARK...

759
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,885
UGH! CHANEL PURSE."

760
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:41,253
[laughter, applause]

761
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:47,026
YOU GUYS
ARE SO OBSESSED WITH SPORTS

762
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:49,896
THAT YOU GUYS
WILL WEAR JERSEYS

763
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,498
FOR TEAMS
THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN ON...

764
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,066
[laughter]

765
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,668
BUT YOU THINK
YOU'RE ON THE TEAM.

766
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,437
YOU'LL BE LIKE,
"YEAH, LAST NIGHT I GUESS

767
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,738
" WE JUST DIDN'T SCORE ENOUGH.

768
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,008
[laughter]

769
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,210
LAST NIGHT I GUESS WE JUST
DIDN'T PLAY ENOUGH DEFENSE."

770
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,912
- "'WE'?
- [laughter]

771
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:07,746
"THE REDSKINS
DON'T NEED 'YOU.'

772
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:09,782
[laughter]

773
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,451
"OKAY, THAT'S LIKE
ME WATCHING GREY'S ANATOMY

774
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,720
IN SCRUBS."

775
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,789
[laughter]

776
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:19,191
[whistles]

777
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,394
[cheers, applause]

778
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,564
BUT THEN
AFTER THE SHOW IS OVER,
I'D BE LIKE,

779
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,199
"OH, GOD, WE JUST
COULD NOT SAVE THAT GUY.

780
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,600
I DON'T KNOW."

781
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,438
[laughter]

782
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,106
YOU GUYS LOVE SPORTS SO MUCH,

783
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,408
YOU GUYS CAN'T EVEN
THROW YOUR TRASH

784
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,277
INTO THE GARBAGE NORMALLY.

785
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,880
[laughter]

786
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,950
YOU GUYS HAVE TO SHOOT
YOUR GARBAGE ACROSS THE ROOM

787
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,185
LIKE IT'S
AN NBA BASKETBALL GAME.

788
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,988
LIKE, YOU DON'T SEE WOMEN LIVING
OUT OUR DREAMS WITH OUR TRASH.

789
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,756
I DON'T TAKE, LIKE,
A USED GUM WRAPPER,

790
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:52,591
PUT IT AROUND MY RING FINGER
AND BE LIKE...

791
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,760
[laughter, applause]

792
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:56,795
"BRAD PITT AND I
ARE THINKING ABOUT THE FALL,

793
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:59,031
- SO..."
- [laughter]

794
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,500
YOU GUYS LOVE SPORTS SO MUCH
THAT YOU GUYS--

795
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,136
I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS DO THINGS
YOU WOULD NEVER NORMALLY DO,

796
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,572
JUST 'CAUSE
THEY HAVE SPORTS TERMS
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

797
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,174
LIKE, I HAVE A FEELING

798
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:09,909
THE ONLY REASON
YOU GUYS LIKE BEING SINGLE

799
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,144
IS 'CAUSE IT'S CALLED
"PLAYING THE FIELD,"

800
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,980
'CAUSE YOU GUYS
HAVE CONVINCED YOURSELVES
THAT YOU'RE OUT THERE--

801
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,747
LIKE, "I'M SHOOTIN' AND SCORIN'
WITH THESE CHICKS.

802
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,816
"I'M SHOOTIN' AND SCORIN'.
UH, I'M SUCH A...

803
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,952
I'M PLAYING THE FIELD.
I'M SO GREAT."

804
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,954
NO, YOU'RE
HOME ALONE JERKING OFF
TO PORN ON YOUR COUCH.

805
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,555
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

806
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,424
[laughter, applause]

807
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:26,993
WHICH, I DON'T LIKE PORN.

808
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,061
I DO NOT LIKE PORN BECAUSE...

809
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,863
- [clapping]
- YOU LOVE PORN?

810
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,298
WHAT DO WE LIKE GOIN' ON?"

811
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:33,832
WHAT DO WE HAVE
GOIN' ON UP THERE?

812
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,534
YAY PORN OR NO PORN?

813
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,236
- (male) YAY PORN!
- YAY PORN.

814
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,371
- [cheers, applause]
- OH, GOOD, I LIKE YOU GUYS.

815
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:42,875
D.C., DO YOU GUYS HAVE, LIKE,
POLITICAL PORN, LIKE, KINDA...

816
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,344
LIKE, "OH, LOOK.
IT'S FUCKIN'..."

817
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,279
UH, I DON'T
KNOW ANY POLITICIANS.

818
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,448
- UH...
- [laughter, applause]

819
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,550
[cheers, applause]

820
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,822
I LITERALLY-- THE FIRST THING
THAT CAME TO MIND WAS ART MONK

821
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:58,958
- WHO WAS NOT...
- (male) YEAH!

822
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,527
YOU GUYS ARE PROBABLY
TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THIS.

823
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,861
UM, HE WAS NOT A POLITICIAN.

824
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,330
[laughter]

825
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,232
TEN-YEAR-OLD
IN THE FRONT. OKAY.

826
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,100
[laughter]

827
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,169
I DON'T LIKE PORN,
BECAUSE PORN MAKES YOU REALIZE

828
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:13,005
ALL THE THINGS
YOU'RE NOT DOING RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

829
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,974
EVERY TIME I WATCH PORN,

830
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,742
LIKE, I'M REMINDED
OF ALL THE THINGS I'M NOT DOING.

831
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:18,177
I SAW PORN RECENTLY.

832
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,947
I SAW THAT WOMEN
ARE SHAVING BALD.

833
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,682
THEIR PUBES BALD.
ARE WE DOIN' THIS, D.C.?

834
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,817
- [woman cheering]
- OKAY, I LIKE THIS.

835
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,987
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T.
IT GETS WAY TOO COLD
HERE IN THE WINTER.

836
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:29,621
DON'T SHAVE IT.
YOU'RE 10.

837
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,023
- DON'T.
- [laughter]

838
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,824
DON'T YOU LOOK AT HER.

839
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,826
JUST 'CAUSE
SHE LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE BOY.

840
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,196
- DON'T YOU DARE.
- [oh's, cheers, applause]

841
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,832
I DON'T GET
THE SHAVING YOUR JUNK.

842
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,369
'CAUSE I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.
LIKE, WOMEN ARE DOING THAT NOW."

843
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,938
SO I WENT TO GO SHAVE.
I GOT RAZOR BURN.

844
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,340
I LOOKED LIKE I HAD HERPES
FOR TWO WEEKS, OKAY?

845
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,077
- THAT'S NOT CUTE.
- [laughter]

846
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:53,012
GUYS ARE INTO THAT NOW.

847
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:54,680
YOU GUYS WANT WOMEN
TO LOOK LIKE LITTLE GIRLS,

848
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,115
WHICH IS NOT--
MY WHOLE THING IS

849
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,217
YOU WANT TO DO
A LITTLE-GIRL FANTASY?

850
00:31:58,317 --> 00:31:59,952
LIKE, I ALREADY
CRY AND THROW TANTRUMS
EVERY FUCKING DAY--

851
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,420
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

852
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,155
YOU WANT ME
TO PEE ON YOUR COUCH?

853
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,491
- I CAN DO THAT.
- [laughter]

854
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,959
LIKE, YOU WANT TO DO
A LITTLE-GIRL FANTASY?
HOW 'BOUT YOU PAY ME

855
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,328
AN ALLOWANCE?
LET'S START THERE.

856
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,431
HOW ABOUT YOU PACK ME A LUNCH?
I LIKE THIS IDEA. YES.

857
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,500
[laughter]

858
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,335
I DON'T LIKE PORN,
BECAUSE I THINK IT SETS
THE BAR TOO HIGH.

859
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,404
LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO COMPETE WITH PORN.

860
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,073
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE WOMEN IN PORN
ARE ALWAYS YELLING SO LOUD,

861
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,075
WHICH I GUESS YOU GUYS
THINK THAT'S SEXY.

862
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,411
I'M NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.
I'M VERY QUIET IN THE BEDROOM.

863
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27,913
I LIKE TO KEEP
A VERY LOW PROFILE IN THERE.

864
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:29,615
[laughter]

865
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,318
I WILL OCCASIONALLY
WHISPER ENCOURAGING THINGS.

866
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,819
[laughter]

867
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,387
YOU KNOW, I'LL BE LIKE,

868
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,755
"GOOD JOB.

869
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:41,093
[laughter, applause]

870
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,431
"I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

871
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:48,234
[laughter, applause]

872
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,573
"I REALLY THINK YOU'RE SHOWING
A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT.

873
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,009
[laughter, applause]

874
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:02,114
[chanting]
RUDY. RUDY. RUDY."

875
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,950
[laughter, applause]

876
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:06,785
IF YOU GUYS NEVER WATCH PORN,

877
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,354
YOUR SEX LIVES
WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER,

878
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,156
'CAUSE THE BAR WOULD BE
SO MUCH LOWER, RIGHT?

879
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:12,224
IF YOU GUYS
NEVER WATCHED PORN,

880
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,093
YOU'D COME HOME,
YOU'D SEE YOUR GIRL
LYING ON THE BED.

881
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,961
YOU'D BE LIKE, "OH MY GOD.
SHE'S WEARING SWEATPANTS.

882
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:17,596
[laughter]

883
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,998
LOOK AT THAT SNUGGY."

884
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,501
[laughter, applause]

885
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,905
WHY DO I THINK
ALL YOUR PENISES
ARE THIS LONG?

886
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,607
[laughter]

887
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,509
I DON'T LIKE PORN.
WOMEN DO NOT LIKE PORN.

888
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,578
WE'RE WAY TOO SENSITIVE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

889
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,247
LIKE, WHEN I WATCH PORN,
I'M NOT LIKE INTO IT,
AND LIKE, "OH YEAH."

890
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,350
I JUST GET VERY WORRIED
ABOUT THE WOMEN IN THE PORN.

891
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,419
I START SPINNING OUT--
I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

892
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,788
"SHE PROBABLY
DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

893
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:45,157
SHE REALLY NEEDS
A BACKUP PLAN."

894
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,493
[laughter, applause]

895
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:49,995
BUT I THINK WOMEN
SHOULD WATCH PORN MORE,

896
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:52,264
BECAUSE WOMEN--
IF YOU GUYS WATCH PORN, LADIES,

897
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,100
YOU WOULD SEE WHERE YOUR MAN

898
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,867
WAS GETTING ALL THOSE
STUPID FRICKIN' IDEAS.

899
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,669
LIKE, LITERALLY
EVERY TIME I WATCH PORN,

900
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,639
I'M LIKE, "OH, THAT'S WHY
HE MADE ME BUY ROLLER SKATES.

901
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,875
OKAY, THAT'S WHY
THERE'S TWO POUNDS OF PUDDING
IN THE FRIDGE-- OKAY."

902
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,544
[laughter]

903
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,279
BUT WOMEN
ARE TOO SENSITIVE FOR THAT.

904
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,847
LIKE, I DON'T LIKE PORN.
IT'S TOO GRAPHIC.

905
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,549
LIKE, IF PORN
WAS MADE FOR WOMEN,

906
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:14,120
IT WOULD JUST BE, LIKE,
TWO HOURS OF SNUGGLING...

907
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,021
AND AT THE END,
THE GUY WOULD PROPOSE.

908
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,090
[laughter]

909
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,725
I WOULD WATCH THAT.

910
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:22,027
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT.

911
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,695
I DON'T LIKE PORN.

912
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,464
THE THING THAT CRACKS ME UP
THE MOST ABOUT PORN

913
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,032
IS YOU GUYS DON'T THINK
WE KNOW YOU WATCH IT.

914
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,000
IT IS SO OBVIOUS,

915
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,836
ESPECIALLY IF YOU WATCH IT
ON THE COMPUTER,

916
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,939
'CAUSE EITHER, NUMBER ONE,
YOU ERASE YOUR HISTORY...

917
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,474
IN THE MENU BAR--

918
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,409
AND I KNOW
YOU DID SOME CRAZY SHIT--

919
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,877
[laughter]

920
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,512
OR YOU DON'T ERASE
YOUR HISTORY,

921
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,281
AND I TRY TO GO
TO Google.com,

922
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,650
BUT IT GOES TO
GoodJigglyJugs.com...

923
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,385
[laughter]

924
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:49,155
DEAL WITH THAT AT 7:00 A.M.

925
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,457
THE OTHER REASON
WE KNOW YOU GUYS WATCH PORN

926
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,759
IS 'CAUSE YOU GUYS
WILL DO THINGS IN THE BEDROOM

927
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,696
THAT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY,
LIKE, COPYING FROM PORN,

928
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,566
LIKE THE SPANKING THING.

929
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,468
WHEN YOU GUYS DO THIS,

930
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:04,936
WE'RE JUST
FRICKIN' LAUGHING AT YOU,
OKAY? I'M SORRY.

931
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,305
WE'RE LIKE,
"YEAH, I'M A BAD GIRL.

932
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:09,475
- "PFFFT!
- [laughter]

933
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:12,043
- "WHAT AN IDIOT.
- [laughter continues]

934
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:14,012
PLEASE DON'T FART.
PLEASE DON'T FART."

935
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,282
[laughter, applause]

936
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:19,451
[cheers, applause]

937
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,320
THE NEW THING YOU GUYS
ARE DOING IN THE BEDROOM

938
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,988
THAT I KNOW
YOU'RE COPYING FROM PORN

939
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,623
IS THE CHOKING THING.

940
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,057
(woman) OH!

941
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,693
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
WHO'S BEEN CHOKED.

942
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,529
[laughter, cheers, applause]

943
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,565
IT'S LIKE,

944
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,767
I DIDN'T KNOW
THE CHOKING THING WAS GOING ON.

945
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,504
IMAGINE MY SURPRISE...

946
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,606
THE FIRST TIME THAT WENT DOWN,
I WAS LIKE,

947
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:43,475
"UGH. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE PUT THE MONEY."

948
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:46,312
[laughter]

949
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,417
THE FUNNY THING TO ME
ABOUT THE CHOKING THING

950
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,852
IS IT'S THE ONLY FAKE, LIKE,
"I'M GONNA KILL YOU"

951
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,588
THING YOU CAN DO
IN THE BEDROOM
THAT'S ACTUALLY SEXY.

952
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,258
LIKE, YOU CAN'T MIME ANY OTHER
KILLING TACTICS IN THE BEDROOM.

953
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,393
IT'S NOT LIKE

954
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,329
A NAKED GUY CAN COME OUT
OF THE BATHROOM AND BE LIKE...

955
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:06,198
[imitating Jaws theme]
* DA NA

956
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,800
* DA-NA DA-NA
DA-NA DA-NA *

957
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,736
[laughter, applause]

958
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,573
GUYS ARE
INTO THE CHOKING THING.

959
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,542
SO NOW WHEN A GUY TRIES
TO CHOKE ME IN THE BEDROOM,

960
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,143
I'LL JUST GO ALONG WITH IT.
I'LL BE LIKE,

961
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:19,778
"OOH-AH!

962
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,747
[laughter]

963
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,316
"UH-AHH-AHH!

964
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,952
UUUUUAAAAAA..."

965
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,120
YOU GOTTA SELL IT!

966
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,790
[laughter, applause]

967
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,659
I USED TO WORRY ABOUT PORN.

968
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,727
I USED TO BE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
MY MAN'S WATCHING PORN."

969
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,163
YOU KNOW, "HE DOESN'T LOVE ME,
OR HE'S NOT ATTRACTED TO ME."

970
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,031
PORN IS NOT A THREAT
TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS.

971
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,367
I LIKE TO THINK
ABOUT IT LIKE THIS--

972
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:43,435
GUYS WATCHING PORN

973
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,638
IS LIKE WOMEN WATCHING
THE FOOD NETWORK.

974
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,808
'KAY, WE'RE BOTH WATCHING THINGS
WE ARE NEVER GONNA FRIGGIN' DO.

975
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,910
[laughter, applause]

976
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,847
WOMEN HAVE OUR OWN VERSION
OF PORN, RIGHT?

977
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,716
OUR VERSION OF PORN
IS ROMANTIC COMEDIES, RIGHT?

978
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,985
WE COMPARE YOU GUYS TO THE MEN
IN ROMANTIC COMEDIES

979
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,254
JUST LIKE YOU COMPARE US
TO THE WOMEN IN PORN, RIGHT?

980
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,323
YOU GUYS TAKE US OUT
TO A FIVE-STAR RESTAURANT

981
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,024
WITH SHRIMP AND CHAMPAGNE--
IN OUR MINDS WE'RE LIKE,

982
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:07,959
"YEAH, WELL,
MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY
TOOK HIS GIRLFRIEND

983
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,828
"INTO A HOT-AIR BALLOON
AND GOT HER A DIAMOND NECKLACE

984
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,431
AND A PANDA--
THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT!"

985
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,766
ROMANTIC COMEDIES--
THEY BRAINWASH WOMEN.

986
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,369
THEY MAKE US BELIEVE IN, LIKE,
"FATE" AND "DESTINY."

987
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,871
FATE AND DESTINY
ARE NAMES OF STRIPPERS, OKAY?

988
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,707
THEY'RE NOT REAL...

989
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,443
[laughter, applause]

990
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:27,012
IT'S WEIRD, THOUGH,
BECAUSE ROMANTIC COMEDIES

991
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,315
SET THE BAR SO HIGH
FOR YOU GUYS,

992
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,182
BUT WHAT'S WEIRD
IS THAT GUYS ARE THE ONES

993
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:33,319
THAT WRITE
ALL THE ROMANTIC COMEDIES.
GUYS RUN HOLLYWOOD.

994
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,220
IF WOMEN RAN HOLLYWOOD,
THE ROMANTIC COMEDIES WOULD BE

995
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:37,022
A LOT MORE REALISTIC,
SO THERE'D BE

996
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,057
A LOT LESS DISAPPOINTMENT
WHEN YOU LEFT THE THEATER.

997
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,693
NO MORE FRIGGIN' MODELS BEING
CAST AS THE LEAD OF EVERY MOVIE.

998
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,595
LEAD OF EVERY MOVIE
IF WOMEN RAN HOLLYWOOD?

999
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,097
KATHY FREAKIN' BATES, BITCH.

1000
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,199
ANGELINA JOLIE
WOULD NEVER WORK AGAIN.

1001
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,235
I DON'T CARE.
CAMBODIA CAN FUCKING HAVE HER.

1002
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:52,871
- FUCK HER.
- [laughter]

1003
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:56,207
[cheers, applause]

1004
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:59,945
OUR NEW SEXY ACTION STAR--
OPRAH. BAM!

1005
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,714
SHE BLOWS SOME SHIT UP
AND EVERYONE GETS A CAR.

1006
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,516
[laughter]

1007
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,485
- I WOULD SEE THAT MOVIE.
- [laughter continues]

1008
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,387
IT'S FUNNY, THOUGH,
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE

1009
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:10,422
ROMANTIC COMEDIES SET THE BAR
SO HIGH FOR YOU GUYS.

1010
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,424
WE WANT YOU GUYS TO ACT LIKE
THE MEN IN ROMANTIC COMEDIES,

1011
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,192
BUT IF YOU EVER DID ACT LIKE
THE MEN IN ROMANTIC COMEDIES,

1012
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,627
IT WOULD TOTALLY
BACKFIRE, RIGHT?

1013
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,929
LIKE CARRYING A WOMAN
UP THE STAIRS.

1014
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,798
"I'M GONNA CARRY
MY WOMAN UP THE STAIRS AND
SWEEP HER OFF HER FEET."

1015
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,867
IF YOU GUYS TRY TO DO THAT
IN REAL LIFE,

1016
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,036
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
SO MUCH AS FREAKIN' WINCE.

1017
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,305
[laughter]

1018
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:29,975
YOU BETTER GO TO THE GYM.

1019
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,644
YOU MAKE SURE YOU CAN
LIFT HER WEIGHT, BITCHES...

1020
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,112
[laughter]

1021
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,347
'CAUSE IF THERE IS LIKE A...

1022
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:38,417
[grunting]

1023
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,018
YOU ARE SO FUCKED.

1024
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,820
[laughter]

1025
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,390
JUST KILL YOURSELF.
LIKE, IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT.

1026
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,858
"OH, WHAT, I'M FAT?
IS THAT IT, I'M FAT?

1027
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,461
"GEORGE CLOONEY COULD'VE
CARRIED ME UP THE STAIRS.

1028
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,464
"RUBEN STUDDARD COULD'VE
CARRIED ME UP THE STAIRS.

1029
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,366
YOU HAVE A SMALL DICK!"

1030
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:57,569
[laughter, applause]

1031
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,671
ANOTHER THING I FEEL LIKE
GUYS ARE ALWAYS DOING

1032
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,607
IN ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT WOULD
NEVER FLY IN REAL LIFE

1033
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,842
IS GUYS ARE ALWAYS
LIGHTING CANDLES TO BE ROMANTIC.

1034
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:06,244
NO. WOMEN ARE OBSESSED
WITH CANDLES.

1035
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,879
WE'RE LIKE PYROMANIACS, RIGHT?

1036
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,215
YOU GUYS COME OVER.
WE HAVE CANDLES EVERYWHERE.

1037
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:13,685
YOU DON'T KNOW IF
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEX WITH YOU
OR SACRIFICE YOU, RIGHT?

1038
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,754
BUT, GUYS,
YOU CANNOT LIGHT CANDLES.

1039
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,923
IF I GO TO A GUY'S HOUSE
AND HE'S GOT CANDLES EVERYWHERE,

1040
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,559
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE "ROMANTIC."
I THINK YOU TOOK A "DUMP," OKAY?

1041
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,394
[laughter, applause]

1042
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,062
WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

1043
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,197
STOP-- EHH--

1044
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,834
TRYIN' TO "GLADE"
YOUR WAY OUT OF THAT...

1045
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,502
CHIPOTLE-- JUST STOP.

1046
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,337
[laughter, applause]

1047
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:33,839
THE OTHER THING GUYS DO
IN ROMANTIC COMEDIES

1048
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:36,241
THAT WOULD NEVER FLY
IN REAL LIFE

1049
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,977
IS GUYS ARE ALWAYS,
LIKE, SHOWING UP UNANNOUNCED.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1050
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:41,312
LIKE, I WAS WATCHING ONE,
WHERE THIS WOMAN WAS LIKE,
GARDENING OR SOMETHING

1051
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,482
AND THE GUY WAS
LIKE, STANDING THERE,

1052
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,917
AND SHE TURNS AROUND,
SHE'S LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?"

1053
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,853
AND THE GUY WAS LIKE,
"I JUST HAD TO SEE YOU."

1054
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,254
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S 2010.

1055
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,989
YOU CAN SEND
A FUCKING TEXT, OKAY?

1056
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,324
STOP BEING A CREEPY STALKER.
IT'S WEIRD.

1057
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:56,462
SECOND OF ALL, WOMEN, WE DO NOT
LIKE BEING SNUCK UP ON, OKAY?

1058
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,464
I NEED A LOT OF TIME
BEFORE I SEE MY MAN.

1059
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,165
A LOT OF THINGS
NEED TO GO DOWN

1060
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,733
BEFORE I SEE MY MAN.

1061
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,401
I DON'T WANT ANY SURPRISES,
ALL RIGHT?

1062
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:04,970
I GOT TO GET
THE BABY WIPES OUT...

1063
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,038
[laughter]

1064
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,508
[laughter, applause]

1065
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,577
I GOT TO GET
SOME UNDER-EYE CONCEALER

1066
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,244
SO I DON'T LOOK LIKE
AN AVATAR.

1067
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,180
A LOT OF THINGS
HAVE TO GO DOWN, OKAY?

1068
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,015
BUT IT'S SO CRAZY,
'CAUSE WOMEN,

1069
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,250
WE PUT SO MUCH EFFORT
INTO GETTING READY--

1070
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,252
HOURS BEFORE WE LEAVE
THE HOUSE, RIGHT?

1071
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,388
HAIR AND MAKEUP
AND SHAVING AND TWEEZING

1072
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,390
AND PLUCKING AND EYELINER--
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS,

1073
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:27,358
'CAUSE WOMEN ARE
NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT?

1074
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,427
YOU GUYS DON'T NEED ANY MAKEUP.
WOMEN WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

1075
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:31,463
AND ARE
NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL, PERIOD.

1076
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,965
YOU GUYS
ARE FUCKING DISGUSTING...

1077
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,467
[laughter, applause]

1078
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,235
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING.

1079
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,837
YOU JUST ROLL OUT OF BED
WITH THOSE BALLS.

1080
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,906
- HOW DARE YOU?
- [laughter, cheers, applause]

1081
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:44,676
THEY ARE SO AWFUL.
THEY'RE EMBARRASSING.

1082
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,078
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS THREE HOURS
OF MAKEUP, RIGHT THERE--

1083
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,181
- [laughter, applause]
- SOME CONCEALER, YEAH.

1084
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,217
MAYBE A HOT IRON TO...

1085
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,119
IRON OUT THOSE WRINKLES,
PLEASE.

1086
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,655
[laughter, applause]

1087
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:59,024
BUT THE ONE THING
YOU GUYS DO HAVE TO DO--

1088
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,092
LIKE, SHAVE YOUR FACE--
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DO IT.

1089
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,294
IF YOU GUYS DON'T SHAVE,
IT'S SEXY-- IT'S DISTINGUISHED.

1090
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,930
IF WE DON'T SHAVE,
"WE'RE LESBIANS."

1091
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,398
- THAT'S HOW THAT GOES DOWN.
- [laughter]

1092
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,100
WOMEN--
WE TORTURE OURSELVES, RIGHT?

1093
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,702
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT,

1094
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,671
WOMEN ARE WEARING
SO MANY TORTURE DEVICES.

1095
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,806
LIKE, THONG UNDERWEAR--
WHO INVENTED THAT?

1096
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,241
FUCK YOU.

1097
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,043
[women cheering]

1098
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,078
IT IS TERRIBLE.

1099
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:23,314
LIKE, YOU KNOW A WOMAN
DID NOT INVENT THONG UNDERWEAR,

1100
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,316
'CAUSE NO WOMAN
WAS EVER STANDING AROUND

1101
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,452
IN FULL UNDERWEAR
AND WAS LIKE,

1102
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,988
"YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE?

1103
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,489
[laughing]

1104
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,225
"IF ALL OF THIS FABRIC...

1105
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,063
[laughter]

1106
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,998
"WAS JUST...

1107
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:43,501
"LIKE, VIOLENTLY...

1108
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:46,805
"RIDING UP MY ASSHOLE.

1109
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,007
"IS THERE A WAY
YOU CAN GET ALL THIS FABRIC

1110
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,242
"TO JUST TRY
TO RAPE MY BUTT HOLE?

1111
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,644
"IS THAT...?

1112
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,279
[laughter, cheering]

1113
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,814
"I WANT IT JUST TO FEEL LIKE

1114
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:58,750
"A RUBBER BAND
IS SNAPPING...

1115
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,686
"I WANT IT TO FEEL LIKE
AN ALLIGATOR IS ACTUALLY

1116
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:02,387
EATING ME OUT--
CAN YOU DO THAT?"

1117
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,923
[laughter, applause]

1118
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,925
WHAT IS THE POINT
OF THONG UNDERWEAR?

1119
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,628
THE POINT
IS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE
PANTY LINES.

1120
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,697
FOR WHAT? YOU THINK
IN THE HISTORY OF TIME

1121
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,665
ANY GUY
WAS EVER STANDING AROUND,

1122
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,467
LIKE, AT A NIGHTCLUB BAR
WITH HIS BUDDY AND WAS LIKE--

1123
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:19,037
THIS IS MY BUDDY,
BY THE WAY-- UM...

1124
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,272
HE WAS LIKE, "HEY, DUDE,
CHECK OUT THAT GIRL.

1125
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,874
"OH, MY GOD, SHE IS SO HOT.

1126
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,943
"SHE'S SO SEXY.
I'VE GOT TO TALK TO HER.

1127
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,312
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK."

1128
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:30,115
[laughter]

1129
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,683
"DUDE, DUDE...

1130
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,119
"WHAT ARE THOSE LINES?

1131
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,087
[laughter]

1132
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,456
OH, MY GOD, NEVER MIND.
THAT'S DISGUSTING."

1133
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,125
- [laughter]
- IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1134
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,027
AND MOST OF THESE
TORTURE DEVICES MEN INVENTED.

1135
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:43,729
YOU KNOW GUYS INVENTED
HIGH-HEEL SHOES.

1136
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,731
THAT WAS A GUY'S INVENTION,

1137
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,498
WHICH I HAVE A THEORY
ABOUT THIS.

1138
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,400
I HAVE A THEORY
THAT, LIKE, 200 YEARS AGO,

1139
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,803
WOMEN WERE WEARING FLAT SHOES
GETTING WHERE THEY NEEDED TO GO.

1140
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,772
A BUNCH OF GUYS GOT IN A ROOM,
AND THEY WERE LIKE,

1141
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:55,907
"GOD, THESE WOMEN,
THEY ARE GORGEOUS.

1142
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,508
"THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS

1143
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:59,678
"THEY ARE REALLY HARD
TO HAVE SEX WITH.

1144
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,647
"I MEAN,
THEY CAN JUST GET UP

1145
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:03,949
- "AND WALK AWAY.
- [laughter]

1146
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,884
"WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
TO JUST SLOW 'EM DOWN.

1147
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:07,986
"WHAT IF WE JUST PUT,
LIKE, A FOUR-INCH BRICK

1148
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,188
ON THE BACK OF THEIR FOOT?
YOU THINK THEY'D DO THAT?"

1149
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,923
AND IT WORKS,
'CAUSE I'VE TALKED TO GUYS

1150
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:13,925
EXTRA HOURS LONGER
THAN I WANTED TO

1151
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,961
'CAUSE MY FEET
WERE FRICKIN' KILLING ME.

1152
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:17,963
I'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT
WHERE I'M JUST LIKE, "DUDE,

1153
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,231
"CAN I JUST HAVE
THAT ROOFIE NOW,
'CAUSE MY FEET...

1154
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,566
"I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

1155
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,869
PLEASE."

1156
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:26,137
THOSE HEELS-- YOU KNOW THEY
CALL THOSE REALLY HIGH HEELS--

1157
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,674
THEY CALL THEM "FUCK-ME HEELS."
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THEM.

1158
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,375
'CAUSE WHEN YOU PUT 'EM ON,
YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, FUCK ME.

1159
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,810
REALLY?
WE'RE DOING THIS AGAIN?"

1160
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,712
I DON'T LIKE TO WEAR
FUCK-ME HEELS.

1161
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:35,380
I LIKE TO WEAR...

1162
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,916
"LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS"
SNEAKERS.

1163
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:40,886
[laughter, cheers, applause]

1164
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:46,291
GUYS ALSO INVENTED
UNDERWIRE BRAS, WHICH AGAIN,

1165
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,994
ONLY A GUY'S INSENSITIVE MIND
WOULD COME UP WITH THAT.

1166
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:51,129
'CAUSE ONLY A GUY'S MIND
WOULD BE SO INSENSITIVE

1167
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,699
THAT THEY
WOULD SEE A SOFT BRA
WITH A WOMAN'S BOOBS

1168
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,767
AND WAS LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THING NEEDS?

1169
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,970
I THINK THAT NEEDS
A SKEWER RIGHT THROUGH..."

1170
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,272
IT'S NOT A KABOB.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1171
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,008
THIS ISN'T FUCKING FIGHT CLUB.

1172
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,010
WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD?

1173
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,412
AND THEN IN THE '70s
WOMEN STARTED GETTING PISSED OFF

1174
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:08,980
'CAUSE THEY
HURT SO MUCH, RIGHT?

1175
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,716
AND THEN WOMEN
STARTED BURNING THEIR BRAS.

1176
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:13,318
AND THEN GUYS
INVENTED WATER BRAS...

1177
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:15,286
SO WE COULDN'T
BURN 'EM ANYMORE.

1178
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,188
- [laughter]
- THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SMART.

1179
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,157
I GOTTA GIVE YOU
A GOLD STAR FOR THAT.

1180
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,159
AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

1181
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,861
THESE WOMEN-- STILL,
THE BOOBS ARE NOT BIG ENOUGH."

1182
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,529
AND THEN YOU GUYS
INVENTED BREAST IMPLANTS.

1183
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:25,931
WHAT? THE NEXT STEP
WAS CUT 'EM OPEN

1184
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,565
AND FILL THEM WITH JELL-O?

1185
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,434
ARE YOU OUT OF
YOUR FUCKING MIND?

1186
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,002
WOMEN, DO NOT GET
BREAST IMPLANTS.

1187
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:34,305
DO NOT LET
SOCIETY'S IDEAL OF BEAUTY--

1188
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,707
- [cheers, applause]
- YEAH...

1189
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:37,342
MESS WITH YOUR SELF-WORTH.

1190
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:39,911
DO NOT GET-- LOVE YOUR BODY,
FUCK THE MEDIA.

1191
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,480
IT'S ALL PHOTOSHOP.
LOVE YOUR BODY-- YEAH.

1192
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,182
SERIOUS NOTE
FROM WHITNEY CUMMINGS.

1193
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:45,884
- UM...
- [laughter]

1194
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,585
BUT YOU ALSO DON'T
WANNA GET BREAST IMPLANTS,

1195
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,254
'CAUSE IF YOU GET
BREAST IMPLANTS,

1196
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,356
YOU'RE JUST GONNA ATTRACT
THE WRONG KIND OF GUY.

1197
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:53,124
EVERY GUY IN AN ED HARDY SHIRT
IS GONNA WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1198
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:55,460
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
- [laughter, applause]

1199
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,562
EVERY GUY
IN A BLUETOOTH HEADSET

1200
00:44:57,662 --> 00:44:59,597
WITH FLAMES
ON THE SIDE OF HIS CAR,

1201
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,767
STITCHING ON HIS JEANS...

1202
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,269
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
- [laughter, applause]

1203
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:08,673
SEE, I DON'T HAVE ANY BOOBS,

1204
00:45:08,774 --> 00:45:10,842
- AND MY LIFE IS QUIET.
- [laughter]

1205
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:12,710
NO ONE TRIES TO TALK TO ME.

1206
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:14,780
I CAN GO INTO A NIGHTCLUB.
NO ONE HARASSES ME.

1207
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,815
NO ONE EVEN TRIES TO HUG ME.
THIS IS NO FUN.

1208
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,616
NO ONE WANTS TO DO
THE STERNUM BUMP.

1209
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,351
- IT'S NOT FUN.
- [laughter]

1210
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:21,920
I WALK
BY A CONSTRUCTION SITE--

1211
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,689
- SHOOOO...QUIET.
- [laughter]

1212
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,191
EVERY NOW AND THEN
A CONSTRUCTION GUY'LL BE LIKE,

1213
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,827
- "YO, WHAT'S UP, DUDE?"
- [laughter]

1214
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,529
WHICH-- I DON'T GET THAT.
WHAT IS THE YELLING AT WOMEN?

1215
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,231
WHAT IS THE--
YELLING AT STRANGERS?

1216
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,100
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT DOES THAT ACCOMPLISH?

1217
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,902
LIKE, DO YOU THINK
IN THIS HISTORY OF TIME

1218
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:40,238
FIVE DUDES
IN THE BACK OF A TRUCK

1219
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:44,142
YELLING AT A GIRL JOGGING
HAS EVER WORKED?

1220
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,812
DO YOU THINK
IN THE HISTORY OF TIME
ANY GIRL WAS EVER LIKE...

1221
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,847
[breathing heavily]

1222
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:51,049
AND HEARD, "AY-YI-YI-YI,
LET ME SEE THOSE TITTIES!"

1223
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:54,285
[laughter]

1224
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:10,168
LIKE, DO YOU THINK
IN THE HISTORY OF TIME

1225
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,137
ANYONE EVER SAT DOWN
WITH A HAPPILY MARRIED COUPLE

1226
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,572
AND WAS LIKE,
"HEY, SO HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?"

1227
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:16,107
AND THE GIRL'S LIKE,
"WELL, UH,

00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:21,646
"AND THIS TRUCK
FULL OF FIVE DUDES DROVE BY.

1230
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,114

[laughter]

1233
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,719
AND I WAS LIKE,
'HE'S THE ONE.'"

1234
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,922
[laughter, applause]

1235
