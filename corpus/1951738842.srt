1
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,181
[man narrating]
I hate to admit it,

2
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,683
but when I graduated
from college,

3
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,685
I thought I was ready
for anything.

4
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,189
That is until I stepped
off the train in Hangzhou.

5
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,692
Here I was in a country
of a billion people,

6
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,694
and I didn't know
a single one.

7
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:00,203
This place was different
than what I'd expected.

8
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,205
It wasn't at all like what
I'd seen in the Kung Fu movies
[grunting on TV]

9
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,708
No one else I knew stayed up
all night to watch that stuff,

10
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,344
but I was hooked.

11
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,463
[screaming]

12
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,857
The hero was always small
like me,

13
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:23,359
but he moved like the wind,

14
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:26,229
triumphed over evil

15
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,232
and brought the bad guys
to their knees,

16
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,235
and he always
got the girl.

17
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,736
[screams]

18
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,739
[man speaking Chinese on P.A.]

19
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,254
Welcome to China.

20
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,256
Thank you. Thank you.

21
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,758
We are members
of the Foreign Affairs Bureau

22
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,759
of Hangzhou College.

23
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,762
We're responsible for the safety

24
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,265
and convenience of foreigners.

25
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,269
[man narrating]
It was incredible to me

26
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,522
how my whole life seemed
to lead up to this very moment.

27
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,524
Kung Fu lessons as a kid.

28
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,027
Washing dishes after school
in a Chinatown restaurant,

29
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,029
where I learned
to speak Chinese.

30
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,033
Then college, where I majored
in Chinese literature.

31
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,536
I was 11 when Nixon shook hands
with Mao.

32
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,540
By the time I was 22,
China had opened its doors.

33
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,045
In 1982, I grabbed the first
job that would take me there,

34
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,046
as an English teacher.

35
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,548
[camera shutter clicking]

36
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,557
[horn honking]

37
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:20,977
[man] Mr. Mark.

38
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,478
Huh?

39
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:23,980
Mr. Mark!

40
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,984
This is Teacher Hei.

41
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:30,987
Her name means "black."

42
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,989
She has agreed
to be your Chinese teacher

43
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:35,992
because you have learned
classical Chinese before.

44
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,493
Hi.

45
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:41,998
Do you want to talk
about your study schedule now?

46
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,500
He's wet now.

47
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,003
I will come back tomorrow
and bring the books you need.

48
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,505
[Mark] Great. Thank you.

49
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:54,010
It's too cold for you
to walk around like that.

50
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,512
You'll catch pneumonia.

51
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,893
[Mark] I was hoping
to mix with the students

52
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,395
that first day,

53
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,397
but the Foreign Affairs Bureau,

54
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,401
following regulations,
provided a separate table

55
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,904
for their foreign friend.

56
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,419
[murmuring and giggling]

57
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,425
[Mark] The college assigned me
to teach a group

58
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,428
known as the middle aged
English teachers.

59
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,930
Most of them were
originally Russian teachers,

60
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,932
but for political reasons,

61
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,818
they had been told
to forget Russian

62
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:56,322
and learn English.

63
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,825
Hello.

64
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,834
[Mark] I was nervous.
I was very nervous.

65
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,836
Please sit down.

66
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,842
Good afternoon, Mr. Franklin.

67
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,844
Welcome you to China.

68
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,846
We are your English students.

69
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,849
We are sure you will be
a wonderful teacher.

70
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,351
Thank you very much.

71
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,854
But, please...

72
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,360
Call me Mark.

73
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,864
But you are a teacher.

74
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,866
In China,
we respect the teacher

75
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,368
So we must call you "Mr. Franklin."

76
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,870
But I'm young.

77
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,871
Just call me "Mark."

78
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,373
Then we will call
you "Mr. Mark."

79
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,375
Is that okay?

80
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,878
Really,
just Mark will be fine.

81
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,379
Then we call
"Teacher Mark"--

82
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,383
halfway Chinese,
halfway American.

83
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,385
Okay, Teacher Mark.

84
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:03,890
Wonderful. Already we have
solved the contradiction

85
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,392
All right, now that we've
decided what my name is,

86
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,895
why don't you introduce
yourselves to me?

87
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,399
Teacher Du is very fat,

88
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,902
so we call her Fatty Du
in our college.

89
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,404
She has a powerful voice.

90
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,406
Teacher Xu afraid
of me.

91
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,908
I am not.

92
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,409
Oh, but you are.

93
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,411
Teacher Cai
was a wonderful dancer

94
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,414
when he was a young man.

95
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,416
He's famous in our college

96
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,919
because he has
a very beautiful wife.

97
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,921
She's from the countryside

98
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:39,425
and has never seen
a foreigner before

99
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,428
but she'll get used to you,
Teacher Mark.

100
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,930
What's your name?

101
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,433
She's called Xiao Chun.

102
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,936
Her name means springtime.

103
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,438
Like the American name April.

104
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,440
April.

105
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,443
Yes.

106
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,947
Teacher Mark, can you also
give me an English name?

107
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,950
Let's see. Tell me something
about yourself.

108
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,452
I want to be
in the Navy.

109
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,962
"Sinbad"--
what does it mean?

110
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,964
Well, it really doesn't
mean anything,

111
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,966
but it's the name
of a very famous sailor.

112
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,469
Teacher Mark,
tell us something about you.

113
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,472
My hobby
is Chinese Kung Fu.

114
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,476
I think I've seen
every Kung Fu movie ever made.

115
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,993
I never saw that before.

116
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,119
Teacher Mark. Teacher Mark!

117
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,120
Teacher Mark!

118
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,123
[knocking on door]
[woman]
He's sleeping.

119
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,125
[Mark] I told my students
to come see me any time,

120
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,127
so I was afraid Sinbad
had decided

121
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,631
to practice more English
at 5 in the morning,

122
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,635
but he said this is good.

123
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:33,289
[Mark] Who knows
what Sinbad had to do

124
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,291
to get me through those gates.

125
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,294
But somehow there we were,

126
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:41,297
in the Hangzhou Martial Arts
School, and there he was,

127
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:44,300
Pan Qingfu,
one of the most famous masters

128
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,303
in all of China,
a national champion.

129
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:51,307
He'd even played a villain
in Shaolin Temple,

130
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:55,311
my all-time favorite
Kung Fu movie.

131
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,413
I'd read that he was
as hard as his right hand,

132
00:09:57,813 --> 00:09:59,315
which he developed

133
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:02,318
by punching an iron plate
a thousand times a day.

134
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:05,321
They called him
the Iron Fist.

135
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,896
[speaks Chinese]

136
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:00,436
[Mark] I grew up
calling Martial Arts Kung Fu,

137
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,938
but the word really means
more than that.

138
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:05,941
It's an attitude to be applied
to everything one does.

139
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,945
[Mark] To have Kung Fu
means to do something

140
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,448
with skill that transcends
surface beauty.

141
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,951
What would it be like
to achieve that,

142
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,454
to have a teacher
who could lead you

143
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:20,456
to that kind of mastery?

144
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:23,459
[sound of
metal clanging together]

145
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:06,502
[Mark] His eyes seemed
to see right through me,

146
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:09,505
a soft American
who'd always had it easy

147
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:13,509
I wasn't sure what Teacher Pan
meant by "eating bitter",

148
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,011
but coming from a man
called Iron Fist,

149
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:19,014
it didn't sound promising.

150
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:22,017
I learned these characters

151
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:24,019
Want to see them?

152
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:27,523
In China,

153
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,525
when someone visits you
in your home,

154
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:34,530
you always offer them
tea and something to eat first.

155
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,033
Sorry. Sorry.

156
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:53,048
Here we go.

157
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:03,559
Oh, no. I've already eaten.
Thank you.

158
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,561
But you just said
you wanted something.

159
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,562
I did not.

160
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,064
I said, "You should offer
me something."

161
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:12,067
That is the Chinese way.

162
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:16,071
No, no, no.
That's wrong.

163
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:18,073
You should give it
to me anyway.

164
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:20,576
But you said
you didn't want anything.

165
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:24,697
I said that because that
is being polite.

166
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,700
You must still offer me
the candy.

167
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,704
Okay.

168
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,210
Now let's see
these characters.

169
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,730
I thought you said
you've learned them.

170
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,232
I did.

171
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,736
You must know them
by heart.

172
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,739
Next time,
no using the book.

173
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,256
You must master
each stroke

174
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,258
before you can go on.

175
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,762
Otherwise, everything
you do will be so-so.

176
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,764
Tell me about it.

177
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,266
Everything I touch
turns to so-so.

178
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,769
You're too impatient.

179
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,278
I'll come back
next week.

180
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,782
In the meantime,
memorize these characters.

181
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,284
Okay.

182
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,791
Thanks, Teacher Hei.
I'll see you next week.

183
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,294
Haven't you heard
the expression "suon ke" before?

184
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,796
To send a guest?

185
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,297
Yes.

186
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,301
You always walk your guest
part of the way home.

187
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,303
[Mark] With Teacher Hei,

188
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,305
I was never sure
when the lesson was over,

189
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,808
only that she seemed so
determined to straighten me out

190
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,310
that it would be useless
to resist.

191
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,312
Oh, no.
You're too polite.

192
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,815
You don't have to walk me so far

193
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,818
No, it's no trouble.

194
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,320
It's my pleasure.

195
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,823
Good.
You're catching on.

196
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,828
[singing]

197
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,349
No, I come here
for English books.

198
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,351
Your English is good.

199
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,353
Did you learn it in China?

200
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,357
Yes, of course.
Where else?

201
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,360
My hobby is reading
English novels.

202
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,875
Who's your favorite author?

203
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,378
John Steinbeck.

204
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,881
Yeah, he's a great writer.

205
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,884
How did you end up
learning English?

206
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,385
During medical school,

207
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,388
I studied English
in my spare time.

208
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,890
You're a doctor.

209
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,392
Kind of.

210
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,894
I work in a clinic.

211
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,896
In a culture revolution,

212
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,898
I was sent down
to the countryside,

213
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,400
and I raised pigs.

214
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,904
Two years wasted.

215
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,405
So after that,

216
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,908
I decided to make up for it.

217
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,910
What are you doing here?

218
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,411
I teach English here.

219
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,915
I wanted to come to China
since I was 12 years old.

220
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,918
More people speak Chinese
than any language in the world,

221
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,420
which I'm sure you know,

222
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,924
but I just kept thinking
how great it would be

223
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,927
to be able to talk
to a quarter of mankind,

224
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,931
one or two at a time, of course.

225
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,934
I think a lot of Americans
hope they'll find something

226
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,936
in China
they can't find at home.

227
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,939
And that was my idea
anyway.

228
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,943
Do you live nearby?

229
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,444
No, I live far away.

230
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,949
I have to catch the bus
before it's too late.

231
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,951
I'll walk you
to the bus stop.

232
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,452
It's on my way home.

233
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,454
No, you can't do that.

234
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,956
Good-bye.

235
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,457
See you later.

236
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,971
Hey.

237
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,973
What are you doing Sunday?

238
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,977
I'm going to the free market.

239
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,979
What's a free market?

240
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,981
Come and see.

241
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,516
I didn't know
you did Tai Chi.

242
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,018
This is just my hobby.

243
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,520
We have a saying here --

244
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,523
that a scholar should be
familiar with the literary

245
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,527
and the martial.
It makes for a good balance.

246
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,529
Could you teach me
that routine?

247
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,031
I'm not good enough.

248
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,033
If you want
to learn something,

249
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,036
you should always find
the best teacher.

250
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,040
There is a very famous Wushu
teacher here, Teacher Pan.

251
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,542
Yeah, I've met him.

252
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,544
I even asked him
to teach me.

253
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,046
You know what he said?

254
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,300
That's what I get for having
blue eyes and a big nose.

255
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,188
Do I look ugly to you?

256
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:28,193
No, not ugly.

257
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:33,198
Your face is very...

258
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,701
three-dimensional.

259
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,204
Be persistent.

260
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,207
I think you can convince him.

261
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,843
[bell rings]

262
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,908
[grunting]

263
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,976
[laughing]

264
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,527
[Mark] I wondered
what Teacher Pan

265
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,529
would show me first.

266
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,030
I'd always loved
the double saber

267
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,532
in Five Fingers of Death

268
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,034
and the nine section whip
in Shaolin Temple.

269
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:17,038
And how about those moves
Bruce Lee did in Fists of Fury?

270
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,543
[Mark] But this was better
than any movie.

271
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,545
This was for real.

272
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,914
[Mark] So that was it.

273
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,916
My first lesson.

274
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:29,921
No whips, no sabers,
just staring.

275
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,924
[rock and roll music playing
on radio]

276
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,444
[music stops]

277
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,946
How much?

278
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,449
About $100, U.S.

279
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,453
Too much.

280
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,353
[speaking indistinctly]

281
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:23,358
These are dumplings.

282
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:32,867
Thank you.

283
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,869
Yeah.

284
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,372
I'd give anything

285
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:39,374
for a hot fudge sundae
right now.

286
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:41,876
Sunday?
This is Sunday.

287
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,878
[Mark] We talked
about everything.

288
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:46,381
I don't remember
what we said.

289
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:49,384
I just remember her eyes,
her face,

290
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:52,887
the sound of her voice.

291
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:56,891
Okay, last week I asked you
to write a short essay--

292
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,894
"My happiest moment."

293
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:02,397
Let's start.

294
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:05,400
How about Teacher Zhang?

295
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,404
I'm a sad person.

296
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:12,407
I cannot remember
happy moment.

297
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,919
"I was assigned to teach here
in Hangzhou,

298
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,422
"far from home.

299
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,924
"I tried
to convince the leaders

300
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,427
"to let me stay
with my family,

301
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:34,429
"but it was impossible.

302
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:38,433
"I must go
where the Party sends me.

303
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:41,436
"Several years ago
my college gave me permission

304
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:42,937
"to visit my family.

305
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:47,058
"When the train arrived
in my hometown.

306
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,564
"My whole family was
at the station to meet me.

307
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,066
"I had so much
to tell them,

308
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,569
"but when I saw them,

309
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,071
"no words came out
of my mouth.

310
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,074
"I only stood there.

311
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:08,580
"Tears fell out
of my eyes like rain."

312
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,583
That was a beautiful essay.

313
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,086
Thank you.

314
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,089
Teacher Cai.

315
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,598
"My happiest moment --

316
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,600
"when I was a young man,

317
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,102
"I attended a dance at night.

318
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,605
"The music was being played,

319
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,608
"and the stars shone brightly.

320
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,610
"I saw a girl standing.

321
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,613
"I wanted to ask her
to dance,

322
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,616
"but as I'm a shy man,

323
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,618
"I did not dare.

324
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,119
"Then, I did.

325
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,122
"And we danced,

326
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,124
"my cheek touching hers.

327
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,126
"The room disappeared.

"The other people disappeared,

"and I could only see
the stars dancing.

00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,636
"After that,

331
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,639
"I did not see her
ever again.

332
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,642
"I wonder where she is."

333
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,146
Teacher Cai, have you shown
this essay to your wife?

334
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,651
Yes, but it doesn't matter.

335
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:24,155
She cannot read English.

336
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,658
Teacher Xu.

337
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:32,163
My story's very common

338
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,165
'cause I'm a common man.

339
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,669
Last winter
I traveled to Peking.

340
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,173
My relatives there invited me
to a restaurant

341
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,176
famous for its Peking Duck.

342
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:50,181
First, we ate cold dishes,

343
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,684
such as marinated pig stomach

344
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,687
and sea slugs.

345
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,689
Then at last,
the duck arrived.

346
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:02,694
The skin was brown
and crisp and shiny.

347
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:07,198
In my mouth,
it was like clouds disappearing.

348
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,203
[Teacher Xu] I must confess
something, Teacher Mark.

349
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,705
What's that?

350
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,709
This story's true,

351
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,211
but actually,
I've never been to Peking.

352
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:25,717
My wife went to Peking
and had this duck.

353
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:30,722
And she often tells me
about it again, again.

354
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,225
I think even though
I was not there,

355
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,728
it is my happiest moment.

356
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,234
[Mark] I had wanted
to start the class off

357
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,736
with something simple,

358
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,739
but I was learning that nothing
in China was simple,

359
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,743
especially something
like happiness.

360
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,748
[horn honks]

361
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,755
Hey, Ming.

362
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,262
What happened?

363
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,767
Oh, I got a perm?
How do you think?

364
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,770
Well,
it's really curly.

365
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,775
My parents hate it.

366
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,777
Yeah, well, that's parents
for you. What do they know?

367
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,280
I don't know
if I like it now.

368
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,542
[Ming]
Do you know this poem?

369
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,047
[Ming] Whose words these are,

370
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,051
I think I know.

371
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,554
His house is
in the village, though.

372
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:53,558
He will not see me stopping
here to watch his woods

373
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:57,061
fill up with snow.

374
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,063
[Mark] Ming.
You wrote her name

375
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,066
by combining the characters
for the sun and the moon.

376
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,068
It meant brilliance
and enlightenment.

377
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:06,821
She was passionate
about literature.

378
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:09,824
She knew more English poetry
than I did.

379
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:12,827
She always said
what was on her mind.

380
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:15,830
It was as if
she had no time to lose.

381
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,402
[playing a medium-tempo tune]

382
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,422
Teacher Mark!
Teacher Mark!

383
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:49,924
Sinbad.

384
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:01,435
Sinbad,
what are you doing?

385
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:03,938
Come visit my family.

386
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:16,951
[baby cries]

387
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,132
[birds squawking]

388
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:41,535
[Sinbad] Hey, hey!

389
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:54,548
[Mark] It was the first time
anyone had invited me

390
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:58,052
to their home,
much less on a boat.

391
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:00,554
I was touched
by their generosity,

392
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:02,556
but it wasn’t until
what happened to me later

393
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,558
that I realized
the risk they took.

394
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,560
[playing medium-tempo tune]

395
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,562
[speaking Chinese]

396
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:10,564
[baby crying]

397
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:51,605
Why did you stop?

398
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,608
Do they want me
to play?

399
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:04,118
This is the way we enjoy music.

400
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:27,641
Sinbad, what are the two things

401
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,643
you think about most?

402
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:35,649
Eating and sleeping.

403
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:39,653
Come on. That can't be true.

404
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:42,656
It's true.

405
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:45,659
Our dormitory has terrible food,

406
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:48,662
and it is always noisy at night.

407
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:54,668
What about you?

408
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:57,171
What are your two things?

409
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:02,676
Well, I want
to be good at something,

410
00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:04,678
like Teacher Pan.

411
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:08,182
The other thing is

412
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:10,184
I want people to like me,

413
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:14,188
especially girls.
You know what I mean?

414
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:17,691
But these things
are so easy.

415
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:21,695
All you have to do
is work hard

416
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:25,199
and be nice,

417
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,202
but eating and sleeping,

418
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:30,204
that's difficult

419
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:35,709
because we cannot control
these things.

420
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:37,711
You see?

421
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,468
I met some fishermen.

422
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,471
They invited me to live
with them on their boat.

423
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,974
You crazy boy.

424
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:54,979
How can you teach
if you live on a boat?

425
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,480
Did you do these?

426
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,984
No, my husband did.

427
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,487
He like to paint in ink,

428
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,490
but during the cultural
revolution,

429
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,993
he was put in prison

430
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,496
because these paintings are black.

431
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,001
I was sent
to a different camp

432
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,003
and couldn't see him,

433
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,005
but he wrote me letters.

434
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:25,509
After awhile, he stopped writing

435
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:30,014
They said he died of illness.

436
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:34,385
You're not wearing enough.

437
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,887
There's no heat in here.

438
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,391
Don't your parents
teach you how to keep warm?

439
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,893
I'm a big boy now.

440
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,897
How can you think
you understand everything?

441
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,401
You're so young,
so far away from home.

442
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,902
I'm your teacher.

443
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:56,407
If I don't care for you,
won't you be lonely?

444
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,293
[medium-tempo Chinese tune
playing]

445
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:06,300
[cymbals crashing]

446
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:15,309
[woman singing]

447
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:19,813
Can you understand
the words?

448
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:22,816
No, but it's fantastic anyway.

449
00:43:29,823 --> 00:43:33,827
The lady in white
is really a snake spirit.

450
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,332
She falls in love
with a human,

451
00:43:38,332 --> 00:43:39,833
but he abandons her.

452
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,340
[Ming]
Her attendant in green

453
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,842
wants to kill him.

454
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:53,347
[singing continues]

455
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,966
But the white snake
loves him so much

456
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,468
she's protecting him.

457
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,470
Doesn't he love her, too?

458
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,974
Yes, but she's a spirit.

459
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,976
So they can never
be together.

460
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,624
[speaking indistinctly]

461
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:27,131
But I like the last move
that she does.

462
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,144
We have to be very careful.

463
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,146
What if someone sees us?

464
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,149
So? That's our business.

465
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:50,654
In China, it's everybody's business.

466
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,658
I've already been criticized
for liking Western things.

467
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,161
What's wrong with Western things?

468
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:00,280
I thought that was
all right in China now.

469
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,784
It's not as free as it seems.

470
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,789
I live in a very different
world from yours.

471
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,796
But our worlds are getting closer.

472
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,298
Don't you think?

473
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,303
No. I can't.

474
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,306
I just can't do what I want,

475
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,809
like you.

476
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,062
[all]
Together we shall practice...

477
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,065
[speaking indistinctly]

478
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,568
Right. April,

479
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,071
why did the peasant
go to the factory?

480
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:47,578
He said together we shall
practice.

481
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,580
[Mark] No, why did the --

482
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,083
This book is really boring.

483
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,586
[speaks Chinese]

484
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,588
Let's do free talk.

485
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,591
Talk about anything you want.

486
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:05,095
Teacher Mark, I saw
the movieTess last week.

487
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,597
Did you like it?

488
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:11,101
No, I didn't enjoy it much

489
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,103
because of the stars
not beautiful.

490
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,606
You can't be serious.
Nastassja Kinski?

491
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,107
She's gorgeous.

492
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,610
Her lips are too big.

493
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,113
They're not too big.
They're full.

494
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,115
Then they're too full.

495
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,117
A woman's lips should be like a bug,

496
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,621
small and delicate.

497
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,623
Westerners think that
full lips are very good.

498
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,626
Good for what?

499
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,127
For kissing.

500
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,129
[all] Oh!

501
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,632
[Fatty Du]
Naughty boy!

502
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,134
What's the matter?
Don't people kiss here?

503
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,636
Of course not.

504
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,639
Here in China, it's quite
different from your country.

505
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,642
People don't kiss here.

506
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,645
[bell rings]

507
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,159
Teacher Mark,

508
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,161
you are honest my teacher,

509
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,665
so I must be an honest,
your student.

510
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,669
As to kissing,

511
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,170
this is not always true.

512
00:47:20,554 --> 00:47:22,055
I have two daughters.

513
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:25,559
One is 12. One is 10.

514
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,561
I cannot kiss them

515
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:30,063
because they would feel
embarrassment

516
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:33,066
and call me foolish.

517
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:35,569
But every night
after they are asleep,

518
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:39,573
I kiss them good night,
very quiet, very soft,

519
00:47:40,073 --> 00:47:41,575
and they don't know.

520
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,449
[Mark] The students
rarely revealed themselves

521
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,952
in front of others,
but they sought me out alone

522
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,454
to tell me
what they really thought.

523
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,457
I was teaching them
the rules of grammar,

524
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:02,462
but they were teaching me
about their lives.

525
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,480
[grunts]

526
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:55,015
[Mark] I was practicing
all sorts of fancy moves.

527
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,516
It felt great!

528
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:00,020
I could almost hear the theme
music from Rocky playing

529
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,022
in the background,
but as soon as I thought

530
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,523
I was looking good,

531
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,525
Teacher Pan said that I was
just waving my arms around

532
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,527
and jumping up and down.

533
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,529
"You should look
like a mad tiger

534
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,531
"crashing down a mountain",
he growled.

535
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,534
"Do every movement
as if it were your last."

536
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,040

537
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,147
"Don't worry,

00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,649
"it's just a broken arm."

"Don't worry,

00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,662
"it's just a broken arm."

"Don't worry,

542
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:30,170
"it'’’s just a broken arm."

543
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:47,070
Where were you, Ming?
I waited all day.

544
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,573
It's been very busy at work.

545
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,575
Is something wrong?

546
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:55,078
The night we stayed out,

547
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,080
they needed me at the clinic.

548
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,584
My supervisor was very angry.

549
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,085
I'm sorry.

550
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:05,088
It's not your fault.

551
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,094
Who are you reading?

552
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:15,098
Oh, Jack London.

553
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,601
You know, I got into a lot
of trouble

554
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:20,103
because of these books.

555
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:23,106
I went to a medical school
to become a doctor,

556
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,108
but the leaders
of my college thought

557
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:28,612
I spent too much time
reading English novels.

558
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:33,617
They criticized me
for worshipping Western things.

559
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:42,125
So they punished me
by making me a counselor

560
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,127
in a family planning clinic.

561
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,133
What is this?

562
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,636
It's a collection
of American short stories.

563
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,638
I just got it.

564
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,139
For me?

565
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,141
For you.

566
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,144
Thank you.

567
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,146
Wait.

568
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,158
[clears throat]

569
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,163
What are doing?

570
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,166
Building up a friendship
between our two countries.

571
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,669
What would happen
if anyone saw you?

572
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,671
Well, you saw me.

573
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,173
What's the hell's wrong anyway?

574
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,676
Why is it so bad that
I want to get to know her?

575
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,679
Don't be a fool.
It's not bad for you,

576
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,181
but it's bad for her.

577
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,685
Ten years ago in this country,

578
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,187
she could have been kill
ed because of knowing you.

579
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,189
Don't you know that?

580
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,191
But that was ten years ago.

581
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,193
What does that have to do
with now?

582
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:54,698
My brother was killed
in Korea by Americans.

583
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,701
I know you had nothing
to do with it,

584
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:01,705
but not everybody here
feels the same way.

585
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:05,709
What will happen to her
when you leave China?

586
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:09,212
You've given us a very good
impression of your country.

587
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:12,215
Don't spoil it.

588
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,721
The political situation is changing.

589
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,724
You must be very careful.

590
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,410
[Mark's voice]
The student obeys the teacher.

591
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,911
Student.

592
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,914
The teacher cultivates
the student.

593
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,417
Teacher.

594
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,805
[Mark] We couldn't stop now,

595
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,807
but I couldn't even get
a message to him.

596
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,309
I was afraid he'd think
I decided not to come anymore

597
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,311
and that he was right
about me,

598
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,815
that I couldn't eat bitter.

599
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,689
[door opens]

600
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,207
What are you doing here?

601
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,209
I have to talk to you
about something.

602
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,211
What happened to your hair?

603
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,712
My father cut it.

604
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,713
Why?

605
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,216
Because he knows you cut it.

606
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,218
He doesn't want me
to get in trouble.

607
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,721
I cannot see you anymore.

608
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,724
Don't do this, Ming.

609
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,727
Don't you see? You're a foreigner.

610
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,231
When your job is over,
you will leave China.

611
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,234
You yourself said
you could never stay here,

612
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,736
and I cannot leave.

613
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:50,740
My family needs me.

614
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,822
Teacher Mark!
Teacher Mark!

615
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:16,826
Mr. Sung wants to see you
in the Foreign Affairs Office

616
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,329
right now.

617
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,337
What is it now?

618
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,340
What is this of your
tearing down the school?

619
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,343
It was an accident.
I bumped into the wall.

620
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,346
I warned you.
Now I must tell you --

621
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,849
according to the Chinese regulations,

622
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,353
a foreigner who destroys property

623
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,856
will be punished by the Chinese law.

624
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,867
Understand?

625
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:01,871
You should be using
the past tense by now.

626
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:06,876
Teacher Ju, can you explain
this picture for me?

627
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,879
Yes, that's a picture
of an atom bomb, isn't it?

628
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,382
[Mark] Yes.

629
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,884
Teacher Mark,
how you feeling

630
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,886
when you know that your country
dropped an atom bomb

631
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,389
on innocent people?

632
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,892
We say, "How do you feel knowing?"

633
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,894
Not "how are you feeling?"

634
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,397
How do you feel?

635
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,399
In America, not everyone thinks

636
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,401
it was the right thing to do,

637
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,904
but most people think it saved lives.

638
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,908
How did it save lives?

639
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,911
Well, by ending the war
more quickly.

640
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,414
But, Teacher Mark,

641
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:48,418
it is a fact that the Japanese
had already surrendered

642
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,421
to the Communist Army in China.

643
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,423
America put a bomb in Japan in order

644
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,425
to make the world think
that America was the...

645
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,426
The victor.

646
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,928
Oh, yes, the victor.

647
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:03,433
Teacher Ju, how do
you know this is a fact?

648
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,435
That's what our newspapers say.

649
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,437
But our newspapers
tell a different story,

650
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:08,938
you see?

651
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,443
How do we know which newspaper
has told the truth?

652
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,944
This is easy.

653
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,447
Our newspapers are controlled
by the people,

654
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,449
but your newspapers

655
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,452
are owned by capitalists to make money.

656
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,955
So of course,
they make things up.

657
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,957
Don't you think so?

658
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:34,964
It doesn't matter.

659
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,966
Any capitalist country would do that.

660
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,971
It is not just your country.

661
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:45,108
[Mark] Being in China
was like playing a game

662
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,110
where the rules kept changing.

663
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,113
China needed foreigners like me
to come teach English,

664
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:53,116
but the officials would have
preferred to tie me to my desk

665
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:56,119
between classes rather than
risk letting me loose

666
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,121
to spread bourgeois ideas.

667
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:01,624
First, Ming was off-limits to me,

668
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:05,128
and now teacher Pan,
whose martial arts skills

669
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,630
were suddenly considered
national defense secrets.

670
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,632
After almost a year in China,

671
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,634
Teacher Hei was the only one left

672
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,636
who could still talk to me.

673
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,139
If you like,
you can practice with me.

674
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:20,143
I'll try to help you if I can.

675
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:27,150
Come on.
You can learn some Tai Chi.

676
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,653
Tai Chi is based on yin and yang,

677
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,156
the theory of opposites.

678
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:36,159
When you tap me here,

679
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,163
on this side,

680
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:43,666
I push you on exactly
the opposite side.

681
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:47,670
Here. Give it a try.

682
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,687
What's the matter?

683
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,690
I give up.

684
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,692
You've only started.

685
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,195
No, no, it's not this.

686
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,697
It's this whole foreigner thing.

687
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,700
I can't deal with this anymore.

688
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,702
I don't want
to be a foreign devil,

689
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,705
big nose...
[speaks Chinese]

690
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,707
I didn't come here for that.

691
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:26,709
I'm just a person, like them.

692
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:32,215
Mark, come with me.

693
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:02,745
You know, the Buddha
was an Indian prince.

694
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:04,747
He was a foreigner,

695
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:07,750
but we made Buddhism our own.

696
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,257
You are a foreigner.

697
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:15,758
It's true,

698
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,261
but you can make
Wushu your own.

699
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:52,545
Sue me. Sue me.

700
01:04:32,585 --> 01:04:34,587
[Mark] Suddenly, I had
a real Chinese problem,

701
01:04:35,087 --> 01:04:38,090
and I was going to need
a Chinese solution.

702
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,092
I found a warehouse on campus

703
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:42,094
where the Foreign Affairs people

704
01:04:42,094 --> 01:04:44,096
would never think to look for us.

705
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:46,098
One of the art students
loaned me the key

706
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:48,100
in exchange
for my shortwave radio,

707
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,604
so he and his friends could
listen to the Voice of America.

708
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:31,644
[Mark] At first,
it was so hard

709
01:05:31,644 --> 01:05:34,146
to get him to teach me,
and I couldn't understand why.

710
01:05:34,146 --> 01:05:36,148
Now he was defying the authorities

711
01:05:36,649 --> 01:05:38,651
to teach me a weapon
he'd never taught anyone else,

712
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:43,155
and I still couldn't understand.

713
01:05:43,656 --> 01:05:46,158
Why did this mean so much to him?

714
01:06:22,695 --> 01:06:25,698
I like martial arts

715
01:06:26,198 --> 01:06:28,701
very much.

716
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:31,203
Don't worry.

717
01:06:31,203 --> 01:06:36,709
It's just a shoulder dislocation.

718
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:39,712
May I introduce myself?

719
01:06:39,712 --> 01:06:43,215
My name's Pan Qingfu.

720
01:06:43,716 --> 01:06:45,217
Pan is the surname.

721
01:06:45,718 --> 01:06:48,220
Qingfu is the first name.

722
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,722
Do you understand?

723
01:06:50,222 --> 01:06:51,223
Yeah.

724
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,854
[Mark] Since teacher Pan
had no phone,

725
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,356
I just had to wait
for him to show up.

726
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,358
Sometimes he'd disappear
for weeks at a time,

727
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,860
and I'd go crazy,

728
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,864
thinking maybe he'd decided
I wasn't worth teaching.

729
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,116
Then all of a sudden, he'd find
a way to appear again,

730
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,617
teach me something new

731
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:21,120
and insist that it'd
be perfect the next time.

732
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:23,566
[Mark] When Teacher Pan
said that about losing face,

733
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,068
I realized the extent
of my responsibility to him,

734
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:29,572
and it was scary,
but also wonderful,

735
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:32,575
because I began
to feel it wasn't just me

736
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,076
pushing myself anymore,

737
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:38,581
but also him
pulling me along from inside.

738
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,675
I don't understand.

739
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:23,178
In China, some teacher
s are old-fashioned.

740
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,181
If you study with other teachers

741
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:28,183
without asking their permission,

742
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:29,685
they think you don't respect them.

743
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:34,690
Would it help
if you talked to him for me?

744
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:40,195
Whoever ties a knot has to untie it.

745
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:43,198
You should talk to him yourself.

746
01:11:50,956 --> 01:11:52,958
[Mark] After months
of working out

747
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:54,960
and trying so hard,

748
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,963
I'd managed to offend the one man

749
01:11:57,963 --> 01:11:59,965
I wanted to please the most.

750
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:01,967
How could I get a man who said
he never made mistakes

751
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:03,969
to change his mind about me?

752
01:12:03,969 --> 01:12:06,972
How could I change his iron mind?

753
01:15:51,697 --> 01:15:53,699
[Mark] I couldn't believe

754
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:56,201
that it was all going
to end like this,

755
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:58,203
but I did do one thing right.

756
01:15:58,203 --> 01:16:00,205
The students' English improved.

757
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:02,708
I even taught them a few songs.

758
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,710
There were always getting them
mixed up, though.

759
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:07,212
On my birthday,
they sang Silent Night.

760
01:16:07,212 --> 01:16:08,714
Teacher Mark!
Teacher Mark!

761
01:16:08,714 --> 01:16:11,216
Someone important wants
to see you.

762
01:16:11,216 --> 01:16:13,218
I'm busy packing.
Why don't you give me a hand?

763
01:16:13,218 --> 01:16:16,722
I can help you later. Come.

764
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:23,362

# A sleighing song tonight

[continue singing in Chinese ]

774
01:16:53,892 --> 01:16:55,894
[Mark] What's this?

775
01:16:55,894 --> 01:16:59,898
We fixed you your favorite
ice cream sundae.

776
01:16:59,898 --> 01:17:01,900
Doctor Wang brought the ice cream.

777
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,903
Teacher Shi made the sesame sauce.

778
01:17:05,404 --> 01:17:07,906
And I chopped the peanuts.

779
01:17:07,906 --> 01:17:11,410
Oh, that's so nice.
I'd better try it.

780
01:17:19,418 --> 01:17:22,921
Delicious.

781
01:17:22,921 --> 01:17:25,424
The best I ever had.

[slow-tempo tune playing

784
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,973
I can't believe you're here.

785
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,504
I had to see you one more time.

786
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:50,008
I have to go now.

787
01:18:50,008 --> 01:18:52,010
Bye.

788
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:44,563
Get on.

789
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:47,566
Come on, Ming, live a little. Get on.

790
01:20:08,086 --> 01:20:11,089
[horns honking]

791
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:39,734
What will you do, Ming?

792
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,237
I will read in my room and dream.

793
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:45,740
In my imagination, I'm free,

794
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,743
and I can do wonderful things.

795
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:59,754
I'm gonna miss you, you know?

796
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:01,256
Really?

797
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:04,259
Yeah.

798
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,760
You're different.

799
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,265
Your lectures
make everyone laugh.

800
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:13,268
You should always stay that way.

801
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:16,271
You're the one that's special.

802
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:20,275
You must know I love you.

803
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,779
I have to get back now.

804
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,793
At the bottom, I will get off.

805
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:40,795
So I will say good-bye now.

806
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:42,797
I'll take you all the way home.

807
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:46,301
No, at the end of the bridge,
I will get off.

808
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:49,304
I won't see you again,

809
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:52,307
so be good.

810
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:03,318
Now go as fast as you can.

811
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:57,392
Take that sword

812
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:01,896
back to America

813
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:05,900
and teach good students.

814
01:25:33,678 --> 01:25:36,181
[Woman speaking Chinese
over loudspeaker]

815
01:25:36,181 --> 01:25:37,682
You didn't have to come
all the way to the station.

816
01:25:37,682 --> 01:25:39,184
You're leaving China.

817
01:25:39,184 --> 01:25:42,187
I had to walk you part
of the way home.

818
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:45,190
You still don't wear enough.

819
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:48,193
I knitted this for you.

820
01:26:33,738 --> 01:26:35,240
Show him.

01:26:53,758 --> 01:26:55,260
[ripping sound]

822

[laughing]

823
01:26:58,263 --> 01:26:59,264
Ow!

824
01:27:23,922 --> 01:27:26,925
[Mark] I tried to memorize
exactly how Teacher Hei looked

825
01:27:26,925 --> 01:27:28,927
at that moment.

826
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:34,549
[Mark] I thought of Sinbad,
Teacher Pan

827
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:37,552
and Ming.

828
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:40,054
I couldn't concentrate
on the book I was reading.

829
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:43,057
It was America that suddenly
felt like some exotic dream,

830
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:46,561
and China that was real to me.

831
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:51,065
There was a saying that
it's the height of stupidity

832
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:54,068
to look for the donkey
that you're already riding on.

833
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:56,571
I had come halfway
around the world

834
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:59,574
looking for places that existed
mostly in my mind.

835
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:02,577
And while I didn't find
what I'd expected,

836
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:07,582
I did find that I was riding
on that donkey all along,

837
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:11,586
and that eating bitter
lets you taste sweet.
