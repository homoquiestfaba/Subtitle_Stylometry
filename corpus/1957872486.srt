1
00:00:01,349 --> 00:00:04,016
(intense music)

2
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:17,818
(upbeat music)

3
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:08,175
- Are you alone right now?

4
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:12,289
Are you currently between relationships?

5
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,891
Have you sunk to the point

6
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:18,502
where you are excited about
a date with a total stranger?

7
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:19,347
Huh?

8
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:21,077
Only one thing can save you,

9
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:24,020
can protect you from today's coniving,

10
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,276
competitive and occasionally
cruel world of courtship,

11
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:30,335
and it's not made a lamb skin or latex.

12
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:31,502
It's a lawyer.

13
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:34,199
A compatibility-

14
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,782
(upbeat music)

15
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:51,555
- Hi, how are you?

16
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,640
Oh Carter, you're so sweet.

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,223
(upbeat music)

18
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:01,730
(people chattering)

19
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,563
(couple laughing)

20
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:17,894
So.

21
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:20,644
(cheerful music)

22
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,807
No.

23
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:32,890
Um, no, wait.

24
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,124
- Are you sure?

25
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,041
- Yeah, um,

26
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:43,339
look Carter, I think you're a great guy.

27
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:45,589
It's just, you're so sweet,

28
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:48,198
so polite, so nice.

29
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,480
Do you think we could be friends?

30
00:02:55,804 --> 00:03:00,257
- I, I don't suppose you mean
friends as in friends first?

31
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:02,424
- No, I mean just friends.

32
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:06,028
- Huh.

33
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,437
- It's safer this way.

34
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:11,687
I mean, if I ever hurt you,

35
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,443
I just don't know what I'd do with myself.

36
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:21,687
- Do you believe this shit?

37
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:24,604
(melancholy music)

38
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,960
- [Pat] Man, that just me pisses me off.

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,949
- [Carter] I know, I
know, I really liked her.

40
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:41,782
- [Pat] Yeah.

41
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:43,343
Well, where has that ever gotten ya?

42
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:44,881
Dog shit.

43
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:46,336
- [Carter] Yeah, well,
what are you gonna do?

44
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,258
- [Pat] She should be shot.

45
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,059
- [Carter] I don't think
we need to go that far.

46
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:52,075
- Hey look, look, look, there she is.

47
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,454
You suck!

48
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:54,699
- Take it easy.

49
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,072
- Take it easy?

50
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,837
Dude, we're teachers.

51
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,680
Outside of lotteries and lawsuits,

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,196
gambling is our only legitimate hope

53
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:03,485
of making any serious cash.

54
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,086
- I don't know, maybe we're
overlooking something.

55
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:06,109
We need, we need a system.

56
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:08,577
- Yeah, I got your system for ya.

57
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:12,078
No more betting on chick
horses or chick jockeys

58
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:13,875
or chick trainers or chick owners or-

59
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,968
- I sense something
deeper is troubling you.

60
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:19,135
- Yeah well, I hate women.

61
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:22,489
- No you don't.
- Oh yes I do.

62
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:23,372
- Oh, and who is it this time

63
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:26,171
who has you dismissing the entire gender?

64
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,564
- Oh, fucking Jennifer.

65
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,166
100 bucks on dinner last night.

66
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,930
You know what I get?
- Hmm.

67
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,317
See, I'm guessing something short

68
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:35,266
of a religious sexual experience.

69
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:38,366
- Yeah, a kiss at the door,
then thank you and good night.

70
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,199
- Well wasn't it your first date?

71
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,985
- I don't think you heard me.

72
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:42,161
$100.

73
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:42,994
- Hey, hey, hey,

74
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:44,295
you shouldn't do that.

75
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:45,650
The results aren't official yet.

76
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,463
- Dude, our horse ran last.

77
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:49,117
They'd have to disqualify six horses

78
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:52,200
before this ticket would matter.

79
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,953
Anyway, I'm never asking
Jennifer out again.

80
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:57,681
Next time I drop 100 bucks on a skirt,

81
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,760
it's gonna be at the
God damn chicken ranch.

82
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,688
- [Announcer] Results of the
sixth race are now official.

83
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:03,521
Moving towards the winner's circle.

84
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,629
- Aw crap.

85
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:08,378
If I'd have had the four
horse I'd have won 380 bucks.

86
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,173
- Damn, how much did you bet?

87
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:11,634
- 20 Across the board.

88
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,643
- $60, plus 100 on dinner last night?

89
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:16,240
Where is all this money coming from?

90
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,247
- Credit cards.

91
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,353
Hey, they keep sending me applications.

92
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,627
It's amazing though what happens

93
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,044
when you miss a few payments.

94
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,099
How much did you put down?

95
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,582
- Uh, two to place.

96
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,161
- Whoa. (laughs)

97
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:35,537
Hey, don't hurt yourself, Mr. Vegas.

98
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:37,033
- Hey, I'm saving up for the big bet.

99
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:37,937
- Yeah, whatever.

100
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,033
- Yeah, you'll see.

101
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,143
- [Pat] What do you say we cut our losses

102
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:41,235
and get another beer?

103
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:42,068
- [Carter] You go ahead.

104
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:45,214
I'm gonna start working on the next race.

105
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:47,250
- [Erin] Hi Carter.

106
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,007
- Hello Erin.

107
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:50,757
- You're looking hot.

108
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,899
Of course, you always look that way.

109
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,426
- Yeah right.

110
00:05:57,426 --> 00:06:01,099
- Oh, Susan, my old sorority sister,

111
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,129
the one who's finishing law school.

112
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,222
She saw your picture

113
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:05,594
and she has been asking
about you ever since.

114
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:07,178
So just say the word
and I'll set you two up.

115
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:09,107
- Yeah, why are you so anxious to do that?

116
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,366
- Because if I can't have you,

117
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:14,699
one of my friends having
you is the next best thing.

118
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:16,951
- Okay, so it's a team effort, huh?

119
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,451
(Erin laughs)

120
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:24,491
- No, that's another fantasy all together.

121
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:25,574
- Cut it out.

122
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,504
Does Chris know you talk to me this way?

123
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:33,209
- Chris knows what I want him to know.

124
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,959
- Oh, how convenient.

125
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,425
- You know what my mom always says?

126
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:38,327
"If you can find a man"

127
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:40,804
"who you're just a
little more clever than,"

128
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:42,762
"then you can have your
cake and eat it, too."

129
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,163
- Really?

130
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:46,857
Just how much cake do you plan on eating?

131
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,126
- Call me sometime.

132
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:50,793
(sensual music)

133
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:56,502
I'd love to show you.

134
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:03,808
- Yowza.

135
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,135
That is somebody you should
definitely look into boning.

136
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:10,277
- Pat, she's my sister.

137
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,088
- She's your stepsister.

138
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,659
Your former stepsister.

139
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,150
Your old man was married to
her mom for what, six weeks?

140
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,489
- Six months.

141
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:18,322
- Come on.

142
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:20,584
- Well, she still seems like family.

143
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,813
- Yeah and this is Kentucky.

144
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,298
Shit, they'll bust you
for playing rap music

145
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:24,885
before they'll bust for incest.

I reckon. (chuckles)

160
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:19,036
- Maggie!

161
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,803
Oh, I can't believe you did it.

162
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:24,108
I never thought I'd say the
day that you would move here.

163
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:26,633
- Yeah, lost a few bets on that one.

164
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,119
But the vet school folks are right.

165
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,679
If you like horses,
this is the place to be.

166
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,512
Okay, I can't breathe.

167
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,882
- Oh, I am so glad you're here.

168
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:40,292
- Well, you have made
that abundantly clear.

169
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:41,125
Oh, here.

170
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:44,132
You want a beer?

171
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,002
- Oh, no thank you.

172
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,477
I'm uh, watching my calories.

173
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:48,959
- God, you don't need to.

174
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,614
Married life is obviously
agreeing with you.

175
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,525
- So what's up with Matt?

176
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:58,407
Oh, will he be coming to
visit you anytime soon?

177
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,240
- No.

178
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:03,055
- Oh, what happened?

179
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:05,308
- He wanted to see other people.

180
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:06,571
- And he told you this?

181
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:08,909
- No, I kind of figured it out for myself

182
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,759
when I walked in on
him with his secretary.

183
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,371
She was on her knees, and let's just say,

184
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,606
she wasn't praying.

185
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:17,606
- Oh Maggie.

186
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:24,099
Well, there's already someone here

187
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:27,017
who's just dying to meet you.

188
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,348
- Oh really?

189
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:29,253
And who might that be?

190
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:32,015
- Only the most eligible bachelor in town.

191
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,265
Robert Landler.

192
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:37,291
He is worth millions and he is really,

193
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,208
I mean really handsome.

194
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:44,100
- Uh-huh, and how old is he, Kate?

195
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:47,634
- 46.

196
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,627
(Maggie laughs)

197
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,869
- 46, no, thanks.

198
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:53,823
I'd like someone mature,
but not that mature.

199
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:57,043
(both laughing)

200
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:58,791
- Oh, so, should I call him?

201
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,458
(calming music)

202
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,292
- You must be the new vet.

203
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:19,125
Welcome.

204
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:19,958
- Thank you.

205
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,958
And you are?

206
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,111
- I'm Rufus, the stallion manager.

207
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:25,508
- Oh, hello.

208
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:27,437
- Pleased to meet you.

209
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:28,429
Um, not to bother you,

210
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,767
but I'd like you to come and
take a gander at something.

211
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:31,600
- Okay.

212
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:39,301
- So you're a big Kentucky fan, huh?

213
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:42,285
- Only 146 days till basketball season.

214
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,952
(Maggie laughs)

215
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:48,329
Pembroke, you know, one of our stallions,

216
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:52,030
he banged up his leg and I
think it's just a little cut.

217
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,087
I don't think it's nothing serious, but.

218
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,511
- Well, let me take a look.

219
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:59,011
That's why I'm on the payroll.

220
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:05,267
(whimsical music)

221
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:13,507
It's just a superficial laceration.

222
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,718
- A cut.

223
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:16,220
- Glad to hear that.
- Right.

224
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,053
(whimsical music)

225
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,697
- May I help you?

226
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:27,953
- Maggie, this is my boy, Little Rufus.

227
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:28,786
- Hello there.

228
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,619
(whimsical music)

229
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:37,861
- He saw you come in this morning.

230
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,482
I think he's sweet on you.

231
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,237
(Maggie laughs)
(phone ringing)

232
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:42,090
- I should get that.

233
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,923
- Okay.

234
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:45,365
See you later.

235
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,813
- Vet's office.

236
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:49,572
- Maggie?
- Oh, hi Kate.

237
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:51,569
- How's your first day going?

238
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:53,276
- Great, it's great.

239
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:54,775
- [Kate] Glad to hear it.

240
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:58,174
Find any uh, studs around there yet?

241
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:00,444
- (laughs) Only the four-legged kind.

242
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:02,762
- Oh, no cute guys at all?

243
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:04,130
- Oh, let's just say

244
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,522
I'm quickly developing
an interest in older men.

245
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:09,355
- Hmm.

246
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,950
- And romance is a
subject the cavalier poets

247
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,749
of the early 17th century knew quite well.

248
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:19,862
Now I want you to imagine
what might have influenced

249
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:21,262
the likes of Thomas Carew,

250
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:23,720
Richard Loveless and Andrew Marvell.

251
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,970
Does anyone have any ideas?

252
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,120
- Well, what about dating?

253
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,372
I mean, did people go
out on dates back then?

254
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,096
- Unlikely.

255
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:34,929
If you think about it,

256
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:39,097
dating is a phenomenon
unique to the 20th century.

257
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,598
It came to exist mainly because

258
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:43,224
the population grew too
large and sophisticated

259
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,339
for our marriages to be arranged anymore.

260
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,186
But the real question is,

261
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:49,026
do you think by not dating,

262
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:52,357
people from the past missed
out on some good times?

263
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:53,569
- Are you kidding?

264
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,426
Men had nothing but good
times in those days.

265
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:56,259
- Uh, excuse me.

266
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,652
I seem to recall women having
their share of fun as well.

267
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,638
I mean, Catherine the Great

268
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,894
wasn't exactly the poster
child for safe sex.

269
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,966
(students laughing)

270
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:05,799
- Suffice it to say,

271
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,804
the world we live in today
is considerably more complex

272
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:11,588
than the one in which the
cavalier poets resided.

273
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:12,937
- That's just it though.

274
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:15,787
I think people as a whole, men and women,

275
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:18,057
were better off before
dating was invented.

276
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,439
- Why do you say that?

277
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:21,112
- No one played games.

278
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:22,986
Today that's all dating's about.

279
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:25,716
When to call, how long to wait.

280
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:28,852
Lame excuses when someone
breaks up with you.

281
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:30,085
- Come on,

282
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:32,936
you guys don't play games
with each other, do you?

283
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:35,019
- Well-
- Not yet, anyway.

284
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:36,901
Do you?

285
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,803
- Mr. Wagner, you have to play games.

286
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:41,509
If you tell a girl you like her,

287
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:43,267
it's like telling her you got herpes.

288
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,179
She immediately loses interest.

289
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,508
- Or runs away screaming.

290
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:49,333
- Or pretends you don't exist.

291
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,563
- That's ridiculous.

292
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,370
- Like you've never played hard to get.

293
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,275
- Like you would know.

294
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:54,792
- I'd say you're doing it right now.

295
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,387
- You're mistaking
rejection for flirtation.

296
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:58,220
- [Boy] Did you say erection?

297
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,580
- Okay, hey hey hey.
- I think she wants you.

298
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,069
- Listen up.

299
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:05,152
You do not play games with
other people's hearts.

300
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:08,728
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

301
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:10,008
If you feel compelled to play games

302
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:12,244
with other people's emotions,
well you go right ahead,

303
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:15,364
but be warned, the gods
will get even with you.

304
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:17,207
- [Students] Ooh.

305
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,486
- Oh, it won't be obvious at first.

306
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:21,047
It may be something simple
like a jammed cassette tape

307
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:24,222
or a skipping CD or a stolen car stereo.

308
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:27,326
But, if none of that
convinces you to stop,

309
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,656
the gods will visit you with
the modern day equivalent

310
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,823
of lice, oils and plagues.

311
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,459
They'll make you fall in love

312
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,735
with someone who plays the
games even better than you do.

313
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,652
(thunder cracking)

314
00:14:57,362 --> 00:15:00,195
(Carter chuckles)

315
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:09,599
- [Voicemail] You have three new messages.

316
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:13,132
- Just listen to some of
these satisfied clients.

317
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:14,872
- After my first couple
of dates with Jeff,

318
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,108
he told me he'd call me
one or two times a week.

319
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,711
That's just unacceptable.

320
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,075
So my lawyer stepped in,

321
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:22,413
and he got me three to five, mandatory.

322
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,620
- Things were going great with this girl,

323
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,471
then she told me she loved me.

324
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:27,768
I didn't know what to do.

325
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:29,485
I got desperate, so I called my lawyer.

326
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:30,715
- Oh. (chuckles)

327
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:32,353
- [Man] And he helped
me end the relationship

328
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:35,101
by saying that she was
moving way too fast.

329
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,637
- [Man] I was going out
for about two months,

330
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,596
and she stopped returning my calls.

331
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:39,871
All my stuff was over at her
house and I wanted it all back.

332
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,652
- [Pat Voicemail] Hey, it's Pat.

333
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:42,522
Barbara called in sick,

334
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:45,082
so I'm with you on the
field trip tomorrow.

335
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:46,976
How about that centerfold?

336
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:48,210
Wow.

337
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,377
Wow, wow, wow.

338
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,584
See ya.

339
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,643
(answering machine beeping)

340
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:53,764
- [Erin] Hi, it's Erin.

341
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,236
Listen, my rocket scientist of a boyfriend

342
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:58,613
can't seem to figure out
how to hook up my stereo.

343
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:02,724
So I thought I'd look
up my favorite expert.

344
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:03,557
Call me.

345
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,963
- This woman was born in the '80s?

346
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,524
Is that even legal?

347
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:09,097
(answering machine beeping)

348
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,086
- [Bridget] Carter?

349
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:13,087
It's Bridget, remember me? (chuckles)

350
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:13,920
Guess what?

351
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,230
I'm gonna be home for Joe and
Molly's wedding next Saturday,

352
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,135
and I thought that maybe
we could get together.

353
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,423
I'll call you when get to town, okay?

354
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:24,423
I can't wait to see you.

355
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:30,206
(answering machine beeping)

356
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:35,375
(horses snorting)

357
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,958
(upbeat music)

358
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:52,646
- She's a Pembroke filly out
of a mare named In My Cap,

359
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,847
and we're confident she'll
bring us a big number

360
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,083
at the Kealin Select sales next month.

361
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,490
Since Pembroke's first
crop of two year olds

362
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,637
already have three Greater
Stakes winners between them,

363
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:06,559
and this filly, she just
looks like a winner.

364
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,843
She's confident,

365
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,998
she's got a well developed hind quarters,

366
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:14,158
and a wonderful disposition.

367
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,741
Your typical foal will stand...

368
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,825
Once a foal does this...

369
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:23,382
(whimsical music)

370
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:25,430
(head slamming)

371
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,632
Okay boys, take her back.

372
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:32,056
Now, if you all uh, follow
me to the barn over there,

373
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:37,056
we'll wind up your tour today
with a very special surprise.

374
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:39,268
(host laughs)

375
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,574
This way.

376
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:42,237
- Special surprise?

377
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:43,222
- Hey, I'll lead the way.

378
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:45,158
(people chattering)

379
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,482
- [Host] Both thoroughbreds
have the same birthday,

380
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:49,264
and that's January 1st.

381
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:51,547
- Quiet down.
- Following their birth.

382
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:53,360
So obviously,

383
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,281
the earlier a horse is born
in the year, the better,

384
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:59,315
'cause they'll be physically older

385
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:01,864
and therefore more developed

386
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:04,781
than horses born later in the year.

387
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:09,162
(whimsical music)

388
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:17,060
- Okay.

389
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:18,815
- Oh shit.

390
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:21,648
(whimsical music)

391
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,255
Sorry about that.

392
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:32,212
- Was it something I said?

393
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:34,721
I'm Carter Wagner.

394
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:35,965
- Maggie Dahlia.

395
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,588
Nice to meet you.

396
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:39,209
- Nice to meet you.

397
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:41,209
So uh, you work here or?

398
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:44,215
- Yeah, just started.

399
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:47,026
- We'll have more than
100 foals this year.

400
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,893
A process that begins right here.

401
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:52,726
(horse whinnying)

402
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,726
- Wow, is that the stallion?

403
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:58,183
- No, that's the uh, teaser horse.

404
00:18:58,183 --> 00:18:59,618
- The teaser horse?

405
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:02,143
- His job is to tease the mare.

406
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:06,810
He uh, nuzzles her, nibbles
her, basically turns her on.

407
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,977
That way we make sure she'll
be ready for the stallion.

408
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:11,810
- Wait a minute,

409
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,029
are you saying this horse
does all the groundwork

410
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:16,063
and another guy comes
in and seals the deal?

411
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,599
- Basically, yes.

412
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,651
- Sounds to me like he's
the one who's being teased.

413
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:22,307
(gate slamming)

414
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:24,695
- Well, you might say the most a teaser

415
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:28,345
and the mare could ever
be is just good friends.

416
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:29,707
- [Boys] That sucks.

417
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:31,513
(people chattering)

418
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:34,754
- [Pat] Hey now, come on
you guys, let's behave.

419
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:37,058
(horse neighing)

420
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:38,763
- I thought if horses got
sick you just shot 'em.

421
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:39,887
(Maggie laughs)

422
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,210
- Only the ones who are really sick.

423
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,354
- I think a few of the
ones I bet on recently

424
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:45,058
fall into that category.

425
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,936
- Ah, haven't cashed a ticket in a while?

426
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,183
- That's putting it mildly.

427
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:49,975
- Yeah, I know how you feel.

428
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:52,587
I had more than a few of
my own frustrating moments

429
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:56,580
before I discovered the
best way to pick winners.

430
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,441
- Wait a second, you have a system?

431
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,655
- Hm, do I have a system?

432
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:03,049
I haven't lost at the track in years.

433
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:04,670
- Really?

434
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,503
What's your secret?

435
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,442
(phone ringing)

436
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:08,268
- Oh, excuse me, phone.

437
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:09,374
Gotta get it, so.

438
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,814
- Y'all need to move back there now.

439
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:12,816
- Okay, you heard the man.

440
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,385
Move to the back of the barn.

441
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:15,663
(people chattering)

442
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:18,014
- [Student] There's
something seriously wrong.

443
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:20,043
- [Student] Did you see the size...

444
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:24,109
- Mr. Johnson, What
exactly is going on here?

445
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:27,692
- Watch and learn, my
boy, watch and learn.

446
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:33,128
(horse neighing)

447
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:35,628
(tense music)

448
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:42,985
- Who's the chick?

449
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:44,740
- She's a veterinarian.

450
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,573
- Nice.

451
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,513
(tense music)

452
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,752
(gate slamming)

453
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:58,252
- Pat, Pat, what exactly is going on here?

454
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:01,855
- Watch and learn, my boy.

455
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:04,438
(tense music)

456
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:17,705
- And the rest, as they
say, is up to nature.

457
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:19,412
(man chuckling)

458
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,329
(horses whinnying)

459
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:29,294
(horse grunting)

460
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:33,880
- Oh, gnarly.

461
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,797
(horses whinnying)

462
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,026
- Are you okay?

463
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:50,914
- That was more than I needed to see.

464
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:52,599
- You think you're sick to your stomach?

465
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,882
How do you think that makes a guy feel?

466
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:57,611
- Now is not a good time
to try and make me laugh.

467
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:00,444
(glorious music)

468
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:13,047
- Okay. (clearing throat)

469
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,880
We're running late, let's
get back on the bus.

470
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,297
Let's go, pronto.

471
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:21,625
- Man, talk about Philly Fanatic.

472
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,796
(students chattering)

473
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:25,015
(Pat whistles)

474
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:27,524
- Ah, I just made a
complete idiot of myself.

475
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:29,913
- I don't think anyone noticed.

476
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,500
- Thanks.
- No problem.

477
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,324
Just don't let it happen again.

478
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:36,527
- Y'all come back now, you here?

479
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:38,421
- [Student] I don't feel so good.

480
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:41,338
(student coughing)

481
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:46,408
- Sure Robert, dinner sounds great.

482
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,241
Okay, I will um, see at 7:30 then.

483
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,393
Okay, Robert, okay.

484
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,386
I gotta go now.

485
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,003
- Hillary.

486
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:57,836
Hey Chris.

487
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,128
Katie and Ellen.

488
00:23:01,302 --> 00:23:02,345
Did you get her number?

489
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:03,335
- She's got a boyfriend.

490
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:05,230
- Did you get her number?

491
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,578
- If you don't stop talking,

492
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:08,046
I'm gonna have to break our date.

493
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:08,879
- [Robert] Bye.

494
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:11,947
(disconnected tone buzzing)

495
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:13,697
- Southern gentleman.

496
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,711
(light dramatic music)

497
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:39,264
(rap music bumping)

498
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:43,785
(sirens blaring)

499
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:46,200
- So we're three months behind
in the house in Saint Bart's

500
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,569
and I'm going outta my mind.

501
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:52,239
So I fly down there, get
ahold of the contractor,

502
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:57,171
pull him aside, and I said
"Cliftone, word of advice."

503
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,909
"Don't ever do business
with a man named Cliftone."

504
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:04,868
I said "Cliftone, are
you a religious man?"

505
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:06,814
He says, "Yes, mon."

506
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:10,398
I said, "Would you ever lie
to your priest, Cliftone?"

507
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:12,429
He said, "No, mon."

508
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,118
So I said, "Good,"

509
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,062
"let's just pretend I'm
your God damn priest"

510
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:18,419
"and tell me when the hell
this job's gonna be finished."

511
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,525
(couple laughing)

512
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:24,784
- Sounds like you've led a
pretty interesting life so far.

513
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:25,784
- Yeah well.

514
00:24:27,562 --> 00:24:29,563
So what about you?

515
00:24:29,563 --> 00:24:30,960
What is it that you do?

516
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
- Oh, I-
- Hey!

517
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,904
Get me another Makers when
you get a chance, double.

518
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:37,141
You want some more wine?

519
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:39,343
- Sure.
- And another glass of wine.

520
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:40,691
Oh wait, wait, wait.

521
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,788
Fuck it, let's get a whole bottle.

522
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:43,621
- Wow.

523
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:46,323
- Bring us a bottle to
the Lafite, the '78.

524
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:47,303
- Mr. Landler, are you sure?

525
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:49,744
I mean, that's a 500-
- Sure, I'm sure, honey.

526
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:51,976
Don't you think this lovely
lady deserves a chance to taste

527
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:53,938
the best bottle of red wine in the house.

528
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:56,085
(Maggie laughs)

529
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:57,585
- Right away, sir.

530
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:02,109
- You are really gonna enjoy this.

531
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,730
I mean, the French,

532
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,822
they know a thing or
two about the wine, eh.

533
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:08,655
- Oh yeah?

534
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:10,324
- Ah, oui.

535
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:14,104
(Maggie laughs)

536
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,227
Ah, Maggie.

537
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:23,293
(speaking in French)

538
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:27,445
- What did you just say?

539
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:32,156
- I said you are really, really beautiful.

540
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:39,158
- Oh. (sighs)

541
00:25:39,158 --> 00:25:39,991
Thank you.

542
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,925
(Maggie chuckles)

543
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:52,201
- Oh yeah, ride the glory train!

544
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:55,677
Oh God almighty, ride the train!

545
00:25:55,677 --> 00:25:57,344
Oh, I'm cumming, oh!

546
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:01,649
(Robert panting)

547
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:05,924
Oh, God damn, I needed that.

548
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,720
(Robert panting)

549
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:16,044
Was it good for you?

550
00:26:17,002 --> 00:26:17,919
- Oh, yeah.

551
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:21,692
Epic.

552
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:24,473
- You know,

553
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:30,220
you never did tell me what
it is you do for a living.

554
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,242
- I'm the staff vet out at Hermitage Farm.

555
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:34,075
- Ah.

556
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:36,380
Horses.

557
00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:39,451
- Yes.

558
00:26:40,923 --> 00:26:43,995
- I used to own a few
thoroughbreds myself.

559
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:45,514
- Really?

560
00:26:45,514 --> 00:26:49,303
- Yeah, we had a real good
run there for a while.

561
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:52,099
There's Kelly's Delight, Kelly's fantasy,

562
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:56,064
What the Kell, Kellamanjaro, Kellifornia.

563
00:26:56,064 --> 00:27:00,580
Then there was Kelter Skelter,
Kellecatessin, Kellbassa.

564
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,036
- Is there a theme here or is it just me?

565
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:04,869
- Yeah.

566
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:09,548
My first wife, her name was Kelly.

567
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:12,210
- You don't say.

568
00:27:13,572 --> 00:27:14,405
- Oh, I'm sorry.

569
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:16,733
I promised myself I wouldn't
talk about her anymore.

570
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,401
- Oh, no, I asked you about
your horses, don't worry about-

571
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:22,275
- It's just that she was so beautiful.

572
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,048
She was a model.

573
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:25,040
- Yeah.

574
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,754
Yeah, I believe you mentioned that.

575
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:30,723
- She even did some of
those magazine covers,

576
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:33,640
swimsuit issues all over the world.

577
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:37,072
She was really something else.

578
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:37,905
- Hmm.

579
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:43,455
- Oh, that's all in the past.

580
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,657
I'm not really into looks anymore.

581
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:46,490
- What?

582
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:50,606
- Oh, I don't mean to say
you're not attractive, Maggie.

583
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:52,658
You're very attractive.

584
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:55,880
Well, I just slept with you, didn't I?

585
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,716
- You bastard.

586
00:27:57,716 --> 00:27:59,133
- What?

587
00:27:59,133 --> 00:27:59,966
Kelly?

588
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:02,338
Maggie.

589
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:04,540
Oh, you're beautiful.

590
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,848
(speaking in French)

591
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:07,348
- You are a freak.

592
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:11,531
- Oh, Christ, give me a break here.

593
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:14,466
Don't do what Kelly did to me.

594
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:17,363
That woman gave me a
vasectomy of the heart.

595
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,196
- Good.

596
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,973
- Wait, Maggie!

597
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:23,850
(speaking in French)

598
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,683
- So you gonna call him?

599
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,433
- No, absolutely not.

600
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,731
Ugh, what is this stuff, anyway?

601
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:32,943
- Country ham.

602
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:35,247
It's a Kentucky tradition.

603
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,568
- I think I need something
a little less traditional,

604
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:39,719
like a cheeseburger.

605
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,493
- Maybe you should call him,

606
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:45,004
just to make sure he
doesn't, oh, kiss and tell.

607
00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:46,916
- He probably doesn't even remember it.

608
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:50,090
And frankly, I don't care
what he says or who he tells.

609
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,046
I mean, could you explain something to me?

610
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:55,514
- Sure.

611
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:56,462
- Why is it that when a man

612
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:57,797
sleeps with a woman on a first date,

613
00:28:57,797 --> 00:28:59,969
his buddies worship him as a stud?

614
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:01,351
But oh God, I mean,

615
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:02,938
if a woman sleeps with
a man on a first date,

616
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:05,635
well then she's labeled as a slut.

617
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:06,608
- [Kate] A tramp.

618
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:07,441
- A whore?

619
00:29:09,176 --> 00:29:10,676
- No habla ingles.

620
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:14,090
- Mm-hm, typical.

621
00:29:15,914 --> 00:29:18,322
It's amazing that the human
race has survived this long

622
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:21,036
and only one legitimate gender.

623
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:23,220
- You're really upset about this.

624
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,295
- Yeah.

625
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,424
But, it wasn't that I slept with him.

626
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,157
Just that I kept thinking of someone else.

627
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:32,597
- Oh, I know how you feel, honey.

628
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:34,849
We've all done that, believe me.

629
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:36,676
- No, I don't think you understand.

630
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:41,577
It's not like I was imagining
him to be someone else.

631
00:29:41,577 --> 00:29:44,302
It's that I couldn't get
this guy outta my head.

632
00:29:44,302 --> 00:29:46,606
Like I was cheating on
him or I let him down.

633
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:48,432
- Well, you must not be over Matt yet.

634
00:29:48,432 --> 00:29:50,275
- It wasn't him I saw.

635
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:51,555
- Who was it?

636
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:54,456
- Some guy I just met yesterday.

637
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:55,873
A school teacher.

638
00:29:56,794 --> 00:30:00,061
- Ha, you can forget about him.

639
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:01,160
- Why?

640
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,993
- Do you know how much,

641
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:04,540
or should I say how
little money they make?

642
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,519
- I forgot, you're Republican.

643
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,054
- I'm just practical.

644
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:10,223
You should pursue Robert.

645
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,885
He obviously really likes you.

646
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:14,966
- I don't think so.

647
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:17,109
Besides I'm never gonna
hear from him again.

648
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,362
- Why would you say that?

649
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:21,956
- Because I slept with him.

650
00:30:21,956 --> 00:30:23,577
- And that means that he won't call?

651
00:30:23,577 --> 00:30:24,874
- When you sleep with
a guy on a first date,

652
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:28,168
you're telling him you're not
interested in a relationship.

653
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:29,414
- Hmm.

654
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:31,428
Sure is a nice way to say it.

655
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:33,647
(answering machine beeping)

656
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:35,386
- Hi Maggie, it's Robert.

657
00:30:35,386 --> 00:30:38,339
I had a really great time last night.

658
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:41,260
I hope we can get together again soon.

659
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,760
Call me, 555-0118.

660
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,546
(Robert sipping)

661
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,133
(answering machine beeping)

662
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:52,240
- I can't believe you rented a dog.

663
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,558
- At least I'm honest.
- What?

664
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:56,507
- Canine ownership has nothing to do

665
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:58,534
with mankind's love of animals.

666
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:03,053
A guy gets a dog for one
simple reason, to meet chicks.

667
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:05,835
- So all that talk
about man's best friend,

668
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:08,890
unconditional love, a
four-legged security system.

669
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,420
- Mere rhetoric.

670
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,253
Hey, be careful.

671
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:15,170
That little fucker bit
me on the way over here.

672
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,327
Man, that just pisses me off.

673
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:22,622
- Bad horoscope?

674
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:25,575
- Eh, no, not that, Jennifer.

675
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:26,599
- I thought she was history.

676
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:29,722
- She was, till we went
out again last night.

677
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:30,746
- Oh I see,

678
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:33,234
but today you're out trolling
for women with a dog,

679
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:35,046
so I'm assuming it didn't work out.

680
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:37,248
- Actually it went great.

681
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:39,071
At least it started off that way.

682
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,829
Then we get back to her place.

683
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:44,072
She invites me and then
excuses herself to freshen up

684
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:45,727
and we both know what that means.

685
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:47,826
She needs to go to the bathroom
before you fool around.

686
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:48,659
- Right.

687
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:52,329
- Oh, she's so cute.

688
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,662
What's her name?

689
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:56,006
- Uh, uh it's, uh,

690
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:02,149
Shakespeare?

691
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:03,515
- Shakespeare?

692
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:04,932
But she's a girl.

693
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,904
- Well, uh, it's a well known fact

694
00:32:08,904 --> 00:32:12,571
that he was in touch
with his feminine side.

695
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:22,992
Too young.

696
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:26,505
- Not forever.

697
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:28,826
So while she's in there taking a dump,

698
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:31,483
I happened to poke around a little.

699
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:32,316
- Oh no.

700
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:33,624
- You will not fucking believe

701
00:32:33,624 --> 00:32:35,752
what I find in her linen closet.

702
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:38,093
- Towels, pillowcase, blankets.

703
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,227
What were you doing?
- Sheets.

704
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:42,310
Four God damn sets worth.

705
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,477
- You have lost me again.

706
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:46,310
- Don't you get it, man.

707
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,542
Anybody that has more
than two sets of sheets

708
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:50,125
is changing them way too often.

709
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:53,631
She's a total slut.

710
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:55,870
- So you left?

711
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,537
- Damn right I left.

712
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:01,144
Right after I fucked her.

713
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:02,339
- Wait a second.

714
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,558
First you didn't want
anything to do with this girl

715
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:05,540
because she didn't put out.

716
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,973
Now you don't wanna have
anything to do with her

717
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:08,473
because she does?

718
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:11,633
- Yeah, that's pretty much it.

719
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:12,652
Shit, I'm not gonna get serious

720
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:15,577
with somebody that has sex
with me on the second date.

721
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,545
Though I'd probably nail her
again if I had the chance.

722
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:18,794
- Hi there.

723
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:19,627
- Hi.

724
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:21,330
She's so adorable.

725
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,913
- Yes, but deceptively vicious.

726
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:26,310
- Huh?

727
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,823
- She bit four people already today.

728
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:30,481
Has she even had her shots yet?

729
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:32,814
(dog barks)

730
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:36,315
- You are unstoppable.

731
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,869
- You know, I've been thinking.

732
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:43,031
- Oh really?

733
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:44,509
- Yeah.

734
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:47,650
That chick from the horse farm.

735
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,687
- Who, Maggie?

736
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:50,056
- Yeah.

737
00:33:50,056 --> 00:33:52,718
How'd you find out she had a boyfriend.

738
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:54,268
- Well, what's it matter?

739
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:57,382
- It's not exactly your style
to come right out and ask.

740
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:58,215
- Well, I didn't.

741
00:33:58,215 --> 00:34:00,491
I overheard her talking on
the phone with some guy.

742
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:02,488
They were making a date, she was laughing.

743
00:34:02,488 --> 00:34:05,215
- And so you think that
date is her boyfriend?

744
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,750
- Call it men's intuition.

745
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,789
- Call it dog shit.

746
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:10,092
- [Carter] Well then who
was that on the phone?

747
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,940
- I don't know, probably
some teaser horse, dude.

748
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,943
I bet she made the whole
thing up to make you jealous.

749
00:34:14,943 --> 00:34:18,319
- Ah, I suppose it
couldn't hurt to call her.

750
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:21,104
- Who knows, with the proper technique

751
00:34:21,104 --> 00:34:23,937
you might just end up with a date.

752
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:29,672
Meet you at your place in half an hour.

753
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:31,741
- What, you're giving
up on the dog already?

754
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:35,658
- It's not working out
quite the way I'd hoped.

755
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:41,296
(phone ringing)

756
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:45,520
- [Answering Machine] Hi, this is Maggie.

757
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,994
Leave a message and I'll call
you back as soon as possible.

758
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:49,381
Thanks.
(answering machine beeping)

759
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,131
- Hey, it's me again.

760
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,374
You know, Robert.

761
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:55,249
I'm in the Beamer right now.

762
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:57,332
My car phone is 555-0118.

763
00:35:00,252 --> 00:35:02,835
Home, as you know, is 555-0149.

764
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:10,122
The boat, well actually
the yacht, is 555-0198.

765
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:16,054
The fax number is-

766
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,766
- You know, I've called
women for dates before.

767
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:20,783
I think I can handle this.

768
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:21,616
- Sure you can.

769
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:24,504
You wanna end up with
another chick friend?

770
00:35:24,504 --> 00:35:25,765
You wouldn't even be making this call

771
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:27,354
if I hadn't put you up to it,

772
00:35:27,354 --> 00:35:30,414
so we're gonna do it my way.

773
00:35:30,414 --> 00:35:34,962
The worst case scenario is
your first career casual enemy.

774
00:35:34,962 --> 00:35:36,055
- Fine, fine.

775
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:36,888
Let's hear it.

776
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:37,843
- Okay.

777
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:41,819
One, don't stay on the phone
any longer than you have to.

778
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:44,089
It's like a covert military operation.

779
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:48,066
You go in, you kick some ass
and you get the hell out.

780
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:49,141
- Yes, sir.

781
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:53,527
- Two, avoid the words
sorry, maybe, and we.

782
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:54,568
We, what's wrong with we?

783
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:55,985
- She could infer it to mean

784
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:57,981
that you consider the two of you a couple

785
00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:00,729
before she considers
the two of you a couple.

786
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:02,368
That's dangerous ground, thin ice.

787
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,201
Keep out, road closed.

788
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,105
- I get the picture.

789
00:36:04,105 --> 00:36:05,334
- Uh, three,

790
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:08,679
don't let the whole thing last
any longer than 30 seconds.

791
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,157
- 30 seconds?

792
00:36:10,157 --> 00:36:10,997
- Hi, how are you?

793
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:14,151
Single, let's have
dinner, super, goodnight.

794
00:36:14,151 --> 00:36:16,318
Don't worry, I'll time ya.

795
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:18,039
All right.

796
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:21,860
(determined music)

797
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:26,214
I've got tone.

798
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:28,859
You may fire when ready.

799
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,526
(phone dialing)

800
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,068
- Where do you get this stuff anyway?

801
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,355
- You don't wanna know.

802
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:40,022
(phone ringing)

803
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,383
- Look asshole,

804
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:46,785
what happened between
us was just one night

805
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:48,666
and that's all it will ever be.

806
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:49,517
Got it?

807
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:51,363
There are a million
numbers in the phone book.

808
00:36:51,363 --> 00:36:52,446
Find another!

809
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,636
(phone beeping)

810
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:57,469
(men laughing)

811
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:58,302
- Jesus.

812
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:06,273
- Not exactly the charm school
valedictorian now, is she?

813
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:07,539
- I must have called the wrong number.

814
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:08,665
- Ah, I'm sorry.

815
00:37:08,665 --> 00:37:10,628
I must have skipped the
section of the lecture

816
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,113
that covered basic dialing.

817
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:13,000
- Ha ha ha.

818
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,833
- Ha ha.

819
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,449
Let's try it again now, Romeo.

820
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:18,165
(phone dialing)

821
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:20,832
(phone ringing)

822
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:24,807
- Hello?

823
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,287
- Is this Maggie?

824
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,204
- Uh, yeah.

825
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:33,796
- This is uh, Carter Wagner.

826
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:37,039
Met you on the field trip yesterday.

827
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,872
- Oh, hi.

828
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:42,739
I wondered what happened to you.

829
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:45,231
- I'm sorry I didn't get
a chance to say goodbye.

830
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:46,731
- Oh, that's okay.

831
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:49,599
- A few of the kids were uh, a little,

832
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,040
uh, how should I put it, uh,

833
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,993
awe struck by the chain
of events that transpired.

834
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:56,017
- Yeah, I was a little surprised

835
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:57,926
they let your group watch a breeding.

836
00:37:57,926 --> 00:37:59,788
- That makes two of us.

837
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:02,280
Uh, anyway, uh, I was wondering.

838
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,372
- Yeah?

839
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:04,516
- If you were free next weekend,

840
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:07,144
maybe we could get together.

841
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:10,114
That is, if you don't have a boyfriend.

842
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:11,581
- No.

843
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,414
- No?

844
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:17,414
- No, I don't have a boyfriend
and I'd love to get together.

845
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:19,095
Um, how about lunch?

846
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:21,276
(Pat sneezing)

847
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:22,641
Goodness.

848
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:23,989
God bless you, are you okay?

849
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:25,474
- Uh, yeah, yeah, allergies.

850
00:38:25,474 --> 00:38:26,836
Could you hold on a second?

851
00:38:26,836 --> 00:38:28,167
- [Maggie] Sure.

852
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,000
- No lunch.

853
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,398
Lunch bad, dinner yes, dinner good.

854
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:32,704
- In English please.

855
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,540
- Lunch is too safe.

856
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,373
It's got a time limit.

857
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:35,226
She can always cut it short

858
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:36,544
by saying she's gotta
get back to the ranch

859
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,360
and watch more horses do the bone dance.

860
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,277
Dinner good, lunch bed.

861
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,555
- Maggie, hi.

862
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,166
Um, how about dinner instead of lunch?

863
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,274
Heck, I can't take a date seriously

864
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:49,798
unless it starts after sundown.

865
00:38:49,798 --> 00:38:51,109
- Fair enough.

866
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:52,418
- Great, well what kind of food do you-

867
00:38:52,418 --> 00:38:53,596
(Pat sneezes)

868
00:38:53,596 --> 00:38:54,762
(Maggie laughs)

869
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:57,036
Did you happen to see what
the pollen count was today?

870
00:38:57,036 --> 00:38:58,202
I'll just be one more sec.

871
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,624
- Take your time.

872
00:38:59,624 --> 00:39:01,125
- What the hell are you doing?

873
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,849
- What the hell are you doing?

874
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:05,946
- Seeing where she wants to eat?

875
00:39:05,946 --> 00:39:06,779
- Why?

876
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:10,883
- I don't know, Pat, out of courtesy.

877
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,281
- Oh, pick the restaurant later.

878
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:14,161
That way she can't say
she'll meet you there.

879
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:14,994
- And that would be bad?

880
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:16,639
- Hell, hell yes.

881
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:19,550
Separate cars mean separate destinations

882
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,035
when the dinner is over.

883
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:25,470
That means no awkward moment
on her doorstep at midnight.

884
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,307
Besides, it's bad for the
environment, all those cars.

885
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:30,656
- Maggie, hi.

886
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:31,627
- Hi.

887
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:32,460
- How does eight-
(phone beeping)

888
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,599
- Oh, shoot, I'm sorry.

889
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,467
Can you hold on one second?

890
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,550
- I think I owe you that.

891
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:38,939
- Hello?

892
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:39,908
- It's call waiting.

893
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:41,256
- Eh, it's probably her mother.

894
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:42,109
- How do you know?

895
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:43,526
- It's always their mother.

896
00:39:43,526 --> 00:39:45,028
Hey, you're doing well.

897
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,485
Now just set the time and get out.

898
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,054
- Hi.
- Hi.

899
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:49,958
- Hi, you know what?

900
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,290
I'm sorry, but I need to take it.

901
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,123
It's my mom.

902
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,595
- Does Saturday work for you?

903
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:54,428
- Sure.

904
00:39:54,428 --> 00:39:55,283
I'll pick you up at eight.

905
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:56,932
- Sounds good.
- Great.

906
00:39:56,932 --> 00:39:57,765
- And don't forget,

907
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:59,435
I wanna hear all about
your wagering system.

908
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:00,845
- We'll see, bye.

909
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:01,678
- Goodbye.

910
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,098
- You and your systems.

911
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:07,501
- Hey.

912
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:09,088
She says she never loses at the track,

913
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:10,725
and I need a sure thing for the big bet.

914
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:11,750
- The big bet.

915
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,029
Do you ever consider
that her wagering system

916
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:15,991
may be not wagering at all?

917
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:18,741
(peaceful music)

918
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:33,223
- Oh.

919
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,056
Thanks.

920
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,473
- You're welcome.

921
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:39,920
Everything all right?

922
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,691
- Yeah, why?

923
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,321
- You just seem quiet.

924
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:45,618
I wanna make sure you were okay,

925
00:40:45,618 --> 00:40:47,905
what, with little Rufus leaving and all.

926
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:48,738
- Oh, he left?

927
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,571
What happened?

928
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:50,562
- He's gone down to Louisiana

929
00:40:50,562 --> 00:40:53,514
to compete in the National
Frog Gigging Championships.

930
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:56,491
He was sorry he didn't get
the chance to see ya off,

931
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:57,624
but he said he'd bring you back

932
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,587
some genuine Louisiana frog legs.

933
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:02,488
- (laughs) Seems like a very sweet kid.

934
00:41:02,488 --> 00:41:03,444
- He is.

935
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:04,775
Thank you.

936
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:06,256
He's gonna be a vet hisself someday.

937
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,506
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

938
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:11,914
Well I gotta get back
to the foes in barn two.

939
00:41:11,914 --> 00:41:14,356
- Okay.
- Oh, almost forgot.

940
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:15,585
A fella called for you this morning.

941
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:17,121
Said his name was Robert.

942
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:19,374
He left his number.

943
00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:20,968
- Thanks.

944
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:22,884
(bell ringing)

945
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:25,335
- So, do you wanna go out to
a movie or something sometime?

946
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:28,219
- What, you ask me in
front of all your friends?

947
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,039
- Shit, that didn't work at all.

948
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:33,329
(people chattering)

949
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:35,852
- [Boy] It's not like he's
insanely hot or anything.

950
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:36,927
- What was that all about?

951
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:37,760
- Nothing.

952
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,634
- Oh, here we go again.

953
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:39,467
- No, I'm not kidding.

954
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:41,911
I asked Megan out and she said no.

955
00:41:41,911 --> 00:41:44,146
By my account, I got nothing.

956
00:41:44,146 --> 00:41:46,022
- Oh, that's unfortunate.

957
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:46,855
- Yeah, yeah.

958
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:49,208
That's a good way of putting it.

959
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:51,755
- I wish I could say it gets
easier as you get older.

960
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:53,205
- Yeah great, thanks.

961
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:55,049
Any ideas on what to do next?

962
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:59,549
- Well for the next couple
of days, don't do anything.

963
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:02,591
- Yeah, thanks, then what?

964
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:05,898
- Ask her out again?

965
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:09,579
- Shit.

966
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:15,447
- Geez, what happened to these guys.

967
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:18,007
- Oh yeah, my old stereo kept eating them

968
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:19,782
so I got a new one.

969
00:42:19,782 --> 00:42:20,857
- You didn't wanna fix the old one?

970
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:22,135
- Mm, too much trouble.

971
00:42:22,135 --> 00:42:26,199
But now Chris is saying
that it needs two cables

972
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:29,366
and I have to buy some adapter thingy.

973
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,491
(lively music)

974
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:33,324
You rock.

975
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:38,569
So uh, where are you taking your big date?

976
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:39,795
- Ooh, uh.
(phone ringing)

977
00:42:39,795 --> 00:42:40,628
- Oh!

978
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:44,570
Oh, fuck.

979
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,745
- [Carter] What?

980
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:47,078
- It's Chris.

981
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:48,219
- So?

982
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:49,136
- So, ooh.

983
00:42:52,621 --> 00:42:54,294
Here, catch.

984
00:42:54,294 --> 00:42:55,301
- What, what is this?

985
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:56,885
- Uh, that would be my cell phone.

986
00:42:56,885 --> 00:42:59,052
Call me here, now.

987
00:42:59,052 --> 00:43:00,827
- What?
- Just do it.

988
00:43:00,827 --> 00:43:02,073
Hello?

989
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:02,906
Hi.

990
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:05,071
Not much.

991
00:43:05,925 --> 00:43:07,086
(phone dialing)

992
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,009
Hey listen, my mom's not
due back till tomorrow,

993
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:10,530
so I thought maybe you might want,

994
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,032
oh, hold on, that's me other line.

995
00:43:12,032 --> 00:43:13,141
Can you hold on a sec?

996
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:13,974
Okay.

997
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:16,379
(phone beeping)

998
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:17,989
- It's me.

999
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:18,924
- Hi, how are ya?

1000
00:43:18,924 --> 00:43:20,204
- Uh, confused.

1001
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:21,091
Why are we doing this?

1002
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:23,515
- Oh, well I don't feel like
talking to Chris right now.

1003
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:26,098
- Why did you answer the phone?

1004
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,446
- See, this way I can
find out where I stand.

1005
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:30,645
I leave him on hold for a few minutes,

1006
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:32,164
and if he's still there
when I click back over,

1007
00:43:32,164 --> 00:43:34,667
then I know that he's still whipped.

1008
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:35,842
- And to think all this time

1009
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:36,886
I was foolish enough to believe

1010
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:38,998
there actually was another call.

1011
00:43:38,998 --> 00:43:40,785
- Not usually.

1012
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,242
- What if he hangs up?

1013
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:46,570
- Then I wait for him to call me back.

1014
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,235
- How do you know he'll do that?

1015
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,985
- Because he's a guy.

1016
00:43:54,947 --> 00:43:56,947
Okay, that should do it.

1017
00:43:57,896 --> 00:43:58,729
You could.

1018
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,452
(phone beeping)

1019
00:44:05,452 --> 00:44:06,285
Chris?

1020
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:12,270
Oh my God, I am so sorry.

1021
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,235
That's my mom.

1022
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,068
I need to take it.

1023
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:16,346
Can I call you back?

1024
00:44:16,346 --> 00:44:17,763
Oh great, I, huh?

1025
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,473
Oh, yeah, of course we're
still on for this weekend.

1026
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:25,743
Okay, bye.

1027
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:30,128
(Erin sighs)

1028
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,722
- You said that was your
mother and it wasn't.

1029
00:44:32,722 --> 00:44:33,813
- Yeah.

1030
00:44:33,813 --> 00:44:37,632
Oh yeah, I haven't talked
to my mom in like a week.

1031
00:44:37,632 --> 00:44:38,465
- Huh?

1032
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:41,038
Do you think I can expect

1033
00:44:41,038 --> 00:44:43,767
the same level of bullshit from Maggie?

1034
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,350
- Only if you guys get serious.

1035
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,377
Don't even think about it.

1036
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:55,391
- What?

1037
00:44:55,391 --> 00:44:58,207
- Don't you dare take her
flowers on your first date.

1038
00:44:58,207 --> 00:45:01,177
You have to save it for
more appropriate occasions.

1039
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:04,844
Like after the first
time you guys have sex.

1040
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,247
Or when you wanna forgive
her for cheating on you.

1041
00:45:18,244 --> 00:45:23,244
(tires screeching)
(people chattering)

1042
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:26,381
- [Woman] Vow, you know it is.

1043
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:28,532
Chapter four is planting the seed.

1044
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:30,784
(women giggling)

1045
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:32,779
- Don't you guys think she
just looks beautiful today?

1046
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:33,703
- Oh my gosh.
- You do.

1047
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:34,624
- Oh, she does.
- All the glow.

1048
00:45:34,624 --> 00:45:36,832
- You know, I love the title of your book,

1049
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:39,997
"Growing Your Garden
And Managing Your Man.

1050
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:41,613
- That's great.
- That's great.

1051
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,446
- [Woman] I'll tell you what.

1052
00:45:42,446 --> 00:45:43,607
- Oh, how amazing Janet?

1053
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,858
Your first house, your first baby,

1054
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:48,146
your first book, all in the same year.

1055
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,707
- Oh, I'll tell what,

1056
00:45:49,707 --> 00:45:51,915
I could not have done it without my Irwin.

1057
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:52,748
- [Women] Aww.

1058
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:54,629
- He is just the best husband
I ever could have hoped for.

1059
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:58,434
I mean, he is always
unwavering in his support.

1060
00:45:58,434 --> 00:45:59,267
- [Woman] How sweet.

1061
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:01,469
- He is always unconditional in his love,

1062
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:03,893
and he is always out of town on business.

1063
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:05,520
(women squealing)

1064
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,064
- You are so bad!

1065
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,981
(women chattering)

1066
00:46:11,222 --> 00:46:12,849
- Here's to all you.

1067
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:14,182
- Oh, group hug.

1068
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:16,162
- Oh!

1069
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:19,928
(doorbell ringing)

1070
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:21,095
- I'll get it.

1071
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:25,542
(women clearing their throats)

1072
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:27,948
- [Woman] So Kate, uh,
what's with your friend?

1073
00:46:27,948 --> 00:46:29,501
- Yeah, she seems so distant.

1074
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:30,542
- [Woman] So removed.

1075
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:32,044
- [Woman] So depressed.

1076
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:33,495
- She must be from New York.

1077
00:46:33,495 --> 00:46:36,094
- Oh, just lay off her, all right?

1078
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:38,532
I just wanted her to meet some people.

1079
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:40,825
I had to practically drag her here.

1080
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:41,866
- Roses for you, Jenna.

1081
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:44,283
- Oh!
- Bring them over here.

1082
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,333
Oh my.

1083
00:46:49,387 --> 00:46:50,925
Oh, could you set them there?

1084
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:52,508
Thank you, darlin'.

1085
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:55,260
- Oh, they must be from Irwin.

1086
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,018
How romantic.

1087
00:46:57,018 --> 00:46:59,455
- He is such a sweetheart.

1088
00:46:59,455 --> 00:47:01,372
I miss your smile.
- Oh!

1089
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:04,619
- Love, Robert Landler?

1090
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:05,452
(women gasping)

1091
00:47:05,452 --> 00:47:06,397
- Robert Landler?

1092
00:47:06,397 --> 00:47:07,533
Oh my.
- Oh.

1093
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,245
- While the wolfs away,
the lamb will play.

1094
00:47:09,245 --> 00:47:10,078
- [Woman] Uh-huh.

1095
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:11,669
- [Janet] Well now wait,
wait a minute here.

1096
00:47:11,669 --> 00:47:13,682
This card isn't addressed to me.

1097
00:47:13,682 --> 00:47:14,587
- [Woman] What?

1098
00:47:14,587 --> 00:47:17,522
- Well these flowers aren't for me.

1099
00:47:17,522 --> 00:47:19,834
They're for you, Maggie.

1100
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:21,428
- Oh!
- What?

1101
00:47:21,428 --> 00:47:23,254
- [Woman] Somebody made
themselves a fast friend.

1102
00:47:23,254 --> 00:47:25,199
- That Bobby Landler is
quiet the lady killer.

1103
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,132
- You should know Carrie Kay.

1104
00:47:28,132 --> 00:47:29,398
- How did he even know?

1105
00:47:29,398 --> 00:47:30,231
Kate.

1106
00:47:31,508 --> 00:47:32,341
Kate,

1107
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:36,952
could I please you in the
kitchen alone for just a second?

1108
00:47:36,952 --> 00:47:37,786
- Okay.

1109
00:47:37,786 --> 00:47:41,703
(women clearing their throats)

1110
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:43,480
- They sure are nice roses.

1111
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,640
(women giggling)

1112
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,979
- [Woman] Yes, they are lovely.

1113
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:48,788
- Janet should get to keep
them, don't you think?

1114
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:50,597
I mean, after all, they
did come to her house.

1115
00:47:50,597 --> 00:47:51,706
- Yes, yes.
- Definitely.

1116
00:47:51,706 --> 00:47:52,539
- You're right.

1117
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:53,451
I mean, I don't know.

1118
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:54,613
- Most definitely.
- Yes.

1119
00:47:54,613 --> 00:47:55,446
- I think.

1120
00:47:55,446 --> 00:47:56,422
- You should have called him sooner.

1121
00:47:56,422 --> 00:47:58,420
I mean, after all he is
a very eligible bachelor.

1122
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,591
- I don't care if he's the most
eligible guy on the planet.

1123
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:03,847
He's not this woman's Mr. Right?

1124
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,110
(Kate giggles)

1125
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,865
- Mr. Right?

1126
00:48:06,865 --> 00:48:10,068
You're still holding out for him?

1127
00:48:10,068 --> 00:48:14,210
What if Robert turns out to be Mr. Close?

1128
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,530
- Mr. Close?

1129
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,908
This guy isn't even
Mr. Remote Possibility.

1130
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:22,636
I appreciate what you're
trying to do for me.

1131
00:48:22,636 --> 00:48:23,636
I really do.

1132
00:48:24,998 --> 00:48:28,136
I'm having dinner with someone tonight,

1133
00:48:28,136 --> 00:48:31,999
and I'm really looking forward to it.

1134
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,818
I just think I'd enjoy it a lot more

1135
00:48:33,818 --> 00:48:35,610
if I didn't have to
worry about being stalked

1136
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,965
by Dionysus himself.

1137
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:39,442
- Well, I'll help you set Robert straight.

1138
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:40,300
I'll give him a call

1139
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,185
and I'll just tell him
to quit bothering you.

1140
00:48:43,185 --> 00:48:44,375
- It's gonna take a lot more than that

1141
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,312
to stop Robert Landler.

1142
00:48:45,312 --> 00:48:46,145
(gun cocking)

1143
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:48,067
He should know by now not to ever,

1144
00:48:48,067 --> 00:48:51,206
ever mess with Southern women.

1145
00:48:51,206 --> 00:48:52,280
- Oh my God.

1146
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,786
- Slob Landler sent me
those same roses in 1993.

1147
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:57,746
- I got 'em in '91.

1148
00:48:57,746 --> 00:48:59,829
- '87, and again, in '94.

1149
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:04,665
- You set me up with this guy?

1150
00:49:04,665 --> 00:49:05,842
- Oops.

1151
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,378
- So let's go kick his ass.

1152
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,758
- [Women] Let's kick his ass!

1153
00:49:08,758 --> 00:49:11,089
- Settle down, settle down, girls.

1154
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:12,339
Thanks, but no.

1155
00:49:13,682 --> 00:49:16,277
I must face him, alone.

1156
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:18,185
- [Woman] Ah, shit.

1157
00:49:18,185 --> 00:49:21,783
- [Robert] I'll be down
in just a second, sugar.

1158
00:49:21,783 --> 00:49:24,366
- Oh, what a colossal jackass.

1159
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:29,075
- Well, this is a nice surprise.

1160
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:34,361
Well, sit down.

1161
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:36,204
Take a load off, stay a while.

1162
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:37,037
- Thanks.

1163
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,444
- God, I don't know what I'm thinking

1164
00:49:44,444 --> 00:49:47,056
trying to tie my tie
with a drink in my hand.

1165
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:51,723
- Well, something tells me
if anyone can do it, you can.

1166
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,227
- I'll be done with this
wedding about 10:30.

1167
00:49:55,227 --> 00:49:58,114
Why don't you let me
buy a dinner afterwards?

1168
00:49:58,114 --> 00:49:59,715
- I'll have to take a rain check.

1169
00:49:59,715 --> 00:50:01,691
- How about tomorrow?

1170
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,249
We can go down to the
river, have a little sail-

1171
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:05,092
- Shut up a second, Robert.

1172
00:50:05,092 --> 00:50:06,338
- Sure.

1173
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:08,317
Anything you want, precious.

1174
00:50:08,317 --> 00:50:11,717
- It's become clear to
me, don't ask me how,

1175
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:16,467
that you like me, oh, just a
little more than I like you.

1176
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:19,878
- Oh, what do you want?

1177
00:50:19,878 --> 00:50:21,379
No relationship ever attains

1178
00:50:21,379 --> 00:50:23,649
a perfect equilibrium of affection.

1179
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:25,526
You ought to know that.

1180
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:26,926
We did sleep together, didn't we?

1181
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:28,410
That oughta count for something.

1182
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:29,577
- Yes, we did.

1183
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,456
And I think it was a mistake.

1184
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,816
No scratch that, I know it was a mistake.

1185
00:50:39,026 --> 00:50:41,634
- Maggie, I admit I'm not perfect.

1186
00:50:41,634 --> 00:50:45,115
But if there's one thing my
life experience has taught me,

1187
00:50:45,115 --> 00:50:47,402
it's you have to be willing
to make certain sacrifices

1188
00:50:47,402 --> 00:50:49,723
to make relationships work.

1189
00:50:49,723 --> 00:50:52,428
So if there's anything I can do,

1190
00:50:52,428 --> 00:50:54,721
anything I can change in my life

1191
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,690
to make you feel more
comfortable around me,

1192
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,370
to feel more compatible with me,

1193
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,115
I don't care what it is.

1194
00:51:03,115 --> 00:51:06,736
You just say the word and I'll do it.

1195
00:51:06,736 --> 00:51:09,091
- Well, now that you mention it,

1196
00:51:09,091 --> 00:51:11,310
I did have something in mind.

1197
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,393
- What is it?

1198
00:51:14,106 --> 00:51:16,122
- I think-
- My clothes.

1199
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:18,392
- No, actually it's not your clothes.

1200
00:51:18,392 --> 00:51:19,433
- My car?

1201
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:21,003
That's what it is.

1202
00:51:21,003 --> 00:51:26,003
I admit, it's not too PC to
be driving a $80,000 BMW.

1203
00:51:26,158 --> 00:51:27,351
Tell you what I'll do.

1204
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:28,701
First thing tomorrow morning,

1205
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:32,677
I'll traded in for a Taurus, a used one.

1206
00:51:32,677 --> 00:51:33,855
- It's not your car.

1207
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:35,556
- Well, what is it then, my hair?

1208
00:51:35,556 --> 00:51:36,872
It's real, I swear to God.

1209
00:51:36,872 --> 00:51:38,255
Give it a tug.

1210
00:51:38,255 --> 00:51:39,838
- Drinking, Robert.

1211
00:51:41,426 --> 00:51:43,592
You drink too much.

1212
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:46,610
I haven't seen you yet
without a drink in your hand.

1213
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:50,443
Quit drinking and we
just might have a future.

1214
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,073
- I see.

1215
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:00,852
Sorry.

1216
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:13,108
Well, look at that.

1217
00:52:16,287 --> 00:52:19,787
Bobby Landler without a drink in his hand.

1218
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:27,542
You know you're right, Maggie.

1219
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:30,008
- I am?

1220
00:52:30,008 --> 00:52:33,899
- Yeah, I do need to make
some changes in my life.

1221
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:34,975
- Are you sure?

1222
00:52:34,975 --> 00:52:37,206
- Oh, most definitely.

1223
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:42,206
And I'm gonna start by
doing a little redecorating.

1224
00:52:42,221 --> 00:52:43,054
- Huh?

1225
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:45,275
- Leave.

1226
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,343
(Maggie sighs)

1227
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:02,623
(speaking in France)

1228
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,946
(bottle popping)

1229
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:22,946
(pleasant music)
(people chattering)

1230
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:28,275
- Oh, it is so wonderful to see you.

1231
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:29,385
- How are you, my boy?

1232
00:53:29,385 --> 00:53:30,443
- Good, good.

1233
00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:32,009
Can't complain.

1234
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:33,528
- Oh!

1235
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:36,746
Thank God, you're still single.

1236
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,849
- Don't mind Eddie. (laughs)

1237
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,590
Have you seen Bridget yet?

1238
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,955
- No, no, not yet.

1239
00:53:41,955 --> 00:53:43,112
But she told me she was gonna be here.

1240
00:53:43,112 --> 00:53:45,513
- She's dying to see you.

1241
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,728
I'll just go get her.

1242
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:49,061
- Uh, bring her back alone.

1243
00:53:53,103 --> 00:53:55,770
So, how's work treating ya, son?

1244
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,110
- Great, great.

1245
00:53:59,110 --> 00:53:59,943
The kids are wonderful.

1246
00:53:59,943 --> 00:54:02,079
And the school's brought
in some solid new teachers.

1247
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,281
- Oh, that's good, solid is good.

1248
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,131
You're a solid fellow.

1249
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:05,444
(Pat burps)

1250
00:54:05,444 --> 00:54:06,277
- Another.

1251
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:10,682
An open bar's worst enemy.

1252
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:12,263
Come on, set me up.

1253
00:54:12,263 --> 00:54:13,607
- Carter?

1254
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:15,079
Oh my God.
- Bridgette.

1255
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:16,923
- How are you?
- Wow.

1256
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:19,673
Gosh, I haven't seen you since...

1257
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:22,096
You look great.

1258
00:54:23,286 --> 00:54:24,286
- So do you.

1259
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:29,376
Anything to drink?

1260
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,006
- Uh, nothing for me,

1261
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:35,839
but bring her a Southern
Comfort on the rocks.

1262
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:40,727
- This is a pretty fancy soiree, huh?

1263
00:54:40,727 --> 00:54:41,560
- Oh, I'll say.

1264

doubles my net worth.

1265

altar anytime soon, or?

1281
00:55:35,302 --> 00:55:36,385

1296
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:06,391

01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,713
You Southern boys really
know how to flatter a girl.

1430
01:03:32,713 --> 01:03:34,722
- Well just, just, no, hold on a second.

1431
01:03:34,722 --> 01:03:37,305
Let, hear me out on this, okay?

1432
01:03:38,305 --> 01:03:39,993
I'm 31 years old.

1433
01:03:39,993 --> 01:03:42,488
I've gone out on dozens of first dates

1434
01:03:42,488 --> 01:03:45,217
and I've always followed
the same nice routine.

1435
01:03:45,217 --> 01:03:46,735
I wash my car.

1436
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:49,280
I show up on time with flowers,

1437
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,567
spring for a candlelight dinner.

1438
01:03:51,567 --> 01:03:54,400
I drink responsibly and then boom,

1439
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,864
I'm walking her to her doorstep

1440
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:57,558
and before I can kiss her goodnight,

1441
01:03:57,558 --> 01:04:00,300
she's telling me what a
wonderful time she had,

1442
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,349
that I'm a great guy,

1443
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:05,521
but we can't be anything
more than just friends.

1444
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:07,879
And we both know what that means.

1445
01:04:07,879 --> 01:04:09,602
- Not interested.
- Exactly.

1446
01:04:09,602 --> 01:04:11,833
- So here I am a few hours back

1447
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:14,516
and I start up the same routine.

1448
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:15,898
And then I get to thinking,

1449
01:04:15,898 --> 01:04:18,953
at this point in my life
I have plenty of friends.

1450
01:04:18,953 --> 01:04:20,932
I, I don't need anymore.

1451
01:04:20,932 --> 01:04:23,237
So, at considerable risk,

1452
01:04:23,237 --> 01:04:26,663
I'm not taking you out on my standard,

1453
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:30,132
nice, sweet, kind, romance 101 first date

1454
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,882
because I have no desire, Maggie,

1455
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:35,248
zero, none,

1456
01:04:37,734 --> 01:04:40,067
to be just friends with you.

1457
01:04:44,622 --> 01:04:47,694
- So what do you want, Carter?

1458
01:04:47,694 --> 01:04:50,459
You figure if you insult me by being late,

1459
01:04:50,459 --> 01:04:53,121
threaten my gastrointestinal integrity

1460
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:54,982
by taking me out for bar food

1461
01:04:54,982 --> 01:04:56,927
and brainwash me with country music,

1462
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,946
that you might get lucky tonight.

1463
01:04:59,946 --> 01:05:01,029
- What, what?

1464
01:05:02,994 --> 01:05:05,161
- Maybe there's somebody out there

1465
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:10,093
who would have appreciated
flowers on a first date

1466
01:05:10,093 --> 01:05:11,422
'cause she hasn't gotten flowers like that

1467
01:05:11,422 --> 01:05:12,922
since high school.

1468
01:05:14,187 --> 01:05:15,554
Maybe she would've loved the fact

1469
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:19,721
that you picked her up on
time and in a clean car.

1470
01:05:21,165 --> 01:05:25,368
That you went to the trouble
to find a nice restaurant

1471
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:28,679
and that you didn't get fallen down drunk.

1472
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:31,000
So you not only get her home safely,

1473
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,263
but remember the good night kiss

1474
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:34,652
she's been dreaming of giving you

1475
01:05:34,652 --> 01:05:38,235
since the first time she laid eyes on you.

1476
01:05:40,756 --> 01:05:44,223
- Are, are you trying to
say that that person is you?

1477
01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:46,681
- How will you ever know now,

1478
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:50,157
since you've reduced this first
date to some sort of game?

1479
01:05:50,157 --> 01:05:54,356
- Whoa, whoa, I think you've
got the wrong idea here.

1480
01:05:54,356 --> 01:05:57,541
I, I can assure you, I do not play games.

1481
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:58,374
- I should have known better

1482
01:05:58,374 --> 01:06:00,429
than a fall for your nice guy rap.

1483
01:06:00,429 --> 01:06:01,432
- Rap?

1484
01:06:01,432 --> 01:06:03,142
This is not a rap, okay?

1485
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:06,518
A rap implies a scheme that's
successful on a regular basis

1486
01:06:06,518 --> 01:06:08,771
and believe me, it's not-

1487
01:06:08,771 --> 01:06:09,659
- Excuse me.

1488
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:11,997
Y'all mind if I join you?

1489
01:06:11,997 --> 01:06:13,038
- Do I know you?

1490
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:15,393
- I don't think we've
been formally introduced,

1491
01:06:15,393 --> 01:06:19,148
but I did happen to overhear
some of your discussion,

1492
01:06:19,148 --> 01:06:22,645
and I thought maybe I might
provide some assistance.

1493
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,916
- This is a really nice touch, Carter.

1494
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:25,749
I'm almost impressed.

1495
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:27,220
- Wait, I did not set this up.

1496
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,887
- Kids, kids, relax.

1497
01:06:30,412 --> 01:06:33,142
I'm here to represent your best interests.

1498
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:35,617
I am here to protect you.

1499
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:38,757
Now if we get started, this
shouldn't take too awful long.

1500
01:06:38,757 --> 01:06:40,666
- What shouldn't take too awful long?

1501
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:43,123
- Drawing up your
pre-relationship agreement.

1502
01:06:43,123 --> 01:06:44,027
- Pre what?

1503
01:06:44,027 --> 01:06:45,496
- Pre-relationship agreement.

1504
01:06:45,496 --> 01:06:48,226
Y'all heard of pre-nuptial agreements?

1505
01:06:48,226 --> 01:06:51,554
Well, same concept, only
a bit more cautious.

1506
01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:53,841
- Wow, that is just super.

1507
01:06:53,841 --> 01:06:55,928
Carter honey, why don't
you just take me home?

1508
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:56,761
You know what?

1509
01:06:56,761 --> 01:06:57,594
Don't sweat dinner,

1510
01:06:57,594 --> 01:06:58,658
'cause I still have time to order a pizza.

1511
01:06:58,658 --> 01:07:00,843
Thank you so much, sir, for everything.

1512
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:02,055
- Young lady,

1513
01:07:02,055 --> 01:07:04,850
before you condemn the
merits of this agreement,

1514
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,021
might I point out to you

1515
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:10,858
that you have reached a
level of cynicism so severe

1516
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:13,831
that rather embrace this
young man's honesty,

1517
01:07:13,831 --> 01:07:18,831
you casually dismiss it as some
sort of ploy to seduce you.

1518
01:07:18,939 --> 01:07:20,688
As for you son,

1519
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:23,692
what could possibly have
crawled up inside your head

1520
01:07:23,692 --> 01:07:26,047
and possessed you to
abandon the philosophy

1521
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:30,073
by which you have lived your entire life?

1522
01:07:30,073 --> 01:07:31,679
Maybe it'll turn out that the two of you

1523
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:33,983
are really not right for each other,

1524
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,918
but wouldn't you rather
arrive at that determination

1525
01:07:36,918 --> 01:07:39,251
based on who you really are?

1526
01:07:40,673 --> 01:07:43,861
Now, before God takes me from this planet,

1527
01:07:43,861 --> 01:07:45,859
let's get on with it.

1528
01:07:45,859 --> 01:07:47,722
Paragraph one.

1529
01:07:47,722 --> 01:07:49,817
"At the commencement
of said relationship,"

1530
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:52,974
"each party agrees to fully
disclose any current marriages,"

1531
01:07:52,974 --> 01:07:55,124
"dependent children,
bizarre religious beliefs,"

1532
01:07:55,124 --> 01:07:57,308
"phobias, fears, social diseases,"

1533
01:07:57,308 --> 01:07:58,803
"strange political affiliations,"

1534
01:07:58,803 --> 01:08:01,378
"or currently active
relationships with anyone else"

1535
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:03,736
"that have not yet been terminated."

1536
01:08:03,736 --> 01:08:04,995
"Failure to make these disclosures"

1537
01:08:04,995 --> 01:08:08,596
"will result in immediate
termination of said relationship"

1538
01:08:08,596 --> 01:08:13,346
"before it has a chance to,
quote, get anywhere, unquote"

1539
01:08:14,985 --> 01:08:16,649
- I'll be damned.

1540
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:18,867
That actually looks pretty good.

1541
01:08:18,867 --> 01:08:21,068
- I'll take it this is
your first experience

1542
01:08:21,068 --> 01:08:22,818
with the sweet daddy?

1543
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,396
You're in for treat.

1544
01:08:27,396 --> 01:08:29,256
♪ She kicked my dog ♪

1545
01:08:29,256 --> 01:08:31,253
♪ And slammed the door ♪

1546
01:08:31,253 --> 01:08:34,632
♪ Stole my heart and my brand new Ford ♪

1547
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:36,769
- Paragraph nine.

1548
01:08:36,769 --> 01:08:37,780
"For the first 60 days,"

1549
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:42,530
"Both parties agree never to
use the phrase, I love you."

1550
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:47,627
"Now y'all may love plants,
dogs, cats, cars, concerts,"

1551
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:50,409
"or the way of particular
pair of jeans fits,"

1552
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:52,159
"but not each other."

1553
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:56,741
Am I making myself clear, young lady?

1554
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:58,651
- I'm listening, I was
just resting my eyes.

1555
01:08:58,651 --> 01:09:00,355
- Maggie, why don't you
let me take you home?

1556
01:09:00,355 --> 01:09:03,345
- Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh, in a minute.

1557
01:09:03,345 --> 01:09:04,864
I would like to hear the paragraph

1558
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:07,797
on grounds for termination.

1559
01:09:07,797 --> 01:09:10,104
- [Lawyer] Why that would be paragraph 10.

1560
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:15,104
♪ But I was drunk the day
my mom got outta prison ♪

1561
01:09:19,273 --> 01:09:24,273
♪ And I went to pick her up in the rain ♪

1562
01:09:28,548 --> 01:09:33,548
♪ But before I could get to the
station in the pickup truck ♪

1563
01:09:41,654 --> 01:09:42,821
- Look Maggie,

1564
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:47,500
well.

1565
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:52,610
- You wanna know how I
win at the track, Carter?

1566
01:09:54,549 --> 01:09:56,549
I don't look at speed figures

1567
01:09:56,549 --> 01:10:00,884
or recent workouts or
previous performances.

1568
01:10:00,884 --> 01:10:02,164
I don't pay attention to anything

1569
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,497
that's happened in the past.

1570
01:10:05,422 --> 01:10:08,035
- Well, what do you look at?

1571
01:10:08,035 --> 01:10:09,118
- The horses.

1572
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:12,899
I look at their eyes.

1573
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:15,595
How confidently they walk.

1574
01:10:15,595 --> 01:10:19,066
How comfortable they are with our jockey.

1575
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:23,303
- How do you know which
one's to, to bet on?

1576
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,803
- I just go with the one that feels right.

1577
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,657
Don't bother walking me
to the door now, Carter.

1578
01:10:33,657 --> 01:10:35,980
You wouldn't wanna wind
up with another friend,

1579
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,147
now would you?

1580
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:41,113
(melancholy music)

1581
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:51,246
- Did I ever show you my tongue trick?

1582
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:54,758
- I love you, but I'm
not in love with you.

1583
01:10:54,758 --> 01:10:58,121
- Just listen to some of
these satisfied clients.

1584
01:10:58,121 --> 01:10:58,954
- [Carter] Oh God.

1585
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:00,337
- You know, when a guy says, "Trust me,"

1586
01:11:00,337 --> 01:11:02,623
I'm sorry, but that's just
not good enough anymore.

1587
01:11:02,623 --> 01:11:04,859
You know, I'm gonna need a polygraph test.

1588
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:06,514
I'm gonna need a handwriting sample.

1589
01:11:06,514 --> 01:11:09,097
I might even need a urinalysis.

1590
01:11:19,116 --> 01:11:22,033
(pounding on door)

1591
01:11:26,852 --> 01:11:28,165
- It's freaking midnight.

1592
01:11:28,165 --> 01:11:29,498
What's going on?

1593
01:11:34,191 --> 01:11:37,280
Whoa, Erin, what is, what is wrong?

1594
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,227
- Chris dumped me.

1595
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:41,372
- You fucking believe this bullshit?

1596
01:11:41,372 --> 01:11:42,908
- I'm stunned.

1597
01:11:42,908 --> 01:11:43,741
- What?

1598
01:11:43,741 --> 01:11:44,646
- Well you treated him like shit.

1599
01:11:44,646 --> 01:11:45,570
What do you expect?

1600
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,772
- Oh, well I appreciate your sympathy.

1601
01:11:47,772 --> 01:11:48,605
Sorry to bother you.

1602
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:49,914
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here.

1603
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:53,622
Sorry, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1604
01:11:53,622 --> 01:11:55,036
- He didn't even have the
decency to do it in person.

1605
01:11:55,036 --> 01:11:56,828
The fucking prick did it over the phone.

1606
01:11:56,828 --> 01:11:57,715
- You wanna talk about it?

1607
01:11:57,715 --> 01:11:58,650
- No.

1608
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,412
- You wanna sit down?
- No.

1609
01:12:00,412 --> 01:12:02,829
- Do you, do you wanna?
- No.

1610
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:10,239
- We were supposed to go out,

1611
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,129
only at the last minute,

1612
01:12:11,129 --> 01:12:12,611
someone else called me
to see if I wanted to go

1613
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:14,501
to the Alanis Morissette
set concert, you know?

1614
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:16,840
So I, so I called Chris and I told,

1615
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,109
I, I mean, I, I asked him if it was okay

1616
01:12:19,109 --> 01:12:20,407
if we just went out to
dinner tomorrow night

1617
01:12:20,407 --> 01:12:21,585
so I could go to the concert tonight,

1618
01:12:21,585 --> 01:12:23,496
and he says that that
won't really work for him

1619
01:12:23,496 --> 01:12:26,483
because he's breaking up
with me as of tomorrow night.

1620
01:12:26,483 --> 01:12:28,069
- Ouch.

1621
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:29,726
- Yeah, so I told him to go to hell

1622
01:12:29,726 --> 01:12:31,091
and I called the other guy.

1623
01:12:31,091 --> 01:12:33,287
- Oh, the Alanis Morissette guy.

1624
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:35,301
- Yeah, I called him back and he said

1625
01:12:35,301 --> 01:12:37,823
that he already gave the
ticket to someone else.

1626
01:12:37,823 --> 01:12:39,806
So not only did I get dumped,

1627
01:12:39,806 --> 01:12:43,389
but I didn't even get
to go to the concert.

1628
01:12:44,685 --> 01:12:47,185
I'm such a dumb fucking loser.

1629
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:49,586
- Oh, come on.

1630
01:12:49,586 --> 01:12:50,419
Come here, shh.

1631
01:12:50,419 --> 01:12:52,445
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

1632
01:12:52,445 --> 01:12:54,195
Don't worry about it.

1633
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:58,670
Look, you're better off without him.

1634
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:03,253
I mean heck, the guy couldn't
even hook up your stereo.

1635
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:05,738
- I want you.

1636
01:13:09,506 --> 01:13:11,423
I've always wanted you.

1637
01:13:14,655 --> 01:13:15,488
- Um.

1638
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,956
- Make love to me.

1639
01:13:18,956 --> 01:13:19,789
- No.

1640
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:21,683
- Please?

1641
01:13:23,288 --> 01:13:24,121
- No.

1642
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:26,840
- Pretty please?

1643
01:13:27,759 --> 01:13:28,592
- No.

1644
01:13:31,188 --> 01:13:33,855
- I'm not wearing any underwear.

1645
01:13:35,047 --> 01:13:37,714
(sensual music)

1646
01:13:58,954 --> 01:14:02,620
(water squelching)

1647
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,931
(water splashing)

1648
01:14:03,931 --> 01:14:05,681
- No, no, no, no, no.

1649
01:14:07,191 --> 01:14:09,410
We can't do this.

1650
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,243
- Why?

1651
01:14:10,243 --> 01:14:11,705
- You're upset,

1652
01:14:11,705 --> 01:14:14,202
and I would be taking
advantage of you, okay?

1653
01:14:14,202 --> 01:14:15,720
Because we're friends,

1654
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,107
and sleeping with you would change that.

1655
01:14:17,107 --> 01:14:17,940
It would change everything.

1656
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,029
- Shit.

1657
01:14:19,029 --> 01:14:21,519
Carter, it's just sex.

1658
01:14:21,519 --> 01:14:23,330
You have the whole rest of
your life to be monogamous.

1659
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,965
- That's just it, Erin.

1660
01:14:25,965 --> 01:14:29,042
I'm ready for the whole
rest of my life to begin.

1661
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:31,416
I want to be in love with
the next person I sleep with.

1662
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:32,610
I want the next person I sleep with

1663
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:35,016
to be the last person I sleep with.

1664
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:37,219
- No guy hopes for that.

1665
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:38,552
- This one does.

1666
01:14:41,516 --> 01:14:43,462
- This is not happening.

1667
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:46,962
I, turned down by three guys in one night?

1668
01:14:48,528 --> 01:14:49,861
- You should go.

1669
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:51,531
- Yeah.

1670
01:15:02,884 --> 01:15:07,634
- This has gotta go down as
the stupidest day in history.

1671
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,923

- [Maggie] Yeah.

1686
01:16:34,921 --> 01:16:36,838
- What's troubling you?

1687
01:16:38,369 --> 01:16:41,452
- It's reasonably complicated, Rufus.

1688
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:43,914
- What's his name?

1689
01:16:48,902 --> 01:16:49,735
- Carter.

1690
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:51,990
- Hm.

1691
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:54,140
Well what's he done to you?

1692
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:57,381
- It's not what he did to me.

1693
01:16:57,381 --> 01:16:59,298
It's what I did to him.

1694
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:07,268
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this guy,

1695
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:12,085
this perfect person,

1696
01:17:14,621 --> 01:17:19,121
and it dawned on me that
I've set my standard so high,

1697
01:17:21,702 --> 01:17:24,202
it'd be impossible for anyone.

1698
01:17:25,783 --> 01:17:28,700
Even the supposed man of my dreams,

1699
01:17:29,759 --> 01:17:33,009
could never live up to my expectations.

1700
01:17:34,469 --> 01:17:38,344
- You have any idea how many
folks there are in this world?

1701
01:17:38,344 --> 01:17:41,023
(Maggie laughs)

1702
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,679
- Billions?

1703
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:46,553
- Well, when you start courting,
especially in this town,

1704
01:17:46,553 --> 01:17:47,986
there probably aren't so many.

1705
01:17:47,986 --> 01:17:51,755
In fact, I'll bet there
are only six or so.

1706
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:54,318
- (laughs) Six?

1707
01:17:54,318 --> 01:17:57,764
- Maybe seven, but they
all know each other,

1708
01:17:57,764 --> 01:18:00,035
so word gets around fast.

1709
01:18:00,035 --> 01:18:02,305
Now, if you try to act

1710
01:18:02,305 --> 01:18:05,101
in a somewhat decent
manner towards other folks,

1711
01:18:05,101 --> 01:18:06,740
even if that person
sitting across from you

1712
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,568
ain't right for you,

1713
01:18:08,568 --> 01:18:11,485
maybe they'll know somebody who is.

1714
01:18:12,579 --> 01:18:14,252
And if I was you,

1715
01:18:14,252 --> 01:18:18,002
I'd give this Carter
fella a call, but quick.

1716
01:18:19,951 --> 01:18:21,437
- Why would I wanna go and do that?

1717
01:18:21,437 --> 01:18:22,270
- Well,

1718
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:24,850
it's obvious he's gotten
under your skin pretty good.

1719
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,130
- No he hasn't.

1720
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:28,366
- Now Maggie.
- Really.

1721
01:18:28,366 --> 01:18:30,360
- Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

1722
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,626
Don't you know you can't shit a shitter?

1723
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:34,794
- I'm not trying to shit you.

1724
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:36,480
- Well, let's see.

1725
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,856
One, it's a gorgeous Sunday afternoon

1726
01:18:38,856 --> 01:18:39,723
and you've come to work

1727
01:18:39,723 --> 01:18:42,556
even though there ain't
a sick horse on the farm.

1728
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:45,730
Two, the radio in your office
is playing country music.

1729
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:49,161
Three, your shirt's on backwards.

1730
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:52,203
Four-
- Okay, you made your point.

1731
01:18:52,203 --> 01:18:56,031
- [Rufus] Good, I didn't have a four.

1732
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:59,371
(trumpets blaring)

1733
01:18:59,371 --> 01:19:01,521
- [Announcer] The horses are
moving toward the starting gate

1734
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:03,638
for the eighth race
here at Churchill Downs.

1735
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,771
The eighth race, named The Winston Rule.

1736
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:07,034
- Hey man, sorry I'm late.

1737
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:08,451
- Don't sweat it.

1738
01:19:10,068 --> 01:19:12,543
- Who'd you bet this race?
- Number five.

1739
01:19:12,543 --> 01:19:14,489
- The horses have reached
the starting gate.

1740
01:19:14,489 --> 01:19:15,885
It's now post time.

1741
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:18,468
- Shit, too late for me to bet.

1742
01:19:19,591 --> 01:19:21,196
Five?

1743
01:19:21,196 --> 01:19:22,817
Fiasco?

1744
01:19:22,817 --> 01:19:24,592
Christ, she sucks.

1745
01:19:24,592 --> 01:19:26,299
She doesn't wanna race it over a year.

1746
01:19:26,299 --> 01:19:28,020
She's 50-1.

1747
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:32,440
- Yeah, well something
about her just feels right.

1748
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,273
- What?

1749
01:19:39,113 --> 01:19:39,946
Oh no.

1750
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,450
Oh, sheep cock.

1751
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:45,858
Not last night?

1752
01:19:46,929 --> 01:19:48,498
- Bad.

1753
01:19:48,498 --> 01:19:49,711
- Worst ever?

1754
01:19:49,711 --> 01:19:52,575
- No, she didn't throw up.

1755
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,959
- [Announcer] They're at the post.

1756
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:56,292
And they're off!

1757
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,864
For the lead from the inside-

1758
01:19:58,864 --> 01:20:01,332
- Where'd you take her?

1759
01:20:01,332 --> 01:20:03,145
- You don't remember?

1760
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:04,234
- Why should I?

1761
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:05,984
I didn't go with you.

1762
01:20:07,195 --> 01:20:08,119
Did I?

1763
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:09,925
- [Announcer] Don't Dog Me is eighth,

1764
01:20:09,925 --> 01:20:11,580
followed by What The Fuck,

1765
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,703
then Key Speed late,
and the trailer, Fiasco.

1766
01:20:14,703 --> 01:20:16,529
- She at least like your sweet daddy?

1767
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:18,133
- Not enough to wanna see me again.

1768
01:20:18,133 --> 01:20:19,106
- [Pat] Even as a friend?

1769
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:19,960
- Even as a friend.

1770
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,598
- Hey, that's progress.

1771
01:20:21,598 --> 01:20:23,831
- It doesn't feel like progress, Pat.

1772
01:20:23,831 --> 01:20:25,507
It feels like a mistake.

1773
01:20:25,507 --> 01:20:26,936
I feel like I gave up on being myself

1774
01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:29,956
on the one night I didn't need to.

1775
01:20:29,956 --> 01:20:31,287
- I don't care if you took her out

1776
01:20:31,287 --> 01:20:33,846
on the best day of her life or the worst,

1777
01:20:33,846 --> 01:20:35,825
if she didn't see what a catch you are,

1778
01:20:35,825 --> 01:20:38,078
then she's the one that made the mistake.

1779
01:20:38,078 --> 01:20:39,136
- Thanks.

1780
01:20:39,136 --> 01:20:39,969
- [Announcer] For the stretch.

1781
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:41,489
It's still Went So Well.

1782
01:20:41,489 --> 01:20:43,949
Maybe, round now up on the outside,

1783
01:20:43,949 --> 01:20:45,713
here comes Fiasco!
- Dude, check it out.

1784
01:20:45,713 --> 01:20:47,230
Holy shit, your horse.

1785
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,595
- [Announcer] She's a one shot-

1786
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:50,247
- God, come on!

1787
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:52,140
Fiasco!
- Come on, baby!

1788
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,777
Make a move!
- Yeah!

1789
01:20:53,777 --> 01:20:54,610
Go, go!

1790
01:20:55,634 --> 01:20:57,968
- [Announcer] Outside, Fiasco!

1791
01:20:57,968 --> 01:20:59,477
- Go, come on!
- Go, go!

1792
01:20:59,477 --> 01:21:01,516
- Go, go!
- Run!

1793
01:21:01,516 --> 01:21:02,673
- [Announcer] Went So Well!

1794
01:21:02,673 --> 01:21:03,967
Went So Well wins it by a nose!

1795
01:21:03,967 --> 01:21:04,957
- Shit!

1796
01:21:04,957 --> 01:21:06,212
Monkey piss!

1797
01:21:06,212 --> 01:21:07,879
God damn!
- Son of a-

1798
01:21:08,852 --> 01:21:10,324
- God!

1799
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:11,741
Oh man, so close.

1800
01:21:15,664 --> 01:21:18,481
Wait, hey, you must have
bet her to place, right?

1801
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:20,018
So you still won something.

1802
01:21:20,018 --> 01:21:21,321
- Not exactly.

1803
01:21:21,321 --> 01:21:23,131
- [Announcer] The unofficial
winner of the eighth race

1804
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:24,992
is number two, Went So Well.

1805
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,803
Went So Well is owned by Woody Johnson,

1806
01:21:26,803 --> 01:21:29,209
trained by Benny Woosley, and the rider-

1807
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:30,209
- Oh my God.

1808
01:21:32,741 --> 01:21:34,237
You did it.

1809
01:21:34,237 --> 01:21:36,234
You made the big bet.

1810
01:21:36,234 --> 01:21:38,176
That would've been 25 grand.

1811
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:41,009
Jesus, that would've been awesome.

1812
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:49,032
What now?

1813
01:21:52,615 --> 01:21:54,256
- Credit cards.
- Credit cards.

1814
01:21:54,256 --> 01:21:55,250
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

1815
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,939
please hold all mutual tickets.

1816
01:21:56,939 --> 01:21:59,368
There is a steward's
inquiry into the sprint run

1817
01:21:59,368 --> 01:22:00,201
of the eighth race.
- Awesome.

1818
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:02,417
- No way, they never take down a winner.

1819
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,303
- They are today, baby.

1820
01:22:03,303 --> 01:22:06,855
This has already been the
greatest morning in history.

1821
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:08,681
- Something tells me it involves a woman.

1822
01:22:08,681 --> 01:22:11,718
- Yeah well, I get home
from the wedding last night.

1823
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:13,663
I was pretty snockered.

1824
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:14,746
- Oh, really?

1825
01:22:16,292 --> 01:22:17,880
- Yeah.

1826
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,955
So I pass out.

1827
01:22:18,955 --> 01:22:22,044
Next thing I know somebody's
banging on my door.

1828
01:22:22,044 --> 01:22:26,877
You will never, ever, in a
jillion years guess who it was.

1829
01:22:27,881 --> 01:22:28,714
- Oh no.

1830
01:22:30,558 --> 01:22:31,391
- Erin.

1831
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:34,161
- She was really upset.

1832
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:37,489
That joker she'd been
dating broke up with her.

1833
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:41,406
She just fell into my
arms and I just held her.

1834
01:22:44,896 --> 01:22:47,473
I could tell she hadn't been
held like that in long time.

1835
01:22:47,473 --> 01:22:48,801
You know?

1836
01:22:48,801 --> 01:22:51,993
Next thing I know we're
kissing then, like I said,

1837
01:22:51,993 --> 01:22:56,076
this morning was the
greatest morning in history.

1838
01:22:57,487 --> 01:23:00,984
I'll tell you, man, she
is a wonderful woman.

1839
01:23:00,984 --> 01:23:03,901
Smart, she's ah, beautiful, caring.

1840
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:08,847
I think I'm in love with her.

1841
01:23:08,847 --> 01:23:09,785
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1842
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:12,550
your attention please for
interference in the stretch.

1843
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:16,612
Number two Went So Sell
has been disqualified,

1844
01:23:16,612 --> 01:23:20,227
and number five, Fiasco, has
been moved to the top spot.

1845
01:23:20,227 --> 01:23:21,544
Fiasco, a 50-1 shot-

1846
01:23:21,544 --> 01:23:24,939
(lively music)

1847
01:23:24,939 --> 01:23:25,772
$102.

1848
01:23:27,112 --> 01:23:29,779
(men screaming)

1849
01:23:38,353 --> 01:23:41,596
Now moving into the winners
circle, number five, Fiasco.

1850
01:23:41,596 --> 01:23:42,688
- [Men] Yeah!

1851
01:23:42,688 --> 01:23:45,355
(men screaming)

1852
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:52,377
(phone ringing)

1853
01:23:52,377 --> 01:23:53,231
- Hello?

1854
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:54,836
- Maggie?
- Carter?

1855
01:23:54,836 --> 01:23:55,865
- Hi.

1856
01:23:55,865 --> 01:23:56,901
- Hi.

1857
01:23:56,901 --> 01:23:58,689
- Look, uh, I just wanted to say, uh,

1858
01:23:58,689 --> 01:24:00,110
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1859
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,064
- You're sorry?
- You're sorry?

1860
01:24:01,064 --> 01:24:02,021
- Why should you be sorry?

1861
01:24:02,021 --> 01:24:03,216
- Why should you be sorry?

1862
01:24:03,216 --> 01:24:04,906
- Wait a second.
- Wait, wait a second.

1863
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:05,906
- There, go.

1864
01:24:06,849 --> 01:24:08,063
- No, ladies first.

1865
01:24:08,063 --> 01:24:08,896
- Okay.

1866
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,918
Look, I, I have to be honest with you.

1867
01:24:12,918 --> 01:24:15,670
I was a little nervous last night.

1868
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:18,315
You see, I hate dating.

1869
01:24:18,315 --> 01:24:20,481
- No, no, I hate dating.

1870
01:24:20,481 --> 01:24:22,633
- I hate dating more than you do.

1871
01:24:22,633 --> 01:24:25,329
- Nobody could hate dating more than I do.

1872
01:24:25,329 --> 01:24:28,350
- I'd rather have a root
canal than go out on a date.

1873
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:31,044
- I'd rather have this argument in person.

1874
01:24:31,044 --> 01:24:31,877
If you wanna find out

1875
01:24:31,877 --> 01:24:34,477
why last night may have been
the best bad date in history,

1876
01:24:34,477 --> 01:24:36,764
meet me at Filmworks at 8:30.

1877
01:24:36,764 --> 01:24:38,095
- Filmworks, wait.

1878
01:24:38,095 --> 01:24:40,348
- And don't forget to bring
your copy of our agreement.

1879
01:24:40,348 --> 01:24:43,015
(calming music)

1880
01:24:59,634 --> 01:25:01,750
- You know, where I come from,

1881
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:05,421
we actually watch movies
from inside the theater.

1882
01:25:05,421 --> 01:25:07,942
- Well, I uh never had any intention

1883
01:25:07,942 --> 01:25:09,427
of taking you to the movies,

1884
01:25:09,427 --> 01:25:11,373
but I figured it'd be a
good backup plan for me

1885
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:13,685
in case you didn't show up.

1886
01:25:13,685 --> 01:25:14,935
- No such luck.

1887
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,227
- So what's this about our agreement?

1888
01:25:18,227 --> 01:25:19,977
- Read the last line.

1889
01:25:24,183 --> 01:25:25,873
- "Addendum."

1890
01:25:25,873 --> 01:25:27,050
"No matter what,"

1891
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:30,883
"both parties agree to
give it one more shot."

1892
01:25:33,485 --> 01:25:35,402
- So what do you think?

1893
01:25:36,844 --> 01:25:38,226
- Well I signed it.

1894
01:25:38,226 --> 01:25:39,369
I'm legally bound.

1895
01:25:39,369 --> 01:25:41,671
(Carter chuckles)

1896
01:25:41,671 --> 01:25:44,964
So, why was last night the
best bad date all the time?

1897
01:25:44,964 --> 01:25:46,944
- Mm, well, (laughs)

1898
01:25:46,944 --> 01:25:48,543
let's just say it had something to do

1899
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,662
with a horse named Fiasco.

1900
01:25:50,662 --> 01:25:51,495
- You won?

1901
01:25:51,495 --> 01:25:52,328
- I won big.

1902
01:25:52,328 --> 01:25:53,472
- Oh, fantastic.

1903
01:25:53,472 --> 01:25:54,305
Fiasco.

1904
01:25:54,305 --> 01:25:56,152
- I mean, if the date had been
anything other than a Fiasco,

1905
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:58,834
who knows who I would've bet on?

1906
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:03,834
So I figured the least I could
do was take you to dinner.

1907
01:26:03,982 --> 01:26:07,815
- Sure, as long as we
agree to one more thing.

1908
01:26:09,563 --> 01:26:11,980
We can never be just friends.

1909
01:26:23,797 --> 01:26:26,595
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1910
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:29,512
(couple chuckling)

1911
01:26:31,698 --> 01:26:36,201
You know, someday this dating
thing is gonna be over.

1912
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:37,194
- Oh, you reckon?

1913
01:26:37,194 --> 01:26:38,781
- Oh yes ma'am.

1914
01:26:38,781 --> 01:26:41,222
Someday this dating
thing is gonna be over.

1915
01:26:41,222 --> 01:26:42,984
- These are for you.

1916
01:26:42,984 --> 01:26:43,984
- Thank you.

1917
01:26:45,259 --> 01:26:48,602
No one's ever given me flowers before.

1918
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:50,223
- [Maggie] Regarding last night Carter,

1919
01:26:50,223 --> 01:26:52,101
there was something I
neglected to mention.

1920
01:26:52,101 --> 01:26:53,447
- [Carter] What?

1921
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:57,415
- [Maggie] That was the best
