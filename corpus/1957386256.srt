00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:03,709
(singing in Swahili)

2
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,834
- [Mr. Ross] Three
million years old.

3
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,083
- [Diana] Give or take
a few hundred thousand.

4
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,083
- [Mr. Ross] That makes it

5
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,083
the oldest human
fossil ever found.

6
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,667
- [Diana] If you don't
count my ex-father-in-law.

7
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,709
We call him Adam.

8
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:33,917
- Your father-in-law?

9
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,750
- No, no, this guy.

10
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:36,959
Adam.

11
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,375
The first man?

12
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,625
- Doctor Firestone.

13
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,917
This might be what you
say it is or it might not.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,333
The fact of the matter is,
you only have part of it.

15
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,709
The jawbone is missing.

16
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,208
- Yes, I know that, Mr. Ross.

17
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,250
That's why I've come to you.

18
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,250
With your help, I can
find the rest of it.

19
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,500
- You're sure you haven't
told anybody else about this?

20
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,208
- Cross my heart.

21
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,542
And I'm not going public
until I have it all.

22
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:01,959
That's why I came back
to New York to see you.

23
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,417
- Well, we've gone this
far already, I guess.

24
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,750
All right.

25
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,375
- Oh, Mr. Ross, thank you!

26
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:09,792
Thank you so much!

27
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:12,917
(singing in Swahili)

28
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:52,125
- Welcome back to Africa, Diana.

29
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:56,375
- Thanks for the
lift, Dr. Brinkman.

30
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,750
- Wonderful news
about the grant.

31
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,375
- I thought you agreed
there'd be no publicity.

32
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,375
- Well, I couldn't let a moment

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
like this go unrecorded.

34
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,375
- What did you tell
them it was, a summit?

35
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:09,667
- [Male Reporter] Just a
few more, Dr. Brinkman.

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,542
- Yes.

37
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,250
- [Female Reporter]
Can we get one?

38
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,458
No, please, Dr. Firestone.

39
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,750
- Here we are, Diana!

40
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:28,166
I've managed to get you
all the necessary permits.

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,125
Uh,

42
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,250
now, there we are.

43
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,959
This is, this is where
you'll be digging, isn't it?

44
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,583
- You're close.

45
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,583
- How close?

46
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,375
- You've got the right country.

47
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,542
- Now, now surely,
Diana, you can trust me.

48
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,458
- Surely.

49
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,375
- You're not still angry about
those photographers, are you?

50
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,333
What have you got against
a little publicity?

51
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,375
- Nothing, when I've got
something to publicize.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,041
Can't we just wait til I
find what I'm looking for?

53
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,041
- All right, Diana.

54
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,542
From now on, we'll
do it your way.

55
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,875
Mums the word.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,750
- Dr. Brinkman, the
television people are here.

57
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:06,542
- Oh (laughs).

58
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,375
- Ta-ta, Dr. Brinkman.

59
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,458
- Diana!

60
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,959
You can't leave me alone,

61
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,083
what do I tell the
television people?

62
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:17,583
- That you're having
trouble with your reception.

63
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,709
(singing in Swahili)

64
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,542
(airplane engine droning)

65
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,500
(chuckling)

66
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,875
- Hey you!

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,834
Look at you!

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,750
- Miriam!

69
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,333
Thanks, Barry!

70
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,291
- [Calvin] Come here!

71
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,625
(laughing)

72
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:19,000
- Oh, we're so glad you're here!

73
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,125
- How on Earth did you
get the money this time?

74
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,959
- Well, I did everything
but sell my body.

75
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,959
Oh, I might've done that
too, but it slipped my mind.

76
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,417
- So how long will
the money last?

77
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,458
- Well, that depends on you.

78
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,959
If you insist on
eating, six months,

79
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,375
but I have a feeling
we're gonna dig up Adam

80
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,709
long before that!

81
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,417
- Listen, I got real good
news, I got the same crew!

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,166
- Oh (mumbling)!

83
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,125
- Diana.

84
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,291
- What?

85
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,542
- Diana, now listen,
before all this hugging,

86
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,250
I think you ought to give
them a little speech,

87
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,750
something inspirational.

88
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,834
- Oh, inspirational?

89
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,667
- Yeah.

90
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,542
- Right, let's go!

91
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,500
- All right, let's go!

92
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,792
How's New York?

93
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,333
- Oh, I love New York,
where else can you see

94
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,875
all the best British plays?

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,500
- [Miriam] And how's Nairobi?

96
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,375
- Well, the traffic,
if possible, is worse.

97
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,250
So is Dr. Brinkman.

98
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,667
I think I prefer the traffic.

99
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,458
(engine roaring)

100
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,458
(singing in Swahili)

101
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:51,291
I can't believe I'm actually
back in this beautiful place!

102
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:52,208
- It's great, isn't it?

103
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,166
- Oh.

104
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,500
- I can't believe it!

105
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,083
- Who the Sam Hill is that?

106
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,291
(sawing)

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,250
- Whoever it is, they're digging

108
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,875
smack in the middle of our site.

109
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,792
(jackhammer pounding)

110
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,542
(speaking in Swahili)

111
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,667
(speaking in Swahili)

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,166
(speaking in Swahili)

113
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,667
- Well, well, well, hello!

114
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:01,750
Excuse my appearance,

115
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,041
we don't get a lot
of visitors up here.

116
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,625
- Who the devil are you and
what are you doing here?

117
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,166
- Being a keen
judge of character,

118
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,000
something tells me you're
not happy to see me,

119
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,625
whoever the devil I am.

120
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,041
And whoever the devil you are.

121
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,291
- I am Dr. Diana Firestone

122
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,458
of the National Institute
of Natural History.

123
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,959
These are my colleagues,
Professor Sioki and Dr. Finch.

124
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,750
This is our site and
we have permission

125
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,250
from the government to dig here!

126
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,083
- I'm Mr. Tobias
Williams and so have I.

127
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,041
- [Diana] So have you what?

128
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,917
- A permit, who gave you yours?

129
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,041
- The Ministry of Culture.

130
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,166
- Ah, there you are then,

131
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,417
mine's from the
Ministry of Interior,

132
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,208
and since this is the
interior, I think I win.

133
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,875
- Oh really?

134
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,041
Well what are you digging
for, diamonds, gold?

135
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:38,875
- Meerschaum.

136
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,500
- What?

137
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,041
- Meerschaum, you know, pipes,
Sherlock Holmes and all that.

138
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,709
- I know what meerschaum
is, Mr. Williams!

139
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,166
Do you realize that
you are ruining

140
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,709
one of the most important
paleontological sites in Africa?

141
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:50,542
- Paleontol...

142
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,333
Oh, bones, you mean?

143
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,667
- Fossils!

144
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,917
- Well, I can assure you,
there aren't any right here.

145
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,917
But there is quite
a lot of meerschaum.

146
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,083
Now, if I may suggest...

147
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,083
- Mr. Williams, you
do not understand!

148
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,166
- I understand very
well, Dr. Firestone.

149
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,375
You want to be here.

150
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,458
But I'm already here
and I'm staying here.

151
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,458
- We'll see about that!

152
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,834
(speaking in Swahili)

153
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,166
(laughing)

154
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,166
(speaking in Swahili)

155
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,083
(laughing)

156
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,208
- Oh, very good, Dr. Firestone!

157
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,959
I'm impressed with your Swahili.

158
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,625
- And your telling them
that, after supper,

159
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,959
to send me their
old chicken bones

160
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,417
was childish and unamusing.

161
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,709
- And your telling telling them

162
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:30,834
where they might stick
their old chicken bones

163
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,583
was inelegant,
but not unamusing.

164
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,041
I always knew we made a mistake

165
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,250
giving the Americans
their independence.

166
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,542
- I wasn't under the
impression you gave it to us!

167
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,792
But he'll have destroyed
everything before then.

168
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,417
- [Dr. Brinkman] It'll
take time, Diana.

169
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,709
- Yes.

170
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,417
- [Dr. Brinkman] Be patient.

171
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:55,792
- Yes!

172
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,875
- [Dr. Brinkman] There are
two ministries involved.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
- I am being patient,
Dr. Brinkman,

174
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,583
what you are hearing
now is patience.

175
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:01,834
You do not want to hear me when

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,125
I am impatient, Dr. Brinkman,

177
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,875
which will be in
exactly 24 hours

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,458
if you don't get that
pipe maker out of here!

179
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,250
- [Dr. Brinkman] Much
tact is required.

180
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,542
- All right!

181
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,083
- [Dr. Brinkman] There are
two ministries involved.

182
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,500
- All right!

183
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,875
- [Dr. Brinkman] Be patient.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,500
- Look, I understand
Dr. Brinkman

185
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,458
and I'm not going anywhere,
I'll be right here.

186
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,667
KX21 over and out.

187
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,125
- That's Brinkman, huh?

188
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,291
- Oh, Calvin.

189
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,125
- What'd he say?

190
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,333
- You don't wanna know.

191
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,709
- (sigh) Okay if I
take the Land Rover?

192
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:28,709
- What for?

193
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,667
- Well, a buddy of mine's
local area commissioner

194
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:32,667
over in Lamasa.

195
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,291
Maybe he can do
something for us.

196
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,625
- What, like run what's-his-name
over with an elephant?

197
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,000
- (chuckles) It's worth a try.

198
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,750
Maybe, maybe he
hates pipe smokers.

199
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,166
Maybe pipe smoking's an
instrument of evil to his tribe.

200
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,792
- Yeah well, let's hope so.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,834
Good luck.

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,083
- Okay, I'll see you later.

203
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:50,583
- Oh.

204
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,542
I know what you're thinking.

205
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,417
I could have handled it better.

206
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,166
- Diana, you know
I love you, but...

207
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,583
- Uh oh.

208
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:23,709
- Sometimes it can't hurt
to let the other person

209
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,375
have the last word.

210
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,458
- Because he's a man, right?

211
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,250
- Nnn nnn, because
he's a person.

212
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,750
- He's an annoying person.

213
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,083
- Maybe you didn't give him
a chance to be anything else.

214
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:37,083
- I suppose you found
him fascinating.

215
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,458
- Especially from this angle.

216
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,458
- Oh, I don't believe it.

217
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,542
Don't stare.

218
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,208
You'll just encourage him.

219
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,542
- You want to trade places?

220
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,000
- No.

221
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,709
What do you think?

222
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,208
- I think he's
trying to make up.

223
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,792
Maybe we should too.

224
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:02,750
- What do you want me to
do, go scrub his back?

225
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,083
Well, maybe you're right.

226
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,333
Maybe it's time for
a different approach.

227
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,458
(speaking in Swahili)

228
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,458
- Look Enjoro, an emissary
from the enemy camp.

229
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,792
Hmm, something tells me she's
trying a different approach.

230
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,291
Hmm, invitation to dinner.

231
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,500
- Shall I tell Dr.
Firestone anything?

232
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,667
- You tell Dr. Fire-and-
brimstone I'd be delighted

233
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,542
to accept her
gracious invitation.

234
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,917
- Mr. Williams, did Sherlock
Holmes really smoke pipes

235
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:01,959
that come from Africa?

236
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,792
- Meerschaum, yes, absolutely.

237
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,709
- Except there was
no Sherlock Holmes.

238
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,208
- But, if he had
smoked Meerschaum,

239
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,125
it undoubtedly would have
come from East Africa.

240
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,125
The best Meerschaum
always comes from here.

241
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,208
- Or Turkey.

242
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,041
- How on Earth do you know that?

243
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,709
- Crossword puzzles.

244
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,709
- Well (chuckles).

245
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,500
- Um, Meerschaum,
what is it really?

246
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,041
- It's a form of clay so light
and porous that it floats.

247
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:26,875
The word's German.

248
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,375
It means foam of the sea.

249
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,709
- How fascinating.

250
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,750
- No, really it's
boring as hell.

251
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,250
Tell me, how long have the
two of you worked together?

252
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,625
- Seven years now.

253
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,333
We started off by finding
a very ancient rat's tooth

254
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,375
together near Lake Pretoria

255
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,125
and knew we'd make
a good partnership.

256
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,375
- Rat's tooth, huh?

257
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,750
- Except we never found
the rest of the rat.

258
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:49,333
- Yeah, until now (laughs).

259
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,417
- Um, brandy or whiskey?

260
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,583
- Brandy's dandy.

261
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,542
- Candy is dandy.

262
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,000
- Oh, I know the
verse, Dr. Firestone.

263
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,458
Ogden Nash is a
favorite of mine.

264
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,291
- Oh.

265
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:09,750
- Well, now you were
telling me about your work.

266
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,709
(light music)

267
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,125
- Come with me, Mr. Williams.

268
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,792
(mysterious music)

269
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,417
- "Alas, poor Yorick,
I knew him well."

270
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,583
- "I knew him well, Horatio."

271
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,083
Everyone thinks it's
"I knew him well,"

272
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,041
but what Shakespeare
actually wrote...

273
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,000
Anyway, it's not Yorick.

274
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,625
We call him Adam.

275
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,792
- Hello Adam.

276
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,041
- You are looking at
what could be part of

277
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,709
the oldest hominid
skull ever found.

278
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,709
- Where did you dig him up?

279
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,375
- On the site you are
presently occupying.

280
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,834
Last February, but the rains
came and our money ran out.

281
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,375
- Money has a way of doing that.

282
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,000
- We're almost certain that
they travel in family groups,

283
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,458
so it's very likely
there are going to be

284
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,166
more significant finds.

285
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,000
- At what depth
did you find this?

286
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,375
- Three meters.

287
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:21,583
- Well, I've reached
four meters now

288
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,083
and I haven't found anything.

289
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,625
- Hmm, anything your chainsaws
haven't already destroyed.

290
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:28,834
- I think I've been
fairly careful.

291
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,083
I always am.

292
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:30,875
Now, if you'd like to
know what I think...

293
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,041
- Why would I wanna do that?

294
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,250
- Why not?

295
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,250
I just wanted to say I
found a few bones myself

296
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,583
downstream a little way.

297
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:36,959
Now, if you try digging there...

298
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,959
- Then, I wouldn't be
interfering with your work.

299
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,000
Nice try Mr. Williams,
but I know where to look

300
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,083
and it's where you are.

301
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,834
- Don't you even
want to see my bones?

302
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,166
- Well, I'm sure
they're very nice

303
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,750
but I doubt that they're
anything I'd be interested in.

304
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,583
- Mr. Williams.

305
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:52,667
- Thank you.

306
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,333
- Why don't I stop
my work altogether?

307
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,125
- Oh, Mr. Williams, would you?

308
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,875
We'd pay you for
your time, naturally.

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,333
- Oh, that's very
generous of you.

310
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,792
- Oh, just think, just think
how fulfilling it would be

311
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,667
to be part of the most important
archaeological discovery

312
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:13,959
of the century.

313
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,083
- Yes, right.

314
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:17,750
May I make another suggestion?

315
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,000
- Oh yes, please do.

316
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,000
- Why don't you stop your work

317
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,834
and help me dig for Meerschaum?

318
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
- Are you serious?

319
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:23,834
- Why not?

320
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,917
You were.

321
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,041
- Think how
fulfilling it would be

322
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:26,834
to make all the pipe
smokers in the world

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,667
happier and better people.

324
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,208
- That's rude.

325
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,500
- Really?

326
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,291
You know, there's a rather
arrogant presumption

327
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,583
on your part that what you
do is so much more important

328
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:36,667
than what anyone else does.

329
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,166
Have you noticed that?

330
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,667
- Do I think that
finding a vital link

331
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,542
in the history of
man is more important

332
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,917
than digging up clay for pipes?

333
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,166
You bet I do.

334
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,709
- Maybe I do too.

335
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,583
And maybe all those people
who like smoking pipes don't.

336
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:51,208
Knowledge has it's place,
Doctor, but then so does
pleasure.

337
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,250
- Don't you talk philosophy
to me, Mr. Williams.

338
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,291
You don't give a damn
about knowledge, history,

339
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,166
ecology, or anything else.

340
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,000
You're just in
this for the money.

341
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,583
- And what's in it for you?

342
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,000
Fame and glory.

343
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,333
That ought to be worth a
few dollars down the line.

344
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,583
I wouldn't be surprised if
you already have a last name

345
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,375
for this Adam of
yours, Firestone.

346
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,834
Firestone Man, right?

347
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,000
- Damn right, Mr. Williams.

348
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,166
- Well, now that we
understand each other better,

349
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,875
I shall say good night.

350
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,166
- You must come over and
see my camp sometime.

351
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,917
- Oh, we can see your camp
perfectly well from here,

352
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,041
Mr. Williams.

353
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,417
In fact, we can see
it all too well.

354
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,750
- Good night.

355
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,750
- Oh, uh, would it be
asking too much to suggest

356
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,375
that you cover yourself
the next time you bathe?

357
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,291
- Dr. Firestone, don't
tell me I shocked you.

358
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,625
- Not at all, Mr. Williams.

359
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,792
It's simply the sight of
a slightly overweight,

360
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,041
middle-aged Englishman
lathering his bum

361
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,583
when I'm trying to eat my supper

362
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,041
has a rather chilling
effect on the appetite.

363
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,083
- Very well then, next
time, I shall, as you say,

364
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,291
cover myself.

365
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,875
- From what I saw, it
wouldn't take much.

366
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,709
- Diana.

367
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,458
- Well, it wouldn't.

368
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,709
Good night, Mr. Williams.

369
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:55,792
- Thanks for dinner, Doctor.

370
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,834
It was truly fulfilling.

371
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:01,500
Professor Sioki.

372
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,291
- Can't you behave yourself?

373
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,542
- Well, I tried.

374
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,375
- Evening, Williams.

375
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,667
- Matter of interpretation.

376
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,166
- Hi.

377
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,750
- [Miriam] Well, any luck with
the commissioner in Lamosa?

378
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,417
- No, he turned us
down, but he did promise

379
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,041
to talk to the minister.

380
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:16,875
What's wrong with Williams?

381
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,709
He looked pretty ticked off.

382
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,458
- How should I know?

383
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,375
- Is this just sittin' here?

384
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,667
- Mmm hmm.

385
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:24,583
- Can I...

386
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,041
- Sure, go ahead.

387
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,417
(light music)

388
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,542
(moving to mysterious music)

389
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,667
(speaking in Swahili)

390
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,834
(wind music)

391
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,375
- This should do nicely.

392
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,542
(speaking in Swahili)

393
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,417
(mumbles) let me
help you with that.

394
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,125
Right about here I think's good.

395
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,375
- You're sure we're
not in your way?

396
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,375
- Just ignore us, Mr. Williams.

397
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,041
I assure you we'll do the same.

398
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,583
- You're about as easy to
ignore as a charging rhino.

399
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,000
Back off, Doctor.

400
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,208
There's plenty of
room for everyone.

401
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,875
- If we can't dig where we want,

402
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,166
we'll get as close as possible.

403
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,583
If I find any Meerschaum,
I'll let you know.

404
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,291
(upbeat music)

405
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:27,083
(clattering)

406
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,667
(pounding)

407
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,041
(chainsaw revving)

408
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,959
(clacking)

409
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,834
Thanks (mumbles).

410
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,959
(motor revving)

411
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,166
(speaking in Swahili)

412
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:31,917
(speaking in Swahili)

413
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,333
(squeaking)

414
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,250
- Here, Enjoro, try this.

415
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,291
Better.

416
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:10,250
(chainsaw revving)

417
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,792
(speaking in Swahili)

418
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,917
- I hate to interrupt this
drawing lesson, Enjoro,

419
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,083
but, if it's not
too much trouble,

420
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,625
I'd like you to fix my shower.

421
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,542
As bands go, is that a
good or a bad day's haul?

422
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,583
- Best we could expect
after some maniac

423
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,000
with a chainsaw's been
hacking up the place.

424
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,333
- Look, I know we've
got off to a bad start.

425
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,625
Neighbors should
try to get along,

426
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,208
so, since we're stuck
here together for awhile,

427
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,375
we might as well behave in
a semi-civilized manner.

428
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,917
- Meaning what?

429
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,208
- Meaning, I'm inviting the
three of you for a Happy Hour.

430
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,375
- Yes?

431
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,917
When does Happy Hour begin?

432
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,959
- As soon as you can get there.

433
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,583
- Miriam, Calvin?

434
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:12,875
Would you care to join the
abominable Mr. Williams

435
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,375
for a drink?

436
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,208
- Oh certainly.

437
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,417
- Count me in.

438
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,458
- I'll be expecting you then.

439
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,792
(sighing)

440
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:30,750
(light wind music)

441
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,125
- You know there's
something I been meaning

442
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,792
to ask you, Williams.

443
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:45,417
That boy who works for
you, he's Maasai, isn't he?

444
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:46,333
- Yes.

445
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,667
His name's Enjoro.

446
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,667
I call him my Man
Monday through Friday.

447
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,625
He's a damn fine cook, too.

448
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,333
You know, next time you
have a dinner party,

449
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,917
I should send him over.

450
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,166
- If...

451
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,458
- Well, well, that,
that's what's confusing.

452
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,792
I, I thought that all the
Maasai figured camp work

453
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,500
was beneath them.

454
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:02,417
- Well, Enjoro's different.

455
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,583
He's got an odd history.

456
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,041
- [Miriam] In what way?

457
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,709
- Well, he's not held in very
high regard by his people.

458
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,792
When he was just eight, his
mother took him to the city.

459
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,291
And years later when he
returned, he had trouble

460
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,959
adjusting to the old ways.

461
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,417
For example, he wouldn't fight.

462
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,667
That meant he couldn't
become a Moran, a warrior.

463
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:21,000
So, you see, he's just an
outcast among his own people.

464
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,959
- Yeah, the Maasai are very
strict in these things.

465
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,959
It's always been that way.

466
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,792
- Doesn't have to be.

467
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,667
- Here it does.

468
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:30,000
- I think I need a walk.

469
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:30,834
- Want someone to go with you?

470
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,250
- No, thank you.

471
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:39,875
- Like to see the lion
stupid enough to take her on.

472
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,625
Your friend, she likes
to take the world

473
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,333
on her shoulders, doesn't she?

474
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,959
- Well, let's just say
that when she gets her mind

475
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,000
set on something, it's
hard to shake her loose.

476
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:49,625
- Yes, but commitment
and stubbornness

477
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,583
aren't exactly the
same, are they?

478
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,834
(lighthearted music)

479
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:02,208
(speaking in Swahili)

480
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,125
- Enjoro, these are for you.

481
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,417
- Thank you.

482
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,625
(giggling)

483
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,667
- We're getting similar
samples as the last time.

484
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:22,542
- Yeah.

485
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,375
- What do you think?

486
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,542
- Well, I reckon we're
about in the same layer

487
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,542
as when we found that skull.

488
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,041
Well, let's concentrate
everybody on grid 16.

489
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,500
And clear some brush
from over there.

490
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,667
Maybe we'll start another grid.

491
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:36,375
- Okay, you got it.

492
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,417
- Ever heard of a
thing called a camera?

493
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:55,542
- Yes, but doing it this
way allows me to concentrate

494
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:56,834
on the details.

495
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,041
And in this business,
it's the details

496
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,917
that tell you how to proceed.

497
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:07,166
Precise color of a chip of bone,
the shape of a small tooth,

498
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,625
they can be clues to the
difference of hundreds of
thousands

499
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,500
of years.

500
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:21,875
Shouldn't you be off laying
waste to the countryside.

501
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,542
(speaking in Swahili)

502
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,667
Come with me, there's
something I'd like you to see.

503
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,959
- What?

504
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,625
- Do you have to know
the answer to everything?

505
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:29,667
Can't you just accept
the possibility

506
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,500
of a pleasant surprise?

507
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,000
- Sometimes I can.

508
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,917
- Oh, don't be such a prune.

509
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,542
- Well, I suppose a
minute or two of insults

510
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,000
could liven up the afternoon.

511
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:48,625
- [Tobias] Watch
your step there.

512
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,875
- [Diana] Hmm.

513
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,875
(light music)

514
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,125
Are we almost there?

515
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,750
- Don't be so impatient.

516
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,041
(clanging)

517
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,041
- Miriam, Miriam!

518
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,542
- [Miriam] Yes?

519
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,834
(speaking in Swahili)

520
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,750
Get me a flashlight.

521
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,667
(cow bell clanging)

522
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,458
- Are they all yours?

523
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,792
- They're from Tarkanan.

524
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,917
That train's packed with
my Meerschaum for Nairobi.

525
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,542
These will be packed later.

526
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,542
- You ever heard of a
thing called a truck?

527
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,458
- (chuckling) Yes, but
camel doesn't need petrol,

528
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,583
doesn't rust, doesn't
get stuck in the mud,

529
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:55,041
and they're a damn sight
more interesting to look at.

530
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:55,959
Ever ridden on one?

531
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:56,875
- Well, of course I have.

532
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
(speaking in Swahili)

533
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:58,875
- But not for years.

534
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,542
- I'd like you to meet Siamba.

535
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,750
- Well, hello Siamba.

536
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,250
You have beautiful eyelashes.

537
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,667
- Here.

538
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:08,625
(roaring)

539
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,041
- You'll wanna make
sure to hold onto this...

540
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,750
- Yes, I know, I know.

541
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,959
(roaring)

542
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,750
(speaking in Swahili)

543
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,458
(comical music)

544
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,333
(chuckling)

545
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,000
(ominous music)

546
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,875
- [Miriam] Strange.

547
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It appears to be an
old volcanic vent.

548
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,125
Let's see how far this goes.

549
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,542
- [Man] Go carefully.

550
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:10,166
- [Miriam] I'll just
check if it's stable.

551
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,542
Solid magma in the soil.

552
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,542
It's definitely volcanic.

553
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:20,458
Wait here.

554
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,917
(gasping)

555
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,500
- Is it Adam?

556
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:40,125
- Not unless he died in
the last hundred years.

557
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,875
Get Dr. Firestone and Dr. Finch.

558
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,291
- [Diana] I should be
getting back to the dig.

559
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,750
- [Tobias] You're a real
obsessive, aren't you?

560
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,083
- [Diana] People in my
profession usually are.

561
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,959
A lot of demented diggers.

562
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,000
- [Tobia] (chuckling) Not
like the Meerschaum business.

563
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,208
We're a happy-go-lucky lot.

564
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:06,500
- [Diana] Is that all you
do, dig for Meerschaum?

565
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,375
- [Tobias] Day and night, no.

566
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:11,125
- [Diana] I meant
professionally.

567
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,125
- Well, that depends on
what one calls a profession.

568
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,625
How about alligator wrestling?

569
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,625
- You did that?

570
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,458
- Well, you're trying
to capture live ones,

571
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:24,041
wrestling is about the
only option one has.

572
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:24,959
- Then what did you do?

573
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,166
Sell them to zoos?

574
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,500
- Oh, I don't like zoos.

575
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,792
Animals go insane in captivity.

576
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,208
No, we were moving
them from an area

577
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,125
that was being developed
to a national park

578
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,250
where they'd be left alone.

579
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,917
- Well, I'd call
that a profession.

580
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:37,875
What else?

581
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,041
- What else?

582
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,250
Let's see started an air
taxi service in Ghana

583
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,500
that went bankrupt.

584
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,333
A trading post in Uganda
that was nationalized.

585
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:49,875
That's official-eeze
for confiscated.

586
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,250
Opened a Land Rover
agency in Mombasa.

587
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,250
My partner pushed me out though,

588
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,750
Sir Gary Amunde.

589
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:59,500
Oh, represented a
whisky company in Angola

590
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,750
until the communists convinced
the people to drink vodka.

591
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,625
Want to hear more
success stories?

592
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,583
- [Diana] Is there
anything you haven't tried?

593
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:10,750
- [Tobias] I'm sure there's
one or two golden opportunities

594
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,500
I haven't scrambled up yet.

595
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,750
(roaring)

596
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,500
I'll get around to them
eventually no doubt.

597
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,959
(cow bells clanging)

598
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,375
- [Diana] What did you wanna
be when you were young?

599
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,792
- [Tobias] Promise
you won't laugh?

600
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,083
- [Diana] No.

601
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,208
- [Tobias] No, you won't laugh?

602
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,792
- [Diana] No, I won't promise.

603
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:28,083
- A lifeguard.

604
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,333
Think of it, we're sitting
on a beach all day,

605
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,709
basking in the sun,
gazing out at the ocean,

606
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:35,208
watching the birds
in their bikinis.

607
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:38,208
Was there ever a better
job invented by man?

608
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,417
- Not much future in it.

609
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,792
- Well, I've never been
too crazy about that word.

610
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:44,709
Nothing makes the
time pass quicker

611
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,333
than thinking about the future.

612
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:50,166
Can't wait until tomorrow,
can't wait until I grow up,

613
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,417
can't wait until I retire.

614
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,834
You know what's happening
while you can't wait?

615
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,709
You're life's getting used up.

616
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:57,250
Next thing you know
you're through waiting

617
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,083
because it's all over.

618
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,667
No, I'll take the present
over the future any time.

619
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,875
- There's something
missing from all that.

620
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,166
- What?

621
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,917
- A career, a plan, a goal.

622
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,792
- Those things are important
to you, aren't they?

623
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:11,709
- Very.

624
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:14,709
- No, they're not to me.

625
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:17,583
- Well, that's the difference
between us, Mr. Williams.

626
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:19,458
You only care about the present

627
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:24,333
while my life is dedicated to
a future built in the past.

628
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,166
- Come quickly.

629
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,125
Miriam has found something.

630
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,875
(ominous music)

631
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,959
(crumbling)

632
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,166
(rumbling)

633
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:48,458
(crashing)

634
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,250
(dramatic music)

635
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:55,041
- [Man] Dr. Firestone.

636
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,000
Miriam went inside
and it caved in.

637
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,917
- [Man] Mr. Williams,
there's trouble in the camp.

638
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,083
(speaking in Swahili)

639
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:34,417
- Miriam!

640
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,291
Miriam!

641
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,792
IF you can hear me, answer me.

642
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,417
- Hey, what's happening?

643
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,750
- Diana and Miriam are down
there and it's caved in.

644
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,250
- [Calvin] A flashlight,
anybody got a flashlight?

645
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,125
Here.

646
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:56,875
(crumbling)

647
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,166
(crashing)

648
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:09,667
- Ow.

649
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,667
(crashing)

650
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:28,208
(speaking in Swahili)

651
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,667
(coughing)

652
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:35,542
- You okay?

653
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,875
- (coughing) Yeah.

654
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,041
(coughing)

655
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:40,875
- [Calvin] Want
me to go with ya?

656
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,792
- [Tobias] No, you stay here

657
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:42,542
and (mumbles).

658
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,709
(coughing)

659
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:47,750
(mysterious music)

660
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,750
Miriam, damn it, where are you?

661
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,417
Miriam?

662
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:01,750
Do you hear me?

663
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:06,667
Calvin!

664
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:08,750
Pull!

665
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:14,166
(dramatic drumming music)

666
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,125
- [Tobias] Easy.

667
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,458
- There she is.

668
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:35,291
Grab her, help him, help him.

669
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,291
- Careful, watch her head.

670
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,375
(rumbling)

671
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:55,875
Your job is to get
back on your feet

672
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,166
just as soon as possible.

673
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,542
Don't you worry about a thing.

674
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,458
Calvin's gonna go to
Nairbobi with you.

675
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:04,709
- You try to stay out of the
discos for a few nights, huh?

676
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,250
- I'll talk to
you in a few days.

677
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,917
- All right, hold on.

678
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:25,500
(light flute music)

679
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,125
- How about some barely
drinkable tea with brandy?

680
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,208
- No thanks.

681
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:55,709
- Go ahead.

682
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,083
- It's a light shock.

683
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,208
You both could have been killed.

684
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:13,125
Takes a while for
that to sink in.

685
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:15,917
- I wanna thank
you for your help

686
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,125
this afternoon, Mr. Williams.

687
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,834
- We were all very lucky today.

688
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:27,959
- Those tunes that Enjoro
plays on his flute,

689
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,250
they're lovely.

690
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,959
I've never heard them
anywhere in Africa before.

691
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,750
- I asked him about them once.

692
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:39,834
He said they just
came into his head.

693
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,083
- That's what Mozart said.

694
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,709
He's very talented.

695
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:53,625
Just think what he could
do with an education.

696
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,250
- Isn't what he's doing enough?

697
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,542
- Maybe it is.

698
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,792
- You know, that's the
first time since we met

699
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:06,583
that you've even partially
conceded a point.

700
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,083
There may be hope for you yet.

701
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:22,959
(speaking in Swahili)

702
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,291
- [Tobias] Nashar.

703
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,625
(speaking in Swahili)

704
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:07,041
Maasai friends have come to
warn us about a rogue lion

705
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,750
that's killing their cattle.

706
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:11,041
I'm packing my crew over there
to help them hunt it down.

707
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,250
Have you ever seen a lion hunt?

708
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:13,709
- No.

709
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,417
I'm not sure I want to.

710
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,291
- Well, why don't you come
along just for the ride?

711
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,667
You can see the village
and give your bones a rest

712
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,417
at the same time.

713
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,500
- All right.

714
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:23,625
- We leave in half an hour.

715
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,125
No need to dress.

716
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,041
(speaking in Swahili)

717
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:35,375
(tapping)

718
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,208
- Dr. Firestone, this is Nashar.

719
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:41,208
(speaking in Swahili)

720
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,750
- I promised Nashar
he can ride up front.

721
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,750
You won't mind, will you?

722
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:44,875
- Oh, no, no.

723
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,959
(doors slamming)

724
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,792
(engine revving)

725
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:09,875
Friendly, isn't he?

726
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,125
- No, he likes you.

727
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,750
I've never seen him
take to anyone so fast.

728
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:16,959
- (chuckles) Really?

729
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:35,166
(speaking in Swahili)

730
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:56,667
(speaking in Swahili)

731
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,500
- The lion do this?

732
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,792
- Yes.

733
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,417
I'd say it's pretty
old by the look of it.

734
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,583
That's when they're
most dangerous.

735
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,458
They've been pushed out of
the pride by the young lions

736
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,458
and they have to survive
any way they can.

737
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,959
- That's how we
treat our old people.

738
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,959
You gonna track him now?

739
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:16,750
- The kill isn't that fresh.

740
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:18,250
He could be miles away by now.

741
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,291
Let's pay our respects
to their village first.

742
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,583
(speaking in Swahili)

743
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,625
(speaking in Swahili)

744
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,458
(laughing)

745
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,250
(laughing)

746
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:39,500
(speaking in Swahili)

747
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:50,625
(speaking in Swahili)

748
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:23,625
- How long have you
been teaching here?

749
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,959
- About three years now.

750
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:25,709
- Three years?

751
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:26,583
- Yeah.

752
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:27,458
- How many children?

753
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:28,667
- About seven.

754
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,625
- Is that Tobias Williams, huh?

755
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,250
- Yeah, he donated these to us.

756
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:38,542
(speaking in Swahili)

757
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,500
He got a number
of books in there.

758
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:43,375
- Really?

759
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,000
- A number of chalks.

760
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,083
- Chalk and everything?

761
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,250
- Yeah.

762
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:50,083
- Oh, my goodness.

763
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:50,917
- We're well-equipped.

764
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,583
(speaking in Swahili)

765
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,375
(drumming)

766
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,625
(shouting)

767
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,000
(laughing)

768
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,291
- Amazing people, aren't they?

769
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,125
- Yes, and very beautiful.

770
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,333
(shouting)

771
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,959
- Not sorry you came?

772
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:23,875
- No.

773
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,625
(shouting)

774
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,917
(laughing)

775
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:43,333
(laughing)

776
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,375
I saw those books.

777
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:46,208
Quite the philanthropist,
aren't you?

778
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,792
- Ah, they help me, I help them.

779
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:49,709
- Business is business.

780
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:53,083
The teacher was really
singing your praises.

781
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,250
- Ah, he shouldn't
tarnish my image that way.

782
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:56,709
- Oh no, of course not.

783
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:59,000
(drumming)

784
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,709
- But it didn't
have to be books.

785
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:03,709
It could have been bubble
gum and blue jeans.

786
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:04,542
- Good idea.

787
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:05,542
I'll try that next time.

788
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,834
(laughing)

789
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:10,542
(shouting)

790
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,041
(clattering)

791
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,709
(baby crying)

792
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,750
You have to drink
some, I'm afraid.

793
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:30,125
Would be rude not to.

794
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:30,959
It's made from...

795
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,083
- I know what it's made from

796
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:35,208
and I'm trying not
to think about it.

797
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,792
(whispering in a
foreign language)

798
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,750
What's happening?

799
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,583
- They've spotted the lion
again near the cattle.

800
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:44,041
Would you like to come?

801
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:45,500
- If I don't, they may ask me

802
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,250
to drink some more
of this pombe.

803
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:48,542
You haven't had any yet.

804
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:49,417
- (laughing) You mean,
you mean you don't like

805
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,083
fermented milk and cow's blood?

806
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,542
- Enough, oh please.

807
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,917
(laughing)

808
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,625
- Mmm.

809
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,875
(cow bell clanging)

810
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:03,083
(speaking in Swahili)

811
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,667
(roaring)

812
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:10,125
(light music)

813
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,959
(clattering)

814
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:15,166
(speaking in Swahili)

815
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,458
- This fellow's
a smart old lion.

816
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,625
He's not going to let himself
get cornered this easily.

817
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,125
Lost him for today.

818
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:45,625
- Well, if you wanna
know how I'd catch him...

819
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,667
- Dr. Firestone, I wouldn't
presume to tell you

820
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:48,792
about old bones.

821
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,333
Leave the lion hunt to me.

822
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,458
- All right, but I still think
my idea's worth listening to.

823
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:53,625
- All right, let's hear it then.

824
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,458
I haven't had a good
laugh in an hour.

825
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,500
- Why don't you just stake
out his earlier kill?

826
00:46:57,667 --> 00:46:59,125
Bet ya anything he'll come
back to feed on it again.

827
00:46:59,250 --> 00:46:59,959
- That wouldn't work.

828
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:00,750
- Why?

829
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:01,625
- Because.

830
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:02,333
- Why?

831
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,291
- Because it wouldn't.

832
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,125
- Hmm.

833
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:08,834
- Nashar.

834
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,083
(speaking in Swahili)

835
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:19,500
(speaking in Swahili)

836
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:32,750
(goat bleating)

837
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,542
- Where's Enjoro?

838
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,709
- I'm leaving my crew to help
protect the cattle tonight.

839
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:44,709
Enjoro has to cook for them.

840
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,542
They don't like Maasai cuisine.

841
00:47:46,709 --> 00:47:47,917
- You can't just leave him here.

842
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,667
You know how difficult
it is for him.

843
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:50,917
- He should be
used to it by now.

844
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,083
He'll be all right.

845
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:53,667
- Used to it?

846
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:55,500
How insensitive can you be?

847
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,041
- Now, look Doctor,
Enjoro works for me

848
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,333
and I need him here.

849
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,625
If you want to babysit,
that's your affair.

850
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,458
Otherwise, get in and
I'll drive you back.

851
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:02,792
- If you really
wanna help the Maasai

852
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:04,208
why not start with Enjoro?

853
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,583
Make the others see
what harm they're doing

854
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:06,709
to an innocent boy.

855
00:48:06,834 --> 00:48:07,875
- I can't do that.

856
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,291
- Why not?

857
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:10,750
- Because their tribal customs
are none of my business.

858
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,583
I could do a certain
amount to help them survive

859
00:48:12,709 --> 00:48:13,709
in a world they want no part of,

860
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:15,250
but I can't interfere
in their culture.

861
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:16,709
It's what makes
them what they are.

862
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:17,875
Now, either you respect that

863
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,083
or you're part of
the bleeding problem.

864
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,375
- You really see yourself as
the great father protector,

865
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,458
don't you?

866
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:24,500
How pompous and arrogant.

867
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:25,875
How very British.

868
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,875
- And you want to interfere

869
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,041
before you understand
the reality.

870
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,250
How very American.

871
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:30,333
- Good bye, Mr. Williams.

872
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,583
Once again, your
company has proven to be

873
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,458
absolutely resistible.

874
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,208
- Where the devil do
you think you're going?

875
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:39,250
- Where I don't have to see
you, hear you, or smell you.

876
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,083
- Smell me?

877
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,291
I happen to wash regularly.

878
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:44,125
- Try washing your pipe.

879
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,208
- Silly cow.

880
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:50,583
(sniffing) Smells wonderful.

881
00:48:51,792 --> 00:48:54,500
(marching music)

882
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:04,709
Get in.

883
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:09,959
It happens to be 10
miles back to your camp.

884
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:13,083
All right, if that's
how you want it.

885
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:20,917
By the way, good
luck with that lion.

886
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,542
He should be getting
hungry again by now.

887
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:26,500
No, you're right, you can
take care of him all right.

888
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:27,667
Just tell him he's
pompous and arrogant.

889
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:28,583
That should do the trick.

890
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:30,083
Killed my appetite.

891
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:30,959
Good luck.

892
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:46,917
- Roar!

893
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:14,333
Meow.

894
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,166
- Infantile.

895
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,083
(speaking in Swahili)

896
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,667
- Dr. Firestone, Dr. Firestone.

897
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:41,875
- Yeah?

898
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,333
- Lydia says Miriam
will be all right

899
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:45,250
and Dr. Calvin
will be back soon.

900
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,792
- Oh, that's great news.

901
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:47,625
Thanks.

902
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:02,375
(speaking in Swahili)

903
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:28,667
(speaking in Swahili)

904
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:49,000
(giggling)

905
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,583
(speaking in Swahili)

906
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,583
(romantic music)

907
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,959
Well, you look
somewhat presentable.

908
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,083
- But I couldn't
find the trousers.

909
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,709
- You also smell
somewhat presentable.

910
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:31,959
- Well, thank you.

911
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:32,875
Coming from you, that's
high praise indeed.

912
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:34,250
- Don't overdo it.

913
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,834
- Would you care to see
our exclusive wine list?

914
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,458
- There's only one wine on it.

915
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,542
- I said it was
exclusive, didn't I?

916
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:47,291
- We said some pretty
awful things today.

917
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:50,959
- I think that's rather a
hopeful sign, don't you?

918
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,166
Cheers.

919
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,083
- Cheers.

920
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,417
- I fell in love with Africa
the first moment I saw it.

921
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,834
Historians have been
arguing for centuries

922
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,792
about where the Garden
of Eden was located.

923
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:06,834
There's no doubt in my
mind it was right here.

924
00:53:06,959 --> 00:53:07,917
- Did you ever fall in love

925
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,917
with anything less
than a continent?

926
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,667
- Hmm, once or twice.

927
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:16,083
- But, you never married.

928
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,667
- How do you know that?

929
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:21,291
- Well, you act like a man
who's used to being on his own.

930
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:22,500
- No, I never found a woman

931
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:24,583
who could put up with
my brand of nonsense.

932
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:26,667
My habits, my gypsy life.

933
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:28,959
My pipe.

934
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,250
- Oh, I can do that.

935
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,166
- Something I can do.

936
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,750
This bloke you was married
to, what was his story?

937
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,625
- He was a paleontologist too.

938
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,291
Trouble was, his
career had peaked

939
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:44,750
and mine was just
getting started.

940
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,417
Not very conducive
to conjugal bliss.

941
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:50,208
Then he started wanting things
he knew I couldn't give him.

942
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:52,583
A real home,
regular meals, kids.

943
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:55,083
A wife with clean fingernails.

944
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,041
- Silly stuff like that.

945
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,792
- He finally got what he wanted.

946
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:00,041
- What?

947
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:01,542
- Jennifer.

948
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,208
A big, broad-hipped,
blonde who got pregnant

949
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,458
when he looked at her,

950
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:07,792
and loads of inherited
money in the bargain.

951
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:10,750
And he gives boring lectures
at a boring girls' school

952
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:14,000
in New England (giggles).

953
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,500
Oh, dear Paul (laughing).

954
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:23,041
- And you?

955
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,375
- Me what?

956
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,709
- What are you looking for?

957
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:33,208
- A single man, one
that is silent, unique,

958
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,417
and elusive.

959
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:36,458
- Ahh, Adam.

960
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:40,667
- That's right.

961
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:42,750
I already have part of him.

962
00:54:42,834 --> 00:54:46,208
Rest of him's buried
out there somewhere.

963
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,917
(light piano music)

964
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,959
- Maybe he's closer
than you think.

965
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,333
If the Doctor would
care to follow me.

966
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:03,000
- Well, these are
mostly small rodents.

967
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,792
This is a reptile.

968
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,125
Where'd you get them?

969
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:09,542
- Um, I told you I was
careful when I dig.

970
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:10,959
Worth anything, are they?

971
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:11,875
- No.

972
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:16,166
They're well-preserved
but fairly common.

973
00:55:18,834 --> 00:55:21,500
- This is worthless
too, I guess.

974
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,250
(ominous music)

975
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:30,667
- Good Lord.

976
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,709
Where did you find this?

977
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:38,917
- About two hundred
yards downstream.

978
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:40,834
Tried to tell you that at
that first night at dinner,

979
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:44,291
but you thought I was
trying to trick you.

980
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,375
Is it Adam?

981
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,125
- Why, I can't say straight off.

982
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:57,792
I'll have to measure it and
match it against my skull.

983
00:55:57,917 --> 00:55:59,875
- Well, how about a
nightcap to celebrate,

984
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,125
possibilities?

985
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,375
You're welcome.

986
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,208
(clicking)

987
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:17,500
- Must you do that?

988
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,083
- This is maddening.

989
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:20,750
Why don't you just join them
together and see if they fit?

990
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,083
- Mr. Williams, do I tell you

991
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:25,458
about Meerschaum...
- Meerschaum, I know, I know.

992
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,583
- Besides, doesn't match.

993
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,500
- Doesn't, are you sure?

994
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:31,875
- Mmm hmm.

995
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's very close in age, but
it's definitely not Adam.

996
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:39,834
- Well, (mumbles) after
all, it is a jawbone.

997
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:43,291
- Okay, how about
an explanation?

998
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:44,750
- About what?

999
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,959
- Not telling me
about this until now.

1000
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,667
Allowing me to dig
on an inferior site,

1001
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:49,917
when you knew all the time...

1002
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:51,625
- I've already told you,
every time I talk to you,

1003
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,959
you always knew best.

1004
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:53,792
Besides...

1005
00:56:53,917 --> 00:56:54,667
- Besides what?

1006
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:55,667
- If I gave you that jawbone

1007
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,500
and it had turned
out to be Adam,

1008
00:56:57,667 --> 00:56:58,542
we'd never have had a chance

1009
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:00,792
to get to know
each other better.

1010
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,291
- Incredible.

1011
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:04,125
You mean, you were
actually willing to hold up

1012
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:06,083
an important advance
in human knowledge

1013
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,542
so we could know
each other better?

1014
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,000
- Why not?

1015
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,250
The world has waited millions
of years for this advance.

1016
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,500
A couple of more days
couldn't have hurt.

1017
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:13,917
- So, now that you've
given it to me,

1018
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:15,583
I suppose you do know me better.

1019
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:16,583
- A little.

1020
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:18,458
- Just what is it
you think you know?

1021
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,166
- I know that everything
you do that I disapprove of,

1022
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:22,000
your compulsiveness,
your combativeness,

1023
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:24,000
your stubbornness are things
that I've come to admire.

1024
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,667
- If you're trying to
convince me that you are not

1025
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:28,291
a totally insensitive ass,
you're wasting your time.

1026
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:29,583
- I'm not trying to
convince you of anything.

1027
00:57:29,709 --> 00:57:31,333
I just want to help you
with your old bones.

1028
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,417
- Just whose old bones
are we talking about?

1029
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:34,625
- Do you think you could
keep your mouth shut

1030
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,208
long enough for me to kiss it?

1031
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:39,709
(gasp)

1032
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,250
I don't want to
hold up your work.

1033
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,875
Now that you know where to dig,

1034
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,792
I'm sure you'll want to
get on with it right away.

1035
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:50,667
- I guess the world
could wait another day.

1036
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:54,000
(romantic piano music)

1037
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:08,542
(romantic piano music)

1038
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:23,625
(mooing)

1039
00:58:58,959 --> 00:59:00,083
(speaking in Swahili)

1040
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,375
- Good morning.

1041
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:04,458
- Morning.

1042
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,583
- Have a good night?

1043
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:08,875
- Not too bad.

1044
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,208
- If you've nothing
better to do,

1045
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:12,208
how about breakfast?

1046
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,250
- Don't mind if I do.

1047
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,041
- Your place or mine?

1048
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,041
- Mine.

1049
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:18,291
20 minutes.

1050
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:19,667
- I'll be there.

1051
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,667
(mooing)

1052
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:41,792
I don't know about all of this.

1053
00:59:41,917 --> 00:59:43,041
Next thing you know,
I'll be reading the Times

1054
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:46,250
and asking you to
pass the marmalade.

1055
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:52,959
- Uh, would you rather we
didn't talk at breakfast?

1056
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,709
- I don't know.

1057
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:03,875
I haven't had breakfast with
a human female for years.

1058
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:06,667
It seems all right.

1059
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:08,959
So far.

1060
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,041
- Well, it's okay with me.

1061
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,834
- I'm not sure I could keep
it up three meals a day.

1062
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:19,333
- Oh, well, well, you have
nothing to worry about.

1063
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:20,875
I never eat lunch.

1064
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,458
(giggling)

1065
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:30,375
- Come on, I'll show you
where I found that jawbone.

1066
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:31,500
(light flute music)

1067
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:32,834
I was running test
bores right along here

1068
01:00:32,959 --> 01:00:35,458
as indicated by these markers.

1069
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:40,375
And I found the jaw right
off this last marker here.

1070
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,083
It was exposed, right
there in the sand.

1071
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:42,875
- There?

1072
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,333
- Here.

1073
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,750
- Well, I guess maybe it
could have washed down river.

1074
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,500
- You're the expert.

1075
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:58,417
(singing in Swahili)

1076
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,709
- Come reinforcements,
Dr. Firestone.

1077
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:03,750
(sighing)

1078
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,208
- Mmm hmm (chuckling).

1079
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,041
- Hey.

1080
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:07,750
Nothing so far, eh?

1081
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,834
- We're not through yet.

1082
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,333
- Well, if it were
easy, it wouldn't be

1083
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:15,500
so much bloody fun, right?

1084
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:18,250
- Now you're
getting the picture.

1085
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:23,834
- What's wrong?

1086
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:26,125
My socks match.

1087
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,291
- Just stay where you are.

1088
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:28,625
And don't move.

1089
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:32,792
(ominous music)

1090
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,917
(moving to dramatic music)

1091
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,166
(laughing)

1092
01:03:36,709 --> 01:03:37,917
- Look at that.

1093
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Look at that.

1094
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:52,625
What's the verdict?

1095
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,458
- It's a perfect match,
no doubt about it.

1096
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,375
- Adam you mean?

1097
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,500
- No, no your person.

1098
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,458
The jaw fits perfectly.

1099
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:03,375
- What do we call him then?

1100
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,041
Adam's best friend?

1101
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,250
- Oh, I can't be
absolutely sure.

1102
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,208
I've ordered some
radiocarbon testing

1103
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,792
to determine the age.

1104
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:15,166
I sent some scrapings
back to the States.

1105
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,000
- All right, but
what do you think?

1106
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:20,083
- I've got a good feeling.

1107
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,709
- At last.

1108
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:23,166
Firestone Man, huh?

1109
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:24,500
- No, no, no, no, no.

1110
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:27,041
You found the jaw, so it's
really the Williams Man.

1111
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:28,083
- No, I don't need that.

1112
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,333
You're the one in
the bone business.

1113
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:31,959
It's my gift to you.

1114
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:36,709
(ominous music)

1115
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,291
- Oh.

1116
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,875
I don't understand who
would do a thing like this

1117
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:51,750
to you, Enjoro.

1118
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,041
Please tell me who it is.

1119
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:55,125
- I cannot.

1120
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,333
- Please.

1121
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:57,875
I only wanna help.

1122
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,291
- He's not about to tell you.

1123
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,583
Leave him alone.

1124
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,041
- I think he's been left
alone too damn much already.

1125
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:09,542
All of this is because you
insisted on leaving him there.

1126
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:10,875
- Now, don't make more
of this than it is.

1127
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:11,709
He's all right.

1128
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,917
- He is not all right!

1129
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,125
And you won't do
anything for him

1130
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,375
because of some
ancient tribal custom.

1131
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,625
- I took him in, didn't I?

1132
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,417
- Yeah, right, and
then you sent him back.

1133
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,000
- For only one night.

1134
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:24,417
- Rome was burnt in a night.

1135
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:25,500
- This isn't Rome
and you don't know

1136
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:26,667
what the hell you're
talking about.

1137
01:05:26,834 --> 01:05:28,166
Now, listen to me.

1138
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:29,375
He's one of those
unfortunate people

1139
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,834
who's fallen between the cracks.

1140
01:05:30,959 --> 01:05:32,166
He doesn't fit in with
his own people anymore

1141
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:34,000
and he doesn't
belong here either.

1142
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,583
There are people like
that in the world

1143
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:37,834
and you can make yourself very
unhappy trying to change it.

1144
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,500
You can't change it, Diana.

1145
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,375
This isn't your country and
these aren't your people.

1146
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,458
- People are people, damn it.

1147
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,041
- Now what the hell
does that mean?

1148
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:45,375
That Hottentots and Eskimos feed

1149
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,083
and bleed and love their kids.

1150
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,583
That's just another one of
your glib generalizations.

1151
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,000
You have grand theories
about the world,

1152
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:52,291
but you fail to take
into consideration

1153
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:53,792
the problems of individuals.

1154
01:05:53,959 --> 01:05:56,000
Enjoro is the victim of
two imperfect societies,

1155
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:57,458
his and ours.

1156
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,000
Leave it alone.

1157
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:01,041
- I can't do that.

1158
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:04,458
Now, I don't give a damn if
he can be a Maasai warrior.

1159
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:08,041
He's bright and he's talented
and I wanna help him.

1160
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:08,875
- No you don't.

1161
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,125
You want to mother him.

1162
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:10,959
And just because you had
no children of your own...

1163
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:13,250
(slapping)

1164
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:17,917
- Come with me.

1165
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,583
- Diana, where do you
think you're going?

1166
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:26,667
Don't take him to
the village, Diana.

1167
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,959
Diana, will you listen to me?

1168
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,041
If you take him to the village,

1169
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:32,500
you're going to
stir up more trouble

1170
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:34,375
than you or he can ever handle.

1171
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:35,208
(engine revving)

1172
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,041
Diana.

1173
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:37,000
Diana!

1174
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:56,333
- Get out of my way.

1175
01:06:56,417 --> 01:06:57,500
- Not until you
listen to reason.

1176
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,542
You can't go there
and start trouble

1177
01:06:59,709 --> 01:07:02,166
about things you
know nothing of.

1178
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:05,041
(engines revving)

1179
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:11,583
We can play this
bloody game all day,

1180
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:14,250
but you're not going there.

1181
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:17,125
(engines revving)

1182
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:25,417
- Damn.

1183
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,667
- All right then,
let's have a look.

1184
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:04,667
(engine revving)

1185
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:12,166
Now then,

1186
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:15,750
you go back to your camp.

1187
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:19,250
I'll go up to the village
to pick up my men.

1188
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:21,917
Of course, just try
to be reasonable,

1189
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:23,375
that's all I ask.

1190
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:29,500
(engine revving)

1191
01:08:39,834 --> 01:08:42,250
(gun firing)

1192
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:44,542
(rattling)

1193
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:52,291
You're a lunatic!

1194
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:55,208
You're a certifiably
crazy person.

1195
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:07,333
- You have to tell me Enjoro.

1196
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,500
You must trust me.

1197
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:09,834
I can help you.

1198
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,417
It was Nashar, wasn't it?

1199
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,500
(clanking)

1200
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:27,083
(door slamming)

1201
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,917
(squeaking)

1202
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:47,792
(speaking in Swahili)

1203
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,208
(roaring)

1204
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:25,458
(yelling)

1205
01:10:28,667 --> 01:10:29,917
Enjoro, wait.

1206
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:31,166
(speaking in Swahili)

1207
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,458
(drumming)

1208
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:39,333
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1209
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:41,959
(growling)

1210
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:42,792
(speaking in Swahili)

1211
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:43,917
(roaring)

1212
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:48,500
- Ho, ho, ho, ho
(speaking in Swahili).

1213
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:49,542
(growling)

1214
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,959
(screaming)

1215
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:58,250
(gentle flute music)

1216
01:10:58,375 --> 01:11:01,500
(speaking in Swahili)

1217
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:14,875
(mumbles)

1218
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,458
(roaring)

1219
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:22,834
(drumming)

1220
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,250
(speaking in Swahili)

1221
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:27,375
(mooing)

1222
01:11:30,959 --> 01:11:34,041
(shouting in Swahili)

1223
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,417
(dramatic music)

1224
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,667
(roaring)

1225
01:11:50,792 --> 01:11:53,917
(speaking in Swahili)

1226
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:59,250
(drumming and clanging music)

1227
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:26,959
(dog barking)

1228
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,709
(speaking in Swahili)

1229
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:54,208
(goat bleating)

1230
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:05,709
- Hear you were nearly
killed by that lion.

1231
01:13:05,834 --> 01:13:07,083
Serves you bloody right.

1232
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,375
- I was nowhere near the lion.

1233
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,542
It was Enjoro who
saved Nashar's life

1234
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:11,709
and he still won't talk to him.

1235
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:13,250
What's the matter
with these people?

1236
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,542
- Where is he?

1237
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:15,959
- I don't know.

1238
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:17,333
- How's Nashar?

1239
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:18,542
- He's over there.

1240
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:19,750
I tried to help but
they wouldn't let me.

1241
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,792
Women don't count
for much around here.

1242
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:25,417
- It isn't women, it's
insensitive interfering women.

1243
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:26,959
- You really feel
that way, don't you?

1244
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,500
- No, I'm enlightened.

1245
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:32,875
I get just as steamed off at
insensitive interfering men.

1246
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,083
(speaking in Swahili)

1247
01:13:56,834 --> 01:13:57,542
He'll be all right.

1248
01:13:57,667 --> 01:13:59,834
- What about Enjoro?

1249
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:04,458
- Obwa tells me Enjoro has
brought disgrace on his family.

1250
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:05,250
- His family?

1251
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:06,125
How?

1252
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:07,125
- Nashar's his half brother.

1253
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:09,250
Obwa's their father.

1254
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,667
- I had no idea.

1255
01:14:10,834 --> 01:14:12,792
- Now, don't tell me there's
something you didn't know.

1256
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:14,458
- Never mind.

1257
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,000
How disgraced?

1258
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:17,250
He acted as a true warrior.

1259
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:19,667
Isn't that what
all this is about?

1260
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:21,083
- What it's all about is cattle.

1261
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,291
With the Maasai, their
cattle come first.

1262
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,583
It's a sign of every man's
wealth, his influence,

1263
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:26,166
his honor.

1264
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:29,000
And Enjoro, in saving Nashar,
allowed a cattle to be killed.

1265
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,083
- Allowed?

1266
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:32,458
He risked his life
to save Nashar.

1267
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:34,000
- Diana, the Maasai
don't think that way.

1268
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,917
Cattle are their first priority.

1269
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:36,959
- That's ludicrous.

1270
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:38,333
- Is it?

1271
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,000
What about those little
scraps of paper called cash,

1272
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:42,125
that our countrymen,
yours and mine,

1273
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:44,125
cheat and kill for,
risk their lives

1274
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,792
running into burning
buildings for.

1275
01:14:45,917 --> 01:14:48,709
Is that any more
absurd than cattle?

1276
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:49,667
Look.

1277
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:54,250
(goat bleating)

1278
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:57,250
(mooing)

1279
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:09,917
Are you all right, Enjoro?

1280
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,750
(speaking in Swahili)

1281
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:15,750
They've trapped the lion.

1282
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:18,583
(dramatic music)

1283
01:15:21,959 --> 01:15:24,625
(engine revving)

1284
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:35,834
(growling)

1285
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:38,542
(ominous music)

1286
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:49,834
(speaking in Swahili)

1287
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:59,583
They've trapped the
old boy down in there.

1288
01:15:59,709 --> 01:16:02,333
Rather take him out in the open.

1289
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:12,000
(dramatic music)

1290
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:15,542
Enjoro!

1291
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:20,959
We can spot him better
from the edge of the gorge.

1292
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,834
(growling)

1293
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:32,834
(ominous drumming music)

1294
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:23,750
(roaring)

1295
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:32,750
(yelling)

1296
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,917
(growling)

1297
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,917
(dramatic music)

1298
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:55,875
(growling)

1299
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:02,458
(growling)

1300
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,000
- This is his last chance.

1301
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,083
He knows it.

1302
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:28,875
We can't take that
away from him.

1303
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,125
(growling)

1304
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:41,083
(roaring)

1305
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:55,917
(cheering)

1306
01:19:53,959 --> 01:19:56,166
(cheering)

1307
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:05,500
(chanting in Swahili)

1308
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:31,875
(clapping)

1309
01:20:32,834 --> 01:20:36,000
(chanting in Swahili)

1310
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,375
(cheering)

1311
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:08,083
- Well, he seems to
have solved his problem

1312
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:10,208
by himself thanks to you.

1313
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,917
Let's hope he's really
where he belongs.

1314
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:17,875
- Yeah, I'm gonna
miss him, though.

1315
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:20,500
- So will I.

1316
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,709
What happens now?

1317
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:28,333
- With what?

1318
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:29,291
- With us.

1319
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,417
- Oh, I don't know.

1320
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:33,625
Every time we agree
something else comes along.

1321
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,458
- (chuckles) Some
people might call that

1322
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:37,000
a relationship.

1323
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:38,583
- (chuckles) Yeah.

1324
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:42,166
Some people might
call it World War III.

1325
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:43,583
I, I have another problem.

1326
01:21:43,709 --> 01:21:44,792
- What's that?

1327
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:46,375
- I can't call you Tobias.

1328
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,834
That's a silly name.

1329
01:21:47,959 --> 01:21:49,542
- Call me anything you like.

1330
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,291
- How about Toby?

1331
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:52,834
- Except Toby, please.

1332
01:21:52,959 --> 01:21:53,834
- Oh, well, there, you see.

1333
01:21:53,959 --> 01:21:55,041
We can't even agree on that.

1334
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,959
What are we gonna do?

1335
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:02,750
- Well, for a start, why
don't we save time and expense

1336
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,709
and combine our two camps.

1337
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,041
- Oh sure, now
that Enjoro's gone,

1338
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:07,750
you're looking for a new cook.

1339
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:12,000
- (chuckles) Not
yours, heaven forbid.

1340
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:16,041
- Maybe we should just let
things stay the way they are

1341
01:22:16,166 --> 01:22:17,917
for the time being.

1342
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:18,834
- Why?

1343
01:22:19,875 --> 01:22:22,834
- Because you're changing
me and I don't like it.

1344
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,709
- Why?

1345
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:27,291
- Because I know who I am

1346
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:29,625
and what's important in my life.

1347
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:31,000
Everything you say,
everything you do

1348
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:35,291
is just totally opposite
from what I want.

1349
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:37,000
- What do you want?

1350
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,959
- To accomplish something.

1351
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,875
To make a difference.

1352
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:46,500
You're happy just letting
things go on around you.

1353
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:47,750
And you won't be satisfied

1354
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,208
until you've got me
doing the same thing.

1355
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,959
Well, I can't do that.

1356
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:54,083
It's against everything
I believe in.

1357
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:56,250
- All right.

1358
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,291
And if those carbon
tests are positive,

1359
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:05,500
if you really have
found the earliest man,

1360
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:07,458
you'll probably go
back to the States,

1361
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,291
to fame and fortune,

1362
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,000
book, lecture tour,

1363
01:23:11,125 --> 01:23:12,709
TV talk shows,

1364
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:15,041
cover of Time Magazine.

1365
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:17,041
- Would that be so bad?

1366
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,417
- That depends.

1367
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,875
If you don't care
that your earliest man

1368
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:23,500
may cost you your latest man.

1369
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:24,834
- You could come with me.

1370
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,166
- And do what?

1371
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:28,000
I belong in Africa.

1372
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:31,375
I'd be useless anywhere else
and I can't change that.

1373
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:33,500
- Another stalemate.

1374
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:35,875
(sad music)

1375
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,542
I'm sorry I slapped you.

1376
01:23:37,709 --> 01:23:40,041
- No, I shouldn't
have said what I did.

1377
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,542
I guess it's catching.

1378
01:23:41,709 --> 01:23:43,500
- From me you mean?

1379
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,000
- I don't think you've
ever stopped yourself

1380
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:48,417
from saying anything
in your entire life.

1381
01:23:48,542 --> 01:23:49,750
- You're wrong.

1382
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:55,500
(door slamming)

1383
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:57,458
I'm doing it right now.

1384
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:01,125
(engine revving)

1385
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,500
(speaking in Swahili)

1386
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:20,500
(groaning)

1387
01:24:42,959 --> 01:24:45,834
(light flute music)

1388
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:51,333
(crunching)

1389
01:25:31,542 --> 01:25:33,583
(mooing)

1390
01:25:43,542 --> 01:25:46,500
(light flute music)

1391
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,875
(speaking in Swahili)

1392
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,583
Something to show you.

1393
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:11,917
Enjoro delivered it
then he disappeared.

1394
01:26:17,959 --> 01:26:19,750
- It's quite good.

1395
01:26:19,834 --> 01:26:22,250
- He was dressed as a warrior.

1396
01:26:23,792 --> 01:26:24,917
- He's all right then?

1397
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,250
- Mmm hmm.

1398
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:27,625
What's all this?

1399
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:30,625
- Just packing up.

1400
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,250
We've just about exhausted
the Meerschaum in this area.

1401
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:34,667
- You're leaving?

1402
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:37,166
- Don't seem to have
a reason to stay.

1403
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,875
- You're gonna go look
for some more Meerschaum?

1404
01:26:38,959 --> 01:26:40,792
- No, I've had enough of that.

1405
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:42,709
I've got a chance to
do some construction.

1406
01:26:42,792 --> 01:26:44,166
A bridge near Mombasa.

1407
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:45,125
- Oh.

1408
01:26:50,834 --> 01:26:54,291
(airplane engine roaring)

1409
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:56,792
- You expecting anyone?

1410
01:26:56,917 --> 01:26:58,083
- Hmm unn, you?

1411
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:01,375
Well, let's go see who it is.

1412
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,208
- You go on.

1413
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:03,375
It'll be for you.

1414
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,417
I've got a lot to do here.

1415
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:08,625
(speaking in Swahili)

1416
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:36,375
(plane engine sputtering)

1417
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:42,041
- Calvin!

1418
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,500
- Ha, hey.

1419
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:44,458
- Miriam!

1420
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,417
It's so great to see you both.

1421
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:48,834
What are you doing here?

1422
01:27:48,959 --> 01:27:49,834
Why didn't you tell me?

1423
01:27:49,959 --> 01:27:50,917
- Well, it's a surprise.

1424
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:52,500
- What, what, what?

1425
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:53,625
- We brought a visitor.

1426
01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:54,500
- Yeah?

1427
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:55,375
- Well, he didn't exactly,

1428
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,959
he brought himself.

1429
01:27:58,667 --> 01:27:59,625
- Diana!

1430
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,834
- Oh, oh dear.

1431
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:05,959
Oh, Calvin.

1432
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:11,291
- This is Anna Latu,
the museum photographer.

1433
01:28:11,417 --> 01:28:13,000
- How do you do?

1434
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:15,083
- I had to come and
tell you personally.

1435
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:18,792
The carbon test of those
scrapings you sent,

1436
01:28:19,709 --> 01:28:22,542
are over three
million years old.

1437
01:28:22,667 --> 01:28:24,709
- Ohhh!
- Ah, you did it.

1438
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:28,166
- The young man who
brought them tells me

1439
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:29,667
you've assembled a whole skull.

1440
01:28:29,792 --> 01:28:32,250
Then, you've found the oldest,

1441
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,875
the oldest recorded human head.

1442
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:39,333
- Phenomenal.

1443
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:41,125
Well, (mumbling) training for.

1444
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,166
- [Miriam] This
is just wonderful.

1445
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:44,792
- Diana, come here, will you?

1446
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:49,208
I just want a picture of you
actually holding the skull.

1447
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,166
A record for posterity.

1448
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:54,333
(light piano music)

1449
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:01,750
- [Miriam] When did you find it?

1450
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:04,083
- Well, it's a long story but
if it hadn't been for Tobias...

1451
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:05,375
- Tobias?

1452
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:07,000
- Uh huh, it's a
silly name, isn't it?

1453
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:08,000
Mr. Williams.

1454
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:09,750
- Don't tell me it
was cooperative.

1455
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:10,875
- Very.

1456
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,041
I'm sure he'd love
to see both of you.

1457
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:14,125
Excuse me, Dr. Brinkman.

1458
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:18,333
- We'd like to photograph
you at the dig.

1459
01:29:18,417 --> 01:29:19,583
- Oh, you can photograph
anything you like.

1460
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:20,542
We have to go see a neighbor.

1461
01:29:20,667 --> 01:29:22,166
Excuse me, Dr. Brinkman.

1462
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:23,291
- Certainly.

1463
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:27,291
I'm just happy to gaze at him.

1464
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,375
- Asked Brinkman
to get in the act.

1465
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:37,166
- In on it?

1466
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:38,417
He wants to be it.

1467
01:29:38,542 --> 01:29:40,250
- I couldn't shake him
loose with a stick.

1468
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:43,000
- He may deposit one before
we get back to Nairobi.

1469
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:44,875
- I'm afraid he'd explode.

1470
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:45,709
- Calvin.

1471
01:29:45,834 --> 01:29:46,583
Tobias?

1472
01:29:47,959 --> 01:29:48,750
Tobias?

1473
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:51,500
Hmm.

1474
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,166
(speaking in Swahili)

1475
01:30:04,792 --> 01:30:07,792
(audience shouting)

1476
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:16,792
(speaking in German)

1477
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:18,709
Dr. Firestone, could
you tell us please,

1478
01:30:18,834 --> 01:30:21,500
how long the search
has taken you.

1479
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,000
- Well, about three years.

1480
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:24,792
And there were a few
problems en route,

1481
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:27,125
but I always, I always
thought he was out there

1482
01:30:27,291 --> 01:30:28,500
waiting for me.

1483
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:31,083
- What problems in
particular did you encounter?

1484
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:35,083
- (chuckles) Well, bad
weather, ran out of money,

1485
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:37,250
not getting the proper permits.

1486
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:38,542
- And, another question?

1487
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:40,875
(shouting)

1488
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:46,458
- Dr. Firestone, Toby
Williams, London Times.

1489
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:47,583
- You're not the London Times.

1490
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:49,000
I'm from the London Times.

1491
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,959
- Shut it and sit down.

1492
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:54,625
- Excuse me, Mr. Williams.

1493
01:30:54,792 --> 01:30:57,000
What was that first name again?

1494
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:57,875
- Toby.

1495
01:30:58,834 --> 01:31:00,083
- I see.

1496
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:03,250
- Doctor, having found a
three million-year-old man,

1497
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,333
have you considered
that there might be

1498
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:06,500
another man out there?

1499
01:31:06,667 --> 01:31:07,417
- Oh yes.

1500
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,625
But the question is where?

1501
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,792
- There are encouraging
reports about some old bones

1502
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,917
in Mombasa just waiting
for you to dig them up.

1503
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:19,792
- I've heard about
those old bones.

1504
01:31:19,917 --> 01:31:22,917
But how can I be sure
they're the same ones?

1505
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:24,667
- Bones don't change, Doctor.

1506
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:25,792
People do.

1507
01:31:25,959 --> 01:31:26,667
- Do they?

1508
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:30,667
Do they really?

1509
01:31:30,792 --> 01:31:34,417
- Why don't you come to
Mombasa and find out?

1510
01:31:35,667 --> 01:31:38,417
(crowd shouting)

1511
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:40,917
- You at the back,
in the turban.

1512
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,709
- Jaga Sim, Punjab Times.

1513
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:45,375
Dr. Firestone, what, in your
opinion, is still to be found

1514
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:47,625
in your field of expertise?

1515
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:51,375
- Hmm.

1516
01:31:52,417 --> 01:31:53,208
- Diana?

1517
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:55,834
- The answer is yes.

1518
01:31:55,959 --> 01:31:56,667
- [Man In Audience] That's
a very strange answer.

1519
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,500
- Yes?

1520
01:31:57,625 --> 01:31:58,333
I don't understand.

1521
01:31:58,458 --> 01:32:00,166
(audience talking)

1522
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:01,083
- Yes.

1523
01:32:04,542 --> 01:32:05,625
Yes, yes, yes.

1524
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:09,000
- Yes, yes, yes, what?

1525
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:11,583
- (chuckling) Mombasa Man,

1526
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:13,959
definitely going to
be my next project.

1527
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:15,291
(clicking)

1528
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:17,583
(shouting)

1529
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:21,375
(dramatic music)

1530
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:27,750
(singing in Swahili)

1531
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:31,208
- The limo will take you
straight to the airport.

1532
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:32,667
- Oh, it's wonderful,
Dr. Brinkman.

1533
01:32:32,792 --> 01:32:33,542
- Bye bye.

1534
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:34,333
- Bye.

1535
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:35,208
- Bye bye.

1536
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,083
- Bye.

1537
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:53,125
(laughing)
