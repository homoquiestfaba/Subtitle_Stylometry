1
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:13,843
So is everybody this lonely
when they're in love?

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:22,989
They embrace a pain that's
deeper than the shadows?

3
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:36,130
It's all to make us shine,
I just know it...

4
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:40,903
I loveyou, I loveyou,

5
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:45,340
I gaze atyou with my heart...

6
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:50,083
I believe in you, I believe in you,

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:54,543
even on the coldest ofnights.

8
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:17,277
I call out toyou with my tears,

9
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:21,781
but I don't need any promises...

10
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:30,689
That's the precious strength
you've given to me...

11
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,862
Van! Snap out ofit, Van!

12
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,297
What's wrong, Hitomi?

13
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,730
Van's in trouble!

14
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,157
Van! Open your eyes!

15
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,960
Van!

16
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,876
Van, snap out ofit!

17
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,579
Stop! You might not
be able to come back,

18
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,809
just like that time
with the Doppelganger!

19
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:55,682
Hitomi!

20
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,517
Ifwe don't do
something, Van's gonna...

21
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,883
We're gonna lose Van!

22
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,680
No!

23
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,189
Hitomi...

24
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,149
Van, where areyou?!

25
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,043
Van!

26
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,826
Van, wait!

27
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,071
Van!

28
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,970
It stopped!

29
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,806
This isn't Heaven, I guess...

30
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,494
Van, let's go back.

31
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,663
Everybody's waiting.

32
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,908
Van?

33
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,195
What?

34
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,141
Van! Snap out ofit!

35
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,604
It's already been three miets.

36
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,539
We have to bring at least
<i>Hitomi</i> around, or they'll both...

37
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,200
No!

38
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,313
Hey, you dumb broad!
Don't give up!

39
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,982
Getyour act together and
bring Van back here!

40
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,075
Hey! Areyou listening to me?!

41
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,988
Lord Van!

42
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,525
Merle?

43
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,462
Lord Van! Come back!

44
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,861
Merle!

45
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:47,871
Van!

46
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,171
Van! <i>Fly!</i>

47
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,200
Van!

48
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,158
He's alive!

49
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,858
Lord Van...!

50
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,133
Merle...

51
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,508
It's all because ofyou...

52
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,533
Thanks!

53
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,176
You're all incompetent.

54
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:12,552
Guimel... Dallet... Shesta...
Gatty... Viole...

55
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:17,759
Where's the glory in dying
in a fight like that?

56
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,005
<i>Don'tleavemealone!</i>

57
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,672
<i>Don'tleavemealone!</i>

58
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,353
Alone...

59
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:56,502
<i>With the conquestofFreid,</i>
<i>the PowerSpotis ours.</i>

60
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,163
<i>However...</i>

61
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,239
The dragon, Lord?

62
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,036
<i>Indeed.</i>

63
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:07,441
<i>The fate ofthe dragonisshrouded</i>
<i>inmist, growingeverdimmer.</i>

64
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:12,518
Leave it to me, Majesty.
My next plan is already in motion.

65
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,147
<i>Capture the dragon!</i>

66
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,681
Why?

67
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,925
Why does my hand shake
when I hold my sword?

68
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,586
Van...

69
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,192
Allen?

70
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,901
Don't worry about Van.

71
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,768
But he's been like that
ever since the fight.

72
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,438
This is a trial that must be overcome
by all who would be swordsmen.

73
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,042
I speak from experience.

74
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:18,079
Vanity and arrogance draw
you into a haze offear.

75
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:24,113
Areyou the boywho's been picking
fights with swordsmen lately?

76
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:29,161
Ifyou're scared offighting me,
leave all your money and get lost!

77
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,031
Ifyou do, I'll spareyour life.

78
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:36,435
You seem to have some skill.
What's your name?

79
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,604
Allen Schezar.

80
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,196
Come on!

81
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,840
Your technique is excellent.

82
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,447
But...

83
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,474
I see no promise in a swordsman
who thinks only oftechnique.

84
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,142
Kill me!

85
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,521
Kill me, damn it!

86
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,891
Why areyou in such a hurry to die?

87
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,128
I have no family and no home.
My sword is all I have.

88
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,263
How can I go on living ifI lost?!

89
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,960
Swordsmanship isn't about
strength. Or technique.

90
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,303
What's important comes from within.

91
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,863
It's <i>yourself</i>thatyou must hone!

92
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:18,237
That was how I met
Balgus. My master.

93
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:23,082
He showed me the light
when I was all but lost.

94
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,651
Mastering the sword means
mastering yourself.

95
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:29,155
But I still haven't come close
to matching his skill.

96
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,520
I...

97
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,384
That's not true.

98
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:38,088
You're amazing and you're strong.
And you're nice, too.

99
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,699
I...

100
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,736
I don't know anything about
swords orwhatever,

101
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,331
and I don't think he'd listen
to anything I said...

102
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,671
But I'm sure he'd listen toyou.

103
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:55,642
You're terrific, and
everybody looks up toyou.

104
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,945
And I likeyou.

105
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,778
Anyway, ifyou could help
Van, that'd be great!

106
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,583
You like me, huh?

107
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,494
Sometimes you're quite
the little fiend, Hitomi.

108
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,465
The mysterious power of Hitomi,
the girl from the Mystic Moon...

109
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,141
Van, in whose veins flows
The blood of Draconians...

110
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,473
Escaflowne...

111
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,341
And Zaibach, which is
after the Power Spot...

112
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:37,655
Strange occurrences
happening one after another...

113
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,655
This is driving me nuts!
I know I almost have it!

114
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:46,665
Um... Dryden? Thankyou.

115
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,064
Forwhat?

116
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,532
Spare me the pleasantries.

117
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,140
It doesn't costyou anything to bow.

118
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,767
What areyou getting at?

119
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:00,574
I came to apologize for my poor manners
because I was wrong aboutyou!

120
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,614
Yeah, that's moreyour style!

121
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:12,055
I have ulterior motives, ofcourse.
I'll do anything to get a girl's attention.

122
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,325
But I...

123
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,797
Allen, right? I don't mind.

124
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:22,700
I always get what I want.

125
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:34,538
<i>Anyway...</i> Instead ofthat, maybe
you could do something for me.

126
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:41,118
This is my father's final logbook.
The one from his study.

127
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,281
This is it!

128
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,058
Is something like that really useful?

129
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,626
It sure is!

130
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,897
This may solve the mystery
that's at the heart ofall this.

131
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,065
Mystery?

132
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,498
Atlantis.

133
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,402
Atlantis?

134
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,939
My old man used to tell me
about howyour father...

135
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,875
...was searching for the
secret treasure ofAtlantis.

136
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,173
I'm gonna borrow this for a bit.

137
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,938
The man's a <i>celebrity...</i>

138
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:13,877
He's embarrassing me,
even out in this frontier.

139
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:20,225
It's a bargain compared to what
he paid to repair Escaflowne.

140
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,394
You're right, ofcourse.

141
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,202
Why did I have to
go and say that?

142
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,243
Now he must think I'm some
kind ofgroupie or something...

143
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:40,875
Hitomi?

144
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,737
Millerna?

145
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:47,884
Um, I was wondering ifI could ask
your opinion about a friend ofmine.

146
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,249
Sure.

147
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,826
She has a boyfriend,

148
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:58,263
but she found out that he's really a
playboy, and he even fathered a child.

149
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,466
What ajerk!

150
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,234
just listen until I'm through.

151
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,168
Sorry.

152
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:08,807
But this girl met another man
who's rich and seems really nice...

153
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,002
...and even told her
that he loved her.

154
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,569
Talk about obvious... Moron.

155
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,449
And?

156
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,020
What doyou think she should do?

157
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,487
What she should <i>do?</i>

158
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:26,225
IfI found out that he had a kid
while I was going out with him,

159
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,523
I'd never talk to him again.

160
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,195
Why not?

161
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,165
Well, he's a disgrace
to men everywhere.

162
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,565
It's like he'd go out with <i>anybody.</i>

163
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,465
But he's a wonderful man...

164
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,040
Isn't the other guy, too?

165
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,275
I guess he's pretty good looking.

166
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,378
And he'd give her love
and money, right?

167
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,280
Then I'd say she should go with <i>him.</i>

168
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,748
But that's so calculated...

169
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,685
What ifshe did what the guy is doing
and went out with both ofthem?

170
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,053
That's so immoral!

171
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:58,057
Or she could give up on both.
She could be the tragic heroine!

172
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,252
You'rejoking!
Don't make fun of--

173
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:05,965
Anyway, what about the feelings
she already has for one ofthem?

174
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,567
Yeah, I guess that's a problem

175
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:14,028
I guess it's most natural
to go with your feelings.

176
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,204
Your feelings...

177
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,909
I could do a reading.

178
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,413
You know, to see which
one is best for her.

179
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,048
I'm pretty accurate when
it's for somebody else.

180
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,744
Areyou stupid or something?
Who cares aboutyour readings?

181
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,985
Beforeyou do a reading
for somebody else,

182
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,090
try sorting outyour
<i>own</i> feelings first!

183
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,925
My own feelings?

184
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,361
Who doyou like?
Van orAllen?

185
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,664
Who's it gonna be?

186
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,306
Allen's... the one that I like.

187
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,041
I'm just... worried... about Van.

188
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,685
<i>"Worried"?Is thatreallyall?</i>

189
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,824
Then stay away from Van!

190
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,258
Allen's out ofyour league.

191
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,123
I don't get it.

192
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,732
That's it, isn't it, Sister?

193
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,927
I can't believe we
ran into them here...

194
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,304
Must be our luck.

195
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,275
Let's go introduce ourselves and
get a present for Lord Folken.

196
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,867
Sounds good.

197
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,156
...but then my old lady found us.

198
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,953
just wasn'tyour day, I guess.

199
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,662
<i>There'sa Guymelefcalled</i>
<i>"Escaflowne"here, right?</i>

200
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,064
Send it out.

201
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,725
<i>Ifyoudon'tdo asyou're told...</i>

202
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,995
...you're all dead.

203
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,774
Boss! It's Zaibach!
Zaibach's Guymelefs are here!

204
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,942
What?!

205
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,077
- Van!

206
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,845
Don't! You shouldn't
try to pilot ityet!

207
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,180
Lord Van!

208
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,204
Here goes...

209
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,158
Van went out?

210
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,703
There it is.

211
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,603
Let's take it out.

212
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,640
A woman?

213
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,872
His stomach's wide open!

214
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,404
What's with him?

215
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,065
He's scared.

216
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,543
Dilandau's group got
taken out by <i>this</i> guy?

217
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,045

221
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,238
Merle...

222
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,142
<i>Whatapartypooper.</i>

00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,166
Merle.

227
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,597
Lord Van...

I've got it! I've <i>got</i> it!

233
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,501
just as I thought, all the mysteries
lie in the Mystic Valley!

234
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,690
The Mystic Valley?

235
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,421
The legendary place where the
Draconians are said to live.

236
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:59,044
Blue searchlights meet
beyond the Moon...

237
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:07,585
Yeah, my angel who came
flying down, who areyou?

238
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,430
The doors ofdestiny are
opening before us,

239
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,233
<i>solet'sjustfallin love.</i>

240
00:22:15,233 --> 00:00:00,000
