6
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,317
Okay, now here's
the real creepy thing.

7
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,382
They only eat this beef,
and it has to be bloody.

8
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,223
- Yuck.
- I know.

9
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,490
And if it isn't
dripping in blood,

10
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,362
then Professor Fuller's all,
"There's not enough blood,"

11
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,367
and then I'm all,
"Sorry."

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,868
Gotcha.

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,497
But I figure, if we're making
seven bucks an hour,

14
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,973
they can have dinner
and a movie for all I care.

15
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,569
Tell me about it.
Does Professor Fuller get mad a lot?

16
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,977
Only when the bats
don't get fed.

17
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,175
And when he gets mad,
he gets mad

18
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,048
in that weird-professor-in-
his-sweater-genius kind of way.

19
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,520
- That is so sexy.
- Isn't it?

20
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,920
( electronic beeping )

21
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,392
Wow, it's creepy in here.

22
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,528
What's with the lighting?

23
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,540
Bats like to sleep
in caves during the day,

24
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,906
so this makes them feel
right at home.

25
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,569
Okay.

26
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,873
They can't get out,
can they?

27
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,010
Nah, they're locked up
nice and tight.

28
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,487
I wouldn't want these
freaky boys going anywhere.

29
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,286
- You see this?
- Uh-huh.

30
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,350
It means they're hearing
this sound

31
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,327
that makes them
all calm and blissful,

32
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,387
Iike they're listening
to an 'N Sync album,

33
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,797
but only they can hear it.
Now watch.

34
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,293
When it's time
for them to be fed,

35
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,168
you push this.

36
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,707
( bats squealing )

37
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,139
Oh, wow.

38
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,546
Now they're hearing another
sound only they can hear.

39
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,016
It tells them
they're about to be fed.

40
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,519
If you don't turn it on,

41
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,284
the professor's all,
"Why didn't you turn it on? "

42
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,326
And then I'm all,
"Sorry."

43
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,954
Got it.

44
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,021
Watch.

45
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,400
Come on.
Want it?

46
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,232
Want it?

47
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,473
They're so gross.

48
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,668
( screams )

49
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,408
Ahh! Get it off of me!
Get it off!

50
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,416
( screaming )

51
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,687
I've never seen
such a nervous cat, Dr. Winslow.

52
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,633
It just breaks my heart
to think of Dinah's suffering.

53
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,536
Well, she doesn't look
that nervous to me right now.

54
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,471
No, no, she is.

55
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,009
Just look
at the tension.

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,944
Why don't we bring her over here
and I'll have a look at her?

57
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,176
You know,
I was holding her close

58
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,686
and I could feel
her little heart racing.

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,422
Do you feel it?

60
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,960
I'm trying.

61
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,586
Can you help her,
Doctor?

62
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,131
Have you tried
massage?

63
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,064
No.

64
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,467
Not too rough-- just enough
to relieve the tension.

65
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,301
- Ohh.
- ( cat purring )

66
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,308
Ohh.

67
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,503
( laughs )

68
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,808
You see, she's starting
to relax already.

69
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,509
You have to touch
with females, John.

70
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,245
( laughs )

71
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,877
Thanks.

72
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,253
The Apple Blossom Dance
is this weekend.

73
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,518
Oh, I know.

74
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,617
There'll be a lot
of single women there.

75
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,219
I'll be there,
gettin' down...

76
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,322
and gettin' funky.

77
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,932
I'm not sure I'm quite ready
for funky just yet.

78
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,470
How long has it been?

79
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,234
Almost three years
since the funeral.

80
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,711
Well, you can't live
in Heartbreak Hotel forever, John.

81
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,146
I'll try
to remember that.

82
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,709
It just jumped into my hair
and attacked me.

83
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,551
I was there,
Professor Fuller--

84
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,181
I literally
saw it happen.

85
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,489
It bit me in the back of my head
and it wouldn't stop bleeding.

86
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,825
I used like,
a half a box of Band-Aids.

87
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,922
A completely
natural reaction.

88
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,696
The saliva of blood-feeding bats
contains an anti-coagulant.

89
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,465
- Anti-what?
- Anti-coagulant.

90
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,770
It prevents blood from clotting
and closing up the wound.

91
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,707
Yuck.

92
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,610
They're very efficient
little eating machines,

93
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,272
when you stop
and think about it.

94
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,512
I don't want to think about it.
Someone should do something.

95
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,278
Perhaps if you kept your hair
out of the cages in the future?

96
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,655
No, I mean something
more than that,

97
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,126
Iike tell my parents
or the Dean or something.

98
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,764
Diane, have a seat.

99
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,765
You're in my Biology 1 01 class,
aren't you?

100
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,100
Yeah.

101
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,106
If we were to keep this
among ourselves,

102
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,075
without involving
people on the outside,

103
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,136
people who might not share
our love of science,

104
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,205
I would express
my gratitude

105
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,910
by making sure
your final grade is an A.

106
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,748
What about Heather?

107
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,614
Her too.

108
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,159
Deal!

109
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,296
( wings flutter )

110
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,166
( wings flutter )

111
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,945
( chimes ringing )

112
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,851
( ringing )

113
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,093
What was Scottsville like
before the invasion?

114
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,724
What invasion?

115
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,259
The invasion of the young,
upwardly-mobile urban professional

116
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,202
seeking a slice
of the small town life!

117
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,800
- That invasion.
- You're not helping, Dad.

118
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,106
Come on, I need something
for my documentary.

119
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,580
Genny, I'm your father,
I'm not a sound-byte.

120
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,209
Please, just tell me something
about how Scottsville used to be,

121
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,413
before I was born,
back in the olden days.

122
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,718
Let's see if I can remember
back that far.

123
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,457
Okay, the town moved slower.

124
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,463
People took their time
and everybody knew each other.

125
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,726
Did the town have
a mega-mart back then?

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,564
No mega-marts,
just regular sized ones.

127
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,764
And when you went to the movies,
they didn't have 21 screens,

128
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,535
- just one.
- One!?

129
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,405
That's totally vintage.

130
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,274
Did you have a TV back then?

131
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,872
No, on Saturday nights,
we used to sit around in loincloths,

132
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,940
and beat big rocks
with sticks.

133
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,110
( scoffs )

134
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,382
Man:
Hey, Professor!

135
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,428
- Oh, hello, Al.
- Working late?

136
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,964
It seems I get my best work
done late at night.

137
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,555
Just like your bats.

138
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,260
Excuse me?

139
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,701
You get your best work done
at night just like your bats.

140
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,101
Oh.
( chuckles )

141
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,185
( squeaking )

142
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,668
- ( electronic beeping )
- ( lock clicks )

143
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,573
( bats squeaking )

144
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,705
( whistling )

145
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,148
( distant yell )

146
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,472
So nice of you
to stop by, Logan.

147
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,337
( muffled )
Thank you, Mr. W.

148
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,377
But maybe your parents would enjoy
your company this evening.

149
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,209
No way.
They hate having me around.

150
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,045
- How would you know?
- They said.

151
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,278
"Logan, we hate
having you around."

152
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,378
Oh, I'm sure they didn't mean that
in a negative way.

153
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,685
- Genny: All set.
- Tell him what you're gonna call it.

154
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,850
You're gonna love this.

155
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,292
"Scottsville,
Town without Pity."

156
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,263
I love it! Channel 1 2
is going to run it, definitely.

157
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,567
"Look up the words, 'perfect
small town' in the dictionary,

158
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,162
and you'll probably find
a picture of Scottsville there.

159
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,640
For years, this small,
uncomplicated town

160
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,042
was the perfect place to live,
work, and raise your family.

161
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,139
Then suddenly,
catastrophe struck.

162
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,741
Serenity was replaced
with urban blight--

163
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,015
superstores, strip malls,
junk housing.

164
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,353
All thanks to a man
named Carl Hart."

165
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,292
- Honey, we could get sued.
- Shhh.

166
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:06,627
"Hart gets property by foreclosing
on small family-owned farms,

167
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,724

through his finance company.

168
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,666
Is it legal?

169
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,228
- Maybe it is on paper--"
- We're definitely gonna get sued.

170

174
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,680

at its max.

176
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,222
And it's all been
brought to you by--

177
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,919
Carl Hart,
the Duke of Doom."

178
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,121
The Duke of Doom?!

179
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,857
I only wrote
the first half of that.

180
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,298
Genny: "And whenever things get
too messy for Hart to handle,

181
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,531
he calls on his one-man,
personal police force..."

182
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,799
Get that camera
out of my face!

183
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,068
Gimme it! Gimme it!

184
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,167
I'm gonna break it!
Get back here!

185
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,643
( giggling )

186
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,578
"... a low rent, rent-a-cop,

187
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,912
Louis the enforcer."

188
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,746
- Now wait just a minute!
- Shhh!

189
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,920
Genny:
"What have we lost?

190
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,651
Oh, not much.
Just our way of life.

191
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,284
Before Hart..."

192
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,386
People took their time
and everybody knew each other.

193
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,364
I ended it with you, Daddy.

194
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,526
Oh, great! I'm on camera.
Why don't we call

195
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,662
your grandma and ask her
if she's got something to say.

196
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,139
Then we can all
be named in the lawsuit.

197
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,345
Heather:
He must have asked me

198
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,350
to the Apple Blossom Dance
a dozen times.

199
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,387
And I was all, "Which part of no
don't you understand? "

200
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,285
Diane:
What'd he do?

201
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,756
He started dancing around,
showing me his cool moves,

202
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,122
so I'd be all,

203
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,491
"I've got to go to the dance
with Mr. Smooth."

204
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,494
Gross.

205
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,360
He was wearing sandals
with socks.

206
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,366
- Eww.
- Sad.

207
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,232
( screaming )

208
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,873
- ( police radio chatter )
- Howard, you're a professional.

209
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,806
You're supposed to be used
to this kind of thing.

210
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,572
But, Ally,
it's just that--

211
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,170
I've never seen
a dead person before.

212
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,113
Not even at a funeral.

213
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,050
When my grandmother died, I was 1 2.
I didn't go to the wake.

214
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,212
I stayed home. My mother
was furious, but I told her,

215
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,279
"I don't care.
You can punish me all you want to.

216
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,793
I'm not going to Nana's funeral."
That's what we called her.

217
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,260
Howard, why don't you wait
in the patrol car,

218
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,194
and see if Chief Taylor
radios in?

219
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,166
Really? Can I?

220
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,963
Whew! Yeah.

221
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,628
That'd be, um...

222
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,535
Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.

223
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,506
And if anything
comes in, I'll...

224
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,334
I'll find someone
to tell you.

225
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,442
Whoo. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

226
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,724
Hello, I'm Detective Parks.

227
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,317
Are you the two lab assistants
who discovered the body?

228
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,694
Yes, we were going
to feed the bats, and--

229
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,892
I'm in training.

230
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,492
And we found Professor Fuller
just like this.

231
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,697
When's the last time
you saw the professor?

232
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,707
Yesterday,
when he yelled at me.

233
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,402
I need you to stick around.

234
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,842
I want to talk to each of you
separately. Okay?

235
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,436
- Okay.
- Okay.

236
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,177
I need a list of everybody
who was here last night.

237
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,446
- I'd like to take a look.
- Heather: Don't!

238
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,147
What happened to him,
it's gross.

239
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,690
- It's horrible!
- Thanks, ladies,

240
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,055
but I worked homicide
in Los Angeles for nine years.

241
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,923
Trust me,
I've seen everything.

242
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,253
Whoa!

243
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,800
Do you think
we still get our A's?

244
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,077
- Hi!
- Oooh!

245
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,120
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

246
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,952
- Are you Detective Parks?
- Yes.

247
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,551
I'm John Winslow. I'm the town's
animal control officer.

248
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,026
Well, actually
I'm a veterinarian,

249
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,566
but the animal control thing
is just part-time.

250
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,602
You know, until they can
find someone else

251
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,296
who's willing to do the job.

252
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:09,398
Henry-- Henry Banks
used to do the job before me,

253
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,444
and he answered a complaint
about a boa constrictor

254
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,979
in some woman's basement--
Well, I guess he and the woman

255
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,813
hit it off together.
They ran off to Mexico.

256
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,513
No one knows what happened
to the boa constrictor.

257
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,921
Is there any particular reason
why you're here?

258
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,722
Uh, bats. Professor Fuller
had hundreds of them.

259
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,628
And if they had rabies
or any other disease,

260
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,757
then it's a case
for animal control.

261
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,858
- Is this where they were kept?
- ( sputtering )

262
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,166
Can you not touch that?
This is a crime scene.

263
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,537
Oh. And you think
maybe the victim

264
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,337
was killed by that door?

265
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,776
There could be fingerprints.

266
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,576
Can you really get a fingerprint
off a bar that small?

267
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,948
We'll never know, will we,
now that you've touched it?

268
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,852
Did you come down here
to see about missing bats,

269
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,050
or to get your greasy fingerprints
all over potential evidence?

270
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,923
I think you might
have your dates mixed up.

271
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,259
Mean and Angry Day
is tomorrow.

272
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,165
Today is Be Nice To
The Animal Control Guy Day.

273
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,601
Everyone knows that Fuller
was doing bat research.

274
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,231
He had over 500 of them,
and now they're gone.

275
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,537
And I've got to look into it.
It's my job.

276
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,474
I'm also here to do my job,

277
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,742
which is slightly more relevant
than being the town dogcatcher.

278
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,182
- Dogcatcher?!
- Look, Fuller is dead,

279
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,082
and someone let
all his bats out.

280
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,984
What this case needs
is a criminologist,

281
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:34,082
someone who is trained in homicide
and accident investigation,

282
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,094
someone who is not going to
contaminate the evidence,

283
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,325
- with-- whatever.
- Fine. I'll just go then.

284
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,061
- That would be better.
- I'll come back and do my job

285
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,296
- after you've finished your job.
- Good, yes, thanks. Goodbye.

286
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,033
I'll try not to touch
anything on the way out.

287
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,974
Certainly wouldn't want to
contaminate the crime scene.

288
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,204
Not any more
than you already have.

289
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,981
Are you sure you don't
need any help?

290
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,313
I can manage.

291
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,564
( rustling )

292
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,745
( wings flapping )

293
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,621
( rustling )

294
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,262
Oh! Ohh.

295
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,604
- Howard, you scared me to death.
- Sorry.

296
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,667
How was it?

297
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,645
Was it gory?

298
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,614
You know what? Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

299
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,846
Good, because after spending
all day in there,

300
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,319
I don't really
want to tell you.

301
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,380
How'd he die?
It was an accident, wasn't it?

302
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,323
I don't think so.

303
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,624
The body was so badly mutilated
you couldn't see his face.

304
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,721
Accident victims
don't look like that.

305
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,823
I-- Fuller was murdered.

306
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,765
Weird.

307
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,668
I wonder where
those bats went.

308
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,805
( squeaking )

309
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,079
Oh, it looks like Mr. Hart.

310
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,697
( dog barking )

311
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,129
- Stop him!
- I'm trying, sir.

312
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,104
Omar, shut up.
Shut up!

313
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,663
What's wrong with this dog?

314
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,902
I don't get it.
He only acts this way with you.

315
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,673
Tell him to bark at the vandals
who damage my homes,

316
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,646
not the guy who signs
your paycheck.

317
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,047
Maybe he's seen what you pay me.
( laughs )

318
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,677
Sorry.
Bad dog, Omar.

319
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,516
- ( dog whines )
- Stupid mutt.

320
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,112
Look, Louis,

321
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,318
I got a truck coming with a couple
thousand sheets of drywall,

322
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,623
6:00 a.m., tomorrow morning.
If they're late,

323
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,720
- I need you to be here.
- Will do.

324
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,233
Whoever signs for them,
I want to count each and every sheet.

325
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,963
2,000 sheets of drywall?!

326
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,971
You better believe
I will.

327
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,733
( laughs )

328
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,141
I never built this many homes
in one development.

329
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,146
And they're beauties.

330
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,342
Real beauties-- especially that
three-bedroom Key Largo model.

331
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,317
Now, that's a real honey.

332
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,719
Enjoy it now, because you're never
going to live in one.

333
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,984
Listen, Willy Kramer's
supposed to

334
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,117
vacate his farm
sometime soon.

335
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,958
He may need a little bit of,
uh... persuasion.

336
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,362
- Louis: That's my specialty.
- ( cell phone rings )

337
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,127
Hold on.

338
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,294
Hello?

339
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,961
What?!

340
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,563
"Police Seek Clues
in Professor's Murder"

341
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,303
They can't print that!
It's the Apple Festival this week.

342
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,835
I got 1 00 home buyers
coming to town, for--

343
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,145
If that thing hits the stands,
I-- Just don't move!

344
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,584
Don't move,
I'll be there.

345
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,383
- ( phone beeps )
- I gotta go.

346
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,424
Is there anything
I could do for you, Mr. Hart?

347
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,689
Yeah, try buying every copy
of tomorrow's "Scottsville Journal."

348
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,162
It'll take a lot of quarters,
but--

349
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,582
- ( dog whines )
- I know.

350
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,551
He's a jerk.

351
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,087
( thud )

352
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,981
You hear that?

353
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,861
Me too.

354
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,089
( wood creaking )

355
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,361
( thuds )

356
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,896
( squeaking )

357
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,649
Who's in there?!

358
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,777
( squealing )

359
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,594
Hart: I can't believe that thing
almost hit the stands.

360
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,824
If I had gotten there
five minutes later,

361
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,560
I would have been
a dead man.

362
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,864
How'd you get the newspaper
to stop the presses?

363
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,496
I threatened to pull
my advertising.

364
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,472
I'll bet that got their
attention.

365
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,473
( chuckling )

366
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,873
It's not funny!

367
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,037
It's Apple Festival week,
the Apple Blossom Dance is Friday.

368
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,673
My daughter is going to be
crowned Miss Apple Blossom.

369
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,649
How do you know
she's going to win?

370
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,653
Because I'm making you
the judge.

371
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,712
You listen to me, Sam,

372
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,725
if people thought there was some
sort of killer loose in this town,

373
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,693
I couldn't give
my homes away.

374
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,854
And I can't go running down
to the newspaper every time

375
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,899
they're thinking about running
a headline that can ruin me!

376
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,627
Yeah, I know. I know.

377
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,534
I don't want to know what
happened to this clown Fuller,

378
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,404
I don't care! I just want
this investigation stopped!

379
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,146
Or would you rather
not get paid your cut?

380
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,619
I'll take care
of the problem.

381
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,215
I promise.

382
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,271
I'm gonna take a nap.

383
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,036
( whimpers )

384
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,577
No, you don't get to nap.
You stay awake and watch these houses.

385
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,263
( squealing )

386
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,636
( whines )

387
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,610
( snoring )

388
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,820
( chattering )

389
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,221
( dog yowls )

390
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,027
( growling )

391
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,594
( whimpering )

392
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,466
I got one more problem that
needs to be taken care of.

393
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,876
I want you to evict Willy Kramer
from his farm tomorrow night.

394
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,314
Kramer? No,
he's still got 30 days.

395
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,749
I got his contract
here somewhere.

396
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,754
He doesn't become delinquent
until the 23rd of next month.

397
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,052
Forget that-- I've got
an amendment to the contract

398
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,991
with an eviction date
as of... tomorrow.

399
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,186
You got a judge
to change the date?

400
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,722
No. I got an inkjet printer
to change the date.

401
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,770
- ( laughs )
- You what?

402
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,305
- You can't--
- Don't tell me what I can't do!

403
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,341
I got more than 30
home sales pending,

404
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,774
and every contract's
got a clause promising

405
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,642
a golf course. Kramer's farm
is that golf course.

406
00:26:55,714 --> 00:27:00,014
The entire new development goes
bust unless I can deliver on this.

407
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,699
Louis: You're not going to
charge me for this, are ya, Doc?

408
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,530
- No.
- Good, 'cause I'm not some doctor

409
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,968
that makes a gazillion bucks
a week, like you.

410
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,506
I'm just an honest
working man.

411
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,565
That's why I'm not
charging you for it.

412
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,406
See, I really didn't
know what to do,

413
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,003
and someone at work said this
was something for animal control.

414
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,980
No, you did the right thing.

415
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,813
So you say Omar
was killed by bats?

416
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,218
Hundreds of 'em.
Maybe even thousands.

417
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,915
How is it that
you weren't attacked?

418
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,584
I was asleep in my truck.

419
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,719
So how'd you see the bats?

420
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,023
I woke up!

421
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,065
Listen, Doc, are you gonna
give me the third degree

422
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,623
or are you gonna
look at the dog?

423
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,226
I-- uh-- I'm gonna
look at the dog.

424
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,703
Definitely look at the dog.

425
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,999
Let's just see here.

426
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,340
I got to warn you, Doc,
these bats,

427
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,403
they really went
to town on Omar.

428
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,448
What they left,
it ain't pretty.

429
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,449
- Wow!
- Told ya!

430
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,052
Okay, look,

431
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,684
I'm gonna have to do
a few tests.

432
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,250
Can you leave him here
for a couple of days?

433
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,729
You can keep him forever.
He won't do me no good dead!

434
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,027
No, I guess not.

435
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,003
Must be kind of upset
about losing Omar.

436
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,098
Yeah, I'm upset. Now I gotta
go buy me another dog.

437
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,074
- Right.
- ( door shuts )

438
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,978
- ( knocking )
- Come in.

439
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,156
You wanted
to see me, Chief?

440
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,623
Yeah.

441
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,990
I was going through
my paperwork and I can't seem

442
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,052
to find your report
on the Fuller case.

443
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,064
That's because it's not
finished--

444
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,793
- not yet anyway.
- Problem?

445
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,767
No, I'm just waiting
for the coroner's report.

446
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,736
The coroner's report?

447
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,533
( chuckles )

448
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,665
And... what's it gonna say?

449
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,210
No, no, I'll tell you
what it's gonna say.

450
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:10,077
Fuller was a kook. One night,
his bats decided to take a hike,

451
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,582
He got upset,
had a heart attack and died.

452
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,949
Death by natural causes.
Case closed.

453
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,786
Actually, no. The "natural causes"
thing isn't going to fly.

454
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,391
I see.

455
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,487
So in addition to being
a big time homicide detective

456
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:30,159
from big time Los Angeles,
now you're a mind-reader too?

457
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,727
This isn't just a hunch, sir,
the body was badly mutilated.

458
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,796
This was a murder.

459
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,740
Did you recover
a murder weapon?

460
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,971
- No, but I'm--
- How about a witness?

461
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,240
Sometimes it helps to have
a witness, you have one?

462
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,283
- Not yet--
- A suspect, that'd be nice.

463
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,216
You have a suspect?

464
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,050
It could have been
animal rights' activists,

465
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,454
it could have been the two girls
who discovered the body,

466
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,359
One of the two girls
who discovered the body?

467
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,896
What were their names?
Muffin and Bambi--

468
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,866
- Heather and Diane.
- Heather and Diane.

469
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,496
Now there's the names of two
lifelong violent felons.

470
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,599
The deadly duo
of Heather and Diane.

471
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,270
I suppose you discovered

472
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,937
the girls' motives?

473
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,312
Motive, as in,
a reason

474
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,977
they felt it was necessary
to kill somebody.

475
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,282
What did Fuller do?
Break their hairdryer?

476
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,912
Steal their
bellybutton rings?

477
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,583
- Sir, if you just let me--
- You know, Parks,

478
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,287
Scottsville isn't
anything like Los Angeles.

479
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,465
Scottsville is different.

480
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,295
Way different.

481
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,835
Our local businesses
are run by families.

482
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:42,600
Those families count on the money
the Apple Festival brings in.

483
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,336
So the last thing this town
needs right now

484
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,900
is a murder!

485
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,414
So I want your report on how
Fuller died a peaceful,

486
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,917
and natural death on my desk
tomorrow morning!

487
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,283
- Sir, that would--
- Tomorrow!

488
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,185
Yes, sir.

489
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,584
How long does it take to get
an autopsy in this county?

490
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,753
- Man: Seven days.
- I'm aware of that.

491
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,626
But I need
this information stat.

492
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,598
- What?
- That's what doctors say

493
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,191
when they need something fast.
Don't you watch TV?!

494
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,066
- Nope.
- Uh-huh.

495
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,332
Okay, what about
the blood work, then?

496
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,237
- State capitol.
- You sent it where?

497
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,276
- Sacramento.
- By mail?

498
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,642
- Nah, pony express.
- Do you know--

499
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,578
- Can you hold?
- Okay, I'll hold.

500
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,812
( phone rings )

501
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,786
- Parks.
- Hi, this is John Winslow.

502
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:33,051
- I'm sorry, who?
- Winslow, Dr. John Winslow.

503
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,490
The veterinarian--
we met yesterday.

504
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,927
- Oh, the dogcatcher.
- Yeah, the dogcatcher.

505
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,795
I also entertain
at children's birthday parties.

506
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,300
Listen, a client of mine
just brought in his dog--

507
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,031
You know what, I don't have
time for a dog story right now.

508
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,006
I'm in the middle of a very important
homicide investigation.

509
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,769
Okay, you had
the roast beef

510
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,175
with mayo and a diet Coke,
right, Ally?

511
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,277
This dog is dead.

512
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,478
He was attacked
by bats.

513
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,386
This could have something
to do with your investigation.

514
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,321
Did you tamper
with the evidence?

515
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:11,294
Did I run my hands all over
a chewed up doberman? No.

516
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,262
Don't touch anything.
I'll be right there.

517
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,433
( chuckles )

518
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,936
Howard?

519
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,529
I'm gonna go see
Dr. Winslow.

520
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,599
I've got the coroner
on line one.

521
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,872
Tell him I need
those blood results yesterday.

522
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,379
Gotcha.

523
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,108
Hey, what about
your lunch?

524
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,615
I'm not hungry.

525
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,709
Can I have it?

526
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,651
Sure.

527
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,821
I've been looking through
some of my books,

528
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,557
and most bats attack in areas where
it's easiest to draw blood.

529
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,462
They go for the ankles
and the neck.

530
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,125
Yeah?

531
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,534
But these bats didn't just
take blood. They took flesh.

532
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,299
I can see that.

533
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,398
They ate this dog
like he was dinner.

534
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,035
This is just like
Professor Fuller--

535
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,011
Exactly.

536
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,313
Here's something else that's
really weird. Listen to this.

537
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,909
When a bat bites
it's host--

538
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,852
yeah,
like you invited them--

539
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,890
their saliva contains
small amounts

540
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,686
of procaine hydrochloride.

541
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,886
- What's that?
- Well, it numbs the pain.

542
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,521
The host puts up
less of a fight.

543
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,065
But these bats,
the ones who killed Omar--

544
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,328
I took some tissue samples
and ran some tests.

545
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,768
Their saliva
contained 20 times

546
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,671
the regular amount
of procaine hydrochloride.

547
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,072
What does that mean?

548
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:35,101
It means the more they attack,
the less you feel.

549
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,706
So what causes a bat
to turn killer like that?

550
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,341
I don't know.

551
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:44,684
A disease, or some kind
of genetic engineering.

552
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,246
Okay, wait.

553
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,485
You want me to go
into my boss' office

554
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,493
and tell him
that these deaths

555
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,825
were caused
by mutant killer bats?

556
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,387
Yep.

557
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,126
I don't think so.

558
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,259
I need proof.
I need a bat.

559
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,896
I need to connect
the fangs with the bite marks.

560
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,271
Ah, so now you want
the dogcatcher's help.

561
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,872
I mean, I figured
you'd like to help

562
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,643
and thought I'd just
give you a break here.

563
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,344
Gee, thanks.

564
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,649
So?

565
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,518
Come on,
what do we do?

566
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,580
Well, bats love caves.

567
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,649
There's only one
in the area.

568
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,524
Great.
When do we go?

569
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,223
It's probably safest during
the day when they're asleep.

570
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:30,199
Right, we don't want
to wake any of them up.

571
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,031
No, we don't.

572
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,004
And I have some
cave exploring equipment.

573
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,717
This is your
cave exploring equipment?

574
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,056
What?
You can do better?

575
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,497
I guess not.

576
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,728
Why do we have
to wear this stuff, anyway?

577
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,531
Protection.

578
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,040
Okay.

579
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,043
How'd you find
this place?

580
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,512
Teenagers come up here
and make out at night.

581
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,709
And you know
this because?

582
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,515
Because I caught my daughter up here
with her boyfriend one night.

583
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,716
- What about you?
- What about me?

584
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,794
You done any parking
at the bat cave lately?

585
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,060
Not since
I left LA.

586
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,500
Left your boyfriend behind?

587
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,766
Ex-boyfriend.
He moved in with another woman.

588
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,909
Ooh, boy.

589
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,275
When they move in with someone
else that's a pretty good sign

590
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,871
that your relationship
might be in trouble.

591
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,114
Oh, man, I cannot believe
I have to wear all this stuff.

592
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,518
I must look ridiculous.

593
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,283
It's not a fashion show.

594
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,291
You're out here
in the middle of nowhere.

595
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,020
No one's gonna see you.

596
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,393
Are you afraid that
someone's gonna laugh at you?

597
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,364
All right,
you're right.

598
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,534
( laughs )

599
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,766
What?

600
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,742
You look ridiculous.

601
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,735
- John?
- Yeah?

602
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,870
- Maybe I should tell you.
- What?

603
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,075
I have this thing
about bats.

604
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:05,288
I'm not afraid
of felons with guns...

605
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,258
but bats just
give me the creeps.

606
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,956
Well, news flash. Duh.

607
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,464
Bats give
everyone the creeps.

608
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,364
No, I take that back.
I saw this guy

609
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,835
on the Discovery Channel once,
who put this bat right here--

610
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,429
John.

611
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,940
Okay.

612
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,636
All right.

613
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,378
Watch your head.

614
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,353
Oww!

615
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,316
What are we looking for?

616
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,444
Bat droppings.

617
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,625
( screaming )

618
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,290
- ( laughs maniacally )
- ( screams )

619
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,128
It's okay. It's okay.

620
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,361
It's just there was
this big spider

621
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,961
in this icky web,
and I--

622
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,166
Settle down.
You're all right.

623
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,300
You're all right.

624
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,308
Let's just keep going.
Come on.

625
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,313
Come on.
You're all right.

626
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,905
What do bat droppings
look like?

627
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,042
You know what cow droppings
look like, right?

628
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,380
Yes.

629
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,353
Bat droppings are the same,
only smaller.

630
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,890
Cute.
That's real cute.

631
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,827
( bats squealing )

632
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,495
Sounds like
they're overhead.

633
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,967
They could be.

634
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,436
This is as far
as you can go.

635
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,301
We don't find them here,
we won't find them anywhere.

636
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,304
Oh, darn.

637
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,370
What's wrong
with the light?

638
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,075
I don't know.

639
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,912
Can you fix it?

640
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,154
Probably just needs
a good whack.

641
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,594
The only thing that scares me
more than bats is the dark.

642
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,401
- I wish you hadn't done that.
- Why?

643
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,268
( bats squealing )

644
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,812
( screaming )

645
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,295
Why did they do that?

646
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,129
The flare.

647
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,465
They were trying
to get away from the light.

648
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,938
I think they were fruit bats,
just normal everyday fruit bats.

649
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,066
Not the kind
we're looking for.

650
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,077
How can you be sure?

651
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,079
Because we're
not dead and bloody.

652
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,775
Oh, good, that makes me feel
so much better.

653
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,024
Genny: One professor,
one ferocious guard dog--

654
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,088
both dead.
A coincidence?

655
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,464
I think not.

656
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,595
The number one suspect?
Bats.

657
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,101
Violent,
aggressive,

658
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,302
flesh-eating,
blood-sucking bats!

659
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,777
I'm sorry, miss,
you can't tape this.

660
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,507
Is it an official
crime scene?

661
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,072
No.
I look ridiculous.

662
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,080
We're here
with John Winslow,

663
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:00,385
former small town
vet-turned-bat-hunter.

664
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,426
What's going on here, sir?

665
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,752
- Am I in focus?
- Yep.

666
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,062
- The light's good?
- I think so.

667
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,829
Framed up
nice and tight?

668
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,530
Uh-huh.

669
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,096
If you don't turn
that camera off right now,

670
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:20,200
you're grounded
until you're 40.

671
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,637
( beeps off )

672
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,127
( car alarm beeps )

673
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,930
- Does Kramer know you're here?
- Not a clue, boss.

674
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,937
Okay. Are we ready?

675
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,563
As ready as we're
ever gonna be.

676
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,369
We were waiting
for you, Mr. Hart.

677
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,841
All right.
Let's go.

678
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,344
This property is in
the middle of my golf course.

679
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,209
I promised my home buyers
a golf course,

680
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,045
and this house is in the middle
of the seventh fairway.

681
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,687
Shut up!

682
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:08,486
Sam, how are we doing on this
so-called murder investigation?

683
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,857
- It's all under control.
- It better be.

684
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,295
I expect to close most of my deals
at the dance on Friday night.

685
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,492
Yeah I hear you daughter's
gonna be Miss Apple Queen.

686
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,000
Miss Apple Blossom.

687
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:23,005
And yes, that is
the icing on the cake.

688
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,405
Your job, besides, mmm...

689
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,603
is to make sure that nobody
touches my icing.

690
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,305
Is that clear?

691
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,248
No touching of the icing.
It's taken care of.

692
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,978
All right.

693
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,685
Let's go.

694
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,698
You let me
talk to Willy.

695
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,899
He's owned
this farm forever.

696
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,072
All right, all right,
I'm coming.

697
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,911
Hello, Chief.

698
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,780
What's wrong?

699
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,581
I'm sorry, Willy.
There's no easy way to say this.

700
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,680
It's after midnight and you should be
off the property by now.

701
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,624
- This is my land.
- So beat it, ol' man!

702
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,963
What are you talking about?
My contract says I got 30 days.

703
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,499
That's enough time for me
to bring in my apple crop,

704
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,262
and make the payment.

705
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,099
That contract was subject

706
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,605
to the terms and conditions
of the amendment.

707
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,141
- What amendment?
- This one.

708
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,007
You see this here?

709
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,872
We both initialed it.

710
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,544
- Those aren't my initials.
- Yes, they are.

711
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,611
What, are you trying
to cheat Mr. Hart?

712
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:48,055
This says that you had until
midnight tonight to vacate.

713
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,293
You're not gonna make me
pack up my stuff

714
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,524
and leave in the middle
of the night, are ya?

715
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,191
( grunts )

716
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,503
You didn't have to come out here
in the middle of the night.

717
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,068
That's okay. Julia Roberts
canceled our date, anyway.

718
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,773
That's funny.

719
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:14,215
I have to solve this by tomorrow
so I do appreciate it.

720
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,946
Well, at least it beats
vaccinating a pit bull.

721
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,922
- Well, I'm glad of one thing.
- What's that?

722
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,481
- Those bats haven't come back.
- Yeah.

723
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,686
Over here--
Fuller's desk.

724
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,804
Okay, boss,
all their junk's in the back.

725
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,406
See that tree
over there?

726
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,946
I can remember the day
my father planted it.

727
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,155
I was five.

728
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,319
When it got big enough
he put a tire swing on it

729
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,156
for me and my sister.

730
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,928
He took care of that tree
until the day he died.

731
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,907
That's a really sweet story.

732
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,570
Don't hit the mailbox
on the way out.

733
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,967
( bats squealing )

734
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,344
Yuck.

735
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,045
No kidding.

736
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,020
Disgusting.

737
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,885
This guy sure was
into bats.

738
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,084
It's almost
like an obsession.

739
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,457
I know. He was them
all labeled too.

740
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,860
Red bat,
Southern yellow,

741
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,160
Mexican free tail,

742
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,996
vampire bat.

743
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,797
What's this?

744
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,000
( Ally groans )

745
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,572
If Kramer comes back,
I want you to handcuff him

746
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,909
to a fencepost
and call Chief Taylor.

747
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,972
With pleasure.

748
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,813
You know, I've been driving past
this farm since I was a kid.

749
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,912
Yeah? Take a good look.

750
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,685
Two days from now
it won't be here.

751
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,988
Get off my car.

752
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,000
( squealing )

753
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,073
( screaming )

754
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:56,701
This is just weird.

755
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,037
He has notes
not only on bats,

756
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,873
but on sea snakes
and leeches and--

757
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,244
Things that suck blood
for 500, Alex.

758
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,976
I wonder
what's in here.

759
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,513
Yuck.

760
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:19,420
- Ahh.
- Oh, boy.

761
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,470
Both: Ahh!

762
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:34,238
Could we please
not open any more drawers?

763
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,075
Wait a second.

764
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,014
Bingo!

765
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,011
Morning, Howard.

766
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,114
They don't pay me nearly enough,

767
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,159
- not for this.
- Will you be okay?

768
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:27,185
I don't know. Two dead bodies
in one week. It's ridiculous.

769
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,494
Scottsville hasn't seen
a crime spree this bad

770
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:32,967
since those kids siphoned
the Big Gulp machine at 7-1 1.

771
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,231
- Is Ally here?
- Over there,

772
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,274
Iooking at Louis,
or what's left of him.

773
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,174
You take it easy.

774
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,010
We'll have to stop
meeting like this.

775
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,111
- Louis.
- Yeah, I heard.

776
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,122
- Just like the first?
- Worse.

777
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,488
Nah, come on.
Nothing could be worse--

778
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,923
okay, it's worse.

779
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,896
What was Louis doing here?
This is Willy Kramer's farm.

780
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,869
Not since midnight last night.

781
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,462
It now belongs to the king of:

782
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,905
"no money down and easy
monthly payments."

783
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,536
My guess is Louis was attacked
after Hart and Taylor left.

784
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,705
Any luck with
that computer you found?

785
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:18,839
Not exactly.

786
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:22,851
I know it's Professor Fuller's,
but I need his password.

787
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:26,548
- Did you try his birthday?
- First thing I tried.

788
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:30,252
- What about his social security number?
- Second thing.

789
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:35,163
- What else do you have?
- Not much...

790
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:39,692
except the victim managed
to take a couple of them with him.

791
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,242
Courtesy of Professor Fuller.

792
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,769
- John: How do you know?
- Bands on their legs.

793
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,043
I want a bat.

794
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,779
Can I have a bat?
Please?

795
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,822
Please, can I have a bat?

796
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,692
- John: Hmm.
- What's the matter?

797
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,527
Guess how big an average
bat's fangs are,

798
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,998
in millimeters.

799
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,229
- A hundred millimeters.
- Come on.

800
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:16,636
A bat would look like a walrus
if they were that large.

801
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,901
You guessed too high.

802
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,272
You ruined
what I was going to say.

803
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:23,312
You should guess small, and then
when I tell you, you're surprised.

804
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,905
Ah-ha, I see.
Let me guess again.

805
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,076
Fangs on a bat.
One millimeter.

806
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,245
Wrong. Three.

807
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:34,722
That's so much bigger
than I would have guessed.

808
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,955
Now guess how big the fangs
are on the bats Fuller bred.

809
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:43,159
- Two millimeters.
- No. Six. They're twice as long.

810
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:47,169
Somehow, Fuller managed
to genetically engineer these bats

811
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,035
to be more aggressive
and to have longer fangs.

812
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,007
There are 500 killers
on the loose

813
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,043
and the Apple Blossom Dance
is tonight.

814
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,782
- John: Where are you going?
- Go see Chief Taylor.

815
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:05,784
We need a dusk till dawn curfew.
Nobody in this town is safe.

816
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,188
I've got to go
shut down the dance.

817
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,145
( John screams )

818
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,384
Murray!

819
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,490
Come on.

820
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:05,832
Yeah!

821
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,900
Yeah.

822
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,641
Taylor: Cancel the dance,

823
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,947
shut down the Apple Festival,

824
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,214
impose a curfew.

825
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:19,846
Are you insane?

826
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,586
You haven't seen the bodies.
Look at these pictures.

827
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,959
Those people died horrible,
violent deaths.

828
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,191
Have you personally
seen an attack?

829
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,392
No.

830
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,628
Then stop,
until you have proof.

831
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,433
I have proof. I examined
a bat that killed Louis.

832
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:40,465
If somebody dies tonight at the dance,
the blood is on your hands.

833
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,171
Because of some little micies

834
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:46,044
- with wings flying around?
- Yes!

835
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,107
Because of that,
you want me to tell people,

836
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,550
"Lock yourselves up
at home and stay there"?

837
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,349
Now you listen to me.

838
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,721
I told you there are too many
little people in this town

839
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,590
that depend
on this time of year.

840
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,220
So if I catch you at the dance,

841
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,162
saying anything to anybody,

842
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,927
or trying to cause trouble,

843
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,696
you can just hand me your badge.

844
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,069
As of right now,
this investigation is over.

845
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,370
Pack up everything
and send it to storage.

846
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,773
- But Chief--
- Do it!

847
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,916
This town has
too many little people.

848
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,392
- You heard.
- Everybody heard.

849
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,089
- He's so full of it.
- What do you mean?

850
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,361
The chief doesn't care about
the little people in this town.

851
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,562
But Hart sells most of his homes
to out-of-towners.

852
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:45,574
And most of them get their first taste
of Scottsville at the Apple Festival.

853
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,906
- The Chief's in for a cut.
- He's what?

854
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,808
He's on Hart's payroll.

855
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,813
He won't shut down the festival.

856
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:53,678
He'd lose too much money.

857
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:58,016
You'd have a better chance to ask
the Pope to cancel Christmas.

858
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:01,285
And by the way,
you didn't hear it from me.

859
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,862
Maybe the bats
won't attack tonight.

860
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:13,334
John: I doubt that.
They've attacked every night so far.

861
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,928
Then, we'd better get
to the dance before dark.

862
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,166
Yeah, uh...

863
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:22,200
this doesn't mean I'll actually
have to dance, does it?

864
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,439
You'll have to dance
with somebody,

865
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,539
or you'll look out of place.

866
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:29,949
It's been a long time since
I've been on a dance-floor.

867
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,783
Let me refresh your memory.

868
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,756
- Come here.
- What, right here?

869
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,792
Stand right there.

870
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,851
This hand goes here.

871
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:42,455
- That hand goes up in the air--
- Yeah, I know.

872
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:43,965
I know.

873
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,128
I'm not a cactus.
You can get closer.

874
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:50,502
- You're not a cactus.
- Not a cactus.

875
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,872
So, you just sort
of move your feet...

876
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:57,811
and follow me,
and you're dancing.

877
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:00,710
I'm dancing.

878
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:06,021
Whoa, Mr. W.

879
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,150
- You move fast.
- We were actually...

880
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,387
comparing arm lengths.

881
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:15,488
- Logan almost got a speeding ticket.
- John: What?

882
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,557
I would have, but I had
too many soda cans on my dash.

883
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:22,696
- You're lucky you only got a warning.
- I don't understand. Soda cans?

884
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,240
The aluminum messed up
the police radar.

885
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:30,875
How many aluminum cans
do we have in the recycling bin?

886
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,676
Bunches. Why?

887
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:35,013
I know.
I could fill my van with them,

888
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:38,645
- so we don't get a ticket tonight.
- John: That's not what I mean.

889
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,747
What I'm saying is if we cut
the cans up in little pieces,

890
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:45,386
we might be able to interfere
with the bats' radar.

891
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,057
- I can't wait to catch that on tape.
- You'll be waiting a long time,

892
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,760
- 'cause you're not going to the dance.
- But, Daddy--

893
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,860
John:
Honey, three people have died.

894
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:58,533
- You won't be the fourth.
- But this is the biggest story ever.

895
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,940
That's it.
You are staying here.

896
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,604
And I can't believe
I'm saying this.

897
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,410
I want Logan to stay with you.

898
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,041
- Dad.
- Oh.

899
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:17,217
Woman: I haven't been
to anything like this in years.

900
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,396
Man: Can't do much dancing
in these shoes.

901
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:24,629
Woman #2:
You'll love this place.

902
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,431
I got apple butter
and apple jelly.

903
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,029
What an incredible town.

904
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,597
I bought a hand-made quilt,
only $800.

905
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,405
You should see
the new house we just picked.

906
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,408
Parks.

907
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,918
Did I not make myself
clear earlier?

908
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,511
No, sir, you did.

909
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,385
- I just thought--
- You thought what?

910
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,948
That you'd warn people
they can be eaten alive,

911
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,961
maybe shut down the dance?
I told you what I'd do

912
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:57,329
- if I you tried to make trouble.
- John: Honey, I'm sorry I'm late.

913
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,731
I was wondering
where you were.

914
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,873
Hit some traffic.
Couldn't be helped.

915
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,638
What?

916
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,305
- You look terrific.
- Really?

917
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,906
Yeah.
You don't look like a cop.

918
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,281
Where did
you hide your gun?

919
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,349
Wouldn't you like to know?

920
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:20,753
Yeah.

921
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,431
Is there something
I can help you with, Chief?

922
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,967
Well, I--

923
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,003
I didn't know that you--

924
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,334
Councilman Woods! Excuse me.

925
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,671
Thanks.

926
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,801
You're welcome.

927
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,908
He would have fired me.

928
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:48,944
Yeah, I know.

929
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,213
It was quick thinking.

930
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,584
Well...

931
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,885
anything to save your job.

932
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,186
Anything?

933
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,721
I didn't want you
to get fired.

934
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,495
So you...

935
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,763
forced yourself to kiss me?

936
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,634
Umm...

937
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:12,300
- somebody had to.
- Somebody had--

938
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,238
well, thanks for being so brave.

939
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,542
What are you getting
all bent out of shape for?

940
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:20,910
Nothing.

941
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,748
Oh boy.

942
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,188
( rock music playing )

943
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:44,398
Hart: Ladies and gentlemen,
a Hart home is a home for keeps.

944
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:48,137
We use only the highest quality
construction material.

945
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,805
I promise you, I defy you

946
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,973
to find a more beautiful house

947
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,882
at this price, anywhere.

948
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,716
- And it's on a golf course.
- Not just a golf course.

949
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:03,452
It's got a 6,800-yard
championship golf course.

950
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,460
And this town
is safe to live in?

951
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:06,825
Safe?

952
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,592
As long as Chief Taylor
isn't hitting from the 1 6th tee,

953
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,134
- you'll be just fine.
- ( all laugh )

954
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,530
Please, everybody, come around.

955
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,697
- Who would have thought?
- Howard Spiegel, king of swing.

956
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,200
Should we dance?

957
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,369
No.

958
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:59,045
From the dance-floor,
we could keep our eyes

959
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,515
on the windows and doors
at the same time.

960
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,110
Okay.

961
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:17,825
Remember to keep
an eye out for my dad.

962
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,162
Logan: Right.

963
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,539
Let's go up here.

964
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:48,625
- Genny: Great view.
- Logan: Excellent.

965
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,223
- Where's my camera?
- Here.

966
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,704
All the windows are secured.

967
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,242
Doors are all shut.

968
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,038
What am I missing?

969
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:07,043
Did you see anything outside
that looked dangerous?

970
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,346
- I looked for bats.
- And?

971
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:13,582
- I didn't see any.
- Maybe we worried for nothing.

972
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,385
John: Maybe.

973
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,981
You know, if I could get
a bat attack on tape,

974
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,113
I bet I could sell it to Nova...

975
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,714
or National Geographic.

976
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,419
Or America's Funniest Pets.

977
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:57,156
- Are you sure we're safe up here?
- Couldn't be any safer.

978
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,374
And this is a family town?

979
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:13,915
Are you kidding?

980
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:18,113
It's country living that brought me
so close to my daughter here.

981
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,918
Daddy, you're wrinkling
my charmeuse.

982
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,754
Apple of my eye.

983
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,065
Look...

984
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,966
I'm sorry about that remark
I made outside,

985
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,971
about kissing you
just to save your job.

986
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,267
I kind of liked it.

987
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,005
Kind of?

988
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,008
Umm...

989
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,841
actually, I really liked it.

990
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,254
it's just been a long time since
I put my lips on someone else's.

991
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,059
How long?

992
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,658
Not since I gave
a collie mouth-to-mouth.

993
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:15,038
Well, if it's not
Mr. I'm-Not-Ready-To-Date-Yet.

994
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,102
Hmm?

995
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:22,110
- Who was that?
- I massaged her cat once.

996
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,646
Look at them.

997
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,122
Logan:
They're acting like

998
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,318
they're having a good time
or something.

999
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,726
Genny: Don't they know
how ridiculous they look?

1000
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:36,196
My grandfather
does this sometimes.

1001
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,598
He goes out and acts
like a regular person.

1002
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,194
How come?

1003
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,331
Usually, it's because
he forgot his medication.

1004
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:04,758
( drum roll )

1005
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,859
As you all know,
it's time to crown

1006
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,955
this year's Miss Apple Blossom.

1007
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,091
You know, I'm a lucky man.

1008
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,797
I have a beautiful daughter
and a lovely family,

1009
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:21,104
good health, and it's all because
I live in a town like Scottsville,

1010
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:25,580
where there's no stress,
and oodles of clean air and water.

1011
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,048
I invite each
and everyone of you

1012
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,847
to visit me
at the Hart Homes booth.

1013
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,615
Remember my motto,

1014
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,555
"Hart is where the home is."

1015
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,423
Even if you have bad credit,
I want--

1016
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,192
okay, all right,
Miss Apple Blossom.

1017
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:44,994
It's time to crown
this year's winner,

1018
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,627
and I am proud to tell you...

1019
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:50,194
it's my daughter, Alexis.

1020
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:53,503
- ( crowd sighs )
- The judges have good taste.

1021
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:54,702
( laughter )

1022
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,013
Alexis Hart,

1023
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,072
I hereby crown you...

1024
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,550
Scottsville's own...

1025
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:07,077
Miss Apple Blossom.

1026
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:10,387
( crowd claps )

1027
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,989
Ain't she pretty?

1028
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,548
Wow, me?

1029
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:37,677
I can't believe it. This is
the happiest moment of my life.

1030
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,721
Alexis:
I want to thank my daddy,

1031
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:44,317
and Chief Taylor, my dermatologist,
and my cosmetic surgeon--

1032
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,191
( screeching )

1033
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:59,540
This is Genny Winslow,
reporting from Scottsville.

1034
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:02,076
This is a bat attack
we're witnessing!

1035
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,044
John: The lights!

1036
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,445
- They're not working.
- Maybe it's the wrong switch.

1037
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,916
- We have to act fast.
- Plan B.

1038
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,551
Everything is under control.
Calm down.

1039
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:22,361
- Shoo! Get out of here!
- Oh my God!

1040
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,922
Let me get you to the car.
I want--

1041
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,034
Slow it down, people.
Don't panic.

1042
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,010
Slow it down. Just relax.

1043
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,698
- ( screeching )
- Genny: The light.

1044
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,068
- Logan: What?
- The spotlight.

1045
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:12,503
Oh yeah.

1046
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,678
- Let's do it.
- You think it'll work?

1047
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,653
I hope so.

1048
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:26,484
- Logan, this is so awesome.
- Come on, get some. Want some light?

1049
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,587
Don't mess with the man.

1050
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:38,798
It's working.

1051
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,345
Yes!

1052
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,986
I like Plan B.

1053
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:11,470
- Man: Come on! Run!
- ( screaming )

1054
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,318
Miss Smith, you wanted
a place near the school.

1055
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:28,788
Aren't you the schoolteacher?

1056
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,620
You two.

1057
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:33,685
- Come here. Come on.
- Hart, tear up my check.

1058
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:35,593
But you signed a contract.

1059
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:39,794
Buyer's Remorse. We've got
72 hours to change our minds.

1060
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,359
- It's state law.
- I'll sue.

1061
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:45,771
- Woman: Just try.
- We're both lawyers.

1062
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,978
- Sam.
- I've never seen anything like this.

1063
01:10:57,052 --> 01:11:00,146
Everybody wants
their money back. I'm ruined!

1064
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:02,213
I'll think of something.

1065
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,588
- Like what?
- I don't know...

1066
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,253
This bat thing happens
once every 1 000 years...

1067
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:09,456
- the position of the moon.
- The moon?

1068
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,896
You'd better do
better than that.

1069
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,934
Every cent I own's tied
up in this new development.

1070
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:16,301
If it goes bust, so do I!
And so do you.

1071
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,665
The moon?

1072
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:23,803
Sir! The place--
I'll give you the pool for free. Oh.

1073
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:30,282
That aluminum can thing
was brilliant.

1074
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,013
Yes, I know.

1075
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:33,520
Screwed up the bats' radar.

1076
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,216
They couldn't see
where they were going.

1077
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,088
- It was great!
- Ow!

1078
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,218
Sit still.

1079
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:43,324
Why didn't the bats attack you?

1080
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,266
Because I'm wearing
aluminum underwear.

1081
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:49,395
- I'd like to see that.
- I bet you would.

1082
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,869
Ow!

1083
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:56,377
Doctors make
the worst patients.

1084
01:11:56,445 --> 01:12:00,108
I'm saying ow so you'll think
I'm weak and helpless.

1085
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,173
I already think that.

1086
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,746
What about handsome and sexy?

1087
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,656
Um... I'm still stuck
on weak and helpless.

1088
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:15,194
But you're missing
handsome and sexy.

1089
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:18,256
What exactly am I missing?

1090
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,963
This.

1091
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,855
Genny:
How was the dance?

1092
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,051
It was like Pearl Harbor
with music.

1093
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,889
- Logan: Huh?
- The bats showed up,

1094
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,691
but the aluminum can thing
worked great.

1095
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:51,062
I'm just glad you listened
to me and stayed home.

1096
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,101
I'm glad we did too.

1097
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:56,467
- Sounds scary.
- What's really scary

1098
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,598
is if these bats are allowed to mix
with the local bat population,

1099
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,836
it'll make the problem
1 00 times worse.

1100
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:05,710
I am not living
in an aluminum foil house.

1101
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,118
I was looking
through some of the footage

1102
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:12,449
I didn't use in my documentary,

1103
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:15,786
- and I found these street signs.
- Street signs?

1104
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:18,759
Apparently, whenever
Hart bulldozes another farm,

1105
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:22,593
he names the street
after the former owner. Look.

1106
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,063
Miller Lane.

1107
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,328
John:
I remember the Millers.

1108
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:28,800
Demarco Terrace.

1109
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,206
Genny: Fuller Place.

1110
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,469
George Fuller.

1111
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:37,512
I remember him. He was
a sweet old guy. What?

1112
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,207
Didn't all this start
when Arthur Fuller died?

1113
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,512
Did George Fuller
have any family?

1114
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,518
- Genny?
- I don't know.

1115
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,557
We have to crack
Arthur Fuller's laptop

1116
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,593
and get to his files.

1117
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,493
Logan, John says
you're a computer whiz.

1118
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:58,260
- So, it's time to prove it.
- Can we download some MP3s first?

1119
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,324
Logan, no.

1120
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:01,699
Aw...

1121
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,362
all right.

1122
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,122
( screeching )

1123
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:32,587
Morning, Logan.

1124
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,430
- Logan.
- I finished painting the driveway, Dad.

1125
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,564
It's me, John.

1126
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,165
Oh, hi, Mr. C.

1127
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:52,675
- It's Mr. W.
- Oh yeah, right.

1128
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,875
Any luck breaking
into Fuller's files?

1129
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,713
No, sorry.

1130
01:15:56,785 --> 01:16:00,846
I tried every password,
decryption schemes, websites...

1131
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:01,685
Thanks for trying.

1132
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,993
- There's good news, though.
- What's that?

1133
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:09,053
I found out I'm related
to one of the Three Stooges.

1134
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,763
Well,
you must be very proud.

1135
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:15,529
Yeah.

1136
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:28,308
Taylor?

1137
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:29,816
Yeah.

1138
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:32,353
I saw an ambulance outside.
Is he still alive?

1139
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:34,713
Not quite.

1140
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,315
- Then why the ambulance?
- That's for Howard.

1141
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:38,586
He discovered the body.

1142
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:44,187
Don't go in there.
I've never seen anything like it.

1143
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,733
Can I get a pillow?

1144
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,234
He'll live.

1145
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,100
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1146
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:53,005
- We found it near the body.
- Some kind of police equipment?

1147
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:56,010
Nothing I've ever seen before.
Have you noticed something?

1148
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:58,069
With the exception
of Professor Fuller,

1149
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:00,910
all of these attacks seem
to be connected to Karl Hart.

1150
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:02,314
You're right.

1151
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:05,210
Hey.

1152
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:12,286
I hear that Sam Taylor
was killed last night.

1153
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:15,091
- Is this true?
- I'm afraid so.

1154
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:17,825
Good grief.

1155
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,829
Right here,
in police headquarters.

1156
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,335
Hart: What is going on
with this town?

1157
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:28,740
It'd be easier to sell
real estate that was on fire.

1158
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:33,342
I've got a mob standing
outside my office.

1159
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,383
They're demanding
their money back.

1160
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,078
Plus your best friend
was killed last night.

1161
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,882
Oh yeah.

1162
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:42,856
Yes, there is that.

1163
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:47,122
- Are you the chief of police now?
- Yes, I am,

1164
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,163
till the City Council
appoints someone else.

1165
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,665
I want an end to this.
Do you understand?

1166
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:55,533
Whatever's going on,
I want it to stop.

1167
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,094
Pronto! Today!

1168
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,640
I want you to get
to the bottom of it,

1169
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:02,176
and I want it to just stop!

1170
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,042
Hart:
This is ridiculous.

1171
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,925
I think he's taking it
pretty well.

1172
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,790
Genny:
Right. Got it.

1173
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,662
( computer beeps )

1174
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:26,223
Computer voice:
Welcome back, Professor Fuller.

1175
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,928
Yes! I'm in!

1176
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:30,528
- That's great!
- Not really.

1177
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:32,436
I have no idea
what I'm looking at.

1178
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:36,568
Genny:
Ah-ha. Right. Okay.

1179
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,613
Thank you very much. Bye.

1180
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,478
- Logan cracked the code.
- What have you got?

1181
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,608
We don't know.

1182
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:51,853
Looks like Fuller had
a special file on audio research.

1183
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:55,693
- But that wasn't his field.
- Yeah, but it makes sense.

1184
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,857
The lab assistants said
they had to activate

1185
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:01,334
some high-frequency audio device
when they fed the bats.

1186
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,337
Well, I'm no expert,

1187
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,771
but my guess is
that most of the time,

1188
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,776
this little baby plays
the bats' favorite tune.

1189
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,278
But when it plays
their dinnertime tune,

1190
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:12,836
you're history.

1191
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,542
Which means
that it wasn't an accident,

1192
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:17,278
or some freak of nature.

1193
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:18,512
Taylor was targeted.

1194
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,078
And Louis.
But what about Fuller?

1195
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,987
Genny:
I just spoke to the County Clerk

1196
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:24,423
at the Hall of Records.

1197
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:27,656
One of the first farms
that Carl Hart foreclosed on

1198
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:29,890
was owned by George Fuller...

1199
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:31,694
father of Arthur Fuller.

1200
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,832
It would make sense he'd be
the one to start all this.

1201
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,806
- But he's dead.
- And Hart is next.

1202
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,309
No, Monday's too late.

1203
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:44,242
Woman on speaker:
But we're not open weekends.

1204
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,940
I don't care.
Get them to open it on Sunday!

1205
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:50,348
- This is a medical emergency.
- Miss, I'm sorry--

1206
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,648
Hold on, let me get
rid of this other call.

1207
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:55,781
- Hart Homes.
- Ally: Is Mr. Hart there?

1208
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:57,484
He's not here right now.
Bye-bye.

1209
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,925
- Ally: Wait. Is this Alexis?
- Yes.

1210
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,623
Ally:
This is Detective Parks.

1211
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:05,530
- Can you tell me where he is?
- I don't know where he is.

1212
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,160
Even if I did, he told me
not to tell anyone.

1213
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:11,034
Ally: Listen to me.
These bat attacks--

1214
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:14,507
I have reason to believe
your father might be next.

1215
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:18,478
He's in extreme danger.
Do you know where he might be?

1216
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:21,573
No, but he got a call
20 minutes ago.

1217
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,641
Someone offered to buy him out
at twice what he paid.

1218
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:25,811
- Ally: Did you happen--
- Thank you for calling Hart Homes.

1219
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:29,952
- Okay, I'm back.
- Receptionist: As I was saying,

1220
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:33,051
the doctor does not perform
cosmetic surgery on Sundays.

1221
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:36,894
You're not getting it.
I have a supermarket opening on Monday.

1222
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:42,128
Alexis said that someone offered
to buy out her father

1223
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:45,264
- at twice what he paid.
- Genny: Sounds like a setup to me.

1224
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,568
Yeah, could be.

1225
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:49,576
But if this person wants
the bats to attack Hart,

1226
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,703
they'll need
another homing device.

1227
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,943
- Yeah?
- So, if we can build a device

1228
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,576
that detects
high-frequency sound waves...

1229
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:01,281
Then we could triangulate the location
and find out who's behind this.

1230
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,722
- Is that possible?
- I don't know.

1231
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,693
Logan, can you build
a device like that?

1232
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:09,787
A device that detects
ultra-high-frequency audio?

1233
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,923
No way.

1234
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,570
They sell them at Radio Hut
for 30 bucks, though.

1235
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:24,879
Ally: I'll try scanning
north-northwest.

1236
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,476
Anything?

1237
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:28,481
Nothing.

1238
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,576
But then again, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

1239
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:33,712
Any signal over 20 kilohertz,

1240
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:36,256
outside the range
of human hearing.

1241
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,656
And it'll be a steady tone.

1242
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,493
- ( steady buzz )
- Hold on.

1243
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,623
What do you think?

1244
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,634
Yeah, could be.
Give the frequency to Logan.

1245
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:55,968
Logan, we're getting
a tone at 23-950.

1246
01:21:56,044 --> 01:22:00,140
Copy that,
two-three-niner-fiver.

1247
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,182
Genny: Hold on.

1248
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,451
Yes, there it is.

1249
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:11,087
Heading at...

1250
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:14,390
5-6-4.

1251
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:18,523
We got it at fiver-sixer...

1252
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,659
four-er?

1253
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:27,363
- Where is it coming from?
- Ally: I don't know yet.

1254
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:31,208
On this map, Route 6,
looks like.

1255
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,739
That's the Kramer farm.

1256
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:38,442
Logan, on speaker:
Did you find the location?

1257
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:42,589
- Yeah--
- Wait a minute.

1258
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,956
Yeah, but you kids have
to promise not to go there.

1259
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:47,722
We won't.

1260
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,959
John, on speaker: The audio tone
is coming from Hickory Lake,

1261
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:53,227
the south shore.

1262
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:55,701
Okay. We won't go there.

1263
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,671
- Over and out.
- John: Over and out.

1264
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,334
That's not the location.

1265
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,274
I know. But tell them
not to go there,

1266
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:05,506
and that's where
they'll go for sure.

1267
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,706
You're a genius.

1268
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,544
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1269
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:14,480
The lake isn't in line
with our coordinates.

1270
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,615
It's nowhere near them.

1271
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,488
Well, what else is?

1272
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:21,589
A Dairy Queen...

1273
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:23,926
a mountain...

1274
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,660
and the Kramer farm.

1275
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,225
Both:
The Kramer farm!

1276
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,631
( screeching )

1277
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,380
Fuller: Don't worry.
They won't hurt you.

1278
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:49,447
Not yet.

1279
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:52,982
My babies won't do a thing...
till they're told.

1280
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,325
And they never let me down.

1281
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:03,528
Ally: So you have
the coroner's report?

1282
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:04,902
What does it say?

1283
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:09,967
The dental records of Arthur Fuller
don't match the body.

1284
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,843
The victim was someone
named Sheldon Broydo?

1285
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:16,850
Okay, Howard, listen.
Get into evidence lockup.

1286
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:19,944
But it's locked. That's why
they call it an evidence lockup.

1287
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:23,286
- You're the only one with a key.
- Ally: Break the lock.

1288
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:26,850
- And who will pay for that?
- I will. All right?

1289
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:29,988
Do you remember last year
we seized explosives

1290
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:33,057
- from that truck on the interstate?
- Uh-huh.

1291
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:36,103
I need you to get a few pounds
of C-4 and a timer,

1292
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:37,866
and meet us at the Kramer farm.

1293
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:40,601
This doesn't involve seeing
dead people, does it?

1294
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:43,576
Let me talk to him.
Howard, it's John.

1295
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:45,943
We might have
these bats cornered.

1296
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,914
And if we do, we need
something to make sure

1297
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:50,075
they will never
attack again, okay?

1298
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:52,915
Okay, all right,
I'll be there.

1299
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:58,721
Ally: That's it, up ahead.
Cut the engine.

1300
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:01,057
Kill the lights too.

1301
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:13,672
This isn't the first time
we've met in a barn.

1302
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:17,905
After you ruined my father,
he went in his barn and killed himself.

1303
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,141
If I'd known
that was going to happen,

1304
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:25,846
I'd never, never, have applied
the pressure I did.

1305
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,717
Pressure?!

1306
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,347
It was a trick.

1307
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:31,790
He thought he had more time
on his loan.

1308
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,794
You gave him 24 hours

1309
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,921
to vacate the only home
he ever knew.

1310
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:36,929
Hart:
Arthur--

1311
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,657
may I call you Arthur?

1312
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:46,364
When I foreclosed on your father's
farm, many years ago,

1313
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:49,069
my partners and I may have...

1314
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:55,012
falsified certain documents.

1315
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:58,814
But I'm now willing
to give you a complete refund.

1316
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:01,913
With interest...

1317
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:05,351
and no questions asked.

1318
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:06,552
Stop!

1319
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:07,652
Stop it!

1320
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,998
The time for deceit is over.

1321
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:14,296
Hold it right there,
Fuller.

1322
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:18,035
Put the gun down
or I'll push the button,

1323
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:20,006
the one that'll end
all our lives.

1324
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,439
You're bluffing.

1325
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,773
Fuller:
You want to call my bluff?

1326
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,836
It's a horrible way to die.

1327
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:28,280
Yeah, we've seen.

1328
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,907
It's a nice trick...

1329
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:32,748
faking your own death
to avoid suspicion.

1330
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,412
Thank you.

1331
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:37,983
And thanks to Mr. Hart...

1332
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:40,391
Scottsville's
become more urban.

1333
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:43,055
We have more and more
homeless drifters than ever.

1334
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,395
The body outside your lab.

1335
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,991
One of our drifters
was kind enough to volunteer.

1336
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:49,969
Volunteer. Yeah, right.

1337
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:53,474
John: Is that what these attacks
are all about? Vengeance?

1338
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:54,940
Yes.

1339
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,476
Righting a wrong.

1340
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:02,372
Carl here cheated
my father out of his land

1341
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:05,476
and built a mini mall
where his farm used to be.

1342
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:08,818
My father
was left with nothing!

1343
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,222
Now it's time...

1344
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:13,556
to bend our plows
back into swords

1345
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:15,653
and destroy the urban slime

1346
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:19,632
that sucks the lifeblood
from our sweet, simple town!

1347
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,134
There you are.

1348
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,533
I thought you'd be--

1349
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,224
Hurry!

1350
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:00,139
The timer's going.

1351
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,575
- Well, turn it off.
- There's no stop button.

1352
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:07,012
- There are no buttons at all.
- Somebody untie me!

1353
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:09,777
John: Let's get out
of here! Come on!

1354
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:19,152
John:
Come on, let's go! Go!

1355
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:36,241
- What's happening?
- It's over.

1356
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:39,075
- We're blowing up the barn.
- Little sooner than we thought.

1357
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:42,674
- What about my babies?
- Give it up, Fuller.

1358
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:45,241
What about the years
of scientific research

1359
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,687
and the loving, the caring
that went into them?

1360
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:50,246
You can't just--

1361
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,690
- Ally: Hey!
- Ally!

1362
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:56,992
- It's too late!
- Fuller: My babies!

1363
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,090
My babies!

1364
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,828
My babies!

1365
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:23,820
Thank goodness.

1366
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:27,554
We're free of that nut.
Now I can get back to business.

1367
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:29,994
The only place
you're going is to jail.

1368
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:31,725
To jail for what?

1369
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:34,461
Because of what you told Fuller
about his father's farm.

1370
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:37,003
- I heard it all.
- John: So did I.

1371
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:38,902
She heard, he heard.
So what?

1372
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:41,168
So I swindled the old man
out of his land.

1373
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:43,267
Big deal.
You haven't got any proof.

1374
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:47,110
- It's your word against mine.
- Logan: I wouldn't say that.

1375
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:50,582
We heard it too.
And I got it all on tape.

1376
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,551
John: Good going, honey.

1377
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,780
Thanks, Daddy.

1378
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:56,346
Howard, place Mr. Hart
under arrest.

1379
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,289
- Howard: Up against the car.
- Are you serious?

1380
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:01,021
Up against the car, dogmeat.

1381
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:03,427
You have the right
to remain silent.

1382
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:05,728
If you refuse
the right to remain silent,

1383
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,530
anything you say can and will be
used against you

1384
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:10,571
- in a court of law.
- Hart: Ow!

1385
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:13,106
Howard: You have the right
to an attorney...

1386
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:16,200
This will get me in good
with the City Council.

1387
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:18,541
Think they'll let me
keep my job?

1388
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:21,013
I don't think you'll have
a problem, Chief.

1389
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:41,261
Some honeymoon,
exploring caves for bats.

1390
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:44,668
- Are you having fun?
- Most of the time.

1391
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:46,832
You'll love this cave.

1392
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:50,400
The guidebook says that over
a quarter of a million bats nest here.

1393
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:52,378
Man, that's a lot of bats!

1394
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,439
I hope I brought
enough videotape.

1395
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:58,417
- John: What the--
- Ally: Oh, not again.

1396
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:01,353
John: We're okay,
as long as no one lights...

1397
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:03,913
