"June (2015)" ^ (Run time : 01:23:30)

2
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,639
This all happened because
of what we believe.

3
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:31,364
That there was a savior.

4
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,379
And that savior was a child.

5
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,004
A child with 2 souls.

6
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:39,869
One, pure and innocent.

7
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:43,269
The other, dark and powerful.

8
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:31,854
JUNE

9
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:51,816
Between the world we build a circle,
never ending universal.

10
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,962
We are filled with spirit power,
send it down.

11
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,932
Release the chain.

12
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,643
This was the moment I lost her.

13
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:16,147
I lost her to the darkness.

14
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:30,521
9 years later

15
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:52,677
Hey.

16
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:55,443
You sure you don't want
to grab a drink?

17
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:57,074
I'm sure, go ahead.

18
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,345
- Alright.
- Have fun.

19
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:02,230
Hello.

20
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,691
Tell me, is she the vessel?

21
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,491
- I'm not sure.
- I need you to be sure.

22
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:10,344
I like to visit her at her
current foster home now.

23
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:13,936
- Learn everything you can.
- Thanks.

24
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,675
You boys aren't causing a stir
of my new girl, are you?

25
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:38,590
Now. Sitting on the front porch,
clutching a teddy bear,

26
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:40,222
ain't no way to make friends.

27
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,139
I told her to
go out and play.

28
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,282
Is that true?

29
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:44,721
Your new mama tell you
to do something,

30
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:46,658
you're going to do it now, okay?

31
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:48,942
Oh shit.
Alright.

32
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,071
Damn it,
I got to go to work.

33
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,406
- Alright, baby. Give me some sugar.
- Alright.

34
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,838
- Alright.
- You go shake that ass.

35
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:57,662
You, go play.
Don't sit there acting all weird.

36
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:58,914
Good god.

37
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,399
You heard her.
Go on, get it.

38
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,686
Jesus.
Whatever.

39
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,131
I need a smoke.
Oh.

40
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:26,256
Many never know what it's like
to be desperately alone.

41
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:29,450
To have no one.

42
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,014
That is something we share.

43
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,662
How do you feel 
June is adjusting?

44
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:58,472
Great.

45
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,388
She's June, right, honey.
Great.

46
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,626
Yeah.

47
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:05,743
How about you, June?
What do you think?

48
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:07,455
Do you like it here?

49
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:11,240
She loves it here.

50
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:12,733
Don't you, June?

51
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:15,960
Sweetheart.
Tell him.

52
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:17,284
Honey,

53
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:20,762
about how you-you brothers
and sisters all get along and...

54
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,639
and-and pizza night,

55
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,909
and all that stuff.

56
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,562
Tell him how you even
have your own bed, right?

57
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,502
Yeah. I give you money for
the ice cream truck everyday.

58
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:33,460
Tim makes you eggs for breakfast.

59
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:36,561
Tell him how happy
you are here.

60
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,473
Is that right, June?

61
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,190
Do you smoke inside
around the kids often?

62
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,058
No.
Never.

63
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,096
May I see June's room?

64
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:03,001
Sure, let me just go
straighten it up.

65
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:04,121
No, that's fine.

66
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:06,233
June would you
show me your room.

67
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,070
Thanks.

68
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:20,872
- That went well.
- Yeah, great.

69
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:52,287
So, uh.

70
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,685
You and your
3 sisters sleep here?

71
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:02,193
Kind of crowded, huh.

72
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,968
Tell me the truth,
do you really like it here?

73
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,238
June, look at me.

74
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:21,097
I know what happens
when you get upset.

75
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:23,197
You do?

76
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,357
Bad things happen, right?

77
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,110
Sometimes.

78
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,785
Okay, June.
Here's the deal.

79
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,881
I know it must be
difficult staying here.

80
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:40,826
Too many children.

81
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:43,605
Adults that don't
understand you, right?

82
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:49,135
June. I'm going to make
you a promise, okay.

83
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:52,910
I promise to find you
a new home.

84
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,234
Would you like that?

85
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:58,832
Yeah, a place with a garden.

86
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:00,194
With a...

87
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:03,706
You're the only child.
You have a room of your own.

88
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,459
- With flowers?
- Yeah.

89
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,918
In a nice neighbour,
with

90
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,056
a family that loves you
and understand you.

91
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,455
If anything that starts happening

92
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,554
that upsets you.
I want you to call me.

93
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:22,477
Okay, call me.
Here's my number.

94
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:26,253
I will answer anytime,
day or night.

95
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:28,807
You call me
if you need help, okay?

96
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:32,250
June.

97
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,949
I'm going to get
you out of here.

98
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:53,542
DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
VICTOR EMMANUEL - CASE WORKER

99
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,651
Hey, Eeks.
Yo, hold up.

100
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:14,381
Look.

101
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:17,621
She's going to be alright.

102
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,854
Just, she's a little weird.

103
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,585
But the kid's okay.

104
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,893
Which kid?
You got 4, 5 fosters.

105
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:27,966
You know, the girl.

106
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:30,217
Alright.
The one you just come to see.

107
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:33,399
- You know her name?
- Yeah. Of course I do.

108
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:38,952
It's been a couple of weeks,
you should know her name.

109
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:40,912
Like I said.

110
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,117
I know her name.

111
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,213
- Your parents are dead.
- Your parents are dead.

112
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:03,173
- Your parents are dead.
- Your parents are dead.

113
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:07,270
- Your parents are dead.
- Your parents are dead.

114
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,569
Hey, the lights are out again.

115
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:20,354
Did you forget
to pay the bill again?

116
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,196
- I've paid it.
- Um-hmm.

117
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,814
- Calm down.
- What happened to the TV?

118
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,468
Settle down you little shits.

119
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,656
Great.

120
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:54,379
Jesus.

121
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,848
What're you doing out here, kid?

122
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:01,397
Well, go on.
Get back inside the house.

123
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:02,925
Freak.

124
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:07,419
As the moon rises
and the sun falls,

125
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:09,983
fire will illuminate the sky.

126
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:14,123
And the ashes of man
will rain down.

127
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,380
Shit.

128
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:23,668
What the hell?

129
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:25,852
Candy!

130
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:35,527
She called the darkness, Aer.

131
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:38,441
And Aer was growing stronger.

132
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:42,126
- Candy, the kid's possessed.
- Who?

133
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:44,590
The kid!
Whatever her name is.

134
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:46,023
June.

135
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:57,870
Stop it, Aery.
Why are you doing this?

136
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,449
You are a vessel.

137
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:06,514
Before people,
before machines,

138
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,808
there is only us.

139
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,603
Hey.

140
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,985
Taste like... Whoa.
You're too gone.

141
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,857
Happy birthday, America.
Happy birthday, America.

142
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:41,956
God!
Go, go play.

143
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,573
Go do something.

144
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:50,473
I don't think so.
Looks all burnt.

145
00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:55,711
Hey! Hey! Do not burn down
the place for god sakes.

146
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:59,342
- Shut the f...
- What is so funny?

147
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,511
Jeez.

148
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:05,479
She's creepy.

149
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:10,061
Like, something's bad wrong with her,
you know what I mean?

150
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:13,789
I think she's retarded.
I mean...

151
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:16,697
She's always talking to herself.

152
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:20,571
That's weird.

153
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,054
Hey.

154
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:32,066
Light it,
and throw it at her.

155
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,220
No.

156
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,930
Come on.

157
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:37,668
Don't be a little girl.

158
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:40,584
I'm not a girl.

159
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,653
Satisfied.

160
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:04,022
Give me the bear,
you little retard.

161
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,204
You want your stupid bear?

162
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,472
You're just a little retard, aren't you?

163
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:38,682
I know what happens when
you get upset... get upset.

164
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:53,425
- Your parents are dead.
- Your parents are dead.

165
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,477
You're just a little retard, aren't you?

166
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:57,739
...retard, aren't you?
...retard, aren't you?

167
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,608
Air, I am.
Fire, I am.

168
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,454
Water, earth, spirit

169
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:12,468
I AMMMMM !!!

170
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,520
- Is she with you?
- She's right here.

171
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,943
How is her emotional state?

172
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,836
Everything.
Everything is under control.

173
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:41,469
I'm taking her to the
Anderson house tomorrow.

174
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,764
Excellent work.

175
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:08,584
June, you understand
how important this is, right?

176
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,609
You may not get another chance
like this at a nice house.

177
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,653
- It's not me
- I know, it's your imaginary friend.

178
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:20,521
- She's not imaginary.
- Can you see her?

179
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,563
Can anybody else see her?

180
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:26,866
June, whatever happened
in the trailer park,

181
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:28,549
that was an accident, right?

182
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:31,579
Nobody there could agree
about what they saw.

183
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,561
Do you remember that night?

184
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:38,354
No.

185
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:40,594
June, you like the Andersons, right?

186
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:43,199
- Yes.
- Did you like those....

187
00:21:47,588 --> 00:21:50,046
I never thought
I would see her again.

188
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:25,181
Hi, June.

189
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:30,808
So glad you're here.

190
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,821
Welcome, June.

191
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:43,244
It's okay, sweetheart.

192
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:46,000
You know, Daddy just want to
capture your beautiful face

193
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:48,647
so that we can always
remember this day.

194
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:53,670
You know you are beautiful, don't you.

195
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:55,322
I am?

196
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:58,368
Yes, you really are.

197
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:00,759
- Come on.
- June's probably tired

198
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:02,878
from our exit interviews today.

199
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:04,787
Why don't we just go inside?

200
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,363
Do you want to see 
your new house?

201
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:10,592
Let's go inside.

202
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,294
Hey, June.

203
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,083
Would you like to come with me?
I want to show you something.

204
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:16,044
I want to, thank you again
for...

205
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:17,979
getting June for us.

206
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:20,601
I'm just happy we were able
to find her a new home.

207
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,553
A good home.

208
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:27,892
Did you remember when I mentioned
that June has an imaginary friend?

209
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:31,199
Lily, she spoke to some of
her friends, and she said that

210
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:34,259
a lot of kids have
imaginary friends.

211
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:37,235
June's friend is called Aer.

212
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,935
She calls her, Aery.

213
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,602
She spells it,
a-e-r.

214
00:25:02,698 --> 00:25:05,936
You know, Dave's been all
around the world taking photos.

215
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:08,066
That one is his favorite.

216
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:09,863
When he heard
you like nature,

217
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,041
he said he wanted
you to have it.

218
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:33,073
I like your little bear.

219
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,361
Aer, she calls her Aery.

220
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:39,563
Right.

221
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:43,530
In the past, June has tried to
blame some accidents she's had

222
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:46,520
on Aer,
which I wanted you to know.

223
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:51,246
Although this is perfectly normal behaviour
for a child in her circumstances.

224
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,956
So, June.

225
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:21,798
You like your room?

226
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:29,073
Well. I know your new mommy

227
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:32,575
Lily, put a lot of hard work
and effort into it, so...

228
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,568
I'm glad you like it.

229
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,272
June?

230
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,118
Do you think you like
to call me Mom or...

231
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:45,895
Mommy.

232
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:51,779
We don't have to decide now. 
Right, June?

233
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:05,214
June.

234
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,739
Are you looking forward to start
a new school on Monday?

235
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:10,956
Yep.

236
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:14,331
You'll make a lot of new friends.

237
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:16,102
That'd be cool, right?

238
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:27,247
There you go.

239
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,643
Now, if you need me in
the middle of the night,

240
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:33,053
I'm right across the hall, okay?

241
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,197
Do you want us to
leave the door open?

242
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:38,259
Yes.

243
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,040
Sweet dreams.

244
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:09,762
Ooo.

245
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:19,499
We have to be quiet.

246
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,979
Hi, sweetheart.

247
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:46,234
Hi.

248
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,551
So, do you like to read?

249
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:56,809
I heard that you did.

250
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,000
You know, I think
it would be good

251
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:04,745
if you read some of these
books for school.

252
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,884
Can I see what're you drawing?

253
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,688
Can I see?

254
00:29:30,963 --> 00:29:32,531
June.

255
00:29:36,184 --> 00:29:39,625
We just want you know that
we both love you, okay?

256
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:43,901
Okay.

257
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:09,001
Are you ready for your
first day at school?

258
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:19,407
Class, I want you to meet
our newest student, June.

259
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,851
Can everyone give June
a warm welcome.

260
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:28,153
We welcome you 
to our class, June.

261
00:30:28,855 --> 00:30:30,704
June, please take a seat.

262
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:46,058
Okay, so today we're going to
talk about photosynthesis.

263
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,924
Did you know that 
for a flower to grow,

264
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:51,509
it needs both 
water and sunlight.

265
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:52,583
Yes.

266
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:55,832
Good. That's good.
This is going to be easy then.

267
00:30:57,095 --> 00:30:59,689
Earth is made up of
lots of biospheres.

268
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:02,231
Who know's what a biosphere is?

269
00:31:02,256 --> 00:31:03,285
Kevin.

270
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,866
Is it like a place where there
are animals and plants, maybe.

271
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:10,641
Good, yes. It's the environment
and the organisms that live there.

272
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,929
Do you see the picture
on the screen?

273
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,466
Who can point out the biosphere,

274
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:16,821
when nights are cold,
and days are very hot,

275
00:31:16,846 --> 00:31:19,695
and the sand blows into dunes.

276
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,676
You should do it.

277
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:24,641
- You should do it.
- June.

278
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:28,061
Do you know the answer?

279
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,728
Why don't you come up here
and show us the right picture.

280
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:05,294
So, this is the biosphere
that we're looking at,

281
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,536
it's the desert.
It's very very hot

282
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:11,567
and also very very cold.
and it's completely dry.

283
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:16,877
Oh my god, June.

284
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:28,439
You cannot stop this.

285
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:34,409
You cannot stop this.

286
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:38,488
You cannot stop this.

287
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:45,077
You cannot stop this.

288
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:49,750
You cannot stop this.

289
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:56,031
You cannot stop this.

290
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:01,506
June. June.
June, sweetheart.

291
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:02,840
Where is she?
Where is she?

292
00:33:02,865 --> 00:33:03,914
- Hey, hey.
- June, it's okay.

293
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:04,949
- June, it's okay. It's okay.
- June.

294
00:33:04,974 --> 00:33:06,639
- No!
- Lie down.

295
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:13,781
You know it's her first day of school.
She got her first period,

296
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:14,881
she's nine.

297
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:18,243
Yeah. It's all happening
so fast, that's all.

298
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:21,263
I didn't think we're going to have
this conversation for a long time.

299
00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:23,414
How could you've known?

300
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:28,497
Maybe she should stay at home
from school for a while.

301
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,302
Have you guys thought
about home schooling?

302
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,524
It's not a bad idea.

303
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:37,192
I could look into it.

304
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,783
I should have known then.

305
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:47,509
Aer was stronger
than both of us.

306
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:16,659
It's pretty,

307
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:19,705
the way the light reflects
through it, isn't it, June?

308
00:34:59,124 --> 00:35:02,389
Aery, are you in there?

309
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,657
I can't see you.

310
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,983
Hey, June.

311
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:29,602
Would you like to learn
about your roses?

312
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,855
Yeah.

313
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:39,556
So, do you know why we cut off
the blooms that are faded?

314
00:35:39,693 --> 00:35:43,235
Well, that way the plant doesn't have to put
anymore energy into the ones that had died.

315
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,744
And it can concentrate on
the new stuff, like this one.

316
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,141
Can you smell it?

317
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,957
That one looks like
it had a few more days.

318
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,890
I think so,
we'll leave it, right?

319
00:35:52,915 --> 00:35:53,942
It's so pretty.

320
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,768
You know that one's dead, 
good call.

321
00:35:58,147 --> 00:36:00,503
I love that about roses.

322
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:03,290
- They're all different, like people.
- That's right.

323
00:36:03,315 --> 00:36:05,824
- Do you have a favourite?
- Um.

324
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:11,697
What the fuck?

325
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:15,424
Babe, language.

326
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,073
My lens broke.

327
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:33,377
June, we appreciate your help.

328
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:39,172
- Don't we, Lily?
- We certainly do.

329
00:36:48,837 --> 00:36:51,651
June, why did you do that?

330
00:37:02,873 --> 00:37:04,758
What just happened?

331
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:07,341
I don't know.

332
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,185
Emmanuel said it would.

333
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,288
First couple of nights
would be the worst, alright?

334
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:17,230
It's going to be okay, baby.

335
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:18,977
It's going to work out.

336
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,690
This shall just take 
a few minutes.

337
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:41,970
It's just to please Mr. Emmanuel.

338
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,792
Show him that
you're perfectly alright.

339
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:55,659
You are alright, 
aren't you, baby?

340
00:37:58,238 --> 00:37:59,866
Yes.

341
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,032
- Lily.
- Hi.

342
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:28,904
June.

343
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:31,979
My sweet little girl.

344
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:35,975
I heard so much about you.

345
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,588
It's a pleasure to meet you.

346
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,764
Come on.

347
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:54,672
She's doing well.

348
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:56,452
I don't...

349
00:38:57,514 --> 00:39:00,077
I just-I just think
she needs more time.

350
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:03,975
June just need a little help to
develop her full potential.

351
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:08,440
She's a very special girl.
Very special.

352
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,356
I know she is.

353
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,553
Okay. I'm sure she's doing well.
So, let's do this.

354
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:16,542
Let's work with Dr. Wynstrom,

355
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,586
to help June progress
a little faster.

356
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,339
How would you do that?

357
00:39:21,364 --> 00:39:25,398
Well. She can come for a visit,
short time, a week or two.

358
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:29,408
I'll work with her, personally.
We'll start, Monday.

359
00:39:29,677 --> 00:39:31,580
A week?

360
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,716
No, I mean...

361
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:38,980
She's just starting to trust me,
we're bonding.

362
00:39:40,368 --> 00:39:42,828
Things will work out well.

363
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:47,326
And Lily,
you'll be in a good place.

364
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:49,635
And little June.

365
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:53,984
Well. 
She'll become

366
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:57,399
everything a mother would hope for.

367
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,707
I understand.

368
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,331
Let's do this one last thing.

369
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,016
Okay?

370
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,419
Trust us.

371
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:31,959
June.
Are you ready to go?

372
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:55,629
- Hey.
- Hey.

373
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:56,923
Where's June?

374
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:59,266
I don't know.
Did you see these?

375
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,268
I'm all scribbled out.

376
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:08,548
I'm sure she didn't
mean anything by it.

377
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:11,978
I'll talk to her about it.

378
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:41,339
How're you doing, kiddo?

379
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:43,579
You good?

380
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:49,940
So, you know what
happened at school?

381
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:52,305
Yeah, I know that was scary.

382
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:58,148
And I'm sorry that we
never had that conversation.

383
00:42:58,173 --> 00:43:01,237
They happen because I'm bad.

384
00:43:02,782 --> 00:43:05,350
No.
No, baby.

385
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,207
You're not bad.

386
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:10,047
It happens to every young girl.

387
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:15,455
Is it because Aery's bad?

388
00:43:15,536 --> 00:43:17,981
Oh, baby.

389
00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:23,251
You're perfect.
You okay?

390
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:38,683
Wait, you don't want to
go that close to the fire.

391
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,401
That's why.

392
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:44,739
- Did she burn yours?
- Yes, she did.

393
00:43:44,764 --> 00:43:46,178
You like that charcoally taste,
you go and...

394
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:48,523
You got to-You got to turn it.
You got to turn it.

395
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:51,867
- Bring it over here.
- Oh, watch it.

396
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:56,024
I think it will fall off.

397
00:43:56,857 --> 00:43:58,485
Hi, sweetie.

398
00:44:00,628 --> 00:44:02,590
I brought that in for you.

399
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:11,538
Good night.

400
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:13,693
Sleep tight.

401
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:17,713
I'll be in in a little bit, okay?

402
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,791
Thanks, babe.

403
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:39,236
- I think this was a good idea.
- Oh yeah? Me too.

404
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,660
So, um.
You worry...

405
00:44:56,836 --> 00:44:58,583
about June?

406
00:44:59,088 --> 00:45:01,036
No, not really.

407
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:14,802
I guess we can home school her.

408
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,158
Not only she gets the special
attention she needs, and...

409
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:22,111
most kids couldn't tease her.

410
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,099
You know I never lie to you.

411
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:38,078
I was...

412
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:42,494
never sure about this adoption,

413
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,448
not after we lost the baby.

414
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:49,130
You mean after
I lost the baby.

415
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,198
No.

416
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,635
It wasn't your fault.

417
00:45:58,104 --> 00:46:00,169
These things happen.

418
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:03,950
Just...

419
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:07,547
Maybe this is more
than we can handle.

420
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:11,624
You saw what happened
at the hospital.

421
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,123
She was scared.

422
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:18,143
You saw the drawings.

423
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:20,396
I just...

424
00:46:20,421 --> 00:46:23,181
Let me go back, let's talk to
Emmanuel, maybe there's...

425
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:27,389
a special program for,
you know, kids like her.

426
00:46:27,414 --> 00:46:29,487
What do you mean,
kids like her?

427
00:46:29,512 --> 00:46:34,587
Nothing.
Just, she's a little troubled.

428
00:46:35,594 --> 00:46:38,632
- I know you see that.
- June's not troubled.

429
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:42,028
She's a beautiful little girl
who needs a warm loving home.

430
00:46:42,053 --> 00:46:44,120
And you and I,
we are that home for her.

431
00:46:44,145 --> 00:46:45,911
And we're not sending her back.

432
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:49,096
- I never said we're sending her back.
- You kind of did.

433
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:50,780
I didn't.

434
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:53,752
Why're you getting so...

435
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:03,908
Oh, hi.

436
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:06,443
It's actually coming down
out there, huh.

437
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,750
You hear that rain.

438
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:11,312
I think Dave's getting
the light out there.

439
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:13,470
I think the campfire went out.

440
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:17,313
You okay?

441
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:18,779
It's okay, sweetie.
It's just the rain.

442
00:47:18,804 --> 00:47:19,971
It's just the rain.

443
00:47:19,996 --> 00:47:21,699
Hey.
Hey.

444
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:24,144
June, calm down.
June.

445
00:47:24,169 --> 00:47:26,399
June.
June!

446
00:47:26,424 --> 00:47:27,820
No.

447
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:31,573
- June.
- Stop, Aery.

448
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,624
Stop, Aery.
Stop, Aery.

449
00:47:33,649 --> 00:47:37,410
STOPPPPP !!!

450
00:47:56,378 --> 00:47:59,279
Why don't you go upstairs
and change, okay, sweetie.

451
00:48:31,173 --> 00:48:33,293
You look tired.
Come on.

452
00:48:35,255 --> 00:48:36,712
Everything's fine.

453
00:48:36,737 --> 00:48:38,702
Everything's not fine.

454
00:48:39,238 --> 00:48:41,564
You saw what I saw out there.

455
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:45,051
Jun...
June stopped that storm.

456
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,331
Are you crazy?

457
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:51,150
You think June did that?

458
00:49:20,402 --> 00:49:22,685
I hoped if we
kept June happy,

459
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,978
Aer would be happy.

460
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,834
It's really pretty.

461
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:56,756
June.

462
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,701
Can you tell me about Aer.

463
00:50:02,283 --> 00:50:04,520
You know I like to meet her.

464
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:12,813
And let her know that we want
to take care of you both.

465
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:53,065
Awww!

466
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,932
- Oh my god!
- What?

467
00:50:54,957 --> 00:50:56,327
- My ring.
- What did you do?

468
00:50:56,352 --> 00:51:00,061
My ring, it fell in the...
and the garbage disposal like...

469
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:03,038
I just want...
How did it turn on?

470
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:05,870
Dave, your ring is
on the windowsill.

471
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,295
STOOOPPP !!

472
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:16,414
What are you not
telling us about June.

473
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:19,121
I mean, this is not normal?

474
00:53:19,146 --> 00:53:21,581
I need to know what's happening.

475
00:53:21,804 --> 00:53:24,291
Do you want to bring
her in for a psy eval.

476
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:29,945
No, I just...
I need to know whats going on.

477
00:53:31,324 --> 00:53:34,344
But, it's been less that a week,
give her time to adjust.

478
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:37,747
June's been through some
pretty traumatic events.

479
00:53:37,945 --> 00:53:40,556
Yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

480
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:43,750
Thunder storm stopping and starting,
plates falling and crashing and all,

481
00:53:43,775 --> 00:53:45,261
what is this?

482
00:53:45,286 --> 00:53:50,644
Listen. Listen, Mr. Anderson.
I mean other things, past things.

483
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:55,900
Yeah.
Like-Like what?

484
00:53:57,872 --> 00:54:01,446
Her last home.
It was nearly destroyed.

485
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,349
She was just getting
to know her new family.

486
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:09,828
Oh my god.
Is everyone okay?

487
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,388
They're fine, everything is fine.

488
00:54:13,413 --> 00:54:15,027
If not, I promise you,

489
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:17,744
I can always bring her
back into the system.

490
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,709
How quickly could something
like that happen? I mean...

491
00:54:26,703 --> 00:54:29,285
I haven't spoken to Lily, but...

492
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:31,417
I need to know.

493
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:36,212
Our first priority is to protect June.
Her welfare is our mission.

494
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:39,536
If she's a danger to
herself or to others.

495
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:43,556
I can terminate this
adoption immediately. Okay?

496
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:46,376
- Hey.
- (Disconnected.)

497
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:35,533
June, I got your
glass of milk.

498
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:42,750
You all came from the
goddess of turn you shall return.

499
00:55:42,775 --> 00:55:45,641
Like drops of rain
falling into the ocean.

500
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:47,502
Bodies will fall.

501
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:52,258
And you, Dave,
will be the first to die.

502
00:56:04,405 --> 00:56:05,899
June!

503
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:11,863
June.

504
00:56:13,712 --> 00:56:15,810
What did you just say?

505
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,855
June!

506
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:26,267
June!

507
00:56:29,325 --> 00:56:30,481
June.

508
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:32,595
Dave!
Open this...

509
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,507
Let me in.

510
00:56:36,012 --> 00:56:37,812
Let me in!

511
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,321
Dave, what did you do?

512
00:56:57,137 --> 00:56:59,014
Oh, sweetheart.

513
00:57:19,017 --> 00:57:20,930
Dave, did you hit her?

514
00:57:22,028 --> 00:57:23,860
Did you touch her?

515
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,022
I didn't lay a finger on her.

516
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,858
Then why did she scream?
Why was she on the floor?

517
00:57:29,883 --> 00:57:32,262
What the hell happened
in her room?

518
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:35,431
Did you hear what
she said to me?

519
00:57:35,456 --> 00:57:37,323
Did you hit her?

520
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:40,300
You actually think
I would hit her.

521
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:43,343
You actually think
that I would hit her?

522
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:46,957
What did you do?

523
00:57:48,223 --> 00:57:49,581
Lily.

524
00:57:50,478 --> 00:57:52,370
You're not listening.

525
00:57:53,725 --> 00:57:55,639
It's beyond us.

526
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:57,742
I mean, she...
She needs help.

527
00:57:57,767 --> 00:57:59,763
She needs more help
than we can give her.

528
00:57:59,788 --> 00:58:01,688
Maybe we give her to DCF.

529
00:58:01,715 --> 00:58:04,710
I mean, they can give her
the help that she needs.

530
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:06,025
- No.
- Yes.

531
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,365
No!

532
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,178
We're not putting her back
in that horrible system

533
00:58:12,209 --> 00:58:13,667
that turns out little monsters.

534
00:58:13,692 --> 00:58:15,376
She is a little mon...

535
00:58:19,048 --> 00:58:20,983
I can't handle this.

536
00:58:22,593 --> 00:58:23,914
I mean.

537
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,940
It's not safe,
for us.

538
00:58:32,196 --> 00:58:34,534
If you can't handle it, Dave.

539
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:38,016
Then maybe you should
be the one to leave.

540
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:49,465
You're asking me to leave?

541
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:51,874
Really?

542
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:56,258
Yeah.

543
00:58:59,253 --> 00:59:01,285
I need you to leave.

544
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:37,693
Hi, baby.

545
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:47,589
I never wanted it
to be like this.

546
01:00:49,797 --> 01:00:52,253
But I needed him to be safe.

547
01:00:56,206 --> 01:00:58,000
I loved hm.

548
01:02:48,322 --> 01:02:50,302
Would you make me wear that?

549
01:03:09,729 --> 01:03:12,101
You look like a unicorn now.

550
01:03:16,848 --> 01:03:18,608
I'll be right back.

551
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:32,088
Hello.

552
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:37,945
Can't you just give us
a few more days.

553
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,985
I really think it will help.

554
01:03:42,558 --> 01:03:44,598
This is for her welfare.

555
01:03:44,623 --> 01:03:47,119
Look, I know you
can change this.

556
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:51,336
No. No.
I don't understand.

557
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:56,563
Fine, I'll have her there.
Monday, 10 AM.

558
01:03:56,588 --> 01:03:58,244
I'll be there.

559
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:04,296
See, I told you.
This is all your fault.

560
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:07,306
I hate you.
I hate you.

561
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:17,633
You cannot stop this.

562
01:04:23,156 --> 01:04:25,831
You cannot stop this.

563
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:29,759
You cannot stop this.

564
01:04:31,482 --> 01:04:34,035
You cannot stop this.

565
01:04:35,332 --> 01:04:37,742
You cannot stop this.

566
01:04:38,496 --> 01:04:41,364
You cannot stop this.

567
01:04:54,302 --> 01:04:55,730
June.

568
01:04:56,641 --> 01:04:58,074
June.

569
01:04:58,893 --> 01:05:01,266
Oh my god, June.
June.

570
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,895
June, what did you do?

571
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,562
She's gone, I made her leave.
I made her leave.

572
01:05:05,587 --> 01:05:08,897
She's gone.
She's gone.

573
01:06:43,506 --> 01:06:45,429
Why won't you help me?

574
01:06:45,454 --> 01:06:48,071
Why won't you help me, Mama?

575
01:06:48,461 --> 01:06:50,490
I can't baby.

576
01:07:05,979 --> 01:07:07,497
June.

577
01:07:17,347 --> 01:07:19,859
I had a dream, Mama.

578
01:07:23,538 --> 01:07:25,329
I did too.

579
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,556
It is said

580
01:08:07,762 --> 01:08:11,135
that when the blood of
the vessels actually shed,

581
01:08:11,489 --> 01:08:16,092
the doorway will open releasing the One
who will restore nature's order.

582
01:08:16,117 --> 01:08:19,748
The One who will bring
destruction and release the world.

583
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:22,171
June's time has come.

584
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:24,686
Lily will bring her in.

585
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:29,271
She was chosen as June's guardian,
let her fulfill her oath.

586
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:31,702
I don't trust her.

587
01:08:31,727 --> 01:08:33,538
She's lost sight of our calling.

588
01:08:33,563 --> 01:08:36,621
She's become too attached
to the mortal child.

589
01:08:38,066 --> 01:08:40,121
Pick up June today.

590
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,223
Alright.

591
01:08:42,346 --> 01:08:44,573
And take Hughes with you.

592
01:09:18,312 --> 01:09:20,539
Where are we going, Mama?

593
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:23,419
Baby.

594
01:09:24,055 --> 01:09:25,860
We're getting out of here.

595
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,482
<i>No one is available
to take your call.</i>

596
01:09:46,507 --> 01:09:49,462
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

597
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:52,699
Lily, come on answer the phone.
Lily.

598
01:09:52,724 --> 01:09:55,419
Answer the answering...
Lily, answer the phone.

599
01:09:55,444 --> 01:09:57,260
I know you're there, alright.

600
01:09:57,285 --> 01:09:59,295
I just went through
all of the photos.

601
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,364
All the ones I took
of you and June.

602
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:04,777
Emmanuel's stalking us,
he's stalking June.

603
01:10:04,903 --> 01:10:08,146
I need you to lock the doors,
I'm coming right now.

604
01:11:04,278 --> 01:11:06,553
Can I go to my garden,
just 1 more time.

605
01:11:06,578 --> 01:11:08,952
Yeah, baby.
Just meet me in the car, okay.

606
01:11:15,966 --> 01:11:18,378
Damn it.
Come on, man!

607
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,881
Come on.

608
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:04,824
Fuck.
Fuck!

609
01:13:17,075 --> 01:13:18,795
Help me!

610
01:13:19,299 --> 01:13:21,651
Somebody help me.

611
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:25,805
I'm...

612
01:13:33,794 --> 01:13:35,555
Help me.

613
01:13:49,227 --> 01:13:51,541
Go.
Go, go, go.

614
01:14:11,171 --> 01:14:12,312
Lily!

615
01:14:12,337 --> 01:14:13,791
Dave.

616
01:14:15,477 --> 01:14:17,595
- You okay?
- Where's June? Where's June?

617
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,030
- Emmanuel took her, come on.
- Oh.

618
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:20,658
Come on.
Come on!

619
01:14:33,944 --> 01:14:36,974
I know where he's taking her.
It's on highway 9D.

620
01:14:36,999 --> 01:14:38,947
Wait.
How do you know this?

621
01:14:39,529 --> 01:14:41,433
Just drive, please.

622
01:14:56,294 --> 01:14:58,581
I'm sorry, Dave.
I should have told you earlier.

623
01:14:58,606 --> 01:15:00,140
Told me what?

624
01:15:00,531 --> 01:15:02,214
About June.

625
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:04,864
- About Emmanuel.
- What about them?

626
01:15:05,503 --> 01:15:09,363
Look, I keep seeing Emmanuel in
all these photos with you two.

627
01:15:09,931 --> 01:15:11,751
What is going on?

628
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:15,391
Lily.

629
01:15:16,715 --> 01:15:18,623
You're scaring me.

630
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:44,688
What are you not telling me?

631
01:15:47,984 --> 01:15:50,613
My parents were the original occult.

632
01:15:54,172 --> 01:15:57,718
I was there, the night when they 
tried to fuse Aer with June.

633
01:15:58,848 --> 01:16:00,115
What does that even mean?

634
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,828
Something happened and 
everybody was killed.

635
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,452
What?

636
01:16:06,626 --> 01:16:08,664
My parents were killed.

637
01:16:13,877 --> 01:16:15,733
And I got away.

638
01:16:18,827 --> 01:16:21,528
But, now Emmanuel has found June
and somehow he found me again.

639
01:16:21,553 --> 01:16:23,693
And he's not going to stop.

640
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:33,015
I'm sorry.

641
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,873
Go right.
Go right, here.

642
01:17:16,755 --> 01:17:19,506
This way.
Come, this way.

643
01:18:09,682 --> 01:18:13,553
Between the world we made a circle,
never ending universal.

644
01:18:13,719 --> 01:18:17,738
Between the world we made a circle,
never ending universal.

645
01:18:17,763 --> 01:18:21,363
We are filled with spirit power,
send it down, release the chain.

646
01:18:21,388 --> 01:18:25,048
Between the world we made a circle,
never ending universal.

647
01:18:25,073 --> 01:18:29,059
We are filled with spirit power,
send it down, release the chain.

648
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:32,279
Between the world we made a circle,
never ending universal.

649
01:18:32,304 --> 01:18:35,943
We are filled with spirit power,
send it down, release the chain.

650
01:18:35,968 --> 01:18:39,365
Between the world we made a circle,
never ending universal.

651
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:43,110
We are filled with spirit power,
send it down, release the chain.

652
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,263
- June!
- June!

653
01:18:44,288 --> 01:18:45,602
June!

654
01:18:46,849 --> 01:18:49,518
Lily, we are the 
caretakers of the Earth.

655
01:18:49,543 --> 01:18:51,404
You cannot stop this.

656
01:18:51,429 --> 01:18:52,800
June.

657
01:18:55,495 --> 01:18:58,960
We are filled with spirit power,
send it down, release the chain.

658
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:00,656
Air, I am.
Fire, I am.

659
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:02,693
Water, earth, spirit I am.

660
01:19:02,718 --> 01:19:04,688
Air, I am.
Fire, I am.

661
01:19:04,713 --> 01:19:06,339
Water, earth, spirit I am.

662
01:19:06,364 --> 01:19:07,928
Air, I am.
Fire, I am.

663
01:19:07,953 --> 01:19:09,755
Water, earth, spirit I am.

664
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,660
Air, I am.
Fire, I am.

665
01:19:11,685 --> 01:19:13,712
Water, earth, spirit I am.

666
01:19:13,737 --> 01:19:15,195
Air, I am.
Fire, I am.

667
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,643
Water, earth, spirit I am.

668
01:19:17,806 --> 01:19:19,012
June!

669
01:19:21,296 --> 01:19:23,636
Dave!
No!

670
01:19:23,746 --> 01:19:26,216
Dave!
Dave.

671
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,969
Dave.

672
01:19:36,094 --> 01:19:37,477
Dave.

673
01:19:42,268 --> 01:19:44,011
June!

674
01:19:46,643 --> 01:19:48,963
June, stop it.

675
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,605
Listen to me, June.

676
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:58,561
You don't have to do this.

677
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:00,543
I want you home.

678
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:06,044
June.

679
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:08,916
I love you.

680
01:20:59,295 --> 01:21:02,427
This all happened because
of what we believe.

681
01:21:03,881 --> 01:21:05,905
And now we run,

682
01:21:06,348 --> 01:21:08,927
not from the ones 
that will hurt us,

683
01:21:09,643 --> 01:21:12,125
but from the one
she will hurt.
