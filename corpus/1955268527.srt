00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,145
♪♪

3
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:15,117
Quintuplets.

4
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:19,720
Pretty Cool, Huh?

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,293
In A Word...
That's A Lot Of Babies.

6
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,295
The Grover Family?

7
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,663
Wow.

8
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,665
I'm Jamie Grover,

9
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,266
Part Of The Grover Family.

10
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:37,673
What A Weird Coincidence.

11
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,976
Ok, So It's Not A Coincidence.

12
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:46,012
You See, This Is My Story.

13
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:48,647
And, Yeah,
It's One Of Those

14
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:52,018
Girl Finds Herself Even Though She
Didn't Know She Was Lost Stories.

15
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,855
But I Promise You,
It's Not Gonna Be Lame,

16
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,192
And It's Not
Gonna Be Boring. Ok?

17
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:02,194
Oh, And For The Record,

18
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:04,196
I'm Not One Of The Quints.

19
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:06,165
I'm Their Older Sister.

20
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:08,167
And To Really Understand
My Story,

21
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,636
We Need To Go Back
To Last January,

22
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:13,672
Before My Brothers
And Sisters Arrived.

23
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:15,107
Sound Good?

24
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:16,342
Great.

25
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:19,678
You Know, We're Gonna
Get Along Just Fine.

26
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:21,014
That's My Dad,
Jim Grover.

27
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:24,183
And No, He's Not Doing
My Homework.

28
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,684
He's Doing His Own.

29
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,186
Dad's Taking Classes.

30
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:29,822
A College Degree Leads
To One More Promotion,

31
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:31,024
At Least In Dad's
Big Plan.

32
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:35,361
See, Dad Believes You Should
Always Try To Improve Yourself,

33
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,363
Never Rest
On What You've Got.

34
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,698
Unfortunately...
He's A Lousy Student.

35
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:42,034
Still, A Plan Is A Plan,

36
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:44,803
And Yes, Dad Always
Has A Plan.

37
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:47,540
Oh, And That's Mom,
Nancy Grover.

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,508
She Publishes
A Little Town Paper,

39
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:52,178
And, Well, There's No Nice
Way To Say This,

40
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,513
But She's A Tiny Bit
Scatterbrained.

41
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,715
But Still, We're Used To It.

42
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:57,716
Morning.

43
00:01:57,716 --> 00:01:58,717
Morning.

44
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,119
Ah, We Meet Again.

45
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,354
Oh, Did You See
The Fridge, By The Way?

46
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:04,356
Shrine To Me.

47
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:06,358
Anyway, I Remember This Day.

48
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:09,895
And You Don't Need To See What
Happened Next To Understand My Story,

49
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:12,832
So Let's Just Move On, Ok?

50
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:15,868
Now, Please. Now.

51
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:19,710
Fine. Let's Just
Show You Where I Live.

52
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,879
That's More Like It.

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,881
This Is My House.

54
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,884
And It Looks Like 90 %
Of The Houses Here In Milford.

55
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:34,186
Oh, And For Those Of You
Who Aren't So Quick,

56
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,021
Milford Is My Home Town.

57
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,290
So Let's Take A Peek At It,
Shall We?

58
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,960
Here We Go.

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,695
That's Downtown.

60
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,697
You Got Your Bank,
Grocery Store,

61
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,365
A Couple Of Restaurants,

62
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:47,866
And The Ice-Cream Parlor.

63
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,869
But The One Thing
That Makes Milford Famous

64
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:54,106
Is Just A Block
To The East.

65
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:57,042
Ok, So That's
Not Really There.

66
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,278
Just Making Sure
You're With Me.

67
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:00,980
Next Stop...

68
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,749
Yep. School.

69
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:06,652
But Don't Worry.
This Isn't One Of Those Scary Stories.

70
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,554
See? High School Is Great.

71
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:11,657
Now Come On Inside With Me And
My Best Friends Zoe And Brad.

72
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,932
Come On!

73
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:22,002
My School Is Pretty Much
The Same As Most Schools.

74
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,838
Every Day Is Like
Going To The Circus.

75
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,308
Oh, There Goes
My Math Teacher.

76
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:32,945
I'm Telling You,
This Place Is Really Great.

77
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:33,013
Ok.

78
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,352
I Lied.

79
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:43,522
Hey, I Can Dream,
Can't I?

80
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:45,991
Anyway... The Truth Is,

81
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,627
My School's
Like Any Other School.

82
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:51,630
There Are No Circus Clowns
Or Acrobats Or--

83
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,599
Ooh, Hi, Jessica--

84
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,268
Or No--Ah, Eech--

85
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,337
Fire-Breathers.

86
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:01,340
Well, Unless You Count
The Gym Teacher, Mr. Brooks,

87
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,208
But That's
A Different Story.

88
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,779
Anyway, The Point Is,
I Have To Show You My School

89
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,649
Because I Have To Show You
Who I Was Back Then. Ok?

90
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,018
Here We Go.

91
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:15,154
We Want As!

92
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,690
Ha Ha. Not Bad.

93
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,192
One B-Plus
And 2 A-Minuses.

94
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,194
I Hate You.

95
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:24,330
Maybe You Should Take
My Card, Jamie.

96
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,698
It's All As.

97
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,534
That's Sweet,
But I Don't Believe You'd Fool Her Parents.

98
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,670
You Know The Name Thing,
Male Versus Female? Not Gonna Work.

99
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,639
Good Point.

100
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,841
Hey, Mr. Blackmer, Ready
For Art Club Tomorrow?

101
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:38,711
Indeed. And I Have Been
Supremely Busy

102
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,546
Whipping Up A 4-Course
Italian Meal

103
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,481
To Go With The Slides
I'll Be Showing

104
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:44,350
Of The Italian Masters'
Paintings.

105
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,684
Say, Why Don't
You Two Join Us?

106
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,686
Ahh. No Can Do.

107
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:49,888
I Gotta Work On
My Science Fair Project.

108
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:52,991
Ahh, Young DA Vinci,
Huh?

109
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,861
Look, Everyone Has Something That They Love, Right?

110
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:57,996
And Science
Is Your Thing.

111
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,733
Anyway, Best Of Luck,
Jamie, Brad.

112
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,836
Oh, And, Zoe,
I Will See You Tomorrow, Huh?

113
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,872
Come Hungry.

114
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,874
Don't Be A Dragola,
Jamie.

115
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:10,442
Science
Isn't Your Thing!

116
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,710
Come To Art Club!

117
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,879
Like I Have Time, Z.

118
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,049
We Grovers Have Turned
This Into Contest Year.

119
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,752
Contests Are My Thing.

120
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,355
Anyway, It's Off To The Man With The Plan.

121
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:26,358
Let Me Tell You Something.
This Card--Eech--

122
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:28,427
Is Not Part
Of The Plan.

123
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,428
See You Later.

124
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:30,429
See You.

125
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,765
The Plan,
In Case You Were Wondering,

126
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,033
Was For Me, Jamie Grover,

127
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,236
To Attend G.W. Next Fall.

128
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,973
G.W... Also Known
As George Washington

129
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,041
Science Magnet School.

130
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,043
Starting To See
The Picture?

131
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,045
I Felt Pressure
From My Folks,

132
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,547
Pressure From Myself,

133
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,549
Even Pressure
From The Dog.

134
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:54,219
Ok, We Don't Have A Dog,
But I Think You Get The Point.

135
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:55,721
The Bottom Line--

136
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,724
I'm An Only Child Who Hates
To Let Her Parents Down,

137
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,326
And That's Exactly
What I Was Doing.

138
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,098
Oh, Hey, Dad.

139
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, Hey, Honey.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,002
Ah...

141
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,510
Ok, My Beauty,
Here We Go.

142
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,913
Well... Ha.
The Important Thing Is That You're Trying.

143
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:21,914
Yeah.

144
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,449
Come Into My Office
A Sec.

145
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,518
Ok.

146
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:28,520
I Like What You've
Done With The Place.

147
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,255
Yes, Thank You.
I Like To Call This Style

148
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,591
Everything But
The Kitchen Sink.

149
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,526
Kitchen Sinks
Are In Aisle 12.

150
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,528
Aw, Honey, Once
I Get My Degree,

151
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,530
I'm Gonna Have
A Much Better Office.

152
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,632
Don't Worry.
I'm Gonna Get Into College.

153
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,034
Yes, I Know.
Yes, You Are.

154
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,002
You're Gonna Be The First Grover To Do So.

155
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:46,338
But, You Know,
You Gotta Start With These Baby Steps.

156
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,773
90 % Of The Kids

157
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:50,509
Who Go To George Washington
Science Magnet Go On To College!

158
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,110
It's A Lot More
Than At Your School.

159
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,279
I'm Working On It.
I Know The Plan.

160
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,882
Ok, Ok. I Know
You Know The Plan.

161
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,183
You're Very Smart.

162
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,452
Back In Those Days,
This Was My Life.

163
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,688
Only Child.
Do What The Folks Ask.

164
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,859
At Least Visiting Mom Was A Whole
Different Experience Than Seeing Dad.

165
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,894
Better Or Worse...

166
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,365
You Be The Judge.

167
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,067
Oh! Oh,
But Mr. Ziff,

168
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,035
You've Just Got
To Meet With Her.

169
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,037
She's Industrious,
Clever, And Very Bright.

170
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:20,005
Trying To Get You
An Internship.

171
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,741
Oh! Ok!

172
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,977
Well, Please
Think About It.

173
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,513
And Thank You
For The Interview.

174
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,018
You'll Be The Cover Story
Of The Next <I>Milford Weekly.</I>

175
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,020
So I Guess You're
Feeling Better.

176
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,023
I'm Feeling Great.
And I Almost Got You A Meeting

177
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:41,193
With Mr. Raymond Ziff,
The Owner Of The Ziff Chain Of Department Stores

178
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:43,262
And A Very Prominent Lawyer.

179
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,731
Oh, Yeah, That's What
I'm Gonna Be--

180
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,866
A Lawyer And A Department Store Owner.

181
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,535
Don't Sell Yourself Short,
Jamie.

182
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,703
You Can Be Anything.

183
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:54,506
If My Parents Had Told Me That,
Who Knows?

184
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:59,753
I Might Be Running <I>The New York Times</I>
Now Instead Of <I>The Milford Weekly.</I>

185
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,024
I Know You're Gonna
Get Into Magnet Somehow.

186
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,060
Did You Bring Me The Poem
From Your English Class Yet?

187
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,528
Oh, No, Not That.

188
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,031
Yes. I Want To Publish It.

189
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,465
Right...

190
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,967
Right...

191
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,036
Mom Treated<I>
The Milford Weekly</I>

192
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,804
Like One Of Those Family
Christmas Letters

193
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:27,639
Where Parents Bragged About
Their Kids And Stuff.

194
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,041
<I>Grover's Corner.</I>

195
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,542
The Only Difference Is,

196
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,211
Mom Got People
To Pay For The Ads.

197
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,714
Everyone Loves To Read
Your Stuff, Jamie.

198
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,716
They Know
How Special You Are.

199
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,319
People Ask Me All The Time,
"Is She Gonna Be A Lawyer,

200
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,387
A Doctor,
Or Even A News Anchor?"

201
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,723
Maybe We're Not Doing
Enough To Help You.

202
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:47,392
We Want To Give You Every
Opportunity To Succeed, Honey.

203
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:48,994
College And Beyond--

204
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,129
What A Great Future You Have Ahead Of You.

205
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,129
And We Can't Wait
To Watch.

206
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,332
Mm-Hmm!

207
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,440
Aah!

208
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,109
You Can
Quote Me, Brad.

209
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:06,011
Anyway, I Hope
You're Having Fun

210
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:09,348
Doing Whatever You're Doing.

211
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm Here... Working.
Ha Ha. Bye.

212
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,990
Eech.

213
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,958
Anyway,
Don't Get Me Wrong.

214
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,294
I Know This Is
Kind Of Weird,

215
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:24,363
But I Loved My Parents.

216
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,765
And They Really Wanted
What Was Best For Me,

217
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,767
And That's Great, Ok?

218
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,169
Now, I Already Told You
That I Was Lost

219
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,971
But I Didn't Know It.

220
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,940
I Did Know Something
Was Wrong, Though,

221
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,009
But I Thought Maybe It Was
Just My Science Fair Project.

222
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:40,312
Hey, Kiddo.

223
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:41,313
Hey, Dad.

224
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:42,881
So How's It Goin'?

225
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:44,683
Pretty Good.
Pretty Good.

226
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:45,018
Need Any Help?

227
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,452
Uh, No.
That's Ok.

228
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,454
All Right.
That's Probably For The Best.

229
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:52,457
The Truth Is,
I Really Wouldn't Be Much Help

230
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:54,126
With This Science
Stuff. Woof.

231
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,396
You Know,
I Was Only Good At One Thing In High School.

232
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,897
What Was That?

233
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:00,666
Photography.

234
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,869
No, Wait. How Come When You Take
Those Pictures Of Me And Mom,

235
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,570
We're Usually, Like,
Way Out Of Focus?

236
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,706
Because I Had To Give It Up A Long Time Ago.

237
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,741
You Know, Art And Music,
Photography Just Weren't

238
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,843
Part Of The Plan.

239
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,515
Well, I Think It Looks Like A Winner.

240
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,251
I Think It's Gonna Be The First Of Many,
Many Blue Ribbons.

241
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,686
Right?

242
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,888
Yeah. Well,
We'll Know Friday Night.

243
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,757
Yeah, We Will.
You'll Make Us Proud, Honey.

244
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,192
You Always Do.
All Right, Honey.

245
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,027
Call Me If You Need
Anything Else.

246
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,195
Okey-Dokey.

247
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,698
Who Were We Kidding?
Me Win The Blue Ribbon?

248
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,401
Although I Gotta Say,
I Was Pretty Proud Of My Project.

249
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:39,204
Man, OVER P.A.:
And The Winner Is... Jamie Grover

250
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:42,444
For Revolutionizing Modern
Physics In Her Free Time!

251
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,446
Oh, Get Real.

252
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,114
And The Winner Is...

253
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:53,519
Bradley Brown For His
Electromagnetic Power Project.

254
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,621
Great Job, You Stupid
Genius, You.

255
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,690
Hey, I Think Jamie's
Project's Great, Too.

256
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,792
I Could Have <I>Never</I> Gotten
That To Work.

257
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,860
Hey, Everybody!

258
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,196
Hey, Honey.
I'm Very Proud Of You.

259
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,397
Hi, Zoe.

260
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:06,965
Bradley,
Congratulations Again.

261
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,267
I'm Sure Your Parents
Will Be Very Proud.

262
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:10,802
Relieved, Really.

263
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:12,037
But It's Something.

264
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,206
Well, We'll See You
At Home.

265
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,375
Oh, And I Found A Great Essay
Contest For You To Enter.

266
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,377
I'll Tell Ya All About It.
Good Job.

267
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,046
All Right,
See You Guys.

268
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,046
Bye.

269
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,214
Bye-Bye.

270
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,216
And The Plan
Continues.

271
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,817
You Know,

272
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,252
Sometimes
My Parents--

273
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,387
Your Parents
Love You.

274
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:32,390
I Know That.
But I Wish I Could Just Have A Few Days

275
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,593
Where I Wasn't The Center Of Their Lives.

276
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,262
I Can't Give Them
What They Want.

277
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:39,665
I Want To,
But I Just Can't.

278
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,634
Here's Another Little
Rule Of Thumb For You.

279
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,837
Be Careful
What You Wish For.

280
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:48,776
What Are We
Gonna Tell Jamie?

281
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,344
What Will You
Tell Me About What?

282
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,345
We Were, Um...

283
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:57,115
What I Meant Was, Um...

284
00:11:57,115 --> 00:12:00,688
Your Father Has
Something To Say.

285
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,690
Honey...

286
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,161
So, Jamie, Your Mom...

287
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,366
Is, Um, Pregnant.

288
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,433
That's Great, Mom!

289
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,835
Yeah.

290
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:17,003
That Wasn't So Hard.

291
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,439
No, I Guess,

292
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:25,344
But I Don't Understand
How This Could Happen.

293
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,346
Well, Mom,
As I Remember,

294
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,682
You Said
That When 2 People

295
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:33,185
Fall So Madly In Love
With Each Other That--

296
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,388
No, That's Not
What I Meant.

297
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,691
Jamie...

298
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:42,661
I'm...

299
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,196
Really--

300
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,399
Really, Really,

301
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,970
Really, Really...

302
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,838
Really Pregnant.

The Moment I Heard
Mom Was Pregnant,

330
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,929
I Knew My Life
Was Gonna Change--

331
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:51,963
No More Only Child

332
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,965
And No More
Nonstop Attention.

333
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,867
My Greatest Wish
Had Been Granted

334
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,602
In The Most Unexpected Way.

335
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:59,537
Those Kids
Were Gonna Save Me.

336
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,406
Ok, Sure,

337
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:04,442
So It Takes Months And Months For Babies To Arrive,

338
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:07,312
And During That Time,
Nothing Really Changed.

339
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,447
Well, Except
For Mom's Belly.

340
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,383
Brad Was Still A Genius,

341
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,385
Zoe Was Completely Happy,

342
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,287
And The School,
Unfortunately,

343
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,155
Kept Giving Out
Report Cards.

344
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,957
But I Knew, I Really Knew

345
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:20,325
That Things Would Be
Different Soon.

346
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:22,160
You Knew It Too,
Didn't You?

347
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,497
Good.

348
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,666
Ooh! Ooh!

349
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,335
Oh, Ooh.

350
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:34,105
Ooh. Ooh!

351
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:35,807
Hey, Mom,
I Got My Report--

352
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:39,144
Shh! Contraction!

353
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,178
Hey, Dad,
I Got Another Report--

354
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:41,179
Yeah. Here.
Hold This.

355
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,914
Babies Coming.

356
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,516
Ok, Ok, Honey.
Breathe. Breathe.

357
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,519
Oh, This Is So Exciting.

358
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,520
Ok, Honey,
You Know What?

359
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,088
I Got--
I Got Your Clothes,

360
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,656
And Some Other Clothes
Just In Case,

361
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:52,791
And Then I Got
That Videotape

362
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,925
And All The Magazines
You Wanted.

363
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,927
Oh, Honey,
You're So Beautiful.

364
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,762
Shoes! Shoes! Shoes!

365
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:59,197
Shoes!
I Got To Get Shoes!

366
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:00,899
Ok. No, No, Get The Right Shoes.
Get The Right Shoes.

367
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,000
Of Course,
Get The Right Shoes.

368
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
To The Car?

369
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,337
Mm-Hmm.

370
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,604
It Doesn't Matter.

371
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:07,605
Ok.

372
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,641
Ok.
Ok. I Got You.

373
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,209
Come On,
Come On.

374
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,510
Ok.

375
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,347
Was He This Crazy
When I Was Born?

376
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,982
No, He Was Calm
As A Cucumber,

377
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,550
Although He Did
Forget My Shoes.

378
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,518
Shoes! Shoes! Shoes!
Gotta Get Shoes!

379
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:22,821
Shoes! Get The Shoes!
Whoa!

380
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,155
Honey, You Better
Go Check On Him.

381
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,390
Aah! And Hurry.

382
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,625
Ok. Ok.

383
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,127
Dad!

384
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:31,396
Dad! Dad,
Where Are You?

385
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,398
Shoes! Shoes!
Got The Shoes!

386
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:34,399
Got The Shoes.
We're Fine.

387
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,667
We're Gonna Be Fine.
Gonna Be Fine.

388
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,970
Got The Shoes.
Come On. Come On.

389
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,341
Dad! Wait!

390
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,543
Don't Forget
About Me! Dad!

391
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:46,544
Dad! Dad!

392
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,914
Honey, I'm So Sorry.

393
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:50,915
Thanks, Dad.

394
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:52,150
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

395
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,854
It's A Boy!

396
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,256
Adam!

397
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:00,959
Yes!

398
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,499
It's A Boy!

399
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,501
Becky!

400
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,270
It's A Girl!

401
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,375
It's A Girl!

402
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,543
Charlie!

403
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,211
This One's Name
Is Charlie.

404
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,212
Thanks.

405
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,515
Debbie.

406
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,752
To Debbie!

407
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:28,752
To Debbie!

408
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:28,752
To Debbie!

409
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:28,953
To Debbie!

410
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,955
Eddie.

411
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,955
Eddie!

412
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,955
Eddie!

413
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,624
Eddie!

414
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,759
Wow.

415
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,199
Eddie?

416
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,701
You're Gonna Need This.

417
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:46,371
Thanks.

418
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,605
I Think You're Gonna
Need These More.

419
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:49,874
Thanks.

420
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,776
Oh, This Is So Amazing.

421
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:52,777
No, It's More
Than Amazing.

422
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:54,746
It's, Um, Uh...

423
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,282
I Don't Know,
It's, Um...

424
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,151
It's Quints.

425
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:02,554
Yeah...

426
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,722
It's Quints.

427
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:06,391
My Brothers And Sisters

428
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,827
Were The First Ever
Quintuplets In Our State.

429
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,495
They Were Famous.

430
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:13,765
When We Got Home, There Was
A Crowd Waiting For Us.

431
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:14,966
Well, Waiting For Them,

432
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,334
But It Was Still
Kinda Cool.

433
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:19,270
Let's Go Up And See If We Can
Get A Word With The Parents.

434
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,606
There They Are,
The Grovers.

435
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,341
Oh, Hi.

436
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:24,609
Excuse Me,
Mrs. Grover?

437
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,743
Nancy, Jim!

438
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,312
Nancy,
Can We Get A Shot?

439
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,782
Me And My Family Started
Our New Life Together.

440
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:32,851
Yeah, New Life.

441
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,419
'Cause Let Me
Tell You Something,

442
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,621
When You Have 5 Babies
To Take Care Of,

443
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,923
Reality Sets In Fast.

444
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,107
Hey, Not Bad.

445
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:59,344
Totally Bogus,
But Not Bad.

446
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,520
Welcome Home.

447
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,523
Ha! And This Is The New Life
I've Been Waiting For?

448
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,857
Say It With Me This Time.

449
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:15,727
Ha!

450
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,695
Ok.

451
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:18,963
Ok, Next, Please.

452
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:20,532
Names. Use Names.

453
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,533
Next Please, Jamie.

454
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,967
No, Baby Names.

455
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,403
Oh, Baby Names: Adam, Becky, Charlie, Debbie, Eddie.

456
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:26,871
No, Dad, One At A Time.

457
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:28,640
Please, Just
Give Me A Baby.

458
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,308
Ok, Now Listen,
According To This,

459
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:33,244
They're Either Hungry Or Wet
Or Tired Or In Pain.

460
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:34,979
We Simply Just Have
To Check Off Which One.

461
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:36,683
Not Enough Time.

462
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:40,385
Shhhhh.

463
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,853
Make Them Stop!

464
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,054
They Need Changing.

465
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,757
I Don't Care.
Just Make Them Stop, Please.

466
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,090
We Need More Diapers.

467
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,259
No, Honey,
That's Not Possible.

468
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:49,260
According To The Baby Plan,

469
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,395
We Have 3 Dozen Left.

470
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,763
That Was A Few
Hours Ago, Honey.

471
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,365
No, But We Have
3 Dozen Left.

472
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:57,402
Dad! Past Tense.
We <I>Had</I> 3 Dozen.

473
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,402
But I--

474
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,503
Just Go
To The Store!

475
00:18:58,503 --> 00:18:59,537
Go To The Store.

476
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,537
I'll Go. I'll Go.

477
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,406
You Don't Drive.

478
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,040
I Don't Care.
I'll Run, Then.

479
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,709
No, No, No,
That Doesn't Make Any Sense.

480
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,044
No, No, No, Honey,
I'll Go To The Store.

481
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,579
Why? Because I Drive.
You Don't Drive.

482
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,780
You Stay Here.
I'm Gonna Get Diapers.

483
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,348
Dad, Dad, Earplugs,
Please.

484
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:11,349
Yes, Yes, Of Course.

485
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:12,850
And Honey,
While You're Out?

486
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,186
Get Us Help.

487
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:16,871
Right, Help.

488
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:35,607
Enjoy THE SILENCE.

489
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,142
It MIGHT NEVER
COME AGAIN.

490
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:41,582
2 a.m.?
2 a.m.?

491
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,222
No, NO, NO.

492
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:06,506
Good NIGHT.

493
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:10,475
Yup, I've Got
To Admit It.

494
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,009
You Couldn't Help
But Love Them,

495
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:15,313
But Remember,
This Is My Story, Not Theirs,

496
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:17,815
And Here On The First Day
Of My New Life,

497
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:21,085
The Only Thing I Really
Felt Was Exhaustion,

498
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:24,088
So I Went To Bed
And Slept For Hours.

499
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:30,528
Ok, Less Than An Hour.

500
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:34,165
Man, Those Little Lungs
Sure Worked Well,

501
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,167
And I've Got To Tell You,

502
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:39,203
At First, School Didn't Seem
Any Different, Either.

503
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,539
I Wasn't Loving
My New Life At All.

504
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,676
So, Do You
Feel Different?

505
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,445
I Feel Like
Drinking Coffee.

506
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:50,015
Ok, Fine, But After
The Baby Nurse Starts Today,

507
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:53,818
Why Is Your Life
Gonna Be So Much Better?

508
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,186
I Don't Know.

509
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:58,356
Well, Maybe Without My Parents
Watching My Every Move,

510
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,992
I Can Get Into Magnet--
You Know,

511
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,460
Work My Own Way In.

512
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,228
That's It?!

513
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,365
Don't Get Me Wrong,
I Want You To Join Me At G.W.,

514
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,133
But That's What You
Really Want To Do

515
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,735
With Your New Freedom?

516
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:13,407
Yeah. Isn't It?

517
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:17,377
Yo, Mr. B!

518
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:20,712
What Should Jamie Do

519
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,080
Now That She Has
5 Brothers And Sisters?

520
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,650
Uh, Learn To Make
Pancakes?

521
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,418
No, No, I Mean
In Her Life,

522
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:29,187
You Know, Here, School.

523
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,221
Oh, Well That's Easy.

524
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,190
Join Art Club.

525
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,192
Why?

526
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,059
Well, Sometimes
I Work Hypothetically,

527
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,363
And I Think,
Hypothetically,

528
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,331
That You Might Like
Art Club.

529
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,099
Sometimes I Work
Alphabetically,

530
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,335
And Art Starts
With An "A."

531
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:45,002
But I'm Not Good
In Your Class,

532
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,372
So Why Join Art Club?

533
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,273
My Heart
Just Isn't Into Art,

534
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,242
You Said So Yourself.

535
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:53,683
Where Is Your Heart,
Jamie?

536
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,785
Ah, Well, When You Can
Answer That Question,

537
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:01,019
Then You'll Know
Exactly What To Do,

538
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:04,021
But In The Meantime,
Art Club Could Be Fun,

539
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,291
And The Best Thing Is
No Grades.

540
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,761
That Is The Best Thing.

541
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,298
Plus I Hear The Guy
Who Runs It Is Pretty Cool.

542
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,768
Hey. Here.

543
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,904
Later At Home,
I Saw Changes.

544
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,472
The Pressure
Was Finally Off Me.

545
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:24,308
So What Do You Think,
Jim, Lawyer

546
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:25,910
Or Computer Programmer?

547
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,279
Both.

548
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,215
Oh, Wow. Any Careers
Left For Me?

549
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:33,384
Oh, Sweetie,
You Shouldn't Worry About It.

550
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,719
Your New Brothers
And Sisters

551
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,053
Are Gonna Take Care
Of Everything.

552
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:38,122
Forget About School,
Jamie.

553
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:41,058
Your Only Job Now
Is To Have Fun.

554
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:42,794
Are You Buying This?

555
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,228
Anyone?

556
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:47,832
If You Did,
You Have To Stay Late And Clean The Blackboard.

557
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:51,135
Still, A Few Moments
After Getting Home,

558
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:52,603
Something Pointed Me
On My Path

559
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:54,338
Towards My Real Problem,

560
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,008
Though It Sure Didn't
Seem That Way At First.

561
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:00,945
It's Ok. Shh. Shh.

562
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:03,945
Shh. Shh.

563
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:03,481
Hey, Mom.

564
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:05,516
Oh, I Am So Happy
You're Here.

565
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,785
Uh, Zoe, Have You Ever
Changed A Baby's Diaper?

566
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:09,086
Uh, Do Dolls Count?

567
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,622
Ok, Maybe We Ought
To Start You With A Girl.

568
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:14,759
Boys Tend To Pee On You.

569
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,694
Eww.

570
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:20,698
Oh, Oh, I Hope
That's The Baby Nurse.

571
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:22,533
If I Don't
Get Some Sleep Soon,

572
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,001
I--I--I Don't Know
What I'll Do.

573
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,271
Well, Won't It Be
Kinda Weird,

574
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,947
You Know, Having Somebody
In The House All The Time?

575
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,882
Trust Me, Honey.

576
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:39,017
We Won't Even Notice
She's Here.

577
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:42,220
♪ I Come To You
From Overseas ♪

578
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,356
♪ Babies, Babies,
And We'll Be Friends-- ♪

579
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:47,058
Oh, You Look Terrible.

580
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,526
You Must Be The Mother.

581
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,194
Well, Then, Have A Rest.

582
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:52,864
There You Go. Sit Down.
Go On. Have A Seat.

583
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,333
There, I'll
Take Control Now.

584
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,969
I'm Gonna Take Care
Of Everything For You.

585
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,470
Don't You Worry, Now.

586
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,039
Now, I See 1, 2, 3,

587
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,075
4, 5, 6, And 7.

588
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,142
Who Might You Be?

589
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,377
I'm Jamie,
And That's Zoe.

590
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:08,646
Well It's A Pleasure.
I'm Fiona,

591
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:10,882
And This Is My Room,
So Farewell.

592
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:14,385
Only The Immediate Family
Is Allowed Around Here.

593
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:15,720
Whatever.

594
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,155
But I'm
Their Older Sister.

595
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:21,392
Oh, My Apologies,
Older Sister.

596
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:22,527
You, We'll
Be Seeing You.

597
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,362
There We Go.

598
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,362
Bye, Grovers.

599
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,097
Good Day!

600
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,431
Good Day.

601
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:30,701
Whoo, 5 Babies.

602
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,037
We Have Our Work.

603
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:35,373
Join Me, Number 6.

604
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,707
My Name Is Jamie.

605
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:38,442
Good. You'll Be
Helping Me.

606
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:40,878
Chop-Chop.

607
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,685
Over There.

608
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:49,086
Soon I Could
Change A Diaper

609
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,122
In 7 Seconds Flat.

610
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,623
That Probably Wouldn't
Get Me Into Magnet,

611
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,759
But It Was
Kind Of Impressive.

612
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,028
Fiona Was Impressive, Too.

613
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,864
I Knew Right Away That Dad
Would Love Fiona's Methods.

614
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:02,233
Yup, Fiona Had A Plan, Too.

615
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,201
Number 1
Has Done Number 2...

616
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,704
At 3 p.m.

617
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:09,206
Oh! 1, 2, 3.

618
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:11,742
That's So Amusing.

619
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:13,244
Heh. I'm Laughing,
Really.

620
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:15,546
Ok, So Adam's
Done Number 2.

621
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:18,549
I'll Mark Down Number 2.
I'll List It.

622
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:21,485
I Will Synchronize
These Quints.

623
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:24,755
Like Clockwork,
They Shall Pee And Poop

624
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:27,658
And Eat And Sleep.

625
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:29,093
But You Can't
Control Them.

626
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,227
They're Babies.

627
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:33,466
Ah, But I Am Fiona.

628
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:36,500
After This Day,

629
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,636
I Didn't Want
To Hurry Home To Help Fiona,

630
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,272
So I Found Ways
To Stay Later At School.

631
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:44,009
That's The First Odd Way
Fiona Helped Me.

632
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:49,180
Sure, I Was Petrified My Folks
Would Ask What I Was Up To,

633
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,015
But I Took The Chance.

634
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:52,683
I Joined Art Club.

635
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:55,519
And, Heck,
I Could Always Rely On The Classic Excuse,

636
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,421
The Baby Nurse
Made Me Do It.

637
00:25:57,421 --> 00:26:00,358
Come On, Grab A Paintbrush,
Clay, Anything.

638
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,526
I'm Only Here
'Cause You're Here, Z.

639
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,161
I Don't Know What To Do.

640
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:05,963
The Motto Of Art Club
Is This:

641
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:07,698
When You
Don't Know What To Do,

642
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,767
Do Something You
Don't Know How To Do.

643
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:12,036
Wait, Translation,
Please?

644
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:13,504
Have You Ever

645
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:15,840
Closed Your Eyes
And Imagined?

646
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,308
Imagined What?

647
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:18,709
Exactly.

648
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,011
So Close Those Eyes

649
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:23,018
And Then Draw
What You See.

650
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,527
Try It. It Won't Hurt.

651
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:39,230
So I Started Drawing.

652
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,032
It Wasn't Getting Me
Into Science Magnet, I Know,

653
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:43,668
But It Was Better
Than Being Home.

654
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,736
Home Was Just Weird.

655
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:47,005
Now, Number 3
Wakes Every 2 Hours,

656
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:50,207
And Number 5 Eats
Every 4.2 Hours.

657
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,877
Here's Another
Life Lesson For You.

658
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,179
Mary Poppins Is A Myth.

659
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,179
Uh-Huh.

660
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,013
They Must Be
Synchronized.

661
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:59,183
5 Must Be As One.

662
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:01,585
As One.

663
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:04,789
Uh...

664
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,257
Oh!

665
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,927
You, The Mother,
You Confuse Them.

666
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:11,996
Now, Schedule Is The Key,

667
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:14,365
As Mr. Grover
Fully Appreciates.

668
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,701
Oh! Like Clockwork--

669
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,537
Unfortunately,
Broken Clockwork,

670
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,839
But Fear Not.

671
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,709
I Am Fiona.

672
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,410
Yeah, Home Was A Mess--

673
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,246
Babies Everywhere,
Money Problems, Exhaustion--

674
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:31,048
And I'm Not Proud Of This,

675
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,416
But I Used
The Family Troubles

676
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,119
To My Advantage.

677
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,387
Oh, No, No, No.

678
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:38,222
We Have To Send
6 Kids To College,

679
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:39,690
We Can't Afford
Coffee Anymore.

680
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,927
We Can't Afford
Not To Drink Coffee.

681
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,128
Honey,
Do You Realize

682
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:45,629
That Just Paying
For Diapers Alone

683
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:48,265
Is Gonna Empty
Our Bank Account?

684
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:51,802
Honey, We Can't Afford To Pay Fiona By Ourselves.

685
00:27:51,802 --> 00:27:53,938
I Can't Work Doubles
Forever.

686
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,639
And I Never See You,

687
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:58,609
And You Never Get
To See The Kids.

688
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:01,312
I Know.
Quints Just Weren't

689
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,250
Part Of The Plan,
You Know?

690
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,085
Good Morning!

691
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:10,621
So, School's Going Great,

692
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,056
Math Seems A Little Easier,

693
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:14,725
And I'm In Art Club.

694
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:15,760
What's That, Hon?

695
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,498
Uh, That's Good.

696
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,400
Yup, I Chose
My Moment Carefully,

697
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,136
But Can You Blame Me?

698
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,605
I Didn't Think My Parents
Would Approve Of Art Club.

699
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,840
It Wasn't Part Of The Plan,
You Know?

700
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,176
I Was Protecting My Freedom.

701
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:34,345
I Loved That Freedom.

702
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:37,982
How Much?
I'll Show You At Dinner.

00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:47,925
I Was No Longer
The Center Of Attention,

708
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:50,995
And I Was Actually
Doing Well In School.

709
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,830
Sure, It Was Only Art Class,

710
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,739

After All,
George Washington Science Magnet

714
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:08,045
Was Still My Goal,

715
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:10,481
Even Though
I Really Did Like Art.

716
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:12,850
You Look Like
A One-Woman Band, Fiona.

717
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,120
Sarcasm, Number 6.
I Do Not Care For Such.

718
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,492
Jamie.
My Name Is Jamie.

719
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:22,493
Here You Go, Adam.

720
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,464
A Little Art
To Cheer You Up.

721
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:30,067
Aah! Ooh! Ooh!

722
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:33,069
Ooh, Oh, It's Nothing.

723
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,538
It's Just A Wee Cramp.

724
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,809
They Don't Like
To Be Still, Do They?

725
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,878
Here You Go, Becky.
I Got You.

726
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:44,148
Oh, Now Keep On Schedule.

727
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:46,884
I Want Them
To Pee And Poop And Burp

728
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:48,185
When I Want Them To.

729
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:49,020
What, Are You Gonna
Dress Them Alike, Too?

730
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,522
Make Them Take
The Same Classes

731
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:52,723
And Go To Magnet School
Together?

732
00:29:52,723 --> 00:29:54,758
Well, Don't You Want
The Best For Them?

733
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:58,429
I Do, But How Do You Know
What's Best For Them?

734
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,866
And That Was The Second Way
Fiona Helped Me.

735
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,200
She Made Me Think.

736
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,368
Because The Truth Was,

737
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:06,871
My Life Hadn't Changed
As Much As I'd Hoped.

738
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,439
How Did I Know?

739
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,442
Well, Because Some Things
Hadn't Changed At All.

740
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,042
Hey, Dad?

741
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:14,211
Hmm?

742
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:15,679
Wouldn't You Rather Be
Playing With The Kids

743
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,381
Than Doing That?

744
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:19,283
Honey, The Plan,
The Plan.

745
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:20,584
Don't Forget The Plan.

746
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:23,520
It's More Important Now That I Stick To It Than Ever,

747
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,456
And So Should You.

748
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:27,858
Shut Up,
Babies, Shut Up.

749
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:31,462
Oh, Number 1 Sleeps.
Number 2 Cries.

750
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,797
Number 3 Does Number 1.

751
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:36,533
I Don't Even Know
Where 4 And 5 Might Be.

752
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,202
Fiona,
What's The Problem?

753
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:39,870
5 Problems...

754
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,206
And Only One Fiona.

755
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:44,074
Wait, Fiona!

756
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:45,609
Please, Don't Leave.

757
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:46,911
Oh, I Must. I Must.

758
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:50,581
I Hear Baby Screams
In My Ears At All Hours.

759
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:52,750
I'm Living A Nightmare.
I Gave It All I Could.

760
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,151
I Really Did,
I'm Telling You.

761
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:57,221
I'll Take No Money,
But I'll Take My Leave.

762
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,889
And That's It.
That'll Be It.

763
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:00,825
Fiona, Wait!

764
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:03,727
Oh, Oh!
What Is It? Oh!

765
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,663
Oh, I Knew There Was
Another One About Somewhere.

766
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,265
I Didn't Know Where,
But I Knew It Was Safe.

767
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:09,733
Oh, I Knew
It Was Number 4.

768
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:10,734
Her Name Is Debbie.

769
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,003
Debbie, Number 4,

770
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,740
Number 4, Oh.

771
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,144
Number 4, All The Best
To You, Sweet Child,

772
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,579
And For You Grovers,
Godspeed.

773
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:24,448
You Know I Tried.
I Really Did Try.

774
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:28,523
I Gave It Me All,
But Me All Wasn't Good Enough.

775
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,992
Ok, This Is
Just A Roadblock.

776
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,361
I Know Things Look Grim,

777
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,701
But We Are Not
Gonna Panic.

778
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,940
I Will. We Will.
I Can't Handle Them On My Own.

779
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,643
There's Gotta Be Some Kind Of Clear Alternative.

780
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,144
Sitters.
We'll Get Sitters.

781
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:55,312
We Can't Afford Sitters.

782
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:58,515
Ok, Oh, Wait! Wait, Wait.
I'll Set Up Volunteers.

783
00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:00,217
Oh, That's A Great Idea.

784
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:02,853
I'll Circulate Fliers
In The Neighborhood And--

785
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:05,088
Oh, No, No.
That Will Never Work.

786
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:07,825
I Could Take Care
Of The Kids.

787
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,027
We Got To Get A Plan.
We Got To Get A New Plan.

788
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,295
Oh, When Are You
Gonna Have Time

789
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:13,697
To Come Up
With A Plan, Jim?

790
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:16,970
I Will Take Care
Of The Kids.

791
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,538
You Will, Jamie?

792
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:23,548
How?

793
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:27,438
Ok, I Lied.
I Can't Do It.

794
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,473
And You
Shouldn't Have To.

795
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:30,874
We'll Take Care Of This.

796
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:32,576
Sitters. It's Simple.

797
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:34,044
Honey, We Can Barely Afford The Diapers.

798
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,813
Come On.

799
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,381
Just Hold On A Second.

800
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:39,383
Let Me Just--Let Me Just Think About This A Second.

801
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,885
Now, If I Work 70 Hours

802
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:43,220
Of Overtime A Week--

803
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,888
No, I-I'll Give Up
My Allowance.

804
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:48,225
Oh, No, Jamie,
Don't Let This Affect You.

805
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:50,059
No, But They're
My Family, Too.

806
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,663
I'll Just Give Up My Allowance
To The-- To The Diaper Fund.

807
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,166
I've Got To Go Back Up
To The Babies.

808
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,334
Ok, Here You Go.

809
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:59,169
There You Go, Honey.

810
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:02,509
I Got To Go To Work.

811
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,078
Coming, Coming.

812
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:09,079
Can I Help--

813
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,348
Hello, Little Lady.

814
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:13,250
You...

815
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,185
That's The Most
Beautiful Thing

816
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:17,921
I've Ever Seen.

817
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:20,858
Did Somebody Make A Wish
To The Diaper Genie?

818
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,527
The Answer To Your
Problems Has Arrived.

819
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:26,463
Jim, Jamie,
I Am Albert Lensley.

820
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:29,199
I'm Sorry,
Do We Know You?

821
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,034
No, But I Know
All About You

822
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:34,671
And Your Beautiful,
Blossoming Family.

823
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:37,207
And I Am Here To Make Your Life A Whole Lot Easier.

824
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:39,010
Uh, What Exactly Is It That You Do, Mr., Uh, Lensley?

825
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,279
Oh, Please,
Call Me Albert,

826
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,881
And In A Nutshell,

827
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,782
What I Do Is I Get You
Money And Free Gifts.

828
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:48,218
Like These--Like These
Cutie Pants Diapers.

829
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,554
Why Would Anybody
Give Us Money

830
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:52,122
Or Anything
For That Matter?

831
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:54,858
Quints, Jim, Quints.

832
00:34:54,858 --> 00:34:56,393
Oh, I'm Sorry.

833
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,128
Come In. Come In.
Come In.

834
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,902
Maybe Meet Them,
Say Hi.

835
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,638
At This Point We Didn't Know Much About Dear Old Al,

836
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:11,074
But At Least My Siblings
Took To Him Right Away.

837
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:13,510
Yeah. Ye--

838
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:17,181
Oh!

839
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,483
Oh, I Am So Sorry.

840
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:21,351
No Need To Be.
No, No.

841
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:22,519
What An Adorable--

842
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,054
You Want To Know
The Truth?

843
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,857
I Really Don't Think
That Was An Accident.

844
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:28,025
So Why Are
The Quints Marketable?

845
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,761
Babies Are Cute.
You're An Average Family

846
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,763
With The First Quints
In The State,

847
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:33,864
The Quints Are Famous.

848
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:35,332
It's An Ideal Situation.

849
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:37,034
Really? This Is Ideal.

850
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,402
Oh, Absolutely.

851
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,703
Of Course,
It Would Be Better

852
00:35:39,703 --> 00:35:42,206
If They Were Identical.

853
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,841
Ah, Well, Unimportant.
You Work With What You Got,

854
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:46,777
And You've Got Quints.

855
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,078
Thanks To Albert,

856
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,014
We Signed A Contract
With Cutie Pants Diapers.

857
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:53,884
That Plus Dad's Salary
Paid For The Sitters.

858
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:56,052
But Remember,
This Is My Story,

859
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,222
And Albert, Like Fiona,

860
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:01,725
Helped Me Out
In Unexpected Ways.

861
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:03,293
Jamie, Can I Talk To You
For A Second?

862
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:04,695
Sure.

863
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:08,198
You Know,
For Us To Really Sell Your Brothers And Sisters,

864
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:10,901
We Need To Focus
Exclusively On The Quints.

865
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:14,538
Now, If You're Gonna Feel Left Out,
I Need For You To Tell Me,

866
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:17,307
Because I Want The Whole Family Happy,
After All.

867
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:20,544
Actually,
That Sounds Pretty Good.

868
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:22,412
That's The Spirit.

869
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:23,947
You Know, This Could
Be Good For You.

870
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:26,216
I Mean,
You'll Have More Time To Do The Things You Like,

871
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:28,418
While We All Work Hard
Here At Home.

872
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:31,054
Ok? Good.

873
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:32,623
Hmm.

874
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:36,059
So How Did Albert Help Me?

875
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:38,829
Anyone? Yup.

876
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,798
Albert Made Me Think
About Who I Really Was.

877
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:44,770
Spooky.

878
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,239
That's Exactly What Your House Looks Like These Days.

879
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,507
What A Mess!

880
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:51,675
You Know What, Z?

881
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:53,677
I Really Like This.
Isn't That Weird?

882
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,846
No, It's Fun,

883
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,247
And You're Good At It.

884
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:59,316
Really?

885
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:00,350
Thanks.

886
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,418
Oh, I See.

887
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:04,121
It's Not Enough When
I Tell You You're Good.

888
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,657
No, You Have To Hear It
From Your Friends.

889
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,625
You're A Teacher.
You Have To Be Nice.

890
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,427
No, No.
I'm A Teacher.

891
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:12,362
I Don't Have To Be
Anything.

892
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:15,999
The Truth Is, My Friend,
That You Have Talent.

893
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:19,503
Ok, So I Have Talent,

894
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,839
And I Like Art,
But Now What?

895
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:24,207
I Mean,
This Is All New To Me.

896
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:25,642
Well, Ain't It Great?

897
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,311
This Is What You Were Hoping
For When The Quints Came.

898
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,045
It Was?

899
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:30,180
Wait, That Doesn't Mean

900
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,815
I Have To Give Up
On The Plan, Does It?

901
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,850
No, No, A Lack Of Effort
Is Never Rewarded.

902
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:37,287
Well, Maybe
You Need A New Plan.

903
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:40,624
Whoa! That Was
A Heck Of A Thought, Huh?

904
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:42,526
A New Plan?

905
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,195
No More
G.W. Science Magnet?

906
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:47,631
I Didn't Even
Want To Think About It,

907
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:50,001
And Luckily Mr. Blackmer
Changed The Subject.

908
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,503
Now, I've Got An Idea

909
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:54,738
That Must Be Taken
Seriously--

910
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:57,808
Absolutely Must.
No Questions Asked.

911
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,176
Wait, That's Not Fair.

912
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,411
I'm A Teacher.
I Don't Have To Be Anything,

913
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:04,047
Including Fair.
Come On.

914
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:05,985
Come On. Over Here.

915
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,487
All Right.

916
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:12,023
Sit Down.

917
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:15,826
Ok.

918
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,563
Draw People.

919
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,032
People--
Me, Zoe, You.

920
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,200
Why?

921
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,203
Jamie,
You're An Observer.

922
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,672
You See Things
Your Own Way.

923
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:30,273
Well, I Want To See
What You See

924
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:32,009
When You, Uh,
Say When You Look At Me.

925
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:35,746
I Want To See What You See
When You Look In The Mirror.

926
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,880
Or At Me.

927
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,552
I'd Be
A Great Model.

928
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:43,020
I Don't Think I Can Do It.

929
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,455
All Right.

930
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:47,858
Portraits In One Lesson.

931
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,127
Observe Details.

932
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,194
Capture Them.

933
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:54,297
See The Essence
Of The Subject.

934
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:55,298
Capture It.

935
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:57,434
View The Soul.

936
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:59,569
Capture It. Done.

937
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:00,871
Oh, And, Uh, Jamie?

938
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,740
I Know You Can Do It.

939
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,709
How? How Do You Know?

940
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:07,277
I'm A Teacher.

941
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:09,882
I Don't
Have To Tell You.

942
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,650
But Guess Who Really
Got Me Going?

943
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,986
Guess Who Made Art
So Much Fun For Me

944
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,223
That I Wanted
To Draw Nonstop?

945
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:23,226
Yup, Guess Who Really
Turned My Life Around?

946
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:26,129
Oh, Come On. Think.

947
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:27,831
Got It?

948
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:30,967
Whew.
I Was Worried About You There For A Second.

949
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:34,271
Come On, Adam.
Smile For Me.

950
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,272
Be Like
Your Brother Eddie.

951
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,307
As If All That
Wasn't Enough,

952
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,242
Our Little Babies
Were Becoming Celebrities,

953
00:39:39,242 --> 00:39:41,411
Thanks To Albert.

954
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:42,846
And This Is
Their Bedroom.

955
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:45,982
This Is Where
Our 5 Adorable Children

956
00:39:45,982 --> 00:39:48,418
Eat, Play, And Sleep.

957
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:50,520
Now You Can Truly Say

958
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,856
You've Been Behind The Scenes
With The Grover Quints.

959
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:55,025
Uh, Can We Get
A Shot Of You

960
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:57,594
With The Quints,
Mrs. Grover?

961
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:59,763
Oh, I Am So Sorry.
I Forgot That Part.

962
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,134
That's Ok, Nancy.
We'll Recover.

963
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:06,970
Oh, Great. Our Audience
Loves Those Kids.

964
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,970
Aw.

965
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,939
Sure They Love Them.

966
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,674
They Are
Pretty Darn Cute,

967
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,678
You Have To Admit.

968
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,880
Hey, Just
Look At Them Here.

969
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,349
Yup, They Were
Getting Around.

970
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:20,350
Too Much?

971
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,886
Well, Let's Check In
With Mom And Albert,

972
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:24,488
Also Known As
Team Quints.

973
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,489
All Right.

974
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,857
We Strike Now
While The Iron Is Hot.

975
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,159
Overexposure
Is Not A Problem.

976
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,827
Ok, But I Don't Want
To Tire 'Em Out.

977
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:32,863
Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Days They Can't Go, They Can't Go,

978
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,698
But You're Losing Money.

979
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,466
I Mean, The Quints
Are Only A Marketing Tool

980
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:37,001
For A Year, If That.

981
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:40,170
A Year?
It Must Be Longer.

982
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,638
Well, Maybe.

983
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:43,206
I Mean, If We Can Keep
The Quints In The News,

984
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:44,207
Not Just Commercials.

985
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:46,076
You Know,
Refresh The Story--

986
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,478
Only Quints In The State,
Blah, Blah, Blah--

987
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:51,214
Then Maybe We Can Squeeze
Another Year Out Of Them.

988
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:54,251
Um, College Funds
Would Be Nice.

989
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,018
Oh, Yeah. Sure, Jimbo.

990
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:57,354
Anything You Say.

991
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,523
Remember, I Only Do Well
If You Do Well,

992
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,724
But I Am Telling You,

993
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,692
Everything Must Be About The Quints, Everything!

994
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:05,562
We Must Focus, Focus,
Focus, Focus, Focus.

995
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:09,232
Albert Thought It Was
Cute To Say Things 5 Times.

996
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:12,034
Anyway, The Point Is
They Did Focus...

997
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:15,374
Though The Photographers
Didn't Always.

998
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:20,577
Mom Put Out A Quints
Commemorative <I>Milford Weekly.</I>

999
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:22,412
I Hated The Way My Siblings

1000
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:24,881
Were Always Referred To
As "The Quints",

1001
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:26,550
But I Guess I Was Alone.

1002
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,386
The Issue Sold Out 2 Printings
With No Pictures Of Me

1003
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,921
And None Of My Lame Poetry.

1004
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,857
Coincidence? I Think Not.

1005
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:36,126
And They Treat 'Em
Like A Unit.

1006
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,261
It's Quints This
And Quints That.

1007
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:40,530
I Mean, They're
5 Different Kids.

1008
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,399
And This Is All Albert's Fault, Right?

1009
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:46,469
Well, Maybe,
But My Mom's Going Along With It, No Problem,

1010
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:48,138
And My Dad's
Never Around.

1011
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,874
Look, Jamie, I Don't
Know Your Dad, But...

1012
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:52,475
Well, I Don't Know
Your Mom, Either,

1013
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:54,043
Now That I Think Of It,
So, Uh...

1014
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:55,045
You Can Forget
Everything I'm Gonna Say

1015
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,045
Before I Even Say It.

1016
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,280
I Always Do.

1017
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,381
Me, Too.

1018
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:00,884
I Told Jamie That Was An Art Club Rule.

1019
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:02,419
Oh, Thank You.

1020
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,121
Look, Hypothetically,

1021
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:07,290
I Think Your Parents
Are In A Situation

1022
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:11,461
That Has Completely Overwhelmed
Them, But, Jamie, Maybe...

1023
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:15,432
Maybe You Have Just Enough
Distance To See Things More Clearly.

1024
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,433
Talk To Them.

1025
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,768
Wait. No, Talking
Is Dangerous.

1026
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:20,737
What If They Ask
How School Is Going?

1027
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:22,105
Or What If I
Have To Tell Them

1028
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:23,573
I'm Not Doing
The Science Fair?

1029
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:26,643
Well, You Know,
You Can Direct The Conversation, Jamie,

1030
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:27,944
To Make Your Parents
See Your Point.

1031
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:29,980
Use What I Teach You
In Here.

1032
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,582
Cover Your Parents In Bright Red Paint?
Cool!

1033
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:34,684
No. I Was Thinking...

1034
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:38,254
That You Could Use Your
Observational Skills To...

1035
00:42:38,254 --> 00:42:41,191
Point Things Out In A Way
That Others Are Forced To See.

1036
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,361
But, You Know, If You Want
To Paint Your Parents,

1037
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,863
Far Be It From Me
To Stop You.

1038
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:57,007
So Here Was My Plan--

1039
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:01,511
Mix 5 Parts Quints
With 2 Parts Parents

1040
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:02,879
And One Part Jamie,

1041
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:05,319
Stir Until Frothy.

1042
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,353
Hey, Look At You.

1043
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:11,988
What're You Doin',
Your Schoolwork There?

1044
00:43:11,988 --> 00:43:14,791
Very Impressive.
Look At Our Little Dedicated Student.

1045
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:16,530
That's Me.

1046
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,636
A Busy Day Puts 'Em
To Sleep Every Time.

1047
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:28,038
Hey, Don't Stay Up
Too Late.

1048
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,372
Ok.

1049
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:37,981
Ok. Maybe They'll Stop.

1050
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:41,151
She Won't Stop.
That's Becky.

1051
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,919
How Do You Know?

1052
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:44,721
Because That's Becky's "Hold Me" Cry.

1053
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:46,189
See, If You
Don't Hold Her,

1054
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:47,557
Then She Won't
Stop Crying

1055
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:49,492
Until All The Other
Babies Are Up.

1056
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:56,232
Well, Let Me
Just Handle It. Ok?

1057
00:43:56,232 --> 00:43:58,668
Ok. Ok?
All Right. Come On.

1058
00:43:58,668 --> 00:44:01,237
There You Go. Ok.

1059
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,540
Ok.

1060
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,241
What Am I Doin' Wrong?

1061
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,912
That's Not Becky,
For Starters.

1062
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,447
It's The Second Bassinet.

1063
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:14,217
Dad, Look At The Baby In Your Arms.

1064
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:15,385
You See The Dimples?

1065
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:16,453
Yeah.

1066
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,787
Ok, Then You've
Got Charlie,

1067
00:44:17,787 --> 00:44:21,524
The Twinkly-Eyed, Curious,
Dimpled Little Boy.

1068
00:44:21,524 --> 00:44:23,193
Honey, They All
Have Daddy's Dimples,

1069
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,529
And I'm Telling You Right Now This Is Definitely Becky.
See?

1070
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:28,532
Hello. Not Becky.

1071
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:31,735
What Is Charlie Doin' In Becky's Bassinet?

1072
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,869
I Put Him There.

1073
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:33,870
Why?

1074
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,205
Honestly?

1075
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,706
I Wanted To See
If You Two

1076
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,041
Could Put Them Back
Where They Belong.

1077
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,877
Well, That's A Terrible Thing To Say, Jamie.

1078
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:42,312
We Love The Quints.

1079
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:43,947
I Know You Love Them,
Mom.

1080
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,752
Just Take This
As A, Uh, A Challenge.

1081
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:51,323
Ok, Fine.

1082
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,058
Don't Worry About It.
We'll Figure It Out.

1083
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:56,493
Mommy And Daddy
Will Figure It Out. Ok.

1084
00:44:56,493 --> 00:45:00,164
All Right. Adam.

1085
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:05,502
Oh. It's Not Adam.
This Is...

1086
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,503
Wait.

1087
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,438
What Do You See?

1088
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:11,841
Um, A Big Smile.

1089
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:13,243
And That Means?

1090
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:16,112
Eddie.

1091
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:17,014
Oh, Uh, Here.

1092
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:20,450
Hey, Hey.
Here We Go.

1093
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,186
Oh, Yeah.
Oh, There You Go.

1094
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:25,622
This Is Debbie.

1095
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,358
She Wrinkles Her Nose
All The Time, Dad.

1096
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:31,594
Honey, They All Wrinkle
Their Nose All The Time.

1097
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:33,697
Good Point.

1098
00:45:34,697 --> 00:45:36,132
Come On, Honey.
Come On. Come On.

1099
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:38,835
Oh, I Know This One.

1100
00:45:38,835 --> 00:45:40,703
This Is Daddy's
Big Boy Adam.

1101
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:43,339
Yes. The Biggest
And The Bounciest.

1102
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:45,975
See, Jamie,
We Know Our Kids.

1103
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:46,976
Well, Good,

1104
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:48,611
Because Sometimes
I Wonder If You Know

1105
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:49,979
That You Have
5 Babies,

1106
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:52,184
Not Just One Set
Of Quints.

1107
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,653
Well, No Matter What We've Got,
They Need Their Sleep.

1108
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,355
2 Baby Food Companies Are Going
To Interview Them Tomorrow,

1109
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,724
And I Know They're
Looking Forward To That.

1110
00:46:01,724 --> 00:46:03,027
Here You Go.

1111
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:06,366
Good Night.

1112
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:11,571
Good Night.

1113
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,873
The Truth Is
I Wasn't So Worried

1114
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:19,809
About My Siblings Being
Treated As Individuals.

1115
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:21,711
I Thought I Was,
But The Real Truth

1116
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:23,379
Is That I Could Tell
My Parents

1117
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:26,049
Were Trying To Force Their Hopes
And Dreams On The Quints,

1118
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,318
Just Like They Had
Done To Me All My Life.

1119
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,553
You Know, Maybe You Already
Saw This Coming,

1120
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:33,523
But This Was More About Me
Than The Quints.

1121
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,494
Come In.

1122
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:40,494
Ok?

1123
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:40,832
Sure.

1124
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:51,875
Jamie, I--
I Feel Terrible.

1125
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,578
I Do. I Couldn't Tell
My Own Babies Apart.

1126
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:57,780
It's Not That
I Don't Love 'Em.

1127
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,549
You Know I Love 'Em,
Right?

1128
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:00,783
I Know That.

1129
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:02,552
You've Been Working.

1130
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:06,525
Which I Know, In Your Words,
Is A Lame Excuse.

1131
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:11,528
You Know, I Remember
The Day You Were Born.

1132
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:14,464
You Were So Beautiful.

1133
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,733
We Were So Thrilled.

1134
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:20,036
You Know,
You Were Everything We Ever Dreamed Of.

1135
00:47:20,036 --> 00:47:21,704
I Was Just A Baby.

1136
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,975
That's Not Really
How It Works.

1137
00:47:25,975 --> 00:47:27,977
You Know,
You Were <I>Our</I> Baby.

1138
00:47:27,977 --> 00:47:30,580
You Were So
Beautiful And Perfect.

1139
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,948
Your Mother And I,
You Know,

1140
00:47:31,948 --> 00:47:34,717
We Vowed To Give You Anything You Would Ever Need.

1141
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:36,386
I Think We've Done That
Up To This Point.

1142
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:39,993
I Know We've Loved Doing
Every Minute Of It.

1143
00:47:43,993 --> 00:47:46,130
You Know, But The 5--

1144
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,999
I--I Don't Have A Plan,
You Know?

1145
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,901
I Don't Know
What I'm Doing.

1146
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:54,837
Just Love 'Em, Dad.

1147
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:57,275
Love 'Em Like You Love Me.

1148
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:01,012
I Will.

1149
00:48:04,012 --> 00:48:05,014
You Know What?
I Think That I Love You

1150
00:48:06,014 --> 00:48:08,520
As Much Today As I Did
The Day You Were Born.

1151
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,521
Maybe More.

1152
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:16,528
Ok. Ha Ha.

1153
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,530
Over The Next
Month Or So,

1154
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,165
Dad Really Did Try.

1155
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,367
He Tried So Hard,
In Fact,

1156
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:27,270
That He Got Sucked Into
The Whole Team-Quints Thing.

1157
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,974
As For Me,
I Decided It Was Time To Focus On The New Me.

1158
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,942
Yes, Me As An Individual.

1159
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:34,344
So,
You Gonna Tell 'Em?

1160
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,513
I Even Vowed To Let Mom
And Dad In On The Changes...

1161
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:38,848
Slowly, Of Course.

1162
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:40,149
Oh, Hi, Jamie.

1163
00:48:40,149 --> 00:48:41,684
I Can't Make
Dinner Tonight,

1164
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:44,354
But We're Still On For The
Parent-Teacher Conferences Tomorrow.

1165
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,989
Your Dad And I
Are Very Excited.

1166
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,657
You Know,
I Really Like This One.

1167
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:49,125
I Mean,
I Like The Two-Tone.

1168
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:51,127
Let's Compare It
Against The Strollers.

1169
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:55,032
So, Mom, I, Uh,
I Wanted To Tell You About Science... Fair.

1170
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:59,970
I'm Not Entering
This Year, Ok?

1171
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,872
Great.

1172
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:04,540
You're My Witness,
Zoe.

1173
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,342
I Told Her.

1174
00:49:06,342 --> 00:49:07,343
I'll Back You Up,
Jamesy.

1175
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:08,811
That's What Friends
Are For.

1176
00:49:08,811 --> 00:49:11,047
Unless She's Mad.
Then You're On Your Own.

1177
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:12,582
Gee, Thanks.

1178
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,518
Come On.
Let's Go Up To My Room And Listen To That Cd.

1179
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:17,021
For Once,
Mom Didn't Seem To Care

1180
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,056
If I Won
A Blue Ribbon Or Not.

1181
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:21,157
I Liked That New Attitude.

1182
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:22,492
I Was Even Starting To Think

1183
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:25,061
That Parent-Teacher Conferences Wouldn't Be So Bad.

1184
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,863
Oh, The Grovers.
What A Pleasure.

1185
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,564
I Have Heard
So Much About You.

1186
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:30,000
Mr. Blackmer,
How Ya Doin'? Good, Good.

1187
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,568
I Can Barely Contain
Myself Another Second.

1188
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:35,538
I Must Tell You,
Jamie Is Such A Special Talent.

1189
00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:39,275
In Fact, She's Getting
An A-Plus In My Class.

1190
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:42,378
Ohh, Ohh, My Little Girl,
An A-Plus.

1191
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:44,347
It's The Happiest
Day Of My Life.

1192
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:45,548
Oh, We Have To
Celebrate!

1193
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:46,549
A Party.

1194
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:47,550
Yes, A Party.

1195
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,018
All This
For Me?

1196
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:49,018
Yes, For You.
You Deserve It.

1197
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:51,021
You Got
An A-Plus!

1198
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:03,766
You're Not Buying This,
Are You?

1199
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:06,702
Good, 'Cause If You Thought
This Was What Really Happened,

1200
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:08,771
You Weren't
Paying Attention.

1201
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:12,241
Now, Go To Detention.

1202
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:15,762
You Wanna Know
What Really Happened?

1203
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:35,098
Face It, Jamie.
You Been Stood Up.

1204
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,232
I Just...

1205
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,501
I Mean,
We Knew Your Parents Wouldn't Come,

1206
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:41,304
But This Is My Mom And
Dad We're Talking About.

1207
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:45,508
I Mean, Why Would I Work So Hard At
School For Them If They Don't Even Care?

1208
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:47,510
The Grades Are For You.

1209
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,679
Where Would I Be If
I Did It For My Folks?

1210
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,581
It's Different
For You.

1211
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,182
You're A Genius.

1212
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:54,617
It's Not Different.

1213
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:57,354
I'm Happy When I Do Well.
You Should Be, Too.

1214
00:50:58,354 --> 00:51:01,491
Yeah, Well,
They Still Should Have Been Here.

1215
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,092
Yeah, I Agree,

1216
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:06,763
But Go Tell Them, Jamie.
Don't Tell Me.

1217
00:51:07,763 --> 00:51:09,632
Wacky, Huh?

1218
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:13,169
Here I Was About To Yell At My
Parents For <I>Not</I> Paying Attention.

1219
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:16,205
Once Again, The Thing I Thought
Would Solve All My Problems Hadn't.

1220
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:19,208
Man, Life Sure Is Tricky.

1221
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,310
Did All Of Our
Baby-Sitters Quit?

1222
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,513
I Hope Not.

1223
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,349
No Surprise Disasters
While I Been Gone?

1224
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,783
What Are You
Talking About, Jamie?

1225
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:29,485
What Am I
Talking About?

1226
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:32,356
Hello?
Parent-Teacher Conferences.

1227
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,658
Oh, No, Honey.
Did We...

1228
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:37,960
That Was Tonight, Honey?
I'm So Sorry.

1229
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,362
I Know I Wrote It
In My Planner.

1230
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,864
So?
What Happened?

1231
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,866
I Had To Work
Overtime.

1232
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:46,836
And Tomorrow's Such A Big Day, Honey.
I Got Caught Up.

1233
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:50,072
Tomorrow's Big? You Know,
Today Was Kind Of Key.

1234
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:51,674
I Know, I Know,

1235
00:51:51,674 --> 00:51:55,411
But The Quints Have Their First
National Commercial Tomorrow.

1236
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:56,412
It's The Big Time,
Jamie.

1237
00:51:56,412 --> 00:51:57,914
But, Honey,

1238
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,220
You Have Every Right
To Be Mad At Us.

1239
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,189
Do You Know What
Could Make This Better?

1240
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,023
Turning Back Time?

1241
00:52:08,023 --> 00:52:11,827
I Can't Do That,
But You Know What Might Help?

1242
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:14,530
I Could Talk To Albert About
Getting You Into The Commercial.

1243
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,367
That's Not Gonna
Make It Better.

1244
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:20,536
Look, I Know We've Been Way
Too Focused On The Quints,

1245
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:21,871
And I'm Sorry...

1246
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:24,674
But This Way, You Could
Be Part Of That With Us.

1247
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,876
Really?
All Of Us, Together?

1248
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:28,011
Yeah, You Know What?
That Is A Great Idea.

1249
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:30,680
Tomorrow Can Start
The New Beginning

1250
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,049
Of A Whole New Way Of Life For This Entire Family.

1251
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,050
Uh, Whatever.

1252
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,220
Albert's Not
Gonna Go For It.

1253
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,554
Uh, Do You Guys
Have A Second?

1254
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:40,723
Jamie Wants To Be
In The Commercial.

1255
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:42,627
Yeah, And We Think
It's A Great Idea.

1256
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:46,197
Sure, By All Means.

1257
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:49,032
Now, Can I Talk To You
About Thursday?

1258
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:51,701
Hey, Huh?

1259
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:54,303
Believe It Or Not,
That's For Real.

1260
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:57,072
It Was A Shock To Me, Too.
It Was Good, Though.

1261
00:52:57,072 --> 00:52:58,708
I Needed To Rejoin
The Family.

1262
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,809
Action.

1263
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:04,050
The Grover Quints Use Cutie Pants Diapers.

1264
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,085
Jim! I--I Need
To Speak To You.

1265
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:12,221
What? Huh?

1266
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:13,889
So, Jamie Won't Come
Out Of The Truck.

1267
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:14,890
What?

1268
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:15,891
She Won't Come Out
Of The Truck.

1269
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:16,892
Why Not?

1270
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:17,893
She Has To Be Ready
In 5 Minutes.

1271
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:18,894
She Won't Come Out
Of The Truck.

1272
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:19,895
Look, Albert,
It's Gonna Be Fine.

1273
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:20,896
I'll Handle It, Ok?

1274
00:53:20,896 --> 00:53:22,632
It'll Be Fine.
Breathe, Buddy.

1275
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,400
Breathe, Breathe, Breathe.

1276
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,837
Hey, Uh...

1277
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:28,971
Honey, Come On Out.

1278
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:30,273
No.

1279
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:31,674
You See?

1280
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:33,409
Honey, It's Daddy.
Everything's Fine.

1281
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:34,677
Come On Out.
Come On.

1282
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:37,179
No, I'm Not
Gonna Do This.

1283
00:53:37,179 --> 00:53:40,116
Jamie, You Get To Be Part Of The Grover-Quints Magic.

1284
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,117
You Can Do It.

1285
00:53:46,522 --> 00:53:50,192
I Want A Different Part.

1286
00:53:50,192 --> 00:53:52,029
Now... There Are
Actors Out There

1287
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,364
Who Would Be Grateful
To Wear That Diaper.

1288
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:58,768
Then Call One Of Them.

1289
00:53:58,768 --> 00:53:59,769
No, Wait.

1290
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,507
Jamie, Wait.

1291
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,010
I Know.
That Was Great!

1292
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,012
Oh, Jamie,
I Can't Believe You Missed It.

1293
00:54:10,012 --> 00:54:12,515
The Quints
Were Fantastic.

1294
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,385
Yeah, Whatever.

1295
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:19,655
I'm Sorry Things
Didn't Work Out, Jamie.

1296
00:54:19,655 --> 00:54:21,691
You Know, It Would
Have Been Really Great

1297
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,025
Having You Dancing Alongside
Your Brothers And Sisters.

1298
00:54:24,025 --> 00:54:25,861
Of Course,
They Would Have Been Front And Center

1299
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,196
As We've Agreed,

1300
00:54:27,196 --> 00:54:29,832
But You Could Have Been
Part Of The Magic. Ha.

1301
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:30,900
Oh, It Just Would
Have Been Nice

1302
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,034
If You Had Been There With Them,
You Know?

1303
00:54:33,034 --> 00:54:35,070
Remember, Jamie,
To Help The Family,

1304
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,906
We All Need
To Think Quints.

1305
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,842
So, It's All About
The Quints, Huh?

1306
00:54:39,842 --> 00:54:41,043
What About Me?

1307
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:43,379
Well, You're Still
Our Jamie, Honey.

1308
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:44,413
That Hasn't Changed.

1309
00:54:44,413 --> 00:54:46,482
No, Of Course It Hasn't,

1310
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:48,484
But The Quints
As A Marketing Unit

1311
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:49,852
Are Already
Running Out Of Steam.

1312
00:54:49,852 --> 00:54:51,821
I Mean, We Need To Keep
Pushing Them Out There,

1313
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,023
And We Need To Refresh The
Story In A Noncommercial Way.

1314
00:54:55,023 --> 00:54:59,696
We Need News,
And Now Is Not The Time For Any Of Us To Be Selfish.

1315
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:02,765
Here's Another
Little Life Lesson.

1316
00:55:02,765 --> 00:55:05,868
Sometimes When Someone
Tells You Not To Be Selfish,

1317
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:08,537
It's Because
They Are Selfish.

1318
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:09,839
So, What's Up?

1319
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:10,005
Big Problems
At Home?

1320
00:55:11,005 --> 00:55:14,043
Yeah, It's Quints This,
Quints That.

1321
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:15,845
It's Like
I've Disappeared.

1322
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,913
Maybe You Should Run Around
Naked And Pee On People.

1323
00:55:17,913 --> 00:55:19,217
That Always Gets Laughs.

1324
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,220
That's Cuter From A Baby,
Not From An Invisible Child.

1325
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,422
But I Thought
That's What You Wanted.

1326
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:28,090
You Were So Happy When
They Had The Quints.

1327
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,959
Ok, So, I Was Wrong.

1328
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,193
Is That What
You Wanted To Hear?

1329
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:33,462
No, I Want To Hear That You're Going To Make Them

1330
00:55:33,462 --> 00:55:34,463
Pay Attention To You!

1331
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:37,199
Whoa, Angry Brat.
Never Seen That.

1332
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:38,701
You Found Yourself,
Jamie.

1333
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:40,469
Now Don't Let Anyone
Take You For Granted.

1334
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:42,036
Show Your Parents
The Real You.

1335
00:55:42,036 --> 00:55:43,038
They Don't Care.

1336
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:44,039
Oh, Give Me A Break.

1337
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:45,207
They're Distracted,
Sure,

1338
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:47,209
But Think Back
Before The Quints.

1339
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:48,244
You Know
How Much They Care.

1340
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:49,245
That Was Caring?

1341
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,880
They Drove Me Nuts.

1342
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,916
I Would Give Every Blue Ribbon I've Ever Gotten

1343
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:57,420
For One Look...
Like Your Mom Gives You

1344
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,223
When You Walk Through The
Door After A Day At School.

1345
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:03,259
Ok, So, Fine.

1346
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,560
They Love Me.

1347
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,229
Man, I Can't Believe You Talked Me To Come Here.

1348
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:10,139
It's Ruined My Day.

1349
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:19,642
It's Not As Easy
As He Says, You Know.

1350
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:20,776
He Didn't Say
It Was Easy.

1351
00:56:20,776 --> 00:56:21,977
He Just Said
To Deal With It.

1352
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:23,179
It's Not Fair.

1353
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,848
The Quints Were Supposed
To Make Everything Easier.

1354
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:28,951
Now They've Just
Mucked Everything Up.

1355
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:31,420
Deep In Conversation,
I See.

1356
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,255
May I Intrude?

1357
00:56:33,255 --> 00:56:36,692
Is Magnet Really The Better School For Me,
Mr. Blackmer?

1358
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:39,528
Yeah, Great Chattin' With Ya.
Bye, Now.

1359
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:42,131
No, Seriously.

1360
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:45,668
Yes, Washington
Is A Great School, Jamie,

1361
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,936
But It's Geared
To Math And Science.

1362
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,104
Grades Rule.

1363
00:56:49,104 --> 00:56:51,607
But People Go To College
From G.W.

1364
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:53,709
Yeah, Well,
They Go To College From Milford High, Too.

1365
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:55,043
Plus, If It Matters,

1366
00:56:55,043 --> 00:56:57,646
Milford's Got
A Much Better Art Program.

1367
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:58,014
Some Of The Most Successful
People In Life

1368
00:56:59,014 --> 00:57:00,216
Haven't Even
Finished High School,

1369
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,016
And There Are
College Graduates

1370
00:57:02,016 --> 00:57:03,886
Who Never Amount
To Anything...

1371
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:05,521
And Do You Know
What The Secret Is?

1372
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:06,789
No Clue.

1373
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:07,857
Me, Neither.

1374
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,525
Ah, Shoot.

1375
00:57:09,525 --> 00:57:11,227
I Was Hoping...

1376
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,962
Aw, Well.

1377
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:16,532
Look, Jamie,
I Can Promise You This.

1378
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:19,168
Life Will Go On
If You Don't Get Into G.W.,

1379
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:21,203
And You'll Still Have
Every Chance Of Succeeding

1380
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:23,205
As Long
As You Try Hard.

1381
00:57:23,205 --> 00:57:25,574
Your Future
Always Lies With You.

1382
00:57:25,574 --> 00:57:27,376
Plus, I Know This.

1383
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:28,978
You Have
A Lot Of Talent,

1384
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:32,047
And You've Found Something
That You Love.

1385
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:34,316
I Wish My Parents
Could See That.

1386
00:57:34,316 --> 00:57:37,419
All Right, Well, Then,
Why Don't You Try Telling Them

1387
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:40,356
That Your Sketches Are Going
To Be Part Of The Main Exhibit

1388
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,023
At The School Art Show.

1389
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:44,862
Yeah, Right,
Like They'd Really--

1390
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:48,197
Are You Kidding Me?

1391
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:49,765
Heh Heh. Nope.

1392
00:57:49,765 --> 00:57:51,001
Jamie,
Your Stuff Is Great.

1393
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,003
You Really Capture
Those Kids.

1394
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,704
Look, I Was Gonna Tell You
The Good News Later,

1395
00:57:55,704 --> 00:57:57,540
But This Seemed Like
A Perfect Moment.

1396
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,707
Holy Cow.

1397
00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:01,043
He Isn't Kidding.

1398
00:58:01,043 --> 00:58:02,878
Jamie, Excellent.
I'm Gonna Tell Everyone

1399
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:05,248
I Knew You Before
You Were Famous.

1400
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:08,884
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yay.

1401
00:58:08,884 --> 00:58:10,886
Ok, Everyone
At The Table.

1402
00:58:10,886 --> 00:58:13,054
I Have An Announcement
To Make.

1403
00:58:14,723 --> 00:58:18,362
Well...
This Is Very Exciting.

1404
00:58:20,362 --> 00:58:25,202
My Drawings Are Going To Be In The
Main Exhibit At The School Art Show.

1405
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:28,704
And That's Good?

1406
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:31,707
Art Show...
And Your Point Is?

1407
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:35,444
Hey, Come On, This Is
A Really, Really Big Honor.

1408
00:58:35,444 --> 00:58:38,747
Well, Honey,
Why Would We Care About You Getting An Honor?

1409
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:40,916
Jamie, We've Never Cared
About That Type Of Thing.

1410
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,219
Are You Feeling Ok?

1411
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:47,389
Oh, Come On, Now, People.
I'm Just Messing With You.

1412
00:58:47,389 --> 00:58:49,225
Now, Where Were We?

1413
00:58:50,225 --> 00:58:52,261
In The Main Exhibit?

1414
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:54,630
Why, That's Quite An Honor,
Isn't It?

1415
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,900
Yes. Only One Person
Gets Chosen From Each Class.

1416
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,169
And You Know, I Wasn't Even Really Trying.
It Just Kind Of Happened.

1417
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,403
No!

1418
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:02,571
It Didn't Just Happen.

1419
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:03,839
It Happened Because
My Little Girl

1420
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,107
Has Her Dad's
Artistic Eye.

1421
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:07,242
Mmm! That's
How It Happened.

1422
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:09,445
Main Exhibit, Huh?
Ha! Wow!

1423
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,447
Mr. Blackmer Says
My Stuff Is Really Good.

1424
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:14,416
It's All Drawings Of Adam And Becky And Charlie--

1425
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:17,686
The Quints.
Yes, We've Seen You Draw Them.

1426
00:59:17,686 --> 00:59:20,122
You Must Be Very Good, Jamie. Congratulations.

1427
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:21,690
Why, Thank You, Albert.

1428
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:22,925
Ok, I Have To Go To Work.
Hey, Wait A Second.

1429
00:59:22,925 --> 00:59:24,326
When Can We
See The Exhibit?

1430
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:25,628
Gala Opening In 4 Days,

1431
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:26,662
Saturday Night.

1432
00:59:26,662 --> 00:59:27,662
Be There.

1433
00:59:26,662 --> 00:59:27,830
Absolutely.

1434
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:28,831
Oh.

1435
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,699
Mmm!
Love You, Honey.

1436
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:31,700
See You, Albert.

1437
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,701
Bye.

1438
00:59:32,701 --> 00:59:35,537
Oh, This Is
So Wonderful.

1439
00:59:35,537 --> 00:59:36,639
Yup.

1440
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,307
Things Were Good Again.

1441
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:40,709
Best Of All,
I Had Found Myself,

1442
00:59:40,709 --> 00:59:43,679
And My Parents Had Found
The New Me And Embraced Me.

1443
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,848
Now, That Happy Ending

1444
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,850
Can't Be Too Far Away Now,
Can It?

1445
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,386
The Saturday School Art Show
Made This A Big Week,

1446
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,621
But It Kept Getting
Bigger And Bigger.

1447
00:59:52,621 --> 00:59:54,390
Hey, There She Is,
Our Budding Van Gogh.

1448
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,825
Mmm! Mmm!
Good Morning.

1449
00:59:56,825 --> 00:59:57,893
Morning.

1450
00:59:57,893 --> 00:59:59,695
Oh, I Asked Mr. Blackmer To Save You Seats

1451
00:59:59,695 --> 00:00:01,964
At The Awards Ceremony.
I Hope That Was Ok.

1452
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:04,065
Anything You Want.
It's Your Night.

1453
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,671
Good Morning.

1454
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:11,674
No, No, Strike That.
It's A Great Morning.

1455
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,409
Hey, Albert, What's,
Uh-- What's Goin' On?

1456
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,411
Did You Just Get Paid Today?

1457
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,713
Well, In A Sense,
We All Did.

1458
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:19,815
Jim, Nancy...

1459
01:00:19,815 --> 01:00:21,750
I Have Created A Huge
Media Moment For You.

1460
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,819
We Will Refresh The Story
Of The Quints

1461
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,421
In A Totally New Way.

1462
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,421
It's A Winner.

1463
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,490
Yeah?

1464
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,526
"The Governor's Parents
Of The Year Gala Dinner."

1465
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:31,827
We're Invited?

1466
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:33,029
It's Better Than That.

1467
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:35,230
You're The Guests Of Honor.

1468
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,099
Oh, I Am Good.

1469
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:39,668
We Are Parents
Of The Year?

1470
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:41,904
Ha Ha.
That's Amazing, Albert.

1471
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,173
I Have Been Lobbying
For This From The Start.

1472
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:47,743
The Exposure, The Prestige,
This Is A Real Break.

1473
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,045
This Could Add A Good Year
To The Quints' Glory Time.

1474
01:00:51,045 --> 01:00:52,715
Parents Of The Year...

1475
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:53,284
It's Such An Honor.

1476
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,285
Oh.

1477
01:00:57,286 --> 01:01:00,526
Thank You, Albert.
That's Fantastic.

1478
01:01:04,526 --> 01:01:07,763
And It's For Us, Jim,
Not Just The Quints.

1479
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:10,065
It's Nice
To Be Recognized.

1480
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:12,568
Oh.

1481
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,236
I'm Gonna Go
Tell The Quints.

1482
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:16,205
They'll Be
So Proud.

1483
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,707
Whoa. I'd Better Get To Work...
Dad Of The Year.

1484
01:01:18,707 --> 01:01:20,209
Ha Ha. Ok.

1485
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,210
Thanks, Albert.

1486
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,234
Ok, Then. Ahh.

1487
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:57,312
Morning, Jamie.

1488
01:01:57,312 --> 01:01:59,982
Wow.
She Sure Is Moving.

1489
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:16,533
Jamie, What Are You Doing?

1490
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,369
Jamie, Hey.
Jamie, Stop It.

1491
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,838
Give That Back!
It's Mine!

1492
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:24,773
Give It To Me!
It's Mine.

1493
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:26,642
Give It Back!

1494
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,110
Tell Us What's Wrong.

1495
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,348
James,
What Happened?

1496
01:02:33,348 --> 01:02:36,719
My Parents Are Gonna
Go Meet The Governor.

1497
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:40,355
Uh, Uh, That Would
Really Bother Me, Too.

1498
01:02:40,355 --> 01:02:43,125
No! They're
Parents Of The Year.

1499
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:45,127
Right, And This
Makes You Mad?

1500
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:49,865
There's This Big Dinner
In Their Honor,

1501
01:02:49,865 --> 01:02:52,968
And It's The Same Night
As The Art Show...

1502
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:56,041
And Guess Which One They're Going To.
Just Guess.

1503
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,511
It's Not Fair,
You Know?

1504
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:07,683
I Finally Do Somethin' That
Should Make Them Proud Of Me,

1505
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,853
But It's Just--
It's Not Enough.

1506
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,688
I Mean,
I Try My Best,

1507
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,424
But They Just
Forget About Me Anyway.

1508
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,192
They Didn't
Forget About You.

1509
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:18,827
Yes, They Did.

1510
01:03:18,827 --> 01:03:21,597
They Said That They Were Going To The Dinner.

1511
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,432
They Knew
Which Night It Was.

1512
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:27,203
We Were Just Talking
About The Art Show....

1513
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:30,372
Right Then.

1514
01:03:30,372 --> 01:03:31,440
I Mean,
What's The Point?

1515
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,608
No Matter What I Do,

1516
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,412
It's Never
Gonna Be Enough.

1517
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:38,547
Wow.

1518
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:43,218
You Sure Do
Rip Fast, Huh?

1519
01:03:43,218 --> 01:03:47,222
Hey, That's Ok.
It's All Right. Uh...

1520
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:49,625
It Looks Like We Still Have A Few Here.

1521
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,759
I'll Let You
Make Some More.

1522
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:53,862
I'm Not Going To The Art Show,
Mr. Blackmer.

1523
01:03:53,862 --> 01:03:56,198
Didn't You Hear
Anything I Said?

1524
01:03:56,198 --> 01:03:58,700
Hey, I Turned Down
A Lot Of Dates

1525
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,203
To Be Free
That Saturday Night.

1526
01:04:01,203 --> 01:04:03,839
Well, I Don't Want
To Go There Anymore.

1527
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,974
I'll Just Stay Home
With The Quints

1528
01:04:05,974 --> 01:04:07,976
And Let My Parents
Have Their Fun.

1529
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:09,545
That's Not What You Really Want To Do,
Is It?

1530
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:13,248
It Is.

1531
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:15,550
Fine, Then.

1532
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:16,952
Well, Your Art
Will Be Lonely,

1533
01:04:16,952 --> 01:04:19,554
And We'll Miss You,
But, You,

1534
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:20,589
Since You're Not
A Teacher,

1535
01:04:20,589 --> 01:04:22,431
You Have To Do
What You Have To Do.

1536
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:32,601
And That's The Way
Things Went For A Few Days.

1537
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:34,469
I Wasn't Really Happy.

1538
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:36,605
I Felt Like Maybe I Didn't
Know Myself After All,

1539
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:40,842
And I Honestly Felt Like
I Wasn't Even Part Of My Family.

1540
01:04:40,842 --> 01:04:44,079
Focus, Focus, Focus,
Focus, Focus, Focus.

1541
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,847
Good Morning, Jamie.

1542
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:46,014
What's Goin' On?

1543
01:04:47,014 --> 01:04:49,418
Nothing.
I'm Late.

1544
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,520
Ok, Ok, Before We Do
The Card Thing,

1545
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,424
Did You Hear The One About The
Eskimo Who Died Of Cold Cuts?

1546
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,426
He Stabbed Himself
With An Icicle.

1547
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:58,593
Ha Ha Ha.
Ha Ha.

1548
01:04:58,593 --> 01:05:01,163
I Appreciate
The Effort, Guys,

1549
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,364
But Can We Just
Get This Over With?

1550
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:04,766
Ok.

1551
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:08,804
We Want As!

1552
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,706
Straight As, Brad?

1553
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,807
You're Boring.

1554
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:13,642
Uh, Look At You,
Jamie.

1555
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:15,210
I See An "A."

1556
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,778
It's Just
In Art Class.

1557
01:05:16,778 --> 01:05:19,681
Well, It's An "A"
And No Cs?

1558
01:05:19,681 --> 01:05:22,385
It's Your Best
Report Card Ever.

1559
01:05:23,385 --> 01:05:24,020
You Taking Smart Pills?

1560
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,193
I Was Just
Having Fun, You Know?

1561
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,795
Give Your Parents
Another Chance, Jamie.

1562
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:34,863
I Think You All
Know By Now

1563
01:05:34,863 --> 01:05:37,199
Is That It's All In How You See It, Right?

1564
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,700
I Mean,
What Would Have Happened Here...

1565
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,735
If Picasso
Had Been Told--

1566
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:41,636
Excuse Me, Mr. Blackmer.

1567
01:05:41,636 --> 01:05:44,041
Start Drawing The Cubes.
Start From The Left.

1568
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:48,316
Huh?

1569
01:05:54,316 --> 01:05:58,687
Everything's Fine,
But There's Something You Need To Know.

1570
01:05:59,688 --> 01:06:02,708
Obviously,
Everything Wasn't Fine.

1571
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:21,410
Is He Ok?
Is He Ok?

1572
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,045
He's Fine.
He's Fine.

1573
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,212
What Happened?

1574
01:06:24,212 --> 01:06:25,614
His Temperature
Just Shot Up.

1575
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,752
He Was So Hot,
But He's Ok. He's--

1576
01:06:30,752 --> 01:06:33,555
It's Ok, Honey.
He's Gonna Be Fine.

1577
01:06:33,555 --> 01:06:35,857
He Just--
He Looks So Helpless.

1578
01:06:35,857 --> 01:06:39,195
He's A Baby.
He Is Helpless.

1579
01:06:40,195 --> 01:06:41,630
I'm Scared.

1580
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,366
Honey, You Don't
Have To Be Scared Now.

1581
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:47,036
No, Not Just For Him.

1582
01:06:49,036 --> 01:06:52,207
I'm Scared That Things
Are Ruined Between Us.

1583
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:53,642
Well, That's
Not Possible.

1584
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,744
We Are Always
Here For You.

1585
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:59,115
Absolutely,
Jamie, Always.

1586
01:07:00,115 --> 01:07:02,083
You Know How
You Kept Telling Us

1587
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,886
The Quints Were
5 Different People?

1588
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,955
Well, I Heard You,
But...

1589
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:08,590
I Didn't Understand.

1590
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,225
They Seemed Like
A Unit, You Know?

1591
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:11,893
I Could
Plan For One. I--

1592
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:14,330
Honey, I Just
Couldn't Plan For 5.

1593
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,000
And Then, Dashing
To The Hospital Today...

1594
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,069
It Wasn't The Quints
Who Were Sick.

1595
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:22,505
It Was Adam.

1596
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:24,774
Sweet Little Adam.

1597
01:07:25,774 --> 01:07:28,411
Yeah,
Sweet Little Adam.

1598
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:32,482
That's One Poor, Sick,
Little Baby Boy.

1599
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,851
I'm My Own Person, Too,
You Know?

1600
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,185
Of Course You Are,
Honey.

1601
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:39,621
No, I Mean...

1602
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:42,991
I'm Not Really Sure If
I Want The Same Things

1603
01:07:42,991 --> 01:07:44,926
That You Want For Me.

1604
01:07:44,926 --> 01:07:47,295
You Don't Want
To Go To College?

1605
01:07:47,295 --> 01:07:51,199
Maybe. Probably.

1606
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:53,003
I Just-- I Want To Find My Own Way.

1607
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:58,039
I Don't Want To Follow
Your Plan, Dad.

1608
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:00,041
I Want My Own.

1609
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:04,045
I Only Wanted
What Was Best For Ya.

1610
01:08:04,045 --> 01:08:05,347
Me, Too.

1611
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,948
That's Why
We Try So Hard.

1612
01:08:06,948 --> 01:08:08,016
I Know That.

1613
01:08:09,016 --> 01:08:12,821
It's Just,
I May Never Be A Straight-A Student...

1614
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:14,990
Certainly Not
A Science-Fair Whiz,

1615
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,693
But, Um...

1616
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:21,163
I Guess With Art...

1617
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:24,201
I Finally Found Something That Makes Me Happy.

1618
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:29,371
I'm Working
Really Hard At It.

1619
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,876
Can't That Be Enough?

1620
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:38,215
Oh, Honey,
It's More Than Enough.

1621
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:42,417
Honey, We Only Wanted These
Things That We Wanted For You

1622
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:45,187
Because We Wanted You
To Be Happy.

1623
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:46,021
That's--

1624
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:49,925
Jamie, That's The Only Point Of The Plan.

1625
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:51,860
Look At You.

1626
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,863
You Figured It Out
On Your Own.

1627
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:58,200
I Found Myself.

1628
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,207
I Found Me.

1629
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,309
Who Made You So Smart?

1630
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,110
I Don't Know.

1631
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,246
I Don't Know.
You Guys, I Guess.

1632
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,385
I Came As Soon As I Heard.

1633
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:18,753
Everything's Fine.

1634
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:20,355
Ohh, Great.

1635
01:09:20,355 --> 01:09:22,891
You Know I Knew That It Would
Be Adam Who Got Into Trouble.

1636
01:09:22,891 --> 01:09:25,126
Little Boys Always
Make Me Nervous.

1637
01:09:25,126 --> 01:09:27,896
So, Tell Me, How Long's
He Gonna Be Out For?

1638
01:09:28,897 --> 01:09:30,265
A Week, Maybe 2.

1639
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:33,868
Oh, No, No, No, No.
This Is Bad. We Have Gigs.

1640
01:09:33,868 --> 01:09:36,105
Oh, Well,
I'll Tell His Doctors.

1641
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:38,707
Can't We Postpone?

1642
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:42,077
No. No. That Doesn't
Make Us Look Good.

1643
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,712
The World Wants
Healthy Babies.

1644
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:46,881
I Wonder...

1645
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:47,882
How Old Is He?

1646
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:50,785
The Same Age As They All Are, Albert.

1647
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:51,886
5 Months.

1648
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:53,455
Oh, Yeah.

1649
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:54,889
Ok,
Go With Me On This.

1650
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:56,891
We Find Another
Matching Baby

1651
01:09:56,891 --> 01:10:00,060
Just For This Week. Same Size...
No One Will Know The Difference, Right?

1652
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:03,298
Oh, Albert, Maybe
I Can Substitute.

1653
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:06,168
It's All About The Quints.
You Can't Be Part Of The Picture.

1654
01:10:07,168 --> 01:10:11,508
No, Albert, You Can't Be
Part Of The Picture.

1655
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:15,343
You're Fired.

1656
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:18,747
What--

1657
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,348
You Must Be Kidding, Jim.
I Saved You.

1658
01:10:20,348 --> 01:10:21,016
Yeah, And You've Been
Well Paid For It.

1659
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:23,586
Now Just... Go Away.

1660
01:10:24,586 --> 01:10:26,021
Nancy, Please,
Tell Him This Is A Mistake.

1661
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:28,193
I Mean...

1662
01:10:32,193 --> 01:10:34,633
You've Overstayed
Your Welcome, Albert.

1663
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:39,701
What--

1664
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:42,203
Ok, Fine, Fine.
We Won't Replace Adam.

1665
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:43,204
You'll Lose Business, But--

1666
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:45,975
But At Least
We'll Have Our Family.

1667
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:49,845
Good-Bye, Albert.

1668
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:55,850
Weird, Huh?

1669
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:57,686
It Should Have Been
A Terrible Day,

1670
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:02,462
But, Suddenly, I Felt Better
Than I Had In A Long Time.

1671
01:11:07,462 --> 01:11:09,831
I Never Mentioned
The Art Show Again.

1672
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:12,300
I Decided That
Helping Out My Parents

1673
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,502
Was More Important
Than Being With My Art.

1674
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:16,204
Art Would Always Be Around,

1675
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:18,873
But My Parents Might Never
Be Parents Of The Year Again.

1676
01:11:18,873 --> 01:11:22,042
So I Agreed To Baby-Sit The Quints With Brad And Zoe

1677
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:24,913
While The Folks
Went To Get Their Award.

1678
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,682
Thank You.
Thank You Very Much.

1679
01:11:27,682 --> 01:11:30,885
Whoa!
Grovers Looking Sharp.

1680
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:33,885
Thank You.

1681
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:33,054
Thank You Very Much.

1682
01:11:33,054 --> 01:11:34,689
Ok, You Guys
Gonna Be All Right?

1683
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:35,757
Yes,
Of Course.

1684
01:11:35,757 --> 01:11:37,492
I Love You.
Call Us If You Need Anything.

1685
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:38,493
I'm So
Excited.

1686
01:11:38,493 --> 01:11:39,761
Good-Bye.
Ok, Honey. Thanks.

1687
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:41,696
Ok, Good-Bye.
Don't Let Him Touch Your Stuff.

1688
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:43,231
Ok, Bye.

1689
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:44,332
Have Fun, Guys.

1690
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:46,369
All Right,
Thank You.

1691
01:11:54,409 --> 01:11:57,409
Whoo-Hoo!

1692
01:11:54,409 --> 01:11:57,081
Whoo-Hoo, Yes!

1693
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:02,951
Governor Healy,
The Grovers Are Here.

1694
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,352
Oh, Ooh.

1695
01:12:04,352 --> 01:12:08,523
Ahh, The Grovers.
What A Pleasure.

1696
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:10,392
This Is Such
A Big Night.

1697
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,261
We've Got Press Here From Every Paper In The State.

1698
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:14,529
It's Really
Remarkable.

1699
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:16,731
Oh, Well,
It's Really An Honor For Us, Sir, Really.

1700
01:12:16,731 --> 01:12:19,367
And Your Adorable Quintuplets Are Where, Exactly?

1701
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:22,036
At Home,
All Snug And Warm.

1702
01:12:23,037 --> 01:12:25,540
That's Very Funny.

1703
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,074
You're Making Jokes
With The Governor.

1704
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,745
But Where Are They,
Really?

1705
01:12:30,745 --> 01:12:32,647
5 Minutes
After My Parents Left,

1706
01:12:32,647 --> 01:12:35,283
I Noticed That They Had
Forgotten A Small Detail,

1707
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:37,318
Well, 5 Small Details.

1708
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:39,052
They Were Gonna Look
Really Bad.

1709
01:12:39,052 --> 01:12:40,388
I Couldn't Let That Happen.

1710
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:41,890
Yes, Well, You Know How
My Mom's Always Been

1711
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,391
A Little Bit
Scatterbrained?

1712
01:12:43,391 --> 01:12:45,059
She Scattered
Way Too Much This Time.

1713
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:47,395
She And Dad Were Supposed To
Bring The Quints To The Dinner.

1714
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:50,098
Ok, Ok,
Quint Rescue Duty Better Finish Quickly.

1715
01:12:50,098 --> 01:12:51,499
I Cannot Miss
The Art Show, Jamie.

1716
01:12:51,499 --> 01:12:53,768
Ok, Checklist.
5 Babies?

1717
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:55,304
5? There's
5 Of Them?

1718
01:12:56,304 --> 01:12:57,505
Kidding. Check.

1719
01:12:57,505 --> 01:12:58,840
Ah, Ha.
Very Funny.

1720
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,241
Ok, Car Seats?

1721
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:01,176
Check.

1722
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:02,779
Great. Uh,
Cash And Directions?

1723
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:06,815
Oh, Sorry.
That Was Mine.

1724
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,816
Let's Hit The Road.

1725
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,020
All Right, Let's Go.

1726
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,688
But--But I Don't Understand.

1727
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:15,590
I Was Told All 7 Of You
Would Be Here.

1728
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,192
I Am So Sorry.

1729
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,194
Uh...

1730
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:22,330
Uh, It's Ok.
Not A Problem.

1731
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:25,533
I'm The Governor.
I Can Handle This.

1732
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:29,103
I'll Send The State Troopers
To Pick Up Those Little Ones.

1733
01:13:33,174 --> 01:13:35,810
Get Those Quints
Ready For Transit.

1734
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,050
Crisis Averted.

1735
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,855
Hey,
We Almost Made It.

1736
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:50,558
And That Means My Parents
Are Almost Off The Hook.

1737
01:13:50,558 --> 01:13:51,860
I Think You Need Oil.

1738
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,361
Hypothetically,
I Think You're Right.

1739
01:13:53,361 --> 01:13:55,797
I Guess It's Over.

1740
01:13:55,797 --> 01:13:57,298
Maybe The Tow Truck Can Take
You Back To The Art Show...

1741
01:13:57,298 --> 01:13:59,033
If It Ever Shows Up.

1742
01:13:59,033 --> 01:14:05,206
Jamie, Jamie...
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1743
01:14:05,206 --> 01:14:08,843
Never Give Up,
Particularly If There's Something You Believe In.

1744
01:14:08,843 --> 01:14:11,045
Come On,
Do You Believe In Your Family?

1745
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:12,180
In The Quints?

1746
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,715
Yourself?

1747
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,049
Yeah.

1748
01:14:15,049 --> 01:14:17,723
Well, Then Make
A Plan, Man.

1749
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:22,724
Good Luck.

1750
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,192
Bye.

1751
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:27,363
Careful, Guys,
Good Luck. Bye.

Are You Sure
This Was A Good Idea?

1755
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:38,840
It's Only 2 Stops
To The State House.

1756
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,542
We Do This Every Year
On Our School Trips, Zoe.

1757
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:41,709
Grow Up.

1758
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:43,378

Let's Do It Quick.

My Arms
Are Falling Off.

1760
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,884
Not Home? Not Home?
But Me And Those Quints

1761
01:14:49,884 --> 01:14:52,086
Were Gonna Be On
The Front Page Together.

1762
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:53,555
Now, This Is The Same
Thing That Happened

1763
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:57,392
When I Agreed To That Photo-Op
With The Backstreet Guys.

1764
01:14:57,392 --> 01:15:00,728
It's Ok.
I Can Handle This.

1765
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:01,029
Oh, Good News, I Hope.

1766
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:03,032
I Spoke To Our Neighbor,
Who Talked To Her Cousin,

1767
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,935
Who Talked To A Coworker,
Who Said They're On Their Way.

1768
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,737
On Their Way?
On Their Way?

1769
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:13,073
They Should Have Been Here Hours Ago With You!

1770
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:15,209
I'm So Sorry.

1771
01:15:15,209 --> 01:15:18,947
I Just Get So Excited...
Meeting The Quints.

1772
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:23,452
That's No Way To Speak To My Parents Of The Year,
Is It?

1773
01:15:24,452 --> 01:15:26,220
Oh, It's No Use.

1774
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:29,056
This Has Fiasco
Written All Over It.

1775
01:15:29,056 --> 01:15:32,728

This Is Turning Into
Some Adventure.

1782
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:53,118
I'll Say.

1783
01:15:57,118 --> 01:15:59,120
How Could We Not Have Known
To Bring The Quints?

1784
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,288
I'm Gonna Tell You.

1785
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:01,356
Planning Is Just Too Hard With This Many Kids.

1786
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:02,690
I Give Up.

1787
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,025
Ladies And Gentlemen,
Governor Thomas Healy.

1788
01:16:05,025 --> 01:16:08,435
There's No More Big Plan.
I Quit. No More.

1789
01:16:14,435 --> 01:16:16,040
Mr. Governor,
Sir!

1790
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,842
We Just Want
To Apologize.

1791
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:24,045
Months Of Planning,
No Babies.

1792
01:16:24,045 --> 01:16:25,948
The Perfect Moment
Gone.

1793
01:16:26,948 --> 01:16:28,983
I Just Wanted A Few
Pictures Taken.

1794
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:32,887
We Are So Sorry,
Mr. Governor... Sir.

1795
01:16:32,887 --> 01:16:35,690
Out Of The Way.
Out Of The Way!

1796
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:38,893
Out Of The Way!
Aw, Hands Off! Stand Back!

1797
01:16:38,893 --> 01:16:42,864
Little Guy,
The Grovers Are Here!

1798
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:44,198
Adam...

1799
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:46,801
And A Big Biker Guy.
Heh.

1800
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:47,969
Hi, Guys.

1801
01:16:47,969 --> 01:16:50,037
Hey, Honey.

1802
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:51,706
Here's Your Quints.
They're Pretty Adorable, You Know.

1803
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:53,708
Yeah, We Know.

1804
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:55,309
Nice To Meet You,
Little Man.

1805
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:57,311
I Told You This Would
Work Out Fine.

1806
01:16:57,311 --> 01:16:59,580
You Panic Far Too Easily.

1807
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:03,484
Hey, Hey... Hey,
Where Have You Been?

1808
01:17:03,484 --> 01:17:04,619
Hey, Uh--

1809
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:07,221
Wait, Um...
You. Here You Go.

1810
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:08,890
That's All Right. He's A Good Guy.
He's A Good Guy.

1811
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,191
He's Dressed
Like A Monkey.

1812
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:11,726
Here We Go.
Come On. Come On.

1813
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:13,495
Take Him.

1814
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:16,064
Aw, Thank You. Ok.
Here You Go.

1815
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:18,232
Thanks, Guys.

1816
01:17:18,232 --> 01:17:19,701
Couldn't Have
Done It Without You.

1817
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,703
Not A Problem.

1818
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,871
Uh, Honey, You Gonna
Join Us For Dinner?

1819
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:26,207
No, Thanks.
I'm Not Really Dressed.

1820
01:17:26,207 --> 01:17:28,743
I'll Have My Driver Take You Back Home,
If You Like.

1821
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:30,378
He Can Take You
Anywhere, Actually.

1822
01:17:30,378 --> 01:17:31,412
Anywhere?

1823
01:17:31,412 --> 01:17:32,049
Sure, Anywhere.

1824
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:38,219
Come On, Guys. Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad. Have Fun. Bye.

1825
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:39,854
Yeah, Ho, Hey, Young Lady,
Where You Goin'?

1826
01:17:39,854 --> 01:17:42,090
Hello? Ohh.

1827
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,258
I Just Don't
Understand That Kid.

1828
01:17:44,258 --> 01:17:47,029
Teenagers Are Just
Plain Weird.

1829
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:50,531
That Was Off The Record,
Of Course.

1830
01:17:50,531 --> 01:17:52,033
With The Crisis Solved,

1831
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:55,036
I Let The Governor's Driver
Take Us Out For Ice Cream.

1832
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:57,205
I Mean, Where Else
Would I Go?

1833
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:59,707
Nowhere, Right?

1834
01:17:59,707 --> 01:18:01,642
Ok... You Caught Me.

1835
01:18:01,642 --> 01:18:03,043
The Truth Is,

1836
01:18:03,043 --> 01:18:05,046
I Had The Driver
Race Us To The Art Show.

1837
01:18:05,046 --> 01:18:07,952
I Got There Just In Time.

1838
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:14,388
How In The World...

1839
01:18:14,388 --> 01:18:17,325
Bus, Subway, Bikers,
And A Limo. You?

1840
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:20,230
Tow Truck
And Walking Shoes.

1841
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:25,065
Actually, The Artist
Is Here Now.

1842
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:27,235
This Is
Jamie Grover.

1843
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:30,271
These Are Sketches Of Her Brothers And Sisters.

1844
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:34,676
And Then It Was Time
For The Big Moment.

1845
01:18:35,676 --> 01:18:38,179
And Now, It's Time
For The Big Moment.

1846
01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:40,848
He Needs A New Writer,
Don't You Think?

1847
01:18:40,848 --> 01:18:43,985
Ahem. Each Year,
One Student

1848
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,988
Is Recognized For His
Or Her Body Of Work

1849
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,990
Entered In The School
Art Show.

1850
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,792
This Is A Student

1851
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:53,427
That The Judges Feel
Has A Special Gift.

1852
01:18:53,427 --> 01:18:56,764
As Always, This Is A Very
Difficult Decision To Make,

1853
01:18:56,764 --> 01:19:00,268
As Many Of You Out There
Have Extraordinary Talent.

1854
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:03,838
But Still,
We Do Make A Decision.

1855
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:07,842
And This Year,
The Blue Ribbon Goes To...

1856
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:10,346
Jamie Grover!

1857
01:19:12,346 --> 01:19:15,316
Guess What.
I'm Not Fooling You.

1858
01:19:15,316 --> 01:19:17,351
This Is What
Really Happened!

1859
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:18,820
It Was Pretty Awesome.

1860
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,023
Congratulations,
Jamie!

1861
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,024
I Knew
You Could Do It.

1862
01:19:24,024 --> 01:19:25,693
I'm Very Proud
Of You.

1863
01:19:25,693 --> 01:19:28,833

But Guess What Did.

1871
01:19:54,155 --> 01:19:56,360
Hey, Hey!
That's My Girl!

1872
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,032
Oh, Honey!

1873
01:20:05,032 --> 01:20:06,934
What Are You Guys
Doing Here?

1874
01:20:06,934 --> 01:20:09,036
Well, About A Moment
After You Left,

1875
01:20:09,036 --> 01:20:11,839
We Suddenly Realized Exactly Where You Were Going.

1876
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:13,007
You Remembered?

1877
01:20:14,007 --> 01:20:16,011
Yes, We Remembered,
And We Felt Like Terrible People

1878
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:19,714
That We Forgot Even For That One Little Moment.

1879
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:22,750
So I Said To The Governor,
If We're Parents Of The Year,

1880
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:25,286
There's Only One Place
We Can Be.

1881
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:27,889
Our Children Come First.

1882
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:31,058
And I Said, "Well, I May Not Know Much About Art,
But I Know What I Like.

1883
01:20:31,058 --> 01:20:33,094
Let's Go!"
So Here We Are.

1884
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:36,063
Wait, What About The Dinner And The Award?

1885
01:20:36,063 --> 01:20:37,032
This Is Better.

1886
01:20:38,032 --> 01:20:39,811
Much Better.

1887
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:53,046
You Want To Hear
Something Funny?

1888
01:20:53,046 --> 01:20:54,882
I Ended Up Getting
A Few Good Grades,

1889
01:20:54,882 --> 01:20:57,652
And Mr. Blackmer Wrote Me
A Great Recommendation Letter,

1890
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:01,889
And Poof--I Was Eligible For George
Washington Science Magnet School.

1891
01:21:01,889 --> 01:21:03,758
But I Said No, Thanks.

1892
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,726
Mom And Dad Said
It Didn't Matter Anymore.

1893
01:21:05,726 --> 01:21:09,800
After All, Life Is
Always What You Make It.

1894
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,903
So... I Moved On
To The Ninth Grade.

1895
01:21:15,903 --> 01:21:18,072
My Grades Stayed
About The Same,

1896
01:21:18,072 --> 01:21:20,341
But My Art Got Better
And Better,

1897
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:23,011
Thanks To My Hard Work
And Mr. Blackmer's Teaching.

1898
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:26,447
Best Of All, I Was Happy.

1899
01:21:26,447 --> 01:21:29,650
Well, As Happy
As 14-Year-Old Girls Ever Get,

1900
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:31,852
But That's A Different Story.

1901
01:21:31,852 --> 01:21:35,990
Dad Got A Promotion,
But He's Still Trying To Make Himself Better,

1902
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,525
Still Hitting Those Books.

1903
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:39,860
Mom Continued To Manage
The Quints' Career,

1904
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,095
But She Scaled Their Work
Way Back.

1905
01:21:42,095 --> 01:21:44,865
It's Going Well Enough
That We Can All Eat

1906
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:47,201
But Not So Good
That Dad's Quitting His Job.

1907
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:49,537
Oh!
And There Was One Other Bit Of News.

1908
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:58,546
The Doctors Say
It's Septuplets!

1909
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,350
That's 7!

1910
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,552
Oh, Come On Now, People.

1911
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,789
Haven't I Taught You
Anything?
