1
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:45,262
The forest in spring.

2
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:49,701
A time of renewal...

3
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:53,146
... of rebirth...

4
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:57,345
... of unbridled optimism...

5
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:02,110
... when new beginnings begin...

6
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:04,075
...and where the mighty mule deer...

7
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:07,072
...prepares for his upcoming
mating ritual.

8
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,192
One lucky doe will get to spend her life
with this fine specimen of a buck.

9
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,245
His magnificent antlers,
a testament to his great prowess...

10
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:20,322
...his strength, his masculinity,
his awesomeness!

11
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,403
His super- incredible coolness!

12
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:25,642
His amazing kick-butt-ocity!

13
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:28,374
- Ladies and gentlemen, here l...
- All right, Elliot.

14
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:30,412
Enough about your new rack
already, man.

15
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:32,932
Aye. Give it a rest,
you freak of nature.

16
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:36,296
- We grow tiresome of this talk of rack.
- It's true. We do.

17
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:37,813
- He's right, you know.
- Boring.

18
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,542
Like I never talk
about anything else.

19
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:43,171
Have you seen my new horns?
They're completely natural.

20
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:45,495
All me. Yes!

21
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:48,421
That tree is huge.

22
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:50,904
Like my antlers! Yeah!

23
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,742
Yes!

24
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,431
Oh, my rack is huge.

25
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:58,073
Yes!

26
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,909
Well, this time,
I have something big to say.

27
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:05,469
You know, not as big as my antlers.
I got you again, yes!

28
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,232
- Nailed it!
- Oh, come on.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,962
- We got a ceremony to get to.
- Okay, okay, okay.

30
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,079
I'd just like to thank you...

31
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:14,759
...Boog, Mr. Weenie, Buddy,
Serge, Deni and McSquizzy...

32
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:18,476
...my closest, dearest friends,
for being here for me...

33
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:22,609
...on the most important day
of my life.

34
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,329
Yeah. You're welcome. Now, let's...

35
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:26,882
Unfortunately, the bachelor buck
stops here.

36
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,364
But I begin a new chapter
with Giselle...

37
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:33,052
...my doe, my deer, my female deer.

38
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:36,052
- That's a really nice thought...
- As my single life ends...

39
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:39,532
...finishes, expires, perishes...

40
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:44,255
...goes down in a blazing ball
of flames with no survivors...!

41
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:46,257
Elliot, relax.

42
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:49,226
- Now, let's get a move on, man.
- Yeah, we go to the wedding.

43
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:50,788
Wedding?

44
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,430
- Nuptials.
- Okay, just one minute.

45
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,267
- Let's get this over with.
- Hold on. Be right there.

46
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:59,664
Just polished these boys,
don't wanna scratch them.

47
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:01,907
Hurry, Elliot! Come on.

48
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:06,031
I'm falling.

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,433
- Careful!
- Oh, snap.

50
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:10,559
- Too late.
- Oh, that was smooth.

51
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,839
Elliot, don't look.

52
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:15,560
- Oh, he looked.
- He's going to blow.

53
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:17,155
Everybody, duck!

54
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,123
- Was that Elliot?
- I'm telling you...

55
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:30,413
...when you're in love, you hear
your man's voice everywhere.

56
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:33,490
- You know it, girl.
- You got that right.

57
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,096
Oh, Maria.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

58
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,935
- Thank you, Rosie.
- Our sweet Giselle's getting hitched.

59
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:44,780
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- Oh, it's okay.

60
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:49,221
- Elliot?
- Well, hello there, ladies.

61
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:51,505
- Oh, hi, lan.
- Hello, lan.

62
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,026
Just want to inform you
that the ceremony begins...

63
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,830
...at 0800 hours.
- Good to know.

64
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:58,634
If it all goes according to plan...
And it will.

65
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:01,310
- We'll finish up at 0900 hours...

66
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,436
...with a berry and dewdrop
reception brunch to follow.

67
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,555
- Great. Thanks, lan.
- Not a problem.

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,677
Oh, and, Giselle,
there's still some time...

69
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:11,994
...if you'd rather be served some
beefcake instead of the pansy-loaf...

70
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,722
...if you know what I mean.

71
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:15,159
And I think you do.

72
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:18,637
I don't generally
go for venison, but...

73
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,845
...girl, that dish is fine.

74
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,728
- Don't you know it.
- Don't you know it.

75
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:23,880
No, thank you.

76
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:26,567
Elliot is all the man I'll ever need.

77
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:32,816
My rack. My beautiful rack.

78
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:36,016
Stop boo-hooing, you wee jessie.

79
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,570
- They'll grow back.
- Yeah, they're gonna grow back.

80
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:40,654
Just like the last time
you broke them, man.

81
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,098
And the time before that.

82
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:44,381
- And the time before that.
- What if it's a sign?

83
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:46,059
- A sign not to get...
- Get what?

84
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:47,865
- Married.

85
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:50,384
See this here? Now, this is sad.

86
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,666
- Poor Elliot.
- We need a diversion.

87
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,905
Hey, I know just the diversion...

88
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:58,430
...to take his mind off his antler.
We break his hoof with a large stone.

89
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:00,746
- Yeah, a large stone!
- A boulder.

90
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,306
I can't believe it. I mean, I can't...

91
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:08,152
I know what you're do...
Seriously, quit it...

92
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,756
- I can totally see what you're doing.
- Come on, Elliot.

93
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:14,679
If there's one thing
I am not in the mood for...

94
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:19,444
...it is a rabbit fight!
- Rabbit fight!

95
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,406
Gregalach!

96
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,248
You're going down, fat bear!

97
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,005
Stay!

98
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,287
Sit.

99
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:31,055
Now, count to 10.

100
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:35,934
What are you doing?
He's getting away.

101
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:39,458
Boog gave me a command
to count to 10, so l...

102
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:42,740
I can't believe I fell for that.

103
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:44,544
I must never be weak again.

104
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:47,585
You don't know what it was like
living with the humans.

105
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,264
If they say "sit," you sit.
If they say "fetch," you fetch.

106
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,820
You must stay alert,
or they will steal our freedom...

107
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:57,430
...and lock us up forever und ever.
- Forever und ever?

108
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:00,545
But you broke free.
How did you do it?

109
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:03,630
- What's the secret?
- Never forget who you are in here.

110
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:04,834
A vulnerable child...

111
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,718
...who just wants to be loved?
- No!

112
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,350
A wild animal who relies
on no one but himself.

113
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:12,321
- Now, say it with me. I'm wild!
- I'm wild.

114
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:16,446
- With conviction. I'm wild!
- I'm wild!

115
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,010
Now, let's go find the fat bear.

116
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,532
I can't believe it, Bob.

117
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:29,653
It's been a whole year
since we saw Mr. Weenie.

118
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:32,935
I know he's still out there.
I can feel it.

119
00:06:33,097 --> 00:06:34,531
Can you feel it, Bob?

120
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,693
- Well, l...
- Mr. Weenie! Mr. Weenie!

121
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:40,330
Do you think he'll find
our biscuit trail, Bob?

122
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,335
Do you think he'll
come back to us, Bob?

123
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:45,065
Do you think Mr. Weenie's
safe out there, Bob?

124
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:48,822
Boog will never find me.

125
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,304
Now, where is that Weenie?

126
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:56,270
Guten tag, fat bear!

127
00:06:57,674 --> 00:06:59,712
I am victorious!

128
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,152
Show-off. I'm gonna
have to check the rule book.

129
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:05,277
Mortal combat!

130
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:14,962
He got me! Great shot, Elliot.
You won, man.

131
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:16,241
Nobody ever expects...

132
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:18,843
...the falling-down-the- tree- in-pain
manoeuvre.

133
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,921
- Very clever, mule deer.
- He cracks me up.

134
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,525
- He surprised you good on that one.
- Oh, is that right?

135
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,843
- It's true.
- Game over.

136
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,164
All right, now, let's get cleaned up.

137
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:30,725
- Time for Elliot to tie the knot.
- Already? No!

138
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:32,728
This was the best stag party ever...

139
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:35,413
...which has to keep going.
Please, rabbits to throw.

140
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:37,013
Oh, grow up, you big baby.

141
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,410
- Let's get moving.
- Boog...

142
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:40,618
...do you think I'm doing
the right thing here?

143
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:41,853
Marrying Giselle?

144
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:46,225
What I'm wondering is,
is Giselle doing the right thing?

145
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:48,260
I'm just kidding you.

146
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:49,578
Now, will you relax?

147
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,064
We're gathered today
for a very serious occasion.

148
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,705
Elliot? What happened?

149
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:01,274
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing.

150
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:03,030
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

151
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:05,713
I couldn't be better.
Just had a little trim off the top.

152
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,156
Giselle and Elliot...

153
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,396
...have courted and made the decision
to join together forever...

154
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:13,554
...and ever.

155
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:18,883
Is he okay?

156
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:20,722
Forever and ever?

157
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,643
Still time to change your mind.

158
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,962
- What?
- Wait, I knew about forever.

159
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:27,010
Guys, but what's this
about "and ever"?

160
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,688
- Be cool.
- Nobody said anything...

161
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,574
...about an additional "and ever."

162
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,609
No! The food of oppression.

163
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,340
I must be strong.

164
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:44,665
Oh, maybe just a taste.

165
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:51,265
I'd like to ask the buck
to step forward...

166
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,903
...for a ceremonial displaying
of the antlers...

167
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:56,791
Antler.

168
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,389
- To show his commitment
to his doe.

169
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,866
- Seriously. Still time.
- Not gonna happen.

170
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:08,755
Oh, so good.

171
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:11,357
I'm weak! How could I?

172
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:15,279
- Do you, Giselle, take Smelliot...
- lan.

173
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:17,005
- To be your lifelong mate?

174
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,240
I do.

175
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:27,046
And do you, Elliot...

176
00:09:27,214 --> 00:09:30,413
...take Giselle to be
your lifelong mate?

177
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:33,533
That's you. Your line.

178
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:34,894
You go now.

179
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:36,972
Elliot. Go on, man.

180
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,973
- That's your cue. Go, go.
- Don't be shy.

181
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,541
Come on. Say it, you ninny.

182
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,822
Elliot, are you okay?

183
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:46,942
Come on, step it up.
I got a buck mitzvah at 3.

184
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,622
- Weenie! Weenie!
- Weenie?

185
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,351
- What, are you speaking French?
- Weenie! Oh, no!

186
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:56,074
Elliot? Where are you going?

187
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,826
Weenie, come back!

188
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:01,188
- Stop. Weenie!
- I must be strong.

189
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:04,237
- Weenie! Weenie!
- So good.

190
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,789
Weenie, over here! Weenie!
Here, boy!

191
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,594
Weenie!

192
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,277
Oh, no. Full moon.

193
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,800
Is that you? Mr. Weenie!

194
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:18,278
It's you! It's you!
I can't believe it's you!

195
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,402
It's a miracle.

196
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,282
He's been captured!

197
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,045
- What am I gonna do?
- Bob, it worked!

198
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:26,806
Oh, no, this is terrible.

199
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,327
Everything is okay.

200
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,487
Mommy is here.

201
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:34,290
He's being tortured!

202
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,449
No!

203
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,373
- No!
- No!

204
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,735
No!

205
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:40,052
No!

206
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:45,217
- What are you doing?
- What's this all about?

207
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:47,856
- You better have a good explanation.
- Yes! Yes, I do.

208
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:51,466
- Oh, I can't wait to hear this excuse.
- It was horrible.

209
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,863
Weenie was minding his own
business when she appeared.

210
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:57,469
He screamed,
but she ignored his cry.

211
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:00,434
And then she grabbed him
with her claws.

212
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:01,825
Oh, my goodness.

213
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:05,071
Then she tried to squeeze
the life out of him.

214
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,913
- That's horrible.
- Sad story.

215
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,232
But he fought back.

216
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,041
Oh, she tortured him.

217
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,353
Slapped him.

218
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,603
Poked his eyes out, like this.

219
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:18,326
It was horrible!

220
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:20,559
It was the worst thing I've ever seen!

221
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,006
Oh, the humanity!

222
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:26,052
Elliot, are you maybe putting
a little bit too much on that?

223
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:28,092
Listen, Boog, I'm telling the story.

224
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,773
And finally, the hairless blob
dragged him off...

225
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,851
...into her chariot of horror!

226
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,212
Wait, wait, wait.
So, what you're saying is...

227
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:40,614
- Mr. Weenie's been kidnapped!
- No.

228
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,058
- For real?
- Yes, it's true.

229
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,376
- Tough break. I miss him already.
- What now?

230
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:46,663
Well, we could finish the ceremony.
Come on.

231
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,466
I worked hard on those centrepieces.

232
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,939
As much as Elliot and I
wanna finish the ceremony...

233
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,751
...we need to go after Mr. Weenie.
- Giselle's right!

234
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:57,111
And until he's back in the safety
of our friends and family...

235
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,916
...in the warm caress
of our bosoms...

236
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:03,594
...there will be,
there can be, no celebration.

237
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:06,638
So, what can we do? Probably
halfway to the valley's end by now.

238
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,029
So? We can't give up.

239
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,876
We didn't give up on the hunters
when they raided the forest.

240
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:12,796
We can't give up on our friend
Weenie.

241
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,877
The Boogster's right.
Who's with me?

242
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:16,480
Oh, yeah. Count me in.

243
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:20,120
- Me too.
- Okay. Good. Who else is in?

244
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,203
I'm beeling at them bajins.
So let's quit bumping the gums...

245
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,568
...and give them a right chibbing!

246
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:31,175
I'm not sure what Squiz just said,
but I'll take that as a yes.

247
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:33,455
- Yes! It's a yes!
- I'm in too.

248
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,690
- Me too.
- I'm with you, buddy.

249
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,499
Sorry, I got the wife and kids.

250
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,858
You turn your back on the pelts
for one second...

251
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:43,142
...all heck breaks loose. I'm out.
- Oh, leave it to the beaver.

252
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,060
In your dreams.
I just had my nails done, girl.

253
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:49,619
Sounds fun, but I gotta stay
back and protect the herd.

254
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:53,546
You're all a bunch of meek- minded,
yellow-bellied, pansy-a...

255
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:57,105
As McSquizzy is trying to say...

256
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,665
...a smaller group
is probably better anyway.

257
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:01,749
- We can move faster.
- Let's get a move on.

258
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:03,716
Move out, boys.

259
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,600
- Elliot?
- Yeah?

260
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,912
You're going the wrong way,
you big daftie!

261
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:11,552
I know that. Fall in.

262
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:21,489
Oh, Mr. Weenie, we've been
looking for you for so long.

263
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:26,569
It must've been horrible
out there all alone in the wild.

264
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:28,846
Oh, no one's gonna believe it!

265
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,452
Should I call the caravan, Bob?

266
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,337
Breaker, breaker, Fox Jaws.

267
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:37,016
- This is Mudflaps and Wild Man.
- Copy that. Over.

268
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:38,297
You'll never guess.

269
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:40,739
We found Mr. Weenie! It's true!

270
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,500
Say hello, Mr. Weenie.

271
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,262
- Did you hear that?
- Congrats, Mudflaps. Good to hear!

272
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:52,223
What's that, Bob? Oh, Wild Man says
we need to make a pit stop for a fill-up.

273
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:54,270
We'll see you
over at the campground.

274
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,426
- Over.
- Break er, break er, happy travellers.

275
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,712
Put your ears on,
I've got great news!

276
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:04,395
Mudflaps and Wild Man found
their long-lost weenie dog! Over.

277
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,563
Oh, man, is this good.

278
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,797
Hey, Fifi, you want some?

279
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,847
You know, Roberto,
those doggy treats...

280
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:20,205
...are filled with carbohydrates.

281
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:23,690
And if I could pronounce that word,
that would mean what?

282
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:27,131
It would mean you should
stick to the lean proteins...

283
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:28,854
...the meats, the poultries.

284
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,452
How are you gonna look
sitting by the pool?

285
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:35,249
- I don't know. Hot and really happy.
- That was rhetorical, moron.

286
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,301
Put down the treats.
You've eaten enough.

287
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:46,826
I'm going to pretend
I didn't see that.

288
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:55,026
- Hey, Fifi?
- Yes?

289
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:57,106
How long do you think it'll be
till we stop?

290
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,188
Because I gotta poop.

291
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,274
Seriously, I gotta poop really bad.

292
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:11,117
I said it was going to be a long ride,
but you never listen.

293
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:15,326
Just like you didn't listen when
I told you not to eat the entire burrito.

294
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:19,961
Now, you know what this
means I have to do.

295
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:21,805
Gosh, darn.

296
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,441
Every time we leave the house,
you put me through this...

297
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:26,684
Fifi! Fifi, stop!

298
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:29,416
- Do you hear me?
- Come on. Help a brother out.

299
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:32,776
What on earth has gotten
into that dog?

300
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,899
You know I hate doing this.

301
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,179
Yeah, but you do it so well.
Can you hurry it along?

302
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:42,381
Oh, there you are baby, Fifi.

303
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:45,458
One pit stop, coming up.

304
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,461
Oh, gross.

305
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,191
No, Fifi. No.

306
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:55,067
Break er, break er. This is Fox Jaws.

307
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,908
One of my little yappers just
served up a can of gut soup...

308
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:02,356
... and we are talking chunky.
Let's pull off. Over.

309
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:05,234
Come on, you dumb cat.
Get off the road.

310
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,155
You two run along
while I get cleaned up.

311
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:11,316
Out of my way. Out of my way.
I don't wanna be rude, but I gotta go.

312
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:14,603
- Stanley, old buddy.
- Oh, here we go.

313
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,077
Stanley, it's been ages.

314
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:20,322
Actually, it's been exactly
one year, Roger.

315
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,529
Really? It seems like
such a long time.

316
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,127
Oh, I have to explain this again?

317
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:29,653
Okay, listen, we go to Pet Paradiso
every year at the same time.

318
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:33,812
And, painfully,
we have this same conversation.

319
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:36,814
- We do?
- Yes. Yes, we do.

320
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,451
Is this ringing a bell?

321
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:42,579
Stanley, it's been ages.

322
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:44,817
It's gonna be a long week.

323
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:49,381
Oh, Rufus. There you are.
How's my shining star?

324
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,189
Why, Charlene, look at you.

325
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:55,062
Don't you look prettier than a glob
of butter on a stack of wheat cakes.

326
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:57,385
Oh, goodness me.

327
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:02,109
- Thank you, Rufus. Oh, may I?
- Well, I'd be much obliged.

328
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,911
Hey, Fifi.
Did you hear they found Mr. Weenie?

329
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,719
- Isn't that great?
- Really?

330
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:10,035
- Are you sure?
- I heard he lived with wild animals.

331
00:17:10,524 --> 00:17:12,116
No. That's horrible.

332
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:14,676
- He's lucky they didn't hurt him.
- Or kill him.

333
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:16,679
Or worse.

334
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:19,967
I was once in the vicious clutches
of wild animals.

335
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,530
- You were?
- I was.

336
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:23,330
What was it like?

337
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:27,887
It's too painful for me to talk about.

338
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:29,576
Gather round.

339
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:31,575
Okay, Fifi.
You want the squeaky toy?

340
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,252
There I was.

341
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,739
- All alone.
- You want it?

342
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,494
Alone in that steaming jungle.

343
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:40,657
That unforgivable heart of darkness,
where you can't see your own paws.

344
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:45,217
And the only sound is the frantic,
but adorable...

345
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:47,584
... pitter-patter of your own heart.

346
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:49,706
When suddenly...

347
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:56,388
They were everywhere.

348
00:17:58,676 --> 00:17:59,995
There was no escape.

349
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:04,073
My life flashed before my eyes,
and then the unspeakable.

350
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:07,434
- What happened? Did you live?
- What happened?

351
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:11,918
I'll show you what happened.

352
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:15,318
Let this be a lesson to you all.

353
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:18,448
- How ghastly.
- It's so pink.

354
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,647
- That is one sad tail.
- I want a girlfriend.

355
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,371
Don't interrupt now. Please?

356
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:27,087
I lost two things on that day:
My innocence...

357
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:29,494
...and my squeaky toy.

358
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:33,254
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

359
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:38,136
Speak of the devil.

360
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:41,175
- Disgusting.
- Oh, no.

361
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:43,177
Not the fuzzy little bunny.

362
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,942
Don't you understand?
We must remain vigilant.

363
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,986
Even one wild animal among us...

364
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,307
...can send us back to those dark days
of anarchy.

365
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:55,387
Come on, but he's so cute.

366
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:56,784
Pay attention.

367
00:18:56,955 --> 00:19:00,074
Even one little fuzzy bunny
can infest us all.

368
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:04,233
Like the fleas on Roberto's back,
they must all be eradicated.

369
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,075
I'm gonna tear you apart.

370
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:14,006
Fifi! Heel!

371
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,647
One day, you vile little beast.

372
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,442
One day, I will personally
teach you a lesson...

373
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:25,367
...you will never forget!

374
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:28,093
I'm coming, Mother.

375
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,252
Hey, does anybody
know where we are?

376
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,499
Didn't think so.

377
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,493
- Isn't this great, Boog?
- What's great?

378
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:38,939
You know, not great that Weenie's
been kidnapped...

379
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:41,494
...but great that we're living life
on the edge.

380
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:43,066
It's just like old times.

381
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:45,537
- Two guys, out on the road.
- Hey, guys.

382
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,859
- Room for one more?
- For sure.

383
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,027
So, Elliot...

384
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:52,582
...now that we have
a moment alone...

385
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,313
Hey, what's that?

386
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:00,073
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened...

387
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:01,637
...at the ceremony this morning.

388
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,077
- What do you mean?
- Well, while I was saying, "I do"...

389
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:08,522
...you were looking like you didn't.
- What?

390
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,242
Giselle, don't be ridiculous.

391
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:12,715
Look, Elliot,
I know something is bothering you.

392
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:16,643
Ever since the ceremony,
you've been acting a little strange.

393
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,324
We're partners.
You can tell me anything.

394
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:22,053
All right, Giselle,
but remember, you asked.

395
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:25,411
Basically, I'm worried about
"forever and ever."

396
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:26,770
"Forever and ever"?

397
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:30,293
About Mr. Weenie
being lost forever and ever.

398
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,054
So this has nothing to do with me...

399
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,337
...you're only worried
about Mr. Weenie...

400
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,982
...right?
- Yes, I am.

401
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:40,933
But I'm mostly worried about
you and me, our special day...

402
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:42,778
...and getting back to the ceremony.

403
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:46,543
But finding Mr. Weenie
could take a long, long time.

404
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:49,748
Could take months, really.
I mean, years, perhaps.

405
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:52,142
- A lifetime.
- Found him.

406
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:53,507
There he is.

407
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:55,347
- He's over there.
- She found him.

408
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:57,508
- Oh, way to go, Giselle.
- Giselle.

409
00:20:57,677 --> 00:20:59,349
What luck, huh, Elliot?

410
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:01,908
We'll be back home
and married in no time.

411
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,276
Well, I mean,
that could be another RV, you know.

412
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:06,593
- There's Weenie in the window.
- He's waving at us.

413
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:08,162
- Here I am!
- Hi, Weenie.

414
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:11,203
- He's... That's a totally different dog.
- Nope. That's him.

415
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:12,515
We better keep looking.

416
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:15,043
Come back. You know we gotta
go get him out of there.

417
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,518
- Help! Help!
- No, I know that. I just...

418
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:18,679
What was the question?

419
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,968
- All right, here's the plan.
- That's all wrong.

420
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:23,363
Squizmeister, you and Buddy
will be the entry team.

421
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,968
- Roger.
- Serge, Deni.

422
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:27,286
Smash and grab.
Boog, you're with me.

423
00:21:27,457 --> 00:21:28,731
Let's limit the casualties.

424
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:30,776
- All right.
- What about me? What can I do?

425
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:35,618
Well, yeah, that's right. What...
You stay there and guard the trees.

426
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:38,820
- Really? That's the best you could do?
- No, Elliot. Wait.

427
00:21:38,984 --> 00:21:40,134
Hi there, folks.

428
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:45,302
I'd like to offer a complimentary
32- point diagnostic inspection...

429
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:46,743
...while I fill up your tank.

430
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:48,343
- Restroom, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

431
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,944
- In the back.
- Thank you.

432
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:53,150
And may I suggest you trying
our famous pecan roll?

433
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,545
I make them myself. They're inside.

434
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,035
For a buck.

435
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:59,314
Two for $2.

436
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:02,150
Off the road!

437
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:11,683
Engine knock. Yep.
I'd know it anywhere.

438
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:15,046
Come on. Let's go. Quiet.

439
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,325
It's about time you got here, Boog.
Keep up.

440
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,880
- Deni and I are ready.
- Me too.

441
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,849
Oh, thank goodness.
You've come for me.

442
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,002
No need to worry.

443
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:25,325
Okay, we need a grappling hook,
a 30-foot rope...

444
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:28,694
...winch, pulley, truck with an open
engine block and a can of sardines.

445
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:30,689
Why don't we just
open the door, genius?

446
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,499
- I'm trying to think outside the box.
- Okay, single file.

447
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:35,414
- Stay quiet.
- Don't tell me to be quiet.

448
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:37,575
Tell the ducks to be quiet.

449
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,705
Weenie, it's all clear.
Come on. Let's go.

450
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:46,337
- Yeah, coming through.
- We need a new plan.

451
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:48,865
Everybody, quiet.
I need a minute to think.

452
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:51,387
- Time's up.
- I got it.

453
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:54,631
Plush.

454
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:57,954
Face it, Earl.
These folks are living your dream.

455
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:03,673
- That was close. I think we're clear.
- That's not part of the plan, Boog.

456
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,992
- From now on...
- Hey, fatso, shove off.

457
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:07,596
You're snapping my spine here.

458
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:11,964
Oh, suspension is shot.
Definitely shot.

459
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:14,322
Or it could be the bushings.

460
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:17,602
Bob, which one should I get
for our Mr. Weenie- Baby?

461
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,402
Stripes or plaid?
You're absolutely right.

462
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:26,011
- Please don't leave me.
- Mr. E's got you covered.

463
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,012
- Stand back.
- No.

464
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:29,293
Let me take a look-see.

465
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,650
Now, that is a sturdy piece
of hardware, right, guys?

466
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,383
- I'm doomed.
- Doomed, huh? Yeah.

467
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,934
Stay with me, boys. I got it.

468
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:42,495
Now I have to top off the fluids.

469
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,941
All right, go.

470
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,670
Come on with it.

471
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:51,744
Most likely the rear differential.

472
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,834
I was right.

473
00:23:57,396 --> 00:24:00,595
Bob, should we get a pecan roll
for the ride?

474
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,038
- Elliot, you okay?
- Hey.

475
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,431
I'm getting sick and tired
of breaking your fall.

476
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:06,592
Get off me!

477
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:09,643
- Oh, yolk.
- It's okay, Elliot. I'm here.

478
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:11,797
Oh, these cheese doodles
are so good.

479
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:14,562
They really taste like cheese.

480
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:17,569
Snack time over? Come on.
We need to focus.

481
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,847
- Yeah. Focus on the Weenie.
- Come on, everybody.

482
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:22,288
- What he said.
- Quiet. New plan.

483
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:24,889
We need to lubricate the collar.

484
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:26,535
Good idea.

485
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:30,128
No, no. Something else, please.

486
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:32,291
Oh, Bob, do you think
Mr. Weenie will like it?

487
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,977
Hey, how about that pecan roll, huh?
Did I tell you?

488
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,863
Hey, could you be a sport
and grab that ladder?

489
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:40,014
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

490
00:24:40,185 --> 00:24:41,744
- There's some more.
- Stop! Enough!

491
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:45,823
I'm not gonna lie.

492
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:47,742
It was a little scary up there.

493
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:51,461
My spine! You're killing me.

494
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:54,068
- That'll be $437.
- Incoming.

495
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,794
- Or I'll trade you.
- Double- time.

496
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:58,870
- Gas for that bearskin rug.
- I'm out of room.

497
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:00,677
- I'm out of air.
- Swing wide.

498
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:01,829
- Easy.
- Follow my lead.

499
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,151
- Come on now.
- Pull.

500
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:05,437
- Use your legs.
- Pull.

501
00:25:08,444 --> 00:25:10,879
Oh, my gosh.
Did you see that, Bob?

502
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:12,961
The Weenie is free.

503
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:14,967
Let's make a break for it, boys.

504
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:17,444
Deni, follow me.

505
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,042
- Gregalach!
- Run like the wind.

506
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,681
Wait for me. I have teeny legs.

507
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:25,290
- I'm out. I'm stuck.
- I did it.

508
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,856
Take cover!

509
00:25:29,018 --> 00:25:30,577
Elliot, you fool.

510
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,301
- Shake a leg, Weenie.
- What's going on in there?

511
00:25:33,461 --> 00:25:35,976
Mr. Weenie, are you okay?

512
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,094
We did it. We're all safe, right?

513
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:40,493
Okay, roll call.

514
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,897
- Boog? McSquizzy? Deni? Serge?
- Here.

515
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:44,023
- Weenie?
- There.

516
00:25:44,188 --> 00:25:45,177
- Where?
- Bye, now.

517
00:25:45,348 --> 00:25:46,419
Oh, no.

518
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,902
Well, where's Buddy? Buddy?
Sound off, Buddy.

519
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:51,870
Here.

520
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,424
Well, you've screwed up again,
you one- horn dumpling.

521
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,028
- How did that happen?
- Oh, Elliot.

522
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,186
Imbecile.

523
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:58,346
What do we do now?

524
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:00,987
- We are missing two.
- Idiot.

525
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,201
Blaming Elliot for blowing the escape
isn't gonna help us find Mr. Weenie.

526
00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:07,558
- No, but it's fun.
- Hey, what?

527
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:09,283
- Giselle's onto something.
- She is?

528
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,676
We need to find out
where that RV is going.

529
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:16,240
I know. Serge, Deni, you guys fly off
and locate the RV from the sky.

530
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,971
In the meantime, we'll stay
on their trail by foot.

531
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:21,203
Everybody got it?

532
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,365
- Smart girl.
- Oh, yeah.

533
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:26,130
You call aerial surveillance
a good idea?

534
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:29,928
- All right, General Giselle.
- What's with you?

535
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:33,173
We're not even married yet, and
you're already telling me what to do.

536
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,810
You need a little space?
All right, yeah. No problem.

537
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:39,455
- I'm just trying to save Mr. Weenie.
- And there lies the problem.

538
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,821
There's only room for one cook
in this kitchen...

539
00:26:41,986 --> 00:26:45,777
...and that one cook is me and Boog.
We're partners.

540
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:48,704
- Oh, I get it.
- Finally.

541
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:53,505
- This was starting to get awkward.
- Awkward? You call this awkward?

542
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:56,874
What do you call running off in
the middle of our wedding ceremony?

543
00:26:57,036 --> 00:27:00,714
- I was trying to save Mr. Weenie.
- Oh, we're back to that excuse.

544
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:03,441
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now.
Simmer down, y'all.

545
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:05,001
That's it. I'm going home.

546
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:08,323
No one's going home.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

547
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:10,283
I think you should go home, Giselle.

548
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,438
- You're just slowing us down.
- Whatever.

549
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:14,485
No, she's not. You are.

550
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:16,839
Boog?

551
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:21,245
Look, man, we need Giselle.
She's a great tracker.

552
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:23,803
Yeah, and without her,
we'd never have found Weenie...

553
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:26,126
...and that giant tin-can thing.

554
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:28,729
- Beginner's luck.
- Come on, Giselle.

555
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,457
We gotta stick together out here.

556
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:33,055
We're partners, right?

557
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:39,144
Boog. You traitor.
And you, traitor-ette.

558
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,217
Enjoy your newfound partnership.

559
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:43,777
- Oh, come on, Elliot. Look...
- I don't need any of you.

560
00:27:43,948 --> 00:27:47,306
I'll find Mr. Weenie on my own.
Solo.

561
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:49,906
Hey, you're going
the wrong way, you choob.

562
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:53,146
Oh, thank you very much.
It's a shortcu...

563
00:27:58,037 --> 00:28:00,154
I'm okay, everybody.

564
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,873
- You don't care.
- Not really.

565
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,476
Was that too harsh?

566
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:15,798
- We must follow the road, eh?
- You think?

567
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:22,532
Come on.
Let's cut through the forest.

568
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:25,412
Weenie, I am coming for you,
buddy.

569
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:29,212
I am a wonderful tracker.

570
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:32,048
I think Boog can fly
faster than you, huh?

571
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,018
A million laughs.

572
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:37,583
So are we having fun yet?

573
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:41,261
Weenie is right around here,
and I am gonna...

574
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:44,268
Wiener tracks! Yes, vindication!

575
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:48,310
I've got your track, I've got your scent,
and here I come.

576
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:50,030
That's a road, not a landing strip.

577
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:51,308
Pull up.

578
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:54,069
Hurry. Watch the ribs.

579
00:28:55,476 --> 00:28:59,027
Well, it's official.
Weenie is not up here.

580
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,993
A whole herd of wieners.

581
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:07,155
Oh, but these are Weenie's tracks
right here.

582
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:08,917
He's an alpha wiener.

583
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:12,397
Wonder why my jaw hurts.
Oh, well. More tracks.

584
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:19,441
Oh, we're here.

585
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:22,890
Hey, good to see you there, Bob.
There's a spot open on the right.

586
00:29:26,777 --> 00:29:28,177
Aren't you excited, Mr. Weenie?

587
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,648
You get to see
all of your old friends again.

588
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:31,969
And don't worry, snookums.

589
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,178
Mama will make sure
that nothing bad happens...

590
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:37,256
...to her little snuggly-wuggly
ever again.

591
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:39,700
Bob, do you have
the Invisible Pet Fortress...

592
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,743
...Electric Shock Collar?

593
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,705
That's the one.

594
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:46,229
Oh, that was nice. Thank you.

595
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:53,388
What's the matter, Bob?
It's not working?

596
00:29:55,236 --> 00:29:56,875
Oh, good, it does work.

597
00:29:57,037 --> 00:30:00,873
Don't worry, Mr. Weenie,
it's more comfortable than it looks.

598
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,830
Now, remember,
stay inside the Invisible Pet Fortress.

599
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:07,073
Rufus, darling, is that Mr. Weenie?

600
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:09,554
Well, butter my behind
and call me a biscuit.

601
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,001
Let's go smell him.

602
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,636
Now you'll be safe,
my little love muffin.

603
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:15,128
Have fun with your friends.

604
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:18,887
Mommy and Bob are gonna go have
some grown-up time with the adults.

605
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:20,371
Hey, I found Weenie.

606
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:23,002
- Oh, Mr. Weenie.
- Well, hey, short and long.

607
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:24,403
- How you been?
- My friends.

608
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:27,455
- It's Mr. Weenie.
- How you doing, Mr. Weenie?

609
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,458
Deni. Look, there's Mr. Weenie.

610
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,134
Weenie.

611
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,535
We must return to base
for reinforcements, huh?

612
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:36,692
Good plan.

613
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:38,776
How you doing, Mr. Weenie?
Good to see you.

614
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:40,425
Oh, I've missed you all so much.

615
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:43,102
It's been so long
since I've had a proper greeting.

616
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:45,305
- It's Weenie, all right.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

617
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,302
- Give me a hug.
- Stop.

618
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,030
Don't crowd him.

619
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:52,512
This dog has just been through
the unthinkable.

620
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,952
- The what?
- Don't even think it.

621
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:56,709
Why? You don't have to be rude.

622
00:30:56,877 --> 00:31:00,350
Poor Weenie. Poor, poor Weenie.

623
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,398
Who knows
the horrors you've seen?

624
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,915
- What horrors?
- Don't worry.

625
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:07,281
- We will get through it together.
- Actually, it wasn't that bad.

626
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:10,518
I know. It was worse.

627
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,917
- I've been through it too.
- Really?

628
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:14,157
Oh, Fifi.

629
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:17,606
Will he ever be the old Mr. Weenie
we knew and loved?

630
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:19,683
- We can only hope.
- But I am the same.

631
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:21,412
We'll have to see
how much damage...

632
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:23,531
...those insidious wilds
have done to him.

633
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:27,451
"Insidious wilds"?
Nein, the wild animals are my friends.

634
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:29,287
Friends?

635
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:31,451
Your friends? Your friends?

636
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,578
It is worse
than I could have ever imagined.

637
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:36,895
Your friends? It's worse
than I could have ever imagined.

638
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,784
He's gone...feral.

639
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:42,466
- Feral?
- What's that mean?

640
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:44,744
Fifi, what shall we do?

641
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,468
You heard the lassie.
What do we do?

642
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,383
- Can he be helped?
- Yes.

643
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:51,147
But it won't be pretty.

644
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:54,910
Prepare...the tent.

645
00:31:55,276 --> 00:31:57,313
- The tent?
- Not the tent.

646
00:31:57,477 --> 00:31:59,868
Oh, yes.

647
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,996
The tent.

648
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:05,919
I'm so tired.

649
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:21,965
Hey, hey, hey, check it out.
They're back.

650
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:23,249
Well, it's about time.

651
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:24,689
Down below. Friends.

652
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:27,325
- Our friends.
- We're low on fuel.

653
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:28,772
Dive.

654
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:31,936
Look, man, here they come.

655
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:34,932
- Serge, are you okay?
- Did you find Mr. Weenie?

656
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:36,616
- Relax. Deep breaths.
- Where is he?

657
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:38,537
Come on, breathe for me.
In and out.

658
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:40,298
What did you find?

659
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:45,025
- Where's Weenie?
- What she says. Where's Weenie?

660
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:47,500
- Where is he?
- What is he doing?

661
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:49,823
How many syllables? Sounds like...

662
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,792
I think I got it. He's in a tree.

663
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,866
- He's in a tree house. A birdhouse.
- Woods.

664
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:55,834
- His eggs are hatching.
- He has bird flu.

665
00:32:55,997 --> 00:32:57,636
- He's underwater.
- In a lagoon.

666
00:32:57,798 --> 00:32:59,835
- He works in a shrimp boat.
- He's in the ocean.

667
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:01,752
- In a sub.
- He's wearing a wet suit.

668
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,401
- This is it. At a zoo.
- In a cage.

669
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:06,874
- He's joined a travelling circus.
- He was eaten by a lion in a cage.

670
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:09,606
He's a clown. No, no, no.
It's a freak show.

671
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:12,760
Hello? We found Mr. Weenie.

672
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,360
Like Deni was saying...

673
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,808
...Mr. Weenie is over the trees,
past the lake and the mountain...

674
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:21,090
...at the campsite with some dogs.
And two cats.

675
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,174
All right. Let's go.

676
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,215
- Let's do this. Tell me something...
- No, stop!

677
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:30,252
Oh, I'm peched.

678
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:36,856
Past the mountains, huh?
Here's an idea.

679
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,221
What do you say
we all rest for the night, huh?

680
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:40,979
Brilliant.

681
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:43,139
Come on, Weenie. Just do it.

682
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:45,107
You know you want to.
It's inside you.

683
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:46,589
Just do it, boy.

684
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,391
- Do it for pets everywhere, Weenie.
- Never!

685
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:51,988
- Just do it.
- Better do what the basset says.

686
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:55,307
Hurry up, before Fifi gets here.
Too late.

687
00:33:56,197 --> 00:33:58,952
Is it done yet? Did he do it?
Is it over? Is it done?

688
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,031
Did we do this? Is it over?
Are we finished?

689
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,591
- Roberto.
- Fifi, it was great.

690
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:05,755
You missed it. Too bad. Let's go.

691
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:09,114
- The real answer, Rufus?
- We tried everything.

692
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:11,083
Boy's locked up like a rusty gate.

693
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:16,929
Oh, Weenie,
you can make this stop at any time.

694
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:19,925
All you have to do is...

695
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,527
...roll over.

696
00:34:21,694 --> 00:34:22,684
Roll over.

697
00:34:23,415 --> 00:34:25,806
- He keeps saying that.
- All right, then.

698
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:29,015
We're going to have to
turn this up a notch.

699
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,617
- I don't really see the point.
- Rufus, get the instruments.

700
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:37,578
Here you are.

701
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:39,699
Oh, no.

702
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:43,026
Roberto, hand me the stick.

703
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,827
Oh, boy.

704
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:50,785
Listen carefully. Do as I say.

705
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:52,149
Please, no.

706
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:54,229
Fetch.

707
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:56,547
- Go on, Weenie, fetch.
- Come on, Weenie.

708
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:59,438
- Come on, Weenie. Now, come on.
- Get the stick. Go on, go on.

709
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,675
Come on, Weenie.

710
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,560
- You're almost there. You can do it.
- Go, Weenie, fetch.

711
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:05,281
I'm a wild. I'm a wild animal.

712
00:35:05,443 --> 00:35:09,040
- And again with the nein.
- You are trying my patience.

713
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:12,803
You are no longer a wild animal.

714
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:15,438
You are a domestic pet...

715
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,641
...and domestic pets
must obey their master.

716
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:24,411
Now, hand me the squeaky toy.

717
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:25,692
- No.
- Yes!

718
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,292
- Okay, I hear you. Calm down. Relax.
- Yes, yes.

719
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,528
Squeak, squeak.

720
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,855
- It's a wild!
- He's so blue.

721
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:34,015
Not the Sunday edition.

722
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:36,018
Quick, Buddy, hop on.

723
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:39,375
- He's getting away.
- Please, Fifi, no running.

724
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:43,697
Buddy, get the electric collar off.
I'll stall them. Hurry!

725
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:47,664
- Help us out, Charlene!
- Oh, I can't. I got my rollers in.

726
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:50,666
- Weenie, you're so fast.
- Careful, Roger. You could...

727
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,587
- Too late.
- Go, Weenie, go!

728
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:55,793
Want another Shirley Temple there,
wild man?

729
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:58,427
Oh, my, what's that?
Is that Mr. Weenie?

730
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:02,834
Spread out.

731
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,111
I'm gonna take five.

732
00:36:04,283 --> 00:36:05,876
Cut them off.

733
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,240
- Buddy, hurry.
- I'm trying.

734
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,611
Oh, no.

735
00:36:21,574 --> 00:36:24,009
- We did it.
- Now get this sweater off.

736
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:25,929
It itches.

737
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,378
- That's nasty.
- I have had it.

738
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:33,217
No more. The wild animals
have pushed me too far!

739
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:36,295
The next wild I see
crawl out of that forest...

740
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:41,257
...if they don't have their papers,
they are getting a full Fifi smackdown!

741
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:44,182
This is war!

742
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:45,739
Oh, Fifi.

743
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,663
I really don't have the stomach
for this.

744
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,063
He smells like bad barbecue.

745
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,954
Mr. Weenie, are you all right?

746
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:55,506
Mr. Weenie, where are you?

747
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:58,034
He's gone, Bob. Oh, no.

748
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,876
We just found him,
and now he's gone again.

749
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:04,955
Weenie. My poor Weenie.

750
00:37:05,124 --> 00:37:09,517
I wanna go home, Bob.
Please take me home.

751
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:18,162
Now, I've heard some folks say...

752
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:21,883
...the squirrel child
still roams these parts.

753
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:24,935
And some nights,
when the moon is full...

754
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:28,773
...and his monstrous buck teeth
ache to nibble...

755
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:34,733
...you might, if you're unlucky,
hear his bloodcurdling cry!

756
00:37:38,145 --> 00:37:40,741
- Run!
- Let's move!

757
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,229
Sorry. All that food.

758
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:50,471
It's making me...

759
00:37:50,713 --> 00:37:52,831
- Making me hungry.
- Is he kidding?

760
00:37:52,995 --> 00:37:55,875
I'm so exhausted,
I couldn't eat a wee morsel.

761
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,077
That hits the spot.

762
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:11,400
Great. Even my roasting stick
is weak and pathetic.

763
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:15,040
Hey. Don't that look
just like my man, Elli...?

764
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,608
What was with Elliot
this morning anyway?

765
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:21,925
Oh, hey. I wonder what's in here.

766
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:24,368
Yes. Check this out.

767
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,574
This is a little something
Beth taught me.

768
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:34,618
These are called s'mores.

769
00:38:34,783 --> 00:38:37,014
Try some.
They take your mind off of everything.

770
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:40,064
Clear your head. You ain't gonna
have nothing on your mind.

771
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,264
I hope it works.

772
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:45,785
You know what?
I'm glad Elliot's out of my life.

773
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,910
Come on. I know you guys
exchanged some words back there...

774
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:50,632
...but you're meant for each other.

775
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:53,025
- He's crazy about you.
- Really?

776
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:56,507
I bet Elliot's never once mentioned
that he loves me.

777
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:58,512
Has he?

778
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,993
Come on, we're guys.
We talk about guy stuff.

779
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:04,552
You know, like sports.

780
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:08,514
Rabbit bowling, rabbit tennis,
hockey with rabbits.

781
00:39:08,686 --> 00:39:10,678
- I'll take that as a no.
- All right.

782
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:14,080
Take this marshmallow, for example.
It's great all by itself.

783
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:17,528
It's soft, fluffy and sweet.
Like you, Giselle.

784
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:19,686
Oh, Boog,
you're embarrassing yourself.

785
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:22,005
Stay with me.
Now, check out this chocolate bar.

786
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:23,164
It's awesome too.

787
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:26,808
It's full of caffeine and sugar,
and it make you spazz out.

788
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:27,968
Like Elliot.

789
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:30,449
And even though on their own,
both are great...

790
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,658
...neither are perfect, in my opinion.

791
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:35,213
But they are perfect together.

792
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:36,578
Come on. Give it a try.

793
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:41,587
That's it. There you go.

794
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:44,939
You're right, Boog.

795
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,466
- This is really good.
- That's what I'm talking about.

796
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,990
Unfortunately, some chocolate bars
feel that being in a s'more...

797
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:53,545
...is too much commitment
and would rather run free...

798
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:55,628
...instead of settling
for some marshmallow.

799
00:39:55,797 --> 00:39:58,313
- You're missing the point.
- Now that the wedding's off...

800
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,680
...I bet Elliot's singing a new tune
and having the time of his life.

801
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:06,804
Cold. So cold.

802
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:11,480
I don't need anybody.
I can take care of myself.

803
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:39,979
This... This is a good
character- building moment.

804
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:44,940
Elliot, remember,
you are a wild creature toughing it out.

805
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,706
I'll find Mr. Weenie all by myself.

806
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,993
I don't need anybody.
And I definitely don't need a girlfriend.

807
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:56,515
So what if she tucks me in at night,
or listens to my problems?

808
00:40:56,678 --> 00:40:58,432
Makes really good
pine- cone crunchies...

809
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,274
...or rubs my head
when I have sickies?

810
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:04,241
Criminy, what have I done?

811
00:41:06,245 --> 00:41:08,965
Giselle!

812
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:15,046
Break er, break er.
Let's put the pedal to the metal.

813
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:16,610
Ten-four.

814
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:18,047
Roberto, come on now.

815
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:20,934
Hurry up.
Time to go to Pet Paradiso.

816
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:24,567
Did you hear that, Fif?
I'm so excited.

817
00:41:24,737 --> 00:41:27,536
I'm looking forward
to the water slides and the buffet...

818
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:30,818
...and the pool and the babes.

819
00:41:30,981 --> 00:41:32,130
How about you, Fifi?

820
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:38,339
- Easy does it. Keep that ice pack on.
- Shut up!

821
00:41:38,506 --> 00:41:40,099
Good advice, bud.

822
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:47,785
Here.

823
00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:50,750
- Here.
- What Deni's trying to say is...

824
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:52,792
...this is where the Weenie was.

825
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:55,871
- Gone.
- Oh, that's just great.

826
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:58,918
- Well, let's check it out.
- I'm on it.

827
00:42:01,441 --> 00:42:04,834
What have we here?
Aye, Mr. Weenie was definitely here.

828
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:06,996
Come on, Squiz.
What else you got for me?

829
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,561
And over here,
a titanic battle ensued.

830
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:12,447
A battle? Are you serious?

831
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:15,409
- Is he for real?
- Wait, wait, look.

832
00:42:15,571 --> 00:42:20,010
And here,
the unspeakable happened.

833
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:21,608
- What?
- What's the unspeakable?

834
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:24,371
It's unspeakable because
the tracks end here. I got bupkis.

835
00:42:24,537 --> 00:42:27,736
- Oh, brother, you got to be ki...
- Where do you think they went?

836
00:42:27,898 --> 00:42:31,338
How would I know?
I'm a tracker, not a bleeding psychic.

837
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,659
- What do you think, Boog?
- I don't know.

838
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:38,455
If only we had some kind of a sign.

839
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:41,506
- Come on, everyone.
- Oh, I hope this is the right way.

840
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,025
Stay sharp
and keep your eyes peeled.

841
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:51,105
Fifi, would you take a gander
at this?

842
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:55,873
This, my half-pint friend,
puts the P in "paradise."

843
00:42:56,038 --> 00:42:57,677
Oh, Roberto.

844
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,401
- I can't... I can't do this.
- Come on, Fifi.

845
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:03,919
I think a bald spot
makes you look more sophisticated.

846
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,758
- Singe is the new pompadour.
- Oh, shut up!

847
00:43:06,925 --> 00:43:07,915
Sure thing.

848
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:17,243
We gave him everything
he could've ever wanted, right, Bob?

849
00:43:17,853 --> 00:43:21,484
I don't know if we should
go on living without him, Bob.

850
00:43:21,655 --> 00:43:22,645
No, no, no.

851
00:43:22,816 --> 00:43:25,536
He would want us to go on
living our lives, wouldn't he, Bob?

852
00:43:25,698 --> 00:43:27,257
Road hog!

853
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,532
I knew you'd agree.

854
00:43:32,302 --> 00:43:33,622
I'm free, I'm free

855
00:43:33,783 --> 00:43:34,933
Sing it with me, Buddy.

856
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:37,061
Free at last, free at last

857
00:43:37,706 --> 00:43:40,267
What monstrosity is that?

858
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:41,698
Scary.

859
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,989
Elliot?

860
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:47,947
Where are the others?

861
00:43:48,112 --> 00:43:51,073
Oh, they're rescuing
Mr. Weenie and Buddy.

862
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:52,589
- Hey, Buddy.
- Hi there.

863
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:53,792
- But Weenie...
- And Buddy.

864
00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:54,946
- Are free like you.

865
00:43:55,117 --> 00:43:57,508
Oh, yeah. I'm free.

866
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:00,434
Free to be alone
for the rest of my life.

867
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:01,716
You don't understand.

868
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:04,192
Our friends are heading
to Pet Paradiso.

869
00:44:04,524 --> 00:44:05,753
Have them get me a T-shirt.

870
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:09,365
The pets, they hate the wilds.

871
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:13,523
They're in serious danger.
Wake up, mein Freund.

872
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,604
Weenie. When did you get here?

873
00:44:15,772 --> 00:44:18,890
Don't you see?
Boog, McSquizzy, Giselle.

874
00:44:19,054 --> 00:44:21,649
- They'll all be torn to pieces.
- Torn to pizzas?

875
00:44:21,816 --> 00:44:23,535
- Pieces, you Strudelk opf.
- Pieces.

876
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:25,849
- Giselle's in trouble?
- Yeah, Giselle!

877
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:29,057
Well, why didn't you say so?
Giselle, my love!

878
00:44:29,221 --> 00:44:33,136
- I'm coming to save you!
- You're going the wrong way.

879
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,182
No, I'm not...!

880
00:44:35,785 --> 00:44:37,618
Goodbye.

881
00:44:41,148 --> 00:44:42,822
Look at all those RVs.

882
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,265
Weenie must be here.

883
00:44:45,111 --> 00:44:46,625
So how are we gonna get inside?

884
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,752
I'm a grizzly. No biggie.
We'll just walk in.

885
00:44:49,914 --> 00:44:51,746
Look, just like that little guy.

886
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:54,352
Wild animal breach.

887
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:59,719
Okay. Who's got
the next brilliant idea?

888
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:01,760
Aye, it's easy.
We could tunnel our way in.

889
00:45:01,923 --> 00:45:03,755
Or we could fly you all in.

890
00:45:03,924 --> 00:45:05,039
Oh, there's a great idea.

891
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:09,246
A 1 -pound bag of crazy
lifting a 1 200-pound bag of lazy.

892
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:12,527
- What? I'm 900 pounds.
- That's crap.

893
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,490
- Oh, you think you so tough?
- Come on, is that your best shot?

894
00:45:15,652 --> 00:45:16,802
- What do you got?
- Stop it.

895
00:45:16,973 --> 00:45:18,123
- Stop it!
- Shove off.

896
00:45:18,294 --> 00:45:19,647
Grow up, you two.

897
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:22,377
Now, come on. Let's stay on track.

898
00:45:24,177 --> 00:45:25,817
It looks safe enough.

899
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:28,139
Follow me.

900
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:39,180
What's wrong?

901
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:42,019
Come on, spit it out.

902
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,831
Oh, you're so beautiful.

903
00:45:44,991 --> 00:45:46,186
- Just like Mama.
- Okay.

904
00:45:46,352 --> 00:45:48,026
I see a woman and her dog.

905
00:45:48,194 --> 00:45:50,185
Yeah. Look again.

906
00:45:53,997 --> 00:45:56,229
- Oh, I'm gonna have nightmares!
- Quiet.

907
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:58,516
Come along, Jezzabelle. Heel.

908
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:01,594
Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

909
00:46:01,763 --> 00:46:03,037
Definitely.

910
00:46:03,684 --> 00:46:06,405
There we go. Perfecto.

911
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:09,040
This is not at all what I was thinking.

912
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:10,961
- This'll never work.
- Yeah.

913
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:13,929
Sure it will. We look great.

914
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:18,251
What? I could sell this.

915
00:46:21,136 --> 00:46:22,855
Is he serious?

916
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:28,014
Boog, the idea
is to blend in with the pets.

917
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,900
She's right. You look ridiculous.

918
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:31,381
All right, fine.

919
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:35,174
- But if things get all crazy...
- We'll come get you. I promise.

920
00:46:36,866 --> 00:46:39,746
Do I really have to wear a bow?
I look like a jessie.

921
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:42,982
You're supposed to be a little dog,
and all little dogs wear bows.

922
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,791
What are you two looking at?
Keep an eye on them.

923
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:47,546
Deni, follow me.

924
00:46:47,714 --> 00:46:51,914
Okay.
All the time, "Deni, do this, do that."

925
00:46:53,717 --> 00:46:55,037
Interesting.

926
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:56,957
Oh, poor Fifi.

927
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,799
Here. A little zinc will help
protect that tender pink skin.

928
00:47:01,962 --> 00:47:03,443
Have fun now.

929
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:04,879
It's not bad.

930
00:47:05,045 --> 00:47:07,435
No one will even notice.

931
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:10,845
No one will notice?

932
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:12,966
No one will notice?

933
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,359
No one will notice?

934
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:15,726
- No one will notice?
- Okay.

935
00:47:15,892 --> 00:47:17,292
- No one will notice?
- Okay.

936
00:47:17,453 --> 00:47:19,410
- He noticed. He noticed.
- Okay.

937
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:20,645
- I noticed.
- Take it...

938
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:21,966
- You noticed.
- I heard you.

939
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:23,776
- We all noticed. I noticed!
- I got it.

940
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:24,927
Forget about it.

941
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:26,134
Me and my big mouth.

942
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,811
- One king and two doggy beds.
- And can I have synthetic pillows?

943
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:33,572
This is so weird.

944
00:47:39,348 --> 00:47:41,817
Classic flattop. One of my favourites.

945
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,709
Of all the stupid...

946
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,148
- Quiet.
- Fresh cut. Come and get it.

947
00:47:46,312 --> 00:47:48,225
This is the strangest place
I've ever seen.

948
00:47:48,394 --> 00:47:50,956
Let's find Weenie
and get out of here.

949
00:47:51,356 --> 00:47:53,234
Just ignore them.

950
00:47:53,397 --> 00:47:55,275
Keep walking. No eye contact.

951
00:47:55,438 --> 00:47:58,034
What you looking at,
you wee bug-eyed freak?

952
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,271
McSquizzy.

953
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:01,160
What did I just say?

954
00:48:01,522 --> 00:48:03,435
- Get down, everyone.
- Go get it, boy. Fetch.

955
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:05,516
Fetch. Fetch it, buddy.

956
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:07,438
- Mine, mine, mine.
- One more.

957
00:48:07,606 --> 00:48:09,998
This place is giving me
the skeevies.

958
00:48:10,248 --> 00:48:12,559
Giselle!

959
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,124
- My spine.
- We're here.

960
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:22,118
This looks nothing like the brochure,
right, Weenie?

961
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:23,845
Pets and their owners.

962
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:28,122
They look so happy together.

963
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:31,364
Oh, I don't know if I can go in there
without my mama.

964
00:48:31,532 --> 00:48:33,125
Oh, forget Mama.

965
00:48:33,293 --> 00:48:35,683
Giselle. We have to get in there
for Giselle.

966
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:38,086
- And the others.
- It's too much. I can't.

967
00:48:38,256 --> 00:48:40,977
Repeat after me: I'm wild.

968
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:42,618
I'm wild.

969
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,974
With conviction.

970
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,415
I'm wild!

971
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:47,619
- What was that for?
- That was payback.

972
00:48:47,783 --> 00:48:49,262
Fair enough.

973
00:48:49,424 --> 00:48:50,699
What was that for?

974
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:53,221
That one was just for fun.
Now, let's do this!

975
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:55,059
Might be a little cold.

976
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:58,780
That looks painful.

977
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,260
- Too hard?
- Poor guy, they stretched him out.

978
00:49:01,432 --> 00:49:03,503
Another round, Mr. Bailey?

979
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:05,585
Another round, Mr. Whiskers?

980
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,550
Hey there, pretty lady.

981
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,755
Who's he calling a lady?

982
00:49:11,919 --> 00:49:14,196
- Hey.
- Hello, baby.

983
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,432
Beat it, Doberman pinhead.
She's taken.

984
00:49:16,802 --> 00:49:18,600
Good looks and funny too.

985
00:49:18,764 --> 00:49:22,759
But I was not talking to the Dalmatian,
little Miss Sugar-Snack.

986
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:25,726
- Idiot. I'm not a girl!
- Hurry along. Let's not be rude.

987
00:49:25,888 --> 00:49:27,288
Hey, chica.

988
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:30,329
You take care
of that body for Rico, huh?

989
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:31,888
"Take care of that bod"?

990
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:36,014
I'll give you "Take care of that bod,"
you big musclebound bag of...

991
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:38,691
- There, there. I see them.
- Look, I spotted them.

992
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:40,337
- I still got it, eh?
- Genius.

993
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:43,379
- Mr. Weenie.
- Show yourself, laddie.

994
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,529
Mr. Weenie?

995
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:46,101
Weenie?

996
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:50,982
Roger, something's not right.
Do you smell something fishy here?

997
00:49:51,145 --> 00:49:53,456
Barracuda.

998
00:49:54,307 --> 00:49:57,142
Weenie.
Where are you, you wee pup...?

999
00:49:57,509 --> 00:49:59,023
Oh, goodness me.

1000
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,184
I think we have some dogs
of a different breed.

1001
00:50:02,353 --> 00:50:04,993
The girl with the bow, she's mine.

1002
00:50:05,675 --> 00:50:08,794
- We have to go.
- Yes, we're late. Very late.

1003
00:50:09,357 --> 00:50:12,317
- Stanley, it's the fishies.
- Not now, Roger.

1004
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,074
Oh, no.

1005
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,558
My friends, today justice
wears a blue barrette...

1006
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:23,242
...and a rhinestone collar.

1007
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:26,409
Excuse me,
you got a wee something right there.

1008
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:29,642
Quiet! Squirrel! Varmint!

1009
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:32,566
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Come on, take it down a notch.

1010
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:35,123
- Shut up!
- Deni, this does not look good.

1011
00:50:35,294 --> 00:50:37,047
- Let's go get Boog.
- Bad. Very bad.

1012
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:43,130
- Quiet.
- Okay.

1013
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,499
Elliot, Weenie.
Thank goodness you're safe.

1014
00:50:47,463 --> 00:50:49,215
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

1015
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,263
What do you mean?
I'm your best friend.

1016
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:53,019
- McSquizzy?
- McSquizzy?

1017
00:50:53,187 --> 00:50:54,337
He doesn't even like you.

1018
00:50:54,508 --> 00:50:57,707
Look, I'm not talking to some
random overweight sheepdog...

1019
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:00,260
...about my personal relationships.
- It's me, Boog.

1020
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:03,266
- Boog's fatter. No way.
- Elliot.

1021
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:05,234
It is you. Did you lose weight?

1022
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,673
When did you start thinking
McSquizzy was your BFF?

1023
00:51:09,757 --> 00:51:11,875
Well, you were hibernating,
and we were hanging.

1024
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:14,999
Turns out we have a lot in common.
We both like nuts.

1025
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:16,960
- You are nuts.
- Stop this insanity!

1026
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:19,684
- Where are the others?
- They're inside looking for you.

1027
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,201
- And they've been captured!
- Captured?

1028
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,237
Oh, come on.

1029
00:51:25,408 --> 00:51:27,081
Boog. I'm Boog.

1030
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:28,764
No, Boog is a big fat guy.

1031
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:30,206
- That's not you.
- I know.

1032
00:51:30,372 --> 00:51:33,571
- I thought that he was McSquizzy too.
- Okay, stop. Would you all stop?

1033
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:36,169
- What do you mean, captured?
- They've been captured...

1034
00:51:36,336 --> 00:51:38,771
...by a gaggle of vicious domestics.

1035
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:41,248
- Enough talk.
- Hang on there, E.

1036
00:51:41,419 --> 00:51:43,411
You don't wanna go stomping on
up in there.

1037
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,732
- You're right. What we need is a...
- Don't say it.

1038
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,541
Don't say it.

1039
00:51:48,624 --> 00:51:51,014
- Plan!

1040
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:53,864
- This is not gonna work.
- It'll work.

1041
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,541
Don't doubt me, number two friend.

1042
00:51:55,709 --> 00:51:58,862
- Trust the plan.
- Trust the plan.

1043
00:52:01,072 --> 00:52:02,301
- Well, that was easy.
- See?

1044
00:52:02,473 --> 00:52:04,351
- I told you it would work.
- Hey!

1045
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:06,392
- Just a minute!
- The plan's not gonna work.

1046
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,991
- The plan's not gonna work.
- Be cool. Hold it together.

1047
00:52:09,157 --> 00:52:12,788
Do you think you can just
waltz right in here...

1048
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:16,272
...without your room key,
Mrs. Schlapiano?

1049
00:52:16,442 --> 00:52:17,592
You must've dropped this.

1050
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:23,036
A voice like an angel.

1051
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:27,168
- I wonder where I left my room key.
- Wait a second!

1052
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:28,810
Nice try.

1053
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,850
You're not fooling anyone
with that phoney disguise.

1054
00:52:32,013 --> 00:52:34,448
What are you wearing,
a porcupine on your head?

1055
00:52:34,614 --> 00:52:36,607
Get out of here, you vagrant.

1056
00:52:36,776 --> 00:52:38,654
- We made it.
- Yeah, that worked well.

1057
00:52:38,817 --> 00:52:42,255
Well, yes, because we had a plan.

1058
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,140
Giselle. Giselle, where are you?

1059
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,342
Go.

1060
00:52:50,745 --> 00:52:53,022
Help! Help!

1061
00:52:53,187 --> 00:52:55,419
Help! Somebody, help us!

1062
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,345
Scream all you like.
The humans can't hear you from here.

1063
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:01,309
And the house pets...

1064
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:06,425
...well, they hate wilds
just as much as I do!

1065
00:53:06,596 --> 00:53:08,553
When I get free,
you're gonna pay for this...

1066
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:11,950
...you big tube, you numpty,
you big lassie's blouse.

1067
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,430
Watch your language, varmint.
There's a lady present.

1068
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:16,513
What a vile little creature.

1069
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:22,683
My friends, it is time
to tame these savage beasts.

1070
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,602
You gotta be kidding me, right?

1071
00:53:27,089 --> 00:53:30,288
Hey, Fif. Are you sure we can't
let the little girl squirrel go?

1072
00:53:30,452 --> 00:53:32,683
Yeah. Let the little girl squirrel go.

1073
00:53:32,853 --> 00:53:34,924
Not a chance.

1074
00:53:35,094 --> 00:53:37,166
Roberto, you know what to do.

1075
00:53:37,337 --> 00:53:39,931
- Wha...? I don't know what you mean.
- Collar them, you fool.

1076
00:53:40,098 --> 00:53:42,454
- Collar them, collar them, collar them.
- I hear you.

1077
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,179
- Okay.
- Collar them, collar them...

1078
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:46,219
...you fool.
- Calm down. Okay.

1079
00:53:46,702 --> 00:53:49,013
- The pool, so tempting.
- Forget the pool.

1080
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,017
- Elliot's right.
- Remember the objective.

1081
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,621
- Oh, sweet libations.
- Control yourself.

1082
00:53:53,787 --> 00:53:55,905
- The buffet. Wiener schnitzel?
- No. Forget food.

1083
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:57,344
- Strudel.
- He's not listening.

1084
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,071
- Mama's favourite.
- Oh, nuts.

1085
00:54:01,192 --> 00:54:02,546
Boog, grab him.

1086
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:04,193
- Weenie.
- Come on. Come back here.

1087
00:54:04,354 --> 00:54:06,187
- Way to go, Boog.
- You go on ahead.

1088
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:07,506
I'll catch up.

1089
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,472
Leave us alone. Help!

1090
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,155
- Try this.
- Thanks.

1091
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,992
- Help!
- Giselle.

1092
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,357
You fuzz ball,
you'll never get away with this.

1093
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:19,755
Oh, but I already have.

1094
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:23,761
Oh, but you already haven't.

1095
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:26,888
- What are you doing?
- It's Mrs. Schlapiano.

1096
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:30,600
Get lost, old lady.
This does not concern you.

1097
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:32,047
I am no old lady.

1098
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:35,925
- It is the porcupine in disguise.
- Yeah.

1099
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:40,253
- I didn't see him up there. Did you?
- It's me, Elliot.

1100
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:42,172
- Who is Elliot?
- I am.

1101
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,017
And I'm here to rescue my lady,
kick butt and take names.

1102
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:48,379
What's your name?

1103
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:52,735
- Did anybody see that coming?
- Yes.

1104
00:54:52,906 --> 00:54:55,946
- Even Roger saw that coming.
- I did?

1105
00:54:56,109 --> 00:54:59,148
Come on, Weenie.
Snap out of it, man.

1106
00:55:00,472 --> 00:55:01,747
Das ist beautiful.

1107
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:04,269
Weenie, would you
come back here?

1108
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:05,790
Oh, man.

1109
00:55:05,955 --> 00:55:09,633
Now how you gonna hide
a 900-pound bear?

1110
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:11,836
A 1 200-pound wild bear!

1111
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,672
What, 1 200 pounds?

1112
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:16,515
Girl, you know that ain't right.
I'm 900 pounds.

1113
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:20,438
This is mostly fur...

1114
00:55:20,606 --> 00:55:22,438
...and fur adds
a hundred pounds easy.

1115
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:24,276
Go, go, go!

1116
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:27,487
I'll be bulking up to hibernate.
Just wait till I step out that...

1117
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:29,880
- Bear!
- Bear!

1118
00:55:30,052 --> 00:55:31,281
We have a security breach.

1119
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,524
Perimeter has been compromised.

1120
00:55:33,694 --> 00:55:36,368
Telling you, I'm gonna be
the baddest bear ever in the woods.

1121
00:55:36,536 --> 00:55:38,767
- We have a grizzly on the loose.
- Then we'll see...

1122
00:55:38,937 --> 00:55:41,407
...who's ready for swimming season.
- Darts loaded.

1123
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:42,854
Fire!

1124
00:55:44,901 --> 00:55:47,896
Hey, man, be cool. Back off.

1125
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:49,053
Go.

1126
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:50,705
Little dude, go.

1127
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:52,424
You come back here right now.

1128
00:55:53,507 --> 00:55:55,180
Go.

1129
00:56:00,032 --> 00:56:01,067
This is crazy.

1130
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:07,349
Weenie!

1131
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,275
Fifi, come on.
Is this really necessary?

1132
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:16,194
You see why
we have to do this, right?

1133
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:18,400
They will take everything.

1134
00:56:18,564 --> 00:56:21,603
Our food, our homes, our very lives!

1135
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:25,204
Wait. If this is the end,
I need to say something.

1136
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:29,444
- Giselle, I really, really, really...
- Really?

1137
00:56:29,611 --> 00:56:32,047
- Time's up.
- Now, you hold your little old horses.

1138
00:56:32,214 --> 00:56:34,888
I do believe this boy's
got something on his mind.

1139
00:56:35,055 --> 00:56:38,527
- Yeah, give the guy a sporting chance.
- Oh, just forget it, Elliot.

1140
00:56:38,697 --> 00:56:40,496
You've already made it clear
how you feel.

1141
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:43,971
I feel that this
has gone on long enough.

1142
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:45,734
- Please let me finish.
- Fine.

1143
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,338
You've got 60 seconds.

1144
00:56:48,504 --> 00:56:50,416
Are you serious?
How about a minute?

1145
00:56:50,586 --> 00:56:53,147
- Hey, you better hurry up.
- Okay, okay.

1146
00:56:53,307 --> 00:56:56,620
Giselle, before the wedding,
my rack was huge.

1147
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:57,825
- What?
- It's true.

1148
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:01,223
Very huge. And it broke very bad.

1149
00:57:01,392 --> 00:57:04,671
And without my huge rack,
I felt like less of a buck.

1150
00:57:04,835 --> 00:57:07,111
- But as time went on...
- Thirty seconds.

1151
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:11,956
The point is, I'm a better buck
with not a huge rack on my head...

1152
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,319
...but with you, Giselle,
on my head instead.

1153
00:57:15,482 --> 00:57:16,711
Oh, that's awful.

1154
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:18,761
And how does this relate
to our wedding...

1155
00:57:18,925 --> 00:57:21,121
...and the fact that you left me
at the altar?

1156
00:57:21,286 --> 00:57:23,882
- Left you at the altar?
- You, sir, are a coward.

1157
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,166
Oh, no.

1158
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,252
- No, no. You are missing the point.
- Oh, come on.

1159
00:57:31,412 --> 00:57:34,452
During our wedding, there was
the incident with the other woman.

1160
00:57:34,615 --> 00:57:35,684
Another woman?

1161
00:57:35,855 --> 00:57:37,687
I can't even handle one.

1162
00:57:37,857 --> 00:57:39,416
Speak for yourself, amigo.

1163
00:57:39,578 --> 00:57:41,491
No. No.
Not that kind of other woman.

1164
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,093
The kind that grabbed Mr. Weenie.

1165
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,854
- You're disgusting.
- That is a pig.

1166
00:57:45,022 --> 00:57:46,979
- You make me sick.
- This is getting good.

1167
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:51,258
- Isn't it refreshing?
- Come here, you.

1168
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:55,667
Fifteen seconds.

1169
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,064
Will you, please?
Giselle, you are good.

1170
00:57:59,232 --> 00:58:00,552
And me? Not always good.

1171
00:58:00,712 --> 00:58:03,022
But with you, the me
that is not good can be better.

1172
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:05,505
You make my not-good me
almost not bad.

1173
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:07,712
And that's not almost good,
it's almost great.

1174
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:10,439
So, Giselle, you and me,
not badder, but greater.

1175
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:11,589
Understand?

1176
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,991
- Tick, tick, tick!
- What is he talking about?

1177
00:58:14,162 --> 00:58:16,154
Forget it.
Just push the button already.

1178
00:58:16,323 --> 00:58:17,837
- Finally.
- No. Don't.

1179
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:20,315
Cannonball!

1180
00:58:20,486 --> 00:58:21,475
Gotcha.

1181
00:58:21,646 --> 00:58:23,239
I love you, Boog.

1182
00:58:25,529 --> 00:58:26,645
Goodness me.

1183
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:32,289
Hold on, now.

1184
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:34,650
There it is.

1185
00:58:35,295 --> 00:58:36,888
- That was close.
- Is everybody okay?

1186
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,173
You're still in danger.

1187
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:39,771
The Fifi will kill you all.

1188
00:58:39,938 --> 00:58:41,338
Get the collars off.

1189
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,218
Fifi, where are you going?

1190
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:46,812
Mr. Weenie?

1191
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:49,215
Let's get you out of those ropes.

1192
00:58:49,705 --> 00:58:51,378
- Boog, look out.
- Take cover.

1193
00:58:53,148 --> 00:58:55,947
Elliot, you take care of these guys.
I'll draw the others away.

1194
00:58:56,109 --> 00:58:58,021
- We gotta get these off.
- Thank you.

1195
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:00,385
I won't let you hurt my friends.

1196
00:59:00,553 --> 00:59:02,032
Hey.

1197
00:59:03,154 --> 00:59:04,713
Weenie's in trouble. I gotta go.

1198
00:59:04,876 --> 00:59:06,673
- Weenie, I'm coming.
- Elliot, careful.

1199
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:11,231
Break er, break er.
Mudflaps, do you read me? Over.

1200
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,437
This is Mudflaps. Over.

1201
00:59:13,602 --> 00:59:14,955
You're not gonna believe it.

1202
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:17,512
Mr. Weenie just
ran by me poolside.

1203
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:20,120
- Over.
- Bob, they found Mr. Weenie.

1204
00:59:20,286 --> 00:59:21,401
Hurry. Get in.

1205
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:25,688
Hey, where's the fire, huh?

1206
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:31,127
Oh, boy. There it is.

1207
00:59:31,973 --> 00:59:34,170
Mr. Weenie, Mama's coming, baby.

1208
00:59:34,335 --> 00:59:36,726
Mama's coming.

1209
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:42,295
Hey, Chet, lock up, would you?

1210
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,259
I'm calling it a day, huh?

1211
00:59:48,145 --> 00:59:49,544
Finally, some alone time.

1212
00:59:51,986 --> 00:59:53,740
Look out there, doggy.

1213
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:55,501
Weenie. Weenie.

1214
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:58,779
- Are you all right?
- Weenie's fine. Get the remote.

1215
00:59:58,951 --> 01:00:00,068
- I got it.
- Take this!

1216
01:00:02,794 --> 01:00:03,783
Oh, no, you don't.

1217
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,280
Oh, my.

1218
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:16,954
Save Rico, chica. Save Rico.

1219
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:18,240
There's so many.

1220
01:00:20,406 --> 01:00:21,396
Lock and load.

1221
01:00:21,687 --> 01:00:22,676
Pull!

1222
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:28,290
Stanley, duck.

1223
01:00:28,451 --> 01:00:30,568
Man down. I'm hit.

1224
01:00:30,732 --> 01:00:34,045
See? One duck, two duck.

1225
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:35,535
We did it.

1226
01:00:35,696 --> 01:00:38,576
- Come on, Rico.
- Rico got your back, baby.

1227
01:00:38,738 --> 01:00:40,411
Take that.

1228
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,849
Fire!

1229
01:00:47,704 --> 01:00:48,978
Saved by the slobber.

1230
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,945
- Get him off me! Get him off!
- Take this, you wild beast!

1231
01:00:52,908 --> 01:00:54,023
Oh, no.

1232
01:00:54,508 --> 01:00:56,820
- That's Elliot.
- That ain't good. Let's go.

1233
01:01:02,194 --> 01:01:03,593
- Elliot?
- Oh, no.

1234
01:01:03,755 --> 01:01:05,154
- Rico, where is he?
- Oh, man.

1235
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:07,911
- He's gotta get those collars off.
- Stop.

1236
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:09,637
Or everyone gets it.

1237
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:12,439
Do you understand?

1238
01:01:15,763 --> 01:01:18,359
- Elliot. You okay?
- Yes, yes.

1239
01:01:18,525 --> 01:01:21,485
- You could've gotten here sooner.
- You're breathing, aren't you?

1240
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:25,927
Let this be an example to you all.

1241
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:27,409
- No, don't.
- No, Fifi, no.

1242
01:01:27,571 --> 01:01:29,324
- Don't do it.
- Fifi, stop. Seriously.

1243
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:31,724
- Don't do it, Fifi.
- Don't push the button.

1244
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,924
Hold on, pal.

1245
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:36,926
This is it.

1246
01:01:39,899 --> 01:01:41,618
Oh, no.

1247
01:01:43,382 --> 01:01:45,499
What? How did you do that?

1248
01:01:45,662 --> 01:01:47,415
The old switcheroo, Boog.

1249
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:53,059
That was not fair.

1250
01:01:54,388 --> 01:01:55,708
I gotta be honest with you.

1251
01:01:55,869 --> 01:01:57,350
He kind of had that coming.

1252
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,265
Ice cream.

1253
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:02,788
Hang in there, Hoppy.

1254
01:02:02,954 --> 01:02:06,153
But, officers, Fox Jaws
said Mr. Weenie was here.

1255
01:02:06,317 --> 01:02:07,831
Are you sure you haven't seen him?

1256
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:11,038
Why don't you run through
that description for me one more time.

1257
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,351
Yeah, Dispatch,
we got a male Caucasian...

1258
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,321
... early 30s,
sustaining multiple pheno injections.

1259
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:18,874
- We're sending him over to County.
- Go...

1260
01:02:19,045 --> 01:02:21,003
You heard him. Go.

1261
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:23,318
He's also dark brown
and long and jiggly...

1262
01:02:23,488 --> 01:02:25,526
...and he walks
with the cutest little waddle.

1263
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,326
Does this match the description
of your dog, ma'am?

1264
01:02:30,852 --> 01:02:32,412
Oh, Mr. Weenie.

1265
01:02:32,574 --> 01:02:35,409
I miss you so much.

1266
01:02:36,177 --> 01:02:37,769
Hey, Roberto, my main man.

1267
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:40,248
- I appreciate the help out there.
- Sure thing.

1268
01:02:40,419 --> 01:02:42,491
And if you're ever
in the city, come on by.

1269
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:44,972
We'll split a pizza pie. My treat.

1270
01:02:45,143 --> 01:02:51,143
From this day forward, domestics
and wilds will live together as one.

1271
01:02:51,306 --> 01:02:53,743
So your doghouse or mine, chica?

1272
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:57,870
Hey, Rico, come here.
Let me share a wee secret with you.

1273
01:02:58,031 --> 01:02:59,751
I'm not a girl!

1274
01:02:59,912 --> 01:03:04,273
What? Seor, you have played
with Rico's emotions.

1275
01:03:05,236 --> 01:03:07,432
Come on, Elliot.
Time to head on home.

1276
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:10,672
- I hear you. Come on, Giselle.
- All right, everybody. Take it easy.

1277
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,275
Well, it's time to swap spit
and hit the road.

1278
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:15,240
You said it, cowboy.

1279
01:03:15,403 --> 01:03:17,075
- Hold on. Wait for me.
- Bye- bye.

1280
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:18,518
Hey, wait, Mr. Weenie.

1281
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:20,119
Aren't you coming?

1282
01:03:20,286 --> 01:03:23,838
Well, I have decided
not to go with you.

1283
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,284
- Why not?
- Because just like you...

1284
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,968
...I have realised that if you're never
tied to anything, you'll never be free.

1285
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:32,568
- We're not tied together anymore.
- This is figurative.

1286
01:03:32,735 --> 01:03:34,373
So we have to be tied up in order...?

1287
01:03:34,536 --> 01:03:36,687
No. We must have limits
to be limitless.

1288
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:40,214
Find a seat. This could take a while.

1289
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,815
All that matters
is to be with the one you love...

1290
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:44,779
... und the one that loves you.

1291
01:03:44,943 --> 01:03:46,696
You're not making
any sense, Weenie.

1292
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:50,222
I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life
with the one who loves me:

1293
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:51,979
Giselle.

1294
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:54,546
Wait for me.

1295
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:55,699
Goodbye, my friends.

1296
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,589
I will miss you all!

1297
01:03:57,752 --> 01:04:01,109
Weenie. It's been ages.

1298
01:04:01,273 --> 01:04:02,787
- Here's my chance.
- Roger.

1299
01:04:02,955 --> 01:04:04,469
Let's go find your buddy Stanley.

1300
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:07,356
No, no, no. He's your friend now.

1301
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,870
- It's so sad, isn't it, Bob?
- Okay, okay.

1302
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,431
Calm down. Calm down.

1303
01:04:13,602 --> 01:04:15,639
Look. There he is. Long and jiggly.

1304
01:04:15,804 --> 01:04:18,558
Mr. Weenie? Is that you?

1305
01:04:19,926 --> 01:04:21,758
Mr. Weenie.

1306
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:28,566
Mr. Weenie!

1307
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:31,521
Oh, my baby.

1308
01:04:31,694 --> 01:04:34,733
You came back to Mama.

1309
01:04:34,896 --> 01:04:36,090
Don't lose him again, now.

1310
01:04:36,256 --> 01:04:38,453
- That dog loves you.
- Never.

1311
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:41,930
Oh, no. The woman-beast
is torturing him again.

1312
01:04:42,101 --> 01:04:44,013
What? Is that what you call torture?

1313
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:49,780
Yeah. Why do you ask?

1314
01:04:49,946 --> 01:04:52,063
Why? Man,
she's showing him affection.

1315
01:04:52,228 --> 01:04:55,221
You know, kiss, kiss, hug, hug.

1316
01:04:56,871 --> 01:04:58,099
I might have misread that.

1317
01:04:58,271 --> 01:04:59,671
You might have misread that?

1318
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:02,189
- Let me at him!
- Hey, hey. Come on now.

1319
01:05:02,354 --> 01:05:04,186
- Come on.
- Don't let go of him, Boog.

1320
01:05:04,355 --> 01:05:08,033
- Take it easy.
- Well, enough of that hullabaloo.

1321
01:05:08,678 --> 01:05:11,240
You know what, Giselle?
Mr. Weenie was right.

1322
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,675
About what?

1323
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:16,678
About, you know, all that stuff
about what really matters.

1324
01:05:16,844 --> 01:05:18,961
Stuff? Oh, Elliot.

1325
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:22,722
How do I know you really feel it
if you can't even say it?

1326
01:05:22,888 --> 01:05:25,164
- Well, do I have to spell it out for you?
- Yes.

1327
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:28,323
- Okay. You, me, together for...
- Hello.

1328
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:29,482
You were saying?

1329
01:05:29,653 --> 01:05:32,566
It's me and you for...

1330
01:05:32,735 --> 01:05:35,729
- Go on.
- Okay, what I'm trying to say is...

1331
01:05:35,897 --> 01:05:38,014
Why do these birds and ducks
suddenly appear...

1332
01:05:38,178 --> 01:05:40,409
... every time you're near?

1333
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,136
Unless, like me...

1334
01:05:43,302 --> 01:05:46,455
...they long to be close to you.

1335
01:05:46,624 --> 01:05:49,459
Oh, Elliot,
that's the most romantic thing...

1336
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:54,578
Why do stars fall down from the sky

1337
01:05:54,749 --> 01:05:59,667
Every time you walk by?

1338
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:01,825
Just lik e me

1339
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:04,226
They long to be

1340
01:06:04,396 --> 01:06:08,027
Close to you

1341
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,839
On the day that you were born
The angels got together

1342
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:17,123
And decided to create
A dream come true

1343
01:06:17,284 --> 01:06:20,119
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold

1344
01:06:20,286 --> 01:06:25,523
And starlight in your eyes of blue

All the girls in town

Close to you

Not too close.

01:07:22,488 --> 01:07:25,049
Close to you

01:07:31,334 --> 01:07:33,326
Close to you

1365
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:36,136
Oh, Roberto, that's beautiful.

1366
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,017
Close to you

1367
01:07:43,182 --> 01:07:44,935
