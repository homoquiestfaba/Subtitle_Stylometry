22 Years Later

2
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,180
Oh my God.

3
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,100
I know... I feel the same way.

4
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,260
Are you just going to sit there? Come on!

5
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,410
She's alive.

6
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,250
What should we do with her?

7
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,250
I don't know.

8
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,250
Oh shit!

9
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,250
Don't move!

10
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:48,243
Stand up. What are you doing?

11
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:51,180
Officer, we are just trying to help her.

12
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,501
What's up with your friend?

13
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:57,603
I don't know. We are not familiar with her.

14
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:00,923
Don't touch me.

15
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,423
What did you give her?

16
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:05,303
Nothing.
She fell from the bridge.

17
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:07,990
Well, of course. Sure.

18
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,870
I love when it rains naked women.

19
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,020
Let's go.

20
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,020
Let him go!

21
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,700
Crazy!

22
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,560
That was cool, dude!

23
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:06,002
Go to hell, lady!

24
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,936
Hey, come on come on.

25
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,270
"Help her", "She is wounded", you say.

26
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
Good morning, Mona.

27
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
As always, with flowers.

28
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,970
Always.

29
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,140
Tamale, as usual?

30
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,140
Yes. And one for Diego.

31
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,090
Can I steal a mango?

32
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,440
Sure.

33
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,980
Good morning-
Good morning-

34
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,020
Hello-
Hello-

35
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,440
Oh, good!

36
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,580
Hey, look. 147 Likes.

37
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,100
I will pass Bruno Mars soon.

38
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,280
And what do you think?

39
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,450
Yes or no?

40
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,990
Breakfast is on the table.

41
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,800
Remember, you have a doctor's
appointment at noon today.

42
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,400
Don't fuss, Doni.

43
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,620
Why are you so stubborn?

44
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,320
I was born that way.

45
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,790
Too late to change some things, agree?

46
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,254
Enjoy your Tamalito.

47
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,466
Thanks.

48
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:45,059
Hi, Dad!

49
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,850
Hey, good morning.

50
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,080
Good luck.

51
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,780
Don't forget... buy eggs on the way home.

52
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,970
Yes, commander.

53
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,500
Bye, Taco.

54
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:16,458
Julia, I was justin thinking about you.

55
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,036
Why exactly?

56
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,825
Sorry.
Diego, come.

57
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,460
I have to go. My sister...

58
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,680
good morning

59
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,180
Hush, Tako!

60
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,970
Hello-
Can I help you?-

61
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,230
I am looking for Daniella Ramos

62
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,423
I'm her  friend.
eh?-

63
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,540
Really?

64
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:02,650
That is strange.

65
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:04,832
Her friends call her Dani.

66
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,214
Dani... yes, of course.

67
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,080
Good morning.

68
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:44,057
Cool, yeah?

69
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,520
It's the future.

70
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:56,520
Diego, Craig wants to talk to you.

71
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,240
- No, he did not call you.
- I know.

72
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,240
Excuse me Sir - Yes? - 
My daughter forgot her lunch again.

73
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,115
Dani Ramos

74
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,957
The rules are the rules, friend.

75
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:26,178
Hard hat, vest.

76
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:29,080
Without those, I can't let you in.

77
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,530
Thank you.

78
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:12,843
What is your father doing here?

79
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,727
What are you doing here, Dad?

80
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,751
You forgot your lunch again, son.

81
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,341
But, Dani took our lunches.

82
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:24,227
Where is Dani?

83
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:27,731
Talking to the boss. They want to 
replace me with a stupid machine.

84
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:29,707
And when will she be back?

85
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:31,794
I don't know.

86
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,980
There she is.

87
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,180
Dad

88
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,810
Dad

89
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,745
What's happening?

90
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,065
Come on.

91
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,420
Go!

92
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,300
I'm fine.

93
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:02,606
Sir, are you okay?

94
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:51,869
Miss, do you need help?

95
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:54,139
No, we're fine. Thanks.

96
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:57,382
Please!

97
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:00,988
Can I help you?

98
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:35,307
Sorry, they're trying to kill us.

99
00:31:10,374 --> 00:31:11,724
Let me help.

100
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:15,865
Okay.

101
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,042
What the heck?!

00:46:40,945 --> 00:46:44,680
Data Processing Center, Mexico

103
00:52:08,856 --> 00:52:09,648
Uncle!

104
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:13,744
Hello, my beauty!

105
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:18,876
What are you doing here?

106
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:53,981
And you don't want to find out, who is hunting us?

107
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:55,793
Dani, I am a coyote.

108
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:58,009
Someone is always hunting me.

109
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:05,056
Officer, the girl is my granddaughter.

110
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:08,895
She is very sick. I have to be around her.

111
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:51,298
U.S. Border Patrol
Laredo, Texas

112
01:53:27,643 --> 01:53:30,494
You took everything I had, you bastard!

01:53:30,557 --> 01:53:31,706
An now...
