1
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,165
This could be it.

2
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,196
And if you're lucky enough
to have tickets

3
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,973
for tonight's game at shea,
better hit the road early.

4
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,892
Traffic's gonna be awful.

5
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,810
The Red Sox, with a chance to win

6
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,813
their first world series since 1918.

7
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,523
And now with a word on just how bad

8
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,443
it's gonna be out there,
it's the traffic man

9
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,363
lone eagle,
looking straight down at us.

10
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,116
Another day of traffic.

11
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,285
Traffic everywhere I look.

12
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,038
Cars stop and go and stop again.

13
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,626
People sit at the wheel,
thinking their thoughts,

14
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,380
day in, day out, red light, green light.

15
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,092
Traffic on the major arteries,

16
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,344
and traffic in the little veins.

17
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,100
Cars, vans, taxis, trucks.

18
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,144
12 hours to game time,

19
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,272
and there's something
you can't bear to face.

20
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,400
Is there a medication you can count on?

21
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,277
Does it prevent history from happening?

22
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:20,200
Limos, mopeds, bikes, and buses.

23
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,787
A menace looming in your life,
accident here,

24
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:28,959
gridlock there, something
washing slowly over you

25
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,295
down the years, through the decades,

26
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,550
birth, death, walk and don't walk.

27
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,222
Store this medication at room temperature.

28
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,932
Continue to take this medication

29
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,892
even if you're feeling well.

30
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,354
But when do you ever feel well?

31
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,067
Traffic, yesterday, today, and tomorrow,

32
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,196
bumper-to-bumper, soul-to-soul.

33
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,159
This is lone eagle, over and out.

34
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,678
Taxi, yo!

35
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,909
I used to drive a taxi.

36
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,412
I ate and I drove.

37
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,269
I wrapped my sandwiches in tin foil.

38
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,652
You are going where?

39
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,584
Across town.

40
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,252
Pretty bad today.

41
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,463
I had one of those big checkered cabs,
you know?

42
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,315
I was religious about my ashtrays, man.

43
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,134
I used to clean my ashtrays religiously.

44
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,887
I am sitting here five years in traffic.

45
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,015
It is one continuous
traffic since I arrive.

46
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,809
Why must it be?

47
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,353
Why must it be?

48
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,111
Laurel, honey, hey!

49
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,073
Wait, hey, keep the meter running, okay?

50
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,658
And try to stay abreast.

51
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,244
Keep up.

52
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,372
Hey.

53
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,832
Hi.

54
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,226
How come I don't see you anymore?

55
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,417
Where are you all day?

56
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,461
I'm at college.
Thought you knew.

57
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,838
Wanna get a coffee?

58
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,124
I don't drink coffee, daddy,

59
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,858
and this is not what we should
be talking about.

60
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,026
What do you wanna talk about?

61
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,370
I'll talk about anything you
wanna talk about. What's this?

62
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,029
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?

63
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,514
Why do you need a radio?

64
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,534
So I can listen to
the ballgame at intermission.

65
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,892
Do you know that mother is seeing

66
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,227
a prominent divorce lawyer?

67
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,728
Don't talk like that.

68
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:55,814
Man.

69
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,193
How prominent, what are you implying?

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,820
She's doing like those Iranians.

71
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,281
I divorce thee, I divorce thee,
I divorce thee.

72
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,033
Okay, okay, look, look, look,

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,286
he has to hear it the same time I do?

74
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,732
What happened to family secrets?

75
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,164
Mother is, you know, totally upset.

76
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,083
So can we talk about it in private?

77
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,212
It's divorce, not incest.

78
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,758
Abulhassan, we're gonna be
getting out here.

79
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,901
Clemens was
hit hard here in game number two.

80
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,054
After a bout with the flu

81
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,723
and pitching on only three days' rest

82
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,182
for the third straight time...

83
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,268
- Nicky!
- Hey, George!

84
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,830
You don't come in for a while.
Everything's okay?

85
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:36,855
Everything's great.

86
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,815
Look at you, you're so healthy,
thick body.

87
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,151
I just wanna punch you right in the chest.

88
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,038
- This is my daughter Laurel.
- My pleasure.

89
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,113
I just wanna hear how it sounds.

90
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,824
I saw your picture in the paper.
Two papers.

91
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,871
Yeah, it means they're getting
ready to kill me.

92
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,952
That's not what I hear.

93
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,996
I got four or five actors working here.

94
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,165
It's the best play since yessiree Bob.

95
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,958
I'm telling you, they say this.

96
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,460
He doesn't wanna hear it.

97
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,480
Things the way I see it, hal.

98
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,756
Number one is pitching.

99
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:03,924
Number two is pitching.

100
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,760
And, don't be surprised,
but number three is pitching.

101
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,852
If lawyers for the mob are
called controversial,

102
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,143
why are divorce lawyers called prominent?

103
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,854
Because they get outstanding settlements.

104
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,675
Mother's determined this time
that there's no turning back.

105
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,697
I just talked to her this morning,
and she said not one word about this.

106
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,904
Because you refuse to
believe she's serious.

107
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,364
You've always refused.

108
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,157
Why are you so steely-eyed?

109
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,035
You know why, it's that course
you're taking in criminology.

110
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,204
Look, she wants you to stop
seeing what's-her-name.

111
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,247
Okay, finally, now and forever.

112
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,209
Do you think that's too much to ask
of your wife of 19 years?

113
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,400
- Look...
- Mother won't even tell me

114
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,021
how long you've been
seeing this person.

115
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,815
Okay, she's embarrassed to tell me,

116
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,924
so why don't you tell me?

117
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,676
Why do you always call her mother?

118
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,552
It sounds so tragic and unforgiven.

119
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,238
Whatever happened to mom?
How about mom?

120
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,889
I didn't turn her into mother, you did.

121
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,852
This person and I are a thing
of the total past, I promise.

122
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,968
You know what mother said to me?

123
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,527
That daddy's demons are so intense,

124
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,029
he doesn't even know when he's lying.

125
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,034
Jesus Christ.

126
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,378
I used to drive a cab.

127
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,171
Where you going, mister?

128
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,298
I loved driving a cab.

129
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,676
Loved it, loved my taxi.

130
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,805
I'd go 12 hours nonstop except to pee,
take pee breaks.

131
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,099
Pee under the Manhattan bridge,
peed in parks,

132
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,976
empty playgrounds, parking lots.

133
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,270
Peed many times under
the Manhattan bridge.

134
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,314
I used to be head of neurosurgery,

135
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,275
big hospital in the ussr.

136
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,778
This hospital, I'm not kidding.

137
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,488
Big, huh?

138
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,574
I opened thousands of brains.

139
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,492
What'd you find?

140
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,664
A big mess, every time.

141
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,771
Hey.

142
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,314
How are you?

143
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,899
Was I expecting you?

144
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,778
Spur of the moment kind of thing.

145
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,534
Alan albright called me
a handsome woman last night.

146
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,888
That's the second time he's done that,

147
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,246
the son of a bitch.

148
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,956
I heard Alan's sick.

149
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,582
Alan's very sick.

150
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,251
You know about Dell?

151
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,585
What about her?

152
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,045
She's dying.

153
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,631
She died.

154
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,484
I just talked to her like two days ago.

155
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,511
Well, apparently it didn't help.

156
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,348
- You know about Peter, of course?
- Our Peter?

157
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,810
Yeah, they figured out
why he can't remember his lines.

158
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,312
There's something living in his brain.

159
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,607
A parasite he picked up
in Borneo doing a movie.

160
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,984
Will he get through it?

161
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,861
They're watching him closely.

162
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,238
There's an emergency
rehearsal this afternoon.

163
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,491
They want you to be there,
bolster his confidence.

164
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,034
And that's not all, Nicky.

165
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,078
I've been backing your plays for 15 years,

166
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,038
and I have never been more depressed.

167
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,582
About what?

168
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,919
Steven schwimmer, the most ruthless critic

169
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,297
in town getting his first
crack at Nicky rogan.

170
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,441
This is another situation, right,

171
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,693
where you're trying to find a disaster

172
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,385
worse than anything I can come up with.

173
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,084
I'm not worried about this guy.

174
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,346
I just wanna get a haircut.

175
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,782
Yeah, well, ever since he started

176
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,225
reviewing Broadway, nobody's worried
about anything else.

177
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,853
Yeah, let 'em send their
brilliant boy critic.

178
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,189
I've got bigger things to worry about

179
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,356
than tonight's opening.

180
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,901
Red Sox.

181
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,277
I thought they were winning.

182
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,404
They are, three games to two,

183
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,157
but if you know anything about
the team's history,

184
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,910
you'll know there's
a tragedy in the making.

185
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,204
I've been carrying this
franchise on my back

186
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,830
since I was six years old.

187
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,480
It can't be that personal.

188
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,682
A team you followed all your life

189
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,712
and they raise your hopes, crush them,

190
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,340
and then lift them, and then crush them.

191
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,176
You want me to tell you what that's like?

192
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,596
That's like having your
whole childhood...

193
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,519
Die over and over and over again.

194
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,564
I mean, Nicky, really. No.

195
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,402
I've been waiting a long time
for you to write this play.

196
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,238
I'm really proud of it.

197
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,408
Of course, you were a lot sexier when
you were writing crap.

198
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,179
You didn't like me very much then,
did you?

199
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,204
No, I didn't.

200
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,015
You really don't like me very much now,
do you?

201
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,040
No, I don't.

202
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,500
See you tonight.

203
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,337
Red Sox blow a chance to win
their first world series since 1918.

204
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,051
You expect me to miss that for
an opening night?

205
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,174
I don't think so.

206
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,884
Yeah, I'll be there.

207
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,886
Makes me so mad.

208
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:46,516
Steven schwimmer, the exterminating
angel ready to strike.

209
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,684
It's all worked out.

210
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,103
They lose tonight,
they lose tomorrow night.

211
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,522
I see it with stunning clarity.

212
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,148
It's your best play, Nicky.

213
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,359
It's the most truthful work
you've ever done.

214
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,331
They're gonna lose 'cause they're my team.

215
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,738
He will absolutely hate it.

216
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,490
I'm gonna jump out here.

217
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,467
Elliot?

218
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,303
Nicky, I was thinking about you.

219
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,156
I went to the preview
of the play last night.

220
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,473
I don't wanna know.

221
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,141
A lovely piece of theater.

222
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,393
Small but important.

223
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
Shut up, Elliot.

224
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,062
Quietly effective.

225
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,230
Hey!

226
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,108
You know, we don't appreciate

227
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,442
what they've done for us.

228
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,820
We artists, we're just too dumb to know

229
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,489
that this is the peak of western culture.

230
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,658
You're an artist, I'm a craftsman.

231
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,661
Touch a button, they give us money.

232
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:18,835
Let's take a ride.

233
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,170
Come on, let's get haircuts.

234
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,491
Welcome back.

235
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,175
For Darryl strawberry and the mets,

236
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,553
this has been a season of
highs and lows.

237
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,930
Now, he's a man accustomed...

238
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,018
How's Lillian?
I haven't seen her lately.

239
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,145
- She wants a divorce.
- Oh, don't talk like that.

240
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,481
Yeah, it's over, it's finished, it's done.

241
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,066
Sounds so final.

242
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,277
But are we really surprised?

243
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,571
I'm completely stunned.

244
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,857
I don't want this to happen.

245
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,533
But didn't we know it would happen?

246
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,161
Don't needle me, Elliot.

247
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,662
Tell me how badly you feel.

248
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,181
We're supposed to feel badly together.

249
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,331
That's what friends do.

250
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,169
Joanna bourne, so rich, crisp.

251
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,132
This woman, she lets you touch her body,

252
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,134
put your hands on her personal parts?

253
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,262
I said don't needle me.

254
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,976
No, it's...

255
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,067
We must abandon.

256
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,837
Wha... what do you mean we must abandon?

257
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,621
- Ruptured steam pipe.
- Ruptured steam pipe?

258
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,573
Asbestos lining, do not inhale.

259
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,492
A terminating substance, very dangerous.

260
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,410
- Do not inhale!
- We must abandon!

261
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,786
Ruptured steam pipe!

262
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,210
Very dangerous.

263
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,377
Asbestos lining?

264
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,087
We must abandon.

265
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,589
- Do not inhale.
- Let's go.

266
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,042
I'm trying to remember.

267
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,753
When did you start looking so terrible?
'Cause you look awful.

268
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,463
Oh, I can tell you the year,

269
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,383
the day, the night, the minute.

270
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,593
You used to love life.

271
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,053
You don't exude this anymore.

272
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,347
- Hm? What do I exude?
- Suffering.

273
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,684
You exude a person who sits

274
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:44,146
in a small, dark apartment,
eating soft white bread.

275
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,233
Tonight, you'll see what
it's like to suffer.

276
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,318
Oh yeah, why, what's tonight?

277
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,155
Shit, they don't have the carrot soup.

278
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,866
Oh, you mean because what's-his-name.

279
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,578
You will suffer because
he is in the theater,

280
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,622
and you will suffer a dozen-fold
when that review appears.

281
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,346
- It's just a review.
- It's just a review.

282
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,711
Do not inhale.

283
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,671
Very dangerous.

284
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,340
I don't get it.

285
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,592
What's the fuss?

286
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,345
He reviewed that one act I did

287
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,847
at the fulton fish market.

288
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,142
We did this play at four in the morning,

289
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,519
outdoors, in the rain.

290
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,480
One performance, for fish handlers.

291
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,484
- And he was there?
- Steven schwimmer.

292
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,780
I memorized every line of this review.

293
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,863
That's awful.

294
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,870
I recite it to myself
with masochistic relish.

295
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,997
Yessiree Bob!

296
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,875
Yessiree Bob.

297
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,646
This man, he's just taken over my mind.

298
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,631
I mean, he's out there,
but he's in my head,

299
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,174
and I can't get rid of him.

300
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,551
I can't write one word without imagining

301
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,386
what his response is going to be.

302
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,057
I am paralyzed as an artist.

303
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,686
See, I don't have the problems
you artists have.

304
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,356
You've been saying that for years.

305
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,042
- What?
- "|'m just a professional,

306
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,817
I'm just a dues-paying
member of the guild."

307
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,695
You are afraid, Nicky.

308
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,656
That's the darkest part of you.

309
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,307
You don't think you're good enough.

310
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,748
Hey. You know, maybe.

311
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,501
Hey.
That's mine, don't, stay away.

312
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,925
- That's mine.
- You guys ready to order?

313
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,762
Paisley Porter, I didn't
know you worked here.

314
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,307
- Elliot?
- This is a very talented

315
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,809
young, out-of—work actress.

316
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,727
Elliot litvak?

317
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,145
Have you been ill?

318
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,690
And, Mr. Rogan, how nice.

319
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,525
Hi, how are you, nice to see you.

320
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,235
What's good today?

321
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,820
We have a very nice pasta today.

322
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,987
Alla puttanesca.

323
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,656
Mm. Say it again.

324
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,241
Alla puttanesca.

325
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,784
See, what did I tell you?

326
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,120
She's great, great talent.

327
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,288
Very nice.

328
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,711
Sorry.

329
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,672
I got a real good feeling about tonight.

330
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,417
- We got ojeda going.
- Yeah.

331
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,395
He pitched a beautiful game last time out.

332
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,505
And, plus, Darryl,
he's due for a big game.

333
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,191
- Of course!
- I hate the mets.

334
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,759
How come?

335
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,511
I can't respect them.

336
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,971
'Cause when the mets lose, they just lose.

337
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,932
It's a flat feeling,
there's nothing there.

338
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,770
But the Red Sox, now here
we have a rich history

339
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,524
of really fascinating ways
to lose a crucial game.

340
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,900
You know what I mean?

341
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,028
Defeats that just keep you awake at night.

342
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,284
They pound in your head
like the hammer of fate.

343
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,430
Yeah, you can analyze a Red Sox game

344
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,457
day and night for a month
and still uncover

345
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,253
really complex layers of feelings,

346
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,659
feelings you didn't even know
you were capable of having.

347
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,885
Yeah, that kind of pain
has a memory all of its own.

348
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,813
Six hours to game time,

349
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,232
and the traffic's getting tense.

350
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,694
Maybe you're a Red Sox fan.

351
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,780
You live here among us,
taking our parking spaces,

352
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,408
luring our women into your cars,

353
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,493
but there's a sense of impending ruin.

354
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,831
There's the thing that always
happens because it has to.

355
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,376
Maybe you don't take a medication.

356
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,255
Maybe for what you have,
they didn't develop anything yet.

357
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,216
Lone eagle, up and away.

358
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,763
"Elliot litvak put on his
theater of mediocrity

359
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,016
at the fulton fish market
at dawn the other day,

360
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,686
and the first issue we must raise
is cruelty to fish."

361
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,688
Gets funnier.

362
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,107
It gets funnier, see.
They chart the laughs.

363
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,818
This from a critic who lives
like a fallen monk

364
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,529
whose very address is
a carefully guarded secret.

365
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,573
Critic who has to disguise himself.

366
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,718
- What do you mean?
- To go to the theater.

367
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,161
He wears, I don't know what,
makeup, padding.

368
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,088
- Why?
- Because he's so deeply hated

369
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,915
by so many people in the business.

370
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,791
He has to disguise himself, Nicky.

371
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,960
For his own safety and piece of mind.

372
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,424
You wanna know what it was like

373
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,509
reading that review at the news stand

374
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,261
as trucks rumbled by,

375
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,722
street vendors facing mecca?

376
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,682
What was it like?

377
00:23:55,351 --> 00:24:00,147
I said, "I'm dead, he killed me."

378
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,652
Excuse me.

379
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,898
- Stage.
- Hey, Renee, it's Nick.

380
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,049
Where are you? We need you.

381
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,110
I'm down at George's.
I got stuck in this asbestos...

382
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,553
Listen carefully to the panic in my voice.

383
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,056
Peter redmond.

384
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,141
Get here, Nicky, now.

385
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,188
Nicky, how ya doing?
You look good.

386
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,565
- I'm dying here.
- It suits you.

387
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,335
The new play, it's coming along all right?

388
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,753
To tell you the truth, giorgio, I don't...

389
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,320
Hey, good for you.

390
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,701
"Elliot litvak also writes
the way he looks.

391
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,869
He's grubby and shifty-eyed."

392
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,594
Yes, okay, that's it.

393
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,849
So you worked with Elliot?

394
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,309
I was in the fish market play.

395
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,354
What happened to him?

396
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,023
There was a review.

397
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,733
I think I remember.

398
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,860
So does Elliot.

399
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,362
Not one of Steven's finer moments.

400
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,655
Oh, so you know him?

401
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,906
A little.

402
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,975
He has finer moments now and then?

403
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,704
He has something, a funny little
quality that I find...

404
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,165
- Endearing?
- Engaging.

405
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,545
Elliot wants to kill him with
a railroad spike.

406
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,966
Steven's a complicate guy.

407
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,429
Say it again.

408
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,641
You know what.

409
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,685
Alla puttanesca.

410
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,980
One more time.

411
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,210
I hear really good things
about your new play.

412
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,570
Yeah, yeah, it's good.

413
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,739
It's got a little problem.

414
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,366
Peter redmond's an actor that
I admire enormously.

415
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,327
- Yeah, he's great.
- Yeah.

416
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,539
Wanna meet him?

417
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,559
He doesn't wanna meet some
out of work ingenue.

418
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,584
Sure he does.

419
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,271
I'm serious, I have to go to
the rehearsal right now with Peter.

420
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,546
- Really?
- Really.

421
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,257
Okay, sure.

422
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,926
Where are you going?

423
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,552
I've to go to the...

424
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,923
I have to go to the theater.

425
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,138
Is it safe?

426
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,057
- Is it ever safe?
- What about my haircut?

427
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,683
Claudio's, five o'clock.

428
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,562
I want my hair cut, I want my hair cut.

429
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,050
So is it true?

430
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,218
Is what true?

431
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,594
That he wears a disguise.

432
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,305
He goes to extremes to
protect his privacy.

433
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,391
No phone, no friends.

434
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,351
But you're his friend.

435
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,603
Sort of, sometimes.

436
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,357
He doesn't live the kind of life
you think he does.

437
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,693
He doesn't even have a toilet.

438
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,464
You're not building some kind of obsession

439
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,489
with Steven, are you?

440
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,575
I mean, I understand
opening nightjitters,

441
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,286
but you've got one of the great
American theater actors

442
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,163
starring in your play tonight.

443
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,461
I just can't take it any more.

444
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,464
He forgets simple lines,
he forgets where to stand,

445
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,259
and we tell him, and we tell him,
and we tell him.

446
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,219
I know he's a sweet man.

447
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,762
I love Peter.

448
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,556
I know it's not his fault,

449
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,225
but I have never worked on a show

450
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,103
where the leading man
has a parasite in his brain.

451
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,773
Christ.

452
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,986
Joanna remains optimistic.

453
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:17,905
Joanna?

454
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,656
Joanna bourne, our producer.

455
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,075
I was educated by nuns.

456
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:23,744
Yes.

457
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,662
I have excellent long term memory.

458
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,164
Yes.

459
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:32,002
I kissed Shirley felder on the teeth.

460
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,133
My parasite is consuming
all the new memory.

461
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,052
It's eating my lines.

462
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:41,970
You have to see the words.

463
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,348
Try to build a mental
picture of the script.

464
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,267
Imagine your lines highlighted
by a felt tip pen.

465
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,019
What color?

466
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,946
What was your favorite color
crayon as a kid?

467
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,607
- Burnt Sienna.
- Okay, mine was cobalt blue.

468
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:01,823
Ah, Nicky, this is all
your history, isn't it?

469
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,242
All around us.

470
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,539
My parasite is eating it.

471
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,504
I kissed her while she was laughing.

472
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,842
Oh dear god, my heart
was flying out of my chest with love.

473
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,262
I heard he got the parasite in Burma.

474
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,555
I heard Borneo.

475
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,016
Why do we blame the third world
for our parasites?

476
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,852
Maybe he got it in Denver or Minneapolis.

477
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,480
Maybe he got it in Borneo.

478
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,984
I feel shaky about one line in particular.

479
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,861
I think if I could get this line,

480
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,738
I could handle the last long speech.

481
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,907
- Which line, Peter?
- Huh?

482
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,742
Which line?

483
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,496
The son says to the father,
"this could be it."

484
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,206
And the father replies...

485
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,459
That's the line that I can't... I can't
for the life of me remember.

486
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,670
I just, I can't get it.

487
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,005
It's the same line.

488
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:02,467
The father simply repeats
what the son says to him.

489
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,094
"This could be it."

490
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,096
"This could be it."

491
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,517
I know it sounds easy,

492
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,729
but something happens between the time

493
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,773
that I hear the line and the time

494
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,233
that I'm supposed to repeat it.

495
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,444
"This could be it."

496
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,408
"This could be it."

497
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,413
Let's work on it.

498
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,922
Let's work on it.

499
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,382
Oh, boy.

500
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,655
I think what would be really good here

501
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,348
is if we just start from the top.

502
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,034
Do you think he can do it?

503
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,476
I don't know.

504
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,977
He's a very sweet man.

505
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,479
Yes, he is.

506
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,646
I gotta go.

507
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,940
So where you going now?

508
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,275
Home.

509
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,152
Is there someone waiting for you there?

510
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,529
No one's waiting for me there.

511
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,492
You know, there's a certain kind
of wounded young man

512
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,745
who uses his oddness to get laid.

513
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:12,913
Is that our Steven?

514
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,956
If I'm sleeping with him,

515
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,803
and I haven't said that I am,
then so what?

516
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,960
So what?
So, you know, everything.

517
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,546
So I start to think crazy things.

518
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,840
You wanna talk about crazy things?

519
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,008
Yes.

520
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,094
Never mind.

521
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,013
Wait, Paisley, come on.

522
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,808
Steven not only wears disguises,

523
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,519
he goes to the theater armed.

524
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,246
"This could be it."

525
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,623
"This could be it."

526
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,148
"This could be it."

527
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,402
- "This could be it."
- "This could be it."

528
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,404
"This could be it."

529
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,518
Steven?

530
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,811
Steven, open up.

531
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,147
Steven, open up.

532
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,399
It's me.

533
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,739
You've come to me.

534
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,824
I wanted to believe you would one day.

535
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,035
I haven't come to you.

536
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,840
I didn't understand until
today how much pain

537
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,251
and anxiety you've been causing
everyone with your reviews.

538
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,086
Steven, it's completely unfair.

539
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,338
- It's unfair?
- Yes.

540
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:28,882
The truth is always unfair.

541
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,217
Well, it doesn't have to be.

542
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,703
Why do you think I live this way?

543
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,945
Why do you think I'm taking electricity

544
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,449
- from a lamp post and hiding out, why?
- Because you choose to.

545
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,600
No, because people who write the truth

546
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,227
are the outcasts of society.

547
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:41,853
I can't live openly.

548
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,939
I can't live in a nice doorman building

549
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,524
with my name on the mailbox

550
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,170
'cause they'd come after me in packs.

551
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,152
Not if you wrote the truth gently.

552
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,780
But the truth is never gentle.

553
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,784
Listen to me carefully.

554
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,036
Each of us lives

555
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:02,415
in the thinnest possible wrapping
of wishes and dreams,

556
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,254
and truth is the force that
penetrates this wispy skin.

557
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,589
It hurts and it maims.

558
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,675
- Yeah.
- That's my job, and, look,

559
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,302
they hate me,
they hate me for writing the truth!

560
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,054
I have seen your victims, okay?

561
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,740
And that's why I thought I might be able

562
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,766
to come here and convince
you to reconsider.

563
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:26,439
And I thought, at last, she's here.

564
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,817
She wants me.

565
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,151
I don't want you, Steven.

566
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,153
Stay, stay, please.

567
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,697
Teach me how to be compassionate.

568
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,490
I'm going home to my machine.

569
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,299
Oh, hey, hi!

570
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,467
Oh. I... I'm just...

571
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,477
Sorry.

572
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,820
Taxi!

573
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,201
Laurel!

574
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,212
Laurel.

575
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,381
Excuse me, hey.

576
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,401
All the tickets are set, I double checked.

577
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,985
Oh, thanks, daddy, but I only need one.

578
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,345
Mother's not going.

579
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,013
- It's opening night.
- I know.

580
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,390
Why should a bitter divorce
interfere with tradition?

581
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,850
Rogan, Laurel.

582
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,137
There's also rogan, Lillian.

583
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,478
She doesn't need it, sell it.

584
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,664
Well, you take it, get a date,
take a date.

585
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,107
I... I don't have a date,
and I don't want a date.

586
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,278
And you blame me,
and it is 'cause we never talk,

587
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,653
so let's talk.

588
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,030
I can't, I have class, I'm late.

589
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,531
Okay, okay, so let's talk later.

590
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,450
- You gonna go to the party?
- I'm not sure.

591
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,495
Okay, so I'm gonna find you somewhere

592
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,954
after the show, okay?

593
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,290
Somewhere!

594
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,458
Okay!

595
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,503
Taxi!

596
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,403
Mets are ahead
three games to two, with two games left

597
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,179
with our best man out on the hill

598
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,056
with five days' rest going against

599
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,557
their man with three days' rest.

600
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,975
I mean, we should win.

601
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,687
A man is hit the other day
by another taxi.

602
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,146
I mean, he's flying.

603
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,440
Crashes right against my windscreen,

604
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,942
right in front of my eyes.

605
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,985
Blood is everywhere.

606
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,072
I never left the garage without my windex.

607
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,865
I was a barrister in Kenya.

608
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,202
So I said to him,
you have to get up from here.

609
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,705
I cannot drive with your body
on my windscreen.

610
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,708
I drove straight through 12 hours a day.

611
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,794
I just, you know, ate while I drove.

612
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,561
You've got to eat at the wheel.

613
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,089
You cannot get.

614
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,608
Well, that's the drama, isn't it?

615
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,009
I mean, we're waiting for
life to continue.

616
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,471
Ibrhim, where do you pee?

617
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,848
Under the Manhattan bridge.

618
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,183
That's where I peed!

619
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,350
That's where I peed.

620
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,607
Who is it?

621
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:57,984
I'm at the door.

622
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,069
Go away, I'll the cops!

623
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,446
Pop, will you let me in?

624
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,656
Where the hell are you?

625
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,117
I'm right here, I'm at the door.

626
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,245
What do you want?

627
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,497
It's me, Nicky!

628
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,081
Nicky comes on sundays.

629
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,541
Aw, gee, where are your gla...

630
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,211
Go... go get your glasses,
find your glasses.

631
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,463
If it's you, what are you doing here?

632
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,215
I'm on my way to get a haircut.

633
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,884
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?

634
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,094
Jesus chri... across ninth Avenue.

635
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,888
Same place you go to get your hair cut

636
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,097
for the last 50 years.

637
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,350
Same place uncle Billy and uncle Marty

638
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,851
go to get their haircuts,

639
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,896
same place Jim rorety shot a guy
for cheating at poker.

640
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,607
It was rummy, not poker!

641
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,819
I'll take a chance and let you in.

642
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,156
Jesus.

643
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,371
It's a constant shock to me
how small this place is.

644
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,708
How did we do it, pop?
Five people in these little rooms.

645
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,127
Fix yourself something to eat.

646
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,448
You must have been heroic.

647
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,550
Five's not so many.

648
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,718
There were families with seven kids,

649
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,638
a grandmother, a dimwit uncle.

650
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,558
Yeah, Lillian says to me once a week,

651
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,285
"why doesn't he just come live with us?"

652
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,978
You know the answer to that.

653
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,437
I do know the answer to that.

654
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,244
Hey, pop, let's go watch the game tonight.

655
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,525
Go down to Manny's.

656
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,402
They're only gonna lose.

657
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,820
Of course they're gonna lose.

658
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,227
We'll watch them lose together.

659
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,907
What good is heartbreak
if you can't experience it firsthand?

660
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,576
The Red Sox are your problem.

661
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,245
I've never understood
your thing with the Red Sox.

662
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,831
Everybody rooted for the Yankees.

663
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,128
1949, last two games of the season

664
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,754
were against the Yankees.

665
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,048
First, the Red Sox lose Saturday,

666
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,425
then they lose Sunday.

667
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,886
I cry for 24 hours.

668
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,930
Then I get in fistfights for
the rest of the week.

669
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,599
That's one thing for kids.

670
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,893
You get older, you got other things.

671
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,728
I could've been happy.

672
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,303
I could've been a Yankees fan.

673
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,264
Could've been a divorce lawyer.

674
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,529
Here, take these.

675
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,258
You're gonna need those for the play.

676
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,743
No, don't make me sit through
one of your plays.

677
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,077
You know what, pop?

678
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,332
I know you hate the commotion
of opening night.

679
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:23,087
This means a lot to me, okay?

680
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,466
It's new territory for me.

681
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,052
I really wanna know what you think.

682
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,887
Since when did that matter?

683
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,680
Do we have to talk about that?

684
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,223
My back is killing me.

685
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,850
Where's your elastic brace?

686
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,101
I can't find it.

687
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,519
You gotta wear the brace.

688
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,563
I lost it, I lose everything.

689
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,565
All right, you know what?

690
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,026
I'll go get you another one.

691
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,737
You have to wear the brace, all right?

692
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,408
Hey, take a good look at this face.

693
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,581
So I know who I'm letting in.

694
00:40:58,748 --> 00:40:59,749
Exactly.

695
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,178
Two hours to game time.

696
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,348
Never mind the traffic.
We 're not interested in that.

697
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,016
We 're interested in history.

698
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,436
Lost games, lost dreams.

699
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,523
Possible side effects of this medication?

700
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,694
If your erections seem to speak
to you in broken English,

701
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,738
if you develop bodily marks
that correspond

702
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,324
to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus.

703
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,411
Maybe you don't take a medication,

704
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,371
but you get the side effects anyway.

705
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,005
This is lone eagle, in your face
and out of your life.

706
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,180
"Why doesn't he come live with us?"

707
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,017
Because everything is here.

708
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,352
I know, pop.

709
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,521
I'm lucky they don't
knock the building down.

710
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,189
It could happen any time.

711
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,735
Everything worth
remembering is right here.

712
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,653
I think the building's okay,

713
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,155
at least for the time being.

714
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,824
You didn't think it was okay
when you lived here.

715
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,076
You wanted to get out so fast,

716
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,096
I thought you were running a marathon.

717
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,164
A normal boy's ambitions.

718
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,124
I like coming back, you know that.

719
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:28,337
You'd tell your friends your father
used to work the docks, calloused hands,

720
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,215
but you had an attitude
when you were growing up.

721
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,509
Wasn't easy for your mother
and me to understand.

722
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,887
I was in a hurry to do big things,

723
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,180
make big mistakes.

724
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,557
Any mistake was okay
as long as it was big.

725
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,269
Hey, pop,

726
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,774
they're getting ready
to kill my play, starting tonight.

727
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,151
There's a guy out there
who's gonna rip it apart.

728
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,530
It's about us, who we are,
where we come from.

729
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:59,535
So, what are you gonna do about it?

730
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,539
What should I do about it?

731
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,501
Show him who we are.

732
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,759
He carries a gun.

733
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,261
Then you should carry a gun.

734
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,434
Yeah, I used to carry a gun
when I drove a cab.

735
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,973
- Where is it?
- I gave it away.

736
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,392
I figured, I'm a writer now.

737
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,726
That was a big mistake.

738
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,937
You should always carry a gun.
In this city?

739
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,273
If he carries a gun,
you have to carry a gun.

740
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,316
I'm not a lonely, spooky writer like you,

741
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,943
nursing 100 grudges.

742
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,486
I'm a man who loves life.

743
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,030
I'm talking about something
deeper than grudges.

744
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,967
How do you respond to personal attack?

745
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,493
In this city, and you don't carry a gun?

746
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,370
This is your best play, Nicky.

747
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,621
He'll hate it then.

748
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,373
He'll kill it.

749
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,042
He'll write a review so devastating

750
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,752
it will shatter your career.

751
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:35,423
It will cause the most
unmanageable psychic grief.

752
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,218
What about your apartment
in east river, hmm?

753
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,805
Your home in Connecticut,
where you watch things grow?

754
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,600
Yeah, we were thinking of
putting in a pool, too.

755
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,435
You know...

756
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,615
"Elliot litvak is a one-man cult
of the tragically third rate."

757
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,070
I'm telling you as a friend.

758
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,453
- What?
- There are things

759
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,121
that speak to us from the past.

760
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,968
In this city, you don't walk out your door

761
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,084
five feet, and there's somebody
ready to take what's yours.

762
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,253
Your truth is locked up in the past.

763
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,591
Find it, know it for what it is.

764
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,135
Shoot him, Nicky.

765
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,722
Shoot him?

766
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,889
The American theater doesn't
need people like that.

767
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,604
"Shoot him, Nicky."

768
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,115
Hey, I know you know we're just talking,

769
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,119
but where does he live?

770
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,746
47th and the river.

771
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,623
I followed our friend Paisley there.

772
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,834
How do you like your sideburns?

773
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,420
Elegant and refined.

774
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,958
Hi, everybody, I'm vin Scully,

775
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,275
and welcome to game six.

776
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,944
The last time the Boston Red Sox
won a world series,

777
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,231
the doughboys were dug in...

778
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,039
I'm looking at you,
trying to think,

779
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,991
put your face in the mirror.

780
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,495
I know I recognize you from somewhere.

781
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:53,913
Oh yeah?

782
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:58,250
You are Frankie lazarro,
the gangster from Rhode Island.

783
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,502
Matthew, look at him.

784
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:01,962
When I lived in roxbury,
the media followed

785
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,589
this man everywhere.

786
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:06,175
He was bigger than 10 movie stars.

787
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,387
Where's your white Lincoln limo,
Mr. Lazarro?

788
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,430
Some kid stole my hubcaps.

789
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,933
The most charming gangster in new england.

790
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,540
So why do you have the kid with you?

791
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:16,883
Matthew's my grandson.

792
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,604
Oh, you're a grandmother?
God bless you.

793
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,357
Yes, he does bless me each and every day.

794
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,668
Matthew's mother works the night shift

795
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,569
at the hospital, so I pick
him up from school.

796
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,447
- Oh yeah?
- We have a meal usually around this time,

797
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,550
and he gets experience meeting people.

798
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,785
But we've never had
a famous mobster before.

799
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:33,953
Nope.

800
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,287
Today's your lucky day, kid.

801
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,833
This is one charming crook,

802
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,709
if shooting people is charming.

803
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,962
Ah, well, now that's
a complicated subject.

804
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,369
It's a simple subject.

805
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,882
So, where we going tonight, Mr. Lazarro?

806
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,445
So, is this where you wanna be, Frankie?

807
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,739
Is this where I wanna be?

808
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,910
It's dinnertime for you,
it's game time for me.

809
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,596
Let's get out of here and go to Manny's.

810
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,998
What do you say, Matthew?
Drink some beer and talk baseball.

811
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,750
- Cool.
- All right, let's go.

812
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:34,805
An unexpected guest
at shea stadium.

813
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,874
What happens if somebody comes in here

814
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,065
right now and shoots you?

815
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,484
This place becomes famous.

816
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,611
Tour buses, blind people feeling their way

817
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,529
around the walls looking for bullet holes.

818
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,007
You see what you're doing, don't you?

819
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,200
- What am I doing?
- You're charming the boy.

820
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,285
Hey, Toyota, he asked me a question.

821
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,703
Frankie lazarro coming down

822
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,371
the courthouse steps in the media.

823
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,178
Children see this, they think
you're the secretary of the treasury.

824
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,959
No, that's my cousin Angelo.

825
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,755
- Ahh...
- "This could be it."

826
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,174
"This could be it."

827
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,051
"This could be it.“

828
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,303
"this could be it."

829
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,804
"This could be it."

830
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,600
"This could be it."

831
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,101
Does that feel comfortable?

832
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,604
Does what feel comfortable?

833
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:26,148
"This could be it."

834
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,486
"This could be it."

835
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,207
Ooh, food, thank you.

836
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,125
What's it like to shoot somebody?

837
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,378
I respect a kid who does
his homework in a taxicab,

838
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,980
but I'm trying to watch a ballgame here.

839
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,549
Oh, go on, tell him, tell him the truth.

840
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,360
Tell him how you feel about shooting

841
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,219
a piece of hot metal into somebody's flesh

842
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,762
who was once a child,

843
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,847
who was once the same age as this boy,

844
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,684
somebody whose flesh was innocent once.

845
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,228
What is that?
It's a strike, come on!

846
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,981
It's complicated.
I mean, it's a whole life, isn't it?

847
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,900
A person doesn't just commit
a violent act out of nowhere.

848
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,944
There are strong forces at work.

849
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,922
There goes your boy.

850
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,657
High drive up the alley
in left center field.

851
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,077
Dykstra heading for the wall...

852
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,370
Dykstra plays it.

853
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,039
One run will score on a double by Evans,

854
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,333
and rice holds at third.

855
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,876
We got a ballgame here.

856
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,505
So Dwight Evans
hits the left center field wall

857
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,216
for a long double and a run batted in,

858
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:35,884
and with first base open,

859
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,387
it's the left hand-hitting rich gedman
coming up.

860
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:43,517
The ball is well hit, but played
perfectly by dykstra.

861
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,519
He gets the...

862
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:48,314
Hits the cutoff man...

863
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,190
Rice at third.

864
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,610
So for the mets, who on...

865
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,612
You a family man, Frankie?

866
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:56,864
Wife and daughter.

867
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,282
My father's still alive.

868
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,201
And how many years does it take a person

869
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,371
to make sure his family's safe
and secure and happy,

870
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,041
and then one dumb moment, what does he do?

871
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,186
I don't know, Toyota, what does he do?

872
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,771
And the people he hurts the most
are the ones who love him,

873
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,839
despite who he is or
what he does for a living.

874
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,800
We always say we wanna
take control of our lives.

875
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,387
You don't wanna take control,
you wanna lose control.

876
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:21,805
Jesus knows it.

877
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:31,440
Yeah, well, that's a complicated subject.

878
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,651
That's a simple subject.

879
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,863
Excuse me.

880
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,162
Your father said you might be here.

881
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,682
Hey, we're up by two in the fourth.

882
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,026
I've been looking for you because

883
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,227
I want to let you know
what's been going on

884
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,438
so you don't have to read about it
in the gossip column.

885
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,673
We've stranded five runners
in the first two innings.

886
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,439
Boy, that's gonna come back to haunt us.

887
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,051
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.

888
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,969
All right, all right.

889
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,554
Okay, what's going on?

890
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,516
I've been talking to
a prominent divorce lawyer.

891
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,851
How prominent?

892
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:10,771
He has his own submarine.

893
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,792
I'll be getting everything that matters.

894
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,651
I'll get New York, I'll get Connecticut.

895
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,696
Uh, I'll just have whatever she's having.

896
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,240
I don't wanna be responsible for his food.

897
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,927
I'll have a green salad and a Perrier.

898
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:28,122
Gimme, uh, gimme the bay scallops
with Mercury poisoning.

899
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:31,583
Yessiree Bob.

900
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,971
Breaking ball...

901
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,974
Opening night, Lillian?

902
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,434
Who the hell cares?

903
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,812
You know what?
This whole thing has been my fault.

904
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,230
I've taken unfair advantage

905
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,190
of your Patience and your understanding.

906
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,358
You understand me.

907
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,444
That's always been my problem.

908
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,988
And you've been extremely patient.

909
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,156
You know why, don't you?

910
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,283
Because I am patient,
chain-smoking Lillian.

911
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,826
You smoke because I smoke.

912
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,871
Hey, we were falling in love, remember?

913
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,183
I would go see certain movies
because you had seen them.

914
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,625
I wanted to see what you saw.

915
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,687
- I'd forgotten that.
- Yeah, I went because you went.

916
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,171
You smoke 'cause I smoked.

917
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,840
It's very lovely, actually.

918
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,134
Hey, Laurel wants us to be

919
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,781
more open and honest with each other.

920
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,888
Be open with me. I'd like that.

921
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,639
All right, now, I might say some things

922
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,892
that, you know, you might not
really wanna know.

923
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,394
I wanna know.
We haven't talked like this in years.

924
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,229
Okay.

925
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,775
I had an affair.

926
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,101
You sure you wanna hear this?

927
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,361
- Joanna bourne?
- Alma wetzel.

928
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,906
Nicky, no, that's insupportable.

929
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,240
How could you do that?

930
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,994
Well, I'm a man, and she's,
you know, a woman.

931
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,079
She's my gynecologist.

932
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,874
I'm really deeply sorry, I am.

933
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,918
That violates so many trusts.

934
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,587
I... it wasn't, you know, it wasn't...
There was no intimacy.

935
00:54:58,754 --> 00:54:59,880
It was an animal thing.

936
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,925
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel
as having sex outside the office.

937
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:06,261
Well, uh, we had it in the office.

938
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,807
- Huh?
- She... I... she didn't wanna have it

939
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,373
in her apartment. She thought it was
too impersonal, I guess.

940
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,728
Okay.

941
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,023
I'm... I'm glad we've had this talk.

942
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,240
Hey, I love you.

943
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,075
Rice goes!

944
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,952
Sinker is hit down to second and...

945
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,578
Here, let me get you a cab.

946
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,831
Safe at second, out at first.

947
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,916
You look awful.

948
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,668
Get a haircut.

949
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,419
And get a lawyer.

950
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,760
To show you how long ago it was

951
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:49,012
when the Red Sox won a world series,

952
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:52,391
look at what it cost to buy things.

953
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,353
The last time the Red Sox
won the world series,

954
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,107
1918, congress enacted legislation...

955
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,777
Great game, Red Sox are winning.

956
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,822
Red Sox are always winning till they lose.

957
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,117
Your problem is, you wanna
take the easy way out.

958
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,660
Losing is easy.

959
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:14,496
No, winning is easy, losing's complicated.

960
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,164
Losing's a lifetime's work.

961
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,332
Clemens has a blister.

962
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,042
Look, they're pinch-hitting for him.

963
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,711
Roger goes seven innings,

964
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,796
and goes out winning three-two,

965
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,443
but right now, here's Mike greenwell.

966
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,009
24-game winner,
pitches seven solid innings.

967
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,969
We scratch out a one-run lead.

968
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,679
Of course he gets a blister.

969
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,517
Sure, of course you put greenwell up

970
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,686
when you've got baylor
sitting on the bench.

971
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,261
Of course greenwell strikes out.

972
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,775
Goddamn it!

973
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,694
You made him strike out.

974
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,154
You wished it on him.

975
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,655
You wanna lose.

976
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,866
It's too hard for you to
believe in something.

977
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,743
It's hard to have faith.

978
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,578
It's hard work to trust somebody.

979
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,873
It looked extremely rocky
for the Boston nine that day.

980
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,167
You're afraid to risk believing.

981
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,501
Believe in them.

982
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,086
Believe in yourself.

983
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,088
Take a risk.
It'll humanize you as a person.

984
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,175
You think I don't wanna believe?
I wanna believe.

985
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,985
If you believed, you wouldn't
be walking around

986
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,385
with a handgun in your belt.

987
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,596
What does that tell me?

988
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,432
You wanna make the night come down.

989
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:19,269
Three-two Red Sox,
top of the eighth, two out.

990
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,790
I always thought a night's sleep

991
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,524
was what you get for a hard day's work.

992
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,444
These last weeks, I lie there, helpless,

993
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:28,779
hour after hour.

994
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,990
Come close to praying for the first time

995
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,325
since I was your age.

996
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,496
Pray to god, put me out.

997
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,581
I talked to the doctor again, pop.

998
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:42,376
He said she's not getting any better.

999
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:44,795
How bad is she?

1000
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,964
This could be it.

1001
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:24,960
Three and oh.

1002
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:29,506
Swung on and lined to left,

1003
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,841
right at rice.

1004
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,719
Tagging up is mazzilli to score.

1005
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:37,097
Down to third goes dykstra.

1006
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,433
Let's go mets, let's go mets,

1007
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,352
- let's go mets!
- It's a brand new ballgame.

1008
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:50,068
With Howard Johnson staying
in the game at shortstop,

1009
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,112
Dave Henderson will lead it off.

1010
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:55,782
Now, it's three-three in the tenth.

1011
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,494
Henderson has flied to left,
flied to center,

1012
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,247
grounded to short, and singled to short

1013
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,534
on a bad hop that struck
Kevin elsner on the left arm.

1014
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,126
Say it and you'll believe it.

1015
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,294
Life is good.

1016
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:08,837
Say it.

1017
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,506
Look, I really want to say it

1018
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,717
because, quite frankly, my whole life

1019
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,427
may depend on these next few moments.

1020
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,970
Then say it.

1021
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,223
Life is good.

1022
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,808
Speak it like it's real.

1023
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,101
Matthew.

1024
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,269
Life is good.

1025
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,854
Life is good.

1026
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,522
And what are people?

1027
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,940
I don't know.

1028
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,193
- Matthew?
- People are dependable.

1029
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,641
I don't know if I can say that.

1030
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,196
People are dependable.

1031
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:35,822
People are dependable.

1032
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:40,952
Let's see what Henderson does.

1033
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,664
And a drive to left.

1034
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,833
Going back on it is mookie Wilson,

1035
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,127
- and this one is gone.
- Yes!

1036
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,838
Henderson has done it again.

1037
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,635
And another, Rick Aguilera.

1038
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,180
- Yes!
- People are dependable.

1039
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,473
Life is good.

1040
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,850
Baseball is life.

1041
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,414
Enjoy your ice cream, Matthew.

1042
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,374
Because when you're an old man,
it's all gonna come back to you,

1043
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:14,653
that same deep, sweet, soft, toothy taste.

1044
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,300
You're gonna remember where you were,

1045
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,406
and you're gonna remember
exactly what you saw.

1046
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,368
And it is four to three, Red Sox,

1047
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,580
on the lightning-like home run
of Dave Henderson.

1048
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,292
He knew when he touched it off,

1049
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,812
and what a difference in the swing

1050
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:33,839
between this one on Aguilera and ojeda.

1051
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,678
A strike to spike Owen,
who's three for three.

1052
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,473
And it's hit into center, base hit.

1053
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,309
Still charging, here comes boggs.

1054
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,395
He will score.

1055
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:52,065
Backed up by Aguilera,
and Barrett goes to second.

1056
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,443
And it is five to three, Red Sox.

1057
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,404
And what a big run that was.

1058
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:00,824
This is something
no one has had the privilege

1059
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,034
to see in 70 years.

1060
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,246
There are very few people alive today

1061
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,166
who can say they've seen

1062
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,042
what you're about to see, Matthew.

1063
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,423
Boston Red Sox win the world series.

1064
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,722
This is deeply and intensely personal.

1065
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,976
All the mistakes I've made,
all of the fear,

1066
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:31,354
all of the envy, all of the violence,

1067
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,109
encased in this little
envelope we call the body,

1068
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:40,030
washed away in the next few minutes.

1069
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,123
Your grandmother knows
what I'm talking about.

1070
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,660
Because god loves a winner.

1071
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,454
Oh yeah.

1072
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,247
He used to love losers,

1073
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,042
but the laws of physics changed.

1074
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:57,088
Calvin schiraldi, trying to finish off

1075
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,300
the mets and the 1986 baseball season.

1076
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,427
Oh and two to Wally backman.

1077
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,347
Little poke job to left, rice got over.

1078
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,892
Backman flies to right.

1079
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,477
That's like a beautiful song lyric.

1080
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,854
J“ backman flies to right j“

1081
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,356
there you go.

1082
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,192
And that's hit to dead center,

1083
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,236
with Henderson gonna run it down.

1084
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,657
And the mets are down to their last out.

1085
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,826
All the times I died when they lost

1086
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,471
an important game they should've won.

1087
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,746
All the horrible things I said

1088
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,832
to my mother and father about
life in the gutter.

1089
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,501
Washed away.

1090
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,669
'Cause life is good.

1091
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,235
Because faith is rewarded.

1092
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,380
Washed away.

1093
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,133
One more out, one more.

1094
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,302
Roger clemens hoping for that last out.

1095
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,305
One more.

1096
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,183
Lined into left field.

1097
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,061
Base hit for Carter,
and the mets are still alive.

1098
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,111
Curve ball, and that's gonna
be hit to center field.

1099
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,199
Two out in the tenth inning,

1100
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,201
the tying runs are aboard.

1101
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:09,786
It's all right, Frankie.

1102
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,955
It's just a little touch of suspense.

1103
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,248
Life is good.

1104
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,666
Baseball is life.

1105
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,462
One nubber, pop-up, anything.

1106
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,715
All yearlong, thousands of outs.

1107
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,801
Come on, give me one more, come on.

1108
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,555
And that's gonna be hit to center field.

1109
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,520
Here comes Carter to score,

1110
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:38,982
and the tying run is at third
in Kevin Mitchell.

1111
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,487
Don't worry, it's a test.

1112
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,364
He's also going to the bullpen.

1113
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:47,907
He wants Bob Stanley...

1114
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,428
- It's a test, all right.
- Pitch to mookie Wilson.

1115
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:51,703
They're bringing in Stanley.

1116
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,288
39 times they've...

1117
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,707
- It's Stanley!
- From behind to win.

1118
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,667
It's the steamer.

1119
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,755
Fate has spoken to this man
in the depths of the night.

1120
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,173
What did it say?

1121
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,425
A thousand sinister things.

1122
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:09,137
The tying run 90 feet away
in Kevin Mitchell,

1123
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,932
and the possible winning run
at first in ray knight.

1124
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,061
Mookie, mookie, mookie, mookie.

1125
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,479
You're hurting my head.

1126
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,314
Mookie, mookie, mookie.

1127
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:21,481
- Sorry.
- Mookie, mookie, mookie,

1128
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,735
- mookie, mookie, mookie.
- And here's mookie.

1129
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,502
Mookie, mookie, mookie.

1130
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,946
Fouled off.

1131
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,205
- Yes!
- Away, two and two.

1132
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,249
And now with the mets down to
their last strike,

1133
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:43,797
this could be it.

1134
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,633
Kevin Mitchell at third, two and two

1135
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,593
- to mookie Wilson.
- This could be it.

1136
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,973
- This could be it.
- 55,078 here at shea,

1137
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,142
and they have really been
put through the wringer.

1138
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,685
This could be it.

1139
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,609
Here comes Mitchell
to score the tying run!

1140
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,740
It's all right, it's a tie game.

1141
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,450
We can still win in the next inning.

1142
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,911
Mookie, mookie, mookie, mookie, mookie.

1143
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,540
This is the time, trust in people,
believe in life.

1144
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:22,127
Faith is hard work, don't give in,
don't give up!

1145
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,294
Life is true.

1146
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,921
Life is real.

1147
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,631
Trust your team!

1148
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,844
Little roller along first.

1149
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,568
- Great game.
- Unbelievable.

1150
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,570
- Classic.
- Scintillating.

1151
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,238
I still don't believe it.

1152
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,407
Yeah, well, I better hurry back.

1153
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,284
Hurry back, hurry back for what?

1154
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,906
Eleventh inning, what else?

1155
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,305
I think you're a little confused.

1156
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,455
Nothing personal, friend.

1157
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:41,702
What are you talking about?

1158
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:42,999
What are we talking about?

1159
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,834
Yeah, what are you implying?

1160
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,045
Game six is history, pal.

1161
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:49,958
You're not making any sense.

1162
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:51,299
We're not making any sense?

1163
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:52,693
Did you see mookie hit the ball?

1164
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,236
Yeah, of course I saw mookie hit the ball.

1165
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,620
Did you see the winning run score?

1166
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,055
You're not making any sense.

1167
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,348
Make some fucking sense.

1168
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,618
What are you implying?
You're implying something,

1169
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,077
that I missed something.
What did I miss?

1170
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,229
You missed the boat,
popeye the sailor man.

1171
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,981
Oh really? You bluto motherfucker.

1172
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,445
Hold him while I zip up.

1173
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,990
Baseball is life.

1174
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:17,867
Life is good.

1175
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,222
The winning run is at second base

1176
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,850
with two out, three and two
to mookie Wilson.

1177
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,232
Little roller up along first,
behind the bag!

1178
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,276
It gets through Buckner!

1179
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,778
Here comes knight, and the mets win it!

1180
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,874
He 'ii absolutely hate it.

1181
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,793
Show him who we are.

1182
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,171
Show him who we are.

1183
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:57,925
Shoot him, Nicky.

1184
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,054
Shoot him, Nicky.

1185
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,682
The American theater doesn't
need people like that.

1186
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,624
Why won't you tell me your name?

1187
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,568
It's only our first date.

1188
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,087
I'm willing to tell you my name.

1189
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,089
I know, but names are incredibly intimate.

1190
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,535
We... we barely know each other.

1191
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,841
Trust me on this one.

1192
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:46,307
You have to tell me what
you thought of the play.

1193
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,645
Well, first, you tell me.

1194
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:54,607
Really, really moving.

1195
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,026
What else?

1196
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:01,531
- Packs an emotional wallop.
- Mm-hmm.

1197
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,616
What else?

1198
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,243
Flat out hit.

1199
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,870
Come on, you majoring in
theater criticism?

1200
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,498
Criminology.

1201
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,425
Oh, if you're wondering
about that firearm.

1202
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,093
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

1203
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,095
It's just that the building is...

1204
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,264
Not secure.

1205
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,268
Goes way back.

1206
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,563
Pesky whirling a throw,
slaughter racing for home.

1207
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,541
I was barely a boy yet,
four or five years old.

1208
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,817
Something like that,
but I remember it very clearly.

1209
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,838
World series,
game seven, pesky whirling a throw.

1210
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,280
Pesky hesitates.

1211
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,408
Slaughter racing home.

1212
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,080
Why won't you just tell me your name?

1213
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,583
Like, what's shocking about a name?

1214
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,042
We are strangers in the night.

1215
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,462
The last thing we want is honesty.

1216
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,716
40 years, it's almost to the date.

1217
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,135
Pesky was just getting ready to throw.

1218
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,180
October 15th, 1946.

1219
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:11,642
Indelibly marked on the little
reptile part of my brain.

1220
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:13,936
Slaughter racing home.

1221
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,106
What?

1222
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,402
I... I have this thing where I feel

1223
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,655
like I need to know that someone

1224
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,658
is being truthful with me before,
you know, I can...

1225
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:32,997
Even if the truth requires
a certain adjustment?

1226
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,013
His real name wasn't even pesky.
It was paveskovich.

1227
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,714
If he would've kept that name,

1228
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:52,141
it would have never even happened.

1229
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,523
He'd've done something different
with his life, something in yugoslavia,

1230
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,855
and all of our lives would be different.

1231
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,150
Nine months in the womb,
four years on the earth.

1232
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,628
Pesky whirling the throw.

1233
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:06,113
Pesky looking into
the brooding drama of fate.

1234
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,243
And he hesitates.

1235
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:13,996
He hesitates.

1236
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,625
Like fucking Hamlet.

1237
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:36,018
Steven schwimmer!

1238
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,525
Laurel?

1239
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,989
That's my daughter!

1240
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:49,566
I don't think he knew, daddy.

1241
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,702
I'm sorry, I had no idea who he was,
once I saw his face...

1242
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,469
Am I really so deeply repugnant?

1243
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,997
- Yes!
- Go home, Laurel.

1244
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,456
Tell your mom I'm gonna be late.

1245
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,166
You are so dead.

1246
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,376
You're so fucking dead!

1247
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,628
Dad, stop!

1248
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,590
Honey, I'm so sorry you keep running
into dishonest men.

1249
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,401
You're 18, there's time to turn it around.

1250
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,319
Yeah, except I'm not gonna
have a father anymore.

1251
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:10,386
I'll see you all the time.

1252
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,014
I'm gonna get a place nearby,
one room, no distractions.

1253
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,432
We'll talk.

1254
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,726
You're so fucking dead!

1255
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,394
Yeah, well, what...

1256
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,705
What are we gonna talk about?

1257
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:20,769
Everything.

1258
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:21,898
Dad, stop it!

1259
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,609
I'm not gonna believe you
when you say something to me.

1260
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,987
I got nothing left to lie about.

1261
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:34,201
Stevie schwimmer.

1262
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,442
You're dead.

1263
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:12,323
I see your body on a morgue slab,
drained of all fluids.

1264
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,410
You're dead.

1265
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,703
Daddy, wait.

1266
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:19,497
Then they lost.

1267
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:20,957
What's the matter?

1268
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,043
Well, if they lost tonight,
they'll lose tomorrow.

1269
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,211
It's all over.

1270
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,380
What do you care?

1271
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,423
They're my team.

1272
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:34,095
No, no, that's not your team.

1273
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,098
That's my team.

1274
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:38,599
They're my team, too.

1275
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:42,603
I grew up on boylston street,
right by Fenway park.

1276
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:46,023
I went to 50 or 60 games a year,
all by myself.

1277
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,335
One of those kids who was scabby,
always called out to the players,

1278
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:51,320
"look over here, hi, I'm Steven,
my parents are divorced."

1279
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,656
I went to school in Boston,

1280
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,534
just so I'd be near the sox.

1281
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:59,829
Yeah. My wife's from Boston,
Lillian ziegler.

1282
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,165
Red Sox are my world.

1283
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,349
I surrounded my existence to a team
that couldn't win the big one.

1284
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:08,921
If you're such a devoted fan,

1285
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,732
why didn't you go to the game tonight?

1286
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,109
You could've gone to
the theater last night.

1287
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:13,276
There was no game last night.

1288
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,136
I know, I can't bear to watch.

1289
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,680
When they lose, I die inside.

1290
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,017
It's like some person named little Stevie

1291
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,853
just crumples up and dies,
so I wait for the scores.

1292
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,730
I mean, I die hearing the scores,

1293
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,290
but, you know, it's over in a second.

1294
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:30,026
I can't survive the game pitch-by-pitch,
inning-by-inning.

1295
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,318
I've done it too many times.

1296
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,237
I can't fucking do it anymore.

1297
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,657
Pity and terror.

1298
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,242
Pesky whirling the throw.

1299
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:39,744
Yeah, right.

1300
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,079
You weren't even born yet.

1301
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,486
You weren't even remotely born.

1302
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,541
Slaughter racing home.

1303
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,855
When I traveled through Asia this summer,

1304
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,595
I went to tremendous trouble and
expense to rent a car with a phone

1305
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,406
so I could call up
sports phone in New York,

1306
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,765
you know, get the scores.

1307
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,476
I drove through a war in,
what, Afghanistan, right.

1308
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,537
Soviets against somebody.
I never got it straight

1309
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,561
because I'm calling up sports phone
like every hour on the hour for updates.

1310
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:12,943
What about my play?

1311
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,945
Yeah, no more evasive tactics.

1312
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,532
It's your best play, Nicky.

1313
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,745
I've seen it twice.
I went back again tonight to be sure.

1314
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,748
It's a brave and honest piece of work.

1315
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,960
Artistry, sensitivity
you've never shown before.

1316
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,343
You're not just saying that
'cause I, you know,

1317
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,761
I got the gun in my hand?

1318
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,445
Well, no, you're out of bullets.

1319
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:42,973
See, daddy?

1320
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,976
And Peter redmond helped immensely.

1321
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,479
Boy, those pauses,
they were exquisitely timed.

1322
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:55,402
Well, we worked
really hard on those pauses.

1323
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,246
Ah, ah, there it is.

1324
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:11,627
I had to call sports phone
from Lhasa, Tibet, right?

1325
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,088
Freezing in my little rented fiat

1326
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:16,024
in, you know, whatever cheap,
on the hillside,

1327
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,843
this rocky debris dating back
millions and millions of years

1328
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,320
from the time the himalayas thrust up

1329
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,429
and the plates of India and Asia collided.

1330
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,224
Red Sox three, white sox two,

1331
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:26,851
Buckner drives in the winning run.

1332
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,728
We love Buckner.

1333
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:31,355
- Don't we, hon?
- We do.

1334
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,171
A moment in the history of the world.

1335
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:40,573
They're gonna run this play over and over.

1336
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,491
Jesus.

1337
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:14,023
Faster, daddy!

1338
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,742
Another night of traffic.

1339
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,703
Taxis slipping through the neon.

1340
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,164
Taxis racing in the gloom.

1341
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:33,292
People come out of all-night parties and

1342
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,085
can't find their cars.

1343
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:41,759
Uptown, downtown, headlights, taillights,

1344
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,554
cars weaving down the avenues,

1345
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,431
sleeping people at the wheel,

1346
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:50,100
sirens in the chilly distance.

1347
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:58,943
The planet turns, the traffic rolls.

1348
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:04,073
This is lone eagle, over and out.

1349
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,579
J“ take me out to the ballgame j“

1350
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:55,791
j“ take me out to the crowd j“

1351

1356
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:21,108
j“ at the old ballgame j“

1357
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,248
Go on now, go on.

1358
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,995
J“ take me out to the ballgame j“

1359
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,249
