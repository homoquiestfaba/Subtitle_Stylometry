1
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:00,398
Ready?
Ready. Red car.

2
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,901
He is in there?

3
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,333
Yeah. Pretty sure it's him.

4
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,599
Oh, you're pretty sure.
Is he in there or not?

5
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:08,938
Now, I'm getting tired of this, man.
You need to be sure, for sure.

6
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:10,977
It's him. I'm sure. I'm sure, all right?

7
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:13,206
Last time, you fucked up.
Red car, right?

8
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,409
Relax. At least it's not Charlotte.
I'm not playing.

9
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,850
All right. Turn left.
Okay. I can't be perfect.

10
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:21,547
- I'm doing the best I can.
We need you fucking perfect.

11
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,748
Shut the fuck up!

12
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:25,790
I shouldn't even be here, man.
I shouldn't even be here.

13
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:09,362
Shit.

14
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,121
Hey, Tarkey.

15
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,800
Where's that, um, alcohol-lotion stuff?

16
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,697
Hey, don't use too much.
That stuff is expensive.

17
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,308
Yeah.

18
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:53,806
And then at 11 he cries and...
I don't know, it's, like, every two hours.

19
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,081
I don't know how much more
we can take.

20
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:59,187
How long do you think
this diaper duty is gonna last?

21
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,816
Everything's gonna be okay.

22
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,358
Just get that baby puke off of your shirt.

23
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:08,223
Yeah.

24
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:10,955
Benny.

25
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,569
Officer Steadman.

26
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,664
Ten-sixty-six.

27
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,334
- So how long you think you...?
- I told Mom I'm staying at Lisa's.

28
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,546
Okay. Don't shoot the messenger.

29
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,108
Thanks.

30
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,694
Here you go. Have a good one.

31
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:44,025
Something wrong with your stepdad?

32
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,361
- Yeah. He hates you, Benny.
- Uh-huh.

33
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,838
- All right. Here we go.
How'd you get it?

34
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,303
Hit it. Mask on.
I'm ready.

35
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,066
Get your mask on.

36
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,366
- Ready? Here we go.
Move!

37
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,946
- Hastings Market. December 20th.
Are you okay? What do you want?

38
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,815
What do you think?

39
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:03,712
Benny?

40
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,046
Yeah. What, Tarkey?

41
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:08,756
Don called in sick.
Do you wanna stock tonight?

42
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,787
Oh, I've been here since 3.

43
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:15,488
It's a $ 1.10 more an hour. But, hey,
if you're so rich, you don't need to work...

44
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:16,996
...that's fine.
- No, it's fine.

45
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,062
All right, go see Manny in back.

46
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,532
Yeah.

47
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:29,903
<i>Attention, Hastings shoppers.</i>

48
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:33,615
The store is now closed. Thank you.

49
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,757
- Hey, Benny.
- Hey, Officer Chambers.

50
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,264
Hey, where's your flypaper?

51
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,666
Oh, it's in the bottom,
right-hand side over there.

52
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:58,033
- Thanks, man. Be good.
- No problem.

53
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,027
Benny.

54
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,227
Down on the ground.

55
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:23,825
Okay.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,024
Okay.

57
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:27,626
Don't fucking move.

58
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,396
Don't fucking move.

59
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,869
Don't you fucking move.

60
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,667
Get down.

61
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:34,434
Get down.

62
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,874
No buttons, no phones.

63
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,174
No buttons or fucking phones.

64
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,544
Take it easy. Whatever you want,
you can have it. Just take it easy, okay?

65
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
- Whatever you want, whatever you want...
Eyes on me.

66
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,155
Okay. Okay. Okay. We're good.

67
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,952
- We're good.
Come on. Come on.

68
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:52,492
Okay.

69
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,220
Eyes.
- Okay.

70
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,730
Lady, let go of the tree. Crazy?

71
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:02,663
Stop. Don't move. Turn around. Keep quiet.

72
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,863
Please.

73
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,201
No. It's not him.

74
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,079
- Wait here.
Check there, Spooky.

75
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:14,079
Get down on your knees.

76
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,384
On your knees. On your knees.

77
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,721
No, get down.
Aisle 5!

78
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:28,090
<i>Attention,
Hastings shoppers. This is a robbery.</i>

79
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,059
The front and back doors
have been chained.

80
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,201
<i>We're monitoring all cell-phone activity.</i>

81
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,802
<i>Anyone caught using their cell phone
will be shot.</i>

82
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:38,899
Do not, I repeat, do not try to be a hero.

83
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,475
If you cooperate and do as we say...

84
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:44,374
...this will all be over in a few minutes.
Thank you.

85
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,277
Here are the keys to the safe.
There's not much in there.

86
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:49,907
Go!

87
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:54,412
Keep the hostages separated.

88
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,252
I'm at Aisle 3. I got one to look at.

89
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,585
Copy that.

90
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,133
Whatever you need, man, it's cool, okay?

91
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:08,770
Shut the fuck up and don't move.

92
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:11,236
- Okay. Whatever you need, okay?
- Keep quiet.

93
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,999
Okay. Okay.

94
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,634
Get him.
Oh, please. Don't do it. Don't!

95
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:20,380
Yo, bag him over here, baby.
Yo, Spooky, where you at?

96
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,246
I need you to come check this one
right now.

97
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,119
What did they shoot Mark for?

98
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,182
<i>These are bandidos, man.</i>

99
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:31,121
Shouldn't we get him to the hospital?

100
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,854
Shut up. Did I say you could talk?

101
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,159
God.

102
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:42,896
Shh. Move.

103
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,439
Move.

104
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,669
Okay. Okay.

105
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,714
<i>We're in Aisle 7. Keep sweeping.</i>

106
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:54,949
And be careful.

107
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:56,885
They know we're here.

108
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:59,113
Please, what are you doing?

109
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,017
- Just stop.
Turn right here.

110
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,158
Just let me go home.
My daughter's sick.

111
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,624
- Spooky, Spooky, check her real quick.
- Please!

112
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,363
Is she it?
- No! No!

113
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,056
Move out of the way!
- She's one.

114
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,462
Move!

115
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,063
Shit.

116
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,173
All right, you come here.

117
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:26,546
Be one. I've got a good feeling
about this one, Spooky.

118
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,075
No.

119
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,843
No, no. He's fine. He's fine.

120
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,816
I almost blew your head off there.

121
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,819
- Don't hurt me.
I said shut up.

122
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,218
Okay. Don't shoot me.

123
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,586
- Where are you, guys?
- Don't shoot me.

124
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,624
Ulrich, what's your status?

125
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,894
Ulrich, respond.

126
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,432
Anyone seen Ulrich's last position?

127
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,037
Hastings Market two shooters,
possibly more.

128
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,850
Three shooters.

129
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:23,268
You okay?
Yeah.

130
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,964
- All right, keep them quiet.
Stay the fuck down!

131
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,595
He's dead.

132
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:08,581
Police Department. Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon. Police Department.

133
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,912
Lady, get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

134
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,916
Put the weapon down. Put it down.

135
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,917
Everybody, stay where they are.

136
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,702
I can't believe this is happening.

137
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,379
Boo.

138
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,272
Come on.

139
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:47,715
<i>Ken, are you there? Please respond.</i>

140
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,085
<i>Shit.
- Ken, are you okay?</i>

141
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,159
<i>Ken, please answer me.</i>

142
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:53,852
<i>Ken, the units are on the way.</i>

143
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:02,963
Yo, Ulrich is down, and this one over here
is a cop and he called it in.

144
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,167
- We gotta get out of here.
Ritter?

145
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,374
<i>We need Spooky
to look at these guys in back.</i>

146
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:09,568
Spooky is dying.

147
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,871
I am?

148
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,745
Yeah, Spook.

149
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,451
You are.

150
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,814
Goddamn.

151
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:38,169
What's going on up there?

152
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:40,200
Spooky's dead.

153
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,542
- We gotta get out of here.
- That's not an option.

154
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,273
Let's put the ones we cleared up front.

155
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:51,215
What?
Ritter, the cops are coming right now.

156
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:53,514
If we don't get out of here,
we are going down.

157
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,317
- We haven't gotten the one we came for.
That's my point.

158
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:59,956
Fuck the needle. Let's burn this haystack,
you know what I'm saying?

159
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,098
- You said you'd play by my rules.
- They're fucking changing.

160
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,256
Nothing's changed.
Spooky said it was here.

161
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:08,235
We leave, we gotta start again.
I'm not doing that.

162
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:11,168
You wanna go? You go.
I'm staying till we're sure we got it.

163
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,739
What the fuck?

164
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,442
Logan, you in?

165
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:17,203
Yeah.

166
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:18,973
Sterling?

167
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,780
<i>The cops are on their way.
You still in?</i>

168
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,646
Spooky said it was here. I'm in.

169
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,845
Copy that.

170
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:28,484
You with us?

171
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,584
We need you.

172
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,399
Oh, see? That's fucked up.
You gotta get all sentimental and shit.

173
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,071
Yeah, I'm in, man. Shit.

174
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,343
Take the manager
and the girl back to Sterling.

175
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,913
You two, come on. Let's move.

176
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,579
- Let's move!
Okay. Okay.

177
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:57,985
Take it easy.

178
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,715
I hope you know what you're doing.

179
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:03,083
Yeah.

180
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,590
So do I.

181
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,024
Please just take what you want
and let us go.

182
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,130
Relax. Let's go.

183
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:11,598
Come on.

184
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:26,511
Oh, here comes the cavalry.

185
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,149
Yeah, well, this should keep them occupied
for a while.

186
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:39,658
No talking. Heads down!

187
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,524
Do not move until I tell you to.

188
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,632
Single file.

189
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,261
Kane?

190
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:51,335
We're gonna need to tape up
the ones we haven't cleared.

191
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:54,003
We're gonna be here for a while.

192
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:56,201
Who would've thought
it'd come down like this?

193
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:59,973
Yeah, well, this is where it started.
This is where it's gonna end.

194
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,349
Go ahead.

195
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,481
Come on, move. Go. Now! Hurry.

196
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,715
Come on. Let's go.

197
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:13,487
Everybody, get back.
Everybody get through. Move. Move.

198
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:15,357
Move. Move. Cover them.

199
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,056
Keep going. Keep going.

200
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:20,092
I got it.

201
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,039
Jesus. Fuck.

202
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:28,267
Circus come to town early this year.

203
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,578
Oh, Jesus.

204
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:43,415
Specimen appears to be
approximately eight years gestation.

205
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,520
- Hey. Move out of the way.
- No, don't. I want Ritter to see this.

206
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,962
What are you talking about?
That's a stupid idea.

207
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,694
You know what? Just take it easy.

208
00:15:56,338 --> 00:16:00,069
You know what? You got
one more time to tell me to take it easy.

209
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,242
Jeez.

210
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:12,811
Asshole.

211
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:23,221
Yo, put him down.

212
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,062
Not right there.
You take him away from them.

213
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:32,236
You should have a little bit more respect.

214
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,138
He's heavy.
- I don't care if he's heavy.

215
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,440
And you, skinny boy, why don't you grab
that box right there and break that lock?

216
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:42,311
- Why?
- I'm the one with the gun, that's why.

217
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,989
See how you dance without that gun,
asshole.

218
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,483
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

219
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,229
Cover him up with some plastic.

220
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,044
All right, let's get out of here.

221
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,648
Move it.

222
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:24,952
Are you guys all right?

223
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,793
The cops are still busy debriefing
the hostages that we released.

224
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,598
So, what now?

225
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,233
Plan B.

226
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:48,973
They shot this woman.

227
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,944
I don't know
why they didn't shoot us too.

228
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:54,112
So how many shooters was that?

229
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:55,381
Two.

230
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:56,922
Three.

231
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,587
- It was a slaughterhouse.
- Hey, Seth's here.

232
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,730
We got a hostage situation here,
Chicago.

233
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:05,628
What are you talking about? I just left
here. Let's get this lady out of the way.

234
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,501
This is kind of a new territory
for us here.

235
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:11,635
Are you kidding me?
My wife's daughter is in there.

236
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:14,875
The hostages.

237
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:16,340
Okay.

238
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:20,776
All right, move it, everybody.
Everybody, move it to the back! Let's go!

239
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:22,348
- Move it!
- I don't know.

240
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,782
- These guys...
- Just do what they say.

241
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,378
Things get too complicated...

242
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,615
...it gets hard real fast.

243
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,593
They got us in the back, too, surrounded.

244
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:35,423
Well, how many?

245
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:37,588
It doesn't matter
how many people are there.

246
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,961
We need to take care of this situation
at hand.

247
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:42,160
That's exactly my point, Ritter.

248
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:45,932
We don't have enough people
to complete the situation at hand.

249
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,935
- We bring in a new spotter.
- What?

250
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:52,338
Who's gonna walk in here
even if the cops would let him?

251
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:55,341
Charlotte.

252
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:59,081
Oh, my God, Charlotte?
After what happened in Scottsdale?

253
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,154
- That was an accident.
- Was it?

254
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,291
It doesn't matter.
We don't have a choice.

255
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:07,561
Unless somebody else has a better idea,
that's what we're doing.

256
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,661
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Hey.

257
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,926
You got one more time to open up
your mouth! Do you want this?

258
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,236
Just make yourselves comfortable, okay?

259
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,201
Okay, all right.

260
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,971
All right.
In the meantime until she gets here...

261
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:26,139
...we do the snip test.

262
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,610
What if we already killed him?

263
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,480
According to Spooky, we didn't.

264
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:37,591
There are some younger kids back there.

265
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:43,093
I know that. But if this thing gets out,
it's gonna get a helluva lot worse.

266
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:45,290
No, it's all right.

267
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:56,206
All right. I need bandages, tape, peroxide,
Tupperware containers, lots of ice.

268
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:59,040
Something that will make a clean cut.
Markers.

269
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,649
You know, that's real considerate of you.

270
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:06,479
Okay. Okay. Aisle 4 and 6. I'm on it.

271
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:09,982
Sterling?

272
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:11,489
Take care of the cell phones.

273
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:12,885
Check the other bodies.

274
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:16,622
See which ones have been infected.
Make sure Logan videotapes everything.

275
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:20,028
That may be all there's left
once this thing's over.

276
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:21,863
All right.

277
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:28,243
So, what, Ritter,
you gonna call K.C. Or what?

278
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:35,046
I'll go get the milk.

279
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:40,248
- Take care of the lights first.
- Yeah, I'll get the lights first.

280
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:59,101
Tell these guys to kick their high beams on
so they're as blind as we are.

281
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,366
Chambers said he took down two.

282
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:05,109
- How many dead?
- One confirmed the 911 call.

283
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,748
We don't know about the second.
Did you call Jennifer?

284
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,009
Phone's off.
She don't wanna wake the baby.

285
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,653
It's probably best she doesn't know
what's going on.

286
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,153
- I need to hear those tapes.
- We're getting it now.

287
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:17,554
Yeah. How many hostages?

288
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:21,526
Manager says five or so employees. Cars
in the lot give us four or five shoppers.

289
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,632
Maybe more, maybe less.
We're running plates and getting names.

290
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,234
Look, keep their friends and family
on a perimeter.

291
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:30,894
I need to set up a triage as well,
in case we get any more wounded out here.

292
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:32,472
Keep an ambulance on the ready.

293
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,701
I'm assuming there may be a television
or a radio on the inside...

294
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,870
...so we're gonna need to get somebody out
here on the media, keep them in control.

295
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:44,308
Just where exactly do you think
you're living these days?

296
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:51,256
Look, scratch that. Let's just get somebody
to talk to the family and friends...

297
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:55,226
...and find out if there's any health issues
with regards to the hostages, okay?

298
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,421
- Will do.
- Thank you.

299
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,031
So I guess you're used to this, huh?

300
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,331
No, you never get used to this.

301
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:49,416
See you later, Spook.

302
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:16,640
Well, I thought they'd bring
their big guns.

303
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:21,681
Well, this is Buck Lake.
These are their big guns.

304
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,720
We need to cut all the phone lines
at the front of the store.

305
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,839
I'm so sorry.
I can't keep another drop of anything down.

306
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,434
Finish it.

307
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,680
Don't fucking talk down to us, asshole.
I can have you killed.

308
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,241
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

309
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:01,119
Yeah, that's what I thought.

310
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:03,419
Big boy...

311
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:05,924
...don't get too comfortable, all right?
You're first.

312
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:08,756
- Uh, first?
- First for what?

313
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,626
Now, you know what for, don't you?

314
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:14,826
What?

315
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,034
The first one is ready. Come and get him.

316
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,409
Who are these guys?

317
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,401
Terrorists.

318
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:25,908
Like in that TV show.

319
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:29,449
They wanna kill all of us.

320
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:30,812
Tarkey's gonna die.

321
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,678
- What?
Shh, shh, shh.

322
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:38,292
The dead cop,
I saw a gun strapped to his ankle.

323
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,660
- Are you sure?
- Cop that's in the freezer?

324
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:42,429
One of us has to go back there.

325
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:45,065
Whitney, don't be a douche bag, okay?

326
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,224
- You're a douche bag.
- You're a douche bag.

327
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:49,629
Stop it.

328
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:54,204
Listen, they came in, started shooting.

329
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:56,435
They didn't try to negotiate.

330
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:57,805
They're gonna kill us all.

331
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,306
You don't know that.

332
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,848
Yeah, yeah. You don't...
You don't know that.

333
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:06,749
My stepdad was a hostage negotiator
in Chicago.

334
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:10,487
I'm telling you,
the only way we're gonna get out of this...

335
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,126
...is if we save ourselves.

336
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,555
- That's what they did in that TV show.
- Manny...

337
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:19,028
...I swear, if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna kill you myself.

338
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:41,049
Uh-uh.

339
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:42,781
It could be rigged.

340
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,591
Then maybe you should stand back then.

341
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:58,034
Is this a robbery or is this a siege?

342
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:06,237
It's a picture of the stock boy.

343
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:08,641
What do we have on this guy?

344
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:13,285
The van is registered
to an Aaron Ritter, 43...

345
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:14,683
...widowed. Wife is dead.

346
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:17,725
Apparently, he used to work at JPL.

347
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,391
- JPL?
- It stands for Jet Propulsion...

348
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:22,860
- Jet Propulsion Laboratories. I know.
- Yeah.

349
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:24,828
What do you mean "used to"?

350
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,334
Either he quit or was fired a few years
back. We're still getting details on it.

351
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:32,400
Let's get a phone line in,
see if we can talk to this guy.

352
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,974
The lines in front are cut.

353
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:37,909
- There's no other lines in?
- We're checking on it.

354
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,740
Let's get on it.

355
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,560
My name's Aaron Ritter.

356
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,499
This is Sherry Sterling...

357
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,264
...our medic.

358
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,566
Over here is Logan...

359
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:10,044
...he's our technician.

360
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:11,869
This is Kane.

361
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:16,808
- Notice they don't say what he does.
- Shh.

362
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,913
We are no happier about this situation
than you are.

363
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,351
But it is what it is...

364
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:27,652
...and we're gonna have to deal with it.
Look, uh...

365
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:29,963
These two?

366
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,430
They're just kids. You don't need them.

367
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:37,329
Why don't you let them go? Their parents
are gonna be worried about them.

368
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:40,167
I'm sure you all have
people out there who are worried...

369
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,310
...and we are gonna do our best...

370
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:46,072
...to figure out which of you are cleared
to go home as soon as possible.

371
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,340
Cleared? What do you mean cleared?

372
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:54,812
We know for a fact that one of you has
been infected with a dangerous substance.

373
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:58,659
And we've traced the origin
of that substance to Buck Lake.

374
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:02,192
Our spotter's dead.

375
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,499
Now he's the only one that could tell us
which of you had been exposed.

376
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:10,832
We're gonna have to rely on a backup
method to figure out which of you...

377
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,197
...are carriers.

378
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,842
Logan.

379
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,110
Come on.
- Whoa! What are you gonna do?

380
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,181
What are you gonna...?
Okay. Okay. Okay.

381
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,147
- Relax. Relax.
- Okay. Okay.

382
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:28,055
Look...

383
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,855
...we're gonna do a test.

384
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:36,528
This milk has altered your pH.
It'll cause a reaction in the carrier.

385
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:39,189
Now if you haven't been infected,
you will be cleared.

386
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,564
- What if we have been infected?
- Then you're dead already.

387
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:45,230
Look, let's just take it one step at a time.

388
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:47,598
All right?

389
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:52,008
Ho, ho, ho. Come on. 'Tis the season.

390
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,678
Okay.

391
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:09,693
Write your last name on the lid there.

392
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,858
- What?
- Just write your fucking name on it.

393
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,412
I already biopsied half the specimens.

394
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,409
What did you find?

395
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:34,453
They are twice as big
as anything we've seen.

396
00:29:34,622 --> 00:29:36,419
So far, they're all female.

397
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,356
All fertile.

398
00:29:39,794 --> 00:29:41,728
All right. Let's get to it.

399
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,427
Tarkey, are you married?

400
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,566
- What?
- Are you married?

401
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:49,300
No. Yeah. No.

402
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:52,205
I'm divorced.

403
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:54,934
I want you to look at my fingers.

404
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,401
Do you see a red line?

405
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,708
Uh...

406
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,850
Uh...

407
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,411
No red line.

408
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:09,318
- Which finger?
- Pinky, your left.

409
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,152
- Pinky.
- When did you get divorced?

410
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:14,391
Um...

411
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:18,157
There was this other guy at work.
He was in the Sales Department.

412
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,530
I didn't ask you why. I asked you when.
When did you get divorced?

413
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:23,330
Um...

414
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,476
Just take a deep breath.

415
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,212
Calm down.

416
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:35,078
Answer the question.

417
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,717
It was...

418
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:38,785
...three years ago.

419
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,752
You dating anyone?

420
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:44,750
Why? Uh...

421
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,860
I mean, um...

422
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,521
No. I mean, there's some online serv...

423
00:30:50,064 --> 00:30:52,589
No! Don't touch me! No, no, no!

424
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,600
- Stop moving! Don't move!
- All right, calm down! Calm down!

425
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,465
I got money. I got money.

426
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:08,345
I got money. I got money.

427
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,313
You can have it. You can have it.

428
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,819
Look, look. Here.

429
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:15,319
- Slow.
- Okay. Okay.

430
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:21,791
I got... I got money. Look.

431
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,357
- Where did that come from?
- Where do you think?

432
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:25,825
Not in his ass.

433
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:30,400
Looks like Mr. Tarkey's a thief.

434
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:36,238
Look, look. It's, like, $2000 there.
You can just have it.

435
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:37,503
- Sit.
- And you can go.

436
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,510
- You can just take...
- Sit the fuck down!

437
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:41,205
Take them.

438
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:45,979
All right.

439
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:49,022
If anybody goes to get that gun,
it's gonna be me.

440
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,987
Oh, yeah, old man?

441
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,587
What, are you out of your mind?

442
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:00,427
Manny the Man's gonna get that gun.

443
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:04,333
- Then I'm gonna take all these fools out.
- Don't be stupid.

444
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:07,104
Listen.

445
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:11,336
I've had a lot of weapons training.
I'm an expert marksman.

446
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,581
Are you military or something?

447
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:19,178
I teach a shop class
at the public high school.

448
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,919
Fucking teacher?

449
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,516
- Okay.
- Oh, man.

450
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,388
You come in firing,
we'll tackle him from behind.

451
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:30,321
There's...

452
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,867
There's a backdoor
at the end of the corridor.

453
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,400
It'll take you to the meat counter
where the freezer is.

454
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:39,904
Shh, shh.

455
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,868
All right, I can make it.

456
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:50,347
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Hey!

457
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:53,550
Some of us have to piss, eh?

458
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,222
Man, it's a free country.
Go let loose, all right?

459
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,290
<i>Yeah, órale to you too.</i>

460
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,728
All right, the box cutter.
Give me the box cutter.

461
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,919
Yeah.

462
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:29,555
This is Detective Seth Steadman.

463
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,518
I'm in charge of the negotiations.

464
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:34,259
<i>Am I speaking to an Aaron Ritter?</i>

465
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,122
That's right.

466
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:38,826
<i>Okay, Aaron.</i>

467
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,362
I thought you should know
we found your van.

468
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:44,096
<i>- I figured.
- I wanna help, okay?</i>

469
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,540
But I can only do that
if you tell me what you need.

470
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,008
Why don't you tell me
what's going on in there?

471
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:57,651
<i>- Lf I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
- Yeah, well.</i>

472
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,719
I've had some pretty
crazy rides myself.

473
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,620
<i>- Why don't you try?
- I'm a little busy right now.</i>

474
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,884
Well, it must be pretty big.
You're a long way from home.

475
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:08,889
I go where the work is.

476
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:12,959
That means you're a hardworking man.
Got a lot of respect for that.

477
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,530
Tell me. Is it anything that your daughter,
K.C., would understand?

478
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,969
<i>There's a lot of people
in there that we're worried about, okay?</i>

479
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,238
<i>There's a lot
of worried mothers and fathers.</i>

480
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:29,406
I want you to bring me a woman
named Charlotte Breen.

481
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,387
Charlotte Breen.
Okay, that's a start. I like that.

482
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:38,021
Tell me if there's anybody else there
that's hurt. Give me some name...

483
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:40,752
Charlotte Breen.
You'll find her at Phoenix Station 508.

484
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:43,897
Arrested on drunk and disorderly
and possession two weeks ago.

485
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,693
I'd have bailed her out myself,
but I've been preoccupied.

486
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:49,226
Okay. Okay.

487
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,261
What about the other hostages?

488
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:56,604
If you wanna contact me in the future,
the number's 709-555-4823. Got it?

489
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:59,770
<i>And Seth, the longer it takes you
to bring me Miss Breen...</i>

490
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:02,916
...the uglier it's gonna get in here,
you understand?

491
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:05,242
Yeah.

492
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:12,889
Whoa, wait! Just wait a minute.
Wait a minute. You guess... What?

493
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,995
Just a minute, you guys need to get
to Charlotte, we can get that done. No!

494
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,403
- Ahh!
Jesus.

495
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:27,170
What the hell?

496
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:28,933
Hey, what are you doing to him?

497
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,941
- Shh. Quiet.
- What are you doing?

498
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:34,172
You know exactly what we're doing, okay?
We're conducting a test.

499
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:36,509
Do you realize all you guys
are going to jail?

500
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:39,949
You hurt us, they're just gonna put
you away for that much longer.

501
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:41,486
Yeah, it seems likely.

502
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:45,558
You know, you give yourself up now
and they're gonna go a lot easier on you.

503
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,423
Yeah, my dad's friend, he's a real
good lawyer. I'm sure he'd help you out.

504
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:52,960
Well, if he's from Buck Lake,
I'm not interested.

505
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:57,468
Oh, God. I just wanted a bottle of wine.
I should've opened a can of beer.

506
00:35:57,638 --> 00:36:01,005
- What kind of test you doing?
- Well, do you wanna find out, huh?

507
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:03,575
Do you wanna find out?

508
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,017
Oh, it's been two minutes. He's clear.

509
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,621
I could have sworn it was him.

510
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:21,927
Kane...

511
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,761
...it's not the manager.

512
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:33,535
You have to stop wriggling around.

513
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:46,618
The organism has a biology
used to heat...

514
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,883
...so freezing is the only sure-fire way
to kill it.

515
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:53,720
And that process can take hours.

516
00:36:55,596 --> 00:37:01,057
<i>Fertility is directly tied to maturity,
as you can see:</i>

517
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,131
<i>Each of these nodules contain a larva.</i>

518
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,369
<i>The larva itself is nearly indestructible.</i>

519
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:13,604
Did she say it came from a meteor?

520
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:16,181
I think she said "a meteor-like object. "

521
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,341
But that means what I think it means,
right?

522
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,546
Charlotte Breen is on her way.
Get here in next 20 minutes.

523
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:27,921
Rap sheet is a mile long.
Crack, heroin, meth, you name it.

524
00:37:29,196 --> 00:37:31,426
This is what came up on Ritter.

525
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,057
Left the JPL shortly after he was acquitted
of involuntary manslaughter.

526
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,228
- Manslaughter?
Yeah. Oh, it gets better.

527
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:43,175
All the circled ones
quit the JPL at the same time.

528
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:47,110
According to Ritter's in-laws, they started
some club and started buying guns.

529
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:51,950
And one more thing, you're gonna love this.
The rest of the people in the picture?

530
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:54,015
All dead.

531
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,192
Someone...
Psst. You got your hands free yet?

532
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:10,001
Nice.

533
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,934
If you get in there...

534
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:16,839
...don't let the door close behind you
or else you'll be locked inside.

535
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:18,410
Yeah.

536
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,246
Oh, my God.

537
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:23,841
Oh, my God.

538
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:30,086
- What did they do to you?
- They cut my finger off.

539
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,653
What?

540
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,458
I know it looks bad but trust me.
We have your best interests at heart here.

541
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:40,300
Let me know if you need some more ice
for that.

542
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:43,631
I'm not gonna need another reason
to hate the holidays.

543
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:45,362
All right. Come on.

544
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:46,904
- What? No.
You're next.

545
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,065
- What are you doing?
- Look, shut up!

546
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,968
All right, come on. Let's go.

547
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,613
We can blow your foot off
just to see what happens.

548
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:54,805
- Ready to go?
- Dude, just...

549
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:57,610
Am I talking to you? Am I talking to you?

550
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:01,182
You wanna take her place?
Is that what you wanna do?

551
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,016
Okay. Well, then shut up.

552
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:06,819
- Come on, let's go.
- My dad is Seth Steadman. He is a cop.

553
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:09,155
What the hell's going on in here?

554
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:11,988
It seems like our cashier here
has high connections.

555
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,595
Her father is a cop.
The name is Seth Steadman.

556
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:16,631
Stepdad.

557
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:18,601
Seth is your stepfather?

558
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,270
Pick who you're gonna pick.
Let's get going.

559
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,508
- That's what I'm talking about. Let's go.
- Fuck.

560
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,043
Wait, wait.

561
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,283
Just take me, okay?

562
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,395
- Let's go.
Somebody get him...

563
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:44,997
Come on.
- Fine.

564
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:51,034
Hey.

565
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,671
Asshole.

566
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,535
I need my glasses.

567
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:59,141
They must want you pretty bad
over at Buck Lake, huh?

568
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,147
Can I have my sunglasses, please?

569
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:07,652
They wanna know why you and some guy
named Ritter had a falling out.

570
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:12,857
I fucked up, that's why.

571
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:14,722
Fucked up, how?

572
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,689
I was supposed to help out
with something...

573
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:21,357
...but a friend of mine hooked me up
with some TMAs...

574
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:24,402
...some real high-grade stuff.
Have you ever tried that shit?

575
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:27,306
What were you supposed to be
helping with?

576
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:28,942
Oh, fuck.

577
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:34,343
I told you.
I help out that guy, he gets me into shit.

578
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:37,748
These handcuffs are too tight.

579
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,786
They're too tight.

580
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:44,755
You should go ahead and sit back.
We're almost there now.

581
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:47,556
I'm done talking to you.

582
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:35,373
So I'm supposed to see a red line?

583
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:38,168
I don't know.

584
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:39,835
Do you?

585
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,643
Is there an answer that's gonna keep you
from cutting off my finger?

586
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,851
I can't tell you that.

587
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:54,752
No?

588
00:41:57,364 --> 00:41:58,991
Tell me something.

589
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,662
Why did you stick up for that cashier?

590
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:09,433
Uh...

591
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:12,671
She...

592
00:42:14,776 --> 00:42:16,971
What's gonna keep you from doing this?

593
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:19,538
I'm sorry.

594
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,640
Are you?

595
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:27,817
Yes, I am.

596
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:29,851
Very.

597
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:38,490
<i>Fuck. Fuck! Run!</i>

598
00:42:42,236 --> 00:42:44,397
<i>Get down.</i>

599
00:42:49,744 --> 00:42:52,679
<i>- Get down. Get down.
I don't know. I don't know.</i>

600
00:42:53,014 --> 00:42:56,916
<i>- Okay, where is it? Where the fuck is it?
Fuck, here it comes. Here it comes.</i>

601
00:42:57,085 --> 00:42:58,552
<i>Let's go. Where the fuck is it?</i>

602
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,347
<i>Where the fuck is it?</i>

603
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:02,352
<i>It's chasing Fred...</i>

604
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:04,922
<i>- Where did it go?
- Who are these people?</i>

605
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:06,117
<i>What the fuck is he doing?</i>

606
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,021
You're a pretty tough kid.

607
00:43:10,498 --> 00:43:12,693
I'm impressed. Don't move.

608
00:43:14,102 --> 00:43:15,126
Shut up.

609
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:39,720
Oh, God. I feel terrible.

610
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:44,357
Oh, God. I thought being drunk
would make it kind of easier.

611
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:48,528
All right. How many we got left?

612
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:50,270
Three.

613
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:51,766
We don't need Charlotte...

614
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:55,466
...which is a good thing considering
every time she fucks up, people die.

615
00:43:55,643 --> 00:43:57,235
She's a junkie. What do you want?

616
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:01,348
We're not leaving till we verify we got him.
And we're gonna need her to do that.

617
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,577
- You are losing control of the situation.
- I'm aware of the situation. Thank you.

618
00:44:06,754 --> 00:44:08,346
- Do something about it.
- I will.

619
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:09,990
Jesus! Quiet.

620
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,360
Bingo!

621
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,684
Shit.

622
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,974
Fuck it.

623
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,100
Guys, she's cracking out!

624
00:45:19,227 --> 00:45:21,991
Oh. What the fuck was that?

625
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,657
I don't know.

626
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,565
Yo, what's going on out there?

627
00:45:27,802 --> 00:45:29,463
You read me?

628
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,509
Hey, go. Go.

629
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:57,026
- Are you doing okay?
- Don't start now.

630
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,360
- Let me see.
- Don't.

631
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,073
Yeah.

632
00:47:16,477 --> 00:47:19,742
What the hell was that?
Yo, is that you guys in there?

633
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:22,473
No, it wasn't.

634
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:27,181
Why the hell do we not know
what's going on in there yet?

635
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:32,521
Hang tight, everybody.

636
00:47:35,596 --> 00:47:37,120
Would you check that out?

637
00:47:37,298 --> 00:47:39,289
This place is crawling.

638
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:48,801
You're taking way too much time.
Where's Charlotte Breen?

639
00:47:48,976 --> 00:47:51,308
Hey, hey, hey.
Who are you shooting in there?

640
00:47:53,147 --> 00:47:56,310
We haven't shot your stepdaughter,
if that's what you're wondering.

641
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:59,185
Look...

642
00:47:59,654 --> 00:48:01,053
...just tell me she's safe.

643
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:04,023
Yeah, she's safe, for now.

644
00:48:04,692 --> 00:48:07,593
All I'm asking is that you
stay cool in there, okay?

645
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:09,286
I mean...

646
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,062
...if you start shooting in there again...

647
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:15,062
...I'm coming in there.
Do you understand me?

648
00:48:15,236 --> 00:48:18,603
No, you bring me Charlotte Breen
or else I think you know who's next.

649
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:22,669
She's only 10 minutes away, man.

650
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:24,140
Give me 10 minutes, okay?

651
00:48:28,683 --> 00:48:30,674
We're not gonna make it, are we?

652
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:33,047
I don't know.

653
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:35,312
But we're gonna finish this.

654
00:48:39,527 --> 00:48:41,927
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing there?

655
00:48:42,096 --> 00:48:44,496
Well, the sentinel sucker tried
to infect Sterling.

656
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:48,533
- How mature was it?
- Very. He's unlike anyone I've seen before.

657
00:48:48,703 --> 00:48:50,330
Murphy's Law, man.

658
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:53,473
Where did the old guy go?

659
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:56,242
Where did he go?

660
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,071
Where did he go?

661
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,339
Oh, you all wanna play?

662
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:04,275
Stand up.

663
00:49:05,786 --> 00:49:11,053
You tell me where he went
or I'm gonna blow your head off.

664
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:14,687
He's in the freezer.

665
00:49:16,764 --> 00:49:18,425
Good boy.

666
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:25,033
Ritter, Sterling,
you guys need to come in here right now.

667
00:49:31,245 --> 00:49:33,372
We're on, boys.

668
00:49:34,682 --> 00:49:37,378
- I'm looking for a Seth Steadman.
- That'd be me.

669
00:49:37,752 --> 00:49:39,720
I got something for you.

670
00:49:39,887 --> 00:49:41,582
Let's do it.

671
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,556
Charlotte Breen.

672
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,286
Thank you, Lord.

673
00:49:51,532 --> 00:49:54,296
Where I come from,
you break your hands to get out of those.

674
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:56,026
I did.

675
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:07,344
All right, you come out right now
or we start firing.

676
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:13,077
Shit!

677
00:50:13,254 --> 00:50:14,619
What?
Cover my back.

678
00:50:15,956 --> 00:50:17,685
Oh, did you hear that?
- No.

679
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:19,919
Jes...!

680
00:50:20,094 --> 00:50:21,652
Christ!

681
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:24,896
- What the fuck?
- What?

682
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:27,534
Give me a warning next time.
I can't hear a thing now.

683
00:50:27,902 --> 00:50:31,133
Stop being a pussy.
He wasn't gonna make it anyway.

684
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:40,871
Whoa!

685
00:50:41,048 --> 00:50:42,606
Yo, see that?

686
00:50:42,783 --> 00:50:44,273
You see someone there?

687
00:50:45,686 --> 00:50:46,710
He's right there!

688
00:50:54,195 --> 00:50:56,026
- Jesus Christ.
- They're not coming back.

689
00:50:56,197 --> 00:50:58,961
You don't know that.
Stay here. They could be right outside.

690
00:50:59,133 --> 00:51:00,862
- Let's just make a run for it.
- No.

691
00:51:01,035 --> 00:51:02,502
- Whitney, shut up.
They left.

692
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,470
If they were gonna kill us, they
would've done it. Just sit down! Wait...

693
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:11,374
- Ritter.
- Hey, I got Charlotte Breen.

694
00:51:11,545 --> 00:51:12,569
I'll call you back.

695
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:16,513
The fucker hung up on me again.

696
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:21,146
Would you mind telling me
what's going on here?

697
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:24,553
Why don't you get me something
to make it worth my while?

698
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:29,519
- Jesus Christ.
- John has some OxyContin for his knee.

699
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:33,323
Get it.

700
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:38,536
Kane, Logan, you read me?

701
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:42,500
Stay here and watch them.

702
00:51:42,676 --> 00:51:44,234
Kane, you read me?

703
00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:48,707
Not yet. Almost. But not yet.

704
00:51:57,391 --> 00:52:00,656
Jesus Christ, Kane, what happened?

705
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:05,090
Yeah, well, Logan is dead, man.

706
00:52:07,568 --> 00:52:08,933
Yeah.

707
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:10,832
It's the cop.

708
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:13,738
Sterling didn't check him.

709
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:16,433
You think it's a king?

710
00:52:17,178 --> 00:52:20,909
Yeah.
That's some powerful motherfucker, man.

711
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,950
It's the most powerful one I've seen yet.

712
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:31,056
God, that body was all dead
and it just came back to life.

713
00:52:32,426 --> 00:52:33,825
All right.

714
00:52:33,994 --> 00:52:37,521
- Hang in there. You're gonna be all right.
- No, man. No.

715
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:39,063
No.

716
00:52:41,268 --> 00:52:44,362
It was all acting all cracked up and...

717
00:52:47,074 --> 00:52:48,439
Stung me.

718
00:52:49,944 --> 00:52:52,071
He stung me, Ritter.

719
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:03,986
But, you know, I hurt it...

720
00:53:04,158 --> 00:53:06,786
...busted a couple of times,
couple of bullets, man.

721
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:09,395
It was frozen for a second.

722
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:10,928
It's all confused.

723
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:21,599
Oh, ain't this some shit?

724
00:53:23,444 --> 00:53:25,036
Just try to relax.

725
00:53:25,212 --> 00:53:27,271
Oh, man.

726
00:53:27,448 --> 00:53:31,009
Man, Ritter,
I know we had some differences.

727
00:53:32,953 --> 00:53:35,319
I don't regret none of them shit so...

728
00:53:36,657 --> 00:53:39,125
You understand what I'm saying?

729
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:42,452
Yeah.

730
00:53:47,468 --> 00:53:49,265
Don't you dick around with this thing.

731
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:52,872
You go out there
and you kill that motherfucker.

732
00:53:53,707 --> 00:53:56,699
You end it right here, right now.

733
00:54:03,617 --> 00:54:05,084
So...

734
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:08,547
...should you do the honors or should I?

735
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,062
Come on now. You can only kill people
that you were married to?

736
00:54:34,815 --> 00:54:36,442
I'm sorry, Kane.

737
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:40,817
Yeah, I'm sorry too, motherfucker.

738
00:54:42,189 --> 00:54:43,713
Do it.

739
00:54:50,064 --> 00:54:51,725
Do it!

740
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:12,208
Killing?

741
00:55:13,153 --> 00:55:14,484
Yes.

742
00:55:15,222 --> 00:55:16,780
Aliens?

743
00:55:16,957 --> 00:55:18,481
Yes.

744
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:28,894
Case in point.

745
00:55:40,481 --> 00:55:42,472
- What happened?
- Kane found it.

746
00:55:43,183 --> 00:55:44,741
It was the cop.

747
00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:46,579
It got him.

748
00:55:46,787 --> 00:55:47,845
Kane's gone.

749
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:52,253
Look, luckily it's cracked out, so
it won't take the chance of going outside.

750
00:55:52,926 --> 00:55:53,984
Wh... What about Logan?

751
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,497
What happened?

752
00:56:01,902 --> 00:56:05,065
Look, I'm gonna have to go after it.

753
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:06,965
What about them?

754
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:10,599
I need you to stay here and protect them,
all right?

755
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:12,636
Okay.

756
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:15,981
Just be careful.

757
00:56:24,057 --> 00:56:25,149
I don't have all night.

758
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:28,488
Why don't you start
by telling me just how you fit into this?

759
00:56:28,662 --> 00:56:30,892
Okay, I'm a spotter.

760
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:34,090
- A spotter.
- Yeah. I can see them.

761
00:56:34,268 --> 00:56:36,532
I was infected.

762
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:37,930
- You were infected?
- Yeah.

763
00:56:38,472 --> 00:56:43,239
Didn't take. Too much "better living through
chemistry" screws them up real good.

764
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,575
The only problem is you gotta keep using
to keep them from taking over.

765
00:56:50,684 --> 00:56:52,652
That's the best druggie excuse I've heard.

766
00:56:53,253 --> 00:56:54,743
Jesus Christ.

767
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:40,257
Get ready.

768
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:42,768
This is a bad idea.

769
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:44,367
Shh.

770
00:57:57,217 --> 00:58:00,414
Now, Benny. Go, go, go. Go, Benny.

771
00:58:00,587 --> 00:58:02,248
Hold on. Hold on.

772
00:58:02,456 --> 00:58:04,720
- Whoa, hold on, just wait. Wait, wait.
- Fuck.

773
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:09,155
Let it go. Let it go.

774
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:10,762
Crazy bitch!

775
00:58:15,636 --> 00:58:17,831
I got it. I got it!

776
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:19,802
Who's in charge now?

777
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:20,997
Manny the Man.

778
00:58:22,743 --> 00:58:24,836
He's right behind me. Get ready!

779
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:39,818
Do we have a location on those shots?

780
00:58:42,996 --> 00:58:44,156
What the fuck was that?

781
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:48,997
Goddamn it. He's not picking up.
Are we ready around back?

782
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:50,932
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

783
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:53,839
Your friend is not leaving me
much choice.

784
00:58:54,007 --> 00:58:57,272
You go in there now,
everyone in there dies.

785
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:00,938
You saw it, Benny, with your own eyes.

786
00:59:01,114 --> 00:59:02,206
Shut up.

787
00:59:02,382 --> 00:59:04,247
Come on, Benny. Let's get out of here.
Let's go.

788
00:59:04,418 --> 00:59:07,285
Look, it's loose. It's loose out there.

789
00:59:07,454 --> 00:59:10,355
Now you go out there, it's gonna kill you.
Plain and simple.

790
00:59:10,524 --> 00:59:13,857
You wanna survive this,
you're gonna have to trust us.

791
00:59:14,261 --> 00:59:16,991
You cut my fucking finger off.

792
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:20,290
We did what we had to do.

793
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,694
Don't listen to him, Benny.

794
00:59:25,038 --> 00:59:26,835
Shut up!

795
00:59:27,007 --> 00:59:28,975
Now lookit, Benny.

796
00:59:29,743 --> 00:59:32,507
We think it's the king, all right?

797
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:35,113
We've killed all the other ones...

798
00:59:35,282 --> 00:59:37,648
...but this is the king.
We get it and it's over, done with.

799
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:41,283
But we're gonna need your help to do it,
all right?

800
00:59:42,356 --> 00:59:44,347
What the fuck's the hold up?

801
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:46,316
Just give me a second.

802
00:59:48,228 --> 00:59:49,957
Look, Benny, they're calling me.

803
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:53,793
They brought in a new spotter.
Her name's Charlotte.

804
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:56,765
- She can verify it's the king.
- Come on, Benny.

805
00:59:56,937 --> 00:59:59,098
Do you want Whitney
to get her finger cut off?

806
00:59:59,272 --> 01:00:00,330
Shut up.

807
01:00:00,874 --> 01:00:02,466
Okay, Benny.

808
01:00:03,377 --> 01:00:05,971
You can see this is important, can't you?

809
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,710
Give me Charlotte for 10 minutes.
That's all I'm asking, 10 minutes.

810
01:00:11,084 --> 01:00:12,949
Fine. Just bring her in.

811
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,280
Benny.

812
01:00:14,888 --> 01:00:18,517
- Come on. Come on. All right, give me that.
Back the fuck up, Tarkey!

813
01:00:18,692 --> 01:00:22,059
You fucking stiff us for two months.
Fuck, it's our overtime.

814
01:00:22,229 --> 01:00:25,926
Now it's a fucking karmic dildo
just fucking you in your ass.

815
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:28,033
Just go sit down!

816
01:00:28,201 --> 01:00:31,364
You are so fired.

817
01:00:34,408 --> 01:00:36,706
Benny, I'm putting my weapon down...

818
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:39,209
...and I'm answering the phone, all right?

819
01:00:41,181 --> 01:00:44,912
- Ritter.
- Hey, what the fuck is going on in there?

820
01:00:45,552 --> 01:00:47,713
- You got Charlotte?
- Yeah, she's right here.

821
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:52,314
All right. Look, you give me Charlotte,
you get one hostage.

822
01:00:52,492 --> 01:00:54,926
Give me 10 minutes,
you get the rest of the hostages.

823
01:00:55,095 --> 01:00:57,154
No, no, no. I want Whitney.

824
01:00:57,330 --> 01:01:01,562
Come on. You and I know she is the reason
you haven't stormed this place already.

825
01:01:01,735 --> 01:01:04,670
<i>One hostage, 10
minutes, you get Whitney and the rest.</i>

826
01:01:04,838 --> 01:01:06,499
What's that noise we keep hearing?

827
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:08,497
Seth...

828
01:01:11,011 --> 01:01:14,469
...if I were you,
I'd get my family out of Buck Lake.

829
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:16,814
<i>Put Charlotte on the phone.</i>

830
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:23,984
Hey, Ritter.

831
01:01:24,157 --> 01:01:25,556
I'm sorry.

832
01:01:26,593 --> 01:01:29,255
Charlotte, tell me something.

833
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:31,826
The cop, is he clean?

834
01:01:35,869 --> 01:01:37,268
Hey.

835
01:01:46,646 --> 01:01:48,443
Yeah. Yeah, he's clear.

836
01:01:48,882 --> 01:01:53,615
Good. All right.
Look, let him bring you in for the exchange.

837
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:55,948
We got a problem in here.

838
01:01:56,123 --> 01:01:57,886
Let me take care of it.
I'll call you back...

839
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:01,485
...let you know which door to use.
- Ritter?

840
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:43,126
I'm scared, Benny.

841
01:02:43,804 --> 01:02:45,032
No.

842
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:48,003
Now listen, I'm gonna protect you.

843
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:52,504
I don't trust these guys.

844
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:54,474
A spotter...

845
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:56,673
...that can see kings.

846
01:02:58,952 --> 01:03:01,420
Look, all I know is what I saw.

847
01:03:02,489 --> 01:03:04,320
These guys...

848
01:03:04,491 --> 01:03:07,187
These guys know what they're doing,
okay?

849
01:03:07,661 --> 01:03:11,791
If they say that this guy is a king...

850
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:14,266
...then we have to kill him.

851
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:24,772
Hey, why don't we just stay here
and wait for the cops?

852
01:03:24,945 --> 01:03:26,242
Be quiet.

853
01:03:26,413 --> 01:03:28,608
Just shut up, Tarkey.

854
01:03:45,432 --> 01:03:47,900
Looks like we're taking
the long way around.

855
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:50,702
All right, cover the rear.

856
01:03:53,373 --> 01:03:56,240
Both of you, to the right side of the door.

857
01:03:56,643 --> 01:03:58,406
I thought you're gonna give them time.

858
01:03:58,812 --> 01:04:00,404
Ten minutes.

859
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,707
But forgive me if I prepare for the worst.

860
01:06:02,068 --> 01:06:03,899
Oh, shit.

861
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:20,718
We're gonna have to use the front door.

862
01:06:21,087 --> 01:06:22,213
Front door. Got it.

863
01:06:24,424 --> 01:06:26,688
Why aren't we going in?

864
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,384
Nobody goes in until I say so.

865
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:32,429
Are you doing this for those hostages?
Or are you doing this for your family?

866
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:34,226
I'm doing this for all of us.

867
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:38,599
And I said nobody goes in there
until I say so. You got that?

868
01:07:37,864 --> 01:07:39,695
Did you see something?

869
01:07:39,866 --> 01:07:41,697
I don't know.

870
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:45,963
Please tell me this thing
is not trying to trap us?

871
01:07:46,139 --> 01:07:47,504
Tarkey...

872
01:07:47,674 --> 01:07:50,302
...that thing is not trying to trap us.

873
01:07:52,212 --> 01:07:54,510
What's this thing doing, stalking us?

874
01:07:55,348 --> 01:07:57,339
I don't think it knows what it's doing.

875
01:07:57,851 --> 01:07:59,944
It's only as smart as its host.

876
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,748
That brain must be half dead by now.

877
01:08:05,258 --> 01:08:07,726
All right, come on.

878
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:24,634
I see flashlights.

879
01:08:24,811 --> 01:08:27,678
But why the hell are they moving
so damn slow?

880
01:08:28,014 --> 01:08:30,881
Always getting me into shit.

881
01:08:34,087 --> 01:08:36,180
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

882
01:08:37,257 --> 01:08:40,351
Goddamn it, Moody.
Would you give me a few more minutes?

883
01:09:04,784 --> 01:09:06,752
- I lost my finger.
- Shh.

884
01:09:19,132 --> 01:09:20,759
Tarkey!

885
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:32,303
What the fuck?

886
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:37,240
Oh, Jesus Christ.

887
01:09:38,351 --> 01:09:40,876
All right, look, we need to get them
some place safe.

888
01:09:41,054 --> 01:09:44,455
Take them back to the manager's office.
Stash them there. Go! Go! Go!

889
01:09:44,624 --> 01:09:46,319
Let's go fast.

890
01:09:50,897 --> 01:09:53,092
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

891
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,432
Give me a few more minutes, Moody.

892
01:09:57,003 --> 01:09:58,402
Seth.

893
01:09:58,705 --> 01:09:59,729
Seth!

894
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,535
Okay, wait.

895
01:10:05,144 --> 01:10:07,305
Okay. Come on.

896
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:13,984
Stay down. Stay down.

897
01:10:25,632 --> 01:10:26,860
Where's my hostage?

898
01:10:27,467 --> 01:10:28,957
Charlotte.

899
01:10:32,005 --> 01:10:34,473
I'm not handing Charlotte over
until I get my hostage.

900
01:10:34,641 --> 01:10:36,199
Ritter, what's going on?

901
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:37,843
The king is loose in there.

902
01:10:38,011 --> 01:10:39,876
The king? The first one's in here?

903
01:10:40,046 --> 01:10:41,980
What the hell is he talking about?

904
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:43,672
I'm gonna say this one more time.

905
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:45,778
Where is my hostage?

906
01:10:48,221 --> 01:10:50,189
Your hostage is dead.

907
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:55,388
- What was that?
- Look, Seth.

908
01:10:55,561 --> 01:10:59,395
I know it's crazy. I don't have the time
to explain it to you right now.

909
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:02,133
But your stepdaughter is still alive.

910
01:11:02,302 --> 01:11:05,931
I'm trying to keep it that way.
But to do that, I'm gonna need your help.

911
01:11:06,105 --> 01:11:10,132
- You're telling me Whitney is alive.
- Yes, sir, she is.

912
01:11:11,377 --> 01:11:12,639
Now what's it gonna be?

913
01:11:22,388 --> 01:11:24,549
Charlotte, lock the door.

914
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:33,324
- What happened to Spooky?
- He's dead. So is Ulrich.

915
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:35,694
- What else we got?
- Females.

916
01:11:35,868 --> 01:11:38,860
All fertile, bigger than we found before.

917
01:11:39,038 --> 01:11:43,202
- Pick anything out?
- Yeah, it's powerful. Very powerful.

918
01:11:48,948 --> 01:11:50,313
I shot it six times.

919
01:11:57,957 --> 01:11:59,788
What the hell was that? Was that Ken?

920
01:12:00,927 --> 01:12:02,121
Define Ken.

921
01:12:03,196 --> 01:12:04,220
Oh, shit.

922
01:12:04,397 --> 01:12:06,228
I told you so.

923
01:12:06,632 --> 01:12:09,123
- Where's Whitney?
- I hid her in the office with Benny.

924
01:12:09,302 --> 01:12:12,396
Ritter. Ritter, it's looking for something.

925
01:12:12,572 --> 01:12:14,767
Oh, shit. The kids.

926
01:12:15,441 --> 01:12:16,635
All right, look.

927
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,601
Let's circle around back. Come on.

928
01:12:24,684 --> 01:12:26,618
Be quiet. Just stay quiet.

929
01:12:27,487 --> 01:12:30,479
- We've gotta make a run for the doors.
- No.

930
01:12:30,656 --> 01:12:32,715
No, it will kill us.

931
01:12:43,803 --> 01:12:46,465
I'll run for it. I'll distract it, okay?

932
01:12:47,607 --> 01:12:49,598
When it gets far enough...

933
01:12:49,776 --> 01:12:51,869
...that's when I want you to run.

934
01:12:56,682 --> 01:12:58,081
Benny?

935
01:13:00,486 --> 01:13:02,511
I'm not leaving here without you.

936
01:13:05,358 --> 01:13:07,019
You fought for me today.

937
01:13:07,994 --> 01:13:11,623
That's all I've ever wanted you to do
is to fight for me.

938
01:13:16,569 --> 01:13:18,127
Okay.

939
01:13:25,645 --> 01:13:29,376
Wait a minute, goddamn it. Now
where the fuck is the manager's office?

940
01:13:29,549 --> 01:13:32,416
Because I'm not taking another step
until I get my daughter...

941
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:35,315
...and get her the fuck out of here.
Period.

942
01:13:36,923 --> 01:13:38,720
Okay, fine.

943
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:41,658
It's in the northwest corner
of the building.

944
01:13:41,828 --> 01:13:45,389
We'll create a distraction. You circle
around, get the kids and get them out.

945
01:13:45,565 --> 01:13:47,192
- Just tell me when.
- Wait a second.

946
01:13:47,366 --> 01:13:49,061
You'll promise me, if we do this...

947
01:13:49,235 --> 01:13:52,261
...you'll give us time
to finish what we came in here to do.

948
01:13:52,438 --> 01:13:53,632
Done.

949
01:13:53,806 --> 01:13:56,536
We'll draw it towards us
then you take off.

950
01:13:57,009 --> 01:13:59,102
How the hell are you gonna do that?

951
01:14:04,517 --> 01:14:07,213
It sounds like a personal problem.

952
01:14:09,722 --> 01:14:12,316
After this, you and me are even.

953
01:14:14,393 --> 01:14:15,758
Fine.

954
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:40,883
- Ahh!
- Hey!

955
01:14:41,053 --> 01:14:42,577
Whoa, whoa. It's just me.

956
01:14:42,755 --> 01:14:45,315
Hey. Come here, baby.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

957
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:47,425
Hey, are you okay, huh?

958
01:14:47,593 --> 01:14:51,120
Oh, God. Listen. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

959
01:14:51,297 --> 01:14:52,457
- Okay.
- Okay?

960
01:15:21,327 --> 01:15:22,794
Okay.

961
01:15:24,797 --> 01:15:26,094
Okay.

962
01:15:26,265 --> 01:15:27,892
It's coming.

963
01:15:36,275 --> 01:15:38,300
Don't shoot. We're coming out.

964
01:15:42,048 --> 01:15:44,676
All right, go, go, go!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

965
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:47,842
- Goddamn it. I said, wait a minute.
- We're not waiting any longer.

966
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:49,248
Put them in the car.

967
01:15:53,225 --> 01:15:55,750
- What the fuck is happening?
- I have no fucking idea.

968
01:15:55,928 --> 01:15:59,591
I'm going back in. Listen, you two let
nobody come in or out this door.

969
01:15:59,765 --> 01:16:01,426
Freeze!
Drop the gun.

970
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:03,362
- Put it down.
Shut up!

971
01:16:03,803 --> 01:16:05,270
- Put it down!
Drop the gun!

972
01:16:05,438 --> 01:16:08,407
- Shut up! Drop the gun!
I'm putting it down.

973
01:16:08,574 --> 01:16:10,667
- I need to talk to Detective Steadman.
- Shut up!

974
01:16:43,676 --> 01:16:45,007
Chambers!

975
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:28,582
What the fuck is it?

976
01:17:35,895 --> 01:17:37,726
Seth, shoot it!

977
01:17:39,098 --> 01:17:40,998
Seth, shoot this fucking...

978
01:17:50,276 --> 01:17:51,675
Oh, God. No.

979
01:17:55,314 --> 01:17:58,215
No, no, no!

980
01:17:58,384 --> 01:18:00,215
God, Ritter!

981
01:18:00,753 --> 01:18:02,516
Charlotte.

982
01:18:02,688 --> 01:18:04,087
Is...? Is it...?

983
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,683
Call an ambulance!

984
01:18:08,828 --> 01:18:10,295
We need to get a medic in here.

985
01:18:10,463 --> 01:18:11,862
Get a medic here now.

986
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:13,896
This is it.
- No.

987
01:18:14,066 --> 01:18:16,534
Sterling. Sterling.

988
01:18:17,837 --> 01:18:19,270
Do it.

989
01:18:20,806 --> 01:18:22,034
Oh, no.

990
01:18:23,609 --> 01:18:25,201
Do it.

991
01:18:38,357 --> 01:18:39,847
No.

992
01:19:36,982 --> 01:19:39,041
He had seen it from the beginning.

993
01:19:39,218 --> 01:19:41,277
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

994
01:19:41,453 --> 01:19:46,083
Listen! Listen! There are females loose
and they can't spread with the king dead.

995
01:19:46,258 --> 01:19:49,819
They can't spread with the king dead,
but somebody has to finish this. Listen!

996
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:53,761
You listen to me. Right now,
that is the least of your worries, okay?

997
01:19:53,933 --> 01:19:56,629
If what happened here,
what you said happened here today...

998
01:19:56,802 --> 01:20:01,239
...verifies and checks out, I will promise
that I will do whatever I can, all right?

999
01:20:01,407 --> 01:20:03,204
You got my word on that.

1000
01:20:05,344 --> 01:20:06,436
Let's go.

1001
01:20:06,612 --> 01:20:08,978
<i>Seth. This crackhead
won't let us near this thing.</i>

1002
01:20:09,148 --> 01:20:11,708
<i>- She's up to her elbows in it.
- She's verifying.</i>

1003
01:20:11,884 --> 01:20:13,579
- She's what?
- Verifying.

1004
01:20:13,752 --> 01:20:17,381
She's verifying.
Just let her do her thing.

1005
01:20:17,556 --> 01:20:19,581
Oh, no.
What?

1006
01:20:20,793 --> 01:20:22,727
- Give me your goddamn radio.
- Hey!

1007
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:24,590
Sterling, it's not it!

1008
01:20:24,763 --> 01:20:27,323
<i>Not it! It's not the king!</i>

1009
01:20:27,499 --> 01:20:29,524
Oh, Jesus. One of the kids.

1010
01:20:29,702 --> 01:20:31,727
It's that kid. Whitney, get out of the car.

1011
01:20:31,904 --> 01:20:34,805
<i>It wasn't the king. It's the boy.</i>

1012
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:40,005
Whitney?

1013
01:20:52,758 --> 01:20:54,123
No.

1014
01:20:54,326 --> 01:20:55,816
No.

1015
01:21:00,432 --> 01:21:02,957
I always loved you, Benny.
