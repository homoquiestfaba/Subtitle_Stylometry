1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,639
Previously on The Heights...

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,599
Can I get some help? I found
him in the gardens at the towers.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,919
I hear the towers send
us a lot of business.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,999
I live in the towers.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,399
12 years. No letter. No phone call.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,679
I had my reasons.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,559
- You snake.
- What are you talking about?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,359
He split the pub, a third each.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,039
Sorry, Mum.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,400
(FAINTLY) I'm sorry.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,640
(SIREN WAILS)

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,119
- Hazel Murphy?
- Yes.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,639
Hi, I'm Dr Rosso.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,839
How is she?

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Look, Shannon's placenta didn't
fully detach after the birth

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,199
and it's caused an infection.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,479
But she's stable now and
under some light sedation

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,079
to help her body manage the trauma.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,399
But she'll be OK?

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah, she should be.

21
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,599
We'll get her through the night

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,599
but she should be fine for
visitors in the morning.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,840
And the baby?

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,199
He's in great shape,

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,839
considering he's had
a bit of an adventure.

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Hey?

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,639
You can hold him if you like.

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,879
It's alright.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,080
Hazel?

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
There, bubba.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,960
Love the paint job.

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,359
When's your flight?

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,400
In a few weeks.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,439
You can have her room
while she's in hospital.

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,560
- But once she gets back...
- I'll figure something out.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,920
Oh! Bloody thing.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,480
There we go.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,381
_

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,199
Anyway, you know where everything is.

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,600
I'll see you in the morning.

41
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,960
(LAUGHS)

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,359
I nearly had you.

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,959
Mate, I was barely out of second gear.

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,080
Hey, what are you up to today?

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,999
Applying for jobs.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,519
What happened to that demo gig?

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,719
Finished up.

48
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,839
Oh, well, there must be
plenty of work about, right?

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,759
There's, like, apartments
going up constantly, right?

50
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,999
No, it's not that, man.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,879
I just hate demolition.

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,359
Everyone hates their job.

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,959
You don't.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,479
Working in Mum's shop?

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,199
I've hated that since I was seven.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,799
Being a teacher.

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,399
I'm not a teacher yet.

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,999
Yeah, but you will be.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,479
And it's something you want to do.

60
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,439
You might even tell your
mum about it one day.

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,399
Alright, calm down.

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,040
What is it that you tell her you do?

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,039
Business management.

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,039
(LAUGHS) Business management.

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,679
When are you going
to tell her the truth?

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,879
You know what she's like.

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,199
I'm just waiting for the right time.

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,759
What she's like?

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,799
I finished my job three days ago.

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,079
My uncle's on my case to get a new job.

71
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,280
You have it good.

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,959
You know, someone's going
to have to cover my shifts

73
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,359
when I do my teaching rounds.

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,720
Me?

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,359
Yeah, you. Why not?

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,560
Your mum isn't exactly my biggest fan.

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,079
Come over tonight. Put on the charm.

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
We'll get you a job.

79
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,440
You sure?

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,799
Yeah, it's the least I can do
after flogging you in that race.

81
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,199
Mate, you think you flogged me.

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,920
See, it's perception.

83
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,719
Next time you play in your socks.

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,359
- What are these?
- (LAUGHS)

85
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,359
Yeah, your sister might have
had a bit of a go at those.

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,799
Dad, these are brand new.

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,839
- Well, I think they look alright.
- I'm... I'm going to kill her.

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
They look alright.

89
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,279
I mean, look, until Michael Voss 20
years ago, no-one wore white boots.

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,879
So you're a trailblazer.
Think of it that way.

91
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,039
You are not coming in with me.

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,439
Yeah, I want to talk to Mr Fraser.

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,679
He needs to be aware of what you need.

94
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,399
Oh, my God, he's
aware. Everyone's aware.

95
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,999
You sent cerebral palsy
info to the friggin' school.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,119
Morning.

97
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,159
Morning.

98
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,359
Hey, I think we met the other day.

99
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,719
I was the guy who brought the
baby into the hospital. Pav.

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Oh, hi.

101
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,039
- Pleased to meet you.
- Yes, hi. Claudia.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,199
Couldn't help but overhearing.

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,799
Mich here has Mr
Fraser for homeroom too.

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,199
He could show your daughter...

105
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,919
- Oh, sorry. Sabine.
- Hey, Sabine.

106
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,759
He can show your daughter
there if that's going to help.

107
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,639
- Ciao!
- No... Sabine...

108
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Yeah, look, I can't blame her.

109
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,119
I mean, I take one
look at you and I think,

110
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,159
"Oh, my God, that's embarrassing."

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,999
Yeah, mortifying, apparently.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,799
How's the baby?

113
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,599
Happy to report the
little guy's doing well.

114
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,759
Oh, great.

115
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,599
What about Shannon Murphy?

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,759
She just... I... I know her.

117
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,839
She's a local girl from the towers.

118
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,119
Yeah, she'll be alright.

119
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,199
Oh, great.

120
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,639
Ah, well, I've got to...
I've got to get to work,

121
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,279
but listen, if you find any more babies,

122
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
can you send them to St Vincent's?

123
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,159
'Cause I could use a quiet shift.

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,640
(LAUGHS) OK, will do.

125
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,399
- Have a good one.
- See ya.

126
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,480
See ya.

127
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,760
Hazel?

128
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,359
You are kidding me.

129
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,080
Hi, grub.

130
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,920
How you feeling?

131
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,400
OK. A bit groggy.

132
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,079
You look rich.

133
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,799
This? Charity shop.

134
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,479
What's with the key?

135
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,960
It's decorative.

136
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,479
At least you didn't
come back with an accent.

137
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,960
It's there. Just wait.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,839
I knew it.

139
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,759
Why'd you do it?

140
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,360
Mum, not right now.

141
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Shannon?

142
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,099
Hello. My name's Jill Sanders.

143
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,019
I'm with the Department
of Children's Services.

144
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,740
I was hoping that we could have a chat.

145
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,219
Work hard. First million
by the time you're 25.

146
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,059
Will do. I'll be back
after 3:00 sometime.

147
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,419
OK.

148
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,259
Oh, and I invited Ash
around for dinner tonight.

149
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,539
What you do that for?

150
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,179
I can't feed the world.

151
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,259
Alright, we'll go to that new
pho place around the corner.

152
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,739
$15 for pho I wouldn't
serve to my enemies.

153
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,779
White people! Bloody hell.

154
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,179
It's cool. I hear they
put croutons in it.

155
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,339
Alright, see ya.

156
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,899
Sully, bring your friend. I'll cook.

157
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,220
Awesome.

158
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,099
I'm fine.

159
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,659
You've had a pretty rough
go of it, haven't you?

160
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,859
My role is to help support you to
do what's best for you and your baby.

161
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,940
Patch.

162
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,219
Just what we're calling him,
until you give him a real name.

163
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,419
Patch.

164
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,779
That's lovely.

165
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,779
Have you given any thought
to what you might want to do

166
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,099
once you leave the hospital?

167
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,859
Not really.

168
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,620
You'll come home, won't you, with Patch?

169
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,659
That's a lovely idea.

170
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,100
Being home with family support
is nearly always the best option.

171
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,179
Have you thought about
spending any time with Patch

172
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,259
up at the Mother/Baby Unit?

173
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,140
There's a lot of support,
plenty of people that can help.

174
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,460
I can set something up if you'd like.

175
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,619
I guess.

176
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,459
Good.

177
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,939
I'll do that, and I'll pop back in
tomorrow to see how you're going.

178
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,060
OK.

179
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,579
Well, thanks for letting me
come and talk to you, Shannon.

180
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,500
I'm... I'm really looking forward
to helping you and Patch get started.

181
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,539
Bye, everyone.

182
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,540
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

183
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,139
She seems alright.

184
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,980
For Child Services.

185
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,099
Will be great to see bub.

186
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,179
Yeah, but I've already made up my mind.

187
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,780
I'm putting him up for adoption.

188
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,939
What have you got next?

189
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,339
Art and Design.

190
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,019
With Bathgate?

191
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,179
Come on, I'm in that class.

192
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,739
I'm trying to remember your name.

193
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,539
All I'm getting is Sparkly Boots.

194
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,379
Yeah, that's my stupid sister.

195
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,579
I quite like them.

196
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,059
Yeah, well, I've got to actually
wear them in front of my footy mates.

197
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,979
Any dude who takes the piss out
of someone wearing sparkly boots,

198
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,339
you gotta question his manhood.

199
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,379
Do I?

200
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,739
What's he afraid of?

201
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,619
That masculinity as a
concept is so fragile

202
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,819
that one guy wearing sparkly
boots has to be slapped into line

203
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,659
or the entire male race will collapse

204
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,499
and all of humanity will die out?

205
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,379
Sorry, you probably
weren't after a lecture.

206
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,219
No, but you gave it anyway.

207
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,819
(LAUGHS)

208
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,899
So what are you at this school for?

209
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,499
I got expelled from Hartford.

210
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,659
For?

211
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,739
Satanic worship.

212
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,020
Fair enough.

213
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,260
Hey, bro.

214
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,979
Two bucks. Thanks.

215
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,019
New kid. Need some supplies?

216
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,059
The health food in the
canteen will kill you.

217
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,899
Got a chocolate, yeah?

218
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,219
Nice.

219
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,739
Two dollars.

220
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,139
Why are you starting
in the middle of term?

221
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,579
She got expelled from Hartford.

222
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,739
Oh, what for?

223
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,499
Streaking.

224
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,940
Streaking?

225
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,939
Thanks.

226
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,619
We playing at yours tonight?

227
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,259
Ah, I've got footy after this.

228
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,859
Well, I've got work, so after that?

229
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,539
- Yeah, sure.
- Easy.

230
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,939
Alright, bud. See you round, bro.

231
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,259
See you.

232
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,820
I'm not completely useless, friendo.

233
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,219
Alright, let's get this out of the way.

234
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,459
"So, what's with the limp, Sabine?"

235
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,939
Oh, that! I have cerebral palsy.

236
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,179
"Wow, does it hurt?"

237
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,539
A little bit, especially when
you treat me like a special case.

238
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,460
Can I get these lectures online?
'Cause I'm really late for class.

239
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,979
Why?

240
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,140
Come on, I can barely
look after myself, Ryan.

241
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,939
Why didn't you come to me?

242
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,019
Really.

243
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,739
Because you told me you
never wanted to see me again.

244
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,179
Once. In an argument.

245
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,059
You know I didn't mean it.

246
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,700
You know the first thing I thought
when I found out I was pregnant?

247
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,500
"I'm going to need some
gear to deal with this."

248
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,059
A lot's happened since you've been away.

249
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,779
What about the father?

250
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
Long gone.

251
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,739
I can't be a mother.

252
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,179
It's not fair on the baby.

253
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,499
That's why adoption was always the plan.

254
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,819
And the garden?

255
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,459
Was that always the plan?

256
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:54,019
It came early and I freaked out
and I just wanted to get rid of it.

257
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,459
I knew that if I put it in
the garden it would be OK.

258
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,939
He is OK.

259
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,019
He's in the nursery now.

260
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,459
He's doing good.

261
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,459
And when you're feeling
better, when you're ready...

262
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,659
I'm not going to be ready, Mum.
I'm never going to be ready.

263
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,019
I know you think that now...

264
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,220
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

265
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,819
I've made up my mind.

266
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,300
I'm not keeping that baby.

267
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,939
OK, but Tex Wylie is way
better than Professor Nangs.

268
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,939
C'mon! He's an amazing MC.

269
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,979
He helps me do my homework.

270
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,899
Your sister does your homework.

271
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,020
Google does mine.

272
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,860
She's new. I've never seen her before.

273
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,339
Sabine.

274
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,339
I got some notes from
Bathgate's art class to give you.

275
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,299
- Thanks?
- And that's Rose.

276
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,779
She's had a chip on her
shoulder since she wet her pants

277
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,459
in Mrs Giddens' class.

278
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,499
That was year three!

279
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,140
Hey, it's OK, Rose. We accept you.

280
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,459
You wanna walk with me?

281
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,899
- See ya, Rose.
- See ya, Rose.

282
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,659
Bye.

283
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,739
I don't have any notes.

284
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,859
I figured.

285
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,219
And Rose is full of herself.

286
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,220
I figured that too.

287
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:07,499
- Sabine.
- Hey!

288
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,020
So this is it.

289
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,019
What a dump.

290
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,419
It's actually pretty nice inside.

291
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,499
This is Mich.

292
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,739
- Mich, this is my boyfriend, Dane.
- G'day.

293
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,779
Hi.

294
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,059
Nice boots.

295
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,939
- Thanks.
- We off?

296
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,499
Yeah. See ya, Mich.

297
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,539
See ya.

298
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,659
Oh. Hang on.

299
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,619
My mum got a promotion.

300
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,099
That's why I moved schools.

301
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,219
So you weren't expelled?

302
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,339
Nope.

303
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,579
So no streaking?

304
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,860
I'm not making any promises.

305
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,660
Oh, Mich!

306
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,540
(BOTH GIGGLE)

307
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,339
Hey, hey!

308
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,059
I see you... taking stuff to the towers.

309
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,339
Taking stuff to the school.

310
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,539
You're stealing my business!

311
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,019
- They're my groceries.
- Oh, yeah?

312
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,499
Hey!

313
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,539
Staff discount, 7%.

314
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,059
Plus delivery fee too, I bet.

315
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,660
I don't know what you're on about.

316
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,179
I'm watching you!

317
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,699
Still as pleasant as ever.

318
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,460
I reckon she's got worse.

319
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,379
Shannon won't listen.

320
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,659
Don't judge her.

321
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,419
I'm not judging her but it's
not... it's not a spare bike.

322
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,619
It's a baby. You can't
just give it away.

323
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,179
That's judging her.

324
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,299
Sorry.

325
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,259
Do you know anything about the dad?

326
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,339
She wasn't seeing
anyone as far as I know.

327
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,459
I thought I would just come
home, bury Bill and go home.

328
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,739
I didn't think there'd be
all this mess to clear up.

329
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,979
(SCOFFS, LAUGHS)

330
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,219
What?

331
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,219
"I didn't think there'd be
all this mess to clear up."

332
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,339
Is that supposed to be me?

333
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,459
You did a runner, Ryan.

334
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,339
You haven't had to clear
up any mess for 12 years.

335
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,939
I don't have an accent.

336
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,179
You are still the same idiot
you were when you were 10.

337
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,819
- Love a whinge.
- I'm not whingeing.

338
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,339
You used to say that too.

339
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,499
Remember Josh Pomano
pushed you in the river?

340
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,619
Cried for hours.

341
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,579
I was 10. I cut my leg open.

342
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,140
Could not shut you up.

343
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,820
What?

344
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,379
What am I looking at?

345
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,420
Josh Pomano.

346
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,929
Pushed me in the river when I was 10.

347
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,169
And?

348
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,529
You don't remember?

349
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,569
I cut my leg.

350
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,089
It was bleeding. I was crying.

351
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,969
You were always crying.

352
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,530
And then what happened?

353
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,369
I punched him in the face.

354
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,569
(LAUGHS)

355
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,609
Seven years old.

356
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,529
My little sister, the enforcer.

357
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,330
It didn't matter that you were
younger or that he was bigger.

358
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,410
You looked out for me, kept me safe.

359
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,209
That's what Patch needs.

360
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,490
