1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,724
This was real important to Mike
Epps to come back to Indianapolis,

2
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,226
to represent and put
his city on the map.

3
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,020
Get on your feet!

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,896
Put your hands together

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,526

6
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,969

Who ain't got no panties on?

12
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,464
Some guys yelled too when I said, "Who
ain't got no panties on?" over there.

13
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,343
Better not be over there naked,
nigga, up under them jeans.

14
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,970
What's up, Naptown!

15
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,519
Yeah.

16
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,729

00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,415
This the Ave right here.

Yeah, man. Everybody's

25
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,638
My mama and daddy met on this street
at a club called Place to Play.

26
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,599
Y'all too young for that, yeah.

27
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,394
That's... Yeah, that's
where it was going down

28
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,063
at the Place to Play,
nigga. The Avenue, nigga.

29
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,692
Ain't nobody got no COVID
in here, do they? Shit.

30
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,194
They all on my ass.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,490
Little fake COVID
card motherfuckers.

32
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,870
Yeah, that COVID is some
bullshit, man, you know.

33
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,666
Fuckers talking about taking the shot.
I-I don't know what the fuck to do.

34
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,210
That shit is… they trying
to scare you with the shit.

35
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,463
"Go ahead and take
it. Got a pill now."

36
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:59,220
I went on and got it. I said, "Fuck it."
I went and got the motherfucker. Shit.

37
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,348
Yeah, I went on and got it.

38
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,019
When they start talking about
cutting my shit off Netflix,

39
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,771
I said, "Here! Where you
gonna hit it at? Put it in."

40
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,276
I said, "Hit me in the ass
with it. Hit me... Hit me... ".

41
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,080
I thought I had it, I-I
did. I thought I had it.

42
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,666
I went to the doctor. He said,
"That ain't what I said."

43
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,918
I said, "What'd you say?"

44
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,796
He said, "I told you, you tested
positive for cocaine on the 19th."

45
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,693
I said, "I didn't hear you.
Didn't hear what you said."

46
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,344
"All I heard was 19."

47
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,644
See, niggas don't
wanna take the shot.

48
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,272
The best way to get niggas to take
that shot is put it in flavors.

49
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,444
"That motherfucker pi... That-that
pineapple Moderna, nigga!"

50
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,738
"Shit!"

51
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,532
"That watermelon Pfizer!"

52
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,787
"Nigga, yeah. I'm on
my ninth shot, man."

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,082
"You know they got the mango
coming down next month, man."

54
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,469
We got the Mayor Hogsett in the house.
Y'all, give it up for Mayor Hogsett!

55
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,514

00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,709
"Get another drink and go

60
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,841

the police got you on the car,

75
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,384
"Get the fuck out of his face."

76
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,845
"You better not hurt
him, motherfucker."

77
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,765
"We'll be down there
to get you, baby."

78
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,435
Nigga in the backseat, "Go tell
my mama I love her, Miss Bimery."

79
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,236
We in Indiana, man. This where
niggas come to get white girls at.

80
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,744
This is where Black men come and
get white girls at in Indiana.

81
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,166
There be a brother in Brownsburg with
a white girl, "I got a white girl."

82
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,711
"Yeah, I'm down here in Brownsburg
right now, know what I mean?"

83
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,840
"Me and my white girl got us

84
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,511
"Nigga named Dewayne."

85
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,100
Yeah. All the brothers in here
with a white girl right now,

86
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,976
you had your ticket
two months ago.

87
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,856
Them white girls don't play,
"We're gonna enjoy your show."

88
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,901
"You're enjoy yourself. We're
gonna get your tickets."

89
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,487
"We're gonna call your friends."

90
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,743
Black women will buy the ticket
and won't tell you they got it.

91
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,289
And be punking you all through
the motherfucking house.

92
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,750
"You still wanna go to
that show, don't you?"

93
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,421
"Better watch your
motherfucking mouth."

94
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,465
"You won't be going."

95
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,385
"You can clean
the whole garage."

96
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,679
Hmm.

97
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,227
You know, if you got COVID-19,
you can eat a stranger out.

98
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,607
'Cause you ain't gonna
smell it or taste it.

99
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:34,620
If a woman's coochie stank, does
that mean the kid's gonna be bad?

100
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,127
I mean, they did come
from a bad environment.

101
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,928
Fellas, never date a woman
who don't respect your wife.

102
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,310
I said that wrong. I
didn't mean to say that.

103
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,563
Yeah, this is a union, bitch.

104
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,318
Ladies, you ever just look at
your man sometime and just say,

105
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,403
"I just let anybody fuck."

106
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,669
Where the fat vegans at? Any
fat vegans in here tonight?

107
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,756
Them is some lying
motherfuckers,

108
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,841
them fucking fat vegans.

109
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,595
"I don't eat that, I don't eat
that, I don't… Uh-uh, uh-uh."

110
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,848
"Have you read what's in that?
I don't eat that, I don't eat…."

111
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,808
You eating something,
motherfucker.

112
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,316
I got a cousin. She's 700 lbs.

113
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,902
She called me crying the other
day. I said, "What's wrong?"

114
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,655
"They snatching women
in the neighborhood."

115
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,914
I said, "And what are
you worried about?"

116
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,712
"Ain't gonna snatch
nothing around you."

117
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,299
"You might get forklift
off one these streets."

118
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,725
Anyway, she been running down the street
where the women been getting snatched.

119
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,063
She's jogging down the street, looking
in car, trying to get snatched.

120
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,481
She's looking in the car.

121
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,403
She running through the
park. She waving at cars.

122
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,907
'Cause you know how them big
girls, they run real slow.

123
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,083
The van that been... That
been snatching the women

124
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,919
rolled past her five fucking
times the other night.

125
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,879
I told her, "What
does that tell you?"

126
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,715
"They didn't see me."

127
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,801
I said, "How in the fuck did
they not see... They seen you."

128
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,556
How can somebody not see
a-a circle on the corner?

129
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,022
A big Cheerio standing there on the
corner, and ain't nobody see you.

130
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,567
Anyway, she got
snatched. They ended up…

131
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,947
I think they snatched her last
Thursday or something like that.

132
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,199
Yeah, they snatched her.

133
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,119
I talked to the detective.

134
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,206
He said, "Mr. Epps,
she got in the van."

135
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,377
Yeah, she got in the van.

136
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,465
As soon as they
stopped, she got in…

137
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,770
It's a lot of young girls in here
with some old men in here now. I-I…

138
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,772
Just sprinkled off in here.

139
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,776
I'll see your AARP card lit up.

140
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,365
When you see them old men walk
like Mr. Ricky, walk like that.

141
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,201
He tired of you hiding him.

142
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,705
You take him to
one of them events?

143
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,707
Not a event, a "e-vent."

144
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,671
"You gonna stop hiding me.
Shit, I'm ready to be seen."

145
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,011
She be walking up front. "Come
on, Mr. Ricky. Hurry up."

146
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,019
Mr. Ricky, "Everybody know we're
together now. You cut the bullshit."

147
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,318
When Mr. Ricky get mad and
she say the wrong thing

148
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,072
and he turn around, he gonna say, "Look,
bitch. Let me tell you something."

149
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,205
He done put that spin
on it like it was a-a-a…

150
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,459
"Look here, let me tell you something.
Don't you ever in your fucking life!"

151
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,347
Yeah, well shit.

152
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,892
I like Indiana 'cause everybody
play basketball out here.

153
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,061
Everybody can play
ball a little bit.

154
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,772
A little bit, you know.

155
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,361
We got the Indiana Pacers in the house.
Give it up for the Indiana Pacers!

156
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,072

157

I tried it, yeah. Everybody in
Indiana thought they was going pro.

160
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,546
End up going to prison.

161
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,219
You ought to see them niggas playing
ball in the penitentiaries in Indiana.

162
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,430

170
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,577

I was like, "Fuck basketball.

195
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,563
White people, they be
thinking about their money.

196
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,982
"I can't come in you

197
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,987
"I have to get our stocks and
bonds up before I bust in you."

198
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,582
Niggas don't give a fuck.

221
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:04,440

00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,191
But that's good, man.

When you got a real
lawyer, know what I mean?

You in jail, and they never been to jail,
and here come some young motherfucker,

00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,830
"Okay, sign your

230
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,555
I seen Mike Tyson one time.

231
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,141
I was like, "Mike." He was
like, "Where you from?"

232
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,392

233
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,352
He was like, "Oh shit!"

234
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:54,031
He was like, "I don't never wanna go
to that motherfucker, right there."

235
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,914
I remember one time I had a girl
come from out of town. She came here.

236
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,041
Got her some White
Castles and shit.

237
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,294
She jumped off the
plane. "I'm hungry."

238
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,756
"Oh, Indianapolis.
I love Naptown."

239
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,258
I took it, "I'm hungry
Let's get some food."

240
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,968
I took her to White Castle.

241
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,971
She was eating them little
hamburgers. She was…

242
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,724
Onion rings.

243
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,188

246
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,373
She said, "The doctor said
I almost died last night."

247
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,463
She said, "Fuck that shit."

248
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,217
Yeah, that's some real shit.

249
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,554
I know during the pandemic,
that was some scary shit.

250
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,890
Everybody was stuck in the house.
You go to the fucking grocery store,

251
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,892
everybody looking
at each other crazy.

252
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,521
"You ain't got it, do you?"

253
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,010
Walking through
the grocery store,

254
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,445

toilet paper, all soap.

255
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,075

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,535
but they ain't washing it."

257
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,914
There's some funky booty
niggas out here somewhere.

258
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,628
That shit was crazier

00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,342
"Well, this is the problem."

261
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,470
"I know that in two months
we're gonna be okay, all right?"

262
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,890
Niggas like, "Two months?"

263
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,226
People that ain't never
been locked down before,

264
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,895
they was going crazy.

265
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,191
It was just good for everybody that

266
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,485
"Gonna get my little noodles

267
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,698
"My crackers, gonna make
me a slam. Sit back."

268
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,332
"Chop them little beef jerkies down
in there with the cheese and shrimp."

269
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,792
Look at the jail niggas.
They know about that.

270
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,129
They know about that little
jail tray right there.

Yeah, that shit was crazy. Wasn't
nobody having fun but the scammers.

272
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,263

"This too shall pass."

277
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,115
Yeah.

278
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,788
If you stealing fucking money, you

279
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,956
Fuck it. Take it.

280
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,628
Fuck 'em. Take the money. All the money
they ain't took from you. Fuck 'em.

281
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,838
Take the fucking money.

282
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,343
Just don't be buying no shoes
and belts and shit with it.

283
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,554
Buy you some land. Buy you some

284
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,807

285
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,477

286
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,400
Buy you some houses 'cause you

287
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,444
'cause you gonna get some time.
They're gonna lock your ass up.

288
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,654
You going to jail.

289
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,162
That's fucked up. You gotta get
your teeth fixed when you stealing.

290
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,957
Anything you doing wrong,

291
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,293
get your teeth fixed
and your health right.

292
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,254
So at least you'd
be healthy in there.

293
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,300
Every time you buy a belt,

294
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,885
that tooth you ain't
fixed is in the back,

295
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,138
shaking his head saying,

296
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,016
"Look at this motherfucker
buying another belt."

297
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,187
"My tooth been back here smelling
like shit for two years."

298
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,815
"And you buying
another belt, nigga?"

299
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,081
I decided to sell drugs.

300
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,293
I was the worst drug dealer you
ever seen in your fucking life.

301
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,711
Yeah, you know.

302
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,964
You gotta be a certain type of
motherfucker to sell drugs, you know?

303
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,631
I was just, you know,

304
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,218
I walk up to the car
with my hand like this.

305
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,264
Fuckers just hit my
hand and ride off.

306
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,850
Okay, that's the first
sign. Get a fucking job.

307
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,855
You know.

308
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,151
I remember one time,
'cause I had a gift of gab,

309
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:45,989
I was talking to
this drug dealer.

310
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,034
Motherfucker gave me half
a kilo. I was like, "Hey!"

311
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,453
"I'll see you next week."

312
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,205
"Okay, all right, yeah."

313
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,583
I didn't know who to sell it to.

314
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,632
Man, I sat on that man's
shit for two months.

315
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,135
He was looking for me.

316
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,182
That's the worst feeling in the world.
When you owe a drug dealer? Shit.

317
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:17,104
Everybody in the hood be telling, "You
know Big Tony looking for you, man."

318
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,108
"Yeah, I seen him. Yeah, I know
where he's at. I talked to him."

319
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,486
"You ain't talked to him,
nigga. He looking for you."

320
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,326
And the other drug dealers be
helping him catch you and shit.

321
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,204
You be at Foot Locker
buying some shoes.

322
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,124
"Yeah, he up here buying
some Jordans right now."

323
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,335
"With your money, Big Tony."

324
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,506
"Hold him there.
Stall him, stall him!"

325
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,006
"Stall him!"

326
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,808
That's the worst feeling when you
owe a big drug dealer some money.

327
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,145
You sitting there shooting dice,
and he walk up. And you like, "Uh."

328
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,855
"Hey, what's up, Big Tony?"

329
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,649
"Uh!"

330
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,696
He like, "What am I gonna say
to this nigga right here?"

331
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,498
I remember I was at this place called
the Epicurean, know what I mean?

332
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,418
It's an old after-hour joint,
right there off Sutherland,

333
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,128
back in the day, in the '90s.

334
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,756
And I used to take my jacket and
put the cocaine down in my jacket,

335
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,217
so when the police checked
me, they didn't find it.

336
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,470
And I'm at the
Epicurean shooting dice.

337
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,890
It ain't nothing but old men in
there, old gamblers and shit.

338
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,601
They in there shooting dice.
They got signs on the wall.

339
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,518
"No drugs."

340
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,811
"No guns."

341
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,563
That's all that's in there.

342
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,861
Everything on the wall they
say, "No, don't have it,"

343
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,279
it's in there already.

344
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,740
I'm shooting the dice.

345
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,118
I threw the dice, and
all the dope came out.

346
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,290
All the old men, "Ah!"

347
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,086
One of the old dudes, "Get your
ass outta here. What the hell?!"

348
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,926
When I got outside, he said, "How
much you want for two of them?"

349
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,433
Yeah.

350
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,560
During the pandemic,
I'm telling you, shit,

351
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,980
that motherfucking COVID shut
down everything but child support.

352
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,110
That's the only thing kept rolling,
that child support kept rolling.

353
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,117
When you pay the child support that
I pay, you be mean to your kids.

354
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,246
"Shut the fucking door!"

355
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,258
"Dad, got straight As."
"I don't give a fuck!"

356
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,603
That's the only thing that
kept rolling was child support

357
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,147
'cause I called down
there. I called down there.

358
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,569
Yeah, I told the lady, "Do you
see what's going on in the world?"

359
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,447
"You keep sending fucking child
support bills here, bitch."

360
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,616
"Do you see the world's ending?"

361
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,792
She said, "We don't have anything
to do with that, Mr. Epps."

362
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,503
"You better get
rich or die trying."

363
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,554
I told her, "Fuck you.
Go get the manager."

364
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,057
"I don't wanna talk to you. You don't
own the fucking child support place."

365
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,101
Yeah, shit.

366
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,939
During the pandemic, I was watching
<i>The Verzus. </i>That was pretty good.

367
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,152
Yeah, the best one was Bobby
Brown and-and Keith Sweat.

368
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,821
I thought Bobby Brown was
fittin' to die, but that nigga…

369
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,419
I said, "They better get
a paramedic out there

370
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,422
for this fat ass on the side of
that motherfucking building."

371
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,093
I love Bobby Brown,
though. I love Bobby Brown.

372
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,387
Yeah, yeah, shit.

373
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,557
Keith Sweat came out there with
that little Aladdin jacket on.

374
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:30,148
He got a permanent hunch in his back
from fucking aunties in the '80s.

375
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,487
He fucked over 300 aunties
in his whole career.

376
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,452
He might've got your
auntie. He was at Faces.

377
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,916
Mike Jones and Tandy, all
them niggas was at Faces.

378
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,924
There's a lot of young
grandmas out here, y'all.

379
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,052
These grandmas
nowadays, oh my God.

380
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,098
They ain't… y'all not gonna
be like our grandmas now.

381
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:05,809
Don't forget.

382
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,395
Our grandmas was
listening to Natalie Cole.

383
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,856
Y'all listening to
Megan Thee Stallion.

384
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,862
So you know what kind of
grandma that's gonna be.

385
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,741
"Baby, we was twerking
like a motherfucker."

386
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,788
"I had niggas in my DMs
like a motherfucker."

387
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,674
"Me and Rose went to
a Cardi B concert."

388
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,757
"We had a ball."

389
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,597
"Not Rose."

390
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,309
"Me and Laquisha went, though."

391
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,524
"Remember 90-years-old
Laquisha."

392
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,821
"Me and Laquisha
had a ball, bitch."

393
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,582
Eighty-three-year-old peaches.

394
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,505
Yeah, that's some real
shit, man, you know?

395
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,133
All these beautiful
ladies in here.

396
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,844
If you beautiful and you
know it, make some noise.

397
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,927
Come on.

398
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,767
Yeah, where's your confidence
at? Where's your confidence at?

399
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,688
If you beautiful and don't
know it, make some noise.

400
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,693
Okay, one dumb
broad right there.

401
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,777
Just…

402
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,239
She had to say something. I
thought she didn't know it.

403
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,619
If you're not beautiful at all…

404
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,250
But your confidence
is through the roof,

405
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,380
and guys be trying to sneak
and fuck you, make some noise.

406
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,465
Yeah!

407
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,472
One guy said, "Yeah!"

408
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,932
Yeah!

409
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,350
Shut up, nigga, shit.

410
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,271
'Cause all the girls
that look like Beyoncé,

411
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,066
they got money, be sitting
in the corner just quiet.

412
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,693
Ain't having no fun.

413
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,364
All the bitches that look like Kirk
Franklin, these bitches got bottles.

414
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,742
You got sections and
every motherfucking thing.

415
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,418
Yeah.

416
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,630
It's hard being in show
business, man, you know.

417
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,425
'Cause everybody wants
something from you, you know.

418
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,178
You wanna give it to them,
but you don't have enough.

419
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,143
'Cause that's
fucked up, you know.

420
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,564
That's how Black people are. We
be all... You go to a picnic.

421
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,400
You be famous and shit.
Everybody be happy to see you.

422
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,945
There be one nigga in the corner
eating looking at you like, "Yeah."

423
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,294
What the fuck is wrong
with him over there?

424
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,757
"Yeah, I need to holler
shit for a minute for you."

425
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,096
Yeah.

426
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,141
I be walking in Indianapolis.
This is the only place I can come,

427
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,018
motherfuckers keep
it real with me.

428
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,521
Everywhere I go, people be happy
to see me. "Mike Epps, Mike Epps!"

429
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,274
I come to Indianapolis, man,

430
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,357
I...

431
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,904
I'm in the grocery store.
Motherfuckers just walk up.

432
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,656
"You still telling them
corny-ass jokes up there?"

433
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,620
That's why the fuck I don't come back
to the area. You niggas is haters, man.

434
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,545
Yeah, that's some real
shit, man, you know?

435
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,213
Y'all got a lot of
nice-looking ladies.

436
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,842
I tell guys all the time, "Don't
fuck a girl with Uggs on."

437
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,222
Girls that wear Uggs are
hoes. One, uh, uh, uh…

438
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,059
Yeah, that lion color Ugg?

439
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,142
That's…

440
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,772
That's a ho right there.

441
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,524
That sable Ugg?

442
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,361
Them is hoes right there.

443
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,823
They'll fuck you in
the back of Arby's.

444
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,866
Big roast beef.

445
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,971
I remember I got robbed in
Indiana when I was young.

446
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,639
Niggas put me in the trunk.

447
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,643
They was about to kill
me. I'm telling you.

448
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,522
As soon as they cut the
music off, I was like…

449
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,149
They was like, "What?" I
was like, "Play that again."

450
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,778
They was like, "You better
shut the fuck up back there!"

451
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,836
Bill Cosby's out.

452
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,919
Yeah.

453
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,259
Yeah, see, I wanna
be with Bill Cosby.

454
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,638
But I remember he was talking about
brothers wearing their pants sagging.

455
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,683
He really, you know, he
really wasn't with us.

456
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,059
He was, but he wasn't.

457
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,229
But he went down, you know.

458
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,690
And it was all white
women that told on him.

459
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,860
That's what was fucked
up, all white girls.

460
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,404
You seen the
interviews they did.

461
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,825
Yeah. A bunch of white
girls told on him and shit.

462
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,703
I just seen him in Atlanta
about, about two weeks ago.

463
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,066
I seen him down there at Macy's.

464
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,583
He was buying some sweaters.
He had some tank tops and shit.

465
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,632
He had a mask. He didn't know I seen
him, but I know his little moves.

466
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:16,387
Remember from the TV show.

467
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,639
That's how he was
turning around in there.

468
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,687
I told my boy,
"That's Bill Cosby."

469
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,233
I was just fucking with
him. I walked past quick.

470
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,153
I said, "Where the hoes
at?" He was just, "Hey!"

471
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,826
"Where are the hoes?"

472
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,664
Bill Cosby, he was knocking
out all white women, though.

473
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,041
It was all white girls.

474
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,127
You seen the white girls on the
interview. They told on Bill.

475
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,923
He was knocking out all white girls.
Poor white women, he was knocking 'em...

476
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,966
"Oh, Bill!"

477
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,261
He was…

478
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,642
He tried to knock
some Black women out,

479
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,144
but they drink every
night. Tolerance too high.

480
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,650
He put four pills in
a Black girl's drink.

481
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,611
She talkin' about, "What? Something
supposed to be wrong with me?"

482
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,489
"You're gonna be dead, bitch,

483
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,325
all the pills I just put in
your motherfucking drink."

484
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,547
They locking all the Black
men up, you know what I mean?

485
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,630
Fucking Weinstein.

486
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,175
He thought he was gonna
get off 'cause he was sick.

487
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,595
Every time he come to court,
he couldn't walk. He like this…

488
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,227
They said, "Get on
in here. We got a…".

489
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,149
"We got a medical ward
in the prison too."

490
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,360
"You going to jail, white boy."

491
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,868
R. Kelly man, damn. What a
singing motherfucker, oh man.

492
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,245
Singing-ass nigga right there.

493
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,082
Who was gonna beat R.
Kelly in <i>The Verzus?</i>

494
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,001
Nobody.

495
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,921
No, I'll tell you who
would've beat him.

496
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,005
A judge.

497
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,598
A judge would have
tore his ass up.

498
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,643
Yeah, that's some real shit.

499
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,772
'Cause I'm from Indiana. You
know how this town can be, right?

500
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,065
But I'm gonna be honest.

501
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,277
I'm so tired of acting like
I don't like white people.

502
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,080
I only do it in front
of Black people.

503
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,175
White people, if you heard some
of the shit I said about you

504
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,052
when I was around Black people…

505
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:13,105
And then I go back to my gated community
and hug my neighbor Bob and his wife Cindy

506
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,149
and tell him, "I love you, Bob."

507
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,696
I'm a fake-ass nigga, y'all.

508
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,793
Soon as Black people get some money,
they don't wanna be around Black people.

509
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,839
"Nuh-uh, get them niggas away from me.
I don't deal with no Black people."

510
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,924
"Fuck that shit."

511
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,762
"Niggas are so dinky."

512
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,473
"Them some niggas? Get them
niggas away from here."

513
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,475
"I don't deal with no niggas."

514
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,565
Yeah, that's some real
shit, man, you know.

515
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,902
See all these young
girls in here.

516
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:04,115
Young girls, y'all need to hang with
nothing but Tina Turners, older women

517
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,158
from Haughville.

518
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,535
Tina Turners and-and

519
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,203
Betty Wrights.

520
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,415
Older women know how to
ask you for something.

521
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,835
Young women don't know how to ask for
no money after they gave you coochie.

522
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,421
Older women know how
to ask for that money.

523
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,756
This how an older woman
ask for some money.

524
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,802
"I was wondering, since we
spent a couple hours together,

525
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,263
seemed like you
enjoyed yourself."

526
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,100
"If you have it on your heart
to do something nice for me

527
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:35,855
so I can get my nails and my
toes done, a few other things."

528
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,735
How you gonna tell this motherfucker
no if she done said shit like this?

529
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,905
This is how young
girls ask for money.

530
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,700
"You still gonna do what
you said you gonna do, OG?"

531
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,541
"I gotta give you $200
<i>and </i>take an antibiotic?"

532
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,543
"Bitch, don't come back.
I don't give a fuck."

533
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,425
Yeah, that's some real shit.

534
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,469
"Period." That's
what young girls say.

535
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,304
"Period."

536
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,556
"Per..."

537
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,851
I can't get with the
young audience. "Period!"

538
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,022
And my kids, they just dance.

539
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,609
I'm talking about these young
kids with these dances and shit.

540
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,951
"Stop fucking moving around me!"

541
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,736
One of my daughters did it like…

542
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,460
I'm like, "Hey! That
ain't no dance, is it?"

543
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,003
"This shit right here?"

544
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,758
That'd got you hit in
your eye back in the day.

545
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,804
Acting like you finna
hit a motherfucker.

546
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,184
Yeah, man, I grew up in
Indianapolis, you know what I mean.

547
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,228
Busting fire hydrants and shit.

548
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,314
Going to free lunch programs

549
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,191
at School 48.

550
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,567
Yeah.

551
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,322
The, uh, Diagnostic Center.

552
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:17,581
I love everything about Indianapolis.
This is a beautiful town right here, man.

553
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,337
This city right here
definitely made me, man.

554
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,880
You know what I mean?

555
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,964
Yeah.

556
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,094
Yeah, this show was dedicated
to my mother and father.

557
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,972
I lost both of them last year,
you know what I mean? So…

558
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,642
They are real
Indianapolis natives.

559
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,853
Mary Reed, Tommy Epps.

560
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,689
My father worked at
Navistar for 40 years.

561
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,822
Yeah, my mother used
to work at Blocks.

562
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,658
Yeah.

563
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,826
You remember Blocks?

564
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,369
Yeah!

565
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,706
- You remember them big Spiegel's catalogs?
- Yeah!

566
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,542
You'd be ordering shit
out of there, yeah.

567
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,670
That's good old Indianapolis
right there for you, man.

568
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,173
Sammy Terry. Ooh!

569
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:12,303
"Good evening and
welcome to Sammy Terry."

570
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,056
He used to have me with
my underwear, "Ah!"

571
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,683
"Sammy Terry gonna get you!"

572
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:22,855
That's how my mother made me go to
bed. "Sammy Terry gonna get you."

573
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,649
Yeah, man. Everybody don't
know about Indianapolis,

574
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,235
but it's more than corn
here. You know what I mean?

575
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,576
Real smart, intelligent,
educated people, man,

576
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,119
and some real good hustlers.

577
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,454
You know what I mean? Yeah.

578
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,706
I learned how to
hustle here, you know?

579
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,708
Yeah. 'Cause I
used to sell candy,

580
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,212
but I hated going on 30th and
Clifton 'cause they'd take the box.

581
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,175
I know everybody
in here personally.

582
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,847
So I'm in here. All this

583
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,184
Hollywood shit I'm doing
is for the cameras.

584
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
Yeah.

585
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:08,275
My dad, Tommy Epps, he used to hang
at The Grand all the time, you know.

586
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,278
Yeah, he used to hang at The
Grand. That was his spot.

587
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,780
One time I was in jail.

588
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,990
I was in jail, 'cause,
you know, I was young.

589
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,617
You know when you
young and Black,

590
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,536
you know, the older
guys get out of prison.

591
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,913
They sell prison to you
real good, you know.

592
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:26,252
"I was up there in Pendleton for two
years and then another three years."

593
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,547
"Then I did five
years down in Wabash."

594
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,677
They make it sound good. You like, "I
gotta go. Shit, I gotta go check this."

595
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,554
"I gotta check this shit out."

596
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,933
Yeah, I was in jail one time.

597
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,185
I was telling my dad
'cause I ran into an OG.

598
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,395
He was talking good.

599
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,272
He was talking
about the white man.

600
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,358
"Yeah, the white man is the
reason why you in here."

601
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,487
I was thinking, I was like,
"No, I did that shit."

602
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,783
He caught me. The
white man caught me.

603
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,999
And he was an OG.

604
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,752
He was sitting there telling me about
all this shit, and I called my dad.

605
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,006
I was like, "Dad, man,
I'm in here with a dude."

606
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,884
"He is so smart,
this dude. Oh God."

607
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,636
"He is a real OG."

608
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,223
My dad was like, "Yeah, shit."

609
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,976
"He ain't too smart.
He's in there with you."

610
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:33,402
I was like, "All right, Dad. I gotta go.
They about to cut the phones off. Bye."

611
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,781
Yeah, my dad had a
good sense of humor.

612
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,116
One day he called me.

613
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,702
He was talking about some
kids that robbed the bank.

614
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,372
He was like, "Yeah, some motherfuckers
robbed a bank in Indiana and shit."

615
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,832
He said, "Man…".

616
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:50,294
He said, "The news people asked
the kids 'What made you do that?'"

617
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,630
He said, "One of the
kids said, 'Shit, man,"

618
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,298
we was watching <i>Heat</i>

619
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,382
and we just said,

620
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,384
"we just said, fuck it.'"

621
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,511
My dad said,

622
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:04,058
"Shit, they must've not watched
the ending of that motherfucker."

623
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,603
Now, they got fucked up!

624
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,315
Yeah, shit.

625
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,152
My mother, she used to go to
them fucking PTA meetings.

626
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,739
Them teachers be
lying on you and shit.

627
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,451
You ever see your mother
talking to a teacher

628
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,495
and you just looking
at your mother like…

629
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,875
"I'm gonna tear your
ass up later on."

630
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,753
Yeah.

631
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,716
My mother used to talk about she
was gonna kick the teacher's ass.

632
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,928
"I'm gonna let that bitch know.
I'm gonna let her have it."

633
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,431
And get up here and be nice.
"Okay, bye-bye, excellent."

634
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,018
"Get your ass in the car!" I'm like,
"What the fuck did she tell you?"

635
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,646
Yeah.

636
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,192
And see, now that I'm grown,
man, I got my life together,

637
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,319
I like admitting shit, you know.

638
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,823
I mean, it ain't quite together.

639
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,741
You know.

640
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,037
But, you know, I ain't
doing what I used to do.

641
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,872
You know what I mean?

642
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,668
To be from Indianapolis,
you know what I mean,

643
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,254
to come up out of this
motherfucker right here?

644
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,302
This is a bad boy right here. You
don't know it 'cause you live here.

645
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,595
You don't go nowhere.

646
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:29,351
I mean, some of y'all do, but this
is a bad motherfucker right here.

647
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,852
You know.

648
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,981
No... no high
school, uh, diploma.

649
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,900
You know, three felonies.

650
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,111
Food stamps.

651
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,530
Kaboom cereal.

652
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,575
King Vitamin.

653
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,619
How in the fuck did we make it?

654
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,581
You know what I mean?

655
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,293
'Cause the Black man been
through so motherfucking much,

656
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,670
the white, you could
just talk about shit,

657
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,314
talk about white people all day,
and they'll say, "I understand."

658
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,341
"I really understand. I get it."

659
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,093
"I understand."

660
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:11,185
But the Black man is a bad motherfucker
in America. You hear me? You know?

661
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,062
A bad motherfucker.

662
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:20,068
To start on zero and still
win, you a bad motherfucker.

663
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,367
That's why we need
Mayor Hogsett.

664
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,913
Yeah, he like the
people, know what I mean?

665
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,457
We need a... an
abolitionist with us.

666
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:42,049
We need a white Frederick Douglass
right here in Indianapolis.

667
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,221
"Come on! Hurry up!"

668
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,557
"Here they come!
Get out of here!"

669
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,609
My man André Carson,
straight out of the hood.

670
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,241
Got a seat at the... on
the... At the White House.

671
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,201
That's some good
shit right there.

672
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:14,081
My man Amp Harris, man
been throwing parties and

673
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,084
helping the community forever.

674
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,420
My man "Boom Boom" Mancini,
good brother right there.

675
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,882
Straight out of the community,
straight out of the hood. Mike Jones.

676
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,176
My man Red Slaughter

677
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,679
The Bradley family,
you know what I mean?

678
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:33,267
All my brothers and sisters,
the whole east side, Haughville.

679
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:41,233
'Cause I know y'all seen my new
Netflix TV show, you know what I mean?

680
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,363
Based out of Indianapolis.

681
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,160
Monty was like, "Yeah, I see you got
you a new show with Tommy Davidson."

682
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,787
I said, "That's Wanda Sykes."

683
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,719
Yeah, 'cause these little
young dudes, man. They… Woof!

684
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,263
Ooh.

685
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,432
They need some help.
That's what they need.

686
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,392
Yeah.

687
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,478
'Cause these little kids
are disrespectful nowadays.

688
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,564
Little motherfuckers.

689
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,776
Like I said, the grandmas is
different, you know what I'm saying?

690
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,905
Yeah, the fucking grandmas
is different, man, shit.

691
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,283
Remember, back in the day, them
grandmas in our neighborhood…

692
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,745
You catch eye contact with an old lady,
she say, "Go to the store for me."

693
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,834
Oh shit. Now you gotta follow
this old-ass lady in the house.

694
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,712
House hot as hell.

695
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,134
"Let me show you.
It cost $1.89."

696
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,513
"Come here. I'm gonna show you
what it is. Come on up here."

697
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,976
"Reach up there and get that
out of there right there."

698
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,231
"It's back there by
the orange juice."

699
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,693
"And... and baby,
get you something."

700
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,196
"Get you something."

701
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:15,077
"I'm gonna get me something. You
might not get all your shit."

702
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,206
That's what I do to old ladies
around. I take their money.

703
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,253
Yeah, that's some
real shit, man.

704
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,017
But I love telling
jokes, know what I mean?

705
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,217
I can't see myself doing
anything else, you know?

706
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:34,846
Yeah. These little young dudes around
here, they are scary, you know.

707
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,600
I was at a gas station the other day.
Some young dudes was sitting in the car.

708
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,727
I know they was talking
'cause they was laughing.

709
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,371
I was like, "What
the fuck is fun... ".

710
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,731
Soon as I walked back,
'cause I have some braids.

711
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,609
Motherfucker was like, "Tight
braid head ass." I was like…

712
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,657
I heard it, but I was like,
"Fuck them motherfuckers."

713
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,034
I just went in the gas station.

714
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,372
Man, I walk out, and I
hear another motherfucker,

715
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,456
"Big short ass."

716
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,624
I said, "Oh hell no."

717
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,171
I walk up to the car,
I look down across,

718
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,465
say, "Little motherfucker!
Let me tell…".

719
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,677
And when I look, they had a
machine gun in the back seat.

720
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,723
I said, "God bless you, little brother.
Y'all have a good day. Take it easy."

721
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,563
Let me get the fuck
away from here, shit.

722
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,525
That was a good thing
Dave Chappelle did.

723
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:32,112
But I wouldn't advise a motherfucker
that ain't got no money to do it.

724
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,075
Fuck around and say
something about the LGBTQTs.

725
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,452
You better have some money.

726
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,332
Say the wrong shit about
them, them fuckers be outside.

727
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,667
"Fuck Mike Epps!"

728
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,210
"Fuck Mike Epps!"

729
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,837
"Fuck Mike Epps!"

730
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,506
And mean it too.

731
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,559
I tell men all the
time, "Hey, man."

732
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,437
"Don't be angry
about gay people."

733
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,191
"'Cause if you too angry, it
look like you hiding something."

734
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,532
They don't bother me, no.

735
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,452
I see them all time. I'll
see 'em at the airport…

736
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:21,870
"Mike Epps!"

737
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,748
I was like, "Calm down.
First of all, calm down."

738
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,918
"Stop making all
the goddamn noise

739
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,837
so everybody see us over here."

740
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:36,551
"I wanna take a picture with you."
I said, "I'm taking a picture, man."

741
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,475
I'm looking around.
I was like, "Man."

742
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,896
We finna take the
picture. Everything cool.

743
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,899
Something told me look
down, so I looked.

744
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,442
He taking a picture looking.

745
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,403
I said, "No, nigga. We ain't
taking that picture right there."

746
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:59,407
"With your face looking at me,
nigga, we ain't doing that one."

747
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,121
He finna have me on
<i>Entertainment Tonight,</i> nigga.

748
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,717
I got married again, you know.

749
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,427
I got a new wife, you know.

750
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,934
Hope I don't fuck
this one up, you know.

751
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,274
Yeah, man, being married
is a motherfucker, man.

752
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,957
Especially when you're
in show business.

753
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,487
'Cause pussy just fall
out the sky. Hey, hey!

754
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,792
You gotta step over. "Excuse
me, pussy. I'm gone."

755
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,627
"Gonna fuck my life up."

756
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,132
I love being Black, man.

757
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,260
If I died and came back, I still wanna
be a nigga. Ain't that something?

758
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,727
Look at the white people. "You
sure you wanna do that again?"

759
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,735
You goddamn right.

760
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,991
It's hard being Black, but it's fair,
'cause when you Black in America,

761
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:27,120
shit, you know you start off
on zero, you know what I mean?

762
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,540
You don't never start
off on ten, you know.

763
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:34,294
You need people that started off
on ten to help your zero ass.

764
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,633
You know what I mean? So,
yeah, it's hard being Black.

765
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,010
Black people been through
so motherfucking much that

766
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:45,722
white people, if you talk about them,
they'll just say, "I understand."

767
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,807
"Go ahead. Go right ahead."

768
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,852
"You guys, it's unfair.
Go right ahead."

769
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:52,812
"I understand."

770
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,483
Yeah, shit.

771
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,276
African-American,

772
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,072
shit, 'cause everybody got
somewhere to go but us.

773
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,616
If the Mexican get mad,
he can go back to Mexico.

774
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,201
If... if… Yeah.

775
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,412
If the Asian get mad,
he can go back to Asia.

776
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,916
If we get mad, we ain't got
no motherfucking where to go.

777
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,920
I thought it was Africa until
I went. Motherfucker was like,

778
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:20,090
"You are not one of
my real brothers."

779
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,300
I was like, "What?"

780
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,388
"Yes, my brother. You are
not one of my brothers."

781
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,890
"You are very lazy."

782
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,643
"You do not take advantage
of your education."

783
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,651
I said, "Can you drive
this cab a little faster?"

784
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,072
"And get some deodorant
immediately…."

785
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,953
"With your over-educated,
underpaid ass."

786
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,124
Everybody think they going
to heaven, and they're not.

787
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,670
God knows your
crooked Christian ass.

788
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,676
And if anybody ever left here
before you and went to heaven,

789
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,512
I don't care if it's your mama,
your daddy, brother, sister, cousin…

790
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,472
They went so you could get in.

791
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,810
'Cause you wasn't getting
in. You wasn't invited.

792
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,063
It's who you know.

793
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,198
As soon as you get to heaven, man,
the pearly gates are standing there

794
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,784
and everybody wanna get in. It's
like a club. You can't get in.

795
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,244
Everybody's trying to get in.

796
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,957
The big bodyguards are standing there,
and Jesus come out like a promoter.

797
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,709
He let all the bad bitches in.

798
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,793
"Let her in."

799
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:42,047
"Them two right there. Let
that girl in right there."

800
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,798
"Let the two girls."

801
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,426
"Oh, I'll text you."

802
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,095
Yeah.

803
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,474
You wasn't going to heaven.

804
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,809
But all them Black
ghetto mothers in heaven,

805
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:58,605
they've been letting their sons
in. They got a side door up there.

806
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:03,526
Them Black mothers been lettin' them,
"Come on, baby, come on. Get in here!"

807
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,945
"You smell like weed. Come on!"

808
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,199
"Put the wings on.
Put the wings on."

809
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,617
"Zip it up. Flap, flap!"

810
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,286
"Act like you're a angel."

811
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,123
I love y'all, Indianapolis.
God bless y'all.

812
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,504
I'll see you
motherfuckers on Netflix.

813
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,511
Naptown!

814
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,520
I need the mayor, Joe
Hogsett, to come to the stage.

815
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,199
I'm proud to declare
November 20, 2021

816
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,077

817
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,788
in the city of Indianapolis!

818
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,999
And last but not least.

819
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,667
I need.

820
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,671
Congressman André Carson
to come to the stage.

821
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,970
You will be etched

822
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,890
in the Congressional Record of the
United States Congress forever,

823
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,185
acknowledging your contributions

824
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,562
as a comedian,

825
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:21,729
producer,

826
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,690
actor, entrepreneur,

827
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,483
and most importantly a Hoosier.

828
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,651
We love you, Mike.

829
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,114
I'm putting you on notice. We need
a street named after Mike Epps.

830
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,078
We got Coach Mike Woodson
in the house tonight!

831
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,080
Mike Woodson!

832
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,375
My man, Woody, right there, man.

833
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,087
Straight out of
Indianapolis, yo.

834
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,259
I-I just, I like,

835
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,803
I just wanna thank
you, you know.

836
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,307
And thank all my
friends and family.

837
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,726
I love you all, man.

838
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,436
Thank you. Uh...

839
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,189
I'm grateful, man.

840
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,817
I'm grateful... I'm grateful that
I can come back home like this.

841
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,820
Everybody can't come home.
You know what I mean?

842
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,864
So to be able to come home,

843
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:17,035
this means everything to me,
y'all, and I really appreciate it.

844
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:20,288
Does anybody have a Backwood
out there that I can…
