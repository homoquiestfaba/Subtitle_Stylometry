PREACHER BOB: Every morning, god visits me for breakfast.

3
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:27,079
And although you can't hear him, I

4
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,788
will share this verse with you.

5
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:34,757
This morning, God and I are playing "Guess What It Is."

6
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:38,927
I read the ingredients and God tells me what it is.

7
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,733
Are you ready, God?

8
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:42,678
He can't wait.

9
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:44,485
Well, here goes.

10
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:50,114
Sodium, iron sulfate, water, black hall stingray,

hydroxine-- frabble-- fromonium?

12
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:53,519
Whoa.

13
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:56,889
I can't even pronounce that.

The FCC won't even let religious broadcast

18
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:07,867
get away with words like that.

19
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,500
I'll skip it.

20
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:10,925
What was that?

No.

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,985
Well, maybe they do have those ingredients,

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,035
but it's not the one.

26
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,460
I'll give you a hint.

27
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:24,510
It's metal.

Is everybody ready?

00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,450
Ugh. Summer in the country.

41
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:03,944
Yeah, your uncle's great.

42
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:04,812
He's crazy.

43
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,341
My mother's crazy.

44
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:08,079
I can't believe she thought this would be good for me.

45

What, you're not having fun yet?

46

Hey, wait till we jump.

You just stop that, Mr. Jackson.

All right, everybody.

50
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,331
Fall out.

51

Now remember, head for the pasture out by the air field.

Duane's the one always getting lost.

Yee haw!

58
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,740
Get a move on!

Woo hoo!

I love you, baby!

61
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,207
Open your chute!

62
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,423
Anything for you, baby.

63
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:43,969
Something's wrong.

64
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:45,602
His chute isn't opening.

65
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:46,818
You try it.

66
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:51,821

00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:03,599
Grab onto me.

They're turning a proper chute.

73
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:19,824
I said, grab on.

74
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,284
Won't work. I'm too heavy.

75
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,499
We got to try.

76
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:36,466
Take hold.

77
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:37,405
Hold on tight.

78
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:38,551
It'll never work.

79
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:46,263
Goodbye, my love.

80
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,896

00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:25,913
That schmuck's dumping shit all over the place.

193
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:27,268
It exploded.

194
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,526
Buddy tried to kill us.

195
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,611
You're lucky he found you before I did.

196
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,070
I'm not kidding, damn it.

197
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,286
Don't curse me.

198
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:35,328
You disobeyed orders.

199
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:36,752
Uncle Jack, you got to listen to him.

200
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:37,865
I told you to shut up.

201
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:39,464
Who are you to give orders?

202
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,312
Pretty pathetic for someone that got kicked out of the Army.

203
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:46,064
That had nothing to do with orders.

204
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,913
I thought you won the Purple Heart?

205
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,060
I did.

206
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:52,839
And you got kicked out?

207
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:56,348
All those war stories were just lies.

208
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,634
Everybody thinks you're a hero.

209
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,406
You're just a coward.

210
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,428
And you won't even listen to us. Go to hell.

211
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:21,259
All right, Clem.

212
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,169
What happened to Billy?

213
00:13:23,274 --> 00:13:24,768
You know that dumb tard Billy.

214
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:27,895
He's out there trying to cook some wieners.

215
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:30,814
Wait, or was it marshmallows?

216
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,106
Wieners, god damn it.

217
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,025
The police will have all day for you to remember the facts.

218
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:41,515
Well, that moron's out there squirting the fluid up

219
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:44,015
in the air, trying to hit the coals.

220
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,350
But all he did was spray his fool self.

221
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,818
I couldn't believe when he lit the match.

222
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:54,473
I yelled out, no, no, no.

223
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:55,446
That's great.

224
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:57,739
Very good, Clem.

225
00:13:57,844 --> 00:14:00,624
I might even have to give you a raise.

226
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:01,874
Gee, thanks.

227
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:04,237
You're a real pal, Buddy.

228
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:06,842
Let's keep an eye on those kids.

229
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,316
We can't them going around town yakking about this.

230
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,972
That Duane boy is Barbara and Daryl's kid.

231
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:17,368
They're the ones who've been making the big stink.

232
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,793
Them dopes.

233
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:22,442
This stuff ain't dangerous, as long as you handle it right.

234
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:23,589
Yes, sir.

235
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:25,360
No more dangerous than walking the street.

236
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,583
Isn't that just like you told us, Buddy?

237
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:29,216
Would I lie to you?

238
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,745
Don't worry, Buddy.

239
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,621
I'll keep an eye on things.

240
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:33,977
This might be fun.

241
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:41,585
[burp]

242
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,113
Jesus, Wade.

243
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:45,406
Will you say excuse me, Wade?

244
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,241
[laughter]

245
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,360
It wasn't me.

246
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:49,784
OK, I'm sorry.

247
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:50,758
Excuse me.

248
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,046
[radio squealing]

249
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,360
Uncle Jack, aren't there any rock and roll stations?

250
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:14,626
Preacher Bob's the only one.

251
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,579
Oh, this is going to be a long summer.

252
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,594
PREACHER BOB: Hey, all you alley cats.

253
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:23,311
Have you all been over-indulging and living a life of sin?

254
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,924
It's not nice to croon around the back door waiting

255
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:29,426
for Mrs. X's honey to leave.

256
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,109
The Church of God would like to remind you that coveting

257
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:36,132
another man's wife is a sin.

258
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,599
Just remember-- one of these days,

259
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:41,864
one of the people throwing shoes at you, alley cats,

260
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:43,914
might be God.

261
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,382
[laughter]

262
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:48,396
You wouldn't be laughing so hard

263
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,272
if your man had cheated on you.

264
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,321
You been drinking that Freon again, Willy?

265
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:01,320
Never could stay mad at us very long.

266
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:04,343
Look, Uncle Jack, I'm sorry about what happened.

267
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,803
That's all right, but listen, you ever

268
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:08,165
pull a fool stunt like that again I'll tan your hide

269
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,284
and I'll ring Duane's neck.

270
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,257
That guy?

271
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,473
He has the IQ of a grape.

272
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:13,758
What a yokel.

273
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:15,426
You know, he's not as dumb as he looks.

274
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,094
That's country wisdom.

275
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,796
Spare me.

276
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,638
Look, Uncle Jack, we weren't joking

277
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,339
about what happened out there.

278
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:24,147
That guy, Buddy, you know the one

279
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,745
that looks like he's on drugs?

280
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:27,830
He pulled a gun on Duane.

281
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:31,269
And then some serious-- this stuff blew up

282
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:34,639
and then some retard guy got toasted.

283
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,993
I'll see about it.

284
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:40,927
Just relax, Darryl.

285
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:42,561
You need to have a few more tests.

286
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:44,714
We have to get to the bottom of this, but we're getting close.

287
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:45,896
Yeah.

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,113
You've been getting close for years.

289
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,467
[radio squealing]

290
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:49,369
PREACHER BOB: Speak of the cross of humanity--

291
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:50,968
Will you turn that off?

292
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:54,061
PREACHER BOB: And some day you sinners man yourselves on--

293
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:54,999
Yeah, we did.

294
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:56,215
It's really crazy though.

295
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,639
We landed in Buddy's.

296
00:16:57,744 --> 00:16:59,098
He was really upset.

297
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,461
Son, stay away from Buddy.

298
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:03,059
He's bad news.

299
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,040
The reason your father's in here is because of that stuff

300
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:06,568
Buddy had them haul all those years.

301
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,062
Now Barbara, we don't know that.

302
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,973
Oh, you guys, I think Billy's hurt.

303
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,544
They were dumping some stuff and it caught on fire.

304
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,038
You mind me--

305
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:15,150
don't mess with Buddy.

306
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:16,678
Dad, you don't understand--

307
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:17,651
[coughing]

308
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:20,187
Honey, don't upset your father.

309
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,369
It'll be all right, dad.

310
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,140
Take it easy.

311
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:25,121
Don't worry about me.

312
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,684
I'll be fine.

313
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,248
I'm strong as a horse.

314
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:45,029
You let Jack take care of Buddy.

315
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,695
Mom, that guy's full of it.

316
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:47,912
I talked to his niece.

317
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:49,233
You know he got kicked out of the Army?

318
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:50,170
Yeah.

319
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:51,907
You know why, hm?

320
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,027
There was a Lieutenant and one day

321
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:56,563
he just snapped and he started shooting

322
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:58,161
all these innocent civilians.

323
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,899
Well, Jack had to do something.

324
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,219
The guy was crazy.

325
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:02,574
He was out of his mind.

326
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:04,658
Then he starts trying to shoot at Jack.

327
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:06,257
He had to do something.

328
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,029
You mean Jack shot one of his own men?

329
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,071
Yeah.

330
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,982
And then poor Jack gets canned.

331
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:15,219
But I'll tell you, he did the right thing.

332
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:16,888
Why didn't he just say so?

333
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:18,104
Did you give him a chance?

334
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,690
[airplane engines]

335
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:24,357
Hey, Duane.

336
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:34,016
Look, uh, about what I said, I'm really sorry.

337
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:36,101
I was mad. - Ah, it's OK.

338
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,074
No.

339
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:38,220
No, it's not.

340
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:40,166
I had no right to say those things to you.

341
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,424
It took a lot of guts to do what you did.

342
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:43,502
I talked to my mom.

343
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:44,543
Your mother said that?

344
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:45,898
Yeah.

345
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:48,747
I promise, no more crazy stunts like that again.

346
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:50,901
I was just showing off.

347
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,438
Your father's a lucky man.

348
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:54,758
By the way, how is he?

349
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:56,009
He's doing OK.

350
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:59,587
They're running all those tests on him now though.

351
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:01,359
You know, I owe you an apology, too.

352
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:04,035
I should have listened.

353
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:06,501
I think Sheriff Horne might be interested

354
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:07,439
in your little story.

355
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,858
So how's the project, Buddy?

356
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:23,421
Everything's all right by the book, right?

357
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,567
Naturally.

358
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:28,946
To the book.

359
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,334
[ringing]

360
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:36,172
The purple window sash?

361
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:36,971
Purple?

362
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,152
Hey, look, you nimrod.

363
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:39,855
I told you that I wanted mauve.

364
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:40,792
Mauve.

365
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:44,962
M-A-U-V-E. You understand?

366
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:45,934
Goodbye.

367
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,779
So the time has come, Buddy.

368
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:56,079
The heavy water starts arriving on Friday.

369
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:59,380
If there are any mistakes, we lose it.

370
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:02,889
We lose everything, Buddy.

371
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:07,059
It's the start of it all.

372
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,039
When I'm president--

373
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,568
Yeah.

374
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:13,104
So buddy, you know who I'm going to need for my Chief

375
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,077
of Staff, don't you?

376
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,014
[laughter]

377
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:16,439
I'm excited.

378
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:19,114
How about Haskel for a Secretary of War.

379
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,511
[laughter]

380
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:22,658
Yeah, Buddy. That's real funny.

381
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,595
OK?

382
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,749
I like that.

383
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:27,278
Why'd you-- do that--

384
00:20:27,382 --> 00:20:29,190
I've been hearing stories.

385
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:32,838
People are filing reports.

386
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,810
What stories?

387
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:34,923
Who?

388
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,563
Look, you go figure it before the drop time.

389
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,308
Hey, Joey, stop the car.

390
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,045
[screech]

391
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:43,747
You better deal with the problems instead

392
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,206
of creating them, Buddy.

393
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,110
Hey, think it over.

394
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:49,063
You're in it up to your ass.

395
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,487
Get the fuck out of here.

396
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:51,251
Hey--

397
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:52,641
Get the fuck outta here.

398
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:53,718
It's a long way back to town.

399
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:55,351
Yeah?

400
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:56,880
Well I think a nice, long walk might do you some good, Buddy.

401
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:57,818
Come on, man.

402
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:58,895
Give me a break.

403
00:20:58,999 --> 00:20:59,833
Give me a break.

404
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:03,029
It's a long way to town.

405
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,663
Damn that Barbara.

406
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,549
Darn.

407
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:17,031
Hot damn.

408
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:19,115
You owe me.

409
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,964
Derwood, there's not much crime in this town.

410
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:22,937
You want to know why?

411
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,119
Nope.

412
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:25,786
It's because criminals avoid me.

413
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,975
They know they never could escape.

414
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,503
Wilson, stop goofing off.

415
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:43,436
Yeah.

416
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:48,195
Well, Buddy, you know, you're a real pal--

417
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:49,689
getting them braces to help straighten out

418
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:52,954
my daughter's teeth and all.

419
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,873
Mm-hm.

420
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:58,688
Yeah, well don't you worry about a thing.

421
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:04,490
[car engine]

422
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:05,428
Buddy, I got to go.

423
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:14,461
What can I do you for?

424
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:16,511
Duane and Toni here have something to tell you.

425
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:20,054
It concerns Buddy.

426
00:22:20,158 --> 00:22:21,028
Eat it, Derwood.

427
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,648
We were skydiving the other day

428
00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:28,254
and we got knocked off course and we landed in Buddy's quarry

429
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,296
over there.

430
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,513
Now Buddy and his boys were dumping

431
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,772
some fertilizer or flagstone cleaner,

432
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,264
I think they called it.

433
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:36,488
I never smelled any fertilizer like this stuff before.

434
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:39,511
Then they pulled a gun on me and Toni over here.

435
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:41,421
Then Billy knocked some barrel over,

436
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,897
this big fire starts and he gets caught, burned.

437
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,493
Next thing you know, we're running like hell

438
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,656
because they're shooting at us.

439
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,255
[chair creaks]

440
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:55,840
All right.

441
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:57,612
Let me see if I got this correct.

442
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:04,318
You're trespassing on private property,

443
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:05,811
and when those people started defending

444
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:08,555
their basic human rights to their privacy,

445
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,954
you started fighting with them.

446
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,733
That's not what happened.

447
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:15,157
I'm not through talking yet, Missy.

448
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,396
Matter of fact, you even pulled a knife

449
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,592
on these innocent people, didn't you?

450
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:26,241
And then you used that knife to stick it in Buddy's back.

451
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:28,533
What's going on here, Ted?

452
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:30,097
Buddy pulled a gun on these kids just

453
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,529
for walking through his quarry.

454
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:36,559
It's Officer Wilson to you.

455
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:39,165
Now you listen to me.

456
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:42,222
Right now, I can book you on three charges--

457
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:45,210
trespassing, assault with a deadly weapon,

458
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:47,885
and intent to kill.

459
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:50,073
What about Billy?

460
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,846
Let me tell you something--

461
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,181
you try any more of these false accusations,

462
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:56,709
and I'm gonna throw your ass in jail

463
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:57,857
and I'm gonna throw away the key.

464
00:23:57,961 --> 00:23:59,872
You hear me? [banging]

465
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:09,183
That's disgusting.

466
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,440
That was Billy, wasn't it?

467
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:21,656
Poor kid.

468
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,956
He burnt himself toasting marshmallows.

469
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,041
That's a lie. [banging]

470
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:32,807
[laughter]

471
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:33,746
All right.

472
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,031
Now you listen to me, son.

473
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:40,695
Everybody knows that you and your whole family

474
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,169
has had it in for poor old Buddy.

475
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:48,442
So I want you to just get the hell out of here right now.

476
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:50,597
I'm trying to tell you the truth.

477
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,549
Get out.

478
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,391
Buddy must give you some fat tips.

479
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:03,590
Don't let that doorknob hit you, honey.

480
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:04,980
Hoo wee.

481
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:07,203
Feisty little bitch, Ted.

482
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:08,454
I think she likes you.

483
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:15,473
What do you expect?

484
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:16,793
He's on the payroll.

485
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:18,044
Knock it off.

486
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:20,718
You don't just sit here and take this.

487
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:21,727
I won't.

488
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:22,700
Suit yourself.

489
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,764
[radio squealing]

490
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:28,223
[organ music]

491
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:51,709
[preacher bob fades in and out]

492
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:53,308
Hey, cowards.

493
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:54,524
Come and fight.

494
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,463
Dumb suckers.

495
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,999
We're gonna nail you cross.

496
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,181
Do you hear me?

497
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:51,260
Y'all been making some serious allegations.

498
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:52,649
Yeah.

499
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:55,567
You're going to be a bunch of dead alligators.

500
00:26:55,671 --> 00:26:57,131
Prepare to die.

501
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,438
Whoa!

502
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:22,633
[engine starting]

503
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:27,184
Eat me!

504
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:28,955
I'll take this to the government.

505
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:30,553
You kids keep away from them.

506
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,138
There they are.

507
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:54,318
Wild.

508
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,043
Do you think this was such a good idea?

509
00:27:59,147 --> 00:28:00,849
What if we get caught?

510
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,170
Oh, come on, Becky.

511
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:37,677
Let's get out of here!

512
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,276
I knew this was gonna be trouble.

513
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,869
[boom]

514
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:54,354
Looks like we got some business to take care of.

515
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,327
Little snooping bastards.

516
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:58,592
Halt!

517
00:28:58,697 --> 00:28:59,808
[gunshots]

518
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:11,482
I can't believe they're dumping

519
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:12,976
that stuff in the water.

520
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,019
Yeah.

521
00:29:14,122 --> 00:29:22,427
Those sleaze-bags

522
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:23,398
Damn.

523
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:33,788
[moo]

524
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,698
Jack's not in?

525
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:36,462
No.

526
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,477
He's off investigating.

527
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:40,597
Maybe we should lay low till he gets back.

528
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:47,267
Look, I'm a mess.

529
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,700
I'm gonna go clean up.

530
00:29:49,803 --> 00:29:52,236
Hey, what do you say we go for a swim?

531
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:53,313
Actually, that might be nice.

532
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,154
I'd like to relax for a change.

533
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:57,238
Is there a pool around here?

534
00:29:57,343 --> 00:29:58,594
Well, sort of.

535
00:29:58,698 --> 00:29:59,533
It's a pond.

536
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:03,632
I don't have a suit.

537
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:04,986
Ah, you don't need one.

538
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:07,765
The have some there.

539
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:09,051
OK, I'll go with you in a second.

540
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,545
Just let me go close up the house.

541
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,692
OK.

542
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:18,919
You little liar.

543
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:21,107
You knew there weren't any suits out here.

544
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:24,269
What about your birthday suit?

545
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:25,658
Aw, now who's shy?

546
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:27,778
I thought you were a woman of the world?

547
00:30:27,882 --> 00:30:30,175
Well, I thought I could trust you.

548
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,114
Well, you thought wrong.

549
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:34,136
Come on in.

550
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,665
The water's great.

551
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:44,385
Sight for the blind.

552
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,847
You dweezle.

553
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:53,696
Did you really think I'd go skinny dipping with you?

554
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,295
Naked?

555
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,761
[laughter]

556
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:00,228
Shit.

557
00:31:00,332 --> 00:31:02,799
She's got a damn swimsuit.

558
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,571
Let me see that.

559
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:07,697
This is bad news.

560
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,122
Real bad news.

561
00:31:34,831 --> 00:31:36,743
Oh, great god in heaven.

562
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:44,178
Wow.

563
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:47,201
She's prepared for me.

564
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,528
I love a modern woman.

565
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:51,058
They're so practical.

566
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:04,954
Give that, you dump.

567
00:32:13,606 --> 00:32:16,593
Clem, this is going to be like shooting fish in a barrel.

568
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:22,048
CLEM: It's like drowning fish in a barrel.

569
00:32:22,152 --> 00:32:23,055
You moron.

570
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,550
You can't drown fish.

571
00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:47,688
Ah, Haskel.

572
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:51,997
She's prettier than a mess of fried catfish.

573
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:54,776
I just got to nibble on a piece.

574
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,097
Yeah.

575
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,606
Can't just drown them without having any fun first.

576
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:03,531
She'll go to heaven knowing a real man.

577
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:05,651
You think Buddy's gonna pay us over time

578
00:33:05,755 --> 00:33:08,430
for this kind of work?

579
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:09,577
What are we waiting for?

580
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:15,760
I see your hiney.

581
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:18,332
You're so full of shit.

582
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:20,799
Come on in.

583
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:24,238
Well, at least you're not a fag.

584
00:33:24,342 --> 00:33:26,148
I ain't no fag either, missy.

585
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:27,017
[screams]

586
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:30,700
You got a pretty little mouth.

587
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:32,368
Toni?

588
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:33,306
Toni?

589
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:40,949
Party's over, blabbermouth.

590
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:43,208
Sweet baby, I'm in the mood--

591
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:44,180
Get off of her!

592
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,744
You're next.

593
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:48,384
Too bad what happened to you two young kids at the pond.

594
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,226
Out for a day or sunning and funning

595
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,588
and just like that, down.

596
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,541
Mighty strange currents in these parts.

597
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:57,522
- Go to hell. - Shut your gab.

598
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,260
You said too much already.

599
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,163
Too bad, honey.

600
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:01,795
You could have ended up with me.

601
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,122
[gunshots]

602
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,263
Ah!

603
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,294
Two of your--

604
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:46,927
[gunshots]

605
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:50,783
HASKEL: Clem?

606
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,196
Clem?

607
00:34:58,252 --> 00:35:01,137
Clem, why'd you let her get away?

608
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:03,812
She kicked me in the nuts.

609
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:05,514
Well, get after her.

610
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:07,113
Damned thing.

611
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:09,266
Clem, you couldn't pour piss out of a boot

612
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,350
if the instructions was written on the heel.

613
00:35:20,523 --> 00:35:23,790
Kids, this is how we do things in the military

614
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:26,325
when we run into problems like this.

615
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,889
[gunshots]

616
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:33,308
Woo wee!

617
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:35,045
Take that, Charlie.

618
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:37,304
Nah, take that Clem.

619
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:39,563
It's important to use the proper channels

620
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,334
kids, but just in case--

621
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,002
Learn to shoot a gun.

622
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,843
The hell with the law.

623
00:35:44,948 --> 00:35:47,276
Christ, we could start a war with all this.

624
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,700
Yeah.

625
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:53,494
Playing with a gun makes me feel alive.

626
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:54,780
I'm worried about you, Willy.

627
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,034
[gunshots]

628
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:44,114
No, no, no.

629
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:45,227
Look, look.

630
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,373
Plant your feet, OK?

631
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:47,346
Come on.

632
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,646
[gunshots]

633
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,322
Little higher.

634
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:54,781
Little higher.

635
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:55,789
[gunshots]

636
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:56,831
That's it.

637
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:58,881
[gunshots]

638
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:05,586
Oh, darling, this is fabulous.

639
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,651
The pig's lines have such character.

640
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,354
Oh, I think it's cute.

641
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,403
[gunshots]

642
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,464
Here.

643
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:22,715
Try this one on for size.

644
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:23,688
Heh.

645
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:30,289
You understand?

646
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:32,720
If you come around here again, I'm

647
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:34,736
gonna have to use this on you.

648
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,917
[gunshots]

649
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:44,464
My country 'tis of thee--

650
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:46,756
[gunshots]

651
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:50,509
Billy, I told you once, I told you 1,000 times.

652
00:37:50,613 --> 00:37:52,386
We dogs can't sing.

653
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:54,052
[gunshots]

654
00:37:54,157 --> 00:37:55,095
Duane--

655
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,137
[gunshots]

656
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:57,249
Duane!

657
00:37:57,353 --> 00:37:58,187
Duane!

658
00:38:05,623 --> 00:38:06,838
You guys done like I told you?

659
00:38:06,943 --> 00:38:08,228
It's all ready.

660
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:10,660
Have we ever failed you?

661
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:12,259
Get out of here.

662
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:13,718
All right.

663
00:38:13,822 --> 00:38:18,164
If all goes well, by Friday, we'll be set for life.

664
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:24,939
[howling]

665
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:41,686
You know, when I first met you,

666
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,423
I thought you were a real redneck.

667
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:44,361
A redneck?

668
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:45,402
Yeah.

669
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,349
Now I guess I know you better.

670
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,051
What am I?

671
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:50,719
Don Juan?

672
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:52,004
It's Don Juan.

673
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:53,914
Don Juan. That's what I said.

674
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:55,653
Nah, you're still a redneck.

675
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:56,626
A redneck?

676
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:57,876
Yeah.

677
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,405
Pink neck.

678
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:00,342
Hey.

679
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:30,291
Mm, Cheri, come fly away with me

680
00:39:30,395 --> 00:39:32,237
and I will show you the world.

681
00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:33,558
I've seen the world.

682
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,530
Well, then.

683
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:35,746
I will show you the barn!

684
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,345
I've seen the barn, too.

685
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:38,665
Well, then.

686
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:41,096
I will show you the true meaning of love.

687
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,459
Surrender your tongue to me now.

688
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:45,509
Oh, please.

689
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:47,802
Hey, come on Mr. Farmboy.

690
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:48,948
You're getting out off hand.

691
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,624
When you say no, do you mean yes?

692
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:52,979
- No. - No?

693
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:53,951
No.

694
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:55,341
Oh, no.

695
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,278
Oh, yes!

696
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:57,808
[laughter]

697
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:58,746
Ow.

698
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,110
[clatter]

699
00:40:15,214 --> 00:40:16,152
Dag-blasted bucket.

700
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:17,194
Shh.

701
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:18,654
What's that thing doing here?

702
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:23,726
Who's out there?

703
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:28,486
Let's bushwhack him.

704
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:35,747
[whistling]

705
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:12,644
[horse neighing]

706
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:16,778
[whistling]

707
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:18,793
Hold it.

708
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:19,801
Don't shoot.

709
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,364
I was just getting a drink.

710
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:22,789
[gunshots]

711
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,353
[horse neighing]

712
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,745
Nice souvenir.

713
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,413
[laughter]

714
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:33,699
Let's skedaddle.

715
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:41,029
Uncle Jack?

716
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:41,968
Haskel.

717
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:52,078
Ow.

718
00:41:52,183 --> 00:41:53,224
Look out!

719
00:41:55,865 --> 00:41:57,810
[boom]

720
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:01,528
Those bastards.

721
00:42:04,515 --> 00:42:05,940
Buddy.

722
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:07,538
That's the last straw.

723
00:42:07,643 --> 00:42:09,241
I'm going to the source.

724
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:12,055
Now Buddy, Buddy always works for somebody

725
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,383
and I'm gonna finish him off.

726
00:42:14,486 --> 00:42:16,119
I bet you Clem would squeal.

727
00:42:16,224 --> 00:42:17,822
Yeah, maybe we should invite Clem

728
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:19,594
to his own marshmallow roast.

729
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:23,660
Nobody messes with my water and gets away with it.

730
00:42:23,763 --> 00:42:24,701
Let's go.

731
00:42:31,163 --> 00:42:33,561
Well, we shouldn't have too much trouble smelling them.

732
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:36,653
[radio squeals]

733
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:41,170
PREACHER BOB: [garbled]

734
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:42,177
God wants him.

735
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:44,679
It's the source of life.

736
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:49,959
Yes, but the Devil is casting his purpose on our very lives.

737
00:42:50,064 --> 00:42:52,914
This ain't no--

738
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:55,274
I wonder if he's been drinking the water.

739
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,916
He's attacking himself with all this stuff.

740
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,243
PREACHER BOB: Remember, only God can walk on the water.

741
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:01,112
And the hours--

742
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:03,196
Let's go check the north road.

743
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:36,029
All right.

744
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:37,454
Now you two stay here.

745
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:41,519
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you go get help.

746
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:42,665
Jesus.

747
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,659
Does he really think we'll just sit here?

748
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:56,701
Come on.

749
00:43:56,805 --> 00:43:57,639
Let's go.

750
00:44:32,451 --> 00:44:33,946
[grunting]

751
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:53,888
Get back to work.

752
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:54,826
Aw.

753
00:45:05,597 --> 00:45:07,577
Who does the work now that Billy's gone?

754
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:08,446
The work?

755
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,252
I wonder who does the thinking?

756
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:13,101
Now he brings that girl home to meet us,

757
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:17,931
and a skinny looking critter, especially for a wife.

758
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:21,440
And all's we can think is, well, Jesus--

759
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:24,670
why won't her own family marry her?

760
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:27,519
There must be something wrong with her.

761
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:30,125
Oh, yeah.

762
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:32,071
There's something wrong with that girl.

763
00:45:32,175 --> 00:45:33,842
I just know there is.

764
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:44,578
Ew.

765
00:45:44,682 --> 00:45:47,671
This stuff stinks kind of funny.

766
00:45:47,775 --> 00:45:51,388
Or likely, you need a bath.

767
00:45:51,492 --> 00:45:54,063
Haskel, you know hanging out in all this sun's

768
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:56,217
bad for your skin.

769
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,302
You read about it all the time.

770
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:00,526
You could catch cankers.

771
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,672
Hurry up.

772
00:46:01,776 --> 00:46:03,513
Well, if you just gave me a little hand,

773
00:46:03,618 --> 00:46:05,841
we might get out of here before Christmas.

774
00:46:05,945 --> 00:46:07,022
I'm supervising.

775
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:08,517
Yeah?

776
00:46:08,621 --> 00:46:10,357
Even the president's worried about it.

777
00:46:10,461 --> 00:46:12,686
Even he's using suntan lotion--

778
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:13,902
Jesus!

779
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:14,840
You!

780
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,416
No, don't shoot!

781
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,876
What the hell are you two doing here?

782
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,203
I thought I told you--

783
00:46:31,308 --> 00:46:33,844
damn kids.

784
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:35,442
Thanks.

785
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,673
Ah, we're going to take care of you.

786
00:46:38,777 --> 00:46:42,981
Yeah, real slow.

787
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:45,795
[mumbling]

788
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:47,255
TONI: You know, Haskel?

789
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,472
I think that's the most intelligent thing I've heard

790
00:46:48,576 --> 00:46:51,562
come out of your mouth yet.

791
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:53,613
You must be getting real thirsty,

792
00:46:53,717 --> 00:46:56,288
Clem, with all that hard work you've been doing, eh?

793
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:57,296
I'm not thirsty.

794
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,547
Haskel did all the work.

795
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,736
Talk to him.

796
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:02,576
[mumbling] Shut up, Clem, you weasel!

797
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:03,550
No. Don't!

798
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:05,703
I just stomped the stuff.

799
00:47:05,808 --> 00:47:08,622
Ah, you're a modest man, Clem.

800
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,158
But you know, our pal Buddy's been working hard, too.

801
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:13,138
And I'm just betting you can tell me who he's making

802
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:14,876
all of that trouble for, huh?

803
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,091
Isn't that right?

804
00:47:16,196 --> 00:47:17,169
No, don't.

805
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:20,747
I'm a family man.

806
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:22,519
I always wondered what this word caustic meant.

807
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,819
Do you know, Clem?

808
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:30,197
Clem, you better tell me who buddy works for.

809
00:47:30,301 --> 00:47:31,136
Lance!

810
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,934
Lance.

811
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,290
That's a neat name.

812
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:34,957
I'll bet he's got lots of girls.

813
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:40,168
Now who does Mr. Lance work for?

814
00:47:40,272 --> 00:47:41,767
[hisses]

815
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:42,775
Let go!

816
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,689
Thank you, Clem.

817
00:47:49,793 --> 00:47:51,426
You've been very helpful.

818
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:55,490
What do you say we take care of these guys right now?

819
00:47:55,595 --> 00:47:57,540
Ah, they'll all be in jail soon.

820
00:47:57,645 --> 00:48:01,154
Now you listen to me, Clem, you come on my property again,

821
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:02,127
I'm going to kill you.

822
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,281
I'll kill your family.

823
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:05,773
And I'll kill your little dog, too.

824
00:48:10,116 --> 00:48:12,409
You, too, Haskel.

825
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,765
[muttering]

826
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:19,116
It won't be much longer.

827
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,826
Honey, I've been waiting here for two hours.

828
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,529
He's a very busy man.

829
00:48:23,632 --> 00:48:24,500
[door opening]

830
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,561
- Is Lancey in? - Go right in.

831
00:48:42,532 --> 00:48:43,540
LANCE: Cindy, baby.

832
00:48:43,644 --> 00:48:44,861
It's good to see you.

833
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:46,215
Yeah, baby. You're looking good.

834
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,814
You're looking good. Keep it up.

835
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:49,134
Keep it up. Come on, baby.

836
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:52,399
Let me see what the good lord has given.

837
00:48:52,504 --> 00:48:54,207
Yeah, move your hands. I like that.

838
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,873
You know that, don't you? Yeah, yeah.

839
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:56,882
Put your hands to your hair.

840
00:48:56,986 --> 00:48:57,854
[phone ringing]

841
00:49:01,363 --> 00:49:02,475
Yeah. Yeah.

842
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:03,864
That's it, baby. That's it.

843
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:05,150
Come on, touch some more.

844
00:49:05,254 --> 00:49:06,436
Touch some more.

845
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,373
Mm.

846
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:10,917
Yeah, yeah.

847
00:49:11,022 --> 00:49:11,960
Put your hair up.

848
00:49:12,064 --> 00:49:13,072
Hair up, yeah.

849
00:49:13,176 --> 00:49:14,045
That's it.

850
00:49:14,149 --> 00:49:17,137
I like that.

851
00:49:17,241 --> 00:49:20,332
You ain't missing a trick, are you?

852
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:22,243
Screw this.

853
00:49:22,348 --> 00:49:23,564
Hey, wait a minute.

854
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,165
LANCE: Who the fuck are you, buddy?

855
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,798
[phone ringing]

856
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:41,769
Barbara, Barbara, Barbara-- wait a minute.

857
00:49:41,874 --> 00:49:42,811
Barbara.

858
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:43,749
What happened?

859
00:49:43,853 --> 00:49:44,723
Where's she going?

860
00:49:48,266 --> 00:49:50,072
Not dad.

861
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:51,045
I'm sorry.

862
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,458
Poor guy.

863
00:49:55,563 --> 00:49:56,639
What'd he died from?

864
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,855
Chemical poisoning.

865
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:58,967
It was long-term.

866
00:49:59,071 --> 00:50:01,956
He must have had it for years.

867
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,449
She must have gone to Buddy's.

868
00:50:03,553 --> 00:50:04,422
Come on.

869
00:50:04,526 --> 00:50:05,569
Let's go.

870
00:50:05,673 --> 00:50:06,506
Let's go.

871
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:17,276
So what can I do for you, Jack Hollohan?

872
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,736
I'm here about Buddy Boyle.

873
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,696
His waste disposal methods are irregular.

874
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:24,677
[phone ringing] - Irregular?

875
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:26,067
Mm-hm.

876
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:30,584
You're in direct violation of all the EPA codes.

877
00:50:30,688 --> 00:50:31,521
I have pictures.

878
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:36,976
Well, that's very distressing, sir.

879
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,408
I guess we'll have to look into it, huh?

880
00:50:39,512 --> 00:50:40,728
Ms. Smith, please hold all calls.

881
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:43,125
MS. SMITH: But it's Mr. Eden on the line.

882
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,627
Put him through.

883
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:49,483
What can I do for you now, we, Eden?

884
00:50:49,587 --> 00:50:51,568
Round flagstones?

885
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:52,853
Round flagstones?

886
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:55,841
I told you that I wanted square flagstones by Friday.

887
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:57,440
Hey, don't mock me.

888
00:50:57,544 --> 00:51:00,879
Are those ears on the side of your head?

889
00:51:00,983 --> 00:51:02,164
Are you listening?

890
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:03,486
I said square.

891
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:07,272
S-Q-U-A-R-E. Damned construction workers.

892
00:51:07,376 --> 00:51:10,329
You know, they can't even get government jobs.

893
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,630
So now where were you, Jack?

894
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:15,437
Buddy Boyle.

895
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:19,293
He's dumping your waste all over the county.

896
00:51:19,397 --> 00:51:21,482
That stupid little son of a bitch.

897
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:27,701
Duane, I'm really sorry about your dad.

898
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:33,920
Jack, I want to thank you.

899
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,935
If Buddy had anything to do with this,

900
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:38,783
I'll nail his ass personally.

901
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:39,757
Thank you.

902
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:40,799
No, Jack.

903
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:42,223
Thank you.

904
00:51:42,328 --> 00:51:43,926
You know, it makes me very proud to be an American

905
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:45,455
when I meet somebody like you.

906
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:47,991
You know, doc gotten a lot of black eyes in your life,

907
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,493
but you're a man of principle.

908
00:51:50,597 --> 00:51:52,889
It's been a pleasure.

909
00:51:52,993 --> 00:51:55,148
Hey, maybe you and me can get a couple of beers some time,

910
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:56,156
huh?

911
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,789
[laughs]

912
00:51:59,735 --> 00:52:00,568
Jerk-off.

913
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:40,939
Babs is sure in a hurry.

914
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,416
Yeah, hey doc--

915
00:52:58,519 --> 00:52:59,527
I've got to talk to Duane.

916
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:04,912
What?

917
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:05,919
That's terrible.

918
00:53:08,873 --> 00:53:12,937
Tell Toni to stay put and I'll be home in a few hours.

919
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:25,619
Open up.

920
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:26,383
Sorry, Duane.

921
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:27,842
I can't do it.

922
00:53:27,946 --> 00:53:29,962
Look, my mother is in there and I got to go in.

923
00:53:30,066 --> 00:53:31,386
I'm sorry.

924
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,123
- Lester, back off. - I'm sorry.

925
00:53:33,228 --> 00:53:34,096
I cannot do it.

926
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:38,161
I'll shoot.

927
00:53:38,265 --> 00:53:39,135
You crazy?

928
00:53:40,975 --> 00:53:42,504
Oh, shit.

929
00:53:42,608 --> 00:53:44,137
[gunshots]

930
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:48,653
[screams]

931
00:53:56,436 --> 00:53:57,895
Come on. Let's get Uncle Jack.

932
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,903
He'll help us.

933
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:06,546
Damn kids.

934
00:54:06,651 --> 00:54:07,971
Be on alert.

935
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:10,055
Barbara's kid just tried crashing through the gate.

936
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:11,792
God, the whole family's gone crazy.

937
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:17,700
Let's call the police.

938
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:18,464
Who?

939
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:20,130
That guy Wilson?

940
00:54:20,235 --> 00:54:21,173
Are you serious?

941
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:36,147
[buzz]

942
00:54:36,252 --> 00:54:37,189
WOMAN: It's Lance.

943
00:54:37,293 --> 00:54:39,100
He sounds very upset.

944
00:54:39,205 --> 00:54:40,038
Tell him I'm out.

945
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:41,185
WOMAN: OK.

946
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,069
I'll be taking my lunch break now.

947
00:54:44,173 --> 00:54:45,285
OK.

948
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:46,918
But make it a fast half hour, got it?

949
00:54:56,299 --> 00:54:57,584
Babs.

950
00:54:57,689 --> 00:54:59,564
What a pleasant surprise.

951
00:54:59,668 --> 00:55:01,475
You bastard.

952
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,864
Daryl's dead.

953
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,289
Oh, no.

954
00:55:04,393 --> 00:55:06,826
I'm so sorry to hear that.

955
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,424
I just bet you are.

956
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:11,307
BUDDY: Is there anything I can do?

957
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:13,495
You knew this stuff wasn't safe.

958
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,858
BUDDY: I think you're misinformed.

959
00:55:15,962 --> 00:55:18,325
Daryl was in no danger.

960
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:21,140
No danger, huh?

961
00:55:21,244 --> 00:55:22,876
I need you to drink this stuff.

962
00:55:22,981 --> 00:55:25,621
BUDDY: Well, I'm not thirsty just right now.

963
00:55:25,725 --> 00:55:27,533
Yeah, because you know what you've been

964
00:55:27,637 --> 00:55:29,582
dumping in this for 30 years.

965
00:55:29,686 --> 00:55:31,702
That's why you won't touch it.

966
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:34,829
Let's not make a mountain out of a molehill.

967
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:37,121
You pervert.

968
00:55:37,226 --> 00:55:40,561
I think you're upset.

969
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:42,159
Maybe you should go home.

970
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:43,896
Bullshit.

971
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:48,170
Barbara, please go.

972
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:49,907
Sure, that's just like you.

973
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:51,574
BUDDY: It's just for protection.

974
00:55:51,678 --> 00:55:52,443
From what?

975
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:56,439
A woman with a glass of water.

976
00:55:56,543 --> 00:55:59,462
You know, Duane saw what happened to Billy

977
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:02,345
and you Didn't even try to help him.

978
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:03,874
That's a lie.

979
00:56:03,978 --> 00:56:07,104
Babs, I love you.

980
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:09,711
You and I could have had a life together.

981
00:56:09,815 --> 00:56:10,753
Stop it.

982
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:12,177
Stop it!

983
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:14,192
You had to go marry that nobody.

984
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:21,384
Don't you ever--

985
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:22,565

986
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:25,276

00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:43,238
Come on, Buddy.

990
00:56:43,343 --> 00:56:44,870
Answer the phone.

00:56:44,975 --> 00:56:46,956
[ringing phone]

992
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:52,549
Come on, you son of a bitch.

993
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:53,730
Answer the phone.

994
00:56:54,634 --> 00:56:56,996
[ringing phone]

995
00:56:57,899 --> 00:56:59,741
Why'd you do that?

996
00:56:59,844 --> 00:57:01,234
Why did you do that?

997
00:57:01,339 --> 00:57:04,675
Jesus Christ, where the hell are you?

998
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:05,612
Hello.

999
00:57:05,716 --> 00:57:06,689
Oh, Buddy.

1000
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:09,608
Pal, how you doing?

1001
00:57:09,712 --> 00:57:11,274
Buddy, you're never going to believe

1002
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,013
who just paid me a visit.

1003
00:57:13,117 --> 00:57:13,985
No.

1004
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:14,957
Who?

1005
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:16,104
Cindy?

1006
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:17,320
No, it wasn't Cindy.

1007
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:20,135
It was Jack, you idiot.

1008
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:22,740
Yeah, he pulled a gun on Clem.

1009
00:57:22,845 --> 00:57:25,521
Well, isn't that just wonderful?

1010
00:57:25,624 --> 00:57:27,361
Look, Buddy, you better go deal with him

1011
00:57:27,465 --> 00:57:29,271
and the whole lot of them before I deal with you.

1012
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:30,557
BUDDY: Yeah, you're right.

1013
00:57:30,662 --> 00:57:32,052
Buddy, I think that you're smart enough

1014
00:57:32,156 --> 00:57:33,373
to know what that means.

1015
00:57:33,476 --> 00:57:35,283
OK, I'll take care of it.

1016
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:37,193
Hey, listen, I've got to go.

1017
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:38,618
Take care of them!

1018
00:57:43,308 --> 00:57:44,837
[moo]

1019
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:49,353
[gunshots]

1020
00:57:52,098 --> 00:57:53,245
HASKEL: Hurry up, Clem.

1021
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:55,295
CLEM: I'm coming.

1022
00:57:55,399 --> 00:57:57,414
Just putting the finishing touches on.

1023
00:57:57,518 --> 00:58:00,228
Drop the gun over there on the floor.

1024
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:01,201
No problem.

1025
00:58:04,153 --> 00:58:05,613
Why is Buddy so nervous?

1026
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:11,938
These people are just trash.

1027
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,022
They're a threat to our lifestyle.

1028
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:16,418
We're doing the community a favor.

1029
00:58:16,523 --> 00:58:20,066
Yep. Now don't forget to call Wilson.

1030
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:23,089
Buddy better pay us overtime for this.

1031
00:58:23,193 --> 00:58:26,980
This job-related stress is difficult to cope with.

1032
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:28,022
Yeah.

1033
00:58:28,127 --> 00:58:31,081
Maybe we'll take us a long vacation.

1034
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:33,547
Maybe go to Barstow.

1035
00:58:33,651 --> 00:58:34,485
Nice kitty.

1036
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:45,637
You don't think she'll do anything, do you?

1037
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:47,652
I'm more worried about what Buddy will do to her.

1038
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:48,451
That guy's nuts.

1039
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:49,668
Not Come on.

1040
00:58:49,772 --> 00:58:50,988
It's not too much farther to Jack's.

1041
00:58:57,276 --> 00:58:59,395
Cold-blooded.

1042
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,785
He'll get the chair.

1043
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:04,677
You can bet on that.

1044
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,853
Murder lurks in every corner, and I smell it.

1045
00:59:09,957 --> 00:59:11,035
[gunshots] Bull's-eye!

1046
00:59:11,139 --> 00:59:12,390
[cat screeches]

1047
00:59:14,891 --> 00:59:15,759
What the--

1048
00:59:15,864 --> 00:59:16,802
Uncle Jack!

1049
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:33,096
What's wrong?

1050
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:34,938
Where's my uncle?

1051
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:38,864
Now you know, Missy, I was just about to ask you

1052
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:40,044
that one myself.

1053
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,650
You know, I had a dream about you last night.

1054
00:59:42,755 --> 00:59:44,666
Son, can I have a word with you.

1055
00:59:44,769 --> 00:59:47,550
Yeah, I'll remember to tell you about it some time.

1056
00:59:47,654 --> 00:59:48,522
What's going on?

1057
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:53,490
Look, you son of a bitch.

1058
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:54,498
Oh, now, now.

1059
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:57,104
I wouldn't say that if I was you--

1060
00:59:57,208 --> 01:00:00,648
not I was an accessory to murder.

1061
01:00:00,752 --> 01:00:02,106
Murder?

1062
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:04,087
Uncle Jack?

1063
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:05,789
Don't be touching any of them things in there.

1064
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:09,438
That's evidence, you little honey pot.

1065
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:13,225
I'm afraid to say that your mother has been murdered.

1066
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:14,371
No!

1067
01:00:14,476 --> 01:00:15,310
Ah!

1068
01:00:18,505 --> 01:00:20,903
[laughs]

1069
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:26,705
[vomits]

1070
01:00:34,313 --> 01:00:38,726
Oh, now, save the drama for the courtroom, honey.

1071
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:41,262
Hey, Wilson, looks like our culprit

1072
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:43,000
coming down the drive now.

1073
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,809
Better draw your gun there, Derwood.

1074
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:50,852
He's dangerous.

1075
01:00:50,956 --> 01:00:51,651
You bastard.

1076
01:00:51,755 --> 01:00:53,005
You know he didn't do it.

1077
01:00:55,820 --> 01:01:00,197
Don't make me smack you again now, huh?

1078
01:01:00,301 --> 01:01:01,136
Whew.

1079
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:02,108
Hot, ain't it?

1080
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:07,146
What the hell is going on here?

1081
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,161
You have the right to remain quiet.

1082
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,038
You have the right for a lawyer.

1083
01:01:11,142 --> 01:01:12,044
Knock it off.

1084
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:13,538
Buddy killed Barbara.

1085
01:01:13,643 --> 01:01:14,928
He dumped her in your house.

1086
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:16,248
That's enough out of you.

1087
01:01:16,353 --> 01:01:17,951
And you're under arrest.

1088
01:01:18,056 --> 01:01:19,062
Not Barbara.

1089
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:20,000
Jesus.

1090
01:01:20,105 --> 01:01:21,460
Look, he didn't do it.

1091
01:01:21,565 --> 01:01:22,989
We followed her to Buddy's.

1092
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:24,518
It was your murder weapon, Jack.

1093
01:01:24,622 --> 01:01:27,436
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take you in for questioning.

1094
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:28,443
Wilson, get over here.

1095
01:01:31,466 --> 01:01:32,230
Listen, you--

1096
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:36,260
I have been at AXL all day long.

1097
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:39,735
You can do all your talking at the jailhouse.

1098
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,132
I might have known you'd have an alibi.

1099
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:44,529
Buddy, how could he?

1100
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,405
He was always in love with Babs.

1101
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,630
Take him in.

1102
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:52,729
You're making a big mistake, Horne.

1103
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,014
Be careful, Wilson.

1104
01:01:54,118 --> 01:01:56,620
He's a dangerous type.

1105
01:01:56,725 --> 01:01:59,052
Go on.

1106
01:01:59,156 --> 01:02:00,199
See you later.

1107
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,673
Yeah, this is Wilson.

1108
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:27,611
I'm coming in.

1109
01:02:27,715 --> 01:02:30,078
CLEM: We'll be waiting for you.

1110
01:02:30,182 --> 01:02:31,051
[laughter]

1111
01:02:31,154 --> 01:02:33,135
That was Clem's voice.

1112
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:34,664
Where you taking me?

1113
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:38,276
Jack, you want me to give you a piece of advice, boy?

1114
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:40,430
You just get back down there nice and low

1115
01:02:40,535 --> 01:02:42,829
and you shut your mouth, right?

1116
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:44,079
When all this is said and done,

1117
01:02:44,183 --> 01:02:46,442
Wilson, I'm going to take care of you.

1118
01:02:46,546 --> 01:02:47,762
You can count on it.

1119
01:02:47,866 --> 01:02:50,368
Yeah, well I believe I heard that one a time or two.

1120
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:52,000
You just do as I said.

1121
01:02:52,104 --> 01:02:56,135
Now get down, boy.

1122
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,220
Lower.

1123
01:02:58,323 --> 01:03:01,312
Now that's real nice.

1124
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:02,355
Real nice.

1125
01:03:23,617 --> 01:03:25,563
Halt!

1126
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:26,500
Hold it right there.

1127
01:03:26,605 --> 01:03:27,716
Jail, my ass.

1128
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:42,134
SHERIFF HORNE: Escaped?

1129
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,559
How in the hell did he escape?

1130
01:03:43,664 --> 01:03:45,992
OFFICER WILSON: You tell me.

1131
01:03:46,095 --> 01:03:47,138
Ha.

1132
01:03:47,242 --> 01:03:49,292
He must have used one of them B&N tricks.

1133
01:03:49,396 --> 01:03:50,646
He's one of them commando types.

1134
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:54,711
OFFICER WILSON: Yeah, he jumped me all right.

1135
01:03:54,815 --> 01:03:56,692
Well, Derwood, this is a red alert.

1136
01:03:56,797 --> 01:03:58,394
Dangerous criminal on the loose.

1137
01:03:58,499 --> 01:04:00,549
Shoot to kill.

1138
01:04:00,653 --> 01:04:01,730
That's crazy.

1139
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:02,912
He didn't escape.

1140
01:04:03,016 --> 01:04:03,884
I followed them.

1141
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:05,239
They're at Buddy's plant.

1142
01:04:05,343 --> 01:04:07,324
Little girl, you just protecting your uncle.

1143
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:09,582
Now let go of my arm or you'll go to jail

1144
01:04:09,685 --> 01:04:10,972
the rest of your life.

1145
01:04:11,076 --> 01:04:12,257
You won't listen.

1146
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:13,264
Come on, Derwood.

1147
01:04:13,368 --> 01:04:14,863
We have an escapee to catch.

1148
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:20,283
They're gonna kill him.

1149
01:04:20,386 --> 01:04:21,708
I want to kill that son of a bitch.

1150
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:24,069
How? We can't even get past the gate.

1151
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:25,494
I've got an idea.

1152
01:04:25,598 --> 01:04:27,092
We'll surprise them.

1153
01:04:32,894 --> 01:04:34,076
Good morning, Jack.

1154
01:04:37,898 --> 01:04:40,295
[laughter]

1155
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:43,421
Now who's wetting their pants?

1156
01:04:43,525 --> 01:04:44,394
Jack.

1157
01:04:44,499 --> 01:04:45,888
Dumb name.

1158
01:04:45,993 --> 01:04:51,378
I bet you don't get any girls, like Lance.

1159
01:04:51,482 --> 01:04:55,755
Now, who you been blabbing your fool mouth off to?

1160
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,979
You think I'd squeal as easy as you?

1161
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,197
Cut it out, Clem.

1162
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:07,533
We wouldn't be here if you'd kept your mouth shut.

1163
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:10,069
And you're a heap of trouble.

1164
01:05:10,174 --> 01:05:11,981
You're wanted for first degree murder.

1165
01:05:12,085 --> 01:05:14,864
Now, who you been telling those lies to?

1166
01:05:14,968 --> 01:05:17,783
Yeah, you killed Babs.

1167
01:05:17,887 --> 01:05:18,963
I know it.

1168
01:05:19,067 --> 01:05:20,631
Everybody knows it.

1169
01:05:20,736 --> 01:05:25,183
I'm gonna see you get the chair for it.

1170
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:30,116
Well, you seem like a real big thinker to me, Colonel.

1171
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:32,965
Well, I bet if you thought real hard,

1172
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,084
you could remember who else you've been going

1173
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:39,775
to with your bold-faced lies.

1174
01:05:39,879 --> 01:05:42,068
If those kids are running around town spouting

1175
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:44,118
their mouths off-- have they?

1176
01:05:44,222 --> 01:05:45,091
Have they?

1177
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,105
Have they?

1178
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,198
Who else you gonna murder, Buddy.

1179
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:55,097
One day, it'll be you.

1180
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,312
Shut your yuck.

1181
01:06:01,385 --> 01:06:03,400
Well, who else have you been talking to?

1182
01:06:03,504 --> 01:06:04,512
I forget.

1183
01:06:04,616 --> 01:06:06,318
Well, maybe this will help you remember.

1184
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:26,921
I still don't see why we can't call the police.

1185
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,033
It won't help.

1186
01:06:28,137 --> 01:06:28,971
Trust me.

1187
01:06:29,075 --> 01:06:30,257
They're in on it.

1188
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:31,785
Wait until we land and then call the FBI.

1189
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:34,599
Well, I sure hope you know what you're doing.

1190
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:37,657
It's the only way to save Jack.

1191
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:39,880
And I'm gonna take care of Buddy.

1192
01:06:47,385 --> 01:06:50,721
I sure hope you're enjoying this as much as I am.

1193
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,140
I can't seem to hurt you, lard-bucket,

1194
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:58,086
with all that padding there.

1195
01:06:58,190 --> 01:06:59,719
[laughter]

1196
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:19,523
Get ready.

1197
01:07:19,626 --> 01:07:21,364
You all be careful.

1198
01:07:21,468 --> 01:07:23,622
And don't come back without Jack.

1199
01:07:23,726 --> 01:07:26,088
Remember, don't pull till 2,000 feet.

1200
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:27,410
We all land together.

1201
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:28,660
This is really dangerous.

1202
01:07:28,764 --> 01:07:30,327
We really need you, Becky.

1203
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,300
Don't worry.

1204
01:07:31,404 --> 01:07:32,516
It won't be bad.

1205
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,559
I hope.

1206
01:07:33,663 --> 01:07:34,705
I worked there one summer.

1207
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:39,361
A lot of them guys carry guns.

1208
01:07:39,465 --> 01:07:40,681
Well, I wouldn't worry.

1209
01:07:40,785 --> 01:07:43,460
Most of them probably couldn't hit a can from 20 feet.

1210
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:44,398
Ready?

1211
01:07:44,503 --> 01:07:45,370
Go.

1212
01:07:48,741 --> 01:07:49,575
[yelling]

1213
01:07:57,392 --> 01:07:58,748
I hope it's not too late.

1214
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:01,423
Stupid bitch.

1215
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:03,507
Hands out to me, Becky.

1216
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:04,966
This is crazy.

1217
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:07,050
We could get hurt.

1218
01:08:07,155 --> 01:08:09,275
It's around that bend to the river.

1219
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:29,008
Over that way.

1220
01:09:03,578 --> 01:09:09,970
What the-- sound the alarm!

1221
01:09:10,075 --> 01:09:10,805
They're here!

1222
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:12,402
We're under attack.

1223
01:09:12,506 --> 01:09:14,035
MAN: By who?

1224
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:14,835
Who?

1225
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:15,773
The Reds!

1226
01:09:15,878 --> 01:09:17,371
Who else?

1227
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:18,830
Take that!

1228
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:20,463
[gunshots]

1229
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:22,061
Damn.

1230
01:09:37,452 --> 01:09:38,320
Let's ditch this stuff.

1231
01:09:53,712 --> 01:09:56,179
You keep your eyes peeled for those kids.

1232
01:09:56,283 --> 01:09:57,326
Don't worry.

1233
01:09:57,429 --> 01:09:58,716
They're not going to get past us.

1234
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,220
[gunshots]

1235
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,074

1237
01:10:49,349 --> 01:10:50,878
Hey, those are gunshots.

1238
01:10:50,982 --> 01:10:52,337
That ain't no fire.

1239
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:53,657
Must be a fire.

1240
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:55,777
Somebody pulled the fire bell.

1241
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:56,541
Good thinking.

1242
01:10:56,645 --> 01:10:57,722
Good thinking, Clem.

1243
01:10:57,827 --> 01:10:59,773
Maybe it's the National Guard.

1244
01:11:04,497 --> 01:11:05,436
[boom]

1245
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,442
It's a trick.

1246
01:11:06,546 --> 01:11:08,075
An ambush.

1247
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:12,767
Hey, you don't think Sheriff Horne caught on?

1248
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,817
[laughter]

1249
01:11:14,921 --> 01:11:16,623
Nah.

1250
01:11:16,727 --> 01:11:18,846
Hey, you guys get out there and check things out.

1251
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:22,320
Buddy, I-- I don't think that's such a good idea.

1252
01:11:22,425 --> 01:11:23,467
Come on, Clem.

1253
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:26,142
We'll get us some real firepower.

1254
01:11:26,246 --> 01:11:27,741
This will be fun.

1255
01:11:27,844 --> 01:11:29,268
I'll keep him on ice.

1256
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:34,099
And if things get nasty, it's so long Jack.

1257
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:38,233

Let's split up.

1260
01:12:04,777 --> 01:12:08,737
You go over there, and I'll go this way.

1261
01:12:52,478 --> 01:12:53,834

Let's get them from below.

1265
01:13:28,507 --> 01:13:30,661
I'm not going down there.

1266
01:13:32,677 --> 01:13:34,206

Whoa!

01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:25,556
I'm gonna stick my tongue in your--

1270
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,598
[gunshots]

1271
01:15:18,643 --> 01:15:19,546
Whoa.

1272
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:22,082
Shit.

1273
01:15:22,186 --> 01:15:23,125
Damn it.

1274
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:25,175
Goddammit.

1275
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:26,217
Jesus.

01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:28,302
Whoa, shit.

No, no!

1279
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:39,142
Let's split up.

1280
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:41,365
We'll take the west side.

1281
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:03,010
Hi, honey.

1282
01:16:03,114 --> 01:16:04,538
Oh, don't be so cool now.

1283
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:05,581
Come on.

1284
01:16:05,684 --> 01:16:08,083
Let's put that piece down.

1285
01:16:08,187 --> 01:16:11,174
Do it with one hand.

1286
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:12,634
That's easy.

1287
01:16:12,738 --> 01:16:14,579
That's a nice, but you know something, darling?

1288
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:16,039
I think I got something better for you.

1289
01:16:20,521 --> 01:16:21,354
Don't be scared.

1290
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:23,543
You know something?

1291
01:16:23,647 --> 01:16:26,983
I've been looking to have this date with you for a long time

1292
01:16:27,086 --> 01:16:27,746
now.

1293
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:28,859
A long time.

1294
01:16:28,963 --> 01:16:30,422
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1295
01:16:30,526 --> 01:16:31,464
So have I.

1296
01:16:31,568 --> 01:16:32,506
Yeah?

01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:33,444
[laughter]

1298
01:16:34,522 --> 01:16:35,598
I knew it.

01:16:35,703 --> 01:16:37,267
I knew it.

1300
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:47,516
Was it good for you?

1301
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,732
[alarms]

1302
01:16:48,836 --> 01:16:51,095
I should just do you in right now.

1303
01:17:01,552 --> 01:17:02,420
Take that.

1304
01:17:11,176 --> 01:17:12,635
Buddy!

1305
01:17:12,739 --> 01:17:14,163
[gunshots]

1306
01:17:16,005 --> 01:17:17,325
We're too late.

1307
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:18,299
No!

1308
01:17:23,578 --> 01:17:24,238
Jesus.

1309
01:17:24,343 --> 01:17:25,421
I thought you were dead.

1310
01:17:26,497 --> 01:17:28,374
[grunts]

1311
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,084
You all right?

1312
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,021
Eh.

1313
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:34,870
Uncle Jack!

1314
01:17:34,975 --> 01:17:36,018
Where's Buddy?

1315
01:17:36,122 --> 01:17:37,372
That Way.

1316
01:17:37,476 --> 01:17:38,414
No!

1317
01:17:38,518 --> 01:17:39,422
Duane!

1318
01:17:39,526 --> 01:17:42,131
Now, wait a minute.

1319
01:17:42,236 --> 01:17:43,591
[alarms]

1320
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:40,466
Don't shoot.

1321
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:41,264
Please.

1322
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:42,376
You son of a bitch.

1323
01:18:42,481 --> 01:18:43,939
Duane, no.

1324
01:18:44,045 --> 01:18:45,469
Ah, don't Duane.

1325
01:18:45,572 --> 01:18:46,684
Yeah, you don't kill me.

1326
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,040
You don't kill me. - Come on, Duane.

1327
01:18:48,144 --> 01:18:49,186
Don't be like Buddy.

1328
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:50,159
Come on.

1329
01:18:50,263 --> 01:18:51,479
We'll see him fry in jail.

1330
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:52,452
Hey!

1331
01:19:03,153 --> 01:19:05,133
Leave me alone, you little shit-head.

1332
01:19:05,237 --> 01:19:07,217
It was an accident.

1333
01:19:07,322 --> 01:19:09,476
Come back here, you chickenshit.

1334
01:19:13,575 --> 01:19:15,555
You could have been my son.

1335
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,231
Thank God my mom had better taste.

1336
01:19:18,335 --> 01:19:19,898
[gunshots]

1337
01:19:29,175 --> 01:19:30,288
You're pathetic!

1338
01:19:52,175 --> 01:19:53,183
Shit!

1339
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:42,518
Say goodbye, Buddy!

1340
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:48,772
Oh God.

1341
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:49,814
Not Duane.

1342
01:20:49,918 --> 01:20:50,786
Here.

1343
01:20:50,891 --> 01:20:52,941
How about a drink, you little twit?

1344
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:05,865
[screams]

1345
01:21:32,652 --> 01:21:33,520
Duane!

1346
01:21:49,224 --> 01:21:50,579
[laughter]

1347
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:56,659
[music playing]

1348
01:21:56,764 --> 01:22:03,921
SONG: Me and my Lord are walking on the water.

1349
01:22:04,024 --> 01:22:12,849
Me and my Lord are walking on the water.

1350
01:22:12,954 --> 01:22:14,934
I won't fear.

1351
01:22:15,038 --> 01:22:20,146
I won't fall because my Lord is here.

1352
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:24,905
I'm walking on the water with my Lord.

1353
01:22:27,963 --> 01:22:35,746
Me and my Jesus are walking on the water.

1354
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:41,131
Me and my Jesus are walking on the water.

1355
01:22:45,231 --> 01:22:46,585
I won't fear.

1356
01:22:46,689 --> 01:22:51,380
I won't fall because my Lord is here.

1357
01:22:51,484 --> 01:22:58,225
I'm walking on the water with my Lord.

1358
01:23:01,281 --> 01:23:07,397
Oh Lord, something in the water.

1359
01:23:07,501 --> 01:23:13,406
Oh Lord, something in the water.

1360
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,862
Strong enough.

1361
01:23:18,966 --> 01:23:24,630
Is it laced by the Devil's old toxic waste?

1362
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:27,756
There's something in the water.

1363
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:28,973
Oh Lord.

1364
01:23:36,164 --> 01:23:37,241
Something in the water.

1365
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:45,371
Something in the water.

1366
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:04,062
There's something in the water, oh Lord.

1367
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:07,155
Me and my Lord.

1368
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:11,150
We're walking on the water.

1369
01:24:11,254 --> 01:24:18,133
Me and my Lord, we're walking on the water.

1370
01:24:21,191 --> 01:24:23,136
I won't fear.

1371
01:24:23,241 --> 01:24:27,723
I won't fall because my Lord is here.

1372
01:24:27,827 --> 01:24:35,783
I'm walking on the water with my Lord.

1373
01:24:35,887 --> 01:24:39,501
I'm walking on the water.

1374
01:24:39,605 --> 01:24:43,010
I'm walking with my Lord.

1375
01:24:43,114 --> 01:24:47,144
I'm walking on the water.

1376
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,819
I'm walking with my Lord.

1377
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,426
Halt!

1378
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:08,129
Don't make a move.

1379
01:25:08,232 --> 01:25:12,854
You can avoid me, but you can never escape.
