1
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,818
Tensions are
high as a result of the US

2
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,821
not signing the Kyoto
agreement, the global treaty

3
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,458
aimed at reducing the world's
pollution and emittance levels.

4
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,859
The State Department is declaring

5
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,528
the Brazilian rainforest
to be of national interest

6
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,431
to the US since May 1998.

7
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:42,235
Unidentified tribesmen of
Brazil's Amazon River region,

8
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,238
protesting what they
call death pollution,

9
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,474
have taken over and
shut down two dozen

10
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,409
American oil installations.

11
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,212
To date, these sieges
have cost the petroleum

12
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,714
industry almost $14 billion.

13
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,450
In response, the US and
Brazilian governments

14
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,154
broke ground on a new program
they hope will end this turmoil

15
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,423
and bring these two sides together.

16
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,494
Scott Turner from the US State Department
is here to oversee the program.

17
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,162
It's a win-win, Ann.

18
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,598
Under SBP, the area
businesses will receive

19
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,567
this paved superhighway
and a unilateral peace

20
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,170
keeping force to prevent
further hostilities.

21
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,706
Now, the tribesmen will receive
our word that this highway will

22
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,543
extend no further than 100 miles
into the country, a moratorium

23
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,545
on any new drilling,
and restrictions

24
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,582
on pollution and emissions that
will be stricter than ever before.

25
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,585
Hopes hang high here
that separate, but protected,

26
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,388
may finally bring an
end to this unrest.

27
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,524
From the town of Brazil,

28
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,893
I'm Ann Bauer, ICN News.

29
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,528
And clear.

30
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,529
Good.

31
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,899
Man it's hot.

32
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,577
Quadrant 10 all clear.

33
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,779
Follow up check at 1300 hours.

34
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,435
Hopes hang high here.

35
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,972
That's a large lump of alliteration,
wouldn't you say?

36
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,740
Bite me, Raka.
I am tired.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,742
Tired, I wouldn't guess.

38
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,646
Horny for a certain State
Department suit, maybe, but not tired.

39
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,348
What?

40
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:40,553
Yes, Mr. Turner, please tell us what you
are doing to save the indigenous peoples.

41
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,821
He's not that bad.

42
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,893
Well, the perfect hair does
hide the pointy little horns.

43
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,430
Boy toy at six o'clock.

44
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,331
Scotty.

45
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,265
Hello again.

46
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,365
Hi.

47
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,443
Listen, I was...

48
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,813
I was wondering if you
had any plans for dinner.

49
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,982
You mean, something
other than black beans

50
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,251
and rice for the
fifth consecutive day?

51
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,485
Exactly.

52
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,455
How would you like to come to
Brasilia with me for a real dinner?

53
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,555
Steak, french fries...

54
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,699
You serious?

55
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,799
I never joke about dinner.

56
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,720
That sounds like a plan.

57
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,322
Great, excellent.

58
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,890
Just give me 15 minutes, OK?

59
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,824
All right.

60
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,924
OK.

61
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,695
My god.

62
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,795
Scotty, look.

63
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,932
Hit it.

64
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,305
Attack!

65
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,306
Attack, attack!

66
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,307
Fire.

67
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,007
Get your guns.

68
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,678
Come on, guys.

69
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,778
Get some coverage.

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Get down!

71
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,075
Get down!

72
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,175
Where is it coming from?

73
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,971
Get your gun.

74
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,041
Come on, guys.

75
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,193
Get behind here, now.

76
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,293
There they are.

77
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,895
Shit.

78
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,995
Jesus Christ.

79
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,669
What?

80
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,077
What?

81
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,075
I don't like this, Ann.

82
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,943
We were told not to leave camp.
We're breaking curfew.

83
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:11,878
They took my tapes.

84
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,779
They took my camera.

85
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,916
Do you mind telling me
what we are looking for?

86
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,251
No idea.

87
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,186
Well, how are we going
to know when we find it?

88
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,754
No clue.

89
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:22,788
This has been fun.

90
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:23,789
I'm going back now.
- No.

91
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,690
Raka, no.

92
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,859
Wait.

93
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,094
They are hiding something.

94
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,095
I can feel it.

95
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,796
Ann, what are they hiding?

96
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:31,731
I don't know yet.

97
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,831
We haven't found it.

98
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,938
Tell me exactly what
the tribesman said.

99
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,108
He said he was a shadow people.

100
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,776
Shadow people?

101
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,278
The hell is shadow people?

102
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,713
Supposedly, the ultimate
warriors of the Amazon.

103
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,815
And until today, I just
thought, just a legend, but.

104
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,050
Well, why would they be here?

105
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,785
Well, that's what freaked me out.

106
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:57,924
When I asked him that, he said..

107
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,192
My Portuguese is a little rusty.

108
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,327
What?

109
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,363
Ann, that's demons from the sky.

110
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,672
Demons from the sky?

111
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,808
Shadow people?

112
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,977
I wonder if they're looking
for an anchor in Wichita Falls.

113
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,077
Run.

114
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,266
What the...

115
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,113
This is a restricted area.

116
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,213
Do not move.

117
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,179
Passaporte.

118
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,819
Ann Bauer.

119
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,388
I'm a journalist.

120
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,135
Come on, guy.

121
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,235
I'm just doing my job.

122
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,641
No.

123
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,584
Shit.

124
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,123
Vamos.

125
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,024
Let's go.

126
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,124
Get out of here.

127
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:25,064
Blood pressure stable, no infection,

128
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:29,068
rapid tissue regeneration
due to unknown toxin.

129
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,403
Unknown toxin?

130
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,378
What the... Looks like
some kind of insect.

131
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,482
My god.

132
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,658
Get well soon, sexy.

133
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,758
Got to go.

134
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,165
Doctor?

135
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,001
Well, yes and no.

136
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,435
Let me be specific.

137
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,004
Are you my wife's doctor?

138
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,139
Wife?

139
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,474
Martin Bauer.

140
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,075
I'm Ann's husband.

141
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,610
North.

142
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,912
Dr. Stephen North.

143
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,113
How did you...

144
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,383
Ann's emergency contact card.

145
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,551
Are you my wife's doctor?

146
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,919
No.

147
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,321
Actually we're more like associates.

148
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,289
Associates?

149
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,389
Yes, associates.

150
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,393
Well, Mr. Associate,
you want to tell

151
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,628
me why you're playing tonsil
hockey with my comatose wife?

152
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,197
I think you've got the wrong idea.

153
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,531
Yeah?
Well, maybe.

154
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,966
But I think you better
get your ass out of here

155
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,203
before I introduce
my foot to your ass.

156
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,571
Lovely.

157
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,671
Excuse me.

158
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,412
I can't imagine why she'd be
divorcing someone as charming

159
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,512
as you.

160
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,173
These babies really
are the perfect killers.

161
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,276
Our bioengineered beauties
cleared six towns.

162
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,645
No wonder they call
them demons from the sky.

163
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,253
Sir, census shows 37 villagers.

164
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,289
We have 37 confirmed kills.

165
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:35,294
37 out of 37, that's not bad.

166
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,662
We're moving to the next town.

167
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,731
Yes, sir.

168
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,201
I'm trying to make up my
mind if I should let you live.

169
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,703
You should've killed
that reporter last night.

170
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,105
Yes, sir.

171
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,275
I'm very disappointed.

172
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,144
Can I trust you?

173
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,079
Yes, sir.

174
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,015
You don't like me?

175
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,017
No, sir, I don't.

176
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,119
Good, let's keep it that way.

177
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,587
I'm going to give
you one more chance.

178
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,488
Sir?

179
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,589
What are you...

180
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,689
Better be quick.

181
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,593
Goodbye.

182
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,693
Shit.

183
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,806
Merda.

184
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,113
Show me exactly where
you were on the base.

185
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,548
Why are you so interested?

186
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,650
Raka, this could save Ann's life.

187
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,750
You want to help or not?

188
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,659
All right.

189
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,594
All right.

190
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,694
Somewhere around here.

191
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,677
Dr. North, what is it today?

192
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,513
An outbreak of trench
foot or jock itch?

193
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,613
Just some research, thank you.

194
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,371
Come on, guys.

195
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,773
Come on, let's get moving.

196
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,375
OK, clear this out.

197
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,376
Yeah, right here.

198
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,310
Right in here.

199
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,778
That's good.

200
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,447
Go back.

201
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,159
Contusions of the
face and chest, insect toxins

202
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,428
appear to have sped
up tissue regrowth.

203
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,764
Rule out ants.

204
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,333
OK, where are you guys?

205
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,367
Come on.

206
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,467
I know you're here somewhere.

207
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,836
What the...

208
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,775
My god.

209
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,826
What are you doing here?

210
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:26,565
Let's see.

211
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:31,236
In case of emergency, call
Martin Bauer, husband.

212
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,336
That's me.

213
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,445
So you want to tell
me what happened?

214
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,881
I'm pretty sure that I got shot.

215
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,850
After that, I don't know.

216
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,453
Those welts are nasty looking.

217
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,553
That's attractive.

218
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,528
It didn't seem to
bother your boyfriend.

219
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,397
Boyfriend?

220
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,332
Dr. North.

221
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,934
Gross.

222
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,369
He's a medical researcher.

223
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,641
Well, he had you in a lip
lock when I came in the room.

224
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:14,313
It just makes me wonder what
kind of research he's doing.

225
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,413
What the hell are you saying?

226
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,386
Look, why don't you just
come back to New York with me?

227
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,955
Here it comes.

228
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,957
Ann, I need you.

229
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,659
Yeah, Martin's needs first, right?

230
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,861
Come on.

231
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,395
Don't start with that again.

232
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,731
Yes, this again.

233
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,834
Do you even remember why I left?

234
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,504
See if this rings a bell.

235
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,440
Let's have a baby,
Martin, start a family.

236
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,709
Look, I want those
things too, but I just...

237
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:44,643
When?

238
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,880
Some day, I don't know.

239
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,850
You know, these last few months,

240
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,520
I have realized that you will
never be ready to be a dad.

241
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,557
Because you will
never be ready to put

242
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,760
anyone else's needs before your
own, not a child, not mine.

243
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Ann?

244
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,399
Scotty.

245
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,499
Hi.

246
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,706
Martin, this is Scotty Turner.

247
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,643
He works for the State Department.

248
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,579
Scotty, this is my...

249
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,679
Martin Bauer.

250
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,586
Martin, it's a pleasure to meet you.

251
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,354
I came as soon as I heard.

252
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,857
Ann, I am so sorry you got
caught in the crossfire again.

253
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,358
Maybe we should just
get you out of here.

254
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,760
Scotty?

255
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,061
Would you mind giving us a second

256
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,161
to finish our business?

257
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,800
Yeah, sure.
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,468
I understand.

259
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,505
Here, I got these for you, Ann.

260
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,739
Thank you.

261
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,839
I'll just be down the hall.

262
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,514
Is there any guy
in this country who's

263
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,516
not trying to sleep with you?

264
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,616
Get out.

265
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,321
Look, I'm sorry, just...

266
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,421
Get out.

267
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,457
OK.

268
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,628
When did you become such an asshole?

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,469
At the exact moment you packed
your last bag and you left.

270
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,474
Take care of yourself.

271
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,061
The bites have faded.

272
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,637
It's amazing.

273
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,737
No, that's a miracle.

274
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,561
Happy bar mitzvah?

275
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,497
Well, they were all out of
sorry you got shot while I

276
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,098
was running my ass off, so.

277
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,567
Well, it works.

278
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,606
Thanks for coming.

279
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,741
Least I could do for
the one who got shot.

280
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,109
And how do I look?

281
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,711
Not bad.

282
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,681
Have you seen North?

283
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,182
I have a backhand
with his name on it.

284
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,183
No, he's gone.

285
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,484
He flies to New York today.

286
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,452
What?

287
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,787
Why?

288
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,021
Yesterday, he goes out
to where we got jacked

289
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,156
and he comes back
with a sealed crate.

290
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,256
Today, he fly.

291
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,760
Did you see what was in the crate?

292
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,062
No, he wouldn't let anyone near it.

293
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,464
Why?

294
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,534
Let's take a ride, Raka.

295
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,848
Sure appreciate this, sir.

296
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,188
A lot.

297
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,601
Perfect.

298
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,690
You know we're putting ourselves

299
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,125
in danger by going back there.

300
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,726
Raka, I'm a reporter.

301
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,028
I've got to do my job.

302
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,128
Just drive.

303
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,843
Ann?

304
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,645
Yeah?

305
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,515
You don't remember much about
the night you got shot, do you?

306
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,215
No, not much.

307
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,750
Why?

308
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,018
You do remember getting
chased though, right?

309
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:20,952
Yeah.

310
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,052
They're back.

311
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Get us the hell out of here.

312
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,665
Come on.

313
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,322
Just whose cornflakes
did you piss in?

314
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,557
Why do you think it's me?

315
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,657
Because everybody love Raka.

316
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,933
I got an idea.

317
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:12,070
When I yell \ "now, \"
brace yourself.

318
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,581
Anytime you're ready.

319
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,281
Don't rush.

320
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:27,886
In 3, 2, 1, now.

321
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,346
And your story is
going to get us killed.

322
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,196
They are not going
to let you carry it on.

323
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,163
Don't worry.

324
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,298
It will fit under my seat.

325
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,901
Yeah, and about seven others.

326
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,068
I'm not hearing you.

327
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,770
She's right, you know.

328
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,272
Excuse me?

329
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,807
This airline allows for a
maximum carry-on girth of 62

330
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,309
inches, which is the total length,

331
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,711
width, and height of the bag.

332
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,313
Your surfboard's too long.

333
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,915
Told ya.

334
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,049
This is a Dewey Weber.

335
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,985
It does not travel with baggage.

336
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,321
Your fly is down.

337
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:49,067
United Flight 777 to Los Angeles
is now boarding at gate 53.

338
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:20,098
This is the final boarding call
for Interamerica's flight 71

339
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,198
to New York City.

340
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,037
But it's a Dewey Weber.

341
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,706
I don't care if it's
a Denzel Washington.

342
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,806
It rides downstairs.

343
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,202
Hello.

344
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,302
Thank you.

345
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,250
All I can tell you
is we gave our best.

346
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,853
OK, you gave it your best.

347
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,488
That's all a man can do.

348
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,789
Stay put.

349
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:18,923
I'll pick you up.
- Yes, sir.

350
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:19,824
Roger that.

351
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,026
Thank you.

352
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:21,960
No problem.

353
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,060
10-4.

354
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,434
Yeah, Buzzard?

355
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,169
This is E.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,070
Go for Buzzard.

357
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,005
Over.

358
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,775
I think we've located
our problem tribe.

359
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,010
There's no time to get
our project to site.

360
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,512
I need fire power in the air.

361
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,880
Right away, sir.

362
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,914
Requesting coordinates.

363
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:43,948
Over.

364
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,417
OK, Ann.

365
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,019
Before I go back to the Jeep,
what are we looking for?

366
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,055
We're looking for what North found.

367
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,791
And that is?

368
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,226
You're a leper.

369
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,161
Come on, Raka.

370
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,195
Be serious.

371
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,197
I'm seriously not following.

372
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,499
Look, if I know North, he thinks

373
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,236
that whatever gave me
these delightful hickies

374
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,539
also caused my rapid recovery.

375
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,442
And that could be worth a
pretty penny in New York.

376
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,912
And I think it might be what
our friends in the dune buggy

377
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:17,282
were trying to protect.

378
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,258
Ezekial, you son of a bitch.

379
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,358
Run!

380
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,419
Welcome on board to Interamerica's

381
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,488
flight 71 to New York City.

382
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,323
We'll try to make the
next 10 hours of flight

383
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,958
as pleasant as possible.

384
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,527
I've been informed we
have some turbulence

385
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,395
for about the first 100 miles,
but we should be able to get

386
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,664
through that pretty quick.

387
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,200
Please, if you would, keep
your seatbelts fastened.

388
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,969
Refrain from using any personal
electronics here until we

389
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,638
get out of the rough stuff.

390
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,273
Thanks for flying Interamerica.

391
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,641
Sir?

392
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,442
Sir?

393
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,610
Yes?

394
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,579
Your laptop?

395
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:55,980
Yes, it is.

396
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Thanks for asking.

397
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,285
The hell was that?

398
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,300
Shit.

399
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Is that what I think it is?

400
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,507
Ideas?

401
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,607
No.

402
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,146
This has not been my week.

403
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,188
Demons from the sky.

404
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,793
Let's get the hell out of here.

405
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,207
You know, three years traveling

406
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,042
to this backward-ass
continent, I've yet

407
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,142
to finish a complete drink.

408
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,995
Jesus Christ.

409
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,564
You guys try to hit
every bump or what?

410
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,178
Shit.

411
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:45,790
Shit.

412
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,890
Shit.

413
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:10,214
Have... have Bonnie and Michelle
check on the passengers.

414
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,314
Yes, sir.

415
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,818
Interamerica passengers

416
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,387
flight 71, this is
your captain speaking.

417
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,089
Sorry for the bumpy ride.

418
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,758
We'll try to avoid any more
turbulence in the future.

419
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,227
In the meantime, please
keep your seatbelts fastened

420
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,163
and refrain from moving
around the cabin.

421
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,198
Thank you.

422
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,466
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

423
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,335
Yeah.
I just forgot to tell you.

424
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,703
Wonder if there's any
openings for cameramen

425
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:32,670
in the Middle East.

426
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,770
Pick up the phone, lunatic.

427
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,642
You don't mind if I
answer this, do you?

428
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,644
I think we're out
of the rough stuff.

429
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,346
Be my guest.

430
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,181
Thanks.

431
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,082
Hello?

432
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,450
Maniac.

433
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,151
You didn't do what I think you did?

434
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,186
Ann?

435
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,520
Hi, how are you?

436
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,255
You didn't do it, did you?

437
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,757
You haven't read about the
honey shortage in New York,

438
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,691
have you?

439
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,193
It's a terrible thing.

440
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,494
Are you out of your mind?

441
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,129
Do you have any idea
what those bees can do?

442
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,630
Do I know what they can do?

443
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,467
Sweetheart, you were covered
with stings from them

444
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,769
and your tissue healed
at a remarkable rate.

445
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,206
You know, by all rights,
you should be dead now.

446
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,607
More times than you'll know.

447
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,309
Do you have any
idea what this little

448
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:15,279
find will be worth to the
pharmaceutical community?

449
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,782
And I'm sure you understand this
couldn't possibly be trusted

450
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,218
to some third-world facility.

451
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,452
No.

452
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,888
Only the best for my
little bee-auties.

453
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:24,822
You sick monkey.

454
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,257
You've got to...

455
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,825
Ann, we're breaking up.

456
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,460
I think we're going into a tunnel.

457
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,298
Look, when I get to New
York, I'll give you a buzz.

458
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,501
Asshole.

459
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,601
Women.

460
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,180
Scott Turner.

461
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,481
Scotty, big problem.

462
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,283
Ann, what's wrong?

463
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,652
Something very dangerous is on
a plane to New York right now.

464
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,553
Hold on.

465
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,587
Slow down now.

466
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,556
What plane and what's dangerous?

467
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:03,928
Bees, Scotty, killer bees.

468
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:17,408
No, he's coming this way.

469
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,910
We weren't properly introduced.

470
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,010
I'm Adam.

471
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,415
What did you say your name was?

472
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,349
I didn't.

473
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,484
She's Sandy.

474
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,584
Quit it.

475
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,223
So Sandy, maybe when
we get back to New York,

476
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:36,794
we could get together, you
know, for dinner maybe.

477
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,262
Dinner?

478
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,567
Breakfast too,
depending on how it goes.

479
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,501
Alex?

480
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,569
Adam.

481
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,970
Adam.

482
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,572
Can I be blunt with you?

483
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,973
I prefer it.

484
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,775
Good.

485
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,777
Because I'd rather run my towel
over a midget wrestler's hair

486
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,380
butt than spend one more second
this close to a geek like you.

487
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,983
OK, Alex?

488
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,822
You just lost your chance at dinner.

489
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,922
Deep regret.

490
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:09,660
Sir.

491
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
I'll be out in a snap, OK?

492
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:17,869
Hey.

493
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,969
Hey.

494
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,743
Well, that's the
third one we've passed.

495
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,278
What's that?

496
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,246
A deserted town.

497
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,480
Where are all the people?

498
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,382
You know, it's a
reasonable question.

499
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,584
This whole thing gets
weirder and weirder.

500
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,487
Turn on your
phone, you bloody idiot.

501
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,397
Mister?

502
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,732
Yeah?

503
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,034
Can I ask you a question?

504
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,737
Well, you can't jump in front.

505
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,473
No.

506
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,341
It's more like advice.

507
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,876
Advice?

508
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,746
Not exactly the father knows
best type, if you know what I mean.

509
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,846
That's all right.

510
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,518
Do you understand women?

511
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,858
I mean, like, how to treat
them so that they'll like you?

512
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,357
I'll tell you what.

513
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,026
You give me your number.

514
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,695
And when I figure women
out, I'll call you.

515
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,629
Great.

516
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:19,964
Yeah.

517
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,400
So expect a call in, like, never.

518
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,370
Thanks.

519
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,572
No problem.

520
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,073
Maybe I'll just
stick to my computers.

521
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,173
What is that guy doing in there?

522
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,424
What's that?

523
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,069
Probably hemorrhoids.

524
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,746
You ready for this, Casper?

525
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,381
What did he say?

526
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,951
Well, you did get your hickies from the
demons from the sky, which makes you highly

527
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,021
unpopular with the townspeople
because you should be six feet under.

528
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,489
Right.

529
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,725
Rumor has it that
after you were stung,

530
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,761
you were taken away
by shadow people.

531
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,196
Wonderful.

532
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,807
Are you OK?

533
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:37,975
Shit.

534
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,075
Get the captain.

535
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,917
You want to look
for the shadow people?

536
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:47,852
Absolutely.

537
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:48,753
Why?

538
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,154
Well, it's obvious.

539
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,423
They must have a serum.

540
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,858
They saved my life with something.

541
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,459
That's great.

542
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,994
They can open a drugstore,
call it Spook and Save.

543
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,830
Raka.
- Ann, they could be cannibals.

544
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,168
Raka, if those bees get out on
that plane, hundreds could die.

545
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,438
And if they breed in New
York, it could be millions.

546
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,538
That's not fair.

547
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,083
All right, but I'm driving.

548
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,821
Well, just, you know,
heard this really loud bang

549
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,090
and then he came out like that.

550
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,426
Did you hear anything else?

551
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,494
Just the electric shaver, that's it.

552
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,030
Have you seen my headphones?

553
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,432
Yes.

554
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,134
There they are, my dear, down there.

555
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,980
Now what the hell's going on?

556
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,982
You have to warn the pilot.

557
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,884
Ann, my people have been trying.

558
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,187
Interamerica hasn't heard of
any problems with that flight.

559
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,955
They're inclined to let
them complete the trip

560
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,623
and handle the
situation in New York.

561
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,926
Scotty, if they don't
bring that plane back soon,

562
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,794
it's going to be out over the water.

563
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,696
And if anything does
happen, they're screwed.

564
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,630
I know.

565
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,665
I know.

566
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,700
And we are working on it, OK?

567
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,035
Now, shouldn't you be resting?

568
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,970
Yeah, well I have to
meet some people first.

569
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:13,971
What people?

570
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:14,972
Shadow people.

571
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:15,906
What?

572
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,608
What, are you kidding me?

573
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,009
No, I wish I were.

574
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:19,944
You know where they are?

575
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,912
Well, I think so.

576
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,048
The shaman told Raka.

577
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,750
Why?

578
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,118
I don't know.

579
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,054
I just heard they were
hard to find, that's all.

580
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,555
Why are you looking for them?

581
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,125
Well, I think they
must have an antidote.

582
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:37,762
If anything does happen,
we have to be ready.

583
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,096
Got to let us know what's going on.

584
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,898
In a minute, sir.

585
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,666
Are you sure?

586
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,101
This is the third time I've
been over the passenger list.

587
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,904
If there's a doctor on this flight,
he doesn't want to be known.

588
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,004
Captain, we got to land this thing.

589
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,945
You're in my chopper.

590
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,248
I'll have a beer or two.

591
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,783
Buzzard?
Si?

592
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,217
Yes, sir.
Go for Buzzard.

593
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,218
Over.
- Yeah.

594
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,154
We've got a problem.

595
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:06,557
A little bit of our
project has flown the coop.

596
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,833
Sao Paolo, this is Interamerica 71.

597
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,870
We have a medical emergency
on board, two passengers down.

598
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,840
Need medical assistance,
authorization return.

599
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,241
Over.

600
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,341
Flight 71, maintain current course.

601
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,113
The hell is going on down there?

602
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,191
Well, sir, let me give you

603
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,993
three reasons why you hired me.

604
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,228
I know how to improvise.

605
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,664
I'm quick on my feet.

606
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,633
And I'm a natural born asshole.

607
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,027
Why don't you guys
go back to your seats?

608
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,127
I can look after him for a while.

609
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,044
What now?

610
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,054
Somebody help me.
He's choking.

611
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,055
Come on.

612
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,155
Get it out.

613
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:55,392
Come on.

614
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,261
Get it out.

615
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,361
There you go.

616
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,766
Get him a glass of water, would you?

617
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,069
All right.

618
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,837
Just breathe, OK?

619
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,906
Deep breaths, you're going to be OK.

620
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:09,807
Breathe.

621
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:11,041
Mr. Bauer?

622
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,076
Yeah, kid?

623
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,812
I think you need to see this.

624
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,747
What is it, chicken wing?

625
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,449
No.

626
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,416
It's a bee.

627
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,985
Bee?

628
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:24,488
A bee?
My god.

629
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,062
You.

630
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,331
Yes, me.

631
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,900
Molested anybody else's wife lately?

632
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,302
Stay back.

633
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:42,272
How about if I just wipe that smirk
off your face right here in first class?

634
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,307
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

635
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,475
No.

636
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,476
You don't know what you're dealing...

637
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,444
This isn't helping, morons.

638
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,345
Fellas?

639
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:49,780
What?

640
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,880
Look.

641
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,351
Got a bee on your neck, pal.

642
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,451
Get it off!

643
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:01,258
You OK?

644
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:11,402
Here, take this.

645
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,469
You're going to get a call.

646
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,569
What?

647
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,846
This is Interamerica's flight 71.

648
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,314
Come in, Sao Paolo tower.

649
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,550
Any ideas?

650
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,186
Well, all the attacks
have occurred in coach.

651
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,989
So maybe if we move
everybody up to first class

652
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,291
and try to find some way to seal
it off, maybe that will work.

653
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:38,062
Might buy us some time.

654
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,063
All right.

655
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,398
You're in charge out there.

656
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,498
OK.

657
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:52,009
OK, executive decision.

658
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,044
Let's turn this
around and head back.

659
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,144
I'm not going over water like this.

660
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,601
Something that shaman told me back
in town kind of freaked me out.

661
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,503
What's that?

662
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,606
Legend has it that the shadow people
are led by a white demon named Savior.

663
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,074
Yeah?

664
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:28,612
And the shaman told me that Savior
carried you in his arms.

665
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,712
Now, you're possessed by him.

666
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,152
So I've got that going for me.

667
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:41,258
My god, it's ringing.

668
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,432
This will never work.

669
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,467
Yeah, got any better ideas?

670
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,336
Duct tape.

671
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,604
Look, maybe if you
just stop bitching.

672
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,371
Mr. Bauer?

673
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:56,471
Yeah?

674
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,310
Continue this later.

675
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,211
Yeah, hello?

676
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,413
You stupid asshole.

677
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,482
Call me an asshole, bitch.

678
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,117
Martin?

679
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,051
Ann?

680
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,253
You know that person?

681
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:10,254
It's my wife.

682
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,955
Great, his wife.

683
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,023
Maybe my mommy will call next.

684
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,224
She'll let us land.

685
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,225
You want to shut up so I can hear?

686
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:16,493
Marty?

687
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:19,429
Ann, calling to talk
to your boyfriend?

688
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:23,901
That pompous ass
is not my boyfriend.

689
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:24,668
What are you doing?

690
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:26,370
Here?

691
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,505
Well I just figured
our reconciliation

692
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,307
went so well that I should probably

693
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,976
go back home and clean the pizza
boxes off your side of the bed.

694
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,144
You are such a jerk.

695
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,312
Look, Ann.

696
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,647
I'm kind of busy here right now, so.

697
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,450
Martin, it's really important
that I speak to Dr. North.

698
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,186
Well, I don't think
you're going to have a very

699
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,453
enlightening conversation.

700
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:46,423
You see, Dr. North is doing his
best not to swallow his own tongue.

701
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,125
My god, the bees got out?

702
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:49,626
How in the hell do
you know about that?

703
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,128
It's too long to explain.

704
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,596
Is anybody else hurt?

705
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,530
Yeah.

706
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,099
We got four down so far.

707
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,101
And from the looks of
them, I don't even think

708
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,670
they're going to make the meal.

709
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,471
Listen, I don't think we can
keep the bees out of the cabin

710
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,173
much longer.
We got to land this thing.

711
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,208
Well, I'm working on that.

712
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,410
And I think I found a serum.

713
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,045
We'll meet you wherever you land.

714
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,147
Deal.

715
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,648
It will be good to see you again.

716
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,218
Yeah?

717
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,219
You too.

718
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,153
Bye.

719
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,253
Bye.

720
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,724
Scott Turner.

721
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,559
Scotty, how come that plane
is not on the ground yet?

722
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:23,493
I told you.

723
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:24,394
We are trying.

724
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:26,494
We are trying very hard.

725
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,472
For Christ's sake, what was that?

726
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,207
I'm going to have
to get back to you.

727
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,108
Ann?

728
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,510
Ann?
- So now what?

729
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,984
Walk, I guess.

730
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:50,620
I was afraid you
were going to say that.

731
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,727
Raka?
- Ann?

732
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,302
We're more than 100 miles from
the eastern border, aren't we?

733
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,637
Probably two.

734
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,172
And the new
superhighway is only supposed

735
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,708
to run 100 miles, right?

736
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,808
That's what I heard in the news.

737
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:19,416
So why is there all this
road construction equipment way

738
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,685
out here?
- That's a good question.

739
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,289
Let's go.

740
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,165
All right.

741
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,099
How's it going?

742
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,634
Done?

743
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,703
Well, as done as I could do
with duct tape and blankets.

744
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:41,238
Let's take a look.

745
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,173
Your controls.

746
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,107
OK.

747
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,242
Thanks for the info.

748
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,342
Out.

749
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,248
I know why they won't let us land.

750
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,685
I just talked to a friend of mine
over at Ecuadorian Internationals.

751
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,687
Rumor is we're carrying
a type of virus,

752
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,722
like the Ebola or something.
- What?

753
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,290
Somebody got a call from the US.

754
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,060
State Department confirming.

755
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,461
US State Department?

756
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,129
No one's ever going
to let us land if they

757
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,065
think we have a virus on board.

758
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,165
Looks like we're on our own up here.

759
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:12,836
Can help you, sir?

760
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,371
I'm sure you can.

761
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:17,574
I'm positive there's a passenger
that needs a barf bag or a pillow.

762
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:18,608
Why don't you go find...

763
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,077
I think everyone is OK, sir.

764
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,478
Why don't you return to your seat?

765
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,113
No can do, sky waitress.

766
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,214
I'm here to see the captain.

767
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,083
Well, he's very busy now, sir.

768
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,684
Look, Kristi, love.

769
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,219
You either move out of my way or I'm

770
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,689
going to be forced to put you
on the low rent section of this bus.

771
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,291
Do you know what I mean?

772
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,760
Of course I do, sir.

773
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,263
Now, let me tell you what I need.

774
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,800
First, the name is
Michelle, not Kristi, love.

775
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,804
Second, this is Interamerica's
flight number 71, not

776
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,273
some rickety, old southern bus.

777
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,410
Third, when I tell
you to take your seat,

778
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,814
it is for your safety, as well as
the safety of others around you.

779
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,584
Sir, we're going to be landing soon.

780
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:01,718
Let me put your tray in it's...

781
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,652
locked position.

782
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,592
Thank you for flying Interamericas.

783
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,692
Have a nice day.

784
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,233
Now what?

785
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,333
Let's go check the blankets.

786
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,297
Tell him we're not
going to hurt him.

787
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,839
I understand he's a shaman.

788
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,942
He must be a proud man.

789
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,244
Is he wise too?

790
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,782
Do you know who I am?

791
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,655
I'm the asshole.

792
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,470
Ask him about the shadow people.

793
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,777
Where are they?

794
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,213
Por favor.

795
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:36,913
Por favor.

796
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,516
Por favor my ass.

797
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,918
I know you know where they are.

798
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,018
Point it out on the map.

799
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,327
Do you know what this is?

800
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,298
It shoots people.

801
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,667
Sir, you're wasting our time here.

802
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,767
He doesn't know.

803
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:06,877
Now, this kid, he's
got a three-year-old daughter.

804
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:11,381
I know him and I
don't even know you.

805
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,500
Once upon a time.

806
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:42,937
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

807
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,460
Shadow people.

808
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,801
Hey, Mr. Ezekial, take
a look at this place.

809
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,511
These aren't the
coordinates the shaman gave me.

810
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,713
Looks like someone screwed up.

811
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,381
Buzzard?

812
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,950
It's E.
- Yes, sir.

813
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,751
I'm in the air.
Go ahead.

814
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,454
I have another assignment for you.

815
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:25,889
Burn them down.
- Yes, sir.

816
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,989
Requesting coordinates.
Over.

817
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,840
I thought you could
use a pick me up.

818
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,774
Great.

819
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:18,708
Thanks, Bonnie.

820
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,808
No problem.

821
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,516
So far we've got, you know,
everything sealed off from here

822
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:29,784
on down, but I don't know how
we're going to get behind this...

823
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:46,936
Get him off the control.

824
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,036
Shit.

825
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,724
Holy shit.

826
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:08,925
Rick?

827
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,727
My god.

828
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,827
How the...

829
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:15,565
Look.

830
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,665
Get... get it.

831
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,175
Mr. Bauer?

832
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,220
What is that?

833
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,621
I don't think our friends liked
that last bump in the road.

834
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,181
God.

835
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:10,120
Shit.

836
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,655
Going to need some help here.

837
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,664
My god.

838
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,772
Naomi.

839
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,824
Eat this and that.

840
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:48,792
Come on.

841
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,560
You want a piece of this?

842
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,962
And that, you want some of this?

843
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,062
You don't want none of this.

844
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,535
Come and get some of this.

845
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,635
Take that and that.

846
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,822
Buzzard, it's E.

847
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:19,956
Go for Buzzard.

848
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,192
The ocean is out.

849
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:26,062
Our vitamin bee project has
made an unscheduled U-turn.

850
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,665
Can you drop them somewhere else?

851
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:29,933
Recommendation, sir?

852
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,601
Somewhere nice and quiet.

853
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,069
How about Negro?

854
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,771
Over.
- Sounds good to me.

855
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,272
Right, sir.
- 10-4.

856
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,740
This is Buzzard out.

857
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,243
I love this job.

858
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:55,156
That could be them.

859
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,663
Do you ever get the
feeling that we're...

860
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,763
Ann?

861
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,180
I do not like this.

862
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,716
I'm with you.

863
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,816
Come on.

864
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,995
Ideas?

865
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,095
Just got to think.

866
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,409
I have an idea.

867
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,378
Yeah?

868
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,478
Run.

869
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,417
Go, go, go.

870
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,965
Think we lost him.

871
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:09,899
I think we lost him.

872
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,101
What?

873
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,201
Game over.

874
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,784
This is not good.

875
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,452
Any other bright ideas?

876
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:30,386
None right now.

877
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,088
I'll let you know.

878
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,790
Hi, fellas.

879
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,859
Is there an Ann Bauer with us?

880
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:39,862
What the hell was that?

881
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:43,099
Is there an Ann Bauer with us?

882
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,199
So you're breaking hearts
way out here too?

883
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,472
I'm Ann Bauer.

884
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:52,909
Ann Bauer, nice to see you when

885
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:56,913
you're not bleeding to death.

886
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:04,420
I'm Savior.

887
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,520
Meet the shadow people.

888
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,197
How's everybody doing?

889
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,867
Well, the bathroom
guy's just about gone.

890
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,268
What about you?

891
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,270
I can't even get anybody
to answer me anymore.

892
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,173
It's like we're the
pariah of the sky.

893
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,075
The natives are getting
restless back there.

894
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,175
What do you want me to tell them?

895
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,016
Tell them to screw it.

896
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,885
I can't set her down now because
there's mountains all over.

897
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,353
An hour south of here is farm land.

898
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:39,889
It should be bumpy, but safe.

899
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,989
I'm setting her down.

900
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,960
OK.

901
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,348
Careful.

902
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,835
You think those are
there to freak me out?

903
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,438
Because if they are, it's working.

904
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:33,142
Those are Okupis, poison dart frogs.

905
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,844
Poison dart frogs, great.

906
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:39,048
Their bile is dipped on the tips of
darts, strongest poison in the jungle.

907
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:43,553
Ann, if that's the strongest
poison in the jungle,

908
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,923
why is she putting
it in drinking jugs?

909
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:10,246
7165 west, 0079 north.

910
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,849
Got that?
Is it clear?

911
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,485
You'll see us half a click
away from the village.

912
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,585
10-4.

913
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,013
But you're a doctor.

914
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,382
A small and exclusive practice.

915
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,482
This is ridiculous.

916
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:55,158
I wish you had not come, Ann Bauer.

917
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:58,461
Well, I didn't have a choice.

918
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,561
You have the serum.

919
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:05,134
If you don't help us, everyone
on that plane will be dead.

920
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,670
I have greater concerns than that.

921
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:08,971
Greater concerns?

922
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,940
Much.

923
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,309
I'm trying to save a region
that is being systematically

924
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,411
destroyed by your kind.

925
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:19,182
Pollution from your factories
is killing our people,

926
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:23,219
poisoning our river,
driving us from our land.

927
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:26,589
You're killing us for
your precious oil.

928
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,691
This is one small example
of your government's

929
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:32,161
policy of sacrificing the
environment for corporate greed.

930
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,261
Savior, I'm on your side.

931
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,433
These are ordinary people.

932
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,702
This isn't about politics.

933
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:44,674
Blank people,
they're not my concern.

934
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,275
Blank people?

935
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:52,582
Blank people... blank
in color, blank in honor,

936
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,717
blank in soul, blank.

937
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,488
Savior, please.

938
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:07,129
My... someone very close
to me is on that plane.

939
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,229
Blank.

940
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,503
No.

941
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,810
He's OK, right?

942
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,617
He's OK, right?

943
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,131
Come here.

944
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,671
We're going to get out of here.

945
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,771
I promise.

946
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,345
It's OK.

947
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:36,385
One potato, two
potato, three potato.

948
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:40,523
All right, boys, make some noise.

949
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:46,762
Now I must ask you
to go and never return.

950
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,065
Savior, give us the serum.

951
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:51,634
We'll leave and I swear
we'll never return.

952
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,936
You idiot, you were followed.

953
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,432
Yeah, boss?

954
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:24,800
We're getting no resistance here.

955
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,236
I think five minutes should do it.

956
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,373
Nothing like
a few well-placed rounds.

957
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:07,570
Ann Bauer.

958
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,540
Ann, read about you in the paper.

959
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,640
You hurt?

960
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,876
Ann?
Son of a...

961
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,581
Sorry, you were saying?

962
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:22,885
You're the guy who does the videos?

963
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,688
Who do you think you are?

964
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:29,592
Are you like a genius or a fool?

965
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,527
This is my business.

966
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:35,931
Nobody gets to shoot anything or
anybody without my permission.

967
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,031
Kiss my ass.

968
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:41,570
You know what this is?

969
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:47,843
It's a gun that can
kill you very quickly.

970
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,478
Raka!

971
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:58,587
Nice shooting, Pedro.

972
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,422
The hell is going on here, Ezekial?

973
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:03,359
Thank god.
This man is crazy.

974
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:04,894
Sorry, we're just
cleaning up the mess.

975
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:05,895
Scotty.

976
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,831
Just give me a second, Ann.

977
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,333
So this is Savior.

978
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:15,638
God, I have been looking
forward to meeting you, sir.

979
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:16,605
All right.

980
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,705
All of them, outside, now.

981
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,317
Why, Scotty?

982
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:29,685
Reasonable request.

983
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,520
I'll indulge.

984
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,989
Buddy Savior's been a
huge pain in the poo-poo

985
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:35,858
with these raids on
our oil interests.

986
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,427
Now, with the cross-country
highway going in,

987
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,527
we couldn't have any
more of his shenanigans.

988
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,767
What?

989
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:46,402
Cross country?
- Ann?

990
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:49,538
What happened to 100 miles,
separate but protected?

991
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:53,576
Well, we really couldn't call it
Operation Manifest Destiny now, could we?

992
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:54,510
Think of the PR.

993
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,811
No, no, no.

994
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:59,682
That road's going cross country,
sweetheart, all along the Amazon.

995
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,350
Ann, what's going on?

996
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,952
But why?

997
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:06,555
Ann, do you have any idea the
amount of oil in that region?

998
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,091
More than Texas and Alaska.

999
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:11,527
We need a protected shipping lane.

1000
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:13,829
We can't have these savages
taking over any time they want.

1001
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:16,098
No, no.
That costs money.

1002
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,334
So all this is about
a little bit of money?

1003
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:19,535
No, Ann.

1004
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:22,037
This is about a great deal of money.

1005
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:26,342
$14 billion these low lifes
have cost American businesses.

1006
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,477
I think that quite
frankly, enough's enough.

1007
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:30,012
How do the bees come in?

1008
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:32,982
Well, we needed a clean way to
clear the people from our jungle.

1009
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:34,850
So you went au natural?

1010
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,452
Right.

1011
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:39,922
We genetically engineered these babies,
breeding only the meanest, the toughest.

1012
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,392
And we engineered in a very short
lifespan, only about a week and a half.

1013
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,562
They're better than chemical weapons
because they leave no fingerprints.

1014
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,031
In fact, they're the
perfect soldiers.

1015
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,740
They... they kill
fast, then they die.

1016
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,408
You sound like a proud father.

1017
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:00,709
I am.

1018
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,612
And I am also very proud of you too.

1019
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,546
Really?

1020
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,582
Yes, really.

1021
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:10,519
We've been looking for old pale
face and his posse here for some time.

1022
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:13,789
Who'd have thought the chick I was trying
to bang would lead me right to him?

1023
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,824
I'd get that foot out
of my head if I were you.

1024
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,924
Pity.

1025
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,130
Anyway, the only thing
we didn't count on

1026
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,733
was your Doctor Daffy taking
home bit of our project as a souvenir.

1027
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,670
Which reminds me, what is
the status of that plane?

1028
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,405
They're waiting for your word, sir.

1029
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,505
Good.

1030
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,479
Shoot it down.

1031
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,781
Martin, you have to land the plane.

1032
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:39,715
Bitch.

1033
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,016
Ann?

1034
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:43,116
Damn it.

1035
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,658
Captain, we got a major problem.

1036
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:50,826
Buzzard?

1037
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,194
Go for Buzzard.

1038
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:55,197
Shoot that puppy down.

1039
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,568
You got to put it down.

1040
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,804
And where do you suggest I do that?

1041
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,205
How should I know?
I'm not the pilot.

1042
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,573
You are.
- We're over mountains.

1043
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:05,774
There's nowhere.

1044
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,543
Yeah, well, I don't know about you,

1045
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:08,877
but I'd rather take my chances
with mountains than missile.

1046
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:10,012
Well, maybe you should
fly the goddamn plane.

1047
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,146
All right, well, maybe I should.

1048
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,881
Hey, guys?
I've been listening.

1049
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:14,981
I got an idea.

1050
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,520
Hey.

1051
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,222
Am I going to die?

1052
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,692
Yes, you are, just not today.

1053
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,002
I'm sorry, just tell me again.

1054
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,604
Well, it's actually quite simple.

1055
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,906
Every plane has an
onboard computer, right?

1056
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,575
So?

1057
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,710
So the onboard computer
generates a signal so that air

1058
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,145
traffic knows where we are.

1059
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,680
And this is probably locked
on to that right now.

1060
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,014
So you're going to
turn off that signal?

1061
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,583
No, I don't think I want to do that.

1062
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:49,785
I'm going to duplicate it, you know,
screw with the missile's mind.

1063
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,754
This thing won't let me in.

1064
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:54,223
I got the missile,
100 miles in closing.

1065
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,759
Check your gloves, check your boots,

1066
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:01,096
make sure that absolutely
no skin is showing.

1067
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:02,698
Ezekial?

1068
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:06,602
Sir, bees are allergic to me.

1069
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:11,540
Whatever.

1070
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,640
Let's do this.

1071
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,247
Looking over my shoulder
is definitely not helping.

1072
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,051
Goodbye, Ann.

1073
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,825
Goodbye, Savior.

1074
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,026
Scotty?

1075
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,126
There's a little
problem with your plan.

1076
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,900
You do know I found an antidote?

1077
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,834
Did you now?

1078
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,603
Yeah, I did.

1079
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,773
It's all around you.

1080
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,175
Give me a little hint.

1081
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:50,245
Poison from the Okapi
frog, dart poison.

1082
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:52,548
Bees hate it, won't come near it.

1083
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,648
70 miles.

1084
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:57,886
OK, and then...

1085
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:58,987
Now what?

1086
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:00,789
Now we screw with its mind.

1087
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,624
Come on, duplicate.

1088
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,293
Duplicate.

1089
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:08,630
See, Okapi poison not
only acts as a repellent,

1090
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:13,635
it breaks down the bees' venom
before it can shut down major organs.

1091
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,638
Amazing thing is, I found out later,

1092
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,738
it also speeds up tissue regrowth.

1093
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,680
Gave some to Ann the night
these bastards shot her.

1094
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,216
Really helped with her healing.

1095
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:31,653
55 miles.

1096
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:32,321
Keep doing it.

1097
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,989
Going as fast as I can.

1098
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,858
Now, I want you...

1099
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,695
Get the hell off my land.

1100
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,979
Look.

1101
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,165
It's working.

1102
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,133
How far?

1103
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:20,233
40 miles.

1104
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,439
30 miles.

1105
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:11,153
Seven miles.

1106
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:14,423
It's going to be close.

1107
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,205
Boy, you're ugly.

1108
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,355
One mile.

1109
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,455
Hang on.

1110
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:16,184
No, no, no, no, no.

1111
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:17,152
Pull it back.

1112
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,153
I'm trying.

1113
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,253
Pull it back.

1114
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,260
You got it.

1115
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,360
I got it.
- You got it.

1116
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,996
Yeah!

1117
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,098
Yeah.

1118
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:45,380
Yeah!

1119
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,480
Yeah!

1120
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:52,320
It's Ann.

1121
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,822
Hey.

1122
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:54,956
Martin?

1123
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,492
I don't think I've ever been this
thrilled to hear your voice.

1124
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,494
Yeah, well, same here.

1125
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:02,864
We literally dodged a bullet
on that one, thanks to you.

1126
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:04,299
No charge.

1127
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,402
Actually, you can pay me back later.

1128
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:08,837
I'll be the one with the serum.

1129
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,807
I can't wait.

1130
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,809
I love y...

1131
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,909
Ann?

1132
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,582
Yeah.

1133
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:23,351
How are we supposed to
get this stuff to the plane?

1134
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,054
We will walk if we have to.

1135
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,522
We're going to try.

1136
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:29,622
Ann.

1137
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:42,070
This is going to save lives, doctor,

1138
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,170
human lives, flesh and blood.

1139
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:51,913
You know, a real doctor still
gives a shit about human lives,

1140
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,013
blank or not.

1141
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:05,193
You know, flew medivacs
in 'Nam, '68 through '71.

1142
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:09,729
Got over 500 kids out.

1143
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:18,240
If there's a helicopter I can't
fly, I ain't found it yet.

1144
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,678
Let's go.

1145
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,566
I'm afraid I got some
bad news on my end.

1146
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,501
What's happened?

1147
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,403
Explosion cracked a line.

1148
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,372
We're losing fuel.

1149
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,073
Great.

1150
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:54,609
I'm open to ideas, but I think we
have to land, take our chances.

1151
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:56,709
These can't get everybody.

1152
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:01,614
I have an idea.

1153
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:16,331
There you go, just
like riding a bike.

1154
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,300
I hope not.

1155
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,267
Why?

1156
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:22,637
I always crash my bikes.

1157
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:31,346
You're talking about opening
a door of a plane in flight.

1158
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,381
We'll start to drop,
possibly even crash.

1159
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,483
Well, not before the
bees are sucked out.

1160
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,118
OK.

1161
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:38,253
Who's the idiot who's going
to open the back door?

1162
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:39,721
If he doesn't get stung to death,

1163
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:41,861
he's probably going to get
sucked out with the bees.

1164
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:47,629
Mr. Idiot, at your service.

1165
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:50,532
Shit.

1166
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,467
Flight 71.

1167
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:55,170
This is Savior on route
with serum and med supplies.

1168
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,504
Say heading and altitude, please.

1169
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:58,173
Over.
- Hello, Savior.

1170
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:01,676
This is flight 71 heading
300 and flight level 125,

1171
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:04,179
approximately three miles
southwest of Lago Dos Pedros.

1172
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:05,447
Over.

1173
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:06,648
Roger that, flight 71.

1174
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:10,216
Should be in position to rendezvous
in approximately seven minutes.

1175
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:12,554
Copy that, Savior.

1176
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:15,323
See you soon.

1177
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:18,159
Why did you and
your husband break up?

1178
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:22,264
Martin always cared more
about himself than anyone else.

1179
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:25,634
And that doesn't make
for a good father.

1180
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,503
I never looked at him and
thought, you're my hero.

1181
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,440
I need that.

1182
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:02,335
There they are.

1183
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,446
Yeah?

1184
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,448
Guess what I'm looking at right now.

1185
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,150
I got no clue.

1186
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,418
The rear end of a plane.

1187
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:17,619
Yeah?

1188
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,719
Listen, Ann, I've been thinking.

1189
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:21,656
Now listen to me, OK?

1190
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:24,225
I'm serious.

1191
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:28,063
I think I'm ready.

1192
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:30,732
Ready for what?

1193
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:34,436
You know, you, me, baby makes three,

1194
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,504
you know, Sundays at the park,
you know, the whole thing.

1195
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:37,539
Martin.

1196
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:38,673
You know...

1197
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:39,808
You know, weekends at Coney Island.

1198
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,242
Martin?

1199
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:42,777
Or you know, sports.

1200
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,446
I mean, you don't have any problems with pee wee football, do you?
- Martin?

1201
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,181
What?

1202
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,116
How about dinner?

1203
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,452
No commitments
further than that, OK?

1204
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:52,253
OK.

1205
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:55,123
See you on the ground.

1206
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:56,491
Yeah.

1207
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:57,525
Yeah.

1208
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,625
Bye.

1209
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:09,104
We got to do this now.

1210
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:13,174
Make sure you tie yourself
down with anything that you have.

1211
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,754
We will be opening the rear door
and it will become very windy.

1212
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,751
OK, Rick, I'm all
set and ready to go.

1213
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:23,718
Are you ready?

1214
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:24,652
OK, let's do this thing.

1215
01:25:24,752 --> 01:25:25,587
All right.

1216
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:28,323
On three.

1217
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:32,760
One, two, three.

1218
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:37,864
Shit.

1219
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,766
Look.

1220
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,339
Martin?

1221
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,689
Shit.

1222
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,718
Mr. Bauer!

1223
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:13,092
Mr. Bauer, grab my hand.

1224
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:16,998
Climb, Martin.

1225
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,098
Come on.

1226
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,973
Climb, climb.

1227
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:25,974
You're almost there.

1228
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,074
Grab my hand.

1229
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,080
All right.

1230
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:46,561
Mr. Bauer?

1231
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:48,563
Yeah.

1232
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:53,535
Adam, you are beautiful.

1233
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:56,538
All passengers, take your seats now.

1234
01:27:56,638 --> 01:28:00,475
Interlace your fingers behind your neck
and put your head between your knees.

1235
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:04,579
This is going to be
a very bumpy landing.

1236
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,881
You did it, you son of a bitch.

1237
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:10,585
Rick?

1238
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:13,521
Please take your seat.

1239
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,621
My god.

1240
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:26,000
OK, if you're going to sit
up here, you got to work.

1241
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:30,305
No problem.
Just got to tell me what to do.

1242
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:31,639
What's our altitude?

1243
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:32,874
Where?

1244
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,974
Dial in the center.

1245
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:39,514
Just under 2,000 feet.

1246
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:40,982
Now, lower the landing gear.

1247
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:41,916
Where?

1248
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:45,887
Lever by your left knee.

1249
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:46,888
Yeah.

1250
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,089
That's it.

1251
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,458
Done.

1252
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:52,327
They're landing, Savior.

1253
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:54,427
They're landing.

1254
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,742
Rick?

1255
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:09,842
Rick!

1256
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:17,452
Pull back on the throttle,
lever in the center.

1257
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:23,391
Easy, easy.

1258
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,125
OK, sorry.

1259
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:25,360
It's my first time.

1260
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,361
OK.
- How's that?

1261
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,461
That's great.

1262
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:34,736
When we hit the ground, you push
that lever by your left foot

1263
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:36,371
down with all your might.

1264
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:38,840
You got it.

1265
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,942
Hold on.

1266
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:48,514
Hold on.

1267
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,044
Get ready.

1268
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:18,144
It's going to be a rough one.

1269
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,875
My god, we're alive.

1270
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,251
We made it.

1271
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:32,351
My god, we made it.

1272
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,501
Yeah!

1273
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:48,601
Yeah!

1274
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,256
There we go, little one.

1275
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,300
Yeah.

1276
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,776
Feels pretty good, doc?

1277
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:31,812
Yeah, blank or not.

1278
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:51,263
Hey.

1279
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,737
Raka, this is Martin Bauer.

1280
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:58,837
This is my husband.

1281
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:02,910
The hero.

1282
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,010
The hero.

1283
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:07,782
All right, bee stings.

1284
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:09,882
Sure, yeah.

1285
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,589
What do you say we get out of here?

1286
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:18,426
Fabulous idea.

1287
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:30,336
Was that it?

1288
01:33:32,206 --> 01:33:33,241
Is what it?

1289
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:36,744
Is that how you treat a woman?

1290
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,792
That's it.

1291
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:08,142
So that's how you treat a woman.

1292
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:10,242
Thanks, Mr. B.
