Or the fact that
you and Nick freaking live together?

172
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,422
Shh.

173
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,506
[Asha chuckles]

174
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,092
Can you please help me out here?

175
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,178
Be a maverick in three months.

176
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,932
In the meantime,
if you want to be left alone,

177
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,308
go on the date.

178
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,686
[crockery clattering]

179
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,856
Okay, fine.
I'll meet your little MIT genius.

180
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,984
But no more setups
and you have to take down that profile.

181
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,071
Okay, okay, as long as you agree
to go to the weddings also.

182
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,615
- What?
- It's the best place to find a husband.

183
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,824
I thought online was.

184
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,576
That's also best.

185
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,161
Mom, I have a life.

186
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,663
This is your life too.

187
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,040
You see this one?

188
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,544
Sona's father picked us up from
the airport when we moved to this country.

189
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,922
We had nothing. Eight dollars
and the clothes on our backs.

190
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,049
Really? What was in your suitcases?

191
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,884
The clothes that weren't on our backs.

192
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,886
And this one.

193
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,806
Rohit's mom took care of you
when Priya was born.

194
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,307
That was Kumail's mom.

195
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,187
No. I remember Kumail's mom was having
her gallbladder out. It was Rohit's mom.

196
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,982
Okay, guys,
I... I know that these are your friends...

197
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,569
Not friends, Asha. Family. Community.

198
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:34,198
To you these are just weddings, but to us
this is a celebration of a life we built.

199
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,449
From eight dollars.

200
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,412
Do you understand that I may not want
a husband or partner in my life?

201
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,664
Oh! No! [sobbing]

202
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,874
- No!
- Suneeta?

203
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,212
Oh, <i>beta.</i> I can't let you give up
on a lifetime of happiness.

204
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,881
<i>Beta,</i> we just want what's best for you.

205
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,216
[sobbing continues]

206
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,593
I know what you're doing.

207
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,802
You always do this.

208
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,597
Fine. I'll go to some weddings.

209
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,434
- Not some. All. Show we're not ashamed.
- Mom.

210
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,312
Look, if you do this,
I'll take down your profile.

211
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,522
- Great.
- But you still have to meet Ravi.

212
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,190
I have a good feeling about him.

213
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,108
- No.
- Please.

214
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,318
- Mom, no!
- Yes.

215
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,611
- Mom! No!
<i>- Chup!</i>

216
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,613
[waiter] Order up.

217
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,325
[bell rings]

218
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,285
[sensual music playing]

219
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,754
[music builds to climax]

220
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,758
[chuckles] Ravishankar Shah?

221
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,427
- Oh. Hi! Um, just...
- Ravi?

222
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,845
Just Ravi.

223
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,683
- Do you mind if we order? I'm starving.
- Sure. Um, nice to meet you.

224
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:44,977
What'll it be?

225
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:50,483
Hi. Let me get a double-cheddar burger,
sloppy fries, large, and a water. Thanks.

226
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,030
And he'll have a... What do you have
for “strict vegetarian seeks simple girl"?

227
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,406
Uh...

228
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,283
Not strict, not vegetarian.

229
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,244
I'll have the same.
Just Coke, not water. Thank you.

230
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,847
- [register keys chime]
- That'll be...

231
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,540
Including 6.625 percent tax, 21.40.

232
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,042
Nice.

233
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,003
How'd you do that?

234
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,506
Oh, just a simple girl thing. [chuckles]

235
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,424
[inhales] Thanks.

236
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,468
- Shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,769
So, Ravi, can you really spell anything?

238
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,561
Hmm.

239
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,817
A-N-Y-T-H...

240
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,985
- Come on. Very funny.
- [chuckles]

241
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,696
Spell "logorrhea."

242
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,989
Listen, I don't dance on command. So...

243
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,701
- Make your mom a liar? Spell "logorrhea."
- Seriously?

244
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,660
Mm-hmm.

245
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,914
Oh my God. Okay. Logorrhea.
L-O-G-O-R-R-H-E-A. Logorrhea.

246
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,708
Well done.

247
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,875
- Thank you.
- Definition?

248
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,169
Verbal diarrhea.
Actually a good word for you.

249
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,253
Ah.

250
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,423
Bon appétit.

251
00:11:55,506 --> 00:12:00,010
Your mom forgot to mention your wit.
So subtle and sophisticated.

252
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:04,306
- Yeah, yours left out a couple things too.
- Okay, fine. Here it goes.

253
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,310
Uh, I blew up my engagement
to Jersey's most eligible brown bachelor,

254
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,022
alienated my closest friends,
brought shame and calumny on my family.

255
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,817
I'm no longer allowed
on public transport in Woodbridge.

256
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,736
But that was a misunderstanding.

257
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,780
Yeah, I was just gonna say
you're prettier in person.

258
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,157
Did your mom write that too?

259
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,992
No, that was actually all me.

260
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,536
Ravi.

261
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,122
Asha.

262
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,793
Literally, the only reason I agreed
to meet you here

263
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,629
was so my mom would stop
posting my profile online.

264
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,381
So this...

265
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,716
Us...

266
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,092
...is never gonna happen.

267
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,385
Never gonna happen.

268
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,929
How can you be so sure?

269
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,016
Because our parents set this up.

270
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,641
So?

271
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,019
So?

272
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,395
[scoffs]

273
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,232
Wow. Okay. Um, how about this?
I just started a new job.

274
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,861
It's consuming my life. I have no time
for anything else, and I'm okay with that.

275
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,156
I just took a break from my job,
which was consuming my life.

276
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,992
I have all the time in the world,
and I'm okay with that.

277
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,370
So you basically, like, don't have a job?

278
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,705
[chuckles] Well, actually, I...

279
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,041
What happened to being the start-up guy?

280
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,710
I made money off a start-up,
but it's not who I am.

281
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,420
I prefer to do what I love.

282
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,506
Most can't afford to make that choice.

283
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,092
See, that's interesting.
Can't afford to or are afraid to?

284
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,805
See? We're doomed.

285
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,265
[scoffs] Okay.

286
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,100
Oh, cheer up. You dodged a bullet.

287
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,060
[Ravi] Mm-hmm.

288
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,603
Anyway, a girl must eat.

289
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,771
Mm.

290
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,649
I'm gonna go.

291
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,485
- Okay.
- Yeah. But, um...

292
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,197
Thank you. This has been interesting.

293
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,448
[Asha] Mm-hmm.

294
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,410
- Thanks for the burger.
- Anytime.

295
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,620
Bon appétit.

296
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,703
Yeah.

297
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,048
[Ravi] Whoo! Happy birthday, Pops.

298
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,468
So, Mr. Senior Citizen, how does it feel?

299
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,556
Who'd have thought I'd be father to a man
in his 30s who still acts like a child?

300
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,933
[Veena] Not today, Dinesh. Ravi is here.

301
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,268
I got you this gift.

302
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,436
No, no, no. No presents.

303
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,398
I cannot enjoy my birthday
until my son finds a wife.

304
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,775
He's trying. He went out with Asha.

305
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,486
Ha! And realized
that women want men not boys?

306
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,654
[sighs] Dinesh.

307
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,156
Dad, you wrote
this misleading profile of me.

308
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,119
Saying, "Looking for a simple girl."
I don't want simple. Simple is boring.

309
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,704
You can't be so choosy.

310
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,164
- Dad, I'm proud of my life.
- Oh, good.

311
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,127
Proud of no job, proud of never dating,
proud of that T-shirt.

312
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,881
You were so brilliant, Ravi. Huh? MIT!

313
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,883
Dinesh, what's past is past.

314
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,053
But now is the time for you
to find a good girl.

315
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,097
- Mom.
- Good, not boring.

316
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,765
There's nothing wrong with boring.

317
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,893
Please, <i>beta.</i> Just try.

318
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,020
For me.

319
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,730
Okay fine, Mom. I'll try.

320
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,983
[rhythmic music playing]

321
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,947
Look what I found.

322
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,491
Files on your secret love affair
with a British royal?

323
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,285
Those were destroyed.

324
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:15,372
These are case studies of every microloan
our company has ever funded.

325
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:19,752
Plus, a 1997 swimsuit edition
of <i>Foxy Gals</i> magazine.

326
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,420
Now, I know this isn't yours.

327
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,048
Don't be so sure. I did go to college.

328
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,177
So folders. Like the 1800s?

329
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,137
More like the last 25 years.

330
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,515
I want you to analyze these
and learn what we do,

331
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,643
how we do it, and why we do it.

332
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,526
- [Asha] That could take all summer.
- Mm-hmm.

333
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,439
I want you to be so brilliant,
Singapore can't say no.

334
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,149
But they did say no.

335
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:46,070
I spoke to the higher-ups in London
and a personal friend.

336
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,365
They'll see if they can pull strings
to bring them back.

337
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,700
- If you screw up this time...
- Heads will roll.

338
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,202
[man] That's a bit medieval.

339
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,287
But yes, your head and mine.

340
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,209
I'll also probably lose my job.
I'll have to take my kid out of preschool.

341
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,670
- There goes Princeton!
- Ambitious, this one.

342
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,753
Come, come.

343
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,299
- Mom, I'm at work.
- Oh, no. Don't "I'm at work" me.

344
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,801
Now what did I do?

345
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,136
- You behaved like a total fool!
- What?

346
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,348
Pooja Patel told me
you gave Ravi Shah diarrhea!

347
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,767
What? No! I asked him to spell logorrhea.

348
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,728
- What's that?
- Verbal diarrhea.

349
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,855
You mean diarrhea from the mo...

350
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:27,403
Oh. Well, you better behave
at the next wedding or our deal is off!

[Hindu priest] Today,
our bride and groom come together

353
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,245
to celebrate both the Hindu
and Jewish traditions,

354
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,373
to learn the best of what
each has to offer,

355
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,876
confirming that love,
spoken of in all religions,

356
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,586
is our true meeting place.

357
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,718
It is their promise to be honest, open,
loyal, and devoted to one another.

358
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:55,347
This responsibility speaks of faith
and the love and support of your friends.

359
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,100
[wedding guest] Mazel tov!

[all cheering]

363
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,998
I lost Nick to the uncles.

364
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,000
Better than the bridesmaids.

365
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,545
Beats getting hit on
by that spelling bee nerd.

366
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,757
"Hi, I'm Ravi. I went to MIT.
Wanna play Bananagrams with me?"

367
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,676
"No, thanks, Mr. Nerd.
I'd rather clean a shower drain."

368
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,013
Ah. [chuckles]

369
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,222
- You're the nerd.
- Mm-hmm.

370
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,600
Yeah. I'm a nerd.
I'm a nerd. I love nerds.

371
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,269
SAT scores through the roof!

372
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,479
Okay, I'm gonna go.

373
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
- Good save, though. Smooth.
- Yeah. Yep.

374
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,275
You look thirsty.

375
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,985
Uh, I was actually just leaving.

376
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,528
Oh, you're leaving this time?

377
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,157
- Why tell Pooja Patel about our date?
- Pooja who?

378
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,368
Pooja Patel,
the gossip queen of Little India?

379
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,789
I didn't tell anyone.
Why would I tell someone?

380
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,124
Huh. She was spying on us.

381
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,085
Unbelievable.

382
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,213
Asha, darling.

383
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,049
Ravi. Did you call my niece Twinkle?

384
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,676
[Sheela Auntie] She's Miss India,
New Jersey, you know.

385
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,679
- Nah, Pinky Au...
- She's no brain like you, huh?

386
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,891
But a spelling bee is no Nobel Prize.

387
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,520
Pinky, leave Ravi.
Ravi has time. But Asha.

388
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,314
Suneeta must be desperate.

389
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:32,611
All these doctors and lawyers and PhDs,
they will be snapped up in no time.

390
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,197
And you will be stuck with leftovers.

391
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,868
Think of the shame! Krish getting married
to a younger woman so soon.

392

- Oh my God. You didn't know.<i> Bechari.
- Bechari,</i> Asha, <i>beti. Arre.</i>

393
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,500
You know, really, I'm fine.

394
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,793
No. You know what?

395
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,171
Best thing, you get your revenge
and get engaged quickly.

396
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,340
Oh, I'm not looking for revenge.

397
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,343
I'm looking for a bit of time
to focus on my career.

398
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,721
Darling, careers fade away,
but a husband and a family?

399
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,306
Those are forever, darling.

400
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,350
They're handing out wedding favors
if you wanna...

401
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,060
<i>Beta, </i>don't worry.

402
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,565
We promise not to give up on you
until we know that you're happy.

403
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,567
Happy.

404
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,110
- A hundred percent.
- Yes.

405
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,196
But... can't you see?

406
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,865
I <i>am</i> happy.

407
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,326
Thrilled, in fact,
'cause I met someone too.

408
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,746
My Indian Prince Charming right here.

409
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,708
You two?

410
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,209
[giggles] No, no, no.

411
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,879
I heard from Pooja Patel
it was a disaster.

412
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,089
Disaster? Us? No.

413
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,676
We are the opposite of disaster.
We are perfect together.

414
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,887
Aren't we, Rav? Ravi?

415
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,513
- Uh-huh.
- [Asha] Ravster.

416
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:46,226
She's the simple girl I always wanted,
you know? Right, Asha? Shh.

417
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,812
Very good.
Good luck to you and your simple girl.

418
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,731
<i>Chalo,</i> Pinky. Let's go.

419
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,816
We'll see.

420
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,861
Seriously?

421
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,530
- They're gone, aren't they?
- Yeah, to spread the news.

422
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,408
Come on, I'll just tell them
we broke up at the next wedding.

423
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,828
Then they'll just keep coming back.
So, yeah, good luck.

424
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,207
- Wait. What if I didn't say that?
- Okay.

425
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,377
Would it be so bad to let people think
we're off the market?

426
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,901
Is this how you're gonna ask me out?

427
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,840
I am not asking you out.
Not for real, anyway.

428
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,927
- I dunno where you're going with this.
- You don't have to do anything!

429
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,013
Just fend off the matchmaking aunties
so I can get some work done.

430
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,766
Mm-hmm. Hmm. What's in it for me?

431
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,768
You get your life back.

432
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,228
I have my life.

433
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,024
Uh, no, you don't.

434
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,025
Come on.

435
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,864
[Asha] Think about it. How many
Indian weddings are you invited to?

436
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,157
- Sixteen.
- Nineteen.

437
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,993
We go to the ones we're both invited to.
Brings it down to 14.

438
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,847
- How'd you come up with that?
- Math whiz. Don't question the numbers.

439
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,082
Well, Asha, I'm not even agreeing to one.

440
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,043
If we join forces,
we won't have to deal with all of this.

441
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,712
- Some people enjoy this.
- Do you, Ravi?

442
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,965
You wanna lie, tell everyone we're dating.

443
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,009
Not lie, just role-play
until wedding season's over.

444
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,719
I'm offering you a choice.

445
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,389
Summer with me or summer with...

446
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,306
her.

447
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,516
Hi, Pinky Auntie.

448
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,477
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on both.

449
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,314
Fine, I'll pay you. Fifty bucks a wedding.

450
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,774
God. You're kidding me.

451
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,317
- Seventy-five.
- No.

452
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,111
- One hundred, final offer.
- Five hundred.

453
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,321
- What?
- I'm kidding. [chuckles]

454
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:25,033
Seriously, I'm not interested
in a pretend relationship, okay?

455
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,368
Can we please focus?

456
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,371
Don't be so selfish.
Do this for your parents.

457
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,748
At least until wedding season is over.

458
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,377
<i>He agreed to fake date you?
What's wrong with him?</i>

459
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,753
<i>Actually, what's wrong with you?</i>

460
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,089
I'm a genius, that's what's wrong with me.

461
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,652
What you gonna do when mom finds out?

462
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,218
She'll be thrilled.
That's the whole point.

463
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,762
How do half a billion women
wear these things?

464
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,890
Yeah, she'll be thrilled
until she finds out the truth.

465
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,227
Relax. He's an MIT start-up founder.
He's every mom's dream.

nobody has to be miserable anymore.

Dad, please just let me buy you
a new dishwasher?

470
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,204
That is so typical
of your generation, huh?

471
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,790
Throw money
every time there's a little problem.

You know, Dad, um, you'll be happy
to hear this, actually, um...

474

- I'm gonna see Asha again.
- Oh really?

475
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,050
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

476
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,009
She agreed?

477
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,844
Yeah, Dad, she agreed.

478
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,637
To go out with you again?

479
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,721
Yes.

480
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,224
Are you sure?

481
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,601
Yeah, Dad, I'm sure.

482
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,895
<i>Bete, </i>listen to me.

483
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,731
Don't let this opportunity pass you by.
Act quickly.

484
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,191
Okay Dad, we just met.

485
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,902
Sure. But now is the time
to make your move.

486
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,613
Before she finds out what
we've been up to.

487
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,782
Okay. [chuckles]
Listen Dad, I'm running late.

488
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,699
Yeah.

489
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,118
Please don't hurt your back, okay?

490
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,497
Ravi, remember what your mother said.

491
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,376
The past is the past.
There's no need to bring it up.

492
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,543
Shh.

493
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,880
Bye, Dad.

494
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,424
Veena, he's got another date!

Hey, I have singles.

Asha's happiness is worth more
than one dollar.

So is mine.

499
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,701
Suneeta, you're quite the matchmaker, huh?

500
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,997
Yes. Asha and Ravi made quite
the cute couple at Sona's wedding.

501
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,375
- Really?
- The spelling bee guy?

502
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,585
You could even say, unbelievable.

503
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,505
What is so unbelievable about that?

504
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,799
Well, go and see for yourself.

That's a bit reductive, but yeah.

00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,390
I'm trying to create a lending initiative

00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,056
I told him, "Just meet Asha."

680
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,892
"She's such a good girl.
What's the harm?" Now, see?

681
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,812
They think our way of doing things
is old-fashioned and silly.

682
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:04,107
Asha says our thinking is stuck
in the India of 40 years ago.

683
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,694
But Asha became an economist
like her old man. That's something.

684
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,113
But she's too idealistic.

685
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,364
I admire you, Dinesh.

686
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,450
Running this restaurant,
putting Ravi through college.

687
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,702
It's no small feat.

688
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,620
I wanted more than this for him.
[chuckles]

689
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,248
So tell us more about Ravi's company.

690
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,918
You know these start-ups, huh?
So secretive.

691
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,087
- [Suneeta chuckles]
- Who knows what he does.

692
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,425
Say no more. Asha doesn't want to tell us
anything about her new job either.

693
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,844
To our kids
who think their parents know nothing.

694
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,679
What would they do without us, huh?

695
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,264
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

696
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,307
- They'd be penniless.
- And barren.

697
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,309
[all laughing]

698
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,562
[Tina] Okay, listen to this one.

699
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:47,817
Her alcoholic husband walked out
right after their son was born.

700
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,697
So then we gave her a loan
to open a tea shop.

701
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,242
Her son became the first in her family
to go to high school.

702
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:00,538
Yeah, you know what this means?
These loans were her lucky break.

703
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,374
Now that's a story to believe in.

704
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,251
What are you all smiley, smiley about?

705
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,628
- The suits are coming back.
- Singapore?

706
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,338
Yes!

707
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,923
- In a few weeks.
- No!

708
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,845
Okay, just... I gotta get to work then.

709
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,972
Exactly. But not here.

710
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,351
One of our big donors is having a soiree
and you're going to be my wingwoman.

711
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,437
That is if you don't have another wedding.

712
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,441
Oh, I did, but I told Ravi
I have a sinus infection, so...

713
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:32,195
Oh, that's a great plan. Fake being sick
to fake out your fake boyfriend.

714
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,866
[upbeat music playing]

715
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:41,079
Ever thought of getting out
of this racket and going back to London?

716
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,206
I hadn't until recently.

717
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,042
The head
of our Southeast Asia division just quit.

718
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,587
- Couldn't handle the poverty.
- Would you take that job?

719
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,255
In a New York minute.

720
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,093
But it must be earned, love.
Hence, the return of Singapore.

721
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,928
No pressure there.

722
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,098
Look, I should go back to the office...

723
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,391
- Desert me and you're fired.
- Okay.

724
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:06,062
Now, come on.
Let's enjoy this bargain drink,

725
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:11,400
this impossibly hip DJ,
and whatever it is hanging in this room.

726
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:16,531
Hey, do you think
that DJ would do Priya's wedding?

727
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,243
Maybe you should go check.
And look out for donors on the way.

728
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,994
Copy that.

729
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,625
Uh...

730
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,085
Hi.

731
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,255
Mr. DJ?

732
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:37,385
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt your set,
and I don't want to cause offense.

733
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,305
But is there any chance
that you do weddings at all?

734
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,476
Uh, actually, someone's booked me solid
on the Indian wedding circuit.

735
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,644
[Asha] Ravi?

736
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,565
Sinus infection cleared up?

737
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,608
Um, well, NyQuil.

738
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,070
- So you're...
- Spellbound. Am I right?

739
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,989
- Mm-hmm.
- [man chuckles]

740
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,658
- Ravi, this is my boss...
- James?

741
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,535
Yo.

742
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,079
- [chuckles]
- Yes.

743
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,416
You'd think they'd have nicer cheese
at a fancy gig like this.

744
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,917
That's butter, dude.

745
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,379
How do you both know each other?

746
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:18,467
I heard him play a few sets at a club
in Ibiza back in my party boy days.

747
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,927
He brought the house down.

748
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,096
- [Ravi and James chuckle]
- Clearly.

749
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,848
Okay.

750
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,683
Well, I'm gonna go schmooze.

751
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,185
- I'm gonna...
- Not you.

752
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,436
Enjoy the butter.

753
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,519
Thanks, buddy.

754
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,024
You want to grab some air?

755
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,568
Yeah, uh, I could do air.

756
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,694
Air is good.

757
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,071
Keep it chill. No lasers.

758
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,157
- Have a little faith, Rav.
- I have no faith.

759
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,366
Nice to see you, Yoshi.

760
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,952
Nice to see you too.
Is your sister still engaged?

761
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,245
[Asha] Yes, she is.

762
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,705
[Yoshi] All right, cool.

763
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,541
How's everyone doing? All right.

764
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,794
DJ Spellbound's a little busy,
so Yoshi's in the house.

765
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,883
- So, DJ Spellbound, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

766
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,719
- That's not ironic at all.
- [chuckles]

767
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,681
You know, it started as joke,
but, um, kinda just stuck.

768
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,891
Hmm.

769
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,811
[chuckles softly]

770
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:17,568
So, um, what's your big secret?
Why don't you have a real boyfriend?

771
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,737
- [Asha scoffs]
- [Ravi chuckles]

772
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,531
Why don't I have a real boyfriend?

773
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,575
I think it's a legit question here.

774
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,577
Okay, yeah. It is.

775
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:34,001
After things ended with Krish,
I figured why stop there?

776
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,585
Mm.

777
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:43,052
So I quit my job, moved to Jersey
in the hope of starting over in many ways.

778
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,595
[sighs]

779
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,974
Of course, my mom thinks
I quit banking just to spite her.

780
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,475
- Did you?
- Probably.

781
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,558
[chuckles]

782
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:56,315
So what about you?
DJ... ing, how did that happen?

783
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,236
You know, my backup skill set is spelling
incredibly esoteric words.

784
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,029
Can't really make a living off that.

785
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,906
- Logorrhea. I mean...
- Logorrhea.

786
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:09,954
But no, like, when I was a kid,
everything I did was for my parents.

787
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:14,292
Right? Everything. Except music.
Music was for me.

788
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,544
I mean, music used to make me happy.

789
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,256
But, uh, lately, I don't know. I mean...

790
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:25,011
I've been on the road for, like,
ten years just working nonstop.

791
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,179
I don't know what I'm working for anymore.

792
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,847
So...

793
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:34,186
I figured I'd take a break,
just come back home and fix my family.

794
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,270
[scoffs]

795
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,149
I'm sorry. It's kind of complicated.

796
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,409
[high energy dance music playing]

797
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,994
Damn it, Yoshi.

798
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,663
- I'm sorry. I gotta...
- Yeah, you gotta go.

799
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,790
- DJ stuff.
- Yeah, I gotta... Right.

800
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,792
Are we good?

801
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,464
We're good. We're cool. Yeah.

802
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,547
Great.

803
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,467
Yoshi!

804
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,093
Oh, God.

805
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,599
I can't believe he's Spellbound.

806
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,310
[Asha] Wait, you actually know who he is?

807
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,980
I don't, I'm a nerd,
but he's got like a gazillion followers.

808
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,982
I do not trust DJs.

809
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,835
- [Asha chuckles]
- Why? What's wrong with DJs?

810
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,046
I'm sure they're talented.
I don't understand what they do,

811
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,154
so don't respect it.

812
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,698
- What's he hiding?
- I don't think he's hiding anything.

813
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,949
It just never came up.

814
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:34,288
You've been to a bazillion weddings
and never asked him about his background?

815
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,626
I... I didn't want him
to get the wrong idea.

816
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,545
Ash, what if it's not the wrong idea?

817
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,798
Priya, have you been talking to Mom again?

818
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,966
Let it happen. You want it, sis.

819
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,926
- Shh!
- [Priya] But...

820
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,969
What you want...

821
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,849
is a Mumbai Monster.

822
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,768
A Mumbai Monster.

823
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,103
What is it?

824
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:02,566
It's a masala mojito infused
with cumin seeds and Kashmiri chilies.

825
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,651
It is...

826
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,028
- [chokes]
- [Asha] Oh.

827
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,363
That good, huh?

828
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,989
Oh my God. That's disgusting.

829
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,034
So what do we know about him?

830
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,414
Okay, he was born in Jersey City
and he graduated MIT 2011.

831
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,708
My pal Joby graduated in 2010.
I can see what I can find out.

832
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,627
No, we're not snooping on Ravi.

833
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,753
[Nick] It's not snooping.

834
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,090
I'm collecting information
about him without him knowing.

835
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:30,261
If he is gonna join our family,
we got to find out who he really is.

836
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,264
He's not joining our family, guys, okay?
We're just...

837
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,516
You're just more than fake dating.

838
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,476
You like him, admit it.

839
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,690
So Nick, how's the, um...
How's the Hindi coming along?

840
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,279
[in Hindi] The bride is
driving pickles around.

841
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,241
[in English] He's very good.

842
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,076
[low chuckle]

843
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,037
I said, "It's going great." Right?

844
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:57,955
Pretty much.

845
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:02,251
Hey, babe. Maybe you don't need
to try so hard to impress Mom and Dad.

846
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,544
Yes, I do. I do.

847

1026
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,659
- I gotta check that. Sorry.
- No, you don't.

1027
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,786
[Asha chuckles]

1028
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,916
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1029
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,296
It's James. Singapore's coming back.
They're gonna be here in nine hours.

1030
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,255
On a Sunday?

1031
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:54,301
Yeah. I'm not ready. I dropped the ball.
I have five years of stories left.

1032
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,889
Asha, I've seen you
bust your ass all summer

1033
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,225
going through these boxes
looking for this story to believe in.

1034
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,645
I don't wanna overstep, but I don't think
you'll find that story in a box.

1035
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,689
What does that mean?

1036
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,900
You're the story. Okay?

1037
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:13,945
For what it's worth, I believe
in that story like I believe in you.

1038
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,405
They'll believe in you.

1039
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,533
I'm scared, Ravi.

1040
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,368
Everybody's scared.

1041
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,955
But you've done
the hard work already, right?

1042
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,751
Now you just gotta own what you want,
listen to your heart,

1043
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,754
and just let your love
be greater than your fear.

1044
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,344
[sighs]

1045
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,347
Come here.

1046
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,478
You got this.

1047
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,654
Ready to clean out the bank of Singapore?

1048
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,697
Beat you to it.

1049
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,033
Excuse me. You're making progress.

1050
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,204
Now, get changed,
and let's go knock their Gucci socks off.

1051
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:05,872
I am changed.

1052
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,373
Oh.

1053
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,543
Right.

1054
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,004
You sure?

1055
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,089
Sure.

1056
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,592
Thank you.

1057
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,223
[sighs]

1058
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,434
When I was three years old,

1059
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:30,939
I shocked my parents by calculating
a 12% tip on a pizza delivery.

1060
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,150
Numbers've never failed me.

1061
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,737
But today, I am not here
to talk about numbers.

1062
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,117
I'm here to talk about her.

1063
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,538
When we gave Chinda a loan
to open her tailor shop,

1064
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,165
we gave her a new life.

1065
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,712
We also gave her daughters the ability
to become the first in their family

1066
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,130
to attend high school.

1067
00:52:56,131 --> 00:53:02,262
Like Chinda, my grandfather...
my <i>dada-ji, </i>also received a loan.

1068
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,225
When floods destroyed his crops
in the small town called Mirzapur,

1069
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:11,104
he moved to Mumbai and borrowed
1000 rupees to buy this boat.

1070
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,774
With the money that he made fishing,

1071
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:19,112
he was able to send my father
to Ohio State to study economics,

1072
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,992
making my dad the first
in our family to finish college.

1073
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,873
I am standing in this room today
because of this boat

1074
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:33,001
and because of the sacrifices
that my parents made

1075
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,671
to make sure
their children had a better life.

1076
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,924
[emotional music playing]

1077
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,468
Our story is a reminder

1078
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:45,305
that these loans aren't just a chance
to change a woman's life,

1079
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,143
but the chance to change her
entire family's future.

1080
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,604
Across continents,

1081
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,773
for generations to come.

1082
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,822
And if we're being honest,

1083
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,576
our lives are better
when their lives are better.

1084
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,580
Or as my father would say,

1085
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,167
"A rising tide lifts all boats."

1086
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,211
That's the real story here.

1087
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:25,387
The question is, how many stories
are we willing to rewrite?

1088
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,158
Hey.

1089
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,242
Hey yourself.

1090
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,744
[both chuckle]

1091
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:51,996
Thank you.

1092
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,627
How can you afford to buy
so many of these?

1093
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,048
I'm hopelessly addicted to caffeine
and prefer not to drink alone.

1094
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,925
Enjoy it while you can.

1095
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,178
Wait, what?

1096
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,683
Unfortunately, I won't be able
to keep you here.

1097
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,520
James, I thought we...

1098
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:20,734
You convinced them to invest
an additional ten million beyond our ask.

1099
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,817
What?

1100
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,445
Oh my God!

1101
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,739
And you're firing me?

1102
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,742
Hardly. When I told London the good news,

1103
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,746
they decided to offer
the Southeast Asia division to you.

1104
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,165
But that's your promotion.

1105
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,125
[scoffs] London can wait.

1106
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:40,003
And let's be honest,
I couldn't do half the job you will.

1107
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,713
No, no, no. I can't accept that.

1108
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,465
You don't have a choice.

1109
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:46,176
Now, not only did Singapore come through,

1110
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:49,637
but we received an additional
massive donation from Red Star

1111
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,389
that really got London's attention.

1112
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,058
All because of you.

1113
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,227
- Red Star?
- Another charitable trust.

how to spend all this money. [chuckles]

were joining us for lunch. Hello.

You and Asha seem so happy, we thought...

1186
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,774
And then maybe my mom got a crazy idea?

1187
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,402
Suneeta, I told you
not to let the bull hit you.

1188
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,945
Boy, is that true, Mr. M.

1189
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,905
Always with the sayings, Vijay!

1190
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,491
Okay, then, so what is this big news?

1191
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:42,912
Singapore, Ma!
I got the funding for the loan initiative.

1192
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,081
- Oh my God! Congrats!
- Hey!

1193
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,457
Thank you.

1194
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,959
Is that a promotion?

1195
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,253
Yes, actually. And a raise.

1196
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,504
- [scoffs]
- More travel?

1197
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:56,217
You could say that. The position is in
the company headquarters in London, so...

1198
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,722
London, London?

1199
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,515
Oh no. London, England, babe.

1200
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,810
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't accept this. No.

1201
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,854
When were you gonna tell me?

1202
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,065
Uh, right now.
That's literally what this is.

1203
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,402
[Priya sighs]

1204
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,987
Wow, London. That's, um...

1205
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,323
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

1206
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:19,906
Thanks, Dad.

1207
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,746
But look. If you're going to go so far
at least get engaged first.

1208
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:25,830
- Mom!
- [Dinesh] I agree.

1209
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,333
I could check their horoscopes next week.

1210
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,084
No horoscope, none of this nonsense.

1211
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,087
I agree. They care for each other.
That's all that matters.

1212
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:38,301
Yeah. And Ravi, we know you are a kind,
decent, honest boy. Hmm?

1213
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:44,057
Okay, Auntie, it's nice that you say that,
but I... I need to tell you something.

1214
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,351
- Like, all of you.
- [coughs]

1215
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,394
Ravi. [chokes]

1216
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,687
- Dad?
- Dinesh?

1217
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,023
- Are you okay?
- Get some water.

1218
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,149
Are you okay?

1219
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,861
Ravi, don't say anything.
It's your last chance to be happy!

1220
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,238
- Try to relax.
- Quickly, quickly!

1221
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,156
I'm okay.

1222
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,325
Guys, he's fine. He panicked.

1223
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,453
Relax, Dinesh.
They'll get married in their own time.

1224
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,497
- Dad, stop it.
- Whiskey.

1225
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,791
Okay. Uncle,
that's not the reason he panicked.

1226
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:13,753
He panicked 'cause I was gonna tell you
that my biodata, it's all lies.

1227
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,255
But who cares? So is mine. Everyone's is.

1228
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,091
Yeah, but Asha, mine is, like...

1229
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,761
Yeah, but you did go to MIT.
You do run your own company.

1230
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,389
Okay, come on, Dad.
Yeah, I went to MIT. Okay.

1231
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,141
I was 16 years old.
I didn't know what I was doing.

1232
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,479
So I dropped out, by the way.

1233
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,361
That must've been very difficult.
When did you go back?

1234
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,947
I didn't go back, Uncle.

1235
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,200
I couldn't. I just...

1236
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:48,329
I needed time to figure out what I wanted,
without all the pressure.

1237
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,497
And that time, it...

1238
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,833
It saved my life.

1239
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,421
So, yeah, I didn't finish college.

1240
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,425
But I do have a company.

1241
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,137
It's just not a start-up. I'm a DJ.

1242
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,013
- [Nick scoffs]
- [in Hindi] <i>Hai raam.</i>

1243
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,265
Oh.

1244
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,016
[Vijay in English] It's okay.

1245
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,852
Why didn't you just tell me?

1246
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,687
Asha, I tried to.

1247
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:16,107
He should've come clean way sooner,
but it's not a big deal.

1248
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,860
- When we found out, it...
- You and Nick knew about this?

1249
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,319
My buddy Joby told me, yeah.

1250
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,864
You didn't think
it was important to tell me?

1251
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,615
Because we like him.

1252
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,324
Right?

1253
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,287
Oh yeah, no, we like him. Oh yeah, a lot.

1254
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,291
Wait a minute.
Ravi, you had 15 years to make it right?

1255
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,501
Go back to school, get a job, but...

1256
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,379
[scoffs] You become a DJ?

1257
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,215
Ravi, can this lifestyle support a family?

1258
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,299
Dad, don't ask him that.
We're not getting engaged.

1259
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,510
Yeah, Uncle, I can.

1260
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,679
[Asha] And why are you even responding?

1261
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:50,224
I don't need anyone to support me.
Why is this always about supporting me?

1262
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,728
Even if I wanted a family,
I could do it on my own.

1263
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,815
All I would really like is some honesty.

1264
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:01,736
But Asha, wasn't it your idea to pretend
to be a couple in the first place?

1265
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,362
- [mothers] What?
- Oh my God.

1266
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,614
You lied to us, Asha?

1267
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:05,990
How could you do this?

1268
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,116
Because of this!

1269
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:13,122
Because you people drive us insane
with your pressure. This is what happens!

1270
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,458
We are dating now, though.

1271
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:19,796
What's the point of that? You're a DJ.
How will you pay for your kids' college?

1272
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,672
- Mom...
- Anyone smell the...

1273
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,591
'Cause it smells like burning, so...

1274
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:27,261
I told you! No one wants to marry
a bum like you. Now do you see?

1275
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,596
Don't call my son a bum!

1276
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:29,680
You encouraged this!

1277
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,765
Okay, Dad, stop.

1278
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:35,144
Let me ask you. Who do you think paid for
all the catering orders these last months?

1279
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,231
- What?
- Food banks, homeless shelters, the teams.

1280
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:42,318
- What are you talking about?
- Red Star Standard, Dad. Ring a bell?

1281
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,820
[Dinesh] What about it?

1282
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:47,406
Those are my initials, Dad.
That's me, I'm Red Star Standard.

1283
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,408
Red Star Standard?

1284
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:52,702
That's you?

1285
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,373
Yeah. It's this charitable fund I just...

1286
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,499
[whispers] Oh my God.

1287
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,751
- Asha...
- [smoke detector beeping]

1288
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:02,588
[breathes heavily]
No one panic. The aloo gobi's on fire.

1289
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,382
[Suneeta] What? Aloo gobi?

1290
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,967
- Asha, wait.
- [Suneeta] Oh my God!

1291
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,802
[Asha] Did it ever occur to you to ask?

1292
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,262
Why are you so upset?

1293
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,473
Oh. [scoffs] How many more surprises
do you have for me?

1294
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,706
I thought this would make you happy.

1295
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:18,479
"You have to own what you want and trust
your inner voice?" What the hell?

1296
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,564
I meant it.

1297
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,774
But you don't think
I can do my job on my own.

1298
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,569
Asha, you convinced me
it was a good investment...

1299
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:28,614
I wasn't trying to convince <i>you.</i>
I needed to do this by myself.

1300
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,032
I just wanted to help.

1301
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,116
Help?

1302
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:36,289
The way you helped your dad?
Don't you see that it's so patronizing?

1303
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,083
How do you even have so much money?

1304
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,836
Rob a bank? Sell endangered species
off the back of a van.

1305
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,588
No, it's because of Facebook.

1306
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,965
- So you did work at a start-up.
- Not exactly.

1307
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,819
I DJ'd a couple parties for them
back in the day and they couldn't pay.

1308
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,052
Gave me stock instead.

1309
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,597
You made a million bucks
DJing some nerd parties?

1310
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,725
A lot more, actually.
Look, it's no big deal.

1311
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,227
It is a big deal. I am not some cause.

1312
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,896
I know that, Asha. I know that.

1313
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,982
At least Krish was honest about the fact
that he didn't believe in me.

1314
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,526
- You did it behind my back.
- Seriously?

1315
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,989
Let me ask. You ever been honest
about a single relationship?

1316
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,283
- Don't turn this around.
- You wanted to role-play.

1317
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,743
Yeah, and you broke character.

1318
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,039
[emotional music playing]

1319
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,917
There is a big difference
between telling a white lie

1320
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,835
and being completely untruthful.

1321
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,464
Who even are you?

1322
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,426
Asha, I'm the guy
who went to 14 weddings with you.

1323
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,723
Not because I had to.
Not because my parents forced me to.

1324
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,142
I went because I genuinely wanted to.

1325
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,729
That's the only thing
I was untruthful about.

1326
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:44,065
That I didn't have to pretend to be
in love with you.

1327
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,150
Which is what I am, by the way.

1328
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:49,695
I'm in love with you.

1329
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,204
I opened my heart to you, Ravi.

1330
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,043
Do you know what that took?

1331
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,633
And for the record,

1332
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,427
I don't care about MIT.

1333
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,933
I trusted you, and you let me down.

1334
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,318
[sighs]

1335
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,545
Hey, Mom.

1336
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:52,049
I can't believe it, <i>beta.</i> You spent
thousands on orders through Red Star.

1337
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,052
He wouldn't let me help you otherwise, so...

1338
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,557
You were always different,
even as a child.

1339
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:02,935
And I worried for you.

1340
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,647
Mom, what was the point in lying?

1341
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:10,568
Asha and her parents
want nothing to do with me now.

1342
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,946
We were only trying to help.

1343
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,617
Do not blame your mom.
You met Asha because of that biodata.

1344
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,119
Can't you see?

1345
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:24,790
You're our son. We would lie, die,
whatever for your happiness.

1346
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,834
Yeah, Dad, but I <i>was </i>happy.

1347
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,794
Then you should've kept your mouth shut.

1348
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:32,672
Talk to her.

1349
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,551
- She won't take my calls.
- Then go to her.

1350
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,845
[sighs] It doesn't matter.

1351
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,724
I came to tell you I'm going back to work.

1352
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,393
Yoshi lined up
a bunch of gigs, and I just...

1353
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:47,480
- I think it's time.
- Ravi, no.

1354
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:52,234
Mom, I am done lying.
I'm done pretending to be someone I'm not.

1355
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,196
Again, you're running away
the minute things get hard. [scoffs]

1356
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,948
Okay. Here's the thing, Dad.

1357
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,659
I am not running away.

1358
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,121
Okay? This is my job. This is who I am.

1359
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:08,793
I just wish you could see that.
I wish that was enough, but clearly not...

1360
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,836
Ravi, it's not that. We want you...

1361
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,799
We want the son we lost when
he dropped out of MIT and disappeared.

1362
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,887
- We want those years back.
- Yeah, but those years are gone, Dad!

1363
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,347
Those years are gone!

1364
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:28,145
But the son you do have is standing
right in front of you. I am right here.

1365
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,776
[melancholic music playing]

1366
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:34,859
Okay.

1367
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:54,940
I recommend a flat in Shoreditch.

1368
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:58,611
It's murderously expensive,
but you're getting a raise.

1369
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,663
They called again to see if you'd signed.

1370
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:11,581
[phone chimes]

1371
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:20,341
Ash, he's an international DJ.
You'll see him again.

1372
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,635
I don't think so.

1373
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,054
Look. I'm sorry. I'm confused.

1374
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:29,642
This guy that you pretended to date
and thought was broke,

1375
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,560
you actually fell in love with.

1376
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,897
Okay. And, it turns out,
oh, he's crazy rich.

1377
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,942
Not to mention, he helped you get promoted
over your boss.

1378
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,401
He believes in you.

1379
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,196
And this is the guy
you never wanna see again.

1380
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,826
You need to swallow your pride
you need to sign that contract,

1381
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:51,330
and then you need to apologize
to that boy. It is that simple.

1382
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,165
- It's not...
- I don't wanna hear it!

1383
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,960
You know what's not simple?

1384
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:58,753
Seeing you go.

1385
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,800
I'm gonna miss you.

1386
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,218
We're gonna miss you.

1387
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:08,264
I'm gonna hate your phony British accent
you're obviously gonna come home with.

1388
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:13,477
But if you let opportunities
like this pass you by...

1389
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:18,274
- I'm gonna have to kill you.
- [Asha chuckles]

1390
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,567
I know people in this town
who can make that happen.

1391
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,612
- Okay.
- If it's really over, why not just go?

1392
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:24,905
What's holding you back?

1393
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:31,495
I guess my family, my parents, my sister.
I've never left them like this before.

1394
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:35,291
We spend so much energy
trying to get away from our parents.

1395
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,501
And when we finally get the chance...

1396
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,586
[emotional music playing]

1397
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,172
It was hard for me
to leave Jamaica for London.

1398
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:47,720
I didn't want to abandon my parents.
In spite of our differences.

1399
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,471
And how did you?

1400
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:53,142
I realized my life is where I take it.

1401
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,770
My parents will always be there for me.

1402
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:01,108
But opportunities like these
don't come along every day.

1403
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,448
So this is where you're saving the world.

1404
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,326
- Dad?
- [exhales] We were just leaving.

1405
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,122
Mr. Maurya.

1406
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:18,459
What are you doing here?

1407
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,546
You want to go for a walk?

1408
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,176
[hopeful music playing]

1409
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:37,144
<i>Beta, </i>when I was a young economist,
it was a different time.

1410
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:41,523
White men half as smart as me
would get promoted above me.

1411
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,859
I'd get stuck doing their job for them.

1412
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:48,947
You know what my boss said?
He said, "Indians? They're smart, sure,

1413
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,159
but they're numbers guys.
They'll never be leaders."

1414
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:57,331
I know. Makes me so mad.
I'm sorry you had to go through that, Dad.

1415
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:01,168
Which is why I was so worried
that you were being too idealistic.

1416
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:04,713
I didn't want you to face
the same disappointment I had.

1417
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,717
But, um, look at you.

1418
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,387
You did it.

1419
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:16,016
Bigger numbers than I ever dreamt of.

1420
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:17,725
[Asha chuckles]

1421
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:19,895
And you know what makes me the most proud?

1422
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,981
That you did it on your own terms.

1423
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,902
<i>Jah, beti.</i> Go to London. You deserve it.

1424
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:30,948
- [sighs]
- Go have the experience of a lifetime.

1425
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,575
For me.

1426
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,165
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

1427
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,918
I'm sorry we drove you crazy.

1428
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:47,131
- I blame it on your mother.
- [Asha giggles]

1429
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:52,344
I think I have time for some ice cream.

1430
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,388
What kind of job is this?

1431
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,485
[soft emotional music playing]

1432
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,870
[inaudible chatter]

1433
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,542
<i>Offo,</i> where is your sister?

1434
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,294
Getting her makeup done. Relax.

1435
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:28,380
<i>Hai Bhagwan.</i>
Why is she only wearing one necklace?

1436
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:31,133
'Cause she's not Mr. T, Ma.

1437
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:36,013
Well, she's late now. Call and see
what time they left their home.

1438
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,932
Their home? What do you mean "their home"?

1439
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:43,103
You think I was born yesterday.
I know about the boyfriends.

1440
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,397
The sneaking around at night.

1441
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:48,400
And the fact that
Nick and Priya live together.

1442
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:52,863
And yet you didn't say anything.
That is very unlike you.

1443
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:57,784
I wanted her to tell me. I wanted
my daughters to tell me everything.

1444
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,875
Well, you know, Ma,
that we've always wanted to.

1445
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,003
We just didn't know how.

1446
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:12,132
We never really speak
about that stuff in our family.

1447
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,970
You never really even told me
about your life before I was born.

1448
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:21,683
What is there to tell?
I drove my parents crazy, just like you.

1449
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,561
I find that very hard to believe.

1450
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:29,316
- I also know you found that photo.
- Of you and that boy?

1451
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:30,400
[chuckles]

1452
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:34,905
Parag and I were neighbors.
Our fathers were old friends.

1453
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:37,366
When Parag would come for tea
with his father,

1454
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:40,410
we would sit in the garden
and talk for hours.

1455
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,871
Of course, we fell in love.

1456
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,793
When it came time to arrange my marriage,
I told my parents about him,

1457
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:49,211
but they forbade it.

1458
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,965
He was from a different caste, they said.

1459
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:57,469
My father never spoke
to Parag's family again.

1460
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:04,935
My parents arranged a <i>shaadi </i>for me
to your father and my fate was sealed.

1461
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:08,187
Mom.

1462
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,944
That must have been so heartbreaking.

1463
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:15,987
It was.

1464
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,741
[chuckles] At first,
I pretended to love your dad.

1465
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,370
But eventually,
I didn't need to pretend anymore.

1466
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:29,751
And now I have you girls
and this beautiful life.

1467
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,674
Do you ever think about him?

1468
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,677
Oh yeah, from time to time.

1469
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,389
I told myself, if I ever had daughters,
I would let them choose their fate,

1470
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:43,557
their happiness.

1471
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:49,730
Yeah, as long as we have five MBAs,
choose a nice guy, and make round rotis.

1472
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:52,816
- This looks good. You should wear this.
- This isn't <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

1473
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:56,486
Listen to you, Miss Taco Bell.
When have you even made one roti?

1474
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,114
- I made, like, a quarter once.
- Yeah, once.

1475
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:04,286
Oh, <i>beta.</i> I hate to see you go to London.

1476
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:08,206
But that is your fate.

1477
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:15,756
And darling, I know Ravi's not perfect,
but I feel he's your happiness.

1478
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,258
I see the way he looks at you.

1479
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:21,386
It's exactly the same way
your father's looked at me

1480
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,013
since the day we met.

1481
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,936
- Why are you sitting around? Priya's gone!
- What?

1482
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,100
She's didn't show up for makeup
and her phone is off.

1483
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,232
She was supposed to do that an hour ago.

1484
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:37,194
Calm down. She's gotta be here somewhere.
Let's split up.

1485
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:38,320
Should've had sons.

1486
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,113
Vijay, call 911!

1487
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,491
- I go this way, you that way.
- Yeah, okay.

1488
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:43,992
- Priya?
- [Vijay] Priya?

1489
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:46,119
- [women shriek]
- Ah! Sorry, Aunties.

1490
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,537
[rhythmic music playing]

1491
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:48,621
Priya!

1492
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:50,832
- Pri!
- Darling?

1493
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,378
- [occupant yells]
- Sorry! How many bathrooms are there?

1494
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,046
Priya? Priya, <i>beta!</i>

1495
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:58,715
Don't worry, everything's fine. Priya!

1496
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,134
- Asha.
- Nick?

1497
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,928
- I need help.
- Have you seen Priya?

1498
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:03,845
- Priya?
- Yes!

1499
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,140
- No. Wait, I need your...
- [groans] Priya! Pri?

1500
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,600
Pri?

1501
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:13,188
- Pri, is that you?
- [Priya] No. [sobs]

1502
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:15,524
- Want to talk about it?
- [Priya] No!

1503
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:19,444
Uh, okay, I don't mean to rush you,
but your guests have started to arrive.

1504
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,987
[Priya] I don't care!

1505
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,323
Come on, open up. It's only me.

1506
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:24,783
[Priya] It's fricking open.

1507
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,536
Oh. [sighs]

1508
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:30,414
- What is going on here?
- [grunts]

1509
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,750
I didn't want the ice sculptures.
I didn't...

1510
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:38,171
I didn't want the gold-leaf cake,
and why can't he just wear a tuxedo?

1511
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,800
Okay, Dr. Priya, time for a little chat.

1512
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,678
He won't even tell me
what his big surprise is.

1513
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:47,180
Then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

1514
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:52,519
I don't think this is about cakes
or ice sculptures or surprises.

1515
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:56,064
- I think this is about you.
- How is this possibly about me?

1516
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:59,443
For some reason, I think
this whole seven lifetimes thing

1517
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,986
has you kind of freaked out.

1518
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,283
It just got me thinking.

1519
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:09,745
Every generation in our family
has done this for centuries.

1520
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,664
What if I'm the first one to screw it up?

1521
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,835
You don't have to worry.
I already screwed it up.

1522
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:18,920
But I'm the first one to marry someone
who isn't Indian.

1523
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:22,007
Is that what this is about? 'Cause Nick is
way more Indian than we are.

1524
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:26,344
Are you seriously gonna say that to me?
How's that supposed to make me feel...

1525
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,054
I know. Listen, listen, listen.

1526
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:32,267
- [sobs]
- Nick is crazy about you.

1527
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,605
Okay? I mean, otherwise
he wouldn't be dressed the way he is.

1528
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,982
- How's he dressed?
- Doesn't matter.

1529
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,443
What matters is that he loves you.

1532
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,365
Or at least, they will learn to.

1533
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:52,037
The only question that remains is, do you?

1535
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,503
But I'm scared.

1536

We're all scared.

1537
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,054
If you don't marry Nick today,

1538
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,890
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

1539
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:18,355
Pri, you have a chance
to live your life the way you want to.

1540
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,900
So just tune out the noise.

1541
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:24,528
Listen to your heart.

1542
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,949
Let your love be greater than your fear.

1543
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,455

1544

- Yep.

No.

We need to get you into makeup. Now.

Quickly, let's get you ready and dressed.

Yes. Get her some coffee.

Wait, wait, no. Let's get you dressed.

- Oh my God.

1562
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:28,633
And so, I'm alone with this person
who's driving me crazy.

1563
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,136
I had to walk home. Can you imagine that?

1564
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:34,806
- And I decided to keep it.
- Ravi?

1565
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:40,353
- Asha. What're you doing here?
- I was an idiot. I owe you an apology.

Asha, you don't have to...

1567
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:46,693

For going along with my crazy scheme.

What matters is this is a great guy,
you know?

1580

He's brilliant. He's kind.
He's a true original.

1581
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:36,409
He might seem like
a bit of a slacker at first.

1582

I thought so too.

1583
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:42,207
And you should never play him
at Bananagrams. Ever.

1584

As you get to know him, he grows on you.
