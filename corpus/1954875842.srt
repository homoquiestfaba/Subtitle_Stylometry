00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,155
Today is your day of reckoning! >> Ah, that's the
stuff, Reggie. First thing in the morning, I

149
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:47,890
ah, that's the stuff, Reggie. First thing in the
morning, I like to get empty threats from a

150
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:48,690
first thing in the morning, I like to
get empty threats from a shallow man.

151
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,024
Like to get empty threats from a
shallow man. It gets my blood going.

152
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:51,425
Shallow man. It gets my blood going.
You're mine, binew.

153
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:52,759
It gets my blood going. >> You're mine,
binew. >> Just remember to show up at

154
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:53,826
you're mine, binew. >> Just remember
to show up at the wake, Reginald.

155
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:55,561
Just remember to show up at the wake,
Reginald. There'll be a surprise waiting

156
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:56,495
the wake, Reginald. There'll
be a surprise waiting for you.

157
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:57,162
There'll be a surprise
waiting for you. >> Sir.

158
00:07:57,164 --> 00:07:58,830
For you. >> Sir. >> Ah! My ride.

159
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:00,531
Sir. >> Ah! My ride. >> You...

160
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:03,033
Ah! My ride. >> You...
You make me nervous.

161
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,035
You... You make me nervous.
Farewell, Reggie.

162
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:13,842
Aw, mills, it... it seems just like yesterday
that I found you cowering in that broom closet.

163
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:14,776
Like yesterday that I found you cowering
in that broom closet. Poor child.

164
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:16,110
Cowering in that broom closet. Poor child.
You couldn't speak, let alone

165
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:16,810
poor child. You couldn't
speak, let alone write.

166
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:18,411
You couldn't speak, let alone write.
And you gave me soup, sir, a

167
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:19,812
write. >> And you gave me soup, sir,
a warm blanket, and a dictionary.

168
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:21,513
And you gave me soup, sir, a warm blanket, and
a dictionary. >> And I haven't been able to

169
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:22,814
warm blanket, and a dictionary. >> And I
haven't been able to shake you since.

170
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,782
And I haven't been able to shake you since.
Look at you now... my best

171
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,817
shake you since. Look at you now... my
best friend, on-the-rise biographer,

172
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,885
look at you now... my best friend, on-the-rise
biographer, and poet extraordinaire.

173
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:29,585
Friend, on-the-rise biographer, and
poet extraordinaire. >> Yes, sir.

174
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:30,552
And poet extraordinaire. >> Yes, sir.
In fact, I've often thought

175
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:31,553
yes, sir. In fact, I've often thought
that if it wasn't for you...

176
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:34,875
in fact, I've often thought that if it wasn't
for you... >> the road, man! The road!

177
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,866
Mills! A quote from my father. "I drink to bring
myself down to the level of the common man."

178
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,500
"I drink to bring myself down to the level of
the common man. But remember, the common man"

179
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:50,168
the level of the common man. But remember, the
common man drinks, so I must drink twice as

180
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,868
but remember, the common man drinks,
so I must drink twice as much.

181
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,603
Drinks, so I must drink twice as much.
I am a big advocate of an even

182
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,685
"much. I am a big advocate
of an even playing field."

183
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:07,515
Oh, your instincts are incorrect,
liquorsmith. But, being a sporting man, I

184
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:09,149
incorrect, liquorsmith. But, being a sporting
man, I will give you one more chance to

185
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,817
but, being a sporting man, I will give you one
more chance to guess what I'll be purchasing.

186
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:12,618
Will give you one more chance to guess what I'll
be purchasing. >> Well, what are we betting

187
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:12,951
guess what I'll be purchasing. >>
Well, what are we betting today?

188
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:13,785
Well, what are we betting today?
This vest.

189
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,219
Today? >> This vest. >>
I don't like the vest.

190
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,553
This vest. >> I don't like the vest.
How about that tie?

191
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,220
I don't like the vest. How about that tie?
All right.

192
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:22,125
How about that tie? >> All right.
My tie for... Your glasses.

193
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,207
All right. My tie for... Your glasses.
You're on.

194
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:32,033
Oh. Wrong again, liquorsmith.
Mills, collect the spoils.

195
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:33,267
Liquorsmith. Mills, collect the spoils.
Glasses, please.

196
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,034
Mills, collect the spoils. >>
Glasses, please. >> Really?

197
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:35,835
Glasses, please. >> Really?
Yes.

198
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:37,169
Really? >> Yes. >> I can't
see very well without

199
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:38,904
yes. >> I can't see very well without
them, and they're my only pair.

200
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:40,238
I can't see very well without them, and they're
my only pair. >> Well, it seems you have found

201
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,973
them, and they're my only pair. >> Well, it seems
you have found yourself in quite a predicament,

202
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:42,740
well, it seems you have found yourself
in quite a predicament, liquorsmith.

203
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:43,907
Yourself in quite a predicament,
liquorsmith. And here I am with this

204
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:45,775
liquorsmith. And here I am with
this perfectly useless pair of

205
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:46,142
and here I am with this perfectly
useless pair of glasses.

206
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:47,810
Perfectly useless pair of glasses.
Yeah, you just won them in

207
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:48,177
glasses. >> Yeah, you
just won them in the bet.

208
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:48,911
Yeah, you just won them in the bet.
Yes.

209
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:50,245
The bet. >> Yes. >> As
a-a neutral third party,

210
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:51,846
yes. >> As a-a neutral third party,
it seems that you each have what

211
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:52,847
as a-a neutral third party, it seems that
you each have what the other desires.

212
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,648
It seems that you each have what the other
desires. So, gentlemen, may I suggest a-a

213
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:54,981
the other desires. So, gentlemen,
may I suggest a-a barter?

214
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:55,982
So, gentlemen, may I suggest a-a barter?
Excellent idea.

215
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:57,750
Barter? >> Excellent idea. >>
Uh, I might be interested in

216
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:58,150
excellent idea. >> Uh, I might
be interested in a barter.

217
00:09:58,152 --> 00:09:59,951
Uh, I might be interested in a barter.
Tell you what, liquorsmith...

218
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:01,252
a barter. >> Tell you what, liquorsmith...
I will give you these glasses

219
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:02,753
tell you what, liquorsmith... I will give
you these glasses for your finest bottle of

00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:03,920
I will give you these glasses for your
finest bottle of stubborn grouse bourbon.

For your finest bottle of stubborn
grouse bourbon. >> Grouse?

222
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:06,055
Stubborn grouse bourbon. >> Grouse?
Yes, the stubborn grouse.

223
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:07,056
Grouse? >> Yes, the stubborn grouse.
Come on, k. Roth.

00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:08,357
Yes, the stubborn grouse. >> Come on, k.
Roth. >> Well, these do look quite

00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,825
come on, k. Roth. >> Well, these do
look quite charming on me, don't they,

226
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:10,058
well, these do look quite charming
on me, don't they, mills?

227
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,927
Charming on me, don't they, mills?
Perfect fit, sir.

228
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:13,661
Mills? >> Perfect fit, sir.
Grouse.

00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:14,028
Perfect fit, sir. >> Grouse.
Glasses.

230
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,862
Grouse. >> Glasses.
Thank you.

00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,863
Glasses. >> Thank you.
Mind if I have a sip?

232
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,364
Thank you. >> Mind if I have a sip?
No.

233
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:16,864
- Mind if I have a sip?

234
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,898
- No.

235
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,732
Here's an invitation to his
wake tonight.

236
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:19,733
Here's an invitation to his wake tonight.
I hope you can make it.

237
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:20,900
Wake tonight. I hope you can make it.
I know it's short notice, but

238
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:21,934
I hope you can make it. I know it's short
notice, but the doctor only told him a few

239
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:23,235
I know it's short notice, but the doctor only
told him a few days ago, and he hadn't accepted

240
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:24,736
the doctor only told him a few days ago, and he
hadn't accepted the whole affair until late last

241
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:25,069
days ago, and he hadn't accepted the
whole affair until late last night.

242
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,837
The whole affair until late last night.
There'll be drinks, hors

243
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,305
night. >> There'll be drinks, hors
d'oeuvres, and maybe a little

244
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:29,806
there'll be drinks, hors d'oeuvres, and
maybe a little dancing after I kick off.

245
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:30,740
D'oeuvres, and maybe a little dancing
after I kick off. Who knows?

246
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:32,341
Dancing after I kick off. Who knows?
I thought it was very funny,

247
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:34,810
who knows? >> I thought
it was very funny, sir.

248
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:36,344
I thought it was very funny, sir.
Well, sir, where next?

249
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:37,912
Sir. Well, sir, where next?
To the recreation park,

250
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:38,679
well, sir, where next? >> To
the recreation park, mills.

251
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,380
To the recreation park, mills.
I've had some bourbon, with more

252
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:41,180
mills. I've had some bourbon,
with more on the way.

253
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,284
I've had some bourbon, with more on
the way. I'm feeling sprightly now.

254
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:47,152
On the way. I'm feeling sprightly now.
They will think me the fool,

255
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:49,187
I'm feeling sprightly now. They will think
me the fool, mills, in my final moments with

256
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,323
they will think me the fool, mills, in my final
moments with a fatal disease exercising.

257
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:55,693
Mills, in my final moments with a fatal
disease exercising. >> Who are "they," sir?

258
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:57,327
A fatal disease exercising. >> Who are
"they," sir? There you go. Upper-tupper.

259
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:58,328
Who are "they," sir? There you go.
Upper-tupper. >> One...

260
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,030
There you go. Upper-tupper. >> One...
They will call it futile, mills.

261
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:03,265
One... They will call it futile, mills.
They will say I am mad.

262
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,834
They will call it futile, mills. They
will say I am mad. And mad I might be.

263
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,168
They will say I am mad. And mad I might be.
Ah, your stamina is

264
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,202
and mad I might be. >> Ah, your
stamina is inspiring, sir.

265
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:09,636
Ah, your stamina is inspiring, sir.
Thank you, mills.

266
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:11,104
Inspiring, sir. >> Thank you, mills.
Though my hours are dwindling

267
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:12,805
thank you, mills. Though my hours are
dwindling and I am desperate for the

00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,273
though my hours are dwindling and I am desperate
for the answer, I refuse to shirk the

269
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,841
and I am desperate for the answer, I refuse
to shirk the responsibility I have to my

270
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,563
answer, I refuse to shirk the
responsibility I have to my human body.

271
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:36,194
Hello!
I've got business for you!

272
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,666
How may I help you? >> Ah, yes.
We were wondering what kind of

273
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,668
ah, yes. We were wondering what kind
of body-disposal options you carry.

274
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,269
We were wondering what kind of body-disposal
options you carry. >> Let me say first I'm sorry

275
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,403
body-disposal options you carry. >> Let
me say first I'm sorry about your loss.

276
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:49,370
Let me say first I'm sorry
about your loss.

277
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:51,038
About your loss.
Haven't lost anything yet.

278
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,273
Haven't lost anything yet.
I'm dying tonight.

279
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,742
Haven't lost anything yet. I'm
dying tonight. >> You're the body?

280
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:56,275
I'm dying tonight. >> You're the body?
Yes.

281
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:57,809
You're the body? >> Yes.
Well, I admit that I

282
00:11:57,811 --> 00:11:59,744
yes. Well, I admit that I
procrastinated a little.

283
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:01,812
Well, I admit that I procrastinated a
little. >> Usually the family takes care

284
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,947
procrastinated a little. >> Usually the
family takes care of that after the death.

285
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:05,915
Usually the family takes care of that after
the death. >> Oh! So, I am early and we

286
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,783
of that after the death. >> Oh! So, I
am early and we will get a discount!

287
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,986
Oh! So, I am early and we will get a
discount! >> Uh, well, uh, perhaps we

288
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:12,220
will get a discount! >> Uh, well, uh,
perhaps we could work s-something...

289
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,955
uh, well, uh, perhaps we could work
s-something... >> are you all right, friend?

290
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:15,823
Could work s-something... >> are you all
right, friend? You seem to have transcended

291
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:16,123
are you all right, friend? You
seem to have transcended pale.

292
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,824
You seem to have transcended pale.
Well, I-I must admit I've

293

never dealt with the body before

00:12:19,894 --> 00:12:20,893
well, I-I must admit I've never
dealt with the body before he died.

295
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:23,161
Never dealt with the body before he died.
And this whole situation is

296
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:25,329
he died. And this whole situation
is making me... A bit uneasy.

297
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:26,263
And this whole situation is
making me... A bit uneasy.

298
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:28,131
Making me... A bit uneasy.
Well, what is life if it is not.

299
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:28,931
Well, what is life if it is not
uneasy?

300
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,699
Well, what is life if it is not uneasy?
So, what are the various fire

301
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:31,166
uneasy? So, what are the
various fire options?

302
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,967
So, what are the various fire options?
I'm sure you have standard

303
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,835
options? I'm sure you have standard
cremation, but we were thinking

304
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,436
I'm sure you have standard cremation, but we
were thinking something more along the lines

305
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,171
cremation, but we were thinking something more
along the lines of a funeral pyre in the town

306
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,005
something more along the lines of a
funeral pyre in the town square.

307
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,473
Of a funeral pyre in the town
square.

308
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:44,410
Square.
Unfortunately, our only options.

309
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:47,880
Unfortunately, our only options
are cremation and burial.

310
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:48,814
Unfortunately, our only options are cremation
and burial. >> Or a viking ceremony.

him about the viking ceremony.

313
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,316
Mills, tell him about the viking ceremony.
Oh, yes, the vikings used to

00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:53,884
ceremony. >> Oh, yes, the vikings
used to put the carcass on a boat and

it ablaze as it was cast out to sea.

317
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:57,220
Light it ablaze as it was cast out to sea.
That's exactly what I

I wanted... something dramatic!

319

That's exactly what I wanted... something
dramatic! >> We tend to specialize in the

My son does all the preparation.
Tell him to go easy on the

Tell him to go easy on the Rouge.
I tend to look a bit queally

queally with too much Rouge.

even remotely in the neighborhood
of things to be taken lightly.

Collect all the stamps you can.

It might have gone unnoticed by

I like to laugh at that duck.

I like to laugh at that duck.
Watch.

Okay. Good.

Ah, the sun, sir. It's at its height.
Isn't it always, mills?

485
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:58,360
It's at its height. >> Isn't it always,
mills? >> No, it's at its apogee,

Oh, I've already written it,

put that in your eulogy. >> Oh, I've already
written it, sir, and it wouldn't fit.

Then why mention it, mills?

496
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,471
It just won't fit. >> Then why mention
it, mills? Why confuse a dying man?

497

Then why mention it, mills? Why confuse

love might have the knowledge that I

508
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:54,672
it's just that my true love might have the
knowledge that I seek, and I don't even know if

509
00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:56,240
might have the knowledge that I seek, and
I don't even know if she got my letter.

510
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:58,675
Seek, and I don't even know if she got my
letter. It might be that love itself is

511
00:20:58,677 --> 00:20:59,776
she got my letter. It might be
that love itself is the answer.

512

It might be that love itself is the answer.
Love is generally brief.

513
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:03,245

Love is powerful.

"Your wife, sir, is my initial true love.
She is someone that I have"

true love. She is someone that I
have fascinated, masturbated, and

she is someone that I have fascinated,
masturbated, and concentrated on for most of my

you not allow us some time together?"

allow us some time together?" >> No.

No?

No. >> No? Well, my
whole life's been

no? Well, my whole
life's been awkward.

Well, my whole life's been awkward.
Why should it stop now?

Yes, it has been. >> When did you
get married? >> Oh, decades ago.

When did you get married? >>
Oh, decades ago. >> Any kids?

Well, then, you're poorly made!
Do you remember when your bosom

555
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,388
made! Do you remember when your
bosom would burn and I would rub a

556
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,856
do you remember when your bosom would burn
and I would rub a soothing salve upon it?

557
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,490
Would burn and I would rub a soothing
salve upon it? >> Ooh. That would sting.

558
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,425
Soothing salve upon it? >> Ooh. That would
sting. >> Yes, gently massaging it in,

it in, nursing your rickety skin back

Well, I did have rickets then.

And never have rickets been

And never have rickets been more erotic.
Ah. Here we are.

Three it is, maître d'.

Old man? Three it is, maître d'.
Three?

578

Three it is, maître d'.
Three? Huh.

579
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,477
Three? Huh. I believe
that would be a

580
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,644
huh. I believe that would
be a 20-minute wait, sir.

581
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:11,378
I believe that would be a
20-minute wait, sir. >> Really?

582
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,745
20-minute wait, sir.
Really? >> Yes.

583
00:23:11,747 --> 00:23:14,647
Really? >> Yes. >> Well,

yes. >> Well, maybe this $2
bill will change your tune.

585
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:17,415
Well, maybe this $2 bill will change your
tune. >> Ah. Well, I'll certainly see

586
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,549

Hello. It's Mr. binew. Uh, now a party
of three. Well, yes, he is our favorite

592
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:28,723
uh, now a party of three. Well, yes,
he is our favorite customer, so...

593
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:29,757
Well, yes, he is our favorite
customer, so... I don't care!

594
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,924
Customer, so... I don't care!
Move the mayor!

595
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:32,358
I don't care! Move the mayor!
Terribly sorry, sir.

596
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,859
Move the mayor! Terribly sorry, sir.
Your table is now ready.

597
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:36,341
Terribly sorry, sir. Your table
is now ready. >> Marla, please.

598
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:43,902
Thank you.

599
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:57,914
Ah. Except for a light snack
later, this will be my last meal.

600
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,349
Except for a light snack later, this will be
my last meal. Mmm. This goat is delectable.

601
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:00,916
This will be my last meal. Mmm.
This goat is delectable. >> Oh!

602
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:02,951
Mmm. This goat is delectable.
Oh!

603
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:04,052
Oh!
Mr. binew.

604
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:05,420
Mr. binew.
Thank you.

605
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:06,788
Mr. binew. >> Thank you.
Cheers, my love.

606
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,689
Thank you. >> Cheers, my love.
And for you, sir.

607
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,691
Cheers, my love. >> And for you, sir.
To us.

608
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:20,499
Did you know, old man, that if your beautiful
wife had not saved me those many moons ago

609
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,367
your beautiful wife had not saved me those
many moons ago that I would not be here today?

610
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,001
Saved me those many moons ago that I would not
be here today? For good or for ill, those are

611
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:25,802
that I would not be here today? For
good or for ill, those are the facts.

612
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:27,570
For good or for ill, those are the facts.
For, you see, tonight will not

613
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:29,104
the facts. For, you see, tonight will
not be the first time I will have

614
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:29,904
for, you see, tonight will not be
the first time I will have died.

615
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:32,806
Be the first time I will have died.
You're deader than me, you

616
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,707
died. >> You're deader than
me, you drunk sack of shit.

617
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:37,509
You're deader than me, you drunk sack
of shit. >> No, the first time was long

618
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:38,743
drunk sack of shit. >> No, the
first time was long ago, old man.

619
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:41,645
No, the first time was long ago, old man.
I was 9 years old, and she...

620
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,114
ago, old man. I was 9 years old, and she...
well, she was timeless.

621
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,815
I was 9 years old, and she... well, she was
timeless. I was riding my tricycle around

622
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,549
well, she was timeless. I was riding
my tricycle around our backyard.

623
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,616
I was riding my tricycle around our
backyard. We were very wealthy.

624
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:49,885
Our backyard. We were very wealthy.
We had a linoleum backyard.

625
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,087
We were very wealthy. We had a linoleum
backyard. In the excitement of a turn, I

626
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:53,488
we had a linoleum backyard. In the
excitement of a turn, I got confused.

627
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,922
In the excitement of a turn, I got
confused. The pool was still.

628
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:57,658
Got confused. The pool was still.
It looked like a continuation of

629
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,859
the pool was still. It looked like
a continuation of the linoleum.

630
00:24:58,861 --> 00:25:00,827
It looked like a continuation of the
linoleum. Mills, finish the story.

631
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:01,994
The linoleum. Mills, finish the story.
Yes, sir.

632
00:25:01,996 --> 00:25:03,495
Mills, finish the story.
Yes, sir.

633
00:25:03,497 --> 00:25:07,565
Yes, sir.
I plunged in headlong and

634
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:10,167
I plunged in headlong and
floated to the bottom...

635
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:11,868
I plunged in headlong and floated to the
bottom... In the deep end, old man...

636
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,804
floated to the bottom... In the deep
end, old man... the... the deep end.

637
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,639
In the deep end, old man... the... the
deep end. And I looked to the top, and...

638
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,208
the... the deep end. And I looked to
the top, and... and there was the sun.

639
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,943
And I looked to the top, and... and there was
the sun. I did not move, for I decided if

640
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:22,844
and there was the sun. I did not move, for I
decided if the sun could witness the death

641
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:24,278
I did not move, for I decided if the sun could
witness the death of a child and not intervene,

642
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,748
the sun could witness the death of a child
and not intervene, then what was the point?

643
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,982
Of a child and not intervene, then what was
the point? Old man, as you probably know,

644
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:30,616
then what was the point? Old man, as you
probably know, the sun stayed in the sky that

645
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:30,983
old man, as you probably know, the
sun stayed in the sky that day.

646
00:25:30,985 --> 00:25:32,217
The sun stayed in the sky that day.
It did not alter its perpetual

647
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:33,885
day. It did not alter
its perpetual course.

648
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:35,519
It did not alter its perpetual course.
And I died at the bottom of that

649
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:37,020
course. And I died at the
bottom of that pool.

650
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:38,888
And I died at the bottom of that pool.
For 14 minutes, I was clinically

651
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,856
pool. For 14 minutes, I was clinically
absent as your devoted wife

652
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,858
for 14 minutes, I was clinically absent
as your devoted wife tried to revive me.

653
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,059
Absent as your devoted wife tried to
revive me. >> At first I thought it was

654
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:45,560
tried to revive me. >> At first I thought
it was simply gratitude, Marla...

655
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:47,128
at first I thought it was simply gratitude,
Marla... gratitude for being saved.

656
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,263
Simply gratitude, Marla... gratitude for being
saved. But as time went on and the fire

657
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:50,998
gratitude for being saved. But as time went
on and the fire in my loins burned like a

658
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
but as time went on and the fire in my loins
burned like a thousand Roman candles, I knew

659
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:55,068
in my loins burned like a thousand Roman
candles, I knew that this feeling was something

660
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,271
thousand Roman candles, I knew that this
feeling was something greater, something pure.

661
00:25:58,273 --> 00:26:00,006
That this feeling was something greater,
something pure. It was love, Marla.

662
00:26:00,008 --> 00:26:01,207
Greater, something pure. It was
love, Marla. >> Oh, k. Roth...

663
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:03,576
It was love, Marla. >> Oh, k. Roth...
It was the only time in my

664
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:05,611
oh, k. Roth... >> It was the only time
in my life that I've ever been in

665
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:06,044
it was the only time in my life
that I've ever been in love.

666
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:08,312
Life that I've ever been in love.
Sure, I love mills, tacos, and

667
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:10,881
love. Sure, I love mills, tacos, and
some of the more popular actors,

668
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:13,316
sure, I love mills, tacos, and some of the more
popular actors, but my singular true love has

669
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:14,950
some of the more popular actors, but my
singular true love has always been you.

670
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:18,053
But my singular true love has always
been you. >> And you mine, k. Roth.

671
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:19,821
Always been you. >> And you mine, k. Roth.
It was only when she pressed

672
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:22,590
and you mine, k. Roth. >> It was only
when she pressed her lips to mine...

673
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,124
It was only when she pressed her lips
to mine... It was only when she... she

674
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,092
her lips to mine... It was only when she...
she shared her breath and there were

675
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:28,094
it was only when she... she shared her breath
and there were two mouths met that I was jarred

676
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:31,297
shared her breath and there were two mouths
met that I was jarred back into existence.

677
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,600
Two mouths met that I was jarred back into
existence. And it is that single breath and

678
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:36,902
back into existence. And it is that single
breath and it is that single kiss that has

679
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:38,904
and it is that single breath and it is that
single kiss that has kept me alive until today.

680
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:39,871
It is that single kiss that has
kept me alive until today.

681
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:43,040
Kept me alive until today.
Huh?

682
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:45,275
Huh?
Oh, Marla, you could make a

683
00:26:45,277 --> 00:26:46,976
huh? >> Oh, Marla, you could
make a man forget his quest.

684
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:49,278
Oh, Marla, you could make a man forget his
quest. Now, this might be the schnapps

685
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,680
man forget his quest. Now, this might be
the schnapps barking, but I think that the

686
00:26:51,682 --> 00:26:53,982
now, this might be the schnapps barking, but I
think that the answer rests on your soft lips,

687
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:58,186
barking, but I think that the answer rests on
your soft lips, and I long to know the answer.

688
00:26:58,188 --> 00:27:01,628
Answer rests on your soft lips, and I long
to know the answer. >> Oh, kiss me, k. Roth.

689
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:14,929
Well, it seemed to go well.
I don't know if she got

690
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:16,937
well, it seemed to go well. >> I don't know
if she got anything out of it, but my goal

691
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,872
I don't know if she got anything out
of it, but my goal is complete.

692
00:27:18,874 --> 00:27:20,607
Anything out of it, but my goal is
complete. Mills, I wonder if Hannibal felt

693
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:21,774
is complete. Mills, I wonder if
Hannibal felt this empty after taking

694
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:22,141
mills, I wonder if Hannibal felt
this empty after taking carthage.

695
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:23,942
This empty after taking carthage.
Although it was pleasant to

696
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:26,010
carthage. Although it was pleasant
to tongue-kiss my former nanny.

697
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:26,877
Although it was pleasant to tongue-kiss
my former nanny. Ah. Let's see.

698
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,011
Tongue-kiss my former nanny. Ah.
Let's see. Where to next?

699
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,679
Ah. Let's see. Where to next? Yes!
Mills, make haste to the

700
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,279
where to next? Yes! Mills,
make haste to the prostitute.

701
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,880
Yes! Mills, make haste to the prostitute.
My erection is strong, and I

702
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:33,915
prostitute. My erection is strong, and
I wish to celebrate my manhood two

703
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:36,117
my erection is strong, and I wish to celebrate
my manhood two or three final times.

704
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,986
Wish to celebrate my manhood two
or three final times.

705
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:45,192
Or three final times.

706
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:47,761
Oh, my darling.

707
00:27:47,763 --> 00:27:51,998
Oh, my darling.
You have done a dying man good.

708
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,035
Oh, my darling. You have done a dying
man good. Mills, get her an invitation.

709
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:57,369
You have done a dying man good. Mills, get her
an invitation. Now, don't forget to stop by

710
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:58,670
mills, get her an invitation. Now, don't
forget to stop by later for the wake.

711
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:02,940
Now, don't forget to stop by later
for the wake. It should be a riot.

712
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,641
Later for the wake. It should be a riot.
Hey, maybe in the next life, you

713
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,908
it should be a riot. Hey, maybe in the
next life, you and I could be husband and

714
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,209
hey, maybe in the next life, you and I could be
husband and wife... you know, take the money

715
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:09,311
and I could be husband and wife... you
know, take the money out of the equation.

716
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,246
Wife... you know, take the money out of
the equation. >> It's $50 extra for your

717
00:28:11,248 --> 00:28:13,014
out of the equation. >> It's
$50 extra for your friend.

718
00:28:13,016 --> 00:28:14,882
It's $50 extra for your friend.
What, mills?

719
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:16,650
Friend. >> What, mills? >>
It's $50 extra if somebody

720
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:17,050
what, mills? >> It's $50
extra if somebody watches.

721
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,251
It's $50 extra if somebody watches.
Okay.

722
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:19,986
Watches. >> Okay. I think
you've misunderstood the.

723
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:21,087
Okay. I think you've misunderstood
the situation, my love.

724
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:22,421
I think you've misunderstood the
situation, my love. Uh, this is mills.

725
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:24,423
Situation, my love. Uh, this is mills.
He is my man, my chauffeur, my

726
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:25,357
uh, this is mills. He is my man,
my chauffeur, my biographer.

727
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,659
He is my man, my chauffeur, my biographer.
He was not here to watch as much

728
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,427
biographer. He was not here to watch
as much as he was here to record what

729
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:30,227
he was not here to watch as much as
he was here to record what happened.

730
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:33,063
As he was here to record
what happened. See?

731
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:34,097
Happened. See? >> I
don't think you need

732
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:35,298
see? >> I don't think you
need another problem in here.

733
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,033
I don't think you need another problem in
here. >> Now you're escalating it to a

734
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,134
another problem in here. >> Now you're
escalating it to a hilltop it need not reach.

735
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:39,702
Now you're escalating it to a hilltop it

but prison life did not agree with Jack, and
so one night, he hanged himself with his new

1032
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,388
"with Jack, and so one night, he hanged himself
with his new friend, prison-issue sock."

1033
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:20,995
That was wonderful, sir. Wonderful.
I-I don't know.

1034
00:39:20,997 --> 00:39:22,963
Wonderful. >> I-I don't know.
You really have to pick your.

1035
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:23,530
I-I don't know. You really
have to pick your genre.

1036
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:25,298
You really have to pick your genre.
It... it starts out as a-an

1037
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,432
genre. It... it starts out as
a-an intriguing and playful

1038
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:27,733
it... it starts out as a-an intriguing
and playful children's story but then

1039
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:29,000
intriguing and playful children's story
but then quickly descends into a highly

1040
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:30,701
children's story but then quickly descends
into a highly critical exposé on our current

1041
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,469
quickly descends into a highly critical
exposé on our current penal system.

1042
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,470
Critical exposé on our current penal
system. It'll scare the children and

1043
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:33,937
penal system. It'll scare the
children and upset the adults.

1044
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,004
It'll scare the children and upset the
adults. As a member of the board that

1045
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:35,938
upset the adults. As a member of the
board that chooses the books for this

1046
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,060
as a member of the board that chooses the
books for this library, I disapprove.

1047
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:47,616
Well that is that.
It has been made brazenly clear.

1048
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,783
It has been made brazenly clear
I am a failure!

1049
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:50,785
It has been made brazenly clear I am a
failure! >> No, no, no, there is still

1050
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:51,685
I am a failure! >> No, no, no,
there is still hope, sir.

1051
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:53,553
No, no, no, there is still hope, sir.
One other person heard your

1052
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:53,986
hope, sir. One other
person heard your story.

1053
00:39:53,988 --> 00:39:55,954
One other person heard your story.
Miss, what did you think?

1054
00:39:55,956 --> 00:40:00,158
Story.
Miss, what did you think?

1055
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,592
Miss, what did you think?
Why did she beat me so?

1056
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:03,060
Why did she beat me so?
If you didn't bite her, I don't

1057
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:04,528
why did she beat me so? If you didn't bite
her, I don't think I would have gotten out of

1058
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,529
if you didn't bite her, I don't think I
would have gotten out of there alive.

1059
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,631
Think I would have gotten out of there
alive. >> She tasted quite good, sir.

1060
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,833
There alive. >> She tasted quite good, sir.
Oh, I have suffered two blows

1061
00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:11,701
she tasted quite good, sir. >> Oh, I have
suffered two blows today, one literary and one

1062
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:12,535
oh, I have suffered two blows today,
one literary and one physical.

1063
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,503
Today, one literary and one physical.
I don't know which one hurts

1064
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:15,103
physical. I don't know
which one hurts more.

1065
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:17,705
I don't know which one hurts more.
Ow. Ow!

1066
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,106
More. Ow. Ow! Oh, and
it's too much for me to

1067
00:40:19,108 --> 00:40:20,674
ow. Ow! Oh, and it's too much for
me to bear, going into the void

1068
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,142
oh, and it's too much for me to bear, going
into the void without the answer and unsure of

1069
00:40:22,144 --> 00:40:23,510
bear, going into the void without the
answer and unsure of my literary standing.

1070
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:25,111
Without the answer and unsure of my literary
standing. >> No, sir, dying can only help

1071
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:25,845
my literary standing. >> No, sir,
dying can only help your cause.

1072
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:27,446
No, sir, dying can only help your cause.
Think of... of kafka, van gogh,

1073
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:28,180
your cause. Think of... of kafka,
van gogh, Emily Dickinson.

1074
00:40:28,182 --> 00:40:29,881
Think of... of kafka, van gogh, Emily
Dickinson. >> Your reassurances are not

1075
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:30,414
Emily Dickinson. >> Your
reassurances are not enough.

1076
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:33,083
Your reassurances are not enough.
I must know before I die.

1077
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:24,999
What do they say? What could the future
possibly hold for this poor, old sod?

1078
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:27,234
What could the future possibly hold for this
poor, old sod? Who, if any, will remember him?

1079
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:29,769
Hold for this poor, old sod? Who, if any, will
remember him? Will he, before the sun sets,

1080
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:31,904
who, if any, will remember him? Will he, before
the sun sets, secure the answer that has

1081
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,940
will he, before the sun sets, secure
the answer that has eluded him so?

1082
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:37,809
Secure the answer that has eluded him so?
You will experience a great

1083
00:41:37,811 --> 00:41:39,710
eluded him so? >> You will
experience a great loss soon.

1084
00:41:39,712 --> 00:41:40,877
You will experience a great loss soon.
My body.

1085
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:43,579
Loss soon. >> My body. >>
Fear not, for this will pass.

1086
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:46,014
My body. >> Fear not, for this will pass.
I always thought it would be

1087
00:41:46,016 --> 00:41:48,483
fear not, for this will pass. >> I always
thought it would be more of a permanent thing.

1088
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:51,018
I always thought it would be more of a permanent
thing. >> When this time of darkness is

1089
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,854
more of a permanent thing. >> When this time
of darkness is through, your soul will soar to

1090
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:55,922
when this time of darkness is through, your
soul will soar to new heights, as if a great

1091
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:57,957
through, your soul will soar to new heights,
as if a great weight has been lifted.

1092
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:00,793
New heights, as if a great weight has been
lifted. And it was that weight that has

1093
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:02,995
weight has been lifted. And it was
that weight that has stifled you so.

1094
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:05,864
And it was that weight that has stifled
you so. >> With my body no longer, I

1095
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:08,666
stifled you so. >> With my body no
longer, I will be judged by word alone.

1096
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:10,501
With my body no longer, I will be judged by
word alone. Mills, my place in history is

1097
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:10,934
will be judged by word alone. Mills,
my place in history is secure.

1098
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:11,834
Mills, my place in history is secure.
Hush!

1099
00:42:11,836 --> 00:42:13,769
Secure. >> Hush! >> I'm
sorry, but your speak is

1100
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:15,670
hush! >> I'm sorry, but your speak
is so cryptic, I must interpret it

1101
00:42:15,672 --> 00:42:16,070
I'm sorry, but your speak is so
cryptic, I must interpret it aloud.

1102
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:19,873
So cryptic, I must interpret it aloud.
Please, go on.

1103
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:21,541
Aloud. Please, go on. >>
You will be remembered by

1104
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:24,944
please, go on. >> You will be remembered
by many for your kindness, your

1105
00:42:24,946 --> 00:42:28,614
you will be remembered by many for your
kindness, your loyalty, and your patience.

1106
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:29,982
Many for your kindness, your loyalty, and your
patience. >> That doesn't sound like you,

00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:30,883
loyalty, and your patience. >>
That doesn't sound like you, sir.

1108
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:31,783
That doesn't sound like you, sir.
Not at all.

1109
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:34,085
Sir. >> Not at all. >>
For your work with the

for your work with the elderly,
you will be generously rewarded.

Elderly, you will be generously rewarded.
The elderly, sir?

Rewarded. >> The elderly, sir?
I will not listen to this

1114
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:41,990
the elderly, sir? >> I will
not listen to this drivel!

1115
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,558
I will not listen to this drivel!
Tell me now, psychic!

1116
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,226
Drivel! Tell me now, psychic!
What is the brief but powerful

1117
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:45,993
tell me now, psychic! What is the
brief but powerful monologue?

1118
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:49,296
What is the brief but powerful monologue?
I am doing<i> his</i> cards!

1119
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:50,230
Monologue? >> I am doing<i> his</i> cards!
Really?

1120
00:42:50,232 --> 00:42:50,964
I am doing<i> his</i> cards!
Really? >> Yes.

1121
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:52,966
Really? >> Yes. As a
matter of fact, you're

1122
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:55,068
yes. As a matter of fact, you're
going to do quite well for

as a matter of fact, you're going
to do quite well for yourself.

1124
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:57,670
Going to do quite well for yourself.
What about<i> my</i> cards?

1125
00:42:57,672 --> 00:43:00,939
Yourself. >> What about<i> my</i> cards?
<i>Your</i> cards?

1126
00:43:00,941 --> 00:43:03,007
What about<i> my</i> cards? >><i> Your</i> cards?
Are you sure you want me to

00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:04,041
<i>your</i> cards? Are you sure you
want me to read<i> your</i> cards?

1128
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:06,009
Are you sure you want me to read<i> your

1129
00:43:06,011 --> 00:43:08,077
read<i> your</i> cards? >> Why do you
think I've come here, psychic?

1130
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,180
Why do you think I've come here, psychic?
Fine, then.

Here, psychic? >> Fine, then.
You're next.

1132
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:24,593
Flip that card again.

1133
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:35,201
That organ means I'm doomed,
huh?

1134
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:39,004
That organ means I'm doomed, huh?
The<i> card</i> means you're doomed.

1135

Huh? >> The<i> card</i> means you're doomed.
The organ's for effect.

1136

The<i> card</i> means you're doomed. The
organ's for effect. >> That was a bust.

The organ's for effect. >> That was a bust.
12 bucks, and she tells me what

that was a bust. 12 bucks, and she
tells me what I already know.

1139
00:43:46,144 --> 00:43:47,610
12 bucks, and she tells me what I
already know. I have been hosed, mills.

I already know. I have been hosed, mills.
No, not really, sir.

I have been hosed, mills. >> No, not
really, sir. You also get the story of the

no, not really, sir. You also
get the story of the thing.

1143
00:43:50,747 --> 00:43:52,146
You also get the story of the thing.
Why do you think I paid $100 for

1144
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,714
thing. Why do you think I paid $100
for a watch that always breaks?

1145
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:55,015
Why do you think I paid $100 for a watch that
always breaks? >> I really don't know, mills.

1146
00:43:55,017 --> 00:43:56,750
A watch that always breaks? >> I really don't
know, mills. >> Because it was being sold to

1147
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:58,051
I really don't know, mills. >> Because it
was being sold to me by a legless man named

because it was being sold to me by
a legless man named grimelhausen.

1149
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:00,119
Me by a legless man named grimelhausen.
What are you talking about?!

1150
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:01,053
Grimelhausen. >> What are you talking
about?! Ridiculosity will not be

1151
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:01,820
what are you talking about?!
Ridiculosity will not be tolerated.

1152
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:02,954
Ridiculosity will not be tolerated.
No, I paid $5 for the watch

1153
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:04,355
tolerated. >> No, I paid $5 for the
watch and $95 for the story of buying

1154
00:44:04,357 --> 00:44:05,823
no, I paid $5 for the watch and $95 for the
story of buying the watch from a legless man

1155
00:44:05,825 --> 00:44:06,723
and $95 for the story of buying the watch
from a legless man named grimelhausen.

1156
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:08,024
The watch from a legless man named
grimelhausen. >> That's an awful lot to pay

1157
00:44:08,026 --> 00:44:09,091
named grimelhausen. >> That's an awful
lot to pay for an idiotic story.

1158
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:09,958
That's an awful lot to pay for an
idiotic story. >> Oh, not really, sir.

1159
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,059
For an idiotic story. >> Oh, not
really, sir. It kills at parties.

1160
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:12,794
Oh, not really, sir. It kills at parties.
Not going so well at this

1161
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:12,994
it kills at parties. >> Not
going so well at this one.

1162
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:13,961
Not going so well at this one.
Are you sure?

1163
00:44:13,963 --> 00:44:15,128
One. >> Are you sure?
You'll be dead soon.

1164
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,996
Are you sure? You'll be dead soon.
Biographer, kill yourself in

you'll be dead soon. >> Biographer, kill
yourself in childhood, the victim of a

biographer, kill yourself in childhood, the
victim of a mining accident, at least until

1167
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:21,599
childhood, the victim of a mining accident,
at least until you apologize for that joke.

1168
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,033
Mining accident, at least until you apologize
for that joke. When you do, have yourself

1169
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,200
you apologize for that joke. When you do,
have yourself killed two years later by

when you do, have yourself killed
two years later by sharks.

1171
00:44:28,806 --> 00:44:31,940
Killed two years later by sharks.
Did you just say that your watch

00:44:31,942 --> 00:44:33,841
sharks. Did you just say that
your watch always breaks?

1173

Did you just say that your watch
always breaks? >> Constantly.

1174
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:39,713
Always breaks? >> Constantly.
Is it broken now?

1175
00:44:39,715 --> 00:44:41,835
Constantly. >> Is it broken now?
Why, yes, it is.

1176
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:51,190
A snail is more swift, mills! Faster!
Faster! >> I'm trying, sir.

1177
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:53,025
Faster! Faster!
I'm trying, sir.

1178
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:56,061
I'm trying, sir.
Come on, man!

1179
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:58,063
Come on, man!
But this is no small setback,

1180
00:44:58,065 --> 00:44:58,630
come on, man! But this is
no small setback, mills.

1181
00:44:58,632 --> 00:44:59,964
But this is no small setback, mills.
How am I supposed to get

1182
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:03,100
mills. How am I supposed
to get everything done?

1183
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:06,203
How am I supposed to get everything done?
This has no hands.

1184
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:10,874
Everything done? This has no hands.
And this has no gears.

1185
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:11,841
This has no hands. And this has no gears.
Oh, mills...

1186
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:12,408
And this has no gears. Oh, mills...
What?

1187
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,209
Oh, mills...
What?

1188
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,645
What?
It is 9:30. I...

1189
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:19,079
It is 9:30. I...
I've been dead two hours.

1190
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:20,246
It is 9:30. I... I've been dead two hours.
No, no, no, no, sir.

1191
00:45:20,248 --> 00:45:21,013
I've been dead two hours. >> No,
no, no, no, sir. It is 1:30.

1192
00:45:21,015 --> 00:45:23,982
No, no, no, no, sir. It is 1:30.
We're hours ahead of schedule.

1193
00:45:23,984 --> 00:45:26,017
It is 1:30. We're hours ahead of schedule.
They're all different!

1194
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:28,953
We're hours ahead of schedule. >> They're
all different! Which one is right?!

1195
00:45:28,955 --> 00:45:30,254
They're all different! Which one is right?!
Perhaps we should trust this

1196
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:31,021
which one is right?! >> Perhaps
we should trust this one, sir.

1197
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:31,688
Perhaps we should trust this one, sir.
It is gold.

1198
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,890
One, sir. It is gold. >> But
that is madness, mills!

1199
00:45:33,892 --> 00:45:36,092
It is gold. >> But that is madness, mills!
You, man... what time is it?

1200
00:45:36,094 --> 00:45:38,327
But that is madness, mills! You, man... what
time is it? >> You have to buy a watch to

1201
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:39,795
you, man... what time is it? >> You
have to buy a watch to get the time.

1202
00:45:39,797 --> 00:45:40,328
You have to buy a watch to get the time.
I refuse.

1203
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,962
Get the time. >> I refuse. If
I'm forced to live within the

1204
00:45:41,964 --> 00:45:43,730
I refuse. If I'm forced to live within
the confines of time, the least you

1205
00:45:43,732 --> 00:45:45,798
if I'm forced to live within the confines of time,
the least you could do is give me the hour and

1206
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,833
confines of time, the least you could do is give
me the hour and minute we are in free of charge!

1207
00:45:47,835 --> 00:45:51,903
Could do is give me the hour and minute we are in
free of charge! >> Time is my business, and time

1208
00:45:51,905 --> 00:45:54,171
minute we are in free of charge! >> Time is my
business, and time being my business, I must charge

1209
00:45:54,173 --> 00:45:55,105
time is my business, and time being
my business, I must charge for time.

1210
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:57,207
Being my business, I must charge for time.
Oh, you are an impudent

1211
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:58,141
for time. >> Oh, you are
an impudent clockmaker.

1212
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,143
Oh, you are an impudent clockmaker.
But I concede to your idiocy.

1213
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:01,744
Clockmaker. But I concede to your idiocy.
Mills, pay the man.

1214
00:46:01,746 --> 00:46:03,278
But I concede to your idiocy. Mills,
pay the man. What watch will that buy?

1215
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,079
Mills, pay the man. What watch will
that buy? >> That's not enough for a

1216
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:06,146
what watch will that buy? >> That's
not enough for a proper watch.

1217
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:08,314
That's not enough for a proper watch.
But for that price, I will sell

1218
00:46:08,316 --> 00:46:09,114
proper watch. But for that
price, I will sell you the time.

1219
00:46:09,116 --> 00:46:10,782
But for that price, I will sell you
the time. >> Well, let's complete the

1220
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:11,783
you the time. >> Well, let's
complete the transaction, man.

1221
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:13,217
Well, let's complete the transaction, man.
With the amount you gave me,

1222
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:14,918
transaction, man. >> With the amount you
gave me, I can only give you the time

1223
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,151
with the amount you gave me, I
can only give you the time once.

1224
00:46:15,153 --> 00:46:16,952
I can only give you the time once.
For the love of all that is

1225
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:19,854
once. >> For the love of all that
is sacred, give me the watch!

1226
00:46:19,856 --> 00:46:20,988
For the love of all that is sacred,
give me the watch! Oh, mills...

1227
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:21,922
Sacred, give me the watch!
Oh, mills... >> What?

1228
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:24,257
Oh, mills... >> What?
It is 3:30.

1229
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:26,959
What? >> It is 3:30.
Four hours left.

1230
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:29,027
It is 3:30. Four hours left.
I-I hoped I had more time.

1231
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:31,062
Four hours left. I-I hoped I had more time.
Here I am, so far from the.

1232
00:46:31,064 --> 00:46:32,063
I-I hoped I had more time. Here
I am, so far from the answer.

1233
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:33,798
Here I am, so far from the answer.
Give me the watch!

1234
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,900
Answer. >> Give me the watch!
So much time, but so little

1235
00:46:35,902 --> 00:46:36,767
give me the watch! >> So much
time, but so little time.

1236
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:37,701
So much time, but so little time.
Sir...

1237
00:46:37,703 --> 00:46:40,704
time. >> Sir... >> the
irony is too thick to

sir... >> the irony is
too thick to ignore.

1239
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:41,971
The irony is too thick to ignore.
Stop that, sir!

1240
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:42,838
Ignore. >> Stop that, sir!
Your list!

1241
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,139
Stop that, sir! Your list! >>
There's no point in having a

1242
00:46:44,141 --> 00:46:45,707
your list! >> There's no point in
having a list if there is no time to

there's no point in having a list
if there is no time to complete it.

1244
00:46:46,843 --> 00:46:48,943
List if there is no time to complete it.
It is a wonder that people get

1245
00:46:48,945 --> 00:46:50,911
complete it. It is a wonder that
people get anything done at all.

1246
00:46:50,913 --> 00:46:52,913
It is a wonder that people get anything
done at all. Besides, I-I'm feeling a bit

1247
00:46:52,915 --> 00:46:54,281
anything done at all. Besides, I-I'm
feeling a bit woozy and would like some...

1248
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:55,915
Besides, I-I'm feeling a bit woozy and would
like some... >> What's the matter with your

00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:56,215
woozy and would like some... >>
What's the matter with your friend?

1250
00:46:56,217 --> 00:46:58,337
What's the matter with your friend?
...More time!

1251
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:10,793
Father, I have fallen slightly behind.
Please, please, I have not done

1252
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:12,060
behind. Please, please, I have
not done much cardio lately.

1253
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:12,827
Please, please, I have not done
much cardio lately. I am weak.

1254
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,762
Much cardio lately. I am weak. I
cannot keep up with your brisk

1255

I am weak. I cannot keep
up with your brisk pace.

1256
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:21,235
I cannot keep up with your brisk pace.
Father...

1257
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:22,369
Pace. Father... Whoa.

1258
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:23,169
Father... Whoa. Demon.

1259
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,437
Whoa. Demon. Must be
the road to Hades.

1260
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,939
Demon. Must be the road to Hades.
Oh. Oh, the bullies from my

1261
00:47:27,941 --> 00:47:29,206
must be the road to Hades. Oh. Oh,
the bullies from my life, together.

1262
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:31,107
Oh. Oh, the bullies from my life, together.
This must be the end.

1263
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:33,576
Life, together. This must be the end.
All of the women I've had sex

1264
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:35,411
this must be the end. All of
the women I've had sex with.

All of the women I've had sex with.
Mother, what are you doing here?

With. Mother, what are you doing here?
And Roy?!

Mother, what are you doing here? And Roy?!
It's a good thing there's a

1268
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:43,284
and Roy?! It's a good thing
there's a recap at the end.

1269
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:46,854
It's a good thing there's a recap at the
end. I barely remember any of this.

1270
00:47:46,856 --> 00:47:48,121
Recap at the end.
I barely remember any of this.

1271
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:49,355
I barely remember any of this.
Oh! Thank God, mills.

Oh! Thank God, mills.
Mills, I desperately need a

I desperately need a ride.

1274

Mills, I desperately need a ride.
Mills, just up to the finish

All those sinners repent. All ye who seek

So bright... much brighter than before.
That's it.

Much brighter than before.
That's it. I'm... Dead?

That's it. I'm... Dead?
Well, that wasn't so bad.

I'm... Dead? Well, that

How did you die?

Yes? >> How did you die?
I didn't.

alive! >> Do you really
think it's God's fault?

1321
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,376
Do you really think it's God's fault?
He is infinitely charitable.

1322
00:49:39,378 --> 00:49:40,343
God's fault? >> He is infinitely
charitable. >> To everyone?

1323
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:42,011
He is infinitely charitable. >> To
everyone? >> God embraces us all as his

1324
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:42,678
to everyone? >> God embraces
us all as his children.

1325
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,413
God embraces us all as his children.
Oh, yes, but some would say

1326
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:46,047
children. >> Oh, yes, but some would
say that I've been a bad man.

1327
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,581
Oh, yes, but some would say that I've been
a bad man. >> You only need to accept God

1328
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,182
that I've been a bad man. >> You only need
to accept God into your heart, and he will

1329
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:51,184
you only need to accept God into your heart,
and he will forgive you of whatever mistakes

1330
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:52,118
into your heart, and he will forgive you of
whatever mistakes you have made in this life.

1331
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,186
Forgive you of whatever mistakes you have
made in this life. >> Come on. All of them?

1332
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:55,353
You have made in this life. >> Come on.
All of them? >> All of them.

1333
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:58,055
Come on. All of them? >> All of them.
Well, he seems very powerful.

1334
00:49:58,057 --> 00:50:00,090
All of them. >> Well, he seems very
powerful. What are the rules again?

1335
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:01,724
Well, he seems very powerful. What are
the rules again? Love thy brother!

1336
00:50:01,726 --> 00:50:04,193
What are the rules again? Love thy brother!
But I hate my brother, and he.

1337
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:05,060
Love thy brother! >> But I hate
my brother, and he hates me.

1338
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:07,062
But I hate my brother, and he hates me.
Forgive him, as God does.

1339
00:50:07,064 --> 00:50:07,996
Hates me. >> Forgive him, as God does.
Go now.

1340
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:10,131
Forgive him, as God does. >> Go now.
Stand before your brother, for

1341
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,199
go now. Stand before your brother,
for with God's love, all quarrels

1342
00:50:12,201 --> 00:50:13,300
stand before your brother, for with God's
love, all quarrels may be resolved.

1343
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,422
With God's love, all quarrels
may be resolved. >> Hmm.

1344
00:50:35,656 --> 00:50:40,325
My father was a fool, mills, for raising
me on the religion of the ancient greeks.

1345
00:50:40,327 --> 00:50:42,160
Raising me on the religion of the ancient
greeks. I feel terrible about that goat.

1346
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:43,995
The ancient greeks. I feel terrible about
that goat. What did you name that goat,

1347
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:44,328
I feel terrible about that goat.
What did you name that goat, mills?

1348
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,662
What did you name that goat, mills?
Zazimo, sir.

1349
00:50:45,664 --> 00:50:48,164
Mills? >> Zazimo, sir. >> I
feel terrible about zazimo.

1350
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,599
Zazimo, sir. >> I feel terrible about
zazimo. But God forgives, and God knows

1351
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:53,201
I feel terrible about zazimo. But God
forgives, and God knows I have a job to do.

1352
00:50:53,203 --> 00:50:55,369
But God forgives, and God knows I have a
job to do. Jesus Christ, this is a long

1353
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:56,370
I have a job to do. Jesus Christ,
this is a long driveway.

1354
00:50:56,372 --> 00:50:57,604
Jesus Christ, this is a long driveway.
God damn it!

1355
00:50:57,606 --> 00:50:59,238
Driveway. God damn it!
Just broke a rule.

1356
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,239
God damn it! Just broke a rule.
Aw, shit!

1357
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:02,481
Just broke a rule. Aw, shit!
Mills, go ahead and flog me.

1358
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:09,747
So, you see, they have this
book called "the Bible."

1359
00:51:09,749 --> 00:51:11,315
So, you see, they have this book called
"the Bible." It tells the story of a man

1360
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:12,716
book called "the Bible." It tells the
story of a man named Jesus... a Mexican

1361
00:51:12,718 --> 00:51:14,184
it tells the story of a man named Jesus...
a Mexican gentleman, I presume.

1362
00:51:14,186 --> 00:51:15,718
Named Jesus... a Mexican gentleman, I
presume. I haven't read it yet, but they

1363
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,186
gentleman, I presume. I haven't read it
yet, but they say it's very popular.

1364
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:18,287
I haven't read it yet, but they say it's
very popular. >> Don't be a jackass.

1365
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:20,088
Say it's very popular. >> Don't be a
jackass. Mother raised us both in the

1366
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:20,488
don't be a jackass. Mother
raised us both in the church.

1367
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,589
Mother raised us both in the church.
You were baptized.

1368
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:23,257
Church. You were baptized. >>
Are you talking about that

1369
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:25,092
you were baptized. >> Are you talking
about that robed man that tried to drown

1370
00:51:25,094 --> 00:51:27,461
are you talking about that robed
man that tried to drown me?

1371
00:51:27,463 --> 00:51:30,130
Robed man that tried to drown me?
What a fond repressed memory.

1372
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:32,198
Me? What a fond repressed memory.
Anyhow, these christians... they

1373
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,799
what a fond repressed memory. Anyhow, these
christians... they thought it would be a good idea

1374
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:35,500
anyhow, these christians... they thought it would
be a good idea if I came by and made amends.

1375
00:51:35,502 --> 00:51:37,268
Thought it would be a good idea if I came by and
made amends. I also wanted to tell you that

1376
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:41,038
if I came by and made amends. I also wanted to
tell you that I'll be dying in three hours.

1377
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,139
I also wanted to tell you that I'll be
dying in three hours. >> Did you come here

1378
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,607
I'll be dying in three hours. >> Did you
come here specifically to upset mother?

1379
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:44,474
Did you come here specifically
to upset mother? >> Karl...

1380
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,242
specifically to upset mother? >> Karl...
don't "Karl" me, Klaus.

1381
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:47,643
Karl... >> don't "Karl" me, Klaus.
Don't "Klaus" me.

1382
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:48,677
Don't "Karl" me, Klaus. >> Don't
"Klaus" me. It's "k. Roth."

1383
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,445
Don't "Klaus" me. It's "k. Roth."
It has been so nice not

1384
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:51,646
it's "k. Roth." >> It has been
so nice not having you here.

1385
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:53,614
It has been so nice not having you here.
We haven't missed you at all.

1386
00:51:53,616 --> 00:51:55,449
Having you here. We haven't missed you
at all. >> No more animosity, Karl.

1387
00:51:55,451 --> 00:51:57,217
We haven't missed you at all. >> No more
animosity, Karl. It's all bourbon under the

1388
00:51:57,219 --> 00:51:59,686
no more animosity, Karl. It's all bourbon
under the bridge as far as I'm concerned.

1389
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:01,154
It's all bourbon under the bridge as
far as I'm concerned. Hug me, Karl.

1390
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:03,389
Bridge as far as I'm concerned. Hug me,
Karl. I won't be around much longer.

1391
00:52:03,391 --> 00:52:05,791
Hug me, Karl. I won't be around much
longer. >> You smell like shit.

1392
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:07,192
I won't be around much longer. >> You smell
like shit. Is that blood on your neck?

1393
00:52:07,194 --> 00:52:08,092
You smell like shit. Is that
blood on your neck? >> Ah, yes.

1394
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:09,126
Is that blood on your neck? >> Ah, yes.
I was beaten earlier.

1395
00:52:09,128 --> 00:52:10,127
Ah, yes. I was beaten earlier.
I passed out twice.

1396
00:52:10,129 --> 00:52:11,561
I was beaten earlier. I passed out twice.
Mills flogged me in the

1397
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:12,161
I passed out twice. Mills
flogged me in the driveway.

1398
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:13,695
Mills flogged me in the driveway.
The blood could be from any of

1399
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,195
driveway. The blood could
be from any of those.

1400
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,764
The blood could be from any of those.
But that is of no consequence.

1401
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,266
Those. But that is of no consequence.
I simply wanted to come by to

1402
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:20,600
but that is of no consequence. I simply
wanted to come by to say farewell.

1403
00:52:20,602 --> 00:52:22,802
I simply wanted to come by to say farewell.
I'm sorry that we didn't get

1404
00:52:22,804 --> 00:52:24,336
say farewell. I'm sorry that
we didn't get along better.

1405
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:25,503
I'm sorry that we didn't get along better.
You're not dying.

1406
00:52:25,505 --> 00:52:27,204
Along better. >> You're not dying.
It's another one of your goddamn

1407
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:27,804
you're not dying. It's another
one of your goddamn schemes.

1408
00:52:27,806 --> 00:52:29,405
It's another one of your goddamn schemes.
I am, Karl, and I wanted to

1409
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:31,140
schemes. >> I am, Karl, and I wanted
to invite you and mother to the

1410
00:52:31,142 --> 00:52:31,406
I am, Karl, and I wanted to invite
you and mother to the wake.

1411
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:33,274
Invite you and mother to the wake.
Mills?

1412
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,209
Wake. Mills? >>
You're just like your

1413
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:36,143
mills? >> You're just
like your father...

1414
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:37,344
You're just like your father...
Thank you.

1415
00:52:37,346 --> 00:52:39,112
Father... >> Thank you.
...But crazier.

1416
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:39,846
Thank you. >>...But crazier.
Mother...

1417
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:42,248
but crazier. >> Mother... >>
you have embarrassed this

1418
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:42,848
mother... >> you have
embarrassed this family.

1419
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:45,383
You have embarrassed this family.
You are the town drunk and the

1420
00:52:45,385 --> 00:52:46,650
family. You are the town
drunk and the village idiot.

1421
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:48,818
You are the town drunk and the village
idiot. You ride around with your mute

1422
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,487
village idiot. You ride around with your
mute friend on that rickshaw, and you

1423
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:52,821
you ride around with your mute friend on that
rickshaw, and you live in a men's hotel.

1424
00:52:52,823 --> 00:52:54,622
Friend on that rickshaw, and you live in a
men's hotel. When you were younger, I thought

1425
00:52:54,624 --> 00:52:56,223
live in a men's hotel. When you were younger,
I thought there was a possibility that

1426
00:52:56,225 --> 00:52:57,757
when you were younger, I thought there was
a possibility that you'd be all right.

1427
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:00,192
There was a possibility that you'd be all
right. But what kind of life have you

1428
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:02,127
you'd be all right. But what kind
of life have you made for yourself?

1429
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:05,330
But what kind of life have you made for
yourself? I have worried too long about

1430
00:53:05,332 --> 00:53:08,833
made for yourself? I have worried too long
about you, Klaus, and I am tired now.

1431
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:12,603
I have worried too long about you, Klaus,
and I am tired now. I'm very tired.

1432
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:15,405
You, Klaus, and I am tired now. I'm
very tired. >> We're both very tired.

1433
00:53:15,407 --> 00:53:17,106
I'm very tired. >> We're both very tired.
Just thought I would try to

1434
00:53:17,108 --> 00:53:18,373
we're both very tired. >> Just thought I
would try to connect with you before I die.

1435
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:19,440
Just thought I would try to connect with
you before I die. >> Stop saying that!

1436
00:53:19,442 --> 00:53:21,108
Connect with you before I die. >> Stop
saying that! >> You're not dying, just like

1437
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,442
stop saying that! >> You're not dying,
just like you're not an artist and you're

1438
00:53:22,444 --> 00:53:23,209
you're not dying, just like you're not
an artist and you're not a writer.

1439
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:24,843
You're not an artist and you're not
a writer. This is all in your head.

1440
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:26,878
Not a writer. This is all in your head.
Well, there's no point in

1441
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,280
this is all in your head. >> Well, there's
no point in trying to connect with you two.

1442
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:31,415
Well, there's no point in trying to connect
with you two. You've had it out for me since

1443
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,316
trying to connect with you two. You've had it
out for me since the beginning, and I can't

1444
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:34,550
you've had it out for me since the
beginning, and I can't figure out why.

1445
00:53:34,552 --> 00:53:36,385
The beginning, and I can't figure out why.
If only father were here.

1446
00:53:36,387 --> 00:53:37,719
Figure out why. If only father were here.
He understood me.

1447
00:53:37,721 --> 00:53:39,353
If only father were here. He understood me.
You drove him away!

1448
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:41,488
He understood me. >> You drove him away!
Why do you think he left you on

1449
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,655
you drove him away! Why do you think
he left you on your birthday?

1450
00:53:42,657 --> 00:53:44,757
Why do you think he left you on your
birthday? He couldn't stand another year

1451
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:45,457
your birthday? He couldn't
stand another year of you.

1452
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:47,692
He couldn't stand another year of you.
You have five seconds to take

1453
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:49,794
of you. >> You have five seconds to
take that back before I walk out of

1454
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:52,917
you have five seconds to take that back
before I walk out of here in silence.

1455
00:53:58,136 --> 00:54:06,136
I see. Mills? >> You're
not dying, you know.

1456
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:14,316
Mills? >> You're not dying, you know.
You're not dying!

1457
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:16,151
You're not dying, you know. You're not
dying! It's... it's all right, mother.

1458
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:17,552
You're not dying! It's... it's all right,
mother. He just needs to go away for a

1459
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:17,852
it's... it's all right, mother. He
just needs to go away for a while.

1460
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:18,853
He just needs to go away for a while.
I'll... I'll call

1461

Schoenberg.

1462
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:22,823
I'll... I'll call Dr. schoenberg.
I shouldn't have listened to.

1463
00:54:22,825 --> 00:54:24,292
Dr. schoenberg. >> I shouldn't have
listened to those christians, mills.

1464
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:24,959
I shouldn't have listened to those
christians, mills. My family is horrible.

1465
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:26,560
Those christians, mills. My family is
horrible. >> Well, it was nice that you

1466
00:54:26,562 --> 00:54:26,993
my family is horrible. >> Well,
it was nice that you tried, sir.

1467
00:54:26,995 --> 00:54:29,295
Well, it was nice that you tried, sir.
What is "nice"?!

1468
00:54:29,297 --> 00:54:31,997
Tried, sir. >> What is "nice"?!
I don't know, sir.

1469
00:54:31,999 --> 00:54:33,698
What is "nice"?! >> I don't know, sir.
I have searched for the

1470
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,665
I don't know, sir. >> I have
searched for the answer in love.

1471
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:35,732
I have searched for the answer in love.
It was not there.

1472
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,500
Answer in love. It was not there.
I know it wasn't present when I

1473
00:54:37,502 --> 00:54:39,001
it was not there. I know it wasn't present
when I searched for it in family, nor

1474
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:40,902
I know it wasn't present when I searched for it
in family, nor did I find it in the arms of a

1475
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:41,602
searched for it in family, nor did
I find it in the arms of a woman.

1476
00:54:41,604 --> 00:54:43,937
Did I find it in the arms of a woman.
So, I ask you, have I wasted my

1477
00:54:43,939 --> 00:54:46,272
woman. So, I ask you, have I wasted
my final day searching in vain?

1478
00:54:46,274 --> 00:54:48,307
So, I ask you, have I wasted my final
day searching in vain? Mills, time?

1479
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:49,641
Final day searching in vain?
Mills, time? >> 5:00, sir.

1480
00:54:49,643 --> 00:54:51,509
Mills, time? >> 5:00, sir. >> Oh.
You got your watch fixed.

1481
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:53,043
5:00, sir. >> Oh. You got your watch fixed.
Yes, while you were passed

1482
00:54:53,045 --> 00:54:53,710
oh. You got your watch fixed. >>
Yes, while you were passed out.

1483
00:54:53,712 --> 00:54:55,478
Yes, while you were passed out.
How did I get out of there

1484
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,278
out. >> How did I get
out of there anyhow?

1485
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,412
How did I get out of there anyhow?
I carried you.

1486
00:54:57,414 --> 00:54:58,780
Anyhow? >> I carried you.
Like a fireman?

1487
00:54:58,782 --> 00:54:59,280
I carried you. >> Like a fireman?
Yes.

1488
00:54:59,282 --> 00:55:00,614
Like a fireman? >> Yes. >>
Oh, I would have liked to

1489
00:55:00,616 --> 00:55:01,414
yes. >> Oh, I would have
liked to have seen that.

1490
00:55:01,416 --> 00:55:03,916
Oh, I would have liked to have seen that.
Yes, it was something else.

1491
00:55:03,918 --> 00:55:06,018
Have seen that. >> Yes, it was
something else. Well, sir, where next?

1492
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,054
Yes, it was something else. Well, sir,
where next? >> All hope is lost, mills.

1493
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,817
Well, sir, where next? >> All hope
is lost, mills. To the shifty Mick.

1494
00:55:24,303 --> 00:55:30,774
How many hours in bars, doing what?
Walking around with a cup,

1495
00:55:30,776 --> 00:55:33,943
what? Walking around with a cup,
posing in various stances with a

1496
00:55:33,945 --> 00:55:35,978
walking around with a cup, posing
in various stances with a cup...

1497
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,946
Posing in various stances with a cup...
Refilling the cup and moving to

1498
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:39,380
cup... Refilling the cup and moving
to another part of the room,

1499
00:55:39,382 --> 00:55:41,081
refilling the cup and moving to another part
of the room, perhaps the corner, so you can

1500
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,849
another part of the room, perhaps the corner,
so you can see the whole roomful of people

1501
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:44,050
perhaps the corner, so you can see the
whole roomful of people with their cups.

1502
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:46,786
See the whole roomful of people with their
cups. "They sure are out tonight," you

1503
00:55:46,788 --> 00:55:48,921
with their cups. "They sure are out
tonight," you say to the man that pours.

1504
00:55:48,923 --> 00:55:51,390
"They sure are out tonight," you say to the man
that pours. "That they are, that they are,"

1505
00:55:51,392 --> 00:55:53,892
say to the man that pours. "That they are, that
they are," he says, too busy for more small

1506
00:55:53,894 --> 00:55:54,592
"that they are, that they are," he
says, too busy for more small talk.

1507
00:55:54,594 --> 00:55:56,994
He says, too busy for more small talk.
Cups to fill.

1508
00:55:56,996 --> 00:56:00,998
Talk. Cups to fill.
Cups to fill.

1509
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,833
Cups to fill. Cups to fill.
Well, that's depressing.

1510
00:56:02,835 --> 00:56:04,868
Cups to fill. >> Well, that's depressing.
Usually you're more jovial.

1511
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:05,935
Well, that's depressing. >> Usually you're
more jovial. >> I'm dying unfulfilled, boys.

1512
00:56:05,937 --> 00:56:07,770
Usually you're more jovial. >> I'm
dying unfulfilled, boys. Humor me.

1513
00:56:07,772 --> 00:56:09,671
I'm dying unfulfilled, boys. Humor me.
Perhaps it's not how you

1514
00:56:09,673 --> 00:56:11,039
humor me. >> Perhaps it's not
how you lived but how you die.

1515
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,007
Perhaps it's not how you lived but how
you die. >> If you die happy, you stay

1516
00:56:13,009 --> 00:56:13,841
lived but how you die. >> If
you die happy, you stay happy.

1517
00:56:13,843 --> 00:56:15,642
If you die happy, you stay happy.
If you die in sadness, you

1518
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:16,943
happy. If you die in sadness,
you remain in sadness.

1519
00:56:16,945 --> 00:56:18,978
If you die in sadness, you remain in
sadness. >> How are you dying, k. Roth?

1520
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,713
Remain in sadness. >> How are you dying, k.
Roth? >> Quite well, thank you.

How are you dying, k. Roth? >> Quite well,
thank you. >> How are you<i> really</i> dying?

Quite well, thank you. >> How are you

How are you<i> really</i> dying?
How am I dying? >> Yes.

How am I dying? >> Yes.
How am I dying?!

1525
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:27,117
Yes. >> How am I dying?! >>
That's what we're asking.

1526
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,885
How am I dying?! >> That's what we're
asking. >> I am dying as you were

1527
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:30,019
that's what we're asking. >> I am dying
as you were born... prematurely.

1528
00:56:30,021 --> 00:56:31,687
I am dying as you were born... prematurely.
I am dying as the owner

1529
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,622
born... prematurely. I am dying as the
owner decorated this bar... foolishly.

1530
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,123
I am dying as the owner decorated this bar...
foolishly. Finally, I am dying like my

I am dying like my disease... nameless.

00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,528
Finally, I am dying like my disease...
nameless. >> What about k. Roth binew as a

disease... nameless. >> What about k.
Roth binew as a name?

1534
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:43,496
What about k. Roth binew as a name?
It already<i> is</i> my name.

1535
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:45,064
Name? >> It already<i> is</i> my name.
Sounds like a disease if you

1536
00:56:45,066 --> 00:56:46,432
it already<i> is</i> my name. >> Sounds like
a disease if you say it fast enough.

1537

Sounds like a disease if you say
it fast enough. <i>Krothbinew.</i>

Say it fast enough. <i>Krothbinew.

Awfully contagious. >> Contagious?!
Oh, my God!

Just think, you'll never have to wait out

Wait out here again. >> It's quite

It's quite all right, sir. It's getting

Would like some time alone. >>
You don't have much, sir. Hurry.

You don't have much, sir.
Hurry. >> Don't worry.

Hurry. >> Don't worry. One

Perhaps k. Roth's greatest.

Perhaps k. Roth's greatest
regret was that he never

perhaps k. Roth's greatest regret was that
he never produced the one work he adapted

regret was that he never produced the one work
he adapted for the stage, the story of an

01:03:59,772 --> 01:04:01,271
produced the one work he adapted for the stage,
the story of an antebellum Southern woman and

Southern woman and all of her trials and

antebellum Southern woman and all
of her trials and tribulations.

All of her trials and tribulations.
Ladies and gentlemen, for the

01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,010
tribulations. Ladies and gentlemen, for
the first time ever, k. Roth binew's

One-woman show,
"remembrance of dawn."

1656
01:04:23,024 --> 01:04:26,359
I do remember my youth, beauregard.
I do.

1657
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:28,194
Remember my youth, beauregard. I do.
Well, I don't remember it like

1658
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:29,128
I do. Well, I don't remember
it like most, with joy.

1659
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:32,431
Well, I don't remember it like most, with
joy. No, I remember it with sadness.

1660
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:34,199
Most, with joy. No, I remember it
with sadness. So much hope that was

1661
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:35,166
no, I remember it with sadness.
So much hope that was squandered.

1662
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:37,234
So much hope that was squandered.
So many things that were left

1663
01:04:37,236 --> 01:04:40,003
squandered. So many things
that were left undone.

1664
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:42,206
So many things that were left undone.
Oh, how I remember.

1665
01:04:42,207 --> 01:04:45,274
Undone. Oh, how I remember.
Oh, how I remember...

1666
01:04:45,276 --> 01:04:47,075
Oh, how I remember. Oh, how
I remember... Swimming.

1667
01:04:47,077 --> 01:04:49,177
Oh, how I remember... Swimming.
We would go down to the quarry.

1668
01:04:49,179 --> 01:04:50,645
Swimming. We would go down to the quarry.
There was always such good

1669
01:04:50,647 --> 01:04:52,113
we would go down to the quarry. There was
always such good swimming in the quarry.

1670
01:04:52,115 --> 01:04:54,081
There was always such good swimming in
the quarry. Mother and father and sister

1671
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:54,915
swimming in the quarry. Mother and
father and sister were there.

1672
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:56,483
Mother and father and sister were there.
And father would wear one of

1673
01:04:56,485 --> 01:04:58,284
were there. And father would wear one
of those full-body bathing suits

1674
01:04:58,286 --> 01:05:00,152
and father would wear one of those full-body
bathing suits that went out in the '20s.

1675
01:05:00,154 --> 01:05:01,953
Those full-body bathing suits that went out
in the '20s. Oh, he would look like such a

1676
01:05:01,955 --> 01:05:03,387
that went out in the '20s. Oh, he would
look like such a fool in that bathing suit.

1677
01:05:03,389 --> 01:05:05,355
Oh, he would look like such a fool in that
bathing suit. But it was all right, for he had

1678
01:05:05,357 --> 01:05:07,523
fool in that bathing suit. But it was
all right, for he had nice thighs.

1679
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:09,491
But it was all right, for he had nice
thighs. And sometimes... well, sometimes

1680
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:11,226
nice thighs. And sometimes... well,
sometimes Billy would be at the quarry.

1681
01:05:11,228 --> 01:05:12,927
And sometimes... well, sometimes Billy would
be at the quarry. Billy always smelled like

1682
01:05:12,929 --> 01:05:13,494
Billy would be at the quarry. Billy
always smelled like apple pie.

1683
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:15,095
Billy always smelled like apple pie.
We weren't quite sure why.

1684
01:05:15,097 --> 01:05:16,629
Apple pie. We weren't quite sure why.
We thought it was maybe a

1685
01:05:16,631 --> 01:05:18,030
we weren't quite sure why. We thought
it was maybe a glandular disorder.

1686
01:05:18,032 --> 01:05:19,931
We thought it was maybe a glandular
disorder. But it was all right, because he

1687
01:05:19,933 --> 01:05:22,667
glandular disorder. But it was all right,
because he was sweet on me, and sister was

1688
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:23,934
but it was all right, because he was
sweet on me, and sister was jealous!

1689
01:05:23,936 --> 01:05:25,402
Was sweet on me, and sister was
jealous!

1690
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:27,570
Jealous!
And we would walk home through a.

1691
01:05:27,572 --> 01:05:29,638
And we would walk home through a
green field with the smells of

1692
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,673
and we would walk home through a green field with
the smells of summer everywhere, the cicadas

1693
01:05:31,675 --> 01:05:33,574
green field with the smells of summer everywhere,
the cicadas singing their lovely summer

1694
01:05:33,576 --> 01:05:34,207
summer everywhere, the cicadas
singing their lovely summer opera.

1695
01:05:34,209 --> 01:05:39,278
Singing their lovely summer
opera.

1696
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,547
Opera.
It was all so fresh, so full of.

1697
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:49,020
It was all so fresh, so full of
hope, so untainted.

1698
01:05:49,022 --> 01:05:50,955
It was all so fresh, so full of hope, so
untainted. And then I met you, beauregard,

1699
01:05:50,957 --> 01:05:52,489
hope, so untainted. And then I met you,
beauregard, and all that was pure became

1700
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:54,157
and then I met you, beauregard, and all that
was pure became polluted, and all that was

1701
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,225
and all that was pure became polluted, and
all that was innocent became jaded, and all

1702
01:05:56,227 --> 01:05:57,459
polluted, and all that was innocent became
jaded, and all those summers turned to

1703
01:05:57,461 --> 01:05:59,427
innocent became jaded, and all those summers
turned to winters... cold, hateful, bitter

1704
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:02,129
those summers turned to winters... cold,
hateful, bitter winters with no spring in sight!

1705
01:06:02,131 --> 01:06:05,065
Winters... cold, hateful, bitter winters with
no spring in sight! You have taken my youth,

1706
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:08,268
winters with no spring in sight! You have
taken my youth, beauregard, which I got over.

1707
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:11,437
You have taken my youth, beauregard, which
I got over. But I will not let you take my

1708
01:06:11,439 --> 01:06:14,273
beauregard, which I got over. But I will not
let you take my three beautiful children!

1709
01:06:14,275 --> 01:06:16,375
But I will not let you take my
three beautiful children! Oh!

1710
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:18,443
Three beautiful children! Oh!
He needs an ambulance!

1711
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:20,311
Oh! >> He needs an ambulance!
He's dead!

1712
01:06:20,313 --> 01:06:23,180
He needs an ambulance! >> He's dead!
No! No!

1713
01:06:23,182 --> 01:06:24,281
He's dead! >> No! No! >> Oh, no.

No! No! >> Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no!

1715
01:06:25,951 --> 01:06:27,684
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no!
No,<i> dawn</i> was falling.

1716
01:06:27,686 --> 01:06:28,951
Oh, no, no, no! No,<i> dawn</i> was falling.
Dawn fell.

1717
01:06:28,953 --> 01:06:30,385
No,<i> dawn</i> was falling. Dawn fell.
She used my body.

1718
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:31,986
Dawn fell. She used my body.
I'm all right.

1719
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,187
She used my body. I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1720
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,122
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Ladies and gentlemen, my two

1721
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:37,090
I'm all right. Ladies and gentlemen, my
two friends from the bar whose names

01:06:37,092 --> 01:06:38,257
ladies and gentlemen, my two friends from
the bar whose names completely escape me.

Friends from the bar whose names completely

So exciting to be at the
beginning of a thing.

1737
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:13,385
So exciting to be at the beginning of a
thing. A different kind of excitement

1738
01:07:13,387 --> 01:07:16,054
beginning of a thing. A different kind of
excitement than the end... more hope, less

1739
01:07:16,056 --> 01:07:16,621
a different kind of excitement than
the end... more hope, less dread.

1740

Than the end... more hope, less dread.
So exciting to be at the

dread. So exciting to be at
the beginning of a thing.

So exciting to be at the beginning of a
thing. >> And none of it as exciting as

01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:27,129
beginning of a thing. >> And none of
it as exciting as what comes next.

1744
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:40,609
You went away, and you stayed away.
And now you're here, and what do

And now you're here, and what do you want?
You wouldn't understand.

1747
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,479
You want? >> You wouldn't understand.
It's too much to take in.

1748
01:07:45,481 --> 01:07:47,614
You wouldn't understand. It's too much to
take in. >> Oh, I understand perfectly.

1749
01:07:47,616 --> 01:07:49,716
It's too much to take in. >> Oh, I understand
perfectly. You left me alone in the world

1750
01:07:49,718 --> 01:07:51,718
oh, I understand perfectly. You left me alone
in the world with a family that hates me.

1751
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,053
You left me alone in the world with a family
that hates me. You ruined fathers and men for

1752
01:07:54,055 --> 01:07:54,319
with a family that hates me. You
ruined fathers and men for me.

1753
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:56,321
You ruined fathers and men for me.
And now, on my deathbed, you

1754
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,156
me. And now, on my deathbed,
you wish to make amends.

1755
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,458
And now, on my deathbed, you wish to
make amends. Well, let me say this, you

1756
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,393
wish to make amends. Well, let me
say this, you small, selfish man...

1757
01:08:02,395 --> 01:08:04,294
well, let me say this, you small,
selfish man... >> k. Roth, please.

1758
01:08:04,296 --> 01:08:06,562
Small, selfish man... >> k. Roth, please.
Let me say this, you small,

1759
01:08:06,564 --> 01:08:07,763
k. Roth, please. >> Let me say
this, you small, selfish man!

1760
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:09,731
Let me say this, you small, selfish man!
You are not my father.

1761
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:11,466
Selfish man! You are not my father.
You are... An anti-father.

1762
01:08:11,468 --> 01:08:13,468
You are not my father. You are... An
anti-father. You are everything a father is

1763
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:14,168
you are... An anti-father. You
are everything a father is not.

1764
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,435
You are everything a father is not.
You lack father-ness.

1765
01:08:15,437 --> 01:08:17,570
Not. You lack father-ness. >>
I knew you would respond like

1766
01:08:17,572 --> 01:08:18,137
you lack father-ness. >> I knew
you would respond like this.

1767
01:08:18,139 --> 01:08:20,272
I knew you would respond like this.
You can take your brief but

1768
01:08:20,274 --> 01:08:22,107
this. >> You can take your brief but
powerful monologue and choke on

1769
01:08:22,109 --> 01:08:22,540
you can take your brief but
powerful monologue and choke on it.

1770
01:08:22,542 --> 01:08:24,508
Powerful monologue and choke on it.
I wouldn't have enough time to

1771
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,575
it. I wouldn't have enough
time to use it anyhow.

1772
01:08:25,577 --> 01:08:27,410
I wouldn't have enough time to use it
anyhow. So if you'll just be on your

1773
01:08:27,412 --> 01:08:29,378
use it anyhow. So if you'll just be on
your way, the ending won't make any

1774
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:34,282
so if you'll just be on your way, the ending
won't make any sense if you missed the middle.

1775
01:08:34,284 --> 01:08:36,250
Way, the ending won't make any sense
if you missed the middle. >> Klaus...

1776
01:08:36,252 --> 01:08:39,686
Sense if you missed the middle. >> Klaus...
Please, step off the stage and

1777
01:08:39,688 --> 01:08:41,754
Klaus... Please, step off the stage
and come back here to talk to me.

1778
01:08:41,756 --> 01:08:43,455
Please, step off the stage and come back here
to talk to me. >> I don't have time for your

1779
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:45,290
come back here to talk to me. >> I don't have
time for your torturous babble right now,

1780
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:46,291
I don't have time for your torturous
babble right now, Dr. schoenberg.

1781
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:47,358
Torturous babble right now, Dr. schoenberg.
Very tight schedule.

1782
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,293
Dr. schoenberg. Very tight schedule.
Klaus, you are having an

1783
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:51,528
very tight schedule. >> Klaus, you are
having an episode, just like your previous

1784
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,362
Klaus, you are having an episode,
just like your previous episodes.

1785
01:08:52,364 --> 01:08:54,464
Episode, just like your previous episodes.
Please, Klaus, go with your

1786
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:55,431
episodes. >> Please, Klaus,
go with your doctor now.

1787
01:08:55,433 --> 01:08:57,399
Please, Klaus, go with your doctor now.
You just need some rest.

1788
01:08:57,401 --> 01:08:59,200
Doctor now. You just need some rest.
He's not my doctor.

1789
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:01,335
You just need some rest. >> He's
not my doctor. <i>That's</i> my doctor.

1790
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:04,571
He's not my doctor. <i>That's</i> my doctor.
K. Roth binew is dying of a

1791
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:07,740
<i>that's</i> my doctor. >> K. Roth binew is
dying of a yet-to-be-named, grave, vague

k. Roth binew is dying of a
yet-to-be-named, grave, vague disease.

1793
01:09:09,176 --> 01:09:11,776
Yet-to-be-named, grave, vague disease.
Thank you, doctor.

1794
01:09:11,778 --> 01:09:13,110
Disease. >> Thank you, doctor.
10 minutes.

1795
01:09:13,112 --> 01:09:16,346
Thank you, doctor. >> 10 minutes.
Time waits for no man.

1796
01:09:16,348 --> 01:09:18,114
10 minutes. >> Time waits for no man.
I'm sure that some of you had a

1797
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:19,782
time waits for no man. I'm sure that some
of you had a problem with the way I walked

1798
01:09:19,784 --> 01:09:21,383
I'm sure that some of you had a problem with
the way I walked through the world, so at the

1799
01:09:21,385 --> 01:09:23,151
problem with the way I walked through the world,
so at the end, there will be a two-minute

1800
01:09:23,153 --> 01:09:24,752
through the world, so at the end, there will
be a two-minute rebuttal, though I'm sure it

1801
01:09:24,754 --> 01:09:26,587
end, there will be a two-minute rebuttal, though
I'm sure it will be vicious, so let's cut it

1802
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:27,554
rebuttal, though I'm sure it will be
vicious, so let's cut it out altogether.

1803
01:09:27,556 --> 01:09:28,655
Will be vicious, so let's cut it
out altogether. >> God damn it!

1804
01:09:28,657 --> 01:09:30,623
Out altogether. >> God damn it!
Old man, you can talk about.

1805
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,625
God damn it! >> Old man, you can talk
about me all you want after I'm gone.

1806
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,259
Old man, you can talk about me all you want
after I'm gone. In fact, I encourage it.

1807
01:09:34,261 --> 01:09:36,227
Me all you want after I'm gone. In fact, I
encourage it. Collect yourselves in small

1808
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:38,295
in fact, I encourage it. Collect yourselves
in small groups every Thursday evening to

1809
01:09:38,297 --> 01:09:39,462
collect yourselves in small groups every
Thursday evening to discuss me and my ideas.

1810
01:09:39,464 --> 01:09:41,230
Groups every Thursday evening to discuss me and
my ideas. But don't forget to recruit from

1811
01:09:41,232 --> 01:09:42,564
discuss me and my ideas. But don't forget
to recruit from the local high schools.

1812
01:09:42,566 --> 01:09:44,132
But don't forget to recruit from the local
high schools. Perhaps my world view will be

1813
01:09:44,134 --> 01:09:45,733
the local high schools. Perhaps my world
view will be more in tune with the younger

1814
01:09:45,735 --> 01:09:47,768
perhaps my world view will be more
in tune with the younger generation.

1815
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:51,138
More in tune with the younger generation.
Oh, registered on the scale of

1816
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:54,708
generation. Oh, registered on the scale
of humanity, to register not as one

1817
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,710
oh, registered on the scale of humanity, to
register not as one of billions who passively

1818
01:09:56,712 --> 01:09:58,645
humanity, to register not as one of billions
who passively consumed but as one who

1819
01:09:58,647 --> 01:10:00,747
of billions who passively consumed but
as one who produces, one who produced

1820
01:10:00,749 --> 01:10:03,182
consumed but as one who produces, one who
produced something people can turn to for

1821
01:10:03,184 --> 01:10:06,618
produces, one who produced something people can
turn to for the wisdom of the ages, just to

1822
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,121
something people can turn to for the wisdom of the
ages, just to see a hand from the future reach

1823
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,190
the wisdom of the ages, just to see a hand from
the future reach for my book on a shelf...

1824
01:10:13,192 --> 01:10:16,493
See a hand from the future reach for my book
on a shelf... Simple, unrealized fantasies are

1825
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:21,231
for my book on a shelf... Simple, unrealized
fantasies are now too overwhelming to ponder.

1826
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:22,332
Simple, unrealized fantasies are now too
overwhelming to ponder. >> Nine minutes.

1827
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:24,267
Now too overwhelming to ponder. >> Nine
minutes. >> I should warn you, dear

1828
01:10:24,269 --> 01:10:26,502
nine minutes. >> I should warn you,
dear friends, that somewhere in this

1829
01:10:26,504 --> 01:10:28,670
I should warn you, dear friends, that somewhere
in this audience tonight, lurking, is

1830
01:10:28,672 --> 01:10:30,438
friends, that somewhere in this audience
tonight, lurking, is my enemy, the bane of my

1831
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,606
audience tonight, lurking, is my enemy, the
bane of my soon-to-be-over existence, and

1832
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:34,407
my enemy, the bane of my soon-to-be-over
existence, and he is not to be trusted.

1833
01:10:34,409 --> 01:10:36,208
Soon-to-be-over existence, and he is not
to be trusted. I know you're out there,

1834
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:37,275
he is not to be trusted. I know
you're out there, Reginald!

1835

I know you're out there, Reginald!
I'm right here, binew!

1836
01:10:39,145 --> 01:10:39,643
Reginald! >> I'm right here, binew!
Good.

1837
01:10:39,645 --> 01:10:41,578
I'm right here, binew! >> Good. I
would like to tell you how our

1838
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,545
good. I would like to tell
you how our rivalry ends.

1839
01:10:42,547 --> 01:10:44,446
I would like to tell you how our rivalry
ends. I'm sure you think you have won

1840
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:45,713
rivalry ends. I'm sure you think
you have won because I am dying.

1841
01:10:45,715 --> 01:10:46,847
I'm sure you think you have won
because I am dying. >> A little bit.

1842
01:10:46,849 --> 01:10:48,582
Because I am dying. >> A little bit.
Well, you are wrong, dear

1843
01:10:48,584 --> 01:10:49,382
a little bit. >> Well, you
are wrong, dear friend.

1844
01:10:49,384 --> 01:10:51,584
Well, you are wrong, dear friend.
<i>I</i> have won, because when you

1845
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:53,852
friend. <i>I</i> have won, because when
you return home tonight, you will.

1846
01:10:53,854 --> 01:10:56,254
<i>I</i> have won, because when you return home tonight,
you will find that I have shit in all of

1847
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:57,288
return home tonight, you will find
that I have shit in all of your pants.

1848
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,222
Find that I have shit in all
of your pants. >> What?!

1849
01:10:58,224 --> 01:10:59,423
- Your pants.
- >> What?!

1850
01:10:59,425 --> 01:11:01,158
- What?!
- >> I have shit in all of your.

1851
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:01,458
I have shit in all of your
pants.

1852
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,792
I have shit in all of your pants.
Even the gaberdines?!

1853
01:11:02,794 --> 01:11:03,793
Pants. >> Even the gaberdines?!
Yes, Reginald.

1854
01:11:03,795 --> 01:11:05,394
Even the gaberdines?! >> Yes, Reginald.
And that feeling you have when

1855
01:11:05,396 --> 01:11:07,195
yes, Reginald. And that feeling you
have when you realize that I am not

1856
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:09,397
and that feeling you have when you realize
that I am not joking... why, that is exactly

1857
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:11,432
you realize that I am not joking... why, that
is exactly how awful it has been to live

1858
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,667
joking... why, that is exactly how awful it has
been to live near you on the planet earth for

1859
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:15,235
how awful it has been to live near you on
the planet earth for these past few years.

1860
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,403
Near you on the planet earth for these past
few years. So, Reginald, it seems that our

1861
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:20,940
these past few years. So, Reginald, it
seems that our case is well rested.

1862
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:24,910
So, Reginald, it seems that our
case is well rested.

1863
01:11:24,912 --> 01:11:26,044
Case is well rested.
Because he has decided to.

1864
01:11:26,046 --> 01:11:27,912
Because he has decided to
maintain his unwelcome presence,

1865
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:29,580
because he has decided to maintain his unwelcome
presence, I see no reason why I should not

1866
01:11:29,582 --> 01:11:30,414
maintain his unwelcome presence, I see no
reason why I should not introduce him.

1867
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,048
I see no reason why I should not introduce
him. He is, after all, responsible

1868
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:33,883
introduce him. He is, after all,
responsible for most of my personality

1869
01:11:33,885 --> 01:11:34,650
he is, after all, responsible for
most of my personality problems.

1870
01:11:34,652 --> 01:11:36,618
For most of my personality problems.
Ladies and gentlemen, the father

01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,852
problems. Ladies and gentlemen,
the father that abandoned me,

That abandoned me, lampert binew.
I did not abandon you.

1874
01:11:43,558 --> 01:11:45,324
Lampert binew. >> I did not abandon you.
Maybe they changed the

1875
01:11:45,326 --> 01:11:46,591
I did not abandon you. >> Maybe they
changed the definition of "abandon."

1876
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:48,292
Maybe they changed the definition of
"abandon." Uh, perhaps "forsake" or

1877
01:11:48,294 --> 01:11:49,993
definition of "abandon." Uh,
perhaps "forsake" or "desert."

1878
01:11:49,995 --> 01:11:50,727
Uh, perhaps "forsake" or
"desert." >> Eight minutes.

1879
01:11:50,729 --> 01:11:51,894
"Desert." >> Eight minutes.
Father, come back in eight

1880
01:11:51,896 --> 01:11:53,863
eight minutes. >> Father,
come back in eight minutes.

1881

Father, come back in eight minutes.
I'm busy right now.

01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,432
Minutes. I'm busy right now.
Before I forget, if anybody

1883
01:11:57,434 --> 01:11:58,966
I'm busy right now. Before I forget,
if anybody wants two blankets, half a

before I forget, if anybody wants two blankets,
half a bottle of gin, a typewriter, and

wants two blankets, half a bottle of gin, a
typewriter, and a hot plate, they'll be in room

they'll be in room number 8 at my boarding house.

1887
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:05,737
A hot plate, they'll be in room number
8 at my boarding house. Be careful.

1888
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,306
Number 8 at my boarding house. Be careful.
The typewriter is cursed.

1889
01:12:08,308 --> 01:12:10,574
Be careful. The typewriter is cursed.
It only types out trash...

1890
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,542
the typewriter is cursed. It only types
out trash... unpublishable trash.

1891
01:12:12,544 --> 01:12:14,310
It only types out trash... unpublishable
trash. You can get the key off of my

1892
01:12:14,312 --> 01:12:15,711
unpublishable trash. You can get the key
off of my body after the wake, left-hand

1893
01:12:15,713 --> 01:12:16,611
you can get the key off of my body
after the wake, left-hand pocket.

1894
01:12:16,613 --> 01:12:19,046
Body after the wake, left-hand pocket.
There is also a crisp $50 bill

1895
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:21,481
pocket. There is also a crisp $50
bill taped to my testicles for

1896
01:12:21,483 --> 01:12:23,015
there is also a crisp $50 bill taped to
my testicles for whoever is interested.

1897
01:12:23,017 --> 01:12:25,017
Taped to my testicles for whoever is
interested. It is well taped, so I imagine

1898
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:26,785
whoever is interested. It is well taped,
so I imagine it will require some work.

1899
01:12:26,787 --> 01:12:30,421
It is well taped, so I imagine it will
require some work. Not for the squeamish.

1900
01:12:30,423 --> 01:12:32,856
It will require some work. Not for the
squeamish. Mills, what are you doing?

1901
01:12:32,858 --> 01:12:34,490
Not for the squeamish. Mills, what
are you doing? This is<i> my</i> show.

1902
01:12:34,492 --> 01:12:36,058
Mills, what are you doing? This is<i> my</i> show.
I've written something for

1903
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:36,491
this is<i> my</i> show. >> I've
written something for you.

1904
01:12:36,493 --> 01:12:38,392
I've written something for you.
Well, I'm not finished, and I

1905
01:12:38,394 --> 01:12:39,393
you. >> Well, I'm not finished,
and I don't have much time.

1906
01:12:39,395 --> 01:12:41,061
Well, I'm not finished, and I don't have
much time. Don't you think you could do it

1907
01:12:41,063 --> 01:12:41,928
don't have much time. Don't you think
you could do it when I'm gone?

1908
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:42,428
Don't you think you could
do it when I'm gone? >> No.

1909
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,062
When I'm gone? >> No.
It will only

1910
01:12:44,064 --> 01:12:46,731
no. It will only take
a moment, please.

1911
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:49,374
It will only take a moment, please.
All right.

1912
01:13:00,712 --> 01:13:08,712
"K. Roth binew, my king, my light,
your day the last has come."

1913
01:13:12,857 --> 01:13:15,891
Light, your day the last has come.
And as your breath doth seek its

1914
01:13:15,893 --> 01:13:21,897
come. And as your breath doth seek
its death upon the setting sun, I

1915
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:27,636
and as your breath doth seek its death upon the
setting sun, I cast my sights to fancy flights,

1916
01:13:27,638 --> 01:13:31,740
death upon the setting sun, I cast my sights
to fancy flights, when you and I were young.

1917
01:13:31,742 --> 01:13:34,642
Cast my sights to fancy flights, when you and
I were young. K. Roth binew, my king, my

1918
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:38,979
when you and I were young. K. Roth binew,
my king, my light, we will not meet again.

1919
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:50,650
"K. Roth binew, so falls the night...
When falls my only friend."

1920
01:14:03,102 --> 01:14:05,103
Thank you, mills.

1921
01:14:14,446 --> 01:14:22,446
I see now why the wake is traditionally
held after death. Much quieter.

1922
01:14:24,022 --> 01:14:28,024
Traditionally held after death.
Much quieter. Less painful.

1923
01:14:28,026 --> 01:14:29,725
Much quieter. Less painful.
You can fabricate the

1924
01:14:29,727 --> 01:14:31,560
less painful. You can fabricate
the disposition of the dead.

1925
01:14:31,562 --> 01:14:33,728
You can fabricate the disposition of
the dead. You cannot hear them howling

1926
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,996
disposition of the dead. You cannot hear
them howling their last breath in defiance.

1927
01:14:35,998 --> 01:14:38,164
You cannot hear them howling their
last breath in defiance. Howl!

1928
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:39,832
Their last breath in defiance.
Howl! Like that.

1929
01:14:39,834 --> 01:14:42,568
Howl! Like that. Howl!

1930
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:44,670
Like that. Howl! That
is my interpretation of

1931
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:47,172
howl! That is my
interpretation of defiance.

1932
01:14:47,174 --> 01:14:51,009
That is my interpretation of defiance.
I died that day at the zoo.

1933
01:14:51,011 --> 01:14:53,177
Defiance. >> I died that day at the zoo.
Really, father, this constant

1934
01:14:53,179 --> 01:14:55,179
I died that day at the zoo. >> Really, father,
this constant interruption is inexcusable.

1935
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:57,181
Really, father, this constant interruption is
inexcusable. >> I'd gotten you a small panda.

1936
01:14:57,183 --> 01:14:59,149
Interruption is inexcusable. >> I'd gotten you
a small panda. A stuffed animal, of course.

1937
01:14:59,151 --> 01:15:01,451
I'd gotten you a small panda. A stuffed animal,
of course. While leaving the zoo, someone

1938
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:03,486
a stuffed animal, of course. While leaving the
zoo, someone bumped me, and the panda fell

1939
01:15:03,488 --> 01:15:04,653
while leaving the zoo, someone bumped
me, and the panda fell into a cage.

1940
01:15:04,655 --> 01:15:06,621
Bumped me, and the panda fell into a cage.
I was in a hurry, so without

1941
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,789
into a cage. I was in a hurry, so
without thinking, I climbed the fence.

1942
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:10,991
I was in a hurry, so without thinking, I climbed
the fence. As I bent down to get the panda,

1943
01:15:10,993 --> 01:15:13,093
thinking, I climbed the fence. As I bent down to
get the panda, I realized I was surrounded by

1944
01:15:13,095 --> 01:15:15,061
as I bent down to get the panda, I
realized I was surrounded by badgers.

1945
01:15:15,063 --> 01:15:17,596
I realized I was surrounded by badgers.
"Why a cage full of badgers?"

1946
01:15:17,598 --> 01:15:18,730
Badgers. "Why a cage full
of badgers?" I thought.

1947
01:15:18,732 --> 01:15:21,499
"Why a cage full of badgers?" I thought.
"Who wants to look at a badger?"

1948
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:23,801
I thought. "Who wants to look at a
badger?" First they tore through my

1949
01:15:23,803 --> 01:15:26,470
"who wants to look at a badger?" First they
tore through my clothes, then my skin, then the

1950
01:15:26,472 --> 01:15:29,072
first they tore through my clothes, then
my skin, then the sinew, then the bone.

1951
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:31,107
Clothes, then my skin, then the sinew,
then the bone. I was completely devoured.

1952
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:33,242
Sinew, then the bone. I was completely
devoured. The only evidence remaining was

1953
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:36,979
I was completely devoured. The only evidence
remaining was the toy panda... And the 10

1954
01:15:36,981 --> 01:15:40,983
the only evidence remaining was the toy
panda... And the 10 badgers with bloody teeth.

1955
01:15:40,985 --> 01:15:45,053
The toy panda... And the 10 badgers with
bloody teeth. >> So, you would have come back?

1956
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:47,622
Badgers with bloody teeth. >> So,
you would have come back? >> Yes.

1957
01:15:47,624 --> 01:15:49,790
So, you would have come back? >> Yes.
And you would have told me

1958
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:51,091
yes. >> And you would have
told me what it all meant?

1959
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:53,660
And you would have told me what it all
meant? >> K. Roth, life is not like one

1960
01:15:53,662 --> 01:15:55,194
what it all meant? >> K. Roth, life is
not like one of your word problems.

1961
01:15:55,196 --> 01:15:59,097
K. Roth, life is not like one of your word
problems. There's no equation for life.

1962
01:15:59,099 --> 01:16:03,034
Of your word problems. There's no equation
for life. >> I guess life would be a very

1963
01:16:03,036 --> 01:16:05,536
there's no equation for life. >> I guess
life would be a very long word problem.

1964
01:16:05,538 --> 01:16:07,638
I guess life would be a very long word
problem. But you implied that there was a

1965
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,006
long word problem. But you implied
that there was a definitive answer.

1966
01:16:09,008 --> 01:16:10,874
But you implied that there was a definitive
answer. >> There's no answer, just a

1967
01:16:10,876 --> 01:16:12,942
definitive answer. >> There's no answer,
just a decision... a decision you made

1968
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,043
there's no answer, just a decision... a
decision you made long ago, k. Roth.

1969
01:16:14,045 --> 01:16:15,711
Decision... a decision you made long
ago, k. Roth. >> And what was that?

1970
01:16:15,713 --> 01:16:17,279
Long ago, k. Roth. >> And what was that?
To live in the world of

1971
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,147
and what was that? >> To live in the
world of possibilities, to embrace

1972
01:16:19,149 --> 01:16:21,182
to live in the world of possibilities, to
embrace thoughts as something not to be

1973
01:16:21,184 --> 01:16:23,784
possibilities, to embrace thoughts as something
not to be ignored but shouted from the

1974
01:16:23,786 --> 01:16:25,085
thoughts as something not to be ignored
but shouted from the highest tower.

1975
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,053
Ignored but shouted from the
highest tower. >> So...

1976
01:16:27,055 --> 01:16:30,289
Highest tower. >> So...
You're dead...

1977
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:32,991
So... You're dead... Right now?

1978
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:34,592
You're dead... Right now? >>
I thought you figured that

1979
01:16:34,594 --> 01:16:37,161
right now? >> I thought you
figured that out in the tent.

1980
01:16:37,163 --> 01:16:41,532
I thought you figured that out in the tent.
Yes. No one can see me but you.

1981
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:47,070
- Out in the tent.
- Yes. No one can see me but you.

1982
01:16:47,072 --> 01:16:50,552
- Yes. No one can see me but you.
- >> What's the matter with him?

1983
01:16:54,711 --> 01:17:00,614
Five minutes. >> Oh. Oh, but
I was supposed to earn.

1984
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,083
Oh. Oh, but I was supposed to earn
my seat at the table of eternal

1985
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:04,551
oh, but I was supposed to earn my seat
at the table of eternal literary greats!

1986
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,619
My seat at the table of eternal literary
greats! I have no goal completed!

1987
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:08,187
Literary greats! I have no goal completed!
You have tried.

1988
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:10,856
I have no goal completed! >> You
have tried. >> And I have failed.

1989
01:17:10,858 --> 01:17:13,158
You have tried. >> And I have failed.
I am not a sculptor.

1990
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,660
And I have failed. I am not a sculptor.
I am not a writer.

1991
01:17:15,662 --> 01:17:18,095
I am not a sculptor. I am not a writer.
I am not a painter!

1992
01:17:18,097 --> 01:17:20,197
I am not a writer. I am not a painter!
I am not a dancer!

1993
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:25,669
I am not a painter! I am not a dancer!
I am a stupid, drunk, scared,

1994
01:17:25,671 --> 01:17:28,772
I am not a dancer! I am a stupid,
drunk, scared, dying man!

1995
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:33,209
I am a stupid, drunk, scared, dying man!
I am... A dead man!

1996
01:17:33,211 --> 01:17:35,277
Dying man! I am... A dead man!
Perhaps you are all of these

1997
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:37,612
I am... A dead man! >> Perhaps you are all
of these things, k. Roth, but you have

1998
01:17:37,614 --> 01:17:39,046
perhaps you are all of these things, k.
Roth, but you have never been scared.

1999
01:17:39,048 --> 01:17:43,283
Things, k. Roth, but you have never
been scared. Why should you be now?

2000
01:17:43,285 --> 01:17:48,688
Never been scared. Why should you be now?
You're right, father.

2001
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:51,957
Why should you be now? >> You're
right, father. >> Four minutes.

2002
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:56,027
You're right, father. >> Four minutes.
I-I<i> can</i> be stupid.

2003
01:17:56,029 --> 01:17:57,962
- Four minutes.
- >> I-I<i> can</i> be stupid.

2004
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:00,064
- I-I<i> can</i> be stupid.
- And... and I<i> can</i> be drunk!

2005
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:04,034
And... and I<i> can</i> be drunk!
I'm kind of faced right now!

2006
01:18:04,036 --> 01:18:07,070
And... and I<i> can</i> be drunk! I'm kind of faced
right now! But I was not, could not, have

2007
01:18:07,072 --> 01:18:09,172
I'm kind of faced right now! But I was
not, could not, have never been scared!

2008
01:18:09,174 --> 01:18:12,008
But I was not, could not, have never
been scared! And I vow for the next four

2009
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:14,710
never been scared! And I vow for the
next four minutes, things will be no

2010
01:18:14,712 --> 01:18:16,044
and I vow for the next four minutes,
things will be no different!

2011
01:18:16,046 --> 01:18:17,979
Minutes, things will be no different!
That's my boy.

2012
01:18:17,981 --> 01:18:22,717
- Different!
- >> That's my boy.

2013
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,653
- That's my boy.
- I-I have become so very strange,

2014
01:18:25,655 --> 01:18:26,620
I-I have become so very strange,
father!

2015
01:18:26,622 --> 01:18:28,855
I-I have become so very strange, father!
You have only become

2016
01:18:28,857 --> 01:18:30,690
father! >> You have only
become yourself, k. Roth.

2017
01:18:30,692 --> 01:18:32,291
You have only become yourself, k.
Roth. Come now.

2018
01:18:32,293 --> 01:18:33,725
Yourself, k. Roth. Come now.
It is time to finish.

2019
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,926
Come now. It is time to finish.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2020
01:18:34,928 --> 01:18:36,694
It is time to finish. >> Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Could... could I not just stay a

2021
01:18:36,696 --> 01:18:37,394
whoa, whoa, whoa. Could... could
I not just stay a little longer?

2022
01:18:37,396 --> 01:18:39,095
Could... could I not just stay a little
longer? Um, mills will be lost without

2023
01:18:39,097 --> 01:18:39,662
little longer? Um, mills
will be lost without me.

2024
01:18:39,664 --> 01:18:42,164
Um, mills will be lost without me.
You know it's time, k. Roth.

2025
01:18:42,166 --> 01:18:44,266
- Me.
- >> You know it's time, k. Roth.

2026
01:18:44,268 --> 01:18:46,134
- You know it's time, k. Roth.
- They're playing your song,

2027
01:18:46,136 --> 01:18:47,101
They're playing your song,
k. Roth.

2028
01:18:47,103 --> 01:18:48,836
They're playing your song, k. Roth.
The one from earlier.

You were all right.
A little strange, but all right.

Whoo!
