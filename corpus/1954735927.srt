1
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,461
Looks like that cowboy's a goner.

2
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:23,454
-Mark Allen.
-Chip Woolley.

3
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:29,534
-You from around here?
-No. You?

4
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,613
Hey, darling. Listen, if you're not busy...

5
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,408
All right then.

6
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,896
What do you say we finish this
and get the hell out of here?

7
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:01,490
Yeah. That sounds good.

8
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:13,606
Been a pleasure.

9
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,012
-You can say that again.
-All right.

10
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:30,790
Thanks, man. You saved my ass.
I owe you one.

11
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,195
-Is that you?
-That's me.

12
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:34,233
-You ride the circuit?
-Bulls. You?

13
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,360
Bareback. I'll see you back at the grounds.

14
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:39,928
Nah. No more rodeo for me.
Pop's into oil up in Alaska.

15
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,639
Thinks we're going to strike it rich.

16
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:46,576
Yeah, you're gonna freeze your ass off
up there.

17
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:47,902
Yeah, probably.

18
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:52,551
-Take it easy, man.
-Yeah, you too.

19
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,620
Don't go picking no fights
with them grizzlies!

20
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,974
Well, how'd he do?

21
00:04:58,144 --> 00:04:59,702
He's kind of lazy.

22
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,978
Looks like he's falling asleep.

23
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:13,624
-When is the race?
-Sunday.

24
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:19,855
You know, maybe try some of those vitamins.

25
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,900
You got it, <i>jefe.</i>

26
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:32,612
Well, with two claims, a bowed tendon,
and our biggest owner walking away...

27
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,507
I'd say we in a world of hurt, little brother.

28
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:40,785
We don't get more horses to train,
we gonna be out of business.

29
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:43,345
Well, we got four running this week.

30
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,981
Should be favored on a couple of 'em.

31
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,190
We're 0 for 28 this meet.

32
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,293
We got three seconds.

33
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,465
What don't you understand?

34
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:05,777
Owners don't wanna run second.

35
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,676
They want their picture taken.

36
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:11,077
That'd be in the winner's circle.

37
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:20,321
Give me another one, Gus.

38
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,863
We ain't running the tab tonight.

39
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,660
Man, you sure are getting tight around here.

40
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,578
Last one.

41
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,211
You're in my will.

42
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:55,891
So, Chip, you got any long shots for us?

43
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,455
You're kidding. That's all he's ever got.

44
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:02,933
Last time he won a race,
my wife was a virgin.

45
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:08,040
That's funny, 'cause I heard she still was.

46
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:26,389
I'm all in.

47
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,326
Looks like we a bit short.

48
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,306
I'll give you the rest next week, Miguel.
Sorry, man.

49
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,146
Hey, there, boys.

50
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,153
Lookee here.

51
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:01,224
Who says gambling don't pay?

52
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,493
Where'd that come from?

53
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:08,056
That right there

54
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:11,035
is evidence of some serious card sharking.

55
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,698
Those boys down at Gus's,
they don't know what hit 'em.

56
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:17,800
I drew two flushes, two on the river,

57
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,573
and I wiped them suckers out.

58
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:24,111
Well, we got a race tomorrow
and you can barely stand up.

59
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:27,381
God! Stop your bitching, Bill!

60
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,089
I won, didn't I?

61
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,853
Our losing streak is over. You?

62
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:36,919
You just gotta have a little faith.

63
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:41,766
<i>And it's Faith Be Gone by a length and a half.</i>

64
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,071
<i>Well, you just don't see that every day, folks.</i>

65
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:59,209
<i>Down and Dirty fell to his knees</i>
<i>and still won by five lengths.</i>

66
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:11,155
<i>And it's another win</i>
<i>by You Gotta Be Kidding Me,</i>

67
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:13,290
<i>giving him three wins in a row.</i>

68
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:17,530
<i>Twist the Night Away got up for second,</i>
<i>Topanga Canyon rallied nicely for third.</i>

69
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:26,044
Don't worry, honey. It's just a slump.
Everybody has them.

70
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:29,237
Things will turn around for you.

71
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:32,284
Yeah, I don't know, Rosa Lee.
It don't feel like it this time.

72
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:34,747
You'll see.

73
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,018
<i>It's been a lackluster year so far,</i>
<i>but sales are beginning to pick up.</i>

74
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:43,426
<i>Two more of the highest priced horses</i>
<i>at auction in Ruidoso were picked up today</i>

75
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:46,397
<i>by Mark Allen and his Double Eagle Ranch.</i>

76
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,559
<i>This past Friday, 12 horses were sold...</i>

77
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:49,966
I know that guy.

78
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:53,538
-What guy?
-Mark Allen.

79
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,969
Sounds like he's putting together
a nice string of horses.

80
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,795
I don't suppose you remember me.

81
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:58,763
Chip Woolley.

82
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,638
I'll be damned.

83
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,808
How could I forget you?

84
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,680
I can't believe it.

85
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:16,881
Charlie, this here's an old friend of mine,
Chip Woolley.

86
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,390
This is Charlie Figueroa,
this is my right-hand man.

87
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,859
-Nice to meet ya.
-Yeah, likewise.

88
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,255
Well, this is crazy. How you been?

89
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:27,890
Good. Real good.

90
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:31,431
You know, I heard you's back from Alaska.

91
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:32,801
Seems you done all right.

92
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:36,337
Well, there's a lot of oil up there.

93
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,535
I'll tell you though, I miss the ponies.

94
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:43,639
Yeah? Well, the talk is you got quite a stable.

95
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,348
Yeah, I think we got a few runners.
We will see.

96
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,682
How about you? What have you been up to?

97
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,383
Well, me and my brother,
we got us a place down by Sunland.

98
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:52,822
-Yeah?
-I've been training some.

99
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:55,053
-Yeah? How's that going?
-Not bad.

100
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:58,257
-Win some, lose some.
-I hear ya.

101
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:06,862
You know, you ever need another trainer

102
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:11,800
or someone to watch your back...

103
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,509
Well... I might at that.

104
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:22,383
Listen, why don't you stick around tonight?

105
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:24,184
We got us a little party going on.

106
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,418
-Yeah. Sounds good.
-Yeah? Good. Come on.

107
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,429
-Yeah, you tell it.
-You tell it. I'll tell it.

108
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,593
But you tell it better than me.

109
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,830
-So I'm with my crazy cousin here...
-You're gonna tell it anyway.

110
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,964
...at his favorite bar in Mexico, right?

111
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,008
He's been ordering
four shots of tequila at a time.

112
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,738
Now, he's drinking two,
throwing the rest on me.

113
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:49,578
We are liquored up inside and out. Right?

114
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,913
Kelly's gotta take a leak, so he gets up.

115
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,248
I gotta go too, so I follow him into the can.

116
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:58,155
The place is packed.
There's nowhere to go and I can't wait,

117
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:02,422
so I start pissing
all over the back of Kelly's jeans.

118
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:03,484
No, no, no, no, no.

119
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:06,896
Now, I'm thinking it's funny as hell
until he turns around.

120
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,992
It ain't Kelly.

121
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:11,002
Shit.

122
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,163
-You got a couple of good shiners that night.
-Yes, I did.

123
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:16,504
-A couple of broken ribs, too.
-You're lucky you ain't dead.

124
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:20,209
Hey.

125
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,978
-Here's my lucky charm.
-How you doing, Mark?

126
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,245
I missed seeing you these last
couple of weeks. Where you been?

127
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,117
-I've been at the races.
-You're always at the races.

128
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:31,452
Baby girl, that's the horse business.

129
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:34,425
Yeah? Well,
when do we get to horse around?

130
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,763
So, what are we waiting for, boys?

131
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,871
I can't get anything to drop!

132
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:51,673
You boys still thirsty?

133
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,803
-Hell yeah!
-Yes, ma'am.

134
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,347
That's my girl, Sandy. You're the best, babe.

135
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,413
Sandy?

136
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,790
Who the hell is Sandy?

137
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,697
I said who the hell is Sandy?

138
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,628
You don't remember my name, do you?

139
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,606
-What?
-Do you?

140
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,410
-Is it Claire?
-God.

141
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,948
Hey, man. Stop!

142
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,519
Wait, stop! Wait!

143
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:42,252
-It's Misty, right?
-You son of...

144
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:44,353
All right, it's Connie.

145
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,829
It's Sally and...

146
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,259
Stop! Wait!

147
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:55,230
I'm kidding. I know your...

148
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,410
Tammy?

149
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,004
Lord!

150
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:10,750
I got this.

151
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:13,885
Shit...

152
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,158
-Yeah?
-Hey, Mark, Keith Krupper here.

153
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:26,800
Sorry to call so late,
but a horse just crossed my desk.

154
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:29,033
-This just couldn't wait.
-Shoot.

155
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:32,206
He's a two-year-old thoroughbred,
won four in a row.

156
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:35,542
You know I race quarter horses.
I got no interest in thoroughbreds.

157
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:39,847
He's a stakes winner, just voted
the best two-year-old in Canada.

158
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,250
Name's Mine That Bird.

159
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:44,218
<i>His daddy, Birdstone, won the Belmont.</i>

160
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:45,381
What's the catch?

161
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,790
He's all American, bred in Kentucky.

162
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:51,159
He can't run the big races in Canada
as a three-year-old.

163
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,720
That's crazy.

164
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,995
<i>But the kicker is he's eligible to run</i>
<i>the Juvenile Breeders' Cup.</i>

165
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:59,504
A two million dollar race,
the whole world will be watching.

166
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:03,474
-How much they want for him?
<i>-$500,000.</i>

167
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,806
<i>But I might be able to get them to take four.</i>

168
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,640
You need to see him, Mark.

169
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,642
Tell you what,
I'll send my trainer up to take a look.

170
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:16,486
-But no promises.
<i>-Great. I'll talk to you soon.</i>

171
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,665
Tower, November 3-4...

172
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:40,676
Welcome, Mr. Woolley.
Please, make yourself at home.

173
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,472
Thank you.

174
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,217
Can I get you anything to drink
before we take off?

175
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:01,596
Bird's been real special for me.
He's real special.

176
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,862
Knew what he was supposed to do
from the word go.

177
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,961
I saw you picked him up at auction
for only $9,500.

178
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,202
We stole him that night.
Thought he'd go for a lot more.

179
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:13,206
Never know where that next jewel shows up.

180
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,174
Told you he won three stakes in a row, eh?

181
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:19,249
Well, not many two-year-olds
put that on their resume.

182
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,683
Then why are you selling him?

183
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:23,813
Buy low, sell high. That's what I do.

184
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:33,358
He does this from time to time.

185
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,698
He usually doesn't go too far.

186
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,241
-Easy, Bird.
-Come on, you dope.

187
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,249
-Easy.
-That's it. Come on, Bird.

188
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,753
Kind of small, ain't he?

189
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,221
And a little crooked up front.

190
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,550
So was Seabiscuit.

191
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,186
-Come on, buddy.
-Come here, boy.

192
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,337
Sure got a mind of his own.

193
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:24,673
You seen him on the track yet?

194
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:28,218
-I don't think it's worth it, Mark.
<i>-Well, you made the trip.</i>

195
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,915
Yeah, but I just...
I don't think he's what you're after.

196
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,222
He walks funny, for one.

197
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:39,923
Look, I had braces on my legs
as a kid 'cause I walked funny, too.

198
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,729
-Let's give him a try.
-Okay.

199
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:20,132
-That was a 46 flat.
-What'd I tell ya?

200
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,532
What changed?

201
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,473
<i>You don't even notice he's crooked</i>
<i>when he runs.</i>

202
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,477
<i>The little shit barely touches the ground.</i>

203
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:29,810
He's got perfect action, real professional and

204
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,311
-he's fast.
<i>-Yeah, but a gelding?</i>

205
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,613
Forget about breeding. This one's a runner.

206
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,754
You sure he's sound?

207
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:42,020
<i>There's not a pimple on him, Mark.</i>

208
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:44,896
You want this horse.

209
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,564
All right, sit tight. I'm on my way to Doc's.

210
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,237
<i>Come on, we always talked about</i>
<i>owning a thoroughbred together.</i>

211
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,969
Breeders' Cup is in California in 10 days.

212
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,275
If we wanna do this, we gotta get moving.

213
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:02,678
Four hundred seems like a lot of money.

214
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:05,376
Hell, if he just runs second,
we got our money back.

215
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,749
And if he don't run second,

216
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,584
we bought ourselves a very expensive pony.

217
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:15,484
You know I don't like taking leaps like this,
sight unseen.

218
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:17,392
He's already won $300,000.

219
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:19,121
I don't know.

220
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:23,161
I'll tell you what then. I'll buy him.

221
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,366
I'll buy him myself.
You like what you see, I'll cut you in.

222
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:35,711
Shit. I'm in.

223
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:55,891
There he is, No. 9.

224
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,194
That's all of him, huh?

225
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:00,995
He's only two. He'll grow some.

226
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:07,206
Well, he'd better hurry up
'cause he's not looking too good at 24 to 1.

227
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,880
Don't you worry, Doc. He's gonna do great.

228
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,749
If Chip says he can run, he can run.

229
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:20,449
Baffert and the sheik
got the favorite, Midshipman.

230
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:24,418
Howdy.

231
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:36,167
I guess we're gonna find out
what we got pretty quick.

232
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:40,512
<i>Last few left to load, Street Hero goes in.</i>

233
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:43,013
<i>West Side Bernie to come take the lineup.</i>

234
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:44,447
<i>Gates closed, all set.</i>

235
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,678
<i>And away they go.</i>

236
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:50,881
<i>Midshipman, West Side Bernie</i>
<i>broke away well.</i>

237
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:53,288
<i>Street Hero came out quickly as well.</i>

238
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,489
<i>Here's Mine That Bird in the black colors</i>
<i>right there in the fourth position.</i>

239
00:21:57,563 --> 00:22:02,000
<i>Then we come back to Terrain. Gallant Son</i>
<i>has to go a little wide into the turn.</i>

240
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:06,026
<i>In behind there is Silent Valor</i>
<i>and Munnings races towards the rear.</i>

241
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,972
<i>The pace is good,</i>
<i>12 lengths from first to last.</i>

242
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,942
I mean, he's in there. He's doing good.

243
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,035
Yeah.

244
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:16,240
<i>Now they've settled in with Mine That Bird</i>
<i>a comfortable fifth,</i>

245
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:18,215
<i>just four lengths off the leaders.</i>

246
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:20,547
<i>Then back to Pioneer of the Nile.</i>

247
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,246
<i>Bushranger is on the far side.</i>

248
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,518
<i>Terrain giving them eight lengths start</i>
<i>and then comes Gallant Son.</i>

249
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:29,357
<i>Behind that Azul Leon,</i>
<i>and Munnings is still towards the rear.</i>

250
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:33,888
<i>Into the far turn they go.</i>
<i>And it's Midshipman still showing the way.</i>

251
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:55,520
Let's go! Let's go!

252
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:58,750
<i>And Midshipman has won</i>
<i>the Breeders' Cup Juvenile!</i>

253
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:01,486
<i>Square Eddie with second,</i>
<i>Street Hero finished third.</i>

254
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,688
<i>Then came Terrain,</i>
<i>behind that Pioneer of the Nile,</i>

255
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,664
<i>and Mine That Bird finished last.</i>

256
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:12,094
-I'm getting too old for this.
-Where's the bar?

257
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:16,533
Come on!

258
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:33,284
Why'd you hire him?

259
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:38,319
Doc, he's only had the horse a week.

260
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,960
We bought ourselves a champion
and he run dead last. What's that tell ya?

261
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:49,530
Bird's never run on synthetic track before.

262
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:52,234
It ain't the track, Mark.

263
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:56,646
This guy's going nowhere.
He's got a terrible record.

264
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,512
Yeah, maybe.

265
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:03,151
But he's got a great record with me.

266
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,351
This can't be personal.
We're running a business here.

267
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:11,589
I know that.

268
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:15,563
And we've got some hard decisions to make.

269
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:19,827
I'm saying three strikes and he's out.

270
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,437
That's a bit harsh, Doc.

271
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,811
So is losing.

272
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:45,860
<i>It's Oconee and Bryden,</i>
<i>continuing to throw it down!</i>

273
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:49,162
<i>One furlong from home</i>
<i>and on the far outside,</i>

274
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:51,634
<i>Mine That Bird is charging hard.</i>

275
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:54,228
<i>Mine That Bird has upset Minded...</i>

276
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,699
<i>Mine That Bird is charging hard!</i>

277
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:02,804
<i>Mine That Bird has upset Minded</i>
<i>in the final six...</i>

278
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:05,179
-He comes from off the pace.
-Yeah.

279
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,717
He needs to chase somebody.

280
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:09,219
<i>Mine That Bird is charging hard!</i>

281
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:13,554
<i>Mine That Bird has upset Minded</i>
<i>in the final sixteenth.</i>

282
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:16,554
I'll be damned.

283
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:28,834
-You're spoiling Bird, you know that?
<i>-Si.</i>

284
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:31,466
Give me that.

285
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:11,370
-Hey.
-Here he is right there.

286
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:14,905
-Good luck to you, Case.
-Thanks, Doc.

287
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,039
Listen up, he's a one run horse.

288
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:20,516
You need to keep him covered up
till the three-eighths pole, then let him roll.

289
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:22,644
I don't want him on the lead
till ya hit that wire.

290
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:23,778
Gotcha.

291
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:25,186
Here we go, boys.

292
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:27,089
Here we go.

293
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:38,402
You gotta look good in the winner's circle.

294
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,801
Well, let's go.

295
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:44,701
<i>They make their way into the stretch</i>
<i>and Mine That Bird now digs in along the rail</i>

296
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:46,437
<i>but Scorewithcater puts his head in front,</i>

297
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:48,138
<i>down the middle of the track</i>
<i>rallying for the lead.</i>

298
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:51,277
<i>-With only two furlongs to run...</i>
-Come on, Bird.

299
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,649
<i>Smoking Legend in the white silks makes</i>
<i>his move, but Mine That Bird fights back.</i>

300
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:56,550
<i>-Scorewithcater responds as...</i>
-Come on!

301
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:57,918
<i>...the three horses lay it down.</i>

302
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,220
<i>Scorewithcater gets the upper hand</i>
<i>two lengths in front.</i>

303
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:05,127
<i>Mine That Bird now beginning to tire</i>
<i>and Scorewithcater is just too good today.</i>

304
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:08,064
<i>Scorewithcater, the winner,</i>
<i>Mine That Bird second,</i>

305
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,158
<i>Smoking Legend got up for third.</i>

306
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:12,363
That's not how Bird wants to run.

307
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,032
Casey made his move way too soon.
Bird didn't have nothing left.

308
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,137
He should have.
Ain't like he was running against much.

309
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:24,706
Yeah, well, at least we got second.

310
00:28:24,783 --> 00:28:26,648
That puts us in the Sunland Derby
next month.

311
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:29,380
-$800,000 to run at.
-Yup.

312
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:33,280
-We'll be all right.
-Yup.

313
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:40,028
We're bankrupt.

314
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:43,824
Bankrupt... Give me a break.
We got $2,000 from the race today.

315
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:45,130
$2,000?

316
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:50,072
Auggie's Ranch and Feed, $2,300, past due.

317
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:54,337
Miller's Farrier Services, $2,900, past due.

318
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:58,747
Rancho Veterinary Services, $9,000

319
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,148
way past due.

320
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:04,712
Look, just tell 'em we got a few more races
coming up this month.

321
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,052
No, no, we don't.

322
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:09,787
Yeah, we got the starter on the fifth
and we'll win the maiden claimer easy.

323
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,853
Hutchinson took his last horse away today.

324
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:16,427
So did Sanders and Parker.

325
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:25,171
Bird's all we got.

326
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:29,937
He's all we need.

327
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:33,781
You can't hang everything
on one horse, Chip. You know that!

328
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:35,752
We're fine!

329
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:38,483
Bird'll take the Sunland Derby, you watch.

330
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,623
He'll run 'em off their feet.

331
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,267
<i>With three-eighths of a mile to go</i>
<i>on the Sunland Derby,</i>

332
00:29:56,341 --> 00:30:00,471
<i>it's Kelly Leak on the outside, Mine That Bird</i>
<i>on the inside going nose and nose.</i>

333
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:05,349
<i>And here comes Scorewithcater,</i>
<i>who moves into third</i>

334
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,545
<i>as Mythical Power, the gray,</i>
<i>moves up on the far outside.</i>

335
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,386
<i>But Kelly Leak with a sudden burst of speed,</i>
<i>opens up by two lengths.</i>

336
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,425
<i>Mine That Bird is turning along the rail</i>

337
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:17,087
<i>as Scorewithcater</i>
<i>and Mythical Power gain ground.</i>

338
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:21,030
<i>But it's Kelly Leak who's gonna win</i>
<i>the Sunland Derby by two and a half lengths.</i>

339
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:22,999
<i>Mythical Power getting up for second,</i>

340
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:25,036
<i>Scorewithcater hangs on for the show</i>

341
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,594
<i>and Mine That Bird fades to fourth.</i>

342
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:30,733
Fourth?

343
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,616
-Good job.
-Great day, huh? Great day.

344
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:48,926
Casey! You call that a ride?

345
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:51,189
You rushed him up there way too early again.

346
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:53,493
Look, I told you he's got one run in him.

347
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:56,965
You cost me another big race.
You're off the horse!

348
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:59,401
Fine! You need an excuse, I got your excuse.

349
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:00,802
It ain't the horse, it's you!

350
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:03,365
You can't train worth shit. Never could.

351
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:05,932
I don't know why anybody'd give you a horse
to train in the first place.

352
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:07,171
You piece of shit.

353
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,791
-Mr. Woolley.
-Yes, sir.

354
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,836
Your brother came through surgery just fine.

355
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,001
But the breaks in his leg are very serious.

356
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,668
There's a plate and 12 screws
holding the bones together.

357
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:15,008
So he's got to stay off that leg
or it won't heal properly.

358
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:19,179
He'll be in recovery another half an hour.
You can visit with him then.

359
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,718
Thank you, sir.

360
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:32,758
Chip's gonna have a fit
if anyone else trains Bird.

361
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:35,559
That's all he's got.

362
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,369
We'll move him to my place.

363
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:43,305
I got plenty of folks that'll help him out.

364
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,913
Sorry, this one didn't go through either.

365
00:32:56,888 --> 00:33:00,949
Maybe try to put half on this card

366
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:02,687
and half on that one.

367
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:34,790
You tell anyone I was here
and I'm a dead man.

368
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:40,190
Yeah, had me a little accident.

369
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:46,101
Thought for a minute
I might not see you again.

370
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:50,300
I know...

371
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:55,669
I know things ain't exactly worked out so far,
Bird, but...

372
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:59,041
Yeah, that ain't your fault. It's mine.

373
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:02,108
You know, here I am

374
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:06,515
expecting you to make it all happen,
and well,

375
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:09,455
we're supposed to be a team.

376
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,127
I know I ain't been there for ya.

377
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,432
Heck, I ain't been there for nobody.

378
00:34:23,908 --> 00:34:25,967
I'm sorry I let you down, Bird.

379
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,241
And

380
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,841
I'm sorry it took this to wake me up.

381
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:37,487
You deserve better, so...

382
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,085
So let's make a deal.

383
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:47,722
I promise I'll give you everything I got.

384
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,364
And you, you don't hold back.

385
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,701
We'll do it together from now on.

386
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,041
Yeah, I know.

387
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:08,681
Deal?

388
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:17,759
All right. Okay, then.

389
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:20,853
Deal.

390
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:43,913
Look.

391
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,155
Alex!

392
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:26,797
Come here a sec!
Somebody I want you to meet.

393
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:29,722
Hey.

394
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,826
-Hey, you made it.
-Yeah.

395
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:39,936
No, not a girl, Mark.

396
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,003
Hey.

397
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,986
Chip, this here's Alex. Best rider I got.

398
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:53,785
She's gonna help you out with Bird.

399
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:57,285
What?

400
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:01,729
Well, must have been a hell of a ride
for ya, huh?

401
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,858
Let's get you up to the house,
get you settled in.

402
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:05,903
Alex, put Bird in the stall for me?

403
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:07,329
Sure.

404
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:13,908
I tell ya, that Alex sure is something.

405
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:15,912
You're gonna love her.

406
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:18,748
<i>He can barely walk.</i>

407
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:21,410
How in heck's he gonna train a racehorse?

408
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:23,681
I got it all figured out.
Alex is gonna help him.

409
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:27,851
Alex! Come on, Mark, I know you like her
and all, but let's face it.

410
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:31,828
-We need a trainer here.
-Doc, you gotta give him a chance.

411
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,098
We already did and he shot two of 'em.

412
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,761
Bird had two bad rides. He still almost won.

413
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:44,004
Lone Star Derby's coming up quick.
Bird's never looked better.

414
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:49,003
-Yeah?
<i>-Is Mark Allen there, please?</i>

415
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,742
-Speaking.
<i>-Hello, Mr. Allen, this is Ben Huffman,</i>

416
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,681
<i>racing secretary at Churchill Downs.</i>

417
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:54,809
<i>I'm calling to tell you</i>

418
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:57,946
<i>that Mine That Bird has qualified to run</i>
<i>in the Kentucky Derby.</i>

419
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:01,219
That's very funny, Earl. I'm in a meeting
with Doc right now. I'll call you back.

420
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:02,316
<i>No, Mr. Allen...</i>

421
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,057
Okay.

422
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:16,400
Earl, I ain't fooling with ya, all right?
I'm busy right now.

423
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:19,204
Mr. Allen, this really is Ben Huffman,

424
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:22,110
and your horse
really did qualify for the Derby.

425
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:24,538
I'm sorry, what?

426
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:27,483
<i>Your horse really did qualify for the Derby.</i>

427
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:28,610
How'd that happen?

428
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:31,280
Well, based on his stakes earnings last year
in Canada.

429
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,654
-The Kentucky Derby?
<i>-That's right.</i>

430
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:45,558
One for the doctor.

431
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:50,736
-One for the missus.
-Thank you.

432
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:54,711
One for the brains in the family.

433
00:38:56,714 --> 00:39:00,150
And one for the cowboy who's gotta be nuts.

434
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,776
He's been nuts a long time.

435
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,878
-Hey.
-Three more, bartender.

436
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:05,650
-Hey, Doc, how are you?
-Hello, Kel.

437
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:07,884
-Joanne. Hello.
-Hi, Daddy.

438
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,517
Good to see you, honey.

439
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:12,791
-Hi, Kevin. Good to see you.
-Hi, Kelly. How you doing, buddy?

440
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:15,424
-Hey, Mom.
-You guys look so pretty.

441
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:17,694
-Ladies.
-Thank you.

442
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,201
Thank you.

443
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:23,434
-Cousin. You get it?
-Thank you, cousin.

444
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:26,434
All right.

445
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:30,113
Daddy, a toast.

446
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:33,975
To your little horse and a big run!

447
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:35,076
Yeah.

448
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:37,986
Well, honey, we ain't exactly decided
we're going yet.

449
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:41,923
How often do you get invited
to run in the Kentucky Derby!

450
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,689
I know it's exciting,
but we don't belong there.

451
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:46,423
We can't even win in New Mexico.

452
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:48,624
It's a horse race, Dad. Anything can happen.

453
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,100
I just don't want to embarrass ourselves.

454
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:54,229
Leonard, so what if you don't win.

455
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:57,102
It'll be a lot of fun no matter what happens.

456
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,233
We'll get us those big old hats
and fancy dresses.

457
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:00,332
Yes!

458
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:04,604
Think of the mint juleps.

459
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:06,547
We don't even have a jockey.

460
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:09,415
We'll get a new one when we get there.

461
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:14,989
Come on, Doc.

462
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:22,657
May God and Don Julio help us.

463
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:29,372
Kentucky, here we come!

464
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:33,476
Honey, it's gonna be wonderful!

465
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:55,125
You're breaking my heart, you know that?

466
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,499
Listen, this ain't easy, man,

467
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:09,407
but me and Doc had a talk.

468
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,508
We're gonna change things up.

469
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:15,744
You ain't going to the Lone Star Derby.

470
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:19,888
I mean, not now.

471
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:24,192
Just give me one more shot.

472
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,662
-Decision's made.
-But Bird'll do good there.

473
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:30,030
I mean, he's really coming along.
We could turn this around.

474
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:31,934
I don't know.

475
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:38,139
You think
you finally got this horse figured out?

476
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,109
Yeah, I do.

477
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:42,476
Yeah, and how far you think you can drive
on that leg?

478
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,407
-Far as you wanna go.
-How about Louisville?

479
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,880
Louisville?

480
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:53,423
Mine That Bird's
running in the Kentucky Derby.

481
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:55,923
You're kidding me, right?

482
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:58,258
We entered him this morning.

483
00:41:58,596 --> 00:41:59,995
In the Kentucky Derby?

484
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:07,268
-You got one last shot.
-Son of a bitch.

485
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:09,998
Hey, man! I just bought this.

486
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:12,837
All right.

487
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,171
Time to tighten up the screws, buddy.

488
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,681
Holy shit.

489
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:29,988
Bird, you have it all, buddy.

490
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:45,098
Take Bird out slow
and gallop him once around.

491
00:42:45,176 --> 00:42:47,007
Good morning to you, too.

492
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:17,039
You're fighting him.
Ya gotta loosen up, get him to relax.

493
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:18,369
I wasn't fighting him.

494
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,637
Take him around again
and give him a little more rein.

495
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:24,545
-He's not gonna run off with ya.
-I know what I'm doing.

496
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:26,372
If you knew what you were doing,

497
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,509
I wouldn't have to be out here
telling you, would I?

498
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:33,317
Thank you.

499
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:13,288
When are you letting us out of this hole?

500
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:15,288
When I'm good and ready.

501
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:18,934
-Like sometime today?
-What, you got a date?

502
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:21,965
You are such a pain in my...

503
00:44:48,766 --> 00:44:50,757
-What was that all about?
-What?

504
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:55,299
"What?" You went 58 and change.
It's a workout, not a race.

505
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:56,670
He did it easy.

506
00:44:58,442 --> 00:45:01,411
It ain't gonna help us
if he's all used up before the Derby.

507
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:03,504
Used up? What are you talking about?

508
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:07,782
I'm talking about working him right.
You don't listen!

509
00:45:08,152 --> 00:45:09,847
-The hell I don't.
-You don't.

510
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,184
I need a rider who can take instructions.

511
00:45:12,256 --> 00:45:14,224
I have just about had it with your shit.

512
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:17,226
You have been riding my ass
ever since you got here!

513
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:19,125
That's another thing. Keep your ass down!

514
00:45:19,196 --> 00:45:20,254
Keep my ass out of this!

515
00:45:20,331 --> 00:45:22,322
Well, it's a little hard to do
when it blocks the sun.

516
00:45:24,335 --> 00:45:27,930
Fine. Let's see you ride him, cowboy!

517
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:01,260
Listen up, y'all.

518
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,639
Change of plans.
Alex, you're riding with Chip.

519
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,109
-What?
-What?

520
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:10,647
Yeah. There's no way you're going it alone
on that leg.

521
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:12,511
-You can't handle Bird by yourself.
-Sure I can.

522
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,414
Listen, me and Kelly will be right behind ya.

523
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:17,613
Stick with you the whole way.
Like flies to shit.

524
00:46:18,522 --> 00:46:20,820
Charlie, we'll see you in a couple of days.

525
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:22,415
I'll have Bird's stall ready for you

526
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:23,926
-when you get there.
-All right.

527
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:26,053
-Kelly!
-Yup.

528
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:29,528
Man, I love road trips!

529
00:46:56,093 --> 00:46:57,321
Do you mind?

530
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:06,429
Get off of me!

531
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:13,702
Y'all ready?

532
00:47:17,615 --> 00:47:18,912
There.

533
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,211
Let's head 'em up, move 'em out.

534
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:50,231
Yeah, like flies to shit.

535
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:57,703
Don't breathe it in. Are you kidding me?

536
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:18,266
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

537
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:26,040
Hey, Bird.

538
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:36,281
Damn it! I left a bag in Mark's rig.
My lunch was in there.

539
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:39,789
I guess you're gonna have to eat real food
like the rest of the world.

540
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:42,086
You call that real food?

541
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:49,231
It's gonna take two days.

542
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:51,724
Well, we ain't got two days.

543
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:55,170
I gotta get the part. That's gonna take a day.

544
00:49:55,572 --> 00:49:57,597
Then another one to put it in.

545
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:00,039
That's the best I can do.

546
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:02,772
Well?

547
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:07,845
Make sure you tell 'em we'll be back for Bird
first thing in the morning.

548
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:10,045
Find out what time the track opens.

549
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,212
I will.

550
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:15,054
Make sure that stall has enough bedding
and that it's dry, too.

551
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,752
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

552
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:18,454
Make sure he gets his vitamins.

553
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:20,690
And put his leg wraps on, all four of 'em.

554
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:24,498
I got it already!
Would you just relax and let me handle this?

555
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:31,536
Whatever you do,
do not forget to use that stall lock.

556
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,597
Don't worry, man.
We're only a day behind ya.

557
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:04,106
Me and Kelly are gonna take the bikes.
You and Alex keep going.

558
00:51:04,174 --> 00:51:06,301
We'll catch you in Louisville. How's Bird?

559
00:51:07,144 --> 00:51:09,612
Good. He's traveling good.

560
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,477
We got him settled in at the center.

561
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:13,914
We'll be back on the road
early in the morning.

562
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:17,519
-And Alex?
<i>-She's still alive.</i>

563
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:20,955
Where are you?

564
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:22,548
<i>I'm in Brownfield.</i>

565
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:23,957
Sounds like a party.

566
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:27,125
Yeah, well, you know these little local fillies.

567
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:30,656
They sure do know how to be hospitable.

568
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:33,734
Listen, I gotta go.

569
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:36,464
<i>We'll holler at you when we get into town.</i>

570
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,531
-Have a great trip.
<i>-Yeah, you bet...</i>

571
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:44,574
See you in a couple days.

572
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:48,277
You don't expect me to stay
in this hell hole, do you?

573
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,553
What's the matter with it?

574
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,521
What's it gonna be?
By the hour or the night?

575
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:47,038
Finally.

576
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:02,220
I see you have the luxury suite.

577
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:03,850
What do you want?

578
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:07,693
I don't suppose you have some toothpaste
I could smear on my teeth.

579
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:19,341
Y'all have a nice night.

580
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:36,022
You look great.

581
00:53:37,461 --> 00:53:38,519
Thank you.

582
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:40,585
Here.

583
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:43,824
I got you breakfast.

584
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:52,039
What in the hell is this?

585
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:55,635
Yogurt. I'm sure you've never had it before,

586
00:53:56,446 --> 00:53:57,777
but you're gonna love it.

587
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,783
Thanks for the help.

588
00:54:18,235 --> 00:54:20,829
It says here
we're less than 50 miles out of Texarkana.

589
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:22,895
Shouldn't we have turned north by now?

590
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,507
Jesus, do I have to do everything?

591
00:54:26,577 --> 00:54:28,169
Let me see that. Where exactly...

592
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:52,628
Damn it!

593
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,832
What the hell's the matter with you?
You almost got us killed!

594
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,538
I nearly got us killed?
You're the one who can't freaking drive!

595
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:04,604
Well, if you could read a map,
none of this would have happened!

596
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:08,173
You nearly drive us into the grill
of an oncoming truck and it's my fault?

597
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:09,309
Look at that shit!

598
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:12,617
-I suppose that's my fault too!
-Well, it sure as hell ain't mine!

599
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,920
I got Bird, you get the spare.

600
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,088
Jesus, Chip!

601
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,929
And don't get lost.

602
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:17,078
You ain't from around here, are you?

603
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:21,885
I know you ain't from around here.
I know everyone from around here.

604
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,790
Come on, let's go dance one, huh?
What do you say?

605
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:27,420
It's my new favorite song.

606
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,158
Sure. Let's dance one.

607
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:33,600
Well, all right.

608
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:46,014
You sure know how to move.

609
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:52,844
Yeah!

610
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:07,300
You smell good. Good.

611
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:13,736
Come here.

612
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,211
Stop it.

613
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,181
Come here. You know you want it.

614
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,379
-You love this.
-I said stop it!

615
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:24,252
Let her go.

616
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:26,413
What's wrong, girl? You know you want it.

617
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,214
I said let her go.

618
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:31,220
You ain't from around here, are you?

619
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:32,585
So why don't you...

620
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:44,731
Come on!

621
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:53,515
I'm really sorry.

622
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:29,945
Did you get some sleep?

623
00:58:30,787 --> 00:58:33,449
-Yeah. You?
-Yeah.

624
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:48,566
We'd better get going. Bird's waiting.

625
00:59:28,378 --> 00:59:30,039
How'd you get into racing?

626
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,974
My dad.

627
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:35,379
He always found a racetrack
wherever we were stationed

628
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:36,680
so he could play the ponies.

629
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:41,989
I remember the first time
I saw racehorses run.

630
00:59:44,327 --> 00:59:45,988
It's like they had wings.

631
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:50,996
I'd stand at the rail,

632
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:54,603
try to imagine what it felt like to fly like that.

633
00:59:58,408 --> 01:00:01,138
It nearly killed me
when we had to move again.

634
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:05,347
But I swore I'd come back someday.

635
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:07,883
I finally did it a few months ago.

636
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:10,920
That's when I met Mark.
He heard I needed a job and he hired me.

637
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:18,393
I love being around horses.
Especially when I get to ride.

638
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:23,131
For me there's nothing like it.

639
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,059
Yeah, they get in your blood.

640
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,303
That's for sure.

641
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:32,768
What are his chances?

642
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:37,239
Not too good.

643
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:40,440
Then why are you doing this?

644
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:52,427
I have run a lot of horses for a lot of people,

645
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:56,555
and we didn't always come out ahead,
but we paid the bills.

646
01:00:58,335 --> 01:00:59,666
It seemed good enough.

647
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:03,303
And then Bird come along.

648
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:07,104
Boy, he made a dreamer out of me.
Out of all of us.

649
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:13,145
We got a chance
to be a part of something truly great.

650
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,941
To be the best there is.

651
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:19,787
Maybe we'll look stupid to some,

652
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:24,626
but life ain't worth much
if all you do is play it safe.

653
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:29,129
It's about being out there,

654
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,727
taking chances.

655
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:38,267
Well,

656
01:01:39,376 --> 01:01:42,641
at least we'll know we tried.
We gave it everything we got.

657
01:01:55,925 --> 01:01:57,415
You ready to go, Bird?

658
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:00,963
I think that's a yes.

659
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:28,246
You must be the guys from New Mexico.

660
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:31,259
-Wondered when you were gonna get here.
-Yeah, so did we.

661
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:35,361
Well, not many folks
drive their Derby horses cross country.

662
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:40,327
-Mind if I have a look?
-Be my guest.

663
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:52,911
Not much to him, huh?

664
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:57,586
-Looks can be deceiving.
-You got that right.

665
01:02:58,054 --> 01:03:00,579
Well, good luck to you

666
01:03:00,657 --> 01:03:02,181
and welcome to Churchill Downs.

667
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:04,019
Thank you.

668
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:58,274
That's Join in the Dance.
He'll have a lot of speed.

669
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:01,444
Big time basketball player owns him.

670
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:04,945
That's Baffert and his wife
with Pioneer of the Nile.

671
01:04:06,022 --> 01:04:10,220
Won four graded stakes in a row.
Been working real good.

672
01:04:11,928 --> 01:04:13,088
Who's that?

673
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:18,067
That there's Jeff Mullins. He trains
I Want Revenge, the favorite right now.

674
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:21,466
Joe Talamo's riding him in his first Derby.

675
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:24,835
A billionaire from England owns that one.

676
01:04:24,908 --> 01:04:26,375
Dunkirk.

677
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:29,068
They paid almost $4 million for him.

678
01:04:30,313 --> 01:04:34,215
Some sheik's horse is next to us.
Regal Ransom.

679
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:40,247
And here we are.
This is your new home, Bird.

680
01:04:58,274 --> 01:04:59,639
Good boy.

681
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,687
Who took my razor?

682
01:05:29,706 --> 01:05:31,230
Hey, Jerry, what's up?

683
01:05:31,307 --> 01:05:32,740
-Good news, Calvin.
-What's that?

684
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,073
You're gonna ride Beethoven
in the Kentucky Derby.

685
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:36,202
-Serious?
-Yeah.

686
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:37,610
Thank you very much. Good job.

687
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,204
Guys, I got my Derby horse!

688
01:05:39,282 --> 01:05:40,681
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, John.

689
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,547
Appreciate it very much, man.

690
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:44,246
I appreciate it, Fabio.

691
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,447
Thank you, my man, appreciate it very much.

692
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:47,819
-Thank you for that, buddy.
-Well done, Calvin.

693
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:04,468
Pam!

694
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:07,804
It'll go with the dress you found.

695
01:06:07,877 --> 01:06:10,175
-Gosh, that's cute.
-That is really good.

696
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:13,272
-It's cute, right, Daddy?
-It's cute.

697
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:15,681
-That's so cute.
-Okay.

698
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:18,377
Mom, look.

699
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:23,083
This is exactly what we need.

700
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:29,987
-Mom.
-These will do.

701
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:33,433
We'll paint 'em,
we'll glue on some feathers and flowers.

702
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:35,198
We'll add a little ribbon.

703
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:36,602
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

704
01:06:41,044 --> 01:06:42,102
Perfect!

705
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:09,437
-Who is it?
-It's your mother!

706
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:23,514
Here, that's for you.

707
01:07:26,122 --> 01:07:27,521
That's Secretariat.

708
01:07:29,692 --> 01:07:30,784
Yeah.

709
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:34,654
It's about time y'all got here.

710
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:36,824
Well, we had a little more fun
than we thought we would.

711
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:39,390
Yeah, I can see that.

712
01:07:39,469 --> 01:07:42,802
-How'd Bird make the trip?
-Good. Yeah, he looks real good.

713
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:45,531
It's better than we can say for you.

714
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:48,270
Yeah, well, that was a bit of an adventure.

715
01:07:49,645 --> 01:07:51,010
So, what's up tomorrow?

716
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:55,240
Bird's working an easy half-mile.
Nothing too much.

717
01:07:56,052 --> 01:07:57,041
Good.

718
01:07:58,154 --> 01:08:00,349
Good. Put your boot on.

719
01:08:01,524 --> 01:08:02,957
We're going out.

720
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:03,516
Bird looks good.

721
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:06,252
Both of 'em.

722
01:09:15,998 --> 01:09:17,090
Morning.

723
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:21,661
Who the hell is that?

724
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:24,169
I Want Revenge.

725
01:09:36,586 --> 01:09:37,678
Hello?

726
01:09:37,753 --> 01:09:40,313
<i>You know</i>
<i>that Derby mount I got you, Beethoven.</i>

727
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:41,378
Yeah.

728
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:44,449
<i>Well, he's got a bad tendon. He's out.</i>

729
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:55,997
-Hey, Jerry, what you got?
<i>-Hey, Calvin.</i>

730
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:58,905
<i>There Goes JoJo pulled up lame</i>
<i>after the Blue Grass.</i>

731
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:02,467
<i>It's just a bit of bad luck, but don't worry.</i>
<i>We'll find you another horse.</i>

732
01:10:02,545 --> 01:10:03,534
Jerry.

733
01:10:05,815 --> 01:10:06,975
<i>Calvin?</i>

734
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:11,512
Hey, Jerry.

735
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:14,317
<i>What can I say, Calvin. Flat Out's out.</i>

736
01:10:17,827 --> 01:10:21,593
<i>Calvin, I'm afraid they went with another jock</i>
<i>on Musket Man</i>

737
01:10:21,664 --> 01:10:23,689
<i>but there's a filly that might qualify.</i>

738
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:25,529
<i>They'll need a rider.</i>

739
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:26,761
<i>Calvin, you there?</i>

740
01:10:30,106 --> 01:10:33,405
Well, I still like Chantal.

741
01:10:33,476 --> 01:10:35,808
She won three times on Bird,

742
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:38,674
knows the horse better than anybody.

743
01:10:38,748 --> 01:10:41,740
I think we need a jockey
with Derby experience.

744
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:43,944
Someone who knows
how to get through traffic.

745
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,956
Espinoza won on War Emblem.
Borel won on Street Sense.

746
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,781
I'd take either one of them.

747
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:53,826
I guess it's up to me.

748
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,997
-Calvin Borel.
-Why?

749
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:03,270
'Cause he's got a winning smile.

750
01:11:10,846 --> 01:11:13,474
Lord, Jerry! Not no more bad news, man.

751
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:16,313
-Easy, Calvin. Easy.
-You're gonna give me a heart attack.

752
01:11:16,385 --> 01:11:17,477
Hi, guys.

753
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:21,921
The cowboys called
and they don't have a rider.

754
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:24,686
Catch is they'll be the longest shot
on the board.

755
01:11:24,794 --> 01:11:26,819
They're pretty much a joke around here.

756
01:11:26,896 --> 01:11:29,729
Everybody likes to laugh at cowboys
except cowboys.

757
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:33,391
-So what do you think?
-I think we outta time.

758
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:37,363
Let me talk to them and I'll let you know.

759
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,668
Okay.

760
01:11:45,648 --> 01:11:47,980
-Chip Woolley?
-Yeah.

761
01:11:48,584 --> 01:11:50,142
I heard you need a rider.

762
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,415
I heard you need a horse.

763
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:55,514
Well, it's nice to meet you, Calvin.

764
01:12:00,096 --> 01:12:02,360
-That him?
-Yeah.

765
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,335
Well, he's got a big stride.

766
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:10,171
And an even bigger heart.

767
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:17,879
-Well, he finished up nice.
-No, he's bred to run all day.

768
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:25,918
You ready to take on these blue bloods?

769
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:27,512
I'm ready if you are.

770
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:32,391
You can't win it if you ain't in it.
You got yourself a jock.

771
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:40,629
Hey, bud.

772
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,269
Shit!

773
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:54,750
You seen my horse?

774
01:12:59,955 --> 01:13:02,480
Charlie! Alex!

775
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:18,104
-You okay?
-Yeah.

776
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:23,842
-You two should have met by now.
-Hi!

777
01:13:25,147 --> 01:13:28,844
Good morning and welcome to
Churchill Downs and the post position draw

778
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:31,785
for the 135th running of the Kentucky Derby.

779
01:13:31,854 --> 01:13:35,255
Now, you will each have one minute
to make your post selection

780
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:37,053
once your horse's name is drawn.

781
01:13:37,126 --> 01:13:38,491
Good luck, everybody.

782
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,594
And now our first choice goes to

783
01:13:46,502 --> 01:13:47,491
Join in the Dance.

784
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:49,865
Great.

785
01:13:49,939 --> 01:13:51,770
You're on the clock, gentlemen.

786
01:13:56,612 --> 01:14:00,514
Number 9, post position Number 9
for Join in the Dance.

787
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,017
Next up we have

788
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:11,458
Regal Ransom. Regal Ransom.

789
01:14:23,739 --> 01:14:26,435
Number 10, post Number 10
for Regal Ransom.

790
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:28,306
It'll be good for Bird.

791
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:32,108
And our next horse is Pioneer of the Nile.

792
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:33,478
Let's do it, huh?

793
01:14:41,524 --> 01:14:45,722
Number 16, post position Number 16
for Pioneer of the Nile.

794
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:48,229
And the next horse in the selection is

795
01:14:51,233 --> 01:14:53,667
-Mine That Bird.
-All right!

796
01:14:55,337 --> 01:14:56,827
Watch out, watch out, Brazil.

797
01:14:57,673 --> 01:14:59,868
You all right? It's the leg.

798
01:14:59,942 --> 01:15:01,273
-Let me get my hat.
-Watch the leg.

799
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:10,443
-You got it?
-Yeah.

800
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:12,646
Son.

801
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:16,658
Gentlemen, you have 30 seconds
to make your selection

802
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:19,455
or you'll have to go to the back of the draw.

803
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:26,699
Number 8, post position Number 8
for Mine That Bird.

804
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:28,734
Good job, partner.

805
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:34,176
-Eight.
-What a bunch of yahoos.

806
01:15:36,478 --> 01:15:40,141
And our next horse
in the selection belongs to...

807
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,854
They don't like us in the form too much.

808
01:15:47,356 --> 01:15:49,551
Yeah, well, what'd ya expect?

809
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:52,924
We're 50-to-1.

810
01:15:54,663 --> 01:15:58,497
Says here we're winless in America

811
01:15:59,435 --> 01:16:01,960
and have the lowest speed rating by far.

812
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:03,835
They ain't wrong.

813
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,608
-Says here that...
-Doc.

814
01:16:07,509 --> 01:16:09,909
-Put it away.
-Okay. Yup.

815
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:11,276
We're doing good.

816
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:14,282
All right. We got post position 8,
that's Joanne's lucky number.

817
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:16,045
Calvin's riding for us.

818
01:16:17,519 --> 01:16:21,353
You're right. We done all we could.

819
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:29,890
Hey. Ben Huffman was looking for you.

820
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,562
You get your racing licenses?
You can't run Bird tomorrow without 'em.

821
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:36,596
Man, I... Doc, you got yours?

822
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:37,661
You?

823
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:40,965
I don't even have a driver's license.

824
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:44,672
I hate to tell you this,
but the racing office is closed.

825
01:16:44,747 --> 01:16:45,839
Shit!

826
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:48,648
Let's go, Doc. We gotta...

827
01:16:50,519 --> 01:16:53,716
You guys are gonna
give New Mexico a bad name!

828
01:17:09,705 --> 01:17:10,933
I can't believe it!

829
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:13,975
We come this far,
forget to get our dang licenses!

830
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:17,936
Where you going now?

831
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:21,582
Somebody's gotta still be here.

832
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:34,554
Doc, come here. Come up here.

833
01:17:37,132 --> 01:17:38,429
Give me a boost.

834
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:43,571
What happened to throwing pebbles
against the glass?

835
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:47,034
Come on!

836
01:17:47,509 --> 01:17:49,500
Stand... Christ, be still!

837
01:17:49,578 --> 01:17:51,136
-I'm standing.
-A little higher.

838
01:17:52,648 --> 01:17:53,740
Up.

839
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:57,815
I think somebody's in there.

840
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:01,045
All right. Okay. You gotta get me up higher.

841
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:09,826
Dang it, Doc, hold still!

842
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:15,963
Hey!

843
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:28,748
You know, gentlemen,
it doesn't have to be this difficult.

844
01:18:29,318 --> 01:18:30,649
Shall I get the door for you?

845
01:18:31,553 --> 01:18:32,918
Yeah!

846
01:18:32,988 --> 01:18:34,649
That'd be great.

847
01:18:58,347 --> 01:19:01,783
-You sure clean up good.
-Thanks.

848
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:04,952
With any luck I won't fall in these shoes.

849
01:19:07,056 --> 01:19:08,080
Howdy.

850
01:19:08,157 --> 01:19:10,523
I'm sorry, but this is a private party.

851
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,021
Ain't this for the Derby?

852
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:16,056
It's a private party, sir.

853
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,599
We're the owners of Mine That Bird.

854
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,826
Who?

855
01:19:19,902 --> 01:19:22,894
Mine That Bird. He's running in the Derby.

856
01:19:24,339 --> 01:19:26,637
Good evening, Mr. Baffert, Mrs. Baffert.

857
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,539
-Good evening.
-It's so good to see you again.

858
01:19:29,011 --> 01:19:30,774
-Have a good night.
-Thank you.

859
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:31,835
Go right in.

860
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:36,110
Looks like you cowboys
should have left your hats at home.

861
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:40,284
Your names, please?

862
01:19:40,355 --> 01:19:44,792
Doctor Leonard Blach and family.

863
01:19:45,594 --> 01:19:48,085
-Mark Allen...
-I found you.

864
01:19:48,564 --> 01:19:51,533
-Party of nine?
-Exactly.

865
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:58,271
-Welcome to the Derby Ball.
-Thank you.

866
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,965
-Doc.
-Joanne.

867
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:35,374
-Look! They even got our names set out.
-That's nice.

868
01:20:35,444 --> 01:20:37,810
-Enjoy your evening.
-Thank you.

869
01:20:43,952 --> 01:20:45,510
I guess I ain't supposed to be here.

870
01:20:47,156 --> 01:20:48,316
Wait a minute.

871
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:51,386
Probably just a little mistake.
We'll get it fixed up. Excuse me!

872
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,792
It's okay. I'll just see you back at the hotel.

873
01:20:53,862 --> 01:20:56,194
No, no, no. You're staying for dinner.

874
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:02,364
Here.

875
01:21:07,976 --> 01:21:11,605
I wouldn't do that if I were you, buddy.
He kind of likes jail.

876
01:21:17,286 --> 01:21:18,878
-That's you.
-Thank you.

877
01:21:18,954 --> 01:21:22,583
Bob, what do you think
about Calvin Borel riding for the cowboys?

878
01:21:24,526 --> 01:21:26,187
You mean Calvin Bo-rail?

879
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:28,729
Nah, I'm not worried about Boo.

880
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:31,698
Frankly, I wouldn't be worried
if they had God riding for them.

881
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:34,099
Everybody knows
that horse doesn't belong here.

882
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:37,798
Now, I'm sure
they'll start out shouting, "Go, Boo."

883
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:40,933
By the end of the race, I assure you

884
01:21:41,009 --> 01:21:44,001
they'll be crying, "Boo-hoo-hoo."

885
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:22,974
If I could have everyone's attention
for a moment.

886
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:26,817
As we have only hours
before the greatest race in the world,

887
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:29,914
I want to wish you all the best of luck.

888
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:38,029
Tomorrow a new stallion will be stamped
King of Kentucky.

889
01:22:43,272 --> 01:22:47,732
Being an owner myself, I want to toast
not only the thoroughbreds we breed,

890
01:22:47,809 --> 01:22:50,778
but also the thoroughbreds we are.

891
01:22:54,449 --> 01:22:56,883
I'm gonna head out, get some sleep.

892
01:22:56,952 --> 01:22:58,442
You bet.

893
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,717
See you in the morning, bright and early.

894
01:23:03,258 --> 01:23:08,321
The Kentucky Derby has been run every year
since its inception in 1875,

895
01:23:08,397 --> 01:23:12,663
making it the longest consecutively
run horse race in history.

896
01:23:12,734 --> 01:23:16,101
Now, several thousand people
attended that first year.

897
01:23:16,171 --> 01:23:19,538
But this year we anticipate

898
01:23:19,641 --> 01:23:23,634
a crowd of more than 150,000!

899
01:23:28,617 --> 01:23:30,847
We have owners
from all over the world here tonight.

900
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:34,912
Ireland, Dubai, France, England.

901
01:23:35,424 --> 01:23:37,892
Even New Mexico!

902
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:53,405
-Good evening, Mr. Woolley.
-Evenin'.

903
01:23:53,475 --> 01:23:56,672
Charlie's on a coffee run
and Bird's been asking for you.

904
01:23:57,346 --> 01:23:58,813
Need anything?

905
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,644
Nah, I'm good. Thank you.

906
01:24:07,022 --> 01:24:10,583
Hey. How you doing, buddy?

907
01:24:13,628 --> 01:24:16,461
I want to thank you

908
01:24:16,531 --> 01:24:19,967
for taking us
to the biggest dance in the world, Bird.

909
01:24:22,571 --> 01:24:27,167
I never thought in a million years
I'd ever be here.

910
01:24:33,749 --> 01:24:35,842
Don't you worry about tomorrow.

911
01:24:36,852 --> 01:24:38,843
You just run your race.

912
01:24:41,022 --> 01:24:45,584
And you show 'em how big a heart you got.
All right?

913
01:26:02,838 --> 01:26:05,466
-What the hell?
-Wake up, sunshine.

914
01:26:06,975 --> 01:26:08,340
It's showtime.

915
01:26:38,306 --> 01:26:41,104
-Yup, Rachael Rice designed it.
-I don't wear suits anymore.

916
01:26:41,176 --> 01:26:42,165
I don't know if you can see me under here.

917
01:27:09,371 --> 01:27:12,340
Gotcha. I'll tell him.

918
01:27:23,818 --> 01:27:25,012
Hey, guys.

919
01:27:26,388 --> 01:27:28,049
There's been a scratch in the Derby.

920
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:33,992
I Want Revenge is out.

921
01:27:44,539 --> 01:27:47,337
Sorry about that, buddy.
You'll get them next year, all right?

922
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:49,036
Don't worry about it.

923
01:27:54,549 --> 01:27:57,916
Looks good. Sam, could you put your hand
on your hips like Joe's doing?

924
01:28:02,724 --> 01:28:06,057
As is Godolphin Racing
all the way from Dubai with two horses.

925
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:08,322
Regal Ransom, Desert Party,

926
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:11,126
Sheik Mohammed Al Maktoum's trainer
Saeed Bin Suroor.

927
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,134
Saeed, you guys have won just about
everything there is to win in racing

928
01:28:14,202 --> 01:28:17,035
except the Derby.
What do you make of your chances today?

929
01:28:17,105 --> 01:28:19,972
Both horses had a good flight
over and are training well.

930
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:22,236
We wouldn't have come this far
if we did not expect to win.

931
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,334
Best of luck, gentlemen.

932
01:28:25,413 --> 01:28:29,008
Trainer Chip Woolley, you shattered your leg
less than five weeks ago,

933
01:28:29,084 --> 01:28:32,815
and here you are making this long walk
over with your gelding Mine That Bird.

934
01:28:32,887 --> 01:28:37,688
Everyone in racing wants to make this walk
even on one leg.

935
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:40,125
Feeling here's unlike none other.

936
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:43,164
Here? You realize this is the Kentucky Derby

937
01:28:43,231 --> 01:28:46,792
and you guys are looking like you're ready
for the shoot-out at the O.K. Corral.

938
01:28:46,868 --> 01:28:49,860
-Yeah, we're ready for anything.
-Y'all get 'em, Chip.

939
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:55,976
There's Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert.
Three time Derby winning trainer Bob Baffert.

940
01:28:56,044 --> 01:28:58,877
We know how excited you've been all week
about your colt,

941
01:28:58,947 --> 01:29:01,677
Pioneer of the Nile, in this Derby. Why?

942
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:05,413
Well, I haven't had
a legitimate Derby horse in years.

943
01:29:05,487 --> 01:29:08,923
This guy's already won over
a million dollars, he's training beautifully.

944
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:12,084
Bob, competition-wise,
who do you fear the most?

945
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,754
Well, I'm worried about all of them.

946
01:29:15,363 --> 01:29:18,332
Well, maybe not the cowboys.

947
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,731
Best of luck, Bob.

948
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:55,224
I know.

949
01:29:57,472 --> 01:29:59,463
We made them ourselves.

950
01:30:09,784 --> 01:30:12,048
Hey, how you all doing? All right?

951
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,145
-Hi. Good luck.
-It's all right? Good, good.

952
01:30:14,222 --> 01:30:17,282
-Hey, man, we're happy to have you.
-Thank you. I appreciate it very much.

953
01:30:17,358 --> 01:30:20,293
-Thank you so much.
-How you all doing? Good to meet you.

954
01:30:20,361 --> 01:30:23,353
-Thank you. Good luck.
-Thank you, I appreciate it very much.

955
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:26,963
-I'll try to get the job done, okay?
-All right.

956
01:30:27,869 --> 01:30:30,929
-How you doing, sir? Things all right?
-Good, Calvin.

957
01:30:31,005 --> 01:30:32,097
-You all right?
-Hey.

958
01:30:32,173 --> 01:30:34,198
-Chip. How's everything?
-Good.

959
01:30:35,543 --> 01:30:39,343
There's plenty of speed in here.
So don't worry if we're a little ways back.

960
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:42,508
Just get a clean break
and keep him covered up.

961
01:30:42,584 --> 01:30:45,849
Once he sees daylight, he's gone.

962
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,080
You got it.

963
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:54,420
All right, guys, let's get lucky.

964
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:03,330
Hell. There he goes.

965
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:08,502
Hey, y'all, listen up.

966
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,980
I want to thank y'all for all ya done.

967
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:21,712
Bird couldn't have had a better team.

968
01:31:24,592 --> 01:31:27,117
No matter what happens out there

969
01:31:27,195 --> 01:31:30,187
I'm just glad we're here together.

970
01:31:37,405 --> 01:31:39,373
This is the best day of my life

971
01:31:42,911 --> 01:31:44,606
and I won't forget it.

972
01:31:48,316 --> 01:31:50,375
We done all we can,

973
01:31:50,451 --> 01:31:52,885
so what do you say
we go have us a great time?

974
01:31:54,622 --> 01:31:56,852
Get in there. Come on! Come on!

975
01:32:00,495 --> 01:32:07,424
<i>The sun shines bright</i>
<i>on my old Kentucky home</i>

976
01:32:07,735 --> 01:32:12,729
<i>'Tis summer, the people are gay</i>

977
01:32:15,777 --> 01:32:20,339
<i>By and by, hard times come</i>

978
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:23,578
<i>A-knocking at the door</i>

979
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:29,647
<i>Then my old Kentucky home, good night</i>

980
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:38,094
<i>For the Old Kentucky Home far away</i>

981
01:32:45,106 --> 01:32:49,805
We're just moments away from
the 135th running of the Kentucky Derby.

982
01:32:49,878 --> 01:32:52,278
Friesan Fire, the favorite at 7-to-2.

983
01:32:52,347 --> 01:32:54,144
Dunkirk, second choice at 5-to-1

984
01:32:54,215 --> 01:32:58,049
and Bob Baffert's Pioneer of the Nile,
third choice at 6-to-1.

985
01:32:58,353 --> 01:33:01,288
Now, some of the biggest long shots
on the tote board.

986
01:33:01,356 --> 01:33:03,551
Atomic Rain, Join in the Dance

987
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:06,753
and at 50-to-1, Mine That Bird.

988
01:33:11,566 --> 01:33:12,760
Hey, Bill.

989
01:33:14,702 --> 01:33:16,602
I bet you Bird don't finish in the top ten.

990
01:33:19,173 --> 01:33:20,299
How much you got?

991
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:24,072
Twenty bucks.

992
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,379
I'll take that bet.

993
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:31,975
Anyone else think
he won't finish in the top ten?

994
01:33:33,721 --> 01:33:35,586
Put your money right here!

995
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:37,648
-I'm in.
-I'll take it.

996
01:33:38,259 --> 01:33:40,250
There you go. All right.

997
01:33:40,561 --> 01:33:43,860
-That's it. Yeah.
-Double down on that. Double down.

998
01:33:43,932 --> 01:33:46,230
Yeah, ladies. Thank you.

999
01:33:46,901 --> 01:33:49,563
Yeah. Look at that.

1000
01:33:57,178 --> 01:33:59,908
-Hey, Alex?
-Yeah?

1001
01:34:01,382 --> 01:34:04,408
I was wondering.

1002
01:34:04,485 --> 01:34:06,282
Wondering what, Chip? They're about to go.

1003
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:08,185
No, I know.

1004
01:34:08,256 --> 01:34:09,917
I was wondering if...

1005
01:34:13,461 --> 01:34:16,430
If maybe you might consider
riding for me sometime.

1006
01:34:18,366 --> 01:34:19,765
Like in a race?

1007
01:34:21,069 --> 01:34:22,559
I could use a good jockey.

1008
01:34:24,038 --> 01:34:25,198
Oh, my God.

1009
01:34:26,641 --> 01:34:28,438
Oh, my God.

1010
01:34:31,913 --> 01:34:33,244
Thank you.

1011
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:38,218
-Thank you so much.
-Okay, okay.

1012
01:34:50,131 --> 01:34:52,531
All right, number 12.
He's an easy loader, guys.

1013
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:55,067
Come on, boys.
Now, 14's up, let's bring him in.

1014
01:35:14,689 --> 01:35:16,156
Please, God,

1015
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:20,319
just don't let him be last.

1016
01:35:27,969 --> 01:35:30,233
-How many now, Bob? Two out?
-Two left.

1017
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:36,700
Come on, Bird. Come on.

1018
01:35:48,756 --> 01:35:50,280
<i>They're in the gate.</i>

1019
01:35:50,992 --> 01:35:54,723
<i>And they're off in the Kentucky Derby!</i>

1020
01:35:57,665 --> 01:36:00,133
<i>And it's Join in the Dance racing for the lead.</i>

1021
01:36:00,201 --> 01:36:01,964
<i>Musket Man has some early speed</i>
<i>on the inside.</i>

1022
01:36:02,036 --> 01:36:04,095
<i>Here's Regal Ransom</i>
<i>with some speed as well.</i>

1023
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,130
We got mugged.

1024
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:09,142
What the hell was that? Did you see that?

1025
01:36:09,911 --> 01:36:11,776
<i>Beneath the Twin Spires for the first time,</i>

1026
01:36:11,846 --> 01:36:14,576
<i>Regal Ransom and Join in the Dance</i>
<i>will vie for the early lead.</i>

1027
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:16,139
<i>Pioneer of the Nile is right up there.</i>

1028
01:36:16,217 --> 01:36:17,912
He got run over.

1029
01:36:17,985 --> 01:36:20,579
<i>And that's Papa Clem down</i>
<i>toward the inside. He's now fourth.</i>

1030
01:36:20,655 --> 01:36:23,818
<i>Desert Party forwardly placed,</i>
<i>fifth on the outside.</i>

1031
01:36:24,525 --> 01:36:27,119
<i>One mile remaining here in</i>
<i>the Run for the Roses,</i>

1032
01:36:27,195 --> 01:36:29,390
<i>and the two long shot leaders remain.</i>

1033
01:36:31,332 --> 01:36:34,665
Flying Private is sixth, Friesan Fire in
and among horses is now seventh.

1034
01:36:34,735 --> 01:36:38,728
Musket Man is eighth,
Dunkirk is ninth on the outside.

1035
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:41,299
He's last.

1036
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:44,936
<i>Then farther back down on the rail,</i>
<i>that is Atomic Rain</i>

1037
01:36:45,012 --> 01:36:47,480
<i>running in the eleventh position,</i>
<i>two lengths back.</i>

1038
01:36:47,548 --> 01:36:49,015
<i>And General Quarters is now twelfth.</i>

1039
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:51,551
<i>Nowhere to Hide is thirteenth on the outside.</i>

1040
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:54,747
<i>And 1 lengths behind the rest of the field</i>
<i>is Mine That Bird.</i>

1041
01:37:00,428 --> 01:37:03,295
<i>West Side Bernie is now</i>
<i>down toward the rail.</i>

1042
01:37:03,364 --> 01:37:05,525
<i>And then on the outside</i>
<i>at the back of the pack</i>

1043
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,467
<i>beginning to move up now is Hold Me Back.</i>

1044
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:10,766
<i>Advice is also back there</i>
<i>toward the back of the pack</i>

1045
01:37:10,838 --> 01:37:13,932
<i>along with Chocolate Candy,</i>
<i>Summer Bird, Advice,</i>

1046
01:37:14,008 --> 01:37:16,238
<i>and the last of them all is Mr. Hot Stuff.</i>

1047
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:19,802
<i>So, down the backstretch run,</i>
<i>well behind the rest of them,</i>

1048
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:22,042
<i>is Mine That Bird.</i>

1049
01:37:22,116 --> 01:37:25,108
Looks like we're going the wrong way.

1050
01:37:30,091 --> 01:37:33,618
<i>So down the backstretch run,</i>
<i>and Join in the Dance,</i>

1051
01:37:33,694 --> 01:37:35,559
<i>an impudent long-shot leader here,</i>

1052
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:40,260
<i>taking the field through an opening half-mile</i>
<i>that was strong, 47 and one-fifth seconds.</i>

1053
01:37:42,503 --> 01:37:43,970
He's 30 lengths back.

1054
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:46,506
Maybe it's the mud.

1055
01:37:46,574 --> 01:37:48,007
<i>On the outside, Pioneer of the Nile.</i>

1056
01:37:48,075 --> 01:37:50,566
<i>Now, Garrett Gomez asking him</i>
<i>for a bit more. He's right there.</i>

1057
01:37:50,645 --> 01:37:54,172
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby!

1058
01:37:55,349 --> 01:37:57,909
<i>Papa Clem threads his way through horses,</i>
<i>from sixth.</i>

1059
01:37:57,985 --> 01:37:59,850
<i>Now Musket Man is now seventh.</i>

1060
01:37:59,921 --> 01:38:04,381
<i>Chocolate Candy is beginning to come alive</i>
<i>now and he's eighth on the outside.</i>

1061
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:06,392
All right, little Bird man, let's go.

1062
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:11,061
Look at this.
We might actually beat someone.

1063
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:14,591
<i>Behind the far turn,</i>
<i>Join in the Dance a narrow lead.</i>

1064
01:38:14,669 --> 01:38:18,435
<i>Regal Ransom is pressing hard</i>
<i>and there goes Pioneer of the Nile.</i>

1065
01:38:18,506 --> 01:38:21,703
<i>Pioneer of the Nile</i>
<i>is making his advance in the...</i>

1066
01:38:21,776 --> 01:38:23,903
Eighth or ninth would be all right.

1067
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:31,408
Mine That Bird!

1068
01:38:32,453 --> 01:38:34,444
Mine That Bird, he's coming up the rail!

1069
01:38:34,522 --> 01:38:37,355
-Where'd he go? I lost him.
-He can't get through.

1070
01:38:37,458 --> 01:38:41,121
<i>Then down toward the rail, it's Advice,</i>
<i>as the field turns for home.</i>

1071
01:38:41,195 --> 01:38:44,824
<i>Top of the stretch, it's still</i>
<i>Join in the Dance with a tenuous lead.</i>

1072
01:38:44,899 --> 01:38:50,496
<i>Regal Ransom and Pioneer of the Nile strike</i>
<i>the front, just outside the eighth pole.</i>

1073
01:38:50,571 --> 01:38:53,404
Fourth. Fourth would be good.

1074
01:38:53,474 --> 01:38:54,998
Mine That Bird!

1075
01:39:08,789 --> 01:39:10,757
-He's in the lead! He's in the lead!
-What? Where?

1076
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:14,989
Coming on through, that is Mine That Bird
now who's coming on to take the lead

1077
01:39:15,096 --> 01:39:16,893
<i>as they come down to the finish!</i>

1078
01:39:19,767 --> 01:39:22,827
<i>Calvin Borel in the saddle,</i>
<i>saluting the crowd!</i>

1079
01:39:22,903 --> 01:39:25,303
Let him roll, Calvin! Let him roll! Let him roll!

1080
01:39:25,373 --> 01:39:26,465
No!

1081
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:27,973
<i>...a hundred and twenty thousand.</i>

1082
01:39:28,042 --> 01:39:31,102
<i>Long, impossible long shot!</i>

1083
01:39:31,178 --> 01:39:35,547
<i>Mine That Bird going on to win</i>
<i>the Kentucky Derby</i>

1084
01:39:35,616 --> 01:39:39,313
<i>in a spectacular, spectacular upset.</i>

1085
01:39:39,687 --> 01:39:44,420
Mine That Bird has won the Kentucky Derby.
An impossible result here!

1086
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:48,185
God! Praise God! Oh, my gosh!

1087
01:39:48,596 --> 01:39:51,622
We just won this son-of-a-bitch!
Oh, my gosh!

1088
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:04,372
Let's go, let's go.

1089
01:40:35,109 --> 01:40:36,406
-How do we get down there?
-I don't know.

1090
01:40:36,477 --> 01:40:38,035
How do we get to the winner's circle?

1091
01:40:38,112 --> 01:40:39,739
I think it's down here.

1092
01:40:42,183 --> 01:40:43,616
You just said I love you to whom?

1093
01:40:43,684 --> 01:40:46,551
-My momma and daddy.
-Who are no longer with us.

1094
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,919
I wish they were here. Oh, Lord.

1095
01:40:51,292 --> 01:40:54,591
If they'd only be here
to see what I accomplished in my life.

1096
01:40:55,796 --> 01:40:57,423
Let's go, let's go!

1097
01:41:00,901 --> 01:41:05,770
Bob, can you share your thoughts
about what you saw out there today?

1098
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,331
Well, Calvin is amazing.

1099
01:41:08,809 --> 01:41:11,972
He's always been a great rider
and he did it again.

1100
01:41:12,747 --> 01:41:15,716
He took to the rail, found a hole
and squeezed through it.

1101
01:41:15,783 --> 01:41:18,877
I guess that's why
they call him Calvin Bo-Rail.

1102
01:41:20,721 --> 01:41:22,450
The cowboys win today.

1103
01:41:25,526 --> 01:41:27,016
50-to-1!

1104
01:41:35,002 --> 01:41:38,028
I found them, found my tickets. I got 'em!

1105
01:41:38,105 --> 01:41:39,732
You did it, cuz.

1106
01:41:55,923 --> 01:41:59,586
-You are the man!
-You did it, man. You did it.

1107
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:01,355
What a ride, huh? You're the best!

1108
01:42:01,429 --> 01:42:03,488
-Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
-You're the best. Come on.

1109
01:42:04,665 --> 01:42:06,326
Thank you!

1110
01:42:20,381 --> 01:42:21,905
Yeah!

1111
01:42:29,924 --> 01:42:33,690
I just want you to know
how grateful I am for all you've done.

1112
01:42:33,761 --> 01:42:36,958
And I'm proud to be standing here
in the winner's circle with you.

1113
01:42:39,033 --> 01:42:40,864
Thanks for having me.

1114
01:42:43,804 --> 01:42:45,032
Aw, man.

1115
01:42:50,211 --> 01:42:51,974
Who would have thought?

1116
01:42:52,146 --> 01:42:54,706
I knew you had my back. You always did.

1117
01:42:55,683 --> 01:42:57,116
Always will.

1118
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:00,653
We're in the history books now.

1119
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:05,824
Okay, everybody, over here!
Look over here, guys.

1120
01:43:05,893 --> 01:43:07,053
All right, great.

1121
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,032
Thank you, Bird.

1122
01:43:45,633 --> 01:43:48,397
Now, it's a story
that even Hollywood wouldn't believe,

1123
01:43:48,469 --> 01:43:50,767
but obviously you had a pretty good idea.

1124
01:43:50,838 --> 01:43:54,934
Yeah, it's wonderful. I haven't...
I just can't say enough, you know.

1125
01:43:55,009 --> 01:43:57,375
A feeling like I've never had before.

1126
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:07,052
We have to give a lot of credit to Borel.
He really pulled us through on that race.

1127
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,953
I'm beyond happy.
I ain't even got no feelings in me right now.

1128
01:44:17,031 --> 01:44:18,293
I'm numb.
