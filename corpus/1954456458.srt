  Ma'am, turn around slowly.

 It's gonna be so much better
     than the city, honey.

23
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:25,030
  You're gonna have sidewalks
to ride your bike on and a yard.

24
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,065
     You're gonna love it.

      You must be Claire.

32
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,576
     Your mommy's told me
       a lot about you,

33
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,679
  so I brought you something
 very special from our office

I'm sorry. She's still not 100%
about this whole moving thing.

36
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,823
 That's all right. She will be
  when she sees her new room.

   Come on. Let's go inside.

38
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,799
         Welcome home.

39
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,174
    What do you think, hmm?
I mean, I know it's not perfect,

40
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,343
 but I think with a little bit
   of work, it'll be great.

41
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,678
   Well, you know, there was
a lot of interest in this house,

42
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,847
          mostly from
   real estate speculators,

43
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,850
        but I felt that
      it needed a family.

44
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,120
         You like it?

45
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,924
  Did something happen here?

46
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,025
             What?

47
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,527
   Well, it's an old house.

48
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,131
  It's got a lot of history,
     but nothing too bad.

49
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,333
        - There you go.
         - Oh, thanks.

00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,103
 Those are for the front door,
the back door, and the garage.

51

      I'm right in town.

      Call me if you need
       anything at all.

53
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,541
        - What is this?
    - That's for the keys.

54
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,210
           Oh, okay.

55
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,413
        You keep that.

         What's what?

            Claire.

62
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,152
Please, Mommy, can I keep her?

63
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,755
But you have so many other dolls
        already, honey.

64
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,992
     But I want this one.

65
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,095
   I think that one probably
   belongs to somebody else.

67
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,203
      Fine, but you have
   to let me wash it first.

68
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,204
           Come on.

69
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,708
  All right, keep unpacking.

70
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,210
             Okay.

71
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,723
Everything's going pretty well.

     super excited, but...

     Yeah. You know what?

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,673
 Thanks so much for helping me
      with that article.

78
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,575
     It's hard to imagine
    there's actually people

79
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,878
who believe this stuff is real.

80
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,581
Sometimes it's easier to rely on
  a supernatural explanation

81
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,483
    rather than confronting
          the truth.

82
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,652
 So what are you gonna do now?

83
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,155
     Well, I'm gonna talk
 to some of the local papers,

84
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,390
    but I really just want
       to take some time

85
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,160
      and work on my book
     and focus on Claire.

    than our old apartment.

00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,533
           - Claire?
      -<i> Everything okay?</i>

89
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,969
 You know what? I'm gonna go.
     I'll call you later?

90
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,438
         Okay, honey.
 Good luck with the unpacking.

91

    in one of these boxes.

to a new school with new kids.

          I'm scared.

     I hope they're nice,
   not mean like some kids.

  What if they don't like me?

00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,000
    What if they don't need
       any new friends?

00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,673
My cats simply adore children.

158
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,474
       Oh, that's great.

159
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,113
So if Claire ever wants to come
  and play with the kitties,

160
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,548
      just send her over.

161
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,317
      They would love it.

162
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,320
   And if you need anything,
         just holler.

163
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,422
      - Okay, thank you.
            - Bye!

164
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,224
    It's nice to meet you.

165
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,131
             Wow.

166
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,874
          Mommy said
   it would be better here,

167
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,809
      that I'd be happy.

168
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,044
         She promised.

       I thought things
      would be different,

170
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,782
  that people would be nicer.

171
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,151
       But they're not.

172
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,387
       They pick on me.

173
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,357
         I hate them.

174
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,393

Thank you for your time, Doctor.

   we act like mean children
       on a schoolyard.

361

  We say things to each other
  that we don't really mean,

362
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:43,233
 and you have to listen to it,
      and it's not fair.

But both of us want you to know
       that we love you

             Okay.

372
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,498
       Because sometimes
  people who love each other

373
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,034
   need a little time apart

374
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,070
  to remember why they loved
each other in the first place.

375

      I'm working on it.

  Why doesn't anyone listen?

  We don't want a new mommy.
We want our mommy to come back

      like it used to be.

    Yes, it is. It's ugly.
       I don't want it.

418
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,761
  It's okay. I'm sure she'll
   open up when she's ready.

419
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,365
 But until then, maybe she can
     play with Sally, huh?

  You pick that up right now.

    she's in a new school,

425
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,826
      and the separation
     between Alyson and me

426

00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,717
    Were you guys serious?

464
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,486
              No.

465
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,288
     She was just a friend
          from work,

466
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,957
      but we've gone out
      a couple of times.

467
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,692
          That's it.

468
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,828
Why don't you come back with us?

469
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,464
       I gotta stay here
   and deal with the police.

470
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,466
          - You sure?
            - Yeah.

471
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,834
   Why don't you and Claire
           go back?

472
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,569
       I don't want you
     anywhere around this.

473
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,406
         Okay. Call us
     if you hear anything.

474
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,175
            Thanks.

475
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,511
        Come on, honey,
   let's go get your stuff.

476
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,661
           [knocks]

477
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,549
           [coughs]

478
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,205
           Oh, God.

479
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:49,318
        [flies buzzing]

480
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,013
          Oh, my God!

481
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,790
 <i> You've reached Ken Stevens.</i>
   <i> Please leave a message.</i>

482
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:31,527
           -<i> [beep]</i>
  - Hi, this is Alyson Simon.

483
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,797
   I was just calling to see
if you had put any more thought

484
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,366
   into the house situation.

485
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,435
Could you give me a call back,
            please?

486
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,605
            [ring]

487
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,954
          Ms. Simon?
       It's Ken Stevens.

488
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,009
          Ms. Simon?

489
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,144
           It's Ken.

490
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,082
 I wanted to come by and clear
the air a little bit, Ms. Simon.

491
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,818
       I thought, uh...

492
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,621
 I thought we could talk about
     the house's history.

493
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,993
            Claire?

494
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,463
      Is that you, honey?

495
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:50,807
            [stab]

496
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,414
         <i> Okay, yeah.</i>
        <i> You know what?</i>

497
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,249
 <i> What do you want me to say?</i>

498
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,552
  <i> You want me to say I made</i>
   <i> a mistake? Fine, I did.</i>

499
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,322
 <i> I made a mistake. You know,</i>
 <i> I didn't call you to argue.</i>

500
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,791
We gotta figure out what we're
 gonna do about our daughter.

501
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:12,628
 The therapy isn't working and
 I don't know what else to do.

502
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,464
When she came over, she had this
 spooky-looking doll with her.

503
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,466
      Yeah, and she won't
    go anywhere without it.

504
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,469
 <i> She happened to mention that</i>
 <i> Kathy brought her a new one?</i>

505
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,471
       What do you mean?

506
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,841
 <i> She brought her a new doll.</i>

507
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,909
<i> I found it underneath her bed</i>
         <i> torn apart.</i>

508
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:30,246
    <i> I'm talking violently.</i>

509
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,181
            -<i> Wow.</i>
  - I know it's just a doll,

510
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,617
  but I can't help but think
it might better if it were gone.

511
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,820
      I'll be right back.

512
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,440
             Lily?

513
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,386
             Lily?

514
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,041
         Where's Lily?

515
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,542
Oh, God, honey, you scared me.

516
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,077
        Where is she?!

517
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,414
            Claire!

518
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,583
         Where is she?

519
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,919
        Come on, honey.
    Claire, it is too late.

520
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,587
       Put it-- Claire!

521
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,791
           - Claire!
        - Where's Lily?

522
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,793
          - Stop it!
- How could you do that to her?

523
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,662
      She was my friend!
        My only friend!

524
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,864
           Stop it!

525
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,268
  She did not belong to you!
 She belonged to someone else.

526
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:36,205
             - Ow.
         - What? What?

527
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,107
          Oh, my God.

528
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:41,444
  Oh, my God. Claire, honey,
      where is this from?

529
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:42,912
     Who did this to you?

530
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,246
         I don't know!

531
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,949
            Claire!

532
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,700
              No!

533
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,223
        - Good morning.
             - Hi.

534
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,930
        Are they real?

535
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,432
        You come on in,
 I'll tell you all about them.

536
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,336
       See you in a bit.

537
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,539
  ELENA: How many of you have
   ever heard the expression

538
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,307
        "giving someone
        the evil eye?"

539
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,310
   One of the best known and
 perhaps the most frightening

540
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:04,079
 Latin American superstitions
     is called Mal de Ojo.

541
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,415
           Ophelia?

542
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:09,552
  The belief is that the evil
  spirit can direct bad luck

543
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,422
or even injury at someone with
nothing more than a simple look.

544
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,425
Children, particularly the ones
    that are not baptized,

545
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,861
    are believed to be more
  susceptible to this curse.

546
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,696
             Next.

547
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,765
Oftentimes in Central America,

548
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,533
  you'll see children wearing
         something red

549
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,703
  or even having a simple red
 thread tied around the wrist

550
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,872
    to ward off Mal de Ojo.

551
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,575
        Lights, please.

552
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,945
Okay, well, finish the readings
on superstition for next time.

553
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,748
          Alyson, hi.

554
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,818
   I'm sorry to hear things
aren't going well with the move.

555
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,720
          - Oh, yeah.
      - Did you bring it?

556
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,189
            I did.

557
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,791
   And it's from Guatemala?

558
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:52,161
           - Tecal.
   - Hmm. It's a worry doll.

559
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,129
 Some people believe that when
 a child has trouble sleeping,

560
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,332
  it's because a large amount
    of stress has built up,

561
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,933
       but a worry doll
 worries in the child's place

562
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,368
  so the child sleeps better.

563
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,669
         Does it work?

564
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,072
Sometimes, but the question is

565
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,374
     does it work because
 the doll has magical powers,

566
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,876
     or because the child
       believes it does?

567
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,946
        Okay, assuming
      that it does work,

568
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:15,384
  and this doll can transfer
the child's worries to itself,

569
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,754
         could it work
     the other way around?

570
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:23,025
I mean, could the doll transfer
    something to the child?

571
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,526
     Look, Alyson, if your
   daughter's having issues,

572
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,794
I'm really not the right person.

573
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,563
 Okay, just look at something.

574
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,498
This happened the other night.

575
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,800
        I picked it up.
I was trying to get rid of it,

576
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:36,105
and now Claire has a bruise in
the exact same place on her arm.

577
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,674
   - It's not a voodoo doll.
      - I know it's not.

578
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,511
But I took this doll that night
   and put it in a Dumpster,

579
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,413
  and the very next morning,
         it was back.

580
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,814
          This doll.

581
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,416
             Yeah.

582
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,853
       Can you help me?

583
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,155
             Yeah.
 If you don't mind leaving it,

584
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,923
I can take a closer look at it
           for you.

585
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,026
        You can keep it
     as long as you like.

586
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,595
 I want this doll as far away
 from my daughter as possible.

587
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,330
             Okay.

588
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,598
            Thanks.

589
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,938
     I want you to realize

590
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:15,511
  that as a professional who
works regularly with children,

591
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,314
    I have a responsibility
         to report...

592
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:22,484
    suspicious behavior...

593
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:26,322
      to the authorities.

594
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:30,859
   What-- What do you mean,
   um, suspicious behavior?

595
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,364
    Tell me about her arm.

596
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:41,337
   Wait a minute. Are you--
  Is that what this is about?

597
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,706
           Are you--

598
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:47,676
      Are you accusing me
    of abusing my daughter?

599
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:51,547
    I'm giving you a chance
        to explain it.

600
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:55,017
        What? Are you--

601
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,119
        Of course not!

602
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,921
        Absolutely not!

603
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,290
  Come sit down for a second.

604
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:11,033
      It's very important
  that you help me understand

605
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,901
      how this happened.

606
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,304
       Understand what?

607
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,806
 She's a kid. Kids play hard.
    Why don't you ask her?

608
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,776
      I did. She told me
     that you grabbed her.

609
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:23,712
    - You lost your temper.
     - I don't believe it.

610
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,614
         That's crazy.

611
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:29,284
     I mean, that's crazy.
 Why would she tell you that?

612
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,120
   Do you lose your temper?

613
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,021
  No, I don't lose my temper!

614
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,656
   You're raising your voice
          right now.

615
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,892
  Yeah, because you're making
    ridiculous accusations!

616
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,262
         You're saying
   I'm abusing my daughter.

617
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,364
        It's difficult
      to be a single mom,

618
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:46,201
  and I can't imagine how much
    stress you must be under.

619
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,870
   Don't you dare make this
          about that.

620
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,842
We'll give this one more chance,
          all right?

621
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,612
    But if I see as much as
         one bruise...

622
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:00,315
        or one scrape,

623
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,552
I'll call protective services,
          am I clear?

624
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,489
             Yeah.

625
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,012
       Jon, I feel like
        I'm losing her,

626
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,880
       and I don't know
       what else to do.

<i> I'll see you in a couple hours.</i>

628
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,819

631
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,425
       Okay, thank you.

632
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,428
            - Hey.
             - Oh!

633
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,698
        You scared me.

634
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,034
         Where's Lily?

635
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:56,071
  Why don't I take you to the
 store and buy you a new doll?

636
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,440
   I don't want a new doll.

            Claire!

640
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:09,718
  Why do you always hurt me,
          Mommy? Why?

641
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,687
          Oh, my God.

642
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,295
 Okay, let's see what we got.

643
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,930
           Ophelia?

644
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,732
  Would you like me to start
       with the abdomen?

645
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,601
         Sounds good.

646
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,773
   Want me to check it out?

647
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,310
       No, no, I'll go.
Call maintenance and stay here.

648
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,376
         Hmm. Strange.

649
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,213
            Hello?

650
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,349
    Is there someone there?

651
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,049
  We need to get out of here.

652
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,520
           Ophelia?

653

 I know, but someone left this

  It's about Zachary Orcutt.

702
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,150
    That's a lot of blood.

703
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,652
  Yeah, looks like our victim
      was killed up here,

704
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,887

705

706
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:51,760
       Yeah, I'm sorry,

707
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,029
    but Professor Carranza
     was a friend of mine,

708
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:57,699
       and I'm wondering
  if anyone has found a doll.

709
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,501
            A doll?

710
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,536
 Yeah, I came by, I dropped it
    off with her yesterday.

711
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,704
     She was looking into
       something for me.

712
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,773
 I'm gonna need you to leave.

713
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,008
  There's a detective outside
 that'll take your statement.

714
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,344
     Danny, can you please
    escort this woman out?

715
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:12,013
Okay, but it's really important
   that you find this doll.

716
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,782
 - I need you to come with me.
         - Yeah, but--

717
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,984
    - Get her out of here.
      - Yeah, okay, I'm--

718
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,652
        Right this way.

719
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,321

    - [cell phone ringing]

720
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:23,024

      from here to there.

     In the second stage,

802
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,439
    the doll actually gets
     into the host's mind.

803

        a hold on her.

     Then I'll destroy it.

    You're right, I can't,
      but what I do know

825
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,889
 is that if you don't dispose
    of this doll properly,

826
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:18,092
 whatever happens to that doll
 will happen to your daughter.

    If you remove the eyes
        from the doll,

831

  the connection with Claire
      should be severed.
