00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:50,184
File 82-712:
Agent Rick Dicker interrogating.

3
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:53,098
State your name, please.

4
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:56,307
Uh... Tony.

5
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,987
Tony Rydinger.

6
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:02,278
Tell me about the incident.

7
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:05,374
<i>Well, there's this girl in my class.

8
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,222
<i>I saw her at the track meet.

9
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,849
- You're Violet, right?
- That's me.

10
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:12,754
<i>I sorta knew her, but she'd changed.
For better.

11
00:01:12,848 --> 00:01:15,365
<i>She was more sure of herself, cool, cute.

12
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,099
<i>I asked her out for a movie.

13
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:18,888
- So, Friday?
- Friday.☻

14
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,972
<i>And then I went to watch the track meet.

15
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:25,456
<i>Not long after, this 'thing'
happened in the parking lot.

16
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:40,908
Behold, the Underminer!

17
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:46,341
I am always beneath you,
but nothing is beneath me.

18
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:49,873
<i>As if things aren't weird enough,
I look over and I see these boots.

19
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,991
- You two stay here.
- Wait, should we be doing this?

20
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:53,361
It is still illegal.

21
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,216
<i>It looked like super heroes.

22
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,255
- We're going to lose him.
- Oh, all right.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,856
One of you control the perimeter,
keep the crowd back and safe.

24
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,097
The other watch after Jack-jack.

25
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,401
- But, I thought we were gonna...
- You heard your mother.

26
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:05,536
Trampoline me.

27
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:10,950
I call perimeter.

28
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:13,967
You're not going anywhere.
Come back here!

29
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:15,990
<i>I see my chance to get out of there.

30
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:19,365
<i>But, there's something familiar
about one of the kids' voices.

31
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:22,506
<i>The girl, she's upset, and
she throws down her mask,

32
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,873
and it's her!

33
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:25,709
Oh, Tony!

34
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,704
Hi. This isn't what you think it is.

35
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:31,960
<i>This was getting too freaky
I couldn't handle it and ran off.

36
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,905
I feel kinda bad about it.

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,899
Maybe I should've said, hi, or something.

38
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:38,910
It's not her fault superheroes are illegal.

39
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:40,962
And it's not like I don't like
strong girls,

40
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:44,222
I'm pretty secure, manhood-wise...
What is that?

41
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,034
Have you told anyone else about this?
Your parents?

42
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,230
No, they'd only think
I was high on something.

43
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,280
- I think you know what I mean.
- Sure, kid.

44
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,745
I like this girl, Mr. Dicker,

45
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:55,087
I'm supposed to go out
with her Friday night.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,072
Now things are just gonna be weird.

47
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:01,365
I wish I could forget I ever saw her
in that suit.

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,916
You will, kid.

49
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,095
You will.

50
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:14,731
[INCREDIBLES 2]

51
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,050
Come on!

52
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:41,426
Consider yourselves undermined!

53
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:07,583
- Underminer, we meet again!
- Huh?

54
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:15,052
Oh, great! Now he's having
a* dead end.

55
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:27,824
Oh!

56
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:31,331
Incredible,...

57
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,526
meet Jackhammer!

58
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,570
(...)*

59
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,516
Bye-bye!

60
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,578
No no no...

61
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,366
Everyboy, stand back, okay?

62
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,054
Stay back!

63
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,874
Dash, can't you see we're babysitting.

64
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:23,106
I can't steer it, or stop it
and the Underminer's escaped.

65
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:26,481
We'll have to stop it...
Bob, the monorail!

66
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,348
Frozone! Yeah!

67
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:41,186
We have to stop this thing
before it gets to the overpass.

68
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:44,076
I'll try to keep it away
from the buildings.

69
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,461
Hey, lady!

70
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:59,648
Thank you so much, young man.

71
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,085
Violet!

72
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,444
Stop!

73
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:25,413
Everybody stop!

74
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:57,543
- Heads up, dad!
- Dash!

75
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:02,949
- Violet, who's watching Jack-Jack?
- Dad's watching him.

76
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,156
Violet, here, you take him.

77
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,335
It's headed for City Hall.

78
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,203
Mom needs help.

79
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:26,442
They're out in public again.
This is our chance!

80
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,878
Follow them.
Follow Frozone!

81
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:45,706
Bob!
Help me with the boiler.

82
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,081
That should do it.

83
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:05,293
What are you kids doing?
Get outta here!

84
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,912
This thing's gonna blow!

85
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:08,569
There's no time!

86
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:22,046
We did it!

87
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,755
Freeze, supers!

88
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,671
Oh, what did we do!

89
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:32,934
Excuse me, Mr. 'Zone?

90
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,731
Sorry, but, I'm not really
supposed to be here.

91
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,647
Which seems wrong, doesn't it?

92
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,553
Perhaps you'd be interested in
changing that law?

93
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:49,718
<i>Superheroes, including Frozone,
Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl,

94
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:51,802
<i>caused further damage to the city.

95
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,058
<i>The Underminer remains at large.

96
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,058
- We didn't start this fight.
- Well, you didn't finish it, either!

97
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,976
- Dd you stop Underminer from
inflicting more damage? - No.

98
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,750
- Did you stop him from robbing
the banks? - No.

99
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,546
- Did you catch him?
- No.

100
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:07,325
The banks were insured, we
have infrastructure in place

101
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,702
to deal with these matters.

102
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,346
If you had simply done nothing,

103
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:13,427
everything would now be
proceeding in an orderly fashion.

104
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,786
You'd have preferred we do nothing?

105
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:17,763
Without a doubt.

106
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:23,137
You weren't much help.

107
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,201
You want out of the hole?

108
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,166
First you gotta put down
the shovel.

109
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:33,042
Uh, that went poorly.

110
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:37,181
Dad, this is probably
not the best time

111
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:39,479
to tell you about this, but,

112
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,674
something else happened today:

113
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:44,641
about a kid, and my mask.

114
00:09:58,061 --> 00:10:02,707
Oh hey, Rick, Violet's friend,
a kid named Tony,

115
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,908
might have seen her in the outfit
without her mask.

116
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:09,298
- Talkative type?
- Dunno, last name is Rydinger.

117
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,737
Tony Rydinger. I'll check it out.

118
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:14,890
Bob, Helen.

119
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,109
A word if you don't mind.

120
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:20,302
The program's been shut down.

121
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,766
What?

122
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:24,922
Politicians don't understand
people who do good

123
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:26,698
simply because it's right.

124
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:28,726
Makes them nervous.

125
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:31,355
They've been gunning
for supers for years.

126
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:33,738
Today was all they needed.

127
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,837
Anyway, I'm done.

128
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:40,986
I'm afraid two more weeks in the motel
was the best I can do for you.

129
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,210
- It's ain't much.
- You've done plenty, Rick.

130
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:44,881
We won't forget it.

131
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:48,420
Well, it has been a great honor
working with you good people.

132
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,063
Thanks for everything. And good luck.

133
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,321
Yeah, you too.

134
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,878
Did you wash your hands?

135
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:13,544
With the soap?

136
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:16,678
Did you dry them?

137
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,171
What?! Is this all vegetables?

138
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,062
Who ordered all vegetables?

139
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,081
I did. They're good and
you're going to have some.

140
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,047
Are we going to talk about it?

141
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:33,173
- What?
- The elephant in the room.

142
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,851
- What elephant?
- I guess not, then.

143
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:39,054
- You're referring to today?
- Yeah! What's the deal with today?

144
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,529
We all make mistakes.

145
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:43,418
For example, you kids were
supposed to watch Jack-Jack.

146
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,547
Babysitting, while you guys
did the important stuff.

147
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,868
We talked about this.

148
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:49,938
You're not old enough to decide
about these things.

149
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:52,083
- We are old enough to help out.
- Yeah!

150
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:53,835
Isn't that what you tell us, dad?

151
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,920
Yeah, well, help out can mean
many different things.

152
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:59,702
- But we're supposed to help
if there's trouble. - Yeah.

153
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:02,026
- Aren't you glad we helped today?
- I know, but...

154
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:05,092
- You said that you were proud of us.
- Well, I was, 'am'.

155
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:07,106
We wanna fight bad guys!

156
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:09,520
No, you don't!

157
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,771
You said things were different, now.

158
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:14,034
And they were 'on the island'.

159
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:16,037
But, I didn't mean that from now on...

160
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:18,238
So, now, we gotta go back to
never using our powers!

161
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:21,156
- It defines who I am!
- We're not saying...

162
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,535
- What?
- Some actor* said it.

163
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,965
Can we just eat the dinner,

164
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,015
while it's hot?

165
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:30,941
Did we do something wrong?
- Yes. - No.

166
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:33,377
We didn't do anything wrong.

167
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:35,742
Superheroes are illegal.

168
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,451
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

169
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:40,504
The law should be fair.
What are we teaching our kids?

170
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,575
- To respect the law.
- Even when the law is disrepectful?

171
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,714
If laws are unjust, there are laws to
change them. Otherwise it's chaos.

172
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:50,463
Which is exactly what we have!

173
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,805
- I just thought it was kinda cool.
- What was?

174
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,749
Fighting crime as a family.

175
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,559
It was cool.

176
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,387
But, it's over.

177
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,984
The world is what it is.
We have to adapt.

178
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,896
Are things bad?

179
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,678
Things are fine.

180
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:16,515
Can I be excused?

181
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,688
How much longer in the motel, dad?

182
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:25,982
Not much longer, sweetie.

183
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:35,701
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

184
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:39,142
- Maybe Dicker will find something.
- Dicker is gone, Bob.

185
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:42,259
Any thought we had about
being supers again, is fantasy.

186
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:43,943
One of us has gotta get a job.

187
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:45,387
One of us?

188
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:47,367
You did a long stint at Insuricare.

189
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:50,812
- Hated every minute of it.
- I know it was hard on you.

190
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:53,507
Maybe it's my turn in the
private sector and you take...

191
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,236
No, I'm doing this.

192
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,158
I need to do this.

193
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,013
- Do you know where suit and my ties are?
- Burned up when...

194
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:03,371
- the jet destroyed our house.
- the jet destroyed our house.

195
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:04,720
Yeah.

196
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:08,248
We can't count on anyone
else now, Bob. It's just us.

197
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,569
We can't wait for...

198
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,649
No lifeguard on duty.

199
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,288
Swim at your own risk.

200
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:23,969
Oh, where'd you go today?

201
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,985
I noticed you missed all the fun.

202
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,897
Don't be mad, because I know
when to leave a party.

203
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:32,832
I'm just as illegal as you guys, besides
I knew the cops would let you go.

204
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:36,062
- Yeah. It's quite a far fetched excuse*
- Yeah, yeah.

205
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,869
I heard the program shut down.

206
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,297
- How much longer are you in this motel?
- 2 weeks.

207
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,267
And you know the offer still stands.

208
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,401
You're very generous,
but there's five of us.

209
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,192
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

210
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:49,934
The door's always open.

211
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:52,197
You know the news isn't all bad.

212
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,948
While you guys were
being detained,

213
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:58,574
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

214
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,021
Winston Deavor.

215
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:04,331
Wants to talk with me,
with you too, about hero stuff.

216
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,075
I checked him out, he's legit,

217
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,324
trained under Dicker,
he wants to meet.

218
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,418
Aw, jeez, more Superhero trouble?

219
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:12,880
We just came from the police
station Lucius.

220
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:15,969
- When?
- Tonight, I'm going there, now.

221
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:18,413
You enjoy. I'm sittin' this one out.

222
00:15:18,438 --> 00:15:20,118
He wants all three of us.

223
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:23,481
Honey, let's just, at least
hear what he has to say.

224
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:26,342
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

225
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,354
We go in our supersuits?

226
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:32,644
Yeah. Might wanna wear the old supersuits.

227
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:35,605
Got a feeling he's nostalgic.

228
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:40,894
Where are you going?

229
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,494
The fresh air is
especially good tonight.

230
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:46,705
- If Jack-Jack wakes up...
- I know the drill.

231
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,668
Your security badge.

232
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,606
Please this way.

233
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:03,907
Hey listen, you're my biggest fan.
What am I saying? I'm your biggest...

234
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,414
Shoot.

235
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:31,974
I love superheroes!

236
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:35,802
The powers, the costumes,
the mythic struggles!

237
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,852
Winston Deavor. You can call me Win.

238
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:39,635
Genuine pleasure to meet you.

239
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,081
Frozone!

240
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:42,870
- Elastigirl.
- Nice to meet you.

241
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:44,640
- Mr. Incredible.
- Hello.

Can't tell you what
a thrill this is.

251
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:10,656
- And this is ...
- Oh, hello there.

252
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,734
Superheroes, I'm so sorry.

253
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,851
...is my TARDY sister, Evelyn.

254
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:18,655
And I'm scolding myself, so,
you don't have to, Winston.

255
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,054
Spectacular.

256
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,810
My father was so proud

257
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:24,678
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

258
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:27,495
He used to call you,
the last line of defense.

259
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:29,534
He was your top supporter.

260
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,074
He donated to superhero causes,

261
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,093
he raised money for the
Dynaguy statue in Avery Park.

262
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,257
He got to know many supers, personally.

263
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:40,008
Even installed a phone
with direct lines

264
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:43,731
to Gazerbeam and Bionic
in case of emergencies.

265
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,184
He loved that.
Showed it off to everyone.

266
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:49,286
He was heartbroken when you were
all forced to go underground.

267
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,060
Father believed the world be
more dangerous without you.

268
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,501
But, you know how right he was.

269
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,119
There was a break-in.

270
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:04,170
My father called Gazerbeam,
the direct line.

271
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,228
No answer.

272
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:07,861
He called Bionic.

273
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,227
No answer.

274
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:12,119
Superheroes had just been made illegal.

275
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:16,628
The robbers discovered him
on the phone, and shot him.

276
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:18,977
So...

277
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,091
Must've been hard.

278
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,818
Especially for mother.

279
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:25,902
She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.

280
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:29,789
If superheroes had not been forced
underground it never would've happened.

281
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:33,339
Or dad could've taken mom to his safe-room
as soon as he knew there was trouble.

282
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:37,698
I disagree strongly, but we're
not going into it right now.

283
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,852
The point is nobody expected us

284
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,840
to be able to actually
run dad's company.

285
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,240
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator,

286
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:51,403
we threw ourselves into building
Devtech into what it is today.

287
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:54,098
A world-class
telecommunications company.

288
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,433
Bigger than ever.

289
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,683
and perfectly positioned to
make some wrong things, right.

290
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,676
Hence, this meeting.

291
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:02,274
Let me ask you something.

292
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,425
What is the main you were
all forced underground?

293
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,956
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

294
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,332
Take today, for example,
with the Underminer.

295
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,973
Difficult situation: you were faced
with a lot of hard decisions.

296
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:16,397
- Oh, tell me about it.
- I can't.

297
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:19,056
Because, I didn't see it.

298
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,868
Neither did anyone else.

299
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,355
So, when you fight bad guys, like today,

300
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,160
people don't see the fight,
or what led up to it.

301
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:28,422
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

302
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,151
They see the destruction,
and they see you.

303
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,322
So if we want change people's
perceptions about superheroes,

304
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,246
we need YOU to share YOUR
perceptions with the world.

305
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,605
- How do we do that?
- With cameras.

306
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,255
<i>we need YOU to share YOUR
perceptions with the world.

307
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,489
<i>How do we do that?

308
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:49,938
We embed tiny cameras like those
into your super suit.

309
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:51,332
Wow, so small!

310
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,485
- And the picture is outstanding.
- Thanks, I designed it myself.

311
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,954
We've got resources, lobbyists, world-wide
connections and, very important,

312
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:01,240
- Insurance.
- Insurance is key.

313
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,720
All we need now,
are the superest superheroes.

314
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,437
It means you three.

315
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:09,157
Come on, help me make
all supers legal again!

316
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:10,696
This sounds great!

317
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:13,093
Let's get this going,
what's my first assignment?

318
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:16,267
That enthusiasm is golden.
Hold onto it.

319
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:20,018
But for our first move, well,
Elastigirl is our best play.

320
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,645
- Better than me?
- Ahem!

321
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:28,899
I mean, she's good.
She's, really, a credit to her, but...

322
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:31,198
you know ... You know.

323
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:33,575
With great respect,
let's not test the whole,

324
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,916
'insurance-will-pay-for-everything' idea,
on the first go 'round, OK?

325
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,364
Wait a minute, you're saying what?
I'm messy?

326
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:43,899
Well, Evelyn did a cost-benefit
analysis comparing

327
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:47,344
all your last 5 years of crime-fighting,
before going underground.

328
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:49,652
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

329
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:51,651
Oh, it's not a fair comparison.

330
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:54,361
Heavyweight problems,
need heavyweight solutions.

331
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:58,188
Of course! We're gonna solve
all kinds of problems together.

332
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:02,821
After a perfect launch with Elastigirl!

333
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:07,123
- So, what do you say?
- What do I say?

334
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:11,127
I don't know.

335
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:13,179
What do you mean,
you don't know?

336
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,623
A few hours ago, you were saying
it was over.

337
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,666
That being a superhero
was a fantasy.

338
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:21,074
Now, you get the offer of a lifetime
and you don't know?

339
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,502
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids.

340
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:27,661
- So do I.
- From jail, Bob!

341
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,260
How do you do that?
By turning down the chance

342
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:32,705
to change the law that's forcing
them to hide what they are?

343
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,344
They haven't decided what they are!
They're still kids.

344
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,991
Kids with powers,
which makes them supers.

345
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:40,349
Whether they decide to use
those powers, or not.

346
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:43,898
- This will benefit them.
- Look, it's not a good time to be away.

347
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:45,712
Dashiel's having trouble
with homework,

348
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,797
Violet's worried about her first
date with that boy she likes, Tony.

349
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:52,251
- And Jack-Jack ...
- Jack-Jack? What's wrong with him?

350
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,046
OK, nothing's wrong with Jack-Jack.

351
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:56,616
But, even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

352
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:59,735
- I'm just not sure I can leave.
- Of course you can leave.

353
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,769
You've got to, so that I...

354
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,511
WE could be supers, again.

355
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:05,863
So, our kids can have that choice.

356
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:09,129
- So you can have that choice.
- All right, yes!

357
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:11,204
So I can have that choice.

358
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,896
And I would do a great job.

359
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:17,793
Regardless of what those dumb
pie charts say, or whatever.

360
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,121
But they want you.

361
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:23,678
And you'll do a great...

362
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:25,709
job.

363
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:27,596
Sure.

364
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:31,932
That was excruciating to watch.

365
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,399
I can't lie to you,
it's nice to be wanted.

366
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,174
- Flattery, you know. But...
- What's the choice?

367
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,020
1: do this right, get well paid,
we're out of the motel,

368
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:44,165
and things get better for all supers,
including our kids.

369
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:48,193
Or, 2: I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.

370
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,893
You know it's crazy, right?

371
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:53,973
To help my family, I gotta leave it.
To fix the law, I gotta break it.

372
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,101
- You'll be great.
- I know I will.

373
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:59,312
- But what about you? We have kids.
- I'll watch the kids. No problem.

374
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:02,115
- Easy.
- Easy, huh? You're adorable.

375
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,172
Well, if there is a problem, I'll drop
this thing and come right back.

376
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:08,664
You won't need to.
I got it, you go. Do this thing.

377
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,899
Do it so,...

378
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,139
I can do it better.

379
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:18,809
- Deavor, here.
- This is Elastigirl, I'm in.

380
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:25,973
Mr. Deavor, it's wonderful,
but, it's too generous.

381
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:27,879
Nonsense. It's the least we could do.

382
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:31,253
We're partners, now!
Can't have my partners living in a motel.

383
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:33,688
Wh-whose is the house?

384
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,424
It's my house. I have several.

385
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:38,334
I'm not using that one.
Stay as long as you need.

386
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,553
- I don't know what to say.
- How about, thanks?

387
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:44,978
This is our new house?!

388
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:47,535
It's OK, easy, tiger.
It's being loaned to us.

389
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,987
- Yeah. - This is homey.
- I mean, look at this place.

390
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:53,504
Deavor bought it from an
eccentric billionaire

391
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:56,044
who liked to come and go,
without being seen,

392
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:58,255
so the house has
multiple hidden exits.

393
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:00,224
Good thing we won't stand out.

394
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:03,270
Wouldn't wanna attract any
unecessary attention.

395
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:05,286
It's got a big yard!

396
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:09,321
- Isn't... Isn't it a bit much?
- Near a forest!

397
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:13,366
- Would you rather be at the motel?
- And a pool!

398
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:15,814
What exactly is mom's new job?

399
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,266
The important thing is,
we're out of the motel.

400
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,882
I like mom's new job!

401

- But, I thought superheroes
were still illegal.

They are, for now.

445
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:19,987

She's not break...

be illegal.

It's going the wrong direction.

511
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:12,396
We're going the wrong way.

512
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:14,178
I'm going after it.

513
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:22,046
This thing's really moving!
100 and climbing.

514
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:23,906
How much track is built?

515
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,441
<i>About 25 miles.</i>

516
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,794
Nobody can shut this thing down?

517
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,607
<i>They've tried, no go.</i>

518
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:41,148
Is that Elastigirl?

519
00:31:44,294 --> 00:31:45,876
Look out!

520
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:51,014
- Override!
- They're locked out of the system.

521
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,384
- What about a fail-safe.
<i>- Not enough time.</i>

522
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:04,828
<i>- Someone's calling?</i>
- Switch it over.

523
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:07,957
<i>Hey, mom, I can't find my high socks,
and dad can't find them either</i>

524
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:10,400
<i>but he won't call you and ask, so, I am.</i>

525
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:11,821
<i>You're not calling your mother!</i>

526
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,764
Dash, honey, can't talk right now.
But look under your bed, OK?

527
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:17,367
- How much time?
<i>- Approximately 2 minutes.</i>

528
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:20,739
<i>There's a shortcut
through the corridor up ahead.</i>

529
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,625
I dunno if I can stay with him.

530
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,116
Come on!

531
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:39,840
What the heck?

532
00:34:40,322 --> 00:34:43,718
Everybody alright? Is anybody injured?
You alright?

533
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:48,974
Your story better be good!

534
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:52,201
Hey? HEY?

535
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:54,172
What happened?

536
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:58,207
[Welcome back, Elastigirl]
.

537
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:01,707
[Welcome back, Elastigirl]
[Screenslaver]

538
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,828
- Honey, why are you?...
- Don't say anything.

539
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:38,767
- It's dad. Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

540
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,808
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Tony didn't even call?

541
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:46,404
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Oh honey... - Dad!

542
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:51,608
If you want me to feel better,
then, leave me alone. Please.

543
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:53,547
Huh?

544
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:55,235
<i>...only my kid brother's son.</i>

545
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:56,984
<i>Today is his first birthday.</i>

546
00:35:57,066 --> 00:36:00,035
<i>He's not as mature, as you, Roy.</i>

547
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:02,853
<i>'Cause you're a wonderful policeman.</i>

548
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:04,799
<i>This is a holdup.</i>

549
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:08,100
<i>Right, get your hands up,
turn your back.</i>

550
00:36:08,128 --> 00:36:11,981
<i>Put your hands behind your head
and keep'em there. Don't move.</i>

551
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:14,645
<i>Drop it! And get over there.</i>

552
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,443
<i>Watch the door.</i>

553
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:19,899
<i>Do you think I'm kiddin'?</i>

554
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:24,148
<i>Now.</i>

555
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:29,459
<i>- I said, now!
- I got'im!</i>

556
00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:31,225
<i>Come on!</i>

557
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:11,822
No, no, no, no, no!

558
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:16,237
No!

559
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:19,862
No, no!

560
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,408
No, no, no! NO!

561
00:38:22,578 --> 00:38:24,994
No, no, no, no! NO!

562
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,799
You have POWERS!

563
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:37,571
Yeah, baby!

564
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:39,652
And there's not a scratch
on you!

565
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:43,545
How'd you go through the locked door?
Are those your powers?

566
00:38:43,852 --> 00:38:47,931
You can multiply like rabbits and
go right through anything solid.

567
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:54,556
Oh, my God!

568
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:02,941
- Hello.
- Hey, honey. You weren't gonna call me?

569
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,016
Hi, hey, no. I mean, yes, yeah.

570
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,316
I just didn't wanna... wait.

571
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:11,192
The strangest thing just
happened out in the yard.

572
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:12,908
Sounds like I just woke you up.

573
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,858
No, no, it's just, Jack-Jack.

574
00:39:14,883 --> 00:39:17,497
He's had an accident? I knew it.
I'm coming home, right now.

575
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,501
- I never should've...
- No, no, no. No accidents.

576
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,134
Stay there and
finish your mission.

577
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,793
And you never, should... What?!
You don't think I can do this?

578
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:26,834
Sorry, I misspoke.

579
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:28,786
Do you need me to come back?

580
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,652
No, no, no, I've got this.
Everything's great.

581
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:33,746
What happened with Jack-Jack?

582
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:38,496
- Nothing, he's in excellent health.
- Well, that's good.

583
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:42,977
How was Violet's date?
That was tonight, right?

584
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:45,620
Oh, yeah. Yes. Good.

585
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,709
All, fine, and good.

586
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:50,020
And Jack-Jack went down,
with no trouble?

587
00:39:50,045 --> 00:39:51,848
Fine, yes, no trouble.

588
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:53,520
And Dash got his homework done?

589
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:57,053
- All done. - So, things haven't spiraled
out of control, the moment I left?

590
00:39:57,093 --> 00:40:01,490
Amazing as it may seem, it has
been quite uneventful, in fact.

591
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,180
How about you?

592
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:05,348
I saved a runaway train!

593
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:11,235
It was so great! The mayor was there
to cut the ribbon on this new train.

594
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,720
<i>...opening ceremony,
Elastigirl pursued the train</i>

595
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,738
<i>and was able to
successfully activate...</i>

596
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:18,182
Bla-bla-bla, he says a few
words, cut the ribbon

597
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,145
and the train starts pulling
out of the station, backwards, then...

598
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,191
<i>- the track of the brand new hover-train
- ...the train malfunctioned

599
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,866
<i>- ...due to Elastigirl...
- ...came to an almost...

600
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,359
<i>...superhero. Elastigirl...
- Elastigirl... - Elastigirl...

601
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:32,341
BOOM! NO CASUALTIES!

602
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,353
<i>...specialized motorbike...

603
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:40,033
<i>And I go after it, I'm tellin'ya
honey, it was a saga!

604
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:44,259
That's fantastic honey!
And on your first night!

605
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:47,244
I'm so proud of you. Really.

606
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,067
<i>I'm proud of you, honey.</i>

607
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:51,989
I know you wanna get out there
and you will soon, OK?

608
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:53,866
You will be amazing!

609
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:56,410
I couldn't have done this,
if you hadn't taken over so well.

610
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:58,429
<i>Thanks for handling everything.

611
00:40:58,454 --> 00:40:59,971
It's nothing.

612
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:02,664
I love you, honey. I'll be back soon.

613
00:41:03,114 --> 00:41:05,896
<i>- Sweet dreams.</i>
- Sweet dreams, honey.

614
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,229
...I can't explain...

615
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:24,562
Hey, dad, it's okay.

616
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:27,666
I'll just wait for mom to get home.

617
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:30,544
As if she could... ah...

618
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,435
I can do math.

619
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,288
Oh, that's not a good sign...

620
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:49,426
Weak command!

621
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:53,101
Am I a substitute parent?

622
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:58,718
It's not my fault, they changed math.

623
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:08,533
Hey, buddy. Come on.

624
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:11,453
I think I understad your
math assignment.

625
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:14,998
We still have some time to
finish it before your test.

626
00:42:15,296 --> 00:42:18,774
First, you wanna put all the
numbers by themselves....

627
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:23,863
And now that means the
plus becomes a minus and the minus....

628
00:42:24,065 --> 00:42:26,798
You got it? Yeah, baby!

629
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:42,875
Oh. Hello.

630
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,029
We're in a new house.

631
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:47,992
I did write my address
on your locker,

632
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:50,025
in permanent ink.

633
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:52,188
Oh, is that, what that is?

634
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:53,942
Did you forget?

635
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:56,200
Forget? ... What?

636
00:42:58,062 --> 00:42:59,680
That's funny.

637
00:43:02,115 --> 00:43:03,724
Funny for honey.

638
00:43:04,255 --> 00:43:07,167
Oh, was it the weird outfit?

639
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:10,654
'Cause there's a reason!
I'm in a drama class,

640
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:13,139
and they just wanna
do Shakespeare,

641
00:43:13,164 --> 00:43:15,967
but they were like, try to
make it relevant for the kids.

642
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:18,528
So, like, superheroes.
Kids love superheroes. - Yeah, yeah.

643
00:43:18,553 --> 00:43:19,968
You wanna wear one
kind of tights

644
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:22,049
and then they're like, no,
wear these other kind.

645
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:24,791
Do... Do I know you?

646
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,138
<i>Many say your speech today
is critical.

647
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:37,849
<i>Both sides just want the
best for their people.

648
00:43:37,874 --> 00:43:41,048
<i>We are so close to finally
getting peace in the region.

649
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:43,304
I haven't done this in a while.

650
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:45,813
This is good.
The train gives us momentum.

651
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,234
Just go out there and be your
charming self and capitalize.

652
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,893
Ms. Elastigirl, they're ready for you.

653
00:43:51,923 --> 00:43:54,116
Hey, spread your legs.

654
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:58,414
- Thank you Chad.
- My pleasure, Ambassador.

655
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,637
<i>Gloria.

656
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:02,761
Madam Ambassador, hello!

657
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:06,533
You are Elastigirl! This is why,
now, I'm shaking your hands.

658
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:09,156
Oh, I was so sad when
you went ungerground.

659
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:12,507
I'm glad to see you back!
In your shiny outfit.

660
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:16,303
- That means so much coming from you.
Good luck with your speech.

661
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:20,545
- Bring lasting peace.
- I will, when you defeat evil!

662
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,253
Okay.

663
00:44:22,278 --> 00:44:23,963
Three, two ...

664
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:27,727
For over 15 years, superheroes
have been in hiding.

665
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:31,090
Forced into it by a society,
no longer willing to support them.

666
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,274
That may soon be changing due to a
growing movement to bring supers back.

667
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:38,600
Here, fresh on the heels of her own
heroic save of a runaway train

668
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:42,354
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elastigirl.

669
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:46,125
- Welcome. - Hello, Chad. - Well all the
polls are going in your direction.

670
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,337
That's true. Things are good.

671
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:48,595
Hello.

672
00:44:49,017 --> 00:44:50,344
Uh, hello.

673
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,982
Do I have your attention?

674
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:54,285
Yes, Chad?

675
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,283
Of course, I do,
I'm appearing on your screen.

676
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:00,275
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

677
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:02,379
Screens are everywhere.

678
00:45:02,404 --> 00:45:05,084
We are controlled by screens.

679
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:10,290
And screens are controlled by me:

680
00:45:10,316 --> 00:45:12,192
<i>SCREENSLAVER!</i>

681
00:45:12,227 --> 00:45:14,885
- Hey!
<i>- I control this broadcast.</i>

682
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,978
<i>And this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.</i>

683
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:20,123
- What's wrong with him?
- The signal's been hijacked!

684
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:22,334
- I'll check it out.
- Don't look at any monitors.

685
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:24,862
<i>I could hijack the ambassador's
aerocade,</i>

686
00:45:24,894 --> 00:45:29,010
<i>while it's still airborne,
right, Elastigirl?</i>

687
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:33,335
Nearest window!
Where's the nearest window?

688
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:35,102
There.

689
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:48,078
- What's going on?
- Where's Elastigirl?

690
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:49,831
Which one?

691
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,377
- What are you doing here?
- The Ambassador is in danger.

692
00:46:01,402 --> 00:46:04,116
Which chopper is she in?
Look out!

693
00:46:04,988 --> 00:46:07,138
Follow them and get me close!

694
00:46:10,193 --> 00:46:13,112
Get out of the sky. Touchdown safely!

695
00:46:22,398 --> 00:46:24,781
Stand down, it's Elastigirl.

696
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:27,531
Stay in your seat, Ma'am!

697
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:35,771
We're under attack!

698
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,239
Quick go.
Protect the Ambassador!

699
00:46:42,143 --> 00:46:44,820
- Open the door!
- Do as she says!

700
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:49,581
- Can you all, swim?
- Yeah. - Yeah. - No.

701
00:47:10,513 --> 00:47:13,607
We're gonna have to switch sides, hang on!

702
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:22,848
Are you all right, Ma'am?

703
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,586
I'm perfectly fine.

704
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:37,257
Boys are dirt and superheroes suck.

705
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:40,466
- Good morning.
- He took one look at me in that suit,

706
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:44,321
and decided to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

707
00:47:44,346 --> 00:47:46,414
Oh, he's protecting himself.

708
00:47:46,439 --> 00:47:49,158
If he really see you,
it's best that he forgets.

709
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:50,936
It's better for you, too.

710
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:53,209
I can't tell you how many
memories

711
00:47:53,234 --> 00:47:56,027
Dicker's had to erase,
over the years, when...

712
00:47:56,183 --> 00:47:59,894
someone figured out your
mother's or my identity.

713
00:48:00,137 --> 00:48:01,908
It was Dicker!

714
00:48:01,933 --> 00:48:04,152
- You told him about Tony!
- Honey.

715
00:48:04,177 --> 00:48:07,210
You had me erased from
Tony's mind!

716
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:22,152
I hate superheroes!

717
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:25,068
And I renounce them!

718
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:34,227
I renounce th...!

719
00:48:40,926 --> 00:48:43,390
Is she having adolescence?

720
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:45,819
<i>a new report out
today shows that</i>

721
00:48:45,844 --> 00:48:47,503
<i>when it comes to decision making</i>

722
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:50,872
<i>people have more trust in a monkey
throwing darts than Congress.</i>

723
00:48:50,897 --> 00:48:53,114
What's going on Tommy? The President?

724
00:48:53,161 --> 00:48:55,129
They're here in support.

725
00:48:55,217 --> 00:48:57,662
Support? Support for what?

726
00:48:57,731 --> 00:48:59,888
In support of you.

727
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:04,581
Hello, all of you!

728
00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:07,481
Thanks for coming out. Hi.

729
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,205
Oh, my goodnes, thanks so much!

730
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:13,197
Hello. What's your sign say?

731
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:15,616
[SCREENSLAVER IS STILL AT IT*]

732
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:22,729
'Sup?

733
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:24,942
Oh, what do you know, Ellen Wood!

734
00:49:24,984 --> 00:49:28,151
Oh, now you wanna return my calls
about superheroes, huh?

735
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:31,174
Oh, I'll have to call YOU back.
Oh, that felt good!

736
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:32,782
Felicia, hold my calls, please.

737
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:34,370
Hey, it's working!

738
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:37,858
Hey, the ambassador made a big
speech about superheroes, today.

739
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,263
Turns out, saving someone's life makes
a good impression on them. Who knew?

740
00:49:41,288 --> 00:49:43,321
I'm getting calls from
all over the world.

741
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:46,020
Media awareness is up 72%

742
00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:48,420
The push for superhero
legalization's becoming

743
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:50,107
a world-wide movement!

744
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,041
I have big plans for our next move.

745
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:53,900
We're gonna have a summit at sea.

746
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:56,271
We'll use our ship we'll gather
leaders

747
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:58,377
and supers from all over
the world.

748
00:49:58,409 --> 00:50:00,654
That's great. I'm happy.

749
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:02,440
I'm happy the numbers are up.

750
00:50:02,473 --> 00:50:05,560
I'm happy the ambassador is
pro-superheroes.

751
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:07,321
And I'm happy, you're happy.

752
00:50:07,322 --> 00:50:10,496
I'm hearing that you're happy,
but why am I not feeling it?

753
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:13,328
Because I didn't get him.
Screenslaver's still out there.

754
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:16,354
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

755
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:20,183
He's gonna want more and as long
as he gets to play, he wins!

756
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:23,644
One thing I've learned in business:
smell the flowers.

757
00:50:23,669 --> 00:50:25,214
They don't bloom that often.

758
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:28,172
What do you want on your tombstone,
"She worried a lot"?

759
00:50:28,211 --> 00:50:31,248
All right, stop talking,
show her.

760
00:50:41,899 --> 00:50:43,266
Wow, ah...

761
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:46,756
Wow! Elastigirl, there you are.

762
00:50:46,781 --> 00:50:49,187
- Hello.
- I-I didn't... wow!

763
00:50:49,384 --> 00:50:51,898
Ahem! (Get yourself together, Karen)

764
00:50:52,243 --> 00:50:55,212
Hi, my superhero name is Voyd,

765
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:58,392
I just wanna thank you, for like,
for being you.

766
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:01,918
And I'd... really like to say... Okay.

767
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:04,801
What I can do, um, is this.

768
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:12,930
Yeah, that is impressive

769
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:15,280
Very interdimensional.

770
00:51:15,324 --> 00:51:17,423
I felt like an outcast. Before.

771
00:51:17,448 --> 00:51:21,170
But now, with you being... you.

772
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:22,704
I really...

773
00:51:23,726 --> 00:51:25,308
Yay, me.

774
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:27,972
I flew them in, from all over.

775
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:29,947
They've all been in hiding.

776
00:51:29,972 --> 00:51:32,252
With powers, secret identities,
and

777
00:51:32,276 --> 00:51:34,564
names they've given themselves.

778
00:51:34,817 --> 00:51:37,071
I'm Screech, a pleasure.

779
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:40,043
I always considered you as
the gold standard for the superhero.

780
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:42,465
Well, thanks. You're too nice.

781
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:46,353
- I am called Brick.
- Nice to meet you, Brick.

782
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:49,103
- Where are you from?
- Winsconsin.

783
00:51:49,257 --> 00:51:52,539
Oh, Elastigirl. I assume your powers are...

784
00:51:52,564 --> 00:51:55,013
You know, zapping things electrically,

785
00:51:55,038 --> 00:51:57,347
charging things, bolts of lightning,
that kinda stuff.

786
00:51:57,372 --> 00:51:58,779
Name's Reflux.

787
00:51:58,804 --> 00:52:01,578
Medical condition, or superpower?
You decide.

788
00:52:02,111 --> 00:52:04,964
That's a little line I say
just to put people at ease.

789
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:06,800
- By the way: big fan.
- Oh, no, no.

790
00:52:06,825 --> 00:52:08,487
Reflux, love it.

791
00:52:12,408 --> 00:52:15,658
Yeah, that is impressive.
Keep practicing.

792
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:18,563
Ow!

793
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:22,730
Well, I'm beat.

794
00:52:22,755 --> 00:52:24,791
Congratulations. Big day.

795
00:52:24,815 --> 00:52:27,318
Good night ladies.
I will see you tomorrow.

796
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,673
G'night.

797
00:52:28,707 --> 00:52:30,754
Must be nice for you,
being out front,

798
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:33,037
- after all this time?
- Out front?

799
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:36,174
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days.

800
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:39,461
And, even then, you were kind of
in Mr. Incredible's shadow.

801
00:52:39,486 --> 00:52:41,079
Nah, I beg to differ.

802
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:44,949
I'm not saying you weren't big.
And you were and ARE a superstar.

803
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:48,011
But, you have the stage
to yourself, now.

804
00:52:48,036 --> 00:52:50,236
People have to pay attention, now.

805
00:52:50,261 --> 00:52:52,214
You mean it's a man's
world and all that bull?

806
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:53,402
What world do you live in?

807
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:56,406
- Your brother runs Devtech.
- I don't want his job.

808
00:52:56,431 --> 00:52:59,150
I invent. He sells.

809
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:02,322
I ask you, which of us has
the greater influence?

810
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:05,393
Which side of me are you asking?
The believer or the cynic?

811
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:08,123
- The cynic.
- Would say, selling is more important

812
00:53:08,148 --> 00:53:10,582
because the best sellers
have the most buyers.

813
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:14,129
Doesn't matter what you're selling.
It only matters what people buy.

814
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:17,863
This is true. If I discovered
the origin of the universe,

815
00:53:17,888 --> 00:53:20,925
my brother would find a way
to market it as a...

816
00:53:21,087 --> 00:53:22,691
foot massager.

817
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:26,350
So, what would the believer say?

818
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:29,258
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

819
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,291
Don't wait for permission,
assert yourself

820
00:53:31,316 --> 00:53:33,196
and impose your will
on the status quo.

821
00:53:33,221 --> 00:53:34,804
- Sounds like my brother.
- What?

822
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:37,227
- You sound like my brother.
- Well, he's not wrong.

823
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:39,461
There's an art to
getting a reaction.

824
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:41,353
- Oh, I know how to get him!
- My brother?

825
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,593
Which... No! Screenslaver!

826
00:53:43,618 --> 00:53:47,085
You're tech savvy; I need to lock
onto his signal and trace its origin.

827
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:49,825
How fast can you slap something
together and meet me at the airport?

828
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,841
- Airport?
- Need to get out of town, pronto.

829
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:53,812
I can get your contraption
together by 5:am.

830
00:53:53,837 --> 00:53:55,774
We need to get on TV. Chad!

831
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,649
I'll get my brother to set up an exclusive
with him tonight on the newscast

832
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,114
- Finish our interview by phone!
- Promote the hell out of it!

833
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:02,552
Independent from screen slavery!

834
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:04,750
'Chad Tonight. BOOM!'

835
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:10,412
- Dicker.
- Yeah, hey Rick.

836
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:13,233
You remember that kid I mentioned
to you, Tony Rydinger?

837
00:54:13,268 --> 00:54:15,027
Mind-wipe? Yeah, nice kid.

838
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,816
Well, you also wiped out a Friday
night date, my daughter had with him.

839
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,063
In fact, you wiped out my daughter.

840
00:54:21,088 --> 00:54:23,336
Oops. Not an exact science, Bob

841
00:54:23,378 --> 00:54:25,278
Rick, you gotta help me here.

842
00:54:25,313 --> 00:54:28,272
Violet hates me, and you,
and superheroes.

843
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:29,702
I gotta fix this.

844
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:31,866
What do you know about Tony?

845
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:35,356
Er... Not much. Seems like a good kid.

846
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:39,496
Popular, plays sports, music.
Parents own the 'Happy Platter'.

847
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,590
Kid works there, part-time.

848
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:43,889
Happy Platter?

849
00:54:46,313 --> 00:54:50,792
Why did we drive all the way across
town for the 'Happy Platter'?

850
00:54:50,817 --> 00:54:54,323
We'd like a booth, over there,
near the Philodendron.

851
00:54:54,348 --> 00:54:57,040
Good, right, near the Philodendron?

852
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:01,758
This platter doesn't look
all that happy, to me.

853
00:55:01,783 --> 00:55:03,764
It looks bored.

854
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:05,876
The Bored Platter!

855
00:55:05,901 --> 00:55:08,961
I thought Vi would want a change
of pace from drive-in food.

856
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:10,987
I like drive-in food.

857
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:12,940
Does this mean, vegetables?

858
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:16,815
A balanced diet needs vegetables,
kiddo. Get ussed to it.

859
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:19,115
Good evening, everyone.

860
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,453
- OH!
- Gross!

861
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:23,919
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, it's OK.

862
00:55:24,075 --> 00:55:27,331
- Let me help you. - That's fine sir.
- I'm fine! I'm fine!

863
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:30,172
Normally she doesn't ever drink like that.

864
00:55:30,436 --> 00:55:32,299
OK, would you like
some water, sir?

865
00:55:32,324 --> 00:55:34,221
Yes. Yes, I would.

866
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:37,176
This is my daughter, whom,
you must know, right?

867
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:40,176
- Hello. - (Violet).
- Hello, Violet.

868
00:55:41,096 --> 00:55:43,925
- Hey, Vi, say hi to...
- Don't push it, dad!

869
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,697
I'm Dash, her little brother.

870
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:47,174
Hello.

871
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:50,573
Really good water, very refreshing!

872
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:54,605
- Mineral water*?
- I don't know, sir, I think it's tap.

873
00:55:54,761 --> 00:55:57,824
- Ah! Very delicious.
- Excellent tap.

874
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,765
Nice to meet you.

875
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,351
Where'd she go?

876
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,708
To find a good place to be angry?

877
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:10,501
Tonight, we go now to a special
remote interview with Elastigirl.

878
00:56:10,526 --> 00:56:12,891
<i>How you feeling, Chad? You doing all right?</i>

879
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:15,423
I'm fine.
The doctors checked me out.

880
00:56:15,586 --> 00:56:17,452
I have no memory of the event.

881
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:20,977
<i>I gotta tell you, it's pretty strange
to see a recording of yourself</i>

882
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,618
<i>the night before, and
have no recollection</i>

883
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:27,464
<i>I don't think anyyone needs to worry,
we've taken many precautions tonight.</i>

884
00:56:27,494 --> 00:56:29,509
<i>- Where are you, right now?</i>
- On a case.

885
00:56:29,534 --> 00:56:31,846
In a secure undisclosed location.

886
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:33,469
<i>I want to talk about you,</i>

887
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:36,011
starting with your save
of a runaway train.

888
00:56:36,121 --> 00:56:39,660
<i>Here's an exclusive, unedited
clip, from your own suit-cam.</i>

889
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:41,331
Roll the clip.

890
00:56:41,422 --> 00:56:43,411
<i>This thing's really moving.</i>

891
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,392
<i>100 and climbing.
How much track is built?</i>

892
00:56:46,425 --> 00:56:48,509
<i>Around 25 miles.</i>

893
00:56:49,804 --> 00:56:53,930
Screenslaver interrupts this program
for an important announcement.

894
00:56:53,965 --> 00:56:55,978
I'll be damned, she knew!

895
00:56:56,003 --> 00:56:57,711
Let's see if her gadget works.

896
00:56:57,736 --> 00:57:00,648
- Don't bother wathing the rest...
- Gotcha!

897
00:57:00,681 --> 00:57:03,592
<i>Elastigirl doesn't save the day.</i>

898
00:57:03,664 --> 00:57:06,575
<i>She only postpones her defeat.</i>

899
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:08,734
<i>And whie she postpones
her defeat,</i>

900
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:11,643
<i>you eat chips and watch her
confront problems</i>

901
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:14,328
<i>that you are too lazy to deal with.</i>

902
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:17,456
<i>Superheroes are part of
your brainless desire</i>

903
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:20,493
<i>to replace true experiences
with stimulation.</i>

904
00:57:21,323 --> 00:57:24,258
<i>You don't talk,
you watch talk-shows.</i>

905
00:57:24,368 --> 00:57:27,663
<i>You have craving to watch
game shows.</i>

906
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:33,084
<i>Travel, relationships, risk,
every meaningful experience</i>

907
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:37,168
<i>must be packaged and
delivered to you to watch at a distance*</i>

908
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:41,268
<i>So that you can remain ever
sheltered, ever passive,</i>

909
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:43,766
<i>ever ravenous consumers</i>

910
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:47,149
<i>who can't bring themseves

911
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:50,875
<i>break a sweat and participate
in life.</i>

912
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:54,176
<i>You want superheroes
to protect you,</i>

913
00:57:54,247 --> 00:57:58,112
<i>and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process,</i>

914
00:57:58,259 --> 00:58:01,666
<i>while you tell yourselves
you're being looked after,</i>

915
00:58:01,713 --> 00:58:06,905
<i>that your futures are being
served and your rights are being upheld.</i>

916
00:58:07,212 --> 00:58:09,962
<i>So that the system keeps
you *stealing from you,</i>

917
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,977
<i>smiling at you all the while.</i>

918
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:16,256
<i>Go ahead, send your supers
to stop me.</i>

919
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:20,661
<i>Grab your snacks, watch your
screens and see what happens.</i>

920
00:58:21,004 --> 00:58:24,064
<i>You are no longer in control,</i>

921
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:26,253
<i>I am.</i>

922
01:00:07,178 --> 01:00:08,904
Find anything?

923
01:00:59,848 --> 01:01:01,344
Sorry!

924
01:01:32,852 --> 01:01:34,305
What happened?

925
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,337
What happened, is,
you destroyed my evidence!

926
01:01:37,388 --> 01:01:39,356
What's going on? What'd I do?

927
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:43,512
- What'd you guys do to me?
- That's right punk, blame the system!

928
01:01:44,278 --> 01:01:47,284
Your tracker worked like a charm,
Evelyn, you're a genius.

929
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:51,096
Aw, shucks! I'm just the genius
behind the genius.

930
01:01:51,148 --> 01:01:52,785
<i>The New Urban city council...

931
01:01:52,826 --> 01:01:57,822
Dad, we're doing fractions and
'dennis-mals' and percentages

932
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,071
- I don't get'em.
- Aren't you ...

933
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,528
- Didn't we get all caught up?
- Yeah, we were caught up

934
01:02:02,561 --> 01:02:06,121
And now, we're doing fractions
and percentages and 'demisals'

935
01:02:06,146 --> 01:02:07,273
Decimals

936
01:02:07,305 --> 01:02:09,911
<i>...of the Incredibile, or the supercar</i>

937
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:12,881
once driven by superhero,
Mr. Incredible.

938
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:16,012
It's the kind of thing you buy,
when you have everything else.

939
01:02:16,037 --> 01:02:17,675
They said it was beyond repair.

940
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:19,385
<i>Hey, it was in perfect condition.</i>

941
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:21,345
You used to have that?

942
01:02:21,356 --> 01:02:22,997
They said it was destroyed.

943
01:02:23,022 --> 01:02:26,924
Once thought lost or destroyed the
famous car turned up at private auction.

944
01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:28,417
They said it was...

945
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:30,488
That's my car!

946
01:02:38,156 --> 01:02:40,748
(...stupid car's features...)

947
01:02:40,797 --> 01:02:43,680
This car's just loaded
with amazing gadgets.

948
01:02:43,705 --> 01:02:45,967
- Care to demonstrate?
- I'd love to, but,

949
01:02:45,992 --> 01:02:48,920
we haven't figured out how
to make them work, yet.

950
01:02:50,116 --> 01:02:52,647
Wow! You do that?!

951
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,803
Huh?

952
01:02:55,828 --> 01:02:58,253
What are you doing? This is not a toy!

953
01:02:58,373 --> 01:02:59,993
That's a rocket launcher!

954
01:03:00,018 --> 01:03:01,876
NO WAY?!
Which one launches the rocket?

955
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:03,320
Hey, this is not your car.

956
01:03:03,345 --> 01:03:04,686
It's not your car, either.

957
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:06,342
It is, so! It's the Incredibile.

958
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,546
- Well why's that guy have it?
- He shouldn't.

959
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,255
Launch the rocket!
Launch the rocket!

960
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,382
LAUNCH! THE! ROCKET!!

961
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:12,906
We're not launching anything.

962
01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:16,087
Do you think I want an angry rich
guy coming after me right now,

963
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:17,903
when I'm trying to not to...

964
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:19,477
distract...

965
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:21,606
your mother

966
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:25,157
Hm... rich guy!...

967
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:31,518
So you're not gonna steal your car
back from the rich guy?

968
01:03:45,546 --> 01:03:48,442
- Jack-Jack has the powers?
- Well, yeah, but...

969
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:50,244
- You knew about this?
- Yeah.

970
01:03:50,269 --> 01:03:52,011
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I dunno.

971
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,288
We're your kids.
We need to know these things.

972
01:03:54,313 --> 01:03:56,310
- You tell mom?
- No! - Why not?

973
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:58,781
Your mother is not
what we're talking about.

974
01:03:58,806 --> 01:04:01,422
- Why not tell mom?
- Because, I didn't want... - What?

975
01:04:01,447 --> 01:04:03,522
- Because, it's not the time.
- Come on, man. - Why?

976
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,256
- Because ...
- It's, so, uncool.

977
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:07,385
Because I'm fomulating OK?

978
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:10,107
I'm taking in information,
I'm processing.

979
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:12,508
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend

980
01:04:12,534 --> 01:04:15,223
and keeping the baby from
turning into a flaming monster.

981
01:04:15,248 --> 01:04:17,141
How do I do it?

982
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:22,165
By rolling with the punches, baby!
I ain't doing no crash landing, OK? *

983
01:04:22,197 --> 01:04:27,415
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible,
not Mr. Softsoap, or Mr. Mediocre Guy.

984
01:04:27,505 --> 01:04:30,610
Mr. Incredible!

985
01:04:31,426 --> 01:04:33,326
We should call Lucius.

986
01:04:33,893 --> 01:04:38,921
No! I can handle it.
There's no way I'm gonna...

987
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:51,884
I'm gonna call Lucius.

988
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:57,805
Looks normal to me.
When did this start happening?

989
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,696
- Well, since Helen got the job.
- I assume she knows.

990
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:02,992
Are you kidding?
I can't tell her about this.

991
01:05:03,017 --> 01:05:04,632
Not while she's doing hero work.

992
01:05:04,657 --> 01:05:05,795
Mama.

993
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,084
<i>Girls, come on. Leave the saving
of the world to the men?!</i>

994
01:05:08,109 --> 01:05:09,705
I don't think so!

995
01:05:10,093 --> 01:05:13,187
I've got to succeed so she can succeed.

996
01:05:13,394 --> 01:05:15,294
So we... can succeed.

997
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:17,340
I get it, Bob. I get it.

998
01:05:17,365 --> 01:05:18,936
When was the last time you slept?

999
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:20,730
Who keeps track of that?

1000
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:24,583
Besides, he's a baby, I can handle it.
I got this handled.

1001
01:05:24,623 --> 01:05:26,787
So... you're good then?

1002
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:29,581
You got everything under control,
right?

1003
01:05:31,907 --> 01:05:33,841
What the?!...

1004
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:36,229
Okay, Jack-Jack want a cookie?

1005
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:39,178
Yum-yum, cookie. Jack-Jack...

1006
01:05:39,323 --> 01:05:40,884
Yum-yum, cookie.

1007
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:42,131
Cookie.

1008
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,899
- You're not?... -  Cookie.
- Oh my God!

1009
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:47,272
Woah, daddy!

1010
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,328
So, he can hear you...

1011
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,612
from the other dimension. Yeah.

1012
01:05:52,665 --> 01:05:54,694
That, is creepy. And that's not good.

1013
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:57,740
Not like our other kids. No, it is not!

1014
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,006
Full power: totally random.

1015
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:02,833
So, now he's, what ... *physically there?

1016
01:06:02,857 --> 01:06:04,882
Yeah, well, you'd think so, right?

1017
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:08,134
Obviously, I can't keep giving him cookies!

1018
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:10,496
But if I stop...

1019
01:06:15,217 --> 01:06:18,543
No! No biting, dad. Don't bite!

1020
01:06:24,858 --> 01:06:26,305
OK.

1021
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,557
I think I just need a little bit of
me time.

1022
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:32,182
Then I'll be good to go.

1023
01:06:32,207 --> 01:06:34,468
Oh, you need more than me time, Bob.

1024
01:06:34,499 --> 01:06:37,770
You need major life realignment
on a number of levels.

1025
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:40,170
Starting with baby super-freak,
here!

1026
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:44,155
You need some solid
outside the box thinking.

1027
01:06:52,762 --> 01:06:54,333
Galbaki?

1028
01:06:54,372 --> 01:06:58,363
Elastigirl's supersuit is by Galbaki?!

1029
01:06:58,533 --> 01:07:00,527
Explain yourself.

1030
01:07:02,924 --> 01:07:05,946
Bob Parr, son, you're
worse than I thought*.

1031
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:09,098
It's the baby. I brought the baby.

1032
01:07:10,849 --> 01:07:12,752
Highly unusual.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,407
You look ghastly Robert Parr.

1034
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:25,861
I broke my daughter.

1035
01:07:25,886 --> 01:07:27,746
They keep changing math.

1036
01:07:27,863 --> 01:07:31,082
I need AA batteries, but I got AAAs

1037
01:07:31,162 --> 01:07:33,732
So, I still need AA batteries.

1038
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:38,044
Put one red thing with a load of
whites, now everything's pink.

1039
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:39,519
There's not many eggs....

1040
01:07:39,568 --> 01:07:43,066
Done properly, parenting is a heroic act.

1041
01:07:43,324 --> 01:07:45,029
Done 'properly'.

1042
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:48,122
And fortunately,
it has never affected me.

1043
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:52,308
But, you do not come to me for
eggs and batteries, Robert.

1044
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,263
I designing hero wear, and
Elastigirl must have a new suit!

1045
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,701
Actually it's Jack-Jack.

1046
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:01,961
You also wish a new suit for the baby?

1047
01:08:01,986 --> 01:08:05,183
I would hardly classify this
as an emergency.

1048
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:08,510
Well, it's a special case,
worth studying.

1049
01:08:08,572 --> 01:08:10,928
If I could just leave him
with you for a while.

1050
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,084
Leave him?! Here?!

1051
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:15,930
I'm not a baby person, Robert.

1052
01:08:15,955 --> 01:08:18,860
I have no baby facilties.
I am an artist.

1053
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:22,108
I do not involve myself in
the prosaic day-to-day....

1054
01:08:31,519 --> 01:08:33,894
Did *you see this, Robert?

1055
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:48,843
My God!

1056
01:08:49,278 --> 01:08:50,724
Yes.

1057
01:08:50,749 --> 01:08:53,695
Of course you can leave the baby
overnight, after all filling in for Helen

1058
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,223
is challenging and
you are very tired

1059
01:08:55,248 --> 01:08:58,094
and the other children need you and miss
you and need you close to them.

1060
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:00,158
Auntie Edna will take
care of everything

1061
01:09:00,183 --> 01:09:03,117
so drive carefully and good bye,
I enjoy our visits.

1062
01:09:05,263 --> 01:09:07,472
'Auntie' Edna?

1063
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:13,667
Attention, attention.

1064
01:09:13,911 --> 01:09:16,331
I wanna thank everyone
that came out, tonight,

1065
01:09:16,356 --> 01:09:21,273
in support of superheroes and
bringing them back into society.

1066
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:22,900
You all made it happen.

1067
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,118
And the need for this has
been made crystal clear

1068
01:09:25,143 --> 01:09:27,024
in recent days,
with bad actors, like

1069
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:29,993
the self proclaimed Screenslaver,
threatening our peace.

1070
01:09:30,026 --> 01:09:32,096
His reign was short, huh?

1071
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,870
I think* to this woman, a great super,

1072
01:09:34,895 --> 01:09:36,863
You love her, you missed her.

1073
01:09:36,888 --> 01:09:39,644
Welcome back, Elastigirl!

1074
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:42,843
Come on up here.
Don't be bashful.

1075
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:44,750
Come on, get up here.

1076
01:09:46,068 --> 01:09:48,142
I want you to have this.

1077
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:50,345
A memento.

1078
01:09:50,404 --> 01:09:54,019
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
*I never would've guessed it.

1079
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:56,092
I'm forever in your debt.

1080
01:09:56,117 --> 01:10:00,490
And thanks to all of you. Your
*pressure changed all the right minds.

1081
01:10:00,745 --> 01:10:03,311
We made amazing headway
in a very short time,

1082
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:06,205
which leads me to an
important announcement.

1083
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:08,961
Just now, at a world-wide summit,

1084
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:12,387
leaders from more than a hundred
of the world's top countries

1085
01:10:12,412 --> 01:10:16,065
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again!

1086
01:10:17,293 --> 01:10:19,518
We'll gather superheroes
and leaders

1087
01:10:19,543 --> 01:10:22,239
from all over the planet
on our boat the Everjust,

1088
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:25,442
for a televised signing
ceremony at sea!

1089
01:10:25,943 --> 01:10:29,833
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

1090
01:10:35,133 --> 01:10:37,158
Hey, hi... me again...

1091
01:10:37,351 --> 01:10:40,732
Um, there's ... something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1092
01:10:40,757 --> 01:10:44,470
How do you balance the superhero
stuff with *your life?

1093
01:10:44,713 --> 01:10:46,760
*I'd really like to know.

1094
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:53,199
Uhuh... Oh, would you, please,
excuse me for a moment?

1095
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:57,108
Yeah, OK, see you later.* Good talk.

1096
01:11:17,799 --> 01:11:20,127
- Hey, Vi.
- Hey.

1097
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:23,756
- Where's Jack-Jack?
- E's taking him for a little bit.

1098
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,068
- Edna is babysitting?
- Yeah.

1099
01:11:26,093 --> 01:11:28,186
And you're OK with this?

1100
01:11:28,465 --> 01:11:30,536
Yeah, I dunno why.

1101
01:11:32,972 --> 01:11:35,773
I wanted to say something to you.

1102
01:11:36,768 --> 01:11:38,468
Sorry about Tony.

1103
01:11:39,283 --> 01:11:42,045
I didn't think about
Dicker erasing his memory,

1104
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:45,170
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice

1105
01:11:45,195 --> 01:11:46,701
you never made.

1106
01:11:46,726 --> 01:11:49,359
It's not fair, I know.

1107
01:11:49,579 --> 01:11:53,126
And then I made it worse at the
restaurant by trying to ...

1108
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:55,119
Anyway, anyway...

1109
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,907
I'm sorry.

1110
01:11:56,972 --> 01:12:00,066
I'm used to knowing what
the right thing to do is.

1111
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:03,539
But now, I'm not sure, anymore.

1112
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,820
I just wanna be...

1113
01:12:07,966 --> 01:12:09,831
a good dad.

1114
01:12:13,284 --> 01:12:15,555
You're not good,...

1115
01:12:17,302 --> 01:12:19,257
you're super.

1116
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:31,358
Are superheroes allowed to
drink on duty?

1117
01:12:31,383 --> 01:12:34,334
I am, definitely, not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

1118
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:35,990
I know, I should be up there,

1119
01:12:36,015 --> 01:12:39,087
but, I had to step away from
the *primp and glitter, you know?

1120
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:42,216
Gotta get away to keep it pure.
I know I do.

1121
01:12:42,343 --> 01:12:44,208
What are you getting away from?

1122
01:12:44,245 --> 01:12:47,228
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

1123
01:12:47,259 --> 01:12:48,553
But you love him.

1124
01:12:48,578 --> 01:12:50,585
You two *are this company.
Yin and Yang.

1125
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:53,139
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people:

1126
01:12:53,164 --> 01:12:57,151
pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

1127
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,560
I never know what people want.

1128
01:12:59,595 --> 01:13:01,620
What do you think they want?

1129
01:13:01,883 --> 01:13:06,079
Ease. People will trade quality
for ease, every time.

1130
01:13:06,104 --> 01:13:09,147
It may be crap, but,
hey, it's convenient!

1131
01:13:09,172 --> 01:13:10,916
Yeah, kinda like this case.

1132
01:13:10,941 --> 01:13:13,967
- What the Screenslaver?
- Yeah, something doesn't seem right.

1133
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:15,743
It was too easy.

1134
01:13:15,768 --> 01:13:17,813
That was too easy?

1135
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:20,720
- Finally.
- What?

1136
01:13:20,745 --> 01:13:22,251
What is that?

1137
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:26,850
It's one of the Screenslaver's
monitors it's tuned into my suit-cam.

1138
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,684
- Isn't the suit-cam closed circuit?
- Yes.

1139
01:13:31,709 --> 01:13:34,300
Then, how come the Screenslaver has it?

1140
01:13:34,337 --> 01:13:36,149
Maybe he hacked it?

1141
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:38,816
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that,

1142
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:41,283
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

1143
01:13:41,335 --> 01:13:43,303
Maybe he wanted you to find him.

1144
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:44,934
He wanted to get caught?

1145
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:48,023
- He wanted you to win.
- That makes no sense.

1146
01:13:48,067 --> 01:13:52,153
He's a brilliant guy. If he's smart enough
to conceive of technology like this,

1147
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,987
he's smart enough think of
something to do with it.

1148
01:13:55,012 --> 01:13:56,980
The guy we put put in jail
delivered pizzas.

1149
01:13:57,005 --> 01:13:59,295
So? Einstein was a patent clerk! He...

1150
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,824
Look, you won.

1151
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:02,748
- You've got the guy...
- Wait!

1152
01:14:02,773 --> 01:14:05,435
All Screenslaver needs to do,
to hypnotize someone,

1153
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,709
is get a screen in front of their eyes.

1154
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:11,597
But, what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

1155
01:14:14,126 --> 01:14:18,406
What if... the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy

1156
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:22,046
but, he was controlled by the
screens built into his glasses...?

1157
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:24,617
You are good.

1158
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:30,558
<i>Look, a robot. It's taking off.</i>

1159
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,409
<i>I'm not getting a reading, yet.</i>

1160
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:34,027
<i>- Fire?
- Now.</i>

1161
01:14:36,379 --> 01:14:37,748
<i>More power.</i>

1162
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,289
<i>I hope it works dad.</i>

1163
01:14:40,895 --> 01:14:43,486
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

1164
01:14:43,662 --> 01:14:45,951
17 hours!

1165
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:47,880
How do you feel?

1166
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:50,365
Super.

1167
01:14:50,435 --> 01:14:52,302
<i>-You got it, dad!
- Hurray!</i>

1168
01:14:53,265 --> 01:14:57,258
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
you watching Jack-Jack for me, E.

1169
01:14:57,283 --> 01:15:00,252
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

1170
01:15:00,277 --> 01:15:04,223
Don't ask me to do it again, darling,
my rates are far too high.

1171
01:15:04,259 --> 01:15:07,033
I am joking, Robert,
I enjoyed the assignment.

1172
01:15:07,058 --> 01:15:10,486
He is bright and I am stimuated,
we deserve each other.

1173
01:15:11,085 --> 01:15:13,106
You child is a polymorph.

1174
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:15,846
Like all babies, he has
enormous potential.

1175
01:15:15,871 --> 01:15:19,322
It's not unknown for supers to have
more than one power, when young,

1176
01:15:19,347 --> 01:15:21,467
but, this little one has many.

1177
01:15:22,114 --> 01:15:25,374
Yes, you have many powers?

1178
01:15:34,014 --> 01:15:36,274
Ba ba ba...

1179
01:15:39,153 --> 01:15:42,685
I understand your lack of sleep
is *confusing you, Robert.

1180
01:15:42,716 --> 01:15:46,013
Babies can be anything,
and your child is no exception.

1181
01:15:46,078 --> 01:15:48,789
Shows unlimited potential, Robert.

1182
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:51,633
That's why I worked in a creative fever.

1183
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,029
Auntie E has stayed
up all night,

1184
01:15:54,054 --> 01:15:57,075
making sure you look
fabulous in your *uniform

1185
01:15:57,112 --> 01:15:59,269
What're...
You're putting him in...

1186
01:15:59,294 --> 01:16:00,710
In the chamber, Robert.

1187
01:16:00,735 --> 01:16:03,763
He is part of the demonstration
and will be fine.

1188
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:06,246
Your challenge is to manage
a baby who has

1189
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,759
multiple powers and no control
over them, yes?

1190
01:16:10,073 --> 01:16:12,056
Well, uh...That sums it up.

1191
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:16,142
I often work to music, and I noticed
the baby responds to it as well.

1192
01:16:16,423 --> 01:16:18,678
Specifically Mozart.

1193
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:24,121
I blended kevlar with *carbide for
durability under duress and comfort also.

1194
01:16:24,364 --> 01:16:27,854
Interwoven with these fabrics,
are a mesh of tiny sensors

1195
01:16:27,879 --> 01:16:30,857
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

1196
01:16:30,956 --> 01:16:33,925
Oh Lord ! What's he... what is he doing?

1197
01:16:33,952 --> 01:16:36,848
Well, it's Mozart, Robert!
Can you blame him?

1198
01:16:36,873 --> 01:16:39,160
The important thing is
that the suit and tracker

1199
01:16:39,185 --> 01:16:41,301
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

1200
01:16:41,348 --> 01:16:44,073
Oh no! Cookies, I gotta get cookies!

1201
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:48,324
You do not need cookies, as I learned
quite painfully, last night.

1202
01:16:48,349 --> 01:16:53,065
Any solution involving cookies will
inevitably result in the demon phase.

1203
01:16:54,957 --> 01:16:57,995
"Combustion imminent"?
What does that mean?

1204
01:16:58,478 --> 01:17:02,532
It means fire, Robert.
Though, the suit has ...*

1205
01:17:02,611 --> 01:17:05,148
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames,

1206
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:07,718
before he tests the
sprinkler system.

1207
01:17:10,065 --> 01:17:13,577
Flame retardant
blackberry-lavender foam.

1208
01:17:13,638 --> 01:17:16,293
Effective, edible and delicious .

1209
01:17:16,419 --> 01:17:18,174
Oh, *what's going on in here*

1210
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:19,948
That, is useful.

1211
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:24,568
Although I have doubtlessly ecceded your
expectations for a SINGLE night's work.

1212
01:17:24,593 --> 01:17:28,122
the suit and device contain a few
more features we need to discuss.

1213
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:30,710
Thanks again, E., for everything.

1214
01:17:30,735 --> 01:17:33,349
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, pish-posh, darling.

1215
01:17:33,374 --> 01:17:35,297
Your bill will be covered by my fee

1216
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:38,183
for being Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl
and Frozone's

1217
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:41,119
exclusive designer throughout
the known universe

1218
01:17:41,144 --> 01:17:42,604
and until the end of time.

1219
01:17:42,629 --> 01:17:44,725
But babysitting this one,

1220
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,964
I do for free, darling.

1221
01:18:05,122 --> 01:18:07,723
I would resist the temptation
to stretch,

1222
01:18:07,748 --> 01:18:10,958
the temperature around you
is well below freezing.

1223
01:18:11,218 --> 01:18:13,744
Try to stretch and you'll break.

1224
01:18:13,784 --> 01:18:16,063
So you're the Screenslaver?

1225
01:18:16,294 --> 01:18:18,652
Yes... And no.

1226
01:18:18,854 --> 01:18:23,325
Let's say, I created the character
and pre-recorded the messages.

1227
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,879
Does Winston know?

1228
01:18:24,904 --> 01:18:27,751
That I'm the Screenslaver?
Of course not!

1229
01:18:27,776 --> 01:18:30,014
Can you imagine what
'Mr. Free Enterprise'

1230
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,044
would do with my
hypnosis technology?

1231
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:33,644
Worse than what you're doing?

1232
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:37,829
Hey, I'm using the technology
to destroy people's trust in it.

1233
01:18:37,938 --> 01:18:40,069
Like I'm using superheroes.

1234
01:18:40,124 --> 01:18:42,920
- Who did I put in jail?
- Pizza delivery guy.

1235
01:18:42,945 --> 01:18:44,865
Seemed the right height, build.

1236
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:46,900
He gave you a pretty good fight.

1237
01:18:46,933 --> 01:18:50,603
I should say I gave you
a pretty good fight, through him.

1238
01:18:50,628 --> 01:18:53,270
But, it doesn't bother you that
an innocent man is in jail?

1239
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:54,816
Eh, he was surly.

1240
01:18:55,122 --> 01:18:56,668
And the pizza was cold.

1241
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,191
I counted on you.

1242
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:00,114
That's why you failed.

1243
01:19:00,139 --> 01:19:02,731
- What?
- Why would you count on me?

1244
01:19:02,762 --> 01:19:04,549
Because I built you a bike?

1245
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:07,809
Because my brother knows the words
to your theme song?

1246
01:19:07,834 --> 01:19:09,304
We don't know each other.

1247
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:11,113
But you can count on me, anyway.

1248
01:19:11,138 --> 01:19:13,048
I'm supposed to, aren't I?

1249
01:19:13,073 --> 01:19:16,411
Because you have some strange
abilities and a shiny costume,

1250
01:19:16,516 --> 01:19:20,891
the rest of us are supposed to put
our lives into your gloved hands.

1251
01:19:21,076 --> 01:19:23,237
That's what my father believed.

1252
01:19:23,565 --> 01:19:27,180
When our home was broken into,
my mother wanted to hide.

1253
01:19:27,205 --> 01:19:29,755
Begged my father to use
the safe room.

1254
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:34,176
But, father insisted they call
his superhero friends.

1255
01:19:34,321 --> 01:19:37,081
He died. Pointlessly.

1256
01:19:37,447 --> 01:19:39,120
Stupidly.

1257
01:19:39,145 --> 01:19:41,769
Waiting for heroes to save the day.

1258
01:19:41,794 --> 01:19:45,167
- But, why would?... Your brother...
- IS A CHILD!

1259
01:19:45,379 --> 01:19:49,344
He remembers the time when we had
parents AND superheroes.

1260
01:19:49,634 --> 01:19:53,032
So, like a child,
Winston conflates the two.

1261
01:19:53,147 --> 01:19:56,899
Mommy and Daddy went away,
because supers went away.

1262
01:19:56,924 --> 01:20:01,484
Our sweet parents were fools to put
their lives in anybody else's hands.

1263
01:20:01,528 --> 01:20:03,999
Superheroes keep us weak!

1264
01:20:04,457 --> 01:20:06,387
Are you gonna kill me?

1265
01:20:06,747 --> 01:20:08,606
Nah.

1266
01:20:09,863 --> 01:20:11,401
Using you, is better.

1267
01:20:11,426 --> 01:20:14,471
You're gonna help me
make supers illegal,

1268
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:16,517
forever.

1269
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,090
- Ready? - Ga.
- Laser eyes.

1270
01:20:26,979 --> 01:20:28,657
- Stop!
- Wow!

1271
01:20:28,682 --> 01:20:30,099
Yay, Jack-Jack!

1272
01:20:30,124 --> 01:20:31,696
That's not all. Watch this.

1273
01:20:31,721 --> 01:20:33,748
Jack-Jack, *blaster ready?

1274
01:20:38,735 --> 01:20:40,859
- No way?!
- Crazy cool!

1275
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:43,758
- I get to fire him now!
- Hey, it's demonstration!

1276
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,096
No firing the baby around the house,
you understand?

1277
01:20:47,121 --> 01:20:49,460
This is potentially dangerous.

1278
01:20:49,684 --> 01:20:52,859
We're trying to teach him
to control his powers, OK?

1279
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:54,945
Stop! See the screen?

1280
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,312
He vanished!

1281
01:20:57,337 --> 01:20:58,902
That's really cool!

1282
01:20:58,927 --> 01:21:02,198
OK, good. Use the thing.
See that's called a readout.

1283
01:21:02,223 --> 01:21:05,940
Click. See the readout, dimensions?
See the shape? That's the room.

1284
01:21:05,965 --> 01:21:08,883
See where he is in relation?
So, where is he?

1285
01:21:10,318 --> 01:21:11,837
There!

1286
01:21:12,228 --> 01:21:14,666
OK, come out. Num-num, cookie?

1287
01:21:16,081 --> 01:21:18,671
- Yayy! - Jack-Jack!
- Really cool!

1288
01:21:26,244 --> 01:21:28,171
- Hello?
- Elastigirl's in trouble.

1289
01:21:28,196 --> 01:21:29,670
What? What happened to her?

1290
01:21:29,695 --> 01:21:32,795
Sorry, to tell you on the phone.
Meet me on our ship at Devtech.

1291
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:35,318
The ship at Devtech.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1292
01:21:35,343 --> 01:21:37,278
<i>What's with the ship at Devtech?</i>

1293
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:40,660
Lucius? Bob. Helen's in trouble.
I need someone to watch the kids.

1294
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:43,946
- Suit up, it might get weird.
- I'll be there, ASAP, 15 tops.

1295
01:21:43,971 --> 01:21:46,252
<i>Where are you going, ASAP?</i>

1296
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:48,772
<i>And wearing that suit?</i>

1297
01:21:48,797 --> 01:21:51,697
I gotta go. Be home soon.
Lucius will be here, sooner.

1298
01:21:51,722 --> 01:21:53,938
No firing the baby
around the house, OK?

1299
01:21:53,963 --> 01:21:55,813
What's at the ship at Devtech?

1300
01:21:55,838 --> 01:21:58,157
And why are you in your super suit?

1301
01:22:10,028 --> 01:22:11,644
Is that mom's super suit?

1302
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:13,675
She may need it. You never know.

1303
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,198
What's going on?

1304
01:22:15,293 --> 01:22:19,158
I dunno. But dad called Lucius
AFTER getting a call about mom,

1305
01:22:19,183 --> 01:22:20,658
and then LEFT.

1306
01:22:20,683 --> 01:22:22,512
I thought you renounced superheroes.

1307
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:25,355
Yeah, well, I renounce my
renunciation!

1308
01:22:25,442 --> 01:22:27,230
Put that on.

1309
01:22:38,099 --> 01:22:40,690
Hello there, little fella.

1310
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,153
Hello.

1311
01:22:42,228 --> 01:22:43,785
You kids aren't safe.

1312
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:47,653
- The Deavors sent us to take you...
- Well, isn't that redundant!

1313
01:22:47,977 --> 01:22:51,392
The Deavors just sent ME here
to guard the house.

1314
01:22:53,072 --> 01:22:55,298
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

1315
01:22:55,556 --> 01:22:57,664
I get it, managerial screw-up.

1316
01:22:57,689 --> 01:23:00,681
Tell Winston, I have this*.
You understand, Ms? ...

1317
01:23:00,765 --> 01:23:02,088
Voyd.

1318
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,033
Ms. Voyd1

1319
01:23:04,903 --> 01:23:06,576
*I'll see-ya.

1320
01:23:15,278 --> 01:23:16,852
But, the thing is,

1321
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:19,549
he wants us to bring you, too.

1322
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,193
Hey!

1323
01:23:22,201 --> 01:23:24,473
That isn't gonna hold them long.

1324
01:23:24,643 --> 01:23:26,536
Dash, grab the baby!

1325
01:23:29,285 --> 01:23:30,816
Spread out!

1326
01:23:34,953 --> 01:23:37,594
Dash, we gotta get to my car!

1327
01:23:47,002 --> 01:23:49,327
What? What's going on?

1328
01:23:49,602 --> 01:23:50,927
Little fella?

1329
01:24:09,315 --> 01:24:10,911
It worked!

1330
01:24:16,038 --> 01:24:18,314
Incredibile, windows down!

1331
01:24:19,436 --> 01:24:21,114
Climb in!

1332
01:24:27,227 --> 01:24:31,254
Incredibile, *transport is under your
protection, now. Say your names.

1333
01:24:31,342 --> 01:24:34,119
- Violet Parr.
- Dashiell Robert Parr.

1334
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:40,437
- Lucius!
- Harrgh!

1335
01:24:40,478 --> 01:24:42,261
Incredibile, escape!

1336
01:24:50,537 --> 01:24:52,394
- Fill me in.
- Good news and bad news.

1337
01:24:52,419 --> 01:24:55,655
We found her, she seems physically
fine but she's had an ecounter

1338
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,292
with Screenslaver and she's
acting kinda strange.

1339
01:24:58,317 --> 01:24:59,809
In here.

1340
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,045
Strange, how?

1341
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:13,385
Helen?

1342
01:25:13,846 --> 01:25:15,877
Helen, what are you?...

1343
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:26,185
Helen, it's me.

1344
01:25:42,453 --> 01:25:44,656
Incredibile, pull over.

1345
01:25:50,363 --> 01:25:52,025
We can't go to E's.

1346
01:25:52,307 --> 01:25:54,759
You saw those goggles
they put on Lucius,

1347
01:25:54,784 --> 01:25:56,416
they were wearing them, too.

1348
01:25:56,441 --> 01:25:59,197
They're all under someone's control.

1349
01:25:59,393 --> 01:26:02,476
They've probably done the same
to mom.

1350
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:08,240
OK, bad guys after us,
no mom, no dad, no Lucius.

1351
01:26:08,537 --> 01:26:12,418
But, we have our powers, this car

1352
01:26:13,076 --> 01:26:14,476
and...

1353
01:26:15,636 --> 01:26:17,152
what?

1354
01:26:28,493 --> 01:26:31,482
Incredibile, take us to Devtech!

1355
01:26:34,951 --> 01:26:38,794
Kids have escaped in a tricked out car,
but we got Frozone.

1356
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:41,579
Bring him to the ship at Devtech,
immediately.

1357
01:26:46,672 --> 01:26:49,147
Aww! We missed'em.

1358
01:26:49,322 --> 01:26:53,351
Oh, I wish the Incredibile
could follow that boat.

1359
01:26:55,955 --> 01:26:57,980
- What did you do?
- I dunno.

1360
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:01,480
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

1361
01:27:08,779 --> 01:27:11,755
Wow, this car does anything I say!

1362
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:22,694
- We didn't plan this, well.
- What do you mean? We're here, aren't we?

1363
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,631
Yes, we're here.
We need to be up there.

1364
01:27:27,586 --> 01:27:28,859
Hm...

1365
01:27:29,138 --> 01:27:32,646
I think, the Incredibile has
ejector seats.

1366
01:27:33,509 --> 01:27:35,202
Wait, what? No.

1367
01:27:35,227 --> 01:27:37,952
- Yeah, baby, let's go!
- No, no.

1368
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:47,016
Come on.

1369
01:27:49,901 --> 01:27:51,670
Hello, glad you could come.

1370
01:27:51,695 --> 01:27:53,999
- Welcome to the conference.
- Good to be here.

1371
01:28:03,838 --> 01:28:07,069
Our stars, where are they?
The event's about to start.

1372
01:28:07,094 --> 01:28:09,159
They didn't want to upstage
the others.

1373
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:11,136
<i>They'll join for the signing.</i>

1374
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:14,117
Welcme guests, you're in for a treat.

1375
01:28:14,166 --> 01:28:18,159
This ship is the largest hydrofoil
on the planet.

1376
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:22,819
So, hold onto something because
we're gonna open her up!

1377
01:28:40,755 --> 01:28:42,596
We need to find mom and dad.

1378
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:44,441
Stay here, I'm gonna
search for them.

1379
01:28:44,466 --> 01:28:47,237
Wait, who's gonna watch Jack-Jack?

1380
01:28:47,262 --> 01:28:49,292
Suck it up, I won't be long.

1381
01:28:49,518 --> 01:28:51,879
Wait. What? But, but... Wait!

1382
01:28:51,904 --> 01:28:54,526
This is important,
they are in trouble.

1383
01:28:54,551 --> 01:28:57,593
It's up to us.
'To us', understand?

1384
01:28:57,618 --> 01:29:00,303
Keep him amused, but quiet!

1385
01:29:01,457 --> 01:29:03,027
Ohhh...

1386
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:22,216
Jack-Jack?

1387
01:29:31,563 --> 01:29:33,924
Jack-Jack? Jack-Jack!

1388
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,672
- Jack-Jack.
- *Now, the supers know we're here.

1389
01:30:09,697 --> 01:30:11,008
But, I found mom and dad.

1390
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,675
- Where is Jack-Jack?
- I dunno.

1391
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:15,715
You lost him?
I gave you one thing to do!

1392
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,108
The tracker. Use the tracker.

1393
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,632
- He's going up?
- He's in an elevator.

1394
01:30:23,657 --> 01:30:25,249
Let's go!

1395
01:30:26,926 --> 01:30:29,466
Hey, little baby,
where are your paren...?

1396
01:30:31,795 --> 01:30:33,402
And here they are, folks!

1397
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:37,005
The supers who started
this whole thing.

1398
01:30:37,054 --> 01:30:39,113
<i>I told you they'd be there in time.</i>

1399
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,447
Hey, did you make them new masks?

1400
01:30:41,472 --> 01:30:44,690
Yeah, night vision, etcetera...
They look, good, right?

1401
01:30:44,715 --> 01:30:46,535
So simple, even he can do it.

1402
01:30:46,606 --> 01:30:48,355
And we're back, live, in ...

1403
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:50,509
3, 2, 1.

1404
01:30:50,552 --> 01:30:52,228
This is a momentous occasion.

1405
01:30:52,253 --> 01:30:54,998
We've all managed to
accomplish something

1406
01:30:55,023 --> 01:30:57,669
extraordinarily rare
in today's world:

1407
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,849
we agree on something.

1408
01:31:02,334 --> 01:31:05,645
We agree to undo a bad decision.

1409
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,363
To make sure a few
extraordinarily gifted members

1410
01:31:08,388 --> 01:31:11,357
of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.

1411
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:13,278
To invite them once again,

1412
01:31:13,286 --> 01:31:15,978
to use their gifts to benefit the world.

1413
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:17,403
I thank all of you

1414
01:31:17,428 --> 01:31:20,757
for representing your nation's
commitment to superheroes.

1415
01:31:20,782 --> 01:31:23,241
With special thanks to
Ambassador Salomon.

1416
01:31:23,266 --> 01:31:25,325
Yup, it's OK, let her hear you.

1417
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:27,526
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Ambassador,

1418
01:31:27,551 --> 01:31:29,999
for your early and very crucial support.

1419
01:31:30,024 --> 01:31:32,675
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you

1420
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,498
to be the first signature on the

1421
01:31:34,523 --> 01:31:38,172
International Superhero Accord.

1422
01:31:38,678 --> 01:31:40,225
There it is.

1423
01:31:54,917 --> 01:31:56,401
Holy cow!

1424
01:31:56,426 --> 01:31:59,301
- *He's always on fire.
- Just put him out!

1425
01:32:05,769 --> 01:32:07,451
They're coming.

1426
01:32:16,416 --> 01:32:17,999
Is he okay?

1427
01:32:18,024 --> 01:32:20,913
*Yeah, unless you have a beter idea.

1428
01:32:45,291 --> 01:32:46,714
No!

1429
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,571
Come on, Jack-Jack, we have to go.

1430
01:32:49,596 --> 01:32:51,399
Cookie, num-num?

1431
01:33:04,651 --> 01:33:07,374
- I see him. He's getting away.
- Stand back!

1432
01:33:11,649 --> 01:33:14,275
- Darn it.
- He's heading for mom.

1433
01:33:16,016 --> 01:33:19,603
It is done, the world is super again!

1434
01:33:24,817 --> 01:33:27,609
Group photo, come on.
Group photo, everyone.

1435
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:29,795
Squeeze in, that's it, historic occasion.

1436
01:33:30,284 --> 01:33:31,919
Everyone smile.

1437
01:33:38,616 --> 01:33:40,302
Go for Phase 2.

1438
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:44,309
Years of mandated hiding and
silence have made us bitter.

1439
01:33:44,334 --> 01:33:46,266
You bring us out into the light,

1440
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:49,856
only to clean up the messes your
lack of discipline creates.

1441
01:33:49,881 --> 01:33:52,606
Your bodies and your
character are weak.

1442
01:33:52,631 --> 01:33:56,121
Your promises are empty
and you will pay for it.

1443
01:33:56,146 --> 01:33:59,417
We no longer serve you.
We serve only us.

1444
01:33:59,456 --> 01:34:01,674
May the fittest survive.

1445
01:34:03,814 --> 01:34:05,344
Well, we, uh...

1446
01:34:05,421 --> 01:34:07,872
Some very alarming moments there...

1447
01:34:07,914 --> 01:34:10,583
before the technical difficulties.

1448
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:12,317
Please, bear with us.

1449
01:34:26,567 --> 01:34:29,187
- Mayday, mayday, mayday ...
- Hold it. Let him talk.

1450
01:34:29,219 --> 01:34:31,411
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge. Repeat:...

1451
01:34:31,436 --> 01:34:33,006
Now!

1452
01:34:43,763 --> 01:34:46,380
A little further...
A little further...

1453
01:34:46,413 --> 01:34:48,052
Stop!

1454
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:55,265
What the? A baby?!

1455
01:34:55,414 --> 01:34:57,797
Mom and dad! Uncle Lucius?

1456
01:35:00,678 --> 01:35:02,772
Jack-Jack, no!

1457
01:35:04,695 --> 01:35:08,185
A, superbaby? No, no, no.

1458
01:35:11,649 --> 01:35:14,704
No, no, no, no, put him down!

1459
01:35:15,686 --> 01:35:18,835
- Grab her!
- Mom. - Get Jack-Jack to safety!*

1460
01:35:26,765 --> 01:35:28,327
NO!

1461
01:35:29,456 --> 01:35:32,878
- Hey, it's me!
- Yeah, that's what I thought, last time.

1462
01:35:34,137 --> 01:35:35,655
What?...

1463
01:35:36,459 --> 01:35:38,835
You came for us?

1464
01:35:39,081 --> 01:35:41,537
- Don't be mad.
- Oh sweetie.

1465
01:35:41,764 --> 01:35:43,626
How could I be mad?

1466
01:35:43,861 --> 01:35:45,634
I'm proud.

1467
01:35:46,016 --> 01:35:48,227
Not to break up a tender moment,
but,

1468
01:35:48,252 --> 01:35:50,616
where are we?
Is this Devtech's ship?

1469
01:35:50,641 --> 01:35:52,815
Evelyn Deavor, controls
the Screenslaver,

1470
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:55,469
and until a second ago, us.

1471
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,856
- Where the crew?
<i>- Collision detected, correct course.</i>

1472
01:35:59,914 --> 01:36:01,887
- Did I do that?
- Mom?

1473
01:36:02,067 --> 01:36:04,072
Here, try this.

1474
01:36:04,119 --> 01:36:06,357
<i>Collision detected, correct course.</i>

1475
01:36:07,028 --> 01:36:09,800
Phase 3. Go on phase 3!

1476
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:14,874
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

1477
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:16,944
I went to the house!
You didn't escape?

1478
01:36:16,969 --> 01:36:19,798
- How did you not escape?
- Hey, we saved you!

1479
01:36:19,823 --> 01:36:21,766
Escape? Escape from what?

1480
01:36:24,789 --> 01:36:26,316
Those guys!

1481
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,190
Jack-Jack, has powers?!

1482
01:36:31,215 --> 01:36:33,565
We know. Fight, now, talk later.

1483
01:37:08,523 --> 01:37:10,188
Laser eyes.

1484
01:37:31,374 --> 01:37:32,617
Oh!

1484
01:37:37,574 --> 01:37:40,117
- Come with me, Winston.
- Did I faint?

1485
01:37:40,142 --> 01:37:43,452
- You'll be safe here.
- Safe? Safe from what?

1486
01:37:44,544 --> 01:37:48,315
- What about those diplomats and the supers?
 - Still hypnotized.

1487
01:37:49,036 --> 01:37:50,903
What have you done?

1488
01:37:54,795 --> 01:37:56,746
Evelyn. She's escaping!

1489
01:37:56,771 --> 01:37:59,074
Well, go after her.
Finish your mission.

1490
01:37:59,099 --> 01:38:00,527
I can't just go.

1491
01:38:00,552 --> 01:38:02,121
What about the kids? Jack-Jack?

1492
01:38:02,146 --> 01:38:03,886
- Who's gonna?...
- Mom!

1493
01:38:04,116 --> 01:38:06,039
Go! We've got this.

1494
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:09,475
Voyd, come with me.

1495
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:12,379
- I'll go shut down the engine.
- I'll try to to slow the ship from the bow*.

1496
01:38:12,404 --> 01:38:15,669
Wait, something's missing.
Where the Crusher gone?

1497
01:38:15,735 --> 01:38:17,583
Strap in, now!

1498
01:38:32,778 --> 01:38:34,708
It's for your own good.

1499
01:38:34,764 --> 01:38:36,270
NO!

1500
01:38:36,328 --> 01:38:38,127
This is!

1501
01:38:48,865 --> 01:38:51,731
- Were too late.
- Get me up to the jet.

1502
01:39:15,153 --> 01:39:18,145
Hey, you did this. Can you undo it?

1503
01:39:18,337 --> 01:39:20,185
You want me to un-crush?

1504
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:22,348
What, no one's ever asked
for that?

1505
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:25,098
No, to un-crush is silly!
Why un-crush?

1506
01:39:25,123 --> 01:39:28,288
To get into the engine room. Aw,
forget, it, we don't have enough time.

1507
01:39:28,313 --> 01:39:31,852
What if I said to un-punch someone?
What you do*?

1508
01:39:35,353 --> 01:39:37,140
Welcome aboard Elastigirl.

1509
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,341
Although, we haven't yet
reached our cruising altitude...

1510
01:39:41,298 --> 01:39:43,812
feel free to roam about the cabin.

1511
01:39:44,023 --> 01:39:47,076
*Just relax, I'll take care
of everything.

1512
01:39:47,101 --> 01:39:49,086
We're all about you.

1513
01:39:58,443 --> 01:40:01,726
- I can't get to the engine room.
- Well, we gotta to do something.

1514
01:40:01,751 --> 01:40:03,324
'Cause trying to slow it down
ain't working.

1515
01:40:03,349 --> 01:40:06,487
- Hey, what about turning the boat?
- The steering's been destroyed.

1516
01:40:06,512 --> 01:40:08,744
- Dash means, from the outside.
- Yeah!

1517
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:11,564
If we break off one of the
foils arnd turn the rudder

1518
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,710
we can steer the ship
away from the city.

1519
01:40:13,735 --> 01:40:16,403
- That might work.
- I'll turn the front, you turn the rear.

1520
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:18,708
Using the rudder?
That's under water!

1521
01:40:18,733 --> 01:40:20,946
How am I supposed to?...
Oh, great.

1522
01:40:21,056 --> 01:40:23,115
- Come on, kids.
- Dad!

1523
01:40:23,259 --> 01:40:27,562
I know this is going to work,
but, if it doesn't, and we crash,

1524
01:40:27,587 --> 01:40:31,128
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship.

1525
01:40:31,153 --> 01:40:34,651
I should stay here, with Jack-Jack.

1526
01:40:34,948 --> 01:40:36,431
That's my girl.

1527
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:39,661
Remember Bob,
we're both turning right.

1528
01:40:46,085 --> 01:40:48,178
You know what's sad?

1529
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:53,626
If it weren't for your core beliefs,

1530
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:55,959
I think we copuld've been
good friends.

1531
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:58,315
I wish I ha...

1532
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,940
had core beliefs.

1533
01:41:02,713 --> 01:41:04,252
We have breaking news.

1534
01:41:04,277 --> 01:41:07,916
While there is still no radio contact,
the ship has changed direction

1535
01:41:07,941 --> 01:41:11,095
and is heading towards land
at a high rate of speed.

1536
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:16,551
Dash.

1537
01:41:17,492 --> 01:41:19,373
I am going to the rudder.

1538
01:41:19,398 --> 01:41:22,364
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

1539
01:41:22,389 --> 01:41:25,318
- OK, dad.
- Now, lower me dow ...

1540
01:41:28,312 --> 01:41:31,646
The reputations of superheroes
are ruined.

1541
01:41:31,848 --> 01:41:34,240
You will never become legal.

1542
01:41:34,265 --> 01:41:35,708
Ever!

1543
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:38,350
- Never?
- No.

1544
01:41:38,655 --> 01:41:40,550
- Ever?
- No!

1545
01:41:40,598 --> 01:41:43,688
Not even a little smidgie-widgie?

1546
01:41:43,713 --> 01:41:45,250
Ah, hypoxia!

1547
01:41:45,297 --> 01:41:49,029
When you don't have enough oxygen
things *seem incredibly silly.

1548
01:41:56,416 --> 01:41:59,782
*Things get sillier and sillier
and then you die.

1549
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,382
- I don't wanna die.
- Ah, nobody does.

1550
01:42:04,428 --> 01:42:05,898
Really.

1551
01:42:05,923 --> 01:42:07,993
Not such a bad way to go.

1552
01:42:26,184 --> 01:42:29,059
Everyone, we need to get
to the back of the ship.

1553
01:42:29,099 --> 01:42:31,581
All supers protect
your ambassadors.

1554
01:42:32,428 --> 01:42:33,998
Follow!

1555
01:42:36,402 --> 01:42:39,242
Dad's been underwater for too long.

1556
01:42:46,886 --> 01:42:48,530
Gotta pull him up!

1557
01:42:48,555 --> 01:42:50,464
Wait, it's too soon.

1558
01:43:03,805 --> 01:43:06,902
- I'm gonna press the button!
- Not yet!

1559
01:43:21,387 --> 01:43:23,948
It's turning. It's working!

1560
01:43:26,949 --> 01:43:29,291
- Now!
- Dash, now!

1561
01:43:32,382 --> 01:43:34,630
Save yourself, make a chute.

1562
01:43:37,648 --> 01:43:39,852
Make a chute. Make a chute!

1563
01:43:41,927 --> 01:43:44,337
*Dash, brace yourself!

1564
01:43:51,882 --> 01:43:54,067
*We're out of position!

1565
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:17,865
I missed Jack-Jack's first power?

1566
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:20,851
Actually, you missed the first 17.

1567
01:44:21,522 --> 01:44:22,944
Oh!

1568
01:44:34,095 --> 01:44:37,717
The fact you saved me
doesn't make you right.

1569
01:44:38,284 --> 01:44:42,023
- But, it does make you alive.
- And I'm grateful for that.

1570
01:44:42,135 --> 01:44:44,956
I'm sorry, but she'll go to prison.

1571
01:44:45,221 --> 01:44:47,388
Well, I'm sorry, she's rich
and will probably get

1572
01:44:47,413 --> 01:44:49,178
no more than a slap on the wrist.

1573
01:44:49,203 --> 01:44:51,724
First of all, Violet I like you.

1574
01:44:52,179 --> 01:44:54,999
And who knows what the
future may bring?

1575
01:44:55,114 --> 01:44:58,571
But, I have a good feeling
about all of you.

1576
01:44:59,169 --> 01:45:01,848
Good feeling?
Should we be worried?

1577
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:04,464
You guys got the next shift.
Come here.

1578
01:45:04,489 --> 01:45:06,816
I saw what you did back there,
that was incredible.

1579
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:09,942
- I mean, no pun intended.
- Sorry I had to punch you.

1580
01:45:11,339 --> 01:45:14,198
Ah, *here's my sweet ride!

1581
01:45:27,243 --> 01:45:31,710
And in recognition of the extraordinary
service they have demonstrated,

1582
01:45:31,735 --> 01:45:36,592
the legal status of superheroes
is hereby restored.

1583
01:45:45,357 --> 01:45:49,921
- You don't know me, do you?
- No, I don't, wait ...

1584
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:53,541
- Are you the girl with the water...?
- I'm Violet Parr.

1585
01:45:54,759 --> 01:45:56,294
I'm Tony.

1586
01:46:06,948 --> 01:46:09,267
- Tony, this is my mom.
- Pleased to meet you.

1587
01:46:09,339 --> 01:46:11,673
- It's my dad.
- Oh, we've met.♥

1588
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:14,707
- This is embarrassing.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

1589
01:46:14,732 --> 01:46:16,294
My little brother Dash.

1590
01:46:16,526 --> 01:46:18,618
And baby is Jack-Jack.

1591
01:46:19,219 --> 01:46:22,577
I tried to limit it
to ONE parent.

1592
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:25,140
We're all going to a movie, too, Tony.
Don't mind us.

1593
01:46:25,165 --> 01:46:27,601
We'll be sitting on the other
side of theater.

1594
01:46:27,626 --> 01:46:29,515
- Not watching you.
- Hah!

1595
01:46:30,058 --> 01:46:34,142
H-He's kidding, they're only
dropping us off at the theater.

1596
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:36,872
They have OTHER things to do.

1597
01:46:37,127 --> 01:46:40,772
- So, you guys are close, I guess.
- Yeah, I guess.

1598
01:46:40,797 --> 01:46:43,004
- We can get closer.
- Bob.

1599
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:59,329
Stop! Let us out.

1600
01:46:59,453 --> 01:47:03,492
Here: large popcorn, small soda,
save me a seat. *Center rear preferably

1601
01:47:03,603 --> 01:47:07,244
I'll be back before the
previews are over.

1602
01:47:15,492 --> 01:47:19,609
