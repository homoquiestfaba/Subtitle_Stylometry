17
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:45,569
Well...

18
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:47,472
here we are.

19
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:49,914
You weren't kidding about
it being isolated, geeze.

20
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:52,345
[laughs]
Right? I told you.

21
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,841
It's really out there.

22
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:57,482
[trees creak]

23
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:58,813
What was that?

24
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:02,487
It's nothing. It's...

25
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,357
Just the wind.

26
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,292
Oh.

27
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:06,327
Okay.

28
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:08,922
Huh.
[laughs]

29
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:12,266
It's like that out here.

30
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:15,500
You start to hear things, and...

31
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:17,601
see stuff that

32
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:19,439
isn't really there.

33
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:22,276
Yeah, it's... I could have sworn
I heard something.

34
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:23,838
[laughs awkwardly]

35
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:24,883
I'm pretty sure you didn't.

36
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,412
No, you're probably right.

37
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:27,578
No, I know I'm right.

38
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:31,517
Okay.

39
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:33,848
[laughs]

40
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:36,323
I guess you're used to it,
living this far out of town,

41
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,358
but I'm not like a country guy.

42
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,624
You don't like it.

43
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,023
The silence.

44
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,399
The dark.

45
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,336
No, it's... I like it.

46
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:51,030
I mean, it's nice.
I mean, I like it...

47
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:54,506
Moon is beautiful and all that.

48
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,904
Definitely see more stars
than you do living in the city,

49
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,742
that's for sure, but overall,
I'm more of a...

50
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,942
I like being surrounded
by brick and concrete.

51
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,647
Just feel safer
than living out here.

52
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:05,847
I know that sounds weird,
but it's true.

53
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,455
[chuckles]

54
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:12,722
[inhales]

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Um...

56
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:16,917
Do you want me to walk you
to the door?

57
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,531
I'm happy to.

58
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,962
Oh yeah! Sure, if you want to.

59
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:23,799
I was just,

60
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:25,637
you know,

61
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,375
taking it in.

62
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,070
What's that?

63
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:31,808
The night.

64
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,106
Oh!

65
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:36,482
Yeah. Good. Let's...
[stammers]

66
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:37,517
It's nice.

67
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,650
Sorry.

68
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:40,618
But I live here, so...
[laughs]

69
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:42,422
I can do that anytime.

70
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:43,555
That's true.
[chuckles]

71
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,655
So yeah, let's go in.

72
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,954
In? Yeah, you sure? I mean...

73
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,593
I'm happy to,
but I don't want to be...

74
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:50,859
- What?
- No, no. I...

75
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:52,531
What I mean is...
[clears throat]

76
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:55,336
It was cool to drive you home.
Glad to do it.

77
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:56,799
But I don't need to go in

78
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,406
if it's late or you're...
you know.

79
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:01,442
Well, it's...

80
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:03,542
not about need, right?

81
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,413
It's about...

82
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,449
want.

83
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:10,483
[exhales]
Right.

84
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:12,947
So you want me to?

85
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,521
Do you?

86
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,116
I do.

87
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:19,922
Okay then.

88
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,693
Great then.
Alright, let's... let's do it.

89
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:23,430
Let's.

90
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:24,398
Lead the way.

91
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,060
[laughs] Oh, I have been.
Ever since we met.

92
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:28,897
[chuckles] That's true.

93
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,097
That is very true.

94
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:31,333
[door thuds]

95
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:32,604
You don't mind?

96
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,165
[door thuds]

97
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,936
Hell no! Not at all.

98
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,575
It's very refreshing

99
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:37,815
in this day and age, to...

100
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:39,687
meet someone who's a little bit

101
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:41,811
whatever, forward, I guess?

102
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:42,846
Is that how I seem?

103
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,550
Forward to you?
- No...

104
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:45,782
Not at all in a bad way.

105
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:46,926
I didn't mean that in a bad way.

106
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,270
I just mean,
you don't seem, like,

107
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:50,149
put off by any of this.

108
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,788
This... what?

109
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:53,658
You know, the... come on.

110
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,429
No, say it.

111
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:57,222
Just, like, the game
or whatever, the...

112
00:05:58,797 --> 00:05:59,994
Is this a game to you?

113
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:01,864
[scoffs] Come on now,

114
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:02,799
you're putting words
in my mouth.

115
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:03,932
You just said it.

116
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:05,902
Right, okay, so...
[laughs]

117
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:08,739
So, no. This isn't a game.
I'm not playing with you.

118
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:09,839
Don't worry.

119
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:11,154
I just mean...
- I'm not worried.

120
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Right, but...

121
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:13,777
but you brought it up, so.

122
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:14,812
I just...

123
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:16,549
asked a question, so.

124
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,210
Right, okay. Then no.
[laughs]

125
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,420
This isn't a game.

126
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,982
I'm not playing with you.

127
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,918
I just mean, what happened
between us tonight.

128
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,217
The drinking and the banter,
and...

129
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,197
just the way we responded
to each other right away

130
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,123
without all the bullshit,
and the office politics

131
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,201
that so often comes with it.
- No, I get it.

132
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:31,757
- Right?
- Yeah!

133
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:32,925
It's like... we just...

134
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:35,843
It was so straight forward
right away, right off the bat.

135
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:36,867
No, agreed.

136
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:37,937
- It was great.
- Mhm.

137
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,293
Like, we both knew
what we wanted.

138
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:41,035
We just got down to it.

139
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:42,938
Goddammit,
you don't see too much

140
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,588
of that anymore in the world,
with all the...

141
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,612
Yeah.

142
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:47,481
It's just... Am I...

143
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:48,779
Am I making any sense at all?

144
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:50,077
Total sense.
[sighs]

145
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:50,979
Good.

146
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,014
I know exactly

147
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,521
what you mean.

148
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,556
Thank you.

149
00:06:56,723 --> 00:06:57,788
Very refreshing.

150
00:06:57,823 --> 00:06:59,790
[laughs]
My pleasure.

151
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:02,056
And hey, here we are.

152
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:03,794
Standing outside your...

153
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:05,731
[crow caws]
castle.

154
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:07,600
[laughs] Yep.

155
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,031
Here we are.

156
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:10,604
I haven't... this is...

157
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,935
This is quite a place for a...

158
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,070
You live here?

159
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,577
I do.

160
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,809
It's...

161
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
What?

162
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,275
No, nothing. I'm just...

163
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,914
Just a massive property.

164
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,488
The house is like...

165
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,787
This is a family place, or...?

166
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,691
Stop me if I'm being too nosy.

167
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,660
[chuckles] Correct.

168
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,266
What? It's a family place
or I'm being nosy?

169
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,631
No, you're not being too nosy.

170
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,186
And you can ask me
anything you'd like.

171
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:41,964
Ah, cool. So...

172
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,000
It's been in my family
for years.

173
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,069
Got it.

174
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,642
Okay, that's...
I got it.

175
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:51,578
[chuckles]

176
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:52,579
Why?

177
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:55,813
You don't think I could own
a place like this

178
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:57,243
by myself?

179
00:07:58,587 --> 00:07:59,587
I didn't say that.

180
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,653
Yeah, but...

181
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,786
No, that's not what I...

182
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,019
No, no, go ahead. I'm curious.

183
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:05,801
Look, why don't we talk
about this inside,

184
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:06,390
if we're going.

185
00:08:06,426 --> 00:08:07,792
I'm getting a little...

186
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,288
You know.

187
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,927
Oh, I'm sorry. You must be cold.

188
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:12,291
A little bit, yeah. Are you not?

189
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,261
No, I...

190
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:17,164
I love the cold. I always have.

191
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:20,068
Yeah, you must. You're barely
wearing anything.

192
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,872
I guess. You need a jacket on.

193
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:22,907
It's chilly.

194
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:24,172
Well...

195
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:26,008
let's get you inside.

196
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:28,175
Warm you up.
- Okay.

197
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,242
After you.

198
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,277
[laughs]

199
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:33,983

200
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:39,989
[muffled laughter]
[door creaks]

201
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:41,694
Oh.

202
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,729
[light clicks]

203
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:45,027
Oh, wow. This is beautiful.

204
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:45,962
Ah...

205
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:47,865
[lightbulb sizzles]

206
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,701
[pops]

207
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,130
- Oh.
- Oh.

208
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:51,066
[laughs]

209
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:53,904
Don't worry. The electricity
goes out sometimes.

210
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:54,674
It isn't a problem.

211
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,104
Oh, okay.

212
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:58,172
Is that going to affect
the heat as well, or...?

213
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:00,339
Only cause I pay utilities
at my place.

214
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,374
It's a condo.

215
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,947
And um, so I switch
something on, it comes on.

216
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:05,377
You know? Either that, or I

217
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,983
get right on the phone
with my landlord,

218
00:09:07,018 --> 00:09:08,298
and I start raising hell
[laughs]

219
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,887
right away.

220
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:12,219
No, it's a bit more rustic
out here.

221
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:12,890
Yeah, of course.

222
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:13,957
But...

223
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:16,190
I could light us a fire.

224
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:18,027
Oh... fire.

225
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:19,358
No, it sounds great.

226
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,359
Nice, right?

227
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,230
Absolutely.
[laughs]

228
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:24,935
Perfect.
- Okay. So...

229
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,552
Do you want me to get the...

230
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:28,268
Um, okay.

231
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:32,844
[door creaks]

232
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,911

[shaky breath]

[poker scrapes]
[fire crackles]

236
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:47,992
Oh.

237
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:51,797
[footsteps]

238
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:52,424
[foreboding echo]

239
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:53,459
<i>(Hap) Uh...</i>

240
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:58,134
<i>(Hap) Hey.</i>

241
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:01,541
Hello?

242
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:02,907
[poker clanks]
Everything alright?

243
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,108
I...

244
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:06,912
No, I guess it's...

245
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:08,342
it's the mirror.

246
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,849
[scoffs] I thought
there was, um...

247
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,346
Nothing, just...
[Mina laughs]

248
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,919
Seeing things already?

249
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:16,151
[laughs]

250
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:17,922
I mean, no. I...

251
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,793
Oh, I guess. Yeah.
I guess I did.

252
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:22,224
There was...

253
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:24,126
It's funny, right? It was, like,

254
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,128
I swear there was some...
It was a mirror.

255
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,801
<i>(Mina) It happens.</i>
- Oh yeah?

256
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,297
- You too?
- Sometimes.

257
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,200
I mean, the house is old,
and dark,

258
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:33,366
and full of memories, so.

259
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,807
<i>Right. Yeah.</i>

260
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:36,908
[hums playfully]
[laughs]

261
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,944
It is really cool.

262
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,342
Yeah. Oh!

263
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,081
<i>That was fast.</i>

264
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:45,346
<i>Thank you.</i>

265
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:46,852
Pleasure.

266
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:48,052
<i>Ha-ha!</i>

267
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:49,833
You say that like
you actually mean it.

268
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,318
(mimics) Pleasure.

269
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:52,353
<i>(Mina) I do.</i>

270
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:54,893
Well, thanks then.

271
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,730
I always say what I mean.

272
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:58,128
Don't you?

273
00:10:58,294 --> 00:10:59,294
[scoffs]

274
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:01,460
Are we being recorded right now?

275
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,497
No.

276
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,004
Why?
- No, I'm kidding.

277
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:10,172
I was like, making a joke
about being...

278
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,208
[fire hisses]

279
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
I see.

280
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:16,277
Because if we were,

281
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,818
you'd have to lie about it.

282
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,547
Right?

283
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:23,285
I mean...

284
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,055
something like that, yeah.

285
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:30,127
So...

286
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:34,263
You are a liar then?

287
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,297
No! That's not...

288
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:38,035
[scoffs]

289
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,498
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Um...

290
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,500
Liar is a little bit
harsh maybe.

291
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,535
<i>(Mina) Maybe?</i>

292
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,372
I'm a fibber, sometimes.

293
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,276
How did we get on this subject?

294
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,090
Does it make you uncomfortable?

295
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:51,444
I mean, kinda.

296
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:53,479
Not a lot, it's not

297
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,085
my favorite subject.

298
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:58,858
[fire crackles]

299
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:01,829
Understood.

300
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,060
[blows]

301
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:04,095
Yeah.

302
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,031
Little white lies.

303
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:08,934
Fibs. Just leaving stuff
out on occasion.

304
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:09,902
That's the kind of thing
I'm talking about.

305
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,970
I'm definitely not what
you would call a liar.

306
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,500
Cross my heart.
Hope to die.

307
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:16,843
I get it. I understand.

308
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:18,538
- Yeah?
- I do.

309
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,078
Okay.

310
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,343
You're not gonna

311
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:22,711
throw me back out into the cold,

312
00:12:22,747 --> 00:12:24,180
now that you know
the ugly truth?

313
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,380
I think I can handle it.

314
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:29,086
I won't lie to you.

315
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:30,121
I promise.

316
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,155
Not tonight anyway.
[chuckles]

317
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:41,230
Wanna sit on the couch, or...

318
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:43,969
on the floor by the fire?

319
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,203
You decide. If you want.

320
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:49,107
No pressure.

321
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:53,309
We can sit.

322
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:56,114
Cool, okay.

323
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:03,516
[laughs]
There.

324
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:05,156
Cool.

325
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:08,554
This is so nice.

326
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,034
Do you want a drink?

327
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,169
Absolutely.

328
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:20,335
Perfect. [chuckles]

329
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,140
- Uh...
- What would you like?

330
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:25,176
What do you have?

331
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:26,947
Most anything.

332
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:28,112
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

333
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:30,081
Oh, alright then.
How 'bout a...

334
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:32,116
Maker's Mark, neat.

335
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,481
That I can do.

336
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:35,856
- Yeah.
- Mhm.

337
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:37,050
You want some help?

338
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,287
No, no, I can get it.

339
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:39,156
You stay warm.

340
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:40,191
- You sure.
- Mhm.

341
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,653
Yeah, absolutely.

342
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,420
Okay.

343
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:44,293
That's not...
- It's no trouble.

344
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,032
- If you don't mind.
- More than that.

345
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,463
I insist.

346
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:53,566
Okay. Then you... go for it.
[chuckles]

347
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:54,941
Wait, wait. Sorry, I...

348
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,614
I'm just trying to get
a handle on this place,

349
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,176
so forgive me, but um...

350
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:02,575
Is this like a summer house,
or a...?

351
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:04,116
Do you guys...?

352
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:06,117
I don't get it.

353
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,283
[laughs]

354
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,022
Mm... my family's very...

355
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,519
[sighs]

356
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:14,026
We have several of these -

357
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:15,929
<i>what would you call them?</i>

358
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:17,557
<i>Estates?</i>

359
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:20,666
<i>Scattered around throughout
the country, and...</i>

360
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,331
Um...

361
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:24,366
I'm at this one

362
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,171
right now,

363
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:28,338
living here.

364
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,538
Does that make sense?

365
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:33,078
[Hap laughs]

366
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:36,983
Not exactly. Not to my...

367
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:38,710
lower-middle class,

368
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,514
public school upbringing,
but um,

369
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:43,649
I, overall, get what you mean.
Yeah.

370
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,255
You're...

371
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,059
You're rich.
[laughs]

372
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:48,621
That's pretty subjective.

373
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:49,589
<i>- True, but...</i>
- But,

374
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:51,690
yeah, okay. I'm rich,

375
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,198
or my family is, anyway, so.

376
00:14:55,036 --> 00:14:57,366
I'm in line to be rich,

377
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:00,534
or whatever?
[giggles]

378
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:01,569
<i>You get what I'm saying?</i>

379
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:03,438
Yeah, I do.

380
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:05,077
Absolutely, yeah.

381
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:09,609
Drinks.

382
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:11,952
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Okay.

383
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:14,218
- Neat.
- Please.

384
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:16,154
[chuckles]

385
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:22,028
[footsteps]

386
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,197
[sighs] Oh my God...

387
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,431
Holy shit.

388
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,664
[laughs]

389
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:33,469

392
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:40,343
Oh my God.

393
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:43,742
Oh my God.

[fire crackles]

395
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,154
Shit.

396
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:51,750
[dialtone]

397
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,391
Hey man! What's up?

398
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:57,328
Um...

399
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,758
Yes! [laughs]

400
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,002
Yeah, I did.

401
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,696
I did too.

402
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:06,336
Uh, I'm with her now actually.

403
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:09,273
No, I'm not fucking lying.
[scoffs]

404
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:12,342
No, I'm not making it up.
Fuck you.

405
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,740
No, no, no...

406
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:15,775
she asked me.

407
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,744
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

408
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,417
She asked me. That's how...

409
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:23,716
Yeah. Unreal.

410
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,388
I know!

411
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:27,621
Shut up, I know!

412
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:29,755
What? Wait, wait,
say it again?

413
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:32,263
Shit! Sorry, you're cutting out.

414
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:34,034
I'm in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

415
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,169
Well,

416
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,566
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

417
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:42,207
Uh, you know, you should have
gone after her first.

418
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:44,242
Whatever goes to the...

419
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:48,444
bold, or however
that stupid saying goes.

420
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,512
What I mean is, here I am,

421
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:53,845
and there you are,
still at the bar,

422
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,452
and I'm about to get a drink
brought to me

423
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:58,784
by this beautiful girl

424
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,127
in this beautiful, old house,

425
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:03,624
and later, if I'm lucky,

426
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,857
and I think I'm gonna be,

427
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,463
I'm gonna get my brains
fucked out

428
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:09,102
on a beautiful, old couch

429
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:11,104
in front of a roaring...
[house creaks]

430
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:12,139
Hello?

431
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:15,405
Hello?

432
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,209
[distant creaks]

433
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:20,509
No, sorry. No, I... you...
Sorry.

434
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:21,686
I thought she came back
into the room.

435
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,809
Um, nothing. I gotta go, anyway.

436
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,382
Yeah.

437
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,748
Okay, we'll discuss at lunch,
or whatever.

438
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:30,519
You know so.

439
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:34,160
We always do! Yes!

440
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:36,195
[giggles] Yeah.

441
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,758
I'll give you the play by play.
Of course.

442
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:41,332
Yeah, yeah, duh.

443
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,531
I've got eyes, my friend.

444
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,599
She's so fucking hot.

445
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,700
Oh, and like,

446
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:50,176
weird and different, and...

447
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:53,344
I mean, not to rub it in,
but you would...

448
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:56,545
Yeah, she's pretty incredible.

449
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,878
Me either. I can't wait.

450
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:01,847
Yeah. Well, anyway,

451
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,222
uh, you have fun.

452
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:05,191
[cackles]

453
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:06,852
I can't help it.

454
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,327
Oh shut up! You'd do
the same thing to me,

455
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:10,362
if it was you.

456
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:13,199
Please! You would too.

457
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:16,400
Yeah, yeah.
[laughs]

458
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,371
No, I can't promise you... What?

459
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:23,242
Pictures? You want me
to send you pictures?

460
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:24,507
No!

461
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,905
Don't be a dick. No!

462
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:29,787
Oh yeah, you want to
come over here?

463
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,283
I bet you do.

464
00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:34,847
Yeah, I don't even know
the address,

465
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:36,717
even if I wanted
to give it to you,

466
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:38,521
which I don't.
[chuckles]

467
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:43,328
No, I'm a little bit, you know,
hammered, and

468
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,166
she just gave me directions.

469
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,333
I drove. Yeah.

470
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,699
Anyway, I gotta go.
She's gonna come back soon.

471
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,833
Yes, okay.

472
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:55,737
Yes.

473
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,607
Okay, yeah! I will, um...

474
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:00,312
I'll talk later. Yep.

475
00:19:00,644 --> 00:19:01,874
Okay.

476
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,777
Oh, wait, wait, hold on!
Guess what else!

477
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,251
She's also rich.

478
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:06,252
Yes!

479
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:07,583
[cackles]

480
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:08,749
Asshole.

481
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,256
Okay, bye.

482
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,291
Bye!

483
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:12,819
I'm not!

484
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:14,390
I'm not!

485
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:16,691
Okay, I'll see you
tomorrow. Bye.

486
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:17,924
[phone clicks]

487
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:19,628
[chuckles]

488
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:21,531
Yeah, I suppose.

489
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:25,766
[exhales]

490
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,507
Oh my God.

493
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,748
Oh, hey.

00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:44,521
[footsteps]

495
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,358
Great, thank you so much.

496
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,393
Pleasure.

497
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,791
Cheers. To us.
[glasses clink]

498
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:52,232
To us.

499
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,498
[laughs awkwardly]

500
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:00,669
Mm... [coughs] Whoa.

501
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:01,704
That's good.

502
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:03,705
[Mina hums]
Thank you.

503
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,542
You're welcome.

504
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:09,381

508
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:32,602
God, you are a great kisser.

509
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,275
Thank you.

510
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,312

512
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:42,007
So are you.
[Hap chuckles]

513
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:44,351
Thanks.

514
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,000
I was hoping you'd say that.

515
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:48,849
Even if it wasn't true.
[laughs]

516
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,016
I told you. I don't lie.

517
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,523
Oh yeah, that's right.

518
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:53,887
Alright, well, even better then.

519
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,362
Thank you.

520
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:58,496
You're welcome.

[smacks lips]
[sighs]

522
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,667
Um...

523
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:07,032
Were you talking
to someone earlier?

524
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,342
When I was out there
making drinks?

525
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:10,377
No.

526
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:11,576
Really?

527
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:15,645
Oh no! I s... um...

528
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:20,078
[stammers] No, he...
I got a text earlier.

529
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,651
Yeah, cause you...

530
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:23,048
Cell service is really bad here.

531
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,115
Um...

532
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,216
So that's all.

533
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,690
<i>I just got a text
from a friend of mine.</i>

534
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,021
Oh.

535
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:30,891
<i>So, I was just, you know.</i>

536
00:21:31,597 --> 00:21:33,861
I thought I heard
your voice, so...

537
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,533
Oh no, I didn't finish,

538
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:38,899
so I read the text,
and then I called him back.

539
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,605
<i>- I see.</i>
- Yeah.

540
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:44,938
You're not married, are you?

541
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:47,512
[scoffs] No, no, it was just
a friend.

542
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,811
A friend? Okay.

543
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:51,010
Yeah.

544
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,583
Seriously, no, it was.

545
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:54,145
It was a guy that I work with,

546
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,883
who happened to be at the bar,
and um,

547
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,061
I told him that I left with you.

548
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,118
He was actually very jealous.

549
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,725
- Oh, okay. Good. [laughs]
- Yeah, he was pissed.

550
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,826
Yeah, no. He texted me,

551
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:07,433
and I gave him a quick call,
just to let him know that I...

552
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:09,930
I wasn't going
back there tonight.

553
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:11,734
Cause he had noticed
that I was gone,

554
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,175
and he just wanted to make sure
everything was cool.

555
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,440
Ah.

556
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:15,705
- Yeah.
- Did you

557
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,036
go there together, or...?

558
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:19,973
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I just ran into him at the...

559
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:22,041
So, I let him know that I left,

560
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:23,680
and I was okay.

561
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:25,880
More than okay, so...

562
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,553
Yeah.

563
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:28,685
That's what you heard.

564
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:31,820
Okay, good. So I wasn't
hearing things then.

565
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,592
No! Not at all.
I did do that.

566
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,763
So...
[laughs awkwardly]

567
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:43,865
You didn't really answer
my question.

568
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:45,933
Did... that's...

569
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,803
Uh, what do you mean?

570
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,135
About being married.

571
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,039
That's because I was
explaining the call.

572
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:54,678
Uh, the voice that you heard.

573
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:56,075
- Right.
- That's why.

574
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,451
But that's done now though, so.
- Mhm.

575
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:00,750
Can you answer me?
[laughs]

576
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:02,081
Um...

577
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,116
Are you married?

578
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,921
[glass clinks]
Yeah, I'm...

579
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,890
No, I'm not

580
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,123
<i>married.</i>

581
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:13,093
You're not?

582
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:15,061
I'm, uh... not at the moment.

583
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,999
Not at the moment.

584
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:21,474
[laughs nervously]
That sounds weird.

585
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,475
I'm not lying.

586
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,938
<i>I'm separated.</i>

587
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,676
Separated?

588
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:27,909
Yeah, it's the...
It's the legal term.

589
00:23:30,914 --> 00:23:31,880
Does your wife know?

590
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,178
Ha-ha.

591
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:36,588
Oh, very funny.
Yeah, she's aware.

592
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,721
She's definitely aware.

593
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:39,052
[chuckles]
Okay, got it.

594
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:42,088
It's like a legal separation.
It's a real thing.

595
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:44,563
It's not just something
I made up in my mind

596
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:45,927
for convenience sake, when I'm

597
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:47,764
out on the town, or something.

598
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:50,602
<i>It's registered
at the courthouse.</i>

599
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,637
<i>Lawyers involved
and everything, so.</i>

600
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:53,935
- Understood.
- Yeah.

601
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:55,871
So this isn't...

602
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,741
We can do this.

603
00:23:58,546 --> 00:23:58,841
What's that?

604
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:00,777
No, just like...

605
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,240
whatever this is.

606
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:04,078
Meet-up.

607
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:05,980
<i>Have a drink.</i>

608
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:06,915
<i>Talk.</i>

609
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,950
Fuck?

610
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:09,017
Fuck.

611
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:10,755
Yeah.

612
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:11,920
Uh, that too.

613
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:14,659
There's no law against it.

614
00:24:16,157 --> 00:24:17,157
Well.

615
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,795
Not on the books anyway.

616
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:21,971
Maybe like moral ones,
and that kind of thing, like,

617
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:23,712
would this be
considered cheating?

618
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:25,538
Something like that.

619
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:27,166
Yeah, well, you know,

620
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:28,201
[glass clinks]

621
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:31,214
I try not to think too much
about that kind of stuff.

622
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,777
The little shit, like, morality.

623
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:35,174
[chuckles]
Well, that's good.

624
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,879
That makes this
a whole lot easier then.

625
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,716
Hm. [clears throat]

626
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:40,911
What's the... what's the this
that you're referring to?

627
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:43,183
This.

628
00:24:44,152 --> 00:24:45,019
Us.

629
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:46,054
Hm.

630
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:47,154
You picking me up.

631
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:51,058
Uh, technically, I think
you picked me up.

632
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,599
Mm.

633
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:53,560
Did I?

634
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,601
I think so, yeah.

635
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:57,042
You asked me to give you
a ride home, which is...

636
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,199
<i>Well, that's true.</i>

637
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:00,639
Before that, we were just
sitting at the bar and chatting.

638
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,037
Hm. Yeah, I guess.

639
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:04,269
Right? I mean.

640
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:06,909
Not to split hairs, but.

641
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:10,583
[hums]

642
00:25:10,816 --> 00:25:13,047
Who talked to who first though?

643
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,951
Oh well... [snorts]

644
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,932
That's really splitting hairs,
if you're going to do that.

645
00:25:18,956 --> 00:25:21,055
I'm just trying
to keep it honest.

646
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,090
Come on.

647
00:25:22,993 --> 00:25:24,927
- Ha!
- You can do it.

648
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:27,996
Well, um...

649
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,130
<i>I guess that would be me.</i>

650
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:32,330
If you want to be completely
technical about it, but.

651
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,145
I'm just establishing
a timeline here, that's all.

652
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:36,367
<i>Okay, so yes. Yes.
I did approach you first,</i>

653
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,610
<i>and um...</i>

654
00:25:37,975 --> 00:25:39,579
Yes. You're right.

655
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:41,141
[chuckles]

656
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:42,780
"Hey there", I think it was.

657
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,145
No, it wasn't really that line.

658
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,950
You be the judge.

659
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:49,787
Hey there.
You don't know me, but...

660
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:50,387
[clicks tongue]

661
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,086
I think you should, so.

662
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:54,627
[laughs] Okay, yeah.
Pretty lame.

663
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,157
I didn't mind it, actually.

664
00:25:57,192 --> 00:25:58,158
<i>Good.</i>

665
00:25:58,193 --> 00:25:59,236
I mean, I didn't love it, but.

666
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,930
Oh, come on.
That shit is hard to do!

667
00:26:00,965 --> 00:26:02,129
What? Hit on women?

668
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,966
Hey, be nice now.

669
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,001
I'm just asking a question.

670
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,741
Yes, that was lame.

671
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,204
Hey there, or whatever I said.

672
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,041
I own that, okay? But...

673
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:15,780
I wasn't there trying to, like,
pick up girls, or whatever.

674
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:16,815
<i>I was just...</i>

675
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:18,860
<i>Having some drinks,
doing my thing,</i>

676
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:20,246
<i>and that was it, and then...</i>

677
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:24,019
I saw you, and I was just...

678
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:27,319
Oh my God, I was just
floored by you.

679
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:29,762
<i>Seriously.</i>

680
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,026
<i>Just you.</i>

681
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,359
Okay.

682
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:34,359
Fine.

683
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:35,734
That's fine.

684
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:41,235
You believe me?

685
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,270
<i>I don't know.</i>

686
00:26:44,745 --> 00:26:45,745
Should I believe you?

687
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:48,879
Please, yes.
[Mina clears her throat]

688
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:52,718
And

689
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:58,251
what do I get in return?

690
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:01,419
Uh, you choose.
It's up to you.

691
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,893
Whatever you want.

692
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,159
How about...

693
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:08,261
another kiss?

694
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:09,801
Okay.

695
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:15,972
[romantic music]

696
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,346
Mm. [lips pop]

697
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,018
Oh shit.

698
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:29,919
I'm sorry.

699
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:33,022
No, no, it's okay.
You just nipped me.

700
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,422
[music turns sinister]

701
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:42,032
Oh...

702
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:43,197
God.

703
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,200
[music fades]

704
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:47,872
Overeager.

705
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:49,973
Yeah, a little bit.

706
00:27:50,943 --> 00:27:52,272
Forgive me.

707
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:53,307
No...

708
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:55,242
Not a problem.

709
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:57,783
At least you're into it, right?

710
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,482
[kiss]

711
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,956
Always.

[laughs breathlessly]

713
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,832
Hm, you're so strong.

714
00:28:14,032 --> 00:28:15,493
Not strong enough, I guess.

715
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,000
[chuckles]

716
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:18,035
For?

717
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,498
For the likes of you.

718
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,038
[laughs]

719
00:28:22,073 --> 00:28:23,138
Is that right?

720
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:24,370
Yeah.

721
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:27,010
A little bunny like you.
[Mina giggles]

722
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:28,176
Is that what I am?

723
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:29,848
I think so.

724
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:31,410
I think you are.

725
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:33,049
You act all tough, but...

726
00:28:34,184 --> 00:28:36,316
deep down, you're still
just a bunny.

727
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,087
[chuckles]

728
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:40,287
Maybe.

729
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,425
- You work out?
- Yeah.

730
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,097
Well, sometimes.

731
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,562
Hmm...

732
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:53,498
You're keeping yourself young.

733
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,170
Yeah. Yeah.

734
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:56,502
Young, and...

735
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:59,075
looking good, as long as I can.

736
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,046
- You know...
- What?

737
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:06,181
You could do anything
you wanted to me.

738
00:29:06,216 --> 00:29:07,545
[ominous music]
Oh yeah?

739
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,019
And I couldn't stop you.

Oh my God! Jesus Christ!

929
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,528
Hey! Hi.

930
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:33,991
Sorry.
- Lucy, hello.

931
00:36:34,598 --> 00:36:35,839
<i>(Hap) Lucy?
Who the fuck is Lucy?</i>

932
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,223
I thought you said
you lived alone.

933
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,069
I never said that.

934
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:40,371
Uh, yeah. I think that you did.

935
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,306
<i>(Mina) No, I didn't.</i>

936
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:42,604
You sure about that?

937
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,309
I said I wasn't married.

938
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,100
- You said there was no one...
- I never said I lived alone.

939
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,743
Okay, well, um...

940
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:52,284
that must be my mistake then.

941
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:54,451
That's fine. I misunderstood.

942
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:57,355
Hey there. I'm so sorry.
[laughs nervously]

943
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,390
Why?

944
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,260
Well, um...

945
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:03,724
because of what we were doing

946
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,462
just now, and because I...

947
00:37:05,497 --> 00:37:07,297
I was under the impression
that we were alone.

948
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,829
<i>That Mina lived here
by herself, so...</i>

949
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:10,995
<i>Yeah, that's... that's why.</i>

950
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:13,437
Because, you know,
it's embarassing

951
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:15,736
to be doing that in front of
her roommate, or...

952
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:18,541
friend, or whoever.

953
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:19,576
That's why.

954
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:21,709
I didn't realize you were here.

955
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:23,007
I was getting ready.

956
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,481
(Mina) Ah, I see.

957
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:25,878
This is my sister, Lucy.

958
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,286
Oh! Sister.

959
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:28,749
Wow, okay. Hi.

960
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,081
Hello.

961
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:31,719
I heard you two come in,

962
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:34,557
I was upstairs in my room,
so I...

963
00:37:35,593 --> 00:37:36,593
Well, it doesn't matter.

964
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:38,495
No need to feel ashamed.

965
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,925
- No.
- Oh, no. I'm...

966
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:42,400
I'm not ashamed.
[stammers]

967
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:44,675
I didn't say that. I said I was
embarrased, and that's...

968
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:46,503
it's only because
you startled us.

969
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:47,070
You know, that's all.

970
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:47,971
<i>(Lucy) Honestly,</i>

971
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:49,968
that's alright.
Don't worry about it.

972
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:52,036
I can go back upstairs, if...

973
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:53,444
<i>(Hap) Oh, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

974
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,643
That's okay. I...

975
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,777
I should get going
because I'm tired,

976
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:58,460
and this is...
- No, no, no. Please, please.

977
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,684
Please stay for another drink.

978
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:00,979
No, that's alright.
- Please?

979
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:02,486
<i>(Lucy) I'll have one too.</i>

980
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,752
If it will make you feel
more comfortable.

981
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:05,885
Well...

982
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:08,019
no, I mean...

983
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:10,329
Really?

984
00:38:10,694 --> 00:38:12,760
Uh, okay. I mean, if you guys...

985
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:14,663
If you want to.

986
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:16,060
Yeah, and then I'll

987
00:38:16,095 --> 00:38:17,765
hit the road after that.

988
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:20,032
We insist.

989
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:21,407
We do.

990
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:25,476
Well... Well, I can't resist
a good insist.

991
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,708
[laughs]

992
00:38:26,743 --> 00:38:28,479
Sorry, that was really stupid.

993
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:29,477
Yeah.

994
00:38:29,512 --> 00:38:31,141
That was a little bit stupid.

995
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:31,878
[laughs]

996
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:32,812
Whoa.

997
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:35,519
My sister is even more honest
than I am.

998
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:37,653
Wow, is that actually possible?

999
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,119
Same?

1000
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Please, yeah.

1001
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:44,528
- Neat.
- Neat, yeah.

1002
00:38:44,794 --> 00:38:46,596
I'm a... I'm a creature of habit.

1003
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:48,467
So are we.

1004
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,765
[footsteps]

1005
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,063
[thump]

1006
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:54,637
[claps]

1007
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,574
I am so sorry about that.

1008
00:38:57,609 --> 00:38:59,576
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

1009
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:02,612
It's not like I saw
your cock, or anything.

1010
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:04,515
[laughs nervously]

1011
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:07,749
<i>Uh... yeah.</i>

1012
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:11,099
<i>(Lucy) And how do you know Mina?</i>

1013
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,886
Oh! We, um...

1014
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:14,723
we met tonight.

1015
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:15,856
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1016
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,699
Kind of a funny story, actually.
We were, um...

1017
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:20,762
both at the same place
downtown, and

1018
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,995
we had a few drinks, and...

1019
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:25,943
Well, it's not funny.
I don't know why I said funny.

1020
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,407
<i>Cause it's actually
not funny at all.</i>

1021
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:29,573
I don't know why I said that.

1022
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:31,674
Cause it's...
Nothing funny about it.

1023
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:33,511
[snorts]
That's what's funny.

1024
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,645
Interesting.

1025
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:37,813
Yeah.

1026
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:39,715
How so?

1027
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,914
No, nothing!

1028
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:44,049
It's just... it was my night
to go out,

1029
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:45,985
but apparently,
that doesn't matter.

1030
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,625
She's like that, my sister.

1031
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:50,122
Impulsive.

1032
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,156
Likes to dress up, and...

1033
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:54,158
do her thing.

1034
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:55,193
<i>(Hap) I'm sorry.</i>

1035
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:57,975
I don't understand. So you take
turns going out?

1036
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:00,032
No, nothing like that.

1037
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,638
Turns. [laughs]

1038
00:40:01,673 --> 00:40:03,046
No, it just usually
works out that way.

1039
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,103
<i>Uh,</i>

1040
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:06,775
someone watches the house,
and someone goes out.

1041
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,645
It's no big deal. It's fine.

1042
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,747
Oh, I see. Because of the lights
going out and stuff?

1043
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,453
Sorry to be nosy.
Mina told me that you...

1044
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,818
have a situation where
the power's always going off?

1045
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,887
I was thinking, you should get
a generator for up here.

1046
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:23,149
Seriously worth their weight
in gold in the wintertime.

1047
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,595
<i>Not expensive.</i>

1048
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,256
That's a really good idea.

1049
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,731
<i>(Hap) Yeah, I can't believe
you don't have one actually.</i>

1050
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:29,996
<i>This place is huge.</i>

1051
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:32,097
My parents had a cabin
when I was growing up,

1052
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:34,066
and my dad finally got
a generator

1053
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:35,771
because of all
the power outages,

1054
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:37,773
and it's the best thing
he ever did in his life.

1055
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:40,908
That sounds like
an exaggeration,

1056
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:43,845
but I mean that literally.
[laughs]

1057
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,144
I know that's not a very
nice thing to say, but...

1058
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:47,553
it's true.

1059
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:50,247
Not a great relationship
with your father.

1060
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:51,820
I'm guessing.

1061
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:55,956
You know, fathers and sons.

1062
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,927
How about you guys?

1063
00:40:59,962 --> 00:41:01,929
You two get along
with your dad? You good?

1064
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:03,733
Oh, very much.

1065
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:04,965
We love our father.

1066
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Ah.

1067
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:07,539
You're lucky.

1068
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:09,036
That's nice.

1069
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,136
Yeah.

1070
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,005
And you're lucky too.

1071
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Why's that?

1073
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:22,851
Hey, now we're all lucky.

1074
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:25,821
I should go check on Mina.

1075
00:41:26,824 --> 00:41:28,725
She can be a little, you know,

1076
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:30,287
ethereal.

1077
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:32,696
Oh yeah,
that's a good word for it.

1078
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:34,258
Yeah, okay. I'll just...

1079
00:41:34,293 --> 00:41:36,128
[yawn] just stay here.

1080
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,031
Yeah. Relax
and I'll be right back.

1081
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:39,098
[slap]

1082
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,297
Can do.

1083
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,706
<i>See you in a minute.</i>

1084
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,740

[laughs] Okay.

1243
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:41,436
You are honest.

1244
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:45,242
Did Mina show you the house?

1246
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:48,608

no, we just kinda came in here,
I guess.

Might wake me up
a little bit, right?

1253
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,230
Okay.

1254
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:06,758

Hey, sorry. Sorry.

1261
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:38,460
Can I just catch
my breath for a second?

1262
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:39,692
- Sure.
- So embarrassing.

1263
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:40,594
How many...

1264
00:52:40,629 --> 00:52:41,892
How many more floors we got?

1265
00:52:41,927 --> 00:52:43,300
Just one.
- Okay.

1266
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:44,335
Place is huge.

Man...

1268
00:52:45,898 --> 00:52:47,700
Tiring, and I work out.

1269
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:50,802
[chuckles] It's like hiking
Macchu Picchu.

1270
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:52,540
It's only a little bit further.

1271
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:53,871
Okay, no, no. I'm sorry.

1272
00:52:53,906 --> 00:52:55,906
I'm actually in better shape
than this. I'm just...

1273
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,842
You know when you're drinking?
- Mm.

1274
00:52:57,877 --> 00:52:59,756
You reach a point where like
you get all worked up,

1275
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,516
and then you're doing
certain things,

1276
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:02,715
and then... [chuckles]

1277
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,387
And then you, like,
hit that lull.

1278
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:06,851
Kinda like, "Ugh,
I just wanna be somewhere."

two beautiful ladies

1283
00:53:13,892 --> 00:53:15,452
live in here alone.
It's a little weird.

1284
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:17,906
And do... you're not scared
being out here by yourself?

1285
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,567
As a man, I'd be afraid.

1286
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:21,042
I wouldn't live here
with my brother.

1287
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:23,472
And he's... he's actually
a wrestler.

1288
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:24,902
He studied jiu-jitsu wrestling.

1289
00:53:24,937 --> 00:53:27,278
I mean, he can take care
of himself.

1290
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:29,544
Yeah, I think we're pretty
used to it by now though.

1291
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:30,842
- Living out here?
- Yeah.

1292
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:32,811
I guess so,
but that doesn't mean...

1293
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:34,384
You got no like security system.

1294
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,550
Nothing. It's crazy.

1295
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:37,816
Hey, uh...

1296
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:38,916
[stammers]

1297
00:53:39,585 --> 00:53:40,662
I don't know how to ask this

1298
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:42,606
without sounding like
I'm being too personal, but

1299
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:45,461
she's cool, right?

1300
00:53:45,496 --> 00:53:46,462
Do you get a sense...

1301
00:53:46,497 --> 00:53:48,398
You know her, your sister.
Do you feel like...

1302
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:49,862
With me?

1303
00:53:50,336 --> 00:53:51,336
What do you think?

1304
00:53:51,464 --> 00:53:52,798
No, I think she likes you.

1305
00:53:53,372 --> 00:53:54,372
For real?

1306
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:55,647
Yeah, looked like it to me.

1307
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:57,639
Right, cause of the...

1308
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:59,970
The thing in the thing.
[laughs]

1309
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:01,873
Again, my apologies.

1310
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,843
The moment took... I truly
didn't know you were here.

1311
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,680
Yeah. It's no judgement. Really.

1312
00:54:06,715 --> 00:54:07,715
Well,

1313
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:08,581
seems like there's a little bit

1314
00:54:08,617 --> 00:54:10,288
only cause you keep
bringing it up.

1315
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:11,420
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1316
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,390
Let's finish this tour.
I want to see it.

1317
00:54:17,726 --> 00:54:19,429
Final floor, you said.

1318
00:54:22,995 --> 00:54:23,697
[door clunks]

1319
00:54:23,732 --> 00:54:25,501
And here

1320
00:54:25,536 --> 00:54:26,931
we

1321
00:54:26,966 --> 00:54:27,701
Are!

1322
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:29,604
Oh wow.

1323
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:30,969
Fuck...

1324
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:34,004
I... everywhere you turn
in this place.

1325
00:54:34,644 --> 00:54:36,677
And this is beautiful.

1326
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,109
Wow.

1327
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,682
It's amazing!

1328
00:54:42,553 --> 00:54:43,915
- Thank you.
- Huh.

1329
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:47,622
[Lucy sighs]

1330
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:55,432
So what do you guys
do for fun up here?

1331
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:57,401
With the... up at the manor?

1332
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,833
- Just the usual.
- What's that?

1333
00:55:01,836 --> 00:55:04,837
You know... Eat. Drink.

1334
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:06,839
Sleep. Play games.

1335
00:55:06,874 --> 00:55:08,445
Gossip.
- Ah.

1336
00:55:08,744 --> 00:55:10,381
Tell each other ghost stories.

1337
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,416
[laughs]

1338
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,461
Sound like a couple of kids
at a sleepover.

1339
00:55:14,486 --> 00:55:15,947
Well, you asked.

1340
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:18,686
No, no. That's great.
It sounds like fun, actually.

1341
00:55:19,755 --> 00:55:20,952
- It is.
- Yeah.

1342
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:22,723
It's a lot of fun.
We like it very much.

1343
00:55:22,758 --> 00:55:23,988
Yeah.

1344
00:55:26,465 --> 00:55:27,959
Do you know any?

1345
00:55:28,995 --> 00:55:30,434
Any... what's that?

1346
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:32,128
Ghost stories?

1347
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:34,031
Um... [hums]

1348
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:35,538
- What?
- Not really.

1349
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:36,573
Not even one?

1350
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:37,705
Um...

1351
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,642
To me, ghost stories are like
jokes, you know?

1352
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:42,545
No.

1353
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,547
Well, it's like...
you gotta really

1354
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,450
sell the shit out of them.

1355
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:47,011
You know? It's like...

1356
00:55:47,046 --> 00:55:48,012
It's hard.

1357
00:55:48,047 --> 00:55:50,113
It's hard to tell a good joke
or a limerick,

1358
00:55:50,148 --> 00:55:51,281
or a ghost story.

1359
00:55:51,316 --> 00:55:53,853
It's just what I think.
You gotta kinda know it already.

1360
00:55:53,888 --> 00:55:55,855
- Well, that is... that is true.
- Yeah.

1361
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:57,792
I mean, I could try.

1362
00:55:57,827 --> 00:55:59,760
I could try to come up
with something in my head,

1363
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:01,762
but no... I don't know
any real ones.

1364
00:56:02,468 --> 00:56:03,468
What about you?

1365
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:04,634
Oh...

1366
00:56:05,163 --> 00:56:06,767
one or two.

1367
00:56:06,802 --> 00:56:08,197
I suppose, one... one or two.

1368
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:09,232
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

1369
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,068
That's cool. Tell one.

1370
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:14,104
No, Mina's heard all mine
before over and over, so.

1371
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:15,809
Okay, well just tell me then.

1372
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:19,582
Well, I wouldn't want to
interrupt your date.

1373
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:22,112
Oh, come on. No. It's...

1374
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:23,521
It's not a date.

1375
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:25,588
Honestly, it's not.

1376
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:27,623
Yeah, we just got
to talking, and

1377
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:30,527
I offered her a ride home,
and... you know, whatever.

1378
00:56:30,562 --> 00:56:31,762
It sort of looked like a date.

1379
00:56:31,794 --> 00:56:32,860
You know what I mean. I...

1380
00:56:32,895 --> 00:56:36,126
She invited me inside,
we had a few drinks, and...

1381
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:37,864
and...

1382
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:39,866
Yeah, and...

1383
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:41,934
that's what I'm talking about.
The "and" part.

1384
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:42,701
Oh.

1385
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:44,167
I don't want to ruin the moment.

1386
00:56:44,972 --> 00:56:46,169
Oh, you mean...

1387
00:56:46,578 --> 00:56:47,676
cause you... the...

1388
00:56:48,206 --> 00:56:50,646
You... You're not ruining
anything. [laughs]

1389
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:52,912
I promise, okay?
How's... how's that?

1390
00:56:52,947 --> 00:56:54,867
And you... I don't think
you could, if you tried.

1391
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:56,916
And that is meant to be
a compliment.

1392
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:58,214
It maybe sounded weird,

1393
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,721
but I mean that as a compliment.

1394
00:56:59,756 --> 00:57:01,030
And that's not me
trying to, like,

1395
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:02,054
whatever.

1396
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:03,594
I just mean...

1397
00:57:04,695 --> 00:57:06,189
You're very easy to talk to.

1398
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:07,762
It's nice.

1399
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,600
So don't worry about her.

1400
00:57:09,964 --> 00:57:10,964
[chuckles]

1401
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,701
Thank you.

1402
00:57:13,165 --> 00:57:14,197
Welcome.

1403
00:57:14,936 --> 00:57:15,936
That's...

1404
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:19,708
I think you're a little drunk.

1405
00:57:19,743 --> 00:57:20,643
(mocking) Oh, you think?

1406
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:22,810
[laughs]
Okay...

1407
00:57:22,845 --> 00:57:25,109
No, no... maybe just a little.

1408
00:57:25,144 --> 00:57:26,077
Maybe?

1409
00:57:26,112 --> 00:57:28,079
Well... yeah.

1410
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:29,114
Guilty.

1411
00:57:29,247 --> 00:57:30,785
[laughs]

1412
00:57:31,623 --> 00:57:32,623
And...

1413
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,852
yet,

1414
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:36,120
you decided to drive
my sister home?

1415
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:37,187
Yeah.

1416
00:57:38,223 --> 00:57:39,123
<i>And I think that's against
the law.</i>

1417
00:57:39,158 --> 00:57:40,158
<i>You know?</i>

1418
00:57:40,731 --> 00:57:42,698
Guilty again? [chuckles]

1419
00:57:42,733 --> 00:57:43,864
Yeah.
- Wow.

1420
00:57:43,899 --> 00:57:45,602
Oh! No, I wasn't that drunk
when I...

1421
00:57:45,637 --> 00:57:47,197
No, but I wasn't drunk
when I drove her.

1422
00:57:47,606 --> 00:57:48,737
I was like a little buzzed.

1423
00:57:49,036 --> 00:57:50,116
That's not against the law.

1424
00:57:50,576 --> 00:57:52,037
You sound like
a very guilty man.

1425
00:57:52,237 --> 00:57:53,676
Um, no, no.

1426
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:54,711
<i>Are you?</i>

1427
00:57:55,944 --> 00:57:56,844
Go on.

1428
00:57:56,879 --> 00:57:57,944
You can tell me.

1429
00:57:58,584 --> 00:57:59,824
I won't tell a soul, I promise.

1430
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:03,884
I mean, I have my moments,
I guess.

1431
00:58:03,919 --> 00:58:05,279
[clears throat]
But I'm not like...

1432
00:58:05,657 --> 00:58:07,316
I don't let it bother me.

1433
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:08,922
[laughs] I don't sweat it.

1434
00:58:08,957 --> 00:58:10,264
I don't sweat that shit,
you know?

1435
00:58:10,288 --> 00:58:11,628
I'm serious!

1436
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:14,026
[giggles]
What?

1437
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:15,566
You

1438
00:58:15,865 --> 00:58:18,294
have a way of making
everything sound

1439
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,098
slightly suggestive.

1440
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:21,231
Huh.

1441
00:58:21,772 --> 00:58:23,233
Only slightly?
[laughs]

1442
00:58:23,268 --> 00:58:24,971
- You see?
- Yeah. No, I'm kidding.

1443
00:58:25,006 --> 00:58:26,907
- That was a joke.
- Yeah, but it's true.

1444
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:28,040
Oh, well.

1445
00:58:28,306 --> 00:58:29,712
Guilty again.

1446
00:58:30,946 --> 00:58:34,046
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

1447
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:35,718
Yeah! Uh...

1448
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:38,215
That's also quite possibly true.

1449
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,250
Mhm.

1450
00:58:39,856 --> 00:58:41,251
I didn't say it was a bad thing.

1451
00:58:41,693 --> 00:58:43,693
Okay, well, good.

1452
00:58:44,828 --> 00:58:45,948
Now we're getting somewhere.

1453
00:58:47,094 --> 00:58:48,094
Oh.

1454
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:50,195
Did you cut your lip?

1455
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:52,031
Oh, yeah...

1456
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:53,736
Yeah.
- I just noticed that.

1457
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:55,298
Yeah, no, I um...
we were...

1458
00:58:56,708 --> 00:58:58,840
No, I just cut...
I bit it earlier.

1459
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,303
It's... that's all.

1460
00:59:00,338 --> 00:59:01,876
- I see.
- Mm.

1461
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:05,167
What were... what were we
just talking about?

1462
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:07,948
Guilt.
[huffs]

1463
00:59:07,983 --> 00:59:09,213
No, no...

1464
00:59:09,248 --> 00:59:10,918
Before that.

1465
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:13,789
The thing about the lip,
and then you...

1466
00:59:13,824 --> 00:59:15,758
Oh! Uh, ghost stories!
Tell me a ghost story.

1467
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:16,759
Oh...
- Let's hear it!

1468
00:59:16,794 --> 00:59:17,969
- You were gonna tell me one.
- Are you sure

1469
00:59:17,993 --> 00:59:19,190
you wanna hear a ghost story?

1470
00:59:19,225 --> 00:59:21,060
- Yes!
- I mean, are you sure sure?

1471
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:23,039
Jesus, what?
You want me to beg?

1472
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:24,899
Well, I wouldn't hate it.

1473
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:25,934
Oh, Jesus.

1474
00:59:26,265 --> 00:59:27,265
You two.

1475
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:28,838
Who?

1476
00:59:29,037 --> 00:59:30,333
You and your sister.

1477
00:59:30,368 --> 00:59:32,137
Well, what about us?

1478
00:59:32,172 --> 00:59:33,842
You're both like...

1479
00:59:35,043 --> 00:59:36,643
I don't know how to explain it.
You're...

1480
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,176
Eh... you're great.

1481
00:59:39,014 --> 00:59:40,783
Way different than
the girls in my office.

1482
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:42,015
That's true.

1483
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,248
Thank you very much, I think.

1484
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,217
Oh, no, no. It's a good thing.

1485
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:48,758
It's a compliment.

1486
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,287
But not... [stammers]

1487
00:59:50,322 --> 00:59:53,026
What is... why am I the one
giving you all the compliments?

1488
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:55,061
Enough. I should get
something in return.

1489
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,360
Ghost story, go.

1490
00:59:57,868 --> 00:59:59,406
I don't know.
Should we wait for Mina, or...?

1491
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,034
Eh, Mina, schmina.

1492
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:02,805
What? It's just her loss.

1493
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,851
Plus you said she already
knows all of them already.

1494
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:05,841
Yeah, well, it's true.

1495
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:06,941
- Okay.
- I did say that.

1496
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:09,339
So, yeah.

1497
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:11,177
Alright.

1498
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:12,848
Just one.

1499
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:14,444
Yeah.

1500
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:17,116
Yes please.

1501
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:18,151
Fine.

1502
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,955
Cause you said please.

1503
01:00:23,223 --> 01:00:24,943
- Once upon a...
- (Mina) Am I interrupting?

1504
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:28,061
God no. Of course not.

1505
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:30,162
Welcome back.

1506
01:00:30,197 --> 01:00:31,460
No, we were just talking.

1507
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:33,297
Hm. Oh, hello there.

1508
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:36,069
- Thank you.
- Sorry I took so long.

1509
01:00:36,104 --> 01:00:37,378
- I was just...
- No, no worries.

1510
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:39,050
Lucy was just showing me
the rest of the house,

1511
01:00:39,074 --> 01:00:40,876
- Oh.
- And we were gonna do a...

1512
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:42,339
Started like a fun...

1513
01:00:42,374 --> 01:00:44,374
I was gonna tell him
a story, that's all.

1514
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:46,409
Yeah, but we don't have to.
Now that you're back.

1515
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:48,752
Fun. I love stories.

1516
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:50,050
Go on.

1517
01:00:50,085 --> 01:00:50,853
Oh.

1518
01:00:51,086 --> 01:00:52,184
Okay, fine. Let's do it.

1519
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:53,219
Okay.

1520
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,088
Oh, should we...

1521
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,322
I set things up
in the other room...

1522
01:00:58,357 --> 01:00:59,730
The living room.

1523
01:00:59,765 --> 01:01:00,197
Wait.

1524
01:01:00,232 --> 01:01:01,165
What do you mean?

1525
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,964
That wasn't the living room
that we were in?

1526
01:01:03,296 --> 01:01:04,296
[scoffs]

1527
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:07,771
Oh no, no. That was one
of the sitting rooms.

1528
01:01:07,806 --> 01:01:09,300
- Oh.
- The library.

1529
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:13,304
This place. [huffs]

1530
01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:15,405
The living room is much nicer.

1531
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,747
Much nicer.

1532
01:01:17,178 --> 01:01:18,178
Wow...

1533
01:01:18,817 --> 01:01:19,915
Cool.

1534
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:20,950
Alright.

1535
01:01:23,316 --> 01:01:26,086
Should we go get
comfortable, or...?

1536
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:28,352
Absolutely, yeah.

1537
01:01:28,387 --> 01:01:29,529
Whatever you guys are up for,

1538
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:30,486
it's okay by me.

1539
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:31,521
Oh.

1540
01:01:31,797 --> 01:01:32,797
Anything?

1541
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:34,930
I'm just saying,

1542
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:36,229
anything you like,

1543
01:01:36,934 --> 01:01:38,032
either of you,

1544
01:01:38,397 --> 01:01:39,495
I'm game.

1545
01:01:40,432 --> 01:01:41,871
Honestly.

1546
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,774
I'm very... I'm very open-minded.

1547
01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:44,809
Obviously.

1548
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:48,075
So, yeah. Let's just...
Let's just go already.

1549
01:01:48,946 --> 01:01:50,781
You're so bad.

1550
01:01:50,816 --> 01:01:51,782
What?

1551
01:01:51,817 --> 01:01:53,311
I'm just putting it out there.

1552
01:01:53,346 --> 01:01:54,983
I know, but...

1553
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:57,986
- What?
- Shall we?

1554
01:01:59,022 --> 01:02:00,318
Yeah, we shall.

1555
01:02:01,321 --> 01:02:04,124
[footsteps]

1556
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:10,999
[foreboding music]

1557
01:02:12,002 --> 01:02:16,070
[footsteps]

1558
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:23,847
Oh my...

1559
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,476
This room! It's incredible.

1560
01:02:26,511 --> 01:02:28,214
Another room everywhere you go.

1561
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:29,446
The molding, the woodwork...

1562
01:02:29,481 --> 01:02:30,579
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1563
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:32,922
Oh beautiful. That's... yeah.

1564
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,121
I'll say. [laughs]

1565
01:02:34,156 --> 01:02:35,254
[lights buzz]

1566
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:36,155
Oh!
[lights pop]

1567
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:39,126
And there we go
with the fucking lights.

1568
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:40,556
Just get a fucking generator.

1569
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:41,832
Alright.

1570
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:44,330
You first.

1571
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:49,367
[distant clock ticks]

1572
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:53,305
Alright. [chuckles]

1573
01:02:54,572 --> 01:02:55,978
My clothes?
- (Mina) No!

1574
01:02:56,013 --> 01:02:57,210
Your story.

1575
01:02:57,542 --> 01:02:58,574
<i>Oh.</i>

1576
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,147
You have to tell one
to hear one.

1577
01:03:00,182 --> 01:03:02,215
Oh! Okay.

1578
01:03:03,086 --> 01:03:05,020
That's funny. I... Yeah,
I thought we were...

1579
01:03:06,023 --> 01:03:07,858
Alright, um...

1580
01:03:07,893 --> 01:03:08,991
<i>(Lucy) I asked him earlier,</i>

1581
01:03:09,026 --> 01:03:10,487
and he said he doesn't know any.

1582
01:03:10,522 --> 01:03:12,192
- Hm.
- (Hap) No, but...

1583
01:03:12,227 --> 01:03:13,589
Thanks a lot. No, I said...

1584
01:03:14,196 --> 01:03:16,867
I'm just not very good
at telling stories, okay?

1585
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:18,062
<i>(Mina) Well, that's not true.</i>

1586
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:19,595
Wha... how so?

1587
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,069
Cause you're a fibber.

1588
01:03:21,104 --> 01:03:22,169
That's what fibs are.

1589
01:03:23,271 --> 01:03:24,271
Just stories.

1590
01:03:25,108 --> 01:03:26,503
<i>Little made-up stories.</i>

1591
01:03:26,978 --> 01:03:28,648
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I know any ghost stories.

1592
01:03:28,672 --> 01:03:29,672
Make one up.

1593
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:32,642
Make one up.

1594
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,985
Come on, you guys.
This is so dumb.

1595
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,547
This was your idea!

1596
01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:38,482
I'm just here for the booze.

1597
01:03:38,517 --> 01:03:40,319
[laughs] Another fib.

1598
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,025
What's that mean?

1599
01:03:43,093 --> 01:03:45,093
You're not just here
for the booze, right?

1600
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:47,525
Hey.

1601
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:49,031
You invited me in.

1602
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:50,901
<i>(Mina) Oh come on.
Be honest.</i>

1603
01:03:50,936 --> 01:03:52,969
Mina, don't embarrass the man.

1604
01:03:53,004 --> 01:03:55,301
I'm just pointing out the truth.

1605
01:03:57,635 --> 01:03:58,975
<i>(Lucy) Fine.</i>

1606
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:01,637
Can you do that for us?

1607
01:04:02,178 --> 01:04:03,178
What?

1608
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,915
<i>(Lucy) Make up a little story.</i>

1609
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,016
Pretty please?

1610
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,051
[Hap sighs]

1611
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:10,416
Alright.

1612
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:11,714
Fine.

1613
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:14,122
A story. Here we go.

1614
01:04:14,157 --> 01:04:15,157
Mm.

1615
01:04:15,554 --> 01:04:16,554
[lips smack]

1616
01:04:18,161 --> 01:04:20,491
[sighs] So there was this guy...

1617
01:04:20,526 --> 01:04:21,998
<i>(Lucy) No.
No, no, no.</i>

1618
01:04:22,495 --> 01:04:23,495
Once upon a time.

1619
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:25,661
Seriously.

1620
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:28,367
Yes! All good stories start
with "Once upon a time".

1621
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:29,368
She's right.

1622
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:31,436
[Hap scoffs] Alright.

1623
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:32,668
Fine.

1624
01:04:33,209 --> 01:04:36,012
Jesus... once upon a time,
there was this guy.

1625
01:04:37,642 --> 01:04:38,916
<i>And um...</i>

1626
01:04:39,182 --> 01:04:41,182
<i>he was a pretty decent person.</i>

1627
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,283
Good friend to a lot of people.

1628
01:04:44,187 --> 01:04:45,582
Coworker you could count on.

1629
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,993
He was friendly, fun...
Whatever, just this guy.

1630
01:04:50,028 --> 01:04:52,259
Let's call him Steve.

1631
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:56,131
So Steve, he goes to this bar,

1632
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,166
and

1633
01:04:57,662 --> 01:04:58,662
he meets this

1634
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:01,334
amazing girl.

1635
01:05:02,436 --> 01:05:03,974
<i>She's beautiful</i>

1636
01:05:04,702 --> 01:05:06,504
<i>and mysterious, and</i>

1637
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:08,276
<i>just...</i>

1638
01:05:08,574 --> 01:05:09,639
<i>she's great.</i>

1639
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,115
Perfect.

1640
01:05:13,612 --> 01:05:15,150
And they start talking,

1641
01:05:15,185 --> 01:05:16,481
and they connect,

1642
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,220
and they drink,

1643
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,090
and they laugh.

1644
01:05:21,422 --> 01:05:22,993
And then the girl has to go.

1645
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:25,067
She says, "I don't have a ride."

1646
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:27,624
And she says...

1647
01:05:28,297 --> 01:05:29,604
Well, she's gotta
call a cab, right?

1648
01:05:29,628 --> 01:05:31,067
Get an Uber. Some other...

1649
01:05:31,465 --> 01:05:32,695
expensive option, and...

1650
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:35,973
she asks Steve to drive her.

1651
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,569
He's game. He's a decent person,

1652
01:05:38,604 --> 01:05:40,043
so he obliges.

1653
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:43,541
<i>And so they do. They drive
back to her place.</i>

1654
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:44,410
<i>This...</i>

1655
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:46,445
mansion in the woods.

1656
01:05:46,744 --> 01:05:48,216
This incredible place.

1657
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,680
And they drink a little more,

1658
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:52,584
and then they just...

1659
01:05:53,124 --> 01:05:54,519
kiss, and it is...

1660
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:57,995
It's like he's never
kissed before.

1661
01:05:59,361 --> 01:06:00,492
It's the best.

1662
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:04,166
And he starts getting
a little nervous.

1663
01:06:04,828 --> 01:06:05,828
Why's that?

1664
01:06:06,368 --> 01:06:07,433
Because...

1665
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:10,370
he thinks he sees ghosts.

1666
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:14,044
<i>In the house, out in the woods,
everywhere.</i>

1667
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,309
<i>Ghosts, all over the place.</i>

1668
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:16,641
<i>But guess what.</i>

1669
01:06:17,214 --> 01:06:18,214
What?

1670
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,183
<i>There are no ghosts.</i>

1671
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:20,914
No?

1672
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,580
Oh no, no, no. No ghosts.

1673
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:24,780
No danger of any kind.

1674
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,189
<i>Really.</i>

1675
01:06:26,256 --> 01:06:27,256
Well then, what was it?

1676
01:06:28,093 --> 01:06:29,093
Not what.

1677
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:30,259
Who.

1678
01:06:31,426 --> 01:06:32,590
It was that girl's,

1679
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,131
also very attractive, sister.

1680
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,034
<i>She wasn't a ghost.</i>

1681
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,530
<i>Just a living person.</i>

1682
01:06:39,137 --> 01:06:40,137
They live together.

1683
01:06:41,436 --> 01:06:42,436
And after that,

1684
01:06:42,536 --> 01:06:44,041
after Steve realized it,

1685
01:06:45,605 --> 01:06:47,374
he was totally cool.

1686
01:06:47,739 --> 01:06:50,113
And he was never, ever
scared again.

1687
01:06:50,445 --> 01:06:51,445
Never?

1688
01:06:52,447 --> 01:06:53,347
<i>Nope.</i>

1689
01:06:53,382 --> 01:06:55,052
Not even once again

1690
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:58,154
the rest of his entire,
whole life.

1691
01:07:02,754 --> 01:07:03,786
Okay...

1692
01:07:04,657 --> 01:07:06,096
and so then what happens?

1693
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,724
<i>Okay... well,</i>

1694
01:07:07,759 --> 01:07:09,825
then, uh, Steve...

1695
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:13,763
uh, he has a few more drinks
with the ladies,

1696
01:07:13,798 --> 01:07:14,397
the sisters,

1697
01:07:14,432 --> 01:07:16,337
<i>and they go upstairs,</i>

1698
01:07:16,372 --> 01:07:18,471
<i>and he...</i>

1699
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:19,835
fucks their brains out.

1700
01:07:21,476 --> 01:07:23,839
And then they all
take a shower together.

1701
01:07:25,183 --> 01:07:26,380
[sips]

1702
01:07:29,682 --> 01:07:31,286
That's the end of the story?

1703
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:32,518
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

1704
01:07:32,553 --> 01:07:34,190
Oh wait.
The End.

1705
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:35,521
[laughs]

1706
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:36,556
How's that?

1707
01:07:38,658 --> 01:07:39,756
That's not a ghost story.

1708
01:07:40,396 --> 01:07:41,758
Oh, ladies, come on!

1709
01:07:41,793 --> 01:07:43,133
It was a... it was a joke!

1710
01:07:43,696 --> 01:07:44,827
It's no fair.

1711
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:45,862
<i>(Hap) What? I'm...</i>

1712
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:47,500
I was trying to be funny.

1713
01:07:47,535 --> 01:07:48,034
<i>(Lucy) Funny?</i>

1714
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:49,536
I didn't laugh at all.

1715
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:50,668
Neither did I.

1716
01:07:51,771 --> 01:07:53,331
<i>(Hap) Well, you win some.
You lose some.</i>

1717
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:54,771
They can't all be hits.

1718
01:07:55,312 --> 01:07:56,542
It wasn't like a joke joke.

1719
01:07:57,545 --> 01:07:58,643
<i>Make a smile.</i>

1720
01:07:58,678 --> 01:08:00,282
<i>Geeze, you got a tough audience.</i>

1721
01:08:00,878 --> 01:08:02,581
Oh come on,
it was a little amusing.

1722
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:04,253
Right? A little bit?

1723
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:07,418
- Fine.
- Fine.

1724
01:08:07,453 --> 01:08:09,720
<i>Thank you. Oh, thank you.</i>

1725
01:08:10,888 --> 01:08:11,888
I gotta tell ya.

1726
01:08:12,725 --> 01:08:14,791
I'm very encouraged
by the fact that

1727
01:08:14,826 --> 01:08:15,935
you didn't seem to care
about the sex

1728
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:17,398
with both sisters part.

1729
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:18,806
The fact that it wasn't
funny enough

1730
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,236
is what got you.
[laughs]

1731
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:22,700
We asked for a ghost story.

1732
01:08:22,735 --> 01:08:23,932
<i>(Hap) I know. Forgive me.</i>

1733
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:25,567
It's the best I could do
on short notice.

1734
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:29,707
<i>Okay, alright.
Yeah, you did. So...</i>

1735
01:08:30,512 --> 01:08:32,644
<i>After they take a shower, um...</i>

1736
01:08:33,284 --> 01:08:35,251
the towels are just, like,
floating in the air,

1737
01:08:35,286 --> 01:08:36,297
and they're being held
by a ghost,

1738
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,584
and all they all dry off,
and Steve goes home...

1739
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:39,915
Maybe they fuck again,

1740
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:42,764
and cause he's now calmed down,
and he gets worked up again.

1741
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:43,864
They fuck again,
and he goes home.

1742
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:45,690
Okay? Ghost story.

1743
01:08:46,693 --> 01:08:47,693
So.

1744
01:08:47,826 --> 01:08:48,826
Your turn.

1745
01:08:49,267 --> 01:08:50,365
You show me how it's done.

1746
01:08:51,731 --> 01:08:53,533
Lucy is the storyteller
of the family.

1747
01:08:54,305 --> 01:08:55,403
I'm the game-player.

1748
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:57,438
Oh, that's true enough.

1749
01:08:57,473 --> 01:08:58,835
<i>Stories first.</i>

1750
01:08:59,508 --> 01:09:00,573
Games later.

1751
01:09:02,808 --> 01:09:03,808
Promise?

1752
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:06,315
(whispers) Cross my heart.

1753
01:09:07,879 --> 01:09:08,879
<i>(Hap) Okay.</i>

1754
01:09:09,518 --> 01:09:10,518
That's a deal.

1755
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:11,782
[chuckles]

1756
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:14,621
<i>(Lucy) You ready?</i>

1757
01:09:15,293 --> 01:09:16,457
Yeah.

1758
01:09:16,492 --> 01:09:17,492
<i>(Lucy) Okay.</i>

1759
01:09:20,892 --> 01:09:22,298
Once upon a time,

1760
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:22,865
<i>(Hap) Classic.</i>

1761
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,234
Cause I saw that coming.

1762
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:25,664
Shh...

1763
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:27,270
Sorry, sorry.
[clicks teeth]

1764
01:09:28,405 --> 01:09:30,045
(Lucy) Once upon a time,
there was a girl.

1765
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:31,901
<i>A lovely little girl</i>

1766
01:09:32,442 --> 01:09:34,904
who lived in a tiny house
with her mother and her father

1767
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:37,709
on the edge of
a great, dark forest.

1768
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:40,943
They lived near a vast lake
by the woods,

1769
01:09:40,978 --> 01:09:42,010
and it was good.

1770
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:43,253
And they were happy.

1771
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:45,827
For awhile, at least.
[low haunting music]

1772
01:09:45,851 --> 01:09:47,554
But happiness can never
last long,

1773
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:48,852
not even in stories.

1774
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:50,359
And darkness came
for the family.

1775
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:50,959
One

1776
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:52,328
after the other, until...

1777
01:09:52,726 --> 01:09:54,627
only the little girl was left.

1778
01:09:55,366 --> 01:09:57,894
Her father died
in the deep, dark woods,

1779
01:09:57,929 --> 01:09:59,643
and her mother fell ill
with fever soon after,

1780
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:00,941
and then only the child was left

1781
01:10:00,965 --> 01:10:03,372
to tend to the animals
and the farmland

1782
01:10:03,902 --> 01:10:05,968
and try to make a new life
for herself.

1783
01:10:07,444 --> 01:10:08,685
She had to watch
all the animals?

1784
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:10,346
Shh...

1785
01:10:10,381 --> 01:10:11,381
Sorry.

1786
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:12,579
<i>(Lucy) And then,</i>

1787
01:10:12,944 --> 01:10:14,383
<i>one day, men came.</i>

1788
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:15,648
Oh boy.

1789
01:10:15,683 --> 01:10:16,814
Here we go.

1790
01:10:16,849 --> 01:10:17,650
<i>(Lucy) Hunters</i>

1791
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:19,355
from a nearby village.

1792
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,654
They saw that the little girl
was all alone,

1793
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:23,260
and yet, they did not
take pity on her.

1794
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:26,021
They did not take her into town

1795
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,364
and make her one of their own.

1796
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,400
They did not lead her
to a church for safety,

1797
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,830
or comfort, or love. No.

1798
01:10:33,503 --> 01:10:34,733
They did not.

1799
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:36,471
Instead,

1800
01:10:36,836 --> 01:10:38,275
they led her out to the forest,

1801
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:40,277
this circle of men,

1802
01:10:40,873 --> 01:10:42,609
and one by one,
they had their way with her.

1803
01:10:42,644 --> 01:10:44,413
One, by one,

1804
01:10:44,778 --> 01:10:45,778
by one.

1805
01:10:46,483 --> 01:10:48,978
Jesus. H. Christ.

1806
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:50,618
<i>(Lucy) No.</i>

1807
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:53,356
Jesus was nowhere
to be found on that day.

1808
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:54,711
No, that's... I didn't mean to...

1809
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,722
Didn't mean that literally.

1810
01:10:56,757 --> 01:10:58,955
Wait, hold on.
Is that the end of the story?

1811
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:00,463
<i>(Lucy) Oh no.</i>

1812
01:11:01,597 --> 01:11:02,860
Oh, okay.

1813
01:11:02,895 --> 01:11:04,466
That's a really
depressing ending.

1814
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:06,732
[laughs nervously]
Buzzkill.

1815
01:11:07,031 --> 01:11:08,437
No, I'm not finished yet.

1816
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:09,834
<i>(Hap) Oh good.</i>

1817
01:11:11,068 --> 01:11:12,068
Please.

1818
01:11:14,445 --> 01:11:17,413
The men from the village
left the little girl for dead

1819
01:11:17,448 --> 01:11:18,579
in the deep, dark woods,

1820
01:11:18,845 --> 01:11:19,943
but she was not dead.

1821
01:11:19,978 --> 01:11:20,978
Near death,

1822
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:22,880
but not at all dead.

1823
01:11:23,817 --> 01:11:25,883
She lay frozen in the grass,

1824
01:11:26,424 --> 01:11:29,590
covered in pain, and dirt,
and bruises.

1825
01:11:29,988 --> 01:11:32,758
<i>Her body mangled and abused,</i>

1826
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:33,924
<i>unable to move,</i>

1827
01:11:34,465 --> 01:11:35,893
<i>staring up at the sky,</i>

1828
01:11:35,928 --> 01:11:38,599
hoping to have even
the strength to die,

1829
01:11:38,634 --> 01:11:39,930
but she did not die.

1830
01:11:40,636 --> 01:11:42,372
Not that day, and not ever.

1831
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:44,902
Instead,

1832
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:46,640
she was found
by a passing family

1833
01:11:46,675 --> 01:11:47,839
in the dark of night.

1834
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:51,678
By a kindly father,
and his two, young daughters.

1835
01:11:53,913 --> 01:11:55,748
They found her
laying in the grass,

1836
01:11:56,014 --> 01:11:57,948
smashed to pieces.

1837
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:00,357
And so they lifted her up,

1838
01:12:01,019 --> 01:12:02,524
and they carried her away,

1839
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,658
high to a castle
in the mountains,

1840
01:12:05,122 --> 01:12:06,957
<i>where they slowly nursed her
back to health.</i>

1841
01:12:06,992 --> 01:12:07,992
<i>Day by day.</i>

1842
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,400
Hour by hour.

1843
01:12:11,095 --> 01:12:11,896
Drop

1844
01:12:12,096 --> 01:12:13,469
by drop.

1845
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:14,701
Drop by drop?

1846
01:12:14,736 --> 01:12:16,131
- Shh...
- (Hap) I just...

1847
01:12:16,672 --> 01:12:18,540
<i>I'm asking. I don't
understand the drops.</i>

1848
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:20,410
Let her finish.

1849
01:12:20,676 --> 01:12:22,038
Sorry, I wasn't following the...

1850
01:12:22,645 --> 01:12:24,525
I was... I don't know
where the drops came from.

1851
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:26,548
Sorry, please continue the...

1852
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:28,045
The drops.

1853
01:12:29,313 --> 01:12:30,992
<i>(Lucy) The little girl recovered
with each passing week,</i>

1854
01:12:31,016 --> 01:12:32,719
<i>until she was better
than before.</i>

1855
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,556
Bigger.

1856
01:12:34,591 --> 01:12:35,788
Stronger.

1857
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:37,020
Faster. And then...

1858
01:12:37,726 --> 01:12:39,121
one day, she was ready.

1859
01:12:39,992 --> 01:12:41,761
Ready to return to where
she came from,

1860
01:12:41,796 --> 01:12:43,499
to that tiny house

1861
01:12:43,765 --> 01:12:45,534
near the lake, by the woods.

1862
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,900
The little girl,
now fully grown,

1863
01:12:48,935 --> 01:12:51,672
and having blossomed
into a beautiful, young woman,

1864
01:12:51,971 --> 01:12:54,477
returned with her new family
to the village.

1865
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:55,809
And together,

1866
01:12:56,514 --> 01:12:58,877
they tracked down those men
who hurt her,

1867
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:00,681
One,

1868
01:13:00,716 --> 01:13:01,716
by one,

1869
01:13:01,981 --> 01:13:02,749
by one.

1870
01:13:02,784 --> 01:13:04,586
Okay, good.

1871
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:07,721
[haunting music]

1872
01:13:07,756 --> 01:13:08,788
Those men

1873
01:13:09,494 --> 01:13:11,428
who shattered her little body

1874
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:14,123
and broke her tiny heart,

1875
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:16,961
they coaxed them out
into the woods,

1876
01:13:16,996 --> 01:13:20,195
and they dragged them
into dark, dark caves,

1877
01:13:20,802 --> 01:13:21,900
<i>and they tied them up,</i>

1878
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:24,166
<i>and they broke their bones,</i>

1879
01:13:25,103 --> 01:13:27,675
<i>and then slowly, so slowly,</i>

1880
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:29,776
they killed them

1881
01:13:30,515 --> 01:13:31,943
and drained them of their blood.

1882
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,517
Wait...

1883
01:13:35,179 --> 01:13:36,179
I just... You said...

1884
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:37,916
What, you said caves?

1885
01:13:38,655 --> 01:13:40,050
N... what...?

1886
01:13:40,085 --> 01:13:41,656
Why'd you say caves?

1887
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,856
Tied them up in caves?

1888
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:45,561
Why'd you say that?

1889
01:13:45,596 --> 01:13:46,727
Listen.

1890
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,993
<i>(Hap) That's... weird.</i>

1891
01:13:49,028 --> 01:13:51,127
[foreboding music continues]

1892
01:13:51,162 --> 01:13:52,227
Sorry.

1893
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:54,229
<i>(Lucy) So...</i>

1894
01:13:55,465 --> 01:13:57,969
the young woman and her sisters
finished off that village,

1895
01:13:58,774 --> 01:13:59,905
and the next one,

1896
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:01,907
and the next one after that,

1897
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:03,843
until there were no more
villages of men

1898
01:14:03,878 --> 01:14:05,647
left in the entire country.

1899
01:14:06,947 --> 01:14:08,815
And then they left that place.

1900
01:14:09,147 --> 01:14:10,850
They put that world behind them,

1901
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:12,984
and they traveled far and wide.

1902
01:14:13,822 --> 01:14:15,085
Year after year.

1903
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:17,791
From town to town, city to city,

1904
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:20,090
leaving a bloody swathe
behind them

1905
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,532
that grew larger, and larger,

1906
01:14:22,567 --> 01:14:23,929
and larger still.

1907
01:14:24,932 --> 01:14:26,261
Until they came here,

1908
01:14:27,231 --> 01:14:28,604
<i>to this place.</i>

1909
01:14:29,707 --> 01:14:31,805
<i>Many, many years after
they first began.</i>

1910
01:14:33,578 --> 01:14:34,874
They bought many homes

1911
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:36,678
in which to hide in.

1912
01:14:36,713 --> 01:14:37,811
Dark, brooding places

1913
01:14:37,846 --> 01:14:39,582
where they could sleep by day

1914
01:14:39,617 --> 01:14:41,210
and feed at night.

1915
01:14:41,718 --> 01:14:43,619
<i>Lurking in the shadows.</i>

1916
01:14:43,951 --> 01:14:46,149
<i>Luring men and boys
to their lairs</i>

1917
01:14:46,184 --> 01:14:48,987
<i>to toy with them
however long they wished.</i>

1918
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:50,956
<i>Toy with them</i>

1919
01:14:51,893 --> 01:14:53,860
<i>and then pull them apart.</i>

1920
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:55,664
Slowly.

1921
01:14:56,964 --> 01:14:58,997
Piece by piece.

1922
01:15:00,132 --> 01:15:01,132
Limb

1923
01:15:01,771 --> 01:15:02,771
by limb.

1924
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:05,641
One after another,

1925
01:15:06,171 --> 01:15:07,171
<i>after another.</i>

1926
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:10,107
<i>And do you know what?</i>

1927
01:15:10,142 --> 01:15:11,142
What?

1928
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,880
They still do

1929
01:15:13,618 --> 01:15:14,947
to this very day.

1930
01:15:16,951 --> 01:15:18,984
Those three sisters
of the undead.

1931
01:15:20,086 --> 01:15:22,889
[music continues]

1932
01:15:22,924 --> 01:15:24,187
I just...

1933
01:15:24,222 --> 01:15:25,925
Is that... is that how it ends?

1934
01:15:27,896 --> 01:15:29,159
Who said anything about ending?

1935
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:30,633
It never ends.

1936
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:34,032
[exhales]

1937
01:15:36,806 --> 01:15:37,806
<i>(Lucy) Did you like it?</i>

1938
01:15:38,643 --> 01:15:39,906
<i>Our little story.</i>

1939
01:15:40,711 --> 01:15:42,909
It... [blows raspberry]

1940
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:46,979
Was intense. Fucking dark.

1941
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:49,883
Very well told.

1942
01:15:49,918 --> 01:15:52,017
Really good. Compelling.

1943
01:15:53,152 --> 01:15:55,955
[clock ticks speed up]

1944
01:15:58,355 --> 01:16:00,828
And lucky for me, there's only
two of you, right? [laughs]

1945
01:16:00,863 --> 01:16:01,863
Two what?

1946
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:03,766
Sisters.

1947
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:06,097
- Guess who.
- Holy fuck!

1948
01:16:06,132 --> 01:16:08,704
[menacing music]
Oh shit!

1949
01:16:08,739 --> 01:16:10,101
That scared... [laughs]

1950
01:16:10,675 --> 01:16:11,806
Oh man...

1951
01:16:12,303 --> 01:16:14,336
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

1952
01:16:14,371 --> 01:16:16,338
<i>That scared the shit out of me!</i>

1953
01:16:16,373 --> 01:16:20,144
Oh my God...
who the fuck are you now?

1954
01:16:20,179 --> 01:16:21,915
<i>(Lucy) This is our sister, Nora.</i>

1955
01:16:22,885 --> 01:16:23,885
Ha.

1956
01:16:23,985 --> 01:16:24,985
Hello.

1957
01:16:25,019 --> 01:16:26,381
Shit!

1958
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:27,987
Another sister.
- Yep.

1959
01:16:29,155 --> 01:16:30,990
Yeah, you didn't tell me
about her either.

1960
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:32,662
No, I didn't.

1961
01:16:32,697 --> 01:16:33,697
<i>(Hap) That's weird.</i>

1962
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:34,928
Okay, well...

1963
01:16:35,128 --> 01:16:37,194
[thump] Nice to meet you, Nora.

1964
01:16:37,229 --> 01:16:38,635
And you.

1965
01:16:38,934 --> 01:16:40,263
<i>(Hap) Yeah... how's it...</i>

1966
01:16:40,969 --> 01:16:42,489
You got me there.
That was really good.

1967
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:45,070
Oh my God, my fucking heart.

1968
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:47,039
[pants]

1969
01:16:47,074 --> 01:16:48,354
It was a good jump scare.
[claps]

1970
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:49,812
<i>Congrats.</i>

1971
01:16:49,847 --> 01:16:52,308
You still don't understand
what's going on, do you?

1972
01:16:52,343 --> 01:16:53,343
<i>Understand what?</i>

1973
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:54,916
What's happening here.

1974
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:56,686
What? You guys are like...

1975
01:16:57,722 --> 01:16:59,359
you know, like, messing with me
for some reason?

1976
01:16:59,383 --> 01:17:00,987
He's not very bright, is he?

1977
01:17:01,286 --> 01:17:02,286
<i>(Hap) What?</i>

1978
01:17:03,288 --> 01:17:04,288
Fucking rude.

1979
01:17:04,894 --> 01:17:05,992
I don't even know you.

1980
01:17:06,324 --> 01:17:07,324
Is this about...

1981
01:17:07,864 --> 01:17:09,127
Me and your sister...

1982
01:17:09,965 --> 01:17:11,470
What is this? What's going on?
I thought this was

1983
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:12,328
just the two of us.

1984
01:17:12,363 --> 01:17:13,230
Oh really?

1985
01:17:13,265 --> 01:17:14,231
Yeah.

1986
01:17:14,266 --> 01:17:15,426
Well, what about your friend?

1987
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:17,136
What friend?

1988
01:17:17,839 --> 01:17:19,302
The one who was going
to come over.

1989
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:21,106
Oh! The one who wanted pictures.

1990
01:17:21,812 --> 01:17:22,812
<i>That one.</i>

1991
01:17:23,275 --> 01:17:24,275
Oh God.

1992
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,376
I know what's going on here.

1993
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:29,114
That's crazy.

1994
01:17:29,446 --> 01:17:30,646
But you heard me on the phone.

1995
01:17:32,251 --> 01:17:33,987
I knew it.
I fucking knew it.

1996
01:17:34,022 --> 01:17:35,262
So what is this? What do you...

1997
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:37,496
Are you like teaching me
a lesson or something?

1998
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,319
Is that it?
- (Lucy) Why?

1999
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:40,125
Do you need to be
taught a lesson?

2000
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,424
Hey, what did I just say
to this one? Huh?

2001
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:43,962
This is between...

2002
01:17:43,998 --> 01:17:45,768
Can we just go somewhere
to talk, please?

2003
01:17:45,968 --> 01:17:46,800
Anything you have to say

2004
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:48,265
can be said
in front of my sisters.

2005
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,398
Oh come on!

2006
01:17:50,269 --> 01:17:52,236
I don't even think
you're actually sisters.

2007
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:53,776
But we are though.

2008
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:55,778
In blood.
- Okay!

2009
01:17:55,813 --> 01:17:57,109
Enough with the creepy shit!

2010
01:17:57,144 --> 01:17:58,979
It's... I get it!

2011
01:18:01,379 --> 01:18:02,379
