1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
ASHY ASH

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,074
ASHY-ASH

3
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,509
I was just doing my hair.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,195
Blue has sold me a broken TV.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,875
Let them get the plague. I have tonight.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,634
With whom? - Clyde.

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,635
With that sucker? - He does have a big cock.

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,351
Bessie, you're still a virgin? - Yes, for five years.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,193
I go for the golden cat.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,592
Well, help me with the TV. - Where'd you get that cart?

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,276
I thought it was clever. - Beware of my corn.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,079
Then go to the pedifure.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,834
Pedicure, trut.

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,594
Damn it, Carla. I miss all those soap operas and talk shows.

15
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,672
I put the video.

16
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,119
Bitch, we have no TV. - Little did I know.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,989
Get in there. I want to do my hair.

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,392
You want to look good, huh? - I'm always good.

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,233
Aside, junkies.

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,111
Never seen a TV? - Black, this goes back to Blue.

21
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,556
Our ghetto twins. Le and Imperial. Get out of here, we're closed.

22
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,515
I just wanted to do my hair. You and your stupid TV.

23
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,711
Here, here and sign here.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,549
About 40 minutes you will hear whether you get credit.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,790
Who are they? - Carla and Bessie. Good customers.

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,509
Why she swears that? - Bad upbringing.

27
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,196
It's always this cunt and cunt so. Even if they are in the church.

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,156
Pray for them.

29
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,353
I want my dough.

30
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,230
Blue, Black, give me my dough back otherwise I'll beat your ass.

31
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,155
Someone gets hit. What to do with the fucking TV?

32
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,678
Disappearing ugly monkeys otherwise I pick up the anti-bitches spray.

33
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,638
Road bitch and bitch away.

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,554
If I do not do with your sister, you get a couple bucks.

35
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,635
You can do anything. - Five Pompies but. Or four.

36
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,430
How's that? I can have you all.

37
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,831
And your grandmother is a cunt.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,798
And you stink out of your mouth.

39
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,872
Would you sometimes like Wesley Snipes?

40
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,157
Yes, I ram as Passenger 65 in your den.

41
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,518
If not that movie called. - You really are a stupid bitch.

42
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,036
And you've got a small pikkie. - You do too.

43
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,795
I put my dick in your ass, you know how to feel a real cock.

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,669
I pull your wig on your head, bitch consumption.

45
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,437
Quiet, Blue. Consider the case. This is a neat case.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,478
She can get the plague. - Consider the case.

47
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,553
What is it, Carla? - Pleurtuit on vetklep.

48
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,838
All right, sweetie? - I want my dough.

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,278
Sold is sold. But I like to satisfied customers.

50
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,718
And because I like you so much ... - Do not fall for it.

51
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,873
Go to our workshop in the 122nd street.

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,398
There they make him do. - How do we get that thing there?

53
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,109
Take it on your back. - Ho well. Customer service.

54
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,070
Lazer on, guy. - Tell him I'll pay.

55
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,279
And hurt your fine ass out.

56
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,594
I'll call you. - Two Pompies is more than enough.

57
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,230
Blue, so get ready anything.

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,315
Why do you send them to the workplace? Sold is sold.

59
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,032
Afraid Mims fucks her first? Why can you never really?

60
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,671
I have no appetite at all. - Why are you so?

61
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,958
You're a dick. - I can have you.

62
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,275
Your bullshit too much. Control yourself well, then you can fuck them both.

63
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,954
I want to fuck Carla alone.

64
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,796
But Bessie I want to fuck in a hundred years.

65
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,912
The public then. But in a doghouse I want to do her sewing.

66
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,909
Ugly bitch.

67
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,155
Sorry, I search number 9000. One Mr. Goldstein.

68
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,993
I see no numbers at all.

69
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,038
A gold mine in the ghetto.

70
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,192
Shit, like when those riots.

71
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,996
I want my money. - How shall I say it's not?

72
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,393
In French? Non. In Spanish? El Nono. As a baby? Uhuh.

73
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,472
This is 9000. Who are you looking for? - Goldstein.

74
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,359
That's me.

75
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,318
Are you Mr. Goldstein? - What are you looking at?

76
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,157
Do you think that we are all called Sammy? That no black Goldstein exists?

77
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,636
Rot op.

78
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,949
You certainly called Mr. Rogers? - Excuse me.

79
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,950
Sign here. Sorry I was lost.

80
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,398
If my boss finds out. - It's not uncommon.

81
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,109
They swap the house numbers.

82
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,431
What are you doing? - Is that Mr. Ginsberg?

83
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,639
My brother, Leroy Goldstein. Say Goldstein.

84
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,590
What's the matter? - Where do I 't drop?

85
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,354
For the effort.

86
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,035
Thank you. - 'T Put it down there.

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,994
now go back to the market. - Yet they buy anything.

88
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,277
No, but they steal it.

89
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,079
Here? - Yes.

90
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,118
I'll do this.

91
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,238
You've already given away our dough.

92
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,076
Go quickly. The bursting of the gangbangers here.

93
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,199
Rodney King is she still cross.

94
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,638
What to do with those boxes? - Here we can work with.

95
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,870
See what's inside.

96
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,038
Those things do not agree. - You know nothing about.

97
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,149
We are the first GSM wholesale nearby.

98
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,836
Everybody goes mobile calls. - How can we make than to those things?

99
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,436
Little Brother. Who has the chips.

100
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,593
We are going to make a hit. No more scams.

101
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,311
Then we'll find him. He's in the church, at Barrel Head.

102
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,117
Then we too go. We put this here in the car.

103
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,878
We do not have a car. - That's true.

104
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,875
Then we put them in the store. But soon we sat cars.

105
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,835
There is nobody.

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,676
Yes, otherwise Black did not send me here.

107
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,112
Hello, you have a customer.

108
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,956
We're closed. - I'll let these TVs.

109
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,192
At the expense of Black. - From Black?

110
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,353
Look what a good chocolate.

111
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,150
With your beautiful hair and your golden lips.

112
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,950
You are an African goddess. - You do not talk like an engineer.

113
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,476
I was just doing a TV. With this here.

114
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,275
They say you sew all those young girls.

115
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,070
Take an old woman like me. One that can bake cookies.

116
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,552
With self-raising flour? - I leave to rise much more.

117
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,556
Are you going to make that TV? - I have already seen it.

118
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,759
What then? - There 's new tube should.

119
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,948
Just a tube. Come on, after I have all kinds of tubes.

120
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,999
Are you going to grab a tube? - Yes.

121
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,879
Come you back? - Right away.

122
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,709
That is not a repair sounds, Mr. Mims.

123
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,669
You're not a pipe to tackle.

124
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,276
But they did. - Bessie, what have you got in your mouth?

125
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,315
A long finger.

126
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,833
Well, then I'll do it myself.

127
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,309
Dirty cunt Blue.

128
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,390
What are you looking at now?

129
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,233
Old Barrelhead.

130
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,675
Still murdered.

131
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,236
All kits, Little Brother? - Hey, Black. What are you doing here?

132
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,679
You were still friends? - Then you know me not really.

133
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,991
All right, Blue? - Everything cool.

134
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,277
Blessed are the mourners.

135
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,716
They will find comfort.

136
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,554
Blessed are the meek, they shall inherit the earth.

137
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,712
This guy is crazy, ripe for the establishment.

138
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,758
Night Train, which babe is crazy.

139
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,557
We need many peacemakers in this world.

140
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,475
Let him come. I pop that benefit trigger so down.

141
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,995
There he is. - True?

142
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,911
Fear Haas. - Stop with the jokes.

143
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,712
When I look at the church, then I see a few figures ...

144
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,476
which we describe as gangbangers.

145
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,837
I want a few words turn to you.

146
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,672
Why everyone turns around?

147
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,795
Shit, that's that old woman, Ms. Rose.

148
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,919
They swore that they would spit Barrel Heads coffin.

149
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,990
Barrel Head as a child with her broken ...

150
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,357
and shitting on the floor.

151
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,637
He had diarrhea? - Shut up.

152
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,153
Spit on him. - Shut up. Listen.

153
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,073
Do you still have that chip on which cell phones?

154
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,835
Not so suspicious, it's just one question.

155
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,869
So that's why you are here. Always business.

156
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,749
I'm talking about a lot of dough. No deaths.

157
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,708
Here's my card.

158
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,474
Glad you're dead, Barrel Head.

159
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,518
Dirty, arrogant bastard.

160
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,592
Do not fight. This is God's house.

161
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,719
The Lord will take you.

162
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,718
The Lord will punish you. And I.

163
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,997
Which that Barrel Head is broken?

164
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,518
Stitched in cornflakes. - Was he forget the milk?

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,709
Schijterd. - I made a joke.

166
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,476
On to the software.

167
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,393
Snap is me? - Yes.

168
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,314
What do you mean? What do you mean?

169
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,954
With whom am I speaking?

170
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,634
Lorraine, met Black.

171
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,793
Black, baby. Where have you been?

172
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,953
I've been waiting for your call. - Six months?

173
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,999
Can I make a call? - Is Blue too with you?

174
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,153
No, that's someone who wants to call.

175
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,028
Fool. - Honey, if I see you again?

176
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,354
I call for. Tomorrow, half a, tasty lunch.

177
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,035
Tell him I'll be too. I have to eat.

178
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,395
The Japanese at the lake. I'm here for a ...

179
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,395
in a red dress, high heels and without panties.

180
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,792
I wear a black shirt and boxer shorts no.

181
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,112
And I have a backstage pass to Kool Moe Dee.

182
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,113
And I have cowboy boots.

183
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,637
Completely naked with a belt, a pager and one mirror glasses.

184
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,678
Completely naked ...

185
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,957
with a sticker on my ass ...

186
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,749
a gold chain and a ring.

187
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,629
Stark naked with handcuffs, a whip ...

188
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,113
and a saddle on my back. - I'll call you. See you tomorrow.

189
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,550
I was calling. - You're sharpening of that chick.

190
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,315
Soon you will not even remember who is Black or Blue.

191
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,632
Honey, you look good.

192
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,588
Is that your phone or are you happy to see me?

193
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,914
Do you still work at the phone company?

194
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,517
Sit down. - My first time in Chinese.

195
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,915
Look at you.

196
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,514
Well done. - So?

197
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,356
I love my shoes. And I know what these are.

198
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,913
Hold on now.

199
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,958
You work there still? - Yes.

200
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,636
And I grab still crooks. - There's a crook who you can help.

201
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,189
How do you mean?

202
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,554
A friend of mine has a number of mobile phones ...

203
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,757
and I want to help him.

204
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,196
You're not going no Cloning frequencies?

205
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,715
Because we tackle every day.

206
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,431
No, I do not. But you can warn us.

207
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,912
Are not you cool? That could cost me my job.

208
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,835
I walk everywhere chefs. And how did you get those phones?

209
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,639
It's perfectly legal.

210
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,715
Soon you will go to jail. - No, first a cheeseburger.

211
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,794
Behave yourself.

212
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,714
What did you do? - I would never in lice.

213
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,113
I love too much. And I accept no.

214
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,156
Maybe we can arrange something. - I now thought.

215
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,118
Tuesday and Saturday, at eight o'clock.

216
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,195
With the smell of me and take your chocolate sauce.

217
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,912
En neem CD's mee van Sons of Funk,
Pushin' Inside en Slo James.

218
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,279
Wait a second. Every Tuesday and Saturday. Two times a week?

219
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,471
Are you going to think? - I do everything for you.

220
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,394
Because you're sweet and I'm the treat.

221
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,748
Cell phones, pagers and more. Come and see.

222
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,993
Your hair does not look. Honey babe, what are you beautiful.

223
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,358
Tupac. Come on, baby. Jane, you look good.

224
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,432
Lik je lips of.

225
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,229
When I'm done, you call as to Nairobi ...

226
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,675
in Egypt...

227
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,355
and nobody knows whose account.

228
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,917
Little Brother connect.

229
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,799
I hurt my finger.

230
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,838
I have no more gel.

231
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,992
Away from my car. Everyone in his turn.

232
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,712
Wait a minute. - Is he ready?

233
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,278
You look good. Turn around.

234
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,037
What have you got in your hand?

235
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,995
Take this one. If you call me, he always does it.

236
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,758
If I do not get to talk that old chips ...

237
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,229
Black is mad.

238
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,911
First deposit, then immediately come here.

239
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,198
It's delicious. Come and get a bit of money.

240
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,918
What is hot. Where are you?

241
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,517
I need a phone. And I hope he can on credit.

242
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,831
I thought I heard your voice, Tootsie Pop.

243
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,231
All right, Lola Mae? Girl...

244
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,157
I want credit. I need such a phone.

245
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,473
You know who these guys call the first as they are released.

246
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,758
Tootsie Pop. - They call immediately Tootsie Pop.

247
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,674
They want a nice jail cat.

248
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,318
Even your mother you borrow anything, so why would I do that?

249
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,995
That's why my mother in the closet.

250
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,639
Later I get arrested for assault.

251
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,713
Actually, I want to sit. - And then drop the soap.

252
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,759
En bukken. Bel de kit maar.

253
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,948
I get a little service? - From me though.

254
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,351
Get off me, maricon.

255
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,829
Delicious, foreign.

256
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,189
This mall attracts a lot of scum on it.

257
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,635
Mama Gert.

258
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,669
Mama Gert, I need money. - You get nothing.

259
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,276
I need real money. Listen to me.

260
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,716
For two dollars I lick your pussy wrinkled.

261
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,351
I still have warts the last time.

262
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,557
I did it just for you. - Bugger off.

263
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,636
Get out.

264
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,675
Let's see. It's a good one. Is that what? Dokken but.

265
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,230
And go. Here's another case.

266
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,949
I'm here. - Half an hour late.

267
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,240
Better late than never. - This is additional to do your best.

268
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,075
I'm exhausted. - If you only have chocolate sauce.

269
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,069
Come here with your goodies.

270
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,280
Faster, white.

271
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,275
Black & Blue Enterprises running great.

272
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,637
We are real ghetto entrepreneurs.

273
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,638
Of course I clear everything.

274
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,834
People, listen up.

275
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,275
There is an error in the system. Or maybe not.

276
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,831
Because only our department is affected.

277
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,597
I'm not sure if the diversion is really gone ...

278
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,833
but I tell you one thing: I'm going to figure this out.

279
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,756
I personally go into the field ...

280
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,950
and I'll keep you in mind. Is that clear?

281
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,149
No private conversations. This is a company.

282
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,993
This is not ordinary. Do you see that menu?

283
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,072
There you can buy stuff.

284
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,993
A hamburger with fries. Look.

285
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,312
And here send. And sending means.

286
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,911
And now I send you away. Come back tomorrow again.

287
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,713
I'm exhausted. - Now you can call me.

288
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,829
You know, we need help.

289
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,114
I'm tired, but we need to expand.

290
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,068
We need runners. - My cousin.

291
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,596
Fat Ass. He can help us.

292
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,433
Is he trustworthy?

293
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,958
This is not food. Besides, he could use some exercise.

294
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,754
Six months of free calls. We join you.

295
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,630
What is it?

296
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,031
Look. This costs 100, this 150.

297
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,638
Free calls. So happened.

298
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,633
Wherever you want. Six months.

299
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,953
There's my boy. He is now a real businessman.

300
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,317
We are so proud of you.

301
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,675
Bye grandma.

302
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,594
Can you grandma Gert borrow a thousand dollars?

303
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,638
Two days ago already.

304
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,395
So what? I had to do my hair and my nails.

305
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,677
I must still look neat?

306
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,355
What a bullshit. Oh, thank you.

307
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,837
Once your payment is received, I want it back.

308
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,037
I you happen to be reared.

309
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,512
Do you want a spanking? Cutie me.

310
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,598
Bye Bye. Stay strong.

311
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,512
117 songs in one day?

312
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
This is about work.

313
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,191
All kits?

314
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,989
Nice weather is not it? Nice phone.

315
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,992
Did you buy in the store?

316
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,274
Do you know Black and Blue?

317
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,558
You've got one too. Do you know Black and Blue?

318
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,636
Do you know where I can find brothers?

319
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,717
Do you know Black and Blue?

320
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,835
Okay, Black and Blue GSM connections.

321
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,560
See if he does.

322
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,196
I want for 40 bucks marijuana.

323
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,834
Yes, you deliver me for weeks. Do not you?

324
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,434
I understand nothing of it.

325
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,835
What a kuttelefoon.

326
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,234
Do you marijuana? - Who is this?

327
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,235
Who do you think? Deliver me what to smoke.

328
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,790
I do not have you. - Call me either.

329
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,797
Fuck you. - Get out yourself the plague.

330
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,196
I have to dial a number.

331
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,709
I press the repeat button.

332
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,193
Phones for sale.

333
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,080
GSM's and Coop.

334
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,678
Ten pieces for Roscoe.

335
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,674
Roscoe. - I stutter sometimes, convex?

336
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,674
I want the best. Not those cheap junk.

337
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,195
Do you have money?

338
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,789
You deserve punishment for such a stupid question.

339
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,316
Save yourself. - Mr T-Lay ...

340
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,436
Harder.

341
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,036
Harder. And now those phones.

342
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,237
Hurry up. - Well, Mr. T-Lay.

343
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,634
Pas op m'n self.

344
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,869
Blue, Mom wants her money back.

345
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,919
You've already eaten one leg. - Not at all.

346
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,317
Here, a magic lamp. If mom here every Wednesday rubs on ...

347
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,190
while standing on one leg, comes money.

348
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,669
And buy even a new shirt.

349
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,712
Give me something to eat.

350
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,035
Here. - I have no pigs feet.

351
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,637
Tomato sauce? - I have not eaten in a week.

352
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,872
Take a pair of shoes. - I already have that one.

353
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,715
Just give me some food. - I got something better.

354
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,236
With this wand get all your wishes.

355
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,589
we're going to do great? Listen, acorns.

356
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,435
I kill myself. Black, give me five dollars.

357
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,910
Otherwise, I kill myself.

358
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,117
You would opduvelen. - Give me five dollars.

359
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,477
I also make this babe.

360
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,553
Stay away from her. Let her go.

361
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,952
I kill myself. Just give me three dollars.

362
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,272
For 50 cents I blow you. - Piss off.

363
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,159
Beat it.

364
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,749
Fuck off.

365
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,434
That fool is no longer there.

366
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,558
For 50 cents, you say?

367
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,595
I stand for a while dry.

368
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,597
Andrew, put that sinful thing out.

369
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,150
Listen to your father. And go first bath.

370
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,677
Below the table is the holy oil from the doopset ...

371
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,434
and grab exactly what washing powder.

372
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,469
Before you go to Bible lesson you need to clean yourself.

373
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,552
Satan knows how to find the dirt.

374
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,714
And wash your wiener. - Yes, Mom.

375
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,155
These are the Baker Boys, and it's a party here.

376
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,235
We are not experts. But we are.

377
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,840
We'll be back again.

378
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,999
For such an ugly motherfucker T-Lay have handsome wives.

379
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,039
Nag not. Note prefer your pager.

380
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,517
Wait a second. All right, wijffie?

381
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,433
Who is a wijffie here? - What now?

382
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,355
You're a wijffie. - Watch your mouth.

383
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,718
The only one who is not wijffie is Roscoe.

384
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,589
Who do you think I am? - Sorry, Roscoe.

385
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,153
Definitely a bad line. Your phone is not good.

386
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,279
Do you hear that? - That seems Roscoe though.

387
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,319
There's dough again. 70 backs, you have to make it.

388
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,156
Three hours, four passes, seventh row, upper cabinet.

389
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,914
no hurry, because there is.

390
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:55,468
Seventh row, he said. Just ask your mother if she sprays out your ears.

391
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,953
Shut up about my mother. You're lucky it's so busy.

392
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,749
When we're at home, you get hit.

393
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,230
I'm not naked. That's crazy.

394
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,197
You're on the radio. - I am busy.

395
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,114
Should I tell 't Roscoe? - I'm talking to Roscoe.

396
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,431
We hear you on the radio.

397
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,751
It is about two deaths.

398
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,833
Listen, do not say anything more. Everyone can hear us.

399
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,390
Can not a damn. Go get my 70 backs ...

400
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,950
or I'll take you to the construction site.

401
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,998
We have a problem. - Is this Fat Ass?

402
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,995
We have unleashed the gold rush. - How do you mean?

403
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,518
T-Lay was heard on the radio thanks to the fucking mobile phones.

404
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,593
Roscoe said had to get T-Lay 70 backs.

405
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,639
True? - No idea. Everyone is on 't seek.

406
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,517
Shit Black and I are in trouble.

407
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,270
Four fit.

408
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,317
Upper cabinet.

409
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,274
And, Roscoe.

410
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,470
Black and Blue go out.

411
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,950
I will personally make sure.

412
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,351
I let them sleep forever.

413
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,278
I do not want to set an example.

414
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,109
Hey, dude. Go effe hit good against the pocket.

415
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,833
Hai, good thing. - All kits piece?

416
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,753
Not so fast.

417
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,674
I want to enjoy it. - Are not you ready yet?

418
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,958
Red or white? - Red, like your lovely lips.

419
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,917
Who is that? - Are you expecting someone?

420
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,714
Blue.
- Doe open.

421
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,156
Imagine not.

422
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,079
We should disappear. - No good thing will remain here.

423
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,834
Roscoe wants to murder us.

424
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,675
What are you talking about? - The mobile phones? 70 backs?

425
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,037
It was on the radio. Everyone could hear it.

426
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,636
Are not you cool? - Do I look like Bushwick?

427
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,794
Wait. Was it on the radio? Then justice also comes back.

428
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,997
Quiet, we still know nothing.

429
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,994
Bro, we have to go into hiding for a while.

430
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,151
I have a rule.

431
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,396
Wrong button.

432
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,038
We'll get back to you. - I'll say.

433
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,069
That chick is perverse. You can still start a penis museum.

434
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,675
Is that chocolate? - Are we in Batgrot?

435
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,912
So I knew you and thingy.

436
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,395
My company examines all files. My boss loved me all the holes.

437
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,393
You can not erase everything?

438
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,791
If they do, we lose our customers.

439
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,431
And it's too late. - We need that black box.

440
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,388
We just have to go into hiding. - I take care of this ...

441
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,917
and you take care of me. - And you sleep on the couch.

442
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,516
No, I dive nice to her in bed.

443
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,159
I must have one pillow.

444
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,840
Nice thing is there for you. Do what you gotta do.

445
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,271
I wait in bed for you. - We can go to sleep better.

446
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,830
She's just using you. I'm lying on the couch.

447
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,835
Then may I bake fries, and I'm going to make real money.

448
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,271
And then you can come and eat free.

449
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,109
Was that a nightmare or a wet dream?

450
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,828
Wipe your face.

451
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,754
We're going to get the black box. - Are you ready?

452
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,910
Candles blown out?

453
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,516
You really are crazy. - That bitch does to voodoo.

454
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,797
What were you doing all this?

455
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,839
I even heard you scream. Mom, save me.

456
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,073
I sat there deeply. Until my balls.

457
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,799
You should not keep it all for yourself them.

458
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,590
I have too many women? - You're just like a drill.

459
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,512
Wait a second. Look there.

460
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,431
Run.

461
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,834
Bitched.

462
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,118
I blow your ass up.

463
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,480
Doe open, Mr Mims.

464
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,234
Uncle. - Open up.

465
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,430
Who is there? - We.

466
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,750
Black in Blue.

467
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,117
Come on. - Get out.

468
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,430
They're shooting at us. - Hurry back.

469
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,717
Well open up.

470
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,953
Why did not you call? - The phones are part.

471
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,190
Stand there.

472
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,710
How did you get all those TVs? - All of your customers.

473
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,031
What's that smell? - There are a few rules.

474
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,873
You can not interfere with my business.

475
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,998
He was fucking. - Not at all.

476
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,598
As long as you're not a cousin. - I'm just enjoying myself. Come in.

477
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,035
Shit, they're naked.

478
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,553
Well I have to share my bitches.

479
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,237
Damn, what a secret.

480
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,233
He has much more than TVs.

481
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,829
What a paradise. - The tits heaven.

482
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,759
Your uncle is a recipient.

483
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,071
But there are rules. Hands off.

484
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,152
I just do not touch you.

485
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:05,838
Be glad, soon succumbs your heart. We will save your life.

486
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,912
Do not, I'm doing this for twenty years.

487
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,200
You will not stiff anymore. - Yes, I have one now.

488
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,429
Thank you. I get credit anywhere else.

489
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,511
We are also not Sears.

490
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,798
If you do not pay, we just get everything back.

491
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,236
So easy is not. - Next.

492
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,393
Everything good? Listen ... - We're closed.

493
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,477
Honey babe, why are you so unkind?

494
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,473
Who's going about mobile phones?

495
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,076
Because I have a lot klantjes for him.

496
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,030
I do not like those types like you. - You do not even know me.

497
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,672
Oh yes. Three years ago you beaten me in chains.

498
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,992
To hell with your smeriskop.

499
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,390
Send me away?

500
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,234
That was it, folks.

501
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,036
Dirty cop. Thinks I'm do not know.

502
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,668
Black and Blue, where are you?

503
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,035
Not a peep.

504
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,471
What can I do for you? - That's a robbery, bitch.

505
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,269
Come on with the dough. - Please, Ninja Turtle.

506
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,273
I'm not kidding. - Where's the rest?

507
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,037
You've cost me 70 grand. - Buy you doing but a new eye.

508
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,152
She bullshit. I make her cold.

509
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,950
Shoot me. If I were a guy, you would not dare.

510
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,833
Bastards, I'll get you guys.

511
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,231
Filling. - Take that, acorns.

512
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,597
Sale but a new eye, disabled dick.

513
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,116
I have a headache from that half-blind.

514
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,476
Hey, sailor. Got a light?

515
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,389
I believe so.

516
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,475
Sailor, you fancy a diversion?

517
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,269
I'm not a sailor. I am of the Cellular Two fraud department.

518
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,912
I do a search for all those cell phones here in this district.

519
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,197
You can call it better walkie-talkies.

520
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,194
If I get to tackle Black and Blue.

521
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,756
En Lorraine.
- Van Cellular Two?

522
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,191
Are they in trouble? How terrible.

523
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,194
I with my big mouth. - Does not matter.

524
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:06,434
This is just a preliminary investigation. And I never betray my sources.

525
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,910
What are you brave. - Is bad.

526
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,716
What's your name...

527
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,998
big, strong guy?

528
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,355
Dalton. And you?

529
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,512
Around here they call me ...

530
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,274
Tootsie Pop.

531
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,992
Because you need a lot of lick before you get to the real goodies.

532
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,589
Tootsie Pop. What a nice name.

533
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,713
Shall we go talk somewhere?

534
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,310
You are big. - Do you love that?

535
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,392
This is not my day.

536
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,799
I have a headache. - Can I help?

537
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,112
Where are these jerks? - I've got a couple of acorns, taco.

538
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,555
Goodbye, klojo.

539
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,632
I cover this work. Today.

540
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,830
Lorraine. Immediately to my office.

541
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,675
By close.

542
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,470
Black and Blue. - I can explain.

543
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,191
I was in the neighborhood. This is illegal, Lorraine.

544
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,716
I trusted you. How could you do that?

545
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,474
You are fired. - Fine.

546
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,831
I get you guys.

547
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,436
Businessman are not easy.

548
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,793
Black in Blue.

549
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,190
Why do they call you Black?

550
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,875
Because I have the best balls in the ghetto.

551
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,589
And why he is called Blue? - Because he's wearing blue clothes.

552
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,638
There you have to be for no light.

553
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,156
That submerge like it.

554
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,073
I fuck so still a smoothness.

555
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,235
What a ghost town. Where is everyone?

556
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,078
Come here. - What is it?

557
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,869
I want to talk with you. - What is it?

558
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,110
Hands up.

559
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,753
Are you armed? - Look.

560
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,357
That's not mine. - Do not lie.

561
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,230
Now you're alone, huh? - Come with me.

562
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,113
How would that fat coming?

563
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,636
My mother beats me rotten. - Indeed.

564
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,991
All cars to Crebs Avenue. A marital quarrel.

565
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,119
Since you still live? - Your wife with my father.

566
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,556
Shut up, bulbous glans. - Quiet.

567
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,836
Stupid sufkut.

568
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,989
Grace.

569
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,990
Grace. - Martha.

570
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,277
It's not what you think. Not really, darling.

571
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,432
She is perverse. - Honey ...

572
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,876
What is happening here? - Shut up.

573
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,429
I'll get you.

574
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,632
Had than done your duty.

575
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,471
Pleasant.

576
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,275
You still have your panties only. - Seven.

577
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,113
Pull it out.

578
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,153
Are you there? - Who is that?

579
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,357
Do you have 't tell her? - Not me.

580
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,595
You're there.

581
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,110
Black, is that you? I see you. Open up.

582
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,909
Is that you, snoepie? Why do you make so much noise?

583
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,277
Are you here? Everyone is worried sick.

584
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,159
What's wrong with you?

585
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,959
Pull out. - What was that?

586
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,032
Blue looks to show a porn cheated.

587
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,311
His grandmother wants back again.

588
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,916
What's wrong with your phone? Everybody calls you.

589
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,992
Which is broken. - That'll do.

590
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,790
T-Lay has Lola Mae robberies, Andrew was arrested and I'm ...

591
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,238
What? - Fired. You're hiding something.

592
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,834
Not at all.

593
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,317
Black, I knew it.

594
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,391
Now I'm really in trouble.

595
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,310
Gentlemen, I do not know if you realize how serious the situation is ...

596
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,996
but America's communications system at risk.

597
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,913
Take a seat.

598
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,837
Uncle Dalton ... Dalton works at the Cellular Two fraud department.

599
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,996
He helped us very well. - And it was a pleasure.

600
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,479
His information you find in the report.

601
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,191
You go pick up someone. One Little ...

602
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:41,549
Little Broder. I want you to hear him to the highest degree.

603
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,030
And these two individuals ...

604
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,399
Black and Blue, are probably the ringleaders.

605
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,712
But we do not want them prematurely alarming.

606
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,996
Not yet.

607
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,912
Dit is nou de FBI, James.
High-tech surveillance.

608
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,830
Lovely.

609
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,310
There he is.

610
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,189
Halt. - Who are you?

611
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,353
Put your weapon down. You're under arrest.

612
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,832
You must always have the black.

613
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,676
I needed five minutes. - Five weeks will mean you.

614
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,590
T-Lay en z'n bende.

615
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,599
Black. Blue. Where are you?

616
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,469
Wait a minute. Look. Look at this. Over there.

617
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,474
Are not you scared?

618
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,151
Should you have?

619
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,436
Get him.

620
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,236
Will you fight? Bring it on.

621
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,831
What are you doing?

622
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,637
I kick your ass.

623
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,070
Is this what you want?

624
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,990
T-Lay is felled.

625
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,391
Who won?

626
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,516
Listen, asshole. Your fingerprints on those chips.

627
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,273
I can no longer keep him in check.

628
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,115
And I do not want to. - Val nice death.

629
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,431
I say no one silly nut.

630
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,871
What is this?

631
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,275
He is unconscious.

632
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,552
You should take care that mask.

633
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,598
You've ruined it all.

634
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,070
Because you're such a hothead.

635
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,436
Idiot, now I have nothing worked for ten years.

636
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,195
It was your idea. I knew it would be 't nothing.

637
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,194
What is happening here? - A quarrel between friends.

638
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,920
I go to the carpool place.

639
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,199
Can I make a call?

640
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,751
The Lord is my shepherd. - God help us. Cunt.

641
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,833
He leads me to calm waters.

642
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,039
Do you know the holy word?

643
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,958
I know how much money is in it.

644
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,190
This is holy oil, against demons.

645
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,630
That's for my eyes. It needs a prescription.

646
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,473
Give my purse but returned.

647
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,596
Where is my son?

648
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,190
I am ready. Backward, Satan.

649
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,069
You go to the conflagration. I'm not afraid.

650
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,630
Fade, demons. Look that crack junkies now.

651
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,156
Your mom. You go for a thousand years in hell.

652
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,475
I banish you. Fade, demons.

653
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,030
I have holy water. You all.

654
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,270
Chaka Khan.

655
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,749
There's my boy.

656
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,438
What the blanket will think? Am I not again 't Year Mother.

657
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,388
Sister Wanda will it be again. That bitch.

658
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,876
Beware.

659
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,312
You are now going to eight times a week for Bible study.

660
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,191
And you may also host a second address anymore.

661
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,313
I have not finished yet. You are about to polish the furniture blanket ...

662
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,040
and you get house arrest.

663
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,395
How long? - Forever.

664
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,710
No phone calls.

665
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,078
I gave you a simple command, and what is the result?

666
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,994
A suspect escaped from verhoorcel ...

667
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,913
and you are missing.

668
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,798
You get another chance.

669
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,315
That was all. And no more blunders.

670
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:02,033
Black and Blue, or you're very stupid ...

671
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:08,799
or you're mad that you think you can win it from Roscoe.

672
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,430
I do not want a sermon, but weapons.

673
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,909
It's your life.

674
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,514
I just mean. The weapons we have.

675
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,399
Where are the car keys?

676
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,836
That's'm not. - Where is he?

677
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,150
There he sits.

678
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,552
That can not be our car. - Calm down but.

679
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,628
Look, you called half an hour ago.

680
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,270
Give me two hours and you get one of those.

681
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,795
We should have called sooner.

682
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,317
I'm going with you. Are you going away?

683
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,910
Stupid Ice Cube imitation. - Hold on, soon you die.

684
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,640
Do you think it works?

685
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,394
Ever seen one?

686
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,553
You keep the engine running and I trade everything.

687
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,398
Black, what are you doing here? They search everywhere.

688
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,028
Give me something to drink.

689
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,869
What do you want? - Talk to Roscoe.

690
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:53,875
With Roscoe? Okay. But then he makes you surely.

691
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,276
So you do not want a babe? - We do not like whores.

692
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,070
Wives are like joints. Trekkie take and pass.

693
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,438
Let your dough's see. Eight in the corner.

694
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,070
I am below. We make thousands of.

695
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,870
Is he sometimes good? - I've just bought dope for.

696
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,196
Phone.

697
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,835
With whom am I speaking? I hope it comes to dough.

698
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,037
With Black. - How dare you come here?

699
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,953
Hebrews is m'n point?

700
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,479
I come for. Since I could not do anything.

701
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,519
But I'm as mad as you are. I've got a bomb on me.

702
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,116
If I do not get my way, I blow everything ...

703
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,078
because I am who sat flights.

704
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,479
Those two criminals ...

705
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,837
are having fun in the strip club.

706
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,554
You keep only live if you pay 70 grand plus interest.

707
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,157
I got a better deal for you. We've got a cell phone commercial.

708
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,359
With us you earn more than those of your partners.

709
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,315
I'm the boss on the street.

710
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,790
I have contacts and the black box.

711
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,396
But T-Lay have to leave me alone.

712
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:29,793
Blue and I do all the work and let us tell you.

713
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:34,158
Do not worry about T-Lay. That is the brother of my wife.

714
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,114
I'm a real businessman. I have a nose for business.

715
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,795
So you first go to pay off 70 grand ...

716
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,715
and then we talk about a partnership.

717
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,669
Clear. - I'll call you.

718
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,912
You'll get your money. I call you.

719
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,352
One Time can not save you now.

720
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,957
I'm talking regularly with Roscoe. So leave me alone.

721
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,871
You think you're the only armed?

722
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,315
T-Lay, come up ...

723
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,870
Black before doing something you can not.

724
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,190
Go quickly.

725
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,511
This is a personal thing for me.

726
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,069
I get cold.

727
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,995
You go wash dishes. I see you on the street, wijffie.

728
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,311
Greetings to you and your girls.

729
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,075
Piss off.

730
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:45,997
New plans. Find his contact and the black box.

731
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,277
We take the market over and finish them off.

732
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,552
Why will concentrate on me?

733
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,553
What happened?

734
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:06,840
We can breathe a sigh. I can talk to Roscoe.

735
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,436
There they are.

736
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,233
Those guys watching us.

737
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,437
What guys? - That one over there.

738
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,115
How do you mean? - They keep an eye on us.

739
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,750
They look and look and look.

740
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,356
What are you doing?

741
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,750
Wie is dat? - FBI.

742
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,036
Aries soon be a hot dog, I'm hungry.

743
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,673
Think a bit about my bladder.

744
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,149
Crawl out and close the hood.

745
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,232
Just pretend you can fly.

746
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,236
Come on, Robin.

747
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,630
Shut the hood.

748
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,756
Not.

749
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,309
Finally do some good.

750
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,719
What is wrong with you?

751
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,270
That will cost you ten dollars. - Later.

752
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,839
Take it easy. - Come and get me, acorns.

753
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,995
What are you, James?

754
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:25,231
This is a real car and they've got a van. Ram them.

755
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,438
You want us dead?

756
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,836
I drive by.

757
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,589
What are you doing on the road? What's wrong with you?

758
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,239
They'll be.

759
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,914
Is everything alright?

760
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,550
Fat Ass, what are you doing here? Go quickly to your mother.

761
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,711
Help even.

762
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:21,391
He's heavy. - Hurry up.

763
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,597
Why not let that fool lie?

764
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,389
We go to the place where we always hang out.

765
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,472
Leave it just lie to him.

766
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,756
Here's it.

767
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,079
I make him open it.

768
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:41,711
Black box. White cop. - The right cover you need.

769
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,829
See if they watch it.

770
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,998
My back. - Help him to his feet.

771
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,670
No more wisecracks. Otherwise I do what.

772
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,198
Those guys did not give me any dough.

773
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,278
You are such mobile phones.

774
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,156
What's he saying?

775
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,748
Listen smoothness, men. We do not want trouble.

776
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,878
Kill them, man. - The mobile phones are okay.

777
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:50,717
We give you three days remaining and a free pager.

778
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,599
And a candy jar.

779
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,920
I now get five dollars?

780
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,309
I kick your ass.

781
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,635
I'm gonna 'let him tap.

782
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,556
These are my cronies.

783
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,756
Who calls he?

784
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,514
Black. Blue. Acorns.

785
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,238
CENSORED

786
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,116
Goddamn.

787
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,909
Damn, Black and Blue.

788
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,958
Those dogs have caught me a lot.

789
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,358
They did not find us here? - Of course not.

790
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,875
What a stench.

791
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,238
Listen.

792
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,790
Betting for 100 balls that I love you win?

793
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,794
Where are we? - Near the basketball court.

794
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,676
We're going out.

795
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,871
What the hell.

796
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,351
I still have to finish you.

797
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,991
Drop dead.

798
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,989
Come out of the trunk. We have a surprise.

799
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,628
That the police is not there?

800
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,196
Let op Black.

801
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:02,870
I got a deal for you. - Thaw make no deals.

802
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,110
Put them down there.

803
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,874
Black, I know that this babe of yours is your connection.

804
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,476
Tell me where the black box, otherwise you go to sleep.

805
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,279
We do not sleep. - Shut up.

806
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,552
Armed she dare.

807
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,838
Mad Dog, put that thing on. I'm going to shred.

808
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,114
And it does not mess up.

809
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,113
Stoopid, watch them. I'm going to shit.

810
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,033
You stink otherwise been pretty.

811
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,397
Shut up. I'm done with you.

812
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,916
If they do anything, bang them down.

813
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:56,392
Your suit is too tight. Get tasty one yeast infection.

814
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,271
Baby, here I am again. You have those two times for me.

815
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,393
A movement and you go to it.

816
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:21,392
Do not move. Otherwise I get you down.

817
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:27,237
What are we doing? That bunch of petty thieves will kill us.

818
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,109
I'm thinking. - Soon we'll go out.

819
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:36,070
Quiet. We'll just go a little smoke.

820
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,516
Why? What are we going to smoke?

821
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:45,712
As we go to the angels, I want some substance, you know?

822
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,032
Hear's, Mr. gangbanger.

823
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,398
Should we not first be effe high?

824
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:02,031
I got a joint with me. You may also choose a pair of pull.

825
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,279
No fooling. - No, we're going to die.

826
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,712
Finally, you do something good.

827
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,119
I put him well for you.

828
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,271
Do not do it.

829
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,473
It was a one-off. A trekkie and you're gone.

830
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,710
Maak me.

831
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,075
He survives t, however.

832
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,355
Word but tasty high.

833
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:02,272
Is your daze now? - Mr. killer? Murderer?

834
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,428
Is there a toilet? - What the hell?

835
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,114
I've been waiting for.

836
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,834
I should not eat burritos.

837
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,591
Bunch of bunglers. - Stoopid, everything okay?

838
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,395
And, baas.

839
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,235
I am almost finished. It can also bog road.

840
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,790
The toilet is gone. Cross-eyed bastard.

841
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,028
You tell Roscoe that he found 70 grand can forget.

842
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,829
And forget not ass wipe, squinting.

843
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,594
I'm really not afraid of you.

844
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,399
I should beat your ass.

845
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,796
Come on. - You all again?

846
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,316
My head. - Fortunately, the T-Lay really stupid.

847
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,156
He was last without gasoline. - We had 't do.

848
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,470
Black box.

849
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,438
Black cop.

850
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,711
What is that? Shut out.

851
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,552
What was saying? - Mistake me.

852
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,439
Stop with the jokes.

853
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,432
Hold on to that black box. We need to get back to work.

854
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,790
Kom 's here.

855
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,599
I stand for. - Come here.

856
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,910
Why now?

857
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,431
There they are.

858
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,830
This is our chance.

859
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,517
Do not move. - What now? Men in b / ack?

860
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,791
Shut up.

861
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,157
Those are the blacks. - What are you talking about?

862
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,276
Give my mask back.

863
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,119
We should go for that preference scheme.

864
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,955
They are gone. - What did they look like?

865
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,873
Als Roger Rabbit en de Penguin.

866
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,157
Als Amos en Andy.
- Als OJ en Nicole.

867
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,995
OJ and Nicole? - Black and white.

868
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,072
And he who has beaten me?

869
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,913
There was a fly on your face.

870
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,719
I want to save your ass.

871
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,269
And we need you.

872
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,793
Is that right? - Yes.

873
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,713
I'll see you later. Greetings.

874
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:58,075
where would that black box? - That I destroyed.

875
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,391
I got you, Lorraine. You're going to jail.

876
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,509
Quiet, Johnnie Cochlan. - Dalton. I've been looking everywhere.

877
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,956
We would go out to eat last night.

878
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,680
Where were you?

879
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,473
Did you say that you've got a rod?

880
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:24,556
A branch with two apples. - And a small garden.

881
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,834
They have never mentioned it ...

882
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,072
but I have no secrets.

883
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,348
I want my $ 40.

884
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,638
Did you have some makeup on? That's why it took so long.

01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:57,035
Oh no, you get me a beating.

01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:52,200
Or did you think to marry?

900
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,875
