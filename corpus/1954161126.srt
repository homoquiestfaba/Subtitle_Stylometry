~ZombiRG~
ZiLLa

1
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:05,322
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

2
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:06,862
Some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:08,862
Jesus!
Her water's broken!

4
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:10,902
She's going into
uterine contractions!

5
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:13,282
We'll have to do
a C-section!

6
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:12,642
What you got down there,
little man?

7
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:14,352
Oh, that's
my heat seeker.

8
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:16,442
I'll bet it is.

9
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:17,522
Aah!

10
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:19,152
Ha ha ha!

11
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:20,652
So, where are we going?

12
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:22,322
It's a surprise,
baby.

13
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:24,112
Yeah, I like surprises.

14
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:26,992
Yeah.

15
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:32,292
Whoo!
Oh, my God!

16
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:35,372
What the fuck
are we doing here?

17
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:39,462
Whoo! Look at all that.

18
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:42,092
Ha ha ha!

19
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:44,472
What the fuck is that?

20
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:50,972
Hey!

21
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,482
What did you just say?

22
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:36,322
Wow.

23
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:52,672
Whoo! Hey, what's up?

24
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,212
Unh! Man!

25
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:05,102
Whoo!

26
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:07,062
All right.

27
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:09,232
Ha ha ha!

28
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:15,162
Yeah.

29
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:17,122
Whoo!

30
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:31,342
Ha ha ha!

31
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:33,552
What's happening?

32
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:35,052
Unh!

33
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,522
Whoa!

34
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:43,652
Man.

35
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,072
Fuck.

36
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:03,252
Fuck. I need a drink.

37
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,582
Ahh!

38
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:52,352
No! No!

39
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,942
Aah!

40
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,822
What's wrong, baby?

41
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,822
Aah! Aah!

42
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:05,072
No! No!

43
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:08,372
Aah! No!

44
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:11,492
Ha ha ha!

45
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:57,262
Is that him?

46
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:59,012
Jesus, that's him.

47
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:02,222
It's Blade.
It's the daywalker.

48
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,502
Come on, daywalker!

49
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:37,482
Aah!

50
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:48,152
Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!

51
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:49,612
Unh!

52
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,462
Aah!

53
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,882
Aah!

54
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:45,222
That's him!
That's him! Get him!

55
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:46,552
Fuck him up!

56
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:49,772
We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.

57
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:52,352
Whoo!

58
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:56,902
Yaah!

59
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:41,742
Yaah!

60
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:58,182
Quinn...

61
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:01,812
I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

62
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:09,732
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

63
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,652
Give my regards to Frost.

64
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,332
No! Please don't!

65
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:35,842
Put him out.

66
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:38,392
Yes, sir.
Paramedics.

67
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:04,342
Got a charred cadaver here
for you. Still warm, too.

68
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:06,422
1, 2,3.

69
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:13,812
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

70
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,272
Paramedics said
he was still screaming

71
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:20,142
when they found him
stapled to a wall.

72
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,442
That's very pretty.

73
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:36,582
Did you check
the chem count?

74
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:38,662
His blood sugar's
3 times norm,

75
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,462
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

76
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:44,102
You took this
off a D.O.A.?

77
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,352
Yeah.

78
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,562
But this doesn't
make any sense.

79
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,152
The red blood cells
are biconvex,

80
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:54,652
which is impossible.

81
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:58,442
Look at the polys.
They're binucleated.

82
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:04,492
OK, Curtis, it's 3.00
in the morning-

83
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:05,952
This is not a joke.

84
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:09,582
I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.

85
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:12,372
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

86
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:15,542
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

87
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:25,392
OK. Show me the body.

88
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,062
And I don't want to hear
a word about us.

89
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:31,102
Done. We've had
that conversation.

90
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:36,902
You haven't started on
the internal organs yet?

91
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:40,072
Just a blood sample
through the pericardium.

92
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,912
The maxilla looks
a little deformed.

93
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,712
There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

94
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:49,172
I'm going
to start the "Y"

95
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:51,012
and check
the tracheal mucosa.

96
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,972
Let me ask you
something.

97
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,062
Honestly...

98
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,812
you ever have second
thoughts about us?

99
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:07,942
Sometimes.

100
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,902
But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.

101
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:13,442
Want to cut me
some slack here?

102
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:16,322
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

103
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:17,372
Look, Curtis-

104
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:18,952
I'm trying.

105
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:20,332
It's over.

106
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:32,422
Yaah!

107
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,512
Aah!

108
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,932
Call security!

109
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,122
Aah!

110
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:58,922
Came back
to finish you off.

111
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:00,462
Get out of my way,
you freak!

112
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,012
Freeze!

113
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:14,932
Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?!

114
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:16,312
Aah!
Aah!

115
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:20,902
Yaah!

116
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,862
Aah!

117
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,542
Hey, you! Freeze!

118
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,052
Aah!

119
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:21,092
Aah!

120
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,342
Aah!

121
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:27,722
Freeze!

122
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:30,102
Hold it right there!

123
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:40,532
Aah! Aah!

124
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:46,452
My shoulder.

125
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:49,082
It's dislocated.

126
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:53,582
Aah!

127
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:00,432
Uhh!

128
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:39,582
Whistler.

129
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:44,712
Whistler.

130
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:52,562
Bringing home
strays now?

131
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:56,182
She's been bitten.

132
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:01,982
Should've
killed her, then.

133
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:04,032
Yeah, I know.

134
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,002
But I didn't.

135
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:16,802
You watch her close.

136
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,052
If she starts to turn,
you finish her off.

137
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,642
Or I will.

138
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:29,602
Uhh.

139
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,572
She's borderline.

140
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,032
Another hour, she'd be
well into the change.

141
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:42,872
Dr Karen Jenson,

142
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:45,082
listen close.

143
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,412
I'm going to inject you
with Allium sativum-

144
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:49,412
garlic.

145
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,752
This is going
to hurt-a lot.

146
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,962
It was Quinn.

147
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,422
Frost's little
errand boy?

148
00:18:56,922 --> 00:18:58,552
You get
a lead on him?

149
00:18:59,012 --> 00:18:59,592
No.

150
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:02,722
Too bad.

151
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:04,972
Uhh!

152
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,432
Hold her.

153
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:19,332
I give her fifty-fifty

154
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:23,292
if she makes it
through the night.

155
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:49,942
Blade...

156
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,032
the daywalker-

157
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,492
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

158
00:19:58,452 --> 00:19:59,917
How many died?

159
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:03,002
We don't have
an exact count.

160
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:05,252
Apparently, he used
a lot of silver.

161
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:06,962
We're having
difficulty-

162
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:08,802
Send in Frost.

163
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:18,692
Deacon Frost.

164
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:25,202
You can come in now.

165
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:00,022
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

166
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:02,032
Are they?

167
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:04,992
They draw needless
attention to our kind.

168
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:06,242
You know our policy.

169
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,362
Your policy,
not mine.

170
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,532
Our livelihood...

171
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:15,912
depends on our ability
to blend in

172
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,382
and our discretion.

173
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:22,182
Maybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.

174
00:21:22,642 --> 00:21:24,022
We should be ruling
the humans,

175
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:25,142
not running around

176
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:26,932
making back-alley treaties
with them.

177
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,442
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food,

178
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:30,482
not our allies.

179
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,022
You're out of line, Frost.

180
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:33,862
Am I?

181
00:21:34,282 --> 00:21:35,742
Or maybe I'm just
the first to say out loud

182
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:37,282
what we've
all been thinking.

183
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:39,202
We have existed this way

184
00:21:39,662 --> 00:21:41,992
for thousands of years.

185
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:43,032
Who are you

186
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:46,912
to challenge our ways?

187
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,542
You're not even
a pureblood.

188
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,252
Like it matters.

189
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:58,932
I was born a vampire,

190
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:02,552
as was every other member
of this house,

191
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,352
but you, Frost...

192
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:10,442
you were merely turned.

193
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,152
The world belongs to us,

194
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:16,532
not the humans.

195
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:18,322
You know that.

196
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:25,422
Do we have any other
business to discuss?

197
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:27,962
Well, uh...

198
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:30,052
there's the matter of
our offshore accounts.

199
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:31,222
We're having
difficulty-

200
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:32,552
And have you made
the transfer to the-

201
00:22:32,972 --> 00:22:34,012
Gitano...

202
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:38,182
you may wake up one day
and find yourself extinct.

203
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:12,512
You're a week early.

204
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:14,392
Yeah.

205
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:24,402
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

206
00:23:27,662 --> 00:23:30,202
Yeah, I figured
that might happen.

207
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:41,842
You take care, all right?

208
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:28,042
I must be getting
soft in my old age,

209
00:25:28,582 --> 00:25:31,462
letting you bring home
a stray like that.

210
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:34,102
It was damn stupid of you.

211
00:25:34,562 --> 00:25:36,522
Might've lucked out,
though.

212
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:40,352
I checked her background.

213
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:45,982
It turns out
she's a haematologist.

214
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:50,032
She might be useful to us.

215
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:51,912
I doubt it.

216
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:54,992
I'm serious.

217
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:56,952
I took a look
at that notebook of hers.

218
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:59,582
She's onto something.

219
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:03,752
I had to increase
the dose.

220
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:06,922
It's over
50 milligrams now.

221
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:08,382
That's getting
dangerous.

222
00:26:08,882 --> 00:26:09,922
Just do it,

223
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:12,142
old man.

224
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:15,012
Ahh.

225
00:26:25,272 --> 00:26:26,482
Uhh...

226
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:14,752
Wander off
the beaten path, Doctor?

227
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,092
Who are you people?

228
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:19,592
My name's
Abraham Whistler.

229
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:22,722
You've met Blade.

230
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,412
So, am I
a prisoner here?

231
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,042
Not at all.

232
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:45,672
We just had to take
certain precautions

233
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,132
before we let you go.

234
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:50,092
You got to understand,

235
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:51,502
they're everywhere.

236
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,762
Vampires-

237
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:55,682
the Hominus nocturna.

238
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,262
We hunt them, you see-

239
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,352
moving from one city
to the next

240
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,062
tracking
their migrations.

241
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,642
They're hard to kill.

242
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:05,522
They tend to regenerate.

243
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:07,062
And I'm supposed
to believe all this?

244
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:10,522
Well, you already met
Mr. Crispy at the hospital.

245
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,362
What do you think?

246
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,952
So, what do you use, then?

247
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:18,032
Stakes? Crosses?

248
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,032
Crosses don't do squat.

249
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,162
Some of the legends
are true, though.

250
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:26,372
Vampires are severely
allergic to silver.

251
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:28,422
Feed them garlic,

252
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:30,002
and they go into
anaphylactic shock.

253
00:28:30,462 --> 00:28:31,962
Then, of course,
there's always sunlight,

254
00:28:32,422 --> 00:28:33,882
ultraviolet rays.

255
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:37,012
I got this sucker
running.

256
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:39,552
You want to give it
a try tonight?

257
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:46,742
It's still heavy.

258
00:28:48,322 --> 00:28:49,532
Well, you're so big.

259
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:53,202
If you want to live
to see another day,

260
00:28:53,622 --> 00:28:55,122
you'll be out of town
by nightfall.

261
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:57,582
So where am I
supposed to go?

262
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:03,542
You've been exposed to them.

263
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:07,342
One way or another, somebody's
going to take you out.

264
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:14,722
There's a war going on
out there.

265
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:17,602
Blade, myself,
a few others,

266
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:19,062
we've tried to keep it
from spilling over

267
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:20,142
onto the streets.

268
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:22,692
Sometimes,
people like yourself

269
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:25,572
get caught
in the crossfire.

270
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:28,072
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

271
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:31,032
They own the police.

272
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:32,912
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

273
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:35,082
Chances are you've
seen them yourself

274
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:36,162
and didn't know it-

275
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:38,502
on the subway
or in a bar.

276
00:29:40,672 --> 00:29:43,042
So that's it?

277
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:46,502
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

278
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:51,942
Here.

279
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:53,812
Vampire mace...

280
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:56,982
silver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

281
00:29:57,532 --> 00:29:59,742
You keep your eyes open.

282
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:02,072
Be careful.

283
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:07,582
One other thing...

284
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:11,082
buy yourself a gun.

285
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:15,132
If you start getting
sensitive to daylight...

286
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:17,342
if you find
you're thirsty

287
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:20,592
regardless of how much
you had to drink,

288
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,132
then I suggest
you take that gun

289
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:25,182
and use it on yourself.

290
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:30,432
Better that
than the alternative.

291
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,042
You have been warned
before.

292
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:31,552
These archives
are restricted

293
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:35,012
to members
of the House of Erebus.

294
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:38,762
You are wasting your time.

295
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:40,892
It's a dead language.

296
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:45,102
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

297
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:48,402
You wouldn't even
understand them.

298
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:51,482
Damn it, Frost!

299
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:53,032
I'm talking to you!

300
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:56,662
Shh.

301
00:31:57,172 --> 00:31:59,542
Keep your voice down,
Gitano.

302
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:02,802
We're in a library.

303
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:04,212
You don't need
to shout.

304
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:08,632
What are you up to,
Frost?

305
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:22,402
What are you
going to do, hmm?

306
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:27,902
What?

307
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:35,042
You bore me.

308
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,282
Hey!

309
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,542
Remember
what we told you.

310
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:14,842
You keep your eyes open.

311
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:15,922
They're everywhere.

312
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:19,722
But it's daytime!

313
00:34:19,662 --> 00:34:20,832
How you doing?

314
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:41,092
Hi there. Hey.

315
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:42,172
I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa!

316
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:44,092
Whoa. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

317
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:45,132
Police officer.

318
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:46,422
I'm sorry, OK?

319
00:35:46,922 --> 00:35:48,012
Police officer. I didn't
mean to scare you.

320
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:49,052
The front door was open.

321
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:50,222
What are you doing in here?

322
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:53,472
I'm just here
on a routine check.

323
00:35:53,972 --> 00:35:55,062
Look, I'm-
I'm Officer Krieger,

324
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:56,522
42nd precinct.

325
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,522
You're Karen Jenson,
right?

326
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:00,402
Yeah.

327
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:03,022
Your co-workers
at the hospital

328
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:06,692
said that you were
kidnapped last night.

329
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:08,202
Are you OK?

330
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:11,712
What happened to
the other doctor I was with?

331
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,252
Curtis Webb?

332
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:16,262
Um, he died.

333
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:18,342
No, look,

334
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,842
don't worry about that
right now, OK?

335
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:21,892
Why?

336
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,682
Because you're dead,
too, you bitch.

337
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:27,272
Aah!

338
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,022
Bitch!
What is it?

339
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:34,322
What is this, garlic?

340
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:37,112
Yeah. He said it would
work against vampires.

341
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:38,992
Vampires?

342
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:42,322
Who said I was
a vampire, huh?

343
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,702
Nobody.

344
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:52,882
He's a familiar-

345
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:54,962
a vampire wannabe.

346
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,172
If he's loyal enough

347
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:03,182
and he proves himself, maybe
his master will turn him.

348
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:05,562
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

349
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:07,772
Get over it.

350
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:13,482
Is all that necessary?

351
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:20,372
That's a glyph-

352
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,002
a vampire cattle brand.

353
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:24,962
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.

354
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:27,092
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker,

355
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:29,922
then they have to answer
to his owner.

356
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:33,632
Deacon Frost.

357
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:36,102
We've been tracking him
for a long time.

358
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:37,972
All right.

359
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,722
Officer Krieger,

360
00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:42,602
you going to be a good
little bloodhound, huh?

361
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:44,482
Tell us what your master's
been up to.

362
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:45,652
Oh, great,
now you're robbing him.

363
00:37:46,152 --> 00:37:47,112
You going
to rob me, too?

364
00:37:47,652 --> 00:37:50,322
How do you think that we
fund this organization, huh?

365
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:54,242
We're not exactly
the March of Dimes.

366
00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:57,492
It's fake.

367
00:38:00,502 --> 00:38:00,582
Well...

368
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:04,712
Looks like our friend here
has been blood running, huh?

369
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,292
Hillbarn Clinic.

370
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:07,842
I know this place.
It's a blood bank.

371
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,132
Owned by vampires,

372
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:10,592
and there's one
in every city.

373
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,132
And they always deliver.

374
00:38:12,552 --> 00:38:13,972
So, where were you
taking it?

375
00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:15,642
I don't know what
you're talking-aah!

376
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:16,682
Ooh!

377
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:18,942
Look, take it easy.

378
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,192
I'm only going to ask you
one more time.

379
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,862
Where were you taking it?

380
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,702
Go fuck yourself.

381
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:27,572
Fuck me?
No, you fuck this.

382
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:46,842
You better wake up.

383
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:50,102
The world you live in is
just a sugarcoated topping.

384
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:52,642
There is another world
beneath it-

385
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:53,812
the real world.

386
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:55,102
And if you want
to survive it,

387
00:38:55,642 --> 00:38:58,482
you better learn
to pull the trigger.

388
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,192
Wait a minute.

389
00:39:03,652 --> 00:39:04,242
I'm coming with you.

390
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:05,742
You're useless.

391
00:39:09,372 --> 00:39:11,662
I have to stick with you.

392
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:13,912
It's the only way that
I'll stay alive long enough

393
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:16,002
to find a cure for myself.

394
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:18,542
There is no cure.

395
00:39:27,142 --> 00:39:29,812
He's not going
to come back.

396
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:32,572
Nobody's that stupid.

397
00:39:33,072 --> 00:39:35,862
When you understand
the nature of a thing,

398
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:38,032
you know what
it's capable of.

399
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:56,632
It's Krieger.

400
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:58,092
I'm at 16-0-0-9.

401
00:39:58,512 --> 00:39:59,222
Yes?

402
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:00,762
Get me through.

403
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,682
I got a delivery
in progress here,

404
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:08,352
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

405
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:17,492
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillbarn now!

406
00:40:38,222 --> 00:40:40,432
Looks like
we hit pay dirt.

407
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:42,402
That's a vampire mark.

408
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:43,602
It means that
there's a safe house

409
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:45,272
around here somewhere-

410
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,282
a place they can go
with donors coming.

411
00:40:48,732 --> 00:40:50,612
See the valets
over there?

412
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:52,202
They're vampires.

413
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,702
So is the doorman

414
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:57,742
and the whore
on the corner.

415
00:40:58,202 --> 00:40:59,452
How can you tell?

416
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:00,792
By the way they move...

417
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:03,122
the way they smell.

418
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:04,582
Psst.

419
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:09,302
It's like a bad dream.

420
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:11,762
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

421
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,052
Like what?

422
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,892
Like me.

423
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:18,392
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.

424
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,102
Crosses and holy water
don't do dick,

425
00:41:20,602 --> 00:41:22,102
so forget what you've seen
in the movies.

426
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:24,482
You use a stake, silver,
or sunlight.

427
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:26,402
You know how to use
one of these?

428
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:27,652
Nope...

429
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,482
but I'll damn sure
learn quick.

430
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:31,122
The safety's off,
rounds already chambered-

431
00:41:31,582 --> 00:41:32,502
silver hollow point
filled with garlic.

432
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:34,172
You aim for the head
or the heart.

433
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:36,172
Anything else is your ass.

434
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:40,092
Do you have
an invitation?

435
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:12,042
What you got?

436
00:42:29,302 --> 00:42:30,602
Kenji!

437
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:45,622
Ohh!

438
00:42:46,122 --> 00:42:47,172
Where's the entrance?

439
00:42:47,672 --> 00:42:48,372
I can't tell you
that, man.

440
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,252
Uhh!

441
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:54,132
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

442
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:56,012
Where's the entrance?

443
00:42:56,512 --> 00:42:58,382
OK. OK.

444
00:42:59,432 --> 00:43:00,472
It's in the freezer.

445
00:43:10,652 --> 00:43:11,942
Come on, man!
I told you!

446
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:14,442
It's in the fridge!

447
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:23,662
OK.

448
00:43:24,162 --> 00:43:25,952
You give Frost
a message from me.

449
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:28,502
You tell him it's
open season on suckheads.

450
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,972
Some kind of archive.

451
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:20,102
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

452
00:44:20,522 --> 00:44:22,312
Isn't this just
a little high-tech?

453
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:24,692
They've got their claws
into everything-

454
00:44:25,312 --> 00:44:26,772
politics, finance,
real estate.

455
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,322
They already own
half of downtown.

456
00:44:53,602 --> 00:44:55,192
Frost throws a good party.

457
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,732
Yeah...

458
00:44:57,272 --> 00:44:58,902
but where is he?

459
00:45:12,872 --> 00:45:14,122
Come on, baby.

460
00:45:23,672 --> 00:45:26,222
Don't keep everyone
waiting.

461
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,502
Deacon,

462
00:45:46,962 --> 00:45:49,712
there's someone here
to see you.

463
00:45:52,212 --> 00:45:54,922
I got to talk to you,
Frost.

464
00:45:55,342 --> 00:45:57,092
I'm sorry.
I had to come here.

465
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:59,222
It's a mistake
going to Pearl's.

466
00:45:59,602 --> 00:46:00,812
I know that.
Dumb fucking me.

467
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:03,102
I know you're
disappointed.

468
00:46:03,522 --> 00:46:04,182
Am I that
transparent?

469
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:05,232
You want
to meet him?

470
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:06,272
Yeah.

471
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:07,522
I can get you guys
in with him,

472
00:46:07,942 --> 00:46:09,232
because we're tight.
We're like brothers.

473
00:46:09,692 --> 00:46:10,732
Fuck.

474
00:46:11,232 --> 00:46:11,982
Aw, fuck. Frost.

475
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:13,482
Hey.
Yeah.

476
00:46:14,532 --> 00:46:15,992
Deac. Deac.

477
00:46:16,452 --> 00:46:18,242
I've been telling these
bitches all about you, man.

478
00:46:18,702 --> 00:46:19,492
They've been dying
to meet you.

479
00:46:19,952 --> 00:46:20,532
They are so psyched.

480
00:46:21,032 --> 00:46:22,082
Bad ass bitches.
They-

481
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:23,452
Hi.

482
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:24,502
Deac?

483
00:46:25,002 --> 00:46:27,212
Frost, it's about Blade.

484
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:28,622
Aw, he's busy, you know?

485
00:46:29,082 --> 00:46:30,462
Because, like, when
he's focused on business...

486
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:33,422
Look, Frost,
this is important.

487
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:35,422
Blade was waiting for me,

488
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:37,842
using the girl as bait.

489
00:46:38,342 --> 00:46:39,802
And you were stupid
enough to take it.

490
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:41,012
Shut up, bitch.

491
00:46:41,392 --> 00:46:42,432
I didn't know he was
going to be there.

492
00:46:42,972 --> 00:46:43,972
It was a trap, see?

493
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:45,272
But don't worry
about it.

494
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:47,352
It's no problem. We can
still get the girl.

495
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:50,242
Yeah!

496
00:46:56,872 --> 00:46:58,082
Whoo!

497
00:47:19,062 --> 00:47:20,102
Forget the girl.

498
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:21,522
I want Blade.

499
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,442
I know you do.

500
00:47:23,902 --> 00:47:24,482
You hear me, Quinn?

501
00:47:24,902 --> 00:47:26,822
I want him alive.

502
00:47:27,282 --> 00:47:28,282
What?

503
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:31,992
Wait a minute, man.

504
00:47:32,412 --> 00:47:34,242
You want him alive?

505
00:47:37,252 --> 00:47:38,792
What's that smell?

506
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:43,582
...image carefully, Frost.

507
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:49,052
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

508
00:47:49,552 --> 00:47:51,092
Krieger, is that you?

509
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:52,302
He-he's here!

510
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:53,342
He's here!

511
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:55,152
This must be Pearl,

512
00:47:55,612 --> 00:47:56,192
the record keeper.

513
00:47:58,482 --> 00:48:00,242
He's going to kill me!

514
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:02,702
You need me, Frost!
You need me!

515
00:48:03,242 --> 00:48:04,452
Pearl, you're history.

516
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:06,952
Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin' dignity.

517
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:08,742
Frost.

518
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:10,752
Ruthless bloodsucker.

519
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:12,002
Congratulations, Blade.

520
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:13,622
Frost.

521
00:48:14,002 --> 00:48:15,172
I hear you've
been lookin' for me.

522
00:48:15,712 --> 00:48:16,252
I'm flattered.

523
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:18,132
It'll pass.

524
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:21,172
Fuck.

525
00:48:24,142 --> 00:48:24,802
What is that?

526
00:48:25,262 --> 00:48:27,352
That, biscuit boy,
is a U.V. Lamp.

527
00:48:27,852 --> 00:48:28,432
We're gonna play

528
00:48:28,932 --> 00:48:30,272
a little game
of 20 questions.

529
00:48:30,682 --> 00:48:31,932
Depending on
how you answer,

530
00:48:32,482 --> 00:48:34,982
you may walk out
of here with a tan.

531
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:36,312
What's that?

532
00:48:36,772 --> 00:48:38,152
Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.

533
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:40,112
It's routine research.
Heh heh.

534
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:42,242
Actually,
it's a video game.

535
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:54,752
That must've hurt.

536
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:56,792
It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

537
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:58,142
What prophecy?

538
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,102
Oh, I'm not really sure.

539
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,232
There are so many out-

540
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:19,912
And there is nothing you
can do about it, daywalker!

541
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:21,832
Is that so?

542
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,962
Well, that's
what Frost says.

543
00:49:25,412 --> 00:49:26,672
Then you won't mind me

544
00:49:27,082 --> 00:49:29,592
borrowing this
for a while, will you?

545
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:31,552
If he moves, fry him.

546
00:49:34,922 --> 00:49:35,472
What's in here?

547
00:49:36,012 --> 00:49:36,762
Nothing.
It's a-a storeroom.

548
00:49:37,262 --> 00:49:38,302
But you're
wasting your time.

549
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:40,392
There's nothing
of importance to anyone.

550
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,392
Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.

551
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:43,932
No!

552
00:50:06,592 --> 00:50:07,932
He moved.

553
00:50:38,712 --> 00:50:40,922
What is this?

554
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,422
These are the pages

555
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:45,802
from The Book
of Erebus,

556
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:47,592
the Vampire Bible.

557
00:50:49,882 --> 00:50:52,602
It contains everything...

558
00:50:53,142 --> 00:50:54,512
their entire history.

559
00:50:55,772 --> 00:50:59,352
La Magra must be
one of their legends.

560
00:51:00,942 --> 00:51:04,112
Why is Frost
so interested in La Magra?

561
00:51:04,652 --> 00:51:05,832
Shh!

562
00:51:43,162 --> 00:51:44,622
Give me your hand.

563
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:50,452
Do you remember me?

564
00:52:08,602 --> 00:52:10,112
Give it to him!

565
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:26,962
Hey! Hey!

566
00:52:27,382 --> 00:52:29,132
Nice one.

567
00:52:29,552 --> 00:52:30,132
Heh.

568
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:31,262
Well, well, well.

569
00:52:31,712 --> 00:52:33,512
You took my arm, man.

570
00:52:34,012 --> 00:52:35,512
Remember?

571
00:52:35,972 --> 00:52:37,392
But it's cool.

572
00:52:37,802 --> 00:52:39,852
I got a new one.

573
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:43,232
Think I'll ever
play piano again?

574
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:46,902
You can slice him,
you can dice him,

575
00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:48,982
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!

576
00:52:49,442 --> 00:52:50,152
Check it out.

577
00:52:50,612 --> 00:52:52,402
I've got his pigsticker.

578
00:52:52,862 --> 00:52:54,202
Ah ha ha ha-

579
00:52:54,652 --> 00:52:55,362
Ohh! Aah!

580
00:52:55,862 --> 00:52:58,282
You're a fuck up, Crease!
Ha ha ha ha!

581
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:00,662
You're a fuck up!

582
00:53:01,082 --> 00:53:02,292
"I got his pigsticker!"

583
00:53:02,752 --> 00:53:03,502
Ohh.

584
00:53:03,962 --> 00:53:05,962
You're just
full of surprises,

585
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:07,792
isn't you, chief?

586
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:18,062
Stay with me, sweetness...

587
00:53:18,442 --> 00:53:21,362
'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.

588
00:53:23,612 --> 00:53:25,442
Ah, looky here.

589
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:28,992
Silver.

590
00:53:29,492 --> 00:53:30,662
Nice craftsmanship, huh?

591
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:32,792
Probably cost you
a pretty penny.

592
00:53:33,202 --> 00:53:37,372
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

593
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:41,752
just a little too seriously,
don't you think?

594
00:53:46,052 --> 00:53:48,342
Come to think of it, Blade,

595
00:53:48,762 --> 00:53:50,512
I owe you one.

596
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:57,392
Actually, if you want
to get technical, Blade...

597
00:53:59,062 --> 00:54:00,442
I owe you two.

598
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:05,652
Oh, what's so funny,
bright eyes?

599
00:54:08,902 --> 00:54:10,742
I'm expecting company.

600
00:54:26,312 --> 00:54:28,182
Catch you fuckers
at a bad time?

601
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:29,892
No! No guns!

602
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:33,482
No! No! No!

603
00:54:40,242 --> 00:54:41,612
No! Fuckin' this way!

604
00:54:50,712 --> 00:54:51,872
Drop the guns!

605
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:53,252
I need him!

606
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,922
He wants Blade alive! Go!

607
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:00,882
You've been
listening in the whole time?

608
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:03,302
Keeping
radio contact.

609
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:06,602
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperon?

610
00:55:14,692 --> 00:55:17,152
Christ!
I'm too old for this.

611
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:19,822
Somebody get me
a god-damn wheelchair.

612
00:55:28,382 --> 00:55:29,462
Whistler!

613
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:31,592
He can take care
of himself.

614
00:55:32,012 --> 00:55:33,012
Jump!

615
00:55:53,902 --> 00:55:55,952
Aah!

616
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:10,252
Aah!

617
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:35,672
Aah!

618
00:56:42,092 --> 00:56:43,882
Aah!

619
00:56:53,982 --> 00:56:55,692
What are you
gonna do?

620
00:56:56,772 --> 00:56:58,192
Oh, my God.

621
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:14,332
What's wrong?

622
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:18,622
It's dislocated.

623
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:20,382
Ah!

624
00:57:20,842 --> 00:57:22,212
Let me help you.

625
00:57:25,262 --> 00:57:26,762
Aah!

626
00:57:33,862 --> 00:57:34,782
Let me give you-

627
00:57:35,282 --> 00:57:36,992
No! Get away.

628
00:57:52,712 --> 00:57:54,802
You're one of them,
aren't you?

629
00:57:57,672 --> 00:57:58,972
No.

630
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:00,762
I'm something else.

631
00:58:08,602 --> 00:58:10,982
I found him
when he was 13.

632
00:58:11,442 --> 00:58:12,942
He'd been livin'
on the streets,

633
00:58:13,442 --> 00:58:14,982
feedin' off
the homeless.

634
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:17,902
His need for blood had
taken over at puberty.

635
00:58:18,442 --> 00:58:21,992
I took him
for a vampire at first.

636
00:58:22,492 --> 00:58:23,822
Almost killed him, too.

637
00:58:24,282 --> 00:58:26,912
Then I realized
what he was.

638
00:58:27,332 --> 00:58:30,082
Blade's mother was
attacked by a vampire

639
00:58:30,582 --> 00:58:31,922
while she was pregnant.

640
00:58:32,382 --> 00:58:34,892
She died, but he lived.

641
00:58:35,352 --> 00:58:36,142
Unfortunately,

642
00:58:36,562 --> 00:58:38,722
he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

643
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,692
He can withstand
garlic, silver,

644
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,272
even sunlight,

645
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:46,272
and he's got
their strength.

646
00:58:47,362 --> 00:58:48,152
This time tomorrow,

647
00:58:48,652 --> 00:58:51,402
all those wounds of his
will be healed.

648
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,452
He still ages
like a human, though.

649
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:58,082
See, vampires
age slower than us.

650
00:58:58,492 --> 00:59:00,622
Unfortunately...

651
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,042
he also inherited
their thirst.

652
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,052
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

653
00:59:08,502 --> 00:59:10,762
Time's runnin' out.

654
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:15,262
His body's
startin' to reject it.

655
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:19,812
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

656
00:59:24,442 --> 00:59:26,272
Why do you hunt them?

657
00:59:28,442 --> 00:59:30,532
I had a family once-

658
00:59:30,992 --> 00:59:33,282
wife and two daughters.

659
00:59:35,702 --> 00:59:38,002
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

660
00:59:38,502 --> 00:59:39,502
a vampire.

661
00:59:41,632 --> 00:59:43,012
He toyed with 'em first,

662
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:45,892
tried to make me decide

663
00:59:46,302 --> 00:59:48,012
which order
they'd die in.

664
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:54,732
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

665
00:59:55,232 --> 00:59:56,352
but it's gettin' worse.

666
00:59:56,812 --> 00:59:57,982
Because of Frost.

667
00:59:58,482 --> 00:59:59,072
There's somethin'
happenin'

668
00:59:59,107 --> 01:00:02,992
It's somethin' big...

669
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:04,822
and I'd stake my life

670
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:08,822
that son of a bitch
is at the center of it.

671
01:00:12,582 --> 01:00:13,582
Blade.

672
01:00:31,472 --> 01:00:33,312
Whistler told me
what happened.

673
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:39,862
He told me
what you are.

674
01:00:42,662 --> 01:00:44,452
You don't know me.

675
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:46,832
You don't know
anything about me.

676
01:00:50,172 --> 01:00:52,132
I'm not human.

677
01:00:54,842 --> 01:00:56,092
You look human
to me-

678
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:59,092
Humans don't
drink blood.

679
01:00:59,512 --> 01:01:00,642
That was
a long time ago.

680
01:01:01,142 --> 01:01:05,102
Maybe you should
let that go.

681
01:01:07,982 --> 01:01:09,522
I have spent
my whole life

682
01:01:09,942 --> 01:01:13,232
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

683
01:01:13,692 --> 01:01:15,692
It made me what I am.

684
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:22,122
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

685
01:01:22,622 --> 01:01:25,082
I get a little piece
of that life back,

686
01:01:25,492 --> 01:01:29,002
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

687
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:33,962
...my fault he took us
by surprise!

688
01:01:34,502 --> 01:01:36,262
Two of them against your
entire security force?

689
01:01:36,762 --> 01:01:38,762
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!

690
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,592
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate-

691
01:01:41,012 --> 01:01:42,302
...stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!

692
01:01:42,852 --> 01:01:43,682
Aah! You little skeez!

693
01:01:44,142 --> 01:01:45,402
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

694
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,692
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

695
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:49,362
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

696
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:51,662
You got
what you deserved.

697
01:01:54,662 --> 01:01:57,042
Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

698
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:58,872
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

699
01:01:59,372 --> 01:02:00,212
He took my hand again!

700
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:02,502
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

701
01:02:02,922 --> 01:02:04,502
What the fuck
are you talk-

702
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:06,092
you want him alive?

703
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:08,632
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

704
01:02:09,132 --> 01:02:11,222
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind? Shh.

705
01:02:11,722 --> 01:02:13,147
Big guy, relax.

707
01:02:15,722 --> 01:02:16,972
Be patient.

708
01:02:18,642 --> 01:02:20,772
Now, we got a lot
to do here.

709
01:02:21,272 --> 01:02:22,192
I need you, man.

710
01:02:22,692 --> 01:02:23,902
Heh.

711
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:25,442
Heh.

712
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:27,192
I need you.

713
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:28,692
Yeah.

714
01:03:11,952 --> 01:03:13,582
Morning.

715
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:15,582
How you feelin'?

716
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:26,012
Look at that.

717
01:03:30,262 --> 01:03:32,482
Whew. Gettin' a little
toasty out here, huh?

718
01:03:32,932 --> 01:03:33,522
Heh heh.

719
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,152
When was the last time

720
01:03:36,602 --> 01:03:38,942
you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

721
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,322
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

722
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,942
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

723
01:03:44,402 --> 01:03:44,952
That's OK.

724
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:46,072
It's all right.

725
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,662
Least we're here together.

726
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:49,032
Share the moment,

727
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,212
which means a lotto me,
by the way, really.

728
01:03:52,672 --> 01:03:54,092
I mean that.

729
01:03:55,972 --> 01:03:58,512
'Cause actually, you know,
when you get to know me,

730
01:03:58,932 --> 01:04:00,997
I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

731
01:04:01,032 --> 01:04:03,062
Bit of an innocent,
you might say.

732
01:04:06,482 --> 01:04:09,022
Do what you want,
Frost.

733
01:04:09,522 --> 01:04:11,402

any difference.

734
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:15,782
You just don't
fuckin' get it.

735
01:04:17,072 --> 01:04:18,202
You're never
gonna be a pureblood.

736
01:04:18,612 --> 01:04:20,032
Hold him.

737
01:04:22,622 --> 01:04:24,702
You will never rule us.

738
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:28,212
Aah!

739
01:04:31,962 --> 01:04:33,132
Aah!

740
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:37,052
Ow.

741
01:04:37,432 --> 01:04:39,142
Jesus Christ.

742
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:40,302
Have a nice day.

743
01:04:40,762 --> 01:04:41,722
Sorry, you old dog.

744
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:44,852
You just got a little
too long in the tooth.

745
01:04:46,392 --> 01:04:48,312
What, man?
That was funny.

746
01:04:48,732 --> 01:04:49,982
"Long, tooth."
Funny.

747
01:04:50,482 --> 01:04:52,772
Did I tell you
the one about...

748
01:04:55,072 --> 01:04:56,702
Aah!

749
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:24,522
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

750
01:05:31,612 --> 01:05:33,912
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

751
01:05:34,372 --> 01:05:37,502
I need 12 volunteers.
Tkktkk.

752
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:44,502
Whistler.

753
01:05:47,882 --> 01:05:49,052
What is this?

754
01:05:50,882 --> 01:05:53,092
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

755
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:54,722
I took it
from the archives.

756
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:56,312
It's written in blood.

757
01:05:56,762 --> 01:05:59,272
It's from
The Book of Erebus.

758
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,872
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

759
01:06:06,372 --> 01:06:08,122
It's somethin'
about the Blood God,

760
01:06:08,662 --> 01:06:09,912
the spirits of the 12.

761
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:11,042
I- I don't know.

762
01:06:11,502 --> 01:06:12,832
I can't make out
the rest of it.

763
01:06:13,252 --> 01:06:14,502
Maybe this'll help.

764
01:06:15,582 --> 01:06:16,962
I'll figure out something.

765
01:06:18,552 --> 01:06:19,842
So what's all this?

766
01:06:20,302 --> 01:06:22,472
Took a trip to
the hospital last night,

767
01:06:22,972 --> 01:06:24,432
borrowed some equipment.

768
01:06:24,932 --> 01:06:27,562
For your
miracle cure?

769
01:06:29,472 --> 01:06:30,392
This is E.D.T.A.

770
01:06:30,852 --> 01:06:31,522
It's an anticoagulant.

771
01:06:31,982 --> 01:06:34,022
We use it
to treat blood clots.

772
01:06:34,522 --> 01:06:37,402
Now look what happens
when I introduce it

773
01:06:37,902 --> 01:06:40,322
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

774
01:06:41,532 --> 01:06:43,072
Take a step back.

775
01:06:43,492 --> 01:06:45,072
The reaction's
energetic.

776
01:06:54,582 --> 01:06:55,252
Some cure.

777
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:58,172
I didn't say E.D.T.A.
Was a cure.

778
01:06:58,712 --> 01:07:00,172
But maybe
you could use it

779
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:02,842
to explode
some vampire heads.

780
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:05,942
Wait a minute.

781
01:07:06,312 --> 01:07:08,112
I need a sample
of your blood.

782
01:07:08,522 --> 01:07:09,322
Later.

783
01:07:09,732 --> 01:07:11,572
Gotta go downtown.

784
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:12,822
Need some serum.

785
01:07:13,282 --> 01:07:14,242
Serum can wait.

786
01:07:14,652 --> 01:07:16,242
This is important.

787
01:07:38,432 --> 01:07:39,762
Is he sick?

788
01:07:40,262 --> 01:07:41,262
Cancer.

789
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:46,232
You have a lot of love
for him, don't you?

790
01:07:46,732 --> 01:07:48,562
We have
a good arrangement.

791
01:07:48,942 --> 01:07:51,522
He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.

792
01:07:55,612 --> 01:07:57,362
You know,
my mother used to say,

793
01:07:57,862 --> 01:08:00,122
"A cold heart
is a dead heart."

794
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:19,732
You don't look so good.

795
01:08:20,812 --> 01:08:22,152
I'm just a little tired.

796
01:08:22,572 --> 01:08:23,732
You know we've been...

797
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:25,572
workin' all night.

798
01:08:28,242 --> 01:08:30,612
I guess we didn't
catch it in time.

799
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:33,372
You got another day,

800
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:35,582
two at the most.

801
01:08:40,462 --> 01:08:42,382
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

802
01:08:42,882 --> 01:08:45,962
You make it sound
like I'm already dead.

803
01:09:04,072 --> 01:09:05,072
Blade.

804
01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:32,102
How you doin', chief?

805
01:09:33,482 --> 01:09:34,112
Easy.

806
01:09:36,152 --> 01:09:37,692
Wouldn't want
our little friend here

807
01:09:38,232 --> 01:09:41,202
to wind up on the back of
a milk carton, now would we?

808
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:45,662
Ah, it's nice
to finally meet you, man.

809
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:48,042
Had my eye on you
for years.

810
01:09:48,582 --> 01:09:49,702
I know all about you-

811
01:09:50,122 --> 01:09:52,672
your serum, Whistler-
everything.

812
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:54,922
Sunblock.

813
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:57,042
Hey, it's a start, right?

814
01:09:57,422 --> 01:10:00,052
The goal, of course,
is to be like you,

815
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:01,132
the daywalker.

816
01:10:02,592 --> 01:10:04,722
You got the best
of both worlds, don't you?

817
01:10:05,262 --> 01:10:07,432
All our strengths...

818
01:10:07,892 --> 01:10:08,812
none of our weaknesses.

819
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:11,932
Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.

820
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:14,982
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

821
01:10:15,442 --> 01:10:18,782
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

822
01:10:19,242 --> 01:10:22,042
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

823
01:10:22,462 --> 01:10:23,542
Heh. You think the humans

824
01:10:24,082 --> 01:10:25,962
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

825
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,292
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

826
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:31,092
And they should be.

827
01:10:31,592 --> 01:10:32,132
You're an animal.

828
01:10:32,632 --> 01:10:34,632
You're a fuckin'
maniac.

829
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:38,762
Look at 'em.

830
01:10:39,142 --> 01:10:41,062
They're cattle,

831
01:10:41,472 --> 01:10:43,022
pieces of meat.

832
01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:46,102
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

833
01:10:46,522 --> 01:10:47,152
Plague...

834
01:10:47,562 --> 01:10:48,612
war...

835
01:10:49,152 --> 01:10:50,272
famine.

836
01:10:50,732 --> 01:10:52,692
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

837
01:10:53,192 --> 01:10:55,742
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

838
01:10:56,242 --> 01:10:58,202
the new race.

839
01:10:59,832 --> 01:11:02,412
Looks like
your mascara's running.

840
01:11:09,592 --> 01:11:11,502
I'm offering you a truce.

841
01:11:11,962 --> 01:11:13,212
I want you with us.

842
01:11:13,592 --> 01:11:15,552
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

843
01:11:24,112 --> 01:11:25,652
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

844
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:28,492
Frost...

845
01:11:28,912 --> 01:11:31,122
you're nothing
to me...

846
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:34,122
but another
dead vampire.

847
01:11:34,622 --> 01:11:36,162
You're an idiot.
You know that?

848
01:11:36,622 --> 01:11:39,252
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

849
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,712
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

850
01:11:43,172 --> 01:11:44,382
Careful.

851
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:51,222
What do I care?

852
01:11:51,722 --> 01:11:53,642
They're nothing
but cattle...

853
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:55,472
just like you said.

854
01:11:55,982 --> 01:11:58,442
If you want to take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

855
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:00,482
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

856
01:12:01,022 --> 01:12:04,902
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's-

857
01:12:14,492 --> 01:12:15,792
aah!

858
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,032
Go home.

859
01:12:44,492 --> 01:12:45,202
It was simple.

860
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:47,622
Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

861
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:50,082
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

862
01:12:50,502 --> 01:12:51,922
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

863
01:12:52,422 --> 01:12:53,132
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

864
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:55,672
That means that
we have to treat it

865
01:12:56,132 --> 01:12:56,962
with gene therapy,

866
01:12:57,512 --> 01:12:59,512
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

867
01:12:59,762 --> 01:13:00,932
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

868
01:13:02,472 --> 01:13:03,552
Are you sure
that's safe?

869
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:05,052
I have no idea,

870
01:13:05,512 --> 01:13:07,932
but I don't have
a choice, do I?

871
01:13:09,562 --> 01:13:11,442
You actually think
this could work?

872
01:13:11,942 --> 01:13:13,442
On me...

873
01:13:13,902 --> 01:13:15,192
yes.

874
01:13:15,652 --> 01:13:17,732
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

875
01:13:18,322 --> 01:13:19,532
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

876
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:21,402
from a bite
like I did.

877
01:13:21,822 --> 01:13:22,992
He was born with it.

878
01:13:23,452 --> 01:13:25,162
It's-it's part
of his DNA.

879
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:28,092
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

880
01:13:28,592 --> 01:13:29,802
but it's gonna
take time.

881
01:13:30,262 --> 01:13:32,222
Ah, we're out of time.

882
01:13:32,722 --> 01:13:35,012
You saw what was
on that disc.

883
01:13:39,772 --> 01:13:41,182
Damn.

884
01:13:43,272 --> 01:13:44,352
Get out of here.

885
01:14:09,252 --> 01:14:11,462
I said get out of here!

886
01:14:17,092 --> 01:14:18,102
Nice place.

887
01:14:18,682 --> 01:14:20,892
Took us a while
to find it!

888
01:14:28,112 --> 01:14:29,692
Bite me
and get it over with.

889
01:14:30,152 --> 01:14:31,952
I ain't gonna bite you.

890
01:14:45,302 --> 01:14:46,302
Do your thing.

891
01:14:58,772 --> 01:14:59,982
Whistler.

892
01:16:07,732 --> 01:16:10,062
Frost took her.

893
01:16:17,902 --> 01:16:19,282
Listen to me.

894
01:16:22,362 --> 01:16:23,452
The disc.

895
01:16:24,912 --> 01:16:26,042
He decoded it.

896
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:29,162
Frost is trying to...

897
01:16:29,662 --> 01:16:33,042
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

898
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:37,212
There's some kind of...

899
01:16:37,672 --> 01:16:40,852
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

900
01:16:42,482 --> 01:16:44,062
La Magra.

901
01:16:47,442 --> 01:16:49,152
You're the key.

902
01:16:50,612 --> 01:16:52,322
He needs
your blood.

903
01:16:56,242 --> 01:16:58,332
The blood
of the daywalker.

904
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:03,542
You're the chosen one.

905
01:17:07,132 --> 01:17:08,422
Listen to me, Blade.

906
01:17:09,962 --> 01:17:11,472
You can't
go after him.

907
01:17:11,922 --> 01:17:13,222
Bullshit.

908
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,512
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

909
01:17:16,012 --> 01:17:18,432
it's all over.

910
01:17:21,352 --> 01:17:24,062
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

911
01:17:26,862 --> 01:17:27,822
Shit.

912
01:17:32,112 --> 01:17:34,202
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

913
01:17:34,662 --> 01:17:37,992
Don't want me
coming back.

914
01:17:39,912 --> 01:17:41,702
We can treat
the wounds.

915
01:17:43,512 --> 01:17:44,802
It's too far gone.

916
01:17:45,262 --> 01:17:47,512
You know that.

917
01:17:50,812 --> 01:17:53,482
Give me your gun.

918
01:17:54,812 --> 01:17:56,442
No.

919
01:17:57,692 --> 01:18:00,322
Give me
the god-damn gun.

920
01:18:25,342 --> 01:18:26,342
Now walk away,

921
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:29,092
you stupid
son of a bitch.

922
01:18:33,932 --> 01:18:36,312
Walk the fuck away.

923
01:18:57,222 --> 01:18:58,132
By the time you watch this,

924
01:18:58,682 --> 01:18:59,842
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

925
01:19:00,342 --> 01:19:00,802
If it makes any
difference to you,

926
01:19:01,352 --> 01:19:03,562
he put up
quite a fight.

927
01:19:04,012 --> 01:19:06,682
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

928
01:20:44,922 --> 01:20:45,922
You seem a bit...

929
01:20:46,382 --> 01:20:47,042
tense.

930
01:20:47,502 --> 01:20:49,092
A bit pent-up maybe,

931
01:20:49,592 --> 01:20:51,052
like you need to
release something.

932
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:52,882
You know?

933
01:20:53,262 --> 01:20:54,342
Blade not...

934
01:20:55,652 --> 01:20:57,862
givin' it to you
maybe.

935
01:20:59,072 --> 01:20:59,942
I don't know.
I just...

936
01:21:00,532 --> 01:21:03,492
I see such
a beautiful woman.

937
01:21:05,202 --> 01:21:06,452
Great skin.

938
01:21:09,202 --> 01:21:11,002
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

939
01:21:11,412 --> 01:21:14,622
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

940
01:21:16,132 --> 01:21:18,252
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

941
01:21:18,632 --> 01:21:20,002
Go ahead.

942
01:21:20,462 --> 01:21:21,512
Bite me.

943
01:21:22,012 --> 01:21:24,552
I'll just cure myself.

944
01:21:25,132 --> 01:21:26,052
I did it before,

945
01:21:26,552 --> 01:21:27,762
and I can do it again.

946
01:21:28,262 --> 01:21:29,642
There is no cure,
baby.

947
01:21:30,102 --> 01:21:31,272
There is if you've
been bit,

948
01:21:31,722 --> 01:21:34,982
if you were once human.

949
01:21:40,402 --> 01:21:41,402
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

950
01:21:41,822 --> 01:21:42,862
A born vampire

951
01:21:43,282 --> 01:21:45,652
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

952
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:48,912
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

953
01:21:49,412 --> 01:21:50,332
Isn't that right?

954
01:21:50,782 --> 01:21:53,792
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

955
01:21:54,252 --> 01:21:56,962
You're just... infected,
a virus...

956
01:21:57,462 --> 01:21:59,142
a sexually transmitted
disease.

957
01:21:59,602 --> 01:22:00,682
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

958
01:22:01,102 --> 01:22:03,222
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

959
01:22:03,722 --> 01:22:05,352
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

960
01:22:05,852 --> 01:22:07,272
you people
are fuckin' history.

961
01:22:08,982 --> 01:22:10,062
He's a hurricane,

962
01:22:10,522 --> 01:22:12,232
an act of God.

963
01:22:12,612 --> 01:22:14,032
Anyone caught
in his path

964
01:22:14,492 --> 01:22:15,572
will instantly
be turned.

965
01:22:17,492 --> 01:22:18,822
Everyone you've
ever known,

966
01:22:19,322 --> 01:22:22,032
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

967
01:22:22,542 --> 01:22:23,992
It won't matter
who's pureblood

968
01:22:24,582 --> 01:22:25,752
and who's not.

969
01:22:26,162 --> 01:22:28,792
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

970
01:22:30,502 --> 01:22:32,042
Hmm?

971
01:22:35,592 --> 01:22:37,592
And Blade's blood
is the key.

972
01:22:38,132 --> 01:22:39,722
We got an intruder.

973
01:23:08,842 --> 01:23:09,762
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

974
01:23:10,182 --> 01:23:11,092
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

975
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:13,222
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him-

976
01:23:13,682 --> 01:23:15,062
and he's got shit
he throws at you-

977
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:16,722
Yeah, the swords.

978
01:23:17,182 --> 01:23:18,102
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

979
01:23:18,482 --> 01:23:19,812
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

980
01:23:20,272 --> 01:23:21,272
There's no
intruder where we are.

981
01:23:21,732 --> 01:23:23,152
Look, make it happen,
all right?

982
01:23:23,562 --> 01:23:24,732
It's one guy on foot.

983
01:23:29,402 --> 01:23:30,992
That's him!
Get him!

984
01:23:50,512 --> 01:23:52,132
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

985
01:23:52,472 --> 01:23:54,892
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

986
01:23:55,352 --> 01:23:56,392
I need him alive.

987
01:23:56,722 --> 01:23:57,892
No!

988
01:24:00,522 --> 01:24:02,482
Please!

989
01:24:02,942 --> 01:24:04,062
I just work for them!

990
01:24:06,412 --> 01:24:07,912
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

991
01:24:08,372 --> 01:24:09,372
Yes, sir!

992
01:24:46,202 --> 01:24:48,372
Aah!

993
01:24:48,832 --> 01:24:50,952
Aieee!
Aah!

994
01:25:56,702 --> 01:25:58,362
Eric?

995
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:11,132
But you died.

996
01:26:12,502 --> 01:26:14,562
I came back, Eric.

997
01:26:15,022 --> 01:26:16,352
That very same night...

998
01:26:18,192 --> 01:26:20,602
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

999
01:26:28,702 --> 01:26:30,492
Uhh!

1000
01:26:37,622 --> 01:26:40,172
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

1001
01:26:40,622 --> 01:26:41,672
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

1002
01:26:42,132 --> 01:26:43,422
and you act like this?

1003
01:26:45,212 --> 01:26:47,132
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

1004
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,302
She belongs to me,
buddy.

1005
01:26:49,682 --> 01:26:50,762
Uh! Uhh!

1006
01:26:52,682 --> 01:26:53,802
Don't look so surprised.

1007
01:26:54,262 --> 01:26:55,512
You spent your whole life

1008
01:26:56,102 --> 01:26:58,482
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

1009
01:26:58,932 --> 01:27:00,852
Well, here I am.

1010
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:04,062
Who would ever guess

1011
01:27:04,522 --> 01:27:06,612
you'd survive
your mother's death?

1012
01:27:07,112 --> 01:27:08,032
But you did.

1013
01:27:08,442 --> 01:27:09,652
And here we are-

1014
01:27:10,112 --> 01:27:12,492
one big happy
fuckin' family.

1015
01:27:23,932 --> 01:27:25,602
I need my serum.

1016
01:27:28,352 --> 01:27:29,272
Maybe when we
get outta this,

1017
01:27:29,682 --> 01:27:31,522
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

1018
01:27:31,982 --> 01:27:33,562
There's one catch.

1019
01:27:37,522 --> 01:27:39,072
If it works,

1020
01:27:39,532 --> 01:27:40,442
you'll lose
your strength

1021
01:27:40,902 --> 01:27:44,912
and your ability
to regenerate.

1022
01:27:45,372 --> 01:27:47,332
You'll be
completely human.

1023
01:28:08,562 --> 01:28:09,562
Uhh!

1024
01:28:49,272 --> 01:28:51,612
Blade, Karen,

1025
01:28:52,032 --> 01:28:53,612
glad you could make it.

1026
01:28:54,072 --> 01:28:56,362
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

1027
01:28:57,702 --> 01:28:59,782
Our ancestors
called this place

1028
01:29:00,202 --> 01:29:02,452
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1029
01:29:05,582 --> 01:29:07,122
Nice, isn't it?

1030
01:29:07,502 --> 01:29:10,002
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1031
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:12,842
Fortunately for us...

1032
01:29:13,342 --> 01:29:14,342
I'm what you
might call a...

1033
01:29:14,762 --> 01:29:17,302
student of history.

1034
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:32,702
Why are we here?

1035
01:29:34,292 --> 01:29:38,332
This temple was built
for one glorious moment-

1036
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:42,132
this night,
for the Blood God.

1037
01:29:50,392 --> 01:29:51,642
Thanks.

1038
01:29:56,982 --> 01:29:58,522
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1039
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:03,192
Well.

1040
01:30:03,612 --> 01:30:04,322
Titanium, right?

1041
01:30:04,822 --> 01:30:06,742
Acid-etched?

1042
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:11,282
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1043
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:17,662
What?

1044
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:20,582
You look surprised.

1045
01:30:21,132 --> 01:30:22,332
I told you, Blade,

1046
01:30:22,632 --> 01:30:24,632
I know everything
about you.

1047
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:26,842
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1048
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:28,092
Why, man?

1049
01:30:28,472 --> 01:30:29,172
These are-they're,
like, all better.

1050
01:30:29,602 --> 01:30:30,522
Hold out your arm.

1051
01:30:30,982 --> 01:30:31,982
Now.

1052
01:30:36,032 --> 01:30:37,072
Deac, I-

1053
01:30:42,322 --> 01:30:43,322
Just kidding.

1054
01:30:45,532 --> 01:30:47,202
Ha ha ha ha! He was fuckin' with me.

1055
01:30:47,622 --> 01:30:48,912
He was, like,
fuckin'...

1056
01:30:49,462 --> 01:30:50,002
Blade.

1057
01:30:50,502 --> 01:30:52,422
Blade.

1058
01:30:52,882 --> 01:30:53,582
He can't hear you,
honey.

1059
01:30:53,962 --> 01:30:55,592
The thirst has
got him now.

1060
01:31:01,302 --> 01:31:03,092
What do we have here?

1061
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,972
The precious serum.

1062
01:31:06,352 --> 01:31:09,812
Mm. How long's it been
since you shot up?

1063
01:31:10,272 --> 01:31:12,652
12, 13 hours maybe?

1064
01:31:13,152 --> 01:31:14,982
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

1065
01:31:15,522 --> 01:31:16,652
aren't you?

1066
01:31:19,152 --> 01:31:20,362
What's it feel like?

1067
01:31:22,362 --> 01:31:23,912
Is your blood on fire?

1068
01:31:24,322 --> 01:31:26,332
Try some.

1069
01:31:26,832 --> 01:31:29,082
You might like it.

1070
01:31:29,502 --> 01:31:31,542
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1071
01:31:32,082 --> 01:31:33,932
In any event,

1072
01:31:34,432 --> 01:31:36,472
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1073
01:31:43,892 --> 01:31:45,312
It's a shame, you know?

1074
01:31:46,612 --> 01:31:47,902
When I think of what
you've become,

1075
01:31:48,322 --> 01:31:50,612
what you should
have become.

1076
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:52,702
I guess
I don't blame you.

1077
01:31:53,112 --> 01:31:54,452
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1078
01:31:54,992 --> 01:31:55,952
it's the human
side of you

1079
01:31:56,412 --> 01:31:57,662
that's made you weak.

1080
01:31:58,202 --> 01:31:59,372
You should've listened
to your blood.

1081
01:31:59,832 --> 01:32:00,752
Say what you want,

1082
01:32:01,202 --> 01:32:04,962
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1083
01:32:05,502 --> 01:32:06,672
Ooh.

1084
01:32:09,132 --> 01:32:11,092
Get him outta here.

1085
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:17,512
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1086
01:32:18,012 --> 01:32:19,392
Come on. Let's go.

1087
01:32:19,932 --> 01:32:21,602
Let's go.

1088
01:32:25,602 --> 01:32:26,522
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1089
01:32:27,022 --> 01:32:27,732
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1090
01:32:28,192 --> 01:32:29,112
Oh, no, baby.

1091
01:32:29,572 --> 01:32:32,532
We got something real
special planned for you.

1092
01:32:33,782 --> 01:32:35,072
That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1093
01:32:35,572 --> 01:32:36,492
I sucked him dry.

1094
01:32:36,912 --> 01:32:38,292
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1095
01:32:38,792 --> 01:32:39,672
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1096
01:32:40,172 --> 01:32:41,132
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1097
01:32:41,552 --> 01:32:43,052
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1098
01:32:45,012 --> 01:32:45,632
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1099
01:32:46,132 --> 01:32:47,092
Pathetic.

1100
01:32:47,512 --> 01:32:49,182
Yeah. These guys
are complete scums, man.

1101
01:32:49,642 --> 01:32:50,552
They'll eat anything-

1102
01:32:51,012 --> 01:32:54,682
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1103
01:32:56,062 --> 01:32:57,022
They'll even
eat vampires.

1104
01:32:57,562 --> 01:32:58,732
That's a plus.

1105
01:32:59,152 --> 01:33:00,192
And bearing that
all in mind,

1106
01:33:00,692 --> 01:33:02,522
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1107
01:33:04,282 --> 01:33:05,492
Uh!

1108
01:33:07,242 --> 01:33:08,202
Uh!

1109
01:33:08,662 --> 01:33:09,322
It's too bad.

1110
01:33:09,782 --> 01:33:12,202
I kinda liked her.

1111
01:33:12,582 --> 01:33:13,742
What a waste.

1112
01:33:35,522 --> 01:33:37,392
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1113
01:33:38,642 --> 01:33:40,102
No pulse.

1114
01:33:40,602 --> 01:33:41,452
And, of course,

1115
01:33:41,912 --> 01:33:43,702
there's the question
of lividity.

1116
01:33:45,542 --> 01:33:46,752
Curtis?

1117
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,122
Ahh.

1118
01:33:50,622 --> 01:33:52,422
Karen?

1119
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:54,632
Karen.

1120
01:33:55,962 --> 01:33:58,092
I never thought
I would see you again.

1121
01:33:58,552 --> 01:34:00,052
Tell me, Karen,

1122
01:34:00,512 --> 01:34:02,552
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1123
01:34:20,862 --> 01:34:22,202
Karen!

1124
01:34:22,612 --> 01:34:24,582
Karen!

1125
01:34:25,082 --> 01:34:26,292
Karen!

1126
01:34:27,582 --> 01:34:29,622
Karen!

1127
01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:31,372
Karen.

1128
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,832
Karen!

1129
01:35:38,832 --> 01:35:40,372
Poor child.

1130
01:35:42,202 --> 01:35:43,712
You're so sick.

1131
01:35:45,122 --> 01:35:46,882
So thirsty.

1132
01:35:47,332 --> 01:35:49,602
Don't touch me.

1133
01:35:52,142 --> 01:35:54,642
Eric, look at me.

1134
01:35:55,142 --> 01:35:57,402
Vampires are
my people now.

1135
01:35:57,902 --> 01:36:00,232
I'm one of them.

1136
01:36:00,612 --> 01:36:00,982
Can't be.

1137
01:36:03,532 --> 01:36:05,282
Yes, it can.

1138
01:36:07,662 --> 01:36:10,122
Try to understand,
Eric.

1139
01:36:11,292 --> 01:36:14,502
Your mother died
a long time ago.

1140
01:36:16,962 --> 01:36:18,292
I've hunted...

1141
01:36:20,002 --> 01:36:21,462
I've killed...

1142
01:36:23,842 --> 01:36:25,632
and I've enjoyed it.

1143
01:36:27,382 --> 01:36:28,552
Haven't you?

1144
01:36:30,302 --> 01:36:31,722
I know you have.

1145
01:36:33,972 --> 01:36:35,142
Sooner or later,

1146
01:36:35,682 --> 01:36:37,732
the thirst
always wins.

1147
01:37:22,122 --> 01:37:23,332
Come on.

1148
01:37:30,082 --> 01:37:31,252
Spread them out.

1149
01:37:32,502 --> 01:37:35,002
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1150
01:37:35,462 --> 01:37:37,212
Make it perfect.

1151
01:38:15,352 --> 01:38:16,642
Yeah.

1152
01:38:17,852 --> 01:38:19,562
Bring the elevator up.

1153
01:38:58,972 --> 01:39:01,032
You stupid girl.

1154
01:39:02,702 --> 01:39:03,242
La Magra?

1155
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:04,612
The Blood God?

1156
01:39:05,032 --> 01:39:06,242
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1157
01:39:06,742 --> 01:39:08,412
for pretty
little vampires.

1158
01:39:08,872 --> 01:39:09,702
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?

1159
01:39:10,162 --> 01:39:13,622
You're afraid we're
gonna steal your soul,

1160
01:39:14,082 --> 01:39:16,212
your pureblood spirit.

1161
01:39:16,672 --> 01:39:18,252
You should be.

1162
01:39:18,712 --> 01:39:19,962
Read the prophecy.

1163
01:39:20,422 --> 01:39:21,422
It's time you fucks

1164
01:39:21,842 --> 01:39:23,592
contributed something
to the cause.

1165
01:39:27,552 --> 01:39:28,762
Even
if Frost is right,

1166
01:39:29,182 --> 01:39:31,932
you really think
he cares about you?

1167
01:39:32,312 --> 01:39:33,142
You're gonna die,

1168
01:39:33,602 --> 01:39:34,892
just like
the rest of us.

1169
01:39:35,312 --> 01:39:36,312
Waah!

1170
01:40:00,422 --> 01:40:01,502
Blade.

1171
01:40:10,812 --> 01:40:14,072
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

1172
01:40:14,612 --> 01:40:15,782
No more compromises.

1173
01:40:16,242 --> 01:40:18,532
We're gonna be gods.

1174
01:40:20,162 --> 01:40:20,992
Of course we are.

1175
01:40:21,412 --> 01:40:24,292
Yeah!

1176
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:25,792
I'm gonna be naughty.

1177
01:40:26,212 --> 01:40:28,122
I'm gonna be a naughty
Vampire God.

1178
01:40:28,502 --> 01:40:29,502
Ha ha ha!

1179
01:40:36,672 --> 01:40:38,132
Gotta stop...

1180
01:40:39,802 --> 01:40:40,842
stop...

1181
01:40:41,262 --> 01:40:43,012
Save your strength.

1182
01:40:43,512 --> 01:40:44,472
Blue.

1183
01:40:45,852 --> 01:40:47,232
You're hypovolemic.

1184
01:40:47,692 --> 01:40:48,812
You're bleeding
to death.

1185
01:40:49,272 --> 01:40:50,852
Need...

1186
01:40:51,312 --> 01:40:52,152
serum.

1187
01:41:10,472 --> 01:41:11,472
Blade.

1188
01:41:13,302 --> 01:41:15,262
Blade.

1189
01:41:17,522 --> 01:41:18,602
Listen to me.

1190
01:41:20,312 --> 01:41:22,652
I want you to take
some of my blood.

1191
01:41:24,482 --> 01:41:25,862
No.

1192
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,362
No.

1193
01:41:30,532 --> 01:41:32,872
Look, just do it.

1194
01:41:58,562 --> 01:41:59,642
Is everybody thirsty?

1195
01:42:00,102 --> 01:42:03,562
I hope you're all
very fucking thirsty.

1196
01:42:22,222 --> 01:42:24,302
Ohh...

1197
01:42:24,802 --> 01:42:25,932
don't stop.

1198
01:42:29,102 --> 01:42:30,182
Don't stop.

1199
01:42:35,522 --> 01:42:36,562
Don't stop.

1200
01:42:51,202 --> 01:42:52,622
Don't stop.

1201
01:43:05,552 --> 01:43:07,592
Aah!

1202
01:43:44,772 --> 01:43:46,442
How was it?

1203
01:43:47,732 --> 01:43:48,812
Aah!

1204
01:43:54,652 --> 01:43:56,992
Aah!

1205
01:43:57,492 --> 01:43:58,992
Aah!

1206
01:43:59,492 --> 01:44:01,242
Aah!

1207
01:44:08,122 --> 01:44:09,962
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1208
01:44:12,632 --> 01:44:14,762
Uhh!

1209
01:44:22,112 --> 01:44:23,572
Aah!

1210
01:44:45,802 --> 01:44:47,422
Aah!

1211
01:44:51,682 --> 01:44:52,802
Aah!

1212
01:44:57,432 --> 01:44:58,812
Eric...

1213
01:44:59,892 --> 01:45:01,482
I'm your mother.

1214
01:45:03,732 --> 01:45:06,152
You wouldn't hurt
your mother...

1215
01:45:06,652 --> 01:45:07,652
would you?

1216
01:45:10,402 --> 01:45:11,452
Come here.

1217
01:45:15,952 --> 01:45:18,122
I must release you.

1218
01:45:29,102 --> 01:45:30,062
Fuck!

1219
01:45:31,642 --> 01:45:33,732
Aah!

1220
01:45:48,742 --> 01:45:49,752
Aah!

1221
01:45:56,632 --> 01:45:57,632
Aah!

1222
01:46:27,322 --> 01:46:28,132
Uhh!

1223
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,002
Unh!

1224
01:46:30,462 --> 01:46:31,462
Unh!

1225
01:46:35,132 --> 01:46:36,092
Deacon?

1226
01:46:36,512 --> 01:46:37,642
Not anymore.

1227
01:46:53,652 --> 01:46:55,282
Frost!

1228
01:46:55,782 --> 01:46:56,412
Kill him.

1229
01:46:56,952 --> 01:46:58,532
Wait! I owe you, man.

1230
01:46:59,032 --> 01:47:00,452
I got two new hands, Blade.

1231
01:47:00,952 --> 01:47:03,292
I don't know which one
to use to kill you with!

1232
01:47:03,702 --> 01:47:05,162
Aah!

1233
01:47:17,682 --> 01:47:19,932
Yaah!

1234
01:47:23,642 --> 01:47:25,482
Frost.

1235
01:47:27,562 --> 01:47:28,902
Yaah!

1236
01:47:42,632 --> 01:47:44,552
I got struck
by lightning

1237
01:47:45,962 --> 01:47:47,092
Aah!

1238
01:47:47,512 --> 01:47:49,012
Aah!

1239
01:48:11,412 --> 01:48:12,742
Aah!

1240
01:48:47,332 --> 01:48:49,542
I'm really going to
enjoy this now. Haah!

1241
01:49:14,482 --> 01:49:16,022
Yaah!

1242
01:49:22,282 --> 01:49:24,112
Aah!

1243
01:49:38,002 --> 01:49:39,642
Hey, Blade.

1244
01:49:41,602 --> 01:49:43,562
Let's do this.

1245
01:50:26,732 --> 01:50:28,112
Aah!

1246
01:50:28,652 --> 01:50:30,572
Aah! Aah!

1247
01:50:37,242 --> 01:50:38,952
You're too late, Blade.

1248
01:50:58,522 --> 01:50:59,692
My turn.

1249
01:51:26,222 --> 01:51:27,012
Look at you.

1250
01:51:27,472 --> 01:51:28,682
You're a little bitch.

1251
01:51:30,592 --> 01:51:32,142
What, your serum?

1252
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:34,062
It can't help you
now, stud.

1253
01:51:41,522 --> 01:51:42,562
Nice shot.

1254
01:52:03,642 --> 01:52:05,972
Aah!

1255
01:52:08,272 --> 01:52:10,022
Aah!

1256
01:52:10,442 --> 01:52:12,022
Aah! Aah!

1257
01:52:14,862 --> 01:52:15,572
Some motherfuckers

1258
01:52:16,072 --> 01:52:18,902
are always trying
to ice-skate uphill.

1259
01:52:25,082 --> 01:52:26,032
Uhh!

1260
01:52:35,672 --> 01:52:40,632
Aah!

1261
01:52:50,892 --> 01:52:52,532
Blade!

1262
01:53:00,582 --> 01:53:01,462
Let's get out of here.

1263
01:53:38,582 --> 01:53:40,122
I need to get back
to the lab

1264
01:53:40,582 --> 01:53:43,122
if I'm going to cure you.

1265
01:53:43,622 --> 01:53:45,172
It's not over.

1266
01:53:45,672 --> 01:53:47,082
You keep your cure.

1267
01:53:48,212 --> 01:53:49,672
There's still
a war going on,

1268
01:53:50,172 --> 01:53:52,172
and I have a job to do.

1269
01:53:52,632 --> 01:53:54,382
You want to help,

1270
01:53:54,852 --> 01:53:57,232
make me a better serum.
