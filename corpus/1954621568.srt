David King.

144
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,230
So he's a singer too?

145
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,098
You don't know who he is?

146
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:36,368
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about music.

- What are you doing here?
- Tasting wine.

152
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:54,253
It's free wine tasting, right?
It's what the paper said.

153
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,989
- Right.
- This is Kristen.

154
00:10:57,022 --> 00:11:00,159
Yeah, I remember.
How are you?

155
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,760
The wine is really good.

156

Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

157

Who'd have thunk? I mean,
Kentucky? Heh. Right? Heh.

158
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,038
So are you two...?

159
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:16,108
- No, we... This is, uh...
- Yes. Don't be shy. Don't be shy.

160
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,778
- Jed King.
- Jed King, as in David King?

161
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:22,748
See? Yes.

162
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:25,685

- Thank you.
- Well, there you go.

How's your dad?

166
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:41,267
I don't know.
Why don't you go ask him?

167
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,336
He looks busy.

168
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,171
No, no, I'm sure
he'd love to talk to you.

169
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:49,208
No, maybe later.
Excuse me.

170
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,177
It was nice meeting you again.

171
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:57,983
- Sorry. It's this way.
- He's a winner.

172
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:03,388
Here you are.
Just make yourself at home.

173
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,491
Thanks.

174
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,128

He's a jerk.

175
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,829
You deserve better.

176
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:14,066
Better than a guy who'll dump me
for not sleeping with him.

177
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:17,203
I just don't know
if "better" exists anymore.

178
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,938
Wow.

179
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:23,008
- I just said that, didn't I?
- No, it's okay.

180
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,245
When I get done playing,
and you get done

181
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,414
with whatever you have to do,

182
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,083
you wanna hang out?

183
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:34,119
Look, you seem like
a really nice guy.

184
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:37,222
- A nice... Ow. That hurts.
- Heh.

185
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:41,527
Look, it's only that
I just met you.

186
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,961
Right.

187
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,229
I don't even like him,

188
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:47,866
but it still kind of kills
to see him with her.

189
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,036
Well, I'd hate to see you die.

190
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:53,038
Sorry.

191
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:56,375
- Uh, good luck, Jed.
- Thank you.

192
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,849
"I'd hate to see you die"?

193
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,154
Thank you, everyone.

194
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:11,490
You're in for
a real treat tonight.

195
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:16,962
Give a warm round of applause
for Louisville's Jed King.

196
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,570
Nice banjo, Jed.

197

Thanks, appreciate it.
God bless.

231
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,277
Hi.

232
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:53,051
Wow.

233
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:55,220
That's really nice actually.

234
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,289
Here, I have something
for you too.

235
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,458
Oh. Yeah, this is great.
Thanks.

236
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,726
Really?

237
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,694
I think so.
But like I said,

238
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:05,597
I don't know
anything about music.

239
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,166
Everybody knows something
about music.

240
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,668
Very little, in my case.

241
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:11,470
What's your favorite
Beatles song?

242
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,071
Everybody has a favorite.

243
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,207
"Strawberry Fields Forever,"
"Hey Jude."

244
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,977
Well, I've always really liked
"Turn! Turn! Turn!"

245
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:24,082
♪ To everything
Turn, turn, turn ♪

246
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:28,253
- What? I love that song.
- I love that song too.

247
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:29,755
It's just not the Beatles.

248
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,757
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's the Byrds.

249
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,192
- You're thinking of the Byrds.
- No.

250
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:37,429
- Agree to disagree.
- No, you'd still be wrong.

251
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:40,399
The lyrics are in the Bible.

252
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,336
Can we agree
that God wrote them?

253
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:46,638
Absolutely.

254
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:50,108
Too bad my song
isn't on here. Heh.

255
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,777
Never had my own song before.

256
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,480
You're probably gonna ask me
out again then, huh?

257
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,716
You know what? I'm sorry.

258
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,518
I shouldn't have asked
you out like that.

259
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,086
No, that's all right.

260
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,821
Not without talking
to your dad first.

261
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:05,590
- What?
- He seems like the kind of guy

262
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:07,259
that would appreciate
being asked.

263
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,796
For my hand in marriage maybe,
but one date?

264
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,498
We're gonna have more
than one date.

265
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,133
How do you know?

266
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,601
I know.

267
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:23,408
He's busy with clean-up.
Monday?

268
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:25,477
- Monday.
- Good.

269
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,814
You're gonna need a day
to prepare.

270
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,138
Mr. King,
I don't know you.

271
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,341
That's true, sir.

272
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:58,110
And you can call me Jed,
if you like.

273
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,812
So, what makes you think I
should let you date my daughter?

274
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:03,281
At the very least,
Mr. Jordan,

275
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,450
you know that I'm the kind of
guy that's willing

276
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:09,354
to ask a very intimidating man
if I could date his daughter.

277
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:12,824
No, that says more about me
than it does you.

278
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:16,161
I just want you to know
that I respect you

279
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:18,296
and that I respect Rose.

280
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,665
You sing about God in
your songs, don't you?

281
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:24,636
I sing about things
that I'm passionate about.

282
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:27,739
- Like Rose?
- You heard that, I guess.

283
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:30,876
I love Rose a lot.

284
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,746
And I have always
tried to protect her

285
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,416
from certain
kinds of men out there.

286
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:41,553
Just to be honest,
men like your daddy.

287
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:44,256
He sang about God too,
didn't he?

288
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,359
I know he made mistakes,
Mr. Jordan,

289
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,195
but he learned from them.
So did I.

290
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,331
I won't repeat them.

291
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,646
So I'm not gonna lie,

292
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,382
your dad freaked me out
just a little bit.

293
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,384
Well, you're gonna have
to tell me all about it,

294
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,519
because I wasn't listening.

295
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:15,754
- Oh, no?
- Nope.

296
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,722
Okay. Uh...

297
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:20,525
Well, since you
weren't listening,

298
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:22,827
I'll give you the highlights.

299
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,963
He loves you a lot,

300
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:28,533
and he has quite the collection
going on in that room.

301
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:31,403
Ha, ha. Yeah.

302
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,978
- It wasn't great.
- Heh, heh.

303
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:46,418
So, yeah, I was basically raised
by my father and two brothers.

304
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:50,589
But they weren't cut out
for wine making, so they bailed.

305
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,357
You think you'll ever bail?

306
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,259
No.

307
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:55,827
No, I love it.

308
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,430
Yours skipped like 10 times.

309
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,998
- Well...
- How do you do that?

310
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:03,435
My dad, he was legendary
at slinging these things.

311
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,703
Lethal, some would say.

312
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,971
I don't know. I mean,

313
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:09,441
I guess I can find a career to
help me pay for all the stuff

314
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,577
I'll eventually throw away,
or leave to someone else,

315
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,382
but family's forever.

316
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:19,351
Right?

317
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,553
Agree to disagree.

318
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,291
<i>And side-arm it, right?</i>

319
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,660
And flick your wrist at the end.

320
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,297
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha!

321
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,965
There you go.

322
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:35,867

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,702

I'm glad you think so.

361

- Everyone thought so.
- Well...

362
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:01,513
That last song, well,
people really liked that one.

363
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,816

364
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:09,154
That was my dad's song.

365
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,989

366
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,557
Oh, I'm sorry.

367
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,060
Don't be, it's fine.
It's a good song.

368
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,996
You know, sometimes...

369
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,634
I think about
letting it go. Music.

370
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,003
I look at you...

371
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,906

00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,645
I mean, look.

374
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,815
I see God here.

375
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,851
If you could ask God
for anything,

376
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:42,421
and you know he'd say yes...

377
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,892
I'd want to be wise.

378
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:50,529
That way I can live right...

379
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,899
and really live.

380
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,668
And if I did sing,

381
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,904
it'd only be because
I had something to say.

382
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:03,842
You should just ask for that.

383
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,779
I won't listen. Go ahead.

384
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:14,052
God, I wanna be wise.
Please.

385
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,758
You feel any different?

386
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:37,242
You think your dad would let me
build a chapel here

387
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,544
at the vineyard?

388
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:42,680
Like the one in your book
with the sticky note thing.

389
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,749
Why would you want to?

390
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:46,518
So I could marry you.

391
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:50,788
I'll ask your dad.

392
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:53,124

Can I help you?

514
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,388
Well, you actually
already have, Jed. I just, uh...

515
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,190
I don't smoke.

516
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:56,293
And I definitely don't sleep
with groupies, so just...

517
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:05,503
Actually, I heard you were
really religious, and so...

518
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,739
- I take it you're not.
- I'm spiritual.

522
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:18,883
You know, normally,

523
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,453
I would be really,
really offended,

524
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:25,523
but you are just so cute.

525
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:30,194
And now I get to have a secret,

526
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:35,900
Okay. It's good to meet you,

527

This whole thing is great.

528
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:40,337
No, I know. I just
thought I'd introduce...

00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,582
I've heard of her
but never seen her.

544
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:02,553

- Oh. How are you?
- Good.

562
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:56,006
- Good.
- This is a nice surprise.

563
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,042
- Did the show get canceled?
- I wish.

564
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,910
I fly out tomorrow
morning actually.

565
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:02,746
I just had to come home,
you know?

566
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,683
- Do you wanna be in my band?
- That's what I wanna do.

567
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,017
That's why I came home.

568
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,420
Go upstairs and get
that ready, all right?

569
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,792
Thank you.

570
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:19,530
Yeah, I just wanted to be
with my wife, you know?

571
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:23,500
Don't start
what you can't finish.

572
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:24,601
Nap time?

573
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:29,073
No, I'm afraid
we've outgrown nap time.

574
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,942
I miss it.
I'm exhausted.

575
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:40,117
- Tonight, I promise.
- Tonight.

576
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,686
I'm gonna hold you to that.

577
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,331
Couldn't hold out
for another couple weeks, huh?

578
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:52,096
- How long this time?
- Three months.

579
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,431
Stan added Shelby Bale
to the tour.

580
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,735
- Who?
- She's just this singer

581
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:01,071
with a cult following, and I get
her fans, she gets my fans,

582
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:04,007
and we book a lot more shows
and make more money.

583
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,511
Do you need more money, or fans?

584
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:09,713
- It's not just that, Rose.
- Then what?

585
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:11,115
I'm helping people.

586
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,418
I know it sounds stupid,
but in my own way, I am.

587
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:15,786
Look, I get e-mails

588
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:18,055
and people coming up to me
saying that they...

589
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:20,023
I'm helping their life
make sense.

590
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:22,893
They were about to give up
and they heard my songs.

591
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:27,631
People are looking for stuff,
Rose. Meaning, hope, God.

592
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:30,834
I don't tell them,
they're not gonna hear.

593
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,002
Jed.

594
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:33,704
Your biggest fan is upstairs

595
00:39:33,737 --> 00:39:35,773
and he needs you more
than God does.

596
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:38,776
Bring him and come with me.

597
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,611
So he can sleep
on buses and jets?

598
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,046
Getting dragged
from hotel to hotel?

599
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,715
What kind of life is that?

600
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:47,084
It's not a life, Rose.
I'm talking about three months.

601
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:48,485
Which will become a year.

602
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,788
You won't have a reason
to tell Stan no.

603
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,623
You'll have me to play groupie.

604
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,893
What is that supposed to mean?

605
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,730
Feels like you don't
come home for me anymore.

606
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:02,133
It's like you come home for...

607
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:09,006
Let me fix that.
Please, I'm trying to fix that.

608
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,542
If you come with me,
I'll see you every day.

609
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,777
I'll see Ray.
We'll spend time together.

610
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,647
- Please.
- It's not just Ray, Jed.

611
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,016
What?

612
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,984
Your dad has a dead bear
in his living room.

613
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:22,786
I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

614
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:24,688
- Please.
- No, no.

615
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:26,557
He's not doing well, Jed.

616
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,427
Daddy, do you wanna be
in my band now?

617
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:35,065
Sorry.

618
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,470
Yeah, buddy.
Yeah, come on.

619
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,639
All right, let's go.

620
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,781
Drum solo!

621
00:40:52,682 --> 00:40:55,052
I got blisters on my fingers.

622
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,554
<i>All right, Ringo.
It sounds good.</i>

623
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:13,137
Rose.

624
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,707
Rose.

625
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:24,048
Ray's asleep.

626
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:27,885
I fell asleep.

627
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,887
Yeah, you did.

628
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:33,757
Okay.

629
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,629
Rose.

630
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,533
Rose.

631
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,927
When are you gonna stop
being so rude?

632
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:12,963
I'm Shelby.

633
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:15,032
I know.

634
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,767
You know now.

635
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,138
Why didn't you just tell me
who you were?

636
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,307
Kindness.
I was being nice.

637
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,175
How is that being nice?

638
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:28,011
For a moment,
you felt wanted and...

639
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:29,780
It's a good feeling, isn't it?

640
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:34,585
Okay, unless turning me down
was unpleasant.

641
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,286
If it was, I'm really sorry.

642
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,990
You can let me know
how to make it up to you.

643
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:45,896
<i>Hello, you've reached Rose.
Please leave me a message.</i>

644
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:48,231
Hey, babe, it's me.

645
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:52,035
I just wanted to call
and say that I love you,

646
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:56,807
and that I miss you
and I'm thinking about you.

647
00:42:58,308 --> 00:43:01,778
I'll talk to you later.

- That was awesome. So good.
- Oh, thank you.

682

but that was ridiculous.

needed a little ladies' touch.

see a lady up here right now.

sing the song,

694
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,001

00:47:52,101 --> 00:47:53,871
Welcome home.

702
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:58,575
Thank you.

703
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:00,477
Where's Ray?

704
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,046
He's asleep.

705
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,514
Good.

706
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,619
Hi.

707
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:11,388
I'm really tired, Jed.

708
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,124
Me too.
I'm exhausted.

709
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,493
I've been gone a long time.

710
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,162
How long are you home this time?

711
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:29,673
The tour was great, Rose.
Thanks for asking.

712
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,574
Had a great time.

713
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:35,178
I know how the tour was.
I have the Internet.

714
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:37,948
It's how I get to know
my husband.

715
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,283
You have the money too, right?

716
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:42,986
You think that's what
I care about?

717
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,722
I think you care about
your dad and I can feel it

718
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:48,224
every time I'm laying
in bed by myself.

719
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,928
Thinking about
all you care about.

720
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,432
Rose, if that was all I
cared about, I could get it.

721
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,970
I wouldn't have to come home.

722
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:03,974
Can we at least talk first?

723
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,543
"Hi, honey, how was your day?
How was your year?"

724
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:10,046
Don't exaggerate. Don't act
like I haven't seen you

725
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,249
and we haven't had the
same fight every two weeks.

726
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:15,418
I was trying to get you
to do something romantic.

727
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:17,554
I was trying to do
something romantic.

728
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,323
Ask you to do something
besides just grab me.

729
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:23,426
How awful for you.
To feel desired by your spouse.

730
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:26,029
- It's a terrible thing.
- Leave me alone, Jed.

731
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:27,297
Forgive my insensitivity,

732
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,599
but I don't have a lot
of experience in that.

733
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,334
Maybe you can tell me
what that's like.

734
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:33,036
Leave me alone!

735
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,373
I'm sorry.

736
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,143
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

737
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:46,216
- Hey, come here.
- Hey. Hey, buddy.

738
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:51,154
- What's wrong, Mom?
- Hey. Oh, nothing, baby.

739
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:54,324
Everything's fine.
It's okay.

740
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:56,560
I just miss your daddy.

741
00:49:58,327 --> 00:50:00,197
That's all.

742
00:50:02,098 --> 00:50:03,366
Let's go to bed.

743
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:14,210
<i>Come, my beloved.
Let us go to the countryside.</i>

744
00:50:14,243 --> 00:50:18,782
You old buzzard. Oh!
What a big boy. Ha-ha-ha.

745
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:23,319
- Unh! Let Pop-Pop put you down.
- Ha, ha. Hey, Daddy.

746
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:25,088
<i>Let us go early to the vineyards</i>

747
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:26,823
<i>to see if the vines have budded.</i>

748
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:29,159
- Hey.
- Shep.

749
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,393
How you doing? Welcome.

750
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:33,530
Ha, ha. Hey,
you little rascal.

751
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,401
What are you doing, buddy?

752
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:40,136
Come back here.

753
00:50:41,804 --> 00:50:45,809
- Daddy? You all right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

754
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,410
That little rascal.

755
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:50,113
I'm gonna go over here
and work this other row, hon.

756
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:51,348
All right.

757
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,286
Oh, come on, buddy.
Come on.

758
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,822
Oh! Oh, you got me.
You got me.

759
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:03,326
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
You got me. I'm done.

760
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,229
You gonna help me?

761
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:09,699
All right.

762
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:13,470
- Jed.
- It's all right.

763
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,140
I found this.

764
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,480
- Oh, okay. All right.
- What are you doing, buddy?

765
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:27,250
- I'm making them grow faster.
- Ha, ha. No.

766
00:51:27,283 --> 00:51:29,452
You're making them
grow faster, huh?

767
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,754
Oh, buddy
that's not how it works.

768
00:51:31,787 --> 00:51:33,590
If you force them,
you'll get bad grapes.

769
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,258
- You want bad grapes?
- Yes.

770
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,593
No.

771
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,194
No, you don't want bad grapes.

772
00:51:38,227 --> 00:51:40,597
- Yes, I do.
- Ha, ha.

773
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,199
- Treat them right.
- Okay.

774
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:44,601
- Give them time.
- Okay.

775
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,203
And when they're ready,
they'll let you know.

776
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:48,438
Okay.

777
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:53,844
Okay.

778
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:21,438
<i>I undertook great projects.</i>

779
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,578
<i>I built houses
and planted vineyards.</i>

780
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:42,626
<i>In all this,
my wisdom stayed with me.</i>

781
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:48,531
Have fun with your grandpa,
okay?

782
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,266
We'll be back in a couple hours,
hon.

783
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:52,435
All right, Daddy. Bye.

784
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,334
Come to Europe with me.

785
00:53:58,968 --> 00:54:00,336
Please.

786
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:01,704
I'm hoping
we can come visit soon.

787
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:05,909
No, Rose, not visit.
Come with me.

788
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:11,781
I can't, Jed.

789
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:17,387
You've seen him lately.
I can't leave him.

790
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:20,624
Not now.

791
00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:25,795
Okay.

792
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:27,464
I understand.

793
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:35,571
<i>And when I surveyed
all my hands had done,</i>

794
00:54:35,604 --> 00:54:38,408
<i>what I had toiled to achieve,</i>

795
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,644
<i>everything was meaningless.</i>

796
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:43,880
<i>A chasing after the wind.</i>

797
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:48,718
<i>Nothing was gained
under the sun.</i>

798
00:55:00,796 --> 00:55:03,300
<i>There was a man all alone.</i>

799
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:11,474
<i>There was no end to his toil.</i>

800
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:15,011
<i>Yet his eyes were not
content with his wealth.</i>

801
00:55:15,044 --> 00:55:17,981
Hey, you're growing, buddy.

802
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,452
<i>"For who am I toiling?"
he asked.</i>

803
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,822
<i>"And why am I depriving
myself of enjoyment?"</i>

804
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,825
<i>Whoever loves money
never has enough.</i>

805
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:38,101
♪ Oh ♪

806
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:41,338
♪ Oh ♪

807
00:55:42,471 --> 00:55:46,008
♪ Oh ♪

808
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:51,681
♪ Love is the power
That heals ♪

809
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:54,617
Thank you, Glasgow!

810
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,018
Thank you, Dublin!

811
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:57,520
Thank you, London!

812
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:02,025
- I love you! I love you!
- Ha-ha-ha.

813
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,902
<i>This too is meaningless.</i>

814
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:23,380
Ow! Ha-ha-ha.

815
00:56:26,882 --> 00:56:30,686
Okay, all right.
All right, shut up, people.

816
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,157
Uh, Mr. King, your turn.

817
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,093
Uh-oh.

818
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:39,762
- I'm good. I'm good.
- Oh, yeah.

819
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:42,532
So I think he's adding drinking
to the list of things

820
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,500
he's only done with his wife.

821
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:46,736
Ooh...

822
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:52,809
You guys, he has got a vineyard
back home. A vineyard.

823
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,511
Because he knows,
as soon as he gets home

824
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:59,816
and walks through
his big front door,

825
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:03,086
he can have all the wine
he wants.

826
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,689
Am I right?

827
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,058
No.

828
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,063
Heh, are you serious?

829
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:22,171
Okay. I'm sorry,
I didn't know. I just...

830
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:23,873
I hate seeing you like this

831
00:57:23,906 --> 00:57:25,808
and I wanted you
to have a good time.

832
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:28,544
Enjoy it.

833
00:57:28,577 --> 00:57:30,079
Are there not shots on the bar?

834
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:33,249
I think there's shots
on the bar. Right?

835
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:37,119
<i>Jed! Jed! Jed!</i>

836
00:57:37,152 --> 00:57:40,590
All I'm saying is,
you've earned it.

837
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,626
<i>Jed! Jed! Jed!</i>

838
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,029
- Come on, man!
- Let's do this!

839
00:57:47,062 --> 00:57:48,062
Whoo!

840
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,002
Ladies and gentlemen,

841
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,605
I think we all owe it to
Miss Shelby Bale.

842
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,739
Give it up.

843
00:58:02,778 --> 00:58:05,848
This one's for my boys,
ladies and gentlemen.

844
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,561
Ah!

845
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:24,100
- He can't even walk.
- Ha-ha-ha.

846
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:27,603
- That's your band. Ha-ha-ha.
- I know.

847
00:58:27,636 --> 00:58:29,872
- It's your room.
- Oh.

848
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:31,140
Okay.

849
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:35,645
So did you have a good time?

850
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,715
I really did. Thank you.

851
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:41,250
Thank you.

852
00:58:41,283 --> 00:58:44,220
Now I get to scratch "Visit
England" off my to-do list.

853
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:48,291
Was that right after
"Get a whole lot of tattoos"?

854
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:53,229
I've been noticing.
You have one or two.

855
00:58:53,262 --> 00:58:54,931
Uh, yeah, no. Uh-uh.

856
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:58,267
It was after
"Meet Jed King."

857
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,236
- Oh.
- Mm.

858
00:59:02,638 --> 00:59:03,673
Seriously.

859
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,710
What's the story
with these? Hm?

860
00:59:07,743 --> 00:59:10,580
Just my way of preserving
memories, I guess.

861
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:14,984
- You should try scrap-booking.
- Scrap-booking.

862
00:59:15,017 --> 00:59:17,053
Heh. Ha-ha-ha.

863
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,589
It's just...
It seems more prudent.

864
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,357
Yeah, it kills memories.

865
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,192
- It kills memories?
- It's a fact.

866
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:24,794
I don't know.

867
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:29,832
It's just that a photo replaces
a memory in your mind.

868
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:31,801
Mm.

869
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,169
I see these and the memories

870
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,738
just come flooding back,
you know?

871
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:38,674
So you don't regret any of them?

872
00:59:38,707 --> 00:59:43,846
Feeling regret and guilt is like
punching yourself in the face.

873
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:47,116
Sure, it hurts, but it's
self-inflicted, so don't do it.

874
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:51,220
That's how I feel about tattoos.

875
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:55,992
Well, all I'm saying

876
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:58,995
is do what you want...

877
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:03,600
and don't feel guilty about it.

878
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:23,953
Good night, Jed.

879
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:46,075
<i>I said to myself, "Come now,
I will test you with pleasure</i>

880
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:48,077
<i>to find out what is good."</i>

881
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,413
<i>But that also proved
to be meaningless.</i>

886
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,849
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

887
01:01:26,882 --> 01:01:28,818
- Good morning. Um...
- What time is it?

888
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,854
It is 1:15.

889
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:38,394
You okay?

890
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:41,831
- Yeah, you?
- Mm-hm.

891
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:46,202
- You can take that if you want.
- Uh, what?

892
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,937
The phone.

893
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,942
Actually, it's you.
I'm sorry. I, uh...

894
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,478
I grabbed it for you
because you left it at the bar

895
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,880
and obviously forgot to give it
back to you, so, yeah.

896
01:01:57,913 --> 01:02:00,082
Whoa.

897
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:03,352
Jed, I'm sorry.

898
01:02:03,385 --> 01:02:05,087
- It's okay.
- I feel terrible.

899
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,424
It's not your fault.
I should call her back though.

900
01:02:08,457 --> 01:02:10,293
Yeah.

901
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,235
- See you later, okay?
- Mm.

902
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:30,480
<i>- Jed.</i>
- Hey.

903
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:36,252
Where were you? I've been trying
to get a hold of you all night.

904
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:48,264
There's a time for everything,

905
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:51,400
and a season for every purpose
under heaven.

906
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:55,070
<i>The wise have eyes
in their heads</i>

907
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:56,973
<i>while the fool walks
in darkness.</i>

908
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:04,380
<i>But I came to realize that the
same fate overtakes them both.</i>

909
01:03:06,633 --> 01:03:08,022
<i>So then I said to myself,</i>

910
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:12,955
<i>"Like the fool,
the wise too must die."</i>

911
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:18,194
<i>What then do
I gain by being wise?</i>

912
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,531
No, no. I'm sorry, sir.
No!

913
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:12,348
- Hello?
- Oh, buddy, man, I woke you up.

914
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:15,951
- What time is it over there?
- It's 6 a.m.

915
01:04:15,984 --> 01:04:18,487
<i>Wow, man. Do you want me
to call you back?</i>

916
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,489
No, it's fine.

917
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:22,967
Listen, are you anxious
to get back out here?

918
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:26,462
- Yeah.
- Because we are certainly anxious

919
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:29,098
and excited about
having you back out here.

920
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,100
<i>Friday is Amsterdam.
Everything is a go.</i>

921
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,568
Stan, listen.

922
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:35,070
<i>Brother, we have lost six shows.</i>

923
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:36,438
Now, I know
that was an emergency.

924
01:04:36,471 --> 01:04:38,240
But we have an emergency
here, okay?

925
01:04:38,273 --> 01:04:39,642
We are hemorrhaging money.

926
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:41,210
Hemorrhaging money, man.

927
01:04:41,243 --> 01:04:45,180
- People are getting upset.
- Stan, this is my life.

928
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:46,482
This is my life.

929
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,284
And this is how you pay
for your life.

930
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:51,220
If you were a nobody,
still just David King's kid,

931
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:54,523
I wouldn't care what you did.
No one would.

932
01:04:54,556 --> 01:04:58,127
But I don't think that's
who you wanna be, or is it?

933
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,231
Because you can always
just walk away.

934
01:05:14,576 --> 01:05:17,079
I have to go back.

935
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,550
- Please.
- I don't have a choice.

936
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:25,087
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do. Please just stay.

937
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,557
If I stay, we're gonna owe
a lot of money.

938
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,960
Take me with you then.

939
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,697
I can't...
I can't do that, Rose.

940
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,332
Why?

941
01:05:40,402 --> 01:05:44,640
All the reasons you said.
I can't do that to Ray.

942
01:05:44,673 --> 01:05:48,644
I should've gone with you then.
I'm so sorry, Jed.

943
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:51,046
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

944
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:53,416
I should've gone with you.

945
01:05:55,150 --> 01:06:00,456
You have a lot to do.
You have a lot to do here. Okay?

946
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,058
Help me get through
these next eight weeks.

947
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:07,363
Then I have a show in Cinci,
and then I have a break.

948
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,165
How long?

949
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:12,234
We'll start with a year.

950
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,572
Okay?

951
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:18,207
Okay.

952
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,413
<i>Amsterdam!</i>

953
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,150
Can I just tell you
what a great time

954
01:06:28,183 --> 01:06:30,486
we've had in your city tonight?
Ha, ha.

955
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,032
Well, there's more fun
to be had.

956
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:28,277
- Hey, Jed.
- Aah.

957
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,511
What is it? What's wrong?

958
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:31,146
I can't breathe.

959
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:33,215
- Slow down.
- He's having a panic attack.

960
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:34,583
Listen to me.

961
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:37,228
- I can't feel my hands.
- You're not gonna die.

962
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:43,692
Jed. To help you relax, okay?

963
01:07:43,725 --> 01:07:48,163
I'm just trying to help you.

964
01:07:48,196 --> 01:07:52,835
- I can't sing that song, Shel.
- Yes, you can, Jedediah.

965
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,470
It's her song.

966
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:57,206
No, it's your song.

967
01:08:00,742 --> 01:08:04,379
Do you ever feel like you
don't write your own songs? Hm?

968
01:08:04,412 --> 01:08:07,483
- Like they were given to you?
- By who?

969
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:11,753
God?

970
01:08:11,786 --> 01:08:13,722
- What if he takes them away?
- Why?

971
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:17,126
Because he doesn't like
what you're doing?

972
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,548
Look at the world.
You like what he's doing?

973
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:29,338
The first time
I heard your music,

974
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:34,476
I thought, "This is it.
This guy really gets it.

975
01:08:34,509 --> 01:08:36,345
This is what I need."

976
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,350
But I also thought, you know,
"If only he weren't so...

977
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,252
Married.

978
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,254
...narrow.

979
01:08:47,255 --> 01:08:51,293
But think of the music he could
write if he just let go

980
01:08:51,326 --> 01:08:55,898
and lived without
all of these rules."

981
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,838
And then I realized,
"I can help him let go.

982
01:09:05,473 --> 01:09:08,544
He needs me to."

983
01:09:10,812 --> 01:09:14,183
I thought I was going to die
out there.

984
01:09:16,451 --> 01:09:18,618
I don't ever wanna feel
like that again.

985
01:09:20,455 --> 01:09:22,224
You won't.

986
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,303
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

987
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:40,676
<i>I tried cheering myself with

988

993
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,828

994
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,130
What do you think?

995
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:05,801
You're the expert.
What do you think?

996
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,876

Why didn't you tell me?

1020
01:11:42,697 --> 01:11:44,867
I wanted to tell you in person.

1021
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:49,938
Hi, Shelby.

1022
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:51,640
I'll be right there.

1023
01:11:51,673 --> 01:11:53,675
I'll be right there.
Yup.

- Shelby.
- Yeah.

1025
01:11:55,677 --> 01:11:57,946
This is my wife, Rose.

1026
01:11:57,979 --> 01:11:59,815
Yeah. It's really
nice to meet you.

1027
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,350
Nice to meet you too.

1028
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:03,852
Great show tonight.
You're very talented.

- Ray.

You are so handsome.

1032
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:19,868
I've heard so much about you.
I feel like I know you guys.

1033
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:23,572
But I did not know
that you were expecting.

1034
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,841
- Neither did he.
- Oh.

1035
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:28,410
No?

1036
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,148
I'm gonna go drink
with the guys.

1037
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:34,716
We were headed out.

1038
01:12:34,749 --> 01:12:37,085

- Yes.

01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,861
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1043
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,918
I missed you.

1044
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:11,754
I missed you.

1045
01:13:32,974 --> 01:13:35,177
When did you get this?

1046
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,079
Amsterdam.

1047
01:13:38,813 --> 01:13:40,615
Why?

1048
01:13:40,648 --> 01:13:42,184
I don't know.

1049
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,720
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

1050
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:48,957
Oh.

1051
01:14:10,111 --> 01:14:11,880
Everything okay?

1052
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:16,218
Yeah, just...

1053
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:18,053
Just give me a second.

1054
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:01,997
Jed, please don't do this to me.

1055
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:06,067
Please.

1056
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,637
Let's just go back out there.

1057
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,305
No, no, no.

1058
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:17,546
I'll sing it myself.

1059
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,883
No, no, no,
you won't sing that, no.

1060
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:24,052
You will never sing that song.

1061
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:26,188
You will never sing that song!

1062
01:15:31,993 --> 01:15:34,696
Play it.
Just play the song.

1063
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:41,303
♪ I've been waiting for you
To... ♪

1064
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:45,607
Stop it! No!

1065
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:03,258
You think you're better than me?

1066
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:05,327
You think she's better than me?

1067
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,963
- What was that?
- You broke it! You broke it!

1068
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,632
- Shelby! Get off.
- You think you're better?

1069
01:16:10,665 --> 01:16:12,834
- Get off me!
- Stop! Stop!

1070
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:15,303
No! I'm gonna tell her!
Let me go!

1071
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:17,906
I'm gonna tell her!
I'm gonna...

1072
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:19,674
- Are you threatening me?
- Jed!

1073
01:16:19,707 --> 01:16:21,643
You don't threaten me!

1074
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,118
I love you.

1075
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:33,955
I love you.

1076
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,663
I love you.

1077
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:47,202
Yeah, Stan, this is Matt.
I'm over at will call.

1078
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:49,237
I'm gonna call you back.
Thank you.

1079
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,672
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

1080
01:16:52,306 --> 01:16:56,645
Look, I don't care what you do.
I don't care who you do it with.

1081
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,380
When you bring
your problems on stage,

1082
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,015
they become my problems.

1083
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,283
My very expensive problems.

1084
01:17:02,316 --> 01:17:05,320
Now, if you can't keep your
baggage off stage, I will.

1085
01:17:05,353 --> 01:17:07,856
Shelby, you are done. Done!

1086
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:29,344
I was hoping to bring Ray
to your Nashville show also.

1087
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:30,779
That be all right?

1088
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:34,416
Jed?

1089
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,685
Yes. That would be fine.

1090
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:43,859
Why is Shelby off the tour?

1091
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:48,397
I read that
she was off the tour.

1092
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:52,333
She punched Stan in the face.

1093
01:17:52,366 --> 01:17:54,803
Good for her.

1094
01:17:56,971 --> 01:17:58,973
- Why?
- I don't know.

1095
01:17:59,006 --> 01:18:03,078
Look, I don't wanna talk
about work right now.

1096
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,799
Rose. What?

1097
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:36,078
Do you not want me here?

1098
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,415
You're not here.

1099
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:43,318
We have to say your name five
times before you even answer.

1100
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:46,821
- Something is wrong.
- I'm just tired.

1101
01:18:46,854 --> 01:18:49,057
Why aren't you singing my song?

1102
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,494
Do you...?

1103
01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:58,767
- Do you not love me anymore?
- Rose, of course I do.

1104
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,770
- Why would you ask me that?
- Sing it.

1105
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:05,807
I want you to sing it right now.

1106
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,344
Rose, that song
is special to me.

1107
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,546
All right,
it holds a special place,

1108
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:14,249
and I'm just tired of
being demanded

1109
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:17,118
to sing it like some sort of
performance monkey.

1110
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:19,387
What is that?

1111
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,055
- What?
- Shh.

1112
01:19:21,088 --> 01:19:22,491
Try it.

1113
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:26,094
High five.

1114
01:19:26,127 --> 01:19:29,230
You still didn't get it.
You spit, but you didn't get it.

1115
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:30,875
- But you can try...
- Shelby?

1116
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,236
Hey, Jed.

1117
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,339
Hey, babe, come here.

1118
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:41,176
What are you doing here?

1119
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:44,079
Why didn't you answer
your phone?

1120
01:19:45,913 --> 01:19:49,284
I'm having dinner with my
family. What do you want?

1121
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:54,889
Okay, can you just tell Stan
to bring me back?

1122
01:19:54,922 --> 01:19:56,257
Shelby, don't come to
my house...

1123
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:59,828
What? Are you done with me,
is that it?

1124
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,469
Please.

1125
01:20:13,407 --> 01:20:15,310
- Ray, go inside, please.
- Okay.

1126
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:16,911
Because of me?

1127
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:22,450
Honey, he's the druggie.

1128
01:20:22,483 --> 01:20:25,987
- He's the one that takes all my...
- Get out.

1129
01:20:34,495 --> 01:20:38,233
Seriously, dinner on the porch,
how cute.

1130
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:40,202
Okay. Got it.

1131
01:20:45,072 --> 01:20:46,441
You too.

1132
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:49,444
Get out.

1133
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:53,215
- Rose.
- Get out!

1134
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:15,970
- Get out of the car.
- That wine was terrible.

1135
01:21:16,003 --> 01:21:17,439
Get out of the car.

1136
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:34,022
- Jed, stop.
- Stop talking!

1137
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:04,286
Ray, where's your mom?

1138
01:22:09,123 --> 01:22:10,492
Rose.

1139
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,468
You were with her!

1140
01:22:22,603 --> 01:22:26,474
While I was here
carrying our child.

1141
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:28,676
- You think this is what I wanted?
- Yes!

1142
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:31,079
It's what you did.
This was your choice!

1143
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,181
I wanted you!

1144
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,716
But you made me beg.

1145
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,352
Girls are begging me
and I had to beg my wife.

1146
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:39,053
Don't blame this on me, Jed.

1147
01:22:39,086 --> 01:22:41,089
You did this.
Don't blame this on me!

1148
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:44,659
I did this,
and I'm glad I did this.

1149
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,330
I'm glad I didn't have to jump
through 15,000 hoops

1150
01:22:49,363 --> 01:22:52,667
or build a chapel,
Rose, to do it.

1151
01:22:54,368 --> 01:22:55,537
She wants me.

1152
01:22:57,104 --> 01:22:58,139
Me!

1153
01:22:58,172 --> 01:23:00,341
Because she doesn't
know you, Jed.

1154
01:23:00,374 --> 01:23:02,610
- She does.
- No, she doesn't!

1155
01:23:02,643 --> 01:23:04,645
- She does!
- She thinks she does.

1156
01:23:04,678 --> 01:23:07,348
She thinks she matters.
I used to think that.

1157
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:09,017
You used to think
you mattered so much

1158
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,652
you could treat me
however you wanted.

1159
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:13,788
How dare I ask to be treated

1160
01:23:13,821 --> 01:23:16,090
like an actual human being
before I give it up?

1161
01:23:16,123 --> 01:23:17,492
How cruel, right?

1162
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,694
You'd tell me over and over
you didn't want me.

1163
01:23:19,727 --> 01:23:23,531
- I never said that. I never...
- You did!

1164
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:27,735
And now that somebody
actually wants me,

1165
01:23:27,768 --> 01:23:31,139
now you wanna act like a wife.

1166
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,541
- It's a little late.
- You didn't want a wife.

1167
01:23:33,574 --> 01:23:35,743
- I did!
- You didn't. You wanted a whore.

1168
01:23:35,776 --> 01:23:37,779
- That's not true!
- Someone who would lay there.

1169
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,747
It is true.

1170
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:43,351
It clearly is 'cause that's what
showed up at our house today!

1171
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:47,756
You don't even know her!
You don't even know her!

1172
01:23:54,628 --> 01:23:56,664
Right.

1173
01:23:56,697 --> 01:23:58,166
Right.

1174
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:03,338
Because she's the wife
you always wanted.

1175
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:07,409
She's gonna raise your children?

1176
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,312
She's gonna grow old with you?

1177
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:16,551
And then, with her sleazy
saggy tattoos,

1178
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,820
that skank will always
be in the mood, right?

1179
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:21,355
You're a fool, Jed.
You are such a fool!

1180
01:24:21,388 --> 01:24:24,592
You're right!
You're right!

1181
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:28,596
I am a fool!
You're right!

1182
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:30,398
You're right!

1183
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:55,090
I'm a fool
because I married you.

1184
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,327
But I'm done.

1185
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:05,867
<i>So I hated life,</i>

1186
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,236
<i>because the work
that is done under the sun</i>

1187
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:10,138
<i>was grievous to me.</i>

1188
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,444
<i>What do people get for all
the toil and anxious striving</i>

1189
01:25:16,477 --> 01:25:19,213
<i>with which
they labor under the sun?</i>

1190
01:25:21,448 --> 01:25:24,652
<i>All their days,
their work is grief and pain.</i>

1191
01:25:30,824 --> 01:25:33,895
<i>Even at night,
their minds do not rest.</i>

1192
01:25:36,497 --> 01:25:38,666
<i>This too is meaningless.</i>

1193
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:04,292
Jed. Stop, stop, stop.

1194
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,394
What are you doing? Stop.

1195
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:08,396
- I want it off.
- Stop it.

1196
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:11,399
- Stop!
- I want it off.

1197
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,201
Did you flush them?

1198
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:20,341
No, no, no.
Please say something.

1199
01:26:20,374 --> 01:26:21,576
Jed. Jed.

1200
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:24,545
Jed, please. Jed, please.

1201
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:26,681
Jed. Please, come on.

1202
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:31,686
Please. Please wake up.
Please wake up. Wake up.

1203
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:35,289
Please. Please.
Will you please talk to me?

1204
01:26:35,322 --> 01:26:38,326
- Please say something.
- Rose.

1205
01:26:49,036 --> 01:26:51,306
Jed! Jed!

1206
01:26:55,643 --> 01:27:00,748
- No! No! No!
- Jed! Jed. Stop running.

1207
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:38,886
What would have happened
if you would've died, Jed?

1208
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:44,392
You would've been better off.

1209
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:45,981
You would've had everything.

1210
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:52,400
Jed, what did we have
when we first got married?

1211
01:27:54,034 --> 01:27:56,904
I had everything I needed.

1212
01:27:59,106 --> 01:28:01,709
But you didn't.

1213
01:28:03,944 --> 01:28:05,813
You still don't.

1214
01:28:07,414 --> 01:28:09,684
I made mistakes.

1215
01:28:11,385 --> 01:28:15,857
With us, there's things that

1216
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,493
I wish I could do over.

1217
01:28:19,526 --> 01:28:24,598
But I can't give you whatever
it is you're looking for.

1218
01:28:24,631 --> 01:28:26,768
No one can.

1219
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:32,373
When Dad died, I realized

1220
01:28:32,406 --> 01:28:36,544
there's nothing in this world
that won't go away

1221
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:37,912
eventually.

1222
01:28:39,446 --> 01:28:41,415
My only hope

1223
01:28:41,448 --> 01:28:44,115
is that there's something
bigger than this world.

1224
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,890
What if that's a fool's hope?

1225
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:55,563
Then I'll take it.
I'll take it.

1226
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,733
If I'm gonna raise a son
and a daughter on my own,

1227
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:00,768
I need to believe
there's a point.

1228
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:03,738
A girl?

1229
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:08,409
Found out I'm having a girl.

1230
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:14,815
You wanna raise them
on your own?

1231
01:29:14,848 --> 01:29:17,552
That wasn't my plan, Jed.

1232
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:24,926
I want a man who believes in
something bigger than all this.

1233
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,663
Someone greater than himself.

1234
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,370
And that's not you anymore.

1235
01:29:38,505 --> 01:29:41,809
That man died a long time ago.

1236
01:29:51,518 --> 01:29:53,788
Goodbye, Jed.

There's something here.

There's something here
we can build on.

1284
01:33:00,974 --> 01:33:04,345
It's a story of redemption.

1285

This isn't redemption,
this is exploitation.

01:41:41,294 --> 01:41:42,429
Where's your mom?

1387
01:41:42,462 --> 01:41:44,464
She's over there
by the wine people.

1388
01:41:44,497 --> 01:41:46,433
Heh. By the wine people?
Okay.

1389
01:41:46,466 --> 01:41:47,866
I'm gonna go talk
to her, all right?

1390
01:41:47,867 --> 01:41:49,603
- Okay.
- I love you.

1391
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:51,638
- Okay.
- You know that? Ow.

1392
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,609
I'll see you in
a little bit, okay?

1393
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:57,177
- Okay.
- All right.

1394
01:41:59,846 --> 01:42:01,648
I'm glad you could make it.

1395
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:09,490
Excuse me.

1396
01:42:10,423 --> 01:42:13,226
Rose.

1397
01:42:13,259 --> 01:42:15,862
What are you doing here?
I thought you had a show.

1398
01:42:15,895 --> 01:42:17,264
I love you.

1399
01:42:19,232 --> 01:42:22,903
- I love you.
- Jed, stop. Just stop.

1400
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:26,640
I did it. I quit it.
Everything. Tonight.

1401
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:29,176
I was on stage
and I just walked away,

1402
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:31,778
because it's not what I want.
I want you.

1403
01:42:32,979 --> 01:42:36,316
- You had your chance, Jed.
- Rose.

1404
01:42:45,984 --> 01:42:48,929
- It's really good, Rose.
- Oh, good, good. Thank you.

1405
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:50,797
That's our Syrah.
It's from '95.

1406
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,933
'95 was one
of our best years, so...

1407
01:42:52,966 --> 01:42:55,169
Is that who I think it is?

1408
01:43:05,545 --> 01:43:07,614
Jed, get off the stage.

1409
01:43:07,647 --> 01:43:09,316
Rose, I wanna play you a song.

1410
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,618
All right? I've wanted
to play it so much.

1411
01:43:11,651 --> 01:43:13,587
I never can.
It makes me think of you.

1412
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,956
I've heard it.
Everyone has.

1413
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:19,426
