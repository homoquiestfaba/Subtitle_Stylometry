1
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,363
Don't go to sleep.
He's waiting for you.

2
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:55,701
Don't go to sleep.

3
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:10,256
Hey! What's going on?

4
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,078
Oh, man.

5
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:16,271
-Well?
-He's here.

6
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,453
Who's here?

7
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,911
He came out of the closet.

8
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:23,859
Tim, nobody's here.
What are you talking about?

9
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:28,815
Him.

10
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:32,943
Okay.

11
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:38,929
Tim.

12
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:41,714
It's just a story. Okay? He's not real.

13
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,690
Well, let's have a look around, then,
shall we?

14
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,903
No.

15
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,034
Nothing back here.

16
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:08,618
Okay.

17
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:13,134
Hello.

18
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,444
Nope.

19
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,030
Nobody home.

20
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,656
Just us.

21
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:47,339
No!

22
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,774
This is gonna get ugly.

23
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,559
No more vodka.

24
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:27,013
Hey, Tim. Let me have
one of those green things.

25
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:31,878
Careful. No more for Pam.

26
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:34,728
Hey. It's my party.

27
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:36,486
You still on for this weekend?

28
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:39,075
No, thought I'd wrangle up
a dinner invitation...

29
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:42,659
...from one of those art-department
girls. Like this one right here.

30
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,585
-Here you go.
-Oh, hey, thank you.

31
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:45,926
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:49,987
Hey, Scotty, did Tim tell you about
meeting my parents tomorrow?

33
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:51,912
Meeting the folks? Sounds serious.

34
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:54,978
Yeah, if he can survive the weekend
with Jessica's father.

35
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:58,083
Oh, come on. Dad's not that bad.
Don't listen to that.

36
00:05:58,252 --> 00:06:01,121
-He tried to drown you.
-You shouldn't have told her.

37
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,266
I was 7.
He was teaching me to swim.

38
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,930
By throwing you in a lake?

39
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,718
You know, this might be
a good time for a toast.

40
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,706
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I'd say.

41
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,525
Excuse me, everyone.

42
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:13,992
When we come back
from Thanksgiving on Monday...

43
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,846
...things will be a lot different.

44
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,352
For starters...

45
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,686
...it'll be a lot quieter.

46
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,954
But it definitely won't be as much fun.

47
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:24,517
The Daily News is lucky to get you.

48
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:26,504
Cheers.

49
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,158
Okay, break it up.

50
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:35,361
-Be good, Jess.
-I will.

51
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,219
I'm gonna miss you.

52
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:39,273
All of you.

53
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:41,956
I'm gonna miss you too.

54
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,302
So I told my parents I'd be there by 11.

55
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,480
All right, I'll get your coat.

56
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:50,436
Thank you.

57
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,072
Hey.

58
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,798
-Hey, Jess.
-Hey.

59
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,205
Not getting weird on me again,
are you?

60
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:30,235
No, no. I just spaced out for a second.

61
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,291
Okay.

62
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,246
Where's your car?

63
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:38,591
It wouldn't start.

64
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:41,091
-Is it gonna make it?
-I got a guy looking at it.

65
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,937
If you think you can use
the "car broke down" excuse...

66
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:47,449
-...to get out of this, you're mistaken.
-I'll be there, I promise.

67
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,082
Okay.

68
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:51,199
So you want a ride home?

69
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,146
No, I'm good. I'll cut through the park.

70
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,471
-Besides, I've seen your driving.
-Yeah, okay.

71
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:03,042
-Be careful.
-I'll be fine.

72
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:09,631
See you tomorrow.

73
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:56,696
I don't--
Who would have done this?

74
00:08:56,864 --> 00:08:58,270
Who would've taken...?

75
00:08:58,432 --> 00:09:00,635
Who would--?
Who would take him?

76
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,116
Why would they do this?
Where is he?

77
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:04,723
Tim, it's Uncle Mike.

78
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:08,721
I know you're having Thanksgiving
with your girlfriend and all...

79
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,884
...but it'd be nice if you could make it
out to see your mom this weekend.

80
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:17,207
She's not doing so well, and, you
know, it'd be good for her to see you.

81
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:22,869
And, hey, I got some stuff
for you to sign too, house stuff.

82
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:26,033
All right, hope I see you this weekend.

83
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:54,260
-Hey, you made it.
-Hey.

84
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:55,950
Hey.

85
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:59,764
-Were the directions okay?
-Perfect. Here.

86
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,105
-Come on.
-Wait, wait.

87
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,660
Shouldn't we wait for the bellhop
or something?

88
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:07,148
Shut up. It's their house, not mine.

89
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,725
What's with the tie?

90
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:11,439
I figured, meeting the family.
Why not, right?

91
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:15,054
Come on. Let's put your stuff
in the guestroom.

92
00:11:15,222 --> 00:11:18,221
So Jessica tells us you two met
at the magazine.

93
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:22,165
-Are you in the art department?
-I'm an associate editor.

94
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:25,424
-Sounds impressive.
-It's just a glorified fact-checker.

95
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,956
-Tim's very good at his job.
-How about family?

96
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:30,572
Got any family nearby?
Any brothers, sisters?

97
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,780
No, sir. No brothers or sisters,
just me.

98
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,218
-How about your folks?
-Let the boy eat.

99
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:37,268
-We're just talking, Mother.
-Dad.

100
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:40,656
The family thing's kind of
complicated, sir.

101
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:43,209
This stuffing is delicious, Chelsea.

102
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:46,348
Tim's had kind of a strained
relationship with his parents.

103
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:48,851
-Tim's father ran out when he was 8.
-Jess.

104
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:51,347
Oh, that's sad.

105
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:55,369
Then he had to go live with his uncle,
in a tiny room in the back of his bar.

106
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:58,381
Well, what about your mother?

107
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:04,366
She sort of had a tough time
after my dad left.

108
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,176
It was pretty hard on both of us.

109
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:14,252
Is there anything else
you wanted to know, Dad?

110
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:17,387
Be down in a minute, Mom.

111
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,401
You have fun down there?

112
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,959
Oh, come on. They could use
a little shaking up.

113
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,039
You see my sister's face
when I said...

114
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,664
...you lived in a tiny room
in the back of a bar?

115
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,873
It wasn't in the back of a bar,
you know.

116
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,488
I know. I just like messing with them.

117
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:36,138
Is that why you wanted me here,
to freak out your family?

118
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:38,410
No.

119
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,399
No.

120
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:42,895
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

121
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:44,300
Tell you what...

122
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:46,374
...I gotta go down, say good night...

123
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,966
...but I'll sneak in later
and make it up to you.

124
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:53,227
Okay?

125
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:57,451
In that case...

126
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:00,008
...l'll put on something naughty.

127
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:03,181
You do that.

128
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,447
I like this sneaking-around thing.

129
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:14,338
It's kind of dirty.

130
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,144
You all right?

131
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,266
Timmy.

132
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,339
You can't keep running away.

133
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,859
-Look at me.
-Mom?

134
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,639
Why, what's the matter with you?
Look at me!

135
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,331
Look at me.

136
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:36,094
Look at me.

137
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,811
You're a bad little boy.

138
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:45,211
Tim? Baby, what are you doing
on the floor?

139
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,350
Tim, what is it?

140
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:50,403
Jessica.

141
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:53,338
Oh, God, I had
the most messed-up dream.

142
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,005
What was it?

143
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,630
-I gotta go see my mom.
-Wait.

144
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,356
-There's something wrong.
-What?

145
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,824
-I know it.
-Tim. Tim, no. Hey.

146
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:04,802
-Listen, let's get back in bed, and....
-I just gotta--

147
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,385
-Where's my phone?
-Tim, what is wrong with you?.

148
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:09,310
-God.
-Where's my phone?

149
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:11,165
Just leave it.

150
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:14,267
Hello.

151
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,921
-Hey, Uncle Mike, I got your message.
-Hey.

152
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,425
Is everything okay?
I'm gonna see Mom tomorrow.

153
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:21,560
I thought you were here
for the weekend.

154
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:26,168
-What?
-Tim.

155
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:29,406
Okay.

156
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,015
Okay.

157
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,688
-Tim.
-I have to go.

158
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:41,947
-You--? Tim, what is it?
-Look, I just have to go.

159
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,436
So the funeral's today.

160
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,199
Yeah, this afternoon.

161
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,788
I'm so sorry, Tim.

162
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,485
Me too.

163
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:23,992
That's fantastic. That's really strong.

164
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:26,099
What's that you've got, Peter?

165
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:30,546
Oh, that rainbow is beautiful.
How many colors in there?

166
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,138
I'm thinking of going by
the old house.

167
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,009
-Really?
-My uncle's been fixing the place up...

168
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,897
...to sell since Mom went
to the hospital last year.

169
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,961
I felt like I should be the one
to go through her things.

170
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:49,905
I should've done more,
but it's something, right?

171
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:52,759
Listen to me, Tim.
Something happened in that house...

172
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,450
...but it wasn't supernatural.

173
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,172
There's nothing in there
but memories.

174
00:17:57,499 --> 00:18:01,589
You dealt with your father's leaving
the best way that you could.

175
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:03,315
But you were 8.

176
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,159
Tim, you've been coming here
for what, 15 years?

177
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,111
Look around you.

178
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:10,769
There's only children here.

179
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:15,446
Dr. Matheson to Observation.

180
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:18,163
I'm sorry. I have to go.

181
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,446
Go home, Tim.

182
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,396
Spend one night in that house.

183
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,285
It will help.

184
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:47,443
It's okay. It's okay.

185
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,706
Hey, we need some help in here!

186
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,294
Hey, the nurse is on the way.
It's okay, it's all right.

187
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,397
What? What is it?

188
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:25,264
Just relax now.
It's gonna be all right.

189
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,252
It's all right.

190
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:29,802
Everything's gonna be all right.

191
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:22,025
And in Paul's letter
to the Corinthians, he says:

192
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:24,462
"We shall not all fall asleep...

193
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,763
...but we will all be changed...

194
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,312
...in an instant, in the blink of an eye."

195
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,415
"When my tongue rejoices,
my body will rest in peace...

196
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:36,006
...because you will not abandon me
to the grave.

197
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:39,689
For you, O Lord, have delivered
my soul to death...

198
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:44,231
...my eyes from tears,
my feet from stumbling."

199
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,572
"Thou knowest the secrets...."

200
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:02,058
"....spare us.

201
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:04,361
Suffer us not in our last hour."

202
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,573
"Dust thou art...

203
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:10,760
...and unto dust thou shalt return."

204
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:14,443
Thanks for doing all this.

205
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,645
She was my sister.

206
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:19,914
When are you heading back?

207
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,623
Actually, I might stay in town tonight.
In the house.

208
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:27,430
-I thought you didn't like that house.
-Yeah, well.

209
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:31,045
Tim, the place is a mess. I've been
doing a whole lot of work there--

210
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:33,547
I won't mess anything up.

211
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,613
Is that Katie?

212
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:38,155
Yeah.

213
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,266
How long has it been?

214
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,403
-A long time.
-You should go and say hi.

215
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:44,579
No, I don't think so.

216
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:47,584
All right. Suit yourself.

217
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,696
Hey, come here.

218
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:57,546
Here you go. You might need these.

219
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:02,183
Thanks for everything.

220
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:04,256
It's good seeing you again, Tim.

221
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:39,913
Timmy.

222
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,656
You know, it's your cat,
and you're supposed to feed her.

223
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,118
Come on, Timmy, just turn
the light on. I'm not coming up there.

224
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,519
He's scared of his damn closet.

225
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:55,755
You know why he's so scared,
don't you?

226
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,746
-Why?
-Because you freaked him out...

227
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:59,695
...with that stupid story of yours.

228
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:01,963
You've gotta be kidding.
It was a story.

229
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:05,065
-My dad did the same thing to me.
-Look how you turned out.

230
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:08,550
-It was nothing, okay?
-He's got a very vivid imagination.

231
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:10,631
Mary, this is ridiculous. I was just--

232
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,223
You're gonna put that boy
in therapy.

233
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:14,954
-Just calm down, okay?
-Timmy.

234
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,307
Cody. Cody.

235
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:11,364
Kate!

236
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:21,799
Kate!

237
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:24,488
-Cody.
-Are you all right?

238
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:26,339
Yeah.

239
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:29,439
I think I just hit my head.

240
00:30:30,473 --> 00:30:32,512
He's never done that before.

241
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:36,195
Do you wanna come in,
put some ice on that?

242
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:38,373
Sure.

243
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:49,318
I saw you at the funeral.

244
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,551
I wasn't sure you'd remember me.

245
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:56,063
I'm real sorry about your mom.

246
00:30:58,055 --> 00:30:59,680
Yeah, me too.

247
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:08,158
-How about that ice?
-Yeah.

248
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:11,329
-Sorry.
-What are you trying to do?

249
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,501
-I'm sorry.
-I'm in pain.

250
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:18,019
So....

251
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,737
So....

252
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:22,559
So how's the city?

253
00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:25,019
It's all right.

254
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,577
It's been a little crazy lately, but....

255
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,470
You got a girlfriend?

256
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,692
Actually, yeah. Yeah, I do.

257
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,793
How about you?

258
00:31:41,924 --> 00:31:45,120
-Do I have a girlfriend?
-No.

259
00:31:45,284 --> 00:31:47,738
-No, I don't.
-You know what I mean.

260
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,762
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

261
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:53,212
Just me and my dad.

262
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:56,793
I'm sure some shrink could have
a field day with that.

263
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,304
So how long are you staying around?

264
00:32:01,474 --> 00:32:02,968
I think just tonight.

265
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:06,650
I wanted to go through my mom's
things, you know, pictures and stuff.

266
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:09,568
-I found a goofy one of you and me.
-Goofy?

267
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,031
-I don't remember being goofy.
-I'll show you.

268
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:15,903
-It's actually kind of cute.
-No, I don't think. Cute, I believe.

269
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:19,485
Goofy, that's crazy talk.

270
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,366
I mean, if you said you saw
a picture that--

271
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:27,318
You know, that was stunning
or, you know, gorgeous...

272
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:31,547
...okay, you know, I've heard that
a thousand times.

273
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:33,687
He took Dad, and now he's gonna
take me.

274
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:39,158
Timmy, nobody took your dad.
Okay?

275
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,149
Did you find it?

276
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,853
What?

277
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:47,771
Goofy photo?

278
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,942
Here.

279
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:55,579
Look at us. Even you're adorable.

280
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:57,237
Thanks.

281
00:32:57,406 --> 00:32:59,740
You know, I was crushed
when you left.

282
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:02,621
It broke my little heart.

283
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:05,914
And it broke my heart
you couldn't throw a baseball.

284
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,374
You were the one
that was scared of closets.

285
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,705
-I told you that?
-Yeah.

286
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,560
I told you closets were nothing.

287
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:17,237
It's the thing under the bed
you had to be worried about.

288
00:33:17,406 --> 00:33:20,853
All right, I have to go home
and start Dad's dinner.

289
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:27,061
I bet you don't have any food
in the house, do you?

290
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:29,595
-I'll come back with some.
-You don't have to.

291
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,052
I know. It's frightening how
domestic I've become, though.

292
00:33:36,156 --> 00:33:37,530
Bye.

293
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:35,682
Hello.

294
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:45,951
Hello.

295
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,071
Hey.

296
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:01,663
You all right?

297
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:11,231
Wanna come out?

298
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,094
What were you doing in there?

299
00:38:40,615 --> 00:38:42,949
You were at my mother's funeral,
weren't you?

300
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:45,605
My dad knew her.

301
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:48,805
What's your name?

302
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:50,939
Franny.

303
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,135
So, Franny, wanna tell me why you're
following me around?

304
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,201
I wanted to talk to you.

305
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,913
I wanted to ask you something.

306
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:04,996
All right.

307
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,656
Wanna ask me now?

308
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:18,555
Is it true?

309
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,606
Is what true?

310
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,836
The Boogeyman took your dad.

311
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:35,640
Look, I don't know where you
heard that, but it's just a story.

312
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,445
There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman.

313
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:48,062
I was trying to make sense of things.

314
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,544
My dad left. I was upset.
That's all that happened. Okay?

315
00:39:56,898 --> 00:40:00,727
It's late. Your parents will worry.
Where do you live? I'll give you a ride.

316
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,556
Next to the park.

317
00:40:03,426 --> 00:40:05,662
It's all right. I've got my own ride.

318
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:11,930
Hey, Franny.

319
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,045
Count to five.

320
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:18,742
When you're afraid,
close your eyes and count to five.

321
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:22,428
Sometimes it works for me.

322
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:25,695
What happens when you get to six?

323
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,739
-You gotta be brave. Come on, Tim.
-No, Dad.

324
00:41:08,797 --> 00:41:10,804
Dad. Let me out.

325
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:14,136
Tim, stop it. Okay? There is nothing
in there. Just trust me.

326
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:17,202
Trust me. There is nothing in there.

327
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:21,658
-"Just count to five like I told you."
-Count to five like I told you, okay?

328
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,088
He's here. He's here.

329
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:32,723
One. Two. Three.

330
00:41:32,892 --> 00:41:36,437
-Good boy.
-Four. Five.

331
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:46,096
He's here. He's here.

332
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:41,770
Tim. Where--?
Where are you going?

333
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:44,107
-We have to go.
-What happened to your face?

334
00:44:44,271 --> 00:44:46,605
-Please. We have to go.
-I called your uncle.

335
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,188
-I am so sorry about--
-I want to go now.

336
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,660
Look, I'm sorry for losing it back there.
I just needed to get out of that house.

337
00:45:03,213 --> 00:45:05,220
Hey, it's okay.

338
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:10,341
It's-- It's really late.

339
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:16,135
Maybe we should stop somewhere
and get some rest, you know?

340
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,275
How are you doing?

341
00:46:04,522 --> 00:46:09,377
Tim, come on. I drove two and
a half hours to be with you.

342
00:46:16,713 --> 00:46:18,949
I can't do this anymore, okay?

343
00:46:20,008 --> 00:46:22,975
It's too much, and I'm too tired.

344
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:33,500
Look, can't we just forget
all about the bad stuff...

345
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:36,255
...just for one night?

346
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:39,203
Just try to have some fun?

347
00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:45,250
Pretend that nothing else is out there.

348
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,597
Listen, why don't you go grab
some ice.

349
00:46:54,759 --> 00:46:56,733
I'll get the bath ready.

350
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,735
We can raid the minibar
and have our own little...

351
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,869
..."forget about the world" party.

352
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:06,971
Okay?

353
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:12,091
-All right.
-Good.

354
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,605
Good.

355
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,547
Hey, Tim.

356
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:12,416
Hello.

357
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:15,350
Anybody home?

358
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:18,103
Tim.

359
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:22,175
Hello.

360
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:48,125
Brought you some food.

361
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,540
I'm coming up.

362
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:12,534
Are you decent?

363
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:48,054
Nice lighting.

364
00:49:52,154 --> 00:49:54,063
Tim. Hello.

365
00:49:54,234 --> 00:49:56,405
I'll make us a vodka Red Bull.

366
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,440
Tim.

367
00:50:04,953 --> 00:50:07,341
I might have made these a little strong.

368
00:50:07,513 --> 00:50:11,407
Listen, Jess. I just wanna thank you
for putting up with me.

369
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:21,684
Jessica?

370
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:30,002
Jessica?

371
00:50:44,598 --> 00:50:46,256
Jessica?

372
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,630
Jessica?

373
00:50:50,582 --> 00:50:52,850
Jessica?

374
00:51:14,837 --> 00:51:17,422
Come on, Tim. This isn't funny.

375
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:22,405
How long were you
waiting in there?

376
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,252
You scared the crap out of me.

377
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,431
Come on, I made you some food.
Come on.

378
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:35,723
How did l--? Where's Jessica?

379
00:52:37,135 --> 00:52:39,818
-Who's Jessica?
-We went to the hotel.

380
00:52:39,983 --> 00:52:44,139
-The motel. And then--
-What are you talking about?

381
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:49,294
-I have to go.
-Tim. Tim.

382
00:52:49,998 --> 00:52:52,364
-What the hell is going on?
-Come with me.

383
00:52:52,526 --> 00:52:54,216
I need you to see what I see.

384
00:52:55,182 --> 00:52:59,207
-What's wrong? Where are we going?
-I don't know. I don't know anything.

385
00:52:59,374 --> 00:53:02,886
I don't know where I've been
or what I've done. I just don't know.

386
00:53:09,901 --> 00:53:12,617
-Oh, God.
-What?

387
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:17,062
That's it. That's the motel.

388
00:53:37,836 --> 00:53:40,072
What are we doing here?

389
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,717
Maybe you should go to the front desk
and ask if....

390
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:54,526
Jessica?

391
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:05,242
I was here.

392
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:19,714
What happened, Tim?

393
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:29,213
We were here.

394
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:40,062
I don't know. I went to get ice,
and I came back to--

395
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:55,325
-He took her.
-What? Who took her?

396
00:55:57,474 --> 00:55:59,578
You won't believe me.

397
00:56:04,993 --> 00:56:07,480
Where did the blood
come from, Tim?

398
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:12,477
Who do you think took your friend?

399
00:56:18,784 --> 00:56:20,922
Tim, if something happened....

400
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,040
-lf you accidentally did something--
-I didn't hurt Jessica.

401
00:56:27,776 --> 00:56:29,531
Are you sure?

402
00:56:33,087 --> 00:56:35,956
Everybody told me I was
making it up.

403
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:42,581
For 15 years. Ever since my dad left,
telling me over and over.

404
00:56:46,142 --> 00:56:48,116
But I was right.

405
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:53,394
I don't wanna be, but I am.

406
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,526
Tim.

407
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:02,226
Tim.

408
00:57:20,444 --> 00:57:22,199
Good night, Tim.

409
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:48,341
Kate! Kate, please open the door!

410
00:57:49,914 --> 00:57:53,874
-Kate! Kate. Come out.
-Go home. Get off the porch.

411
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,829
-Listen to me.
-You need to get out.

412
00:57:56,154 --> 00:57:58,063
Don't grab me.

413
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:02,262
-He's in your house.
-My dad is in my house.

414
00:58:02,426 --> 00:58:04,978
He's upstairs, probably
waiting up for me.

415
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:07,503
Tim...

416
00:58:08,313 --> 00:58:10,898
...I think maybe you're sick.

417
00:58:11,641 --> 00:58:15,153
And I wish I could help you,
but I can't.

418
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,221
Now, if you don't go home,
I'm calling the police.

419
00:58:18,392 --> 00:58:21,108
It wasn't your dad. I saw him.

420
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:23,728
I'm going inside now.

421
00:58:24,632 --> 00:58:26,192
Go home.

422
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,270
You need help, Tim.

423
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,431
Couldn't sleep either?

424
00:59:21,716 --> 00:59:25,261
I was looking for you.
You said you lived by the park.

425
00:59:26,644 --> 00:59:31,018
Sometimes when I think he's
in my house, I come out here.

426
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:33,740
Sometimes all night,
until the sun comes up.

427
00:59:34,451 --> 00:59:36,589
And everything's okay again.

428
00:59:38,195 --> 00:59:40,431
What if your parents come
to check in on you?

429
00:59:40,594 --> 00:59:42,503
I won't be there.

430
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,038
I told you a lie.

431
00:59:53,585 --> 00:59:56,880
The story about the night
my father disappeared.

432
00:59:57,042 --> 00:59:58,503
I know.

433
01:00:10,033 --> 01:00:11,821
He took my dad.

434
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:17,069
Tonight he took a friend of mine.

435
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:22,317
He's gonna keep taking people.

436
01:00:22,479 --> 01:00:24,366
Everyone who means
something to me.

437
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:28,746
I need your help.

438
01:00:32,015 --> 01:00:33,291
Why?

439
01:00:34,383 --> 01:00:36,968
Because we're the only ones
who believe.

440
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,374
I have to go home.

441
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:02,278
-Hello?
-It's Kate Houghton.

442
01:01:02,445 --> 01:01:07,495
Listen, I was just with Tim...

443
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:12,131
...and I'm worried about him.
He's acting kind of....

444
01:01:12,941 --> 01:01:18,177
Could you go over there
and just check in on him?

445
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:21,866
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

446
01:01:25,387 --> 01:01:28,834
Dad? Is that you?

447
01:01:32,907 --> 01:01:35,776
Franny. Franny.

448
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:41,545
I opened your pack.
I saw your pictures and the articles.

449
01:01:41,706 --> 01:01:44,837
-I just need to ask you something.
-Okay.

450
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:46,824
How do you stop him?

451
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,100
I'm not sure.

452
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:58,143
I know that house.

453
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,545
I've been here before. Come on.

454
01:03:06,213 --> 01:03:08,962
I used to come talk to the man
who lived here.

455
01:03:12,677 --> 01:03:14,978
Everyone said he was crazy.

456
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,871
He said his daughter was taken.

457
01:03:21,795 --> 01:03:23,485
What are all these words?

458
01:03:25,316 --> 01:03:26,876
I'm not sure.

459
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:31,291
He sealed up everything.

460
01:03:32,995 --> 01:03:34,882
All the closets and doors.

461
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,072
He was trying to understand it.

462
01:03:49,794 --> 01:03:51,932
Trying to give it a name.

463
01:04:21,536 --> 01:04:23,324
He sat here.

464
01:04:24,256 --> 01:04:25,597
Waiting.

465
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:33,431
I don't want to be here.

466
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:52,823
He didn't seal this one.
This was the door.

467
01:04:55,198 --> 01:04:56,986
He was trying to bring him out.

468
01:04:57,853 --> 01:04:59,162
Franny.

469
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:01,845
We have to go back to the house.

470
01:05:15,804 --> 01:05:17,396
My dad was trying to find me.

471
01:05:18,843 --> 01:05:20,730
Trying to beat it.

472
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,069
You have to go home.

473
01:05:26,235 --> 01:05:28,820
You have to go to the place
where it first started.

474
01:05:28,987 --> 01:05:30,961
That's where you face him.

475
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:32,857
My dad got too scared.

476
01:05:34,683 --> 01:05:36,308
He couldn't face him.

477
01:05:46,618 --> 01:05:48,406
I wanna help you.

478
01:05:51,737 --> 01:05:54,551
You can't.
You can only help yourself.

479
01:06:17,112 --> 01:06:18,672
Tim.

480
01:06:22,648 --> 01:06:24,557
Hey, Tim.

481
01:06:25,624 --> 01:06:27,631
You okay, buddy?

482
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:29,740
Kate called.

483
01:06:29,911 --> 01:06:32,496
Said things are getting
a little loose around here.

484
01:07:02,805 --> 01:07:04,397
Uncle Mike?

485
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,536
Uncle Mike?

486
01:07:08,884 --> 01:07:10,639
Uncle Mike!

487
01:07:13,812 --> 01:07:15,721
Hey, Mike!

488
01:07:20,276 --> 01:07:21,868
He took him.

489
01:10:17,864 --> 01:10:20,002
He's waiting for you.

490
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:12,632
Tim, what are you doing?
Get in here.

491
01:11:12,804 --> 01:11:14,527
Jessica?

492
01:12:12,864 --> 01:12:14,587
Jessica.

493
01:12:50,462 --> 01:12:52,600
Jessica?

494
01:12:53,565 --> 01:12:55,026
Tim?

495
01:12:55,549 --> 01:13:00,087
Mike. Uncle Mike, it's me.
What are you doing?

496
01:13:24,955 --> 01:13:27,475
Mike, Mike, I'm here.

497
01:13:29,626 --> 01:13:33,237
Can you hear me?
All right, all right, he's gone.

498
01:13:33,403 --> 01:13:35,769
I'm gonna save you. Come on!

499
01:13:38,363 --> 01:13:39,639
All right, hold on.

500
01:13:41,914 --> 01:13:44,532
I'm gonna cut you out, okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

501
01:14:01,464 --> 01:14:03,373
--check in on him?

502
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,269
Thanks.

503
01:14:05,689 --> 01:14:07,477
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

504
01:14:10,392 --> 01:14:12,846
Dad? Is that you?

505
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:31,057
What was that? What was that?

506
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:38,257
I have to stop this.
I have to go after him.

507
01:14:38,422 --> 01:14:42,415
He's leading me somewhere. If I'm not
around, he won't bother you, okay?

508
01:14:45,078 --> 01:14:46,866
Tim.

509
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:01,235
I don't understand.

510
01:15:01,813 --> 01:15:03,503
Tim!

511
01:15:08,532 --> 01:15:10,800
Help! Come on, come on!

512
01:15:11,412 --> 01:15:13,550
Help! Get him off! No!

513
01:15:32,531 --> 01:15:34,025
I gotta get you out of here.

514
01:15:34,194 --> 01:15:37,161
-Kate, come on! Come on, go, go!
-What? What?

515
01:15:38,226 --> 01:15:41,389
What happened? Come on!

516
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:43,440
We gotta get out of here!

517
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:49,351
Come on! Come on, help me!
Come on, Tim!

518
01:16:02,928 --> 01:16:04,204
Oh, God.

519
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,492
Go to the place where
it first started.

520
01:16:11,664 --> 01:16:12,907
One.

521
01:16:13,744 --> 01:16:14,921
Two.

522
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:17,870
-Three.
-Dad.

523
01:16:18,672 --> 01:16:19,882
Four.

524
01:16:21,295 --> 01:16:23,661
-Five.
-My dad got too scared.

525
01:16:23,823 --> 01:16:25,349
You have to face him.

526
01:16:27,022 --> 01:16:28,363
Six.

527
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:37,091
Tim, is he gone?

528
01:16:41,421 --> 01:16:42,981
Tim?

529
01:16:52,621 --> 01:16:54,376
What are you doing?

530
01:17:31,594 --> 01:17:33,088
Come on!

531
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:49,629
Tim!

532
01:18:22,663 --> 01:18:24,451
He's gone.

533
01:19:11,396 --> 01:19:13,250
Is it over?

534
01:19:15,619 --> 01:19:17,080
Yeah.

535
01:19:18,627 --> 01:19:20,481
Yeah, it's over.

536
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:25,434
He's not coming back.

537
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,834
Mom?

538
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:03,654
Mom?

539
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:07,046
Could you close the closet door?
