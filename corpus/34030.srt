00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:33,500


178
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,400
( Yelling Over Engine Noise): 
 She's a goddamned liar--

179
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,400


180
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,400
Some nut case seeking 
 money or publicity.

181
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,400
God only knows why ,  like that 
 Russian babe ,  Anesthesia.

182
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,400
They're inbound!

183
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,400


184
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,400
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic 
 when she was 1 7 ,  right?

185
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,400
- That's right. 
 - If she had lived ,  she'd be over 1 00.

186
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,400
101 next month.

187
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,400
Okay ,  so she's a very old 
 goddamned liar.

188
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,400


189
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,400
Look ,  I've already done 
 the background on this woman

190
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,400
all the way back to the '20s 
 when she was working as an actress.

191
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,400
An actress! There's 
 your first clue ,  Sherlock.

192
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,400
Her name was Rose Dawson back then. 
 Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

193
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,400
They move to Cedar Rapids 
 and she punches out a couple of kids.

194
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,400
Now ,  Calvert's dead ,  and from what 
 I hear ,  Cedar Rapids is dead.

195
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,400
And everybody who 
 knows about the diamond

196
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,400
is supposed to be dead 
 or on this boat ,  but she knows.

197
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:41,400


198
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,400
Doesn't exactly 
 travel light ,  does she?

199
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,400


200
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,400
Mrs. Calvert ,  I'm Brock Lovett. 
 Welcome to the Keldysh.

201
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,400


202
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,400
Okay ,  let's get her 
 inside there.

203
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,400
- Hi ,  Ms. Calvert. 
 - Hi.

204
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,400
Welcome to the Keldysh.

205
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,400
Man: 
 Hey. Hey!

206
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,500


207
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,500
- ( Knocking) 
 - Rose: Yes?

208
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,400
- Are your staterooms all right? 
 - Rose: Oh , yes ,  very nice.

209
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,400
Have you met 
 my grand daughter Lizzie?

210
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,400
She takes care of me.

211
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,400
We met just 
 a few minutes ago.

212
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,400
Remember ,  Nana ,  up on deck?

213
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,400
There ,  that's nice.

214
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,400
Have to have my pictures 
 when I travel.

215
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,400
Can I get you anything? 
 Is there anything you'd like?

216
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,400


217
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,400
Yes.

218
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,400
I would like to see my drawing.

219
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:50,400


220
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,400
Brock: 
 Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone

221
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,400
that was called 
 the Blue Diamond of the Crown

222
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,400
which disappeared in 1 792

223
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,400
about the same time old Louis 
 lost everything from the neck up.

224
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,400
The theory goes that 
 the crown diamond was chopped ,  too

225
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,400
recut into a heart-like shape that 
 became known as "Heart of the Ocean."

226
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,400
Today it would be worth more 
 than the Hope Diamond.

227
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,400
It was a dreadful ,  heavy thing. 
 I only wore it this once.

228
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,400
Lizzie: 
 You actually think this is you ,  Nana?

229
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,400
It is me ,  dear. 
 Wasn't I a dish?

230
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,400


231
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,400
I tracked it down 
 through insurance records--

232
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,400
An old claim that was settled 
 under terms of absolute secrecy.

233
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,400


234
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,400
Can you tell me 
 who the claimant was ,  Rose?

235
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,400
I should imagine 
 someone named Hockley.

236
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,400
Brock: Nathan Hockley ,  that's right. 
 Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

237
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,400


238
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,400
Claim was for 
 a diamond necklace

239
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,400


240
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,400
his son Caledon 
 bought his fiancée--you

241
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,500
a week before 
 he sailed on Titanic.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,500
It was filed right 
 after the sinking

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,500
so the diamond had to have 
 gone down with the ship.

244
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,400


245
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,400
You see the date?

246
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,400
"April 1 4 ,  1 91 2."

247
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,400
Which means if your grandmother is 
 who she says she is

248
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,400
she was wearing the diamond 
 the day the Titanic sank.

249
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,400
And that makes you 
 my new best friend.

250
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,400
These are some of the things 
 we recovered from your stateroom.

251
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,400


252
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,400
This was mine.

253
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,400
How extraordinary!

254
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,400
And it looks the same as it did 
 the last time I saw it.

255
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,400


256
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,400
The reflection 
 has changed a bit.

257
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,400


258
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,400
( Gasps Quietly)

259
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:57,400


260
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,400
Are you ready to go 
 back to Titanic?

261
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,400


262
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,400
Lewis: Okay ,  here we go. She hits 
 the berg on the starboard side ,  right?

263
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,400
She kind of bumps along punching holes 
 like Morse code-- dit-dit-dit--

264
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,400
along the side ,  
 below the waterline.

265
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,400
Then the forward compartments 
 start to flood.

266
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,400
Now as the water level rises ,  it 
 spills over the watertight bulkheads

267
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,400
which unfortunately 
 don't go any higher than E deck.

268
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,400
So now as the bow goes down ,  
 the stern rises up

269
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,400
slow at first ,  then faster 
 and faster until finally

270
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,400
she's got her whole ass is sticking 
 up in the air and that's a big ass.

271
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,400
We're talking 
 20 , 000 ,  30 , 000 tons ,  okay?

272
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,400
And the hull's not designed to deal 
 with that pressure ,  so what happens?

273
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,500
She splits ,  
 right down to the keel

274
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,500


275
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,500
and the stern 
 falls back level.

276
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,500
Then as the bow sinks ,  it pulls the 
 stern vertical and finally detaches.

277
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,400
Now ,  the stern section just 
 kind of bobs there like a cork

278
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,400
for a couple of minutes ,  floods and 
 finally goes under about 2:20 a.m.

279
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,400
two hours and 40 minutes 
 after the collision.

280
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,400
The bow section planes away 
 landing about a half a mile away

281
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,400
going 20 ,  30 knots when 
 it hits the ocean floor.

282
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,400
( imitates Crashing)

283
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,400
Pretty cool ,  huh?

284
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,400
Thank you for that fine 
 forensic analysis ,  Mr. Bodine.

285
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,400
Of course ,  
 the experience of it was

286
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,400
somewhat different.

287
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,400
Will you share it with us?

288
00:19:30,900 --> 00:20:11,400


289
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,400
( Music Playing)

290
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:22,400


291
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,400
( Crying)

292
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,400
- I'm taking her to rest. 
 - No.

293
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,500
- Come on ,  Nana. 
 - No!

294
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,500


295
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,500
Tape recorder.

296
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,500


297
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,400
Tell us ,  Rose.

298
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,400


299
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,400
It's been 84 years.

300
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,400
It's okay. Just try to remember 
 anything-- anything at all.

301
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,400
Do you want to hear this 
 or not ,  Mr. Lovett?

302
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,400


303
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,400
It's been 84 years...

304
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,400
and I can still smell 
 the fresh paint.

305
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,400


306
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,400
The china had never been used.

307
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,400
The sheets had never 
 been slept in.

308
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,400


309
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,400
Titanic was called 
 "The Ship of Dreams"

310
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,400
and it was ,  it really was.

311
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:52,400


312
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,400
Man: All third-class passengers

00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,400


315
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,400
- Right here.  - Big boat ,  huh? 

316
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,400
- Daddy ,  it's a ship. 
 - You're right.

317
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,400
( Car Horn Tooting)

318
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:34,400


319
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,400
I don't see what 
 all the fuss is about.

320
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,400
It doesn't look any bigger 
 than the Mauritania.

321
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,400
You can be blasé about some things ,  
 Rose ,  but not about Titanic.

322
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,400
It's over 1 00 feet longer than 
 Mauritania and far more luxurious.

323
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,400
Your daughter is far too difficult 
 to impress ,  Ruth.

324
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,400
So this is the ship 
 they say is unsinkable.

325
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,400
It is unsinkable. 
 God Him self could not sink this ship.

326
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,400
Sir ,  you have to check 
 your baggage through the main terminal.

327
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,400
- It's round that way ,  sir. 
 - I put my faith in you ,  good sir.

328
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,400
- Now ,  kindly see my man. 
 - Yes ,  sir ,  my pleasure ,  sir.

329
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,400
- If I can do anything at all. 
 - Oh ,  yes ,  right.

334
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,400
better hurry.

Welcome aboard ,  ma'am. 
 Welcome to Titanic.

Rose: It was the Ship of Dreams 
 to everyone else.

343
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,400
To me it was a slave ship

344

taking me back to America 
 in chains.

345

 a well-brought-up girl should be.

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,400
Fabrizio: 
 The ship is nice ,  huh?

528
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,400
- Yeah ,  it's an Irish ship. 
 - Is English ,  no?

529
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,400
No ,  it was built in Ireland. 
 15 , 000 Irishmen built this ship.

530
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,400
Solid as a rock. 
 Big Irish hands.

531
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,400
That's typical. First-class dogs 
 come down here to take a shit.

532
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,400
Uh ,  it lets us know where we rank 
 in the scheme of things.

533
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,400
Like we could forget?

534
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,400
- I'm Tommy Ryan. 
 -Jack Dawson.

535
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,400
- Hello. 
 - Fabrizio.

536
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,400
Hi. Do you make any money 
 with your drawings?

537
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:15,400


538
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,400
Oh ,  forget it ,  boyo. You'd as like 
 have angels fly out your ass

539
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,400
as get next 
 to the likes of her.

540
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:34,400


541
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,400
( Laughs)

542
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,400


543
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,400
- Do you mind? 
 - I hope you're proud of this.

544
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,400


545
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,500
I saw my whole life 
 as if I'd already lived it--

546
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,500
an endless parade 
 of parties and cotillions

547
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,500


548
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,500
yachts and polo matches

549
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,500
always the same narrow people ,  
 the same mind less chatter.

550
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,500
I felt like I was standing 
 at a great precipice

551
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,400
with no one to pull me back

552
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,400


553
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,400
no one who cared 
 or even noticed.

554
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,400


555
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,400
- ( Woman Grunts) 
 - ( Rose Sobbing)

556
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:43,400


557
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,400
( Running Feet And Sobbing)

558
00:37:46,900 --> 00:38:59,400


559
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,400
( Taking Short ,  
 Anxious Breaths)

560
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,400
Don't do it.

561
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,400
Stay back.

562
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,400


563
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,400
Don't come any closer.

564
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,400
Come on. Just give me your hand. 
 I'll pull you back over.

565
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,400
No! Stay where you are. 
 I mean it.

566
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,400
I'll let go.

567
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:29,400


568
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,400
No ,  you won't.

569
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,400
What do you mean ,  no ,  I won't?

570
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,400
Don't presume to tell me what I will 
 and will not do. You don't know me.

571
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,400
Well ,  you would have 
 done it already.

572
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,400
You're distracting me. 
 Go away.

573
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,400
I can't. I'm involved now.

574
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,400
You let go and I'm going to have to 
 jump in there after you. 

575
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,400


576
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,400
Don't be absurd. 
 You'll be killed.

577
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,400
- I'm a good swimmer. 
 - The fall alone would kill you.

578
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,400


579
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,400
- It would hurt. 
 - I'm not saying it wouldn't.

580
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,400
To tell you the truth 
 I'm a lot more concerned

581
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,400
about that water being so cold.

582
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,400
( Shoe Drops To Deck)

583
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,400


584
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,400
- How cold? 
 - Freezing.

585
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,400
Maybe a couple degrees over.

586
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,400


587
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,500
You ever ,  uh...

588
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,500
ever been to Wisconsin?

589
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,500


590
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,500
What?

591
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,500
Well ,  they have some 
 of the coldest winters around.

592
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,500
I grew up there 
 near Chippewa Falls.

593
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,500
I remember when I was a kid ,  
 me and my father ,  we went ice fishing

594
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,500


595
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,500
out on Lake Wissota.

596
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,500


597
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,500
Ice fishing is ,  you know ,  
 where you--

598
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,400
( Angrily): 
 I know what ice fishing is!

599
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,400
Sorry.

600
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,400
You just seem like ,  you know ,  
 kind of an indoor girl.

601
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,400
Anyway ,  I ,  uh... 

602
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,400
I fell through some thin ice

603
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,400
and I'm telling you...

604
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,400
water that cold ,  
 like right down there

605
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,400
it hits you like a thousand knives 
 stabbing you all over your body.

606
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,400
You can't breathe ,  
 you can't think--

607
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,400


608
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,400
at least not about anything 
 but the pain.

609
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,400


610
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,400
Which is why I'm not looking forward 
 to jumping in there after you.

611
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,400
Like I said...

612
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,400
I don't have a choice.

613
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,400


614
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,400
I guess I'm kind of hoping 
 you'll come back over the rail

615
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,400
and get me off the hook here.

616
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,400
You're crazy.

617
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,400
That's what everybody says ,  
 but with all due respect ,  miss

618
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,400
I'm not the one hanging off 
 the back of a ship here.

619
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,400


620
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,400
Come on.

621
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,400
Come on ,  give me your hand. 
 You don't want to do this.

622
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:13,400


623
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,500
Whew!

624
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,500
I'm Jack Dawson.

625
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,500


626
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,500
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

627
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,500
I'm going to have to get you 
 to write that one down.

628
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,500


629
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,500
Come on.

630
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,500
- ( Screams) 
 - ( Grunting)

631
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,500
I got you! Come on.

632
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,500
Come on!

633
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,400


634
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,400
( Screams) 
 Help! Please!

635
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,400


636
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,400
Help! Please!

637
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,400


638
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,400
- Please get me! 
 - Listen. Listen to me.

639
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,400
I've got you. I won't let go. 
 Now pull yourself up. Come on.

640
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,400
( Grunts)

641
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,400
Come on. That's right.

642
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,400
You can do it.

643
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,400


644
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,400
I got you.

645
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,400


646
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,400
What's all this?

647
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,400


648
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,400
You stand back! 
 And don't move an inch!

649
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,400
- Fetch the master-at-arms! 
 - Care for a brandy?

650
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,400
Cal: This is completely unacceptable! 
 What made you think

651
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,400
that you could put your hands 
 on my fiancée?

652
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,400


653
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,400
- Look at me ,  you filth! 
 - Cal...

654
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,400
- What do you think you were doing? 
 - Cal ,  stop.

655
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,400


656
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,400
- It was an accident. 
 - An accident?

657
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,400
It was. Stupid really.

658
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,400
I was leaning over ,  
 and I slipped.

659
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,400


660
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,400
I was leaning far over 
 to see the ,  uh...

661
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,400
uh... uh... 
 the ,  uh... uh...

662
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,400
- Propellers? 
 - propellers and I slipped.

663
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,500
And I would have gone overboard 
 but Mr. Dawson here saved me

664
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,500
and almost went over himself.

665
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,500
You wanted to see... 
 She wanted to see the propellers.

666
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,500
Like I said ,  
 women and machinery do not mix.

667
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,500
Was that the way of it?

668
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,500


669
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,500
Yeah. Yeah ,  
 that was pretty much it.

670
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,500
Well ,  the boy's a hero then. 
 Good for you ,  son. Well done.

671
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,500
So it's all's well 
 and back to our brandy ,  eh?

672
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,400
Look at you. You must be freezing. 
 Let's get you inside.

673
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,400
Perhaps a little something 
 for the boy.

674
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,400


675
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,400
Of course. Mr. Lovejoy ,  
 I think a 20 should do it.

676
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,400
Is that the going rate 
 for saving the woman you love?

677
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,400


678
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,400
Rose is displeased. 
 What to do?

679
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,400


680
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,400
I know.

681
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,400


682
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,400
Perhaps you could join us 
 for dinner tomorrow evening

683
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:03,400
to regale our group 
 with...your heroic tale.

684
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,400


685
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,400
Sure ,  count me in.

686
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,400
Good. Settled then.

687
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,400
This should be interesting. Mmm.

688
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,400


689
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,400

691
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,400
Can l ,  uh... bum a smoke?

692
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:33,400


693
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,400
You'll want to tie those.

694
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,400


695
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,400
It's interesting.

696
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,400
The young lady slips so suddenly 
 and you still had time

697
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,400
to remove your jacket 
 and your shoes.

698
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:50,400

00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,500


702
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,500
I know you've been melancholy.

703
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,500
I don't pretend to know why.

704
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,500


705
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,500
I intended to save this

706
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,500
until the engagement gala

707
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,500
next week.

708
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,400
But I thought tonight.

709
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,400


710
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,400
Good gracious.

711
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,400
Perhaps as a reminder 
 of my feelings for you.

712
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,400
- Is it a... 
 - Diamond? Yes.

713
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,400


714
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,400
56 carats to be exact.

715
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,400


716
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,400
It was worn by Louis XVI

717
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,400
and they called it 
 "Le Coeur De La Mer. "

718
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,400
Both: 
 The Heart of the Ocean.

719
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,400
Yes.

720
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,400


721
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,400
It's overwhelming.

722
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,400
Well ,  it's for royalty.

723
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,400
We are royalty ,  Rose.

724
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,400


725
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,400
You know ,  there's nothing 
 I couldn't give you.

726
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,400
There's nothing I'd deny you

727
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,400
if you would not deny me.

728
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,400


729
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,400
Now open your heart 
 to me ,  Rose.

730
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:32,400


731
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,400
Jack: Well ,  I've been on my own since 
 I was 1 5 since my folks died.

732
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,400


733
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,500
And I had no 
 brothers or sisters

734
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,500
or close kin in that part 
 of the country.

735
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,500
So I lit on out of there 
 and I haven't been back since.

736
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,500
You could just call me 
 a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

737
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,500


738
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Well ,  Rose...

739
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,500
we've walked about a mile 
 around this boat deck

740
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,500
and chewed over how great 
 the weather's been and how I grew up

741
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,500
but I reckon that's not why 
 you came to talk to me ,  is it?

742
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,500


743
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,500
- Mr. Dawson ,  l-- 
 -Jack.

744
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,400
Jack...

745
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,400
I want to thank you 
 for what you did.

746
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,400
Not just for... for pulling me back 
 but for your discretion.

747
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,400


748
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,400
You're welcome.

749
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,400
Look ,  I know 
 what you must be thinking.

750
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,400
Poor little rich girl. 
 What does she know about misery?

751
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,400
No. No ,  that's not what 
 I was thinking.

752
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,400


753
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,400
What I was thinking was 
 what could have happened to this girl

754
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,400
to make her think 
 she had no way out?

755
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,400


756
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,400
Well ,  l--

757
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,400
It was everything.

758
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,400
It was my whole world 
 and all the people in it

759
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,400
and the inertia of my life 
 plunging ahead

760
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,400
and me ,  powerless to stop it.

761
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,400
God! Look at that thing.

762
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,400
You would have gone 
 straight to the bottom.

763
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,400


764
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,400
500 invitations have gone out.

765
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,400
All of Philadelphia society 
 will be there

766
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,400
and all the while 
 I feel I'm...

767
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,400
standing in the middle 
 of a crowded room

768
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,400
screaming at the top of my lungs 
 and no one even looks up.

769
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,400


770
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,400
Do you love him?

771
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,400
- Pardon me? 
 - Do you love him?

772
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,400
You're being very rude. 
 You shouldn't be asking me this.

773
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,400
Well ,  it's a simple question. 
 Do you love the guy or not?

774
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,500


775
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,500
This is not 
 a suitable conversation.

776
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,500
-Why can't you just answer the question? 
 -( Nervous Laughter)

777
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,500
This is absurd. You don't know me ,  
 and I don't know you

778
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,500
and we are not having 
 this conversation at all.

779
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,500
You are rude and uncouth 
 and presumptuous and I am leaving now.

780
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,500


781
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,500
Jack. Mr. Dawson ,  
 it's been a pleasure.

782
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,500
I sought you out to thank you 
 and now I have thanked you...

783
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,500
- And you've insulted me. 
 - Well ,  you deserved it.

784
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,500
- Right. 
 - Right.

785
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,400


786
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,400
- I thought you were leaving. 
 - I am.

787
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,400


788
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,400
You are so annoying.

789
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,400
- ( Chuckles) 
 - Wait.

790
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,400
I don't have to leave. 
 This is my part of the ship. You leave.

791
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,400
Oh-ho-ho ,  
 well ,  well ,  well.

792
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,400
Now who's being rude?

793
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,400


794
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,400
What is this stupid thing 
 you're carrying around?

795
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,400


796
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,400
So what are you ,  
 an artist or something?

797
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,400


798
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,400
Well ,  these are rather good.

799
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,400


800
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,400
They're ,  uh-- 
 They're very good actually.

801
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,400


802
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,400
Jack ,  this is exquisite work.

803
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,400
They didn't think too much 
 of them in old Paree.

804
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,400
Paris! You do get around 
 for a poor--

805
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,400


806
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,400
Well ,  uh ,  uh ,  a person 
 of limited means.

807
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,400
Go on ,  a poor guy ,  
 you can say it.

808
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,400


809
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,400
Well ,  well ,  well.

810
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,400


811
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,400
And these were drawn from life?

812
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,400


813
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,500
Well ,  that's one 
 of the good things about Paris--

814
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,500


815
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,500
Lots of girls willing 
 to take their clothes off.

816
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,500


817
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,500
You liked this woman.

818
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,500
You used her several times.

819
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,500
Well ,  she had beautiful hands ,  
 you see?

820
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,500


821
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,500
I think you must have had 
 a love affair with her.

822
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,500
No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no. 
 Just with her hands.

823
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,400


824
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,400
She was a one-legged prostitute.

825
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,400
See?

826
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,400


827
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,400
- ( Aghast): Oh! 
 - ( Both Chuckle)

828
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,400
Ah ,  she had a good sense 
 of humor ,  though.

829
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,400


830
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,400
Oh ,  and this lady...

831
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,400
she used to sit 
 at this bar every night

832
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,400


833
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,400
wearing every piece 
 of jewelry she owned

834
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,400
just waiting 
 for her long-lost love.

835
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,400


836
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,400
Called her Madame Bijou.

837
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,400
See how her clothes 
 are all moth-eaten?

838
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,400
Well ,  you have a gift ,  Jack.

839
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,400
You do. You see people.

840
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,400
I see you.

841
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,400


842
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,400
And?

843
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,400
You wouldn't have jumped.

844
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,400


845
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,400
But the purpose of university 
 is to find a suitable husband.

846
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,400
Rose has already done that.

847
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,400
Look ,  here comes 
 that vulgar Brown woman.

848
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,400
Quickly ,  get up 
 before she sits with us.

849
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,400
Hello ,  girls. I was hoping 
 I'd catch you at tea.

850
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,400
We're awfully sorry 
 you missed it.

851
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,400
The countess and I were just off 
 to take the air on the boat deck.

852
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,400
What a lovely idea. 
 I need to catch up on my gossip.

853
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,400


854
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,500
Molly: 
 Countess.

855
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,500
So you've not yet 
 lit the last four boilers?

856
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,500
No ,  I don't see the need. 
 We are making excellent time.

857
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,500
The press knows 
 the size of Titanic.

858
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,500
Now I want them to marvel 
 at her speed.

859
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,500
We must give them 
 something new to print.

860
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,500


861
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,500
This maiden voyage of Titanic 
 must make headlines.

862
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,500
Mr. Ismay ,  I would prefer 
 not to push the engines

863
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,500
until they've been 
 properly run in.

864
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,400
Of course 
 I'm just a passenger.

865
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,400
I leave it to your good offices 
 to decide what's best.

866
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,400
But what a glorious end 
 to your final crossing

867
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,400
if we were to get into New York 
 on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

868
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,400
Make the morning papers. 
 Retire with a bang ,  eh ,  E.J.?

869
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,400


870
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,400
Good man.

871
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,400
Well ,  after that I worked on 
 a squid boat in Monterey.

872
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,400
Then I went down to Los Angeles 
 to the pier in Santa Monica

873
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,400
and started doing portraits there 
 for ten cents a piece.

874
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,400
Why can't I be like you ,  Jack-- 
 just head out for the horizon

875
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,400
whenever I feel like it?

876
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,400
Say we'll go there 
 sometime to that pier

877
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,400
even if we only 
 ever just talk about it.

878
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,400
No ,  we'll do it.

879
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,400
We'll drink cheap beer. We'll ride 
 on the roller coaster till we throw up.

880
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,400
Then we'll ride horses on the beach 
 right in the surf.

881
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,400
But you'll have to do it like a real 
 cowboy. None of that sidesaddle stuff.

882
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,400
- You mean ,  one leg on each side? 
 - Yeah.

883
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,400
- Can you show me? 
 - Sure... if you like.

884
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,400


885
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,400
- Teach me to ride like a man. 
 - And chew tobacco like a man.

886
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,400
And spit like a man.

887
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,400
They didn't teach you that 
 in finishing school?

888
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,500
- No. 
 - Well ,  come on ,  I'll show you.

889
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,500
Let's do it. 
 I'll show you how. Come on.

890
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,500
Jack ,  no! Jack ,  no!

891
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,500
Wait ,  Jack. No ,  Jack. 
 I couldn't possibly ,  Jack.

892
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,500
Watch closely.

893
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,500


894
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,500
- That's disgusting! 
 - All right ,  your turn.

895
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,500


896
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,500
That was pitiful!

897
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,500
Come on ,  you really got 
 to hawk it back ,  you know?

898
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,500
Get some leverage to it. 
 Use your arms ,  arc your neck.

900
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,500
- See the range on that thing? 
 - Mm-hmm.

 -Jack: Okay ,  go.

904
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,400
-That was better. You got to work on it. 
 -Really?

905
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,400
Really try and hawk it up 
 and get some body to it ,  you know?

906
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,400
You got to... 
 ( Snorting)

907

912
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,400
Charmed ,  I'm sure.

914
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,400
The others were gracious 
 and curious

915
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,400
about the man 
 who had saved my life

916
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,400
but m ymother looked at him 
 like an insect--

917
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,400
a dangerous insect 
 which must be squashed quickly.

918
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,400
Well ,  Jack ,  sounds like you're a good 
 man to have around in a sticky spot.

919

( Trumpet Playing Fanfare)

920
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,400
Why do they always insist on announcing 
 dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

921
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,400
- ( Laughs) 
 - Shall we go to dress ,  Mother?

922
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,400
See you at dinner ,  Jack.

923
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,400


924
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,400
Uh ,  son? Son!

925
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,400
Do you have the slightest comprehension 
 what you're doing?

926
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,400
Not really.

927
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,400
Well ,  you're about to go 
 into the snake pit.

928
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,500


929
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,500
What are you planning to wear?

930
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,500


931
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,500
I figured. Come on.

932
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500


933
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,500
I was right.

934
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,500
You and my son 
 are just about the same size.

935
00:56:57,500 --> 00:00:00,000
Pretty close.

936
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,500

Good evening.

945
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:16,400

 Hello.

948
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,400
Cal: Do you know that there are 
 several thousand tons

949
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,400
of Hockley steel 
 in this very ship?

950
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,400
- Ruth: Hmm. Which part? 
 - Cal: All the right ones ,  of course.

951
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,500
Then we'll know who to hold 
 accountable if there's a problem.

952
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,500
- Where's my daughter? 
 - Oh ,  she'll be along.

953
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,500
- There is the countess. 
 - Hello ,  my dear.

954
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,500
- Good evening ,  Cal. 
 - Cal: So good to see you.

955
00:58:40,000 --> 00:59:04,500


956
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,400
I saw that in a nickelodeon once 
 and I always wanted to do it.

 I'll see you at dinner.

961
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,400
Darling? Surely 
 you remember Mr. Dawson.

Dawson? 
 ( Chuckles)

963
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,400
Well ,  it's amazing. 
 You could almost pass for a gentleman.

964
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,400
- Almost. 
 - Extraordinary.

965

 My dear ,  it's delightful to see you.

967
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,400
What a remarkable 
 voyage this is.

968
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,400
- It's mad ,  isn't it? 
 - Ruth: I love your perfume.

969

There's the Countess of Rothes.

971
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:05,400
And ,  um ,  that's John Jacob Astor-- 
 the richest man on the ship.

972
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:10,400
His little wife there ,  Madeleine ,  
 is my age and in delicate condition.

973
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,400
See how she's 
 trying to hide it?

974
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,400
- Quite the scandal. 
 - Hmm.

975
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,400
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim 
 and his mistress Madame Aubert.

976
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,500
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home 
 with the children ,  of course.

977
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,500
And over here we have 
 Sir Cosmo and Lucille Lady Duff-Gordon.

She designs naughty lingerie ,  
 among her many talents.

Very popular with the royals.

Congratulations ,  Hockley. 
 She's splendid.

981
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,500
Why ,  thank you.

 - Certainly.

- Cal: Sweet pea. 
 - Ain't nothin' to it ,  is there ,  Jack?

985
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,500
Remember ,  they love money ,  so just 
 pretend like you own a gold mine...

986
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,500
and you're in the club.

987
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,500


988
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,400
- Hey ,  Astor! 
 - Well ,  hello ,  Molly. Nice to see you.

989
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,400
J.J. Madeleine ,  
 I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

990
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,400
- How Do you do? 
 - Pleasure.

991
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,400
Hello ,  Jack. 
 Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

992
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,400
No-- the Chippewa Falls Dawsons ,  
 actually.

993
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,400
Oh ,  yes. Yes.

994
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:13,400


995
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:18,400
He must have been nervous ,  
 but he never faltered.

996
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,400
They assumed 
 he was one of them--

997
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,400
Heir to a rail road fortune ,  
 perhaps.

998
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:29,400
New money ,  obviously ,  
 but still a member of the club.

999
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,400
Mother ,  of course ,  
 could always be counted upon.

1000
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,400
Tell us of the accommodations 
 in steerage ,  Mr. Dawson.

1001
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,400
I hear they're quite good 
 on this ship.

1002
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,400
The best I've seen ,  ma'am. 
 Hardly any rats.

1004
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,400
Mr. Dawson is joining us 
 from the third class.

1005
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,400
He was of some assistance 
 to my fiancée last night.

1006
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,400
It turns out that Mr. Dawson 
 is quite a fine artist.

1007
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,400
He was kind enough to show me 
 some of his work today.

1008
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,400
Rose and I differ somewhat 
 in our definition off art.

1009
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,400
Not to impugn your work ,  sir.

1010
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,400


1011
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,400
( Clears Throat)

1012
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,500


1013
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,500
Ismay: 
 She may be mine on paper

1014
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,500
but in the eyes of God ,  
 she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

1015
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,500
( Whispering): 
 Are these all for me?

1016
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,500
Just start from the outside 
 and work your way in.

1017
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,500
He knows every rivet 
 in her ,  don't you ,  Thomas?

1018
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,500
- Your ship is a wonder ,  truly. 
 - Thank you ,  Rose.

1019
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,500


1020
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,500
- And how Do you take your caviar ,  sir? 
 - No caviar for me ,  thanks.

1021
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,500
Never did like it much.

1022
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,500


1023
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,500
And where ,  exactly ,  
 Do you live ,  Mr. Dawson?

1024
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,500
Well ,  right now ,  my address 
 is the R.M.S. Titanic.

1025
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,500
After that ,  
 I'm on God's good humor.

1026
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,500


1027
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,500
And how is it 
 you have means to travel?

1028
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,400
I work my way 
 from place to place--

1029
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,400
You know ,  
 tramp steamers and such.

1030
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,400
But I won my ticket 
 on Titanic here

1031
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,400
at a lucky hand at poker.

1032
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,400
A very lucky hand.

1033
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,400
- All life is a game of luck. 
 - Mmm.

1034
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,400
A real man makes 
 his own luck ,  Archie.

1035
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,400
- Right ,  Dawson? 
 - Mmm.

1036
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,400
And you find that sort of 
 rootless existence appealing ,  Do you?

1037
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,400


1038
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,400
Well ,  yes ,  ma'am ,  I do.

1039
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,400
I mean ,  got everything I need 
 right here with me.

1040
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,400
Got air in my lungs 
 and a few blank sheets of paper.

1041
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:23,400
I mean ,  I love waking up in the morning 
 not knowing what's going to happen

1042
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,400
or who I'm going to meet ,  
 where I'm going to wind up.

1043
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,400
Just the other night ,  I was sleeping 
 under a bridge ,  and now here I am

1044
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,400
on the grandest ship in the world 
 having champagne with you fine people.

1045
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,400
- ( Laughter) 
 - I'll take some more of that.

1046
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,400
I figure life's a gift ,  
 and I don't intend on wasting it.

1047
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,400
You never know what hand 
 you're going to get dealt next.

1048
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,400
You learn to take life 
 as it comes at you. Here you go ,  Cal.

1049
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,400
To make each day count.

1050
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,400
- Well said ,  Jack. 
 - Hear ,  hear!

1051
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,400
To making it count.

1052
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,500


1053
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,500

No ,  I'm afraid I don't. 
 Now you're going to have to turn around.

1231
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,400
He'll tell you. 
 I just-- I just need--

1232
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,400
Mr. Hockley 
 and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater

1233
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,400
continue to be appreciative 
 of your assistance.

1234
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,400
They asked me to ,  uh... 
 give you this in gratitude.

1235
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,400
- I don't want your money. Please ,  l-- 
 - And also to remind you...

1236
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,400
that you hold 
 a third-class ticket

1237
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,400
and that your presence here 
 is no longer appropriate.

1238
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,400
Please ,  I just want 
 to speak to Rose for--

1239
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,400
Gentlemen ,  will you please see that 
 Mr. Dawson gets to where he belongs

1240
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,400
and that he stays there?

1241
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:04,400
Yes ,  sir. 
 Come along ,  you.

1242
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,400


1243
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,400
** Oh ,  hear us 
 when we cry to Thee **

1244
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:15,400
** For those in peril 
 on the sea. **

1245
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,400
Ruth: And why Do you have 
 two steering wheels?

1246
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,400
We really only use 
 this near shore.

1247
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,400
Excuse me ,  sir. Another ice warning. 
 This one's from the Noordam.

1248
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:23,400


1249
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,400
Thank you ,  Sparks.

1250
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:26,400


1251
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,400
Oh ,  not to worry. 
 Quite normal for this time of year.

1252
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,400
In fact ,  we're speeding up.

1253
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,400
I've just ordered 
 the last boilers lit.

1254
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,400


1255
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,500
Man: Okay ,  son ,  
 wind it up tight like I showed you.

1256
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,500
Okay ,  now ,  let it go.

1257
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,500


1258
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,500
- Was good ,  wasn't it? 
 - Quite nice.

1259
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,500
That's excellent ,  son.

1260
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,500


1261
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,500
Rose: 
 Mr. Andrews ,  forgive me...

1262
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,500
I did the sum in my head 
 and with the number of lifeboats

1263
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,500
times the capacity you mentioned

1264
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,500
forgive me ,  but it seems that there 
 are not enough for everyone aboard.

1265
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,500
About half ,  actually.

1266
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,500
Rose ,  you miss nothing ,  Do you? 
 In fact ,  I put in these new type davits

1267
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,500
which can take an extra row 
 of boats inside this one

1268
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,500


1269
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,500
but it was thought by some 
 that the deck would look too cluttered

1270
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,400
so I was overruled.

1271
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,400
Waste of deck space as it is 
 on an unsinkable ship.

1272
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:35,400
Sleep soundly ,  young Rose. I have built 
 you a good ship ,  strong and true.

1273
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,400
She's all the lifeboat you need.

1274
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:41,400
Just keep heading aft. 
 The next stop will be the engine room.

1275
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,400
Come on.

1276
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,400


1277
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:50,400
Jack ,  this is impossible. 
 I can't see you.

1278
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,400
- I need to talk to you. 
 - No ,  Jack ,  no.

1279
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,400
Jack ,  I'm engaged.

1280
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,400
I'm marrying Cal. 
 I love Cal.

1281
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,400


1282
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:08,400
Rose ,  you're no picnic.

1283
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:11,400
All right ,  you're a spoiled 
 little brat ,  even

1284
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:15,400
but under that you're the most 
 amazingly astounding

1285
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:16,400


1286
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,400
wonderful girl-- woman-- 
 that I've ever known and...

1287
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,400
-Jack ,  l... 
 - No ,  let me try and get this out.

1288
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,400
You're , you're ama--

1289
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,500
I'm not an idiot. 
 I know how the world works.

1290
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,500


1291
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,500
I've got ten bucks 
 in my pocket.

1292
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,500


1293
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,500
I have nothing to offer you 
 and I know that.

1294
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,500
I understand.

1295
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,500
But I'm too involved now. 
 You jump ,  I jump ,  remember?

1296
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,500
I can't turn away 
 without knowing you'll be all right.

1297
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,500
That's all that I want.

1298
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,500
Well ,  I'm fine.

1299
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,500
I'll be fine ,  really.

1300
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,500
Really?

1301
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,500


1302
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,500
I don't think so. 
 They've got you trapped ,  Rose

1303
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,500


1304
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,500
and you're going to die 
 if you don't break free--

1305
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,500
Maybe not right away 
 because you're strong ,  but

1306
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,500
sooner or later that fire 
 that I love about you ,  Rose...

1307
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,400
that fire is going to burn out.

1308
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:19,400


1309
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,400
It's not up to you 
 to save me , Jack.

1310
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,400


1311
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:28,400
You're right. 
 Only you can do that.

1312
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:34,400


1313
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,400
I'm going back. 
 Leave me alone.

1314
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:48,400


1315
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,400
Countess: Tell Lucille about the 
 disaster you had with the stationer's.

1316
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,400
Well ,  of course ,  the invitations 
 had to be sent back twice.

1317
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,400
- Oh ,  my dear! 
 - And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns--

1318
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,400
Let me tell you what an odyssey 
 that has been.

1319
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,400
Rose decided 
 she wanted lavender.

1320
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,400
She knows I detest the color ,  
 so she did it only to spite me.

1321
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,400
Lucille: 
 If only you'd come to me sooner.

1322
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,400
Ruth saw some of my designs 
 in "La Mode Illustree."

1323
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,400
They were for Trousseau of the Duchess 
 of Malborough's youngest daughter.

1324
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,500
Theyw ere quite charming ,  but I think 
 you'll agree ,  my dear ,  that together

1325
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,500
we've created something of a phoenix 
 from the ashes.

1326
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,500
( Women Laugh Politely)

1327
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:37,500


1328
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,500
Hello , Jack.

1329
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,500


1330
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,500
I changed my mind.

1331
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,500


1332
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,500
- They said you might be-- 
 - Shh.

1333
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,500


1334
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,500
Give me your hand.

1335
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:05,500


1336
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,400
Now close your eyes.

1337
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,400
Go on.

1338
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,400


1339
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,400
Step up.

1340
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,400


1341
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,400
Now hold on to the railing.

1342
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,400
- Keep your eyes closed ,  don't peek. 
 - I'm not.

1343
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:23,400


1344
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,400
Step up onto the rail.

1345
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,400


1346
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,400
Hold on. Hold on. 
 Keep your eyes closed.

1347
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,400
- ( Giggles) 
 - Do you trust me?

1348
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,400
I trust you.

1349
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:47,400


1350
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,400
All right ,  open your eyes.

1351
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:57,400


1352
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,400
I'm flying! Jack!

1353
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:24,400


1354
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,500
( Softly): 
 ** Come , Josephine ,  my flying machine **

1355
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,500
** Going up ,  she goes **

1356
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,500
** Up ,  she goes... **

1357
01:22:35,000 --> 01:23:21,500


1358
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:24,400
That was the last time Titanic 
 ever saw daylight.

1359
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:28,400
So we're up to dusk 
 the night of the sinking.

1360
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,400
- Six hours to go. 
 - Incredible.

1361
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,400
There's Smith and he's standing there 
 and he's got the iceberg warning...

1362
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:38,400
in his fucking hand-- excuse me-- 
 his hand ,  and he's ordering more speed.

1363
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:41,400
26years of experience 
 working against him.

1364
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,400
He figures anything big enough 
 to sink the ship

1365
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,400
they're going to see 
 in time to turn

1366
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,400
but the ship's too big 
 with too small a rudder.

1367
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,400
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1368
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,500
Everything he knows is wrong.

1369
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:06,500


1370
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,500
( Laughing) 
 It's quite proper ,  I assure you.

1371
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,500
This is the sitting room.

1372
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,500
- Will this light do? 
 - What?

1373
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,500
Don't artists need good light?

1374
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,500
( In French Accent): 
 That is true

1375
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,500
but I'm not used to working 
 in such horrible conditions.

1376
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,500
Monet!

1377
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,500
- Do you know his work? 
 - Of course.

1378
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,500
Look at his use of color here. 
 Isn't he great?

1379
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,500
I know ,  it's extraordinary.

1380
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,500


1381
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,500
Cal insists on carting 
 this hideous thing everywhere.

1382
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,500
Should we be expecting him 
 anytime soon?

1383
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:45,400
Not as long as the cigars 
 and brandy hold out.

1384
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,400


1385
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:51,400
- That's nice. 
 - What is it ,  a sapphire?

1386
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:55,400
A diamond ,  
 a very rare diamond.

1387
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:59,400


1388
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:04,400
Jack ,  I want you to draw me like one 
 of your French girls... wearing this.

1389
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,400
All right.

1390
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,400
Wearing only this.

1391
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:44,400


1392
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,500
The last thing I need 
 is another picture of me

1393
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,500
Looking like a porcelain doll.

1394
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,500


1395
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,500
As a paying customer...

1396
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,500


1397
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,500
I expect to get what I want.

1398
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:16,500


1399
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,500
Over on the bed-- 
 the couch.

1400
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:27,500


1401
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,500
Go... Lie down.

1402
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,500


1403

- Tell me when it looks right. 
 - Put your arm back the way it was.

Put that other arm up ,  
 that hand right by your face there.

1406

 - This is absurd.

 so many places she could be.

Like a mill pond. 
 Not a breath of wind.

1453

It will make the bergs 
 harder to see

 at the base.

01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,500
Jesus Christ.

1589
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:10,500


1590
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,400
( Glass Tinkling)

1591
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,400


1592
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,400
- ( Softly):Jesus. 
 - Hard to port!

1593
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:22,400
Crewman: 
 Hard to port!

1594
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,400


1595
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:27,400
( Men Screaming)

1596
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:31,400


1597
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:33,400
Get back!

1598
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:45,400


1599
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,400
( Screaming)

1600
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,400


1601
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:52,400
- ( Hissing) 
 - ( Screams)

1602
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:59,400


1603
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,500
- ( Metal Doors Closing) 
 - Come on ,  let's go!

1604
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,500
Get out the door! 
 They're closing the doors! Get out!

1605
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,500
Get out! Get out! Get out!

1606
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,500


1607
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,500
Get out the door! Go on!

1608
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,500
Go on! Come on ,  lads! 
 Go ,  lads ,  go!

1609
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,500


1610
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,500
Get out!

1611
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,500


1612
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,500
( Screams)

1613
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,500
( Doors Slamming)

1614
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:47,500


1615
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,500
( Softly): Oh ,  my God. 
 That was a close shave ,  weren't it?

1616
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,500
Smell ice ,  can you? 
 Bleeding Christ.

1617
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,500


1618
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:02,400
Note the time 
 and enter it in the log.

1619
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:06,400


1620
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,400
What was that ,  Mr. Murdoch?

1621
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:13,400
An iceberg ,  sir. 
 I put her hard to starboard

1622
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,400
and ran the engines full astern 
 but it was too close.

1623
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,400
I tried to port round it 
 but she hit and the...

1624
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:19,400


1625
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:22,400
- Close the watertight doors. 
 - Murdoch: The doors are closed ,  sir.

1626
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:25,400


1627
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,400
- All stop. 
 - Crewman: Aye ,  sir!

1628
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,400


1629
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,400
( Ringing)

1630
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:34,400


1631
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,400
Find the carpenter. 
 Get him to sound the ship.

1632
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,400
Yes ,  sir!

1633
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,400


1634
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:44,400
Fabrizio: 
 Porcaputtana!

1635
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,400
Che cazzo e?

1636
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,500


1637
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,500
Come on ,  let's get the hell 
 out of here! Come on ,  hurry up.

1638
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,500


1639
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,500
Excuse me. Why have the engines stopped? 
 I felt a shudder.

1640
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,500
I shouldn't worry ,  madam. 
 We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1641
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,500
That's the shudder you felt. 
 May I bring you anything?

1642
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,500
No ,  thank you.

1643
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,500


1644
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,500
Man: 
 Did you see anything?

1645
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,500
Man: 
 I don't see anything now ,  Do you?

1646
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,500
( Commotion)

1647
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,500
If this is the direction the rats 
 are going that's good enough for me.

1648
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,500


1649
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,500
Crewman: Please ,  sir ,  please. 
 Everything's under control.

1650
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:29,500


1651
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,500
- You there. 
 - Sir ,  there is no emergency.

1652
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,500
- Yes ,  there is ,  I have been robbed. 
 - Get the master-at-arms.

1653
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,500
- Now , you moron! 
 - Yes ,  sir.

1654
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,500
( Men Laughing)

1655
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:41,500


1656
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,500
Hey , you're going to miss the fun. 
 Did you see what happened?

1657
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,500
No ,  I missed it. 
 Apparently ,  it hit over there.

1658
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:51,400
Crewman: Boiler room six 
 is flooded eight feet above the plate.

1659
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,400
And the mail hold is worse. She's 
 all buckled in in the forward hold.

1660
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,400
- Can you shore up? 
 - Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1661
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,400
Have you seen the damage 
 in the mail hold?

1662
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:01,400
- No ,  she's already underwater. 
 - This is bad.

1663
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,400


1664
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:05,400
We should tell 
 Mother and Cal.

1665
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:06,400


1666
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,400
I think they're very good ,  sir.

1667
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:11,400


1668
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:14,400
Don't touch anything. 
 I want the entire room photographed.

1669
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:17,400
Rose: 
 Just keep holding my hand.

1670
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,400


1671
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,400
We've been looking 
 for you ,  miss.

1672
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:25,400


1673
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,400
Rose ( Sighs): 
 Well ,  here we go.

1674
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:33,400


1675
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:36,400
Something serious has happened.

1676
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,500
Yes ,  it has.

1677
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:39,500


1678
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,500
Indeed. Two things dear to me 
 have disappeared this evening.

1679
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,500
Now that one is back I have a pretty 
 good idea where to find the other.

1680
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,500
- Search him. 
 - Take your coat off ,  sir.

1681
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,500
- Now what? 
 - Come on.

1682
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,500
Cal ,  what are you doing? We're in the 
 middle of an emergency. What's going on?

1683
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,500
- Is this it? 
 - That's it.

1684
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,500
This is horse shit!

1685
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,500
- Don't you believe it ,  Rose. Don't! 
 - He couldn't have.

1686
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,500
Of course he could. 
 It's easy enough for a professional.

1687
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,500
But I was with him the whole time. 
 This is absurd.

1688
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:09,500


1689
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,500
Perhaps he did it while you were putting 
 your clothes back on ,  dear.

1690
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,500
Real slick ,  Cal. 
 Rose ,  they put it in my pocket.

1691
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,500


1692
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,500
- Shut up. 
 - It isn't even your pocket ,  is it ,  son?

1693
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,500
Property of A. L. Ryerson.

1694
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,500


1695
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,500
- That was reported stolen today. 
 - I just borrowed it.

1696
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,500
- I was going to return it. 
 - We have an honest thief here ,  do we?

1697
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,500
You know I didn't do this ,  Rose. 
 You know it.

1698
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,500
Don't you believe them ,  Rose. 
 You know I didn't do it.

1699
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:39,400
- Come on ,  let's go. 
 - You know I didn't do it ,  Rose. Rose!

1700
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,400
Come on ,  son. 
 There's a good lad.

1701
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:45,400
- Come on. 
 - You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1702
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,400


1703
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:50,400
Ismay: 
 Most unfortunate ,  Captain.

1704
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:53,400


1705
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:56,400
Water... 1 4 feet above 
 the keel in ten minutes--

1706
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:00,400
In the fore peak ,  in all three holds 
 and in the boiler room six.

1707
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,400
- That's right ,  sir. 
 - When can we get underway ,  damn it?

1708
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,400
That's five compartments.

1709
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:06,400


1710
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:10,400
She can stay afloat with the first 
 four compartments breached

1711
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:13,400
but not five-- not five.

1712
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:15,400
As she goes down by the head 
 the water

1713
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:20,400
will spill over the tops of bulkheads 
 at E deck from one to the next.

1714
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:23,400
Back and back. 
 There's no stopping it.

1715
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,500
The pumps-- 
 If we opened the doors--

1716
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,500
The pumps buy you time ,  
 but minutes only.

1717
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,500
From this moment ,  
 no matter what we do

1718
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,500
Titanic will founder.

1719
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,500


1720
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,500
But this ship can't sink.

1721
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,500
She's made of iron ,  sir. 
 I assure you ,  she can...

1722
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,500
and she will.

1723
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,500
It is a mathematical certainty.

1724
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,500


1725
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,500
How much time?

1726
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:58,500


1727
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,500
An hour. Two at most.

1728
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,500


1729
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,500
And how many aboard ,  
 Mr. Murdoch?

1730
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,500
2 , 200 souls on board ,  sir.

1731
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,500


1732
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,500
Well ,  I believe you may get 
 your headlines ,  Mr. Ismay.

1733
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:40,500


1734
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:44,400
Oh ,  it is a little slut ,  isn't it? Will 
 you look at me when I'm talking to you.

1735
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:46,400
( Knock A tDoor)

1736
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:48,400
- Mr. Hockley? 
 - Not now ,  we're busy.

1737
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:52,400
Sir ,  I've been told to ask you to please 
 put on your life belts and come up to--

1738
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,400
I said not now.

1739
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,400
I'm sorry to inconvenience you ,  
 Mr. Hockley ,  but it's Captain's orders.

1740
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,400
Now ,  please ,  dress warmly. 
 It's quite cold out tonight.

1741
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:04,400
Now ,  may I suggest 
 topcoats and hats.

1742
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:08,400
- This is ridiculous. 
 - Not to worry ,  miss.

1743
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:10,400
I am sure 
 it's just a precaution.

1744
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,400
Everybody up! 
 Life belts on!

1745
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,500
- ( Men Screaming Orders) 
 - What's he yelling about?

1746
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,500


1747
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,500
Everybody up! 
 Put your life belts on!

1748
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,500


1749
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,500
- What's the ruckus? 
 -Just put your life belts on!

1750
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,500
Crewman: 
 C.QD.?

1751
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,500
Sir?

1752
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,500


1753
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,500
That's right-- C.Q D. 
 The distress call.

1754
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,500
That's our position.

1755
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,500


1756
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,500
( Sighs)

1757
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,500
Tell whoever responds 
 that we're going down by the head.

1758
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,500
We need immediate assistance.

 Isn't there another passenger list?

- There's no other list. 
 - Perhaps he's on another ship.

- We're doing all we can ,  ma'am. 
 - There's got to be another list!

That's the last time 
 I ever saw him.

2927

He married ,  of course ,  
 and inherited his millions

 hit his interests hard

2930
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:20,500

 in his mouth that year

No ,  there wouldn't be ,  
 would there?

2945
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,500
And I've never 
 spoken of him until now.

Not to anyone ,  
 not even your grandfather.

 is a deep ocean of secrets.

But now you know there was 
 a man named Jack Dawson

2949
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,500
and that he saved me

2950
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:25,500
