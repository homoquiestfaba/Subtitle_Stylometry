1
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,400
All right.

2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,659
Are you ready for one more?

00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,492
<i>♪ I had a girlfriend ♪</i>

00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,120

00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,614
You with the band?

11
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,616
Yeah. Record label.

12
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,744
-You better put that on.
-Yes, sir.

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,548
Whoa.

14
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,592
<i>♪ Nothin', nothin'</i>♪

15
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,764
Guys, cleanup on aisle seven.
What's up, man?

16
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,900
Hi, Leo. Keep playing that thing,
you're gonna go blind.

17
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,319
Matt, where are we on that sit-down
with Elijah?

18
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,322
-I told you, talk to Zeke.
-Zeke said talk to you.

19
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,740
They want the cover.

20
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,243
Jeff won't commit
until he sees the article.

21
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,662
But it's a definite possibility.

22
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,747
Gotta go, Leo.

23
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,167
Come on, Matt.
Is he gonna do it or not?

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,252
It's a "definite possibility."

25
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,305
We love you, New York!

26
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,017
-What's up, man?
-Good to see you too!

27
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,936
What's up?

28
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,066
What's up, man?

29
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,343
Elijah. Got a visitor.

30
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,932
-Hey.
-Hey.

31
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,850
-Great set, man.
-Thank you.

32
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,060
Yeah.

33
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,604
-Did you talk to him?
-Not yet.

34
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,523
-Would you talk to him?
-Talk to me about what?

35
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,279
Talk to me about what?

36
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,492
Elijah just signed with Interscope.

37
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,786
What?

38
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,165
Are you fucking joking? What's going on?

39
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,459
You're just slow, man.

40
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,462
"I'm slow"? What do you mean, "I'm slow"?

41
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,340
-He doesn't mean "slow."
-He said, "slow." Shut up, okay? -What do you mean?
-I haven't had a record out in a year.

42
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,346
So? You're gettin' ready to cut an album.
We just booked a studio.

43
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,890
Look, Interscope's got two songs
ready to go.

44
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,268
And they're fuckin' good.

45
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,354
But they're not yours.
I thought you want to do your own stuff.

46
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,774
We've been telling you for a while now
that we need a new single, okay?

47
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,237
Jesus. Elijah, come on, man.

48
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,906
I got nothing but love for you, man.
Really.

49
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,325
It's not personal.

50
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,329
Yeah.

51
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,184
Good morning, Eve.

52
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,688
- Morning, Matt.
- Hi.

53
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,108
-Does she know about...
-Everyone knows. Can you pull Elijah's sheet
when you get a chance?

54
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,450
-Thanks.
-Matt Ryder's office. This is Kim.

55
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,244
I'm sorry. Mr. Ryder is in a meeting.
Can you return?

56
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,538
-Thank you.
-Shit. His numbers were holding.

57
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,207
-Rob Marker's office. This is Kim.
-Rob Marker's office?

58
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,544
I'm sorry. I don't have him right now.
Can you return? Great.

59
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,465
-What the hell was that?
-Marker's been promoted.

60
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,133
Really?

61
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,053
And Mr. Lepselter
actually wants to see you right now.

62
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,931
Sit down.

63
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,729
Am I about to get fired?

64
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,439
Sit down.

65
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,612
I've been working for you since
before you could make payroll. Ten years.

66
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,781
I've kept you on at a loss
for the last few.

67
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,991
A loss? Really? Okay.

68
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,662
I brought you a Coldplay demo in '99.
You didn't even listen to it.

69
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,248
Arcade Fire in 2003.
A bootleg and you were like,

70
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,959
"Great in concert.
Won't translate to the airwaves."

71
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,838
Three years ago, I had the Spare Sevens
in the room. In the fucking room.

72
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,759
I blew a few good calls for you. So?
You been cashin' that chit in for years.

73
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,512
I know music better than anybody
in this fuckin' office.

74
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,015
Yeah. You've got a great ear.
That made you irreplaceable in 1998.

75
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,601
-Bullshit. It still matters.
-Music is a commodity.

76
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,397
And it's airborne. You can't protect it.
You can't sell what you can't protect.

77
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,400
You only sell the artist.
You haven't been signing any.

78
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,778
Last night, you let your meal ticket
walk out that door.

79
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,114
Yeah.

80
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,032
Yeah, well...

81
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,576
I'm still working 'em.

82
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,287
-Working who?
-Spare Sevens.

83
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
-Spare Sevens?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,416
Right.

85
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,628
Hey, I'm not jokin'. No, no, no.
They're not happy at Sony.

86
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,005
The label rushed the last album.
They're pissed.

87
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,133
The Spare Sevens
are about to pop globally.

88
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,759
Sony will make them happy.

89
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,553
No. These guys aren't like Elijah.

90
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,765
They actually take the time to make music
the way real bands used to make it.

91
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,144
I talked to their manager, Dan, at PMO.

92
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,647
-You have a sit-down?
-I will.

93
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,903
I'll give you two weeks.

94
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,657
Not because I owe it to you,
but because I want the Spare Sevens.

95
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,298
Hello.

96
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,760
You have no pictures.

97
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,848
Like, on your walls and your desk.
You don't have any photos.

98
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,725
Who doesn't hang up a picture?

99
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,977
- Good question.
- Who are you?

100
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,024
Most people in the office have photos of
their wife, girlfriend, dog. Something.

101
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,570
Well, my wife left me, don't have
a girlfriend, and I'm afraid of dogs.

102
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,489
I'm sorry to disappoint. Excuse me.

103
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,491
<i>Yes?</i>

104
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,744
Hi. There is a strange woman
standing in my office.

105
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,954
-<i>On my way.</i>
-I am not strange.

106
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,207
-You're a little strange.
-I work for Ben.

107
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,877
You work for Ben.
Okay, that's great.

108
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,506
-I don't know who that is.
-Benjamin Asher Ryder.

109
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,049
Your father.

110
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,094
Sorry, I'm Zooey Kern.

111
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,139
I'm Ben's nurse/personal assistant.

112
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,393
Listen, Miss Kern. This has already been
a monumentally shitty day,

113
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,812
and I haven't started dealing
with the West Coast.

114
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,397
Hey, Kim!

115
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,275
Not sure what you're doing here.
Honestly, I don't care.

116
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,069
Ben's dying.

117
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,954
Right. See, I thought I covered that
with "I don't care."

118
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,957
He has liver cancer.

119
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,627
And he's got three months left,
maybe four. Sorry, Matt. I was in with Marker.
Miss, do you have an appointment?

120
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,425
-Wouldn't you know if she did?
-It was rhetorical.

121
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,053
I need you to show this woman out. Okay?

122
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,305
Then get ahold of Dan Summers
at PMO Talent.

123
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,474
I want to talk to him
about the Spare Sevens.

124
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,518
Actually, just say that it's urgent.

125
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,770
-Rob Marker's office.
-Are you kidding me?

126
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,360
I'll just call security myself. I don't think you actually have security.

127
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,739
No. No, we don't.

128
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,825
Are you familiar with Kodachrome?

129
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,037
Yes. Paul Simon, 1973.
What do you want to know?

130
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,622
Not that. Kodachrome film.

131
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,459
Your father shoots on Kodachrome. He
prefers his pictures to be projected...

132
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,962
...with light rather than printed.
I know his spiel.

133
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,716
There's only one place left in the world
that processes Kodachrome,

134
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,010
and that's Dwayne's Photo
in Parsons, Kansas.

135
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,345
But Kodak decided to
stop manufacturing the dyes,

136
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,765
so after next week, it'll be impossible
to develop Kodachrome film.

137
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,642
-Amazing.
-Your father found four rolls

138
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,060
he shot a long time ago,

139
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,272
and he never got them developed,
and it woke something up in him.

140
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,983
He's decided he's going to have
one last show.

141
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,651
How about that? Good for him, okay?

142
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,195
This has been very, very... annoying.

143
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,573
-Let me show you out.
-Can I just...

144
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,744
Ben needs to get these rolls to Kansas,
and he can't fly in his condition.

145
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,330
If only there was a service
that delivered overnight.

146
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,082
-Yeah, well, he doesn't trust FedEx.
-Of course not.

147
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,545
You're his nurse/assistant/whatever.
Don't you have a driver's license?

148
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,380
-Yeah, I do.
-There you go.

149
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,634
But Ben wants you to drive him.

150
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,015
I'm gonna try to explain this
as clearly as possible for you.

151
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,101
I've not spoken to the man
in over a decade.

152
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,730
There's no way in hell I'm going
to Kansas with him. Or anywhere.

153
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,231
Come to dinner tonight.

154
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,150
I know I'm talking. I can hear my voice.

155
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,360
Matt!

156
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,696
He's dying.

157
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,785
You should go see him one last time.

158
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,545
There'll be a car waiting for you
downstairs.

159
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,330
Hey, Matt. Larry Holdt, Ben's manager.

160
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,957
Yeah, I remember you.

161
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,669
The last time I saw you,
you were still a teenager.

162
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,422
That's great.

163
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,175
Well, maybe we should get inside.

164
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,820
He's in there.

165
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,455
<i>♪ You're so good ♪</i>

166
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,834
<i>♪ You get me high ♪</i>

167
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,088
<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>- ♪ You're so good for me ♪</i>

168
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,384
<i>♪ You're so good for me ♪</i>

169
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,405
I didn't think you'd come.

170
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,162
Those look familiar.

171
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,207
Well, they should. They're yours.

172
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,793
You wanna bang it around a little?

173
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,171
-No, I don't play anymore.
-That's too bad.

174
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,633
'Cause you used to be pretty good.

175
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,488
Sorry for the smell.

176
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,284
You know, the meds they give me
give me gas.

177
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,690
So, Matt...

178
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,278
Larry tells me things haven't been going
so well for you at the record label.

179
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:28,158
I was telling Ben that record labels can't
find a sustainable business model.

180
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,453
You told me that he was gonna be
out on his ass any day now.

181
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,663
Jesus, Ben.

182
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,249
-Where'd you hear that?
-Larry knows everything.

183
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,085
-Behave.
-I'm dyin'. I don't have time to behave.

184
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,798
Come on. That's bullshit.
You were a prick long before cancer.

185
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,092
That's true enough.

186
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,804
At least you two are talking.

187
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,139
This is good.

188
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,477
So how much time you got left?

189
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,107
Depends on which doctor you talk to.

190
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,443
I'm betting tits up by New Year's.

191
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,616
Why did you get divorced? She catch you
in flagrante with some other babe?

192
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,202
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
-You catch her?

193
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,247
Because you fucked around on Mom
doesn't mean everyone does.

194
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,624
Pace yourselves.

195
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,084
Your mother and I had
a complicated relationship.

196
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,004
Complicated by you putting your dick
in every woman you met.

197
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,839
Your mother forgave me.

198
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,426
-Yeah. Well, she died alone, Ben.
-So will I.

199
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,511
-Yeah, but you deserve to.
-Hey.

200
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,728
It's okay.
We're just... just catching up here.

201
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,980
- People change.
- No, they don't.

202
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,359
Why don't we talk about the trip?

203
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,404
I can save us all a lot of trouble here.
I'm not going on any trip.

204
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,701
You are a desperate old man.

205
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,164
Tryin' to what?
Manufacture some bullshit redemption?

206
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,583
Why?

207
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:05,172
So you can pretend your empty, selfish
life was anything but meaningless?

208
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,342
Thanks, but no thanks.

209
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:13,973
Just so you know, when you are dead,
no one's gonna care that you're gone.

210
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,351
I mean, maybe these two,
but you pay for them.

211
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,676
-Hello?
-Matt, Larry Holdt.

212
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,219
-Hey, Larry.
-<i>I want to discuss...</i>

213
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,440
Come on, man.

214
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,735
<i>Matt, don't hang up.</i>

215
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,778
-Not gonna change my mind, Larry.
-<i>I know.</i>

216
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,948
- <i>I'm gonna change it for you.</i>
- You are? Really? How?

217
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,701
<i>Spare Sevens. I can get you a sit-down.</i>

218
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,998
-Go on.
-<i>Their manager used to work for me.</i>

219
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,376
<i>He says you've been calling all day.</i>

220
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,547
They're going to be playing in Chicago
in a few days. Some radio station thing.

221
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,549
<i>You can swing by on your way.</i>

222
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,177
Wait. Hold on.
What do you mean on my way?

223
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
You're talking about Kansas, yeah?

224
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,307
Look. I don't know
how to make this any more clear.

225
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,309
That's just not going to happen.

226
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,479
Look. Ben needs the show,
and you need that meeting

227
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,274
<i>And trust me.</i>
<i>This is the only way you'll get it.</i>

228
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,362
I'm not going to go with him, Larry.

229
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,240
It's not happening.

230
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,493
Please, don't call back.

231
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,681
Fuck.

232
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,953
Good morning, Matthew.
Glad you reconsidered.

233
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,039
So what's up with the Sevens?

234
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,415
Show's Saturday.

235
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,794
I'll make arrangements
for a meeting afterwards.

236
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,384
Still drive that?
You fix the roof yet?

237
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,719
I'm sorry.
Would you like to take your car?

238
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,014
-I don't have a car.
-Then that settles that.

239
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,016
The car runs fine, Matt.

240
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,563
- You're going too?
- Unless you want to give me my shots.

241
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,566
-Is that okay with you?
-Fine with me.

242
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,779
-All right.
-Let's go! We're burning daylight.

243
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,993
<i>In two miles, merge onto I-80 West.</i>

244
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,786
Do not text and driv<i>e</i>, please.

245
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,707
I'm not texting. I'm looking at texts.
There's a difference.

246
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,210
Hey, this car doesn't have an iPhone jack
or anything like that, does it?

247
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,423
We're strictly analog here.
Some cassettes in the glove compartment.

248
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:39,803
<i>In 1.5 miles, stay</i>
<i>to the right to merge onto I-80 West.</i>

249
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,347
Zooey, hand me that thing for a second,
will you?

250
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,224
Yeah.

251
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,065
-What the hell are you doing?
-Like I said, strictly analog.

252
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,443
We gotta drive halfway
across the country.

253
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,863
That's right. I'm not gonna have
some robot bitch whinin' in my ear,

254
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,532
sending me on some sterile interstate.

255
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,578
We have a week to get to Kansas.
We're taking the scenic route.

256
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,206
We're going to use this map here.

257
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,834
-Remember what a map is?
-Yeah. I know what a map is.

258
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,797
-Turn that up, will you, Zo?
-Yeah.

259
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,382
Love this song.

260
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:23,472
<i>♪ You've already burned it down ♪</i>

261
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,392
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

262
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,337
Ben, you're here.

263
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,308
There's a diner across the street.
We should meet up later and grab dinner.

264
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,435
That sounds like a plan.

265
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,646
Yeah, you guys go ahead.

266
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,775
I'm just gonna get in a quick workout,
make it an early night.

267
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,370
Hey.

268
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,790
Don't give me that look.

269
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,669
Okay. You know what?
You need to let your guard down.

270
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,173
-Excuse me?
-Yeah. I know you're scared.

271
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,134
Scared? What am I scared of exactly?

272
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,219
You're scared to open yourself up to him.

273
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,805
You're scared to let yourself
love him again.

274
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,683
-Wow.
-Don't.

275
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,227
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Yeah.

276
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,897
Yeah, I mean forget therapy
or the facts of my relationship with him,

277
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,276
you spend six hours in a car with me,
and you've cracked the code.

278
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,154
-You don't have to be a dick.
-No, I don't need to be a dick.

279
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,073
I need to be...
less scared to let him in.

280
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,992
Or let him into...

281
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,870
-I'm just saying...
-I'll mull it over.

282
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,621
You made the effort to come.

283
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,958
You may as well
try and get to know him a little bit.

284
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,335

00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:53,515
and I was in the White House doing
a spread on Clinton at Bill's request.

294
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,519
It was right after the whole, you know,
bullshit impeachment circus.

295
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,895
Bill was trying to prove...

296
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,064
You're calling
the Lewinsky scandal bullshit?

297
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,192
He cheated on his wife
and lied to the entire country about it.

298
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,404
They all cheat. They all fuck around.
You should know that.

299
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,157
-Ben.
-What? After the way your marriage ended?

300
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,325
-You're seriously gonna sit here and...
-Stop.

301
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:16,163
What? Just because Matt's here.
Don't be an idiot.

302
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:20,500
-If anybody knows about fuckin' around...
-Hey, you need to stop talking now.

303
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,670
-Leave her alone, okay?
-It's fine.

304
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,090
I do believe Matt here's defending you.

305
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,303
Just go back to your bullshit stories
about you and your fancy friends.

306
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,805
What we're seeing now is jealousy.

307
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:39,728
Envy and resentment of a man living in the
shadow of his father's accomplishments.

308
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,814
Yeah, you've had a great big life.

309
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,484
Yeah. You're damn straight I did.

310
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,237
Where are all those friends
while you're dying?

311
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,197
-Matt.
-Alone?

312
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,323
Stop.

313
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:56,161
My work will live on long after I'm gone.
What have you done?

314
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,880
Holy shit. Look at that, man.
She's gotta be 250 pounds or something.

315
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,798
That outfit's beautiful.

316
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,387
Can you just try and take it easy on him?

317
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,057
Me? Are you kidding me?
I was defending you.

318
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:23,813
You know, a month from now, two months,
he's going to be gone forever.

319
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,566
No, I get it, okay?
I understand the concept.

320
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,861
It doesn't give him a free pass
to be an asshole to people.

321
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,574

What? What's funny?

335
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,176
When I was a kid,
my mom used to take me up to the Poconos

336
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,136
for a few weeks every summer.

337
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:22,390
After we'd pass a few of those
deer crossing signs that just went by,

338
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,101
I remember I asked her,

339
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:30,982
"Mom, how do the deers know
that's where they're supposed to cross?"

340
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,402
I was being serious. I was a kid.

341
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:39,949
But she just laughed her ass off like
it was the funniest thing she ever heard.

342
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,285
That felt great, 'cause...

343
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,247
I don't remember her laughing much.

344
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,336
When did she die?

345
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,674
I...

346
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,511
When I was 13.

347
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,724
I'm so sorry.

348
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,692
After that I moved out of New York to
live with my aunt and uncle in Cleveland.

349
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,530
Ben was...
He was working in Africa at the time.

350
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,201
He didn't even make it back
for the funeral.

351
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,578
There was a civil war going on.

352
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,499
I'm not making excuses. I'm just...

353
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:34,796
saying if you think you had it rough,
just spend some time and effort.

354
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,756
I'll remember that.

355
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,220
We should go see him.

356
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,888
Go see who?

357
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,767
Your Uncle Dean.
Cleveland's only an hour away,

358
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,354
and your "Spare Sister's" thing
isn't until tomorrow night.

359
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,357
I wouldn't mind seeing my brother...

360
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,069
one more time before I leave this planet.

361
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,447
Yeah, but...

362
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,741
Dean hates you.

363
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,786
He doesn't hate me.
He's just pissed off at me.

Hi, Dean.

370
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,534
You dyin'?

371
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,412
-What? Is it that obvious?
-Well, you're here.

372
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,998
Yes, I am

373
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,168
It's good to see you

374
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,882
-Matt, what are you doin' here?
-Hi. That is a long story.

375
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,091
Yeah, I bet.

376
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,053
-And who's this?
-This is Zooey.

377
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,930
-Yep, Zooey.
- Is that Matty?

378
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,139
Nice to meet you.

379
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,641
-Hi!
-Hey.

380
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,727
Ben.

381
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,855
-Hi, Sarah.
-He's dying.

382
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,025
Well, not in our driveway, he isn't.
Bring him on in.

383
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,153
And you!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

384
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,030
Sorry. It was a last-minute thing.

385
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,699
-Hey! Hi!
-This is Zooey.

386
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,828
Matty. Well, now she's more like it.

387
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,413
I mean,
I told him not to marry the other one.

388
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,084
-No, I, um...
-Zooey is Ben's nurse.

389
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,255
Because your auras are conjoined.

390
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,174
-I could see that immediately
-Yeah. Yeah.

391
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,511
Aunt Sarah here can see auras.

392
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,013
-And she can hear sarcasm.
-Of course she can.

393
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,599
-You guys are gonna spend the night?
-If that's okay.

394
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,893
Great.
Matty, you and Zooey take your old room.

395
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,062
-But we are... not together.
-Nope.

396
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,450
Hi.

397
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,370
-Hey.
-This was your room.

398
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,749
Yeah. Basically, seventh, eighth grade
through high school.

399
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,210
God, you were really into music.

400
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:24,465
Yep. They say it's the one thing
I inherited from Ben.

401
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:31,639
Actually, I would say that
the only memories, or good ones,

402
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,184
at least, that I have of him
were listening to music.

403
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:39,188
We had this little den
and this old Fisher stereo.

404
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,357
I mean, new at the time, but...

405
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,527
He'd let me play records
when he was goin' through the slides.

406
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,073
So, while most kids had people
singin' 'em lullabies to sleep,

407
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,493
I had Graham Nash singing "Wounded Bird."

408
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,330
Let's see what we have here.

409
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,459
Ooh! Pearl Jam. Radiohead.

410
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,629
-Nirvana.
-What can I say? I was a moody kid.

411
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,466
Yeah, you can tell a lot about someone's
past from the music they listened to.

412
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,928
Then I guess you know a lot about
my past now.

413
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,931
What do you think I listened to?

414
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,938
Very interesting question.
Okay, I'll bite.

415
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,358
But in order to do this
to the best of my ability,

416
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,569
I have to actually figure out
your exact age, so... excuse this.

417
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,073
This might be a little rude.
What are you? Twenty-eight?

418
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,866
-I'm 30.
-You are?

419
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,825
-Yeah.
-Hey.

420
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,786
-Thank you.
-Dodged a bullet there.

421
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,916
So that means you were
a freshman in college, like, in 2000.

422
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,503
So then you were into... Sorry to say, but you're a product
of your environment. Top 40.

423
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,510
I'm talking Britney, Christina,
boy bands, N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys,

424
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,345
maybe Alanis when you're feeling dark.

425
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,472
-Please give me some credit.
-But then...

426
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,892
But then you started to rebel against
your middle-class suburban values.

427
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,144
Is that what I was doing?

428
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,189
Or possibly
you met a guy into alternative music.

429
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,568
Why do you assume that I changed
for a guy? Maybe he changed for me.

430
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,364
No, no. Guys don't change for girls.
Not in college at least.

431
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,950
-When do they change then?
-Much later.

432
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,120
Usually when it's too late.

433
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,666
You started to listen to bands
you thought would make you edgier,

434
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,419
but you're still hopelessly mainstream.

435
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,880
You're sittin' there in your dorm room,
and you're listening to...

436
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,174
Live.

437
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,137
Like who live? What live?

438
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,557
-No, the band, "Live."
-I don't know of a band called Live.

439
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,058
Live. You know. Like...

440
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,518
♪ <i>I alone want you ♪</i>

441
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:44,063
I actually could not name a single song
that the band Live had.

442
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,733
What about "Lightning Crashes"?
Everyone knows that.

443
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,609
<i>♪ Her placenta falls to the floor</i>♪

444
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,403
- My God!
- What?

445
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,990
People know it because it's the only
pop song with the word "placenta" in it.

446
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,869
You're really bad at this.
I was a weird, sad punk.

447
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,413
-It was the Smiths, Pixies.
-But you loved Live.

448
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,583
-Yeah, I loved Live.
-Biggest fan. Live's biggest fan.

449
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,876
No, I'm not wrong.

450
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,670
-This isn't bad.
-What?

451
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,756
- Galaxie 500.
- Yeah.

452
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,424
-Obscure.
-Indeed.

453
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,469
-Does your record player still work?
-Fucking better.

454
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,013

-Yeah.
-Yeah. Couple of years now.

465
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,702
-Have any kids?
-Not yet, but...

466
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,705
You know, they're so young.
There's no rush.

467
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,709
So what's so special about
these photographs

468
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,130
you need to drive halfway
across the country to get them developed?

469
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,382
It's some of my early work.

470
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,842
Stuff I shot years ago.

471
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,053
What happens if you get 'em back,
and they're garbage?

472
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,805
How do you even know what's on them?

473
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,266
I remember every shot I've ever taken.

474
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,019
That's, like,
hundreds of thousands of photos.

475
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,772
-You remember all of them?
-Yep.

476
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,983
That's impressive.

477
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,319
When's my birthday?

478
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,539
- February 19.
- February 19.

479
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,625
You got it. Yeah.

480
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,055
-Last one.
-Thanks.

481
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,683
It's good to see them together again.

482
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,353
It's good to see you with him.

483
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,483
I don't know. He left us.

484
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,445
Hell, he left you guys too.

485
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,617
Now he's dying, so he comes back,
and we're just lettin' him back in.

486
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,287
It's like he's getting away with it.

487
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,872
Matty, look at him.

488
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,627
I mean, does that look like a man
who's gotten away with anything?

489
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,218
Okay, I'm gonna...

490
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,887
I'm gonna go upstairs.

491
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,723
Try and get a little work done
before I pass out.

492
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,479
Can I take this, put wine it,
and drink it in my room?

493
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,272
-Help yourself.
-All right.

494
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,566
-'Night, sweetheart.
-'Night.

495
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,443
-I'm so glad you're here.
-Me too.

496
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,403
-I love you.
-Love you too.

497
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,369
Hey, guys. I'm going to bed.
I'll see you in the morning.

498
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,162
-Okay.
-All right.

499
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,338
-You good?
-Yeah.

500
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,758
Yeah, no, I'm just a little tired.
Gonna get some work done.

501
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,719
I'm glad you're making this trip.

502
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,224
A man should know his father,
no matter what kind of bastard he is.

503
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,814
You should come back here more often.

504
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:58,693
-I know. I'm sorry.
-That's okay. End of the lecture.

505
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,486
-It's good to see you.
-Thanks.

506
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,292
Yep.

507
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,877
-Hey, I saw...
-Hey.

508
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,506
that your light was still on.
I got you a glass of water.

509
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,590
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

510
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,676
I know those guys can drink, so...

511
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,053
Thought that might help
the cause in the morning.

512
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,930
-How are you?
-Good.

513
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,890
Is it hard being here?

514
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,852
Um...

515
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,771
-Sorry. Do you want to come in?
-Yeah.

516
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,484
No. I mean, me, no.

517
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,487
-Um, can I sit down?
-Yeah.

518
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,242
Not weird for me. I guess
the weird thing would be...

519
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,580
you know, seein' Ben here. Is a little, you know, odd.

520
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,007
Um...

521
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,510
Sarah... thinks you're beautiful.

522
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,474
Okay. Cool.

523
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,771
You are though.

524
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,734
-I think you're drunk.
-No.

525
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,655
Maybe. I might be, actually.

526
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,283
But I'm not saying this 'cause I'm drunk.

527
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,951
And I'm not gonna not say it

528
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,996
'cause I think you'll think
I'm only saying it because I'm drunk.

529
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,290
I don't know what we're talking about.

530
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,376
- You didn't follow that?
- No.

531
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,754
Then maybe I am drunk.
'Cause I followed it perfectly.

532
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,759
This is a bad idea.

533
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,720
-What? We're just talking.
-Yeah, well.

534
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:55,309
Then you have to talk about the fact that
you're just talking and not just talking.

535
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,061
Right.

536
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,444
- Wait, I'm sorry. I mean...
! Whoa.

537
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,447
My God. I'm so sorry.

538
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,699
Holy shit.

539
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,868
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

540
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,203
I guess I deserved that.

541
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,792
Thanks.

542
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,631
- Hey, close your eyes.
- Are you gonna get weird?

543
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,135
No. No. Just close 'em.

544
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,554
Okay. They're closed.

545
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,347
Hold on a sec.

546
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,769
Okay, you can open 'em now.

547
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,982
Wow. That's really cool.

548
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,653
Yeah, my cousin Hank
was really into astronomy.

549
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,989
Yeah, I can tell.

550
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,957
What, um,  Ben was saying...

551
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,170
...last night at the diner
about your... ex-husband?

552
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,884
Is that what happened? He cheated?

553
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:17,224
Nothing good comes from reliving the past.
You know?

554
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,645
You just sound like my ex-wife now.

555
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,233
She used to say that I'd...

556
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:32,490
I had a tendency to live in the past
rather than... embracing the present.

557
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,410
Is that why she left you?

558
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,917
It's never... one thing, now, is it?

559
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,045
What about you?

560
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,423
I don't know.
It all just happened so fucking fast.

561
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:53,636
One moment we're just...
we're cruising and then...

562
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,140
the next we're driving off a cliff.

563
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,269
The funny thing is, I actually...

564
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:07,233
For a moment there,
I thought I had it together, you know?

565
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,987
I thought
I was someone to be reckoned with.

566
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,343
My God, Ben. Jesus.

567
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,057
- Help. God.
- Ben, what did you do? Are you okay?

568
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:45,729
Yeah, yeah. I just...
I just got dizzy, and I tripped over...

569
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,857
the corner over here.
I was gonna take a shower.

570
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:52,820
Wait for me before you do that.
Can you move your fingers? Toes?

571
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,780
- Yeah.
- Any dizziness or nausea?

572
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,742
-Do you have any pain?
-No.

573
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,578
Bend your leg for me.

574
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:06,375
Wait. Stop gropin' me. Jesus Christ.
What are you doin'?

575
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,669
I need to make sure
you don't have broken bones.

576
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,671
-Help me up.
-I got you.

577
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,717
- Here you go.
- God. Jesus Christ.

578
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,011
-You don't feel pain anywhere?
-No.

579
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,762
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

580
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,848
- My God.
- I'm all right. -

581
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,271
I'm fine. I just need to sit here
for a couple minutes.

582
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,897
-Okay.
-Yeah.

583
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,901
- Thanks, baby.
- My God. Gave me a heart attack.

584
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,458
- Hot coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

585
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:51,920
We should be able to get to Chicago
by late afternoon at the latest, yeah?

586
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:56,133
That'll give us five days to get to Kansas
before the lab closes.

587
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,304
So you two are screwing now.

588
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:06,810
I mean, it makes sense.
He's low-hanging fruit sexually speaking.

589
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,356
You haven't been laid in what?
Three years?

590
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,776
-How about we shut up now, okay?
-You like your women damaged.

591
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,738
-You like to damage yours.
-Okay, that's enough. Both of you.

592
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,454
I didn't damage you. Did I, Sarah?

593
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,795
-What's he talkin' about?
-Ben.

594
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,133
-Sarah, what's he talking about?
-Nothing.

595
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:43,013
A million years ago before
we went on our first date. Nothing.

596
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,474
What? Did Sarah never mention that?

597
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,354
I can understand why.
It wasn't really very memorable.

598
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:55,693
Mostly just a lot of dry humping. Had
a couple drinks and couldn't quite get...

599
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,819
Shut your mouth, Ben.

600
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,739
Though God knows
she tried every trick in the book.

601
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,199
-Shut up.
-Dean!

602
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:07,329
What are you gonna do, Dean?
You gonna come over here and hit me?

603
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,043
There's nothin' left to hit.

604
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,345
Christ.

605
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,187
-What is your fucking problem?
-Can we just calm down?

606
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,649
I'm not gonna calm down.
Can't watch him shit all over my family.

607
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,944
I'm just bustin' his balls
for Christ' sake. He's my kid brother.

608
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,157
He was more of a father to me
than you ever were.

609
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,835
I was just busting his balls.

610
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,756
Drama.

611
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,220
Doesn't anyone else
see how ridiculous it is?

612
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,850
I mean, don't get me wrong.
You're a really good looking girl, Zooey.

613
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:57,189
You're even sexy in a sloppy kind of way.
You got full lips, nice skin, great legs.

614
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,276
And I guess, you know,
Matt's in decent enough shape.

615
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,196
He's got no glaringly bad features.

616
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:08,408
Judging by my own modest dimensions, I
doubt he's packing a python in his pants,

617
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,370
but I'm sure it's
a perfectly adequate cock in a pinch.

618
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,539
You're thrown together by circumstance.

619
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,874
Neither one of you has demonstrated
any ability

620
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,252
to sustain any kind of
meaningful relationship.

621
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:23,632
To the contrary, you're both
especially dysfunctional in that regard.

622
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:28,554
It's going to become very awkward
when this situation... goes south,

623
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,514
and it will.

624
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,975
-I mean, look at you.
-Shut up.

625
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,019
Okay? Just shut up.

626
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,896
Nothing happened.

627
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,692
-Nothing happened?
-Nothing!

628
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,861
You were alone in a room.

629
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,320
-She's drunk.
-I wasn't drunk.

630
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,072
-She's coming on to you.
-No.

631
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:51,493
Every star in the sexual galaxy
is lined up. You couldn't seal the deal?

632
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,371
What do you need?
Landing lights between her legs?

633
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,914
Thanks for that.

634
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,084
-Thanks for that!
-Well, no offense. It's just...

635
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,170
It's just disappointing. That's all.

636
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,340
Well, really sorry to disappoint you.

637
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,801
Are you ever happy, Ben?

638
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,263
Let me tell you something.
Happiness is bullshit.

639
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,432
It's the great myth
of the late 20th century.

640
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,642
You think Picasso was happy?

641
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,728
You think Hemingway was?

642
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,397
Hendrix? They were miserable shits.

643
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,943
No art worth a damn was ever created
out of happiness. I can tell you that.

644
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:30,073
Ambition, narcissism, sex, rage.

645
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:34,244
Those are the engines that drive
every great artist, every great man.

646
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,373
A hole that can't be filled.

647
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,962
That's why
we're all such miserable assholes.

648
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,090
So you know you're a miserable asshole.

649
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,677
What? Do you think I'm an idiot?
Of course I know.

650
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,182
'Course I know.

You would have saved us all
a lot of trouble if you shot digital.

00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,346
You ever hold a pair of fake tits
in your hands?

661
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,267
- What?
- No matter how good something looks,

662
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,271
you can't beat the real thing.

663
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:10,192
People are taking more pictures now
than ever before.

664
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,613
Billions of 'em.
But there's no slides, no prints.

665
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,490
They're just data,

666
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,825
electronic dust.

667
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:23,622
Years from now, when they dig us up,
there won't be any pictures to find.

668
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:29,086
No record of who we were, how we lived.

669
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:33,924
What's the point of having an artifact
if you never see it with your own eyes?

670
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,386
You still talking about film?

671
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,558
Never mind. Hey, Matt, Matt.

672
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:52,943
I don't kid myself that I was
any kind of husband or father.

673
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,570
It's not about that.

674
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,451
You just never saw me.

675
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,580
Not once, Ben.

676
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:11,336
I see for a living, Matt. It's what I do.

677
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,846
We better get going.

678
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,463
Hey, we just got to the hotel in Chicago.
Thanks for the passes for tonight.

679
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:59,259
<i>I have you booked in St. Louis</i>
<i>tomorrow night, then Kansas City,</i>

680
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,636
<i>-then Parsons for Tuesday.</i>
-Okay.

681
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,140
<i>That gives you two extra days</i>
<i>before the lab closes.</i>

682
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,728
Hey, look, Larry, I'd rather just go
straight from St. Louis to Parsons.

683
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,439
I just want to drop off this film
and get back to my life.

684
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,524
-If that's all right.
<i>-Suit yourself.</i>

685
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,818
-<i>You ready for tonight?</i>
-Yeah, I'm ready.

686
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,905
-Don't worry about me, Larry.
<i>-Good luck anyway.</i>

687
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,990
Thanks, I guess.

688
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,936
-Okay.
-Go, Zooey.

689
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,235
Hey.

690
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,656
Before I forget.
This is your pass for tonight.

691
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,743
-This is the band you're pitchin'?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's them.

692
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,081
Why don't you try
running your spiel by me?

693
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,875
You know, kick the tires a little bit.

694
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,753
No. No, I'm okay. Thanks though.

695
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:21,132
Come on. I mean, you're asking
a successful band to leave a major label

696
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,218
and trust you at a boutique.

697
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,844
Let's hear it.

698
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:30,100
Come on. Just give me your pitch.
It's good practice.

699
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,852
I mean, your career depends on it, right?

700
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,815
Okay.

701
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,985
We're not corporate.

702
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,571
We're not part of a conglomerate
that only worries about the bottom line.

703
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:47,242
We actually are a company that still
believes the artist is visionary,

704
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,994
not just a product.

705
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,956
Yeah, don't say any of that.
You sound like a pussy.

706
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,457
Never mind. Bad idea.

707
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,960
You were always a little timid,
even as a little kid.

708
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,838
You have any idea how condescending
and insulting you can be?

709
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,048
Just listen to me?
These guys are surrounded

710
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,093
by people tellin' 'em
how great they are all the time.

711
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,512
They need that because they're artists.

712
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,223
We're all just
a bunch of insecure bastards.

713
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,475
So you don't tell them how great they are,

714
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,020
you tell 'em
what you don't like about 'em.

715
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:18,606
Speak with authority.
Not only will they respect you,

716
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,985
but they'll believe
you're the only guy who can fix it.

717
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,660
-Why'd you come on this trip?
-What?

718
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,830
Don't tell me  it's about
this "Seven Sisters" or whoever.

719
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,708
Spare Sevens. Yeah, no. That's why.

720
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,966
And I guess there's part of me

721
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,178
that figured this was the last chance
I'd have to see you

722
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:52,349
and how you measure up against
the bastard I've hated all these years.

723
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,226
How am I doing?

724
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,146
You're holding your own.

725
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,859
You wanna know the sad part?

726
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,696
I've actually been trying.

727
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:18,750
<i>♪ Say your last hallelujah</i>♪

728
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:25,131
<i>♪ Fight with the great illusion</i> ♪

729
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:28,510
<i>♪ Wake up ♪</i>

730
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:33,223
<i>♪ Come on, take me home ♪</i>

731
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:37,268
-What do you think?
-I think they're good.

732
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,853
-What?
-I think they're good.

733
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,940
I think
they could use a new record label though.

734
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,525
I agree.

735
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,407
<i>♪ Wake up ♪</i>

736
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,869
<i>♪ Come on, take me home ♪</i>

737
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,046
So... what I was talkin' about earlier...

738
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,757
Thanks.

739
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:12,303
-Sorry. Matt, Matt. What were you saying?
-We're talking about creative control

740
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,056
and support
you're not going to find anywhere else.

741
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,767
I just don't think you should be singin'
for your supper.

742
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,479
We want to give you the space
to record the album

743
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,773
that the whole world is waiting for.

744
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,818
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

745
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,862
But, um...

746
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:33,616
I'm going to do that no matter where I am,
aren't I?

747
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:40,206
Yes, no, of course,
but what we're offering is...

748
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,002
Matt,
you've worked with some serious bands.

749
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,422
And some shit bands if I'm being honest.

750
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,091
A bit of this, a bit of that.

751
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,802
We're on a streak now.

752
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,473
Selling out shows, heavy rotation.

753
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,768
If it ain't broke, and all that.

754
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,438
-Right?
-Yeah. No. I, um...

755
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,524
I hear what you're saying.

756
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,571
Matt.

757
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,744
But it is broke, Jasper.

758
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,997
You just don't know it yet.

759
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,626
Or my hunch is... that maybe you do.

760
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,670
You did agree to meet with me
tonight, right?

761
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,797
-Yes or no?
-Yes.

762
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,383
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Well done.

763
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,345
So you were honest with me.
I'm gonna be honest with you.

764
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,889
I loved your guys' first record.

765
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,849
It was amazing.

766
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,019
Deserves every bit of recognition
that it got.

767
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,313
I worked out to it. I fucked to it.

768
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,732
It helped me get through my divorce.

769
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,360
Seriously. It's one of those.

770
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,612
It was incredible. Because it had balls.

771
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,448
It was unique. It was original.
It was yours.

772
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,244
Your second album, however, <i>Alibi</i>.

773
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,831
Ironically named, if you ask me,
'cause that thing is anything...

774
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,292
but your first album.

775
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,086
It is at best forgettable.

776
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,298
Teenagers make that music
with a fucking laptop.

777
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,176
They do.

778
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,680
I don't know whose idea it was
to put that dance track on there,

779
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,849
but I bet it wasn't any of you guys,
am I wrong?

780
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,686
You don't look at each other
when you play the new songs.

781
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:28,064
You just look out straight forward,
scanning the crowd for girls.

782
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,860
-You're embarrassed. I don't blame you.
-What's your point?

783
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,488
I think you're better than that.
That's all I'm saying.

784
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,490
'Cause you're an actual
fucking rock band.

785
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,702
Drums, guitar, bass, vocals.

786
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,788
Then you add all this other shit
you don't need.

787
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,416
You're selling albums, but to who?

788
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,960
People that pay attention
to fuckin' commercials.

789
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,798
I want you guys
to get back to what you do.

790
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:57,051
To reclaim what made
the Spare Sevens the Spare Sevens.

791
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,430
If you don't, you're just going to
be another casualty of the machine.

792
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:04,767
If I didn't believe this, if I didn't
believe in you, I wouldn't be here.

793
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:09,439
You have no fucking idea
what it took me to get here.

794
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,784
Fuck.

795
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,244
Fuck, man.

796
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:32,003
You've got a massive pair of balls on you,
don't you?

797
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,421
Yeah.

798
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,550
They make my dick look really small.

799
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:46,017
Okay, man.

800
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,312
Okay.

801
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,315
How do you see this working?

802
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,026
Glad you asked.

803
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,279
-I have to take a look at your contract.
-This geezer pissed himself.

804
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,074
This geezer pissed his pants!

805
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:09,248
Get the old codger a nappy.
Get him a diaper!

806
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,751
Shit!

807
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,836
Fucking hope not.

808
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,048
Get him out.

809
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,385
I don't even know what happened.

810
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,346
Sorry. Sorry, Matt.

811
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,556
What were you sayin'?

812
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,601
Matt?

813
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,020
Um...

814
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:38,277
You guys are newly famous, so by default
you're going to be assholes.

815
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,612
What?

816
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,908
The sad thing is there's a big part of me
that would still love to sign you.

817
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,540
But I can't even pretend
to have anywhere...

818
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,128
close to some type of respect
for any of you.

819
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,380
Um...

820
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:03,261
You know what? Thank you for the beer.

821
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,263
And good luck.

822
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,140
Matt.

823
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,096
I got it.

824
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,142
Here. Keep the change.

825
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,479
You're welcome.

826
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,150
I'll see you guys in a little bit,
all right?

827
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,695
-Where are you goin'?
-Just gonna take a few moments

828
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,280
to collect my thoughts.

829
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,700
By that, I mean I'm gonna
get fucked up across the street.

830
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,081
- Well, that was something?
- That was stupid.

831
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,419
What? He should have closed the deal.

832
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,755
He was defending you.

833
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,965
Don't put this on me. It wasn't my fault.

834
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,676
-That's not the point.
-I'm standing here in my own piss.

835
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,012
Maybe you could
try to get to the goddamn point.

836
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,349
The point is, you're gonna thank him
tonight, and you're gonna mean it.

837
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,477
Ben. Ben!

838
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,150
I... I can't do this anymore.

839
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,239
I love you, and you know that but...

840
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,034
you don't make it easy.
You make it virtually impossible.

841
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:53,204
But Matt, he's here for you.
It doesn't matter what he says.

842
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:57,041
He... He came on this trip for you.

843
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:02,421
You have done nothing to earn his love,
but tonight he gave it to you anyway.

844
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:07,468
And he did that for you,
and if you can't find it in yourself

845
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:11,013
to show your son.
just, like, an ounce of kindness,

846
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:15,059
then I... I can't...
I'm done defending you.

847
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,477
I can't be your nurse.

848
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,064
I don't know how to help you.

849
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,069
Are you done?

850
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:27,947
Yeah. Okay.

851
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:38,249
-What does that mean? "Okay."
-You're fired.

852
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,272
Is someone sitting here?

853
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:06,527
No. How's he doing?

854
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,412
He's overcome with gratitude.

855
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:21,334
- Really?
- No.

856
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,169
Nope. I need a drink.

857
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:24,879
Hey,

858
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:31,093
can I please get, like,
any semi-decent reposado on ice, please?

859
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,056
Let me ask you something. You were there.

860
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,726
It was happening, right?
Like before I had my little freak out?

861
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,979
-I had 'em, yeah?
-Yeah. You did.

862
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:47,568
-So I really screwed myself. Okay.
-That's not how I see it.

863
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,697
I appreciate that, but...

864
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,701
I don't know if you realize
what kind of opportunities are out there

865
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,328
for a guy like me at this point.

866
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,038
Like, a handful?

867
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:02,458
Zero... is the right answer.

868
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:07,046
Then, once word of this gets out,
it's gonna be even less.

869
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:14,053
-The word is officially out.
-And are you fired?

870
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,097
No. Not quite.

871
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,516
Apparently I'm "fried."

872
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,894
- Now I'm fired. There we go.
- Good.

873
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:26,482
- Don't laugh. At least you got a job.
- No. I was actually just fired too.

874
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,777
-You're joking.
-No. I'm not.

875
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:34,115
-What? Why?
-It's fine. He does it a lot actually.

876
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,828
-So, cheers to that.
-Cheers.

877
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,538
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Here we go.

878
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,085
-Want another one?
-No! God!

879
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,254
- If I had any more, I'd get surly.
- Yeah? -Yeah.
-I'd pay to see that. Are you sure?

880
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,883
Okay, well, that would be your funeral,
buddy.

881
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,179

01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,407

Hey.

911
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:24,827
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to the airport.

912
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:30,291
-What are you talkin' about?
-Yeah. This was a mistake.

913
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,252
No, it wasn't. Hey, slow down.

914
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,216
I've already called a nurse
to replace me and...

915
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,887
she should probably be here by breakfast.

916
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,265
Hey, Zooey. Come on. What is this?
What's goin' on here?

917
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,561
Hey, come on. You can't just leave.

918
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,147
-What about Ben?
-He fired me last night.

919
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,648
He fires you all the time.

920
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,526
-Yeah. Now I'm takin' him up on it.
-Okay, but why now?

921
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,112
-Why? What is going on?
-I can't do this, okay?

922
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,156
Do what? What are you talking about?

923
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,367
-I'm not going to hurt you.
-You don't know that.

924
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:08,871
Look. I get it, okay?
Your husband cheated on you.

925
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,247
I'm not him.

926
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:14,001
Okay, well, he didn't cheat on me.
I cheated on him.

927
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:18,505
And I couldn't even tell you why.
I went and fucked someone.

928
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:24,011
So what? So what? You made a mistake.

929
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:26,222
It was three years ago.
He was the wrong guy.

930
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,682
No. I am the wrong girl.

931
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,354
Zooey, what about, "Nothing good
comes from living in the past."

932
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:36,398
Yeah, and then you told me
I sounded like your ex-wife.

933
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,106
Ben. Hey.

934
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,617
Hello?

935
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:33,038
Thanks, man.  I appreciate it.
It will just take a second.

936
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,499
He's probably just in here. Hey, Ben?

937
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,629
Shit! Hey! Ben!

938
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,715
Ben! Are you okay?

939
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,509
Sir! Sir! Go get help! Please!

940
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,429
It's okay. You all right?

941
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,306
- This is Beta One, come in.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

942
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,684
-Will you get help?
-We have a possible Code Blue in 428.

943
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:54,893
It's okay.

944
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:24,673
So I checked in with Ben's oncologist
in New York and shared some blood work.

945
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:30,721
We can keep him comfortable, but at this
stage of cancer, that's all we can do.

946
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,766
Now we can arrange
for his transfer to hospice,

947
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,686
but I am afraid he will not be
able to travel back to New York.

948
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,733
We're actually on our way to... Kansas.

949
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,235
That's off the table.

950
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:47,946
Matt, your father is very weak,

951
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:52,910
and while we can keep him comfortable
here, he really doesn't have much longer.

952
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:54,953
I'm sorry.

953
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:58,374
I'll check back in in a little bit.

954
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,169
-Yeah. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

955
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,825
Coffee smells good.

956
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,245
Hey.

957
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,622
You want some?

958
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,691
How are you feeling?

959
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:10,696
I'm dying. That's how I'm feeling.

960
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,409
How long have I been here?

961
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,496
Like a day and a half... about.

962
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,126
Where's Zooey?

963
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:29,214
-She left.
-Is she gone?

964
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:35,429
I fired her before. It's the first time
she ever actually left.

965
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,684
Do me a favor. Don't tell her I'm here

966
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,895
She might blame herself.

967
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,855
Of course.

968
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,718
Need help?

969
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:07,646
-Goes in that little slot there.
-Yeah, I know. I remember.

970
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,983
Stretch it out. Nice and tight.

971
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,570
Line it up so the teeth will bite.

972
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,447
-Click it twice.
-That's right. Yeah.

973
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,033
Yep.

974
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,536
Good job.

975
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,712
I used to feed you.

976
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,506
What?

977
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:37,593
At night while your mother slept.

978
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,762
Give you the bottle.

979
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:50,731
We were staying in this crappy
little apartment, Lower East Side.

980
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:57,529
Then afterwards you'd lie...
you'd just lie there...

981
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,907
with your head on my chest.

982
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,578
You had this...

983
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:08,665
smell, you know,
the way babies smell.

984
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,627
And I would just...

985
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,212
I'd just hold you.

986
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,383
Feeling you breathe.

987
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,767
I'd make all these promises to you.

988
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:33,649
Tell you that I'd love you forever,

989
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,069
always keep you safe,

990
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:44,159
never let you feel alone.

991
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:51,708
I was just filled with this...

992
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:56,672
infinite love for you.

993
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:14,106
I don't know what happened to me,
what broke inside of me.

994
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,611
Maybe I was always broken. I don't know.

995
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:23,865
But those nights with you, if I could...

996
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:29,413
get to choose what time of my life
to live in forever, that would be it.

997
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:37,629
That would be it. And I'm not asking
you to forgive me. I don't deserve....

998
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,637
I just...

999
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:53,603
I love you.

1000
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,440
I do. I really do.

1001
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,069
And I'm sorry.

1002
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,679
It's okay.

1003
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,307
Go to sleep. Okay? You're tired.

1004
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:33,954
Knock, knock.

1005
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,498
What do you got there?

1006
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:38,291
Your getaway vehicle.

1007
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:43,046
If we're gonna get that film to Dwayne's,
we gotta drive through the night.

1008
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:45,674
Tomorrow is the last day
they're developing Kodachrome.

1009
01:20:46,132 --> 01:20:48,301
Never gonna let you take me out of here.

1010
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,303
That's why I'm not gonna ask.

1011
01:20:56,726 --> 01:20:59,855
It appears I got this tube in my dick.

1012
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:04,192
-Shit.
-It's all right. I can get it. I got it.

1013
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,153
What do you mean you can get it? No.
No, no, no, no. Hey!

1014
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:11,533
You can't pull out your own catheter!
Stop it! Stop it! That's crazy!

1015
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,076
God.

1016
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:15,871
Dad! Don't!

1017
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,918
Fuck you. Get dressed.

1018
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,963
-I got you.
-You did get me. Here.

1037
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:20,578
If you ask me,
they should stop making film every year.

1038
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:26,001
All right, I've got you in a single, king.

1039
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:30,630
No. No, we had... two rooms.
Separate rooms reserved.

1040
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:34,968
-Actually, three, but we only need two.
-I'm sorry. It's been insane.

1041
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:37,762
Just... we don't know
who's coming and who's going.

1042
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,056
Right now
all I've got is the one room.

1043
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,518
One sec.

1044
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,901
-We'll take it.
-Super.

1045
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:56,239
I should have it ready for you
in three or four hours.

1046
01:23:57,323 --> 01:23:59,576
-Super...
-Fuck you. That's fucking cra... Okay.

1047
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,536
That's great. That's great.

1048
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,832
Sorry. Long drive. That's great.

1049
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,377
Watch your step.

1050
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:17,385
-Hi.
-Hey.

1051
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:19,471
Um...

1052
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:24,684
Excuse me. I wanted to give these rolls
to Dwayne personally.

1053
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,897
I'm sorry.
We stopped taking Kodachrome yesterday.

1054
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:33,318
You what? No. I called to confirm.
We were told Thursday.

1055
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,863
I know. I'm sorry. We ran out of dye
sooner than expected.

1056
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:42,035
Come on. Look, we just drove
2,000 miles to get here. I just...

1057
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:44,329
-Where's Dwayne?
-Ben Ryder.

1058
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,289
-There he is.
-You made it.

1059
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,333
-How you doin'?
-Good to see you.

1060
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,961
Your assistant here just told me you're
not processing any more Kodachrome.

1061
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:54,839
-She's fired. You're fired.
-Okay, Dad.

1062
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,760
Honey, this is Benjamin Asher Ryder,

1063
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:01,221
one of the world's greatest
living photographers.

1064
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:03,389
How do you do? This is my son, Matt.

1065
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:05,391
-Matt, nice to meet you.
-You too.

1066
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:09,562
Well, Ben, I will process these myself.

1067
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:13,024
I left a little room in the line
on the off chance you made it.

1068
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,777
Yeah, I was countin' on it.
I appreciate it.

1069
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,030
Can you believe it? The end of an era.

1070
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:23,910
I will have these ready
for you to pick up tomorrow.

1071
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,830
-Okay. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1072
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,253
We could get food. You hungry?

1073
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:35,505
Yeah, I should put something
in my stomach.

1074
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:36,589
Yeah, same.

1075
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:40,593
I'm sorry. Aren't you Benjamin Ryder?

1076
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:43,388
-That's right.
-I don't believe it.

1077
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:47,183
I should have known you'd be here. I was
talking about you to Steve McCurry.

1078
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,935
I figured Steve would be here.

1079
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:52,230
-Ernie Coates from <i>National Geographic.</i>
-Ernie.

1080
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:55,400
You did that piece in Afghanistan,
didn't you? Yeah, that was great.

1081
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:56,401
Wow, you know...

1082
01:25:56,484 --> 01:26:01,239
At the risk of embarrassing you, you're
the reason I became a photographer.

1083
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:04,617
Why would that embarrass me?

1084
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:06,703
Marie, come here.

1085
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:13,042
-This is Benjamin Ryder.
-No way.

1086
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,377
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1087
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,838
A bunch of us were talking
about your Afghan series.

1088
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:20,466
Can you believe they're stopping it?
You must've been pretty pissed.

1089
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,720
No, not really.
A little sentimental, I guess, but...

1090
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:26,890
just a matter of time, you know.

1091
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:29,267
You know. Geez.

1092
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,979
We're all so... so frightened by time,

1093
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:35,481
and the way it moves on,
the way things disappear.

1094
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,192
That's why we're photographers.

1095
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,820
We're preservationists by nature.

1096
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:43,698
We take pictures to stop time,

1097
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:47,410
to commit moments to eternity.

1098
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:52,540
Human nature made tangible.

1099
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:58,046
About as good a definition of art as any,
I guess.

1100
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:01,758
Ben.
Rick Ross. We were in Grenada together.

1101
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:04,552
- We were shooting for Reuters.
- My God.

1102
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:08,973
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

1103
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,517
Ben,
do you mind if I get a picture with you?

1104
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:14,270
Would it matter if I did? I don't know.

1105
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,397
Sure. That's okay.

1106
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:21,653
-Aw, that's great.
-There you go.

1107
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:24,239
-Thank you.
-You all be well now.

1108
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,282
-You too, Ben.
-Good to see you.

1109
01:28:00,566 --> 01:28:02,193
Do you hear that?

1110
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:09,158
All right.

1111
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,371
What should we do this evening?

1112
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:18,626
We could go see what Parsons, Kansas
has in the way of nightlife.

1113
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,754
I could actually eat again.

1114
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:26,843
Don't know if they have room service here.
Should we get a pizza?

1115
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,679
Go to a restaurant? Order in?

1116
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:32,640
Hello? Any thoughts on the matter?

1117
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:56,914
Okay, Dad.

1118
01:28:58,708 --> 01:28:59,751

I'm sorry about Ben, Matt.

1131
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:57,535
I've been on the phone
with the medical examiner's office,

1132
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,620
tryin' to get the body released.

1133
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:02,832
Should be good to go shortly.

1134
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,169
-Thanks, Larry.
-Mr. Ryder.

1135
01:31:07,336 --> 01:31:09,213
Dwayne from Dwayne's Photo.

1136
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,632
Yes. Hi. I remember you.

1137
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:14,760
This is Larry Holdt.

1138
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:17,221
-Sure.
-Ben's manager.

1139
01:31:17,513 --> 01:31:21,726
I was...
very saddened to hear about your father.

1140
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,271
I wanted to deliver these personally.

1141
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:28,816
I know he was very protective of his work.

1142
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,905
Thank you. Yeah.
My dad would have appreciated it.

1143
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:37,116
Outside a roll I shot myself,

1144
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:41,454
these are the last rolls
of Kodachrome film ever to be developed.

1145
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:45,500
I think he would have liked the symmetry.

1146
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:48,836
Yeah.

1147
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:51,130
Take care.

1148
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:52,924
You too, Dwayne.

1149
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:01,516
- Here you go.
- No.

1150
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,560
Ben was very direct about it.

1151
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,813
He said you'd curate the show.

1152
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:13,444
I don't know anything about photography.
Why would he do that?

1153
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:17,657
I learned a long time ago
never to ask why where Ben was concerned.

1154
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,664
Hold on.

1155
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:28,251
Larry Holdt.

01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:06,497
<i>I've given up on so much stuff in my life.</i>

1163
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,917
<i>Playin' music and...</i>

1164
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:12,336
my marriage.

1165
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:15,131
Ben.

1166
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:21,262
I'm tired of doing it. I don't want to
do it anymore, and I'm not gonna. And...

1167
01:33:22,221 --> 01:33:24,140
Well, I want you to be...

1168
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:29,186
I'd love for you to be
one of the things I don't give up on.

1169
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,151
<i>All right, I'll hang up now.</i>

1170
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,948
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

1171
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,597
Let's see what all the buzz is about, Ben.

1172
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:37,977
Hey. Hey.

1173
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:42,731
Hey.

1174
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:48,445
How'd you know I'd be here?

1175
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,323
Larry.

1176
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:54,451
Yeah.

1177
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,996
I guess the guy really does
know everything?

1178
01:37:57,079 --> 01:37:58,581
Yeah.

1179
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:06,505

Yeah.

1181
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:20,978
