At least that's what
his profile says.

65
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:35,818
Are you dating
him or hiring him?

66
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,887
It's not a "date" date.

67
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,423
So where did you meet this
Tom or whatever his name is?

68
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,591
I haven't met him yet.

69
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:42,959
I'm going to meet him now.

You don't know
who you're meeting?

71
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,629
It's some guy I met online.

72
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,631
So, he could be
Tom the ax murderer.

73
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,966
Yes, dad, he could
be Tom the ax murderer.

74

But we're gonna meet
in a public place

75
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,536
and if he walks
in carrying an ax,

76
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:55,705
I promise I'll just
excuse myself and leave.

77
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,374
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Yes, I'm wearing underwear!

82
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:04,982

It is a date.

88
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:11,854
No, it's not a date.

89
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,590
It's a good idea when you meet
people online

90
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:14,590
to meet them in a public place

91
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:15,792

92

not going to kill you.

189
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:39,589
And you're a good dancer.

190
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:43,526
But I don't know
much else about you.

191
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,995
What exactly would
you like to know?

192
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:48,598
How did you end
up in California?

193
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,599
I got a full ride to
Stanford and I stayed.

194
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,569
So, you're smart.

195
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:56,209
I'm not Einstein
but smart enough.

196
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,175
I mean smart enough to work
at an internet start-up

197
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,176
but not smart enough yet to
make my own ideas happen.

198
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,178
But they'll happen.

199
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,546
What kind of ideas?

200
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:05,748
Apps and stuff.

201
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,586
Yeah, apps and stuff.

202
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,654
Are you sure we
haven't met before.

203
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:13,526
At a party or some event?

204
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,530
I don't think so.

205
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,298
And anyway, I remember feet.

206
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,166
They're the sexiest
part of a woman's body.

207
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,271
Well, in the top four anyway.

208
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,171
You dress them up in sexy shoes.

209
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:32,709
They're the beginning of
where a man wants to end.

210
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:33,709
And they're the
first part of a woman

211
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,114
that she'll give up freely.

212
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,915
Sounds like a fetish to me.

213
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,052
There are worse ones.

214
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,052
So, how about you?
Do you like nursing?

215
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,321
Oh, I love nursing.

216
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,791
Lot of blood and stuff?

217
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,259
Well, you get to help people.

218
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:51,761
You give shots?

219
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,028
Yeah.

220
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,930
Needles.

221
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:55,065
I hate needles.

222
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,200
(GIGGLES) Well,
what do you love?

223
00:08:58,202 --> 00:09:00,203
I don't know about love.

224
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,237
Oh, come on.

225
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,272
You must love something.

226
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:03,806
The word's over-hyped.

227
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:05,007
Okay, fine.

228
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,209
Skip love.

229
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,177
What do you like?

230
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:13,148
Like, love, work, fuck.

231
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,850
They're all dirty
four letter words.

232
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:18,387
I'm more of a
metaphysical kind of guy.

233
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:20,223
Metaphysical?

234
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:23,926
Well, maybe I meant physical.

235
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:27,198
(GIGGLES) Come on,
what do you like?

236
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,232
What do you like?

237
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,901
I like

238
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,970
mojitos and Frieda Kahlo.

239
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:36,973
Single malt and Stan Lee.

240
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,642
Chicago deep dish.

241
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,709
Pineapple.

242
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:40,977
Tennis.

243
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,212
Angry Birds.

244
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,113
There you go.

245
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,680
You do have likes.

246
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:46,416
Its not about what you
like or love in this life.

247
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:49,986
It's about what you want
and how you're gonna get it.

248
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:51,123
What do you want?

249
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,829
You are fast.

250
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,134

A what?

253
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:09,906
A condom. Protection.

254
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:10,906
Whatever.

255
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:12,242
A Jimmy hat?

256
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,946
Shut up!

257
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,778
It won't feel as good.

258
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,013
And anyway, I trust you.

259
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:20,849
Look, I'd like to fuck you.

260
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:21,950
I wanna fuck you.

261
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:23,085
But I'm not...

262
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,387
I'm pulling out
before I get there.

265
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:30,160
You want me to
go out and get one?

266
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,795
No I have one upstairs.

267
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,999
Come on.

268

to be the pussy police.

I don't feel good
about it either.

270
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:45,177
And I certainly don't want
to get Mr. Jimmy in trouble.

271
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:47,879
But I promise I'll
make it up to you.

told me your name was

and wore a hair net all day,

320

Yeah, it was.

My friend, Margie, introduced
us at a pool party.

332
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,257
We hooked up in her bathroom.

333
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:22,358
You asked me out
the next weekend

334
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,060
and we went back to your place.

335
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,494
I remember the dinner date.

336
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:26,662
There was none.

337
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,031
Take out at your place.

Fucking was our
evening entertainment.

00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,367
And then you disappeared.

Not so much as a text, a call,

341
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,671
a "sorry, we didn't click".

342
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,704
Nada!

343
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:36,571
I swear.

344
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:37,507
I don't remember.

345
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,878
No?

346
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,344
Maybe your hair was different?

347
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:42,578
No.

348
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,445
Did you lose weight?

349
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,180
No!

350
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:44,680
Gain weight?

351
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:46,114
Fuck you!

352
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:48,951
Hey! That was then, I
guess, and this is now.

353
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:50,719
And I bet you
enjoyed then and now.

354
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:52,588
I had no complaints then,

355
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,357
until about a week
later when I started

356
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:55,992
smelling like a wet dog.

357
00:14:55,994 --> 00:14:57,326
You gave me an STD.

358
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:58,294
All right.

359
00:14:58,296 --> 00:14:59,094
It couldn't have been me, I...

360
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,530
It was you!

361
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,031
Do you know how much a pain in
the ass it is to get treated?

362
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,334
Have you been treated?

363
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,701
Or are you still out
there spreading the cheer?

364
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:07,302
It wasn't me.

365
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:08,470
Really, it wasn't.

366
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,073
I really enjoyed last night.

367
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,044
I thought we clicked.

368
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:16,378
In fact I had plans
for a second date.

369
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,446
Plans.

370
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:18,583
What kind of plans?

371
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:21,283

You're looking for a
serious relationship,

375
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:30,193
I'm looking for a
serious relationship.

376
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,628
And I'm sorry about the name.

377
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,763
But come on, it's gonna take

378
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:37,201
more than one night of cuddling.

379
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,239
Come on.

380
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:47,613
It wasn't me.

381
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:50,248
Okay.

382
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,416
We'll forget this ever happened.

383
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:55,084
We'll start over.

384
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:56,455

388
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:11,666
What was the fuck was that?

389
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:12,502

You're fucking crazy.

391
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,438
I'm going to put this
on my Facebook page

wanna be upfront with you.

you can take a cab.

00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,475
Just go.

412
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,644

I'm gonna help you pee.

534
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,614
I can't pee sitting down
with you holding my dick.

535
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,017
Let me stand up and go.

536
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,552
Well, just try.

537
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,055
I can't think about peeing
with you holding my dick.

538
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:14,923
I'm a nurse.

539
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:17,795
Yeah, I know you're a nurse.

540
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:21,732

forget about all this.

clothes off, I take mine

543
00:23:27,704 --> 00:23:29,604
and we start off
where we left off.

to fuck me again.

00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,805
I'm going to jump in
the pool and drown myself.

742
00:32:57,807 --> 00:33:00,208
You're not gonna jump in
the pool and drown yourself.

743
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:00,808
Why not?

744
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,677
Why the hell not?!

745
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:03,812
Because if you
jump into the pool

746
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:04,779
you're not going to drown.

747
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,213
You're going to freeze to death

748
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:07,548
and I'm going to freeze
coming in after you.

749
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,784
Come on back inside.

750
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,053
Mom, it's gonna be okay.

751
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,653
Oh, really. You think so?

752
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:14,322
Look, It should not be a crime

753
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:17,526
to treat someone who's
just giving STD's

754
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,327
willy nilly to all women
all through the universe.

755
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:22,229
No.

756
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:24,266
He is not nice person.

757
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,167
You're right.

758
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,802
Come on, let's go inside.

759
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,536
And the fact that
"he's not a nice person"

760
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:30,104
is not a good enough
reason to have the guy

761
00:33:30,106 --> 00:33:32,106
all plastered up upstairs.

762
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:33,141
Who's side are you on, Bill?

763
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:34,342
I'm on Carly's
side, of course.

764
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:35,610
But this is not right.

765
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:37,813
Dad, I know it's not right.

766
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,481
But there must be a
way to make it right.

767
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:42,517
I don't know.

768
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,785
You're not involved.

769
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:45,152
Of course we're involved.

770
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:47,255
You're keeping a man
prisoner in our home.

771
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:49,690
But if he never sees you,
he'll never know you're here.

772
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:51,596
Oh, great logic.

773
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,363
I want you to leave again.

774
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:57,766
Go back to Vegas.

775
00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,468
It'll give me some time to
figure this out on my own.

776
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,803
We're not leaving you
until we all figure you

777
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:03,408
away out of this mess.

778
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,713
I deal with scumbags
all the time.

779
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:14,849
Lying buyers, sellers,
appraisers, bankers.

780
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:17,885
Laurie, this is not a real
estate transaction gone wrong.

781
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:18,820
Thank you.

782
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:19,787
I know that.

783
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:20,722
But it's business.

784
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,590
In business you make deals.

785
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,858
You compromise.
There are options.

786
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,728
Let's just think,
think for options.

787
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,597
If we let him go, he'll
most likely go to the police.

788
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,565
I would.

789
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,365
Bill.

790
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:32,601
No, Dad's right.

791
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,903
We have to think
logically, not emotionally.

792
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:37,238
When he wakes up, we'll
try to reason with him.

793
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,576
And if he decides to
go to the police, well,

794
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,479
I'll just have to hire
a really good lawyer.

795
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,615
That's your
solution, a lawyer?

796
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,217
Well, what options are
you thinking about, Laurie?

797
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:49,885
The drowning option?

798
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,318
The freezing option?

799
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,090
Or the option to buy our house?

800
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,494
You could accuse him first.

801
00:34:57,793 --> 00:35:02,863
Go to the police and accuse
him of rape or something.

802
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:04,465
Rape, rape.

803
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,666
That's a good idea!

804
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,635
Finally you've come
up with a great idea.

805
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:08,903
No, I can't.

806
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:10,604
After all the "he says,
she says" dies down,

807
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:11,873
you can recant.

808
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:12,874
You've made mistakes.

809
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:14,309
He's made mistakes.

810
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:16,478
There's no moral high
ground here, right?

811
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,612
I can't!

812
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:18,746
Why not?

813
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:21,782
Because after
we slept together

814
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:24,586
and before all of this happened,

815
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:26,824
I may have texted a few friends.

816
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,191
So?

817
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,894
So, I may have told
them he was good in bed.

818
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,262
Carly.

819
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:36,264
At least I didn't
post any pictures.

820
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:38,735
Thank God for that
little blessing.

821
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,769
Okay.

822
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,206
What else?

823
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,286
We're not killing anybody.

824
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:00,287
No.

825
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:01,623
No. No.

826
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,624
Okay.

827
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,295
Oh God, I can't think.

828
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:07,431
We don't want to
do anything rash.

829
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,233
I'm going to bed.

830
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:13,434
We'll think about this
more in the morning.

831
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:15,737
Bill, how can you sleep?

832
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:16,972
It's late.

833
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,673
It was a long drive
back from Vegas.

834
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:20,278
I'm exhausted.

835
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:22,711
We'll get some rest.

836
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,577
And we'll think more
clearly. Come on.

837
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:24,813
Yeah, dad's right.

838
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,280
At least we know
he's not gonna get up

839
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:27,916
and walk out the front door?

840
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:29,519
No, he can't.

841
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,322
I'll be right back.

842
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:35,856
Wait, where are you going?

843
00:36:35,858 --> 00:36:37,258
I haven't fed him yet.

844
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,729
He'll wake up soon and
I promised him pizza.

845
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,731
And if he starts yelling,
don't go in there.

846
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,766
And if he does
yell, don't worry.

847
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:47,001
He's okay.

848
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:51,606
He's got food and water
and the remote control.

849
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:53,244
All the comforts of home.

850
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:02,453
(FOREBODING MUSIC)

851
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,630
Hey, where are you going?

852
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:17,065
I'm going in there and
try to reason with him.

853
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,900
She told you not
to go in there.

854
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:20,434
What have you got
in your pocket?

855
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:21,536
Nothing.

856
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:22,806
What have you
got in your pocket?

857
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,541
Don't go nutsy on me again.

858
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:27,309
I don't care.

859
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,043
I'll go to jail.

860
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,610
I'll take the blame for this.

861
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:31,045
But we are going to come up
with a sensible solution.

862
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:32,046
You're more tired than I am.

863
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:33,481
You're not making any sense.

864
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,349
Come back to bed.

865
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:36,318
Come on.

866
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,651
Don't you see?

867
00:37:37,653 --> 00:37:38,987
This punk is going to
ruin our daughter's life.

868
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:40,521
I'm her mother.

869
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:41,588
I'm not going to just stand
by and watch that happen.

870
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,057
Come back to bed.

871
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:44,492
Take another pill.

872
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:45,327
Another pill?

873
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:45,927
Yeah.

874
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:46,728
Okay.

875
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,733
Okay, here we go.

876
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,532
Get off me!

877
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:53,400
This is a situation.

878
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:56,037
No, no, no, no, no.

879
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,541
No.

880
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,815
You think he has parents?

881
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,583
I'm sure of it.

882
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:09,883
No, you know what I mean.

883
00:38:09,885 --> 00:38:13,921
Parents, living,
worried about him?

884
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:15,990
I've got more to worry
about my own daughter.

885
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:17,559
I don't need to be
worrying about his parents.

886
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,392
Come on!

887
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:19,697
Before he wakes up.

888
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,569
We could bury
him in the backyard

889
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,104
where you wanted to
build your barbecue.

890
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:32,442
You are so taking
your medication.

891
00:38:34,043 --> 00:38:35,779
So, I can build my barbecue?

892
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,461
You know, eventually you're
going to have to let me go.

893
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,128
I mean, we're not going to spend

894
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,333
the rest of our lives
together like this.

895
00:38:57,534 --> 00:38:58,465
What do you think?

896
00:38:58,467 --> 00:38:59,633
The more time we spend together,

897
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:02,604
we're just gonna get comfortable
with each other and this,

898
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,974
this situation.

899
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:08,610
Pretty soon, I'm gonna go
from a cast to handcuffs;

900
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,644
from pizza to your beef stew.

901
00:39:10,646 --> 00:39:12,514
And one day you'll lead
me downstairs on a leash

902
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,884
to meet the folks.

903
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:16,950
Maybe you think
I'm gonna succumb

904
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:18,686
to some Stockholm
syndrome or something?

905
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:20,921
'Cause it's not going to happen.

906
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:22,157
You're fucked.

907
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,858
And the longer I'm here
the more fucked you are.

908
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,025
How do you know I'm
not going to cut you up

909
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:27,097
into little pieces and
feed you to my dog?

910
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:30,164
Have another slice of pizza.

911
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,469
Max likes a lot of
meat on his bones.

912
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:36,204
All right, you can
pretend some type of female

913
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,807
Hannibal Lecter, but you're not.

914
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,909
In the end, I go home
and you go to jail

915
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,813
or the nut house maybe.

916
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,449
People are gonna ask about me.

917
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,849
Somebody's going
to notice my car

918
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:50,083
sitting at the club all night.

919
00:39:50,085 --> 00:39:51,686
People are gonna start
asking questions.

920
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:54,856
And, eventually, in a few hours,

921
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:57,925
a few days maybe, the
cop's gonna be knocking

922
00:39:57,927 --> 00:39:59,927
on your front door.

923
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:02,996
You have been watching
way too much television.

924
00:40:02,998 --> 00:40:06,099
I have a feeling
nobody cares about you.

925
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:07,601
I mean, how long could
it take to replace

926
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:09,103
a supermarket deli man?

927
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:10,070
I'm not a deli man.

928
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:11,005
I'm a baker.

929
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,673
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

930
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,644
Butcher, baker,
candlestick maker.

931
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:17,545
You know, the more you talk,

932
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:18,849
the uglier you get.

933
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,684
So who's here?

934
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,686
You know.

935
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,621
Your parents.

936
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,425
Your whole family can't
be as crazy as you.

937
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,724
Maybe somebody here has
got have some sense.

938
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:34,095
If you yell and wake
anybody up, I swear.

939
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:35,662
Okay, I won't. I won't.

940
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:36,800
Just don't tug on the catheter.

941
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,175
I didn't say you had
to move your hand.

942
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:52,546
So what did you

943
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:53,717
tell your friends?

944
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,916
You know after that night.

945
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:57,086
What do you mean?

946
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:01,255
You know after you
came the first time,

947
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:02,590
you went to the bathroom.

948
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:04,659
And you tweeted or
texted somebody.

949
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,130
You are so vain.

950
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,665
What?

951
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:15,135
Women talk.

952
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:16,706
I know women talk.

953
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:19,541
You guys love to talk.

954
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,178
At the weirdest times too.

955
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:24,278
You know the story
always went that guys

956
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,847
talked about their conquests.

957
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,550
I never did.

958
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,717
I mean my friends
would get together

959
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,019
and somebody would talk
about who they're dating

960
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,854
or if they were fucking
somebody but nobody

961
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:35,893
got very graphic
about their business.

962
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:41,329
I bet the size and width of
my dick is online right now.

963
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,630
Yeah.

964
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:44,034
That's why it had to be a tweet.

965
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:48,336
Did you turn the faucet on
when you went to the bathroom

966
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,704
'cause you didn't want
me to hear you pee.

967
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:53,641
You know, I know women
pee, for Christ sake.

968
00:41:53,643 --> 00:41:54,911
Shut up.

969
00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:00,180
What are you doing?

970
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:02,182
I'm going to bed.

971
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:03,784
You're going to sleep
here? In this bed.

972
00:42:03,786 --> 00:42:05,052
It's my room.

973
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:06,086
My bed.

974
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:07,625
Don't you usually sleep naked?

975
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,324
Usually.

976
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,925
But not with you here.

977
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:13,530
How the fuck do you sleep?

978
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:17,664
Usually I wear underwear
but that's so I can jack off

979
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:18,700
at a moment's notice.

980
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,333
Oh my God.

981
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:20,969
You are so disgusting.

982
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:25,940
Oh, little Miss Sunshine with
the vibrator in the drawer.

983
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:28,008
Shut up.

984
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,677
Now, I feel sorry for you.

985
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,282
It's going to be a bitch
smuggling this thing into prison.

986
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:39,156
Good night, Carly.

987
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:50,264
Here.

988
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:51,699
Take it.

989
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:52,700
What do I do with this?

990
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:54,101
You put it in the catheter,

991
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:55,670
withdraw the fluid
in the balloon,

992
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:57,871
and pull it out.

993
00:42:57,873 --> 00:42:59,173
Pull it out?

994
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:00,108
Yeah.

995
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,974
I put it in.

996
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:02,312
You pull it out.

997
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:05,912
What are we
talking about here?

998
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:08,117
Oh my God, the catheter.

999
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:26,637
That's nice.

1000
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,983
Thank you.

1001
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,150
Did you sleep?

1002
00:43:43,152 --> 00:43:44,818
Not very well.

1003
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,755
I was up all night
keeping an eye on you.

1004
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:49,791
I know. I'm sorry.

1005
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,092
I shouldn't drink at night.

1006
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:52,360
Oh, it was the wine, huh?

1007
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:53,731
Yeah.

1008
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:00,735
I hid the gun.

1009
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:02,302
Okay.

1010
00:44:02,304 --> 00:44:03,905
Where?

1011
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,373
I wasn't going to do anything.

1012
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,708
I just wanted to scare him.

1013
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,208
You scare me.

1014
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,911
My daughter scares me.

1015
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,179
What are you going
to do about it, Bill?

1016
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,447
I don't know.

1017
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,847
It's all gone.

1018
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,016
What?

1019
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:16,784
All of our hopes
and dreams for Carly.

1020
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:17,751
They're gone.

1021
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:18,351
What are you talking about?

1022
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:19,320
We'll work this out.

1023
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:21,255
Carly's still a wonderful girl.

1024
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:23,257
She worked hard to make
herself a successful career.

1025
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:24,925
She has lots of friends.

1026
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:25,860
She's attractive.

1027
00:44:25,862 --> 00:44:28,028
She has lots of dates.

1028
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,930
She'll find someone she likes.

1029
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:30,764
That.

1030
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:31,499
All that what you said.

1031
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,803
It's gone.

1032
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,170
I should just shoot myself.

1033
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:38,338
You're going down that
dead end road again.

1034
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,507
I can't help it.

1035
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:40,775
There's no solution.

1036
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:42,943
There's a solution.

1037
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:45,012
I just haven't
thought of it yet.

1038
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:48,152
Are you going to be all
right with him here?

1039
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:51,452
I'm fine.

1040
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:54,088
Okay, I'm out of here.

1041
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,093
Don't do anything nutsy.

1042
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:13,076
(DOORBELL RINGING)

1043
00:45:16,211 --> 00:45:17,144
Who is it?

1044
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:18,179
Oh, God. I forgot.

1045
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,180
Monday morning is mahj.

1046
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:20,914
Help!

1047
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:21,414
Anybody! I'm...

1048
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:22,516
Shut up!

1049
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:24,084
Who's coming?

1050
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:26,123
Ruth and Mindy
and your Aunt Cindy.

1051
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:29,322
I won't answer.

1052
00:45:29,324 --> 00:45:30,258
Upstairs.

1053
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,224
But they know you're here.

1054
00:45:31,226 --> 00:45:32,360
Help, anybody!

1055
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,994
Just give me a
minute and then answer.

1056
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:34,528
Please.

1057
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,362
Are you sure?

1058
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:36,496
I can handle this.

1059
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:38,267
Please, I'm upstairs.

1060
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:52,079
Are we playing Maj
or going clubbing?

1061
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:53,146
I grew up with her.

1062
00:45:53,148 --> 00:45:54,014
I was invisible.

1063
00:45:54,016 --> 00:45:55,282
She's a man magnet.

1064
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:57,487
So, are we gonna play or what?

1065
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,298
♪ I fell into electric blue

1066
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:12,867
♪ I'm back to school

1067
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:14,171
Can you hear me?

1068
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:16,903
Hey!

1069
00:46:16,905 --> 00:46:18,041
Aw!

1070
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:27,280
Hey!

1071
00:46:27,282 --> 00:46:28,317
Hey.

1072
00:46:49,938 --> 00:46:51,240
Sorry about that.

1073
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:54,244
I won't do it again.

1074
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:00,250
So, who's here?

1075
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,153
Do you hear me?

1076
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:10,391
Yes, I hear you.

1077
00:47:10,393 --> 00:47:11,829
Somebody's here.

1078
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,998
You know I'm very sociable.

1079
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,068
Come on.

1080
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:20,233
Introduce me to your mother.

1081
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:21,034
Mothers love me.

1082
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:22,103
I'm a potential.

1083
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,970
A potential what?

1084
00:47:23,972 --> 00:47:26,606
What do you think? A potential
seed for the grand kids.

1085
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:28,077
Bad seed.

1086
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:31,012
So whose helmets?

1087
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,914
Who rides?

1088
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,682
My dad.

1089
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:36,450
I've got a Harley.

1090
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:38,084
A fat boy.

1091
00:47:38,086 --> 00:47:38,920
Really?

1092
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,954
It's all tricked out.

1093
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:42,490
Lots of chrome, Custom paint.

1094
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,194
It's a beauty.

1095
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:47,295
No, I don't have a Harley.

1096
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,396
I don't have a bike.

1097
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:50,664
More lies.

1098
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:53,103
But you liked that
image, didn't you.

1099
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:58,139
Just for a moment,
you tell the truth.

1100
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,242
You were imagining
yourself straddling my hog

1101
00:48:01,244 --> 00:48:03,411
cruising down the coast highway,

1102
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,282
that exciting vibration
between your legs.

1103
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,389
Why do you have to
be anything you're not?

1104
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,291
Am I any different from you?

1105
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:17,460
You pretend.

1106
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,563
A make-up, those push up bras,

1107
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:25,231
tight short dresses,
those come fuck me shoes.

1108
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:26,300
What are you pretending to be?

1109
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:28,302
It is not the same.

1110
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:30,170
I'm not lying about myself.

1111
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:33,441
I'm making myself,
myself look better.

1112
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,175
You're making up a
whole different person.

1113
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:37,177
It's my make-up.

1114
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:39,315
When I'm comfortable with
somebody, I take it off.

1115
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,985
What's the longest
relationship you've ever had?

1116
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:47,121
I mean I know you're good
at one night stands but

1117
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:49,126
have you ever
gotten past a week?

1118
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:52,659
You sound like my shrink.

1119
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:54,327
You see a shrink?

1120
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:55,362
Really?

1121
00:48:55,364 --> 00:48:57,197
For 15 years.

1122
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:58,599
Wait a minute.

1123
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:01,034
That means you've been seeing
a shrink since high school?

1124
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:02,737
A troubled soul.

1125
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,606
If I didn't go to therapy
every day after school,

1126
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:07,508
I would have had to play soccer

1127
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,478
or basketball or baseball
and I hated all that shit.

1128
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,113
My after-school program was
listening to my psychiatrist

1129
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:16,385
convince me how my
parents fucked up my life.

1130
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,121
"Do you think your
parents liked your brother

1131
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,789
"better than you?

1132
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:24,624
"Do you think you would have
rather been born a girl?

1133
00:49:24,626 --> 00:49:28,295
"If your cock was a pen,
what color would the ink be?"

1134
00:49:28,297 --> 00:49:31,534
Maybe Dr. Gupta's brainwashing
is what fucked up my life.

1135
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:36,369
You're making all
this up, aren't you?

1136
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:37,405
Check my wallet.

1137
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,343
Dr. Gupta from Encino.

1138
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,745
I'm through playing
games with your Carly.

1139
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:47,384
Look where it's gotten me.

1140
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:54,688
Your parents know I'm
up here, don't they?

1141
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,423
I've had men over before.

1142
00:49:56,425 --> 00:49:57,458
They treat me like an adult.

1143
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,758
They don't ask, I don't tell.

1144
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,128
So, your parents don't
know you have a man

1145
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,430
set in plaster in your bed?

1146
00:50:03,432 --> 00:50:05,099
No.

1147
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:06,800
Okay.

1148
00:50:06,802 --> 00:50:09,302
So what about you, huh?

1149
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:12,174
Have you ever had a
serious relationship?

1150
00:50:14,242 --> 00:50:15,575
I mean, not a one night stand,

1151
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:19,016
or a weekend relationship
for a couple of months,

1152
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,249
or high-school puppy
love where you write

1153
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:24,284
the guys name down
a thousand times

1154
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:27,454
or mention him to your
friends as "the one,"

1155
00:50:27,456 --> 00:50:30,226
to make some make-believe
love seem real?

1156
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,301
Or, do you cast all
your men in plaster?

1157
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,711
Hey, don't worry about it.

1158
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,381
Really.

1159
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:55,251
I see you getting
married some day.

1160
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:57,454
I do.

1161
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,499
And then shooting your husband.

1162
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,834
Fuck you.

1163
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:15,836
Where you going?

1164
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:17,274
See you later.

1165
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:19,776
I'll be here.

1166
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:30,251
Flower.

1167
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,217
Wait a minute.

1168
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:32,621
I'll take that.

1169
00:51:34,222 --> 00:51:37,360
Did you hear that Barbara's
gonna have another grandchild?

1170
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:39,592
Nine dot.

1171
00:51:39,594 --> 00:51:40,594
Red.

1172
00:51:40,596 --> 00:51:42,362
I'm going broke buying gifts.

1173
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:45,199
Graduation gifts, bridal
showers, wedding gifts.

1174
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,766
Well, you've had your share.

1175
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:47,901
I'm the barren one here.

1176
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:48,903
Seven dot.

1177
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,771
Is Carly dating anyone?

1178
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:52,505
We're having some problems
with Carly right now.

1179
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:53,574
What kind of problems?

1180
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:55,275
I don't want to talk about it.

1181
00:51:55,277 --> 00:51:56,409
Four crack.

1182
00:51:56,411 --> 00:51:57,378
Men of course.

1183
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,811
Cindy, what do you know?

1184
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:00,648
What other kinds of
problems could she be having?

1185
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,215
Well, you know
everything, don't you?

1186
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:03,918
My daughter is not a
topic of discussion.

1187
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,485
She is off the table.

1188
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:06,387
Oh, come on.

1189
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,787
Carly's a wonderful girl.

1190
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:09,490
She'll find someone.

1191
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:10,791
Joker.

1192
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:12,626
She'll meet a nice
doctor, you'll see.

1193
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:13,693
Oh my God!

1194
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,362
I don't want to talk about this.

1195
00:52:15,364 --> 00:52:16,697
Flower.

1196
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:18,499
Well we know she's had
her share of issues but...

1197
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:19,532
Can't you not hear?

1198
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:20,668
I don't want to discuss it.

1199
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,403
It's no crime being
single nowadays.

1200
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:24,704
Maybe it should be.

1201
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,807
If you're not married
by thirty, go to jail.

1202
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:28,275
That's crazy.

1203
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:28,943
Who would go to jail?

1204
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:30,211
The guys or the girls?

1205
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,345
Both.

1206
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:32,378
It would be a new game.

1208

(LAUGHTER)

1209
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:36,916
Is that what you want?

1210
00:52:36,918 --> 00:52:38,918
Is that what you want? You
want my Carly to go to jail?

1211
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,623
Just joking, sis.

1212
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:43,423
Six dot.

1213
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:44,825
Oh! Mahj!

1214
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:45,793
Look at this.

1215
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,695
Oh, yes.

1216
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,295
Every time.

1217

(BUBBLY MUSIC)

1218
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,378
Could you get me a washcloth?

1219
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,349
I was sweating to hell in there.

1220
00:53:18,793 --> 00:53:20,461
Let go.

1221
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,862
Let go!

1222
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:24,331
We really need to talk.

1223
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,566
Okay, this isn't going where
either of us wanted to go.

1224
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:29,769
And there was some chemistry
the other night, wasn't there?

1225
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:31,371
I mean, it wasn't just fucking.

1226
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:33,209
No. I think it
was just fucking.

1227
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,778
What the fuck!

1228
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,882
It was a kiss.

1229
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,382
I'm not playing your game.

1230
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,219
One more time and you'll
tell me this is a game.

1231
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,287
I know you think I'm a phony.

1232
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:47,920
And maybe I am.

1233
00:53:47,922 --> 00:53:49,225
But not completely.

1234
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:51,691
I liked you.

1235
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:52,862
I really did.

1236
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,233
Carly, I think you're beautiful.

1237
00:53:58,067 --> 00:54:01,534
I just don't think
beautiful women will like me

1238
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:03,305
unless I make things up.

1239
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:09,309
And it wasn't me
that gave you an STD.

1240
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:10,644
It wasn't.

1241
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:12,512
You don't get those
things from toilet seats.

1242
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:13,447
I know.

1243
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:14,782
But maybe it was something else.

1244
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:18,855
Or somebody else.

1245
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:25,825
I'm dying in here.

1246
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:27,094
You've got to cut this part off.

1247
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:28,764
It itches like crazy.

1248
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:50,416
Gotta pee.

1249
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:51,487
Oh my God.

1250
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:55,822
Is that it?

1251
00:54:55,824 --> 00:54:56,824
Yeah. A little deeper.

1252
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:57,691
A little lower.

1253
00:54:57,693 --> 00:54:58,858
Yeah.

1254
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,394
Ahh!

1255
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:01,095
You're almost there.

1256
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:01,894
Almost there.

1257
00:55:01,896 --> 00:55:02,829
Oh, fuck it.

1258
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:04,067
Be careful. Be careful.

1259
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:07,900
Oh, you're right there. Aw!

1260
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:09,438
Hold your balls to the side.

1261
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:12,840
Oh!

1262
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,744
You're right there.

1263
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:20,481
Yes.

1264
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,414
- Yes!
- It's nothing.

1265
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:22,416
Let's go to lunch.

1266
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:23,717
Just like that.

1267
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:24,485
- Wait.
- Oh.

1268
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,686
No way. Wait.

1269
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:30,090
Oh, you're right there.

1270
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:31,927
You've done this
before, haven't you?

1271
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:36,063
Ooh, yeah, that's it.

1272
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:37,898
Ow, ow, ow.

1273
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,532
I said put your
balls to the side.

1274
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:40,900
Okay.

1275
00:55:40,902 --> 00:55:42,603
Oh, right there. Right
there. Right there.

1276
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:43,737
You got it. You got it.

1277
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,773
Oh.

1278
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,907
Harder. Harder.

1279
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:49,378
Oh that's perfect.

1280
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:52,746
We never had that
kind of fun growing up.

1281
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:53,746
It's nothing.

1282
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:55,351
He has a great HMO.

1283
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:04,758
Carly, what are you
doing with that boy?

1284
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,925
What do you mean?

1285
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:07,994
She means he's not a sex toy.

1286
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:09,195
I didn't mean that.

1287
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:11,597
I have no objections
to men as sex toys.

1288
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:12,900
Cindy!

1289
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,735
Aunt Cindy, I didn't mean
for you to get involved.

1290
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:15,702
I'm family.

1291
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:16,903
I can't be uninvolved.

1292
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:18,539
What was going on it there?

1293
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,639
Nothing's going on.

1294
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:20,840
He had an itch.

1295
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:22,775
You've got to scratch
a man's itch, Laurie.

1296
00:56:22,777 --> 00:56:24,778
Lord knows, I've
scratched my share.

1297
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,512
What is he thinking?

1298
00:56:26,514 --> 00:56:30,684
He's thinking how he can
talk me into cutting him loose.

1299
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:31,918
He kissed me.

1300
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,052
Oh?

1301
00:56:33,054 --> 00:56:34,487
All bound up like
that, he kissed you?

1302
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:35,655
It's his game.

1303
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:37,624
Don't let that
boy toy with you.

1304
00:56:37,626 --> 00:56:39,095
He's not toying with me.

1305
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,729
Laurie?

1306
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:44,798
Could you get some
more iced tea?

1307
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,969
Sure.

1308
00:56:53,074 --> 00:56:55,943
I really fucked up
this time, Aunt Cindy.

1309
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,244
Nonsense.

1310
00:56:57,246 --> 00:56:58,847
Men are scum.

1311
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:04,550
Even your Uncle Harry, may
he rest in peace, was scum.

1312
00:57:04,552 --> 00:57:06,653
I spent tens of thousands
of dollars trying to

1313
00:57:06,655 --> 00:57:09,222
look like the the 20 somethings
he was chasing after.

1314
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:12,492
Then the 30 somethings
and 40 somethings.

1315
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:14,463
I was always a decade behind.

1316
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:18,197
So, where did you meet this boy?

1317
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:19,532
At a club.

1318
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:21,101
You never wanna
first meet a man

1319
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:23,106
in the dark with alcohol.

1320
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:27,708
I know it's routine but
it's a recipe for disaster.

1321
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,512
Now, I may look old to you
but I am a modern woman.

1322
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,246
I look for love online.

1323
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:35,648
But you got to know
how to play the game.

1324
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,184
If a guy says he's 50, he's 60.

1325
00:57:38,186 --> 00:57:41,722
If he's 60, he's 70.

1326
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,092
But you know what they call me?

1327
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:45,995
A Boomer Hottie.

1328
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:47,994
That's right.

1329
00:57:47,996 --> 00:57:50,898
Your aunt is still a hottie.

1330
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,900
I used to keep just only
condoms and lube in my purse,

1331
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:56,802
but now I keep a little
bottle of these devils

1332
00:57:56,804 --> 00:58:00,641
in case some guy wants to
take me over Viagra Falls.

1333
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,012
Oh! Aunt Cindy!

1334
00:58:04,746 --> 00:58:05,945
What?!

1335
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:06,979
You're disgusted that
an old woman like me

1336
00:58:06,981 --> 00:58:09,615
still likes to screw?

1337
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:12,188
Honey, you're gonna
be me one day.

1338
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:16,289
With this luck, who knows
if I'll ever get laid again.

1339
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:18,325
Getting laid is the easy part.

1340
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:19,793
Finding someone you
wanna wake up with

1341
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:22,565
in the morning,
that's the bugger.

1342
00:58:27,268 --> 00:58:29,570
You know what?

1343
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,037
You need to breath.

1344
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,805
To unstress.

1345
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:34,173
Go shopping.

1346
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:35,342
You like shopping.

1347
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:37,311
My sister likes shopping.

1348
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,811
I'll keep an eye on things here.

1349
00:58:38,813 --> 00:58:41,014
I really don't
want you involved.

1350
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:41,981
Who's involved?

1351
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:44,684
I'm just watching the house.

1352
00:58:44,686 --> 00:58:45,889
Go.

1353
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,106
Oh, thank God.

1354
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:07,206
Are you Carly's mother?

1355
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,809
I'm her aunt.

1356
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:09,809
It doesn't matter.

1357
00:59:09,811 --> 00:59:10,776
Look, you got to help me.

1358
00:59:10,778 --> 00:59:11,912
You got to cut me out of this.

1359
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:13,045
I think with a heavy
scissors we can...

1360
00:59:13,047 --> 00:59:15,551
She's a lovely
girl, don't you think?

1361
00:59:17,385 --> 00:59:19,221
I know what you're thinking.

1362
00:59:20,688 --> 00:59:23,826
You want to say the c-word.

1363
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,730
I would too if I was
all bound up like you.

1364
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,967
But from what I understand,

1365
00:59:32,768 --> 00:59:34,237
you're not completely
innocent here.

1366
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:37,170
I slept with her.

1367
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:38,639
That is all.

1368
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:39,706
That's all?

1369
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:40,374
That's all!

1370
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,708
What the fuck!

1371
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:42,708
You've got to get
me out of here.

1372
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,809
Have a drink.

1373
00:59:43,811 --> 00:59:44,744
I don't want
anything to drink.

1374
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:46,213
Just help me get out of this.

1375
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,115
You look hot.

1376
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:50,717
Have a drink.

1377
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,786
Cool down.

1378
00:59:52,788 --> 00:59:55,057
Maybe we can work something out.

1379
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:02,164
There.

1380
01:00:03,264 --> 01:00:04,766
So now what?

1381
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:09,001
You know, I have never
seen a relationship problem

1382
01:00:09,003 --> 01:00:11,371
where the fault
was all one sided.

1383
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:13,874
Well, you're looking at
Mr. Faultless, right now.

1384
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,242
How old are you?

1385
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,177
I'm 28.

1386
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:18,278
Not 38?

1387
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,278
No!

1388
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,479
Huh.

1389
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:23,115
I guess men tell the truth about
their age until they're 30.

1390
01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:24,284
Okay.

1391
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:25,184
You have to call the
police or something

1392
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:26,853
or you're just as involved.

1393
01:00:26,855 --> 01:00:28,992
I don't know about that.

1394
01:00:31,025 --> 01:00:33,894
If I was every called
upon to say anything,

1395
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:35,362
I would just tell them

1396
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:38,432
I didn't want to get involved
in the kinky sexcapades

1397
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,965
of the younger generation.

1398
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:41,300
This isn't any kinky sex.

1399
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:43,038
I'm being held here
against my will.

1400
01:00:47,108 --> 01:00:48,708
What are you doing?

1401
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,146
Just checking to see if
the cast covered everything.

1402
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,818
You're a baker?

1403
01:00:58,186 --> 01:01:00,954
You can tell I'm a baker
just by looking at my crotch?

1404
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:02,456
Carly told me.

1405
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:07,664
I love those chewy fudge
brownies with walnuts.

1406
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,496
Do you make those?

1407
01:01:10,498 --> 01:01:12,733
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1408
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:13,365
Brownies.

1409
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,003
Do you make brownies?

1410
01:01:16,038 --> 01:01:17,003
Yes.

1411
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:18,304
Bread pudding?

1412
01:01:18,306 --> 01:01:19,171
Yep.

1413
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:20,273
Bread pudding.

1414
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:21,474
Brownies, cakes,
challah, all of it.

1415
01:01:21,476 --> 01:01:23,045
Now help me!

1416
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,748
Have you every gone on one
of those online dating sites

1417
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,883
where you put in all your
personal information?

1418
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,220
Yes.

1419
01:01:31,987 --> 01:01:34,987
And you go one of those
dates from those sites

1420
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:39,391
and it's like being
on an airplane

1421
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:42,229
and it's taking you
to the wrong city.

1422
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,366
You can't get off.

1423
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,802
Horrible.

1424
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:52,007
I bet that is how Carly
is feeling right now.

01:04:02,436 --> 01:04:03,538
Shallow.

1461
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,108

Cindy, why did
you invite him here?

1534

That boy Carly has upstairs
has been taking advantage

1535

Honey, allow me.

1537

He has no respect for women;

1538
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:24,436
no idea what women go through
in their relationships.

1539
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:28,043
In order to have compassion
you must know the pain.

1540
01:07:29,143 --> 01:07:31,110
So I manscaped him.

1541
01:07:31,112 --> 01:07:32,244
You did what?

1542
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:33,880
Just a Brazilian.

1543
01:07:33,882 --> 01:07:35,782
And an anal bleaching.

1544
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:38,851
I waxed his scrotum,
pubic and anal area

1545
01:07:38,853 --> 01:07:41,089
and whitened him wonderfully.

1546
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:43,423
I was as gentle as I always am.

1547
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:44,891
But he was such a child.

1548
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:47,860

1549
01:07:47,862 --> 01:07:50,229

01:07:51,465 --> 01:07:52,434
Yes.

1552
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:55,267
We found him like this.

1553
01:07:55,269 --> 01:07:57,369
We think he was
trying to escape.

1554
01:07:57,371 --> 01:07:58,338
So we thought we should cuff him

1555
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,639
so he wouldn't try that again.

1556
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:01,340
I hid my identity.

1557
01:08:01,342 --> 01:08:02,411
He was a screamer.

1558
01:08:03,577 --> 01:08:05,744
I made him smooth as a baby.

Cheek to cheek and
all dressed up.

1560
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:13,286
He clearly was not into
having a good appearance

1561
01:08:13,288 --> 01:08:15,688
and good hygiene down there.

1562

But what do you expect
from somebody like that.

1563
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:21,797
But now, his ass and balls are
more kissable than his face.

1564
01:08:23,398 --> 01:08:28,404
But then he had the snow balls.

1565
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,236

outside to tan a bit.

want to hear anymore.

Oh, no good.

You spilled it.

out, I go out again.

01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,769
Tammy, that's not
part of the plan.

(TASER SOUND)

1994
01:28:33,806 --> 01:28:35,440
Everybody calm down.

1995
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:36,708
I'm sorry.

1996
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:38,777
I told you I needed
more rehearsal.

1997
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:39,844
It's all right, Nana.

1998
01:28:39,846 --> 01:28:41,146
Are we still
going to breakfast?

1999
01:28:41,148 --> 01:28:42,380
We'll talk about
that later, Mom.

2000
01:28:42,382 --> 01:28:43,615
I told you this wouldn't work.

2001
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:44,782
It was a good idea.

2002
01:28:44,784 --> 01:28:46,117
We'll just have to work
something else out.

2003
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:47,419
What the fuck is there
to work out, you're crazy.

2004
01:28:47,421 --> 01:28:48,586
Even the old bitch is crazy.

2005
01:28:48,588 --> 01:28:49,787
Shut up!

2006
01:28:49,789 --> 01:28:51,123
No one calls my mother
a bitch, you asshole.

Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute!

Shut up!

Laurie, how'd you get that?

2010
01:28:54,027 --> 01:28:55,393
I hid it.

2011
01:28:55,395 --> 01:28:56,027
You hide everything
in the same place,

2012
01:28:56,029 --> 01:28:56,861
your underwear drawer.

2013
01:28:56,863 --> 01:28:57,696
Let me shoot him.

2014
01:28:57,698 --> 01:28:58,597
Mom, don't shoot him.

2015
01:28:58,599 --> 01:28:59,130
Just fucking shoot him.

2016
01:28:59,132 --> 01:29:00,098
Put it away.

2017
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:00,932
Let's just tie him up again.

2018
01:29:00,934 --> 01:29:02,000
Nobody's tying me up.

2019
01:29:02,002 --> 01:29:03,134
Tell me that's another fake gun.

2020
01:29:03,136 --> 01:29:04,468
Shut up!

2021
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,137
They'll never find
him in the desert.

2022
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:06,071
Tammy, shut up.

2023
01:29:06,073 --> 01:29:06,871
We don't have any duct tape.

2024
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:08,039
I got scotch tape.

2025
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:09,641
Carly, tell me that's
another fake gun.

2026
01:29:09,643 --> 01:29:11,076
- Mom, give him the gun.
- Give me the gun.

2032
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:05,932
Well, that escalated quickly.

2033
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:09,403
Definitely the worst
date I ever had.

2034
01:30:10,136 --> 01:30:11,671
Shit, I'm starving.

2035
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:15,076
And I'm sure my car got towed.

2036
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,148
Now I gotta change my
online dating profile.

2037

Seeking someone smart and
sexy but not bat shit crazy.

2038
01:30:27,787 --> 01:30:30,023
Probably a good idea not
to lie anymore though.

2039
01:30:31,757 --> 01:30:34,692
Anybody asks me I'm just
gonna say right up front,

2040
01:30:34,694 --> 01:30:37,495
"Yep, it was me.

2041
01:30:37,497 --> 01:30:38,565
"I shot 'em all."

2042
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,836
Actually, that's pretty macho.

2043
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,106
Women do love macho and nuts.

The truth?

Fuck!

2049
01:30:58,618 --> 01:31:00,086
The truth just seems like a lie.

2050
01:31:02,523 --> 01:31:05,893
Maybe I'll just start
with the truth tomorrow.

call you for days.

Did you date a girl

I remember her.

I mean it's not a
date if you're just

2067

fucking though, right?

2068
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:13,325
Anyway, I think that
girl gave me an STD.
