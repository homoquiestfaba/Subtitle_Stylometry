1
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:53,476
THE UNINVITED

2
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,434
I love you.

3
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,271
And I have a condom.

4
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,714
I should not be here.

5
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,721
Come on.

6
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,747
No, really should not be here.

7
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,185
Come on!

8
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,055
I'm at a party ...

9
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,359
... but the only thing
want to be home.

10
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,469
Do not you're having fun?

11
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,167
Hey, where VAE?

12
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,200
¿Anna?

13
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,713
Do not go home.

14
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,024
Mom is in the house boat.

15
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,964
I'm going to find it.

16
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,337
When the ill ee
moving to the house of the boat.

17
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,774
It's where I wanted to be.

18
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,644
But she is alone.

19
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,148
Not supposed to be alone.

20
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,659
I run to the house to find Dad.

21
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,003
Something is not right.

22
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,343
Do not feel safe.

23
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,216
There is something ...

24
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,252
... evil in the house.

25
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,635
One way or another
these dreams are trying ...

26
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,407
... on escape
forest and return home.

27
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,974
Yes, and if illegal, it's like
Mom tried to tell me if anything.

28
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,116
But I can not understand what it is.

29
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,713
What we try to tell me.

30
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,225
Well, we have already discussed
the girl redhead ...

31
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,251
... and now there'sa new
detail. The shower.

32
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,554
Why do you think that the hold out?

33
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,492
I don 't know.

34
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,069
I do not really remember.

35
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,098
Perhaps trying to extinguish the fire.

36
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,005
When my mom got sick said ...

37
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,214
... always be there.

38
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,552
That if a cat Maull, or
that if the whispering wind ...

39
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,621
... it would be.

40
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,821
Always protected us, but ...

41
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:39,767
But the night of fire
I could not protect her.

42
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,102
Smart girl.

43
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:46,134
If I'm so smart, why not
I can remember what happened that night?

44
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,839
Okay, this is what you think.

45
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,846
Survived when
remember, but sometimes ...

46
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,047
... survive when we forget.

47
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,649
You lost your mother in that fire.

48
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,561
Your life was changed by what?

49
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:08,693
A gas leak? Maybe
forgetting is not so bad.

50
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,266
But what about sleep?

51
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,964
The dream? I already know.

52
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,337
Here's how it works.
It is a process, Anna.

53
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:21,012
They spent ten months and
and you left this house.

54
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,139
But you will not achieve
in a place like this.

55
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,586
Do you think I'm ready to go?

56
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,612
What else do you want from me?

57
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,661
Go home, kiss a
boy, get in trouble.

58
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,856
Finish what you started.

59
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,052
The beautiful Anna ...

60
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,189
... is going to house.

61
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,223
- I will be alone.
- I gotta go.

62
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,594
There was a lot of blood, is not it, Anna?

63
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,102
You think you fix it?

64
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,973
Come on, leave it in peace.

65
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,172
What I said about you
be here all the time?

66
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,205
I do not managed.

67
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,114
Who would count my stories?

68
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,953
I have a surprise for you.

69
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,652
It's in the glove box.

70
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,854
Tell me that is a hamburger.

71
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,887
Not exactly.

72
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,464
I finished!

73
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,493
Look inside.

74
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,596
To my daughters, Anna and Alex.

75
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,900
Thanks, Dad.

76
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,308
Plenty of nothing.

77
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,405
- Is it good?
- Don 't know, but I sure will tell me.

78
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,810
I know something good.

79
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,249
Ah, great. Thank you.

80
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:52,426
Rachel made them. She
to come today, but I told him ...

81
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,996
... I wanted to do alone.

82
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,026
It was very good, Anna, really.
I do not know what I would have done if ...

83
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,072
Dad, I'm glad that you've been.

84
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,993
Alex!

85
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,748
¡Anna!

86
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,120
Return.

87
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,421
They arrived early.

88
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,724
Hug you, but ...

89
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,357
Welcome home.
Great lights, lights ...

90
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,031
... so flaquita.

91
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,332
I think I could spend
time there.

92
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,862
So your father is
belly getting fat.

93
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:45,172
I think he goes first. Yes, I
make cookies all the time.

94
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,371
- What do? --
- V-Formula, my favorite.

95
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,875
So now the house
Ilene women, Mr. Writer.

96
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,383
Your father told you my idea?

97
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,550
No.

98
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,220
On the feast. Thought
in becoming a party ...

99
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,888
... welcome.

100
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,487
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

101
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,192
Everyone asked about you.

102
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,225
- But we have every summer, there's no hurry.
- No.

103
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,529
Okay, I will go to the lake.

104
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,335
The cagué.

105
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,999
As if nothing had happened, huh?

106
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,530
Alex!

107
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,567
You missed so much!

108
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,014
So what do you think?

109
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,451
You know you did that
work on weekends?

110
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,149
For completion
before they return.

111
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,419
Welcome to the real world.

112
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,450
Better food, more people mad.

113
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,662
When he moved?

114
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,826
Guess.

115
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,769
First was helping with the accent ...

116
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,671
... and then was
helping with the funeral.

117
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,937
Now, it is different.

118
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,774
Three times a night.

119
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,576
Whatever.

120
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,607
By the way, thank you very much.

121
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,481
About what?

122
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,182
I hurt.

123
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,280
Alex.

124
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,520
I was here with these two, while
you were looking for yourself internally.

125
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,018
Alex, you have no idea what
that was to be there.

126
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,054
¡She was my mother too!

127
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,302
You know what? At least you could
I have replied to Ilam.

128
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,394
What are you talking about?

129
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,302
The songs that you sent the letters.

130
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,137
Do not got nothing, Alex! I swear.

131
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,168
Perhaps Dr. Silverman
I did not want to see.

132
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,447
No.

133
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,473
Dr. Silverman was not.

134
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,543
It's so silly!

135
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,255
How could you not send my
letters? They were my letters, Dad!

136
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,721
What? Did you have fear that it will count ...

137
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,662
... your girlfriend?

138
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,860
Was it? What you
contara secrets?

139
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,860
It was a stupid back to this town ...

140
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,906
... in which everybody talks about us.

141
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,333
Ah, me das asco.

142
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,910
- Alex, what are you doing?
- As if anyone would care.

143
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,203
I was caught.

144
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,436
Come here.

145
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,468
Now you can hug. I am clean.

146
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:48,651
Listen, Anna, I know they are supposed
who hate the new girlfriend Dad.

147
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:53,282
But I really hope that
we can leave that aside ...

148
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,552
... and make this work.

149
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,959
Clear.

150
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,988
Yes

151
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,163
¿Something is different?

152
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,103
Yes, paint.

153
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,335
I like the roles of the house,
but needed to illuminate the kitchen.

154
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,201
- Missing something.
- Really?

155
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:17,338
- Yes, the blackboard.
- Ah, yes, the blackboard.

156
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,142
Must be in the attic
with everything else.

157
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,445
I thought you no longer need.

158
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,525
So what do you think? Want
help set the table?

159
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,530
No, okay. I am not a
waitress, anyway.

160
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,137
Alex?

161
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,929
What are you doing?

162
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:14,338
So that was you vomiting?

163
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,972
- Don 't know.
- Okay.

164
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,751
I'm drunk. I went to a
party and had many drinks.

165
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,150
- Where did you find that?
- Top.

166
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:33,458
- What the hell are you doing with that?
- I do not know, was in the attic.

167
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,691
Well this is where it belongs.

168
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,961
I hate that bell.

169
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,996
Why? Reminds me of Mom.

170
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,974
We need, Alex. That was like
We called for the help ...

171
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,074
... after he got sick.

172
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,208
Anna, wake up. Rachel
bought the bell.

173
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,351
What are you talking about?

174
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,685
Became a whore store
bought a fucking bell ...

175
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,824
... and hung around his neck mom.

176
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,220
And you know why? To
when mom came to hear ...

177
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,862
while ...
mounted a busy dad.

178
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,794
We're inventing.

179
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,964
- Okay, why do that?
- To avenge dad.

180
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,331
Believe me, Anna, I'm not interested
nothing to avenge dad.

181
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,813
You know what? Perhaps I am drunk ...

182
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,839
... but I know the truth.

183
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,877
Oh, here comes the funny.

184
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,939
Maybe you can knock the
windows when you're done.

185
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,566
Sorry.

186
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,270
No need to apologize.

187
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,576
Great. In fact, I think it is
Io that the kitchen needed.

188
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,814
Right? I leave here.

189
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,444
- Okay.
- You know, Anna?

190
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,920
I remember the first time
I came here to care for your mom.

191
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,551
When I taught the
home, Alex was doing ...

192
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,026
... their role in adolescent
Harassed by his father.

193
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,825
But you were different.

194
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,272
Friendly, polite. A lady.

195
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,443
I remember thinking:

196
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,470
... "The other is the classic and the ...

197
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,374
... is strong. "

198
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:38,284
When I was your age, it was like you.

199
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,849
And be tough.

200
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,355
I did not have to bother.

201
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,658
I am so glad
you're back.

202
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,962
Let's see if you can stay.

203
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,038
Thank you.

204
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,067
This treatment.

205
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,939
Did you see his face? It is as if a jaguar ...

206
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,315
... have come and
had destroyed his kitchen.

207
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,383
- It was so weird.
- You did very well.

208
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,015
It was our slate
has to be there.

209
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,923
Remember how Mom
We left messages there?

210
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,020
Ah, but his writing was so bad.

211
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,824
Ready?

212
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,939
- Am I very pale?
- Yes, quite.

213
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,042
Ah, your husband comes around.

214
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,357
- No, I'll stop here.
- What are the sisters?

215
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,986
Alex, do not you dare.

216
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,501
- Hey, Matt.
- Hello.

217
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,541
- How have you been?
- Okay.

218
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,449
I had wanted to visit,
but I did not leave.

219
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,615
Ah, you should see my mates.

220
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,290
Glad you're back.

221
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,822
Listen, that night on the beach ...

222
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,325
I was nervous. Had
drunk too much punch.

223
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,497
I do not think that was very clever ...

224
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,532
... so it was a stupid drunk.

225
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,570
But I am very concerned for you.

226
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,739
I came to you.

227
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,276
What do you mean?

228
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,546
We followed that night.

229
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,226
I was here I saw everything.

230
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,253
Minutes late, Matt.

231
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,996
Thanks, that's all I needed.

232
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,667
I'm glad you have seen.

233
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,702
Bye.

234
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,781
Matt reminds me of the
purchases from the people.

235
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,817
Come on, your father and unreadable.

236
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,666
- Your agent called today.
- Really?

237
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,901
- Yeah, I knew I had a house here.
- The purchase five years ago.

238
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,276
Pretend you like to fish.

239
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,303
I think it could review
the next book here.

240
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,381
- Really?
- Yes

241
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,680
So I invited him to dinner
on Friday night.

242
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,980
Really?

243
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,011
With some other people.

244
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,615
Why not? Never
No one comes to the house.

245
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,026
It will be fun.

246
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,057
- Please.
- Okay.

247
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,561
Well.

248
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,351
¿Anna?

249
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,386
What are you doing here?

250
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,090
Hey, you okay?

251
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,793
I saw Mom.

252
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,065
What?

253
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,074
I saw my mom!

254
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,769
What are you talking about?

255
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,802
¡Anna!

256
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,015
¡Anna!

257
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:48,041
Try to tell me something.

258
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,916
What?

259
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,948
The fire was no accident.

260
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,921
It was she.

261
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,270
He said he had the night off.

262
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,274
Sure.

263
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,343
- Alex.
- No, now everything makes sense.

264
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,354
She was a mom.

265
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:30,487
It became one of those weird clothes
and went to the house of the boat.

266
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,254
Perhaps we
conclusions too lightly.

267
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,833
Sorry, but I was not that
saw our mother dead ...

268
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,860
pointing the finger ...
the new girlfriend Dad.

269
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,864
- I think it was just a dream.
- Anna, you were quite awake ...

270
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,441
... I saw you.

271
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,673
- Maybe it was all in my head.
- Maybe.

272
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,047
But that does not change what you both know.

273
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,051
We all knew what she warmed.

274
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,680
Mom killed and will not be with theirs.

275
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,625
Hello. Hi there.

276
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,284
- Do you hear?
- I do not know.

277
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,628
I go to town to buy
some things for the party.

278
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,527
Are we together? ¿Something therapy
mental, perhaps something to eat?

279
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:17,038
I have great hope that I resaca
much headache later.

280
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,707
But Anna wants to go.

281
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,234
What? No!

282
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,443
What about Matt? So you can
and get to see it tonight.

283
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,214
Tell me, Anna.

284
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,450
Come on, you can go so I can stay
between here and register your things.

285
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,850
Come on.

286
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,449
You know what? We
do it later.

287
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,959
No.

288
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,758
Down in a minute.

289
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,788
Look for something nice to wear.

290
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,992
Fucking bitch.

291
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,739
Your father hates it when I drive fast.

292
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,039
To be our little secret, OK?

293
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,069
Our little secret.

294
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,684
What happened to mom's car?

295
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:05,712
Well, I discussed and decided
that the family needed more ...

296
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,616
... fun.

297
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,440
Good jewelry.

298
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:38,846
- Where did you get those?
- Someone gave me a few years ago.

299
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,351
A boyfriend?

300
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,088
A former patient, actually.

301
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,992
Sounds like a good job.

302
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,395
Cleaned in the ass
seniors, Anna.

303
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,072
And I can guarantee that
not all were beautiful.

304
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,271
Like your mom.

305
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,974
I had to do things for people
they were very embarrassed ...

306
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:07,314
... or weak to make themselves.

307
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,449
You know what I thought to get out of that?

308
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,654
At times were good.

309
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,724
But ...

310
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,860
... no matter how
were condescending ...

311
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,630
Io or bad ... I tried.

312
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,034
I always told myself ...

313
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,950
... "Will be dead very soon."

314
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,949
You know, Anna? We all have
things in the past ...

315
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,985
... of us ashamed.

316
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:58,663
I think sometimes it is better
if only I let go.

317
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,008
¿Anna?

318
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,041
Anna, are you okay?

319
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,114
Yes Yes

320
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,151
It was nothing.

321
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:32,025
We have shopping to do, right?

322
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,365
Beautiful. From where is it?

323
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,601
It is French.

324
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,634
Clear.

325
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,538
- I'm going to get milk.
- Great, thanks.

326
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,267
Matt.

327
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,070
Anna.

328
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,077
What are you doing here?

329
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,205
Listen, I think I know what
wanted to tell me that yesterday.

330
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,946
The fire was no accident,
Huh? What did you see?

331
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,213
Matt, these berries are not
being cooler.

332
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,917
Yeah, yeah, I go.

333
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,052
- Will you help please?
- Okay, but not here.

334
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:33,220
- Will you go tonight?
- Matt!

335
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,023
Yes, at once, in the stone.

336
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,731
Okay.

337
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,763
- Can not find the milk?
- Yes

338
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,136
We gotta go.

339
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,544
Ah, Matt, you do not have to
Bear buying the house.

340
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,473
That will be my job from now on.

341
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,066
Was fun?

342
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,098
Yes, but should ask Anna.

343
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:21,935
Yes, thank you for lunch.

344
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,914
It was good. Was somewhat
in an embarrassing moment.

345
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,822
Alex?

346
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,333
Alex?

347
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,384
By God, you scared me,
I thought that was it.

348
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,054
- I talk?
- Yes, we will be tonight.

349
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,180
Well.

350
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,158
Watch this.

351
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,456
Oops, did not know she was naked.

352
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,486
I know, is like a
Farewell to dignity.

353
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,724
By the way, check this out.

354
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,061
Come on.

355
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,097
Look what I found.

356
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,574
Meet the fat.

357
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,374
Ah, it's disgusting.

358
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,404
No, I will not touch that.

359
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,892
Wow.

360
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,922
Here is enough to
reassure a horse.

361
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,259
What do you mean?

362
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,538
Come on, come on.

363
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,510
Wait.

364
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,803
The party was over, Rachel.

365
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,715
Dale, go, arrive late.

366
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,615
¿Matt?

367
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,320
¿Matt?

368
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,826
I have bad spine.

369
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,905
What if something happens?

370
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,471
Okay, Anna. Rioja
find out tomorrow.

371
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,908
Yes

372
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,683
- I'm going to my bed.
- No, please stay with me ...

373
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,714
... until I sleep.

374
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,661
If you give me ten U.S. dollars
for every time I hear that.

375
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,959
Thank you.

376
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,989
It's not as entertaining.

377
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:01,891
Matt.

378
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,163
Careful, do not want
wake your father.

379
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,927
Matt.

380
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,632
Where were you?

381
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,902
We hope in the rock, like you said.

382
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:15,071
- Yes, I know.
- What's wrong? You are soaked.

383
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,738
I think I fell or something.

384
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,941
Come and sit down.

385
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,680
I feel having such a late arrival.

386
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,257
It's just that ...

387
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:34,696
... I think you should know
truth of what he saw that night.

388
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,893
- Tell me.
- Okay.

389
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:43,034
You're shaking.

390
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,065
I can not feel anything.

391
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,074
- I'm afraid, Anna.
- Don 't have.

392
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,827
Matt, what happened to your back?

393
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,135
Your mother wanted to tell you ...

394
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,338
... but not heard.

395
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,921
¡Anna!

396
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:42,262
¡Aguántame! Please!

397
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:15,814
Anna, hi, I am the sheriff
Emery, I do not know if I remember.

398
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,720
Listen, we'll
investigation ...

399
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,028
... but must have been beaten with something.

400
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,327
He fell from the boat, his back is broken.

401
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,132
Was supposed to be seeing?

402
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:39,047
Listen, we all know
Io you past.

403
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,944
If you need anything, what it is,
Come and see me, you know?

404
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,349
Sorry.

405
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:10,336
It's terrible.

406
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:14,707
Will make you breakfast,
need to eat something.

407
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,285
David.

408
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,185
Dad, wait.

409
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,214
What?

410
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,021
Matt was not there
out last night for fun.

411
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,225
- Came to see me.
- Anna, what happened was not your fault.

412
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,523
Dad, that's not what you try to tell you.

413
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,559
Honey, can you help me?

414
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,163
- Dad.
- I'm going.

415
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,108
What?

416
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:44,137
I saw Matt in the village yesterday.

417
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,373
I said what I had
seen the night of the fire.

418
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:52,284
Rachel heard we did not want
speaking that followed.

419
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,624
I was not coming further.

420
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,751
Anna, why Rachel would do something like that?

421
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:00,787
- She ...
- What?

422
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,391
Is everything okay out there?

423
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,428
- I will.
- Okay.

424
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:18,815
Honey, I know this is difficult
for you. And for all of us.

425
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:25,712
But please, do not
this. Please do not do this.

426
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,016
- Come, let's have breakfast.
- Be there in a minute.

427
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,324
You okay?

428
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,786
No, I'm fine.

429
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:11,124
I'm not crazy, Alex.

430
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:16,905
Matt was here, and I thought
I was dreaming ...

431
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,904
... but not what it was.

432
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,671
- Anna, I know ...
- My mom said ...

433
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,202
... was trying to warn me.
- How can it be?

434
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,874
- I was holding.
- Anna, listen.

435
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,907
Look!

436
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,489
Well, now I'm afraid.

437
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,395
I am not crazy!

438
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,398
I will not go back there.

439
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:46,027
I am not afraid for you.
I'm scared for us.

440
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:52,233
Anna, what we are all that remains between
Rachel and what he really wants.

441
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,905
Come on.

442
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,972
The murderers did not arise in series
for overnight ...

443
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,286
... so we need to find out who
Miss Rachel is really Summers.

444
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:23,402
Yes, hello, I try to find information
about a girl from your agency.

445
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,034
His name is Summers. Rachel Summers.

446
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,209
Good, I get references
on one of his nurses, please.

447
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,216
I think it was in the
staff of the hospital ...

448
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,848
... between July and December 2005.

449
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,326
Hello, I try to search for information
about someone who worked for you ...

450
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,587
... some years ago.

451
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,428
Summers.

452
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,629
S-U-M-M ... Yes,
as "Mother."

453
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,828
... E-R-S.
As "Satan."

454
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,402
What?

455
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,378
No, this is impossible

456
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,381
No, no, okay.

457
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,408
Well, thank you very much. Bye.

458
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,681
We have it.

459
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,056
Driver's license

460
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,659
Anna.

461
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,693
Enter.

462
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,732
You have such beautiful lips.

463
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,836
But do not know what to do with them.

464
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,078
The men say they
love the eyes of women.

465
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,381
But it is a lie.

466
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,217
What we really want ...

467
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,088
... is a girl ...

468
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,117
... with a pretty mouth.

469
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,363
You seem very interested in them.

470
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:08,067
Want to use it tonight?

471
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,340
I think not.

472
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,372
Come on, be fun.

473
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:23,215
What 's your real name, Rachel?

474
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,285
Say what?

475
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,093
The partnership of carers are not
record any of Rachel Summers.

476
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,402
Your Social Security number
Rachel Summers is the ...

477
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,168
... but it was a masterpiece
School of New Orleans.

478
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,199
He died five years ago.

479
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,637
So who are you? Really.

480
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:56,015
You know, Anna?

481
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,119
I do not think this will work.

482
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,628
Where do you expect?

483
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,309
A talk with my father.

484
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,709
I really do not have to.

485
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,840
I already discussed with Dr. Silverman.

486
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:25,248
- Discuss what?
- On your behavior.

487
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:30,053
Anna is very concerned,
is beginning to believe ...

488
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,862
... that was a mistake to leave out.

489
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,359
I do not lose what I have.

490
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:43,539
Not allowed.

491
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:46,565
Now go, I have guests. 

2
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,910
I can not believe you apart from dad.

493
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,653
Perhaps you can
do you, but I do not.

494
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,715
I will talk to Dad.

495
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,695
No! She convinced
that lie ...

496
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,096
... and that is my fault. Okay?

497
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,226
Hopefully tonight and
Tomorrow we will go to the police ...

498
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,301
... and told them what happened.

499
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,329
That would only worsen
things for me.

500
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,934
Fine, but this can
be a little heavy.

501
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,789
- Hey, look at you.
- What?

502
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,753
- You look fantastic.
- Thanks.

503
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,858
You've grown, right?

504
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,061
Hey, if you is of all
this is very rare for me too.

505
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,434
Presentations
books are forever ...

506
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,469
the door open for ...
that people come and judge.

507
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,312
Can I ask you a favor?

508
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,015
Could you get a
Rachel hand tonight?

509
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,048
To be honest, I do not think that
sit well with all this ...

510
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:13,127
... and people are here
are also the judging.

511
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,624
Clear.

512
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,736
What?

513
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:31,770
I just wanted to ask
if you need help.

514
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,313
Really?

515
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,344
Sure, you can open the kiln.

516
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,323
Well.

517
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:50,356
This is perfect.

518
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,833
We have to wait ten
minutes before cutting.

519
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,861
That's what it takes.

520
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,733
I'm going to mix.

521
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:02,711
Ah, could you take out the trash for me?

522
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,523
You are disgusting.

523
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,330
No, no ... What did you do?

524
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,734
What did you do?

525
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,109
Why am I doing this?

526
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:46,138
What happened?

527
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:52,344
Let her alone!

528
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,881
Go to your room.

529
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:11,333
There is a reason for Io
what happened tonight.

530
00:55:12,671 --> 00:55:15,299
Rachel is not who you think it is.

531
00:55:15,341 --> 00:55:18,435
Basta, Anna. What made this time?

532
00:55:18,878 --> 00:55:21,745
- I lied.
- About what?

533
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,145
Above all. On their behalf.

534
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:27,919
- Do you know where is it?
- I will not dignify that with a ...

535
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,114
No, of course. Because
just look what you see.

536
00:55:30,155 --> 00:55:33,090
What I am trying to do is
this family function.

537
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:36,117
You think you do that? She
you want for herself.

538
00:55:36,328 --> 00:55:37,488
That is ridiculous.

539
00:55:37,529 --> 00:55:40,089
What mom would say if you
seen putting on the side ...

540
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:43,124
... that bitch that
just want to separate us?

541
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:49,430
Rachel is not the one that is separating us.

542
00:55:51,844 --> 00:55:55,302
Look, maybe we should talk
with Silverman about it.

543
00:55:55,514 --> 00:55:58,108
- Sure, because I am I'm crazy.
- Nobody said that.

544
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,085
I know ...

545
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,112
Where is your ring?

546
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:18,059
Will you marry her?

547
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,303
Tell me!

548
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:25,833
Yes, we married.

549
00:56:26,045 --> 00:56:29,037
In the fall.

550
00:56:31,383 --> 00:56:34,375
We talked about going to another party
but I want to marry here.

551
00:56:34,687 --> 00:56:37,656
For all of us.

552
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:41,091
I am not ashamed, Anna. I
ashamed of being happy again.

553
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:13,448
Bye, Daddy.

554
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:19,730
Today is the funeral of Matt.

555
00:57:19,765 --> 00:57:22,325
Wear something decent.

556
00:57:22,368 --> 00:57:25,360
I want this to look like a family.

557
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:31,939
I take refuge in the Lord.

558
00:57:31,977 --> 00:57:34,810
How to use your shelter?

559
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,872
When the values are
being destroyed ...

560
00:57:38,283 --> 00:57:41,275
... What can we expect?

561
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:11,207
The Lord is my salvation ...

562
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,242
... and not be afraid.

563
00:59:43,642 --> 00:59:46,133
Wright kids.

564
00:59:46,178 --> 00:59:49,113
Murder.

565
00:59:49,147 --> 00:59:50,910
Children brutally murdered.

566
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:53,213
This is April 11, 1996.

567
00:59:53,251 --> 00:59:56,243
The police found the bodies of
three children in a makeshift grave ...

568
00:59:56,354 --> 00:59:59,585
... a forest in less than 50 yards
the residence of a prominent doctor ...

569
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:02,783
... Harrison Wright.

570
01:00:02,994 --> 01:00:06,088
The experts stated that
Children were highly sedated ...

571
01:00:06,264 --> 01:00:09,131
... before being stabbed
repeatedly.

572
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:12,193
Police said the arrest
of Mildred Kemp, aged 19 ...

573
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:15,563
... who served as the babysitter
children since last August.

574
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:19,633
Mildred Kemp, shit.

575
01:00:19,677 --> 01:00:24,671
Listen to this, according to Kemp family
was romantically obsessed ...

576
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:28,181
... with Dr. Wright since the death
his wife last February.

577
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:32,415
Despite the efforts of police,
still was not able to find.

578
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:35,749
Wait, what?

579
01:00:36,928 --> 01:00:39,920
See what people are using.

580
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:42,991
¡Pearls!

581
01:00:43,034 --> 01:00:46,333
Rachel said it was a
gift from a former patient.

582
01:00:46,671 --> 01:00:48,400
Put them around my neck ...

583
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:51,431
... as if he was proud of them.

584
01:00:52,644 --> 01:00:55,636
Well, it seems that
is our only evidence.

585
01:00:56,181 --> 01:00:59,673
Yes, if we can get your hands on it.

586
01:01:00,151 --> 01:01:02,619
Do not worry about that.

587
01:01:02,654 --> 01:01:05,646
This was just tonight.

588
01:01:40,558 --> 01:01:43,550
Crap.

589
01:01:44,229 --> 01:01:47,221
Mira.

590
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:58,633
Alex, what are you doing?

591
01:01:58,676 --> 01:02:00,371
Find the keys.

592
01:02:00,445 --> 01:02:03,437
- What you gonna do?
- Just looking for the keys.

593
01:03:10,448 --> 01:03:13,440
What are you looking for, Anna?

594
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:16,843
Is this what you're looking for?

595
01:03:19,657 --> 01:03:22,455
You can take them.

596
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:25,485
Please do not mean anything to me.

597
01:03:26,764 --> 01:03:29,756
We know, Rachel.

598
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:33,436
We know everything.

599
01:03:35,406 --> 01:03:38,398
They caught me.

600
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,602
Here.

601
01:03:47,118 --> 01:03:52,613
Alex!

602
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:20,609
¡Anna!

603
01:04:20,651 --> 01:04:23,643
I do not want to hurt you.

604
01:04:24,355 --> 01:04:27,347
This is not what I want.

605
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:30,784
You can do this easily.

606
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:45,536
- Anna.
- Alex!

607
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,209
What happened?

608
01:04:47,245 --> 01:04:50,578
I was drugged.

609
01:04:50,615 --> 01:04:52,480
¡Anna opened the door!

610
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:55,509
Got beads?

611
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,184
I did. I have.

612
01:04:58,222 --> 01:05:01,214
¡Anna, open the fucking door!

613
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:07,490
¡Anna!

614
01:05:07,532 --> 01:05:09,500
You have to go now, okay?

615
01:05:09,534 --> 01:05:10,523
No, no.

616
01:05:10,568 --> 01:05:13,560
I can not leave.

617
01:05:15,072 --> 01:05:17,802
Take this.

618
01:05:18,142 --> 01:05:21,134
¡Anna!

619
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,272
I love you.

620
01:05:36,894 --> 01:05:39,055
I'll come back for you, okay?

621
01:05:39,096 --> 01:05:42,088
I promise.

622
01:06:06,423 --> 01:06:09,415
¡Anna!

623
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:26,342
So, say that Miss Summers is
actually a woman named Mildred Kemp.

624
01:06:26,477 --> 01:06:29,344
- Yes
- And she was responsible for the fire?

625
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:33,180
So it was. It was not an accident. Killed
our mother and is now behind us.

626
01:06:35,386 --> 01:06:37,047
Listen, I know it sounds like ...

627
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:38,645
No!

628
01:06:38,689 --> 01:06:41,681
Mildred Kemp, I remember.

629
01:06:42,493 --> 01:06:46,793
Some years ago in Orange
County, a woman died.

630
01:06:47,131 --> 01:06:49,565
Her husband hired a nanny,
who killed all the children.

631
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,261
True, but never caught.

632
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:55,795
Listen, Mrs. Wright had a
pearl necklace, three laps.

633
01:06:56,106 --> 01:06:58,472
There are pictures of him in the
Internet if you want to see them.

634
01:06:58,509 --> 01:07:01,501
And?

635
01:07:04,515 --> 01:07:06,983
Rachel is Mildred Kemp.

636
01:07:07,017 --> 01:07:08,985
Well? You are trying to kill ...

637
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:12,011
to marry ...
as he did with them.

638
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:23,424
Listen, I want you to feel. I
I will look for Summers in the system.

639
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:26,726
No, no time for
that. Go to my house.

640
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:30,930
Alex is still there and
I'm afraid that something will happen.

641
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:33,669
Nothing will happen to anyone, Anna.

642
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,702
Wait here.

643
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:22,515
Mom?

644
01:08:29,703 --> 01:08:32,467
Mom.

645
01:08:34,805 --> 01:08:36,830
Do not be afraid.

646
01:08:36,874 --> 01:08:39,069
I am a nurse.

647
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:41,010
No, no, believe!

648
01:08:41,045 --> 01:08:43,036
Do not believe!

649
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:46,072
We will kill you!

650
01:08:47,385 --> 01:08:50,377
Do not believe!

651
01:08:59,563 --> 01:09:02,555
That's it. Thank you.

652
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:22,212
The memories.

653
01:09:22,253 --> 01:09:25,245
It was a few years ago in Orange County.

654
01:09:25,356 --> 01:09:29,019
The wife died and her husband hired
a babysitter who murdered all the children.

655
01:09:29,326 --> 01:09:31,294
Rachel is Mildred Kemp.

656
01:09:31,328 --> 01:09:35,025
The police sought the arrest
of Mildred Kemp, aged 19 ...

657
01:09:35,332 --> 01:09:38,324
... who served as a babysitter
children since last August.

658
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:41,834
Revealed that the forensic
Children were highly sedated ...

659
01:09:41,872 --> 01:09:44,306
... before being
repeatedly stabbed.

660
01:09:44,341 --> 01:09:47,333
Despite the efforts of the
Police have been unable to find it.

661
01:09:54,752 --> 01:09:57,744
Now you can sleep.

662
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:09,860
You know, Anna?

663
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,892
I'll never have children.

664
01:10:17,108 --> 01:10:19,338
I can not.

665
01:10:19,376 --> 01:10:22,368
However ...

666
01:10:24,014 --> 01:10:29,213
... that has never prevented me
Imagine what it might have a daughter.

667
01:10:37,728 --> 01:10:40,720
But now I've removed that.

668
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:06,349
With care.

669
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:09,382
You do not want to hurt you.

670
01:13:24,862 --> 01:13:27,854
Anna.

671
01:13:27,998 --> 01:13:30,990
We tried everything, Anna.

672
01:13:31,068 --> 01:13:34,003
This was the only way.

673
01:13:35,506 --> 01:13:38,498
What did you do?

674
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:41,173
What did you do?

675
01:13:41,211 --> 01:13:44,203
I had to do, Anna. Or not?

676
01:13:45,816 --> 01:13:48,808
I had to do.

677
01:13:52,122 --> 01:13:55,114
Everything is fine. I'm here.

678
01:13:55,726 --> 01:13:58,718
We're fine.

679
01:14:00,631 --> 01:14:03,623
Look at me. Look at me!

680
01:14:05,035 --> 01:14:08,027
Well, okay?

681
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:13,908
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

682
01:14:13,944 --> 01:14:16,936
It was Rachel, Dad.
Rachel started the fire.

683
01:14:18,082 --> 01:14:21,074
- What are you talking about?
- She killed mom.

684
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:24,951
Dad, I know that I never hear
but you have to make the case.

685
01:14:25,255 --> 01:14:27,052
Wait until you leave ...

686
01:14:27,091 --> 01:14:30,083
... and I was drugged and drugged to Alex.

687
01:14:30,861 --> 01:14:32,260
What?

688
01:14:32,296 --> 01:14:34,196
He tried to kill us.

689
01:14:34,231 --> 01:14:37,223
Alex had to do,
dad. She saved us.

690
01:14:37,434 --> 01:14:40,267
Alex. Alex, tell.

691
01:14:40,304 --> 01:14:44,900
- Anna, what are you talking about?
- Do not listen to me, Anna.

692
01:14:45,209 --> 01:14:47,473
Never does.

693
01:14:47,511 --> 01:14:50,912
- Do not know what happened to your sister?
- Alex, tell.

694
01:14:51,849 --> 01:14:54,374
- She died.
- Do not you think!

695
01:14:54,418 --> 01:14:57,410
On fire! It was a year ago.

696
01:14:58,455 --> 01:15:01,447
- Alex, tell!
- Alex is dead!

697
01:15:08,165 --> 01:15:11,464
What have you done?

698
01:15:17,574 --> 01:15:20,566
Alex!

699
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:37,421
Anna, what do you mean
the fire was no accident?

700
01:15:37,795 --> 01:15:39,854
What happened that night?

701
01:15:39,897 --> 01:15:42,889
Tell me what happened that night!

702
01:15:44,701 --> 01:15:48,000
Let me go. Let go!

703
01:16:04,254 --> 01:16:07,246
Hello? Dad?

704
01:17:03,914 --> 01:17:06,212
Hey, girl.

705
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:08,616
There are guys out there ...

706
01:17:08,652 --> 01:17:11,644
... and you return to our home.

707
01:17:12,623 --> 01:17:15,615
It is no longer our home.

708
01:17:15,759 --> 01:17:17,522
What are you doing?

709
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:19,392
Will burn in hell.

710
01:17:19,429 --> 01:17:22,421
Anna. ¡Anna!

711
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:29,462
Anna, what happens?

712
01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:33,872
Alex?

713
01:17:33,911 --> 01:17:36,903
Coming, Mom.

714
01:17:46,323 --> 01:17:49,315
Alex!

715
01:18:13,617 --> 01:18:16,609
How could you not give him my letters, Dad?

716
01:18:18,422 --> 01:18:21,653
Did you have to fear
contara your girlfriend?

717
01:18:21,925 --> 01:18:25,156
Was it? What would you
contara secrets?

718
01:18:27,564 --> 01:18:31,796
¿Anna? Listen, I
the people, want to go?

719
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:37,566
I tell you what
I saw that night. I saw everything.

720
01:18:37,908 --> 01:18:40,900
- No, no.
- Aguántame!

721
01:18:45,115 --> 01:18:47,345
You know, Anna?

722
01:18:47,384 --> 01:18:50,376
I'll never have children.

723
01:18:50,587 --> 01:18:53,055
I can not.

724
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:55,581
But I never stopped thinking ...

725
01:18:55,626 --> 01:18:58,618
... would like to have a daughter.

726
01:19:00,797 --> 01:19:03,994
And now I take that away.

727
01:19:19,149 --> 01:19:22,141
Sorry, Mr. Roberts.

728
01:19:25,422 --> 01:19:28,516
I noticed the name of the
Miss Summers in the passport ...

729
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:31,651
... is not the name of
driver's license.

730
01:19:31,762 --> 01:19:34,322
The name was changed three years ago.

731
01:19:34,364 --> 01:19:37,356
Her boyfriend used to beat her.

732
01:19:39,236 --> 01:19:42,228
His real name was Rachel Rochester.

733
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:48,968
Her daughter had the idea that his fiancée
was a woman named Mildred Kemp.

734
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:56,142
Why is this inventory?

735
01:20:34,624 --> 01:20:37,616
Security Area.

736
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:52,732
Hello, Anna.

737
01:20:53,677 --> 01:20:56,669
You okay?

738
01:20:57,147 --> 01:21:00,139
Why ask?

739
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:03,542
I wanted to know, Anna.

740
01:21:08,358 --> 01:21:11,350
I finished what I started.

741
01:21:38,021 --> 01:21:41,013
Welcome home.

742
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:45,851
Mildred Kemp

743
