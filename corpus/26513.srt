181
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:26,925
Do you have a problem with America, Felix?

00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:32,562
Oh, yeah. l've got one great big, fat,
swollen fucker of a problem with America, twat!

186
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:45,602

(Camptown Races ringtone)

187
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:48,651
l'm like: Oh, yeah, yeah, mate, that's right.
John Smith.

188
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,044
Yeah, l do know him
but he doesn't come from England, mate.

189
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:54,125
No, he comes from fuckin'

190
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,613
BOTH: Pricksville, USA!

191
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:00,006
(Phone continues ringing)

192
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,725
- You going to answer the fuckin' phone or what?
- lt's just my wife.

193
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:08,845
Now, when Mr McElroy joins us, l'd be pleased
if you kept your opinions to yourself.

194
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:13,568
This particular Yank is not a travelling salesman.
He's a genius, hmm?

195
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,614
Who is this cunt?

196
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:23,053
So l said to Mr Durant, l said, ''Mr Durant,
we go and meet this fuckin' Yank McElroy,

197
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,131
bring him to the deal and that's it.''

198
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,372
None of this fuckin'
conversation-and-coffee bollocks .

199
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,975
None of this asking him
how the Tampa Bay 'Eers are doing.

200
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:32,654
No, l said, ''Fuck him.

201
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:36,372
l bring him to the deal,
l get my fuckin' tickets and l'm off. That's it.''

202
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:41,219
- Take a eft up here
- There's no time for this .

203
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:42,623

204
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:50,141
(Football chants )

205
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:59,262
Felix! Felix, listen!

206
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,304
This is a totally new chemical.

207
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:04,346
Once we have the formula,
we could make this stuff in a kitchen.

208
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,781
We don't even need Durant.

209
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:08,064
Look. You see that?

210
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,466
That's tomorrow. Blokes are shagging
their mothers-in-law to get a ticket

211
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,382
and l'm getting two from Mr Durant.

212
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:19,583
So unless you can shite out

00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,583
l suggest you shut the fuck up.

214

00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,254
Does Durant still do his deals at the Port Hotel?

349
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:55,690
Silly lad. lt'll be his undoing, one of these days .

350
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:59,052
But what do you expect from a fella
who gets his arse waxed every month?

351
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,493
l forgot what a circus this place is .

352
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:04,135
Funny, that.

353
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:08,177
l never did much like the circus. All that
poking your head in a lion's mouth shite.

354
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,409
Bring on the horses !
Get 'em rogering the dancing girls !

355
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,455
That's a circus .

356
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,097
These...and these

357
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:17,772
are on the house.

358
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,895
Welcome home,...Dawn.

359
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:33,614
- There you go, mate.
- Thanks, mate.

360
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:35,261
Ta.

361
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:46,581
What the fuck did they do to this fish?
Batter it to death?

362
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,736
Fish and chips. The national dish, mate.

363
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:51,466
More like a national disaster.

364
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:54,380
# l said you don't really wanna go, l can tell

365
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,025
# But l'm gonna take you anyway

366
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,461
# What the hell?

367
00:25:57,548 --> 00:26:00,108
# So come on, get on in the ride

368
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:02,384
# And let me take you to the other side

369
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,824
# You don't really wanna go, l can tell

370
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,468
# But l'm gonna take you anyway

371
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,268
# What the hell?

372
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,501
# So come on, get on in the ride

373
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,344
# And let me take you to the other side

374
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:16,468
# l heard you even got a child now

375
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:17,507
# Look at that

376
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:19,105
# A baby momma and a bow-wow...

377
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:21,149
(Tyres screech)

378
00:26:23,953 --> 00:26:25,306
Keys .

379
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:29,232
Twat.

380
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:31,271
Come on.

381
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:36,712
So, er...

382
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:39,435
How much are they paying you
to wear that skirt?

383
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:48,474
Fag?

384
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,635
No, motherfucker.

385
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,996
(Sniggers )

386
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,798
(Knock at door)

387
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:13,242
Ah, Mr McElroy!

388
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,679
That's daring, but very dashing attire.

389
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:17,436
Let's stick to the business in hand.

390
00:27:18,124 --> 00:27:21,162
Hey, come on! Mr McElroy's a guest of ours .

391
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:26,006

l've delivered him. l'll have my tickets and be off.

394
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:32,040
OK. Put your gun on the table.

395
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:35,837
- Fuck. The game's tomorrow.
- Put your fucking gun on the table, you gobshite!

396
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:39,245
What?

397
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:41,718
- So, who's the chemist?
- This is Pudsey Smith.

398
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,845
A first-class man. Qualified and everything.

399
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:46,688
He can't talk. He's been shot.

400
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:57,762
Felix, have you shit your pants, or something?

401
00:27:57,852 --> 00:27:59,763
Something doesn't feel right, Mr Durant.

402
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:03,766
l know. You're making me nervous ,
for fuck's sake! Sit on your hands, or something.

403
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,448
OK, Mr McElroy, the ball's in your court.

404
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:19,727
McELROY: MDMA utses serotorhrh

405
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:23,014
Opates ke herorh utse dopamrhe

406
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:26,534
Sort of like the same sensation you get after sex.

407
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:29,007
Amphetamrhes rhcrease adrerharhe

408
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:34,014
and cocaine gets those synapses in the brain
firing really fast.

409
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:38,218
My product is 51 times stronger than cocaine.

410
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,293
51 times more hallucinogenic than acid

411
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,214
and 51 times more explosive than ecstasy.

412
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:46,621
lt's like a personal visit...

413
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:49,534
..from God.

414
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,376
lt's that good?

415
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:57,258
The dog's bollocks .

416
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:20,099
Felix DeSouza.

417
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:22,623
- l count ten.
- That's right.

418
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:26,749
That's one million sterling,
or 1 ...1 .6 million dollars .

419
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,900
But that ain't what we agreed on, is it?

420
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,744
You're 1 8.4 million dollars shy.

421
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:35,427
And l don't care how you cut it,
that's a whole lot shy.

422
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,468
No...

423
00:29:37,552 --> 00:29:40,272
Mr McElroy, what we have there
is a goodwill gesture.

424
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:41,866
A deposit. A down payment.

425
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:44,468
One and a half million's not a bad start, is it?

426
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:49,390
l need to do some research. l need to feed
a few thousand to the kids, get some feedback.

427
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:52,626
You don't think l can allow you
to walk out of here with $20 million

428
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:54,707
for a formula that only exists in your head?

429
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:57,310
And all l get is what?

430
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,353
An ointment for toe jam.

431
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:02,993
Uh-huh?

432
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:05,431
- Market research.
- Right.

433
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:07,634
Profile customers, send out questionnaires .

434
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,594
Get out the bloody way, Felix.

435
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,039
l can dig that. But unless you've got what
we agreed on, what the fuck am l doing here?

436
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:22,316
Give me a call when you're ready to deal.

437
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,836
(Banging on door)
- l fucking knew it.

438
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:29,235
(Quavery voice) Room service.

439
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:31,279
That old fuckin' chestnut.

440
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:33,558
Aaargh!

441
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:36,316

- Ssh...

444
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:44,438
Sorry, love. Sorry about that, pet.

445
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,403
lt's just that er...

446
00:30:46,486 --> 00:30:48,317
my dad ran off with a room service maid.

447
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,875
Things have never really been the same since.

448
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,639
Bollocks .

449
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,320
(Phone rings )

450
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:00,723
Now's not a good time.

451
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,606
- Charhge ofparh
- What do you mean?

452
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:04,248
l want McElroy kept alive.

453
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,888
l don't do alive, l do dead.

454
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,528
t's a matter of$20 morh

455
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,283
in cash being vaporised,

456
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,568
and it's a matter of a lot of anger
being directed at The Lizardman.

457
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:14,210
You now do alive.

458
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:18,331
My future s rhsde McEroy's sku

459
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:21,371
You waste anything
and everybody that gets near him.

460
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:24,173
You waste them, not him.

461
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:27,246

462
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:29,132

Shit, shit, shit!

465

Ow! Shit!

Man, it's just a flesh wound. Come on.

475
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,421
Flesh wound? ls that supposed
to sound like a fuckin' good thing?

476
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:54,463
(Arguing)

477
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:56,747
Come on, dude.

Get your fat arse out of the flamin' car.

490
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,083
Put me in the picture.

Oh! Fuck.

515
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,622
(Siren)

516
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,467
Hello?

517
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,826
So, let me get this straight.

518
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,142
''Bollocks'' is bad,
whereas ''the dog's bollocks'' is good, huh?

519
00:36:09,231 --> 00:36:10,903
Yeah.

520
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:13,671
(Engine revs )

521
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:15,265
Oh, bollocks .

522
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:23,432
Gotcha.

525
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:44,553

So who hired her to take me out?

You're asking the wrong question, mate.

597

They're shitting again.

Do you think you can swing that?

614

$20 million could swing anything.
You know what l'm selling.

615
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:04,191
Well, how much?

616

00:47:58,454 --> 00:48:00,411
# You know l can be found

698
00:48:00,495 --> 00:48:02,451
# Sitting all alone

699
00:48:03,415 --> 00:48:05,053
# lf you don't come around

700
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:07,604
# At least, please telephone

701
00:48:07,696 --> 00:48:09,448
# Don't be cruel

702
00:48:09,536 --> 00:48:11,528
# To a heart that's true...

703
00:48:13,297 --> 00:48:16,893
Well, shit in a bag and punch it. She's back.

704
00:48:20,178 --> 00:48:21,737
l need to find Felix.

705
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:24,891
And what do you need from me?
A map and a fucking compass?

706
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:26,936
Shirley...

707
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,536
You broke his heart.
Did you even give a thought about that?

708
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:33,693
- This was a mistake.
- Most sensible thing you've said.

709
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:38,451
Are you still shooting people for a living?

710
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,501
What kind of fucking career is that, then, eh?

711
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:47,973
- Look, can l come in?
- And do what? The dirty stop-out

712
00:48:48,064 --> 00:48:50,056
doesn't come home till breakfast.

713
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:54,580
Really good to be home.

714
00:48:59,826 --> 00:49:02,660
lt's great to see you again, love.

715
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,737
# Baby, it's still you l'm thinking of

716
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:10,059
# Don't be cruel

717
00:49:10,149 --> 00:49:12,140
# To a heart that's true...

718
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:14,185
(Engine roars and splutters )

719
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:23,667
l wanted to see the world.

720
00:49:24,952 --> 00:49:26,908
Liverpool isn't the world.

721
00:49:28,392 --> 00:49:32,102
l couldn't take America.
lt was like fucking Albania in neon.

722
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:34,149
And that stupid football shirt.

723
00:49:35,994 --> 00:49:39,908
What kind of man jumps into bed shouting,
''Come on, you Reds''?

724
00:49:39,995 --> 00:49:42,111
She made me laugh.

725
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:47,832
Good shag, though.

726
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:51,193
l tell you, she'd kill anyone for me,
l'll say that for her.

727
00:49:51,277 --> 00:49:52,790
He's got problems .

728
00:49:52,877 --> 00:49:54,356
She's got problems .

729
00:49:54,437 --> 00:49:56,588
Shouldn't have come back.

730
00:49:56,678 --> 00:49:58,191
Better off.

731
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,716
l need everything on this list.

732
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,838
l'm dying for a smoke.
You haven't any ciggies, have you?

733
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:13,481
l'm sorry. Cigarettes are bad for your health.

734
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:17,032
So's a fucking punch in the throat.
l need fucking nicotine now!

735
00:50:17,122 --> 00:50:20,115
No need to shout at me.
l'm Pakistani, not deaf.

736
00:50:21,203 --> 00:50:24,674
- Take a puff on this !
- Oh, fuck off.

737
00:50:24,764 --> 00:50:26,163
You?

738
00:50:27,244 --> 00:50:31,443
You! Dress-wearing er...monkey-boy.

739
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:33,755
SKlNHEADS: Monkey-boy!

740
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:37,202
You're going to take them drugs of yours
and make it work for us .

741
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:41,485
- And where would l do this?
- ln my lab.

742
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:43,683
- You got a lab?
- Yeah, of course.

743
00:50:44,928 --> 00:50:47,567
What do you take us for?
Rank fucking amateurs?

744
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:50,368
(Skinheads laugh)

745
00:50:53,249 --> 00:50:55,206
# Thrash metal

746
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,249
Come on!

747
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:06,970
(Screeching and whooping)

748
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:14,290
Just say no.

749
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:16,604
FELlX: How the fuck dd we erhd up rh here?

750
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:19,653
One little mistake...30 years ago.

751
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,726
All of these items are over-the-counter.

752
00:51:31,817 --> 00:51:33,774
Nothing illegal here.

753
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,814
You're no fucking help, are you?

754
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:40,768
l beg to differ. You see, it's not the ingredients
themselves which determine the effect

755
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:43,134
but the manner in which they're combined.

756
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:45,176
These kids are getting very smart.

757
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,497
He's right.

758
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:53,538
The ravers are the key.

759
00:51:53,622 --> 00:51:56,580
Aren't you the clever little chunky monkey?

760
00:51:56,662 --> 00:52:00,019
You keep banging on about my weight.
You're crossing a line.

761
00:52:00,103 --> 00:52:02,059
Arthur, it was a joke.

762
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:04,453
lt was a joke. Smile.

763
00:52:04,544 --> 00:52:06,500
Smile.

764
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:08,142
You fat cunt.

765
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:12,221
Yo, Blowjob.

766
00:52:12,305 --> 00:52:17,858
P-O-S 51 . Comes in blue or race-car red.

767
00:52:17,946 --> 00:52:20,700
Destination: stratosphere.

768
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:27,307
Only, this one gets you there in 60 seconds .

769
00:52:27,388 --> 00:52:29,539
You try one first.

770
00:52:29,629 --> 00:52:31,585
Thought you'd never ask.

771
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:47,467
P-O-S 51 ?

772
00:52:47,552 --> 00:52:49,509
You can't call it that.

773
00:52:49,593 --> 00:52:52,824
Punters'll feel like right tits
asking for tabs of 438 l-O-U,

774
00:52:52,913 --> 00:52:56,827
whatever the number is .
No-one's going to know what they're on about.

775
00:52:56,914 --> 00:53:00,749
These scumbags spend their entire life
smacked out of their heads .

776
00:53:00,835 --> 00:53:04,272
Numbers - they couldn't even tell you
what fucking time it is .

777
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:09,147
All right, Mr Smug, what have you done?

778
00:53:12,157 --> 00:53:14,433
l think the shit's about to hit the fan.

779
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:32,550
Arrrrrgh!

780
00:53:33,722 --> 00:53:35,599

781
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:37,240
Phew. Eurgh.

782
00:53:40,203 --> 00:53:42,512
(Farts )

783
00:53:42,603 --> 00:53:45,596
- (All groan and fart)
- Curry was a bad idea, lads .

784
00:53:46,884 --> 00:53:48,841
(Skinheads groan)

785
00:53:50,925 --> 00:53:52,564
(Farting)
- Oh yeah

786
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,240
ALL: Please. Please.

787
00:53:55,326 --> 00:53:57,362
(Farting and squelching)

788
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:01,921
BLOWFlSH: Oh, thanks. Oh, thanks .

(lki laughs )

807
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:33,343
- Are you going to be all right here on your own?
- Mm-hm.

808

# He's letting you know...

816
00:56:01,311 --> 00:56:06,910
Every chemical used in the production
of this drug is 1 00% legal.

817
00:56:06,993 --> 00:56:13,069
Not one ingredient is found on any known
government's banned substance watch list.

818
00:56:14,114 --> 00:56:16,754
Hell, you can ship supertankers of this shit.

819
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:21,272
You can even lay a goddamn pipeline
and no-one would bat an eye.

820
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:28,712
P-O-S 51 .

And it can be yours .

823
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:36,798
lf the price...is right.

824
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,594
Chemistry...Mr McElroy.

825
00:57:03,644 --> 00:57:05,600
What is chemistry...

826
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:10,520
..but the ability to attract adoration in others?

827
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:18,441
You see, you're like me, Mr McElroy.

828
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:21,918
You're a sky-highatrist, l'm a sky-highatrist.

829
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:25,284

my mother ht my brother

831
00:57:28,169 --> 00:57:30,889
my brother hit my sister,
and my sister fuck my father.

832
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,642
So it's inevitable, really.

833
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:36,610
You'd have to be on drugs
just to live in that madhouse, wouldn't you?

834
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:39,603
Drugs are good, Mr McElroy.

835
00:57:40,651 --> 00:57:42,608
Drugs are our mates .

836
00:57:44,452 --> 00:57:47,889
Fuck. l'm getting on my own nerves .

837
00:57:49,413 --> 00:57:52,212
What l'm trying to say to you, Mr McElroy, is...

838
00:57:55,134 --> 00:57:59,174
..l'm very much attracted
to what you have to offer.

839
00:57:59,255 --> 00:58:01,770
(lki chuckles )

840
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:13,209
How are you doing, Felix?

841
00:58:14,298 --> 00:58:16,255
Well, my boss is dead...

842
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:19,688
..can't get a ticket for tomorrow's match,

843
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:22,931
and, oh, yeah,
l've got a fucking bullet hole in the arse.

844
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,779
Apart from that,

845
00:58:25,861 --> 00:58:27,817
l'm tiptop.

846
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:33,293
So who's the target?

847
00:58:33,382 --> 00:58:35,977
You've got that look in your eye.

848
00:58:36,063 --> 00:58:38,019
l've been looking for you

849
00:58:38,103 --> 00:58:41,779
Oh, yeah? For old times' sake
or for the company l keep?

850
00:58:41,864 --> 00:58:43,900
Little bit of both.

851
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:48,501
So, you have got me on your list, then?

852
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:51,702
You've always been on my list.

853
00:58:54,186 --> 00:58:56,701

854
00:58:56,787 --> 00:59:01,100

855
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:02,541
(Wild cheering)

856
00:59:02,628 --> 00:59:06,622
Tonight, we're going to launch a rhew revolution.

857
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:13,827
One that will rock and roll your senses .

858
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,424
(Cheering)

859
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:19,265
And you...are my test pilots .

860
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:26,668
You're going to kiss the sun
and taste the motherfuckin' rainbow.

861
00:59:26,753 --> 00:59:30,542
(Wild cheering)

862
00:59:32,034 --> 00:59:35,266
- Are you ready?
- (Cheering)

863
00:59:35,355 --> 00:59:39,587
- Are...you...ready?
- (Cheering)

864
00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:45,035
Then let's get ready to party-y-y-y.

865
00:59:46,637 --> 00:59:49,675

867
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,118
Why didn't you stay with me, then?

868
01:00:31,206 --> 01:00:33,766
What, me? ln America? Don't be soft!

869
01:00:33,846 --> 01:00:36,680
Besides, l don't know who you are any more, girl.

870
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:40,647
lt's been nearly two years .
l haven't heard a word.

871
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:45,565
Still...

872
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,327
l always hoped...

873
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,886
..you might...

874
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:55,643
change your mind...

875
01:00:56,691 --> 01:00:59,160
..and come home.

876
01:01:02,212 --> 01:01:04,169
We could have a fresh start.

877
01:01:07,653 --> 01:01:09,610
Aren't you going to say anything?

878
01:01:37,779 --> 01:01:41,011
This, Mr McElroy, is a fucking miracle.

879
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:46,016
Drug use will reach epidemic proportions ,
revolutions will break out, governments will fall!

880
01:01:46,861 --> 01:01:49,422
20 million, and not a penny less !

881
01:01:49,502 --> 01:01:51,732
- Where do l sign?
- Si... Sign?!

882
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:53,779
This ain't some written contract.

883
01:01:53,863 --> 01:01:56,935
The kind of agreement l could take you to court
and sue your ass over.

884
01:01:57,023 --> 01:01:58,980
You fuck me on this deal,

885
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:02,181
l gotta take out a contract just to get even
on the goddamn contract!

886
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:05,302
We think we have an agreement,
we think we see things the same way.

887
01:02:05,385 --> 01:02:06,579
Either we do, or we don't.

888
01:02:06,665 --> 01:02:08,337
You're either in, or you're out.

889
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,145
You give me the money, l give you the formula.
Are we clear?

890
01:02:12,226 --> 01:02:15,697
Crystal, Mr McElroy. Crystal.

891
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:18,825
l'm not Leo Durant. l'm a man of my word.

892
01:02:18,908 --> 01:02:20,864
Get in my way,

893
01:02:20,948 --> 01:02:23,018
and l'm gonna have to shoot you.

894
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:27,824
Get in my way,
and l'm gonna have to shoot you again.

895
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,466
l've got to work, babe.

896
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,220
Fucking cow!

897
01:02:40,512 --> 01:02:42,423
(Screaming)

898
01:02:43,633 --> 01:02:45,351
Oh, fuck!

899
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:50,863
Can't a brother just deal some goddamn drugs?

900
01:02:53,435 --> 01:02:55,949
Time to go, Elmo.

901
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:13,267
Mr Kane. ls it that time of the month already?

902
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,715
l thought you weren't due till next week,
you eager beaver.

903
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,840
Now, ain't that always the way?

904
01:03:27,922 --> 01:03:30,516
Elevator music, a nigger in a kilt,

905
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:33,481
and a chick with a nickel-plated nine.

906
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:35,519
(Mobile rings )

907
01:03:37,403 --> 01:03:39,360
And now a word from our sponsor.

908
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:41,400
That ain't no Liverpool accent.

909
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:44,641
- Say hello, Elmo.
- Hello, Elmo.

910
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:48,002
Abserhce makes the heart grow forhder Emo

911
01:03:48,086 --> 01:03:50,805
Arhd The Lzard s so fu of

912

914
01:03:57,487 --> 01:03:59,160
l'm touched.

915
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:01,557
- You w be.
- You got my cash?

916
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:04,322
You're flush, sweetcakes. You are flush.

917
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,527
He's looking forward to seeing you.

918
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:23,131
So, what's the price tag on my ass?

919
01:04:23,213 --> 01:04:25,169
lt's enough. Move.

920
01:04:34,935 --> 01:04:36,334
(Screams )

921
01:04:38,936 --> 01:04:42,212
Last stop. There's nowhere from here but down.

922
01:04:42,297 --> 01:04:43,776
Reel me in!

923
01:04:43,857 --> 01:04:46,052
Why would l do a stupid thing like that?

924
01:04:46,137 --> 01:04:49,130
- Pull me up, will you?
- Fold or call?

925
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:53,098
- What?
- You play poker. Fold or call?

926
01:04:53,179 --> 01:04:55,249
- (Whimpers )
- l'm your last chance, girl.

927
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:57,456
l'm that out you've been looking for.

928
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,338
l'm only gonna make this offer once.

929
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,855
You either take it
and get out from under The Lizard,

930
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,580
or you stay a slave
and wonder where your life went.

931
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:08,813
You think you can save me, do you?
Look where you are!

932
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:12,259
- Get real!
- A million in bonds, untraceable.

933
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:15,141
That's real! That's a fresh start.

934
01:05:15,223 --> 01:05:18,773
Try quitting while you're ahead
for a change...Dawn.

935
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:20,900
- No.
- No?!

936
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:22,941
(Screams )

937
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:26,823
l want 1 0% of your deal with lki.

938
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:28,464
You're negotiating with me?!

939
01:05:28,546 --> 01:05:30,104
Look at your options .

940
01:05:32,507 --> 01:05:34,145
1 0%.

941
01:05:34,227 --> 01:05:36,263
Have a look at yours .

942
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:41,901
All right.

943
01:05:41,989 --> 01:05:43,183
(Screams )

944
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:55,829
Now that is a lovely dress .

945
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:57,345
Need the extra room, do you?

946
01:05:57,432 --> 01:05:59,263
Tell me something. l'm intrigued.

947
01:05:59,352 --> 01:06:02,231
ls it true that you fellas are equipped
with incredibly...

948
01:06:05,113 --> 01:06:06,832
..large...

949
01:06:08,634 --> 01:06:10,067
Fuck!

950
01:06:12,195 --> 01:06:13,753
Thanks .

951
01:06:13,835 --> 01:06:15,029
My pleasure.

952
01:06:15,115 --> 01:06:16,468
You can move your arm now.

953
01:06:21,236 --> 01:06:23,193
KANE: Rght therh you Scouse gt

01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:33,435
And l, Virgil Kane...

958
01:06:34,479 --> 01:06:36,436
Well, l want to know why.

959
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:41,549
Nobody cuts me out of anything
in this parochial pisshole.

960
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,474
You smell that, Felix. Smell it.

961
01:06:43,561 --> 01:06:45,836
- Smell it!
- (Sniffs )

962
01:06:45,921 --> 01:06:47,878
That is essence of Durant.

963
01:06:49,122 --> 01:06:51,796
And Durant got what he deserved.

964
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,317
So, when a deal goes down,

965
01:06:54,403 --> 01:06:57,874
you, my old sausage, will fix it. Time and place.

966
01:06:57,964 --> 01:07:00,034
And then you will call me.

967
01:07:00,124 --> 01:07:03,117
Otherwise... Accessory to murder.

968
01:07:04,165 --> 01:07:06,885
Possession of a firearm.

969
01:07:06,966 --> 01:07:08,718
You fuck me,

970
01:07:08,806 --> 01:07:10,797
l'll have you on your hands and your knees ,

971
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:15,085
with your arse in the air, exposing your rusty
sheriff's badge for the next 20 years .

972
01:07:17,608 --> 01:07:20,520
So ask yourself, are you going to help restore

973
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:22,884
some national pride,
and stick one on the Yanks?

974
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:26,007
Or, like the rest of your life,
are you going to piss it all away?

975
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,725
Are you going to help me

976
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,403
to help you?

977
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:33,447
Eight hours till kickoff.

978
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:37,570
lt's a big game.

979
01:07:38,652 --> 01:07:41,531
Let's just see if you come good.

980
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:53,254
Mr Kane.

981
01:07:59,456 --> 01:08:01,971
See ya! (Chuckles )

982
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:06,457
- You'll never walk alone, eh, mate?
- (Laughs )

983
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,015
(Deactivates car alarm)

984
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,057
(Laughs )

985
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:24,737
Help me to help you? Cunt!

986
01:08:52,787 --> 01:08:56,098

DAWN: Busht

990
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,946
Kevin Brown couldn't carry
Sandy Koufax's jockstrap.

991
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:11,340
You've been listening to too much Vince Scully.

992
01:09:11,431 --> 01:09:15,550
You need to get your ear out of the radio,
and carry your ass out to the ball game.

993
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:19,068
Sorry, but er...

994
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:21,705
..have l missed something?

995
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:28,867
What the fuck is that?

996
01:09:28,954 --> 01:09:32,789
- Black pudding. Fried pig's blood.
- Oh!

997
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,344
Are you two planning on filling me in, or what?

998
01:09:37,516 --> 01:09:39,393
Elmo's propositioned her.

999
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:41,547
Nice one, Shirley.

1000
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:43,150
l'm listening.

1001
01:09:43,237 --> 01:09:47,197
Lizard offered Dakota 250K
to deliver my live ass to him.

1002
01:09:47,278 --> 01:09:50,794
l've made her a significantly better offer.

1003
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:53,552
And l'm thinking...she might entertain...

1004
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:57,034
..certain sentimental reasons
for not doing her job.

1005
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,872
The questorh s

1006
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,112
whether it's going to pay me...to be sentimental.

1007
01:10:07,282 --> 01:10:09,477
Look, we have a choice.

1008
01:10:10,203 --> 01:10:13,991
We can use our ''Get out of jail free'' cards ,

1009
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:19,796
or we can choose ''Stop, do not pass Go''.
Do not collect 20 million dollars .

1010
01:10:21,205 --> 01:10:23,161
Do we have a deal?

1011
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:30,480
Do that again, l will definitely fucking shoot you.

1012
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:33,035
Shut your gob! Go and get yourself cleaned up!

1013
01:10:41,489 --> 01:10:43,525
- And no shagging up there!
- Yeah.

1014
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:45,999
No shagging up there.

1015
01:10:58,732 --> 01:11:00,689
We do this job and we get out.

1016
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:11,331
lt's what we all want, isn't it?

1017
01:11:13,855 --> 01:11:15,812
# l don't know why

1018
01:11:17,096 --> 01:11:19,850
# l love you like l do, but l do

1019
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:21,256
Just to get out.

1020
01:11:25,738 --> 01:11:27,968
# l don't know why

1021
01:11:28,058 --> 01:11:30,493
# You treat me like you do

1022
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:32,535
# But you do

1023
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:35,616
# Lord, you do

1024
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,656
So, what's the plan?

1025
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,697
You tell me.

1026
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:46,090
# Lord, you do me any way you please

1027
01:11:47,142 --> 01:11:49,099
What's the plan?

1028
01:11:49,183 --> 01:11:50,741
You tell me.

1029
01:11:50,823 --> 01:11:52,779
# No matter how you treat me, woman

1030
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:58,940
# Lord, l just can't seem to leave

1031
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:02,181
# l don't know

1032
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:06,179
# What you're using on me, baby, but it's good

1033
01:12:08,426 --> 01:12:10,224
# Ooh, it's real good

1034
01:12:12,747 --> 01:12:16,787
# l know l would surely leave you, woman

1035
01:12:16,868 --> 01:12:18,825
# Oh, if l could

1036
01:12:19,829 --> 01:12:21,979
# l surely would

1037
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:24,782
# Ooh

1038
01:12:29,271 --> 01:12:31,227
(Squeaks )

1039
01:12:34,912 --> 01:12:38,667
(Chanting)

1040
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:40,983
Listen! lt's got to come from your belly.

1041
01:12:41,073 --> 01:12:43,542
Right deep down!

1042
01:12:43,634 --> 01:12:45,590
lt's your birth trauma.

1043
01:12:45,674 --> 01:12:49,509
Now cleanse your chakras and let it all out.

1044
01:12:52,395 --> 01:12:54,352
(Chant)

1045
01:12:55,676 --> 01:12:58,953

1058
01:13:35,124 --> 01:13:37,684
in a very public place.

1059
01:13:38,965 --> 01:13:40,921
And security.

And witnesses. Thousands of witnesses .

1062

And try for fuck's sake to blend in, cunt!

1078
01:14:43,578 --> 01:14:45,534
This clown better deliver.

1079

Don't worry. lki put something like this together
a couple of years ago now.

1080
01:14:49,179 --> 01:14:50,737
Yeah? What happened?

They all died.

We get in, we get out.

1109

20 million in bonds. Untraceable.

1113
01:17:06,807 --> 01:17:10,880
What?! ls that supposed to be 20 mill?

1114

You got that right.

1131
01:18:21,182 --> 01:18:24,811
Usually, the blowed-up motherfucker
has the courtesy to stay blowed up.

1132
01:18:24,902 --> 01:18:27,656
l'll try to be more accommodating next time,
Elmo.

1133

Don't you just fucking hate it
when a motherfucker stabs you in the back?

1151
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:34,670
The Lizard travelled 1 2,000 miles
to settle accounts with you!

1152
01:19:34,756 --> 01:19:36,315
So? What?

1153

You gonna tell me how much you missed me,

But you will no longer take what is mine.

1161
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,395
Fucking right. 1 0% is mine.

1162
01:20:02,482 --> 01:20:05,793

Oh, you've got some big fucking onions, Elmo.

1165
01:20:13,844 --> 01:20:15,801
This...

1166
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:19,275
is the most expensive candy on the market.

1167
01:20:19,365 --> 01:20:21,516
The drug's a fake, you know.

1168
01:20:21,606 --> 01:20:25,646
lt's bogus. lt's what we chemists call a placebo.

1169
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:27,683
lt's whatever you want it to be.

1170
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:33,001
You can run all the tests you want,
and it'll look like the best shit in the universe,

1171
01:20:33,088 --> 01:20:37,640
but the ingredients...they cancel each other out.

1172
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:41,769
Fucking confusing The Lizard
ain't gonna fucking help your cause, Elmo.

1173
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:44,000
You've gotta give big ups to marketing.

1174
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,047
The ability to make people believe.

1175
01:20:46,131 --> 01:20:48,087
The power of suggestion.

1176
01:20:48,171 --> 01:20:50,606

1181
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:11,970
lt takes the human body 81 seconds to heat
that liquid to the point of chemical volatility.

1182
01:21:14,257 --> 01:21:16,725
You...have 1 2 seconds left.

1183
01:21:16,817 --> 01:21:19,252
1 2 seconds?
What the fuck are you talking about?

1184
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:21,135
And what is the big fucking umbrella?

1185
01:21:21,218 --> 01:21:22,537
Freeze!

1186
01:21:22,618 --> 01:21:24,337

01:21:24,419 --> 01:21:25,818
in the kaftan, drop the gun.

1188
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:29,050
Nice and controlled. How's my timing, Felix?

1189
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,619
lt's fucking perfect.

1190
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,691
Ow! Argh!

1191
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:35,011

(Cheering)

1197
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:55,781
That cleared my sinuses .

1198
01:21:58,465 --> 01:22:00,422
Drugs...

1199
01:22:00,506 --> 01:22:02,337
always kill you in the end.

1200
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,827
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa, shit!

1201
01:22:16,909 --> 01:22:19,105
(Mutters )

1202
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:21,658
All right, lads .

1203
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,185
Get the cuffs on this cockney twat!

1204
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:29,588
As agreed.

1205
01:22:31,352 --> 01:22:33,308
What about the drug?

1206
01:22:33,392 --> 01:22:35,907
You conned us .

1210
01:22:43,354 --> 01:22:45,915
or is this not, worth 20 million dollars?

1211
01:22:49,036 --> 01:22:50,754
This castle's worth,

1212
01:22:50,836 --> 01:22:52,713
l'd say, more like...

1213
01:22:52,796 --> 01:22:54,867
