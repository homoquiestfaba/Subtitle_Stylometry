12
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,772
She's been in there 3 days in
a row so l'mjust thinking she

13
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,770
does.

14
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:19,771
Her Dad's the owner.

She's in there.
Let's go.

16
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,375
You go look first.

17
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:23,808
Just to see if she's there.

18
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:26,146
This is stupid.

19
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:27,579

20
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,818

00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:46,397
Okay, now l'm really nervous.

24
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:46,863
Don't be nervous.

25
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:50,369
Maybe we should just
come back another day.

26
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:50,833
We're on your side Dustin.

27
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:58,243

Coming right up.

43
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:54,992
What are you doing talking
so much with my girl?

44
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:55,992
What do you mean?

45
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:59,364
You know, talking to her about
the pineapple and stuff.

46
00:04:59,463 --> 00:04:59,930
You talked to her
more than l did.

47
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,267
Someone had to.

48
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:08,806
l'm telling you Dustin,
l think you're in love.

49
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,006
l am not.

50
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:11,541
l think you are.

51
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:13,410
l don't knowwhat
being in love is.

52
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:13,876
lt's what you're
feeling right now.

53
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:14,811
How do you know?

54
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,646
ljust do.

55
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:17,446
How?

56
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:18,647
You've never been in love.

57
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:21,986
But my older sister is right now
and she told me how it feels and

58
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:23,887
she looks at her bofriend the
same way Dustin does when he

59
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:26,890
sees Tanya.

60
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:29,459
Ooooo, Dustin's in love.

61
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:30,925
Dustin's in love.

62
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,528
Come on guys, cut it out.

63
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,263
You'd better watch yourself,
l think Nick likes her too.

64
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:36,429
But she doesn't like Nick.

65
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:38,399
She talks to him
when he talks to her.

66
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:39,968
So that doesn't
mean she likes him.

67
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,035
Dustin's right.

68
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:41,867
Tanyatalks to a lot of people.

69
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:42,869
Nick.

70
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,906
l'd like to see someone
knock his block off.

71
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:46,907
l hate him.

72
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,479
l think l'm going
to ask Tanya out.

73
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:52,978
On a date?

74
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,681
l'm thinking about it.

75
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,617
You ever ask a girl out before?

76
00:05:56,715 --> 00:05:57,983
No.

77
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,385
You?

78
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,453
No.

79
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:01,886
You Albert?

80
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,057
No.

81
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:06,692
What are you going
to ask her out to?

82
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,427
l don't know.

83
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:11,965
Walk her home from the diner
or invite herto my house.

84
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:13,031
l'd wouldn't do it.

85
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,366
Not with Nick around.

86
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:15,699
l told you she doesn't like him.

87
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,068
Yeah but he likes her.

88
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,370
That'll be enough
to keep me away.

89
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:30,079
Mom, l'm home.

90
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,419

00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,789

138
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:28,019

Well, are you going

209
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:46,890
Why not?

210
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,424

it she'll find it.

245
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,494

00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,062
What, l said goodbye.

247
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:06,831
l wanted to play it cool.

248
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,899
Now She'll think
you left the money.

249
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:09,866
No she won't.

250
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:10,801
Yes she will.

251
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,070
Look, you signed the note right,
so at least she'll know that's

252
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,471
from you.

253
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,839
Oh, Albert.

254
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,946
Excuse me, Miss, may l please

255
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:21,409
Sure.

Thank You.

Okay, Thanks.

So come on, are you going to
tell us what you said in the

259
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:42,362
note or not?

260
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,967
Why should l, it's private.

261
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,967
You can tell us, we
won't tell anyone.

262
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:47,901
Yeah right.

263
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:49,503
l'm surprised you guys haven't
called her yet and ruined the

264
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:50,771
whole thing.

265
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,407
l tried to once but
her phone was busy.

266
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:54,474
Albert.

267
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:55,409
l'm just kidding.

268
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:58,546
Come on, what did the note say?

269
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:02,183
ljust asked her if she wanted
to get togetherwith me and l'd

270
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:05,085
be back tomorrow so
she could let me know.

271
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:08,490
Wow, Dustin might be going
out on his first date.

272
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,791
Hey, there's my newest customer.

273
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:12,423
What do you mean?

274
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:14,026
Mr. Spery, from church.

275
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,360
Yeah, l mowed his
Iawn yesterday.

276
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,996
Yeah l've seen him before, he
taught my older brother in

277
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:19,864
Sunday School class.

278
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:22,334
And he gave me the best
Iemonade after l was done.

279
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:23,467
He makes it himself.

280
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,237
Does he have any more?

281
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:25,768
Would you like some more Albert?

282
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,873
Oh, sure.

283
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,107
lt's good, isn't it?

284
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:31,441
Yes it's vey good.

285
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,943
Mark?

286
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,043
Yes sir.

287
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,411
l made it myself, you know.

288
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,947
Thank you.

289
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:38,515
And Dustin?

290
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:39,816
No thank you.

291
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:42,084
No thank you.

292
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:43,586
You had three glasses yesterday.

293
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:45,187
No, this is enough.

294
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:47,958
He's too busy thinking
about his new girlfriend.

295
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,224
Girlfriend?

296
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,492
She's not my girlfriend.

297
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:51,827
You wrote her a note.

298
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,528
So, that doesn't make
her my girlfriend.

299
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:54,896
Her name is Tanya.

300
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,130
Tanya?

301
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,998
Albert.

302
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:59,034
She's a girl in our class
that works at the diner.

303
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,267
Her father owns it.

304
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,504
The problem is that
Nick likes hertoo.

305
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:03,538
Quiet Albert.

306
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:04,972
Nick's a bully.

307
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,006
Quiet.

308
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:08,008
l told him l thought
it was a mistake.

309
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:08,507
Albert, will you be quiet.

310
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:09,509
What am l doing?

311
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,179
You talked.

312
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:11,577
l was just telling.

313
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,953
So, it's a delicate
situation then.

314
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,484
Yeah, l guess so.

315
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,891
You know l remember the first
girl l had feelings for.

316
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:25,524
l wasjust about your age too.

317
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:27,561
Her name was Martha.

318
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,065
A vey pretty girl.

319
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,596
l liked her so much l
couldn't even talk to her.

320
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:35,002
That's Dustin.

321
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:38,205
Oh then l know how he feels.

322
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:41,641
l tried to pass a note to Martha
during class one day and it

323
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:43,608
dropped to the floor.

324
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:46,045
The Teacher saw it, picked
it up and read it out loud to

325
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:46,609
eveybody.

326
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:49,615
l was asking Martha
if she liked me.

327
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:53,016
Boy was l embarrassed.

328
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,551
Oh wow, can you imagine.

329
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:58,657
lf l only knewthen
what l know now.

330
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:01,258
What do you mean Mr. Spery?

331
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:04,895
Well, l failed to ask
the LORD about Martha.

332
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,227
Ask the Lord?

333
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:10,234
Yes, to see if He wanted me
to spend more time with her.

334
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:13,069
Turned out she wasn't interested
in anything l thought was

335
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,337
important.

336
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:17,907
Could have saved me
a lot embarrassment.

337
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,208
The LORD is interested
in the girls we like?

338
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,943
Absolutely.

339
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,113
The LORD is interested in
eveything in our lives.

340
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,145
Yeah, l know.

341
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,919
The Bible is always saying don't
do this, and don't do that.

342
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,585
Oh l never look at it that way.

343
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,686
What do you mean?

344
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,590
Eveything in the Bible is
there to make our lives better.

345
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,997
Nowthe Bible says not to steal,
do you want anyone stealing from

346
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:41,693
you, Mark?

347
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,628
No.

348
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,933
Well, l guess that'ss a pretty
good thing then, isn't it?

349
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,632
Yeah, l guess it is.

350
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:50,938
And the Bible says not to lie.

351
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:52,670
Do you want anyone
Iying to you, Albert?

352
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:53,706
No.

353
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:57,143
Well l guess that's a pretty
good thing too isn't it?

354
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,575
l neverthought of it that way.

355
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:01,714
l hardly ever read my Bible.

356
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,614
l'm not sure where my Bible is.

357
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:05,717
Me neither.

358
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,085
l see.

359
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:09,719
l tell you what.

360
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,658
Ah, why don't you tyto locate
your Bibles and ifyou do,

361
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:18,164
come by my house say Friday
afternoon two o'clock.

362
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:20,363
l have something l
want to showyou.

363
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:21,597
And it has to do
with chocolate cake.

364
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:22,731
Chocolate cake?

365
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,333
Yes.

366
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:25,367
Chocolate cake.

367
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,669
You like chocolate
cake, don't you?

368
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:28,337
l love chocolate cake.

369
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:31,073
Well then, can l expect
the three ofyou?

370
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,308
l'm not doing anything,
l can make it.

371
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:34,242
Me too.

372
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:35,976
l love chocolate cake.

373
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,043
Good.

374
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:38,679
l will see you
around two o'clock.

375
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:41,116
But..(short beat) remember
you must bring your Bibles.

376
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:25,077
l'm getting a little nervous.

377
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:27,112
Why, it's just a girl.

378
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,847
You're too young to understand.

379
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,216
What do you mean, l'm
just as old as you are.

380
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,517
Yeah but not in your brain.

381
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:34,085
What's that suppose to mean?

382
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,819
Like l said, you're too
young to understand.

383
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,322
Cut it out, guys.

384
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:41,724
l don't think l can do this.

385
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,094
Not again.

386
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:45,695
l mean what if she says no.

387
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:47,330
Look, you said in the note you
were going to come back today

388
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,700
for an answer right?

389
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,666
Right.

390
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,735
So, you need to find
out sooner or later.

391
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,237
Yeah, come on.

392
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,540
Think positive,
maybe she'll say yes.

393
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,275
Okay.

394
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:09,451
Where is she?

395
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,685
Huh?

396
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,121
l don't see Tanya.

397
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,654
Maybe she's in back.

398
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:22,697
Ah, excuse me ma'am?

399
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,698
l'll be with you boys
injust a minute.

400
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,666
Where's Tanya?

401
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:29,170
Oh, she had a dentist
appointment this afternoon.

402
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,406
What about the note?

403
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,612
Hey, Mom, can l
ask you something?

404
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:42,681
Hmm-hmm.

405
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,184
How old were you
when you met Dad?

406
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,319
How old was l?

407
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:49,922
l met him in high
School, l was fifteen.

408
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:54,927
So, you guys
started dating then?

409
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:56,727
We started to go out.

410
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:00,498
Where'd you go out to?

411
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:06,872
We went to football
games, basketball games.

412
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:10,308
He'd walk me home from
school, things like that.

413
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:11,808
Why do you want to know?

414
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,910
Oh, nothing, just wondering.

415
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:28,191
Now gentlemen, l have a brief
Iesson to share with you before

416
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:30,558
we enjoy that chocolate
cake that l promised.

417
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:34,330
(the boys react) First,
l have hidden the cake.

418
00:22:34,427 --> 00:22:36,865
l have written notes to the
three ofyou to tell you where

419
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:38,900
that cake can be found.

420
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,271
Mark, you must run across the
street to the Boone's house.

421
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:44,505
Your note will be
hanging from atree.

422
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:45,806
That's the white one right?

423
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:46,940
That's right.

424
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,711
And Albert, you must go across
the street to the Freeman's

425
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:52,547
house They have a bush
in the front yard.

426
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:54,247
Your note will be found there.

427
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:55,848
Okay, l knowthat house.

428
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:59,219
And Dustin, the note l wrote
foryou is on this side ofthe

429
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:02,889
street at the Rafino's house,
it's taped to their porch,

430
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:03,922
alright?

431
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:04,922
Got it.

432
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:06,224
Now. l told all these people

433
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:07,725
what we
were doing so there's no need

434
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:09,929
for you to wory about them
thinking it's strange you're

435
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:12,231
coming to their houses.

436
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:15,934
But what you do have to wory
about is to meet me in the next

437
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:19,639
five minutes in
the secret place.

438
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:23,810
And that secret place
is written on your note.

439
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:24,941
Okay?

440
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,676
Okay.

441
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:32,484
Alright Gentlemen, your
five minutes starts...

442
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:33,683
now!

443
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,043
Mr. Spery.

444
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,513
We're back here.

445
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,350
Where were you Mr. Spery?

446
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,684
l went down to the
end oft street,

447
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,322
like the note said
but nobodywas there.

448
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,987
l couldn't even find my note.

449
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,990
Even a couple ofthe
neighbors tried helping me.

450
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,560
Must have got blown
off the porch.

451
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:23,062
You guys missed out
on the chocolate cake.

452
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,330
Hey, that's not fair.

453
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:27,766
What happened Mr. Spery,
l did what the note said?

454
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:29,500
Yes l knowyou did Mark.

455
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,705
But apparantly you had
the wrong directions.

456
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,605
Wrong directions?

457
00:24:34,704 --> 00:24:35,940
At least you found your note.

458
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,674
l couldn't even find mine.

459
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:40,645
That's because there was
no note to find Dustin.

460
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:43,447
You mean l never had one?

461
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:44,948
So we don't get any cake?

462
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:46,682
l guess not.

463
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:48,484
You're so lucky, Albert.

464
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,586
And it was great too.

465
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:54,458
So do any of you understand
the lesson here today?

466
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:56,960
Ah...no sir, not really.

467
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:01,633
Well what if finding this cake
here represented finding heaven?

468
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:04,801
How come Albert was
the only who found it?

469
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,937
Because he had the
right directions?

470
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:10,572
Yes, that's right.

471
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,840
So why'd you give me
the wrong directions?

472
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:16,078
Because, Mark, you represent all
the people in the world who are

473
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:17,712
misdirected.

474
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,345
What about me?

475
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:21,648
l'm afraid Dustin that you
represent all the people that

476
00:25:21,747 --> 00:25:24,017
never even heard the name
Jesus or even have a Bible.

477
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:29,092
Therefore, they
have no direction.

478
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:33,696
With that being said, do you see
how really important it is to

479
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,461
read this book?

480
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,833
lf you follow its directions, l
am sure there will be plenty of

481
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,698
room in heaven

482
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:42,500
(pulls out 2
pieces of cake and sets them in

483
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,638
front of Mark and
Dustin) for all of us.

484
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:47,605
Thanks Mr. Spery.

485
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,808
Yeah, thanks.

486
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:54,110
Thanks again Mr. Spery.

487
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:56,114
Yes, thank you.

488
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:58,550
Would you enjoy
another Bible lesson?

489
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:01,084
We could meet again next Monday
afternoon at the same time?

490
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:03,086
What do you say?

491
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:04,688
Sure, l can be there.

492
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:06,456
Me too.

493
00:26:06,554 --> 00:26:07,857
Will there be more
chocolate cake?

494
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:08,823
Albert.

495
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:11,595
Well, l don't know Albert,
l've been leaning more towards

496
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,562
chocolate ice cream

497
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:15,096
Alright

498
00:26:15,563 --> 00:26:17,165
Alright. l'll see you
Monday Mr. Spery.

499
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:18,867
Good bye boys

500
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:20,168
-Talk to ya later Dust.
-See you guys.

501
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:25,808
Dustin, have you got a moment?

502
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:28,443
l Really need you
to do me afavor.

503
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,542
Okay.

504
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:32,514
Do you know Mr. Barnes that
lives across the street there?

505
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:36,652
l've seen him but l
don't really know him.

506
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:41,124
Well He's up in age like l am,
but he's really having a hard

507
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,856
time getting around.

508
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:45,526
l noticed his lawn
really needs to be mowed,

509
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:47,159
so l was hoping you might do it.

510
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,697
Oh l'll payyou for it.

511
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:51,429
Are you sure, l don't
want to take your money.

512
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:53,733
Yes l'm sure.

513
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:56,803
Just do not tell him l am the
one having you to do it, okay?

514
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,868
Okay.

515
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:01,071
Ah, l could do it right now.

516
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:03,108
l mean, it's not too hot.

517
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,643
l could go over
there and ask him.

518
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:05,843
That will be great.

519
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:08,881
l am sure Mr. Barnes will
really appreciate it.

520
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:09,879
Okay.

521
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:40,809
Who's there?

522
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:41,475
Mr. Barnes?

523
00:27:41,574 --> 00:27:44,513
Yes.

524
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:45,245
l would like to mowyour lawn.

525
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,820
Mow my lawn?

526
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,221
Yes sir.

527
00:27:54,521 --> 00:27:56,191
l don't need my lawn mowed.

528
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:57,924
Mr., you don't understand.

529
00:27:58,023 --> 00:27:59,593
l want to do it forfree.

530
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:00,893
For free?

531
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:01,259
Yes sir.

532
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,730
Nothing's free.

533
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:04,229
Well this is sir.

534
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,634
l reallywant to mow it.

535
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:08,134
l said l don't
need my lawn mowed.

536
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:21,181
Whywould he be so mean?

537
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,681
l was real nice to him.

538
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:23,146
l am sure you were.

539
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:28,286
l don't understand.

540
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:30,955
Perhaps you should go
see him in couple days,

541
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:33,224
maybe he will allow
you to do it then.

542
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:35,159
But, don't tell him who's
putting you up to this.

543
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:36,627
Okay?

544
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:38,962
Okay, l won't.

545
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:06,221
l wonder why Tanya hasn't said
anything to you about the note?

546
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,190
l don't know.

547
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,290
Well, then go find out.

548
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:11,626
Now?

549
00:29:11,724 --> 00:29:12,559
Why not?

550
00:29:12,658 --> 00:29:14,795
l can't talk to her in
front of all herfriends.

551
00:29:14,894 --> 00:29:15,261
l'll go then.

552
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:17,698
Albert, no.

553
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:18,931
l'm just kidding.

554
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,266
Quit fooling around.

555
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:22,235
Wait until you
start liking a girl.

556
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:22,334
Dustin's right.

557
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,939
He can't talk to her now.

558
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:33,309
l got an idea.

559
00:29:33,612 --> 00:29:36,283
Why don't you just walk over and
pretend to do something nearby

560
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,619
and we'll watch and
see if she notices you.

561
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:40,918
l can't do that.

562
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:41,852
Why not?

563
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:44,723
And if she notices you, then
we know she's interested.

564
00:29:44,821 --> 00:29:46,724
And if she doesn't then
maybe that can save you the

565
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:48,592
embarrassment of talking to her.

566
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:52,296
No, that's no good.

567
00:29:52,395 --> 00:29:55,300
Look, this is gonna be a long
summer ifwe have to go through

568
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:56,633
this evey day.

569
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:59,369
lf it was me, l'd wanna know
if a girl likes me or not.

570
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:02,305
And If not, then l'd start
liking someone else.

571
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:04,241
Albert, it's not something you
can turn off and on

572
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:05,808
like a water faucet.

573
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,676
lf you like someone,
you like someone.

574
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,015
Okay, then l'm going to go over
there and you guys see

575
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:13,215
if she notices me.

576
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:16,319
Then, when l get back, Dustin
you walk over and we'll see if

577
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,019
she notices you.

578
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,721
l'm not going overthere.

579
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,087
Well l am.

580
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,757
Albert.

581
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,639
Well, anything?

582
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:40,271
Nope.

583
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,774
She didn't even look.

584
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,376
Well l guess that's good then.

585
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,345
Alright Dustin, it's your turn.

586
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,679
l'm not going to do this.

587
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,746
You have to.

588
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,047
This is a good idea.

589
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,184
lf she looks up,
it's a good sign.

590
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:54,018
l don't know.

591
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:55,653
Mark, tell him.

592
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:56,954
He might have something here.

593
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:59,057
We Could watch her and
see how she reacts.

594
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:01,260
Might give you a good
idea if she likes you.

595
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:06,030
Okay, l'm going to do it.

596
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:16,973
Oh no...

597
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,241
How you girls doing?

598
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:21,009
Hey Nick.

599
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:22,211
Hey Nick.

600
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,681
PerFect plan down the drain.

601
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:35,790
Mark.

602
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:36,723
Yes.

603
00:31:36,823 --> 00:31:37,724
Telephone.

604
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:39,127
Be right there

605
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:46,465
Hello.

606
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:47,700
Hey Mark.

607
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:48,467
Hey Dust.

608
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,037
Hey, let me ask your
opinion on something.

609
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:52,873
Think l should write
Tanya another note?

610
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:53,906
Another note?

611
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:55,875
Yeah, she hasn't
gotten back to me yet?

612
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:57,476
l don't want to call her.

613
00:31:57,776 --> 00:31:59,880
l could ask her
about the first one.

614
00:31:59,978 --> 00:32:01,413
You really like her, don't ya?

615
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:03,183
Yes, l really like her.

616
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,418
And l'm not afraid to say it.

617
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:07,319
So what do you
think l should do.

618
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:08,888
l don't know.

619
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:11,789
Oh, let me see
what Albert thinks.

620
00:32:17,827 --> 00:32:19,029
And that was the
Big Tops

621
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,899
on W.A.L.B. radio.

622
00:32:20,997 --> 00:32:24,470
Next up we have a
classic from 1953,

623
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:27,038
but first we have the weather.

624
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,375
Sunny today with a few scattered
clouds and only a ten percent

625
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:32,075
chance of.. Albert.

626
00:32:32,174 --> 00:32:33,109
Yeah.

627
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:34,343
Telephone.

628
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:39,848
Hello.

629
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:40,515
Albert.

630
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:41,449
Dustin.

631
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,785
Hey Dustin.

632
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:44,419
Do you think l should
write Tanya another note?

633
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,387
What for?

634
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:47,323
Because she hasn't
answered my first one.

635
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,356
l wouldn't.

636
00:32:48,456 --> 00:32:49,457
Why not?

637
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:50,959
Because Nick likes her.

638
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:52,125
But she doesn't like him.

639
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:53,327
You don't know that.

640
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:54,361
Yes l do.

641
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:55,262
How do you know?

642
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:56,197
You're love blind.

643
00:32:56,296 --> 00:32:59,001
l am not love blind, l
just like herthat's all.

644
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:00,267
Then you're like blind.

645
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,170
Like blind, there's
no such thing.

646
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:03,103
You're not helping.

647
00:33:03,202 --> 00:33:04,337
l am too.

648
00:33:04,437 --> 00:33:05,806
Goodbye Albert.

649
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:09,542
What did he say?

650
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:11,978
He says he thinks it's
a mistake cause of Nick.

651
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:14,548
What does Albert know,
he's so immature.

652
00:33:14,846 --> 00:33:15,547
l think l shouldjust
write her another note.

653
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,850
Wait, a second let's
think this through.

654
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:20,286
You said in the first note that
you were going to come back and

655
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:22,889
see her at the diner
for an answer right?

656
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:23,854
Yeah and l did.

657
00:33:23,954 --> 00:33:26,993
But she doesn't knowthat
because she was gone.

658
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,192
Yeah, but what about today?

659
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:28,860
She had to notice us.

660
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:32,098
Yeah, but maybe there were too
many people there and she didn't

661
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:33,866
want to say anything.

662
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:35,232
Yeah, maybe you're right.

663
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,869
lf l were you, l'd go back down
to the dinertomorrow by myself

664
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:39,937
and tyto talk to her.

665
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,009
Okay, l will.

666
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,022
Excuse me, ma'am, where's Tanya?

667
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,291
Oh, Tanya and her familyjust
Ieft today for a vacation.

668
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,358
Vacation?

669
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,229
Well, ahh...Do you know how
Iong they're going to be gone?

670
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:09,266
l think they'll be gone
for at least three weeks.

671
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:10,498
Three weeks?

672
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,301
Can l help you with anything?

673
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,605
Um, No, no thank you.

674
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:18,538
Okay.

675
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:28,248
Three weeks is a long time.

676
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:30,084
l wonder where they're going?

677
00:34:30,182 --> 00:34:31,584
l don't know.

678
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:36,025
Her Dad probably makes lots of
money so he can afford the trip.

679
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,955
Yeah.

680
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:39,057
l think you shouldjust
forget the whole thing.

681
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:39,991
Why?

682
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:41,994
Because of one word, Nick

683
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,297
l already told you she
doesn't like him.

684
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,332
Dustin's right, Tanya
doesn't like Nick.

685
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,532
You don't know that.

686
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,267
And she might end up liking me.

687
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,103
Yeah, she might end
up liking Dustin.

688
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,638
Okay, Why are you repeating
eveything he says.

689
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:56,441
Because it seems that you need
to hear eveything twice so that

690
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:58,309
it sinks in that skull ofyours.

691
00:34:58,408 --> 00:35:01,045
l know l wouldn't want to be
liking the same girl that Nick

692
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:02,980
likes that's for sure.

693
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:04,213
Don't listen to him Dustin.

694
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,081
l'm not.

695
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,985
Fine, don't listen to
me, it's your funeral.

696
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,526
Dustin.

697
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,128
Dinner's ready.

698
00:35:19,227 --> 00:35:21,097
Okay, coming down.

699
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,227

l said: where you going?

703
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,132
Going to visit a friend.

704
00:36:02,299 --> 00:36:03,534

00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:05,004

00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:11,608
lt's a Bible.

710
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:12,610
A Bible?

711
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:17,582
Yeah, l'm going to Bible study.

712

Well, see you guys later.

715
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:26,656
Wait a minute.

Oops...Sory.

726
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:56,350

Sory l'm late.

729
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:31,017
You know l always keep an extra
copy ofthe Bible in case of

730
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:34,052
emergencies like this.

731
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,720
You know, many men have attacked
this book in order to keep

732
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:38,623
people from reading it.

733
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:44,632
You see, l'm almost glad that
this incident occurred today.

734
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:48,200
Because it will not be easyfor
you to followthe LORD and there

735
00:37:48,296 --> 00:37:53,272
will be many tying times
ahead as you live your lives.

736
00:37:53,735 --> 00:38:00,647
But remember, the Lord
is always with you.

737
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:06,219
Here you go, your own new
copy ofthe Word of God.

738
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:10,317
l can't take this
Bible from you.

739
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:11,351
lt's yours.

740
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:13,121
No, my friend.

741
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:14,821
This is yours.

742
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:17,658
Just agree with me you'll
put it to good use.

743
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:21,728

little higher now and l still

750
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:53,825
want to mow it if
you don't mind.

751
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:57,230
l don't need no one to
help me mow my lawn.

752
00:38:57,326 --> 00:38:58,696
But l said l would
do it forfree.

753
00:38:58,795 --> 00:38:59,863

754
00:39:00,162 --> 00:39:01,697

760
00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:10,205
No sir.

761
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:11,572

762
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:13,275
No sir, l don't have afather.

763
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:14,843
What happened to your father?

764
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,746
He died before l was born.

765
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:20,248
Oh.

00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:24,175
Hold on, l'm about to

794
00:40:24,272 --> 00:40:25,907

score is, Alberta.

No, l guess l'm done.

798
00:40:50,597 --> 00:40:53,436
He bosses people around and
picks on whoever he wants.

799
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:54,868
Yeah, and then you can be
playing pin ball and he

800
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:58,274
just come and move you right out
ofthe way and starts playing on

801
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,638
your money.

802
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,975
And he's always
taking our pizza.

803
00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:03,709
l just wish someone
could knock him.

804
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:05,679
l can't stand him.

805
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:10,352
Nick ruins it for eveybody
Mr. pery, not just for us.

806
00:41:11,882 --> 00:41:13,852
l see.

807
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,757
Excuse me.

808
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:28,401
lf you boys will,
please follow me.

809
00:41:28,498 --> 00:41:30,935
l have something l'd
like to showyou.

810
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:51,656
Look around gentlemen
take in this scene.

811
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:55,424
l come here often.

812
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:00,998
Yes, look around.

813
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:05,403
This is an important place to
visit while you are still alive.

814
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:08,337
And to listen.

815
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:10,805
But l don't hear anything.

816
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,940
l don't either.

817
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,313
Well, the Bible says in the book
of Ecclesiastes it's betterto

818
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,916
go to a house of mourning
than to a house offeasting.

819
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:22,415
And why?

820
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:26,655
Because death is the end of
evey man and the living will

821
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:28,921
take it to heart.

822
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,428
You see it makes us
think about our own life

823
00:42:33,524 --> 00:42:36,696
death and eternity.

824
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:39,633
That's why l come here.

825
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,501
Alright, listen.

826
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:45,870
l don't hear anything.

827
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:48,973
Alright stand closer
to the tombstones.

828
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:53,812
And listen vey carefully now.

829
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:57,681
But l'm still not
hearing anything.

830
00:42:57,779 --> 00:42:59,782
Put your earto the stone.

831
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:06,659
Why....why didn't you
tell me about Jesus?

832
00:43:09,124 --> 00:43:13,765
Why, why didn't you tell me l
needed the Lord in my life to go

833
00:43:13,861 --> 00:43:15,564
to heaven.

834
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:18,000
Keep Listening.

835
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:21,839
l am in agony in this place.

836
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:33,717
Think of eveyone you love
gentlemen, eveyone you know.

837
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:36,450
Even people you may dislike.

838
00:43:36,548 --> 00:43:38,718
And realize this.

839
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:44,561
One day, evey person will die.

840
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:50,700
They'll either go to
heaven or sadly...to hell.

841
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,366
There's no in between.

842
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,834
No second chance.

843
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:59,472
And no one can escape this fate.

844
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:04,577
Now as for Nick, the thought
that comes to mind are the words

845
00:44:04,673 --> 00:44:07,078
of Jesus.

846
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:11,718
Love your enemies, bless
them that curse you,

847
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:14,686
do good to them that hate you.

848
00:44:14,784 --> 00:44:18,090
And in Matthew chapter
5 the Lord says,

849
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:22,728
if a man strikes your right
cheek, offer him the other side.

850
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:28,067
And if a man compels you to
drive a mile, go with him two.

851
00:44:28,163 --> 00:44:30,700
What's all that suppose
to mean Mr. Spery?

852
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:35,641
lf your enemy takes a piece
of your pizza, offer him two.

853
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:48,147
Hi Mr. Barnes.

854
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:49,818
What do you want?

855
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,986
ljust wanted to stop by
to see howyou are doing.

856
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:53,586
How l'm doing?

857
00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:55,989
Yes sir.

858
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:58,926
You tying to make me feel
guiltyfor not paying you?

859
00:44:59,024 --> 00:44:59,725
No sir.

860
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,460
l just wanted to
stop by and say hi.

861
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:04,131
And who's the one
having you mow my lawn.

862
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:06,864
l had fun mowing it.

863
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:09,936
l'm going to find out who it is.

864
00:45:10,034 --> 00:45:12,806
Do you knowwho
Jesus is Mr. Barnes?

865
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:14,840
What kind of a question is that?

866
00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:17,443
ljust want to make sure you
go to heaven when you die.

867
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,909
You don't wory about me.

868
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,176
l started reading
my Bible Evey day.

869
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:22,582
ln the gospel ofJohn that's
where you can read about what

870
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:23,981
Jesus says.

871
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:26,985
l'm going back inside.

872
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,654
Well, okay, ahh it was good
talking to you Mr. Barnes and

873
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:31,754
see you again soon, when
your lawn needs mowing.

874
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:03,184
You have to put some
weight in the cup dummy.

875
00:46:03,283 --> 00:46:05,587
-Weight?
-Like a rock or something.

876
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:07,587
You gotta get it to go under.

877
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:16,862
lt was a little scay in
the cemeteyyesterday.

878
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:17,796
Yeah, l know.

879
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:19,833
lt Gave me the creeps.

880
00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:24,771
Mr. Spery sure does know
a lot about the Bible.

881
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:27,206
And he's been real nice to us.

882
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:28,907
We should do something for him.

883
00:46:29,006 --> 00:46:29,907
Like what?

884
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:32,211
l don't know, something.

885
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:35,513
We could buy him a present.

886
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:38,083
Yeah, but l don't
have vey much money.

887
00:46:39,283 --> 00:46:41,052
He's probably got eveything.

888
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,020
lt would be nice to do
something for him though.

889
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,824
Yeah, l know, he's
always giving us food.

890
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:52,162
Wait.

891
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:53,796
l got an idea.

892
00:46:54,095 --> 00:46:56,867
l want to thank you gentlemen
for this nice treat.

893
00:46:56,965 --> 00:46:58,935
lt was a pleasant surprise.

894
00:46:59,034 --> 00:47:00,603
Your welcome, Mr. Spery.

895
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:02,938
We figured we had to payyou
back for all that chocolate cake

896
00:47:03,038 --> 00:47:04,840
and ice cream that you give us.

897
00:47:04,939 --> 00:47:06,575
And don't forget the lemonade.

898
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:08,944
You do not have to pay me back.

899
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,780
lt's been my pleasure.

900
00:47:10,878 --> 00:47:13,716
But this pizza is a
vey nice gesture.

901
00:47:13,813 --> 00:47:15,650
Thank you my friends.

902
00:47:15,748 --> 00:47:17,218
We eat pizza here a lot.

903
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:20,322
You know, When l was young, we
never had a place like this.

904
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,591
We used to walk downtown and
just stand on the corner.

905
00:47:29,928 --> 00:47:32,198
Oh no, look whojust walked in.

906
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:38,837
lt's Nick.

907
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:42,240
Nick.

908
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:45,310
Better hide the pizza.

909
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,148
That's the bully we've
been telling you about.

910
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:50,048
l see.

911
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:53,317
He looks familiar to me.

912
00:47:55,118 --> 00:47:57,656
l wish he was on another planet.

913
00:47:57,754 --> 00:47:58,822
Tell me

914
00:47:58,922 --> 00:48:01,926
Hey Nick, look at that
old man overthere.

915
00:48:08,897 --> 00:48:11,668
Well, who do we got here.

916
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:13,069
Hi Nick.

917
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:15,137
So Dustin, who's the old timer?

918
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:17,106
This is our good
friend, Mr. Spery.

919
00:48:17,205 --> 00:48:20,044
Mr. Sparrow, ah isn't
that the name of a bird?

920
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:22,011
(his buddy laughs)
No, it's Mr. Spery.

921
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,712
Well, isn't it past
your nap time gramps?

922
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,749
'Cause l heard that all old
people took afternoon naps.

923
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:29,619
Come on Nick, leave him alone.

924
00:48:29,716 --> 00:48:30,751
He's our friend.

925
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,788
Hey, l amjust looking
after gramps' health,

926
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:34,288
make sure he gets his rest.

927
00:48:34,388 --> 00:48:36,825
Okayjust leave him alone.

928
00:48:36,922 --> 00:48:38,625
l'll talk to whoever l want to.

929
00:48:38,724 --> 00:48:40,861
But he's a nice man
and he's ourfriend.

930
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,064
l said l'll talk to
whoever l want to.

931
00:48:43,162 --> 00:48:45,299
Got it?

932
00:48:45,398 --> 00:48:48,036
Your Nick Meyers right?

933
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,171
Yeah, what's it to you?

934
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:52,105
Victor Meyer's son?

935
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:54,373
Yeah, so what.

936
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:57,678
l want you to knowyou can be
vey proud ofyourfather.

937
00:48:59,044 --> 00:49:00,045
Proud?

938
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,380
What makes you saythat?

939
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,084
Well, we use to work together
on a church committee.

940
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:06,686
And l got to know him veywell.

941
00:49:06,784 --> 00:49:10,824
He was a godly man did a lot
of good forthis community.

942
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:14,927
l know he passed awaywhen you
were quite young so ifyou would

943
00:49:15,024 --> 00:49:18,163
ever like to hear more
about yourfather,

944
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:21,066
feel free to drop by
my home for a visit.

945
00:49:22,198 --> 00:49:24,302
He was a wonderFul man.

946
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,871
You can be proud of him son.

947
00:49:26,968 --> 00:49:28,738
Vey proud.

948
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:36,245
Come on Roy.

949
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:46,755
Wow, that was great Mr. Spery.

950
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:50,092
Yeah, you shut Nick up without
even to have to fight him.

951
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:54,131
No gentlemen, this is
no time for rejoicing.

952
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:57,066
But Nick's a bigjerk
like that all the time.

953
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:59,767
l don't want to make
an excuse for him,

954
00:49:59,865 --> 00:50:03,405
but Nick has had a vey
difficult upbringing and he's

955
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:05,874
hurting inside.

956
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:12,216
So tonight, when you go home,
prayfor Nick and ask the Lord

957
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:13,946
to help him.

958
00:50:58,018 --> 00:51:03,763
Lord, Mr. Spery asked
us to pray for Nick.

959
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:07,463
l don't reallythink he
wants to be mean like he is,

960
00:51:07,561 --> 00:51:12,938
but ifyou could help
him...Thank you.

961
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:14,434
Amen.

962
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:01,479
A couple years
after you were born,

963
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:04,884
your father came to a revival
service at a church l was

964
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,582
attending.

965
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:10,521
And During that service, he came
to realize that he was a sinner

966
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:16,096
like all of us, and he needed
forgiveness forthose sins.

967
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:22,602
So he prayed and he accepted
Jesus as His Lord and Savior.

968
00:52:22,896 --> 00:52:26,269
He was born again.

969
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:29,572
You might not know
what that means Nick,

970
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,142
but it's a spiritual birth
in the Christian faith.

971
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,512
A lot of people thought it
just afad with yourfather,

972
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:40,316
but it wasn't, it was real.

973
00:52:40,412 --> 00:52:42,949
And His life changed
dramatically.

974
00:52:43,048 --> 00:52:45,285
You know what your father did?

975
00:52:45,384 --> 00:52:48,155
He went to all the people
he wronged and asked for

976
00:52:48,253 --> 00:52:52,027
forgiveness and then he did
eveything he could to make

977
00:52:52,123 --> 00:52:53,960
things right.

978
00:52:54,058 --> 00:52:57,431
lt was marvelous to see.

979
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:06,309
But, sadly, your Mom couldn't
accept his passion for God and

980
00:53:06,403 --> 00:53:10,911
she left ayear laterwhen
you were about 4years old.

981
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:15,883
But He became a good man
Nick, a really good man.

982
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:17,647
My mother didn't think he was.

983
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:20,584
Well, That's because she didn't
Accept his Christianity and it

984
00:53:20,683 --> 00:53:22,653
came between them.

985
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:27,626
Now l know it was tougher on you
growing up than most young men.

986
00:53:27,924 --> 00:53:32,164
But son, that's no
excuse foryour behavior.

987
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,562
lf you're father
were still here,

988
00:53:33,662 --> 00:53:36,601
l'm sure things would be a lot
different foryou right now.

989
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:38,300
Yeah, what makes you saythat?

990
00:53:38,399 --> 00:53:41,104
Because you wouldn't have to go
around and act like a bully to

991
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:43,003
get attention.

992
00:53:43,102 --> 00:53:45,306
You would have had your father
here to give you the proper

993
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:46,073
attention.

994
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:47,909
l'm sure of it.

995
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:51,279
And that's what l think
is really bothering you.

996
00:53:51,377 --> 00:53:53,414
Your mother works all the time.

997
00:53:53,513 --> 00:53:58,455
She's tired, l'm sure she's
cross with you at times you live

998
00:53:58,551 --> 00:54:03,393
in the same house but she goes
herway and you go yours.

999
00:54:03,488 --> 00:54:06,360
So you think you got
me all figured Out?

1000
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:11,099
l may be old Nick but my
eyesight is still pretty good

1001
00:54:11,195 --> 00:54:14,634
and l can see a hurting heart.

1002
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:16,502
The Lord Jesus is
here foryou, Nick,

1003
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,971
just like He was
foryourfather.

1004
00:54:19,069 --> 00:54:21,373
Just call out to Him.

1005
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:25,478
You know the path you're
on is the wrong one.

1006
00:54:25,575 --> 00:54:27,712
l shouldn't have ever come here.

1007
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:30,614
Nick,

1008
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:35,586
my door is
always open to you.

1009
00:54:41,623 --> 00:54:43,292
Always.

1010
00:55:14,787 --> 00:55:17,192
Can l talk to you
for another minute?

1011
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:20,127
Sure.

1012
00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:24,266
What did you mean by
''Call out to him''?

1013
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:28,169
Well, it's Really, quite simple.

1014
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:30,503
Just talk to him.

1015
00:55:30,602 --> 00:55:33,073
He's always there.

1016
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:12,741
HAH!

1017
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,076
What did you do that for?

1018
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:15,075
l could have got hurt.

1019
00:56:15,176 --> 00:56:15,776
What do you mean?

1020
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:17,480
You're suppose to ride on
the other side ofthe road.

1021
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:18,646
l am not.

1022
00:56:18,746 --> 00:56:20,148
You could have ruined my mower.

1023
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:21,481
You do have a pretty nice mower.

1024
00:56:21,581 --> 00:56:23,117
What's this thing?

1025
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:25,452
lt's my gas cap, l need that.

1026

He needs you Lord,

Come on Tyler.

1087
01:00:09,657 --> 01:00:10,692

01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,293
You play.

1089
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:13,595

1090
01:00:15,729 --> 01:00:17,264

Okay, honey.

1093
01:00:24,604 --> 01:00:25,572
l'm offto work.

1094
01:00:25,672 --> 01:00:26,305
Okay.

1095
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:27,908
Do you have to
Iawns to mowtoday?

1096
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:28,908
Yeah one.

1097
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:30,744
And then we go to Mr. Spery's.

1098
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:34,682
Alright gentlemen, l want you to
stand right here by that tree

1099
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,518
and l'm going take this
five-dollar bill and place it

1100
01:00:37,616 --> 01:00:40,420
right over here on this table.

1101
01:00:40,518 --> 01:00:42,889
Would you like to have this
five dollar bill?

1102
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:45,659
l bet you could buy a
pretty good pizzawith it.

1103
01:00:45,756 --> 01:00:47,559
Probably an extra large.

1104
01:00:47,658 --> 01:00:49,427
l knewyou'd be the
first to answer him.

1105
01:00:49,526 --> 01:00:51,831
But, you're going to have to
work together in orderto get

1106
01:00:51,929 --> 01:00:53,531
the money.

1107
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,669
Now one ofyou must be touching
that tree at all times and the

1108
01:00:56,766 --> 01:01:00,506
three ofyou must be holding
onto each other at all times and

1109
01:01:00,603 --> 01:01:04,376
ifyou can touch this
bill, then it's yours.

1110
01:01:04,473 --> 01:01:06,610
You can do with it as you wish.

1111
01:01:06,709 --> 01:01:07,944
But.

1112
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,946
lf you can't, then
it remains mine.

1113
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:11,748
ls that clear?

1114
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:12,548

1115
01:01:12,648 --> 01:01:13,649
Alright.

1116
01:01:13,749 --> 01:01:15,318
So we can never let
go of each other.

1117
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:17,553
That's right, you must be
connected to each other at all

1118
01:01:17,652 --> 01:01:18,954
times.

1119
01:01:19,053 --> 01:01:22,727

Mark, you hold onto the tree.

1123
01:01:28,363 --> 01:01:29,865

01:02:25,815 --> 01:02:27,384
Come on Albert, stretch.

1148
01:02:27,482 --> 01:02:28,684
lt's too far.

1150
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:34,090
Nick?

1151
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:35,692
What are you doing here?

1152
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:37,693
l asked him to stop by.

1153
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:39,061
You, Mr. Spery.

1154
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:40,696
Yes, l did.

1155
01:02:40,795 --> 01:02:42,598
But why?

1156
01:02:42,696 --> 01:02:45,735
l think Nick has something
here to tell you.

1157
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:55,947
Albert, Dustin, Mark, l came
here to see Mr. Spery a couple

1158
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:59,114
of days ago and we talked.

1159
01:03:00,746 --> 01:03:03,551
He talked about how my
father became a Christian.

1160
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:11,495
Then, l went home and l thought
about it and, l prayed.

1161
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:14,194
l prayed to Jesus.

1162
01:03:14,492 --> 01:03:17,531
l'm soryforthe way
l treated you guys.

1163
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,465
l know l've been ajerk.

1164
01:03:19,564 --> 01:03:23,905
But, ifyou will
give me a chance,

1165
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:27,005
l think that we
could be friends.

1166
01:03:27,104 --> 01:03:29,608
lf you would just
give me a chance.

1167
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:35,715
l know Nick has hurt the
three ofyou in the past.

1168
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,216
But, if he is truly
come to Christ,

1169
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,217
then the Lord has forgiven him
just like he has

1170
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,218
forgiven you and l.

1171
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:47,193
The Bible says if a man be in
Christ, he is a new creation.

1172
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:52,031
Old things have passed away,
all things have become new.

1173
01:03:52,126 --> 01:03:54,731
This is the new Nick

1174
01:03:59,733 --> 01:04:01,103
We understand.

1175
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:04,241
And if you are still interested
in that five dollar bill,

1176
01:04:04,538 --> 01:04:08,544
there's one more person
here to help so perhaps now,

1177
01:04:08,642 --> 01:04:10,745
there is away.

1178
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:16,751
Alright guys, let's
go for it again.

1179
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:18,519

01:09:31,204 --> 01:09:32,472
Never mind.

1255
01:09:32,572 --> 01:09:34,274
Maybe l'll just write
you another one.

1256
01:09:34,373 --> 01:09:36,410
ls there something
you want to tell me?

1257
01:09:36,508 --> 01:09:38,511
Ahh,

1258
01:09:38,812 --> 01:09:41,349
l'd rather put
it in a note form.

1259
01:09:41,446 --> 01:09:43,550
Okay.

1260
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:44,883
See ya.

1261
01:09:44,982 --> 01:09:46,518
See ya.

1262
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:50,989
So, as l was saying.

1263
01:09:51,088 --> 01:09:53,559
The next daythe guy l had met
came back down to the beach but

1264
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:56,329
this time he brought
his freshman friend,

1265
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:58,363
the one that was with him
the day before that saw me,

1266
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,931
but l never saw him.

1267
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,334
So she never got it?

1268
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,169
That's what she said.

1269
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:07,005
Well, that will
explain some things.

1270
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:08,204
Yep.

1271
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,374
You should have just
asked her right then.

1272
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:14,179
You know l was going
to but Cindywas there.

1273
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,911
Was she nice?

1274
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,513
Yes, she was pretty nice.

1275
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,182
That's a good sign.

1276
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,551
Maybe she doesn't like Nick.

1277
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:25,355
What are you going to do?

1278
01:10:25,453 --> 01:10:27,523
l think l'm probably going
to write her another note.

1279
01:10:27,622 --> 01:10:29,225
Why don't you just ask her.

1280
01:10:29,324 --> 01:10:31,026
l already told her.

1281
01:10:31,124 --> 01:10:33,896
She's probably going to be
at the pizzeria tomorrow.

1282
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:38,101
l'll drop it offto her after
we're done with Mr. Spery.

1283
01:10:38,198 --> 01:10:40,869
l don't want to bother
her at the diner again.

1284
01:10:40,967 --> 01:10:43,939
You're going to give it to
her in front of eveyone.

1285
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:45,338
Yep.

1286
01:10:45,438 --> 01:10:47,175
You got guts.

1287
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,188
Dear Tanya.

1288
01:11:03,288 --> 01:11:06,126
l think you are a vey
nice girl...

1289
01:11:07,592 --> 01:11:10,530
Dear Tanya...

1290
01:11:12,196 --> 01:11:16,504
The Scripture says the tongue is
a fire full of deadly poison.

1291
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,370
lt's one of the smallest
parts of the body,

1292
01:11:18,469 --> 01:11:22,209
but it can do the most
good orthe most harm.

1293
01:11:22,305 --> 01:11:24,242
So be careful what you say.

1294
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,946
Use your words to bless people,
not to criticize

1295
01:11:28,043 --> 01:11:29,880
or gossip about them.

1296
01:11:29,978 --> 01:11:34,252
lt's easyto put people
down, anyone can do that.

1297
01:11:34,349 --> 01:11:41,061
But, you, be different,
stand up with your kindness,

1298
01:11:41,155 --> 01:11:46,064
showthe love ofJesus in
eveything you say, or,

1299
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,933
in some cases,
what you don't say.

1300
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:53,302
Okay my friends.

1301
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:56,139
(the boys react) Let's
close in a word of prayer.

1302
01:11:58,571 --> 01:12:00,508
Then he left his
rainbowteddy-bear...

1303
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:07,583
Now remember gentlemen, our hot
dog cookout is scheduled for

1304
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:09,016
Friday at five.

1305

one you so please

1306
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,053

1307
01:12:17,556 --> 01:12:18,991
Alright boys,

1308
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:19,958
Bye-bye.

1310
01:12:21,025 --> 01:12:22,293
l won't eat lunch on Friday.

1311
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:23,428
Don't you dare do it...

1312
01:12:23,528 --> 01:12:26,500
Dustin, are you going down

1313

Albert.

1327
01:13:21,347 --> 01:13:23,084
l didn't mean to
tell you that part.

1328
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,122
You got such a big mouth.

Ahhh, Dustin.

1342
01:13:52,543 --> 01:13:53,443

1365
01:15:02,306 --> 01:15:03,676
Ahh, come on.

1366
01:15:03,775 --> 01:15:04,509

1368
01:15:06,845 --> 01:15:07,779
Dear Tanya.

1369
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:11,150
l think you're a vey nice girl
(we hear herfriend laughing)

1370
01:15:11,248 --> 01:15:12,850

01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:14,451
l want you to knowthat
something great

1372
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,420
has happened in my life.

1373
01:15:16,519 --> 01:15:18,256
l started reading my Bible
eveyday

1374
01:15:18,354 --> 01:15:19,689
and praying to the Lord.

1375
01:15:19,789 --> 01:15:22,694
l've come to realize that l need
Jesus in my life especially if l

1376
01:15:22,792 --> 01:15:24,595
want to go to heaven.

1377
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:27,599
So l just wanted to encourage
you to start reading your Bible,

1378
01:15:27,697 --> 01:15:29,366
in the gospel ofJohn.

1379
01:15:29,464 --> 01:15:31,367
l think it will help you too.

1380
01:15:31,466 --> 01:15:33,269
Well, that's all for now.

1381
01:15:33,368 --> 01:15:35,104
Your friend, Dustin.

1382
01:15:35,202 --> 01:15:38,341
PS, l am mowing lawns this
summer so ifyou don't have a

1383
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:40,676
Bible, l'll be glad
to buyyou one.

1384
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:58,358
Okay Mrs. Farley.

1385
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,493
Yeah l'll be right over.

1386
01:15:59,592 --> 01:16:00,593
Bye.

1387
01:16:03,163 --> 01:16:03,831
Mom.

1388
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:05,766
That was Mrs.
Farley on the phone.

1389
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:07,567
l'm going to go over right now
and help her clean out

1390
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:08,701
her attic.

1391
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,902
She's going to pay me.

1392
01:16:10,201 --> 01:16:11,136
Okay, honey.

1393
01:16:11,235 --> 01:16:12,438
Then l'm going to
go overAlbert's.

1394
01:16:12,538 --> 01:16:13,840
Have fun.

1395
01:18:02,272 --> 01:18:06,413
Jonathan Spery was a
God-fearing man, who loved life,

1396
01:18:06,508 --> 01:18:10,549
who loved his family,
who loved people.

1397
01:18:10,646 --> 01:18:13,985
But most of all, we knowthat
Jonathan loved the Lord and

1398
01:18:14,283 --> 01:18:16,887
touched all of us in some way
with the love that he had for

1399
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,520
Jesus.

1400
01:18:18,619 --> 01:18:21,390
Jonathan would tell us not
to weep for him today but to

1401
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:24,694
rejoice, because he is now in
the presence of his Heavenly

1402
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:26,628
Father.

1403
01:18:26,726 --> 01:18:30,400
l know it's hard for us because
we miss our dearfriend.

1404
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,903
But if Jonathan were still here,
l am sure that he would tell us

1405
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,706
to live on for Christ
and most of all,

1406
01:18:37,803 --> 01:18:40,775
to tell others what Jesus
did for them on the cross at

1407
01:18:40,873 --> 01:18:42,509
Calvay.

1408
01:18:42,608 --> 01:18:47,316
(beat) And now dear Jonathan,
as we lay your body to rest,

1409
01:18:47,412 --> 01:18:49,984
we believe that Jesus has
ushered you into heaven by His

1410
01:18:50,082 --> 01:18:54,356
saving grace, and may your
memoy continue to speak to our

1411
01:18:54,452 --> 01:18:59,294
hearts as we continue
on our earthlyjourney.

1412
01:18:59,389 --> 01:19:01,559
The Lord be with us all.

1413
01:19:44,464 --> 01:19:46,100
We need to go honey.

1414
01:22:32,051 --> 01:22:37,226
Dustin, please tyto eat
something, you'll feel better.

1415
01:22:37,524 --> 01:22:39,794
No, l won't.

1416
01:22:39,892 --> 01:22:42,596
l knowthis has been hard for
you the past few days but you

1417
01:22:42,693 --> 01:22:47,569

again with your life.

1418
01:22:47,665 --> 01:22:50,804
l'm not hungy, may
l please be excused.

1419
01:24:09,307 --> 01:24:12,646
Dustin, there's someone
here to see you.

1420
01:24:14,912 --> 01:24:17,082
l don't want to see anybody.

1421
01:24:17,181 --> 01:24:19,351
lt's Mr. Barnes.

1422
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,594
Mr. Barnes.

1423
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:32,028

1424

1425
01:24:34,997 --> 01:24:36,600
Let me get you
something to drink.

1426
01:24:36,698 --> 01:24:40,137
No, this will be fine,
It'lljust take a minute.

1427
01:24:40,235 --> 01:24:43,708
Dustin, l want to ask if
you will still mow my lawn,

1428
01:24:43,804 --> 01:24:45,874
l will payyou from now on.

1429
01:24:45,973 --> 01:24:47,743
You don't have to
pay me Mr. Barnes.

1430
01:24:47,842 --> 01:24:50,046
l enjoy mowing your
Iawn and talking to you.

1431
01:24:50,144 --> 01:24:54,385
l know it was Mr. Spery
who put you up to this.

1432
01:24:54,681 --> 01:24:58,187
And l can't let you mow my lawn
anymore unless you let me pay

1433
01:24:58,284 --> 01:25:00,789
you, are we in agreement?

1434
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:02,656
You don't have to Mr. Barnes.

1435
01:25:02,756 --> 01:25:04,960
Are we in agreement?

1436
01:25:09,228 --> 01:25:10,998
Yes sir.

1437
01:25:11,096 --> 01:25:14,970
Fine, that's settled.

1438
01:25:15,067 --> 01:25:17,871
Now, l knowyou are feeling
sad about Mr. pery and all.

1439
01:25:17,969 --> 01:25:19,806
we all are.

1440
01:25:19,904 --> 01:25:23,410
(beat) Ifthere was ever a
Christian man in this town,

1441
01:25:27,879 --> 01:25:30,917
it was Jonathan Spery.

1442
01:25:33,316 --> 01:25:38,860
(beat) So, you come mow my lawn

Reading all about Jesus.

1448
01:25:56,104 --> 01:25:58,208
That's great Mr. Barnes.

1449
01:25:58,306 --> 01:26:01,445

1454
01:26:15,456 --> 01:26:16,724
Thank you all.

1455
01:26:16,823 --> 01:26:18,793
Good evening.

1456
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,170
Can you believe that Mom?

1457
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,070
Mr. Barnes started
reading his Bible.

1458
01:26:31,169 --> 01:26:33,707
Yes, isn't that wonderFul.

1459
01:26:33,805 --> 01:26:35,875
ln the Gospel ofJohn.

1460
01:26:35,974 --> 01:26:39,880
And it's because of you.

1461
01:26:39,977 --> 01:26:41,814
l can't believe it.

1462
01:26:41,912 --> 01:26:44,216
Mr. Barnes.

1463
01:26:44,315 --> 01:26:46,787
Yes, that is surprising.

1464
01:26:50,988 --> 01:26:52,824
What's wrong?

1465
01:26:52,922 --> 01:26:54,892
Oh nothing.

1466
01:26:54,991 --> 01:26:57,128
No, what's wrong.

1467
01:26:57,227 --> 01:26:59,966
Aren't you happy Mr. Barnes is
starting to read his Bible?

1468
01:27:00,063 --> 01:27:03,135
Yes, honey, that's
wonderFul like l said.

1469
01:27:05,235 --> 01:27:07,071
Then, what is it?

1470
01:27:07,169 --> 01:27:15,818
Dustin, did Mr. Spery ever
tell you how his wife died.

1471
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:17,980
Yeah, she died in
a car accident.

1472
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:20,249
But did he evertell
you how it happened?

1473
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:27,925
No hejust said that it
happened fouryears ago.

1474
01:27:28,021 --> 01:27:29,858
Dustin,

1475
01:27:35,362 --> 01:27:39,001
that accident
was caused by Mr. Barnes.

1476
01:27:39,099 --> 01:27:41,770
He had been drinking and he
was the one driving

1477
01:27:41,867 --> 01:27:44,271
the other vehicle.

1478
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:47,008
Mr. Barnes caused that accident.

1479
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:50,177
Yes.

1480
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:57,117
And Mr. Spery paid
me to mow his lawn.

1481
01:27:58,383 --> 01:28:00,186
Yes.

1482
01:28:53,233 --> 01:28:54,301
Dustin.

1483
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,441
Always remember, the
Bible is your friend.

1484
01:28:58,538 --> 01:29:00,375
And so am l.

1485
01:29:00,473 --> 01:29:02,877
Keep living for Jesus.

1486
01:29:02,975 --> 01:29:04,878
Jonathan Spery.

1487
01:29:16,388 --> 01:29:17,188
Hello.

1488
01:29:17,288 --> 01:29:18,089
Mark.

1489
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:18,890
Dustin.

1490
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:20,292
We need to have a Bible study.

1491
01:29:20,391 --> 01:29:21,359
A Bible study?

1492
01:29:21,459 --> 01:29:22,127
Yeah.

1493
01:29:22,226 --> 01:29:23,561
Like the ones we
had with Mr. Spery.

1494
01:29:23,661 --> 01:29:24,429
When?

1495
01:29:24,528 --> 01:29:25,529
As soon as possible.

1496
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:27,333
You call Albert, l'll call Nick.

1497
01:29:27,431 --> 01:29:29,133
We'll get them to call
the rest ofthe guys.

1498
01:29:29,232 --> 01:29:31,904
We'll meet at my house tomorrow
afternoon at 2:OO o'clock.

1499
01:29:32,002 --> 01:29:33,637
But who's going to lead it?

1500
01:29:41,645 --> 01:29:44,016
Guys, l'd like to
thank you for coming.

1501
01:29:44,113 --> 01:29:46,383
lf you would please follow me,
there's something

1502
01:29:46,482 --> 01:29:48,285
l'd to showyou.

1503
01:30:08,335 --> 01:30:13,244
Look around guys
and don't be afraid.

1504
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:17,447
This is an important place to
visit while you're still alive.

1505
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:19,480
And listen.

1506
01:30:20,613 --> 01:30:22,049
l don't hear anything.

1507
01:30:22,148 --> 01:30:25,119
Neither do l.

1508
01:30:25,216 --> 01:30:29,123
The Bible says it is betterto
go to afuneral than afeast.

1509
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:31,190
You know why?

1510
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:36,399
'Cause eveybody dies one day
and when you go to a funeral you

1511
01:30:36,494 --> 01:30:38,965
think about it more.

1512
01:30:40,431 --> 01:30:43,403
Lean closer to the tombstones.

1513
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,038
Closer.

1514
01:30:46,136 --> 01:30:48,205
And listen.

1515
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:52,109
Really listen.
