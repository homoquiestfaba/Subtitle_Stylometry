This is Kenny. He spent

3
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,144
in jail for 6 months. The fact that Michael
said something to me that is not.

4
00:03:31,192 --> 00:03:36,824
What a surprise, but honestly
still well and passed.

5
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,309
I honestly do not know why

6
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,703
i hang out with people like Michael
is just asking for trouble.

7
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,614
But we sometimes ask
hell anyway.

9
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,005

00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:04,323

00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:33,916
I have a small problem. I killed a hooker
today.

156
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:37,739
Why did you kill a hooker?

157
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:39,365
It was an accident.

I told you to stay away from her!

186
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,195
I told you that I loved.

187
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:51,330
On the ground.

188
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:56,310
Now we're going to kill you.

189
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:08,390
Where are you going? You're not going anywhere!

190
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,081
On your knees!

191
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:22,509
He will not start.

192
00:28:23,524 --> 00:28:24,274
Does not work.

193
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:37,844
Shit.

194
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:39,884
What is it, dear?

195
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:41,814
You will not believe what happened.

196
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:43,999
'm In the middle of something.

197
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,472
I was in the bank, and these two are just
inflammation.

198
00:28:50,658 --> 00:28:51,920
Got clipped the big bucks.

199
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,222
Come on, let's go.

200
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,630
What to do?

201
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:06,907
What can I do, to fly there?

202
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:11,078
Fuck it.

203
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,904

206
00:29:20,682 --> 00:29:21,637
Where are you going?

207
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,408
Stay on your knees.

208
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:35,166
We have to go.
Finish with this.

209
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:00,611
Fucking Aziz!

210
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,498
On account that the head?

211
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:10,787
He's not the boss.

212
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:12,712
I'm the boss.

213
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:14,870
I'm doing all this.

214
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,799
What is this?

215
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:43,948
Do not shoot.

216
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:51,219
Shit.

217
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:59,709
Arapu stole that car.

218
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:06,258
Just follow them and do not be flashy things.

219
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:16,997
Damn!

220
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,847
I can not believe I shot.

221
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,928
I got to the hospital.

222
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:26,164
Oh, I'm taking you to the hospital right away.

223
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:27,808

Fuck Mom!

231
00:31:58,215 --> 00:32:00,604
This is not your idea.

232
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:03,689
Quit whining!

233
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,239
How much money do we have?

234
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:12,887

242
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:07,760
Someone stole my car.

243
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:10,654
Where is your car?

244
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:16,444
This man had a gun

245
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:20,443
i took the car. - Who? - If you're so stupid
you let it.

246
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:26,602
He was going to shoot me! Then
could not finish the mission.

247
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:28,910
Now we do not have any mission!

248
00:33:29,872 --> 00:33:33,103

00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:42,302
O, yes.

262
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:50,777

Yes, I'm talking to you.

279
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:36,667

Son of a drive as the drivers Indy 100

It seems to me that I hit them.
Oh shit, they fled.

309
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,757
- How the hell knows that we love?

- We'll put the drive on all the wheels.
- This is the car for that.

333
00:44:41,331 --> 00:44:42,673
Who's that up ahead?

- Do not break them, it's not my truck.
- Shut up and back off!

351
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:16,556
I try to be the best they can.

352

Refueled and hurried.

353
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:28,489
