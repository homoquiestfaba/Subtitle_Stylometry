00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,488
[gasps] What new makeup line?

166
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,033
<i>It's organic. It's like all from the farm,
which is what I'm calling it.</i>

<i>"Farm On My Face."</i>

It doesn't have to be real.</i>

Just bring you. I miss your stupid face.</i>

But I'm not just bringing me,

175
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,557
I'm also bringing a surprise.

Maybe. Maybe not.

- [chuckles]

179
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,947
[woman] We had a guy
who did our lights for years, Carl,

180
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,366
and I've been calling him
for days with no answer,

181
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,619
until just this morning,
his wife finally picked up

182
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,870
and told me he died,

183
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,371
hanging Christmas lights.

184
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,665
He fell on
someone's roof and broke his neck.

185
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,209
I'm sorry to hear that.

186
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,878
Thank God I found you.

187
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,589
I had no idea
TaskRabbits did Christmas lights.

188
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,926
Oh, they should call you TaskElves
during the holidays.

189
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,763
If it's okay, I'm gonna focus on this.
You know, so I don't fall off your roof.

190
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,640
Oh, here's my husband.

- No. He's with TaskRabbit. Carl died.

the fourth house he's done this week.

You know
you're a Chinese money plant, right?

Hey. How long are you going home for?

214
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,793
Ten days.

215
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,505
So maybe
you don't need that tower of sweaters?

216
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,217
[exhales] Maybe I'll just stay there
and never come back.

217
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,637
Mm, because Bridgewater, New Hampshire,
population 36,

218
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,848
has a huge buffet of single gay men.

219
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,728
The all-you-can-eat buffet in Los Angeles
has served me nothing but 7 heartbreaks,

220
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,897
a mountain of therapy debt,
and a chipped tooth.

221
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,141
Chipped tooth was your fault.

222
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,485
I was running away from the guy
that faked that he had cancer.

Maybe it's not L.A.
Maybe you choose the wrong guys.

Fine! I'll date no one,

225
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,368
but I'll be close to my family,
I'll open my plant store,

226
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,496
I'll be a guncle,
and a plant lady forever.

227
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,708
[exhales] Actually sounds perfect.

228
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,086
And plants don't cheat. [scoffs]
I think you should come home with me.

- It would solve everything.

00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,311
I can temporarily bury
the pain of my pathetic love life,

why we're not just together.

Oh, all straight people ask that
about gay friends.

241
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,120
I mean, besides I stocked up
for my first holiday staycation.

You've never done
a solo holiday staycation.

You've always had a boyfriend. Come on.

246

- Come home with me.

You don't wanna spend Christmas
all by yourself.

248
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,183
I won't be by myself. I have Emmett,
and an endless stream of TaskRabbit jobs,

249
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,602
which is all about helping people,
which brings me joy.

And if that isn't the
Christmas spirit, I don't know what is.

Nick, I don't want you
to be here all by yourself,

you had with your mom as a kid.

I know she'll always
be in your heart, but...

254
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,035
you shouldn't be alone
with those feelings at Christmas.

256
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,500
You want me to buy a plane ticket
leaving tomorrow?

I mean,
do you know how expensive that'll be?

Yes, thank you!

262

And you'll have even more money
when you finish writing the sequel,

263
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,683
which you really have to start
before you can finish.

264
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,810
Well, what if it's not as good
as the first one?

265

- Nick, it's a children's book about a dog.

00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,066
Sorry, Emmett. [chuckles]
I didn't mean it like that.

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,318
It's a lot to live up to.
You wrote such a good book.

became a bestseller,

[smacks lips] Well,
my early Christmas present for you is...

329
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,565
a blind date.

330
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,276
- [whimpers]
- His name is James.

331
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,905
He's really cute. He's about your age.
I really think you're gonna like him.

332
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,782
No! No, I'm not going on a...

333
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,494
You're not going anywhere
until I get a proper hug.

334
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,079
[chuckling] Hi, Dad.

335
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,166
- Oh, I'm glad you're home, son.
- [Peter] Aw.

336
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:22,463
- Nicholas, it's always good to see you.
- [chuckling] You too, Harold.

337
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,215
Okay, you can go. Where are you going?

338
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,259
- He's going on a blind date.
- No, I'm not.

339
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,845
- Yes, he is.
- [Peter] No. No, he's not.

340
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,224
How is there even a single,
"single" gay man in this town?

341
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,645
- Why wouldn't there be? You two are here.
- But why is <i>he</i> here?

342
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,731
That's a great question
for you to ask on your first date!

343
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,690
[chuckles]

344
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,775
I love it.

345
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,377
- [Carole] He loves it.
- You're going.

346
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,611
- You're going.
- Nick!

347
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,781
I just wanted to say,

348
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:53,410
thank you, for allowing me
to do a last-minute Christmas crash. It...

349
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,663
[Harold] Are you kidding? I'm thrilled!

350
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,917
But you're gonna have to excuse me because
we have a leaky pipe in the basement,

351
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,380
and I can't seem to fix it,
so I'm just gonna have to call a plumber.

352
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,715
Well, why don't you let me try and fix it?

353
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,220
No... No, are you sure?

354
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,140
Oh gosh, I hadn't thought of that.
Of course, I thought of that,

355
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,810
but Carole said I shouldn't ask you
because you're our guest.

356
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,769
A guest.

357
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,270
But I hate this plumber.

358
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,023
He overcharges,
and he smells like roast beef.

359
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,316
So, screw him!

360
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,694
We've got our own Handy Bunny right here!

361
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,404
- [titters]
- [chuckles]

362
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,740
TaskRabbit, Dad.
TaskRabbit. He's a Tasker.

363
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,700
- Rabbit?
- [Peter] Yep.

364
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,786
And I'm a little bit offended. How come
you didn't ask me to fix your pipe?

365
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,454
- Uh-huh.
- [Carole] Oh well...

366
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,373
- [Peter] Okay.
- Sweetie. [chuckles]

367
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:43,127
[scoffs] Okay, I didn't wanna fix
your stupid pipe anyway. Go. Go.

368
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,129
- Go help him.
- [Harold] Come on, let's go.

369
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,215
Honey, you're very talented.
You're good at so many things...

370
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,426
Oh, like, like fixing my poinsettias.

371
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,636
Oh, look how sad they are.

372
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,140
- [scoffs]
- What?

373
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,182
[Peter] Oh...

374
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,894
Go ahead. I'm sure you'll do your magic.

375
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,857
I'll try, but only if you drop
this whole blind-date thing.

376
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,859
No, Peter, come on.

377
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,527
[chuckling] I don't even live here.

378
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,612
I know it,
but wouldn't it be great if you did?

379
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,906
Okay, so that's what this is about.

380
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,241
It would be a bonus.

381
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,994
We only get to see
your face once or twice a year.

382
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:21,081
Yes, which is exactly why I'm here,
to spend time with my family.

383
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,293
Well, and your family really wants you
to have a relationship.

384
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,376
I'm just saying.

385
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,588
[chuckling] Yes, I know!
That's very clear!

386
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,594
- Why do you avoid love?
- Okay, stop. I don't... I'm not...

387
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,970
I'm not avoiding love.

388
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,931
I'm just avoiding getting
set up on a blind date by...

389
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,641
- Your mother?
- [chuckling] Right.

390
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,061
What's w... [gasps] You don't trust me?

391
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,271
Not with this, no.

392
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,815
Just because you happen
to meet a gay guy, doesn't mean

393
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,179
you have to set me up with them.

394
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,277
It doesn't mean that we'd be... You know...

395
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,198
You've told me that millions of times
when I've asked why you weren't with Nick,

396
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,241
but I understand much better now.

397
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,536
I'm reading this great book.
It's called <i>Loving Your LGBTT Child</i>.

398
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,413
[chuckles] I think you mean LGBTQ.

399
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,999
Yeah. Whatever. Do I?
Yeah. Sure, that's it! Yes!

400
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,917
And it's great.

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,462
It talks all about gay friendships,
and it says, just what you said,

402
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,591
"Much like a man and a woman don't have
to have a romantic relationship,

403
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,551
a man and man don't have to."

404
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,136
- Exactly.
- Mm.

405
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,430
But you never know! [clicks tongue]

406
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,891
You know, it's not every day
that you meet a gay handyman.

407
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,893
How did you learn
how to do all this stuff?

408
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,520
[grunts, sighs]

409
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,772
On YouTube and HGTV.

410
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,942
Oh. What is that?
A Homosexual Gay network?

411
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,110
[chuckles] Basically.

412
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,279
Oh. I'll check it out. HGTV.

413
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,406
It's not porn, is it?

414
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,117
Kind of.

415
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,205
But, honey, I really do think
this James guy is great.

416
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,124
He's a new trainer at my gym.

417
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,377
And he came in,
all the girls went crazy for him.

418
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,563
And then, of course,
he told us he was gay. [chuckles]

419
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,133
Audrey was devastated,
but I thought, "Gay? I know gay."

420
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,345
And so, I told him all about you,
I did, and I showed him your picture,

421
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,765
and he thought you were really cute,
and he would love to meet you.

422
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,934
[sighs deeply]

423
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,811
Show me his picture.

424
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,688
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah.

425
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,399
Wait. Wait, how...
Where would I find a picture?

426
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,682
I don't have a picture of him.

427
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,944
You don't have a picture?
You showed him my picture.

428
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,030
Well, I know, because I have
a hundred pictures of you in my phone.

429
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,866
I don't have any pictures of him.

430
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,201
I just met...
That would be weird. That's creepy.

431
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,078
- [chuckles]
- Oh, maybe he's on Facebook.

432
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,706
Honey, how do I do it?
How do I get into Facebook again?

433
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,958
- Oh my God, Mom.
- Oh wait, there it is. Okay.

434
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,003
Oh, look at that, sweetheart. [chuckles]

435
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,673
Look, it's a canary and a German Shepherd,
and they're besties.

436
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,593
- Look! They're doing the <i>Macarena</i>.
- [Peter] Wow.

437
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,098
I can't believe Christmas Carole
took down all your Britney posters.

438
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,809
I can't believe you ended
our relationship without consulting me.

439
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,187
Our relationship
hadn't officially started, so...

440
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,104
[Peter] Yes, it had!

441
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,024
In our agreed-upon fictional backstory,
it absolutely had.

442
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:57,404
And then you went and endorsed the idea
of me going on a blind date,

443
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,489
as if we were looking for a third.

444
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,450
It's one date.

445
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,409
Exactly.

446
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,410
It's one date.

447
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,954
One date is not
the same thing as a relationship.

448
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,125
And a blind date
has almost zero chance of working out,

449
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,712
and I'll still be single,
and it'll somehow all be my fault,

450
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,257
and it's all anybody
will talk about for the entire vacation.

451
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,883
[Peter sighs]

452
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,554
Do you know how excited I was
to bring Tim home to meet my family?

453
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,638
Yes.

454
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,056
I'm sorry.

455
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,226
But look at it this way,

456
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,038
at least you don't have to call
your mom in a month and explain to her

457
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,190
that the guy that you brought home
for Christmas is, oops, married,

458
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,900
to a woman, with kids.

459
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,986
And now I don't have to lie
to your family for ten days straight.

460
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,117
- You are the worst fake boyfriend.
- [door closes downstairs]

461
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:48,705
[Lisa] Don't get too excited!
It's just me, your favorite sister.

462
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,126
Where are you? Get down here.
I need to see your stupid face.

463
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,337
- [chuckling] Hey.
- [squealing]

464
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,838
- Oh...
- [chuckles]

465
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,841
[vocalizing]

466
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,593
- Bop!
- [laughs]

467
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,197
[Peter] Aw...
[squealing] Uncle Peter.

468
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,055
Hi.

469
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,723
You know what?

470
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,184
I got one of those memory things
on my phone the other day

471
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,579
from that night that you guys
took me out in West Hollywood

472
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,648
and made me get on that bar
with all those shirtless cowboys.

473
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,816
"Made" you. Mm...

474
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,150
- Mom!
- Mom!

475
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,068
What?

476
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,112
[whining] Am I not allowed
to have a good time?

477
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
I never get out.

478
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,825
- [scoffs] Lisa, we literally own a bar.
- We own a pub, Tony.

479
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,202
- It's not the same thing. [chuckles]
- [Tony groans]

480
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,746
[Carole] Leese,
I need help with the chicken!

481
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,083
[chuckles] Hi.

482
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,626
- [girl] Hi, Nick.
- Aw...

483
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,879
Bring it in. It's so good to see you.
Merry Christmas.

484
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,381
- Both of you.
- [Nick chuckles]

485
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,343
- Hi.
- They were gay shirtless cowboys, right?

486
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,303
- [Carole] Tony!
- Very.

487
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,614
- Super gay.
- [Carole] Tony, you need to come help me...

488
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,806
Coming, Carole!

489
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,684
Oh! Hi!

490
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,270
- [squeals, laughs]
- Hi! [gasps]

491
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,938
Hi!

492
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,526
Sam, Simon, you both got nine feet taller
than the last time I saw you.

493
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,612
Boys look who else is here!
Do you remember Nick?

494
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,906
Nick is your Uncle Peter's roommate,

495
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,200
but he also wrote your favorite book

496
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,911
that we used to read
every night before bed.

497
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,914
<i>- Saving Emmett?
- Yes, Saving Emmett!</i>

498
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,541
Is Emmett your real dog?

499
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,376
- Yes, he is.
<i>- </i>So where is he?

500
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,837
He wanted to come,
but he's afraid of flying

501
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,798
so he's home in California,
but he's very happy

502
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,259
because he's with
all his doggie friends at the hotel.

503
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,636
But what if he thinks you left him forever

504
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,181
like the first people did
before you saved him?

505
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,894
- Okay. Come on, let's say hi to Grandma.
- [whispering] He's so big.

506
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,646
- So, how was the trip?
- It was great! Merry Christmas.

507
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,523
You kids don't realize
how good you have it.

508
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,151
The first time
Aunt Sandy directed the pageant,

509
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,903
it was totally bonkers.

510
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,280
Okay, Mom, we've heard the story
a million times.

511
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,907
Yeah, okay, well, Nick hasn't.

512
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,618
So you don't have to listen,
and you can just sit there.

513
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,453
Anyhoo...

514
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,914
- [all chuckle]
- Aunt Sandy had just moved back here

515
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,375
from New York City,
where she had an acting career.

516
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,753
Well, "career" is generous,
but no, no, go ahead. Go ahead.

517
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,506
- She was in a Broadway show.
- It was Off-Broadway.

518
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,758
It was <i>Little Shop of Horrors</i>, right?
She was Audrey.

519
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,802
She was the understudy to Audrey.

520
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,678
Oh my God, Grandma, I love you.

521
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,263
I cannot tell a lie.

522
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,431
So anyways,

523
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:15,894
Aunt Sandy made me, and Uncle Peter
and Aunt Ashleigh be in the pageant,

524
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,564
just like she's making you kids do,
except our script,

525
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,733
Aunt Sandy wrote herself.

526
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,277
It took place backstage at the pageant.

527
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,280
It was like a play within a play.

528
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,366
So,
all four of you kids are in the pageant?

529
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,118
But we need to get out of it.

530
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,079
<i>- [woman singing] ♪ Joy to the world ♪</i>
- [gasping]

531
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,707
<i>- ♪ The Lord is come ♪</i>
- [indistinct chattering]

532
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:44,673

533
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,718
- Oh my gosh!
- [mouthing]

534
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,138
I'm so sorry,
everybody, I'm so sorry, I'm late!

535
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,141
I was going over
tomorrow's rehearsal schedule and...

536
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,518
and all of sudden
I got terribly distracted because

537
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,064
out of nowhere Whitney Houston's
version of "Joy to the World" came on

538
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,025
and that's...
It's the greatest version ever.

539
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,694
I love that version. You bring dessert?

540
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,531
And then I just started singing along,
then all of a sudden, I thought,

541
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,909
"Oh my God, Sandy,
you're having an epiphany."

542
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,204
"'Joy to the World'
needs to be in your show!"

543
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,664
Well, yes.

544
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,125
Because it's so spectacular.
It's got everything in it.

545
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,004
It's got the King, the Savior,
the Glory, and the Born.

546
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:24,963
The Born.

547
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,717
I've got so much to do before this show,
but I... I had to come here because

548
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,343
you're my first Joseph.

549
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,680
- I love you, I really do. I do.
- I love you too.

550
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,433
Oh my, my, my.

551
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,394
Well, well...

552
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,939
What a handsome new boyfriend.

553
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,483
No. No. [chuckles]

554
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,737
Uh, no, this is my handsome roommate
and oldest friend Nick<i>.</i>

555
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,863
Hi.

556
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,157
But he might have a boyfriend tomorrow!

557
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,244
- Mom, Mom, can we not do this right now?
- What? What? What's tomorrow?

558
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,746
Well, he's going on a date.

559
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,829
Wha...

560
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,249
- Like, from Grindr?
- No.

561
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,167
Oh my God.

562
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,627
No, like from Mom.

563
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,586
What?

564
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,630
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to tell everybody.

565
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,132
I thought you'd ruin it.
He might not get on the plane.

566
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,593
- [screams] Oh my God!
- Okay. Wow.

567
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,511
Okay. Thank you.

568
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,387
Hey, congratulations.

569
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,806
- Yay!
- Okay. Okay. [chuckles]

570
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,521
- Thank you all. Thank you so much!
- I'm sorry.

571
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,354
- I think they should be together.
- Yes, same.

572
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,040
- Let's discuss that later.
- [chattering]

573
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,359
Okay, can we please stop clapping
for the relationship you've decided I'm in

574
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,277
with the person
that I have not even met yet.

575
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,446
Okay, you're all gonna jinx it!

576
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,909
So, who wants to see
my new Christmas tree?

577
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,744
[giggling]

578
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,828
Oh...

579
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,413
- [Carole] What?
- [Peter] No...

580
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,083
Mom, a fake white tree?

581
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,334
Yes, I love it.

582
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,461
I mean,
you all can want, like, a real tree,

583
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,630
but I'm the one
who has to clean up the needles.

584
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,384
I love it. Nick loves it, don't you...
Nick, don't you love it?

585
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,595
It... Yes!

586
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,846
- [Carole] See?
- [scoffs]

587
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,724
Well... [scoffs]
...where are all the family ornaments?

588
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,435
She probably gave them away
with Sam and Simon's toys

589
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,020
I did not.

590
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,898
I think it is so cool and so modern.

591
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:07,899
And you know what?

592
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,151
These gorgeous stars came with the trees,

593
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,235
I love them.

594
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,862
I do too.

595
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,490
Give.

596
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,950
[gasps] Oh...

597
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,207
You're such a thief. [scoffs]

598
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,251
- [continuous rapid knocking]
- [gasps]

599
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,004
Stop!

600
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,801
[Peter grunts]

601
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,431
- [Nick] Time to get up.
- Thanks, Alexa, but I didn't set an alarm.

602
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,634
Your mom promised to kill me

603
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,362
if I didn't wake you
in time for your date.

604
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,687
It's not until one o'clock,
after her spin class.

605
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,107
Yeah, she's at the class.
It's noon. You have jet lag.

606
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,692
Well... [scoffs]

607
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,652
How come you're so perky?

608
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,738
Well, so much coffee. [chuckles]

609
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,491
I noticed your dad only finished doing
the lights on the bottom half of the house

610
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,744
so I wanted to get up
and finish it for him.

611
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,330
You don't have to impress my family.

612
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,833
I know I don't, but I wanted to do it.
And I'm good at it.

613
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,959
And I'm having fun.

614
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,171
But not as much fun as
you're about to have on this blind date.

615
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,464
Okay. Thank you.

616
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,091
Okay. Well, get dressed and get cute.

617
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,426
You're such a pusher.

618
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,387
- Don that gay apparel.
- Shut up.

619
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,599
[exhales]

620
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,400
[upbeat music playing]

621
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,448
- No, no. No!
- [message alerts beeping]

622
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,367
[gym instructor speaks indistinctly]

623
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,705
- I hate you so much.
- [message alerts beeping]

624
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:50,627
It... it flames,
flames, on the side of my face...

625
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,003
[gym instructor] Good.

626
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,172
- [applauding]
- [Peter] Well... Okay.

627
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,715
Oh! [chuckles]

628
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,133
[indistinct chattering]

629
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,976
I don't think he's really gay.
There's no way.

630
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,597
[gasps] You came.

631
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,099
You woke up.

632
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,850
Yes, hi. Yes, I woke up.

633
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,769
[techno music playing, intensifying]

634
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,402
So, this is James who I told you about,

635
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,447
and this is my perfect son, Peter,
who I told you about, obviously.

636
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,371
So, yeah... [chuckles] He's an Aquarius, so...

637
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,284
So, what happens now?

638
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,286
- Great to meet you.
- You too.

639
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,123
I, uh, was thinking we could grab
a cup of coffee.

640
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,874
We don't have Starbucks here,

641
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,585
but there's this cute little place
owned by Mrs. Claus,

642
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,796
and she makes a mean peppermint latte.

643
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,174
Oh, well, it's about time
Mrs. Claus branched out on her own.

644
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,175
[all chuckle]

645
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,678
Isn't he funny?
He's funny too. Very, very smart.

646
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,096
Yeah. And so handsome.

647
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,659
[James] Your mom is the best.
Talks about you all the time.

648
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,537
- I'm sure she does. I'm sorry about that.
- No, no, it's all good things.

649
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,814
You probably thought you were going
on a date with the hottest, smartest,

650
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,734
funniest, coolest,
most interesting person who was ever born.

651
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,777
Maybe I am.

652
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,945
- Oh!
- Mm.

653
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,739
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

654
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,741
No, I think that was my fault.

655
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,077
And now you know I'm not the coolest,
so we got that out of the way.

656
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,664
[clears throat]
So, um, why are you living in this town?

657
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,335
- Uh, oh, uh...
- Sorry, that sounded...

658
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,296
No! No, that's a fair question.

659
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,798
Last year I got a job
as a ski instructor at Eagle Hill.

660
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,134
Oh, I used to ski Eagle Hill
all the time growing up.

661
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:25,638
I was teaching there last season and
loved it, because, you know, free skiing.

662
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,726
But I was shuttling back and forth
to Boston weekly for my regular gym job,

663
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,060
and that got old real fast.

664
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,646
So this year I decided to move up
for the season.

665
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,901
Found a sublet, got the job at the
spinning studio, and I ski a lot more.

666
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:43,239
Wow. A ski instructor and trainer of moms
in a wintry Christmas village.

667
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,491
I love it up here.

668
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,575
But what about...

669
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,077
- Ah, yeah, the, uh...
- [scoffs]

670
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,580
...gay dating app radius is kind of a joke,

671
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,956
especially when it snows.

672
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,833
- It snows all the time.
- All the time.

673
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,339
And magically here you are.

674
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,633
Here I am.

675
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,677
- [coughs]
- Oh! Oh!

676
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,388
- Let me... Let me get you a clean one.
- Oh, thank you.

677
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,891
[Peter clears throat]

678
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,978
Real Christmas trees.

679
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,022
Hmm.

680
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,565
- Flip it around.
- [James] Yeah.

681
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,597
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I got it.

682
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,445
Getting these branches here.

683
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,864
- Okay. That's fine.
- Yeah.

684
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,535
- Did we do it?
- I think we did.

685
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,079
Except you won't be able to drive.

686
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,748
[chuckles]
Can't we just pull it back towards us?

687
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,874
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

688
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,293
[Peter grunts]

689
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,129
- Oh! Okay.
- Yeah.

690
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,756
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

691
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,299
- Hey!
- Okay.

692
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,846
- [sighs]
- [chuckles]

693
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,932
Well, should we ask Mrs. Claus?

694
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,103
Ah, she's busy, and you did tell me
you know what you're doing.

695
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,730
- I said that to impress you.
- [both laugh]

696
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,940
[message alert bleeps]

697
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,069
You got me a down vest.

698
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,152
Merry Christmas.

699
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,195
Thank you.

700
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,866
Aren't y'all breaking the rules?

701
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,952
I thought the whole point of this
was to keep presents a secret.

702
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,747
Rules are meant to be broken,
especially when it comes to insane rules

703
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,667
that make zero sense. [chuckles]

704
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,627
Why are we all in separate rooms

705
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,992
wrapping our gifts
at the same time at our mother's house?

706
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,757
Because that's what we did
when we were kids.

707
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,303
[chuckles] But now we're grown-ups
with our own houses,

708
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,971
so you're wondering,

709
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,432
"Why do they still
have to wrap them here?"

710
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,225
Great question, Nick.

711
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,519
And the non-answer answer
to that is because

712
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:41,149
this is the "Annual Harrison Family
Secret Wrapping Party,"

713
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,817
courtesy of Christmas Carole.

714
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,777
- [clears throat]
- Do we need wine?

715
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,905
- Yes, wine.
- We definitely do.

716
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:47,864
Oh, Nick! Nick!

717
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,742
Could you find out
what my mother is getting me?

718
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,036
And if it's another one
of her stupid signs,

719
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,330
tell her I'd like cash instead.

720
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,413
[Tony chuckles]

721
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,499
- Okay.
- Okay.

722
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,437
- Hey, Christmas Carole...
- [gasps]

723
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,254
Oh, I think I just peed a little bit.

724
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,464
Oh! [chuckles]

725
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,925
I thought you were Peter.
I'm wrapping his gift!

726
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,345
- Can I see what you're giving him?
- Yeah, you promise not to tell?

727
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,555
Ta-da!

728
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,142
"Bloom where you are planted." [chuckles]

729
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,727
- [chuckling]
- Oh, I love that.

730
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,062
I know! I love it too.

731
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,105
Oh, do you wanna see
the one I made for Lisa?

732
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,775
- Yes.
- Ready?

733
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,908
You know, she actually, um...

734
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,203
- What, honey?
- She sent me to get wine.

735
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,415
Oh, uh, we're out. I'll go get more.

736
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,626
[Nick] I got you. I just need your car.

737
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,968
[Peter] Well, I think we did it.
Can I give you a ride home?

738
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,096
- You think I'm getting in that death trap?
- [laughs]

739
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,139
I live a block away. I can walk.

740
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:56,848
But, uh...

741
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,060
I had fun.

742
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,144
So did I.

743
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,270
Yeah.

744
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,192
Bye.

745
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,276
Bye. Careful.

746
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
- Oh!
- It's icy.

747
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,240
Sh... Mm.

748
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,649
- [bottles clink]
- Oh!

749
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,735
- Oh!
- Oh!

750
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,403
- Hi.
- Hi.

751
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,613
Uh-oh. Is my family
already driving you that crazy?

752
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,198
Not at all. We're having a blast.

753
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,035
We ran out of wine midway through
your nutty present-wrapping thing.

754
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,537
For which wine is definitely required.

755
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,789
And you? Was the date that bad?

756
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,419
No. No, uh, I just thought that
if I showed up with wine for my mom

757
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,631
it'd soften the blow of the real
Christmas tree I'm also showing up with.

758
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,801
- You got a Christmas tree on your date?
- On the second half of the date.

759
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,887
On the second half of your date?

760
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,807
- That sounds promising.
- It's not promising.

761
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,560
- It's not promising?
- It's not, not promising. Shut up!

762
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,354
Well, if you didn't like him,
you'd be telling me right now.

763
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,316
- But we both know I like the wrong guys.
- So you do like him.

764
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,734
[chuckling] I didn't

765
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,527
have a bad time.

766
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,531
- Why are you being weird?
- I'm not being weird. You're being weird.

767
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,325
I just... [chuckles]

768
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,952
I didn't think that
this is what I'd be doing this week.

769
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,412
Yeah, neither did I.

770
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,955
And as your fake boyfriend,

771
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,875
I'm not sure how I feel about you
going on dates with other people.

772
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,585
You asked for it!

773
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,422
Well,
Christmas Carole will be very excited.

774
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,632
- Perfect.
- [gasps]

775
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,009
Shh! I got a new Christmas tree.

776
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,385
- Yay!
- [Peter] Shh!

777
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,109
Nick's gonna ask dad if we still have
the old Christmas tree stand.

778
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,098
Tony, I need your muscles.
Got a big tree to move.

779
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,976
Leese, distract mom
until we can make the switch.

780
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,231
Mom, I hope you're sitting down.
I have the craziest story to tell you.

781
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,484
Remember in grade seven
when Troy M. farted on me?

782
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,069
[indistinct chattering]

783
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,488
[Harold] Yeah, it is.

784
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,739
What's going on?

785
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,616
[screaming]

786
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,910
I had to pee! Sorry.

787
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,203
What is happening?

788
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,122
[Peter] This is all me.

789
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,999
I think that Christmas trees
should smell like Christmas trees

790
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,960
and be, you know, green.

791
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,255
I'll take care of everything,
change the water, clean up the needles,

792
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,843
and you should know that I got the tree
on my date with James,

793
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,511
and the date went well.

794
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:42,223
And... And actually,
James picked the tree out himself.

795
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,641
Oh! [gasps]

796
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,352
Oh, I'm so happy! That is so great!

797
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,188
I can't tell you how happy that makes me!

798
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,107
I think you're making that pretty clear.

799
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,734
[gasps] And then maybe...
maybe you'll move home!

800
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,819
[cheering]

801
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,530
All right. Okay. It was one date.

802
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,656
[phone vibrates]

803
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,991
[phone vibrates]

804
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,537
What? It's a text.

805
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,913
Uh, maybe it's him.

806
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,332
It could be anyone. It's probably work.

807
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,668
- [phone vibrates]
- [whispering] Pick it up.

808
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,420
- Well, check.
- [scoffs]

809
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,087
All right.

810
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,218
James wants to know
if I wanna go skiing tomorrow.

811
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,346
[Tony] All right! Yeah.

812
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,433
- [Carole and Lisa squealing]
- [Peter] Okay, okay. All right.

813
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,144
How about we let them celebrate

814
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,606
and you and I will take
this fake tree to the garage, huh?

815
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,483
Yeah. Sure. Let's do it.

816
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,318
[clears throat]

817
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,825
So, what do you think
of this whole blind-date thing?

818
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,162
[scoffs] If Peter's happy, I'm happy.

819
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,789
Hmm. [exhales]

820
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,834
I always thought that
you and Peter should be together.

821
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,588
[chuckles] I think you're angling
for a full-time handyman.

822
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,132
- Well, I wouldn't mind.
- [cupboard door closes]

823
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,050
But, no.

824
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:03,054
You were the first person Peter introduced
us to that meant anything to him.

825
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,763
You're the only one.

826
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,894
And over the years, I can see that
he's happiest when he's with you.

827
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,481
But you've never seen him
with any of his boyfriends.

828
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,564
No, I haven't.

829
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,945
Probably because none of them
ever lasted that long.

830
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,323
You lasted.

831
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,534
Well, I'm his best friend.

832
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,038
Well, my wife is my best friend
in the whole world. So?

833
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,417
We agree with Grandpa.
We think you and Peter should be together.

834
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,794
[emotional music playing]

835
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:40,966
[groans]

836
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,718
Oh! [scoffs]

837
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,389
[scoffs] I can't wear this.

838
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,099
- Bro.
- Exactly. [chuckles]

839
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,619
From when you went skiing
with your girlfriend in high school?

840
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,397
Last time I wore this,
I was... [inhales sharply] ...17 years old.

841
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,691
So, yes, it's a sign. I'm not going.

842
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,962
I don't need to leave you alone again
all day with my family, anyway.

843
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,363
Why not? I love being with your family.

844
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,366
I told your sister I'd take all the kids
to the pageant rehearsal.

845
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,285
[chuckles] You did?

846
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,913
I love my family too, and you've spent
more time with them than I have.

847
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,477
You'll have plenty of time with them.

848
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,792
Plus, you like this guy.
Plus, you already said yes.

849
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,627
I'm not opposed to ghosting.

850
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,796
I know. Maybe that's part of your problem.

851
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,506
Maybe you're part of my problem.

852
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,883
You know what, I actually dig the outfit.

853
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,385
It's a good story.

854
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,863
If he doesn't like you because of
a throwback fashion moment,

855
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,472
then he isn't for you anyway.

856
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,599
And, you don't have to go out
with him again.

857
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,142
Well...

858
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,353
- See?
- [exhales]

859
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,027
[bells chiming]

860
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,948
"Mary worried what the angel meant
by the greeting."

861
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:50,536
"Seeing she was scared, the angel said..."

862
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,164
"Don't be afraid, Mary. God is..."

863
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,582
Wait. Wait.

864
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,375
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

865
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:01,756
I don't know what you're doing here,
but I need to see you scared.

866
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,343
And see, that way, he can see your fear
and then his line works.

867
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,888
Aunt Sandy, I don't know what to do.
So, why don't you just show me? [chuckles]

868
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,348
[screams]

869
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,265
[gasps]

870
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,725
[indistinct chattering]

871
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,269
Try that. All right, now take note.

872
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,855
- [exhales]
- Can you believe this insanity?

873
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,816
Looks like Aunt Sandy needs some help.

874
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,276
No one's listening!

875
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,486
Listen!

876
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,737
Listen!

877
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,946
Listen!

878
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,658
I didn't wanna mention punishment,

879
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,537
but I'm telling you,
I can be really scary.

880
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,582
- Can you write me a doctor's note?
- [indistinct chattering]

881
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,459
I'm not a doctor.

882
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,795
So? You just have to write the note,

883
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,422
and you and I can go rescue Peter
from his date.

884
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,424
How do you know he wants to be rescued?

885
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,510
He doesn't realize it yet,

886
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,886
but once you show up,

887
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,306
he'll realize that you're the one
he wanted to be with all along.

888
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,810
- [chattering continues]
- No, no. I can't. I'll lose it!

889
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,813
Do you all wanna see me lose it?

890
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,650
- What are you getting him for Christmas?
- Don't you have to be up there?

891
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,153
- [sighs] I'm after this.
- [Sandy] We're gonna take it from the top.

892
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:07,822
I'm the donkey.

893
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:12,118
"Our story begins
with a young woman in her home...

894
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,121
Mary."

895
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,630
[dramatically] "Unless you look deeper,

896
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:32,596
there's nothing
particularly remarkable about Mary."

897
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,683
[giggles]

898
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,143
That's my favorite part.

899
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,521
[Peter] So, my best friend, Nick,
came home with me,

900
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,567
and the whole plan was that we were
going to pretend we finally fell in love.

901
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,944
- Why?
- Because...

902
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,863
[exhales] ...my family is terrified

903
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,425
that I'll be alone forever,
and I didn't want to hear about it.

904
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,701
But that's really cool
of your friend, though,

905
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,619
I mean, to play along
with the whole charade.

906
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,330
That kind of thing comes easily to us.
It's how we met, actually.

907
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,959
- How'd you meet?
- Nine years ago, I had just moved to L.A.

908
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,044
Uh, it was literally my second day in tow,

909
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,549
and I was doing what every gay guy does
on his second day in a new city.

910
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,759
- Joining a gym.
- Correct.

911
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,431
And Nick was also there
doing the exact same thing.

912
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:19,518
He had also just moved to L.A.,
but we didn't know any of this yet.

913
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:24,064
And then I heard that the couple
ahead of us was getting a family discount.

914
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,691
- Wow.
- We didn't have to say a word.

915
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,736
When it was our turn,
we improvised the whole thing.

916
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:33,032
We were from Chicago.
We'd been together for three years.

917
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,826
We were engaged,
but we didn't have the rings yet.

918
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,915
We'd just driven all the way to L.A.
with Chelsea, our African gray parrot.

919
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,167
I mean... We got the family discount.

920
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,921
- That's an amazing story.
- We've been best friends ever since.

921
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,798
Have, uh, you and Nick ever...

922
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,882
No.

923
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,675
No.

924
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,056
[girl] <i>Danny's right.</i>

925
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,642
<i>You can't just not get
Uncle Peter a present for Christmas.</i>

926
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,227
He's not my boyfriend.

927
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,812
So? He's not my boyfriend either.
I'm still getting him a gift.

928
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,523
Wait, you are? What are you getting him?

929
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:09,568
Mom's just putting our name on something.
But, Nick, you have to get him something.

930
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,238
Look, I appreciate what you're...

931
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:16,742
whatever you're trying to do,
but Peter and I have a long history.

932
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:20,204
We've never gotten each other
Christmas presents. We've never...

933
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,830
actually done Christmas together.

934
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,582
- Aw.
- Aw.

935
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,417
- Let's get a photo.
- Yeah.

936
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,380
- [Sandy] I want to see all of your acting...
- [exhales]

937
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,143
- [camera clicks]
- Can you do a funny one?

938
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,051
[camera clicking]

939
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,972
Oh! My nieces with Nick right now.

940
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,764
Oh...

941
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,766
You have FOMO.

942
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,269
[chuckling] I do.

943
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,271
I'm a FOMO-sexual.

944
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,354
[laughs]

945
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,983
I mean, obviously,
I wanna be here with you...

946
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,152
but I don't get to see
my family very often.

947
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,281
- Oh, I hope I'm not causing any drama.
- No. Quite the opposite.

948
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,117
Everyone... Everyone's very happy I'm here.

949
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,869
Part of it is that
they want me to move back home.

950
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,122
Oh! Do you ever think about that?

951
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,205
All the time.

952
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,376
But then...

953
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:12,006
Work-wise, New Hampshire is not exactly
the social media capital of the world.

954
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,842
Oh well, I wouldn't miss my job that much.

955
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,511
Because your real passion is plants?

956
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,013
How'd you know about that?

957
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:23,601
You don't think I found you on Instagram
@MrHausPlant? H-A-U-S?

958
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,893
That's not fair.

959
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,814
My mom didn't have any pictures of you.
I couldn't find you anywhere on Instagram.

960
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:32,735
@SkisTheLimit. S-K-I-S.

961
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,028
Oh. Uh-huh.

962
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,905
Ski's the limit. Yeah.
I get it. I like it.

963
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,033
[ski lift clatters]

964
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,413
[Nick] "It was Emmett's third day
in the shelter."

965
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,623
"He was trying to sleep

966
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,625
so he didn't have to
think about being sad,

967
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,002
but he was so sad."

968
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,421
"Then, all the other dogs started barking,

969
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,466
which meant a human was
there to save one lucky dog."

970
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,302
"But, Emmett didn't bark.
He just wanted to sleep."

971
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,640
Am I right or am I right, huh?
Uncle Peter insists on a real tree.

972
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:06,060
He says he's gonna deal with it.
And here we are, hanging ornaments

973
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,647
- for the second time and cleaning up.
- [whirring]

974
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,567
Well, he would be here if he wasn't with
the guy you set him up with.

975
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,818
[vacuum stops]

976
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,738
Yeah, you're right, honey.
I just wanted to complain. [chuckles]

977
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,573
I get that. [chuckles]

978
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,327
Why isn't he back yet?
I'm just gonna text him at this point.

979
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,704
- No. No, no, no. No, no, don't text him.
- [whirring]

980
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,581
- Leave him alone.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

981
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,085
[Nick] "So, Emmett sat
in the truck next to the man,

982
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:36,340
and they drove
and drove and drove." [chuckles]

983
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,550
"Now, when they walked
into the man's apartment,

984
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,844
the man said, 'We're home!'"

985
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:44,431
- Is that your real apartment?
- It's a drawing of it, yeah.

986
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,517
Where you live with Uncle Peter?

987
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,476
Yep.

988
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,229
Then why isn't Uncle Peter in the book?

989
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,106
It's a good question.

990
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,858
When did you and Uncle Peter get married?

991
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,152
[girls laughing]

992
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,905
[laughs] We're not married, no.

993
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,365
What are you, then?

994
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,328
- [Nick clears throat]
- Hey, you should totally write a sequel.

995
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,331
Well, have you been talking
to my publisher?

996
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,667
- You wrote it already?
- No.

997
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,876
- Oh.
- But I will.

998
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,087
- Mm-hmm.
- As soon as I figure out a good story.

999
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,841
I know. It should be
about Emmett at the hotel.

1000
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,343
During Christmas like he is right now.

1001
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,221
It should be sad at first
because you're leaving him,

1002
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,640
but then it's happy
when you come and pick him up.

1003
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,017
Right. And Uncle Peter
would pick him up with you.

1004
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,520
- Do you guys wanna write the book?
- Oh no, I don't.

1005
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,480
Okay, look, come on.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

1006
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,773
[boys laughing]

1007
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,277
- [Peter] That was great.
- [James] You killed that last run.

1008
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,839
[Peter scoffs] Only after you showed me
what I was doing wrong.

1009
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,114
Well, it is kind of my job.

1010
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:45,242
Don't think I didn't realize
I got a free private lesson.

1011
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,164
I just hope you don't feel like
you were working all day.

1012
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,714
Not at all.

1013
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,219
Should we, uh, après-ski?

1014
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,221
- We should après-ski.
- [phone vibrates]

1015
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,516
Sorry. Sorry. I... [sighs]

1016
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,021
[chuckles]

1017
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,400
Actually...

1018
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,569
Am I that bad a kisser?

1019
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,030
- Horrible.
- [chuckles]

1020
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,698
I wasn't gonna say anything.

1021
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,494
- Thanks for understanding.
- Of course. Family comes first.

1022
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,747
And, uh, you can just, uh,
Venmo me for the private lesson.

1023
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,290
[laughs]

1024
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,043
- Oh.
- [laughs]

1025
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,426
- I had a really great time today.
- Me too.

1026
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,680
- [engine starts]
- [door shuts]

1027
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,859
- Hey!
- Damn! Wow! You scared me.

1028
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,362
So? How'd it go?

1029
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,780
It was...

1030
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,741
kind of great. [chuckles]

1031
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,034
Okay!

1032
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,117
Yes!

1033
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,703
Uh, details?

1034
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,875
[Danny] It's so obvious.
How come only Grandpa sees what we see?

1035
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,559
All you gotta do is look at their faces.

1036
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,503
It's pure love.

1037
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,047
I know, but why don't even they see it,
is the question.

1038
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,965
Love is blind.

1039
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,676
No. No, that's when you fall in love
with someone who's ugly.

1040
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,054
- [indistinct chattering]
- Why are you looking out of the window?

1041
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:33,141
Just two people who look at each other
like that are not just friends.

1042
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,768
You're totally right.

1043
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,647
Oh, you're all insane.
Peter just went skiing with James.

1044
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,525
He's just probably
telling Nick how great it was.

1045
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,987
- What's happening?
- No, no, no, no!

1046
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,741
[Tony] Aw. Is one of them proposing?

1047
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,619
Maybe Nicholas actually listened to me.

1048
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,081
What do you mean?

1049
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,833
What did you tell him?

1050
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,461
Sounds like a solid, amazing date.

1051
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,338
Except I was gone all day.

1052
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,091
Well, you were skiing.
It's kind of an all-day thing.

1053
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:09,428
- Yeah, but it's already dark out.
- It's dark because it's winter.

1054
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,930
I know. [chuckles, exhales]

1055
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,473
I just wanted to be here too.

1056
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,060
- Because you were feeling FOMO-sexual?
- Yes! I was.

1057
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,186
[chuckles]

1058
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,273
I only have so much time here and...
I don't like that.

1059
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,943
I wanna be able to go on a date
and be in a relationship,

1060
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,864
and also go to Lisa's house for dinner
at the drop of a hat,

1061
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:32,451
or go to a movie with my dad,
or take the girls shopping or...

1062
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,288
I don't know,
Coach Simon's Little League team.

1063
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,456
Mm.

1064
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,791
Right. I'm obviously
never coaching a Little League team.

1065
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,253
But I don't want it to be
this one-or-the-other thing

1066
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,755
for the rest of my life.

1067
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,592
Well, it doesn't have to be,
but you'd have to move back here.

1068
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:52,512
That's what I'm saying.
I think I do wanna move back here.

1069
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,479
Oh. [chuckles nervously]

1070
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:07,069
So, you really must like this guy
if he's got you thinking about all this.

1071
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,446
Yeah, I don't know.

1072
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,282
It is two dates. [chuckles]

1073
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,452
I think he's just the straw
that broke the camel's back.

1074
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,913
Please, just listen to me.

1075
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,666
Mom, you're just pushing this James guy
because you set them up.

1076
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,709
You have to look
at what's really happening here.

1077
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,877
No, you do.

1078
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,088
Listen, I totally get it.

1079
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,590
For years I've been pressuring Peter
to be with Nick.

1080
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,676
They're so close and so great together,

1081
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,679
but that doesn't mean
they have romantic chemistry.

1082
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:37,683
This is a common misconception
we straight people have about gay people.

1083
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:41,395
But then I read my book called
<i>Loving Your LGBTTT Child</i>.

1084
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,896
Okay, I'm not buying it.

1085
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,149
Nick and Peter wanna make out.
They should make out.

1086
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,278
Nick is hot. Nick is a ten.
And Peter's a ten in New Hampshire.

1087
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:54,116
We just have to make sure Peter doesn't go
on any more dates with this James guy.

1088
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,910
- Yes!
- You can't just decide what Peter does.

1089
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,204
Okay,
sometimes people need a little shove.

1090
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,330
It's true. It's true.

1091
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,574
Jim and I wouldn't be married

1092
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,710
unless Lisa had forced me
to reply to his message on Match.

1093
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,378
What? You weren't gonna reply?

1094
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,022
- You're welcome.
- [chuckles]

1095
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:12,426
And that's exactly what we need to do,
is force them to spend more time together.

1096
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,612
They're roommates and best friends.
How much more time

1097
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:15,716
should they spend together?

1098
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,640
Okay, but time here, in a new environment.

1099
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,226
It's Christmas. It's romantic.

1100
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,186
You know,
it's not their normal day-to-day.

1101
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,024
And when I think about it,
what do I actually have in L.A.?

1102
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,692
A... A... A job I don't love,

1103
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,902
an overpriced apartment,
an overpriced car.

1104
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:36,491
There are people that I like in L.A.,
but you're the only person I love.

1105
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,495
Well, I would, uh...

1106
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,165
really miss you.

1107
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,086
[car approaching]

1108
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,840
[Sandy] Thanks, Trish!

1109
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,011
- [car door closes]
- [groans]

1110
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,473
Aunt Sandy? You okay?

1111
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,434
Yeah.

1112
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,810
- Okay.
- [mumbling softly]

1113
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,396
Oh, whoa. Here, let me... I... got you. Okay.

1114
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,940
Aunt Sandy, what's wrong?

1115
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,027
"All the world's a stage."

1116
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:16,656
"And most of us are desperately
under-rehearsed."

1117
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,493
- Mm.
- Who said that?

1118
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,787
It wasn't Shakespeare.

1119
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,870
Who?

1120
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,000
- I can't remember. That's why I asked.
- Oh.

1121
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,503
[Sandy] It could've been Captain Kangaroo.

1122
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,921
He was smart.

1123
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,431
I don't think
we should all meddle like this.

1124
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,258
From the Queen of Meddling!

1125
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,513
No! I don't want any part of it.
Whatever makes my Peter happy, right?

1126
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,140
- [Harold] That's it. You're right.
- [girls] Amazing! Us too.

1127
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,725
[giggling, chattering]

1128
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,192
Meddle, meddle, meddle, meddle.
King of meddle.

1129
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,357
Well, I'm glad you're all
having so much fun,

1130
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,235
but I just thought everyone should know

1131
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:59,032
that the pageant is
a giant load of crap on a stick.

1132
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,661
And not in a good way,
if you know what I mean.

1133
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:03,744
[sighs]

1134
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,373
What's the good way?

1135
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,626
[Sandy] I don't know. It's worse
than crap on the floor.

1136
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:15,465
Okay, seriously, Nick and Peter need
to help Aunt Sandy with the pageant.

1137
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,925
- Yes!
- Wait!

1138
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,594
Are you insinuating
that just because Nick and Peter are gay,

1139
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,012
that they know theater?

1140
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,557
Because that's another misconception
I read about in my book.

1141
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,560
No, Mom. What I'm saying is
Peter is really creative

1142
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:30,313
and he puts together, like,
productions and photo shoots all the time.

1143
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,150
And Nick is super handy,
and he can build things like sets,

1144
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:37,279
and the whole point of this is
to force them to do more things together.

1145
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,491
Oh, Aunt Sand. Aunt Sand.

1146
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,702
Let Peter and Nick help you.

1147
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:47,164
You shouldn't have to do this
all by yourself. You know?

1148
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,500
Jesus H. Christ.

1149
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,836
I know. I know.

1150
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,547
No, that's the title of my play.

1151
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,256
Oh...

1152
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:01,136
It's just such a huge undertaking.

1153
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:05,140
If Peter and Nick would like
to give me some help, that would be great.

1154
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,852
It's not because the gays know theater.

1155
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:15,317
It's because the gays just know
how to do stuff, you know?

1156
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,652
I mean, they're survivors.

1157
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:23,992
And for some reason,
they're always obsessed with me.

1158

1159
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,205
I don't know why...

1160
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,416
but I like it.

1161
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,922
I'm not saying it's definite. [exhales]

1162
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,173
I'm just feeling...

1163
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,967
- [exhales]
- A lot of things.

1164
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,928

- All right.
- [sniffs]

1167
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,185
- Here.
- [chuckles]

1168
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,687
- Oh, well...
- [mellow music playing]

1169
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,734
Now you'll be cold.

1170
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,403
We can go inside.

1171
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,197
I'm done.

1172
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,241
Done with what?

1173
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,244
Come here.

1174
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,836
[Peter chuckling] Oh!

1175
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,004
[whispering] Wow!

1176
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,467
Thank you...

1177
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,552
for this,

1178
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:29,182
for being so great with my family...

1179
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,476
for...

1180
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,437
you.

1183

[stomping foot]
Help. My wife is about to have a baby.

1184
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,839
My rooms are full.

1185
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,758
All I can offer is my stable
where we keep our animals.

1186
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,468
At last, I can have... I can have...

1187
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,679
Stop! Stop!
You're reading from your scripts!

1188
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,724
I was very clear about this.

1189
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:15,270
I said, "Everybody needs to be off book,
or I'm gonna be doing their dialogue."

1190
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,772
And I'm gonna have to do just that.

1191
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,816
None of you have any lines.

1192
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,570
None of you. None of you.
None of you. None of you.

in Bethlehem looking for a place to stay."

"They nearly gave up
and then they tried one last place."

1195
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,224
Help! Help, please.

1196
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,852
My wife, she's having a baby.

1197
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,773
"Are you kidding me? My rooms are full."

1198
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,610

where we keep my animals."

[panting]

1200
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:08,698
Thank you so much, sir,
we... we really thank you. We'll take it.

1201
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,116
Oh my God!

1202
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,744
[crying, moaning]

1203
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:17,957
I have to have this baby.
Please, give me some privacy!

1204
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,002
That's how it's done.

1205
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,380
[grunts] Aunt Sandy.

1206
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,674
Can I have a word with you?
Just a quick word?

1207
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,929
I just want you to know that,
you calling me over here

1208
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,306
and I'm in the middle
of directing a scene,

1209
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,767
it makes me look like
I don't know what I'm doing.

1210
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,478
Sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to do that.

1211
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:43,483
I just thought that maybe, I had, um,
maybe Nick and I could help you here.

1212
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,485
Oh, yeah? What do you got?

This isn't fair.

1245
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,278
- You've got a job to do.
- Yeah, but we aren't getting paid.

1246
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,031
- Yes, you are, in cookies.
- [phone ringing]

1247

If you'll excuse me, this is my boss,
who does not pay me in cookies.

Lachlan, hey. [chuckles]

1249

Are we still going live on Christmas Eve?

Ha! [chuckles] LOL.

Wait, are you serious?

No!

1253
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,049
They can't just... No.

1254
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,051
Tell them that...

1255
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,763
Offices are closed.
Everyone's away, including me.

1256
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,139
I'm in New Hampshire.

Agh!

1259
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,897
Three months of work and they want me
to deliver a new campaign in one day.

1260
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,982
Huh, what was wrong with the first one?

1261
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,361
Nothing! But suddenly the CEO decided
he doesn't want to use influencers.

1262
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:54,948
He wants to use "real" people.
Which still means models, by the way.

1263
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,510
All the agencies are closed.
My photographers aren't available.

1264
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,410
Just tell them that it's not possible.

1265
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,664
- Thanks, Mom. I did. They don't care.
- Would you like for me to call them?

00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,383
Oh, you're very funny.

1270
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:17,762
No, you're real. You could be a model.
You're a ten! He's a ten!

1271
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,932
No! I mean, I'm sorry.

1272
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,601
I have something
to do that needs to be done.

1273
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,938
So I'm gonna go do it. So it's done. Okay.

1274
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,232
[exhales] Hmm?

1275
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,317

Good idea. One of your best."

1279
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,245
I know who you are,
and I see what you're doing.

1280
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:46,040
You're pretending like you're helping
your son solve a work problem,

1281
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:50,753
but really, you're manufacturing some sort
of a romantic thing between them?

1282
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:54,132
I was doing both.
I was helping and manufacturing.

1283
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,176
Highly sophisticated.

1284
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,222
- Good! Oh, that's good.
- I can't believe you're making me do this.

1285
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,225
Okay, this will work.
Can you look... Can you look at me though?

1286
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,562
Oh! Very good.
I think that's your new author photo.

1287
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,832
- Now you just have to write a book.
- Oh, you're funny.

1288
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,899
- Can you up look at me?
- [shutter clicking]

- Oh.

Oh. Oh, smolder.

Okay, take off the jacket
and the gloves and the... and the shirt.

1293
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,748
Pick up a piece of wood.
Not that one. Here. Like a round one.

1295
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,345
You need a little bit more...
Hold this for me.

- Yeah.

1298
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,808
I'm sorry.

1299
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,935
Oh yes!

1300
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,562
Come on, give me a big smile.

1301
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,564
- Okay. Here. It's stupid.
- Okay.

1302
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,817
- I shouldn't even be in this campaign.
- No, I like this, but you know what?

1303
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,737
Oh, you just look so cute.

1304
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,907
Yes, yes, do you wanna lean
your head up against the tree?

1305
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,241
Oh, there we go.

1306
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,205
Oh my God. Yes. Yes. Now put it on.

1307
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:11,501
- Make sure you don't get any...
- There you are. This is really cute.

1308
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,753
- I have an idea I wanna do.
- Like what?

1309
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,130
- I want you to look right into the camera.
- Mm-hmm.

1310
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,884
On three, breathe out
so I can see the fog on your breath.

Okay. Ready?

Okay.

01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,366
- Oh.
- What? Work? Let me guess.

1320
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,577
They've changed their minds again,
and now they want girls.

1321
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,414
But real girls. With their boyfriends.

1322
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,958
It's James. He wants to grab a drink.

1323
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,041
Ooh.

1324
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,544
But I'm not going.

1325
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,462
I, ugh, have all this work drama

1326
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,215
and I don't need to spend
any more time away from my family.

1327
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,049
Right?

1328
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,304
Well, you have been
with the family all day.

1329
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,557
And we might have just solved
your work problem.

1330
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,184
So... I think you should probably go.

1331
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:16,232
- You should come with.
- No. I don't need to be a third wheel.

1332
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,109
- You wouldn't be.
- I literally would be.

1333
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:21,487
- [scoffs] Why do you want me to go?
- Because I think you wanna go.

1334
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,657
- I think you want me to wanna go.
- I think you're overthinking it.

1335
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,324
Just go.

1336
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,496
Okay. I'll go.

1337
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,340
- All right.
- [delivery notification bleeps]

1338
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,959
[mellow music playing]

1339
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,042
I'm going.

1340
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,173
[music continues]

1341
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:46,471
[message chimes]

1342
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,697
[groans]

1343
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,494
Black and gray doesn't scream
very donkey to me.

1344
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,496
- Well, I just...
- No.

1345
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,498
No?

1346
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,381
Where are you going? We need help.
I have to figure out my Mary makeup.

1347
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,139
I need to show you the new donkey costume.

1348
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,212
I'm on the fence about it.

1349
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,257
I'm actually off to do a TaskRabbit gig.
Peter left to grab a drink with James.

1350
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:26,469
- No, he didn't. What?
- Where? Mom and Dad's bar?

1351
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:27,552
No idea.

1352
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:31,474
Well, it's the only bar in town.
Nick, you need to stop this.

1353
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,683
[chuckles]

1354
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,895
[footsteps receding]

1355
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,688
[phone ringing]

1356
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:38,815
Lisa's Crisis.

1357
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,651
It's us. Is Peter there
with that guy grandma set him up with?

1358
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,904
They're here. And it's not good.
James is super-hot.

1359
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,740
Oh my God, I hate James so much.

1360
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,576
Mom, you and Dad need to ruin this date.

1361
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,538
Just spill their drinks on them.
Oh, tell lies about Peter.

1362
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,541
Just do whatever you need
to get rid of this guy.

1363
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,749
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
- On it.

1364
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,210
Give me a burger!

1365
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:02,839
We need to find Nick and make him do
something about his feelings.

1366
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,550
He went to that TaskRabbit gig.
We have no idea where he is.

1367
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,343
He was walking. He can't be that far.

1368
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,473
Nick's basically been on his own
since he was 17, so...

1369
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,308
he just had to do everything.

1370
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,603
He basically built the whole set
for the pageant in a day and a half.

1371
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,357
You know, you talk about Nick a lot.

1372
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,069
Oh, well, you know... [scoffs]

1373
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,404
He's my best friend.

1374
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:29,282
No, it's sweet. If I had a best friend
who could fix anything,

1375
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,075
I'd be bragging about him too. [chuckles]

1376
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,158
You're lucky.

1377
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,535
[chuckles]

1378
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:35,787
Yeah.

1379
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,539
I guess I am lucky.

1380
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,583
[clears throat]

1381
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,588
- Oh! Oh my God!
- Oh!

1382
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,797
Peter!

1383
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:49,343
- Wh... What? How is that my fault?
- Oh, you weren't looking.

1384
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,220
I am so sorry.

1385
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,265
I mean, this is typical Peter, you know,
in his own world,

1386
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:58,477
just thinking about himself,
not about anyone or anything around him.

1387
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,479
- [stammers]
- [Lisa] Here's a napkin.

1388
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:04,191
Seriously, when I was 11 years old,
he ran over my science project

1389
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:07,486
with his remote-control
Barbie Baywatch Rescue Cruiser.

1390
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,488
Oh my God! And the worst part was that

1391
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,867
I had actually figured out how to stop
the polar ice caps from melting,

1392
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,161
but I couldn't remember
how I figured it out.

1393
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:19,707
And now we have climate change
because of Peter. Honestly, just... Oh!

1394
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,876
I can't even with you.

1395
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,795
It's just... He's so selfish.

1396
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,339
[groans]

1397
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,758
- [Danny] Nick!
- [groans]

1398
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,430
Admit you're in love with Peter
or we're not putting the ladder back.

1399
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,391
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Does it look like we're kidding you?

1400
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:41,437
[sighs] We've talked about this.
Peter and I are just friends.

1401
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,521
You guys are more!

1402
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:46,275
And we think you know it,
but you're not doing anything about it.

1403
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,360
[chuckles]

1404
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,112
I know you care,
but this not the... Okay, wait!

1405
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:53,406
[exhales]

1406
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,743
[emotional music playing]

1407
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,244
I do love Peter.

1408
01:05:58,704 --> 01:05:59,704
You're right.

1409
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:02,375
You mean you're in love with Peter.

1410
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,961
Right. Yes.

1411
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:09,548
- I can't believe I'm saying this out loud.
- So you're gonna do something about it?

1412
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:13,094
I would if the feeling was mutual,
which I don't think it is,

1413
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:16,013
considering Peter is currently
on a third date with someone else.

1414
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,139
[door creaks open]

1415
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,475
[man coughs]

1416
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,227
Um, ladies... [chuckles]

1417
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,688
...I would like to keep
my five-star rating, please.

1418
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,028
Your family obviously cares
a great deal about you.

1419
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:34,532
- [chuckling] Sometimes too much so.
- What do you mean?

1420
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,702
Well, this may be weird to tell you, but,

1421
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:43,624
um, my family has always had this thing
where they think that Nick and I

1422
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,334
are supposed to be together,

1423
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:52,717
which is weird because here I am
on an actual date, a third date with you.

1424
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:55,928
Maybe they're onto something.

1425
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,724
What if you and Nick have
an undeniable connection

1426
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,934
that everybody can see but you?

1427
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,354
Don't you have one of those friends
everyone assumes is your boyfriend?

1428
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,980
Hmm.

1429
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,024
No.

1430
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,694
Oh. [inhales]

1431
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,195
- [phone vibrates]
- [exhales]

1432
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,405
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1433
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:18,617
[Peter] It's my boss.

1434
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,006
This is random, but you wouldn't be
interested in being in a Raazr ad

1435
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:34,800
for Instagram if they pick you, would you?

1436
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,011
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, that's...

1437
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:38,637
- Yes!
- Oh.

1438
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,431
- Yeah.
- Okay! [laughs]

1439
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,101
It will be fun. Um, um, I just need...

1440
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,896
- Yeah, so... I need something from...
- Yeah.

1441
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,440
Okay.

1442
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,115
- Great!
- Yeah.

1443
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,200
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1444
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,660
[laughs]

1445
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,746
This is great.

1446
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:04,663
I wanna do one more.

1447
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,956
Look right into the camera

1448
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,709
and on three breathe out,
so I can see your breath. Okay?

1449
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,503
- Okay.
- Ready? Here we go.

1450
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:14,006
One, two, three.

1451
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:19,845
It's great.

1452
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:22,555
Really good.

1453
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,643
Well, you're a lifesaver. [chuckles]

1454
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:27,061
It was a lot of fun.

1455
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:28,938
[keys jingle]

1456
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:30,481
- Well, this is me.
- Oh.

1457
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:33,859
Do you wanna come up?

1458
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,612
Uh, sure.

1459
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:39,823
Actually...

1460
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:44,161
[clicks tongue] I should probably go home.

1461
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,373
The girls need me for the pageant and...

1462
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,041
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

1463
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,169
I look forward to seeing it.

1464
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,506
That is, if I'm invited?

1465
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:58,175
Yeah. Yeah, of course you're invited.

1466
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,970
- I'll make sure there's a ticket for you.
- Great. [exhales]

1467
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,972
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

1468
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,390
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1469
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,474
[keys jingle]

1470
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,235
[exhales]

1471
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,870
What the? [scoffs]

1472
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:27,453
Really?

1473
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:29,957
[sighs deeply]

1474
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,010
Don't snore.

1475
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,513
[breathing heavily]

1476
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,438
- Hey.
- Hey, sorry.

1477
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,525
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1478
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,609
The...

1479
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,154
- The girls are in my bed.
- [chuckles]

1480
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:02,406
Of course, they are.

1481
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,619
- Of course, they are.
- [chuckles]

1482
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,204
[emotional music playing]

1483
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,460
[Nick groans softly]

1484
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,007
[both sigh]

1485
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:32,269
- [Lisa] Absolutely not.
- [Danny] You don't know what looks good.

1486
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,646

1522

to move back here.

1530

1531

What would be here for him?

1532
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,771
- You.
- And us.

1533

Admit it. You have feelings for him.

Have I had feelings
for Nick in the past? Yes.

But the risk is too...

If Nick and I ever went there
and it didn't work out...

1538
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,336
I would lose him.
And I don't want that to happen.

1539

But what if it did work out?

1540

Why aren't you responding to my texts

I mean, I've been painting and you...

You first texted me
eight minutes ago. [chuckles]

- The book money.
- But you're saving that for a rainy day.

That wasn't clear?

When I said I was in love with you before,

1864
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:56,719
you said you wanted to move back home
and didn't include me in those plans.

1865
01:31:56,802 --> 01:31:58,930
Then you invited me to go out
with you and James

1866
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:01,974
and I didn't get,
"I'm in love with you too" from that.

You said you wouldn't leave L.A.

1868
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:07,104
I never said that.
I said I'd miss you if you moved here.

1869
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,941
- That implies that you're not moving here.
- You never asked.

1870
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:11,817
I know. I was scared.
