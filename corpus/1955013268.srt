00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:33,589
So you think mankind
is just gonna be wiped out?

178
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,858
Except those chosen by the Lord.

179
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,332
Officially, ifs called NS 115.

180
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,892
İt's a decommissioned nuclear facility...

181
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,429
built during the cold vvar
in Mount Rogers, Virginia.

182
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:46,907
Wnds gonna be in this government ark?

183
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:51,471
Officials, top scientists.

184
00:13:52,637 --> 00:13:55,379
But mainly...

185
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,477
it’|| be those chosen by the Lord.

186
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,598
Do you think you'll be
one of them, Winston'?

187
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:00,386
It's up to him.

188
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:02,447
Critics of your Web site say you’re crazy.

189
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:04,891
What do you have to say to them?

190
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:12,631
The call to arms against the re-animates...

191
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,728
has shattered many
social boundaries including...

192
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:19,070
age, F806, EVEN 86X.

193
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,441
Lefs meet the only Woman in R-Division 8...

194
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,446
Rose Matthews.

195
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:26,539
During the outbreak, I was a nurse...

196
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:29,175
and my husband was a paramedic.

197
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,584
He was one of the first to get infected.

198
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:34,180
Back before we really knew
what it was.

199
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:36,782
As we prepare to go out into the field...

200
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:39,556
some of the team members
become introspective...

201
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:43,030
While others cope
with their problems differently.

202
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,930
- Camera man.
- Ah, God!

203
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,991
That's not funny, guys.

204
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:51,232
Omar Hernandez. l-low did you end up here'?

205
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:55,142
I got caught ripping off
a store near the edge of The Zone.

206
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,679
I had two strikes against me already.

207
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:00,875
People had to eat. People vvere starving.

208
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:03,680
They’re still starving.

209
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,743
The judge gave me a choice.

210
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,021
Fifteen hard in Chino or two doing this.

211
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:17,994
Excuse me. Sergeant.

212
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:22,971
Did you vvant to answer a couple of
questions about yourself before-

213
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:25,701
So the sergeant has a lot on his mind.

214
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:27,174
That's fine. I get it.

215
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,802
We'll get an interview from him later.

216
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,575
After arming up, we left
for our first mission...

217
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:34,844
and I got a chance to speak
more with the team.

218
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:38,547
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Tom, you look nervous.

219
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,680
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No, ifs okay. We can bleep it out.

220
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,316
Yeah, well-bleep this shit,
you...

221
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,122
- Whoa, okay.
- Guys, come on.

222
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:47,595
- You're ruining my show.
- l-low come the show's
about him anyway, huh'?

223
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:49,393
What the-
makes you so special?

224
00:15:49,454 --> 00:15:51,559
I'm gonna get to everybody.

225
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:54,933
Sergeant, do you Want
to say something, please?

226
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:58,701
- Just Sarge.
- Right. Sarge.

227
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:00,538
The team has just arrived at a small farm.

228
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:02,168
Whafs the plan, Tom?

229
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,440
Re-Ans inside. Search and destroy.

230
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:06,914
- You two stand back. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

231
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:08,473
Lefs move.

232
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,883
<i>Come on, Bobby. l_et's go.</i>

233
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:14,980
Looks like they’re gonna try...

234
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:16,616
and make contact with vvhoeveﬁs inside.

235
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:18,126
- Get down!
- Oh, my God!

236
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:26,565
Two tours in Afghanistan...

237
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:29,195
one tour in Iran, one tour in Pakistan...

238
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,467
before it Went up in smoke.

239
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:33,941
That place was-.

240
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:37,343
The guys got soldiering questions,
they come to me.

241
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:40,212
- Cover me!
- Got him!

242
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,379
Move! Move!

243
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:45,853
Sarge is approaching the front door.

244
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:49,256
Jesus!

245
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:55,788
Stay down!

246
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:58,026
- Get the-out of my way! Move!
- Oh, okay!

247
00:16:58,089 --> 00:16:59,227
- Move!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

248
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,099
- Where is it?
- Where’s What?

249
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,706
Matthews, Hernandez, check it out.

250
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,869
Yeah. <i>I'll</i> go with them to the barn.

251
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,844
I'm staying with the Sarge.

252
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:14,881
- Keep close.
- Yeah.

253
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,054
- We got Re-Ans.
- What?

254
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,283
Why would they keep Re-Ans in a cage?

255
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,884
- Call it.
- On three.

256
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:26,053
One, two-

257
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,458
Wait!

258
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:32,194
Sarge?

259
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,739
Sarge, What are you doing?

260
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:45,910
Oh, Jesus.

261
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,075
Just food for whatever
they got inside.

262
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:53,274
All right, you camera boys
want to know why we're here'?

263
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,728
We’re— We’re protecting her.
We’re protecting her.

264
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,492
We’re gonna see ifthere’s gonna be a cure.

265
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:05,261
You dorft know there’s not.
You dorft know there’s not.

266
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:06,893
Tell me where.

267
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,768
You dorft know What ifs like
to see-to watch your-

268
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:13,741
You think you're the only one
who's lost somebody?

269
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:15,903
He’s hiding something.

270
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,243
Where is it?

271
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:21,239
I do R-Division two years.

272
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:25,185
I get a green card for
me and for my family.

273
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:27,849
Thafs why I do this.

274
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:31,018
- Where is she?
- The attic.

275
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:32,584
In the attic.

276
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,960
We have a confirmation
there’s a Re-An in the house.

277
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,158
Remember five years ago?

278
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:40,691
L-low it spread so quickly?

279
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,260
People got bit...

280
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:46,775
but hoped against all hope
that they vvouldrft turn.

281
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,708
They hid their infected relatives...

282
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:53,909
their husbands, wives,
girlfriends, cousins, whatever.

283
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:58,215
They were all dead, all infected...

284
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:01,621
but we ooulcln't accept it.

285
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,286
Couldrft let it go.

286
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:08,455
It was our humanity
that nearly wiped us out.

287
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,556
Shit. Shit.

288
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,897
All right, rookie. You ready?

289
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:14,917
- It looks like we're moving in.
- I'm sorry, Sis!

290
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,404
- I'm sorry!
- Shut up!

291
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:19,937
Okay.

292
00:19:19,997 --> 00:19:22,034
We are headed upstairs.

293
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:32,481
Oh, God! lt smells awful.

294
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:34,045
Oh.

295
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:55,604
I think I hear it.

296
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:03,618
<i>_</i>
D|d you get it? Did you get it?

297
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,361
Get her, Winston! Find her!

298
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:21,801
Goddamn it!

299
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,600
Tom got bit.

300
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:26,471
Oh, no. Ah.

301
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,703
Eve Please, no!

302
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:46,587
- Sarge.
- Dispatch.

303
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:48,153
- Sergeant.
- R-Division 8, over.

304
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,755
<i>- [ Dispatch j Dispatch. Go ahead
- Sarge!</i>

305
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,993
- One re-animate located
and destroyed. Over and out.

306
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:55,230
Sarge, he’s turning! Sarge!

307
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:03,534
I was a lost soul.

308
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:08,313
Did a lot of bad things
before the outbreak.

309
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:11,182
Then I found God.

310
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:13,518
And I was reborn as one of his warriors...

311
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:17,252
to remove these things
from the garden of his creation.

312
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:20,352
Do you really believe that, Winston?

313
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:38,976
Mom?

314
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:41,277
Mom died during the outbreak.

315
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:43,215
And-

316
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,349
No, she vvasrft infected or anything.

317
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,051
She— She starved during the long Winter.

318
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:52,788
So... she Went out human.

319
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,729
- Ls that important?
- Yeah.

320
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:58,289
I mean, we-

321
00:21:58,355 --> 00:22:01,393
You know, we're born human.

322
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:04,065
We die that Way.

323
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:05,664
You know, not like one of them.

324
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:11,573
It's always hard losing one of your own.

325
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:17,948
I dorft know.

326
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:23,488
Dad-He said-

327
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:29,730
Basically told me not to be dumb.

328
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:32,495
But, uh, I think he’d be proud of me.

329
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:35,469
You know, this is my way of honoring him.

330
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,332
<i>N</i>

331
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:12,107
<i>U</i>

332
00:23:14,031 --> 00:23:15,271
Ooh.

333
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:45,669
You’ve lost a lot of people like Tom.

334
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:47,470
- Ls that hard?
- Yeah.

335
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:49,943
İt's part of what we clo.

336
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,503
The most unpleasant part.

337
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,481
But it comes with the job.

338
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:58,645
Every man and Woman that
signed up for R-Division knows the risks.

339
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:00,848
And they’re Willing to pay
the ultimate price.

340
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:03,585
Are you prepared to pay that price?

341
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:06,150
Is anyone?

342
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:10,623
All right, let's make the boy's mark.

343
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,836
L-low many of your own
guys have you hacl to-

344
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,100
You know?

345
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:20,267
We dorft talk about that.

346
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:23,005
You sure were shit out of luck, Tim.

347
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:26,105
His name was Tom.

348
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,911
Whatever.

349
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:30,043
Hovv do you think the outbreak got started?

350
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:32,246
İt's Gods will.

351
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,915
But ifs not Judgment Day.

352
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:37,983
Maybe ifs just a cleansing
to weed out the bad...

353
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:40,494
to bring us back to simpler times and ways.

354
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,963
Hovv do you know God
doesrft mean it to be the end?

355
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,296
Because he has a bigger plan for us.

356
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:48,963
I mean, you’re still here, right?

357
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:50,699
Just.

358
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:52,934
When I was a soldier,
|’d— die for my country.

359
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:57,207
But I'm telling ya, if there was ever a
truly-situation...

360
00:24:57,268 --> 00:24:59,179
you can bet the military's involved.

361
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:04,549
I mean, you got any idea hovv much money
they spend on biovveapon research?

362
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:06,110
I figure they screwed up one day...

363
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,452
and invented something
they couldrft un-invent.

364
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:10,048
Right, Grizzly?

365
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:14,255
He believes me though. Right, Grizzly?

366
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:16,525
About the army.

367
00:25:16,587 --> 00:25:17,759
Yeah.

368
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:20,199
Command and Control.

369
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:23,170
This is the brain of the entire
R-Division operation.

370
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:25,503
R-Div 8, this is Command Central.

371
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:27,872
- <i>Come baa/c</i>
- R-Div 8. Go ahead.

372
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:29,434
I need you to intercept a semi truck...

373
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,776
less than a quarter of a mile
away from your current location.

374
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:36,341
The vehicle is moving at a high rate of
speed and possibly carrying Re-Ans.

375
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:39,251
<i>- Proceed with caution. He's gonna run.
- Over.</i>

376
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,051
All right, crew, look alive.

377
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:44,217
İt's gonna get ugly.

378
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,726
<i>This is R-Division! Pull over now!</i>

379
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:50,122
Move it! Move, move, move!

380
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,989
Out of the cab! Now!

381
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,051
- Get out!
- Okay, okay, take it easy!

382
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:57,856
Get out of the truck. On the ground!

383
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:04,973
What the hell is
your problem, man? Come on!

384
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,703
- What do you have in the back?
- I got DVD players in the back, man.

385
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:09,005
- Really?
- Yeah.

386
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:12,604
Show me. Come on. Back, cover!

387
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:14,910
Why would they be running if
they weren't hiding something?

388
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:16,781
- Move!
- I need a lawyer!

389
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,686
- I need-
- Case dismissed. Cuff him.

390
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:24,055
- Take it easy!
- I got this thing on TV.

391
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:25,684
- Open up.
- All right.

392
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:32,157
This doesrft feel right.

393
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:36,571
I dorft like it.

394
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:38,629
Get up there. Go.

395
00:27:38,695 --> 00:27:40,800
Th-There's just DVD players in here.

396
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:42,366
There’s nothing else in there.

397
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:44,674
Look-
There’s nothing else in there!

398
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:45,594
Hernandez!

399
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,739
There’s nothing else in there!

400
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:50,217
- There’s just-
They’re just DVD players in there!
- Move!

401
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:54,222
- There’s nothing else in there!
- Parker, Winston, check it out.

402
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:26,278
They're tough to put clown, yeah.

403
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:29,950
|t’s got to be a head shot,
but sometimes even that dorft get it done.

404
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:32,323
You gotta destroy the brain stem.

405
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:35,386
And I seen them take five or six bullets in
the head before they go dovvn.

406
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:39,730
And I svvear to God, it’s like
shooting them just pisses them off...

407
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,428
and they come at you even harder.

408
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:39,417
Clear it, Grizzly! Yeah! Get them!

409
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:49,727
I mean...

410
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:52,296
they died once already.

411
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:54,501
It airft easy making them do it over.

412
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:54,664
Adams, close the gate!

413
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,167
Adams, close the gate!

414
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:13,287
Close it!

415
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:28,703
RPG!

416
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:43,024
Welcome back.

417
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,459
Right now the guys are going around...

418
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:48,962
To re-kill all of the Re-Ans.

419
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:50,521
|t’s never been seen before on TV.

420
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:53,227
- You ready for this?
- Yes, sir.

421
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,363
L-low will we know
when we finally achieve victory?

422
00:30:57,427 --> 00:30:59,065
Officially...

423
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:01,234
the outbreak is over.

424
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:02,834
But look around us.

425
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:05,379
<i>Look what we do every day.</i>

426
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:07,847
It only takes one.

427
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:12,478
One uncontained bite
can trigger another massive outbreak.

428
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:15,523
İt's only a matter of time.

429
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:18,560
You know why'?

430
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:20,788
Because we're stuck with being human.

431
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:28,301
These... things are getting smarter.

432
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:30,634

439
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:50,889
Wandering around starving to death.

440
00:31:50,947 --> 00:31:52,949
So then why fight?

441
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,891
Because we're human.

who saved his student body
from sure death...

446
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:04,559
after suddenly being attacked
by multiple Re-Ans.

447
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:05,861
What a story.

448
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:08,528
It-It all happened so fast.

449
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:10,970
From-From What l, uh, can remember...

450
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:13,132
um, l-l was telling the children
to get behind me...

451
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:17,008
and, uh, luckily, a-a bat had dropped...

452
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:20,480
from-from two of the children
who had been playing a little ball.

453
00:33:20,537 --> 00:33:23,245

I kind of Went ballistic.

455
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,286
And at some point, I remembered...

456
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:31,087
“My God, the kids.
L-l dorft Want them to see this.”

457
00:33:31,148 --> 00:33:33,560
Well, l-l just-I just told them to-to run.

458
00:33:33,617 --> 00:33:35,927
L-l got in front ofthem and I guess, uh...

459
00:33:35,986 --> 00:33:39,160
there is something to, uh,
having a schoolteacher voice sometimes.

460
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:42,829
They-They all listened and-
and-and did What I told them.

Good day, good day, good day.

468
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:08,627
After the initial outbreak,
they sent us out in hazmat suits.

469
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:10,687
They used to slow us clown.

470
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:13,701
The suits didrft protect you,
so they changed the rules.

471
00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:15,430
Now we can survive.

472
00:34:15,492 --> 00:34:19,201

you saw there's no separate facilities.

497
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:32,570
Um, I heard I was
one of 121 females nationwide...

498
00:35:32,636 --> 00:35:37,142
but that was a While back, so by now some-

499
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:46,455
Come here. He’s got
a scratch on his left arm.

500
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:48,553
İt's nothing. I got it this morning.

501
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:51,224

502
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:52,392
Sarge!

Never had an infected in the building ever.

509
00:36:26,056 --> 00:36:28,662
I'm sure Officer Nguyerfs fine,
but safety first.

510
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:31,262
We gotta do the checks.

511
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:35,105
Truth is, we clon't know
how infectious it is.

512
00:36:35,165 --> 00:36:37,736
We know a bite can do it, but, um...

513
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:40,680
What about scratches?

514
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:43,479
On, uh...

515
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:48,148
there's one thing about this war
that's different from the other oonfliots.

516
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:50,953
There’s no scars on the veterans.

517
00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:53,324
Once you get out...

518
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:54,691
you’re dead.

519
00:36:57,854 --> 00:37:00,357
- Are they sending us back out?
- I don’t know.

520
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:09,138
Ain’t you gonna say nothing about this?

521
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:14,579
Oh, yeah, great. That's what I thought.

522
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:19,348
As a result of the truck drivers
you caught today...

523
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:22,652
are we gonna go back out'?

524
00:37:22,712 --> 00:37:25,283
Sarge? Sarge.

525
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:26,850
<i>What else you want me to say, man?</i>

526
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,756
<i>They told me they were
DVD players in the back.</i>

527
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,371
<i>You think I ‘m stupid, huh?</i>

528
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:31,163
<i>That's all I Know.</i>

529
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:33,360
<i>You know what / think is really stupid?</i>

530
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:35,403
<i>Spending the rest of your life in prison.</i>

531
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:36,960
<i>Your partner just told us...</i>

532
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:38,547
<i>your destination was inside this zone.</i>

533
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:40,666
<i>I need-I need-
I want immunity. Then I'll talk.</i>

534
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,232
<i>Screw your immunity!</i>

535
00:37:42,298 --> 00:37:44,335
<i>Tell me why you were going there.</i>

536
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:45,903
<i>You're looking at mandatory life in prison.</i>

537
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,710
<i>- I don't know anything!
- Come on.</i>

538
00:37:47,771 --> 00:37:49,273
<i>You're carrying a truckload of re-animates.</i>

539
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:50,841
<i>That's it. I'm throwing you back.</i>

540
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:53,615
<i>- Everything you've given me is useless!
- Okay, all right.</i>

541
00:37:53,677 --> 00:37:55,884
<i>Ah, it's-it's something
called the Judas Project.</i>

542
00:37:55,945 --> 00:37:58,323
<i>The Judas Project? Tell me more about that.</i>

543
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:02,830
Sergeant, these Re-Ans are
different, smarter, very dangerous!

544
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:06,095
After discovering the truck
driveﬁs final location...

545
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:08,158
Captain McAdams and the Sarge argue...

546
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:12,036
over whether they should deploy
R-Division 8 deep into The Zone.

547
00:38:12,095 --> 00:38:15,770
That's it! Deploy now, Sergeant!

548
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:17,470
Hey, get away from me, camera boy!

549
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:19,810
My name's not camera boy. it's Jimmy.

550
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:23,606
Jimmy was the name of his son.

551
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:25,846
He died during the outbreak.

552
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,582
What happened?

553
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:30,318
You’re gonna keep pointing that
thing at me till I tell you, aren’t you?

554
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,827
Uh, no way. I'm not going there.

555
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:36,090
That's the Sarge's business.

556
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:38,393
If you neecl to know, you'll know.

557
00:38:38,455 --> 00:38:44,269
Everyone on R-Div thinks the Sarge was a
cop or a soldier before the outbreak.

558
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:47,365
They’re wrong. He was a
supermarket manager.

559
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,900
Just doing What vve were told
to do when it started.

560
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:55,279
Staying holed up in his house
with his Wife Ronnie and his kid.

561
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:57,818
He was only three years old.

562
00:38:57,874 --> 00:39:02,380
They ran out of food, so he Went to the
store to get more and, um...

563
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:05,915
when he got back,
his Wife was so badly eaten...

564
00:39:05,982 --> 00:39:07,791
she was gone.

565
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:10,798
She was the lucky one.

566
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:12,856
Jimmy vvasrft.

567
00:39:15,024 --> 00:39:17,766
He had to re-kill his ovvn little boy.

568
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,844
Hi. We all remember the outbreak.

569
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:29,214
The people we lost.

570
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:34,018
Of course we'll never forget.

571
00:39:34,077 --> 00:39:37,923
But now we have to cope with the aftermath.

572
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:40,860
At Gibsons Post Trauma Clinic,
vve understand.

573
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,897
We know just talking isn't enough.

574
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:46,195
Thafs why vve prescribe
the Widest range of drugs.

575
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:49,328
No one prescribes harder, faster or more...

576
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:50,894
even over the phone.

577
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,439
Gibsorfs Post Trauma Clinic.

578
00:39:52,495 --> 00:39:55,101
Pain medication for emotional pain...

579
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:57,441
the kind that really hurts.

580
00:39:59,636 --> 00:40:01,240
<i>Head shot.</i>

581
00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:04,213
<i>Re-K ill.</i>

582
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,479
<i>Good aim.</i>

583
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:11,586
<i>Well done.</i>

584
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:14,891
|’ve tried other guns,
but I just never felt safe.

585
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:17,090
<i>The Desert Eagle .50 caliber.</i>

586
00:40:17,153 --> 00:40:20,225
<i>The human skull is made of
16 joining plates of bone...</i>

587
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,792
<i>some over an inch thick.</i>

588
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:24,134
<i>- » Point, shoot.
- - Game over.</i>

589
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:26,174
For the children.

590
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,702
<i>Please have ID check ready.</i>

591
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:35,272
<i>Stay inside your vehicle
unless instructed otherwise.</i>

592
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,650
<i>R-D 8, proceed to zone
coordinates 1-5-niner-7—</i>

593
00:40:45,715 --> 00:40:47,661
All right, listen up.

594
00:40:47,717 --> 00:40:50,926
We got an address from the driver we picked
up from that truck.

595
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:53,866
Something about some Judas Project.

596
00:40:53,923 --> 00:40:55,834
|t’s deep in The Zone.

597
00:40:55,892 --> 00:40:58,270
You gotta be kidding me.

598
00:40:58,328 --> 00:41:00,274
This is fantastic.

599
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:03,072
A camera crevv’s never been
in The Zone before.

600
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,939
I'm Jimmy Mitchell.

601
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:09,711
And tonight vve have
an exclusive on Re-K/YL.

602
00:41:09,772 --> 00:41:13,948
That will be unlike anything
you’ve ever seen before on television.

603
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,820
My camera crew and I are going to travel...

604
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,952
with the brave men and Women
of R-Division 8...

605
00:41:20,016 --> 00:41:24,761
to an unknown point deep inside The Zone.

606
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:28,268
As you may know,
The Zone is the sealed-off area...

607
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:31,999
that encompasses most
of Manhattan Island...

608
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:35,634
in the once proud city
formerly known as New York.

609
00:41:35,698 --> 00:41:40,408
In the dark and violent months following
the patient zero Re-An outbreak...

610
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,145
New York was heroically
sealed off by engineers...

611
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:46,915
in an unrivaled construction project.

612
00:41:46,976 --> 00:41:49,547
But no one, besides the military...

613
00:41:49,612 --> 00:41:53,287
has been allowed in this area
in nearly five years.

614
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:56,922
During that time, rumors have spread Wildly
across the Internet...

615
00:41:56,986 --> 00:42:00,160
and several best-selling authors
have written books...

616
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:05,673
speculating on What exactly
is going on behind these giant walls.

617
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:08,902
The conspiracy theories
range from the mundane...

618
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:11,912
to the outlandish.

619
00:42:11,968 --> 00:42:15,472
Now as you may know,
Re-Kfl/ is filmed live on a two-hour delay.

620
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:17,779
This is especially necessary tonight...

621
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,846
because communication will be completely
blacked out once vve’re inside these walls.

622
00:42:22,912 --> 00:42:25,984
So every two hours our Re-Ki/l drones...

623
00:42:26,049 --> 00:42:30,191
are going to rendezvous with us
and ferry our camera footage...

624
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:32,699
back to our mobile broadcast studio...

625
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:35,235
and then directly into your home.

626
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,999
So sit back and be the first
to discover...

627
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:41,008
What truly lies inside The Zone.

628
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,911
Captain McAdams, can you tell us
a little more about The Zone?

629
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:54,114
The, uh, Zone is, uh, part ofthe city...

630
00:42:54,177 --> 00:42:57,215
that vve never managed
to clear after the outbreak.

631
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,782
So, for five years...

632
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:01,556
we just built a wall around it...

633
00:43:01,617 --> 00:43:04,928
and, uh, let vvhafs inside rot away.

634
00:43:06,356 --> 00:43:07,596
Hopefully.

635
00:43:09,392 --> 00:43:10,996
So tell me, Winston...

636
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,971
vvhafs your thoughts on The Zone?

637
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:15,669
|t’s a no-marfs-land.

638
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:17,905
İt's a place we, uh...

639
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:21,471
had to contain after the initial outbreak.

640
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:24,017
We had to wall it up, seal it shut.

641
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:27,020
Now it's the Re-An ghetto.

642
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:31,786
A few Weeks ago,
another R-D unit Went in there.

643
00:43:31,848 --> 00:43:33,418
No one came back.

644
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:39,891
Hey, Parker,
have you been in The Zone before?

645
00:43:39,956 --> 00:43:42,664
Do I look that-
dumb to you?

646
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:45,365
- Huh? Get the fuck out of here.
- No. Ovv! God.

647
00:43:45,428 --> 00:43:47,533
Do I know why we're here'?

648
00:43:48,498 --> 00:43:50,102
Dude-

649
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,112
I'm just as blind as you are.

650
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:54,671
- Except I got an M-16.
- You got a-camera.

651
00:43:54,737 --> 00:43:56,808
Nobody wants to be here, Jimmy.

652
00:43:57,673 --> 00:43:59,175
Nobody.

653
00:44:19,762 --> 00:44:22,436
- What the shit are we doing here, Sarge?
- There's been rumors...

654
00:44:22,498 --> 00:44:24,341
of something called a Judas Project-

655
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,244
a re-animation experimentation-
going on in The Zone.

656
00:44:27,303 --> 00:44:29,681
Guy from the truck confirmed the rumors.

657
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:31,776
What are they doing with them?

658
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:33,912
That's what we're here to fincl out.

659
00:44:33,976 --> 00:44:35,887
You think this Judas Project thing is real?

660
00:44:35,945 --> 00:44:38,516
I read plenty of blogs about it.

661
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:41,221
People say they’re
trying to create some super Re-An.

662
00:44:41,284 --> 00:44:43,195
Why would anybody wanna do that?

663
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,699
Desperate times, desperate measures.

664
00:44:45,755 --> 00:44:49,703
And if ifs that big a deal,
why all six on our ovvn?

665
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:53,605
I do know the Lord is ever
constant and vigilant.

666
00:44:53,663 --> 00:44:56,109
Should have picked Chino.

667
00:44:56,165 --> 00:44:59,112
I started out in a different unit-
R-Div 6.

668
00:44:59,168 --> 00:45:01,808
We were ordered
into The Zone six months ago.

669
00:45:01,871 --> 00:45:04,010
But I had the flu that day.

670
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:09,052
I'm alive because
of the-flu.

671
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:17,963
Keep it tight. Stay alert.

672
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:24,536
- Turn that light out now.
- Oh, yeah. My bad.

673
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:32,935
Anyone have anything?

674
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:43,847
Fan out. Two to the right.
The rest of us straight ahead.

675
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:49,888
What is this place?

676
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:28,725
" [ Vomitin Am g1

677
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:31,328
Hey, are you all right?

678
00:46:31,394 --> 00:46:33,465
Jesus.

679
00:46:34,363 --> 00:46:35,865
God.

680
00:46:35,932 --> 00:46:38,879
L-low long have these people been here'?

681
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:46,484
- Guess ifs real.
- The Judas Project?

682
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:48,044
We’re too late.

683
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:54,551
Hey, you see this?

684
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:58,825
Whafd I tell you, boy? Had to be the army.

685
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:01,892
God, they must have hated <i>him.</i>

686
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:06,031
They dorft hate. They eat.

687
00:47:06,095 --> 00:47:07,904
- You sure about that, Sarge?
- Lets move.

688
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:12,839
We don’t know nothing
about What they think...

689
00:47:12,902 --> 00:47:16,111
or what it's like... to be one of them.

690
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:35,027
Lefs not break formation.

691
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:50,513
Sarge? Sarge.

692
00:47:50,573 --> 00:47:53,179
- What is it'?
- Um, I just-I saw something.

693
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:55,313
- Where'?

694
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:00,587
- Keep it together.
- Ah, yeah.

695
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:25,279

<i>We wanna know where you were
when the outbreak ﬁrst began.</i>

700
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:55,815
Where was I the day of the outbreak?

701
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:59,011
To tell you that, I have to tell you about
Amos. Uh, that's my stepclacl.

702
00:48:59,075 --> 00:49:01,351
Proud owner of Amos Trees, LLC.

703
00:49:04,013 --> 00:49:05,583
He’s a piece of vvork.

704
00:49:05,648 --> 00:49:07,594
He was just always riding me, you know?

705
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,357
“Ellis, what the hell's wrong with you?”

706
00:49:09,418 --> 00:49:11,796
“Ellis, why are you so lazy?”
“Ellis, vvhafs your problem?”

707
00:49:11,854 --> 00:49:13,925
“Ellis, you on— drugs?
Your body is a temple...

708
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:16,162
and you’re ruining your-temple,
god-.”

709
00:49:16,225 --> 00:49:18,364
One of those religious types.

710
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:19,929
So anyway, day of the outbreak...

711
00:49:19,995 --> 00:49:24,205
I'm-I'm out here doing my thing,
minding my own business.

712
00:49:24,266 --> 00:49:25,768
And here comes Amos stumbling up to me.

713
00:49:25,835 --> 00:49:27,781
I just thought he was drunk again.

714
00:49:27,837 --> 00:49:29,874
The old man had
a little thing for the sauce.

715
00:49:29,939 --> 00:49:31,850
“Your body’s a temple.”

716
00:49:31,907 --> 00:49:35,047
Anyway, so |’m out here.
He stumbles up and he tries to grab me.

717
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:38,820
And l gotta tell you vve-vve dorft really
have that kind of, uh, relationship.

718
00:49:38,881 --> 00:49:41,293
I'm like, “Whoa,” you know.
“What the hell's your problem?”

719
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,387
Then he tries to bite me.

720
00:49:44,553 --> 00:49:46,191
I was like,
“Oh, hell no,” you know?

721
00:49:46,255 --> 00:49:48,599
So I took a shovel to him hard, real hard.

722
00:49:48,657 --> 00:49:51,968
And, uh, it didrft seem to faze him.
It just kind of pissed him off.

723
00:49:52,027 --> 00:49:53,747
Anyways, that goes on for a little while...

724
00:49:53,796 --> 00:49:55,867
and luckily, I had old Johnny with me.

725
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:57,535
And I Went at him with it.

726
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,605
I cannot tell you What Went through my mind
when I Went at him with this.

727
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,277
But, uh, I can tell you
What happened immediately afterwards.

728
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:08,845
I just thought... I'm going to prison.

729
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:13,223
But for once, uh, you knovv,
luck was on my side.

730
00:50:13,282 --> 00:50:15,421
Everywhere was going batshit crazy.

731
00:50:15,484 --> 00:50:18,522
So it kinda worked out
for me, uh, you know?

732
00:50:18,587 --> 00:50:22,399
I got the family business,
uh, changed the name.

733
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:25,029
That's, uh-That's how
I survived the outbreak.

734
00:50:26,462 --> 00:50:28,032

00:54:41,884 --> 00:54:43,591

00:55:39,408 --> 00:55:42,912
They’re coming back. Lefs move.

812
00:55:54,857 --> 00:55:56,530
Sorry, Parker.

813
00:55:58,093 --> 00:56:00,403
Hey, Grizzly.

814
00:56:00,462 --> 00:56:03,534
I know you’ve had to kill
a lot of your ovvn men on the field.

815
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,603
Do you think if it was Parker,
you could pull the trigger?

816
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,993
- Are you afraid to die?
- No.

817
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,031
If you had to go,
hovv would you Want it to happen?

818
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,964
In a... damn
blaze of glory.

819
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:29,298
What if you got bit?

820
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:31,133
L-low would you react?

821
00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:40,246
<i>Re-N“ will return in a moment.</i>

822
00:56:54,082 --> 00:56:56,961
VVhoo!

823
00:56:57,019 --> 00:56:58,054
Yeah!

824
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,066
Where was I on the day of the outbreak?

825
00:57:00,122 --> 00:57:01,624
Is that What you really wanna know?

826
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,795
Can you please just answer the question?

827
00:57:03,859 --> 00:57:08,433
On the day of the outbreak, I was on
a date with a friend, my boyfriend.

828
00:57:08,497 --> 00:57:12,639
And dinner must have gone vvell
because he got us a room at a hotel-

829
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:14,203
a really nice hotel.

830
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:16,545
So vve Walk into the room,
and John, my boyfriend...

831
00:57:16,605 --> 00:57:18,107
starts acting really aggressive.

832
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:20,779
And this somehow led to
a fight about money.

833
00:57:20,843 --> 00:57:22,982
Couples fight all the time
about money, right?

834
00:57:23,045 --> 00:57:26,026
So anyway,
he just looked around like he was lost.

835
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:27,754
It was really Weird.

836
00:57:27,816 --> 00:57:29,693
I was having a hard time
taking him serious...

837
00:57:29,751 --> 00:57:31,526
because he’s not wearing pants.

838
00:57:31,587 --> 00:57:34,659
So I start laughing. Thafs when he decided
to put his hands on me...

839
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:36,498
which is a huge no-no.

840
00:57:36,558 --> 00:57:38,162
I know exactly Where to kick.

841
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:40,229
- I mentioned he wasn't wearing pants'?
- Yes.

842
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:43,174
Hmm. Anyways, sol kick him,
and there’s zero response.

843
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:45,678
- So then I show him this.
- She’s got a gun.

844
00:57:45,734 --> 00:57:47,338
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

845
00:57:47,402 --> 00:57:49,143
Do you Want me to finish my story or not?

846
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:51,206
Cherry interview, take two.

847
00:57:51,273 --> 00:57:54,117
- Anyway, so then I tell Jim-
- John.

848
00:57:54,176 --> 00:57:58,647
Yes. Then I tell John to back the “F” off
me. You know What I mean?

849
00:57:58,714 --> 00:58:01,354
So he lunges at me,
so I shot him in the ass.

850
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:04,556
I mean, that should have been enough
to stop him, but he just goes psycho.

851
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,361
So I take off running clown the hallway.

852
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:09,891
|’m screaming my head off,
and this little old Woman comes out...

853
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:11,665
and John attacks her instead of me.

854
00:58:11,727 --> 00:58:13,502
No. So I Went up to him.

855
00:58:13,562 --> 00:58:15,838
I put the gun to the back
of his head and boom!

856
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:18,242
And that fixed it.

857
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,646
But then the old lady started
kind of looking weird and-

858
00:58:22,704 --> 00:58:24,183
No. Good-bye. I gotta go.

859
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,082
So I reached clown. I grab his keys.

860
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:28,121
He has a really nice car, by the Way.

861
00:58:28,176 --> 00:58:29,814
And I got the hell out ofthere.

862
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:32,038
That's what happened to me
on the clay of the outbreak.

863
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:35,723
Fifty dollars, right? Yeah?

864
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:11,631

00:59:16,491 --> 00:59:19,404
where WeK/e just lost two of our own-

868
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:22,999
Trent Parker and Corporal Adams.

869
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:27,545
It seems to be quiet.

870
00:59:27,602 --> 00:59:29,343
Quiet is good.

871
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:43,823
Ankle biters.

872
00:59:46,655 --> 00:59:48,532
All right, spread out.

873
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:52,732
Um, “Ankle biters” is a slang term...

874
00:59:52,794 --> 00:59:58,506
used by the R-Div team,
referring to Re-An children.

875
01:00:01,903 --> 01:00:04,144
Oh, this is not good.

876
01:00:04,206 --> 01:00:06,982
This is fucked up.

877
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:21,265
You got something?

878
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,962
Over here.

879
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:46,519
Oh, God.
You guys, maybe vve should get out of here.

880
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:10,346
[ Sarge 1 Regroup!

881
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:15,513
Shit!

882
01:01:16,878 --> 01:01:18,551
Easy, ‘cause ifs out.

883
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:22,527
This is What God has planned for me.

884
01:01:24,786 --> 01:01:26,891
- Can you believe it'?
- There's more of them.

885
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:33,039
- Sarge?
- Get out of here.

886
01:01:34,262 --> 01:01:36,071
Okay, let's move.

887
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:38,304
I/aya con Dias.

888
01:01:38,366 --> 01:01:43,281
Remember, they’re gonna
need you in the ark.

889
01:01:43,338 --> 01:01:45,944
They’re gonna need you!

890
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:56,889
The ark is Gods home for those he has
chosen to survive, to start over.

891
01:01:56,952 --> 01:02:00,024
Do I think Winstorfs right about his ark?

892
01:02:01,556 --> 01:02:03,467
HQ_

893
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:06,403
Do you believe in God?

894
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:07,997
I used to.

895
01:02:09,698 --> 01:02:12,645
Just like the Sarge says,
Outbreak Two will happen.

896
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:14,772
It's just not gonna kill all of us.

897
01:02:17,806 --> 01:02:20,377
- Let’s get the hell out of here.
- Yeah.

898
01:02:20,442 --> 01:02:22,479
Jimmy, take this.

899
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:25,018
- What?
- Take it!

900
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,924
- L-I've never firecl a gun before.
- Keep up.

901
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:31,320
Shit.

902
01:02:35,123 --> 01:02:37,660
Hey, drop the damn cameras!

903
01:02:37,726 --> 01:02:40,707
Dorft do it, Bobby. Lefs just keep going.

904
01:02:52,874 --> 01:02:54,876
Slow them clown a bit.

905
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:57,547
Take cover!

906
01:03:02,017 --> 01:03:04,691
Squad, fall back! Fall back.

907
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:07,123

912
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:20,877

Get back!

919
01:04:04,312 --> 01:04:06,553
Jesus Christ!

920
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:12,594
We gotta find cover. Find cover.

921
01:04:15,857 --> 01:04:18,861
They’re everywhere!

922
01:04:18,927 --> 01:04:22,636
Just get back. Get back! Move!

923
01:04:22,697 --> 01:04:25,234

Come on! Lefs go!

926
01:04:33,575 --> 01:04:35,782
Hernandez, go! Come on!

01:04:35,844 --> 01:04:38,381
L_et's go!

928
01:04:38,446 --> 01:04:39,948
Right behind you.

929
01:05:03,004 --> 01:05:05,211
Go, go, go!

930
01:05:05,273 --> 01:05:07,344
Come on! Go!

931
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,721
They’re still coming.

932
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:30,432
Die!

933
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:32,136
This way!

934
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:39,246
- Reload! Cover me.
- Got your six!

935
01:05:39,307 --> 01:05:40,877
RPG!

936
01:05:43,044 --> 01:05:45,615
Move, move, move,
move, move! Lefs go!

937
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:51,053
Watch it! Got it!

938
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:54,456
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!

939
01:05:54,522 --> 01:05:57,025
Sarge, the dooﬁs locked!

940
01:05:57,092 --> 01:05:58,662
Move it, Matthews!

941
01:06:00,295 --> 01:06:01,865
My God, vve’re trapped.

942
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:14,409
Sarge, what-what are you doing?

943
01:06:14,476 --> 01:06:16,513
Why are you taking your gear off?

944
01:06:16,578 --> 01:06:19,252
- In case they get us.
- So we're not bulletproof.

945
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:24,496
- What about Jimmy'?
- <i>I'll</i> take oare of the camera guys.

946
01:06:32,394 --> 01:06:34,032
It's Hernandez.

947
01:06:37,432 --> 01:06:38,877
Sorry, man.

948
01:06:41,302 --> 01:06:43,612
Wait! NO!

949
01:06:56,217 --> 01:06:57,924
- Where we going?
- Gotta keep moving.

950
01:06:59,587 --> 01:07:02,329
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

951
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:05,860
That was Judas Project. Dumb assholes.

952
01:07:05,927 --> 01:07:08,373
Thought they had answers.
Thought they vvere gonna save the World.

953
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:10,432
- What are you talking about?
- What were they doing in there?

954
01:07:10,498 --> 01:07:11,909
You know What? I dorft even know.

955
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:13,775
I was just another grunt to them, you know?

956
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:15,610
Save-the-vvorld types.

957
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,241
Scientists. Fuckheads, all ofthem.

958
01:07:18,306 --> 01:07:21,651
Come on! Come!
Lefs fucking move! Move! Now!

959
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:25,418
In fucking here! Lefs go!
Go, go, go! Come on!

960
01:07:26,147 --> 01:07:28,627
Go on. Go, go.

961
01:07:28,683 --> 01:07:30,424
Go!

962
01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:32,487
Go, go, go, go. Come on, come on.

963
01:07:36,024 --> 01:07:39,904
That-That's all that's
left of the Judas Project.

964
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:44,569
Maybe someday somebody will find it,
Work it out.

965
01:07:44,632 --> 01:07:48,842
All they told me one time was, uh, to be-

966
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:53,314
To try to find a Way
to make ‘em turn on each other.

967
01:07:53,374 --> 01:07:57,049
Here.
To fight each other instead of us.

968
01:07:57,111 --> 01:07:59,455
Eat each other like they eat us?

969
01:07:59,514 --> 01:08:01,516
One clay we got a new batch.

970
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:03,426
And one of them-He was different.

971
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:05,931
<i>Subject is still unresponsive.</i>

972
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:09,629
<i>I'm cutting the skin tissue.</i>

973
01:08:13,428 --> 01:08:15,066
They all changed.

974
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:18,542
Uh, the Way they acted,
the Way they watched us.

975
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,102
They changed.

976
01:08:20,168 --> 01:08:22,910
They started acting like,
uh-in a group. Like they had ideas.

977
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:24,917
I clon't know how to say it.

978
01:08:24,973 --> 01:08:28,216
I'm not an eggheacl or a scientist.
Just doing my job.

979
01:08:28,276 --> 01:08:29,812
What was your job?

980
01:08:29,878 --> 01:08:32,119
- I worked in the holding pens.
- Holding pens?

981
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,682
Oh, yeah.

982
01:08:36,217 --> 01:08:37,787
We had hundreds.

983
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:40,332
Locked them all up together.

984
01:08:40,388 --> 01:08:43,198
- That was our big mistake.
- What happened?

985
01:08:43,258 --> 01:08:45,067
<i>Levels are spiking.</i>

986
01:08:47,028 --> 01:08:49,099
When did this happen?

987
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:53,475
I uh-I kinda lost track of time,
but, uh, two weeks ago now.
J.

988
01:08:53,535 --> 01:08:55,208
Three.

989
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:57,511
Mm. Maybe four Weeks.

990
01:08:57,572 --> 01:08:59,449
L-low come nobody knows about this'?

991
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:01,646
'Cause they're smart enough to sit tight.

992
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:04,553
The longer they stay here,
the bigger their army gets.

993
01:09:04,612 --> 01:09:07,218
You know, the more Re-Ans
get delivered in the trucks.

994
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:09,319
- Army?
- Oh, yeah.

995
01:09:09,384 --> 01:09:11,125
Army of the dead.

996
01:09:11,185 --> 01:09:14,928
We’re no longer top ofthe food chain.
We’re food.

997
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:20,264
Why are you still filming this?

998
01:09:20,328 --> 01:09:22,604
We’re gonna die here.
No one’s ever gonna see this.

999
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:24,200
No, that's-that's not true...

1000
01:09:24,265 --> 01:09:25,801
because every time we go outside...

1001
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:28,973
the network sends drones
so we can upload the files.

1002
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:30,948
- If we can just get out there-
- l-low far behind are they'?

1003
01:09:31,005 --> 01:09:34,111
- Uh, about two hours.
- Then we still got a chance.

1004
01:09:34,175 --> 01:09:36,086
We gotta let people know. Come on!

1005
01:09:38,813 --> 01:09:41,191
- Hovv far do these tunnels go?
- Uh, forever.

1006
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:43,991
I think they link up
with the subway somewhere.

1007
01:09:47,522 --> 01:09:49,229
Every-fucking-vvhere.

1008
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:53,867
Not a good fucking place.

1009
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:56,340
- What do you mean?
- They come out of here.

1010
01:09:56,397 --> 01:09:58,775
Fucking anywhere. They are like wolves.

1011
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,939
They hunt in a pack. Hunting.

1012
01:10:02,003 --> 01:10:03,607
Then let's make this quick.

1013
01:10:03,671 --> 01:10:05,412
This is a bad place, man.

1014
01:10:05,473 --> 01:10:08,181
They'll come out of fucking anywhere, man.

1015
01:10:08,242 --> 01:10:10,916
- Tunnel dwellers.
- Tunnel dwellers?

1016
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:14,392
They’re hunting us here, and this is their
fucking hunting ground right here.

1017
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:16,986
See this? See this?

1018
01:10:17,051 --> 01:10:19,725
Those fuckers will come out of there, man,
like water.

1019
01:10:19,787 --> 01:10:22,495
They just ooze out of that fucker, man.

1020
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:26,300
- Hovv did you survive?
- I guess I was born lucky.

1021
01:10:35,403 --> 01:10:38,646
Oh, God. Oh!

1022
01:10:38,706 --> 01:10:42,153
Oh, God.

1023
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,190
Whafd I fucking tell you?

1024
01:10:44,245 --> 01:10:47,055
- A lucky-|’m a lucky fucker.
- Yeah.

1025
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:48,617
There’s one.

1026
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:53,831
There’s one.

1027
01:10:53,888 --> 01:10:57,131
Okay, vve’ve made it through the tunnels.

1028
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:59,296
Now we're on our way
to try ancl film some footage...

1029
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,533
of the so-called Re-Animate army.

1030
01:11:01,596 --> 01:11:04,372
This is wrong. This is fucking wrong.

1031
01:11:06,034 --> 01:11:07,638
In there.

1032
01:11:07,702 --> 01:11:09,739
They’re-They’re in there.

1033
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:14,184
You see 'em, huh'? Can you see 'em'?

1034
01:11:14,242 --> 01:11:16,051
Can you see 'em'?

1035
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,987
What are they doing?

1036
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:24,953
That's the one. Fucking move.

1037
01:11:25,019 --> 01:11:26,293
- What?
- Move.

1038
01:11:26,354 --> 01:11:27,799
- What is it'?
- That's Elvis.

1039
01:11:27,855 --> 01:11:28,438
Elvis'?

1040
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:30,233
That's what we call him.
You know, like the King'?

1041
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:33,761
Soon as he showed up,
they all changed. They all fucking changed.

1042
01:11:33,828 --> 01:11:37,071
Like they found themselves a leader.
An alpha male.

1043
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:40,169
- Where did it come from?
- I dorft fucking know.

1044
01:11:40,234 --> 01:11:42,544
We need to get closer,
find out vvhafs going on.

1045
01:11:42,603 --> 01:11:44,708
No, no, no, we oarTt. We oarTt.

1046
01:11:44,772 --> 01:11:48,481
- Hey. We need to find a Way.
- Fucking crazy.

1047
01:11:48,543 --> 01:11:50,045
We’re following Sarge in...

1048
01:11:50,111 --> 01:11:52,614
to try and get a better shot
ofthe Re-An army...

1049
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,524
to show the world vvhafs happening in here.

1050
01:11:57,919 --> 01:12:00,126
This is crazy. We’re too close.

1051
01:12:00,188 --> 01:12:01,690
You said vve gotta show people.

1052
01:12:01,756 --> 01:12:03,258
- Yeah, but-
- Listen.

1053
01:12:03,324 --> 01:12:07,136
We shoot it all with one camera,
fight our way back to our APO.

1054
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:08,765
You guys can broadcast from there, right?

1055
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,332
Yeah, yeah. We can upload it.

1056
01:12:10,398 --> 01:12:12,344
Your APCJs too far. We'll never get there.

1057
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,313
Then vve’|| go back to your hole and Wait
for the network teams.

1058
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:20,250
There’s a catwalk up here.

1059
01:12:20,308 --> 01:12:22,481
You'll be able to see
everything from there.

1060
01:12:22,543 --> 01:12:24,045
All right, let's go.

1061
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:54,650
- I'm gonna go get the shot.
- Bobby's getting the shot.

1062
01:12:58,513 --> 01:12:59,548
Shit.

1063
01:13:02,984 --> 01:13:04,986
There's thousands of 'em.

1064
01:13:06,954 --> 01:13:10,128
Bobby! No! Shit! Bobby!

1065
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:12,535
On, no!

1066
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:18,307
Bobby!

1067
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:20,277
We gotta move. Go, go! Come on! Lefs move!

1068
01:13:20,334 --> 01:13:22,007
Shit!

1069
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:24,345
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1070
01:13:26,007 --> 01:13:28,283
Come on, come on!

1071
01:13:28,342 --> 01:13:29,844
Move it!

1072
01:13:33,381 --> 01:13:35,190
Come on! God!

1073
01:13:37,051 --> 01:13:39,327
Go, go, g0, 90, 9O, 9O, 9O!

1074
01:13:43,224 --> 01:13:44,726
Come on!

1075
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:47,466
Head for the building right there!

1076
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:51,241
They’re catching up!

1077
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:55,509
Jimmy, Jimmy! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1078
01:14:04,078 --> 01:14:06,615
Sarge! Easy out! Come on!

1079
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:08,422
Sarge, easy out!

1080
01:14:13,821 --> 01:14:15,732
Oh, my God.

1081
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,292
L_et's go!

1082
01:14:38,045 --> 01:14:39,547
In there.

1083
01:14:57,965 --> 01:14:59,467
Jesus.

1084
01:15:01,369 --> 01:15:03,645
There’s thousands of them.

1085
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:06,741
This is it.

1086
01:15:07,642 --> 01:15:09,349
Outbreak Two.

1087
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:13,956
I didrft think it’d come this fast.

1088
01:15:14,015 --> 01:15:16,552
Come on, Sarge. We can make it out of here.

1089
01:15:19,854 --> 01:15:21,356
Sarge.

1090
01:15:21,422 --> 01:15:24,266
I dorft know if anyone will ever see this.

1091
01:15:24,325 --> 01:15:27,397
But if you do...

1092
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:28,963
I'm sorry.

1093
01:15:37,672 --> 01:15:39,583
- Sarge-
- Lefs go.

1094
01:15:41,075 --> 01:15:42,577
Come on.

1095
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:45,613
Lefs go.

1096
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:54,255
Oh, God.

1097
01:15:54,322 --> 01:15:56,324
It's like a lab.

1098
01:15:59,694 --> 01:16:02,072
That door downstairs is never gonna hold.

1099
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:12,281
Why the hell haverft they eaten all this?

1100
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,876
I dorft know.

1101
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:25,363
- Oh! Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

1102
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:27,592
Oh, God!

1103
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:35,597
Sarge!

1104
01:16:36,964 --> 01:16:38,409
Kill it!

1105
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:43,807
Find us another Way out!

1106
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,483
Oh, God! Push!

1107
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:54,348
They’re getting in!

1108
01:17:01,522 --> 01:17:03,024
Go!

1109
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,076
Sarge! Jimmy!

1110
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:28,227
Look out!

1111
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,661
Get off her! No!

1112
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:36,326
Sarge!

1113
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,370
Sarge, vve need help in here!

1114
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:42,063
Hey!

1115
01:17:43,531 --> 01:17:45,033
Get off her!

1116
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:04,694
Get off!

1117
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:46,905
What was Jimmy like?

1118
01:18:46,961 --> 01:18:48,702
He was a great kid.

1119
01:18:50,131 --> 01:18:52,611
What keeps you going?

1120
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:54,805
I mean, why you do this?

1121
01:18:54,869 --> 01:18:59,011
I do this so no other parent...
has to do What I did.

1122
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:04,389
Do you ever think about dying?

1123
01:19:05,846 --> 01:19:07,723
When my day comes...

1124
01:19:09,383 --> 01:19:11,522
I finally get to go home.

1125
01:19:14,889 --> 01:19:16,994
<i>Eve</i>

1126
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:38,920
Some religious scholars
believe that purgatory is a place...

1127
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:42,222
for souls that are equally balanced
between good and evil...

1128
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:44,388
and that your actions, they determine...

1129
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:48,558
whether or not you will go
to heaven... or hell.

1130
01:19:51,192 --> 01:19:53,194
The jury’s out for you all.

1131
01:19:54,128 --> 01:19:55,903
'Cause you are corrupt...

1132
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:58,705
by doing What you do with that lens.

1133
01:19:58,766 --> 01:20:00,973
But then you know that. God bless you.

1134
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:11,150
We interrupt this program to bring you
breaking news from the Manhattan Barricade.

1135
01:20:11,212 --> 01:20:12,714
Sean Griffin is on the scene.

1136
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:15,989
Mary, two weeks ago
we started getting reports...

1137
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,961
of re-animate attacks in the subway.

1138
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:21,431
And two days ago, they started coming up.

1139
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:24,935
Yesterday, the entire downtown area
was placed under quarantine...

1140
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:28,439
and the downtown barricade
here was erected.

1141
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:30,702
But now it appears
a large group of re-animates...

1142
01:20:30,764 --> 01:20:33,267
is headed toward the barricade.

1143
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:35,371
Early estimates of the numbers-

1144
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:38,713
50,000 or more.

1145
01:20:38,772 --> 01:20:41,776
There’s no way of knowing
ifthe downtown barricade can hold.

1146
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:45,688
It seems clear
that Outbreak Two is happening.

1147
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:47,350
Mary, back to you.

1148
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:46,178
<i>Underground, this is Delta 5-16
requesting permission to land two Hawks.</i>

1149
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,550
<i>- Oven
- 5-7-6, permission granted.</i>

1150
01:21:48,609 --> 01:21:50,111
<i>Welcome to the ark.</i>

1151
01:21:51,478 --> 01:21:54,357
- Whafs happening?
- We got another radio call.

1152
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:56,986
More survivors. They’re trapped.
