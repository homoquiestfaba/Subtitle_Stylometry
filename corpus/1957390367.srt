1
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:03,614
(illuminating music)

2
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:18,673
(dreadful music)

3
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:40,756
(cars whooshing)

4
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,310
- [Michael] Good morning, Los Angeles.

5
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,850
Michael Horn on CRN Radio.

6
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,970
Another gorgeous day here in the southland

7
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,520
as long as you don't
mind rolling blackouts

8
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,950
and frequent tremblers.

9
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,570
Now I admit we can't do
much about these tremors.

10
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,210
We do live on one of the most active

11
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,230
fault lines in the world,

12
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,590
but the blackouts, that's another matter.

13
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,470
Why can't these energy
companies get their act together

14
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,470
and generate enough electricity?

15
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,670
That's our topic for today.

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,770
The lines are open.

17
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,310
Call me on CRN.

18
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,524
Hi, you're on the air.

19
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:28,594
- [Raymond] Hi, Mike, this is Raymond.

20
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:29,427
- Hey, Raymond.
- Calling from the city.

21
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:31,290
- How you doing?
- I couldn't agree more.

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,760
- [Raymond] My wife and I had
to eat dinner by candlelight

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,040
for three nights in a row.

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,929
Now come on!

25
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,160
(Michael laughs)

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,750
- [Michael] Hey, here we go again.

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,200
Hang on, everyone, it's
another rollercoaster.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,750
Boy, it's a big one this time.

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,583
Wherever you are, listeners,

30
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,940
I hope you got something to hold on to

31
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,510
because the ground's shaking so hard.

32
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,372
Oh my god, the building's
starting to sway, whoa!

33
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:52,773
(horns honking)
(sirens blaring)

34
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:53,940
Boy, that was something!

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,100
Hey, Paul in the newsroom,

36
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,930
we need to find out from the
seismographic lab at Cal Tech

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,194
just how big that one was.

38
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:02,194
(unfriendly music)

39
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:50,517
(suspenseful music)

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,500
- The real deal, bro.

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,720
- Yeah.

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,970
Well, why don't you keep
your real deal shut?

43
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,983
- Whatever, man.

44
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,030
- Now listen to me.

45
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,020
We believe in what we're
doing here, all right,

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,600
and if you're not in line with us,

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,710
why don't you leave?

48
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,800
- Hey, it's cool, man.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,930
- Is it?

50
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,869
- Yeah, I'm cool.

51
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:17,702
I'm cool.

52
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,272
- We got 14 minutes, come on.

53
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:24,689
(soft suspenseful music)

54
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:34,225
(moves into tense music)

55
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:42,055
Get back.

56
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,020
(zapping)

57
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,763
That's the real deal, bro.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,010
- So this is the enemy's lair.

59
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,393
- Just the front gates.

60
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,914
(guard whistling)

61
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,497
(hidden music)

62
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:10,829
- Abbott.

63
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:14,406
- Yeah?

64
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:15,239
- We got a problem.

65
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,803
- What is it?

66
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,133
- Call Mr. Clemens.

67
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,987
- Oh, that guy scares me.

68
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:26,487
(tense music)

69
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:31,568
(typing)

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,910
(crashing)
(Sara gasps)

71
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,743
- What are you doing?

72
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:35,760
- God!
- Leaving my mark.

73
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,593
- Your mark?

74
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:37,663
- It's symbolism, bro.

75
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,063
The lab represents a...
- Oh my god!

76
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,063
McCullough's geological report.

77
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,940
- It looks like calculus.

78
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,067
- Stress equations.

79
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,650
(crazed music)

80
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:55,461
(malicious music)

81
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,220
- Um, Mr. Clemens, I...

82
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,810
- Where are your men?

83
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,960
- Um, they're up on 12th, sir.

84
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,793
- Get them out.

85
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:08,326
- Leron?

86
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,210
Uh, Mr. Clemens is here.

87
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,320
He wants you out now.

88
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,760
- When we get 12, shut down the elevators.

89
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,680
And when your men get down
here, go home, all of you.

90
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,327
We have multiple LBs on 12.

91
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:20,960
I want you two to go with
Zendon up the stairs.

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
You two are with me.

93
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,813
Front to back, gentlemen.

94
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,010
- Come on, come on, Sara!

95
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,460
- No, I still have three files to go!

96
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,270
- Hey, we're losing time!

97
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,430
(computer whirring)
(typing)

98
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,451
(elevator dings)
(ticking)

99
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,784
- What was that?

100
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,260
- I'm out.

101
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,050
- I have to finish!

102
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,063
Oh no.

103
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:44,730
(frantic music)

104
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,464
(heavy breathing)

105
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,960
- Come on, come on, Sara!
- No, I'm not done!

106
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,470
- This is all we get!

107
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,120
Come on, Sara!

108
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,600
Gotta go now, Sara!

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,480
Come on!

110
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,313
Come on!

111
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,759
(heavy breathing)

112
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,060
(typing)

113
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,551
- Oh god, no!

114
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,801
(rushing techno music)

115
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:30,218
(mysterious music)

116
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:57,919
(thudding)
(man cries out)

117
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,279
(gunshot fires)
(glass shattering)

118
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,407
(gunshot fires)
(Joel cries out)

119
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:04,210
(body thuds)
(Sara gasps)

120
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,043
Oh god!

121
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:10,146
(suspenseful music)

122
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:34,163
(smashing)
(grunting)

123
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,229
(sharp breathing)

124
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,896
(strange music)

125
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:56,754
(sniffling)

126
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,730
(sobbing) Okay, okay.

127
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,647
(determined music)

128
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,433
(sharp breathing)

129
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:15,834
(door creaks)
(gunshots firing)

130
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:19,192
(Sara sobbing)

131
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:21,692
(tense music)

132
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:41,270
(sharp breathing)

133
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:50,481
(gunshots firing)

134
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,951
(Sara sobbing)

135
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:01,681
(gunshots firing)

136
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,037
(Joel screams)

137
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,373
(gunshots firing)

138
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:18,644
(Joel screams)

139
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:21,673
(gunshots firing)

140
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:22,645
(spraying)

141
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,633
(Joel screams)

142
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,466
(emotional music)

143
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:40,422
(Sara sobbing)

144
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,433
- Who are you?

145
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:35,922
(Sara sobbing)

146
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:44,888
You know, I can't help you
if you won't talk to me.

147
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:47,471
(Sara sobbing)

148
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,397
- I, I'm Sara.

149
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,973
Sara Rose.

150
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:54,783
Please, please don't kill me.

151
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,483
- This was an awful, awful mistake, Sara.

152
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:03,650
(Sara sobbing)

153
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,250
No one was supposed to get hurt.

154
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:08,971
(Sara sobbing)

155
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,950
Now we're gonna need your help

156
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,020
to explain to the police

157
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,603
exactly what happened here.

158
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,210
(Sara sobbing)

159
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,723
Are, are you with a, an organization?

160
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,723
- (sobbing) We're with
the World Survival Group.

161
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,190
- What were you looking for?

162
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:37,830
- (sobbing) When the police arrive,

163
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,573
I'll tell them everything.

164
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,010
- World Survival Group.

165
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,990
Well that seems like one thing

166
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,499
that none of you are any good at,

167
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:52,332
survival.

168
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,141
(Sara sobbing)

169
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,219
Get the cleaning team out here.

170
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,802
(Sara sobbing)

171
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:09,550
(gunshot fires)

172
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,467
(vacuum whirring)

173
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,363
- [Man Inside] Yeah?

174
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:21,640
- [Man Outside] Hey, man.

175
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,003
I'm a friend of Twin Peaks.

176
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,940
- [Man Inside] 2C.

177
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:30,641
(paper shuffling)

178
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,510
- [Man Outside] She said
if I, if I mentioned...

179
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,680
- [Man Inside] What's your name, man?

180
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,513
- [Nash] Nash.

181
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:42,900
(gun clicks)

182
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,393
- Try anything,

183
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,244
I'll kill you.

184
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,744
(eerie music)

185
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,530
I wouldn't normally let you in, man,

186
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,973
but that's my Alma mater.

187
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,243
- [Nash] Really?

188
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,223
- What the whore pig say?

189
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:12,772
- If I want the good stuff,

190
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:13,693
I gotta seek the truth.

191
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:21,062
- The truth.

192
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,520
- Who is this cracker
from around the way, slim?

193
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,493
- He good.

194
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,663
- Him good?

195
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,130
- Yeah.

196
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,283
- What make him good?

197
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,220
Round the way cracker
never come here, never.

198
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:43,480
- What?

199
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,883
- What do you want, my boy?

200
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,000
- Rock, man.

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,752
I wanna buy some.

202
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:51,763
- Him wanna buy some rock, slim.

203
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:54,769
(laughs)

204
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,683
You like smoke crack, eh, white boy?

205
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,413
Ah.

206
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,563
Maybe me don't want to sell you no crack.

207
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,160
- Maybe I'll take my two Cs

208
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,790
and go back down the
street to Lester's place.

209
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,139
- Go back down street Lester place, eh?

210
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:16,972
You say.

211
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,600
You know, you either crazy or stupid.

212
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,483
- Probably both.

213
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,573
- Probably.

214
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:32,818
You see, because, uh,

215
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:38,770
me just spoke Lester no more
than, uh, 10 minutes ago.

216
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,127
And he's all out.

217
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,143
Now,

218
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,813
me gonna ask one more time.

219
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,783
Saltine cracker.

220
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,270
What do you want?

221
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,916
(knocking)

222
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:07,613
Slim, get the door.

223
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,998
You, get in the backroom.

224
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,498
(scary music)

225
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,250
More on time than a Timex.

226
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,100
- Damn right, and we keep on ticking.

227
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,850
How's business?

228
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,113
- Business is business.

229
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:39,330
You know.

230
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,243
Steady, man.

231
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:52,123
(camera clicks)

232
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:00,898
(woman moans)

233
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
- Price has gone up.

234
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,560
- [Man With Hat] What?

235
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,110
- The thin blue line needs
to get a little thicker.

236
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:12,906
(man with hat laughs)

237
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,896
- No more money, man.

238
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:26,200
(woman moaning)

239
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,760
Just customer.

240
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,503
No need get worried.

241
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,512
(mattress squeaking)

242
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:38,970
- What the fuck?

243
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,803
- Almost done.

244
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,930
- [Man In Black] Looks like somebody's

245
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,243
been eavesdropping on us.

246
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,200
Little old for a college boy, ain't you?

247
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,650
- I got left back.

248
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,855
(punching)
(grunting)

249
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:54,693
(tires squealing)
(brakes squeaking)

250
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:58,443
(chattering on police radio)

251
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:05,487
- [Cop] Here we go, second floor!

252
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:07,904
(gun clicks)

253
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:17,735
(punching)
(grunting)

254
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:21,652
- White boy little tougher
than he looks, slim.

255
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:25,930
(electric buzzing)

256
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,587
Got better electric
service in Jamaica, man.

257
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:33,280
(laughs)

258
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:38,443
(cops shouting over each other)

259
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,265
(crazy music)

260
00:17:58,234 --> 00:17:59,595
- Easy!

261
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:00,719
- You set us up!

262
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:05,719
(gunshots firing)
(grunting)

263
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:09,339
(wild music)

264
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:12,053
(woman screams)

265
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:14,886
(gunshots firing)

266
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:50,377
(glass shattering)
(man screams)

267
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,249
(woman screams)

268
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:54,999
(defeated music)

269
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:27,265
(rumbling)

270
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:31,475
(clanking)

271
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:33,725
(cracking)

272
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:37,176
(crashing)

273
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:41,322
(Matt screaming)

274
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:43,572
(smashing)

275
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:59,810
(sparks zapping)

276
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,060
(crashing)

277
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:15,525
(car horns honking)
(sirens whirring)

278
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,090
- [Susan] That's not the point.

279
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,730
- The story speaks for itself.

280
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,040
- The story is the earthquake.

281
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,800
- But my story is...
- Your story is shit.

282
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,840
We're burying it.

283
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,640
You'll be lucky to make page 40.

284
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,473
- What?

285
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:36,630
- You don't deserve to be a byliner, Nash.

286
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,510
You've got the passion,

287
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,760
but you're not focused in the right place.

288
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,660
You're focused on you.

289
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,313
And stop that!

290
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,470
You're wasting your life.

291
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,120
Lose this fascination with danger

292
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,090
and grow up.

293
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,030
I think you should consider
finding another job.

294
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,900
- I can't believe this!

295
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,320
- Well, believe it.

296
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,030
You know, you might've had a story here,

297
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,300
but once again, you put yourself into it.

298
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,117
Report the story, don't be the story.

299
00:21:06,117 --> 00:21:08,167
- But you always say write what you know.

300
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,410
- Goodbye.

301
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,940
- Whoa, Breech, come on,

302
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,423
just give me something to work on.

303
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,490
- There's a soft one you can have.

304
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,323
- What is it?

305
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,680
- Some environmentalists
have been hitting on us

306
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,290
to do a story on the energy crisis,

307
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,970
deregulations, brownouts,
the whole nine yards.

308
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,490
- I'll take it.

309
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,078
- The important thing is that...

310
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,328
(rumbling)

311
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,401
- This is interesting.

312
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,263
You were saying?

313
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,110
- Pay a visit to the World Survival Group.

314
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,240
- And they are?

315
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,190
- Militants.

316
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,780
A lunatic fringe of the
greens in this country.

317
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,100
They think that the energy crisis

318
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,810
was a contrivance of big business.

319
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,380
- What's my angle?

320
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,973
- Besides keeping your job,

321
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,873
get a good story,

322
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,713
without getting shot.

323
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:29,778
- Can I help you?

324
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:32,220
- Yeah, can I talk to whoever's in charge?

325
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,850
- There's not really one person in charge.

326
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,603
We're anarchist in structure.

327
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:38,421
Travis!

328
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:50,893
- Travis Gentry.

329
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,700
- Matt Nash.

330
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,593
- Rita.

331
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,300
- So, uh, what can we do for you, man?

332
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,860
- I'm with the Examiner.

333
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,260
- Yeah, you look like a reporter.

334
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,180
- How's that?

335
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,013
- No piercings.

336
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,270
- None that you can see.

337
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,830
- I've been after you guys for months.

338
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,330
It takes three people disappearing

339
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,570
to get any interest from the media.

340
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,520
- What do you mean?

341
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,100
- Didn't your editor tell you?

342
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,933
- No.

343
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,110
- See, no one takes us seriously.

344
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,810
Not police, not the press.

345
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,820
Three of our members are missing.

346
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,220
Disappeared the night they
broke into Saturn Energy.

347
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,053
- They broke in?

348
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,719
- Something tells me
you're not fazed by that.

349
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:31,680
- I'm a reporter, I break
into every place I go.

350
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,930
(rumbling)

351
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,253
You were saying?

352
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,110
- Sara Rose, Todd Stafford, Joel Burns.

353
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,440
We filed missing person reports,

354
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,050
but, uh, cops won't do much.

355
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,400
- You know for a fact they got inside?

356
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,380
- Building security says,

357
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,360
well, other than the earthquake,

358
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,920
that they saw nothing unusual that night.

359
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,620
- Why Saturn Energy?

360
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,587
- Saturn Energy built an
experimental research facility

361
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:12,420
that's not subject to
environmental impact laws.

362
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,020
- You ever been inside?

363
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,610
- No, nobody gets inside that place, man.

364
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,630
It's impenetrable.

365
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,463
- Where is it?

366
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:21,506
- [Travis] The middle of nowhere.

367
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:24,173
(serious music)

368
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:53,040
- Hola.

369
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,707
(intense music)

370
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:12,364
Gracias.

371
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:14,947
(veiled music)

372
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:12,180
Can I get my change?

373
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,505
- Yeah, right.

374
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:24,088
(active music)

375
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:18,441
- Hold it!

376
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,323
- We have a breech.

377
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:29,606
(speaking in a foreign language)

378
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:34,606
(alarms blasting)
(dog barking)

379
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:37,080
- [Woman On Loudspeaker]
Attention, security breech.

380
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,230
Sector seven.

381
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,963
All available personnel please respond.

382
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,973
(speaking in a foreign language)

383
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:56,452
(thrilling music)

384
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:03,025
(punching)
(grunting)

385
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:21,416
(speaking in a foreign language)

386
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,766
(dog barking)

387
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:26,266
(tense music)

388
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:53,192
(moves into suspenseful music)

389
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:06,467
(yelling in foreign language)

390
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,002
(typing)

391
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:11,578
(computer beeps)

392
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:21,680
- Okay, listen up.

393
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,280
Tonight we start the OTS.

394
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,293
Finally we get to put
our technology to work.

395
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:30,100
(people applauding)

396
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,590
We're going to 25% power, people.

397
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,543
Systems checks.

398
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,060
- Surge protectors, go.

399
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,123
Call lines, go.

400
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:45,428
(hushed music)

401
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,203
- [DC] Sir.

402
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,143
Do we know who he was?

403
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,080
- My men are working on it.

404
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:01,483
- And the L.A. office?

405
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,293
- It's clean.

406
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,003
- What about the police?

407
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,150
- There's no interest.

408
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,770
Besides, they'd need a warrant,

409
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,170
and that isn't gonna happen.

410
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,679
- Okay, Dr. McCullough, go right ahead.

411
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,708
(shouting in a foreign language)

412
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:30,625
You can go.

413
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,853
- There is the issue of the email.

414
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,577
- Take care of it.

415
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:47,244
(ominous music)

416
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:51,254
- Yes, sir.

417
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:54,171
(foreboding music)

418
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,630
Off limits, McCullough.

419
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,410
- But I'm a...
- You're just a geologist.

420
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,610
Tonight's a special test.

421
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,330
Only class four personnel allowed.

422
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,500
Doctor's orders.

423
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,390
- I have to talk to Gabriella.

424
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,223
- Not tonight.

425
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,123
She's extremely busy.

426
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,510
- Ready when you are, doctor.

427
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,770
- Power up.

428
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,160
- Power up.

429
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,828
Coolant go.

430
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:33,995
(vigorous rock music)

431
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:41,953
(siren wailing)

432
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,523
- [Technician] 5% power.

433
00:32:53,577 --> 00:32:55,868
10.

434
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:56,945
- 15.

435
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:59,612
(siren wailing)

436
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,170
- Release coolant in sector three.

437
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:09,673
(siren wailing)

438
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:19,853
(questing rock music)

439
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:29,829
(camera clicking)

440
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,450
25% power, holding steady.

441
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,667
- Put L.A. on standby.

442
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,046
- Go to standby.

443
00:33:47,046 --> 00:33:47,890
- [Technician] Standby confirmed.

444
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,436
- L.A. on standby.

445
00:33:49,436 --> 00:33:52,103
(puzzled music)

446
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,120
- [Dr. Eisley] Cut their
power at the target site.

447
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,176
- Cut their power.

448
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:10,843
(serious music)

449
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,230
Still holding steady at 25%.

450
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,700
- Switch to our source at the target site.

451
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,610
- Activate our source.

452
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,435
- [Technician] Activating.

453
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:31,435
(machines whirring)
(electric buzzing)

454
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:49,210
(people applauding)

455
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,824
- Magnificent!

456
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:52,450
Now hold that number for three minutes.

457
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,970
- Yes, sir.

458
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:54,803
Hold the level.

459
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,583
- I knew we'd do it. (laughs)

460
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,436
(empty music)

461
00:35:09,095 --> 00:35:09,928
- Hey!

462
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:12,447
(dogs barking)

463
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:15,780
(frenzied techno music)

464
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,860
- Hey!

465
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,650
(dogs barking)

466
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,680
Who are you?

467
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,409
(dogs barking)

468
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:26,830
What are you doing out here?

469
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,233
- I'm just passing through.

470
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,178
(dog growls)

471
00:35:31,178 --> 00:35:35,106
(dog barks)
(Matt screams)

472
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:35,939
- Ow ow ow!

473
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:38,438
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

474
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:41,021
(dogs barking)

475
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,460
Ow.

476
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,333
Aw, come on, no.

477
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:55,220
You don't have to do that.

478
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,530
(dogs barking)

479
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,573
- Anymore jokes?

480
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,699
- A priest, a monk, and
a rabbi walk into a bar.

481
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,282
(dogs barking)

482
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,640
- Get down from there or
you'll be shot for trespassing.

483
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,010
- What's going on?

484
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,560
- Why didn't you tell
me you were a reporter?

485
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,653
- You didn't ask!

486
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,618
- Reporter, trespassing.

487
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:20,451
- Matt Nash.

488
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,970
I know you.

489
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,853
You're that nut that got
shot in the crack house.

490
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,217
- Whatever it takes.

491
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:29,323
And you are?

492
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,800
- Gabriella St. John.

493
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,423
Would you get off my car?

494
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:39,060
(dogs barking)

495
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,710
- What are you doing here?

496
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,820
- I'm just looking for a story.

497
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820
- This is a research facility.

498
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,020
There's no story here.

499
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,023
- Yeah, right.

500
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:52,480
(car beeps)

501
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,543
Nice to meet you.

502
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:00,745
(expressive brass music)

503
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,250
- Nice place.

504
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,203
You a regular?

505
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:11,923
- They've been watching me.

506
00:37:11,923 --> 00:37:13,623
It's, uh, it's safer here.

507
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,440
- What did I say about being paranoid?

508
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,620
- You said, "Russ, don't worry about it."

509
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,570
I'd never accept a position I'll be in.

510
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,883
- Uh, it's very late, Russ.

511
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,253
- I've started to put
my report back together.

512
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:34,550
I've been able to reconstruct
the first quarter,

513
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,250
and I'll have the rest of it soon.

514
00:37:38,427 --> 00:37:41,094
(ominous music)

515
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,340
- You have a problem.

516
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,780
- I'm telling you, it's conclusive.

517
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,850
- Look at yourself.

518
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,330
You have got to slow down.

519
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,440
You're working too much.

520
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,350
You never sleep.

521
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,183
- These equations...

522
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,153
- Look, I'm gonna be blunt.

523
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,930
Your problem is you.

524
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,100
It's not your ex-wife,

525
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,933
it's not Saturn Energy,

526
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:15,240
and it's not our research.

527
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,088
Please, get some help.

528
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,860
- What about the report?

529
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,993
It's evidence.

530
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,980
The heat these tests are
producing is 10 times hotter

531
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,090
than anything we've produced before!

532
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,513
You know what that means?

533
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,570
We're causing these earthquakes.

534
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,710
I'm sure of it.

535
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,010
- It says there might be an anomaly.

536
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,160
There is no evidence of anything.

537
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,560
You're a scientist, Russ.

538
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,981
Start acting like one.

539
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:46,398
(expressive brass music)

540
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,581
- You got a room I could rent?

541
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:53,498
- 20 pesos.

542
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,980
- Can I help you?

543
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,863
- LAPD.

544
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,783
- What can I do for you?

545
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,463
- Looks like you got this
place running pretty smoothly.

546
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,443
- Yeah.

547
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,140
- Ever go out for the police task?

548
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:26,130
- (laughs) Twice.

549
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,963
- Four times.

550
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,025
- Really?

551
00:39:29,025 --> 00:39:30,400
- (laughs) Yeah.

552
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,233
- (laughs) Wow.

553
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,320
- Were you on duty last Sunday night?

554
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,570
- Yes, sir, yeah.

555
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,030
- Notice anything unusual,

556
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,580
having trouble in the building?

557
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,923
- No, mm-mm.

558
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,540
- Can I look at your logbook?

559
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,373
- Uh, well, I...

560
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:47,517
- You got something to hide?

561
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,667
(Abbott laughs)

562
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,743
- It's, uh...

563
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,980
- What were the repairs for?

564
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,010
- Uh, sprinklers.

565
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,423
We had a small problem up on 12.

566
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,860
- Mind if I look around?

567
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:11,420
- You know, I'll have
to get you an escort.

568
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,753
Uh, you know, rules.

569
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:18,050
(Leron whistling)

570
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,550
(weird music)

571
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,353
- New carpet?

572
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,203
- Yes, it is.

573
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:35,592
(rumbling)

574
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,050
Don't worry.

575
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,100
This building's safe.

576
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,013
- Right.

577
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,993
Okay, I've seen enough for tonight.

578
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:50,560
(sirens whirring in the distance)

579
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:08,859
(crashing)
(tires squealing)

580
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:11,276
(wild music)

581
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:26,363
(car horns honking)
(tires squealing)

582
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:28,424
(crashing)

583
00:41:28,424 --> 00:41:30,757
(exploding)

584
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:37,588
(tires squealing)

585
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:40,737
(glass shattering)

586
00:41:40,737 --> 00:41:42,487
- [Bystander] Go, go!

587
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,222
(tires squealing)
(crashing)

588
00:41:50,222 --> 00:41:52,650
(exploding)

589
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,483
(tires squealing)

590
00:42:02,342 --> 00:42:04,592
(crashing)

591
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,013
(exploding)

592
00:42:19,943 --> 00:42:22,784
(tires squealing)

593
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:25,701
(car horn honking)

594
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,922
(crashing)

595
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,859
(glass shattering)

596
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:48,315
(suspenseful music)

597
00:42:55,244 --> 00:42:58,077
(gunshots firing)

598
00:43:09,624 --> 00:43:12,541
(glass shattering)

599
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:33,772
(woman whimpers)

600
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,267
(woman screams)

601
00:43:48,022 --> 00:43:50,689
(gunshot fires)

602
00:43:56,251 --> 00:43:59,001
(sirens wailing)

603
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,443
- What happened to you?

604
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:10,940
- I cut myself shaving.

605
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,060
Is Gentry around?

606
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,940
- Not today.

607
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,200
Big fundraiser up north.

608
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,331
- Can you give me his number?

609
00:44:16,331 --> 00:44:17,720
- I can give you his cellphone.

610
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
- That's all I need.

611
00:44:20,622 --> 00:44:22,140
Any word on the missing members?

612
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:22,973
- Excuse me?

613
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:24,450
- Your friends.

614
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,463
- Oh, no.

615
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,470
It's weird.

616
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,290
I mean, they're never gone this long.

617
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,830
- Do they usually disappear?

618
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,140
- They hide out.

619
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,560
Sara never likes it.

620
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,610
That's what Todd always does,

621
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,393
lay low after a job.

622
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:38,783
What a jerk.

623
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:40,730
- Do you know them very well?

624
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,440
- Sara's my best friend.

625
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,930
She even sent me an
email from the building.

626
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,090
How cool is that?

627
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,240
- From Saturn Energy?

628
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,073
- Yeah.

629
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:48,910
I couldn't read it though,

630
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,950
all sorts of numbers and equations.

631
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,090
I gave it to Gentry.

632
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,300
He knows that stuff.

633
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,880
- Do you have a copy of it?

634
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,453
- No, he told me to erase it.

635
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,939
- Can you give me Sara's address?

636
00:44:59,939 --> 00:45:02,110
- You thinking about going to her place?

637
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:02,943
- Maybe.

638
00:45:02,943 --> 00:45:03,820
- Can I trust you?

639
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,570
- Don't I look trustworthy?

640
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,403
- Hang on.

641
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,230
- How can you guys afford
all this expensive equipment

642
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,320
if everyone's just a volunteer?

643
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,083
- Gentry got it for us.

644
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:18,884
Here you go.

645
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,830
- Thanks for your help.

646
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,860
- Um, do you have a business
card in case I want, uh,

647
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,573
need to call you sometime?

648
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,853
Thank you.

649
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:50,277
(exciting music)

650
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:55,140
- Gentry?

651
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,100
Matt Nash, Examiner.

652
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,750
- [Travis] Mr. Nash, how are you?

653
00:46:00,084 --> 00:46:02,243
- Why didn't you tell
me about Sara's email?

654
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,677
- [Travis] I'll be in Mexico tomorrow.

655
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:08,094
Let's meet there.

656
00:46:09,488 --> 00:46:12,155
(serious music)

657
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,733
- Need some help?

658
00:46:38,368 --> 00:46:40,550
- I think we got off on the wrong foot.

659
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,060
Can we start over?

660
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:42,893
I'm Matt.

661
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,410
- You were trespassing, Matt.

662
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,910
- And I learned my lesson.

663
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,190
- How many more lessons are
you gonna need to learn?

664
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,200
- As many as it takes.

665
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,290
- For what?

666
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,440
- To find out what's going on in there.

667
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,020
- Look, I told you, there's no story here.

668
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,500
Please leave me alone.

669
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,740
- Three members of the
World Survival Group

670
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,400
went into Saturn Energy
in Los Angeles last week.

671
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,120
They've been missing ever since.

672
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,323
I go looking into it,

673
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,250
obviously there's something
they don't want me to find out.

674
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,010
- And what do you think that is?

675
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:13,843
- Truth.

676
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,800
- The truth is, there's nothing going on.

677
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,083
There's no story here.

678
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,237
(mysterious music)

679
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:19,893
- Miss St. John.

680
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,480
Well thank you for coming by.

681
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,600
Good evening.

682
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,810
We were just discussing the tests

683
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,700
and the wonderful results
you two have been achieving.

684
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,170
- I spoke with Russ McCullough,

685
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,630
and he showed me a report,

686
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,773
and even though it wasn't
conclusive, I felt...

687
00:48:33,773 --> 00:48:35,360
- I know that report.

688
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,193
I've seen it.

689
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:38,070
And what you have to understand is that

690
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,820
McCullough's theory isn't new.

691
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,000
I respect him, but

692
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,100
well, there's no definitive proof.

693
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,900
- I understand, but his numbers are big,

694
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,560
and it wouldn't hurt to halt the test

695
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,120
and wait for him to finish.

696
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,810
- Lately Russ has been,

697
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:56,220
well he's been troubled.

698
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,570
I guess you should know this.

699
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,650
We've tried to get him into a program,

700
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,354
but he didn't go.

701
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:03,187
- But I think it's important we...

702
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:07,953
- The best thing for us right
now is to continue as planned.

703
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,300
- I was being shot at.

704
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,925
- Well maybe those cops
you got killed had friends.

705
00:49:16,925 --> 00:49:17,885
- Something more to that place...

706
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:18,718
- Nash.

707
00:49:18,718 --> 00:49:20,120
- And there's something
going on at that facility.

708
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,560
- Yes, research.

709
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,393
Now leave it alone.

710
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,226
- But when I went there...

711
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:26,500
- No, Nash, there is no
drama in the energy story.

712
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,523
Don't create it.

713
00:49:27,523 --> 00:49:29,360
- I thought drama sells newspapers.

714
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,380
- Real drama.

715
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,793
- This is real, Breech.

716
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:34,076
Ow.

717
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,140
- Fine.

718
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,150
Fine.

719
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,840
But a few bandages prove nothing.

720
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,673
- Yes, ma'am.

721
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,313
- Nash.

722
00:49:46,506 --> 00:49:48,063
I'm sorry about the...

723
00:49:51,445 --> 00:49:54,695
(church bells ringing)

724
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,530
- Quiet place to meet.

725
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:16,363
The email.

726
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,250
- What does it mean?

727
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,000
- Not much, it's incomplete.

728
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,360
Some geological stress equations,

729
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,980
a section of faults,
latitude regarding agitation.

730
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,000
- Earthquakes?

731
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,380
- Maybe.

732
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,750
Only Darren Claxton knows for sure.

733
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,970
- Darren Claxton?

734
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,890
- Darren Claxton is Saturn Energy.

735
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:39,680
- You're saying I need to go
inside that research facility.

736
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,560
- I'm saying if you want
truth, that's where it is.

737
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,350
- Okay, so what's in the case?

738
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,310
- Special equipment you'll need.

739
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,650
The crime finder.

740
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,280
It's a 500 milowatt,
air-cooled argon ion laser.

741
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,720
Decibel wavelength, surrounded
by linical mirror tube.

742
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,845
Just aim the light, flip
the control switch on it.

743
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:01,064
Open the door to a whole new world.

744
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:02,340
- [Matt] What will I see?

745
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,910
- Anything that'll furess.

746
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,453
Fingerprints, hair fibers,
drug residue, blood evidence.

747
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,633
- Who are you really?

748
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,170
- Just a volunteer.

749
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,820
- With some very special friends?

750
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:16,743
- When you fight for a cause

751
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,700
you tend to meet a lot
of interesting people.

752
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,533
- Sure do.

753
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:26,228
(dramatic music)

754
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:28,304
(gunshots firing)

755
00:51:28,304 --> 00:51:29,137
- [Shooter] Split up!

756
00:51:29,137 --> 00:51:32,470
(frenzied techno music)

757
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:50,722
(gunshots firing)

758
00:51:50,722 --> 00:51:53,805
(ceramic shattering)

759
00:52:23,924 --> 00:52:26,591
(woman screams)

760
00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:42,031
- [Man] Oh!

761
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:45,448
(thrilling techno music)

762
00:52:51,557 --> 00:52:54,390
(gunshots firing)

763
00:53:13,707 --> 00:53:15,309
(guard cries out)

764
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:17,137
(body thudding)

765
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:19,970
(people shouting)

766
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:27,182
- Get over there!

767
00:53:27,182 --> 00:53:28,429
(punching)
(thudding)

768
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:30,600
(gunshots firing)

769
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,017
(galloping techno music)

770
00:53:39,397 --> 00:53:42,230
(gunshots firing)

771
00:54:27,824 --> 00:54:29,396
(people screaming)

772
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:32,229
(gunshots firing)

773
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:16,668
Hey!

774
00:55:16,668 --> 00:55:19,751
(crazy techno music)

775
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,563
(gunshots firing)

776
00:56:11,264 --> 00:56:12,144
(guard grunts)

777
00:56:12,144 --> 00:56:14,561
(body thuds)

778
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:25,675
(guard coughing)

779
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:26,867
- [Guard] No, no!

780
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:27,767
(gunshot fires)

781
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:31,100
(dreadful techno music)

782
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:02,454
(speaking in a foreign language)

783
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,493
- It's a seed.

784
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,223
Eventually it grows.

785
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,093
- Not without water.

786
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,020
- McCullough showed her the report.

787
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,223
He has to be dealt with.

788
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:44,443
- Fine.

789
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,803
- And Gabriella St. John?

790
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,293
I know what you're thinking.

791
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,713
You're thinking,

792
00:58:00,087 --> 00:58:03,167
"Do I want to be known as
the man who orchestrated

793
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:05,417
"an affordable and
unlimited supply of energy

794
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:07,110
"that propelled mankind

795
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:10,193
"into the future?

796
00:58:10,193 --> 00:58:12,776
(creepy music)

797
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:16,807
"Or do I want to be known as the man who

798
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:21,027
"quit when he got scared?"

799
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,723
We all get scared, Mr. Claxton,

800
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,560
but it's the ones who face their fears

801
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,513
who win in the end.

802
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,110
And the winners write the history books.

803
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:44,110
And, uh, in yours they'll just say

804
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,543
it was part of the scientific process.

805
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,333
The email

806
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,280
went to a Rita Chetavich.

807
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,303
It's being taken care of as well.

808
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,290
- Still waiting for
that energy story, Nash.

809
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,460
- I need someone from research

810
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,860
to dig up everything they
can on Darren Claxton.

811
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:18,260
- The former secretary of energy?

812
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,637
- Yeah, DC from D.C.

813
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,420
- Why do you need information on Claxton?

814
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,420
- Looks like the man who's known

815
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,980
for getting things done inside the beltway

816
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,787
is now getting something
done inside Saturn Energy.

817
00:59:26,787 --> 00:59:29,510
- Now that would make
for interesting reading.

818
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,980
Claxton in bed with the energy companies

819
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,423
that he used to regulate?

820
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,900
You know, when Claxton was in office,

821
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,150
he waged a virtual war
against the oil corporations,

822
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:43,173
accusing them of fixing gas prices.

823
00:59:43,173 --> 00:59:45,423
(rumbling)

824
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,680
These things are getting scary.

825
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,697
- I kind of like them.

826
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,123
- You have one more.

827
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:56,883
Use it wisely.

828
01:00:02,754 --> 01:00:05,577
(phone beeping)

829
01:00:05,577 --> 01:00:06,940
- Gabby, uh, I did it.

830
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,280
I, I restored the whole report.

831
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,630
You have to read it.

832
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,310
Um, I don't know,

833
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,273
maybe we should meet at the bar again.

834
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:15,901
I...

835
01:00:15,901 --> 01:00:18,818
(suspicious music)

836
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,333
I think someone's watching me.

837
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:41,319
(sneaky music)

838
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,993
Uh, okay, listen, call me
as soon as you get this.

839
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:01,876
(bartender laughs)

840
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:06,782
(woman laughs)

841
01:01:15,158 --> 01:01:18,075
(suspicious music)

842
01:01:39,672 --> 01:01:43,602
(shouting in a foreign language)

843
01:01:43,602 --> 01:01:45,935
(exploding)

844
01:01:56,114 --> 01:02:00,320
- [Technician] 50% power and holding.

845
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,300
- How long have you known
about Russ's report?

846
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,880
- I thought we were done with that.

847
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,330
- He said someone was after him.

848
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,410
- He's paranoid.

849
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,460
- But if his numbers are correct...

850
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,864
- Please!

851
01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:09,697
Enough.

852
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:12,163
60% power.

853
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,193
- Go to 60%.

854
01:02:17,122 --> 01:02:18,610
- [Technician] Going to 60.

855
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,920
- We're getting heat in the fixtures.

856
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,200
- [Dr. Eisley] Is it acceptable?

857
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,573
- So far, yes.

858
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:27,810
- Increase the coolant component by six.

859
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,593
- Increase coolant by six.

860
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:37,030
We have 60% power and it's steady.

861
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,703
- [Technician] L.A. on standby.

862
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,020
- Cut their power at the target site.

863
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:43,800
- Cut their power.

864
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,663
- Let there be darkness.

865
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,227
(shadowy music)

866
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,720
- 60% power, still holding.

867
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,963
- Switch to our source at the target site.

868
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,879
- Activate our source.

869
01:02:59,879 --> 01:03:02,712
(uncertain music)

870
01:03:06,471 --> 01:03:08,350
(people applauding)

871
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,000
- Looks like we're in business.

872
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,337
Say goodbye to fossil fuels.

873
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:53,578
(camera clicks)

874
01:04:07,602 --> 01:04:09,935
(cat meows)

875
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,070
- I've got a weapon!

876
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,280
I'll bust your head open!

877
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,770
- Whoa.

878
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:25,920
I'm sure you would.

879
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,800
- Who are you?

880
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,000
- I'm a friend of Sara's.

881
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,833
- Name?

882
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:29,666
- Todd.

883
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,200
- Todd Stafford.

884
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,140
Man, why didn't you say so?

885
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,010
You guys have to tell me

886
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,920
the next time you run off like that.

887
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,510
How does she expect me to feed the cat

888
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:38,980
if you don't tell anyone you're leaving?

889
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,010
- Yeah, right, sorry, I...

890
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,600
She'll, um...

891
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,210
We'll, we'll be back in a couple of days.

892
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,670
- You're better looking
than Sara described you.

893
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,220
What are you doing here?

894
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,513
- I'm here to get her checkbook.

895
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,300
How crazy is that?

896
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,450
- Pretty crazy, since
she doesn't have one!

897
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,518
She calls banks

898
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:58,819
(muffled screaming)
(smashing)

899
01:04:58,819 --> 01:04:59,755
- My camera!

900
01:04:59,755 --> 01:05:02,768
(muffled screaming)
(smashing)

901
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:03,800
- Who are you?

902
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,093
- Matt Nash, Examiner.

903
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,070
Relax a second, please.

904
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,570
I'm an investigative reporter.

905
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:12,313
The picture's a little old.

906
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,570
- Fine, you're a reporter.

907
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:17,430
That doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

908
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,640
- Sara, Todd, and Joel are missing,

909
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,580
and I'm just trying to
find out what happened.

910
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,630
- What do you mean what happened?

911
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,180
They always disappear for a day or so.

912
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,780
I pick up her mail and feed the cat.

913
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,860
Not very good at the
investigative part, are you?

914
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,710
- Apparently not.

915
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:34,853
- (laughs) What are you good at?

916
01:05:36,408 --> 01:05:38,410
(phone rings)

917
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:40,010
That's my phone.

918
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:41,160
- You better answer it.

919
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:43,743
- I guess I should.

920
01:05:43,743 --> 01:05:46,410
(phone ringing)

921
01:06:08,653 --> 01:06:11,570
(foreboding music)

922
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,300
(door opening)

923
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,463
- Back to feed the...

924
01:06:27,148 --> 01:06:32,098
(punching)
(grunting)

925
01:06:32,098 --> 01:06:34,199
(crashing)

926
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,317
(gunshot fires)

927
01:06:35,317 --> 01:06:39,731
(grunting)
(punching)

928
01:06:39,731 --> 01:06:43,148
(thrilling techno music)

929
01:06:44,905 --> 01:06:48,952
(smashing)
(man cries out)

930
01:06:48,952 --> 01:06:51,493
(metallic whooshing)

931
01:06:51,493 --> 01:06:53,475
(thuds)
(man cries out)

932
01:06:53,475 --> 01:06:56,392
(glass shattering)

933
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,420
- [Man] Hey girl.

934
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:10,253
- Hey.

935
01:07:12,307 --> 01:07:13,140
Konichiwa.

936
01:07:21,165 --> 01:07:22,915
- Rita Chetavich?

937
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:23,936
- Yeah.

938
01:07:23,936 --> 01:07:25,010
- We'd like to talk to you.

939
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,616
- [Rita] Who are you?

940
01:07:26,616 --> 01:07:28,280
- It's about Sara Rose.

941
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,380
- Is she okay?

942
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,880
- Can we step outside?

943
01:07:32,235 --> 01:07:33,818
- I don't think so.

944
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:36,688
What are you doing?

945
01:07:36,688 --> 01:07:37,659
- Hey, he's got a gun!

946
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:38,728
(gunshot fires)

947
01:07:38,728 --> 01:07:39,561
(people screaming)

948
01:07:39,561 --> 01:07:40,394
Get down!

949
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:45,394
(gunshots firing)
(people screaming)

950
01:07:55,977 --> 01:07:58,644
(cars crashing)

951
01:08:02,206 --> 01:08:05,039
(Rita whimpering)

952
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:08,958
(tires squealing)

953
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,968
(cars crashing)

954
01:08:10,968 --> 01:08:13,801
(tires squealing)

955
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:19,809
(crazy techno music)

956
01:08:27,286 --> 01:08:32,286
(car horn honking)
(tires squealing)

957
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:01,999
(cars crashing)

958
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:04,360
(alarms whirring)

959
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,027
(driver shouts)

960
01:09:08,298 --> 01:09:09,328
- Yeah.

961
01:09:09,328 --> 01:09:10,637
Same one as the other two.

962
01:09:10,637 --> 01:09:13,137
(phone rings)

963
01:09:15,037 --> 01:09:15,928
Yeah?

964
01:09:15,928 --> 01:09:17,540
- Matt!

965
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,157
It's me, Rita!

966
01:09:19,157 --> 01:09:20,430
From WSG!

967
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:21,360
- Rita?

968
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,088
- They're trying to kill me!

969
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:24,397
(tires squealing)

970
01:09:24,397 --> 01:09:25,978
I came to the Fiji Bar,

971
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:27,938
and they tried to grab me!

972
01:09:27,938 --> 01:09:30,076
(Rita sobbing)

973
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:31,590
(phone breaking up)

974
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,033
- Wait wait, wait a second.

975
01:09:34,488 --> 01:09:36,855
No, say it again.

976
01:09:36,855 --> 01:09:38,477
(tires squealing)

977
01:09:38,477 --> 01:09:40,797
- They're right behind me!

978
01:09:40,797 --> 01:09:41,630
Hello?

979
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,168
- Rita, I can't hear you!

980
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:45,856
- I'm driving!

981
01:09:45,856 --> 01:09:46,744
Help!

982
01:09:46,744 --> 01:09:47,577
- What?

983
01:09:47,577 --> 01:09:48,945
- Hello?

984
01:09:48,945 --> 01:09:49,778
Hello?

985
01:09:49,778 --> 01:09:51,395
(phone breaking up)

986
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,368
Matt!

987
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:53,906
Matt!

988
01:09:53,906 --> 01:09:55,373
- Rita!

989
01:09:55,373 --> 01:09:57,016
- Matt, hello?

990
01:09:57,016 --> 01:10:02,016
(crashing)
(people screaming)

991
01:10:40,243 --> 01:10:41,373
- Rita!

992
01:10:41,373 --> 01:10:46,373
(people screaming)
(crashing)

993
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:35,435
(tires squealing)

994
01:11:35,435 --> 01:11:37,174
(man screams)

995
01:11:37,174 --> 01:11:42,174
(people screaming)
(crashing)

996
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:16,913
(electricity buzzing)

997
01:12:17,976 --> 01:12:20,424
(exploding)

998
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:24,834
(crashing)
(people screaming)

999
01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:26,944
(sparks zapping)

1000
01:12:26,944 --> 01:12:29,694
(dramatic music)

1001
01:12:39,058 --> 01:12:41,040
(car horns honking)

1002
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,290
(crashing)

1003
01:12:48,789 --> 01:12:51,706
(people screaming)

1004
01:12:53,409 --> 01:12:56,159
(frenzied music)

1005
01:13:12,623 --> 01:13:13,794
(tires squealing)

1006
01:13:13,794 --> 01:13:15,783
(car horns honking)

1007
01:13:15,783 --> 01:13:18,033
(crashing)

1008
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:27,416
(tires squealing)

1009
01:13:28,354 --> 01:13:30,937
(Rita screams)

1010
01:13:36,531 --> 01:13:38,762
(crashing)

1011
01:13:38,762 --> 01:13:41,095
(exploding)

1012
01:13:59,092 --> 01:14:00,789
(electricity buzzing)

1013
01:14:00,789 --> 01:14:04,190
(phone ringing)

1014
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,023
Rita?

1015
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,361
- [Travis] I see you're all right.

1016
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:07,202
- Who's this?

1017
01:14:07,202 --> 01:14:08,859
- [Travis] Travis Gentry.

1018
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:09,877
- Oh, I thought you were...

1019
01:14:09,877 --> 01:14:11,773
- [Travis] It's time to
take your energy story

1020
01:14:11,773 --> 01:14:12,940
to the public.

1021
01:14:45,675 --> 01:14:48,654
(phone rings)

1022
01:14:48,654 --> 01:14:52,737
(speaking in a foreign language)

1023
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,313
- [Matt] Hello?

1024
01:15:09,313 --> 01:15:10,340
- Mr. Nash?

1025
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,580
- [Matt] Who is this?

1026
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,913
- It's Gabriella St. John.

1027
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,130
- [Matt] Gabriella, are you okay?

1028
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:17,820
- I want to talk.

1029
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,420
- Not the case.

1030
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,920
- [DC] Well then what is the case?

1031
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,960
- It was an accident.

1032
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,513
- There are witnesses.

1033
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,790
- You want me to, uh...

1034
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,683
- What do you think this is?

1035
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:31,580
This is a business.

1036
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,490
We do not have shootouts in public places.

1037
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,293
We are not outlaws.

1038
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:40,455
- Aren't we?

1039
01:15:40,455 --> 01:15:43,038
(somber music)

1040
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,300
- Los Angeles and Orange County
experienced an earthquake

1041
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,700
measuring nearly 6.0 on the Richter scale.

1042
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,550
Seismologists at Cal Tech say

1043
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:59,071
the epicenter of the
earthquake was located

1044
01:15:59,071 --> 01:16:01,430
in the San Fernando Valley.

1045
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,020
Although damage control began

1046
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,440
almost immediately after the quake,

1047
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,580
FEMA has not yet released an
official number of fatalities.

1048
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:10,960
The hardest hit areas
(knocking on door)

1049
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,983
are Downtown Los Angeles.

1050
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:18,631
- [Matt] Hi.

1051
01:16:18,631 --> 01:16:19,464
- Hi.

1052
01:16:19,464 --> 01:16:20,731
- Come on in.

1053
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:23,481
(sirens wailing)

1054
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,320
- Earthquake?

1055
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,670
- Something like that.

1056
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:29,503
Have a seat.

1057
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:35,453
I'd offer you a drink, but
my glasses are all broken.

1058
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,200
- Russ McCullough is dead.

1059
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,570
They blew up a bar, and he was in it.

1060
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,770
- He is?

1061
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,610
- Research, Saturn Energy.

1062
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:46,240
He told me that they were after him.

1063
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,313
He told me.

1064
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,420
He told me, and I didn't believe him.

1065
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,653
- Who's after him, Saturn Energy?

1066
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:57,563
- He had a report about the tests,

1067
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,690
but, uh, I don't know.

1068
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:01,533
- What tests?

1069
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,070
- We're developing a new energy source,

1070
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:08,740
hot fusion.

1071
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:11,070
Hydrogen deterium and tritium gases

1072
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:14,430
energized through seven million ampheres

1073
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:17,633
through a system of high
magnetic fields and lasers.

1074
01:17:18,617 --> 01:17:19,450
- Heh.

1075
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,400
- The work we are doing
out there is so important.

1076
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,570
The clean energy we are
producing could change the world.

1077
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:27,920
- What does the report say?

1078
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,640
- Byproduct heat from our test

1079
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,170
is directed straight into the earth.

1080
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,413
That's normal.

1081
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:38,283
But the test had numbers.

1082
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,120
They pointed to a previously
undetected hairline fault

1083
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,883
under the research facility.

1084
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:47,080
The heat could be going into it.

1085
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,380
- Causing the earthquakes.

1086
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:52,590
- We've only been running at
a fraction of what we can do.

1087
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:56,050
If Russ is right, a full-powered
test could trigger a quake

1088
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:58,083
that could kill millions of people.

1089
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:00,360
- That's enough for me.

1090
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,750
- It's not conclusive.

1091
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:06,290
Russ had just finished
rebuilding his report.

1092
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,893
Now there's no proof.

1093
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:12,063
- Maybe there is.

1094
01:18:14,838 --> 01:18:17,505
(strange music)

1095
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:19,667
(glass breaking)

1096
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:20,547
- What's that?

1097
01:18:20,547 --> 01:18:23,214
(ominous music)

1098
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:43,307
(punching)
(grunting)

1099
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:45,724
(man shouts)

1100
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:51,626
(thudding)
(grunting)

1101
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:54,209
(active music)

1102
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,257
Nash!

1103
01:18:59,257 --> 01:19:02,090
(uncertain music)

1104
01:19:04,476 --> 01:19:07,476
(labored breathing)

1105
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,360
You lost the disc?

1106
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,260
That could've been our proof.

1107
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,980
- If we shut down the
test, we won't need proof.

1108
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:25,843
- I need it.

1109
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,660
- Okay, I'll show it to you.

1110
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:50,267
(Gabriella clears her throat)

1111
01:19:50,267 --> 01:19:51,680
- May I help you?

1112
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,430
- Yes, I'm up from the, uh,
company's Mexico facility.

1113
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:57,280
I have some last-minute research
before the test tonight.

1114
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,800
- Kind of late, huh?

1115
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:03,686
- Tell me about it. (laughs)

1116
01:20:03,686 --> 01:20:06,140
(Abbott laughs)

1117
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,264
- Uh, you have your ID?

1118
01:20:08,264 --> 01:20:09,097
- Oh.

1119
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,313
- Thank you.

1120
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:15,904
(beeps)

1121
01:20:15,904 --> 01:20:18,100
Okay.

1122
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,940
All right, I'll have to,
uh, give you an escort.

1123
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,060
- Oh, that's okay, I know where I'm going.

1124
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,070
- Uh, Miss, uh, St. John.

1125
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,803
Uh, company policy.

1126
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:29,963
- Yeah, sure.

1127
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:32,713
(elevator dings)

1128
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:37,820
- Now, um, you have your key, right?

1129
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,960
- Uh, no.

1130
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,523
They didn't give me one.

1131
01:20:40,523 --> 01:20:42,030
- Oh, they always do that.

1132
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:44,730
All right, listen, hang on
here and I'll go get a key.

1133
01:20:47,313 --> 01:20:50,230
(mysterious music)

1134
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,023
- Nash, I slipped the guard.

1135
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,944
We have to move fast.

1136
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:06,527
(sneaky music)

1137
01:21:16,832 --> 01:21:19,665
(guard whistling)

1138
01:21:50,596 --> 01:21:54,124
(elevator dings)

1139
01:21:54,124 --> 01:21:54,957
- Hello?

1140
01:21:55,956 --> 01:21:57,225
Miss St. John?

1141
01:21:57,225 --> 01:22:00,142
(suspicious music)

1142
01:22:04,516 --> 01:22:05,349
Leron.

1143
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,513
Leron!

1144
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,076
- This should be it.

1145
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:15,176
- This should be what?

1146
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,003
- Your proof.

1147
01:22:19,887 --> 01:22:22,054
(beeping)

1148
01:22:29,297 --> 01:22:31,990
(machine whirring)

1149
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:34,740
(haunting music)

1150
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,263
- What is it?

1151
01:22:45,263 --> 01:22:48,096
(surprised music)

1152
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:56,903
- Blood.

1153
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,118
- Uh, Mr. Zendon, we...

1154
01:23:00,118 --> 01:23:03,451
(determined rock music)

1155
01:23:08,527 --> 01:23:10,430
- And this is what's left?

1156
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:11,363
- Unfortunately.

1157
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,160
This enough to convince you?

1158
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,180
Good, now we need...

1159
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:25,165
(Gabriella gasps)

1160
01:23:25,165 --> 01:23:27,748
(men grunting)

1161
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:31,806
(punching)

1162
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,806
(wild techno music)

1163
01:23:49,364 --> 01:23:52,031
(gunshot fires)

1164
01:23:53,892 --> 01:23:55,244
- Nash?

1165
01:23:55,244 --> 01:23:57,994
(dreadful music)

1166
01:24:05,455 --> 01:24:08,288
(sharp breathing)

1167
01:24:11,394 --> 01:24:12,924
(Zendon grunts)

1168
01:24:12,924 --> 01:24:13,757
(body thuds)

1169
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:17,174
(energetic techno music)

1170
01:24:18,092 --> 01:24:19,804
- Hey, hey, stop!

1171
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:20,637
Stop!

1172
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:26,061
(tentative music)

1173
01:24:27,614 --> 01:24:30,697
(workers chattering)

1174
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:47,400
- It's dead.

1175
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,623
- [Man With Hat] For now.

1176
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,530
- You bought at least another decade.

1177
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,273
- [Man With Hat] Here.

1178
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,403
We have some work for you in the gulf.

1179
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,010
You leave tomorrow.

1180
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:05,843
(perplexed music)

1181
01:25:17,165 --> 01:25:20,350
(phone beeping)

1182
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:22,140
I want you to raise the price of our crew

1183
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,700
to another 10% on the spot market.

1184
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,533
Very good.

1185
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:37,220
- New car, Miss St. John?

1186
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,053
- Just a loaner.

1187
01:25:38,053 --> 01:25:39,420
Mine's in the shop.

1188
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:41,190
- Would you pull over the side, please?

1189
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,170
- Why?

1190
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:44,710
- [Guard] We are supposed to
hold you here at the gate.

1191
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:45,750
- Whose orders?

1192
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,703
- Mr. Clemens.

1193
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,280
- But, but that's ridiculous.

1194
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,450
I'm part of the test team.

1195
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:54,048
- Who is he?

1196
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:57,008
(dogs barking)

1197
01:25:57,008 --> 01:26:00,101
(shouts in foreign language)

1198
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:02,934
(tires squealing)

1199
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:08,160
- She called ahead.

1200
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,463
She's on her way.

1201
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,610
- We're going up to full power tonight.

1202
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:14,380
Gabriella has to be here.

1203
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:16,970
It's everything she's worked for.

1204
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,110
- I'm sorry, Dr. Eisley,

1205
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:20,560
but you're going to have
to carry on without her.

1206
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:24,920
- [Matt] Pretty nifty backdoor, huh?

1207
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,990
- Oh my god.

1208
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:26,823
- What?

1209
01:26:26,823 --> 01:26:28,020
- This is a coolant tunnel.

1210
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,170
- Is that bad?

1211
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:30,003
- Very.

1212
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:34,770
- Release maximum coolant.

1213
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:38,147
All sectors, go to 30%.

1214
01:26:38,147 --> 01:26:39,810
(typing)

1215
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,651
- Coolant released.

1216
01:26:41,651 --> 01:26:44,417
(alarm wailing)

1217
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:45,570
- What is it?

1218
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,010
- If we don't shut the coolant off,

1219
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:48,447
we're gonna drown in here.

1220
01:26:48,447 --> 01:26:51,114
(siren wailing)

1221
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,207
(beeping)

1222
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:57,183
- 50%.

1223
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,700
There's a drop in the coolant.

1224
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:01,840
Where did that come from?

1225
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,800
- Doctor, we're getting
massive heat in the fixtures.

1226
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,390
Without that coolant, the
system will destroy itself.

1227
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,223
- We have to lower it.

1228
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:08,660
- Go to 70%.

1229
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:09,520
- But Doctor!

1230
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,712
- 70%!

1231
01:27:11,712 --> 01:27:15,962
(typing)
(beeping)

1232
01:27:20,352 --> 01:27:23,352
(suspenseful music)

1233
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:26,260
What's the coolant reading?

1234
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,010
- Still dropping.

1235
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,510
- It's in the red.

1236
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:30,513
- 80%!

1237
01:27:32,483 --> 01:27:36,280
(electricity buzzing)

1238
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,720
- I think Eisley will listen to me.

1239
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,553
It's DC I'm worried about.

1240
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,240
- I'll deal with mister beltway.

1241
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,820
You just get in there and stop the test.

1242
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:42,880
- The control room is this way.

1243
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,392
DC's office is up there.

1244
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:47,160
(electricity buzzing)

1245
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,530
- I said 80!

1246
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:51,030
- But Doctor, we can't.

1247
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,690
- Stop the tests.

1248
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:53,640
- [Dr. Eisley] Gabriella!

1249
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,410
- This facility is on
a fault line, Doctor.

1250
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:57,060
We are causing these earthquakes.

1251
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,660
- No, no, those stress
equations are anomalies.

1252
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:00,493
80%.

1253
01:28:00,493 --> 01:28:02,210
- The report is conclusive.

1254
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,190
- Russ is not well, I told you that.

1255
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,303
- Russ is dead.

1256
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,110
They've killed him.

1257
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,280
- I'm working on a new story,

1258
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,113
a byline,

1259
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:13,293
and you're the subject.

1260
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:16,750
- Can I ask what it's about?

1261
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,080
- I think I'll open with the
three murders at Saturn Energy.

1262
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,683
- Sensationalism.

1263
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:25,130
Of course that's what you're good at,

1264
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:26,800
even if the story's not true.

1265
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,800
- It's all true.

1266
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,750
- Oh is that right?

1267
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,923
Can I ask what your proof is?

1268
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:34,460
- I saw it with my own eyes.

1269
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,290
There was blood all over the place.

1270
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:37,123
- That's terrible,

1271
01:28:37,123 --> 01:28:38,470
but go to the police with that, tell them!

1272
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:39,483
90%, 90%!

1273
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:41,900
- Don't do this, Doctor.

1274
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:42,733
Please.

1275
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,740
Doctor!

1276
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:48,550
- Well Mr. Nash, it seems you've got us.

1277
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:50,580
I guess the fact that you broke in here

1278
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,720
and threatened us with a gun

1279
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:55,010
doesn't diminish the
credibility of your proof.

1280
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,555
- That's a chance I'm willing to take.

1281
01:28:57,555 --> 01:28:58,733
- You know, Mr. Nash,

1282
01:29:00,970 --> 01:29:01,940
you and I

1283
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:06,773
are a lot more alike than you know.

1284
01:29:06,773 --> 01:29:09,940
(electricity buzzing)

1285
01:29:11,173 --> 01:29:12,443
- It's peaking.

1286
01:29:12,443 --> 01:29:13,301
- We're gonna break apart!

1287
01:29:13,301 --> 01:29:18,301
(rumbling)
(electricity buzzing)

1288
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:22,592
(exploding)

1289
01:29:22,592 --> 01:29:24,842
(grunting)

1290
01:29:26,701 --> 01:29:28,203
(gunshot fires)

1291
01:29:28,203 --> 01:29:29,181
