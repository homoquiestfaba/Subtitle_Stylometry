Did he say anything to you?

544
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,213
He just said,
"bring me a bottle of rum."

545
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,725
God damn it, Cornelius,
open up.

546
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,728
You got me looking
through keyholes.

547
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,231
What's going on here?

548
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,732
I thought I was your friend.

00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,753
Did he ever mention
the <i>prince of Malta?</i>

552
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,755
No.

553
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,257
Never.

The dutchman?
Wettering?

571
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,331
He claims he was born
in Australia

572
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,832
of a Dutch father.

573
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,834
That apparently

574
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,836
is the only
honest word he's spoken

575
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,337
since he came here.

576
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,839
We put him in the computer
at Langley.

577
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,842
Should have something back
tonight.

578
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,343
I'll be sticking around
a few days.

579
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,844
I want you
to stay on guerin.

580
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,346
I don't care if he knows.

00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,349
Call me.

00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,850
It doesn't matter what time.

583
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,861
People who are made angry
by the presence of a policeman

584
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,864
interest me.

585
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,365
Perhaps you've heard
of my friend's

586
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,367
legendary intemperance,
sergeant,

587
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,869
but not of his
exaggerated sense of pride.

588
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,372
He hates to have people
see him when he's sick.

589
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:11,375
You're not my bloody lawyer.

590
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,377
I'm not sick; I'm drunk.

591
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,378
Three days now.

592
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:18,382
And you haven't been out
of your apartment

593
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,385
in that time,
particularly two nights ago?

594
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,886
No.

595
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,889
Can you give proof?

596
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,390
No.

597
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,894
This man was murdered
two nights ago.

598
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,396
About 1:00 A.M.

599

<i>from Kenya.</i>

<i>But his papers were taken.</i>

602
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,405

<i>(Cornelius)</i>
<i>why should I?</i>

604
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,410
We were hoping you might.

605
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,413
This was found
in his bed-table drawer.

606
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,921
Maybe the man
admired courage.

607
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:00,424
You are a consular officer,
Mr. Guerin,

608
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,927
so I suppose
I should be tolerant of you.

609
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,430
I didn't know the man.

610
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,433
I wonder if you would mind
coming to my office,

611
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,934
heer wettering.

612
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,436
<i>We might inquire</i>
<i>into this affair</i>

613
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,937
<i>in some more detail.</i>

614
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,942
When did you say
this murder occurred, sergeant?

615
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:21,445
Approximately 1:00 A.M.
Wednesday morning.

616
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,946
Oh.

617
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,950
I was drinking
with Cornelius

618
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,952
until well after 2:00 A.M.
Wednesday.

619
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,455
And why
did you not say so earlier?

620
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,457
I didn't know where
you were going with this thing.

621
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,462
Thank you for the tea,
heer wettering.

622
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,963
How did he die,
this man?

623
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,965
He was garroted.

624
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,968
We haven't found
the murder weapon.

625
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,971
But it cut so deeply
into the flesh,

626
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,473
it almost severed the neck.

627
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,476
We believe it was applied
slowly.

628
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,978
A very cruel death.

629
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,490
All right,
who is this guy?

630
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,491
I didn't kill him.

631
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,992
Come on, god damn it.
You owe me this.

632
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,495
I didn't ask you
to make a fool of yourself.

633
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,996
Tell them you were confused.

634
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,999
Your watch was broken
or something.

635
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,000
I wouldn't have thought

636
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,501
you could be this much
of a coward.

637
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,003
Get out of here, would you,
before I put you out myself.

638
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,505
Oh, you couldn't even
manage that

639
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,506
<i>without your little gun.</i>

640
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,033
Hi, sweetheart.

641
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,535
Not tonight.

642
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,558
Stephen, come in.

643
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,564
What is this,
Freddy?

644
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,066
Love or politics?

645
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,584
I'm grateful for your
coming here, Mr. Guerin.

646
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:46,590
Stephen, this is
Dr. Karl seemueller.

647
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,092
May I offer you
some tea?

648
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,102
Friedrich,
wait for US outside.

649
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,112
You a medical doctor?

650
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,614
Of philosophy only,
I'm afraid.

651
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,617
Economics,
the gray science.

652
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:17,120
You get gray by mixing
black and white, don't you?

653
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,123
That would seem a rather
inappropriate science

654
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,624
where you come from.

655
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,125
[Laughs]

656
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,127
You have wit.

657
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,629
That's comparatively unknown
in our profession.

658
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,632
What is "our" profession,
doctor?

659
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,135
You work for
the department of state,

660
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,138
and I work for the ministry
of foreign affairs.

661
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,141
I'm not, and you're not,
and we both know it.

662
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,644
Well, what
do you think I do?

663
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:44,648
South African bureau
of state security.

664
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,149
You're a b.O.S.S. Agent.

665
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,152
B.o.s.s. Isn't called that
anymore.

666
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,654
It's the national
intelligence service now.

667
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,656
Well, b.O.S.S. Suits you.

668
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,661
We want to recruit you.

669
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,663
Why?

670
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,164
You're an experienced
operative.

671
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,166
Competent.

672
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,169
Extensive contacts
in Western Europe.

673
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,670
What makes you think
I'd work for you?

674
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,671
[Laughs]

675
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:11,174
My friend,
you killed a fellow agent

676
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,676
in the American service.

677
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,678
That's not nice.

678
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,179
He was a traitor.

679
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,182
I made a decision
in the field.

680
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:23,187
Unfortunately, your service
didn't see it like that.

681
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,689
And this factor's come
to dominate your life.

682
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,191
<i>Or should I say</i>
<i>the absence of one?</i>

683
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,695
And you cannot afford,
heer guerin,

684
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:35,699
to be contemptuous of anyone
who offers you an alternative,

685
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,201
even the devil.

686
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,705
If all this is true,

687
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,707
why am I still
in government service?

688
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,208
You're an exile.

689
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,711
They've eliminated every record
that you even exist,

690
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,714
much less earned a living
for the last 15 years.

691
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,718
Even your social security card
has been expunged.

692
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,720
You cannot gain employment.

693
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,222
You're their prisoner.

694
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,229
You know a lot.

695
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,233
You'll consider our offer?

696
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,734
Of course I'll consider it.

697
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,737
I'd like to get out of here
without getting mugged.

698
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,241
For your trouble.

699
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,244
What is it
you really want?

700
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,747
I'm being perfectly frank
with you, Mr. Guerin.

701
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,248
Now, please, take it.

702
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,250
Keep it.

703
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,752
And that black thug
out there?

704
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,253
I don't want him
tailing me.

705
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,756
His name's merton.

706
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,257
Catch him if you can,
Mr. Guerin.

707
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,761
But I warn you,
don't discount him.

708
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,292
Jesus.

709
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,794
Sorry, mate.

710
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,796
I thought
you were someone else.

711
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:13,797
What are you doing here?

712
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,298
I'm glad you're home.

713
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,300
Good.

714
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,802
'Cause all of a sudden,
I'm in a shitload of trouble,

715
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,303
and I don't know why,
but I think you do.

716
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,805
What do you mean?

717
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,807
Ever since the bank,
I've felt it,

718
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,308
the air getting thick.

719
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,311
And tonight
some South African spook tried

720
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,313
to recruit me to spy for him.

721
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,316
All right, I'll tell you,
but you've got to help me.

722
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,817
Not likely.

723
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,820
Someone's got hold of jan,
someone from the past.

724
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,821
They'll kill him.

725
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,823
So call a cop.
I can't.

726
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,324
Well, they must want
something, then.

727
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,326
Give it to them.

728
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,828
I can't do that.
Neither can jan.

729
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,830
Although he must have
thought that he could.

730
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,331
He's so desperate
to get away, you see.

731
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,334
What are you saying?

732
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,336
He'd sell out
his own father?

733
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,337
Where is he?

734
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,839
Freighter in the harbor.

735
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,841
They telephoned
this afternoon.

736
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,842
I wouldn't talk to them,

737
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,845
but, unfortunately,
jan did.

738
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,847
And then I became concerned,
and I followed him.

739
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,849
It was the bloody bank,

740
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,350
<i>you see.</i>

741
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,353
<i>My damn picture went</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

742
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,358
Who are the players?

743
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,861
A couple of hot-shot boys
from Hong Kong.

744
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,863
<i>The hsung brothers.</i>

745
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:20,864
They don't look like much,

746
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,867
but you know how
the Chinese feel about family.

747
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:27,370
Well, these two murdered
their younger brother,

748
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,873
and all he did was Nick
a few Bob from the company.

749
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,374
<i>Yeah, go on.</i>

750
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,877
I need you to help me save jan.

751
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,378
What have I got to do with it?

752
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:38,382
I didn't mean
for it to happen, Stephen,

753
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,384
but the cesspool overflowed,

754
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,387
and your shoes just happened
to be right next to mine.

755
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,889
[Sighs]

756
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,390
My life was already
screwed up.

757
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,892
Now you're telling me

758
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,394
that I'm sucked into all this
just because I'm your friend?

759
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,896
The only one I have.

760
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,401
Let's go.

761
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,403
Thank you, Stephen.

762
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,916
<i>(Stephen)</i>
<i>there's no sign of the crew.</i>

763
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,417
I know.

764
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,420
It's wrong.

765
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,922
Is it a trap,
do you think?

766
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,424
I don't know.

767
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,952
Huh?

768
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,456
[Pounding]

769
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,961
He was terrified.

770
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,963
Let's try this way.

771
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,670
<i>Holy mother of Christ.</i>

772
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,685
He was just a spoiled lad.

773
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:05,696
It's leather,

774
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:09,199
same as the Kenyan
in the morgue photo.

775
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,701
<i>When they poured</i>
<i>the water on him,</i>

776
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,704
<i>it shrunk and tightened.</i>

777
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,708
Let's get him out of here.

778
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,709
No.

779
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,711
We won't get out
ourselves.

780
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,213
He's your son,
for Christ's sake.

781
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,214
<i>He was not my son.</i>

782
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,717
He was my...

783
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:28,719
Fancy boy.

784
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,728
Well, I don't give a shit
about that.

785
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,229
We're not going
to leave him here.

786
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,731
He's dead; He had no family.

787
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,734
[Gunshot]

788
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,736
Ah!

789
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,753
S-Stephen.

790
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,256
[Breathing heavily]

791
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,258
I'm sor-sorry.

792
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,260
Look; You better tell me

793
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,262
what the hell
is going on now,

794
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,764
because I'm in this thing
up to my goddamn eyeballs.

795
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,266
Three people
have been killed.

796
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,767
All right.

797
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,269
Get me a drink.

798
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,770
I'll tell you.

799
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:32,282
The hsungs own ships.

800
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,283
Some years ago,

801
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,285
I captained
an old tanker for them.

802
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,287
The <i>prince of Malta.</i>

803
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,288
<i>Yeah.</i>

804
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,291
We ran oil to South Africa
from the Gulf.

805
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,793
There was a u.N. Embargo
at the time, of course,

806
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,797
but all it means to them
is more profit.

807
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,299
<i>We're dodging missiles</i>
<i>and gunboats</i>

808
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,800
<i>from the Iranians, but...</i>

809
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,302
These bastards,
they don't give a shit.

810
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:56,306
Anyway,
they call me in.

811
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,808
A little favor,
they want.

812
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:03,814
They'll pay me a bloody fortune

813
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,816
if I sink the <i>prince.</i>

814
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,818
Insurance.

815
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,820
It happens more than we know.

816
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,321
<i>People have made</i>

817
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,323
<i>millions and millions</i>
<i>of dollars, Stephen.</i>

818
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:17,327
And there's no crime
one can't buy

819
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,329
for millions of dollars.

820
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,332
I imagine they got you
for a little less.

821
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:30,340
Well, it was for my retirement,
you see.

822
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,343
Last chance, at my age.

823
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,346
Hell, I didn't know anything
about explosives.

824
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:39,349
They had to show me how
to set the timer

825
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,352
and where to place the charge.

826
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,354
We were running south
to Cape Town,

827
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:47,357
where we were supposed
to deliver our cargo.

828
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,359
(Stephen)
The crew must have known something.

829
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,360
(Cornelius)
Half of them

830
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,862
couldn't even read or write,
let alone speak English.

831
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,364
(Stephen)
What about the mate?

832
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,365
(Cornelius)
Joshua.

833
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,866
He was a canny one.

834
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:00,871
I swear to you,

835
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,372
he knew something.

836
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,873
Somehow, he knew.

837
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,376
That was your conscience.

838
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,878
No, no,
it was more than that.

839
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:12,883
Anyway, I started
to bring her in close

840
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,887
so the crew would have
an easy row in.

841
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,388
What happened?

842
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:24,894
They told me that it was
a wee, small charge.

843
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,397
Let the sea in slowly,

844
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,399
<i>and everybody</i>
<i>into the boats.</i>

845
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,905
It was a bloody atom bomb!

846
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,910
No boats, no time,
everybody blasted into the sea.

847
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,914
<i>The explosion,</i>
<i>the flames, screams.</i>

848
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:51,922
You could smell
the burning flesh.

849
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,925
And the sharks.

850
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,427
I can still hear it.

851
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,929
I shut my eyes;

852
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,932
I can see it.

853
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,935
Jesus, god.

854
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,439
And you were the only survivor.

855
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:12,942
I thought so then.

856
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:16,947
Until I saw the mate.

857
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,449
36 men.

858
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:22,952
Stephen, they swore to me
that no one would be hurt.

859
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,956
They weren't having witnesses.

860
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,457
Scared to death

861
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,460
the South Africans
would find them out.

862
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,965
You've got something, don't you?

863
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:35,966
That's why they're all here.

864
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,970
The ship's log.

865
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,471
Inside is a bill of lading

866
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,973
for the cargo we sold secretly
in mombasa.

867
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,475
Anybody would know from that.

868
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,478
Give it to them.

869
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,980
I can't; They'd kill me
the minute they had it.

870
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,985
Would that be worse?

871
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,148
<i>[Thunder rumbles]</i>

872
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,183
[Whispers]
Stephen.

873
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,686
Stephen.

874
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,192
Shh.

875
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:54,237
Espresso,
three sugars.

876
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,239
You remembered.

877
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,241
Of course.

878
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,246
We lost you
for part of last night.

879
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:04,247
Where were you?

880
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,249
Choir practice.

881
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:11,254
I heard you were posted
station chief in San Juan.

882
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,757
Not bad for a lady
of color.

883
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,760
Why did they send you?

884
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,766
Why are you talking
to the South Africans?

885
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,769
Breaks the monotony.

886
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,270
What does seemueller want?

887
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,271
Me.

888
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,272
What'd you say?

889
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,773
No.

890
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,776
Don't you think you ought
to ask Langley first

891
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,277
what they want?

892
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,778
I don't care
what they want.

893
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,280
Yes, you do.

894
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,782
You don't have
any other choice.

895
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,284
[Chuckles]

896
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:44,287
You enjoy this,
being my keeper?

897
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,293
It just happened to fall
under my responsibilities.

898
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,296
I don't think we should
let it get too personal.

899
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,298
