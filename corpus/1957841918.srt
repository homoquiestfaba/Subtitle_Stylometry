1
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:25,163
<i>Legends tell that in the
midst of the 15th century</i>

2
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,565
<i>the wickedest of dragons
blackened the skies</i>

3
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:33,369
<i>across southern England
with his reign of terror.</i>

4
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:35,605
<i>His name was Yuto.</i>

5
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:42,345
<i>This continued until the
brave Sir Arthur Miller</i>

6
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:46,149
<i>slayed Yuto,</i>
the last of his kind...

7
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:49,118
<i>...finally bringing peace
to the land.</i>

8
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:52,789
<i>Death, however,</i>

9
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:55,758
<i>could not constrain
this powerful beast,</i>

10
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,127
<i>and, with the help
of an evil wizard,</i>

11
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:02,965
<i>his ghost passed back
into our world.</i>

12
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,100
<i>"Seek out your slayer's
offspring,"</i>

13
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,636
<i>the wizard told
the ghost dragon.</i>

14
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:13,275
<i>"Capture their life force
within this diamond.</i>

15
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:18,645
<i>A male and a female,
no more than 50 years apart.</i>

16
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:21,282
<i>Repeat this cycle
for five centuries,</i>

17
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,619
<i>and your own life force
shall be restored."</i>

18
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:29,957
<i>And so, for 500 years,</i>

19
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,760
<i>this is just
what Yuto has done...</i>

20
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:37,030
<i>Terrorize the offspring
of Sir Arthur Miller</i>

21
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:41,968
<i>in order to once again become
a living and breathing dragon.</i>

22
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:32,349
Sorry, Yuto!
But it ends here!

23
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:40,222
I'm afraid it's you
who ends here.

24
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:02,143
I won't let you
trap any more souls!

25
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,218
What? No!

26
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,729
I don't know how you escaped...

27
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,736
but you will get
back in the box.

28
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,617
Foolish boy!

29
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:48,954
There is no hope
without the light knife.

30
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:52,290
- The what?
- Yes!

31
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:55,027
The only thing that can
destroy the diamond

32
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,995
and set the life force free.

33
00:04:58,062 --> 00:04:59,662
I probably shouldn't
have said that.

34
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,699
- Where is it?
- Hidden away,

35
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:08,105
where only a member of
your bloodline could ever find it.

36
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:10,207
I shouldn't have
said that, either.

37
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:11,842
No matter.

38
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:15,178
Even if you manage
to escape that box again.

39
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:22,085
You'll forever be tied
to the realm between worlds.

40
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:26,856
Into the realm
of shadow and fear,

41
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:31,527
bind your spirit to the mirror.

42
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,595
I'm sorry, Abigail!

43
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,302
Winston Miller, the owner

44
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:19,371
and final surviving heir
of Echoville Manor,

45
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:21,606
passed away this evening.

46
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,776
Mr. Miller was jailed in 1970

47
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,611
when his great nephew
William disappeared

48
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,280
under suspicious circumstances

49
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:31,217
which remain unsolved
to this day.

50
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:33,151
<i>William was only seven years old</i>

51
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,553
<i>when he was last seen
on the property by a butler.</i>

52
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:38,689
<i>And even after extensive
and wide-ranging searches,</i>

53
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:41,226
<i>his remains were never found.</i>

54
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,028
<i>Despite insisting on being
overseas at the time,</i>

55
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:47,198
<i>Mr. Miller was accused
of foul play.</i>

56
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,466
<i>Elderly locals here
in Messina Falls</i>

57
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:52,836
<i>still recall the shocking incident
in their sleepy hollow town.</i>

58
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:54,238
<i>But for most people,</i>

59
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:56,874
<i>it's a forgotten footnote
in time.</i>

60
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,344
<i>Winston Miller is said to have
no known surviving relatives,</i>

61
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,113
<i>so the manor will revert
to local banking authorities,</i>

62
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,215
<i>should no one come forward.</i>

63
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:10,685
<i>This is Summer Randall,
News Channel 3. Back to you.</i>

64
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,341
Is that the last of it
from the market store?

65
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:34,876
Yeah.

66
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,446
Shame that we have
to shut it down...

67
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:43,683
because your mom would never
have let that happen.

68
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:53,259
Here. Thanks.

69
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,265
Hmm...

70
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:02,769
- Hmm.
- Power's cut, too.

71
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:07,273
Well...

72
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:12,411
Then we'll just have
to eat all that ice cream

73
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:14,646
before it melts.

74
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:17,616
- Yeah?
- Sounds like a plan.

75
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,151
Let's go.

76
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:32,530
I think it's about time we put
those first editions up for sale.

77
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,766
Mm, no. I don't think
you should do that.

78
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,201
What's the point
of collecting them

79
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:39,869
if they're worthless
when you need them?

80
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,338
I'd feel...

81
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,508
I don't know.

82
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,611
We'll get through it.

83
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,779
We've gotten through worse.

84
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:53,717
You sound like your mom.

85
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,391
Now you sound like me.

86
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:11,233
Okay.

87
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,269
Uh-uh, I'll do it.

88
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,070
Thank you.

89
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:21,109
Remember what your mom
always said?

90
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:23,378
- Tomorrow's not today.
- Right.

91
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:26,114
- Good night.
- Good night, Dad.

92
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:46,699
Good night, Mama.

93
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,569
<i>Elizabeth.
Come to the door.</i>

94
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:54,440
<i>Come to the door.
Come to the door, Elizabeth.</i>

95
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:56,809
<i>Come to the door, Elizabeth.</i>

96
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:06,451
<i>Come to the door.</i>

97
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:15,060
<i>Come to the door, Elizabeth.</i>

98
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:19,163
<i>Come to the door.</i>

99
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,465
<i>Elizabeth. Come to the door.</i>

100
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,503
Hello?

101
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,106
<i>Come to the door, Elizabeth.</i>

102
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,212
Hello?

103
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,966
Was that someone at the door?

104
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,535
This was pinned to the door.

105
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:04,138
"EM"?

106
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:12,480
"Dear Abigail...

107
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:15,916
We regret to inform you

108
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:19,586
that your great uncle Winston
Miller has passed away."

109
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,222
I did not know
Mom had a great uncle.

110
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:23,089
Hmm.

111
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,792
"After much investigation,

112
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:28,161
you have been found to be
his final surviving relative.

113
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:31,832
As such, you are now
the sole heir

114
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:35,534
to Echoville Manor
in Messina Falls,

115
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:40,038
which has been in
your family since 1685."

116
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,348
Hmm. These pictures
say 1965.

117
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,153
A mansion?!

118
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,257
"The custodian Juan Sanchez
to meet you

119
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:02,126
to hand over the keys
in the coming days."

120
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:05,363
And then it's just signed "EM"?

121
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:10,902
Is this real?

122
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,970
- I mean...
- I think it's real.

123
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:17,541
You know,
we could sell this place

124
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:20,310
and then have enough money
to pay back the bank.

125
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:25,047
And I could reopen my shop.

126
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,116
I don't know.

127
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:33,055
This place has been
in mom's family for like...

128
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:34,023
ever.

129
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,025
Fair point.

130
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:41,696
- How about we sleep on it?
- Okay.

131
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,600
- Good night.
- See you in the morning.

132
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,921
- Dad.
- Hmm.

133
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,456
- Dad.
- Hmm.

134
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,992
- Dad, wake up. Wake up.
- Hmm.

135
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,732
I think we should
go check out Echoville.

136
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,703
And then we can
decide what to do.

137
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,070
Mm.

138
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,439
When do you wanna go?

139
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,541
No time like the present.

140
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,015
I've just been looking up what I can
about the manor. There's not much.

141
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,518
A few blogs, but they
just say that it's haunted.

142
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,653
Boo!

143
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,722
Dad, please.

144
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:46,223
You don't believe
that hogwash, do you?

145
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,591
Of course not.

146
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:49,761
Good girl.

147
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,530
So, um, I've been thinking

148
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:55,266
about our options
once we get there.

149
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,102
Okay.

150
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:03,106
So, we can just move
right into Echo House.

151
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:04,507
Echoville.

152
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:08,344
Echoville, and make it our own.

153
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:13,149
Of course, we might
get a little lonely

154
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:14,718
with all those empty rooms.

155
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:17,787
- Maybe we could Airbnb them.
- We could.

156
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:19,288
Or...

157
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:24,159
I could turn it
into a recording studio

158
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:26,695
and invite artists
from all over the world

159
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:28,430
to come and record their albums,

160
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:30,833
and we could feed them,
and we could accommodate...

161
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,201
And what happens when summer's
finished and I go back to school?

162
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:40,141
Or we could just not
get ahead of ourselves.

163
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,646
Uh, okay, so option B is
that we put it on the market,

164
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:48,148
because I feel that
we could make enough money

165
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:50,417
to pay off the vultures
at the bank,

166
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:56,122
and then have enough
left over to start a new life.

167
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:05,999
You're not sold
on selling, are you?

168
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,300
No, it's just...

169
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,504
I wish Mom were here.

170
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:16,175
She's always with us.

171
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:45,402
You sure you don't
wanna come with?

172
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:46,603
Just gonna take a look around.

173
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,639
Okay.
But don't get lost.

174
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:58,147
Hey, come back here!

175
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:10,191
You can run, but you can't hide!

176
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:15,430
You can't ride forever.

177
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:19,534
Come back with that owl!

178
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:24,605
Get back, you jerk!

179
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,246
Out of the way!

180
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,348
Watch out!

181
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:37,284
Happy Birthday!

182
00:16:50,263 --> 00:16:52,632
Lizzy.
You ready?

183
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:58,503
I'm so sorry.

184
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,373
- Are you okay?
- Nothing we can't resolve in court.

185
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:05,144
Hey! Hey!
Get back here!

186
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,478
Later.

187
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:21,292
Let's go.

188
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,897
Echoville Manor.

189
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,401
Hope the house is in
better shape than the sign.

190
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:12,775
Uh.

191
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:20,148
Hmm. No.

192
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:22,582
Hmm. No, no, no.

193
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:23,851
Hmm?

194
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:31,892
It's a lot bigger
than I thought it would be.

195
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,560
The picture doesn't
even do it justice.

196
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,030
It is a lot of work
for just one man.

197
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:38,865
Oh, sorry, folks.

198
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,034
I'm Juan Sanchez, the
custodian here at Echoville Manor.

199
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:44,503
Oh, I'm James Oren.

200
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,571
It's a pleasure to meet you.

201
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:49,108
And you must be Abigail.

202
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,046
I'm Elizabeth, her daughter.

203
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:56,782
Okay. So where is Abigail?

204
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,458
Hmm. Who's this?

205
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:14,299
Welcome to Echoville Manor.

206
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:15,800
Wow.

207
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:18,635
You can say that again.

208
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:20,103
Wow.

209
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,872
The manor was
originally built in the 1500s.

210
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:23,639
Then after, Joseph Miller,

211
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:26,710
your great-great-great-great-
great grandfather,

212
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,411
shipped the building here
to Messina Falls

213
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,881
brick by brick in the 1800s.

214
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:32,448
Why?

215
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:37,119
Legend has it that it was
to get far away from a ghost.

216
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:39,088
However, it didn't really
help the situation

217
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:41,824
that they rebuilt it on an
ancient druid burial site.

218
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,161
I'm joking.

219
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:50,900
So, what are your plans?

220
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:54,736
We thought that we would move
in and stay here a few weeks,

221
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:57,504
and, you know, maybe
clean the place up a little

222
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,908
and figure it out from there.

223
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:03,245
Well, I am on hand to help you
with whatever you need.

224
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:07,447
Um, well,
thank you, Mr. Sanchez.

225
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:10,050
- Juan, please.
- Juan.

226
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:12,720
But we're... we're really
not in a position

227
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:14,188
to pay someone right now.

228
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,291
Oh, no. Did you not
read the whole letter?

229
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,525
The estate covers my services.

230
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:23,395
- Are you serious?
- That's awesome. What?

231
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:26,498
It is my pleasure. Why
don't you take a look around?

232
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:29,269
I still have some work to do
on the roof before it gets dark.

233
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,670
Okay. Thanks.

234
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,810
Okay.

235
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:43,447
Hey, race you
to find the best room.

236
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:46,718
You're on.

237
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:48,053
Ready?

238
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,022
Three, two...

239
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:53,926
Hey! Cheater!

240
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:21,985
I found my room!

241
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:23,153
Me too.

242
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:09,162
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

243
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:10,529
Floor.

244
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,666
Who's the fairest of them all?

245
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:18,204
It's Elizabeth, you knucklehead.

246
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,743
Hey, I'm gonna go get
the bags out of the car.

247
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,177
I'll be down in a sec.

248
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,163
What? What?
What is it?

249
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,297
I...

250
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:49,632
It was a... a spider.

251
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,770
A spider?

252
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:54,405
Was it the size of a cat?

253
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:56,572
At least.

254
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:59,943
Well, uh, I think you
scared it away,

255
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,746
as well as anything else
in a 10-mile radius,

256
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:05,915
so, um, you're gonna help me
with those bags?

257
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:20,594
- Oh.
- Here, let me get that for you.

258
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,564
This looks fun.

259
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:25,500
I love puzzles.

260
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,568
She's my little puzzle princess.

261
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:30,105
You are.

262
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:32,841
I'm Connie. I live
right across the way.

263
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:35,376
Hi, I'm James Oren.

264
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:37,411
And this is my
daughter, Elizabeth.

265
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:38,512
Hello.

266
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:40,014
Can I help with anything?

267
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:43,217
- You could get the door.
- Oh, sure.

268
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,619
What was that?

269
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:53,259
Okay.

270
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,363
- I'll just take these upstairs.
- Yeah.

271
00:23:58,597 --> 00:24:02,469
So you just live
across the road.

272
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:04,504
With... with your husband?

273
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:05,939
Oh, no.

274
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:10,075
Boyfriend? Girlfriend?

275
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:11,910
It's just me, I'm afraid.

276
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,881
Yeah.

277
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:42,339
They do say it's 13 years bad
luck to move into a new house

278
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:44,441
and then stare
into the mirrors right away.

279
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:47,110
Oh, I...

280
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,246
Do they?

281
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:51,815
Dates back to King Henry VIII's
reign in England, 150...

282
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:54,484
1509 to 1547.

283
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:56,752
Wow.

284
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:58,821
Well, you know your stuff.

285
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,690
My Mom, she was a bit
of an English history buff,

286
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:04,126
so kind of rubbed off.

287
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:06,162
That's lovely.

288
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:09,031
So I guess you already
know, then,

289
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:11,299
that the residents in those days

290
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,401
deemed it bad luck
to move into a new house

291
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,103
that didn't already have
its mirrors covered up.

292
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,839
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

293
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:20,775
It was considered
extremely unlucky.

294
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,982
But you know, those are
old wives' tales.

295
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,250
You never know
which ones to believe in

296
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:31,885
and which ones not to, right?

297
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:39,326
He's a cutie.

298
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:43,963
Oh, that's... Arthur.

299
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:46,432
It's silly.

300
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:52,738
- That's your mom?
- Yeah.

301
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:55,708
She's beautiful.

302
00:25:56,776 --> 00:25:58,277
You have her eyes.

303
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:06,051
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

304
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:09,821
I get so nosey sometimes.

305
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:11,990
Just tell me to stop.

306
00:26:13,391 --> 00:26:14,959
It's okay.

307
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:22,900
So, how long should
we keep them covered?

308
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:24,669
So that we avoid the bad luck?

309
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:27,838
Oh, they say at least a week.

310
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:33,042
Should we go cover the others?

311
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:39,683
There you go.

312
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:45,855
That's it.

313
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:01,003
<i>Elizabeth, don't be scared.</i>

314
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:02,437
<i>Over here. Hello.</i>

315
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:04,272
<i>Come to the mirror.
Elizabeth.</i>

316
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:18,486
Hello?

317
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:28,061
Afternoon.
Is your father in?

318
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:31,364
Dad!

319
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:41,840
Mr. Alessi.

320
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,577
How did you...

321
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:47,279
We have ways to track people.

322
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:51,816
Um, well, would you like
to go in the study?

323
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:54,385
No, I'll be brief.

324
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:56,821
Seems you've come
upon a windfall.

325
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:58,691
Well...

326
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:03,494
It's not so much me as
it is my late wife's family.

327
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:05,630
Again, my condolences.

328
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:07,397
However, I'm here to inform you

329
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:09,801
that based on the contract
that you signed with us,

330
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,435
any inheritance that you befell

331
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:14,638
can be seized
to cover your debts.

332
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:17,274
And I understand that.

333
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:19,943
We're going to fix the place up

334
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,045
and sell it to get
the money to pay you,

335
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:25,147
with interest, of course,

336
00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:29,885
but... it takes time
to get these things ready.

337
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:31,620
You... you understand?

338
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:33,989
Despite what you might
think of me, Mr. Oren,

339
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:36,158
I am not an unreasonable man.

340
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:38,361
So here's what I'll do.

341
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:41,062
I'll give you a month
to fix this place up,

342
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:44,466
find a buyer,
whatever you need to do.

343
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:46,301
Yes. Thank you.

344
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:49,772
However, if this place
has not sold after a month,

345
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,106
A squid Savings and Loan

346
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:52,708
will seize this place
in its entirety

347
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:54,342
to cover our agreement.

348
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,043
But I mean, you can't just...

349
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,345
Or we can seize it today.

350
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,423
Very well.

351
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,459
Shall we say, stroke of
midday after 28 days?

352
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:15,895
Yes.

353
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:20,199
And thank you, sincerely.

354
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:26,938
Good day.

355
00:29:32,244 --> 00:29:33,880
Well...

356
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:35,914
we better get busy.

357
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:50,662
Only a month? Hmm.

358
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:52,463
I hope that's enough time.

359
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,333
I don't know, Clarence.

360
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,903
The things these kids
post out on them InnerTubes,

361
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:01,404
oh, boy, I do not get that.

362
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:02,640
Yes, sir.

363
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,608
Well, howdy, folks.

364
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,078
- Just this lot?
- Uh-huh.

365
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:10,246
Oh, with...

366
00:30:10,313 --> 00:30:11,981
All right. Thank you.

367
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:17,921
I haven't seen you folks
around these parts.

368
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:19,021
Passing through?

369
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:20,890
Not exactly.

370
00:30:20,956 --> 00:30:23,660
We're just doing some renovations
on a house that we inherited.

371
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:25,627
Oh, very nice.

372
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:27,429
Well, now that you know
where we are,

373
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:29,699
you can keep that paint flowing.

374
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:30,899
Yes, sir.

375
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:34,770
Oh, looks like 57.92.

376
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:36,037
Thank you.

377
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:37,706
Which part of town
is the property?

378
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:39,140
Happy to lend a hand.

379
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:42,477
Well, that's very nice.
It's...

380
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:44,479
Actually, it's Echoville Manor.

381
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,390
Thanks for shopping at Nix.

382
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,794
Did I say something
to offend him?

383
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:01,361
Next.

384
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:07,366
Here, let me help with
that paint. Thank you.

385
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,336
Whoa!

386
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:16,308
- The BMX bandit returns.
- Sorry again about yesterday.

387
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,646
Aren't you the people
moving into Echoville Manor?

388
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,013
Yeah.

389
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,316
Um, hey, why did the guys inside

390
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,318
have such a problem with that?

391
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,856
People around here, especially
the older ones, think it's haunted.

392
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:34,659
Boy disappeared there many
years ago. Hasn't been lived in since.

393
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:38,997
- How do you know that?
- I'm a bit of a ghost story nerd.

394
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:41,598
Plus my father's the custodian.

395
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,835
Oh, Juan is your father.

396
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,972
Yeah. These...
are for him.

397
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:49,807
Um, here, let's...

398
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,508
Let's give you a... a ride back.

399
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:54,076
- Thank you.
- How about that?

400
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:56,512
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.
Thank you.

401
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:03,152
Okay, get all the...

402
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,789
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

403
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:08,089
I have your owl statue.

404
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:09,926
Actually, it belongs to you.

405
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:11,393
Well, to Echoville.

406
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:12,995
I was getting it back
after those two took it.

407
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:15,297
Oh. What's so special
about it?

408
00:32:15,363 --> 00:32:17,299
There's a key inside.

409
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:18,935
I don't know what it opens, but I
couldn't let those two just take it.

410
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:23,004
Well, thank you, then, I guess.

411
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:26,942
Do you want to stay for tea?

412
00:32:27,008 --> 00:32:29,044
- Oh, I don't really drink it.
- Oh, no.

413
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:33,547
Sorry, it's what my Mum...
Mom... used to call dinner.

414
00:32:33,614 --> 00:32:35,149
She was English.

415
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:36,751
Never mind.
Just come on.

416
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,094
<i>Now don't be scared, okay?</i>

417
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:52,332
But you cannot sell the...

418
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:55,034
Um, not again.

419
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,168
What?

420
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:59,404
I... it... The tap.

421
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,243
I don't see anything.

422
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,416
Sorry, it was the...
Uh, it was a... a spider.

423
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:14,318
- Another spider.
- Oh.

424
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:16,320
It's a big house, honey.

425
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:18,422
We're probably gonna
have a few roommates.

426
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:20,659
I can spray the house tomorrow.

427
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:22,193
Yeah.

428
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:28,633
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.

429
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:31,368
Just gave me a scare.
I'll be fine.

430
00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:33,771
These will be ready soon.

431
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:48,852
- Thank you. It was delicious.
- Thank you.

432
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:53,355
- Bye, Mateo.
- Thanks again. See you tomorrow.

433
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:55,491
Now is my chance.

434
00:34:23,316 --> 00:34:25,619
Okay, Baron Zumati.

435
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:28,288
Forces ain't gonna
stop me tonight.

436
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:34,593
<i>Software update complete.</i>

437
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:35,461
Update?

438
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:37,931
Wonder what they've added.

439
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:42,334
Okay, where are you, ghouls?

440
00:34:48,674 --> 00:34:50,241
I need to speak with you.

441
00:34:50,308 --> 00:34:52,678
What? They can talk now?

442
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,546
This software update is sweet.

443
00:34:55,346 --> 00:34:57,750
Could you stop that, please?

444
00:34:57,817 --> 00:35:00,285
It's like I can
actually touch them.

445
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:01,887
This update is wild!

446
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:06,858
Enough with the poking!
I need your help.

447
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:11,129
Now, if I might...

448
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,330
Not again!

449
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:15,133
What's going on in there?

450
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,702
Nothing.
Just this game.

451
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:20,603
I got scared by the game.

452
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:22,639
Keep it down
or I'll take it away.

453
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:23,974
Okay.

454
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:28,244
I need you to remain calm.

455
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:29,612
Are you gonna hurt me?

456
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,448
No. I just need
to talk to you.

457
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:34,117
I need your help.

458
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:36,085
Who are you?

459
00:35:36,152 --> 00:35:37,620
It's not important.

460
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:40,322
Just call me Ghoster for now.

461
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,992
Why are you here?

462
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,762
I jumped into the mirror
on your bike at Echoville.

463
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:47,663
The place really <i>is</i> haunted.

464
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,297
Wait, does this mean my
house is haunted now too?

465
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:52,768
Oh, man!
Dad's gonna kill me.

466
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,103
He just remodeled the kitchen.

467
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,638
This house isn't haunted.

468
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:58,405
At least, I don't think so.

469
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:00,809
But listen, this is important.

470
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:04,813
- You can't let the Orens sell Echoville Manor.
- Why?

471
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,814
Because I've been
trapped there for 50 years

472
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:09,150
when an evil ghost dragon
called Yuto imprisoned me

473
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:11,852
when I tried to destroy
a diamond he hid at Big Ben.

474
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,188
So, he tied me to the realms
between your world and mine

475
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,891
by trapping me in mirrors with
a curse which can't be broken

476
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:19,459
unless I get the light knife
by outsmarting him.

477
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,695
Come again?

478
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,264
- I've been trapped...
- Right.

479
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,498
- ...by an evil force...
- Got it.

480
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:29,702
- ...when I tried to steal his diamond...
- Okay.

481
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:31,638
- ...from Big Ben.
- Mm-hmm.

482
00:36:31,704 --> 00:36:33,472
- I need to best him...
- Oh.

483
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:36,643
- ...and get the light knife...
- Getting it.

484
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:39,544
- ...to be released from the mirrors...
- Got you.

485
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,214
...so I can destroy
his diamond.

486
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:44,683
Okie-dokie.
Just one more thing.

487
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,853
It's some kind of hidden
camera show, isn't it?

488
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,355
Okay, Aaron.
You can come out now.

489
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:52,658
You got me.

490
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:54,992
How are they doing this?

491
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:57,360
This is a projection
or something?

492
00:36:58,229 --> 00:36:59,596
This is not a joke!

493
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:01,431
So you're really real.

494
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:03,901
I assure you, I am.

495
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:05,670
But how can I help?

496
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:07,905
I need your help
to talk to Elizabeth.

497
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:11,107
Every time she sees me,
she screams.

498
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:13,542
It's really quite annoying.

499
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,378
Okay, but why do you
need her help?

500
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:19,381
Well, here's the thing.

501
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:26,822
Whoa, hey.

502
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:30,159
- Hi, Mr. Oren. Is Elizabeth in?
- Yes.

503
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:34,029
Lizzie?
Mateo's here.

504
00:37:35,764 --> 00:37:37,132
She's in the kitchen.

505
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:53,715
- Hey.
- Hi.

506
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:00,453
What's up?

507
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,889
Do you know about
<i>Día de los Muertos?</i>

508
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:05,325
The Day of the Dead.
Yeah, a little bit. Why?

509
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:08,028
We believe that death is
just part of the journey of life,

510
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:10,731
and that rather than death
ending life,

511
00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:12,431
new life comes from death.

512
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,933
It's a nice way to look at it.

513
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,533
Exactly. There's
dancing and feasts,

514
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,069
and it gives us
a bit of relationship

515
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:19,171
- with what happens after death.
- Right.

516
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:23,175
So that when things occur,
which would usually seem strange,

517
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:25,811
they're actually not so strange.

518
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,413
You mean strange like
how you're being now?

519
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,148
No, I mean, yes.

520
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:32,416
- I'm being strange, but with good reason.
- Hope so.

521
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:34,986
What I'm really
trying to say is...

522
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:37,889
Oh, just spit it out, will you?

523
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:43,094
That went a lot smoother when
we practiced it last night, Mateo.

524
00:38:43,161 --> 00:38:45,529
- That? You... it's...
- Elizabeth.

525
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:47,197
Elizabeth, meet...

526
00:38:47,264 --> 00:38:48,498
Ghoster.

527
00:38:48,564 --> 00:38:49,934
I'm sorry to have frightened you

528
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,803
when I tried to introduce
myself before.

529
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:57,608
Mm... mm?

530
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:00,010
Right.

531
00:39:00,077 --> 00:39:01,679
Now that's out of the way,
let's get down to business.

532
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:03,646
I need your help.

533
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:05,480
You'd better stay calm for this.

534
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:08,318
This is pretty wild.

535
00:39:08,384 --> 00:39:10,485
Okay, so first things first.

536
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:12,554
You can't sell this manor.

537
00:39:12,622 --> 00:39:15,625
- Why?
- Say it slowly.

538
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:18,060
We need to wait
until the next full moon,

539
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:21,330
so that the doorway to the
chamber in the basement will appear.

540
00:39:21,396 --> 00:39:22,931
Why? What happens there?

541
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:25,934
We have to pass the
extremely dangerous challenges

542
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:27,970
and retrieve
the light knife from Yuto.

543
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:30,038
That's the only time
we can do it.

544
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:33,642
But the good news is that the
next full moon is in three weeks.

545
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:37,745
Friday the 13th.
Oh, spooky.

546
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:41,349
Well, I guess that's ominous.

547
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:45,953
So what's the knife light
and what is a Yuto?

548
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,689
You're forgetting the
extremely dangerous challenges.

549
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:51,791
- How could I?
- It's light knife.

550
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:55,061
And Yuto is a ghost dragon,

551
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:58,365
and for centuries, in an
effort to achieve being reborn,

552
00:39:58,431 --> 00:40:01,401
he steals the souls
of children in my family,

553
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,636
which he encases
within his diamond.

554
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:06,038
Which is in the bell tower
of Big Ben in London.

555
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:08,107
Yes, I know where Big Ben is.

556
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,843
Except it's not
in the real London,

557
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,078
but in a painting of it.
Only...

558
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:14,545
We don't know
where the painting is.

559
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,815
Uh-huh.

560
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:20,052
Yes, it was hanging
in the house,

561
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,553
but after the last time I entered
to try and destroy the diamond,

562
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,822
someone took it down.

563
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,426
Look, I don't have time
for this...

564
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,294
nonsense.

565
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,763
I have so much work to do to
help my dad fix up the manor,

566
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:36,234
so I wish you both luck with...

567
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,567
this.

568
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,770
Please, I can't do it
without you.

569
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:42,205
Looks like it's
just us men, Ghoster.

570
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,807
No offense, Mateo,

571
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,109
but we're going to need
all the brain power we can get

572
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:48,512
to pass the extremely
dangerous challenges.

573
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:50,347
We went over this.

574
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:51,915
Right.

575
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,917
She's the brains.
I'm the brawn.

576
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:56,318
Exactly.

577
00:40:56,385 --> 00:41:00,056
At least, Yuto told me
where the light knife is.

578
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:02,324
He told you how to defeat him?

579
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:05,261
Doesn't seem like the smartest
ghost dragon, does he?

580
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:07,129
You might change your mind

581
00:41:07,196 --> 00:41:08,964
after you see
the first challenge.

582
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:12,600
Yeah, there's a good chance
we might get squished.

583
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:14,836
I'm not gonna be able
to squish this.

584
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,640
You're not doing a very
good job of convincing me.

585
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:21,142
Please, Elizabeth!
This isn't just for me.

586
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:24,412
It's for all the lost souls
trapped in Yuto's diamond.

587
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:25,846
They're my family.

588
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:28,248
I don't know. I can't
disappoint my Dad.

589
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:30,050
Hold on.

590
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:32,820
You have three and a half
weeks to sell the manor, right?

591
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:35,456
So that means we have time
to help Ghoster

592
00:41:35,522 --> 00:41:37,558
and still fix this place up.

593
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:40,861
If, and that's a big if,

594
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:44,097
but <i>if</i> I agree to help,

595
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:46,632
you two both have to work
double time to help me and my dad

596
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:48,301
get this place ready to sell.

597
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,869
- Deal.
- Right.

598
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:51,604
Where should we start?

599
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:18,662
Great work, team.
Only 27 more rooms to go.

600
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:29,573
Hey, Anita.

601
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,174
Yeah, that's fine.

602
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:33,943
Show him in. See if he
wants some refreshments.

603
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,111
Okay.

604
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:40,650
Mr. Lee.

605
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,786
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

606
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,924
Time is of the essence,
so I will be prompt.

607
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:51,026
I represent a powerful client.

608
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:56,031
We are looking for the instant
acquisition of land in Messina Falls.

609
00:42:56,098 --> 00:43:00,102
Now, our reasoning
is... confidential.

610
00:43:00,169 --> 00:43:03,639
But I assure you that
our urgency is paramount.

611
00:43:03,704 --> 00:43:05,907
Great, I'll put you in contact with
somebody on our business team.

612
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:09,810
We're actually interested
in a very particular site.

613
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:11,746
Echoville Manor.

614
00:43:11,812 --> 00:43:15,216
As far as I understand, you
are in the process of acquiring it?

615
00:43:15,283 --> 00:43:17,451
Working on the paperwork
right now.

616
00:43:17,518 --> 00:43:19,553
But you know these things take
time, so I'm sure we'll have it done...

617
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,354
We need you to speed up
the process.

618
00:43:39,305 --> 00:43:42,708
We expect to break ground
in two weeks, Mr. Alessi.

619
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:45,311
Good day.

620
00:43:54,018 --> 00:43:57,555
So let me get this straight.

621
00:43:57,623 --> 00:44:00,593
Yuto, a ghost dragon,

622
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:02,760
trapped your life force
in a diamond

623
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:05,296
that's hidden
in a painting of London.

624
00:44:05,363 --> 00:44:07,998
But you have no idea where
this painting of London is.

625
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:10,200
No, but even if I did,

626
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:13,303
I still need the light knife
to break the diamond within it.

627
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,707
I learned that the hard way
the last time I escaped

628
00:44:15,772 --> 00:44:18,008
and Yuto caught me
in the painting.

629
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:20,210
That's when he tied me
to the mirrors.

630
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:22,345
If you're tied
to the mirrors at Echoville,

631
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:24,213
how were you able
to get to Mateo's house?

632
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,050
If one mirror passes
another, I can jump into it.

633
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:29,552
So you can
jump into this mirror?

634
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,920
I can!

635
00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:36,092
Who's that?

636
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,462
- My Mom.
- She's beautiful.

637
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:45,400
She passed away a while ago.

638
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:48,069
I'm so sorry.

639
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:50,372
Hey, Ghoster,
are there others like you?

640
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,073
You mean ghosts?

641
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,809
A few, but we're not
all connected.

642
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:57,344
I wouldn't be able
to track her down,

643
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,380
if that's what you're asking.

644
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,881
Oh.

645
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,586
So how did you end up here?

646
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:07,521
Well, I was little.

647
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:09,223
Seven, I think,

648
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,858
so my memories
aren't that great.

649
00:45:11,924 --> 00:45:14,994
My parents, they passed away.

650
00:45:15,795 --> 00:45:17,563
I was sent to live here.

651
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,932
I was terrified,

652
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,268
so I would hide most days.

653
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:25,738
One day I went
to the cellar to hide...

654
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:27,506
and I never came back.

655
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:29,408
Then what happened?

656
00:45:29,474 --> 00:45:31,109
It's a blur.

657
00:45:31,176 --> 00:45:33,812
I was pulled into something,

658
00:45:33,879 --> 00:45:36,683
like a fly caught
in a spider web.

659
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:38,083
So you had no family?

660
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:43,821
I had a baby sister,
barely six months.

661
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:46,658
But she passed away, too.

662
00:45:46,725 --> 00:45:48,559
That's so sad.
I'm sorry.

663
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:52,463
It's quite all right.
Thank you, Elizabeth.

664
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,399
So the cellar,
what's down there?

665
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:57,068
The owl painting.

666
00:45:57,134 --> 00:46:00,738
It's like the painting
of London with one difference.

667
00:46:00,805 --> 00:46:03,006
You need a key to pass into it.

668
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:33,323
There, that's the one.

669
00:47:41,098 --> 00:47:42,332
I don't understand.

670
00:47:42,399 --> 00:47:44,168
How does the key
work with the painting?

671
00:47:44,234 --> 00:47:47,004
Only during the full moon
will the door be revealed.

672
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,372
If we have the key,

673
00:47:48,439 --> 00:47:50,139
we'll be able
to enter the painting.

674
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,009
That's where the challenges are.

675
00:47:55,879 --> 00:47:57,079
What do you know about them?

676
00:47:57,146 --> 00:47:59,583
Only that I can't
pass them alone.

677
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:04,387
It will take teamwork
and, honestly, a little luck.

678
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:07,355
There's puzzles and traps
that, let's just say,

679
00:48:07,422 --> 00:48:10,125
- there's a chance that you could...
- What?

680
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:13,562
End up like me.

681
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:19,669
Okay.

682
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:21,670
We just need to know
how to beat the challenges.

683
00:48:21,736 --> 00:48:23,605
I wish I knew more.

684
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:26,875
But the information within the
four walls of Echoville is limited.

685
00:48:26,942 --> 00:48:30,077
Believe me, I've gone
through every book here.

686
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:31,512
And I know just where to look.

687
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,148
Come on.
Let's head into town.

688
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:36,818
Wi-Fi in this place is terrible.

689
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:39,018
Wi-Fi?

690
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:45,759
Uh... I think
you missed a spot.

691
00:48:45,826 --> 00:48:47,227
And I think you didn't.

692
00:48:47,293 --> 00:48:50,096
You are covered
from head to toe.

693
00:48:50,163 --> 00:48:55,033
I think that that chimney has
soot in it from the dawn of time.

694
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,468
Mm-hmm.

695
00:48:59,238 --> 00:49:01,006
It sure is a shame
you have to sell the place.

696
00:49:01,073 --> 00:49:04,376
I wish there was another way...

697
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:07,279
because there is
so much history here.

698
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,583
As a child, that was
my favorite painting.

699
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:15,854
As a child?

700
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:20,592
I... I thought this place had
been abandoned for 50 years?

701
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,696
- Um...
- Going into town for some air.

702
00:49:24,763 --> 00:49:27,832
Oh, hey, we need
some more white paint!

703
00:49:27,899 --> 00:49:30,835
And... sandpaper.

704
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:32,937
Sure, Dad.

705
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,437
And ice cream.

706
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,143
So let me get this right.

707
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,311
Everyone now has a device
in their pockets

708
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:44,814
that has the answer
to literally every question

709
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:49,251
that any person has ever
asked in the history of time.

710
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:53,188
And they mostly use them
to look at cat pictures?

711
00:49:53,255 --> 00:49:56,292
Well, not every question.

712
00:49:56,358 --> 00:49:58,092
I can't find anything
about Yuto.

713
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:00,796
Well, we just have
to keep looking.

714
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:14,609
- Hey.
- Hey.

715
00:50:18,913 --> 00:50:21,548
Lizzie, um, have a seat.

716
00:50:37,664 --> 00:50:40,067
"Due to your failure to submit

717
00:50:40,132 --> 00:50:42,803
the supporting documentation
within the allotted time,

718
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:45,671
all property,
including Echoville Manor,

719
00:50:45,738 --> 00:50:47,640
will be seized
within seven days."

720
00:50:50,108 --> 00:50:52,612
They can't!
He gave you his word!

721
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:55,681
Unfortunately, these vultures
can do whatever they want.

722
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:58,851
They don't care
about people like us.

723
00:50:58,918 --> 00:51:00,720
We have to do something.

724
00:51:00,786 --> 00:51:02,119
We can't, Lizzie.

725
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:04,055
We must!

726
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:07,792
Dad, you don't understand!
We can't let them take it!

727
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,259
At least, now just now.

728
00:51:09,326 --> 00:51:10,895
We have to fight for the next...

729
00:51:12,162 --> 00:51:13,632
eleven days.

730
00:51:13,698 --> 00:51:16,166
Eleven?

731
00:51:16,233 --> 00:51:17,668
Then what happens?

732
00:51:19,003 --> 00:51:22,006
Then what happens?

733
00:51:22,072 --> 00:51:24,575
<i>The doorway
to defeat Yuto will open.</i>

734
00:51:24,642 --> 00:51:26,209
Who said that?

735
00:51:27,077 --> 00:51:28,244
Dad.

736
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:30,446
Dad.

737
00:51:31,414 --> 00:51:32,750
- Dad!
- What?

738
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,151
Remember how you said
you didn't believe in ghosts?

739
00:51:41,423 --> 00:51:43,726
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Oren.

740
00:51:46,029 --> 00:51:48,397
- Oh!
- Dad!

741
00:51:48,463 --> 00:51:52,166
Well, that went as well
as it could.

742
00:51:56,504 --> 00:51:59,908
So that's why we need
just a little more time.

743
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:01,810
And once we do all that,

744
00:52:01,877 --> 00:52:04,445
then you can
let them have the house.

745
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:07,514
You know,
this... is crazy.

746
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,988
But your mom wouldn't have
let us just give up without a fight.

747
00:52:14,055 --> 00:52:15,956
So you're in?

748
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:17,490
I'm in.

749
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:21,027
One, two, three!

750
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:23,295
- Go team!
- Okay.

751
00:52:24,064 --> 00:52:27,332
So, now what?

752
00:52:27,399 --> 00:52:29,736
I've got just the thing.

753
00:52:31,004 --> 00:52:35,842
When I was in college,
I was the Halloween king.

754
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:17,948
This should buy us some time.

755
00:53:33,863 --> 00:53:35,197
You need a hand?

756
00:53:35,263 --> 00:53:37,298
We're doing research, actually.

757
00:53:37,365 --> 00:53:39,869
Ooh, fun.
What for?

758
00:53:39,935 --> 00:53:41,770
For the Scare Squad.

759
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:46,507
Scare Squad?
What's that?

760
00:53:46,574 --> 00:53:48,342
The bank broke
its promise to dad,

761
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:50,845
and it's trying to repossess
Echoville before we can sell it.

762
00:53:50,912 --> 00:53:52,546
Oh, no.

763
00:53:53,948 --> 00:53:56,718
- When are they coming?
- As early as tomorrow.

764
00:53:56,785 --> 00:54:00,821
- So before Friday the 13th.
- Exactly.

765
00:54:00,888 --> 00:54:04,357
Well, is the Scare Squad
recruiting?

766
00:54:05,626 --> 00:54:08,128
Do you want to join?

767
00:54:08,195 --> 00:54:10,998
Well, I can't just sit
around and do nothing

768
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:13,833
and let them kick you out
without a chance to sell the place.

769
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:20,106
Welcome the newest member
of the Scare Squad, Connie.

770
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:25,812
Oh, and I should probably
introduce you to Ghoster.

771
00:54:28,446 --> 00:54:30,481
Hello.
How do you do?

772
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:33,384
Oh.

773
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,453
Hello.

774
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,995
Hello!

775
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:49,332
We're here from the bank
to repossess the property.

776
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:53,737
Mr. Oren!

777
00:55:27,435 --> 00:55:28,871
Come on.

778
00:55:40,348 --> 00:55:41,816
Mr. Oren.

779
00:55:56,462 --> 00:55:57,697
Hello.

780
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,437
Boo.

781
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:27,491
Mr. Oren.

782
00:56:27,558 --> 00:56:29,160
It's time to leave.

783
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:34,065
We could do this the easy way
or the not so fun way.

784
00:56:39,169 --> 00:56:41,772
Do you have to check
yourself in every mirror?

785
00:56:48,378 --> 00:56:51,315
I want to suck your blood!

786
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:13,868
<i>Let me guess.</i>

787
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:17,639
You got frightened away
by ghosts.

788
00:57:19,975 --> 00:57:22,277
You know, yours is the 10th team

789
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:25,713
to come back saying
that that place is haunted.

790
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:30,784
But I know it's not.

791
00:57:34,154 --> 00:57:35,556
Come here.

792
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:51,571
So they want to play games.

793
00:57:53,706 --> 00:57:56,242
It looks like I'll be
paying them another visit.

794
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:16,560
Mr. Alessi,
what can we do for you?

795
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:19,697
What's this about my men being
scared away each time I send 'em?

796
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,632
Uh, I don't know.

797
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:23,134
They come in here just fine,

798
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,202
but then they all
leave in a hurry.

799
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:26,904
Every single one of 'em
coming back saying

800
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:28,805
that this place is haunted.

801
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,007
Haunted? Echoville?

802
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,976
I think they're
pulling your leg.

803
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,679
You're welcome to go in
and see for yourself.

804
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,149
Yeah, I think I will.

805
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,618
Would you like us
to show you around?

806
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,853
No. That won't be
necessary.

807
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:48,157
Knock yourself out.

808
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:01,602
Let's see if this place
really is haunted.

809
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:20,776
Haunted my...

810
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,234
This is crazy.

811
01:00:52,873 --> 01:00:54,441
This place isn't haunted at all.

812
01:00:54,508 --> 01:00:56,143
Tried to tell you that.

813
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,445
Just have your stuff packed
and ready to go by tomorrow.

814
01:00:58,512 --> 01:01:01,348
No more excuses.
No games.

815
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,374
This is Alessi.

816
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:34,213
My client is growing
impatient, Mr. Alessi.

817
01:01:34,279 --> 01:01:37,316
Why have you not acquired
Echoville Manor yet?

818
01:01:37,382 --> 01:01:40,785
Minor details, Mr. Lee. But I
can assure you,

819
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:43,788
I will have the manor in my
possession by this time tomorrow.

820
01:01:43,854 --> 01:01:45,790
We paid you a considerable sum

821
01:01:45,856 --> 01:01:47,626
to make sure
that this went smoothly.

822
01:01:47,693 --> 01:01:51,630
We do not like it when
things do not go smoothly.

823
01:01:51,697 --> 01:01:53,197
<i>And I appreciate that.</i>

824
01:01:53,264 --> 01:01:55,399
Just give me a final 24 hours

825
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:58,034
and then you and the Golden Dragon
Corporation can commence demolition.

826
01:01:58,101 --> 01:01:59,637
Golden Dragon?

827
01:01:59,704 --> 01:02:01,404
Yuto!

828
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,839
What'd you say?

829
01:02:02,906 --> 01:02:05,342
I didn't say anything.

830
01:02:05,408 --> 01:02:09,212
No, just now, you...
You said Yuto.

831
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:10,447
<i>Yuto?</i>

832
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:12,415
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

833
01:02:12,481 --> 01:02:14,049
you strange little man.

834
01:02:14,116 --> 01:02:16,986
<i>But you have 24 hours
and not a second more!</i>

835
01:02:17,052 --> 01:02:21,090
Otherwise, we will be
forced to reclaim

836
01:02:21,156 --> 01:02:24,426
our generous little offer...
with interest.

837
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:35,403
Guys, it's Yuto!

838
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:37,772
That's why the bank
is kicking you out.

839
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,610
So he can destroy the mansion,
trapping me in here forever.

840
01:02:41,677 --> 01:02:43,211
How do you know?

841
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:45,045
I heard him say the name
of the company who wants it...

842
01:02:45,112 --> 01:02:47,281
The Golden Dragon Corporation.

843
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:48,515
Dragon!

844
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:51,184
Yuto is a ghost dragon?

845
01:02:51,251 --> 01:02:52,819
So, Dad,

846
01:02:52,886 --> 01:02:55,657
you might be wondering why
there is a ghost talking to us,

847
01:02:55,723 --> 01:02:58,292
so don't be scared, but...

848
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,926
Me? Scared?

849
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:02,028
Ghoster and I go way back.

850
01:03:02,094 --> 01:03:04,130
- You do?
- Sure!

851
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:06,667
I even tried to help him
escape on the last full moon.

852
01:03:06,733 --> 01:03:08,167
But we didn't get far out.

853
01:03:08,234 --> 01:03:10,136
Couldn't figure out
the first challenge.

854
01:03:10,202 --> 01:03:12,773
But we never told you, because
we thought you'd freak out.

855
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,440
Why would I freak out?

856
01:03:14,507 --> 01:03:17,576
Ghoster's one of the last
living owners of Echoville.

857
01:03:17,643 --> 01:03:18,843
He was?

858
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,879
Yes, my great uncle owned it,

859
01:03:20,945 --> 01:03:24,416
but they locked him up when they
thought that he had caused me harm.

860
01:03:24,482 --> 01:03:27,419
But it wasn't him!
It was Yuto!

861
01:03:27,485 --> 01:03:29,789
And I've been trapped
here ever since.

862
01:03:29,854 --> 01:03:36,393
Wait, if your great uncle
is my mom's great uncle too...

863
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:39,698
Does that make you...

864
01:03:39,764 --> 01:03:41,165
my uncle?

865
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:45,570
But I was told my sister
died with my parents.

866
01:03:45,637 --> 01:03:49,573
And Abigail was told
that she was sent away

867
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,108
to live with her great
grandmother to protect her.

868
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:55,078
I... I have a family.

869
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:59,683
Well, I guess that means when,
or if you beat the...

870
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:00,850
Yeah, what's his name again?

871
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:02,051
Yuto.

872
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:05,020
Him, if you beat him,

873
01:04:05,087 --> 01:04:07,889
this manor reverts to you,
as the living heir.

874
01:04:07,956 --> 01:04:11,360
What do you mean,
living heir? I'm dead!

875
01:04:11,426 --> 01:04:13,730
Well, I mean, if you free
your life force,

876
01:04:13,796 --> 01:04:15,631
you could come back to life.

877
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:19,167
Or not.

878
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:21,837
Uh, I probably said
too much there.

879
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:24,305
I don't think it works that way.

880
01:04:24,372 --> 01:04:26,307
Once the life forces are freed,

881
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:29,009
we will all be reunited with
the rest of our departed families

882
01:04:29,076 --> 01:04:30,444
in the spirit world.

883
01:04:30,511 --> 01:04:33,782
But if this house was mine,
I promise...

884
01:04:33,849 --> 01:04:37,183
My family would always
have a home here at Echoville.

885
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,552
Really?

886
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:42,055
All this time, I thought
I was alone in these worlds.

887
01:04:42,122 --> 01:04:45,860
But now, I've found my family.

888
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:47,994
I never want you
to leave me again.

889
01:04:48,061 --> 01:04:51,665
I would insist you stay,
whether I'm dead or alive.

890
01:04:51,732 --> 01:04:55,167
That's very generous.

891
01:04:55,234 --> 01:04:56,603
Thank you, Ghoster.

892
01:04:57,403 --> 01:05:01,206
Actually, what's your real name?

893
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:03,409
William.

894
01:05:03,475 --> 01:05:05,144
It's a pleasure
to meet you, William.

895
01:05:24,662 --> 01:05:26,363
We did it.

896
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:30,601
- Dad.
- Huh?

897
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:33,270
Right.

898
01:05:33,336 --> 01:05:35,272
It's Friday the 13th.

899
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:37,507
We've got one shot at this.

900
01:05:38,776 --> 01:05:40,210
Are we ready?

901
01:05:40,976 --> 01:05:43,012
Ready as we'll ever be.

902
01:05:45,247 --> 01:05:47,450
You, Juan, and I should
probably stay behind,

903
01:05:47,517 --> 01:05:48,552
guard the house.

904
01:05:48,618 --> 01:05:50,754
Keep anyone from the bank away.

905
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,054
Yeah.

906
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:54,658
Okay.

907
01:05:56,257 --> 01:05:58,594
Let's go get Ghoster.

908
01:06:06,635 --> 01:06:08,102
They'll be fine.

909
01:06:10,773 --> 01:06:13,240
This is the moment
everything has been building to.

910
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:16,009
We need to focus on the goal.

911
01:06:16,076 --> 01:06:17,912
It's gonna be scary.

912
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:20,147
You can't let that stop you.

913
01:06:20,214 --> 01:06:22,684
Yuto must be defeated tonight.

914
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:28,488
You can do this,
William. You can.

915
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:34,728
- Ready?
- Ready.

916
01:06:46,772 --> 01:06:48,206
Okay, so...

917
01:06:50,175 --> 01:06:51,744
what do we do, Ghoster?

918
01:06:51,811 --> 01:06:54,547
The light of the full moon
needs to hit the painting.

919
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:58,383
Look, it's happening.

920
01:06:59,685 --> 01:07:01,185
Wow.

921
01:07:01,252 --> 01:07:03,822
They don't make paintings
like that anymore.

922
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:06,758
Elizabeth, hold out the key.

923
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:17,333
Here we go.

924
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:48,195
Here it is... The doorway
to the first challenge.

925
01:07:48,262 --> 01:07:49,665
Let's go.

926
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:29,703
What's with the owl?

927
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:34,373
I wonder if the statues
have something to do with it.

928
01:08:40,111 --> 01:08:41,947
I know the letters
on the shields

929
01:08:42,014 --> 01:08:44,148
must be part of the solution.

930
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,685
This one says K.

931
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:48,554
- What?
- K!

932
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,127
This one has an A.

933
01:09:05,268 --> 01:09:07,505
This one has an E.

934
01:09:09,806 --> 01:09:10,874
Ooh!

935
01:09:16,312 --> 01:09:18,849
- This one says B.
- Wait, Mateo.

936
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:34,429
Was it something I said?

937
01:09:34,497 --> 01:09:37,198
I think we need
to say them in order.

938
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:39,702
Yeah.

939
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:42,837
Yeah.

940
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:45,339
It's a scrambled word.

941
01:09:45,406 --> 01:09:47,642
The letters are...

942
01:09:47,709 --> 01:09:52,147
B, K, E, and A.

943
01:09:52,212 --> 01:09:54,415
I've got it. Bake.

944
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,483
It's worth a try.

945
01:10:01,955 --> 01:10:03,957
B, A, K, E!

946
01:10:16,334 --> 01:10:18,104
- I don't think it was bake.
- Wait!

947
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:21,774
Guys, the owl statue.

948
01:10:21,841 --> 01:10:23,208
Notice what's missing?

949
01:10:26,846 --> 01:10:30,082
Beak, of course!
It has to be beak.

950
01:10:30,148 --> 01:10:33,317
It better be, or we're
gonna be shish kebabs.

951
01:10:33,384 --> 01:10:35,486
Wait a minute, kebab!
K, A...

952
01:10:35,554 --> 01:10:38,924
- It's beak.
- Yeah. Too many As.

953
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:46,229
B, E, A, K!

954
01:11:18,894 --> 01:11:21,029
Well, that was easy.

955
01:11:22,498 --> 01:11:24,900
"Kabab"? Really?

956
01:11:26,168 --> 01:11:28,336
Uh? Hmm.

957
01:11:54,426 --> 01:11:56,362
What do you think this means?

958
01:11:56,428 --> 01:11:59,599
It seems like the levers
control the mirrors.

959
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,935
- Let's find out.
- Be careful.

960
01:12:02,002 --> 01:12:03,770
It's cool.

961
01:12:23,087 --> 01:12:24,522
I get it.

962
01:12:24,589 --> 01:12:25,924
We need to position the mirrors

963
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:27,424
so that the light bounces
around the room.

964
01:12:27,492 --> 01:12:28,993
What are we aiming for?

965
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,729
Uh, my guess would be this.

966
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,165
Right.

967
01:12:34,232 --> 01:12:36,700
The owl led the way
last time. Why not this time?

968
01:12:36,767 --> 01:12:39,870
Well, what are we waiting for?

969
01:12:54,317 --> 01:12:55,618
Thanks.

970
01:12:57,186 --> 01:13:00,056
There has to be a clue to
what order we pull the levers.

971
01:13:00,122 --> 01:13:01,423
Look, here's something.

972
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:05,494
The numbers one, two, and six.

973
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:07,896
It's not much to go on.

974
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:11,465
I found something.

975
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:15,737
It looks like these are numbers.

976
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,508
Roman numerals.

977
01:13:20,575 --> 01:13:22,711
I got this. Okay.

978
01:13:22,777 --> 01:13:25,713
We know one works.
One.

979
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,588
Two.

980
01:13:44,831 --> 01:13:45,865
Six.

981
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:56,508
I thought you said you got this!

982
01:13:56,575 --> 01:13:59,144
I don't understand!
It's one, two, six!

983
01:13:59,211 --> 01:14:00,479
We're hosed.

984
01:14:00,545 --> 01:14:03,215
Don't give up.
We can figure this out.

985
01:14:03,282 --> 01:14:04,583
That's easy for you to say.

986
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,118
You can fly!

987
01:14:06,184 --> 01:14:08,020
Plus, you're already dead.

988
01:14:08,086 --> 01:14:09,453
That was uncalled for.

989
01:14:09,521 --> 01:14:12,023
Mom, I could really
use your help here.

990
01:14:16,426 --> 01:14:18,562
- One.
- What are you doing?

991
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:22,500
- Two.
- Are you trying to kill us?

992
01:14:26,404 --> 01:14:29,239
- Do you trust me?
- Together.

993
01:14:29,306 --> 01:14:30,674
Four!

994
01:14:52,394 --> 01:14:54,129
How did...

995
01:14:54,196 --> 01:14:56,231
When I looked in the mirror,
it came to me.

996
01:14:56,298 --> 01:14:59,134
The reflection of six is four.

997
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:01,436
You're a genius.

998
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:02,603
I never would have
figured that out.

999
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,205
Aren't you glad you trusted me?

1000
01:15:04,272 --> 01:15:05,540
I didn't, really.

1001
01:15:05,606 --> 01:15:06,941
I just thought
that if I was gonna die,

1002
01:15:07,008 --> 01:15:10,111
I wanted to be
holding your hand.

1003
01:15:10,178 --> 01:15:13,114
If you're scared and want to hold
my hand, all you have to do is ask.

1004
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:14,749
I'm not scared.

1005
01:15:14,816 --> 01:15:18,018
<i>I</i> wasn't the one
screaming earlier.

1006
01:15:30,564 --> 01:15:32,365
Bring it on!

1007
01:15:32,431 --> 01:15:33,933
Let's do this!

1008
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,370
There you are. Thank
heavens I found you.

1009
01:15:37,436 --> 01:15:39,271
Connie?

1010
01:15:39,338 --> 01:15:40,906
Quick, we need to get back to
the house and help your father.

1011
01:15:40,973 --> 01:15:41,907
What's going on?

1012
01:15:41,974 --> 01:15:44,110
The bank sent a dozen men.

1013
01:15:44,176 --> 01:15:46,445
James needs our help.
You'll have to finish this later.

1014
01:15:46,512 --> 01:15:49,514
I... We can't just leave.

1015
01:15:50,582 --> 01:15:52,584
It's an emergency.

1016
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:55,086
He wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.

1017
01:15:55,153 --> 01:15:56,421
Let's go.

1018
01:15:56,489 --> 01:15:57,922
How'd you get down here?

1019
01:16:00,759 --> 01:16:03,961
The door in the painting,
it's still open, okay?

1020
01:16:04,028 --> 01:16:05,929
Come on. There is
no time to lose.

1021
01:16:05,996 --> 01:16:08,165
You solved all the puzzles?

1022
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:11,969
Well, not exactly.

1023
01:16:14,104 --> 01:16:16,306
Let's just say,
Ghoster is not the only one

1024
01:16:16,373 --> 01:16:18,375
who can travel through mirrors.

1025
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,287
Look, it's Yuto!

1026
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,229
We've come too far
for you to stop us now, Yuto.

1027
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:49,805
The light knife.

1028
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:57,978
You think,
with your little knife,

1029
01:16:58,045 --> 01:17:01,483
that you have the power
to take on me?

1030
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:14,828
<i>Ingara Rozora.</i>

1031
01:17:17,464 --> 01:17:19,365
No!

1032
01:17:19,432 --> 01:17:21,768
What's happening?

1033
01:17:21,835 --> 01:17:26,839
Elizabeth... help... me.

1034
01:17:26,905 --> 01:17:28,640
<i>Did you really think I'd let you</i>

1035
01:17:28,707 --> 01:17:31,376
<i>get through all of my
challenges and defeat me?</i>

1036
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:34,947
Where is my father?

1037
01:17:35,013 --> 01:17:37,683
<i>Busy with something or other.</i>

1038
01:17:37,749 --> 01:17:39,851
<i>He's the least
of your worries now.</i>

1039
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,020
What have you done to him?!

1040
01:17:43,087 --> 01:17:45,256
<i>Oh, he's just a little tied up...</i>

1041
01:17:46,492 --> 01:17:48,459
Excuse me.

1042
01:17:48,527 --> 01:17:52,997
I said, he's tied up.

1043
01:17:54,332 --> 01:17:56,166
What have you done with Ghoster?

1044
01:17:56,233 --> 01:17:58,235
I placed a spell on him.

1045
01:17:59,069 --> 01:18:01,905
His life force is draining.

1046
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:07,978
By midnight, he will be no more.

1047
01:18:11,747 --> 01:18:13,182
What do we do now?

1048
01:18:14,551 --> 01:18:17,119
On the count of three,
you go left, I'll go right.

1049
01:18:17,186 --> 01:18:19,523
Okay, so on three,
or after three?

1050
01:18:19,589 --> 01:18:21,457
I count to three and then we go.

1051
01:18:21,525 --> 01:18:23,659
You know I can hear you, right?

1052
01:18:23,726 --> 01:18:24,960
Three!

1053
01:18:32,133 --> 01:18:33,434
Mateo!

1054
01:18:33,502 --> 01:18:37,172
I've dreamt of this
moment for 50 years.

1055
01:18:37,238 --> 01:18:43,044
Finally, the bloodline
is complete.

1056
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:44,244
You see,

1057
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:48,248
with your mother
and uncle's souls...

1058
01:18:48,315 --> 01:18:51,018
I thought I'd finally found
a pair of siblings

1059
01:18:51,084 --> 01:18:54,821
to complete the transformation.

1060
01:18:54,888 --> 01:18:58,325
But when that wretched
uncle of theirs

1061
01:18:58,392 --> 01:19:00,993
sent your mother away...

1062
01:19:02,428 --> 01:19:05,264
I had to bide my time

1063
01:19:05,331 --> 01:19:08,834
and wait for the next
full moon...

1064
01:19:09,835 --> 01:19:11,370
and your arrival.

1065
01:19:11,437 --> 01:19:13,139
What do you mean?

1066
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:18,276
A female member of your
family's bloodline was required.

1067
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:23,649
Who do you think sent
the inheritance letter?

1068
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:31,256
So now with you here,
my young heiress...

1069
01:19:31,389 --> 01:19:37,027
just as I planned,
my rebirth is assured.

1070
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:02,252
Not today, Yuto.

1071
01:20:03,353 --> 01:20:05,455
What's this?

1072
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:12,995
No!

1073
01:20:20,067 --> 01:20:22,336
No, this isn't how it ends.

1074
01:20:22,403 --> 01:20:23,904
Not like this!

1075
01:20:23,971 --> 01:20:26,407
No!

1076
01:20:27,975 --> 01:20:29,443
Grab the box, Elizabeth.

1077
01:20:41,589 --> 01:20:42,856
Where's Yuto?

1078
01:20:42,922 --> 01:20:43,990
Sit on this.

1079
01:20:44,057 --> 01:20:45,660
That's something I can do.

1080
01:20:45,726 --> 01:20:48,228
I am so proud of you.

1081
01:20:49,396 --> 01:20:52,298
You've been incredibly brave
through all this time.

1082
01:20:52,364 --> 01:20:56,168
Mom... I'm still
so scared for Ghoster.

1083
01:20:57,537 --> 01:20:58,937
I can save him.

1084
01:20:59,004 --> 01:21:03,042
But I need to say goodbye
before I do.

1085
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,746
I cannot return after.

1086
01:21:06,812 --> 01:21:08,880
No, Mom, I can't lose you again.

1087
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:11,883
But I can give him
a life he never had.

1088
01:21:14,986 --> 01:21:16,254
I love you, Mom.

1089
01:21:17,188 --> 01:21:19,190
Darling, I love you.

1090
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:25,329
I will always be with you.

1091
01:21:26,531 --> 01:21:28,165
Always.

1092
01:21:59,495 --> 01:22:03,264
So what? Should we
head back now?

1093
01:22:32,693 --> 01:22:34,327
Okay.

1094
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:41,401
Abigail!

1095
01:22:42,703 --> 01:22:44,436
Is it... really you?

1096
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:49,107
Promise me
you'll watch over her.

1097
01:22:50,142 --> 01:22:53,111
I will. I promise.

1098
01:22:53,979 --> 01:22:56,582
There's no time.
I must go.

1099
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:16,600
I've waited 50 years for this.

1100
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:35,017
Hi, guys.

1101
01:23:42,057 --> 01:23:44,993
Abigail, what are you doing?

1102
01:23:57,673 --> 01:24:00,709
Wait, is that...

1103
01:24:12,453 --> 01:24:13,554
Oh!

1104
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:16,524
What's happening?

1105
01:24:54,559 --> 01:24:56,426
Two past 12:00.

1106
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:01,064
He should be here by now.

1107
01:25:18,582 --> 01:25:19,783
Look.

1108
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:34,664
William.

1109
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:45,139
Welcome to the land
of the living.

1110
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:47,676
It's good to be back.

1111
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,929
The lot of you. You're
out of here. You're gone.

1112
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:10,698
Mr. Alessi,

1113
01:26:10,764 --> 01:26:13,900
<i>I</i> am the rightful heir
and owner of Echoville Manor,

1114
01:26:13,967 --> 01:26:18,303
<i>and</i> you are trespassing.
Kindly leave.

1115
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:21,206
You? Oh, that's cute.

1116
01:26:21,273 --> 01:26:23,342
But you're just a kid.

1117
01:26:23,408 --> 01:26:25,478
Listen, the bank
now owns this property.

1118
01:26:25,545 --> 01:26:27,746
The time to claim it
has long since passed.

1119
01:26:27,813 --> 01:26:31,450
I believe this
should more than cover

1120
01:26:31,516 --> 01:26:35,087
James's outstanding debts
with interest.

1121
01:26:35,186 --> 01:26:39,423
So let's consider
this matter closed.

1122
01:26:47,297 --> 01:26:49,132
Let's go, boys.

1123
01:26:54,739 --> 01:26:56,741
Now that unpleasantness
is sorted,

1124
01:26:56,807 --> 01:27:00,309
I believe we have
a party to attend.

1125
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:26,468
She's always here.

1126
01:27:27,102 --> 01:27:27,870
I know.

1127
01:27:32,006 --> 01:27:34,408
I just realized,
you've never danced before.

1128
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:37,945
I believe you are
absolutely right.

1129
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:41,248
May I have the honor?
